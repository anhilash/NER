      A method for making a lampshade (1, 30) of the type which comprises at least one support ring (3, 4) and a side wall (5) secured to the support ring (3, 4) by a ligature (7), wherein the support ring (3, 4) comprises a plurality of ligature receiving means (16, 40, 44) at spaced apart locations along the support ring (3, 4), and a plurality of spaced apart apertures (15) are formed in the side wall (5) adjacent the support ring method comprising the steps of inserting respective portions of the ligature (7) sequentially into the wall apertures (15), and securing the respective portions of the ligature (7) to the ligature receiving means (16, 40, 44) on the support ring (3, 4).
    </p>
  </abstract>
  <description format="original" lang="en" id="desc_en">
    <p num="1">The present invention relates to a lampshade, and to a method for making the lampshade.</p>
    <p num="2">
      Lampshades are provided in many shapes and forms, and are provided for use in connection with table lamps, standard lamps, ceiling suspended lights and the like.
      <br/>
      Typically, such lampshades comprise an upper support ring and a lower support ring, and a side wall or side walls extend between the upper and lower rings.
      <br/>
      The side wall may be an endless wall which extends completely around and between the two rings, or it may be formed in segments which extend between the two rings and are spaced apart circumferentially around the two support rings.
      <br/>
      The side wall or walls are secured to the upper and lower rings, and may be secured by adhesive, stitching or, indeed, by folding around the upper and lower support rings.
      <br/>
      Such forms of construction of lampshade will be well known to those skilled in the art.
    </p>
    <p num="3">
      One particular type of lampshade comprises an upper and a lower support ring and a single endless side wall or a plurality of side walls extending between the support rings, and the side wall or side walls is secured to one or both support rings by a ligature, which may be of leather, textile, such as, for example, a ribbon, coarse twine, wire or the like, or cord.
      <br/>
      The side wall or walls are provided with a row of spaced apart apertures adjacent one or both the top and bottom edges of the side wall or side walls and the ligature is threaded sequentially through the apertures and wound around the adjacent support ring in a helical form.
      <br/>
      Such construction of lampshade, though it has been well known for many years has recently become increasingly popular.
      <br/>
      However, the manufacture of such lampshades is particularly tedious and time consuming.
      <br/>
      The ligature must be threaded through each aperture, and wound around the adjacent support ring and a portion of the side wall or walls of the lampshade between the apertures and the edge thereof.
      <br/>
      The ligature requires pulling through all the apertures, and the entire length of the ligature must be pulled through the first aperture, and virtually the entire length of the ligature must be pulled through the second aperture, and so on until the ligature has been passed through all the apertures.
      <br/>
      This, it will be appreciated is a particularly time consuming task, and does not lend itself to mass production of this type of lampshade.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      European Patent Specification No. 325878 discloses a lampshade with a removable cover in which the removable cover is a skirt.
      <br/>
      The skirt is held in place with a combination of flaps, strips, and annular metal components.
      <br/>
      However, the patent specification does not disclose or suggest a method which obviates the need for time-consuming threading procedures in the mass production of lampshades having a ligature component in its assembly.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      A need exists for an improved method for making a lampshade of the aforementioned type.
      <br/>
      A need also exists for a lampshade of the aforementioned type having an improved construction.
    </p>

    <p num="44">
      Referring to the drawings and initially to FIGS. 1 to 9 thereof, there is illustrated a lampshade according to the invention which is indicated generally by the reference numeral 1.
      <br/>
      The lampshade 1 as well as being in accordance with the invention is also made by a method according to the invention which will be described below.
      <br/>
      The lampshade 1 is provided with a mounting frame 53 for mounting the lampshade on a lamp or other light fitting.
      <br/>
      The mounting frame 53 is shown in broken lines for clarity.
      <br/>
      As will be appreciated by those skilled in the art, the mounting frame 53 can be of a variety of types and can be integral with the lampshade 1 or attachable to the lampshade 1.
      <br/>
      The mounting frame 53 has been omitted from FIGS. 2 to 17 for clarity.
    </p>
    <p num="45">
      The lampshade 1 comprises a pair of support rings, namely, a top support ring 3 and a bottom support ring 4, both of plastics material.
      <br/>
      A side wall 5 of a flexible resilient plastics material extends between and completely around the support rings 3 and 4, and overlaps the rings 3 and 4.
      <br/>
      The side wall 5 is secured to the top and bottom reinforcing rings 3 and 4 by respective ligatures 7, which are not illustrated in FIG. 1.
      <br/>
      The ligatures 7 are typically of cord and are in the form of a helix.
      <br/>
      The top and bottom support rings 3 and 4 comprise an annular reinforcing section 8 and a relatively thin annular portion 9 extending from the reinforcing section 8.
      <br/>
      The portions 9 of the respective rings 3 and 4 terminate in side edges 10, which when the side wall 5 is secured to the rings 3 and 4 coincide with corresponding top and bottom edges 11 and 12, respectively, of the side wall 5.
      <br/>
      The thin portion 9 of the bottom support ring 4 diverges outwardly and takes up the approximate angle of divergence of the side wall 5, while the thin portion 9 of the top support ring converges inwardly to take up the approximate angle of convergence of the side wall 5 adjacent the top ring 3.
    </p>
    <p num="46">
      Two rows of spaced apart apertures 15 are provided in the side wall 5 adjacent but spaced apart in from the top and bottom side edges 11 and 12 for receiving the ligatures 7.
      <br/>
      A plurality of spaced apart ligature receiving means, each of which is provided by an aperture 16 are located in the thin portions 9 of the respective top and bottom support rings 3 and 4, also for receiving the ligatures 7.
      <br/>
      The ring apertures 16 are alignable with the corresponding wall apertures 15.
      <br/>
      To avoid having to thread the ligatures 7 through the respective wall and ring apertures 15 and 16, respectively, a plurality of first and second access means are provided in the side wall 5 and the thin portions 9 of the support rings 3 and 4.
      <br/>
      The first access means are provided by first access slits or slots 18 which extend from the top and bottom side edges 11 and 12 of the side wall 5 to the wall apertures 15.
      <br/>
      The second access means are provided by respective second access slits or slots 20 which extend from the side edges 10 of the support rings 3 and 4 to the ring apertures 16.
      <br/>
      The first access slots 18 and the second access slots 20 are also alignable with each other.
    </p>
    <p num="47">
      The first and second access slots 18 and 20 are inclined to the respective top and bottom edges 10, 11 and 12, and define part of the helix formed by the respective ligatures 7, so that portions 21 of the ligatures 7 which extend between respective ones of the wall apertures 15 and the top or bottom edge 11 or 12 of the side wall extend over the corresponding first access slots 18 for concealing the access slots 18.
      <br/>
      The dimensions of the first and second access slots 18 and 20, and the diameter of the ligatures 7 are so chosen that once assembled there is no danger of the ligatures 7 passing back into any of the access slots 18 and 20, which would thus cause disengagement of one of the ligatures 7 from the corresponding ring and wall apertures 15 and 16.
    </p>
    <p num="48">
      The lampshade 1 is made according to the method of the invention which is as follows.
      <br/>
      Initially, the side wall 5 and top and bottom support rings 3 and 4 are held together, typically, by a few dots of a suitable adhesive located at spaced apart intervals around the support rings 3 and 4 between the respective rings 3 and 4 and the side wall 5.
      <br/>
      A first loop of the ligature 7 is formed as illustrated in FIGS. 5 and 6 by the reference a. The first loop a is passed through one of the wall and ring apertures 15 and 16.
      <br/>
      The ligature 7 is then inserted into the next adjacent wall and ring apertures 15 and 16 by urging a portion of the ligature 7 through the corresponding first and second access slots 18 and 20 into the said next adjacent wall and ring apertures 15 and 16.
      <br/>
      In FIGS. 5 and 6 the first two loops b of the helix formed by the ligature 7 are illustrated having been formed, and the next loop of the helix is being formed.
      <br/>
      After the previous loop has been formed the ligature 7 is then urged into the first and second access slots 18 and 20 of the next wall and ring apertures 15 and 16 which are indicated by the reference letter c in FIGS. 5 and 6.
      <br/>
      While the portion of the ligature 7 which is being urged through the access slots 18 and 20 into the apertures c a portion of the ligature which forms the loop of the helix which is being formed is held by the thumb or a finger at d which is adjacent the edge 11 or 12 of the side wall 5, and also adjacent the entry of the previous access slots 18 and 20.
      <br/>
      While being held at the position d a portion of the ligature 7 is arranged to extend along and to conceal the previous first access slot 18.
      <br/>
      On being urged into the wall and aperture slots c the ligature 7 is then pulled tightly to form the loop of the helix.
      <br/>
      However, excess tension is not applied to the ligature 7 in order to avoid any danger of the ligature 7 re-entering the previous first and second access slots 18 and 20 at the point d. The ligature 7 is illustrated in FIG. 6 having been entered in the wall and ring apertures c and being pulled taut to form the loop of the helix.
      <br/>
      This process continues until the ligature 7 has been inserted in all the wall and ring apertures 15 and 16 of the top or bottom support ring 3 or 4, and then the method is repeated for securing the side wall 5 to the other of the top and bottom support rings 3 and 4 with the ligature 7.
    </p>
    <p num="49">
      Referring now to FIGS. 10 to 13 there is illustrated a lampshade 30 according to a second embodiment of the invention.
      <br/>
      The lampshade 30 is substantially similar to the lampshade 1, and similar components are identified by the same reference numerals.
      <br/>
      The main difference between the lampshade 30 and the lampshade 1 is in the respective top and bottom support rings 3 and 4 and the fact that first and second access slots 18 and 19 to the wall and ring apertures 15 and 16 are not required.
      <br/>
      In this embodiment of the invention instead of the ligatures 7 being wound in the form of a helix, the ligatures 7 are secured to the side wall 5 and top and bottom support rings 3 and 4 in the form of stitching.
    </p>
    <p num="50">
      The top and bottom support rings 3 and 4 comprise a reinforcing section 31 from which a relatively thin portion 32 extends.
      <br/>
      The ring apertures 16 are formed in the thin portion 32.
      <br/>
      Ligature receiving means in this embodiment of the invention are provided by a plurality of sets of spaced apart slits 38 formed in a strip 35 of resilient flexible material which radiate outwardly from a central point 39.
      <br/>
      The strip 35 is bonded to the thin portion 32 of the respective support rings 3 and 4 with the sets of slits 38 aligned with the corresponding ring apertures 16.
      <br/>
      Each set of slits 38 defines resiliently deformable portions 40 which deform inwardly on one of the portions of the ligature 7 being urged in through the ring apertures 16, and then retain that portion of the ligature 7 in secure engagement therewith thereby preventing withdrawal of the portion of the ligatures 7.
    </p>
    <p num="51">
      The lampshade 30 is made according to the method of the invention as follows.
      <br/>
      Initially, the side wall 5 is secured to the top and bottom rings 3 and 4 with corresponding wall and ring apertures 15 and 16 aligned.
      <br/>
      Typically, the side wall 5 is secured to the top and bottom rings 3 and 4 by a few dots of adhesive between the side wall 5 and the respective rings 3 and 4 as already described.
      <br/>
      The ligatures 7 are then secured to the top and bottom of the lampshade 30.
    </p>
    <p num="52">
      In an alternative method of making the lampshade 30, the side wall 5 is first formed and pre-moulded top and bottom rings 3 and 4 simply placed in the inverted lampshade 30.
      <br/>
      Typically, injection moulded rings 3 and 4 are used.
      <br/>
      Injection moulded plastics rings 3 and 4 have the advantage that the dimensions of same can be accurately reproduced in manufacture.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, the rings 3 and 4 can be dimensioned to be automatically correctly positioned in an inverted lampshade under the force of gravity adjacent the edges of the lampshade 30 without requiring the use of adhesive to locate the rings 3 and 4.
    </p>
    <p num="53">
      One end of the ligature is secured in any one of a corresponding pair of the wall and ring apertures 15 and 16 which is selected, and the ligature is then lightly stretched is doubled adjacent the next wall and ring apertures 15 and 16 and inserted through the wall aperture 15, and in turn the ring aperture 16 and secured in the slits 38.
      <br/>
      This method is continued until the ligature 7 is secured through the side wall 5 to the top or bottom support ring 3 or 4 to form a row of stitching as illustrated in FIG. 10. The second ligature 7 is then secured in similar fashion through the side wall 5 to the other of the top and bottom support ring 3 and 4.
    </p>
    <p num="54">
      FIGS. 14 to 17 show a third embodiment of a lampshade 1 in accordance with the invention which is made by a method also according to the invention which will be described in detail below.
      <br/>
      The lampshade 1 is broadly similar to those shown in FIGS. 1 to 13 in that it comprises a side wall 5 of semi-rigid material, which in this case is a plastics material, and which is of frusto conical shape.
      <br/>
      The side wall 5 is secured to an upper ring 3 and a lower ring 4 by respective ligatures 7 which in this case are provided by elongate strips of leather.
      <br/>
      The side wall 5 is formed from a single sheet of plastics material which is cut to shape and secured along a seam 41 by adhesive to form what is effectively an endless side wall 5.
      <br/>
      A plurality of spaced apart apertures 15 are arranged in two rows in the sidewall 5, namely, an upper row 42 and a lower row 43 for accommiodating the respective ligatures 7 to the upper and lower rings 3 and 4, respectively.
      <br/>
      The rows 42 and 43 of apertures 15 are located relatively closely to upper and lower edges 11 and 12, respectively, of the side wall 5.
      <br/>
      An access means, namely, a slit 18 extends from each aperture 15 to the adjacent edge 11 or 12 for accommodating quick entry of the ligature 7 into the corresponding apertures 15.
    </p>
    <p num="55">
      The upper and lower rings 3 and 4 are of plastics material, and are similar to each other with the exception that the upper ring 3 is of smaller diameter than the lower ring 4 for accommodating the frusto conical shape of the side wall 5.
      <br/>
      A plurality of ligature receiving means, namely, hooks 44 for engaging the ligature 7 extend from the rings 3 and 4, in a direction generally inwardly towards a centre 45 defined by the respective rings 3 and 4.
      <br/>
      One aperture 15 is provided in the respective upper and lower rows 42 and 43 of apertures 15 for each hook 44.
      <br/>
      Grooves 46 extend radially through the rings 3 and 4 adjacent the hooks 44 for accommodating loops 47 of the ligature 7 from the apertures 15 to corresponding hooks 44.
      <br/>
      For the purpose of minimising the volume of plastics material required for the upper and lower rings 3 and 4, recesses 48 are formed in portions 49 of the respective rings 3 and 4 between the hooks 44.
      <br/>
      A wall 50 of one of the portions 49 is provided with four slots 51 for engaging and securing the two ends 52 of the ligature 7.
    </p>
    <p num="56">
      The method for making the lampshade 1 of FIGS. 14 to 17 will now be described.
      <br/>
      For convenience the side wall 5 is initially secured to the lower ring 4, and is then secured to the upper ring 3.
      <br/>
      With the side wall 5 formed into the frusto conical shape the lower ring 4 is engaged within the side wall 5 adjacent its lower edge 12.
      <br/>
      During this operation, and during the securing of the side wall 2 to the lower ring 4 the side wall 5 is inverted so that the lower edge 12 is facing upwards.
      <br/>
      The apertures 15 are aligned with the grooves 46 in the lower ring 4.
      <br/>
      One end 52 of the ligature 7 is secured in one of the slots 51 in the lower ring 4.
      <br/>
      The ligature 7 is then hooked onto the adjacent hook 44 and is passed through the corresponding groove 46, and is passed through and is entered in the adjacent aperture 15 of the side wall 5 by entering the ligature 7 through the corresponding slit 18.
      <br/>
      A loop 47 is then formed in the ligature 7, and the loop 47 is entered into the next adjacent aperture 15 through the slit 18, and the loop 47 is in turn looped onto the corresponding hooks 44, and a free portion of the ligature 7 is pulled until the loop 47 tightly engages the hook 44, thereby retaining the adjacent portion of the side wall 5 to the lower ring 4.
      <br/>
      Another loop 47 is formed and entered into the aperture 15 and is looped onto the corresponding hook 44, and a further free portion of the ligature 7 is pulled tightly thereby tightening the ligature 7 onto the hook 47 for further securing the side wall 5 onto the lower ring 4.
      <br/>
      This operation continues until loops 47 have been entered into all the apertures 15 and looped onto the corresponding hooks 44.
      <br/>
      The other free end 52 of the ligature 7 is then engaged in one of the other slots 51 so that both free ends 52 of the ligature 7 are secured in the slots 52.
      <br/>
      On the side wall 5 having been secured to the lower ring 4, the side wall 5 is then secured to the upper ring 3.
      <br/>
      For convenience the side wall 5 is reinverted so that the upper edge 11 faces upwardly.
    </p>
    <p num="57">
      Alternatively, instead of forming loops 47 prior to the loop 47 being looped onto the corresponding hook 44, the ligature could be secured in the following fashion.
      <br/>
      After securing one end 52 to the lower ring 4 and hooking the ligature 7 onto the adjacent hook 44, and in turn entering the ligature into the corresponding aperture 15, the ligature 7 without forming a loop 47 could then be entered into the next aperture 15 through the corresponding slit 18, and then could be looped around the hook 44 and passed back out through the groove 46 and that aperture 15 before being entered into the next adjacent aperture 15 through the corresponding slit 18, and so on.

    <p num="58">
      While the lampshade 1 has been described as comprising a side wall 5 which is effectively endless, it is envisaged that the lampshade may be of the type comprising an upper ring and a lower ring with one or a plurality of side walls extending between the upper and lower rings.
      <br/>
      The side walls may be located adjacent each other, or may be spaced apart.
    </p>
    <p num="59">
      It will of course be appreciated that while the side wall has been described as being of a plastics material, the side wall may be of any other material, for example, paperboard, plastics, styrene, fabric or paper, which may be laminated to paperboard, plastics or styrene, or any other suitable material.
      <br/>
      Additionally, the side wall may be rigid, semi-rigid or indeed, flexible.
      <br/>
      It is also envisaged that upper and lower rings of other shape and construction may be provided.
      <br/>
      The upper and lower rings may be of any suitable material, for example, wood, metal, plastics, styrene, wire, or the like.
      <br/>
      It is envisaged that the lampshade may comprise only one ring, for example, a lower ring, and in other cases, it is envisaged that the upper and lower rings 3 and 4 may be joined by connecting members.
    </p>
    <p num="60">
      Furthermore in the embodiment described in FIGS. 14 to 17, it is envisaged that a closure ring may be provided for closing the recess in the upper and lower rings.
      <br/>
      Ligature receiving means other than hooks 44 may also be provided.
      <br/>
      Where the receiving means are provided by hooks 44, the hooks 44 may extend in any desired direction from the rings 3 and 4.
    </p>
    <p num="61">
      While it is preferable, it is not essential that access means to the corresponding apertures should be provided.
      <br/>
      In the absence of access means to the respective apertures, each loop would be threaded through a corresponding aperture.
