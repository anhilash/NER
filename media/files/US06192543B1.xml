    <heading>CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS</heading>
    <p num="1">This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/121,558, filed Feb. 25, 1999, and having the same title and inventor(s) as above.</p>
    <heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">The present invention relates to cleaning mitts for use in cleaning automobiles or other items.</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="3">
      Cleaning mitts are known in the art.
      <br/>
      Typically they include a polyester or like batting configured to form a cavity having an open cuffed end.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      While conventional cleaning mitts have been of assistance in automobile and other item cleaning, they also have disadvantageous aspects.
      <br/>
      One of these is that the mitts have a fluffy almost sponge-like outer surface that while being good at retaining fluid and cleaning solution is not sufficiently abrasive to remove bugs, tar, and dried on dirt, etc.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      Another disadvantageous aspect of present cleaning mitts is that they permit water to pass through to a user's hand.
      <br/>
      In cold weather and/or when used with cold water, this results in the hand becoming undesirably cold.
    </p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="6">Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide a cleaning mitt that includes at least one surface that has enhanced tar and bug removing properties.</p>
    <p num="7">It is another object of the present invention to provide a cleaning mitt that has a dry liner to maintain the inside of the cleaning mitt substantially dry.</p>
    <p num="8">It is also an object of the present invention to provide various cleaning mitt arrangements that provide a supplemental abrasive cleaning surface.</p>
    <p num="9">These and related objects of the present invention are achieved by use of a cleaning mitt apparatus and method as described herein.</p>
    <p num="10">The attainment of the foregoing and related advantages and features of the invention should be more readily apparent to those skilled in the art, after review of the following more detailed description of the invention taken together with the drawings.</p>
    <heading>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading>

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
    <p num="12">
      Referring to FIGS. 1A-1C, first and second side perspective views and an end view of a cleaning mitt 10 in accordance with the present invention are respectively shown.
      <br/>
      The general nature of cleaning mitt 10 is described first with reference to FIGS. 1A-1C. A description of how the mitt is made and various alternative embodiments follow.
    </p>
    <p num="13">
      FIG. 1A illustrates a side of mitt 10 that has a relatively mild cleaning surface (hereinafter termed "mild" surface 12).
      <br/>
      This surface is suitable for general car washing purposes, etc., and may be formed of conventional car mitt material.
    </p>
    <p num="14">
      FIG. 1B illustrates another side of mitt 10.
      <br/>
      This side contains a more abrasive cleaning surface (hereinafter termed "abrasive" surface 14).
    </p>
    <p num="15">
      FIG. 1C illustrates the non-cuffed end of mitt 10.
      <br/>
      This view shows the mild surface 12 on one side and the more abrasive surface 14 on the other side.
      <br/>
      A seam 21 is preferably formed between the two surfaces (though the actual seam may be internal to the mitt).
      <br/>
      Abrasive surface 14 is preferably formed as an abrasive mesh or other suitable material that is placed over the "fluffier" mild surface material and may compress the mild material to some extent.
      <br/>
      In this manner, the benefits of the abrasive material are available on an outer surface, while the mild surface material adjacent thereto acts to bias the abrasive surface outwardly and to hold water and cleaning solution.
    </p>
    <p num="16">By providing mild and abrasive surfaces in a single mitt, a user is able to simply rotate the mitt about their hand to achieve cleaning of both easily removable debris and stubborn debris.</p>
    <p num="17">
      A moisture barrier may also be provided within the mitt to keep the interior of the mitt dry.
      <br/>
      In this manner, a gloved hand could be used within the mitt in order to keep the hand warm.
      <br/>
      This feature is particularly advantageous for cooler climates.
      <br/>
      A description of the formation of an embodiment of mitt 10 is now provided.
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      Referring to FIGS. 2-5, various stages in mitt 10 formation in accordance with the present invention are shown.
      <br/>
      In FIG. 2, a sheet 31 of mild surface material, with a sheet 32 of abrasive surface material laid over a portion thereof, is shown.
      <br/>
      The mild surface material 31 is preferably a polyester like material that has a substantially smooth surface (not shown) and a fluffy almost wool or sponge-like surface (shown).
      <br/>
      Such a material may be termed a polyester wool batting and is made by Cesyl Mills of Millbury, Mass.
      <br/>
      The material has a six denier face (fluffy side) and a 300 denier back (smooth side).
      <br/>
      In FIG. 2, the fluffy side is shown.
      <br/>
      A sheet of mesh 32 (i.e., the abrasive surface material) is preferably placed over approximately half of the face of the mild material on one side and a center seam 22 that joins one edge of the mesh to the mild surface material is stitched.
      <br/>
      The mesh material 32 is preferably a sufficiently non-abrasive material that will not damage the finish of an automobile, appliance, or other surface, while still being sufficiently abrasive to remove stubborn debris such as tar, and dried bugs and dirt, etc.
      <br/>
      A suitable material is a 100% polyester mesh model number 250 medium crisp from Jason Mills, Westwood, N.J. It should be recognized that while mesh 32 is preferably stitched on the non-abrasive material, the mesh or an equivalent may be woven or molded into the substrate material.
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      The remaining exposed face 33 of sheet 31 is then folded towards the abrasive sheet until the edges of the abrasive sheet 32 and the edge of the mild sheet line up (dashed arrow A).
      <br/>
      This folding over is shown partially in FIG. 3 and completely in FIG. 4.
      <br/>
      Seams 23 and 24 are then respectively sewn at the bottom and right side (from the perspective of FIG. 3).
      <br/>
      Seam 23 would be the same as seam 21 of FIG. 1C. The resultant product is the inside out mitt precursor shown in FIG. 4.
      <br/>
      The edge at seam 22 is smooth while the top, bottom and right sides have visible face material.
      <br/>
      Seams 23 and 24 seal the bottom and right side, respectively, and the top is open.
    </p>
    <p num="20">
      FIG. 5 illustrates the mounting of cuff 40.
      <br/>
      The inside out mitt precursor of FIG. 4 is pinched at arrows B to form a temporary vase like shape that terminates in a flange.
      <br/>
      Cuff material is aligned with the flange and securely stitched forming seam 26.
      <br/>
      A suitable cuff 40 is available commercially from Minnesota Knitting Mills of St.
      <br/>
      Paul, Minn. It is identified as a 100% polyester two-sided flared cuff (one piece of cuff material folded in half).
    </p>
    <p num="21">Suitable thread for the same described herein is Perma-Core Tex 40 made by American &amp; Efird of Mount Holly, N.C.</p>
    <p num="22">
      FIG. 5 also illustrates the provision of a dry liner 50.
      <br/>
      A dry liner 50 may be provided over the inside out mitt precursor and stitched into place when the cuff is secured (seam 26).
      <br/>
      Alternatively, the dry liner could be inserted and secured once the mitt has been turned right side out.
      <br/>
      The dry liner 50 may be a 4 mil poly plastic bag.
      <br/>
      A suitable bag is made by Northeast Poly Bag Company of Sterling, Mass.
    </p>
    <p num="23">The sage of FIG. 5 is then turned right side out, by moving the bottom of the mitt up through the cuff opening in the direction of arrow C. The right side out mitt is shown in FIGS. 1A-1C. The smooth part is on the inside.</p>
    <p num="24">
      While a preferred embodiment has been described above, it should be recognized that other embodiments are contemplated and within the present invention.
      <br/>
      These include, but are not limited to, the following.
    </p>
    <p num="25">
      Referring to FIG. 6, a mitt 10 is shown in which the abrasive mesh 32 is provided on one region of the mitt cleaning surface, for example, the fingertip region.
      <br/>
      The abrasive material may be provided at the fingertips on both sides or, for example, in the palm region on one side and the fingertip region on the other side.
      <br/>
      The mitt of FIG. 6 also preferably contains non-abrasive material 31 as discussed above.
    </p>
    <p num="26">
      Referring to FIG. 7, a mitt 10 having a groove 8 provided therein for increased dexterity is in accordance with the present invention as shown.
      <br/>
      The mitt 10 of FIG. 7 also provides an abrasive and a non-abrasive cleaning surface as discussed elsewhere herein.
    </p>
    <p num="27">
      Referring to FIG. 8, another embodiment of a mitt 10 in accordance with the present invention is shown.
      <br/>
      Mitt 10 of FIG. 8 has a plurality of abrasive particles 34 glued or otherwise attached to the non-abrasive material 31.
      <br/>
      The particles may be made of plastic or rubber or the like and may be provided on one entire face or on region(s) of one or more faces.
    </p>
    <p num="28">
      Referring to FIG. 9, yet another embodiment of a mitt 10 in accordance with the present invention is shown.
      <br/>
      Mitt 10 of FIG. 9 preferably includes non-abrasive material 31 as discussed above.
      <br/>
      An abrasive pad 35 is also preferably provided on the mitt.
      <br/>
      Pad 35 is preferably a scrub pad of the type used in household scrub pad sponge combinations or like material.
      <br/>
      The scrub pad may be applied directly to the non-abrasive material or a section of the non-abrasive material may be removed and the scrub pad inserted in its place (e.g., the wool batting of a polyester wool material can be removed and the scrub pad glued to the underlying substrate).
    </p>
    <p num="29">
      While polyester batting has been taught herein as one possible non-abrasive material, it should be recognized that other non-abrasive, water-absorbent materials can be used in its place.
      <br/>
      These include more conventional sponge like materials (e.g., open cell sponges and sponge foams), soft foam, and the like.
      <br/>
      As opposed to stitching, it may be necessary to join the sponge, foam or related materials with heat sealing or glue.
      <br/>
      These sponge or foam like materials may be provided in mitt 10 in whole or in part.
    </p>
    <p num="30">
      Other embodiments of a wash mitt in accordance with the present invention include the following.
      <br/>
      One is a mitt as described above, but with the abrasive mesh or other material provided on the inside.
      <br/>
      The mitt is turned inside out for utilization of the abrasive surface.
      <br/>
      Another is a mitt in which the abrasive material is detachable and, for example, may be slid over the mild surface and fastened with snaps, buttons or Velcro for use.
      <br/>
      In yet another, both sides (12,14) of the mitt include the abrasive surface.
      <br/>
      In this scenario, a conventional mitt may be used for cleaning more easily removable debris and the mitt with abrasive material on both sides is used for cleaning more stubborn debris.
    </p>
