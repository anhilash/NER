    <p num="3">
      The invention is directed to sorbents used for separating oxygen from mixtures containing other components.
      <br/>
      More particularly, the invention is directed to the use of transition element complexes (TECs) as oxygen selective sorbents.
    </p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="4">
      The separation and enrichment of air by the use of either rate or equilibrium selective sorbents has been practiced for some time.
      <br/>
      Nitrogen selective sorbents, as typified by ion-exchanged zeolites, are nitrogen selective at equilibrium and have been used in pressure swing adsorption (PSA) processes.
      <br/>
      Similarly, carbon molecular sieves (CMS) are used for air separation by PSA processes and rely on a rate selectivity for oxygen.
      <br/>
      Adsorbents that are oxygen selective at equilibrium are preferred for many applications since cycle times for PSA processes are not constrained as typically required for rate selective sorbents.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      Transition element complexes (TECs) are one class of materials known to react reversibly at or below ambient temperatures without breaking the O.dbd.O double bond.
      <br/>
      The use of TECs to selectively remove oxygen from its mixtures with other gases has been disclosed for solutions of TECs, for solid-state TECs or slurries of said solids, for TECs supported physically on solid supports, for TECs incorporated in zeolites and for TECs bound chemically to physical supports.
      <br/>
      Each of the known approaches for the use of TECs have been beset by one or more of the following problems: (1) insufficient oxygen capacity, (2) slow reaction rates, (3) decreasing reactivity with time, and (4) a metal ion: oxygen binding ratio of 2:1 ( MU -peroxo).
      <br/>
      Due to these problems, none of such TEC systems has yet been employed in commercially acceptable embodiments for air separation or oxygen removal from gas stream applications.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      Extensive literature reports exist describing the reversible oxygenation of TECs having tetradentate ligands, particularly in solution.
      <br/>
      These materials require an exogenous base (e.g. a molecule or ion, added as a separate component, with a site or sites capable of coordinating to the metal center by electron donation) such as pyridine.
      <br/>
      The use of an exogenous base is necessary for TECs based on tetradentate ligands in order to provide the five-coordinate deoxy TEC sites required for superoxo binding.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      One class of TECs is referred to as "protected" TECs.
      <br/>
      These use ligand superstructures referred to as "caps", "picket-fences", and "bridges" to sterically inhibit m-peroxo binding and to provide a permanent void on one face of the TEC that serves as an oxygen interaction site.
      <br/>
      Examples of such ligand systems include porphyrins, cyclidenes, and Schiff bases.
      <br/>
      Unfortunately, the number, complexity, and yields of the synthetic steps required to make TECs based on these superstructured ligands results in costs that are prohibitively high for many applications.
      <br/>
      In addition, the high molecular weights inherent in superstructured TECs restrict the oxygen loadings and storages that are achievable.
      <br/>
      Finally, oxygen interaction rates are slow for known non-supported solid forms of protected TECs due to intracrystalline diffusion.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      More recent reports disclose TECs having tetradentate ligands containing substituents capable of inhibiting  MU -peroxo dimer formation in solution, that can be prepared with relative ease and have relatively low molecular weights.
      <br/>
      The substituents in these systems are typically attached at a single-point.
      <br/>
      These materials require exogenous donors to provide five-coordinate deoxy TEC sites, and do not show sufficient oxygen uptake in the solid phase for commercial application.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      Reversible oxygenation of TECs having pentadentate ligands in dilute solution is also known.
      <br/>
      These include examples having substituents that inhibit  MU -peroxo dimer formation, and where the ligand structure and donors are intramolecular.
      <br/>
      To date, none of the known materials have been found to react reversibly with oxygen in the solid state.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      The preparation of coordination polymers based on discrete molecular TECs incorporating sites capable of intermolecular donation has also been described.
      <br/>
      To date, however, none of these examples have been found to react reversibly with oxygen in the solid state.
    </p>
    <p num="11">Solid state TECs offer several advantages over those in dilute solution as the latter materials have problems which have hampered commercial development such as solubility, solvent loss, viscosity, and TEC lifetime.</p>
    <p num="12">
      The ability of transition element centers in some solid state TECs to undergo a reversible interaction with oxygen is known, and the use of supports to disperse or distribute oxygen selective sites derived from discrete molecular TECs to form oxygen selective sorbents has been described.
      <br/>
      Unfortunately, the reported examples where TECs are dispersed on or within a support, within a polymer, or as an integral part of the polymer, contain insufficient oxygen selective sites for practical use.
      <br/>
      As an example, Basolo et al ("Reversible Adsorption of Oxygen on Silica gel Modified by Imidazole-Attached Iron Tetraphenylporphyrin", J. Amer. Chem. Soc., 1975, 97, 5125-51) developed methods to attach iron porphyrins to silica gel supports via an axial donor.
      <br/>
      While these demonstrated a substantial improvement in stability relative to solution systems, the TEC content reported was less than 0.1 mol/kg.
    </p>
    <p num="13">Hendricks, in "Separation of Gases via Novel Transition Metal Complexes," Report Number NSF/ISI87101, Aug. 21, 1987 discloses attempted to prepare oxygen selective sorbents based on TECs by intermolecular donation using peripheral ligand sites.</p>
    <p num="14">However, it was concluded that the materials tested did not "rapidly and efficiently adsorb oxygen" and that this apparently was due to unfavorable molecular packing.</p>
    <p num="15">
      Another series of materials having oxygen selectivity at equilibrium includes cyanocobaltate materials such as lithium pentacyanocobaltate solvates.
      <br/>
      While gas separation processes which utilize these materials have been disclosed, ranges of composition are restricted, and an ability to optimize performance by adjusting isotherm shapes is limited.
    </p>

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="23">
      The present invention is directed to a new approach using TECs as oxygen selective sorbents.
      <br/>
      One important feature of the invention is that it involves intermolecular coordination between discrete TEC sites.
      <br/>
      This offers significant advantages over current materials with respect to structural versatility, equilibrium oxygen uptake, and other practical considerations for separation applications such as lifetime, isotherm tuning, and fast interaction rates.
    </p>
    <p num="24">
      In particular, the invention preferably comprises two features.
      <br/>
      In the first feature, discrete molecular TECs are provided wherein one or more chelating ligands provide up to four donors in an intramolecular sense to a central metal ion, said one or more chelating ligands provide a donor that binds intermolecularly to the metal ion associated with another TEC unit.
      <br/>
      In addition, said one or more ligands provide a substituent or substituents to inhibit  MU -peroxo dimer formation and ensure vacant oxygen interaction sites on a TEC.
    </p>
    <p num="25">
      A schematic representation of these features is shown in FIG. 1.
      <br/>
      The ligand substituent or substituents that inhibits  MU -peroxo dimer formation and control or modify packing of TEC units to prevent blockage of oxygen interaction sites is designated P (shown schematically as a bridge, but not required to be a bridge).
    </p>
    <p num="26">
      Preferred ligand substituents that can fulfill the role of P include alkyl, aryl, O-alkyl, O-aryl, acyl, aroyl, alkyl and aryl esters, alkylamides, halogens, nitro, and nitrile groups.
      <br/>
      Specific examples include tert-butyl-substituents for TECs derived from Schiff base adducts of salicylaldehydes, and TECs which are formally based on Schiff base adducts of 2-aroyl-1,3-dicarbonyls.
      <br/>
      In some cases, a combination of the above groups is required so that interactions between them create conformers that provide P. For example, a methyl group adjacent to a ketone may force it to rotate out of plane.
      <br/>
      In addition, in some cases, the intermolecular packing may create structures where substituents on neighboring TECs serve to create vacant oxygen interaction sites in five coordinate deoxy TECs.
    </p>
    <p num="27">
      Sites designated D provide intramolecular donation to a central metal ion designated Mn+, and serve as the primary coordination sphere.
      <br/>
      They may be comprised of similar or dissimilar donor atom types.
      <br/>
      Donor sites D include nitrogen, oxygen, and sulfur atoms present in functional groups including amines, amides, imines, aldehydes, ketones, esters, acids,  BETA -ketoimines, phenolates, alcohols, ethers, thiols, thioethers, thioesters, thioamides and various combinations thereof.
      <br/>
      Preferred examples are based on Schiff base ligands containing N2 O2 donor sets.
      <br/>
      Mn+ ions that provide the oxygen interaction sites when combined with a suitable donor set are selected from transition elements including cobalt(II), iron(II), nickel(II), manganese(II), ruthenium(II), ruthenium(III), copper(l) and rhodium(III).
      <br/>
      Cobalt(II), iron(II), nickel(II) and copper(I) are preferred.
    </p>
    <p num="28">
      Group B serves as a donor that functions intermolecularly between discrete TECs.
      <br/>
      These are constrained to serve as axial donors in an intermolecular sense due to steric and geometric factors and can be provided by the same functionalities described for D. Preferred examples of B are nitrogen, oxygen, or sulfur heterocycles.
      <br/>
      The arrows from B to Mn+ are used to represent bonds resulting from intermolecular interactions.
    </p>
    <p num="29">
      The schematic representation shown in FIG. 1 does not imply that donor groups are connected, not does it imply the identities of the metal ion, donor groups, chelating ligand, and peripheral substituents.
      <br/>
      For example, the invention is not restricted to macrocycles containing bridges as protecting groups, and may include ligands attached at a single point (pillared ligands).
      <br/>
      In typical compositions that are the subject of this invention, four donors derived from a chelating ligand coordinate intramolecularly to the metal ion.
      <br/>
      At least one other donor is provided at the ligand periphery that is capable of serving intermolecularly to form solids with a substantial proportion of five coordinate deoxy TEC sites.
      <br/>
      Ligand substituents serve to control or modify packing of TEC units to prevent blockage of oxygen interaction sites and inhibit  MU -peroxo dimer formation.
    </p>
    <p num="30">
      The general classes of TECs that are included in this invention are based on chelating ligands including macrocycles and acyclic multidentate systems such as porphyrins, cyclidenes, Schiff bases (including Schiff base derivatives of either 3-, or 2-aroyl-1,3-dicarbonyl systems), polyoxoamines, and polyamines.
      <br/>
      In some cases, conversion of the chelating ligand to the TEC may require deprotonation.
      <br/>
      For example, bis(Schiff base) adducts formed between salicylaldehydes and diamines function as dianions when combined with a divalent metal ion such as cobalt(II).
      <br/>
      TECs are included that are either symmetrical or non-symmetrical with respect to the primary coordination environment and the peripheral substituents.
      <br/>
      For example, bis(Schiff base) systems based on diamines can be formed using two different carbonyl components.
      <br/>
      A secondary source of asymmetry for TECs derived from bis(Schiff base) adducts lies in the diamine component itself.
      <br/>
      For example, TECs derived from 3,4-diaminopyridine (abbreviated as DAP) are inherently non-symmetrical.
    </p>
    <p num="31">
      One embodiment of the invention uses TECs having ligands with a primary tetradentate donor set that binds intramolecularly to the metal center and with one or more sites available for intermolecular donation from another discrete TEC.
      <br/>
      These intermolecular sites are incapable of intramolecular donation due to geometric and steric constraints.
      <br/>
      Substituents are provided on the ligand periphery to ensure that oxygen interaction sites are maintained in the solid state and that  MU -peroxo binding modes are inhibited.
    </p>
    <p num="32">TECs having ligands with substituents to control or modify TEC packing and create vacant oxygen interaction sites, but that lack extensive superstructure, such as "bridges" or "caps", are particularly preferred both for synthetic ease and to keep molecular weights below about 700 Daltons.</p>
    <p num="33">
      For non-symmetrical ligands, two cases are contemplated: (1) where the ligand is a single component with unique composition, and (2) where a mixture of ligands is utilized that includes symmetrical and nonsymmetrical components.
      <br/>
      The latter category include examples where, for example, a Schiff base condensation is performed using a diamine and a mixture of two carbonyl components.
      <br/>
      If reaction rates for the carbonyl components are comparable, then a statistical distribution of compositions is expected.
      <br/>
      The use of TEC mixtures may be beneficial to suppress highly crystalline phases and to increase the TEC content of a solid by reducing the effective molecular weight.
      <br/>
      For example, all specified features with respect to the current invention may be found in a TEC derived from a ligand mixture prepared by the Schiff base condensation between 3,4-diaminopyridine and a mixture of 3-tert-butylsalicylaldehyde and 3,5-di-tert-butylsalicylaldehyde.
      <br/>
      This mixture is not required to be equimolar.
    </p>
    <p num="34">
      In another embodiment, a deliberate mixture of TECs, formed independently, is used for sorbent formation from solution.
      <br/>
      The TEC components may contain different numbers of donors capable of serving in an intermolecular manner, but which combine so that the resulting solid contains a high proportion of five coordinate deoxy TEC sites by virtue of coordination preference, statistics, and packing in the solid state.
    </p>
    <p num="35">
      Preferred TEC families that incorporate the features described above are illustrated in FIG. 2.

      The combinations of substituents are selected so as to minimize known decomposition pathways and to tailor the oxygen binding characteristics for a particular application (e.g. fluid separation or purification).

      Some allowance is required for cooperative effects where oxygenation at TEC sites affect the equilibria for oxygenation at neighboring sites.

      In addition to improving and optimizing yields of synthetic transformations to reduce sorbent cost, sorbent purity is important to material performance.
      <br/>
      In addition, the solid formation process from solution effects sorbent performance by controlling packing, crystallinity, and porosity in the bulk solid which are necessary for fast rates.
      <br/>
      Controlled neutralization, aging of intermediate solutions, controlled evaporation, crystallization (including at subambient temperatures), freeze-drying, supercritical drying, and precipitation are contemplated as preparation methods which optimize material performance, particularly with respect to formation of solid TEC.

      Although the materials described in this invention incorporate groups capable of intermolecular coordination, the introduction of exogenous donors at less than stoichiometric amounts may be desirable either to increase the proportion of TECs existing in a five coordinate state, or to disrupt the TEC packing to give reduced framework dimensions.
      <br/>
      This may be necessary to reduce or modify cooperative effects.
      <br/>
      In addition, the use of a small proportion of exogenous donor may serve as an interface for supported forms.

    <p num="44">
      Although the compositions described herein are self-supported TEC sorbents, there are circumstances where it may be desirable to disperse them on supports.

      For example, supported forms may reduce the impact of cooperative binding effects, reduce critical dimensions of TEC crystallites, facilitate diffusional processes, serve to distribute heat associated with adsorption and desorption, and facilitate the fabrication of structured forms such as pellets or beads that may be desirable for commercial applications.
      <br/>
      The content of support material should be kept to the minimum required to address properties outlined above since the presence of a support will diminish equilibrium oxygen loadings achievable relative to a non-supported form.
