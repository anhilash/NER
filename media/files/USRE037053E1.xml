      Improved aerodynamically light particles for drug delivery to the pulmonary system, and methods for their synthesis and administration are provided.
      <br/>
      In a preferred embodiment, the aerodynamically light particles are made of a biodegradable material and have a tap density less than 0.4 g/cm3 and a mass mean diameter between 5 mum and 30 mum.
      <br/>
      The particles may be formed of biodegradable materials such as biodegradable polymers.
      <br/>
      For example, the particles may be formed of a functionalized polyester graft copolymer consisting of a linear alpha-hydroxy-acid polyester backbone having at least one amino acid group incorporated therein and at least one poly(amino acid) side chain extending from an amino acid group in the polyester backbone.
      <br/>
      In one embodiment, aerodynamically light particles having a large mean diameter, for example greater than 5 mum, can be used for enhanced delivery of a therapeutic agent to the alveolar region of the lung.
      <br/>
      The aerodynamically light particles incorporating a therapeutic agent may be effectively aerosolized for administration to the respiratory tract to permit systemic or local delivery of wide variety of therapeutic agents.

    <p num="3">The present invention relates generally to particles incorporating surfactants for use in drug delivery to the pulmonary system.</p>
    <p num="4">
      Biodegradable particles have been developed for the controlled-release and delivery of protein and peptide drugs.
      <br/>
      Langer, R., Science 249: 1527-1533 (1990).
      <br/>
      Examples include the use of biodegradable particles for gene therapy (Mulligan, R. C., Science, 260: 926-932 (1993)) and for `single-shot` immunization by vaccine delivery (Eldridge et al., Mol. Immunol., 28: 287-294 (1991)).

      Aerosols for the delivery of therapeutic agents to the respiratory tract have been developed.

      <br/>
      The respiratory tract encompasses the upper airways, including the oropharynx and larynx, followed by the lower airways, which include the trachea followed by bifurcations into the bronchi and bronchioli.
      <br/>
      The upper and lower airways are called the conducting airways.
      <br/>
      The terminal bronchioli then divide into respiratory bronchioli which then lead to the ultimate respiratory zone, the alveoli, or deep lung.
      <br/>
      Gonda, I. "Aerosols for delivery of therapeutic an diagnostic agents to the respiratory tract," in Critical Reviews in Therapeutic Drug Carrier Systems, 6:273-313 (1990).
      <br/>
      The deep lung, or alveoli, are the primary target of inhaled therapeutic aerosols for systemic drug delivery.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      Inhaled aerosols have been used for the treatment of local lung disorders including asthma and cystic fibrosis (Anderson et al., Am. Rev. Respir. Dis., 140: 1317-1324 (1989)) and have potential for the systemic delivery of peptides and proteins as well (Patton and Platz, Advanced Drug Delivery Reviews, 8:179-196 (1992)).
      <br/>
      However, pulmonary drug delivery of macromolecules; these include protein denaturation during aerosolization, excessive loss of inhaled drug in the oropharyngeal cavity (often exceeding 80%), poor control over the site of deposition, irreproducibility of therapeutic results owing to variations in breathing patterns, the often too-rapid absorption of drug potentially resulting in local toxic effects, and phagocytosis by lung macrophages.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      Considerable attention has been devoted to the design of therapeutic aerosol inhalers to improve the efficiency of inhalation therapies.
      <br/>

      Market, 4: 26-29 (1994).
      <br/>
      Attention has also been given to the design of dry powder aerosol surface texture, regarding particularly the need to avoid particle aggregation, a phenomenon which considerably diminishes the efficiency of inhalation therapies.
      <br/>
      French, D. L., Edwards, D. A. and Niven, R. W., J. Aerosol Sci., 27: 769-783 (1996).
      <br/>
      Dry powder formulations ("DPFs") with large particle size have improved flowability characteristics, such as less aggregation (Visser, J., Powder Technology 58: 1-10 (1989)), easier aerosolization, and potentially less phagocytosis.
      <br/>

      <br/>
      Dry powder aerosols for inhalation therapy are generally produced with mean diameters primarily in the range of &lt;5  MU m. Ganderton, D., J. Biopharmaceutical Sciences, 3:101-105 (1992); and Gonda, I. "Physico-Chemical Principles in Aerosol Delivery," in Topics in Pharmaceutical Sciences 1991, Crommelin, D. J. and K. K. Midha, Eds., Medpharm Scientific Publishers, Stuttgart, pp. 95-115, 1992.
      <br/>
      Large "carrier" particles (containing no drug) have been co-delivered with therapeutic aerosols to aid in achieving efficient aerosolization among other possible benefits.

      The human lungs can remove or rapidly degrade hydrolytically cleavable deposited aerosols over periods ranging from minutes to hours.
      <br/>
      In the upper airways, ciliated epithelia contribute to the "mucociliary escalator" by which particles are swept from the airways toward the mouth.

      In the deep lungs, alveolar macrophages are capable of phagocytosing particles soon after their deposition.

      <br/>
      As the diameter of particles exceeds 3  MU m, there is increasingly less phagocytosis by macrophages.

      <br/>
      However, increasing the particle size also has been found to minimize the probability of particles (possessing standard mass density) entering the airways and acini due to excessive deposition in the oropharyngeal or nasal regions.
      <br/>

      Local and systemic inhalation therapies can often benefit from a relatively slow controlled release of the therapeutic agent.
      <br/>
      Gonda, I., "Physico-chemical principles in aerosol delivery," in: Topics in Pharmaceutical Sciences 1991, D. J. A. Crommelin and K. K. Midha, Eds., Stuttgart: Medpharm Scientific Publishers, pp. 95-117 (1992).
      <br/>
      Slow release from a therapeutic aerosol can prolong the residence of an administered drug in the airways or acini, and diminish the rate of drug appearance in the bloodstream.
      <br/>
      Also, patient compliance is increased by reducing the frequency of dosing.

      Pulmonary drug delivery is an attractive alternative to oral, transdermal, and parenteral administration because self-administration is simple, the lungs provide a large mucosal surface for drug absorption, there is no first-pass liver effect of absorbed drugs, and there is reduced enzymatic activity and pH mediated drug degradation compared with the oral route.

      A primary concern with many aerosols is particulate aggregation caused by particle-particle interactions, such as hydrophobic, electrostatic, and capillary interactions.
      <br/>
      An effective dry-powder inhalation therapy for both short and long term release or therapeutics, either for local or systemic delivery, requires a powder that displays minimum aggregation, as well as a means of avoiding or suspending the lung's natural clearance mechanisms until drugs have been effectively delivered.

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="16">
      Particles incorporating a surfactant for pulmonary drug delivery are provided.
      <br/>
      In one embodiment, the particles are aerodynamically light, biodegradable particles, having a tap density less than about 0.4 g/cm3. The particles can be used for controlled systemic or local drug delivery to the respiratory tract via aerosolization.
      <br/>
      Administration of the low density particles to the lung by aerosolization permits deep lung delivery of relatively large diameter therapeutic aerosols, for example, greater than 5  MU m in mean diameter.
      <br/>
      The particles can be fabricated with a rough surface texture to reduce particle agglomeration and improve flowability of the powder.
      <br/>
      The particles incorporating a surfactant have improved aerosolization properties.
      <br/>
      The particle can be fabricated with features which enhance aerosolization via dry powder inhaler devices, and lead to lower deposition in the mouth, throat and inhaler device.
    </p>
    <p num="17">Surfactants</p>
    <p num="18">
      Surfactants which can be incorporated into particles to improve their aerosolization properties include phosphoglycerides.
      <br/>
      Exemplary phosphoglycerides include phosphatidylcholines, such as the naturally occurring lung surfactant, L- ALPHA -phosphatidylcholine dipalmitoyl ("DPPC").
      <br/>
      The surfactants advantageously improve surface properties by, for example, reducing particle-particle interactions, and can render the surface of the particles less adhesive.
      <br/>
      The use of surfactants endogenous to the lung may avoid the need for the use of non-physiologic surfactants.
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      As used herein, the term "surfactant" refers to any agent which preferentially absorbs to an interface between two immiscible phases, such as the interface between water and an organic polymer solution, a water/air interface or organic solvent/air interface.
      <br/>
      Surfactants generally possess a hydrophilic moiety and a lipophilic moiety, such that, upon absorbing to microparticles, they tend to present moieties to the external environment that do not attract similarly-coated particles, thus reducing particle agglomeration.
      <br/>
      Surfactants may also promote absorption of a drug and increase bioavailability of the drug.
    </p>
    <p num="20">
      As used herein, a particle "incorporating a surfactant" refers to a particle with a surfactant on at least the surface of the particle.
      <br/>
      The surfactant may be incorporated throughout the particle and on the surface during particle formation, or may be coated on the particle after particle formation.
      <br/>
      The surfactant can be coated on the particle surface by adsorption, ionic or covalent attachment, or physically "entrapped" by the surrounding matrix.
      <br/>
      The surfactant can be, for example, incorporated into controlled release particles, such as polymeric microspheres.
    </p>
    <p num="21">
      Providing a surfactant on the surfaces of the particles can reduce the tendency of the particles to agglomerate due to interactions such as electrostatic interactions, Van der Waals forces, and capillary action.
      <br/>
      The presence of the surfactant on the particle surface can provide increased surface rugosity (roughness), thereby improving aerosolization by reducing the surface area available for intimate particle-particle interaction.
      <br/>
      The use of a surfactant which is a natural material of the lung can potentially reduce opsonization (and thereby reducing phagocytosis by alveolar macrophages), thus providing a longer-lived controlled release particle in the lung.
    </p>
    <p num="22">
      Surfactants known in the art can be used including any naturally occurring lung surfactant.
      <br/>
      Other exemplary surfactants include diphosphatidyl glycerol (DPPG); hexadecanol; fatty alcohols such as polyethylene glycol (PEG); polyoxyethylene-9-lauryl ether; a surface active fatty acid, such as palmitic acid or oleic acid; sorbitan trioleate (Span 85); glycocholate; surfactin; a poloxomer; a sorbitan fatty acid ester such as sorbitan trioleate; tyloxapol and a phospholipid.
    </p>
    <p num="23">Particle Materials</p>
    <p num="24">
      The particles preferably are biodegradable and biocompatible, and optionally are capable of biodegrading at a controlled rate for delivery of a drug.
      <br/>
      The particles can be made of a variety of materials.
      <br/>
      Preferably, the particles are "aerodynamically light particles", which as used herein, refers to particles having a tap density less than about 0.4 g/cm3. Both inorganic and organic materials can be used.
      <br/>
      For example, ceramics may be used.
      <br/>
      Polymeric and non-polymeric materials, such as fatty acids, may be used to form aerodynamically light particles.
      <br/>
      Optionally the particles may be formed of the surfactant plus a therapeutic or diagnostic agent.
      <br/>
      Different properties of the particle which can contribute to the aerodynamic lightness include the composition forming the particle, and the presence of irregular surface structure, or pores or cavities within the particle.
    </p>
    <p num="25">Polymeric Particles</p>
    <p num="26">
      Polymeric particles may be formed from any biocompatible and preferably biodegradable polymer, copolymer, or blend.
      <br/>
      Preferred particles are those which are capable of forming aerodynamically light particles having a tap density less than about 0.4 g/cm3.
    </p>
    <p num="27">
      Surface eroding polymers such as polyanhydrides may be used to form the particles.
      <br/>
      For example, polyanhydrides such as poly�(p-carboxyphenoxy)-hexane anhydride� (PCPH) may be used.
      <br/>
      Biodegradable polyanhydrides are described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,857,311, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.
    </p>
    <p num="28">
      In another embodiment, bulk eroding polymers such as those based on polyesters including poly(hydroxy acids) can be used.
      <br/>
      For example, polyglycolic acid (PGA), polylactic acid (PLA), or copolymers thereof may be used to form the particles.
      <br/>
      The polyester may also have a charged or functionalizable group, such as an amino acid.
      <br/>
      In a preferred embodiment, particles with controlled release properties can be formed of poly(D,L-lactic acid) and/or poly(D,L-lactic-co-glycolic acid) ("PLGA") which incorporate a surfactant such as DPPC.
    </p>
    <p num="29">
      Other polymers include polyamides, polycarbonates, polyalkylenes such as polyethylene, polypropylene, poly (ethylene glycol), poly(ethylene oxide), poly(ethylene terephthalate), poly vinyl compounds such as polyvinyl alcohols, polyvinyl ethers, and polyvinyl esters, polymers of acrylic and methacrylic acids, celluloses and other polysaccharides, and peptides or proteins, or copolymers or blends thereof.
      <br/>
      Polymers may be selected with or modified to have the appropriate stability and degradation rates in vivo for different controlled drug delivery applications.
    </p>
    <p num="30">In one embodiment, aerodynamically light particles are formed from functionalized polyester graft copolymers, as described in Hrkach et al., Macromolecules, 28:4736-4739 (1995); and Hrkach et al., "Poly(L-Lactic acid-co-amino acid) Graft Copolymers: A Class of Functional Biodegradable Biomaterials" in Hydrogels and Biodegradable Polymers for Bioapplications, ACS Symposium Series No. 627, Raphael M. Ottenbrite et al., Eds., American Chemical Society, Chapter 8, pp. 93-101, 1996.</p>
    <p num="31">Other Particle Materials</p>
    <p num="32">
      Materials other than biodegradable polymers may be used to form the particles including other polymers and various excipients.
      <br/>
      The particles also may be formed of the drug or diagnostic agent and surfactant alone.
      <br/>
      In one embodiment, the particles may be formed of the surfactant and include a therapeutic agent, to improve aerosolization efficiency due to reduced particle surface interactions, and to potentially reduce drug loss due to phagocytosis by alveolar macrophages.
    </p>
    <p num="33">
      Other materials include, but are not limited to, gelatin, polyethylene glycol, trehalose, and dextran.
      <br/>
      Particles with degradation and release times ranging from seconds to months can be designed and fabricated, based on factors such as the particle material.
    </p>
    <p num="34">The polymers may be tailored to optimize different characteristics of the particle including: i) interactions between the agent to be delivered and the polymer to provide stabilization of the agent and retention of activity upon delivery; ii) rate of polymer degradation and, thereby, rate of drug release profiles; iii) surface characteristics and targeting capabilities via chemical modification; and iv) particle porosity.</p>
    <p num="35">Formation of Polymeric Particles</p>
    <p num="36">
      Polymeric particles may be prepared using single and double emulsion solvent evaporation, spray drying, solvent extraction, solvent evaporation, phase separation, simple and complex coacervation, interfacial polymerization, and other methods well known to those of ordinary skill in the art.
      <br/>
      Particles may be made using methods for making microspheres or microcapsules known in the art.
    </p>
    <p num="37">
      Methods developed for making microspheres for drug delivery are described in the literature, for example, as described in Doubrow, M., Ed., "Microcapsules and Nanoparticles in Medicine and Pharmacy," CRC Press, Boca Raton, 1992.
      <br/>
      Methods also are described in Mathiowitz and Langer, J. Controlled Release 5,13-22 (1987); Mathiowitz et al., Reactive Polymers 6, 275-283 (1987); Mathiowitz et al., J. Appl. Polymer Sci. 35, 755-774 (1988), the teachings of which are incorporated herein.
      <br/>
      The selection of the method depends on the polymer selection, the size, external morphology, and crystallinity that is desired, as described, for example, by Mathiowitz et al., Scanning Microscopy 4: 329-340 (1990); Mathiowitz et al., J. Appl. Polymer Sci. 45, 125-134 (1992); and Benita et al., J. Pharm. Sci. 73, 1721-1724 (1984), the teachings of which are incorporated herein.
    </p>
    <p num="38">
      In solvent evaporation, described for example, in Mathiowitz et al., (1990), Benita; and U.S. Pat. No. 4,272,398 to Jaffe, the polymer is dissolved in a volatile organic solvent, such as methylene chloride.
      <br/>
      Several different polymer concentrations can be used, for example, between 0.05 and 1.0 g/ml. The drug, either in soluble form or dispersed as fine particles, is added to the polymer solution, and the mixture is suspended in an aqueous phase that contains a surface active agent such as poly(vinyl alcohol).
      <br/>
      The aqueous phase may be, for example, a concentration of 1% poly(vinyl alcohol) w/v in distilled water.
      <br/>
      The resulting emulsion is stirred until most of the organic solvent evaporates, leaving solid microspheres, which may be washed with water and dried overnight in a lyophilizer.
      <br/>
      Microspheres with different sizes (1-1000 microns) and morphologies can be obtained by this method.
    </p>
    <p num="39">
      Solvent removal was primarily designed for use with less stable polymers, such as the polyanhydrides.
      <br/>
      In this method, the drug is dispersed or dissolved in a solution of a selected polymer in a volatile organic solvent like methylene chloride.
      <br/>
      The mixture is then suspended in oil, such as silicon oil, by stirring, to form an emulsion.
      <br/>
      Within 24 hours, the solvent diffuses into the oil phase and the emulsion droplets harden into solid polymer microspheres.
      <br/>
      Unlike the hot-melt microencapsulation method described for example in Mathiowitz et al., Reactive Polymers, 6:275 (1987), this method can be used to make microspheres from polymers with high melting points and a wide range of molecular weights.
      <br/>
      Microspheres having a diameter for example between one and 300 microns can be obtained with this procedure.
    </p>
    <p num="40">Aerodynamically Light Particles</p>
    <p num="41">Aerodynamically light particles, having a tap density less than about 0.4 g/cm3, may be fabricated, as described in U.S. Ser. No. .�.08/655,570,.�.  08/739,308, filed Oct. 29, 1996, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein.</p>
    <p num="42">Aerodynamically Light Particle Size</p>
    <p num="43">
      The mass mean diameter of the particles can be measured using a Coulter Multisizer II (Coulter Electronics, Luton, Beds, England).
      <br/>
      The aerodynamically light particles in one preferred embodiment are at least about 5 microns in diameter.
      <br/>
      The diameter of particles in a sample will range depending upon factors such as particle composition and methods of synthesis.
      <br/>
      The distribution of size of particles in a sample can be selected to permit optimal deposition within targeted sites within the respiratory tract.
    </p>
    <p num="44">
      The aerodynamically light particles may be fabricated or separated, for example by filtration or centrifugation, to provide a particle sample with a preselected size distribution.
      <br/>
      For example, greater than 30%, 50%, 70%, or 80% of the particles in a sample can have a diameter within a selected range of at least 5  MU m. The selected range within which a certain percentage of the particles must fall may be for example, between about 5 and 30  MU m, or optionally between 5 and 15  MU m. In one preferred embodiment, at least a portion of the particles have a diameter between about 9 and 11  MU m. Optionally, the particle sample also can be fabricated wherein at least 90%, or optionally 95% or 99%, have a diameter within the selected range.
      <br/>
      The presence of the higher proportion of the aerodynamically light, larger diameter (at least about 5  MU m) particles in the particle sample enhances the delivery of therapeutic or diagnostic agents incorporated therein to the deep lung.
    </p>
    <p num="45">
      In one embodiment, in the particle sample, the interquartile range may be 2  MU m, with a mean diameter for example, between about 7.5 and 13.5  MU m. Thus, for example, between at least 30% and 40% of the particles may have diameters within the selected range.
      <br/>
      Preferably, the percentages of particles have diameters within a 1  MU m range, for example, 6.0-7.0  MU m, 10.0-11.0  MU m or 13.0-14.0  MU m.
    </p>
    <p num="46">
      The aerodynamically light particles incorporating a therapeutic drug, and having a tap density less than about 0.4 g/cm3, with mean diameters of at least about 5  MU m, are more capable of escaping inertial and gravitational deposition in the oropharyngeal region, and are targeted to the airways or the deep lung.
      <br/>
      The use of larger particles (mean diameter at least about 5  MU m) is advantageous since they are able to aerosolize more efficiently than smaller, non-light aerosol particles such as those currently used for inhalation therapies.
    </p>
    <p num="47">
      In comparison to smaller non-light particles, the larger (at least 5  MU m) aerodynamically light particles also can potentially more successfully avoid phagocytic engulfment by alveolar macrophages and clearance from the lungs, due to size exclusion of the particles from the phagocytes' cytosolic space.
      <br/>
      Phagocytosis of particles by alveolar macrophages diminishes precipitously as particle diameter increases beyond 3  MU m. Kawaguchi, H. et al., Biomatetials 7: 61-66 (1986); Krenis, L. J. and Strauss, B., Proc. Soc. Exp. Med., 107:748-750 (1961); and Rudt, S. and Muller, R. H., J. Contr. Rel., 22: 263-272 (1992).
      <br/>
      For particles of statistically isotropic shape, such as spheres with rough surfaces, the particle envelope volume is approximately equivalent to the volume of cytosolic space required within a macrophage for complete particle phagocytosis.
    </p>
    <p num="48">
      Aerodynamically light particles thus are capable of a longer term release of a therapeutic agent in the lungs.
      <br/>
      Following inhalation, aerodynamically light biodegradable particles can deposit in the lungs (due to their relatively low tap density), and subsequently undergo slow degradation and drug release, without the majority of the particles being phagocytosed by alveolar macrophages.
      <br/>
      The drug can be delivered relatively slowly into the alveolar fluid, and at a controlled rate into the blood stream, minimizing possible toxic responses of exposed cells to an excessively high concentration of the drug.
      <br/>
      The aerodynamically light particles thus are highly suitable for inhalation therapies, particularly in controlled release applications.
    </p>
    <p num="49">
      The preferred mean diameter for aerodynamically light particles for inhalation is at least about 5  MU m, for example between about 5 and 30  MU m. The particles may be fabricated with the appropriate material, surface roughness, diameter and tap density for localized delivery to selected regions of the respiratory tract such as the deep lung or upper airways.
      <br/>
      For example, higher density or larger particles may be used for upper airway delivery, or a mixture of different sized particles in a sample, provided with the same or different therapeutic agent may be administered to target different regions of the lung in one administration.
    </p>
    <p num="50">Density and Deposition of Aerodynamically Light Particles</p>
    <p num="51">
      As used herein, the phrase "aerodynamically light particles" refers to particles having a tap density less than about 0.4 g/cm3. The tap density of particles of a dry powder may be obtained using a GeoPyc (tm)  (Micrometrics Instrument Corp., Norcross, Ga. 30093).
      <br/>
      Tap density is a standard measure of the envelope mass density.
      <br/>
      The envelope mass density of an isotropic particle is defined as the mass of the particle divided by the minimum sphere envelope volume within which it can be enclosed.
      <br/>
      Features which can contribute to low tap density include irregular surface texture and porous structure.
    </p>
    <p num="52">
      Inertial impaction and gravitational settling of aerosols are predominant deposition mechanisms in the airways and acini of the lungs during normal breathing conditions.
      <br/>
      Edwards, D. A., J. Aerosol Sci., 26: 293-317 (1995).
      <br/>
      The importance of both deposition mechanisms increases in proportion to the mass of aerosols and not to particle (or envelope) volume.
      <br/>
      Since the site of aerosol deposition in the lungs is determined by the mass of the aerosol (at least for particles of mean aerodynamic diameter greater than approximately 1  MU m), diminishing the tap density by increasing particle surface irregularities and particle porosity permits the delivery of larger particle envelope volumes into the lungs, all other physical parameters being equal.
    </p>
    <p num="53">
      The low tap density particles have a small aerodynamic diameter in comparison to the actual envelope sphere diameter.
      <br/>
      The aerodynamic diameter, daer, is related to the envelope sphere diameter, d (Gonda, I., "Physico-chemical principles in aerosol delivery," in Topics in Pharmaceutical Sciences 1991 (eds. D. J. A. Crommelin and K. K. Midha), pp. 95-117, Stuttgart: Medpharm Scientific Publishers, 1992)), by the formula:  (Equation image '1' not included in text)

    <p num="54">
      where the envelope mass  RHO  is in units of g/cm3.
      <br/>
      Maximal deposition of monodisperse aerosol particles in the alveolar region of the human lung (.about.60%) occurs for an aerodynamic diameter of approximately daer =3  MU m. Heyder, J. et al., J. Aerosol Sci., 17: 811-825 (1986).
      <br/>
      Due to their small envelope mass density, the actual diameter d of aerodynamically light particles comprising a monodisperse inhaled powder that will exhibit maximum deep-lung deposition is:  (Equation image '2' not included in text)
    </p>
    <p num="55">
      where d is always greater than 3  MU m. For example, aerodynamically light particles that display an envelope mass density,  RHO =0.1 g/cm3, will exhibit a maximum deposition for particles having envelope diameters as large as 9.5  MU m. The increased particle size diminishes interparticle adhesion forces.
      <br/>
      Visser, J., Powder Technology, 58:1-10.
      <br/>
      Thus, large particle size increases efficiency of aerosolization to the deep lung for particles of low envelope mass density, in addition to contributing to lower phagocytic losses.

    <p num="56">Targeting of Particles</p>
    <p num="57">
      Targeting molecules can be attached to the particles via reactive functional groups on the particles.
      <br/>
      For example, targeting molecules can be attached to the amino acid groups of functionalized polyester graft copolymer particles, such as PLAL-Lys particles.
      <br/>
      Targeting molecules permit binding interaction of the particle with specific receptor sites, such as those within the lungs.
      <br/>
      The particles can be targeted by attachment of ligands which specifically or non-specifically bind to particular targets.
      <br/>
      Exemplary targeting molecules include antibodies and fragments thereof including the variable regions, lectins, and hormones or other organic molecules capable of specific binding, for example, to receptors on the surfaces of the target cells.
    </p>
    <p num="58">Therapeutic Agents</p>
    <p num="59">
      Any of a variety of therapeutic, prophylactic or diagnostic agents can be incorporated within the particles, or used to prepare particles consisting solely of the agent and surfactant.
      <br/>
      The particles can be used to locally or systemically deliver a variety of therapeutic agents to an animal.
      <br/>
      Examples include synthetic inorganic and organic compounds, proteins and peptides, polysaccharides and other sugars, lipids, and DNA and RNA nucleic acid sequences having therapeutic, prophylactic or diagnostic activities.
      <br/>
      Nucleic acid sequences include genes, antisense molecules which bind to complementary DNA to inhibit transcription, and ribozymes.
      <br/>
      The agents to be incorporated can have a variety of biological activities, such as vasoactive agents, neuroactive agents, hormones, anticoagulants, immunomodulating agents, cytotoxic agents, prophylactic agents, antibiotics, antivirals, antisense, antigens, and antibodies.
      <br/>
      In some instances, the proteins may be antibodies or antigens which otherwise would have to be administered by injection to elicit an appropriate response.
      <br/>
      Compounds with a wide range of molecular weight can be encapsulated, for example, between 100 and 500,000 grams or more per mole.
    </p>
    <p num="60">
      Proteins are defined as consisting of 100 amino acid residues or more; peptides are less than 100 amino acid residues.
      <br/>
      Unless otherwise stated, the term protein refers to both proteins and peptides.
      <br/>
      Examples include insulin and other hormones.
      <br/>
      Polysaccharides, such as heparin, can also be administered.
    </p>
    <p num="61">
      The polymeric aerosols are useful as carriers for a variety of inhalation therapies.
      <br/>
      They can be used to encapsulate small and large drugs, release encapsulated drugs over time periods ranging from hours to months, and withstand extreme conditions during aerosolization or following deposition in the lungs that might otherwise harm the encapsulated therapeutic.
    </p>
    <p num="62">
      The particles may include a therapeutic agent for local delivery within the lung, such as agents for the treatment of asthma, emphysema, or cystic fibrosis, or for systemic treatment.
      <br/>
      For example, genes for the treatment of diseases such as cystic fibrosis can be administered, as can beta agonists for asthma.
      <br/>
      Other specific therapeutic agents include, but are not limited to, insulin, calcitonin, leuprolide (or gonadotropin-releasing hormone ("LHRH")), granulocyte colony-stimulating factor ("G-CSF"), parathyroid hormone-related peptide, somatostatin, testosterone, progesterone, estradiol, nicotine, fentanyl, norethisterone, clonidine, scopolomine, salicylate, cromolyn sodium, salmeterol, formeterol, albuterol, and vallium.
    </p>
    <p num="63">Administration</p>
    <p num="64">
      The particles incorporating a surfactant and a therapeutic agent may be administered alone or in any appropriate pharmaceutical carrier, such as a liquid, for example saline, or a powder, for administration to the respiratory system.
      <br/>
      They can be co-delivered with larger carrier particles, not including a therapeutic agent, the latter possessing mass mean diameters for example in the range 50  MU m-100  MU m.

    <p num="65">Aerosol dosage, formulations and delivery systems may be selected for a particular therapeutic application, as described, for example, in Gonda, I. "Aerosols for delivery of therapeutic and diagnostic agents to the respiratory tract," in Critical Reviews in Therapeutic Drug Carrier Systems, 6:273-313, 1990; and in Moren, "Aerosol dosage forms and formulations," in: Aerosols in Medicine, Principles, Diagnosis and Therapy, Moren, et al., Eds. Esevier, Amsterdam, 1985, the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference.</p>
    <p num="66">
      The greater efficiency of aerosolization by particles incorporating a surfactant permits more drug to be delivered.
      <br/>
      The use of biodegradable polymers permits controlled release in the lungs and long-time local action or systemic bioavailability.
      <br/>
      Denaturation of macromolecular drugs can be minimized during aerosolization since macromolecules are contained and protected within a polymeric shell.
      <br/>
      Coencapsulation of peptides with peptidase-inhibitors can minimize peptide enzymatic degradation.
      <br/>
      Pulmonary delivery advantageously can eliminate the need for injection.
      <br/>
      For example, the requirement for daily insulin injections can be avoided.

      Scanning electron microscopy "SEM" photographs showing surface morphology of microspheres (MS) made by the double emulsion process with and without the lung surfactant, DPPC were obtained.
      <br/>
      By SEM, the microspheres made with and without DPPC by the double emulsion process had very similar surface characteristics and size distribution, as confirmed by size distribution measurements, shown below in Table 1.

      Particles made by double emulsion with DPPC are easily resuspended in aqueous solution after lyophilization and are lump-free when dry as determined by light microscopy.

      Particles made by the double emulsion process without DPPC resuspend easily, however, they appear somewhat agglomerated when dry by light microscopy.

      Using the concept of aerodynamic diameter (Gonda, I., in Topics in Pharmaceutical Sciences 1991, D. Crommelin and K. Midha, Editors, Stuttgart: Medpharm Scientific Publishers, pp. 95-117 (1992)), it is possible to determine the size range of the microspheres which are theoretically respirable given their mass density,  RHO MS.
      <br/>
      Specifically, it can be shown below in Equation 2 that:  (Equation image '3' not included in text)
    </p>
    <p num="119">
      where dresp corresponds to the diameter of particles (in  MU m) theoretically able to enter and remain in the airways without inertial or gravitational deposition (particles smaller than this range are exhaled), and where  RHO MS is in units of g/cc.
      <br/>
      The theoretical respirable size range of the microspheres also is shown in Table 2.
      <br/>
      The optimal size range (i.e., dresp) for a non-porous PLGA 50:50 microsphere is 0.69-4.05  MU m (Table 2).
      <br/>
      The optimal respirable size range for microspheres without DPPC is 1.3-7.7  MU m and, for microspheres with DPPC, 1.46-8.58  MU m (Table 2).
      <br/>
      The upper limit on size of respirable particles is increased from 4.05 to greater than 8.5  MU m when DPPC is used in the PLGA microsphere preparation.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the use of low density DPPC microspheres allows the use of larger particles for aerosolization, which may have advantages for drug delivery, such as less particle-particle interaction due to decreased surface area to volume ratio, and lower susceptibility to phagocytosis by alveolar macrophages.
      <br/>
      In addition, a primary effect of DPPC is to render the particles less adhesive and therefore allow improved aerosolization, as demonstrated below.
    </p>
    <p num="120">
      FIGS. 1 and 2 show the results of an in vitro aerosolization of the PLGA microspheres made by a double emulsion process with and without DPPC.
      <br/>
      The microspheres were aerosolized as a dry powder released from a Spinhaler.RTM. dry powder inhaler (DPI).
      <br/>
      FIG. 1 illustrates the mass-fraction of the initial dose that is released from the dry powder inhaler device (DPI Efficiency) using an Andersen Mark I Cascade Impactor.
      <br/>
      DPI efficiencies approaching 80% were obtained with microspheres made with and without DPPC.
      <br/>
      Although the DPI efficiencies for the two batches were nearly the same, a great difference can be seen between microspheres made with and without DPPC when their deposition within the cascade impactor is observed (FIG. 2).
    </p>
    <p num="121">
      FIG. 2 shows the mass fraction of aerosolized particles that is deposited in stages 2 through Filter (2-Filter) of the Andersen cascade impactor, considered the stages corresponding to the respirable fraction of the microspheres.
      <br/>
      Stages 0 and 1 correspond roughly to the mouth and throat, and to the upper airways of the lung, respectively.
      <br/>
      Stages 2-F correspond to successively deeper fractions of the lung.
      <br/>
      It can be seen that a much greater percentage of microspheres make it to the latter stages of the impactor (considered deeper portions of the lungs) when DPPC is used in their preparation.
      <br/>
      Overall, greater than 35% (37 0 (slashed zero) +-.2.1) of aerosolized particles made with DPPC are considered respirable compared with 13.2 +- 2.9% without DPPC, as shown in Table 3.
      <br/>
      The large difference in respirable fraction between the DPPC and non-DPPC particles is at least in part attributed to reduced particle-particle interaction due to the use of DPPC.
    </p>
    <p num="122">
      In order to estimate the theoretical respirable fraction (RF) of the microspheres, and compare it with experimentally measured in vitro and in vivo RF's, size distribution measurements were analyzed to determine the percentage of particles (by mass) of each type (DPPC and non-DPPC) that were within the theoretical respirable size range (i.e., dresp Table 2).
      <br/>
      As shown in Table 3, a higher percentage of particles made with DPPC are expected to be respirable compared with non-DPPC particles (63 to 51%, respectively).
      <br/>
      This theoretical respirable fraction is based on the mass fraction of microspheres with diameters in the respirable size range, dresp as defined by Eq. (2), and therefore takes into account the different sizes and densities of the two batches of microspheres.

      To determine whether agglomeration forces during particle aerosolization from the Spinhaler device might be playing a role even after the particles enter the impactor system (i.e., primarily non-DPC particles remain agglomerated in the inspired stream, resulting in deposition in the first two impactor stages: stages 0 and 1), in vivo aerosolization experiments were performed in which particles were permitted to fall by gravity into the inspiration stream of a Harvard ventilator system joined with the trachea of an anesthetized rate.
      <br/>
      In this model, approximately 63% of the inhaled DPPC-PLGA particles deposit in the airways and distal lung regions, whereas 57% of the non-DPPC particles are able to penetrate beyond the trachea in the lungs.
      <br/>
      These respirable fractions are much nearer to the predicted respirable fractions based upon particle diameter and mass density (Table 3).
    </p>
    <p num="125">
      Particle aggregation thus is less with DPPC-containing PLGA particles than without DPPC, even though the particles are of similar size and surface morphological features.
      <br/>
      The use of DPPC thus appears to reduce interparticle attractions, such as van der Waals and electrostatic attractions.
      <br/>
      It is also possible that the presence of DPPC reduces moisture absorption which may cause particle-particle interaction by capillary forces.
    </p>
    <p num="126">
      In addition to the biocompatibility features of DPPC and improvement of surface properties of microspheres for aerosolization, it is possible that the release of DPPC from the slow-eroding PLGA microspheres in the alveolar region of the lungs can more effectively insure the maintenance of normal surfactant fluid composition thereby minimizing the possibility of local toxic side effects.
      <br/>
      The alveolar surfactant fluid layer is, on average, 10 nm thick (Weibel, E. R., Morphometry of the Human Lung, New York: Academic Press (1963).

      Aerosolization properties of the microspheres also were examined, as shown in Table 5.
      <br/>
      Microspheres made by spray drying with and without DPPC have similar size distributions (Table 5) and mass densities (0.49.+- 0 (slashed zero) 04 g/cc).
      <br/>
      However, the aerosolization performance of spray-dried aerosols made with and without DPPC is markedly different.
      <br/>
      FIG. 3 shows that the fraction of low-molecular-weight PLGA RG503 microparticles that are aerosolized from the dry powder inhaler (i.e., the % of particles that leave the DPI upon simulated inhalation, defined as the DPI Efficiency) is 70.4% when the particles are made with DPPC compared with only 46.8% for particles made without DPPC.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, the deposition of all types of polymer microparticles following aerosolization into an Andersen impactor is greatly improved using DPPC-coated particles (Table 5).
      <br/>
      Without the use of DPPC,  &lt;= 2% of the particles aerosolized reach the latter stages of the impactor (those corresponding to the respirable fraction, stages 2-Filter).
      <br/>
      On the other hand, a maximum of 25.6% of DPPC-coated microspheres reach stages 2-Filter, as shown in FIG. 4.
      <br/>
      Higher respirable fractions may be obtained with particles that contain low molecular weight drugs that are soluble in methylene chloride and therefore do not require the use of water during their preparation.
