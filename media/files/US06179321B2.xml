      <br/>
      A combined handrail-and-frame structure of a baby stroller includes an assembly and an engaging seat wherein the assembly 8 includes an inner seat, a first fastener, a second fastener, a spring, and a housing.
      <br/>
      A hook with a lead inclined surface is provided in each of the first and second fasteners, and a convex push button is provided at the top of the second fastener.
      <br/>
      Moreover, a positioning head having an engaging fork is provided at an end of the assembly, and a spring installed in between the first and the second fasteners is also provided.
      <br/>
      In addition, a slit for clipping the engaging fork and an opening having a first and a second edge is provided in the engaging seat to be hooked up by the hooks for positioning the engaging fork in horizontal and vertical directions.
      <br/>
      When it comes to detaching, the push button is press to compress the spring, and the two hooks will be unlocked such that the assembly can be separated from the engaging seat.

    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="1">
      1.
      <br/>
      Field of Invention
    </p>
    <p num="2">The invention relates to a handrail of a baby stroller, and more particularly to a combined handrail-and-frame structure of a baby stroller.</p>
    <p num="3">2. Related Art</p>
    <p num="4">
      Shown in FIG. 1 and FIG. 2 are isometric views of the combined handrail-and-frame structures of a conventional baby stroller.
      <br/>
      As shown in FIG. 1 and FIG. 2, the conventional baby stroller includes a main body 11 and a clip 12.
      <br/>
      Both an end of the main body 11 and the clip 12 itself appear a half-tube in shape.
      <br/>
      They are both pivotally connected to the frame 14 of the stroller to form a sleeve that is fitted around the circumference of the frame 14.
      <br/>
      The other end of the main body 11 is connected to the handrail 13.
      <br/>
      Moreover, a fin 121 positioned at a side and on the outer surface of the clip 12 is provided as a handle for pushing and pulling the slip with respect to the pivot for opening and positioning.
      <br/>
      The detaching and attaching the "main body 11 and clip 12" from and to the frame need to open and close the fin 121, thereby, it is very inconvenient.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      But since the connection between the slip 12 and the frame 14 relies only on the shrink fitting by making use of the resilient nature of the slip 12 itself, the clip structure 12 can not ensure positive positioning action.
      <br/>
      Moreover, the protruded appearance of the fin 121 not only causes inconvenience but also shows bad aesthetic perception.
    </p>

      The housing 6 includes a first end 60 and a second end 68.
      <br/>
      The first end 61 of the housing 6 is an open end while the second end 62 is connected to a tube-connecting handrail 81.
      <br/>
      The open end 61 (the first end 60) of the housing 6 is slipped on the inner seat 2 which contains the first fastener 3 and a second fastener 4.
      <br/>
      An opening 63 is provided at the top portion of the housing 6 for accommodating the convex push button 45.
      <br/>
      In addition, mounting holes 66, 65, 64 are provided on the two side surfaces of the housing 6 corresponding to the first pivoting hole 24, the second pivoting hole 25, and the through hole 27 respectively.

      <br/>
      An opening 75 at the vertical surface 72 and a slit 76 in the engaging portion 73 are provided wherein the opening 75 and the engaging portion 73 are internally connected.
      <br/>
      The opening 75 includes a first edge 77 and a second edge 78 for the hook 34 and 41 respectively to be hooked up.
      <br/>
      The tube-connecting portion 74 is to be inserted by the frame 82 and is tightened up by rivet pin 94 while the slit 76 is for clipping the 261 for holding the engaging fork 261 in horizontal direction.
      <br/>
      In addition, a rivet hole 79 with a rivet pin 94 is also provided on the side surfaces 71 wherein the rivet pin 94 is also functioned as positioning member to be hooked up by the engaging fork 261.
    </p>
    <p num="17">
      When it comes to assembling, the first fastener 3 is first put in the containing space 23 of the inner seat 2 such that the pivoting hole 31 is aligned with the second pivoting hole 25.
      <br/>
      Then, the second fastener 4 is put in the containing space 23 and seated on the top of the first fastener 3 having the convex portion 43 contacting the top surface of the second section 37 such that the pivoting hole 42 is aligned with the first pivoting hole 24.
      <br/>
      The hook 41 is exposed up from the inside of the inner seat 2 through the rectangular window 30.
      <br/>
      In addition, a spring 5 is mounted between the first fastener 3 at the stub 35 and the second fastener 4 at the stub 44.
      <br/>
      Then, the open end 61 (the first end 60) of the housing 6 is slipped on the inner seat 2 that contains the first fastener 3 and a second fastener 4 such that the convex push button 45 is exposed through the opening 63.
      <br/>
      A rivet pin 93 is employed to insert through the mounting hole 64 and the through hole 27.
      <br/>
      A rivet pin 92 is employed to insert through the mounting hole 65, the second pivoting hole 25, and the pivoting hole 31.
      <br/>
      Also, a rivet pin 91 is employed to insert through the mounting hole 66, the first pivoting hole 24, and the pivoting hole 42.
      <br/>
      In this way, the first fastener 3, the second fastener 4, the inner seat 2, and the housing 6 are riveted together by the rivet pins 93, 92, and 91.
      <br/>
      Finally, the whole assembly 8 is engaged with the engaging seat 7 by inserting into the first opening 75.
      <br/>
      As the assembly 8 is inserted into the first opening of the engaging seat 7, the engaging fork 261 of the positioning head 26 is hooked up to the rivet 94 for vertical positioning.
      <br/>
      And the hook 34 and hook 41 are locked up to the first edge 77 and second edge 78 respectively.

      FIG. 5 is an assembled cross-sectional view of the combined handrail-and-frame structures of baby stroller in detaching condition according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention.
      <br/>
      As shown in FIG. 5, when it comes to detaching the "assembly 8" from the "engaging seat 7", one can unlock the hooks 41 and 34 by pressing the "convex push button 45".
      <br/>
      As the "convex push button 45" is pressed, the second fastener 4 is rotated with respect to the hinge at the pivoting hole 42 in counter-clockwise direction to unlock the hook 41 from the second edge 78 of the first opening 75 of the "engaging seat 7".
      <br/>
      In the meantime, the second section 33 of the first fastener 3 is pushed down by the convex portion 43 of the second fastener 4 to rotate with respect to the hinge at the pivoting hole 31 in clockwise direction.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the first fastener 3 presses against the spring 5 to unlock the hook 34 from the second edge 78 of the first opening 75 of the "engaging seat 7".
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      As shown in FIG. 5, when it comes to attaching the "assembly 8" to the "engaging seat 7", the first end 10 of the inner seat 2 is pushed to insert into the slit 76 and is hooked up to the rivet pin 94.
      <br/>
      In the meantime, the hooks 34 and 41 are snapped in to hook up to the first and second edges 77, 78 at the first opening 75 of the engaging seat 7.
      <br/>
      This snap-in action is through the sliding of the inclined lead surfaces 341, 411 at the first and second edges 77, 78 respectively.
      <br/>
      And the spring 5 is first compressed to make the hooks 34 and 41 get in the first opening 75 then released to let hooks 34 and 41 hook up to the first and second edges 77, 78.
    </p>
    <p num="20">To summarize the foregoing statement, the combined handrail-and-frame structures of baby stroller of the present invention has the following advantages:</p>
    <p num="21">
      1.
      <br/>
      The locked up action of the hooks is positive and stable.
      <br/>
      2. The positioning head together with the engaging seat can provide vertical and horizontal positioning.
      <br/>
      3. The attaching and detaching operations are quick and convenient.
      <br/>
      4. The good aesthetic perception of the invention without any convex part in the outer appearance can improve the quality level of the product.
