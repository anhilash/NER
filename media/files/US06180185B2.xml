      An apparatus for forming a film on a substrate includes a gas inlet and an insert attached to the gas inlet, the insert including a deposition source material such as lithium.
      <br/>
      To form the film on the substrate, the substrate is mounted in a vacuum chamber.
      <br/>
      After the vacuum chamber is pumped down to a subatmospheric pressure, a first process gas such as argon is provided through the gas inlet and insert and into a plasma region proximate the substrate.
      <br/>
      Power is then coupled to generate a plasma inside of the insert which heats the insert and causes the deposition source material to vaporize.
      <br/>
      The deposition source material vapor is mixed with a plasma polymerizable material in the plasma region proximate the substrate causing a plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) thin film such as silicon oxide including the deposition source material (e.g. lithium) to be deposited on the substrate.

    <heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">The present invention relates generally to thin film processing and in particular to a method and apparatus for depositing a thin film onto a substrate.</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="3">
      In recent years there has been great interest in the formation of metal doped polymer films.
      <br/>
      For example, it has been found that a thin-film coating having a desired color can be readily obtained by introducing metallic particulates into a plasma formed polymer.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      Wielonski et al., U.S. Pat. No. 4,422,915 (hereinafter Wielonski), herein incorporated by reference, discloses a method of forming a colored polymeric film-like coating.
      <br/>
      The film-like coating is formed by depositing a plasma-formed polymer concurrently with particulates.
      <br/>
      In particular, Wielonski teaches that a plasma-polymerizable material is introduced into an electrical discharge region causing the plasma-formed polymer to be deposited.
      <br/>
      Concurrent with the formation of the plasma-formed polymer, the particulates are provided.
    </p>
    <p num="5">For providing the particulates, referring now to FIGS. 1, 2 and 3 of Wielonski, a filament resistance heater 29, an inductively heater evaporation source means 36, and an electron beam evaporator 40, respectively, are provided. (Filament resistance heater 29, source means 36 and electron beam evaporator 40 are hereinafter collectively referred to as evaporators.) However, these evaporators have several drawbacks.</p>
    <p num="6">
      One drawback is that each of the evaporators requires dedicated circuitry, e.g. power supplies, for powering the evaporators.
      <br/>
      Further, to couple the dedicated circuitry with the associated evaporator, one or more vacuum feedthroughs are necessary.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, the evaporators add complexity, decrease reliability and add cost to the apparatus.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      Another drawback is that the evaporators waste the evaporated material and contaminate the process chamber.
      <br/>
      In particular, referring to Wielonski FIG. 1, evaporation material from filament heater element 29 has a tendency to not only to coat the substrate but also the rest of the apparatus.
      <br/>
      Thus some (if not most) of the evaporated material from filament heater element 29 ends up coating the inside of the apparatus instead of the substrate thus wasting the evaporation material.
      <br/>
      This is a particular disadvantage when the evaporation material is expensive, e.g. gold.
      <br/>
      Further, the buildup of evaporated material on the inside of the apparatus can flake thereby contaminating the apparatus including the substrate.
      <br/>
      The evaporators of FIGS. 2 and 3 of Wielonski suffer from the same drawbacks.
    </p>
    <p num="8">Accordingly, it is desirable to form a particulate containing polymeric coating using a method that does not require the use of dedicated circuitry to evaporate the particulate and does not waste evaporation material.</p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="9">
      In accordance with the present invention, an apparatus for forming a thin film on a substrate includes a first gas inlet and an insert attached to the first gas inlet, the insert including a deposition source material such as lithium to be deposited on the substrate.
      <br/>
      The first gas inlet is coupled to a first process gas source which is typically a compressed gas cylinder of an inert gas such as argon.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      The apparatus further includes a second gas inlet coupled to a second process gas source, the second process gas source including a first gas component source and a second gas component source.
      <br/>
      The first gas component source is typically a compressed gas cylinder of a reactive gas such as oxygen and the second gas component source is typically a container of organosilicon liquid such as hexamethyldisiloxane (HMDSO).
      <br/>
      Alternatively, the second process gas source is a container of organosilicon liquid and a reactive gas is not provided.
    </p>
    <p num="11">The apparatus further includes a conical shield attached to the first gas inlet and surrounding the end of the first gas inlet to which the insert is attached.</p>
    <p num="12">The shield and first gas inlet are formed of an electrically conductive material and are electrically coupled to one another.</p>
    <p num="13">
      To form the thin film on the substrate, the substrate is mounted in a vacuum chamber formed of an electrically insulating material.
      <br/>
      After the vacuum chamber is pumped down to a subatmospheric pressure, the first process gas (e.g. argon) is provided through the insert which is shaped as an open ended hollow cylinder.
    </p>
    <p num="14">
      Power is then coupled to a main electrode adjacent an exterior surface of the vacuum chamber causing the first process gas within the insert to become ionized (i.e. to generate a plasma within the insert).
      <br/>
      Alternatively, instead of providing a main electrode adjacent an exterior surface of an electrically insulating vacuum chamber,-the vacuum chamber is a grounded electrically conductive material and power is coupled to the first gas inlet and shield to ionize the first process gas inside of the insert.
      <br/>
      In either embodiment, the insert is heated causing the insert deposition source material (e.g. lithium) to vaporize from the insert forming deposition source material vapor (e.g. lithium vapor).
    </p>
    <p num="15">
      The deposition source material vapor mixes with the second process gas (e.g. oxygen and HMDSO or just HMDSO) provided from the second gas inlet in a shield plasma region defined by the shield.
      <br/>
      As a result, a PECVD thin film (e.g. silicon oxide) including the deposition source material (e.g. lithium) is deposited on the substrate.
    </p>
    <p num="16">
      Through the use of the shield, power coupling efficiency to the shield plasma region is higher than to the rest of the vacuum chamber volume resulting in a higher degree of ionization in the shield plasma region than in the rest of the vacuum chamber.
      <br/>
      Further, the shield concentrates the overall process gas mixture to the vicinity of the substrate.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, through the use of the shield, thin film deposition preferentially occurs on the substrate and not on the rest of the vacuum chamber avoiding waste of the insert material and the associated contamination of the vacuum chamber.
    </p>
    <p num="17">
      In one embodiment, an insert formed of an aluminum/lithium alloy is used to generate lithium vapor. of importance, lithium vapor is generated without the use of pure lithium which is a chemically active and relatively hazardous material.
      <br/>
      Further lithium vapor is generated without having to provide an evaporator and the associated circuitry (e.g. power supplies) as in the prior art thus reducing the complexity, cost and increasing the reliability of the apparatus.
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      In another embodiment, a polymeric insert is used to introduce a polymer (e.g. polyethylene) into a PECVD formed thin film (e.g. silicon oxide).
      <br/>
      The structure is then heated to cause the polymer to vaporize and be removed from the PECVD formed thin film.
      <br/>
      The resulting thin film includes micro air gaps corresponding to the sites from which the polymer was vaporized.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, the resultant thin film has a low dielectric constant.
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      Advantageously, substantially any desired material can be incorporated into a PECVD formed thin film through the use of a suitable insert.
      <br/>
      Combined with the ability to readily change the PECVD formed thin film by varying the composition of the second process gas, any desired material can be incorporated into any desired PECVD formed thin film.
    </p>
    <p num="20">These and other objects, features and advantages of the present invention will be more readily apparent from the detailed description of the embodiments set forth below taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.</p>

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
    <p num="22">
      FIG. 1 is a cross-sectional view of a reactor system 10 including a cylindrical chamber 14 in accordance with the present invention.
      <br/>
      Chamber 14 is made of an insulating material such as quartz although other insulating materials such as alumina or plastic can be used.
    </p>
    <p num="23">In this embodiment, the length of chamber 14, i.e. the distance from a first end 14A to a second end 14B of chamber 14, is 8.7 inches (in.) and the inner diameter of chamber 14 is 7.75 in.</p>
    <p num="24">
      Chamber 14 is fitted on first end 14A with a door 16 which can be opened and closed to allow access to the interior of chamber 14.
      <br/>
      When door 16 is closed, i.e. when door 16 is in contact with end 14A as shown in FIG. 1, a vacuum seal is formed between door 16 and second end 14A using conventional means such as by locating an O-ring between door 16 and end 14A.
      <br/>
      Mounted on door 16 is a substrate holder 92 having a substrate 12 mounted thereon.
    </p>
    <p num="25">
      A second end 14B of chamber 14 is vacuum sealed with a face plate 18 also using conventional techniques.
      <br/>
      A pumping plenum 20 is concentrically attached on a first end to face plate 18.
      <br/>
      Pumping plenum 20 is also attached on a second end to a vacuum pump 22 by a T-coupler 24.
      <br/>
      In this embodiment, vacuum pump 22 is a conventional single or 2-stage rotary type mechanical pump which is set up for oxygen service. (Oxygen service typically requires the use of a fluorinated vacuum pump oil.) T-coupler 24 is made of an electrically insulating material such as Teflon or another polymeric material although other electrically insulating materials such as ceramic can be used. T-coupler 24 is a Cole Parmer (Niles, Illinois) part -H-06482-88 Teflon PFA NPT (F) tee or a MDC Vacuum Product, Inc. (Hayward, Calif.) part -728007 PVC Tee with KF50 flanges (part -728007) for nominal 1.5 in. PVC pipe.
      <br/>
      During use, vacuum pump 22 removes gas from the inside of chamber 14 via pumping plenum 20 and T10 coupler 24 thereby reducing the pressure within chamber 14 to a subatmospheric pressure.

      <br/>
      This enhances the properties of the nanomatrix (tm)  lithium thin film, e.g. increases the density.
    </p>
    <p num="71">Shield 100 further enhances the formation of the nanomatrix (tm)  lithium thin film by increasing the power coupling efficiency to shield plasma region 118 resulting in a higher degree of excitation and ionization of the plasma in shield plasma region 118 compared to a plasma generated without shield 100.</p>
    <p num="72">Further, shield 100 concentrates the process gas mixture to the vicinity of substrate 12 thus preferentially causing the nanomatrix (tm)  lithium thin film to be deposited on substrate 12 and not on the rest of chamber 14.</p>
    <p num="73">
      The power coupling also generates a plasma in a third plasma region 120 (hereinafter chamber plasma region 120) defined by the region inside of chamber 14 and outside of shield plasma region 118.
      <br/>
      Spent process gas from shield plasma region 118 is pumped off through chamber plasma region 120 to vacuum pump 22.
      <br/>
      However, the spent process gas is substantially depleted of HMDSO and lithium thus very little film formation occurs in chamber plasma region 120.
      <br/>
      Film formation is further inhibited in chamber plasma region 120 since the plasma is weakly ionized in chamber plasma region 120 compared to shield plasma region 118.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, by utilizing shield 100, very little of the material of insert 110 (i.e. lithium) is wasted due to deposition on chamber 14 and system contamination from deposition on chamber 14 is also reduced or eliminated.

      After a predetermined amount of time, generally 1 to 300 seconds and typically 5 to 45 seconds, power supply 88, the argon and HMDSO process gas flows and mechanical pump 22 are shut off.
      <br/>
      To shut off the argon and HMDSO process gases, shutoff valve 47 and metering valve 72 are closed.
      <br/>
      Chamber 14 is then vented to atmospheric pressure by opening vent valve 30.
    </p>
    <p num="75">
      When chamber 14 reaches atmospheric pressure as measured by pressure transducer 26, door 16 is opened.

      Substrate 12 is then removed and a new substrate 12 is loaded on to substrate holder 92 and processed.

      FIG. 3 is a cross-sectional view of substrate 12 having a nanomatrix (tm)  thin film 130 deposited thereon in accordance with the present invention.
      <br/>
      In this embodiment, film 130 is a silicon oxide containing lithium thin film.
      <br/>
      Advantageously, film 130 exhibits the physical characteristics of silicon oxide, e.g. mechanical strength, thermal stability, yet is electrically conductive due to the lithium incorporation.
      <br/>
      In particular, it is believed that the lithium atoms provide free electrons causing electrical conductivity of film 130 due to electron conductivity.
      <br/>
      Further, it is believed that the lithium atoms themselves can move in the silicon oxide matrix causing electrical conductivity of film 130 due to ion conductivity.
      <br/>
      Ion conductivity is particularly advantageous for use in electrochemical applications, e.g. for use in batteries.
    </p>
    <p num="77">
      Film 130 can also be used as a protective or passivation layer.
      <br/>
      For example, film 130 can be deposited on lithium metal-thus protecting the lithium metal from the ambient environment (e.g. from oxidation).
    </p>
    <p num="78">
      In this embodiment where HMDSO process gas is used, the resultant nanomatrix (tm)  thin film 130 is primarily silicon oxide which typically contains a small percentage of carbon and/or hydrogen and also contains lithium from insert 110.
      <br/>
      However, in other embodiments, nitrogen or fluorine can be incorporated into nanomatrix (tm)  thin film 130 for example by using a nitrogen containing organosilicon liquid such as hexamethydisilazane or a fluorine containing organosilicon liquid such as trimethyfluorosilane, respectively.
    </p>
    <p num="79">
      Alternatively, instead of using an organosilicon liquid, source 52 (FIG. 1) can be any plasma polymerizable material.
      <br/>
      For example, source 52 can be a hydrocarbon such as methane or propane.
      <br/>
      In this alternative, the resultant nanomatrix (tm)  thin film 130 (FIG. 3) is a thin film primarily containing carbon.
      <br/>
      As another alternative, source 52 (FIG. 1) can be an organometallic such as tetramethyltin.
    </p>
    <p num="80">
      Further, in other embodiments, the second process gas can include a first gas component such as oxygen and a second gas component such as HMDSO.
      <br/>
      Generally, in accordance with these other embodiments, the first gas component of the second process gas is a reactive gas.
      <br/>
      For example, the first gas component is oxygen or a fluorine-based compound such as carbon tetrafluoride (CF4).
      <br/>
      Examples of other suitable fluorine-based compounds include: aliphatic fluorohydrocarbons such as perfluorotetradecane; aromatic fluorohydrocarbons such as fluorobenzene; benzotrifluorides such as 3-(trifluoromethyl)benzyl alcohol; fluroalkenes/alkynes such as hexafluoropropene trimer; (Meth)acrylate monomers such as hexafluoroisopropyl acrylate; fluoroalcohols and phenols such as hexafluoroisopropanol; fluorine-containing ethers such as trifluoromethoxy benzene; fluorine-containing ketones such as hexafluoracetone; fluoroacids and anhydrides such as difluoroacetic acid; fluoroaldehydes such as pentafluorobenzaldehyde; fluoroesters such as ethyl trifluoroacetate; fluorine containing nitrides such as pentafluorobenzonitrile; inorganic fluorine compounds such as silver fluoride; and fluorinecontaining silanes such as trimethylfluorosilane.
    </p>
    <p num="81">
      Further, the first gas component of the second process gas can be another gas such as nitrogen (N2), nitrous oxide (N2 O) or an organometallic such as tetramethyltin.
      <br/>
      Further, the first gas component can itself be a gas mixture, for example can be a mixture of nitrous oxide and oxygen.

    <p num="82">
      In other embodiments, other inserts 110 can be used.
      <br/>
      For example, metallic, polymeric and ceramic inserts can be used.
      <br/>
      Examples of polymeric inserts include polyethylene, polypropylene and polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) inserts.
      <br/>
      The mechanism by which the material of the insert is vaporized depends upon the particular material.
      <br/>
      Examples include sublimation, sputtering and evaporation.
    </p>
    <p num="83">
      Advantageously, substantially any desired particulate can be incorporated into a PECVD formed thin film through the use of a suitable insert 100.
      <br/>
      Generally, insert 110 should be made of a material which can be sufficiently heated to produce a vapor without melting and dripping out of central gas inlet 41.
      <br/>
      Combined with the ability to readily change the PECVD formed thin film by varying the first and second components of the second process gas (i.e. sources 54, 52, respectively), any desired particulates can be incorporated into any desired PECVD formed thin film.
    </p>
    <p num="84">
      As an illustration, set forth above is an example where an Al/Li insert and a HMDSO process gas are used to form a PECVD silicon oxide thin film containing lithium.
      <br/>
      However, an alumina ceramic insert can be used instead of an Al/Li insert resulting in a PECVD silicon oxide thin film containing alumina.
      <br/>
      As a further alternative, an Al/Li insert can be used but the second process gas can be a gas mixture including hexamethyldisilazane (instead of HMDSO) and nitrogen, resulting in a PECVD silicon nitride thin film containing lithium.

      FIG. 4 is a cross-sectional view of substrate 12 having metal lines 200 and low dielectric constant (low-k) film 202 formed on substrate 12 in accordance with another embodiment.
      <br/>
      Metal lines 200 are formed using conventional techniques such as by selectively etching an electrically conductive layer on substrate 12.
    </p>
    <p num="86">
      Referring to FIGS. 1 and 4, low-k film 202 is formed using a polymeric insert 110 such as a polyethylene insert 110 and an organosilicon liquid such as HMDSO or octamethylcyclotetrasiloxane as source 52 (no reactive gas component in this embodiment).
      <br/>
      Processing proceeds as described above and results in a PECVD thin film silicon oxide matrix containing polyethylene.
      <br/>
      The entire structure is then heat treated, e.g. at 200 (degree)  C., to cause the polyethylene to vaporize and be removed from the silicon oxide matrix, leaving low-k film 202.
    </p>
    <p num="87">
      Of importance, micro air gaps 204 are produced in low-k film 202 corresponding to the sites from which the polyethylene was removed due to vaporization.
      <br/>
      Since air has a dielectric constant approximately equal to 1.0, micro air gaps 204 in low-k film 202 cause low-k film 202 to have a low dielectric constant, e.g. less than 3 0 (slashed zero)  Low-k film 202 is particularly useful in inimizing parasitic capacitance between metal lines 200 in reduced feature size applications where metal lines 200 are closely spaced to one another.

      In another alternative embodiment, offset gas inlet 34 and the associated gas delivery system including sources 52 and 54 of FIG. 1 are not provided.
      <br/>
      In this embodiment, the thin film deposited originates from insert 110.
      <br/>
      As an example, in the case where insert 110 is an Al/Li alloy, a thin lithium film is deposited on substrate 12.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, thin films of any desired material can be deposited by using the appropriate insert.
