      A magnetic drinking vessel holding device including a bottle holding portion adapted for holding a beverage container therein.
      <br/>
      A magnetic securement device is coupled with the rectangular base of the bottle holding portion.
      <br/>
      The magnetic securement device has an arcuate outer surface for adhering to curved metallic surfaces.

    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="1">The present invention relates to a magnetic drinking vessel holding device and more particularly pertains to adhering to a magnetic surface for holding water or the like for easy access by a user.</p>
    <p num="2">
      People that consume beverages, such as water, during activities are frequently in need of a place to store the container that holds the beverage during non-use periods.
      <br/>
      Activities such as exercising on a treadmill or stationary bicycle and mowing the lawn often cause the performer of these activities to work up a sweat thereby creating a thirst.
      <br/>
      The performers are sometimes forced to carry a beverage container with them while they are involved in these tasks.
      <br/>
      What is needed is a portable holding device that can be simply attached to a piece of equipment that is capable of holding the beverage container at times when the performer is not drinking from it.
    </p>
    <p num="3">The present invention seeks to solve the above mentioned problem by providing a portable drinking vessel container holding device that can be simply attached to a magnetic surface by means of a magnetic surface.</p>
    <p num="4">
      The use of bottle holding devices is known in the prior art.
      <br/>
      More specifically, bottle holding devices heretofore devised and utilized for the purpose of holding beverages for convenient use are known to consist basically of familiar, expected and obvious structural configurations, notwithstanding the myriad of designs encompassed by the crowded prior art which have been developed for the fulfillment of countless objectives and requirements.
    </p>
    <p num="5">By way of example, U.S. Pat. No. 4,191,350 to Ormond discloses a holder for a container such as a bottle with a magnetic base for attracting and storing the support rings while not in use. U.S. Pat. No. 4,063,701 to Wray discloses a use of a net type suspension beverage support device for attachment to a chair. U.S. Pat. No. 4,998,652 to Champagne discloses a clamp for attaching water bottles to various metal devices such as bicycles.</p>
