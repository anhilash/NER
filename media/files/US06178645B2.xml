    <heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="1">
      The present invention relates to improvements in apparatus for removing windscreens or other similar panels from vehicle bodies or the like.
      <br/>
      The apparatus is intended to separate a bonding layer between the panel to be removed and the supporting frame work surrounding same.
    </p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">
      U.S. Pat. No. 4,395,825 granted to Trevor S. Lock discloses apparatus of the aforementioned kind comprising a device for reciprocating a flat elongated flexible blade sharpened to one face along longitudinal edges and a curved end joining the longitudinal edges.
      <br/>
      The blade is reciprocated along the panel to be removed to separate the bonding layer.
      <br/>
      This type of apparatus has proved to be quite successful, particularly when used by skilled workmen, however, there are some problems when the apparatus is used by inexperienced workmen.
      <br/>
      These difficulties include, in some cases a difficulty in keeping the blade flat on the panel being removed and at the same time judging the depth of cut (reciprocation) required to separate the bonding layer without contacting and causing at least minor or superficial damage to the frame work surrounding the panel to be removed.
      <br/>
      Similarly, damage can occur to the panels themselves or coatings applied thereto.
      <br/>
      Further damage may occur to trim or other components on or surrounding the panel being removed.
      <br/>
      A still further problem is that if the blade is not held generally parallel to or flat on the panel, then a very poor or inefficient cutting operation results.
    </p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="3">
      Objects of the present invention are therefore to provide improvements to apparatus of the type disclosed in the Lock Patent which will enable such apparatus to be used while at least minimising the aforementioned difficulties.
      <br/>
      It will of course be appreciated that the present invention is not limited to use with blades as defined in the Lock Patent but blades are clearly preferred.
      <br/>
      According to a first aspect, the present invention provides a device for severing a bonding strip interposed between and securing together overlapping portions of respective rigid elements, said device including a generally flat cutting blade portion shaped and arranged to, in use, engage the bonding strip between the overlapping portions in a cutting action to sever at least one of the overlapping portions from the bonding strip, and rest means adapted to engage the rigid element from which the bonding strip is being severed at a location spaced from the cutting blade portion to, in use, provide guidance for the movement of the cutting blade portion during said severing operation.
    </p>
    <p num="4">Conveniently, the cutting blade has a flat face on one side thereof defining a perimetal cutting edge and the opposite side is inclined upwardly from said cutting edge to provide support for the cutting edge.</p>
    <p num="5">In accordance with a second aspect, the present invention provides that, in use, the flat face is in contact with the rigid element from which the bonding strip is to be severed, and wherein the rest means is rigidably supported relative to the cutting blade to, in use, engage the rigid element from which the bonding strip is to be removed so that flat face of the cutting blade is in face to face contact with said rigid element.</p>
    <p num="6">
      In one preferred arrangement, the blade may be a generally flat elongated blade which is sharpened as disclosed in the Lock U.S. patent previously referred to.
      <br/>
      In another preferred arrangement, the blade may comprise any other form of blade known for this purpose including those which are oscillated during their cutting motion.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      In one preferred arrangement, the panel removing blade may be a generally flat elongated blade which is sharpened as disclosed in Australian Patent No. 543405 and reciprocated in a cutting motion.
      <br/>
      In other preferred arrangements, the panel removing blade may comprise any other form of blade known for this purpose including those which are oscillated during their cutting motion.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      In one preferred embodiment, the rest means may comprise a surface located in a plane generally parallel to a transverse dimension of the flat cutting blade portion.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, the rest means might be formed by two surfaces defining a plane generally parallel to a transverse dimension of the flat cutting blade portion.
      <br/>
      Conveniently, the plane of the or each said surface of the rest means is angled obliquely towards the flat cutting blade portion.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      In a further preferred embodiment, the rest means may comprise an edge portion disposed generally parallel to a transverse dimension of the flat cutting blade portion.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, the rest means might be formed by at least two edge portions together defining a rest edge configuration disposed generally parallel to a transverse dimension of the flat cutting blade portion.
    </p>
    <p num="10">In a still further preferred embodiment, the rest means may comprise at least two point contacts defining a contact line extending therebetween disposed generally parallel to a transverse dimension of the flat cutting blade portion.</p>
    <p num="11">In a preferred arrangement, two said rest means are provided on diametrically opposed sides of the flat elongated panel removing blade.</p>
    <p num="12">
      The present invention also proposes providing, as a preferred feature, a stop element which is adapted, in use, to be located adjacent an end region of a flat elongated panel removing blade whereby the end region of the blade is positioned at a predetermined distance relative to the end zone of the stop element.
      <br/>
      Conveniently, the stop element is adjustable relative to the flat elongated panel removing blade to adjust the distance between the end of the blade and the end zone of the stop element.
      <br/>
      Preferably, the stop element is at least as transversely flexible as the blade.
      <br/>
      Normally, when a panel is being removed, the blade will extend beyond the end zone of the stop element but, for trimming purposes after a panel has been removed, the stop element may extend beyond the end zone of the blade.
    </p>
    <heading>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading>

      <br/>
      FIGS. 5, 6, 7 and 8 are side elevation views of preferred forms of panel removal tool according to the present invention shown in differing configurations of use.
    </p>
    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="14">
      FIG. 1 of the drawings shows an end of a tool 10 for reciprocating an elongated flat blade 11 in a direction indicated by arrow 12.
      <br/>
      The tool 10 is conveniently actuated pneumatically but any other means of reciprocation could also be utilised.
      <br/>
      It will of course also be appreciated that a tool for oscillating a cutting blade could also be used.
      <br/>
      One preferred form of guidance cap 13 is shown secured to the end of the tool 10 by set screws 14.
      <br/>
      In a possible alternative, the arrangement of the cap 13 may be integrally formed with the end of the tool 10.
      <br/>
      The blade 11 passes through an end opening 28 in the guidance cap 13 and is secured by fastening means to the operating mechanism of the tool 10.
      <br/>
      An access opening is provided through the cap 13 to permit access to the blade fastening means so that the blades can be replaced when desired.
      <br/>
      The blade 11 is conveniently sharpened at its end section 15 in a manner similar to that described in the Lock Patent such that there is a sharpened edge 16 located in a lower blade surface 17 of the blade.
      <br/>
      The guidance cap is conveniently formed with a block section 18 which includes at least one rest surface 19.
      <br/>
      As shown in the drawing, the rest surface 19 is obliquely disposed such that it is angled towards the blade 11.
      <br/>
      In this manner, in use, the rest surface 19 is placed in contact with the glass or other panel (such as a windscreen) and the blade 11 is thereby automatically located so that it will reciprocate in the plane of the panel being removed.
      <br/>
      Moreover, by angling the surface 19, the blade end region 15 is directed towards contact with the panel being removed.
      <br/>
      It will of course be appreciated that the surface 19 could be replaced by two or more surfaces, by an edge as shown in FIG. 2 formed by one or more edge lines 26, or by at least two point contacts 27 as shown in FIG. 3, each of which being arranged to maintain the blade 11 in contact with and parallel to the panel surface.
      <br/>
      It will further be appreciated that, if desired, the top surface 20 opposite to the surface 19 could also form a rest or guidance surface and in which case the blade 11 would be removed and inverted or turned over.
      <br/>
      This surface (or surfaces) 20 could also be obliquely formed similar to surface 19.
    </p>
    <p num="15">
      The guidance cap 13 also includes a stop element 21 in the form of an elongated bar or strip having a first end 22 releasably held in the cap 13 by screw elements 23.
      <br/>
      The stop element 21 is conveniently flexible longitudinally such that this element can flex as the blade 11 flexes.
      <br/>
      The opposed end 24 of the stop element defines a limit of depth of cut of the end region 15 of the blade 11.
      <br/>
      The end 24 may be formed with a bent section 25 as illustrated but other arrangements could be utilised depending on the task required to be performed.
      <br/>
      To adjust the depth of cut, the screw elements 23 are loosened and the stop element 21 repositioned to define the desired distance between the element end 24 and the end 15 of the blade 11.
      <br/>
      Thereafter, the screw elements 23 are re-tightened to fix the stop element 21 in position.
    </p>
    <p num="16">
      FIG. 4 illustrates an alternative preferred form of guidance cap 13 where like features have been given the same reference numbers as in FIG. 1.
      <br/>
      In this embodiment, the stop elements are retained by a novel mechanism which allows quick and easy adjustment of the stop element 21 relative to the blade 11.
      <br/>
      The cap 13 includes aligned cross bores 29 adapted to receive plug elements 30, 31.
      <br/>
      Each of the plug elements 30, 31 has a non-circular cross-section thereby preventing rotation of same within the cross bores 29 so that the plug elements can move axially but not rotationally.
      <br/>
      Further, each plug element has a projecting ledge portion 32 adapted to project into the section 33 adapted to receive the stop element 21 such that the projecting ledge portions 32 will engage and hold the stop element 21.
      <br/>
      In addition the section 33 is extended along the top of the guidance cap 13 to provide further rigidity of holding of the stop element 21.
      <br/>
      Finally, a fastener bolt 34 is provided with a head 35 and a screw threaded section 36 opposite to the head.
      <br/>
      The bolt 34 passes freely through the internal bore 37 of the plug element 30 to be threadingly engaged with a threaded internal bore 38 of the second plug element 31.
      <br/>
      Rotation of the bolt 34 in one direction will tend to move the plug elements 30, 31 apart to loosen their grip on the stop element 21 and rotation in an opposite direction will draw the plug elements 30, 31 together tightening their grip on the stop element 21.
      <br/>
      Spring elements 39 are provided to maintain tension on the assembly preventing unwinding of the bolt 34 unintentionally during use of the device.
      <br/>
      As with the embodiment of FIG. 1, the guidance cap 13 also includes guidance rest surfaces 19, 20.
    </p>
    <p num="17">
      Referring now to FIG. 5, a panel removal tool 10 is shown with a guidance cap 13 positioned with its guidance rest surface 19 against the windscreen panel 40 being removed.
      <br/>
      The stop element 21 has a free end zone that engages against the urethane seal 41 that is being cut by the blade 11 reciprocated along the surface of the panel 40.
      <br/>
      It is apparent that this arrangement prevents the blade contacting and damaging structural parts of the vehicle frame around the panel 40.
      <br/>
      FIG. 6 illustrates an arrangement similar to FIG. 5 except that in this case, a cowling 42 generally covers the urethane seal 41 being cut.
      <br/>
      In this case, a different form of stop element (similar to FIG. 1) is used where the end section 25 engages the cowling 42.
      <br/>
      FIG. 7 is also an arrangement similar to FIG. 1 where the blade 11 and stop element 21 may reach a long way beyond a vehicle dashboard structure 43 or the like.
      <br/>
      FIG. 8 illustrates a still further arrangement where the stop element 21 engages the panel 40 being removed and the blade reciprocates along an end piece 44 on the stop element 21.
      <br/>
      In this case the guidance surfaces 20 are maintained in contact with panel 40 being removed.
      <br/>
      Further, a portion of the urethane seal 45 may be left to be trimmed off later.
    </p>
    <p num="18">By the arrangements described, it is possible in a simple and convenient manner to maintain the blade 11 always parallel to the surface of the panel being removed and moreover to restrict the blade depth of cut to only that which is required to allow removal of the panel.</p>
