    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="1">The invention relates to an electric motor having an integrated electronic control device.</p>
    <p num="2">
      Electric motors are known with which, for example, in machine tools carriages are driven in order to feed the carriages, for example, quickly to the machining location and then switch over to the advancing speed for machining the work piece.
      <br/>
      The electronic control device provided for rpm control is a component separate from the electric motor so that the mounting of such a drive requires considerable mounting space which is often not available.
    </p>
    <p num="3">
      There are also electric motors known which are of a small size and which already have an integrated electronic control device.
      <br/>
      Such motors, however, exhibit considerable moment fluctuations so that an exact rpm (revolutions per minute) control is not obtainable.
    </p>
    <p num="4">It is therefore an object of the invention to embody the aforementioned electric motor such that a very precise rpm control is possible while the motor has a small size.</p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="5">This object is inventively solved forthe aforementioned electric motor by supplying the electric motor with sine-shaped currents or voltages.</p>
    <p num="6">
      The inventive electric motor is supplied with sine curve-shaped currents or voltages, and the sine commutation results in a reduction of the moment fluctuations to a minimum so that a very precise rpm control is possible in a simple manner.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, the inventive electric motor exhibits a very quiet and synchronous run for smallest rpm.
    </p>
    <p num="7">The actual value transducer for the commutation, the rpm, and also for the position of the motor shaft are advantageously in the form of linear Hall sensors which are simple and inexpensive components.</p>
    <p num="8">Further features of the invention will result from the further claims, the description, and the drawings.</p>
    <heading>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading>
    <p num="9">
      The invention will be explained in more detail with the aid of the drawings showing an embodiment of the invention. It is shown in:

    <heading>DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
    <p num="10">
      The electric motor is a brushless motor having a coil without iron-core and further having integrated position and rpm control.
      <br/>
      It is characterized by a sine commutation, which reduces moment fluctuations to a minimum and ensures a very smooth run.
      <br/>
      The electric motor is controlled by a digital four quadrant control which results in a highly dynamic drive with excellent properties.
      <br/>
      A programable current control makes it possible to realize in addition a moment limitation.
      <br/>
      The electric motor has very compact dimensions and can be used in any situation where a great rpm range or excellent smooth running is required.
      <br/>
      An example for such an application are machine tools in which, for example, a carriage is initially quickly advanced at a high speed and subsequently is advanced at a slower speed to its destination.

      The electric motor has expediently a cylindrical housing 1 to which is connected a flange 3 with interposition of a thermal insulation 2, preferably an adhesive sleeve.

      A cooling member 5 with cooling ribs 6 is connected with screws 4 with interposition of a heat conducting coil 7 to the flange 3.
      <br/>
      A power supply cable 8 is guided into the flange 3.

      Plates 51-53 with motor specifications are provided.

      The flange 3 receives an electronic control device 9 with at least one printed circuit board 10 on which MOSFETs 11 are provided.
      <br/>
      A motor shaft 12 projects from the housing 1 at the side opposite the flange 3 and supports a rotor 13.
      <br/>
      The rotor 13 is surrounded by a stator 13.
      <br/>
      In order to achieve absolute rotor angle information, three Hall sensors 15-17 (FIGS. 4 and 5) are provided and arranged so as to be phase-displaced by 120 (degree) . They operate with high resolution.
      <br/>
      With a suitable algorithm, for detecting maximum and minimum values of the Hall signals, a continuous calibration of the Hall sensor offset values and an amplitude standardization, i.e., a compensation of the amplitude errors, is possible.
      <br/>
      The analog Hall sensors 15-17 serve as actual value transducers for the commutation, the rpm, and the position.

      The electric motor is an EC mini motor which is preferably provided with a bell-shaped armature coil.
      <br/>
      The digital position and rpm control with sine commutation is integrated into the electric motor.
      <br/>
      It is also possible to produce triangular and trapezoidal movements with the position control.

    <p num="14">
      The position control will be explained in more detail with the aid of FIG. 4.
      <br/>
      The program provided for performing the position control mode of the electric motor is saved in a micro controller 18 which is part of the electronic control device 9 in the flange 3.
      <br/>
      Via an interface 19, preferably a RS 232 interface, the nominal (set point) position of the device to be driven by the motor is predetermined, for example, the position of a carriage of a machine tool.
      <br/>
      The drive can be configured to very different applications via the interface 19.
      <br/>
      The adjustments are advantageously memorized in an EEPROM that saves values even after switching off the supply voltage.
      <br/>
      The entire operation of the unit can be performed via the interface 19.
      <br/>
      It is possible to supply corresponding commands via a simple ASCII terminal program.
      <br/>
      For example, the parameters and mode adjustments of the unit can be carried out by a personal computer.
      <br/>
      It is also possible in practical applications to provide communication from a central control.
    </p>
    <p num="15">
      The interface 19 supplies the set point position values 20 for the set point position to a comparator 21.
      <br/>
      It contains the actual position values or signals 22 of the rotor position computing unit 23.
      <br/>
      When the set point values 20 differ from the actual position values 22, the comparator 21 will supply a corresponding signal to the position control 24.
      <br/>
      It produces a set point rpm value nset that is sent to a comparator 25.
      <br/>
      It also contains the actual rpm value nactual of an rpm computation unit 26 which is positioned downstream of the rotor position computing unit 23.
      <br/>
      The comparator 25 produces a control signal by comparing the set point value and the actual value, and the control signal is then supplied to an rpm control 27.
      <br/>
      With it, a three-phase sine commutator 28 is controlled having three phases A-C supplied via an output terminal 29 and the MOSFETs 11 to the motor.

      The Hall sensors 15-17 detect the rotary angle of the rotor 13 and supply corresponding signals to the rotor position computing unit 23.
      <br/>
      The calculated rotor angle  PHI  is supplied to the three-phase sine commutator 28 as well as the rpm computing unit 26.
      <br/>
      In this manner, the rotary angle of the rotor 13 is detected with high resolution and thus with high precision and is optionally readjusted.
      <br/>
      The three Hall sensors 15-17 are divided into six phases per revolution.
      <br/>
      The calculation of the rotor angle  PHI  is carried out with the aid of an arc-sine table from two Hall signals which are positioned between 0 (degree)  and 60 (degree) . By weighting functions which are determined from the Hall signals, an average value is determined so that a smooth transition from one to the next phase is achieved.
      <br/>
      The arc-sine table is determined by recording the Hall signals with a very precise reference impulse sender and a mathematical generation.
      <br/>
      In this manner it is possible to compensate systematic non-sine shapes of the Hall signals.

      A protective unit 30 has correlated therewith a three-phase sine commutator 28 which, for example, protects it against voltage peaks etc.
      <br/>
      An overvoltage control 31 is provided for preventing voltage increases that would result in a destruction of the electronic components.
      <br/>
      In the generator operation of the motor, an overvoltage would result in the dc branch of the control when the power supply can not return energy, which is the normal situation.
      <br/>
      The overvoltage control 31 prevents such voltage increases such that upon reaching a predetermined voltage threshold, the angle  PHI  between the rotor 13 and the rotary field will be adjusted to be less favorable.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, excess energy is used up during generator operation in the motor as thermal energy.
      <br/>
      The overvoltage control 31 controls a certain set voltage which is predetermined.
    </p>
    <p num="18">The electronic control device 9 is operated, for example, at a dc voltage at 24 V.</p>
    <p num="19">
      The electronic control device 9 not only provides position control but also rpm control.
      <br/>
      The program provided for the rpm control is also loaded into the micro controller (control device) 9.
      <br/>
      For providing a preset (set point) rpm value, the electronic control device 9 is provided with an analog terminal 32 (FIG. 5).
      <br/>
      The analog voltage input signal or value supplied for generating the set point rpm values is, for example, in the range of  +- 10 volt.
      <br/>
      It is recalculated (reduced) by an analog calculating circuit, preferably an operation summation amplifier 33, to a reduced input value in the voltage range of 0-5 volt.
      <br/>
      This voltage is then amplified to an amplified input value by the amplifier 34 arranged downstream, wherein amplification is by a factor 10 in the shown embodiment.
      <br/>
      The signals of the two amplifiers 33, 34 are supplied to an A/D converter 35 which operates preferably at 10 bit.
      <br/>
      By employing the two amplifiers 33, 34, a wide rpm range can be covered with high resolution.
      <br/>
      A narrow rpm range for the rotor is a range of approximately up to 100 rpm while a high rpm range of the motor is up to 10,000 rpm.
      <br/>
      For low rpm, in order to provide high precision, a high resolution is required.
      <br/>
      An advantage of this method is that for high resolution at low rpm an A/D converter with relatively narrow resolution (10 bit) is sufficient.
      <br/>
      The digitally converted signals are supplied to a set point rpm computing unit 36 which combines the two digital values to a rpm value nset.
      <br/>
      Instead of the two amplifiers 33, 34 it is possible to employ a logarithmic amplifier which at low rpm of the electric motor increases the resolution.
      <br/>
      In this case, the logarithmic signals are supplied to an A/D converter.
      <br/>
      The digitalized signal is subsequently converted by a reversing algorithm (exponential function) to the rpm set point value nset.
      <br/>
      The set point rpm value nset is supplied to the comparator 25 which compares it to the actual rpm value nactual.
      <br/>
      This actual value is supplied to the comparator 25 by the rpm computing unit 26 which is arranged downstream of the rotor computing unit system 23.
      <br/>
      The set point/actual value comparison results in a control signal that is supplied by the comparator 25 to the PI rpm controller 27 which supplies a corresponding signal to the three-phase sine commutator 28.
      <br/>
      Via the output terminal 29, the phase signals supplied by the commutator 28 are generated.
      <br/>
      The Hall sensor 15-17 produce for the phases A-C of the electric motor the corresponding Hall signals which are supplied to the rotor position computing unit 23 as actual value signals.
    </p>
    <p num="20">
      The signals supplied by the A/D converter 35 are combined in the computing unit 36 by suitable algorithms to the set point rpm value nset with corresponding weighting functions.
      <br/>
      It is possible to realize for low rpm range a resolution of 2 rpm and for a high rpm range a resolution of 20 rpm.
      <br/>
      The transition is smooth because of the weighting function even when the components such as the operation amplifier, resistors etc, have errors.
      <br/>
      Such errors would also result in an rpm offset error.
      <br/>
      However, this is eliminated by a one time calibration in the micro controller (control device) 9 and by saving in the EEPROM.
      <br/>
      In the same manner, the scaling factor is also calibrated.

    <p num="21">
      When delivering the electric motor, its integrated position and rpm control is in a standardized adjustment.
      <br/>
      The analog terminal 32 is adjusted for the rpm control such that by providing an analog voltage between -10 and +10 volt a preadjustment of the rpm set point is possible.
      <br/>
      This standardized adjustment can be changed at any time via the interface 19 by the client or by the manufacturer before delivery according to the desired specifications.
      <br/>
      The electric motor can be configured very easily for different applications.
      <br/>
      These adjustments can be saved in the EEPROM.
      <br/>
      Also, the entire operation of the electric motor can be performed via the interface 19.
