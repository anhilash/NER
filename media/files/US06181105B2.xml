      Field of the Invention
    </p>
    <p num="3">
      The present invention relates to a self contained transportable power source maintenance and charge system for an implantable medical device encased in a sterile package.
      <br/>
      More specifically, the system includes a ribbon cable on a sterile plastic or blister package containing an implantable medical device.
      <br/>
      The system is connected to the ribbon cable, which in turn is coupled to the medical device, whereby a desired maintenance charge can be maintained on a battery of the medical device until the sterile package is opened for implanting the device.

      Rechargeable lithium ion batteries are known for their high voltage and high energy density.
      <br/>
      Compared to nickel cadmium or nickel metal hydride batteries, lithium ion batteries contain 1.5 times more capacity, 3 times higher voltage with 1.5 to 2 times less weight.
      <br/>
      Unlike other rechargeable batteries, lithium ion batteries do not exhibit a memory effect, they are friendly to the environment and may be recharged in excess of 500 cycles while retaining acceptable capacity.
    </p>
    <p num="5">Another desirable feature of a lithium ion battery is that properly charged and discharged, lithium ion batteries do not produce gases; hence, they could be enclosed in a hermetically sealed enclosure.</p>
    <p num="6">With these attractive technical features in mind, lithium ion batteries may be utilized to power implantable devices.</p>

      Nevertheless, certain rechargeable lithium ion electrochemical cells and batteries require a specific voltage and or charge capacity control during storage or transit in order to preserve cell functional integrity.
      <br/>
      Due to cell chemistry, the cells exhibit a self discharge rate that may over time reduce the voltage down to a detrimental level.
      <br/>
      If the cell's voltage is allowed to discharge below a specific threshold voltage, prior to charging, the cell's ability to be recharged to the maximum specified capacity may be permanently lost.
      <br/>
      This loss of recharge capacity is usually referred to as faded capacity.
      <br/>
      Further, if the cell's voltage is allowed to drop to near zero volts, the cell's ability to be recharged at all may be permanently lost, rendering the cell useless.
      <br/>
      A known electrochemical mechanism that could cause irreversible damage to a lithium ion cell is dissolution of the current collector material upon voltage reduction below certain threshold.
    </p>
    <p num="8">Therefore, it becomes desirable to have a self contained transportable power source maintenance and charge system that can be pre-programmed to maintain a specific voltage and/or charge capacity of a power source, such as a lithium or any other rechargeable secondary power sources, that is affected by self discharge and its consequential damage.</p>

    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="12">The self contained transportable power source maintenance and charge system of the present invention uses an auxiliary power source and circuitry for delivering energy at a regulated voltage or capacity to a battery of a medical device to compensate for the inherent self discharge manifested by rechargeable power sources over storage or transit time.</p>
    <p num="13">The power source maintenance and charge system also provides a safe voltage or charge level for lithium ion cells and for devices that are powered by such a power source during storage or transit.</p>
    <p num="14">
      Further, the power source maintenance and charge system can safely switch from a maintenance mode to a charge mode by activating a Reed switch with a remote magnet or actuating a mechanical switch or other means thereby increasing the regulated maintenance voltage to a higher specified charging voltage.
      <br/>
      The charge activation using an electro-mechanical switch or Reed switch can be achieved inside a device's sterile blister package in order to prevent opening of the blister which may violate sterility.
      <br/>
      This feature also facilitates charging the device prior to implant without opening the sterile blister package.

    <p num="16">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT(S)</p>
    <p num="17">The power source maintenance and charge system of the present invention is identified by reference numeral 10 in FIG. 1 and is capable of being used in conjunction with a polymer insulated flat ribbon cable that passes through a sterile or non-sterile double sealed blister package 12 (FIG. 7) to connect an auxiliary power source 14 (FIGS. 2-7) of the power maintenance and charge system 10 that in turn is connected to a medical device 16 (FIGS. 1-7) containing a lithium ion rechargeable cell or battery 18 (FIG. 3).</p>
    <p num="18">The secondary battery maintenance and charge system 10 is capable of preserving power source integrity in storage cells 18 or devices containing a lithium ion chemistry system or other power sources whereby the capacity and/or voltage is not allowed to drop below certain safe capacity and/or voltage threshold(s).</p>
    <p num="19">Further, the system 10 allows the power source maintenance and/or charge to take place while the device 16 is contained within a sterile blister package 12 or multiple sterile or non-sterile package 12.</p>
    <p num="20">The power source maintenance and charge system 10 is self contained and transportable within a sterile or non-sterile device package or blister package 12 such that the power source 18 integrity is maintained within certain safe capacity or voltage threshold during storage or transit.</p>
    <p num="21">
      The power source maintenance and charge system 10 may be switched to either maintain or charge the power source 18 within a single sterile package or sterile double blister package 12 without violating the blister package seal in order to preserve device 16 sterility.
      <br/>
      The power source maintenance and charge system 10 can be configured to maintain or configured to charge the power source 10 or other power device in the target system 16 using several methods, but not limited to any such method as follows:
    </p>
    <p num="22">
      (a) Activation of a Reed switch circuit 22 including a magnet 24 and Reed switch 26 as shown in FIGS. 2 and 3.
      <br/>
      (b) Activation of a photo-optical switch circuit 28 as shown in FIG. 4.
      <br/>
      (c) Activation of an electro-mechanical switch circuit 30 as shown in FIG. 5.
      <br/>
      (d) Activation of an electro-mechanical switch and latch circuit 32 including switch 33, latch 34 and switch 36 as shown in FIG. 6
    </p>
    <p num="23">
      The power source maintenance and charge system 10 is shown in more detail in FIG. 2 and includes an auxiliary power source or battery 14, an optional plug in AC/DC power source 15, a switch 39 for connecting the power source 14 or the power source 15 to the charge maintenance circuit 20 and the magnet 24 operated Reed switch 26.
      <br/>
      As shown, the charge maintenance circuit 20 includes a voltage regulator 40 coupled between the switch 39 and a pair of series connected transistors 42 and 44.
      <br/>
      Also connected across the switch 39 are series connected resistor 46 LED 48 and the Reed switch 26.
      <br/>
      A junction 50 between the resistor 46 and the LED 48 is connected to the P and N gates of the transistors 42 and 44, as shown.
    </p>
    <p num="24">
      Referring now to FIG. 7, there is shown therein the power source charge and maintenance system 10 for maintaining a charge on a implantable pulse generator 60 which are covered by an outer blister package 62 and inner blister package 64 which incorporates a cavity 66 for retaining the implantable pulse generator 60 in place.
      <br/>
      A tray or base board 68 mounts the blister packages 62 and 64, the power source or battery 14 which is connected into receptacle 70 which plugs into edge connector pins 72, a spare battery 74 which is connected to a receptacle 76 and fits into a cavity 78 of the tray 68.
      <br/>
      The tray 68 mounts all of the above components during shipping and storage of the packages 62 and 64.
    </p>
    <p num="25">
      The implantable pulse generator 60 is connected to a ribbon cable assembly 80 which exits blister packages 62 and 64 through heat seals 82 and 27.
      <br/>
      The ribbon cable 80 is connected to the 9 volt battery 14 through the electronic module 86 containing the voltage regulator 40, shown in FIG. 3.
      <br/>
      Electronic module 86 contains push button 88 which is actuated through a dome 90 formed in the blister package 62.
      <br/>
      A cover 92 of the blister package 62 is folded over tray 68 and locked in place using locking slots 94 and 96.
    </p>
    <p num="26">
      The voltage regulator 40 in the module 88 will normally deliver a constant voltage to maintain lithium ion cell 18 through ribbon cable assembly 80 connected to a feed through 98 which in turn is connected to an implantable power management system 100.
      <br/>
      The switch 88 is actuated to provide a charge voltage as required by the lithium ion cell 18.
      <br/>
      An LED 102 will flash when the regulator 40 in the module 88 is in a charge mode and will turn off when the charge is completed.
    </p>
    <p num="27">
      Accordingly, the assembly shown in FIG. 7 includes both a target system 16, in this embodiment the implantable pulse generator 60 which is sealed within a double sterile blister package 62, 64, the auxiliary power source 14 and power source maintenance and charge system 10 located in a non-sterile section of the outer blister package 62.
      <br/>
      This configuration allows the product to be sterilized within an inner blister package 64 of the double blister package 62, 64.
    </p>
    <p num="28">
      The power maintenance and charge circuit 10 and auxiliary battery 14 may be connected and placed in the outer blister package 62 after sterilization is completed.
      <br/>
      This method avoids exposing the auxiliary battery 14 and the power maintenance system 10 to the sterilization process.
    </p>
    <p num="29">As shown in FIG. 8A, the power source maintenance and charge system 10 can be connected to a medical device 110 by means of a flat flexible polymer insulated ribbon cable 112 containing thin metal conductors that pass through a sterile seal area 114 at a seal area 120 in a blister package 116.</p>
    <p num="30">In FIG. 8B is shown an enlarged cross section of the polymer ribbon cable 112 containing conductors 118 sealed at 120 between the blister material tray or base board 122 and a polymer coated cover 124.</p>

      A polymer insulated flat ribbon 130 (FIG. 9) with metallic conductors is heat fused (sealed) together at a polymer seal area 132 with the blister package tray and a polymer coated cover 134 is sealed in the seal area 135 to the tray to maintain a sterile medical device or other product 136 within safe sterile requirements.
      <br/>
      The polymer ribbon 130 can be folded over the edge of the blister package as indicated at 138 so as to form an electrical edge connector 138 as shown in FIG. 9.
    </p>
    <p num="32">An electronic module 140 (FIG. 10) that maintains charge on, or charges a, battery 142 can be an integral part of an auxiliary battery connector 144 and equipped with circuitry (not shown) for switching the electronic module 140 to be used in a maintenance or charge mode using a magnetic Reed switch or other means of electronic or electro-mechanical switching to provide current to a pacing lead 146 or a ribbon cable 148 as shown in FIG. 10.</p>
    <p num="33">
      An external electronic module 150 (FIG. 11A) that maintains the charge in the lithium ion cell 18 can also be incorporated within a medical device 152.

      <br/>
      The charge maintenance circuit 20 is mounted on a tray or base (not shown) underneath the outer cover 172.
      <br/>
      In a sealing area 174 of the inner cover 170 to the tray or base are ribbon lead connectors which in FIG. 12 include a ribbon lead connector 176 from the plus side of the charge maintenance circuit 20 to the implantable lead of the implantable medical device and a ribbon lead connector 178 from the negative output of the charge maintenance circuit 20 to a case of the implantable medical device.
      <br/>
      The ribbon lead connectors 176 and 178 are connected through tandem switches 180 and 182 to the rechargeable cell 18.
    </p>
    <p num="36">The assembly shown in FIG. 13 is substantially identical to the assembly shown in FIG. 12 except that the ribbon lead connectors 176 and 178 are connected to diodes 184 and 186 to the rechargeable cell 18 instead of through tandem switches 180, 182.</p>
    <p num="37">
      In the assembly shown in FIG. 14, the charge maintenance circuit 20 is connected through recharging coil lines 188 and 190 located in the seal area 174 to the rechargeable cell 18.
      <br/>
      The lead and case ribbon connectors 176 and 178 remain in the sealed area 174 for testing purposes.
    </p>
    <p num="38">The assembly shown in FIG. 15 is similar to the assembly shown in FIG. 14 except that in place of recharging coil lines 188 and 190 there are provided positive and negative ribbon lead connectors 192 and 194 for connecting the charge maintenance circuit 20 to the rechargeable cell 18 with the lead and case ribbon connectors still located in the sealed area 174.</p>
    <p num="39">
      In addition to having a flat or ribbon cable that extends from the blister package along the base or tray of the package, a cable or wire conductors can extend outwardly from the blister package through a protrusion in the blister.
      <br/>
      In this respect, there is shown in FIG. 16 a blister package 200 including a base or tray 202 and a blister cover 204.
      <br/>
      The blister cover 204 has a flange 206 which is sealed at 208 to the base 202.
