      A timing belt system for an engine includes a first timing belt coupling the camshaft to the crankshaft and a parallel second timing belt coupling the camshaft to the crankshaft.
      <br/>
      A belt sensor provides an alarm signal upon failure of either timing belt.
      <br/>
      While the other belt continues to function and thereby prevents damage to the engine from occurring, the alarm signal alerts the operator that a broken belt should be replaced.

  <description format="original" lang="en" id="desc_en">
    <p num="1">The present invention relates generally to toothed belt drives and more particularly to a method and apparatus for protection from damage following failure of a toothed belt drive as utilized for example in timing belt applications wherein belt failure may result in expensive damage or dangerous consequences.</p>
    <p num="2">Toothed belt drives are commonly utilized for mechanical power transmission, particularly where a correct angular relationship or "timing" between a driving shaft and a driven shaft needs to be accurately maintained.</p>
    <p num="3">
      Vehicles utilizing internal combustion engines typically have a camshaft with spaced cams mounted on the camshaft for opening and closing engine valves in accordance with the requirements of the engine operating cycle.
      <br/>
      Some engines use a single camshaft whereas others utilize a plurality of camshafts, for example, two camshafts.
      <br/>
      The camshafts are typically driven by the engine crankshaft which also transmits the engine power through the vehicle transmission to the wheels.
    </p>
    <p num="4">A typical application for a toothed belt drive is, for example, in a four-stroke cycle automotive engine wherein a camshaft used for operating valves runs at one-half the angular velocity or, otherwise expressed, at one-half the revolutions per minute (rpm) of the crankshaft that drives it by way of the toothed belt and wherein the angular position relationship or timing of the camshaft and crankshaft needs to be maintained accurately.</p>
    <p num="5">
      Traditionally in the past, "link" or bicycle chain type timing chains, sometimes utilizing double side by side chains, have been used in car engines to couple the crankshaft to the camshaft, using a driven camshaft sprocket having twice as many teeth as a driving crankshaft sprocket.
      <br/>
      In some engines, a timing gear train has been used to drive the camshaft from the crankshaft.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      Chains and gears are both capable of driving a camshaft while maintaining the required timing relationship between the camshaft and the crankshaft.
      <br/>
      However, the high cost of chain and gear drives and, to some extent, their operating noise level have more recently led to the widespread use of toothed belts for coupling the crankshaft and the camshaft in automotive engines, particularly in smaller engines.
      <br/>
      A toothed belt drive is quiet and well suited to driving the camshaft while maintaining the required timing relationship to the crankshaft.
      <br/>
      The same timing belt drive may also be used to drive, for example, a fuel injection pump, an ignition distributor, or some other accessory.
    </p>
    <p num="7">Examples of toothed belt and timing chain drives may be found in, for example, U.S. Pat. No. 5,463,898 entitled METHOD OF DETECTING TIMING APPARATUS MALFUNCTION IN AN ENGINE issued Nov. 7, 1995 in the name of Blander et al.; and</p>
    <p num="8">U.S. Pat. No. 5,689,067 entitled DIAGNOSTIC METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR MONITORING THE WEAR OF AT LEAST AN ENGINE TIMING CHAIN issued Nov. 18, 1997 in the name of Klein et al., whereof the disclosure is herein incorporated by reference to the extent it is not incompatible with the present invention.</p>
    <p num="9">
      While a toothed timing belt drive offers advantages, the likelihood of belt failure is present.
      <br/>
      If a timing belt breaks in such an engine, the camshaft will very soon stop rotating, while the crankshaft will typically continue to turn for a time, either due to its rotational momentum and/or because it is coupled to the driving wheels which continue to turn because of the vehicle's momentum.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      In some cases, repairing the engine following such a timing belt failure may merely require realigning the camshaft and the crankshaft into proper relationship and replacing the belt.
      <br/>
      Naturally, the vehicle will be inoperable until the belt is replaced, generally in a repair shop, and the operator may be stranded.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, since a broken timing belt can cause instant and total loss of power at an unexpected moment, a potentially hazardous traffic situation can result.
    </p>
    <p num="11">However, in a number of engines utilizing a high compression ratio, clearance space at the top of the cylinders may be very restricted such that the pistons can only move freely to the top of their stroke with valves in the closed position.</p>
    <p num="12">
      In such an engine, if the crankshaft is rotating and the camshaft stops so that a valve is held open by its cam, interference between a piston and a stopped valve can occur so that a piston can collide with the stopped valve.
      <br/>
      This generally leads to extensive damage, and possibly ruining the engine so that the cost of repair is no longer economically justifiable.
      <br/>
      The likelihood that the problem of valve/piston interference will occur in at least one cylinder of such an engine is generally very high upon loss of a timing belt.
    </p>
    <p num="13">When such interference occurs after timing belt breakage, damage may range from a bent valve, and/or a hole in a piston, damage to a cylinder head and/or a camshaft, a gouged cylinder head, to a completely ruined engine.</p>
    <p num="14">
      As was stated above, the problem of serious damage following timing belt failure is very likely to occur in high compression ratio engines.
      <br/>
      These include many high-performance engines and compression-ignition or "diesel" engines wherein the very high compression ratio needed for ignition generally leaves insufficient room for a piston to avoid hitting a valve held open by an inoperative camshaft.
      <br/>
      Despite the problems consequent on timing belt failure, car manufacturers continue to build such "interference engines" which exhibit the problem, apparently because a "free-running engine" with enough clearance results in lower performance.
      <br/>
      The problem represents a weak point in engine reliability and, given the usually catastrophic damage resulting from timing belt failure, is likely to result in lowering of customer confidence in the product.
    </p>
    <p num="15">
      The problem of serious damage caused by timing belt failure in automotive engines has been addressed to some extent by maintenance schedules for periodically replacing toothed timing belts in such engines at an interval based on the average life expectancy of such belts.
      <br/>
      For example, an extensive list of "interference engines", that is, engines where serious damage is likely following timing belt failure, was made available by The Gates Rubber Company on the Internet at the address http://www.gates.com/interfer.html.
      <br/>
      Manufacturer's service manuals generally suggest periodic replacement of the belt as precautionary maintenance every 60,000 to 80,000 miles of driving or so.
    </p>
    <p num="16">
      However, even periodic scheduled belt replacement can, at best, only reduce the average probability of belt failure: an individual belt may exhibit a shorter operating life than the average and, even with a new belt installed, initial failure remains a possibility, resulting in expensive damage to an engine.
      <br/>
      Generally, the timing belt in a typical automotive engine is not readily visible to the operator and regular inspection to ascertain the condition of a timing belt is inconvenient, even if it were a reliable way of predicting failure.
    </p>
    <p num="17">
      Typically, timing belt replacement as a maintenance service requires to be performed by qualified personnel in a repair shop and so is not an inexpensive job.
      <br/>
      In practice, it may not always be performed at the recommended intervals.
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      The problem of belt failure has been addressed in, for example, U.S. Pat. No. 4,488,363 entitled COMBINATION IDLER AND BELT FAILURE SWITCH FOR A DRYER issued Dec. 18, 1984 in the name of Jackson et al., whereof the disclosure is herein incorporated by reference to the extent it is not incompatible with the present invention.
      <br/>
      In this patent, an arrangement is disclosed for terminating the operation of a dryer upon breakage of the drive belt.
      <br/>
      It is herein recognized that such an approach will not be useful in avoiding damage due to timing belt failure in an automotive engine, since failure of the timing belt may cause damage to follow immediately upon belt failure and the engine cannot practicably be stopped before the damage has taken place.
    </p>
    <p num="19">It is herein recognized that the mere use of a warning device to indicate failure of the timing belt will be futile to prevent damage since the operator cannot stop rotation of the engine following such a warning in time to prevent damage.</p>
    <p num="20">
      It is also herein recognized that while the use of duplicate or double timing belts in itself does provide somewhat greater security than using one belt alone, it does not alone solve the problem of potential damage to the engine.
      <br/>
      With the mere use of two belts, one belt can fail unbeknownst to the operator who will generally have no knowledge that the engine is operating on one belt alone.
      <br/>
      In that situation, the engine will continue to operate in an apparently normal manner and it can therefore continue to be operated until the second belt fails.
      <br/>
      When that happens, damage to engine will occur, in the known manner hereinabove described.

      It is not necessary to the present invention that pulley portions 14 and 16 have identical numbers of teeth; it is permissible to use different sizes and/or different numbers of teeth for the pulley portions; it is only necessary that pulley portion 26 have twice as many teeth as pulley portion 14 and that pulley portion 28 have twice as many teeth as pulley portion 16.
      <br/>
      It is herein recognized that in certain situations, such as to help prevent cogging, meaning non-uniform angular velocity in the camshaft, or tooth slipping, there may be an advantage to using different pitches, different sizes, and/or different numbers of teeth on the pulley portions.
      <br/>
      When pulley portions 14 and 16 have the same number of teeth and the same pitch, then the same type and size of belt can be used in both positions.
      <br/>
      The exemplary embodiments described are shown with equal pulley portions 26 and 28, though as was explained, they can be different.
    </p>
    <p num="38">
      It is also common to employ one or more idler pulleys, spring-loaded or fixed, for tensioning the timing belt, usually on the slack side, as shown in FIG. 7, where idler pulley 70 runs with its surface engaging the back or untoothed side of belt 18.
      <br/>
      Idler pulley 72, aligned behind pulley 70 engages belt 20, which is aligned behind belt 18.
      <br/>
      Pulleys 16 and 28 and belt 20 coincide in the drawing with pulleys 14 and 26 and belt 18, respectively.
    </p>
    <p num="39">It is also herein recognized that the belts can be made of different widths or strengths so that the weaker belt will always tend to break earlier, thereby reducing even further the already remote chance of simultaneous failure of both belts.</p>
    <p num="40">
      While the described preferred embodiment has the advantage of using regular toothed belts and not requiring any special type of belt, it is also possible to utilize a special unitary belt which in effect uses two or more side by side belt portions 818 and 820 joined by a web 819, as shown in end view cross-section in FIG. 8.
      <br/>
      The belt portions may be of different widths as shown in FIG 8A and/or different strengths as shown in FIG. 8B. The web is of sufficient strength so as to retain fragments of a broken belt portion while continuing to run on the remaining belt portion so that a baffle is not required.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, when the belts are made of quite different widths or different strengths or both so that one is clearly likely to fail first, then it is sufficient in accordance with the invention to detect only failure of the weaker belt.
      <br/>
      However, the cost of monitoring both belts is relatively little more than monitoring both belts so that it is preferred to monitor both.
    </p>
    <p num="41">
      In accordance with the principles of the present invention, the engine has two modes of operation: a first mode of operation, running with two timing belts and a second mode of operation, running on one timing belt alone.
      <br/>
      In both modes, operation of the engine is normal except that, in the second mode, there is a high risk of catastrophic damage following failure of the single timing belt.
      <br/>
      In accordance with the principles of the present invention, a sensing device warns the operator when the engine is operating in the second mode, that is, on one timing belt alone.
      <br/>
      The operator is thereby warned that belt replacement is necessary during this critical second mode of operation, thereby providing an opportunity to do this before damage to the engine has occurred.
    </p>
    <p num="42">
      In operation, belts 18 and 20 operate in parallel to convey rotation of crankshaft 17 to camshaft 22 which runs at half the rpm or angular velocity of crankshaft 17.
      <br/>
      Belts 18 and 20, being toothed belts running over toothed pulleys serve also to maintain an exact angular relationship between crankshaft 17 and camshaft 22 so that the engine cams operate the engine valves, such as inlet and exhaust valves, in proper sequence and relationship to piston strokes.
      <br/>
      The velocity ratio between the crankshaft and the camshaft has to be the same for both belt drives.
    </p>
    <p num="43">
      As has been explained, in an interference type of engine, the valves are arranged to be substantially in closed position when the respective piston is at the top of its stroke.
      <br/>
      This avoids the possibility of collision or interference between piston and valves while the engine is running normally.
    </p>
    <p num="44">
      Belt presence sensing unit 38 senses the presence of both belts 18 and 20 during normal operation, when the belts are in their respective normal operating positions, and is arranged to cause alarm unit 39 to signal that the engine is operating in its first operating mode: the normal, safe operating condition.
      <br/>
      However, should either of belts 18 and 20 break, belt presence sensing unit is arranged to cause alarm unit 39 to indicate that the engine is operating in its second operating mode, indicating that belt servicing is required as soon as practicable.
    </p>
    <p num="45">
      The broken pieces of whichever of the two belts 18 and 20 has broken are prevented by baffle plate assembly 30 from interfering with the remaining good belt, which continues in operation and allows the engine to continue operating normally without damage.
      <br/>
      The vehicle may continue to be operated normally, though now at risk of damage should the remaining timing belt break.
      <br/>
      Service should therefore be performed as soon as practicable to replace the broken belt so as to keep this period of risk as short as possible.
      <br/>
      As a preventative maintenance measure, the remaining operating belt can also be economically replaced with a new belt while the belt area is accessible during the repair procedure.
    </p>
    <p num="46">
      Theoretically, both belts could break simultaneously; however such an occurrence is highly unlikely, as compared with the chance of one belt alone breaking at any given moment.
      <br/>
      Following breakage of one belt, it will generally be reasonably safe to drive the vehicle for an additional reasonable length of time until an opportunity is available to replace the damaged belt.
      <br/>
      Since the operator has then been alerted in accordance with the invention that the engine is operating in the second mode, the less safe mode of the two modes possible in accordance with the invention, the repair can be made at an early opportunity so as to operate the engine in its second mode as little as reasonably possible.

      In the case of the embodiments of FIGS. 9 and 10, the presence of the belt under the follower maintains switches 80 or 90 in the OFF position.
      <br/>
      In the event the belt is absent, spring loaded arm 81 or 91 moves as urged by its spring loading and the switch moves to the ON position, thereby electrically actuating an alarm light or a sound alarm, alerting an operator that the engine is operating in its second, or less safe mode, of the two modes possible in accordance with the invention.

      In the event belt 18 is missing, follower 18 is urged by spring arm 100 against the teeth on pulley 26.
      <br/>
      Rotation of pulley 26 causes follower 102 and spring arm 100 to vibrate strongly as the teeth pass the follower.

      While the invention has been described by way of illustrative embodiments, it will be apparent to one of skill in the art that various changes and modifications may be made within the spirit of the invention.
      <br/>
      Thus, the invention has been illustrated by examples from the automotive engine field; the invention is also applicable to other drive systems where drive failure may have serious consequences.
      <br/>
      While 4-stroke cycle operation has been generally described in connection with the exemplary embodiments, it will be understood that the invention is applicable to engines having a different operating cycle, such as a 2-stroke cycle.
      <br/>
      In such cases the angular velocity relationship between a crankshaft and a camshaft may be different, such as a one-to-one ratio.
      <br/>
      It is further noted that whereas a two belt system is described, the invention can encompass any other plurality of drives.
      <br/>
      Three or more belts may be used if desired.
      <br/>
      Moreover, where for example, an optical or light signal is described as in the embodiment of FIG. 7, clearly an acoustic signal may be used or an interlock for disabling the engine after a predetermined period of time, if such is deemed desirable.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, the use of any of a number of known suitable systems for indication belt failure is contemplated for the invention.
      <br/>
      While toothed timing belts have been used in the exemplary embodiments described, it is of course possible to use equivalents such as perforated belts where the pulleys have pins or stubs to engage the perforations in the belts; however, such drives are less common.
