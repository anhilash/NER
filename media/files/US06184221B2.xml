    <p num="5">
      In pharmaceutical chemistry, the 4-acylaminochroman derivatives class has been worked on intensively in recent years.
      <br/>
      The most prominent representative of this class is cromakalim of the formula A (J.
      <br/>
      Chem. Soc. Perkin Trans. 1, 1991, 63-70).  (Chemical Structure image '3' not included in text)
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      Cromakalim and other related 4-acylaminochroman derivatives are compounds having a relaxant action on smooth muscular organs, so that they are used for lowering raised blood pressure as a result of vascular muscle relaxation and in the treatment of asthma as a result of the relaxation of the smooth musculature of the airways.
      <br/>
      It is common to all these preparations that they act at the cellular level, for example, of smooth muscle cells and lead there to an opening of specific ATP-sensitive K+ channels.
      <br/>
      The increase in negative charge in the cell (hyperpolarization) induced by the efflux of K+ ions counteracts via secondary mechanisms the increase in the intracellular Ca2+ concentration and thus cell activation which leads, for example, to muscle contraction.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      Similar structures to those of the formula I, the so-called pyranopyridines (formula B), are described in the literature.
      <br/>
      However, we are also dealing here exclusively with 4-acylamino derivatives, which likewise have K-ATP channel-blocking properties.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      The compounds of the formula I according to the invention differ structurally from these acylamino derivatives, inter alia by the replacement of the acylamino group by a sulfonylamino function.
      <br/>
      While cromakalim (formula A) and analogous acylamino compounds act as openers of ATP-sensitive K+ channels, the compounds of the formula I according to the invention having the sulfonylamino structure, however, do not show any opening action on this K+ (ATP) channel, but surprisingly show a strong and specific blocking (closing) action on a K+ channel which is opened by cyclic adenosine monophosphate (CAMP) and differs fundamentally from the K+ (ATP) channel mentioned.
      <br/>
      More recent investigations show that this K+ (cAMP) channel identified in colonic tissue is very similar, perhaps even identical, to the IKs channel identified in the cardiac muscle.
      <br/>
      In fact, it was possible, for the compounds of the formula I according to the invention, to show a strong blocking action on the IKs channel in guinea-pig cardio-myocytes and on the IsK channel expressed in Xenopus oocytes.
      <br/>
      As a result of this blocking of the K+ (cAMP) channel or of the IKs channel, the compounds according to the invention display pharmacological actions of high therapeutic utility in the living body.

    <p num="64">
      Procedure a) describes the reaction of a sulfonamide or of one of its salts of the formula III with a reactive heterocycle of the formula II.
      <br/>
      As the reaction of a sulfonamide III is carried out from the salt form, when using a free sulfonamide (formula III, M.dbd.H) a sulfonamide salt which is distinguished by higher nucleophilicity and thus by higher reactivity must be generated (formula III, M=cation) by the action of a base.
      <br/>
      If free sulfonamide (M.dbd.H) is employed, the deprotonation of the sulfonamide to the salt is carried out in situ, preferably using those bases which are not alkylated or only slightly alkylated themselves, such as sodium carbonate, potassium carbonate, a sterically strongly hindered amine, e.g. dicyclohexylamine, N,N,N-dicyclohexylethylamine or other strong nitrogen bases with low nucleophilicity, for example DBU, N,N',N"'-triisopropylguanidine, etc.
      <br/>
      However, it is also possible to employ other customarily used bases for the reaction, such as potassium tert-butoxide, sodium methoxide, alkali metal hydrogencarbonates, alkali metal hydroxides, such as, for example, LiOH, NaOH or KOH, or alkaline earth metal hydroxides, for example Ca(OH)2.
    </p>
    <p num="65">
      The reaction is preferably carried out in polar organic solvents such as dimethylformamide, dimethylacetamide, tetramethylurea, hexamethylphosphoramide, tetrahydrofuran, dimethoxyethane, toluene, a halogenated hydrocarbon such as chloroform or methylene chloride, etc.
      <br/>
      However, the reaction can also be carried out in polar protic solvents, such as water, methanol, ethanol, isopropanol, ethylene glycol or its oligomers and their corresponding hemiethers and ethers.
      <br/>
      The reaction is carried out in a preferred temperature range from -10 to 140 (degree)  C., particularly preferably from 20 to 100 (degree)  C. Favorably, procedure a) can also be carried out under the conditions of a two-phase catalysis.
    </p>
    <p num="66">The compounds of the formula II are obtained by methods known from the literature, for example from the corresponding unsaturated compound of formula X  (Chemical Structure image '11' not included in text)</p>

      by the action of an inorganic or organic peroxide, such as, for example, H2 O2, MCPBA, peracetic acid.
      <br/>
      The addition of halogen/OH is also possible by the reaction of X with NCS, NBS, chlorine or bromine in aqueous solvents.
      <br/>
      In the case of the epoxide (R(7) and L form an epoxide ring), this can be prepared from the hydrohalide by elimination of H-halogen using various bases.
      <br/>
      Advantageously, the reaction is carried out in a solvent which is sufficiently inert to these halogenating or oxidizing reagents, such as, for example, in DMSO or halogenated hydrocarbons, such as, for example, chloroform, methylene chloride.
    </p>
    <p num="68">Procedure b) describes the reaction, which is known per se and frequently used, of a reactive sulfonyl compound of the formula V, in particular of a chlorosulfonyl compound (W.dbd.Cl), with an amino derivative of the formula IV to give the corresponding sulfonamide derivative of the formula I. In principle, the reaction can be carried out without solvent, but reactions of this type are in most cases carried out using a solvent.</p>

      The reaction is preferably carried out using a polar solvent, preferably in the presence of a base which can advantageously be used as a solvent itself, e.g. when using triethylamine, in particular pyridine and its homologs.

      Solvents likewise used are, for example, water, aliphatic alcohols, e.g. methanol, ethanol, isopropanol, sec-butanol, ethylene glycol and its monomeric and oligomeric monoalkyl and dialkyl ethers, tetrahydrofuran, dioxane, dialkylated amides such as DMF, DMA, and also TMU and HMPT.
      <br/>
      The reaction is in this case carried out at a temperature from 0 to 160 (degree)  C., preferably from 20 to 100 (degree)  C.

    <p num="77">
      It has already been said that the compounds of the formula I surprisingly have a strong and specific blocking (closing) action on a K+ channel which is opened by cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) and fundamentally differs from the well-known K+ (ATP) channel, and that this K+ (cAMP) channel identified in colonic tissue is very similar, perhaps even identical, to the IKs channel identified in the cardiac muscle.
      <br/>
      For the compounds according to the invention, it was possible to show a strong blocking action on the IKs channel in guinea-pig cardiomyocytes and on the IsK channel expressed in Xenopus oocytes.
      <br/>
      As a result of this blocking of the K+ (cAMP) channel or of the IKs channel, the compounds according to the invention display pharmacological actions of high therapeutic utility in the living body and are outstandingly suitable as pharmaceutical active compounds for the therapy and prophylaxis of various syndromes.
    </p>
    <p num="78">The compounds of the formula I according to the invention are thus distinguished as a novel active compound class of potent inhibitors of stimulated gastric acid secretion.</p>
    <p num="79">
      The compounds of the formula I are thus useful pharmaceutical active compounds for the therapy and prophylaxis of ulcers of the stomach and of the intestinal region, for example of the duodenum.
      <br/>
      They are likewise suitable, on account of their strong gastric secretion-inhibiting action, as excellent therapeutics for the therapy and prophylaxis of reflux esophagitis.
    </p>
    <p num="80">The compounds of the formula I according to the invention are furthermore distinguished by an antidiarrheal action and are therefore suitable as pharmaceutical active compounds for the therapy and prophylaxis of diarrheal illnesses.</p>
    <p num="81">
      The compounds of the formula I according to the invention are furthermore suitable as pharmaceutical active compounds for the therapy and prophylaxis of cardiovascular disorders.
      <br/>
      In particular, they can be used for the therapy and prophylaxis of all types of arrhythmias, including atrial, ventricular and supraventricular arrhythmias, especially cardiac arrhythmias which can be eliminated by action potential prolongation.
      <br/>
      They can be specifically used for the therapy and prophylaxis of atrial fibrillation and atrial flutters, and for the therapy and prophylaxis of reentry arrhythmias and for the prevention of sudden heart death as a result of ventricular fibrillation.
    </p>
    <p num="82">Although numerous substances having antiarrhythmic activity are already on the market, there is nevertheless no compound which is really satisfactory with respect to activity, range of application and side-effect profile, so that there is furthermore a need for the development of improved antiarrhythmics.</p>
    <p num="83">
      The action of numerous known antiarrhythmics of the so-called class IlIl is based on an increase in the myocardial refractory time by prolongation of the action potential duration.
      <br/>
      This is essentially determined by the extent of repolarizing K+ streams which flow out of the cell via various K+ channels.
      <br/>
      Particularly great importance is ascribed in this context to the so-called "delayed rectifier" IK, of which two subtypes exist, a rapidly activated IKr and a slowly activated IKs.
      <br/>
      Most known class III antiarrhythmics block IKr predominantly or exclusively (e.g. dofetilide, d-sotalol).
      <br/>
      It has been shown, however, that these compounds have an increased proarrhythmic risk at low or normal heart rates, arrhythmias which are designated as "Torsades de pointes" in particular being observed (D. M. Roden; "Current Status of Class III Antiarrhythmic Drug Therapy"; Am. J. Cardiol. 72 (1993), 44B-49B).
      <br/>
      In the case of higher heart rates or stimulation of the  BETA -receptors, however, the action potential-prolonging action of the IKr blockers is markedly reduced, which is attributed to the fact that under these conditions the IKs contributes more strongly to the repolarization.
      <br/>
      For these reasons, the substances according to the invention, which act as IKs blockers, have significant advantages compared with the known IKr blockers.
      <br/>
      In the meantime, it has also been described that a correlation exists between IKs channel-inhibitory action and the suppression of life-threatening cardiac arrhythmias, such as are elicited, for example, by  BETA -adrenergic hyperstimulation (e.g. T. J. Colatsky, C. H. Follmer and C. F. Starmer; "Channel Specificity in Antiarrhythmic Drug Action; Mechanism of potassium channel block and its role in suppressing and aggravating cardiac arrhythmias"; Circulation 82 (1990), 2235-2242; A. E. Busch, K. Malloy, W. J. Groh, M. D. Varnum, J. P. Adelman and J. Maylie; "The novel class III antiarrhythmics NE-10064 and NE-10133 inhibit IsK channels in Xenopus oocytes and IKs in guinea pig cardiac myocytes"; Biochem.
      <br/>
      Biophys. Res. Commun. 202 (1994), 265-270).
    </p>
    <p num="84">Moreover, the compounds contribute to a marked improvement of cardiac insufficiency, in particular of congestive heart failure, advantageously in combination with contraction-promoting (positively inotropic) active compounds, e.g. phosphodiesterase inhibitors.</p>
    <p num="85">
      In spite of the therapeutically utilizable advantages which can be achieved by a blockade of the IKs, hitherto only very few compounds have been described which inhibit this subtype of the "delayed rectifier".
      <br/>
      The substance azimilide which is in development admittedly also has a blocking action on the IKS, but mainly blocks the IKr (selectivity 1:10).
      <br/>
      WO-A-95/14470 claims the use of benzodiazepines as selective blockers of the IKs.
      <br/>
      Further IKs blockers are described in FEBS Letters 396 (1996), 271-275: "Specific blockade of slowly activating IsK channels by chromanols . . . " and Pflugers, Arch.--Eur. J. Physiol. 429 (1995), 517-530: "A new class of inhibitors of cAMP-mediated Cl- secretion in rabbit colon, acting by the reduction of cAMP-activated K+ conductance." The water solubility of the compounds described there, however, is less than that of the compounds of the present invention.
    </p>
    <p num="86">
      The compounds of the formula I according to the invention and their physiologically tolerable salts can thus be used in animals, preferably in mammals, and in particular in humans, as pharmaceuticals per se, in mixtures with one another, or in the form of pharmaceutical preparations.
      <br/>
      The present invention also relates to the compounds of the formula I and their physiologically tolerable salts for use as pharmaceuticals, their use in the therapy and prophylaxis of the syndromes mentioned and their use for the production of medicaments therefor and of medicaments with K+ channel-blocking action.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, the present invention relates to pharmaceutical compositions which as active constituent contain an effective dose of at least one compound of the formula I and/or of a physiologically tolerable salt thereof in addition to customary, pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, innocuous excipients and auxiliaries.
      <br/>
      The pharmaceutical preparations normally contain 0.1 to 90 percent by weight of the compounds of the formula I and/or of their physiologically tolerable salts.
      <br/>
      The pharmaceutical preparations can be prepared in a manner known per se.
      <br/>
      For this purpose, the compounds of the formula I and/or their physiologically tolerable salts, together with one or more solid or liquid pharmaceutical excipients and/or auxiliaries and, if desired, in combination with other pharmaceutical active compounds, are brought into a suitable administration form or dosage form which can then be used as a pharmaceutical in human medicine or veterinary medicine.
    </p>
    <p num="87">Pharmaceuticals which contain compounds of the formula I according to the invention and/or their physiologically tolerable salts can be administered orally, parenterally, e.g. intravenously, rectally, by inhalation or topically, the preferred administration being dependent on the individual case, e.g. the particular course of the illness to be treated.</p>
    <p num="88">
      The person skilled in the art is familiar on the basis of his expert knowledge with the auxiliaries which are suitable for the desired pharmaceutical formulation.
      <br/>
      Beside solvents, gel-forming agents, suppository bases, tablet auxiliaries and other active compound carriers, it is possible to use, for example, antioxidants, dispersants, emulsifiers, antifoams, flavor corrigents, preservatives, solubilizers, agents for achieving a depot effect, buffer substances or colorants.
    </p>
    <p num="89">
      The compounds of the formula I can also be combined with other pharmaceutical active compounds to achieve an advantageous therapeutic effect.
      <br/>
      Thus in the treatment of cardiovascular disorders advantageous combinations with substances having cardiovascular activity are possible.
      <br/>
      Possible combination components of this type which are advantageous for cardiovascular disorders are, for example, other antiarrhythmics, i.e. class I, class II or class III antiarrhythmics, such as, for example IKr channel blockers, e.g. dofetilide, or furthermore hypotensive substances such as ACE inhibitors (for example enalapril, captopril, ramipril), angiotensin antagonists, K+ channel activators and also alpha- and beta-receptor blockers, but also sympathomimetic compounds and compounds having adrenergic activity, and also Na+ /H+ exchange inhibitors, calcium channel antagonists, phosphodiesterase inhibitors and other substances having positively inotropic activity, such as, for example, digitalis glycosides, or diuretics.
      <br/>
      Combinations with substances having antibiotic activity and with antiulcer agents are furthermore advantageous, for example with H2 antagonists (e.g. ranitidine, cimetidine, famotidine, etc.), in particular when used for the treatment of gastrointestinal disorders.
    </p>
    <p num="90">
      For an oral administration form, the active compounds are mixed with the additives suitable for this purpose, such as excipients, stabilizers or inert diluents, and brought by the customary methods into the suitable administration forms, such as tablets, coated tablets, hard capsules, aqueous, alcoholic or oily solutions.
      <br/>
      Inert excipients which can be used are, for example, gum arabic, magnesia, magnesium carbonate, potassium phosphate, lactose, glucose or starch, in particular corn starch.
      <br/>
      In this case the preparation can be carried out either as dry or as moist granules.
      <br/>
      Suitable oily excipients or solvents are, for example, vegetable or animal oils, such as sunflower oil or cod-liver oil.
      <br/>
      Suitable solvents for aqueous or alcoholic solutions are, for example, water, ethanol or sugar solutions or mixtures thereof.
      <br/>
      Further auxiliaries, also for other administration forms, are, for example, polyethylene glycols and polypropylene glycols.
    </p>
    <p num="91">
      For subcutaneous or intravenous administration, the active compounds, if desired with the substances customary for this such as solubilizers, emulsifiers or further auxiliaries, are brought into solution, suspension or emulsion.
      <br/>
      The compounds of the formula I and their physiologically tolerable salts can also be lyophilized and the lyophilizates obtained can be used, for example, for the production of injection or infusion preparations.
      <br/>
      Suitable solvents are, for example, water, physiological saline solution or alcohols, e.g. ethanol, propanol, glycerol, in addition also sugar solutions such as glucose or mannitol solutions, or alternatively mixtures of the various solvents mentioned.
    </p>
    <p num="92">
      Suitable pharmaceutical formulations for administration in the form of aerosols or sprays are, for example, solutions, suspensions or emulsions of the active compounds of the formula I or their physiologically tolerable salts in a pharmaceutically acceptable solvent, such as, in particular, ethanol or water, or a mixture of such solvents.
      <br/>
      If required, the formulation can also additionally contain other pharmaceutical auxiliaries such as surfactants, emulsifiers and stabilizers as well as a propellant.
      <br/>
      Such a preparation contains the active compound customarily in a concentration from approximately 0.1 to 10, in particular from approximately 0.3 to 3 percent by weight.
    </p>
    <p num="93">
      The dose of the active compound of the formula I or of the physiologically tolerable salts thereof to be administered depends on the individual case and, as customary, is to be adapted for an optimum effect to the conditions of the individual case.
      <br/>
      Thus it depends, of course, on the frequency of administration and on the potency and duration of action of the compounds employed in each case for therapy or prophylaxis, but also on the nature and severity of the disease to be treated and on the sex, age, weight and individual responsiveness of the human or animal to be treated and on whether the therapy is acute or prophylactic.
      <br/>
      Customarily, the daily dose of a compound of the formula I in the case of administration to a patient approximately 75 kg in weight is at least 0.001 mg/kg of body weight, preferably at least 0.01 mg/kg of body weight, in particular at least 0.1 mg/kg of body weight, up to at most 100 mg/kg of body weight, preferably up to at most 20 mg/kg of body weight, in particular up to at most 1 mg/kg of body weight.
      <br/>
      In other words, the preferred dose range is from about 0.001 to about 100 mg/kg, more preferrably from about 0.01 to about 20 mg/kg, most preferrably from about 0.1 to about 1 mg/kg.
      <br/>
      The dose can be administered in the form of an individual dose or divided into several, e.g. two, three or four, individual doses.
      <br/>
      In particular in the treatment of acute cases of cardiac arrhythmias, for example in an intensive care unit, parenteral administration by injection or infusion, e.g. by an intravenous continuous infusion, can also be advantageous.
    </p>
    <p num="94">
      The compounds of the formula I and their physiologically tolerable salts selectively inhibit K+ (cAMP) channels and IKs channels.
      <br/>
      On account of this property, apart from use as pharmaceutical active compounds in human medicine and veterinary medicine, they can also be employed as a scientific tool or as aids for biochemical investigations in which an effect on potassium channels is intended, and also for diagnostic purposes, e.g. in the in vitro diagnosis of cell or tissue samples.
      <br/>
      They can further be employed, as already mentioned above, as intermediates for the preparation of other pharmaceutical active compounds.
