      A bone fixation device, e.g., a pedicle screw or hook, having a threaded head is secured to a rod by a coupler comprising a pair of elements, one having a bifurcated body with rod receiving bores and a flange with a bore for receiving the threaded head.
      <br/>
      A second element has a body between the bifurcated body portions hinged to the other element by a pivot pin.
      <br/>
      A flange with a head receiving bore extends from the second element body juxtaposed and aligned with the other element flange bore.
      <br/>
      The second element body has a rod receiving bore offset relative to the rod receiving bores of the body portions.
      <br/>
      A nut screwed to the head clamps the overlying pivoting flanges together clamping the pivoting offset rod bores to the received rod.
      <br/>
      In a second embodiment, the second element body is a hook.
      <br/>
      The hook and body portions form offset rod receiving openings pivoting about the received rod and which clamp the rod when the flanges are clamped together via the nut and head.
      <br/>
      A guide rod screwed to an internal bore of the head of a fixation device secured to a bone to be corrected guides a nut and wrench for attachment of the nut to the head, displacing the bone toward the rod fixed position during tightening.

    <p num="2">
      Spinal fixation apparatuses are widely employed in surgical processes for correcting for spinal injury and diseases.
      <br/>
      These apparatuses employ longitudinal link rods secured to coupling elements which elements in turn are secured to the bone such as vertebrae by spinal bone fixation fasteners such as pedicle screws, hooks and others.
      <br/>
      Transverse bridge elements connect parallel rods which extend along the spinal column, the rods being connected by the bridge elements to opposing sides of the spinal column portion being corrected.
      <br/>
      These apparatuses are supplied for posterior internal use and require flexibility in surgical implantation to facilitate the surgery and maximize the corrective action with minimum patient discomfort.

      The body 116 comprises two generally parallel legs 120 and 122 connected by and extending from a circular segment 124.
      <br/>
      The segment 124 and legs form an open sided through bore 124' having a longitudinal axis 126.
      <br/>
      The segment comprises a portion of a circular cylinder having a diameter about the same as the diameter of the bores 102, 104.
      <br/>
      The legs 120 and 122 are thus spaced apart a distance of the diameter of the bores 102, 104.

    <p num="36">
      The axis 93 of the bores 102, 104 of the body portions and axis 126 of the segment 124 bore 124' are misaligned by preferably about 2-4 mm distance d, FIG. 13a, when the respective flanges 96 and 118 of the elements 84, 86 are juxtaposed in the position of FIGS. 10 and 13a.
      <br/>
      This misalignment causes the rod 4 to be clamped by leg 120 and body portions 90 and 92, FIG. 13a as the flanges 96 and 118 are forced toward each other by the attached pedicle screw 112 in the flange bores 108 and 130, FIGS. 13 and 13a.
      <br/>
      As the nut 103 is tightened the flanges are forced together.

      <br/>
      The screw 172 has a coupler 177 support shoulder 178.
      <br/>
      The shoulder receives and supports the flange 179 of the coupler 177.
      <br/>
      The screw 172 has an externally threaded head 180 extending from the shoulder 178.
    </p>
    <p num="44">
      A threaded bore 182 is in the head 180 on the screw axis 184.
      <br/>
      The coupler 177 is fixed to a link fixation rod 186 by screw 188.
      <br/>
      The coupler 177 has a bore 190 for receiving the head 180.
      <br/>
      In practice the coupler bore 190 is engaged somewhat with the head 180 after the screw 172 is attached to the bone.
      <br/>
      The spacing between the coupler and the pedicle screw 172 is exaggerated in the drawing for purposes of illustration.
    </p>
    <p num="45">
      A nut 192 for engaging the external threads of the head 180 is placed on the flange 179 aligned over the bore 190.
      <br/>
      The nut 192 has a polygon or other faceted exterior surface.
      <br/>
      The exterior surface receives a keyed mating core 194 of a tubular elongated preferably metal wrench 196 having an externally faceted handle 198, FIG. 19b. An elongated guide rod 200 has a threaded tip 202 which is temporarily engaged with the threaded bore 182 of the head 180, FIG. 19b.
    </p>
    <p num="46">
      It should be understood that in FIG. 19b the coupler 177 bore 190 in practice has received the head 180 of the screw 172 at this juncture of the assembly procedure.
      <br/>
      The coupler flange 179 however is spaced above the shoulder 178 of the pedicle screw 172.
      <br/>
      The reason for this spacing is due to the bone 174 at this location is deformed relative to other next adjacent bones of the spinal column in this region of the spine.
      <br/>
      What is desired is to straighten the bone 174 at this location by pulling the bone 174 toward the rod 186, direction 204.
      <br/>
      The rod 186 and coupler 177 in all of the FIGS. 19a-19c is fixed in the plane 206.
    </p>
    <p num="47">
      The guide rod 200 guides the nut onto the threaded screw head 180 and permits the surgeon to tighten the nut 192 with the elongated wrench handle 198.
      <br/>
      As the nut 192 is tightened, the screw action pulls the pedicle screw 172 and the bone 174 toward the plane 206.
      <br/>
      The guide rod 200, previously attached to the pedicle screw head 180 bore, has an outer diameter that is closely received in the nut 192 threaded bore for guiding the nut onto the screw head 180.
    </p>
    <p num="48">
      This guiding action provides axial alignment of the nut threads to the screw head 180 threads.
      <br/>
      This enhances the attachment of the nut 192 threads to the head threads and minimizes crossed threads and the resulting problems of reattaching different nuts and minimizing the possibility of stripping the pedicle screw head 180 threads.
      <br/>
      Thus the assembly of the pedicle screw of FIG. 15 is facilitated by the guide rod 200 and wrench 198.

    <p num="49">
      Pedicle screws and bone hooks may all be selectively attached to correct a bone deficiency employing the tool of FIGS. 19a-19c. For example, the bone hook 78 of FIG. 20 has a threaded bore 206 in its externally threaded head 208.

      <br/>
      The nut is slipped over the guide rod and the tool 196 slipped over the guide rod 200 and engaged with the nut.
      <br/>
      The nut is then engaged with the head threads and the hook drawn toward the coupler's fixed position established by the fixation link rod.
