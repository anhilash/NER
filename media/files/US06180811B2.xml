      A process for continuously reducing the amount of cyclic organosiloxane in a recirculating process stream.
      <br/>
      The process comprises washing a process stream in a wash step to reduce chloride content of the process stream, distilling the process stream into a low-boiling fraction comprising low molecular weight cyclic organosiloxanes and an inert solvent and a high-boiling fraction comprising linear organosiloxanes and high molecular weight cyclic organosiloxanes, and reequilibrating the overhead low-boiling fraction in the presence of a reequilibration catalyst to form a reequilibration mixture comprising high molecular weight cyclic organosiloxanes and the inert solvent, and recycling the reequilibration mixture to the wash step.

    <heading>BACKGROUND OF INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="1">
      The present invention is a process for continuously reducing the amount of low molecular weight cyclic organosiloxane in a recirculating process stream.
      <br/>
      The process comprises washing a process stream in a wash step to reduce chloride content of the process stream, distilling the process stream into a fraction comprising low molecular weight cyclic organosiloxanes and an inert solvent and a high-boiling fraction comprising linear organosiloxanes and high molecular weight cyclic organosiloxanes and reequilibrating the low-boiling fraction in the presence of a reequilibration catalyst to form a reequilibration mixture comprising high molecular weight cyclic organosiloxanes and the inert solvent, and recycling the reequilibration mixture to the washing step.

    <p num="2">
      Dimethyldichlorosilane generally contains small amount of heptane as a by-product of the direct process.
      <br/>
      When the dimethyldichlorosilane is hydrolyzed to form polysiloxanes the by-product heptane remains as an unwanted odor causing contaminant.
      <br/>
      The heptane is subsequently removed by passing the hydrolyzate through a distillation column where the hydrolyzate is recovered as a high-boiling bottom stream and a low-boiling overhead stream comprising heptane and lower boiling siloxanes are recycled back into the process.
      <br/>
      The low boiling siloxanes which consists mostly of hexamethylcyclotrisiloxane is recycled back into the process and as a consequence builds up over time to as much as one-quarter to one-third of the recycle stream.
      <br/>
      As the hexamethylcyclotrisiloxane content of the recycle stream increases, it significantly impacts the capacity of the column used to remove heptane from the hydrolyzate.
      <br/>
      As a result of hexamethylcyclotrisiloxane build-up, additional capital is required to make the column large enough to handle the recycled hexamethylcyclotrisiloxane.
      <br/>
      When the recycle streams' hexamethylcyclotrisiloxane concentration becomes too great, the recycle stream must be removed from the process for disposal as a hazardous waste.
      <br/>
      Therefore, a process is needed to remove hexamethylcyclotrisiloxane from the recycle stream, while allowing the heptane to be recycled.
    </p>

    <p num="8">
      The present invention is a continuous process for reducing the amount of low molecular weight cyclic organosiloxane in a recirculating process stream.

    <p num="9">
      (A) washing a process stream in a wash step to reduce chloride content of the process stream,
      <br/>

      <br/>
      (D) recycling the reequilibration mixture to the wash step, where each R is independently selected from the group consisting of saturated monovalent hydrocarbon radicals comprising one to about 12 carbon atoms and an aryl radical, n is less than 5, and m is 4 to 14.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      The process stream of the present process is formed by reacting silanes with water to form a hydrolysis mixture.
      <br/>
      The silanes useful in the process may be a single species of silane as described by formula R2 SiCl2 or a mixture of such silanes.
      <br/>
      R is selected from a group consisting of saturated monovalent hydrocarbon radicals comprising one to about 12 carbon atoms and aryl radicals.
      <br/>
      R can be, for example, methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, butyl, tertiary butyl, sec-butyl, hexyl, cyclohexyl, dodecyl, phenyl, tolyl, and naphtyl.
      <br/>
      Preferred is when R is selected from the group consisting of methyl and phenyl.
      <br/>
      Most preferred is when R is methyl.
      <br/>
      The preferred silane is dimethyldichlorosilane.
    </p>
    <p num="11">In the hydrolysis process the silane is contacted with about 1000% to 2000% excess of the stoichiometric equivalent of water in a hydrolysis reactor forming a hydrolysis mixture comprising cyclic and linear organosiloxanes and hydrogen chloride.</p>
    <p num="12">
      The cyclic organosiloxanes formed by the hydrolysis process are described by formulas (R2 SiO)n, and (R2 SiO)m and the linear organosiloxanes are described by formula HO(R2 SiO)q H, where R is as previously defined, n is less than 5, m=4 to 14 and q=2 to 50.
      <br/>
      Examples of cyclic siloxanes are hexamethylcyclotrisiloxane (D3), octamethylcyclotetrasiloxane (D4), and dodecamethylcyclohexasiloxane.
      <br/>
      Examples of linear siloxanes are 1,3-dihydroxytetramethyldisiloxane, 1,5-dihydroxyhexamethyltrisiloxane, and 1,7-dihydroxyoctamethyltetrasiloxane.
    </p>
    <p num="13">
      The hydrolysis mixture is phase separated into a phase comprising the cyclic and linear organosiloxanes and a phase comprising aqueous hydrogen chloride.
      <br/>
      An inert solvent is added to the hydrolysis mixture to facilitate phase separation.
      <br/>
      By the term "inert" it is meant a solvent which can serve as a diluent and does not otherwise have significant reaction in the process.
      <br/>
      Examples of suitable inert solvents are hydrocarbons, such as, hexane, heptane, benzene, toluene, xylene, THF, and diethyl ether.
      <br/>
      The preferred solvent is heptane.
      <br/>
      The amount of solvent useful in the separation process is 20 about 2 to 15 weight percent based on the weight of the hydrolysis mixture.
      <br/>
      Preferred is about 5 to 10 weight percent on the same basis.
    </p>
    <p num="14">
      The inert solvent increases the density difference between the cyclic and linear organosiloxanes and the hydrogen chloride such that within the phase separator, the hydrolysis mixture separates by gravity into an upper process stream comprising the cyclic and linear organosiloxanes and inert solvent and a lower aqueous hydrogen chloride layer.
      <br/>
      The lower aqueous hydrogen chloride layer is withdrawn and recycled back to the hydrolysis process.
    </p>
    <p num="15">
      In the present process, the process stream as described above is water washed by passing the process stream through a wash step.
      <br/>
      By adding water to the process stream, the hydrogen chloride becomes soluble in the water forming an upper organosiloxane and solvent phase and a lower hydrogen chloride acid phase.
      <br/>
      The lower hydrogen chloride acid phase is removed form the process stream and recycled back to the hydrolysis process.
      <br/>
      The chloride content of the process stream is reduced to about 100 ppm.
      <br/>
      The washing step may be repeated to further reduce the process stream chloride content to about 0.5 ppm.
    </p>
    <p num="16">
      After washing, the process stream is distilled into a low-boiling fraction comprising low molecular weight cyclic organosiloxanes described by formula (R2 SiO)n and the inert solvent and a high-boiling fraction comprising linear organosiloxanes and high molecular weight cyclic organosiloxanes described by formula
      <br/>
      (R2 SiO)m,
    </p>
    <p num="17">
      where each R is independently selected from the group consisting of saturated monovalent hydrocarbon radicals comprising one to about 12 carbon atoms and an aryl radical, n is less than 5, and m is 4 to 14.
      <br/>
      The low molecular weight cyclic organosiloxanes consist mostly of hexamethylcyclotrisiloxane and smaller amounts of octamethylcyclotetrasiloxane.
      <br/>
      The high-boiling fraction is withdrawn from the distillation column and collected in a suitable container.
    </p>
    <p num="18">The low-boiling fraction comprising the low molecular weight cyclic organosiloxanes and inert solvent distilled from the process stream are passed through a reequilibration reactor containing a reequilibration catalyst to reequilibrate the low molecular weight cyclic organosiloxanes forming a reequilibration mixture comprising high molecular weight cyclic organosiloxanes described by formula (R2 SiO)m, where R and m are as previously defined.</p>
    <p num="19">
      The amount of inert solvent remaining in the low-boiling fraction of the process stream is about 20 to 95 weight percent based on the weight of the low-boiling fraction of the process stream.
      <br/>
      For use in the present process, it is preferred that the inert solvent comprise about 30 to 90 weight percent of the low-boiling fraction of the process stream.
      <br/>
      Most preferred is when the inert solvent comprises about 60 to 85 weight percent of the low-boiling fraction of the process stream.
    </p>
    <p num="20">
      The reequilibration catalysts useful in the present process are catalysts, such as, trifluoromethane sulfonic acid, HCl activated clays, sulfuric acid activated clays, and sulfonic acid ion exchange resins, such as, sulfonated divinylbenzenestyrene copolymer resin.
      <br/>
      Contact of the catalyst with the low-boiling fraction can be effected by standard means for contacting liquids with solids, for example, in a fixed-bed, a stirred-bed, or a fluid-bed reactor.
      <br/>
      The process can be run as a continuous, semi-continuous, or batch process.
      <br/>
      Preferred is when the present process is run as a continuous process using a fixed-bed of the reequilibration catalyst.
    </p>
    <p num="21">
      The low-boiling fraction comprising the low molecular weight cyclic organosiloxanes are contacted with a reequilibration catalyst which facilitates reequilibration of the lower boiling cyclic siloxanes, such as, hexamethylcyclotrisiloxane and octamethylcyclotetrasiloxane into a mixture of high molecular weight cyclic organosiloxanes comprising a reequilibration mixture.
      <br/>
      The high molecular weight cyclic organosiloxanes can then be removed from the process during distillation.
      <br/>
      The reequilibration mixture comprising the high molecular weight cyclic organosiloxanes and inert solvent are recycled back to the wash step.
