    <heading>TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
    <p num="1">The present invention relates to animal tagging systems and more particularly to an animal tagging system that includes a punch assembly, a pen mechanism and a tag securing assembly; the punch assembly including a spring biased handle assembly in connection with a set of punch jaws for punching hole through an animals ear; the handle assembly including first and second handle ends; the pen mechanism and the tag securing assembly being storable in connection with the handle assembly.</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND ART</heading>
    <p num="2">
      In many jurisdictions, regulations require that a game animal be immediately tagged once has been slain.
      <br/>
      Stiff legal penalties can be imposed on hunters who fail to follow these regulations.
      <br/>
      However, tagging the animal can be difficult because a variety of items are needed to properly fill out and affix the tag.
      <br/>
      It would be a benefit, therefore, to have animal tagging system that included all of the items necessary to rapidly and correctly fill out and affix the tag to the game animal.
      <br/>
      Because the tag must be affixed out in the field, it would of course be a further a benefit to have an animal tagging system that was compact and could be carried in a pocket, backpack or the like.
    </p>

    <p num="3">It is thus an object of the invention to provide an animal tagging system that includes a punch assembly, a pen mechanism and a tag securing assembly; the punch assembly including a spring biased handle assembly in connection with a set of punch jaws for punching hole through an animals ear; the handle assembly including first and second handle ends; the pen mechanism and the tag securing assembly being storable in connection with the handle assembly.</p>
    <p num="4">It is a further object of the invention to provide an animal tagging system that includes a punch assembly, a pen mechanism and a tag securing assembly; the punch assembly including a spring biased handle assembly in connection with a set of punch jaws for punching hole through an animals ear; the handle assembly including first and second handle ends; the pen mechanism and the tag securing assembly being storable in connection with the handle assembly; the first handle end having a pen mechanism having a pen storage cavity formed therein accessible by a first removable handle end cap and sized to receive and hold therein a pen holder having a tubular pen cartridge holding cavity within which a removable pen cartridge with a writing point is removably disposed; the second handle end having tag securing assembly removably provided therein including a line insertion knife having a blade portion attached to a knife handle portion wherein the blade portion includes an edge formed along one side thereof and a line passage aperture formed through the blade adjacent a blade tip end thereof; the knife handle portion forming a portion of the second handle end and including a threaded portion adjacent the blade portion, for securing the knife handle portion in connection with the second handle, and a hollow open opposite end having a securing line spool rotatably installed therein; the securing line spool being filled with tag securing line wound thereon and having an external knob in connection therewith; the hollow open end being sealable with an end cap having a securing line passageway formed therethrough and terminating in an open securing line feed opening through which a free end of the tag securing line is threaded such that the free end extends out of the end cap; the end cap having a line cutting mechanism provided therein.</p>
    <p num="5">It is a still further object of the invention to provide an animal tagging system that includes a punch assembly, a pen mechanism and a tag securing assembly; the punch assembly including a spring biased handle assembly in connection with a set of punch jaws for punching hole through an animals ear; the handle assembly including first and second handle ends; the pen mechanism and the tag securing assembly being storable in connection with the handle assembly; the first handle end having a pen mechanism having a pen storage cavity formed therein accessible by a first removable handle end cap and sized to receive and hold therein a pen holder having a tubular pen cartridge holding cavity within which a removable pen cartridge with a writing point is removably disposed; the second handle end having the tag securing assembly removably provided therein including a number of two-part screw faster assemblies and a screw faster assembly drive tool; each of the two-part screw fastener assemblies including a first faster portion having first flange portion in connection between an internally threaded rod portion and an externally threaded screw portion; the screw fastener drive tool having a drive handle attached to a drive shaft portion; the drive handle portion having a hollow chamber formed therein accessible through a removable end cap sized to hold a supply of the two-part screw fastener assemblies; the drive shaft portion being rigidly affixed to the drive handle and terminated in an externally threaded screw head member having a drive flange and a threaded screw end that is companionately threaded to threadably engage the internally threaded rod portion of the first fastener portion.</p>
    <p num="6">It is a still further object of the invention to provide an animal tagging system that includes a punch assembly, a pen mechanism and a tag securing assembly; the punch assembly including a spring biased handle assembly in connection with a set of punch jaws for punching hole through an animals ear; the handle assembly including first and second handle ends; the pen mechanism and the tag securing assembly being storable in connection with the handle assembly; the first handle end having a pen mechanism having a pen storage cavity formed therein accessible by a first removable handle end cap having a tubular pen cartridge attached thereto, the pen storage cavity being sized to hold a number of Molly fasteners of the tag securing assembly; each Molly fastener including a top Molly flange frictionally slidably mounted on a nail shaft having a head at a top end and a pair of expandable Mollies attached between the top Molly flange and a bottom end of the nail shaft; the second handle end having the remainder of the tag securing assembly including a removable top Molly flange holding member having a slot formed in a holding end thereof that extends from a handle portion, the slot being sized to receive the shaft of the Molly fastener between the head and the top Molly flange; the holding end being storable in a cavity formed in the second handle end and held in place with a removable securing handle portion; the securing handle portion having a hollow interior cavity accessible through a removable second handle portion cap for holding a number of ear contact flanges that are used in connection with the Molly fasteners by sliding the tip end of the Molly fastener through an aperture formed through the ear contact flange prior to securing the Molly fastener by holding down the top flange and the pulling on head by grasping and pulling with the punch assembly until the two Mollies expand to secure the ear contact flange in place.</p>
    <p num="7">
      Accordingly, an animal tagging system is provided.
      <br/>
      The animal tagging system includes a punch assembly, a pen mechanism and a tag securing assembly; the punch assembly including a spring biased handle assembly in connection with a set of punch jaws for punching hole through an animals ear; the handle assembly including first and second handle ends; the pen mechanism and the tag securing assembly being storable in connection with the handle assembly.
    </p>
