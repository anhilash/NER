    <heading>TECHNICAL FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="1">
      The present invention pertains to the field of playthings, for example, playthings for children such as dolls, stuffed animals, novelty items, and the like.
      <br/>
      In particular, the present invention pertains to playthings such as dolls, stuffed animals, novelty items, and the like that have an appliance such as a face which is detachably affixed thereto.
      <br/>
      In further particular, the present invention pertains to such playthings where the appliance holds or comprises a likeness of, for example, a child.
    </p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">
      Dolls are well known in the prior art that exhibit changeable facial features.
      <br/>
      For example, a doll with an envelope for a photo image face is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,020,586 (Benner) wherein a doll is provided with a pocket located in a facial zone to receive a photographic likeness of a person to personalize the doll.
    </p>
    <p num="3">
      U.S. Pat. No. 4,929,213 (Morgan) discloses a method of creating images such as the face of a child on flexible foam plastic such as a doll's head.
      <br/>
      It is further disclosed that the method can also be used to create images of other objects such as pet animals with the head on a separate piece of foam attachable to the body in different tilted positions by means of Velcro.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      U.S. Pat. No. 5,403,224 (Gintling) discloses a doll having a pocket secured to a face portion of the doll for displaying a photograph.
      <br/>
      The doll includes a doll body and a doll head with a pocket which may include a releasable sealing closure such that the photograph may be sealed within the pocket.
      <br/>
      Releasable fabric fasteners may be utilized to secure the pocket to the face portion, whereby the pocket may be selectively removed to facilitate both a reversing of the pocket and a washing of the doll.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      Lastly, U.S. Pat. No. 5,842,900 (Hodge) discloses a stuffed doll or toy that includes a main body section from which a plurality of appendages extend, representative of arms and legs.
      <br/>
      A displaceable panel or layer is shiftably attached to the fabric of the main body section and may include representations of facial features.
      <br/>
      Separable fastener elements such as hook and loop components serve to attach the displaceable panel and intermediate layers in a closed position flush with the main body section.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      The dolls disclosed in the prior art suffer in that they do not provide a natural appearance of the likeness which is affixed to the doll.
      <br/>
      As such, a need exists in the art for a plaything such as a doll, a stuffed animal, a novelty item, and the like that can have a likeness of, for example, a child, affixed thereto which provides a natural appearance.
    </p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>

    <p num="14">
      FIG. 5 shows appliance 700 that is fabricated in accordance with the present invention.
      <br/>
      In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, appliance 700 comprises an image, preferably, a photographic image, that is transferred onto appliance 700 in accordance with any one of a number of methods that are well known to those of ordinary skill in the art.
      <br/>
      In accordance with the preferred embodiment of the present invention, when such an image represents a face, appliance 700 can advantageously serve as a faceplate for doll 200 shown in FIGS. 1 and 2, stuffed animal 400 shown in FIG. 3, and doll 600 shown in FIG. 4.
      <br/>
      For example, one could: (a) copy or scan a photograph or take a digital image and transfer the image onto heat transfer paper; and (b) transfer the image on the heat transfer paper to fabric which covers at least a portion of the appliance using a heating process.
      <br/>
      In another method which is well known to those of ordinary skill in the art, an image is scanned or a photograph is taken, for example, with a digital camera, and printed directly onto fabric.
      <br/>
      As is well known, fabric used for such a process of image transfer could be CANON fabric sheets, as Cotton White, EPSON canvas cloth rolls, and the like.
      <br/>
      In still another method, an image is directly applied to a backing which forms all of, or a part of, the appliance.
      <br/>
      In a preferred embodiment, the backing is a stretchable fabric that can lie flat during an image transfer process.
      <br/>
      Then, removable, shaped inserts comprising (a) soft padding and (b) either foam board or plastic (for stiffness) are added.
      <br/>
      Finally, a drawstring located around the outer edge of the appliance wraps around the inserts to create a pouch in the shape of the inserts.
      <br/>
      Advantageously, for this embodiment, the image is transferred to a flat surface that becomes a three dimensional surface upon the addition of the soft and hard inserts.
    </p>
    <p num="15">As one can see from the above, advantageously in accordance with the present invention, recessed area 110 shown in FIGS. 1 and 2, recessed area 310 shown in FIG. 3, and recessed area 510 shown in FIG. 4 enable one to insert faceplate appliance 700 into the doll's or stuffed animal's recessed area.</p>
    <p num="16">
      As one can readily appreciate, whenever faceplate appliance 700 comprises a transferred photograph, the doll, stuffed animal, or novelty item becomes personalized.
      <br/>
      Advantageously, in accordance with the present invention: (a) there is an improved look over that of the prior art for a dividing line between the image on facial appliance 700 and the doll's, stuffed animal's, or novelty item's fabric and (b) the facial portion of the doll or stuffed animal looks like a part of the doll or stuffed animal rather than appearing to be an attachment or a separate piece as is the case in the prior art.
    </p>
    <p num="17">
      In accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention, band 120 shown in FIGS. 1 and 2, band 320 shown in FIG. 3, and band 520 shown in FIG. 4 encompasses an area that is smaller than a cross sectional area of facial appliance 700 shown in FIG. 5.
      <br/>
      In accordance with the preferred embodiment, the band makes a snug fit with, and assists in holding, facial appliance 700 in place.
      <br/>
      Advantageously, in accordance with the present invention, using recessed area 110 shown in FIGS. 1 and 2, recessed area 310 shown in FIG. 3, and recessed area 510 shown in FIG. 4 makes it easier to remove facial appliance 700.
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      The base of recessed area 110 shown in FIGS. 1 and 2, recessed area 310 shown in FIG. 3, and recessed area 510 shown in FIG. 4 could be made from a variety of fabrics or hard materials.
      <br/>
      In a preferred embodiment, the recessed area is fabricated to have a substantially flat surface that is situated about one inch (1") below the surface of the head.
      <br/>
      Some materials that could be used for the surface of the recessed area are headliner, tricot, cotton, Velcro, cardboard, plastic, and rubber.
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      In accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention, recessed area 110 shown in FIGS. 1 and 2, recessed area 310 shown in FIG. 3, and recessed area 510 shown in FIG. 4 and faceplate appliance 700 have attachment mechanisms disposed thereon.
      <br/>
      Attachment mechanisms could include, without limitation: (a) two sided tape; (b) Velcro matting and Velcro loops (one attached to the recessed area and one attached to the appliance); (c) Velcro Comp (headliner fabric) and Velcro loops (one attached to the recessed area and one attached to the appliance); (d) hook and eyes (one attached to the recessed area and one attached to the appliance); (e) buttons and button holes; (f) suction cups; (g) magnets; (h) magnetized sheeting; (i) zippers disposed about the band and the appliance; (j) screws; (k) light basting; (l) snaps; and (m) fuse with a fusing tape.
    </p>
    <p num="20">In a preferred embodiment of the present invention which comprises a hard bodied doll, such as a rubber or hard plastic doll, faceplate appliance 700 could attach to the recessed area and be surrounded by a band.</p>
    <p num="21">
      The following describes a method for fabricating a head of a doll or stuffed animal in accordance with the present invention.
      <br/>
      Using the method described in detail below, one of ordinary skill in the art would attach the head to a body which is fabricated in accordance with any one of a number of methods that are well known to those of ordinary skill in the art.
      <br/>
      FIGS. 6-10 show pattern pieces used to assemble the head.
      <br/>
      In accordance with the assembly method, framing bias strip 800 shown in FIG. 6, side-of-head-piece 820 shown in FIG. 8, and back-of-head-piece 830 shown in FIG. 9 are all cut from a fabric desired for use in constructing the doll or stuffed animal.
      <br/>
      Facial piece 810 shown in FIG. 7 is cut from a fabric similar to tricot or headliner, which fabric is acceptable to adhere to Velcro.
      <br/>
      Lastly, strip 850 shown in FIG. 10 is a strip of hard rubber or plastic that is about one inch wide (1") and is used to form the frame.
    </p>
    <p num="22">
      Referring to FIG. 13, to start the assembly, take strip 850 and place it on between two of framing bias strip 800, and stitch the two of framing bias strip 800 using thread 920.
      <br/>
      As shown in FIG. 13, strip 850 is substantially the same size in length as each of framing bias strip 800.
    </p>
    <p num="23">
      Next, referring to FIG. 14, fold the structure shown in FIG. 13 in half lengthwise, with ends matching, and stitch the ends together.
      <br/>
      As a result, the two of framing bias strip 800 form a full circle with concealed strip 850 acting as a firm support for this circle, now frame 120 of FIG. 1.
    </p>
    <p num="24">
      Next, referring to FIGS. 15 and 16, pin facial piece 810 and framing bias strip 800 together on the "face side" of the fabric.
      <br/>
      To do this, place facial piece 810 on a flat surface, and place framing bias strip 800 onto, and around, facial piece 810.
      <br/>
      Next, stitch around the outer edge using thread 920 leaving an approximate 1/4" seam allowance around the outer edge.
      <br/>
      Notches on framing bias strip 800 (shown in FIG. 6) are advantageously used to line up framing bias strip 800 and facial piece 810 to enable one to match the seam on framing bias strip 800 and the bottom of facial piece 810 (do not clip the edges).
      <br/>
      Next, flip framing bias strip 800 inside out, and invert recessed area 110 for the next step.
    </p>
    <p num="25">
      Next, referring to FIG. 17, with "face sides" together (side-of-head-piece 820 and framing bias strip 800), stitch across the bottom of side-of-head-piece 820 at the chin section.
      <br/>
      Then, with "face sides" together, stitch side-of-head-piece 820 to framing bias strip 800 around the open end.
      <br/>
      Next, turn this completed section right side out and push the facial area inward with framing bias strip 800.
      <br/>
      After this, the seam just sewn which attaches side-of-head-piece 820 to framing bias strip 800 is now the seam in front of the face surrounding the frame, and keeps the recessed area in place.
      <br/>
      One may need to top stitch around the band, but this is not necessary; in practice, this depends upon the fabric used for assembly of the doll or stuffed animal.
    </p>
    <p num="26">
      Next, with "face sides" together, stitch the back seam of back-of-head-piece 830, clipping around the curved edges.
      <br/>
      Then, referring to FIG. 18, with "face sides" of the fabric together, pin and then stitch back-of-head-piece 830 to side-of-head-piece 820, leaving an opening for the attachment to the dolls body.
      <br/>
      Lastly, turn this completed section right side out, and it is ready for attachment to bodies 100, 200, 300, and 500 shown in FIGS. 1 and 3-4.

    <p num="27">
      The following describes a method for fabricating a faceplate to be inserted into the recessed area of a doll or stuffed animal that is fabricated in accordance with the present invention.
      <br/>
      Referring to FIG. 11, cut one piece of fabric using faceplate pattern piece 900, the fabric is preferably 100% cotton.
    </p>
    <p num="28">
      Next, referring to FIG. 12, cut one piece foam insert piece 910 from foam board, or other suitable hard material.
      <br/>
      Then, referring to FIG. 19, turn and stitch an approximately 1/2" hem around the outer edge of faceplate pattern piece 900, thereby making a tunnel around the outer edge.
      <br/>
      Next, as shown in FIG. 19, cut slit 960 in the tunneled hem, on the "wrong side" of the fabric and insert cord 930 into the tunneled hem while leaving about 4" of cord 930 hanging out of the tunnel hem on each side.
      <br/>
      Cord 930 will be used as a drawstring.
    </p>
    <p num="29">
      At this point, an image is applied or transferred to the "face side" of faceplate pattern piece 900 in accordance with any one of many methods that are well known to those of ordinary skill in the art.
      <br/>
      Doing so at this point in the fabrication process enables one to have a flat surface upon which to transfer the image.
    </p>
    <p num="30">
      Next, referring to FIG. 20, glue or attach in any desired manner, two strips of Velcro 950 to the back side of foam insert piece 910.
      <br/>
      Next, referring to FIG. 21, cut a piece of batting 940 the size of foam insert piece 910 and attach batting 940 to the front of foam insert piece 910 by stitching around the outer edge.
      <br/>
      Advantageously, this gives the image a three-dimensional effect and provides padding to the faceplate.
      <br/>
      FIG. 22 shows the back side of the appliance shown in FIG. 21.
    </p>
    <p num="31">
      Next, referring to FIG. 23, place faceplate pattern piece 900 on a flat surface with the image face down.
      <br/>
      Place foam insert piece 910 "face side" down (with the Velcro(950) facing up) in the center of faceplate pattern piece 900.
      <br/>
      Then, applying pressure to the center of foam insert piece 910, for example, with one's hand, pull cord 930 to evenly make a pocket around foam insert piece 910.
    </p>
    <p num="32">
      Lastly, referring to FIG. 24, tie the ends of cord 930.
      <br/>
      Then, clip and tuck them into the back area.
      <br/>
      At this point, the faceplate appliance is ready for insertion into the recessed area of a doll, a stuffed animal, or a novelty item.
