      In a brake boosting system the present invention, as it is decided that brake assist is necessary, a pump 53 is driven, and a solenoid valve 72 is switched to its communication position, and a solenoid shut-off valve 75 is opened.
      <br/>
      Then, the pump 53 sucks brake fluid from a reservoir 9 through the solenoid valve 72 and sends out the brake fluid to the pressure intensifying chamber 21 through the solenoid shut-off valve 75.
      <br/>
      At this point, an output shaft 11 has already advanced and a radial hole 38 is positioned ahead of a seventh cup sealing member 31 so that the pressure intensifying chamber 21 and the reaction chamber 33 are shut off from the reservoir 9 so as to be in the sealed state.
      <br/>
      Therefore, pump discharge pressure is supplied to the pressure intensifying chamber 21 and the reaction chamber 33 so that the pressure in these chambers is intensified.
      <br/>
      Since the intensified pressure acts on the primary piston 12, the master cylinder pressure is intensified to a value greater than that of normal braking.
      <br/>
      As mentioned above, by intensifying the master cylinder pressure when necessary, large braking force can be obtained with a simple structure.

    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="1">The present invention relates to a brake boosting system for providing intensified braking force by directly boosting master cylinder pressure.</p>
    <p num="2">Conventionally, a brake boosting system used in an automobile is provided with a booster, which boosts input to a predetermined magnitude by using hydraulic pressure such as negative pressure or fluid pressure and a master cylinder (hereinafter, sometimes referred to as "MCY") is actuated by the output of the booster, thereby obtaining large braking force from small leg power on the brake pedal.</p>
    <p num="3">
      Conventionally used in a vacuum brake boosting system provided with a vacuum booster is negative pressure produced in an engine.
      <br/>
      Recently, however, fuel consumption reduction of an engine is desired, whereas lower negative pressure is produced in the engine.
      <br/>
      As a result of this, output of a vacuum booster is also reduced.
      <br/>
      One of measures to cope with this reduction in the output is enlargement of the vacuum booster.
      <br/>
      However, this enlargement makes it quite difficult to install the vacuum booster in a small engine room.
    </p>
    <p num="4">On the other hand, a fluid pressure brake boosting system provided with a fluid pressure booster has a problem that parts such as a pump and an accumulator are required, thereby increasing the cost.</p>
    <p num="5">In such brake boosting systems, it is desired that, in case of emergency braking, the boosting device quickly produces braking force larger than that in case of normal braking.</p>
    <p num="6">
      among inexpert drivers, there must be a person who can not pedal a brake pedal fully so as not to develop large braking force.
      <br/>
      In this case, it is desired to provide braking assist for ensuring that large braking force is obtained even by such an inexpert driver.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      In the conventional brake boosting systems, however, since the servo ratio of the servo control is constant during the output of the braking force, not only braking force larger than that for normal braking can nor be quickly produced for emergency braking, but also no braking assist for ensuring that large braking force is obtained even by the inexpert driver is provided.
      <br/>
      Therefore, it is difficult to meet the aforementioned demands.
    </p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="8">The object of the present invention provide a brake boosting system with a simple structure which can intensify master cylinder pressure to output large braking force when necessary.</p>
    <p num="9">
      For accomplishing the object, a brake boosting system of the present invention comprises at least: a brake operating member for braking operation; a reservoir for storing brake fluid; a master cylinder for producing master cylinder pressure; and a brake cylinder for producing braking force when the master cylinder pressure is introduced into the brake cylinder, wherein corresponding to the operation of the brake operating member, an input shaft advances to actuate a master cylinder piston, thereby producing the master cylinder pressure.
      <br/>
      The brake boosting system further comprising: a pressure intensifying chamber facing the rear end of the master cylinder piston; a reaction chamber disposed between the master cylinder piston and the input shaft and always communicating with the pressure intensifying chamber; a fluid pressure source for producing fluid pressure and supplying the fluid pressure into the pressure intensifying chamber; and a communication control means which allows the pressure intensifying chamber and the reaction chamber to communicate with the reservoir when the system is inoperative, and intercepts the pressure intensifying chamber and the reaction chamber from communicating with the reservoir when the input shaft advances.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      The brake boosting system of the present invention as structured above may consist of a system of open centre type.
      <br/>
      When the brake boosting system is inoperative, the pressure intensifying chamber communicates with both the fluid pressure source and the reservoir by the communication control means.
      <br/>
      During a normal braking operation, because of the advance of the input shaft, the pressure intensifying chamber is shut off from the reservoir by the communication control means.
      <br/>
      During this normal braking, the fluid pressure of the fluid pressure source is prevented from being supplied to the pressure intensifying chamber not to intensifying the master cylinder pressure of the master cylinder, thereby performing the braking operation at normal braking pressure.
      <br/>
      Also during the braking operation when braking assist is necessary, the pressure intensifying chamber is shut off from the reservoir by the communication means.
      <br/>
      In this case where the intensified pressure is required, the fluid pressure of the fluid pressure source is supplied to the pressure intensifying chamber so as to intensify the master cylinder pressure in the master cylinder, thereby performing the braking operation at braking pressure higher than the normal braking pressure.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the pressure intensifying can be securely obtained when it is required to quickly provide large braking force such as emergency braking.
    </p>
    <p num="11">Further, the present invention further comprises a solenoid control valve disposed between the pressure intensifying chamber and the fluid pressure source for controlling the communication between the pressure intensifying chamber and the fluid pressure source.</p>
    <p num="12">
      In the brake boosting system of the present invention, the supply and discharge of the fluid pressure from the fluid pressure source to the pressure intensifying chamber is controlled by the solenoid control valve.
      <br/>
      Therefore, when the pressure intensification is necessary, the fluid pressure can be rapidly and securely supplied from the fluid pressure source to the pressure intensifying chamber.
    </p>
    <p num="13">
      A brake boosting system of the present invention comprises at least: a brake operating member for braking operation; a reservoir for storing brake fluid; a master cylinder for producing master cylinder pressure; and a brake cylinder for producing braking force when the master cylinder pressure is introduced into the brake cylinder, wherein corresponding to the operation of the brake operating member, an input shaft advances to actuate a master cylinder piston, thereby producing the master cylinder pressure.
      <br/>
      The brake boosting system further comprises: a pressure intensifying chamber facing the rear end of the master cylinder piston; a reaction chamber disposed between the master cylinder piston and the input shaft and always communicating with the pressure intensifying chamber; a fluid pressure source for producing fluid pressure; and a communication control means which allows the pressure intensifying chamber and the reaction chamber to communicate with the reservoir and intercepts the pressure intensifying chamber and the reaction chamber from communicating with the fluid pressure source when the system is inoperative, and blocks the pressure intensifying chamber and the reaction chamber from communicating with the reservoir and allows the pressure intensifying chamber and the reaction chamber to communicate with the fluid pressure source when the input shaft advances.
    </p>
    <p num="14">
      The brake boosting system of the present invention as structured above may consist of a system of closed centre type.
      <br/>
      When the brake boosting system is inoperative, the pressure intensifying chamber is shut off from the fluid pressure source and communicates with the reservoir by the communication control means.
      <br/>
      During a normal braking operation, because of the advance of the input shaft, the pressure intensifying chamber is shut off from the reservoir and is allowed to communicate with the fluid pressure source by the communication control means.
      <br/>
      During this normal braking operation, the fluid pressure of the fluid pressure source is prevented from being supplied to the pressure intensifying chamber not to intensifying the master cylinder pressure of the master cylinder, thereby performing the braking operation at normal braking pressure.
      <br/>
      Also during the braking operation when braking assist is necessary, the pressure intensifying chamber is shut off from the reservoir and is allowed to communicate with the fluid pressure source in the same manner.
      <br/>
      In this case where the intensified pressure is necessary, the fluid pressure of the fluid pressure source is supplied to the pressure intensifying chamber so as to intensify the master cylinder pressure in the master cylinder, thereby performing the braking operation at braking pressure higher than the normal braking pressure.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the pressure intensifying can be securely obtained when it is required to quickly provide large braking force such as emergency braking.
    </p>
    <p num="15">Further, the present invention further comprises a booster for boosting the input from the brake operating member and outputting the boosted power through an output shaft thereof, wherein the input shaft of the master cylinder is actuated through the output shaft of the booster, or, the output shaft of the booster composes the input shaft of the master cylinder.</p>
    <p num="16">In the brake boosting system of the present invention, since the booster boosts the input from the brake operating member, the master cylinder pressure is intensified not only by the fluid pressure of the pressure intensifying chamber but also by the output of the booster.</p>
    <p num="17">Furthermore, the present invention further comprises a solenoid control valve disposed on a fluid pressure supplying line between the pressure intensifying chamber or the communication control means and the fluid pressure source, and an electronic control unit which determines whether normal braking should be conducted or braking assist is necessary, corresponding to a brake operational condition such as leg power exerted on the brake operating member and/or the rate of rise of the leg power, sets the solenoid control valve to its shut-off position when it is decided that the normal braking should be conducted, and sets the solenoid control valve to its communication position when it is decided that the braking assist is necessary.</p>
    <p num="18">In the brake boosting system, since the electronic control unit operates the solenoid control valve when it is decided that the braking assist is necessary such as emergency braking, the braking assist is securely and rapidly conducted, thereby rapidly obtaining large braking force even with relatively small input.</p>
    <p num="19">Moreover, the present invention further comprises a solenoid control valve disposed on a fluid pressure supplying line between the pressure intensifying chamber or the communication control means and the fluid pressure source, and an electronic control unit which, corresponding to pressure of a pressure source for the booster, sets the solenoid control valve to its shut-off position when the pressure exceeds a predetermined value, and sets the solenoid control valve to its communication position when the pressure is lower than the predetermined value.</p>
    <p num="20">
      In the brake boosting system, in case of failure in the fluid pressure source of the booster, for example a proper detection means detects the failure and sends a signal to the electronic control unit whereby the electronic control unit conducts the braking assist control.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the large braking force can be ensured even in the event of the pressure fluid failure.
    </p>
    <p num="21">In addition, in the present invention, the pump is a pump for anti-skid control (hereinafter, sometimes referred to as "ABS pump"), a pump for traction control (hereinafter, sometimes referred to as "TRC pump"), or a pump for both anti-skid control and traction control.</p>
    <p num="22">In the brake boosting system of the present invention, since the ABS pump or the TRC pump, which is already provided, is also used as the fluid pressure source so that another pump exclusively for the braking assist control is not required, the brake pressure boosting system can be made in a simpler structure and at a lower cost.</p>
    <p num="23">Still other objects and advantages of the invention will in part be obvious and will in part be apparent from the specification.</p>
    <p num="24">The invention accordingly comprises the features of construction, combinations of elements, and arrangement of parts which will be exemplified in the construction hereinafter set forth, and the scope of the invention will be indicated in the claims.</p>

    <heading>DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
    <p num="26">FIG. 1 is a view showing a first embodiment of a brake boosting system according to the present invention, and FIG. 2 is a partially enlarged sectional view of a master cylinder of the brake boosting system shown in FIG. 1.</p>
    <p num="27">As shown in FIG. 1, the brake boosting system 1 of the first embodiment comprises the vacuum booster 2 which boosts and outputs leg power exerted on a brake pedal, a MCY 3 of tandem type which is actuated by the output of the vacuum booster 2 to produce MCY pressure, wheel cylinders (hereinafter, sometimes referred to as "WCY") 4, 5, 6, and 7 which produce braking forces when the MCY pressure is supplied and are disposed for two circuits, respectively (WCYs 4 and 5 relating to driving wheels and WCYs 6 and 7 relating to non-driving wheels, in this embodiment), an anti-skid control/traction control unit (hereinafter, sometimes referred to as "ABS/TRC") 8 for the two circuits which conducts Anti-skid Control of controlling WCY pressure of the WCYs 4, 5, 6, and/or 7 to cancel locking tendency when a braked wheel is in locking tendency, and conducts Traction Control for automatically applying braking pressure on the driving wheels WCYs 4, 5 to cancel slipping tendency when the driving wheels are in slipping tendency, and a reservoir 9 in which braking fluid is stored.</p>
    <p num="28">
      The vacuum booster 2 is well known and common whereas the detailed description will be omitted.
      <br/>
      In the vacuum booster 2, an input shaft 10 is moved forward by pedaling the brake pedal (not shown) to switch a control valve not shown.
      <br/>
      Then, atmosphere is introduced into a variable pressure chamber defined by a diaphragm piston (not shown) so as to develop differential pressure between the variable pressure chamber and the Constant pressure chamber.
      <br/>
      This differential pressure actuates the diaphragm piston whereby the leg power on the brake pedal is boosted and an output shaft 11 outputs the boosted power.
    </p>
    <p num="29">
      The MCY 3 comprises a primary piston 12 and a secondary piston 13 just like a well-known common tandem MCY.
      <br/>
      The pistons 12 and 13 are both formed as pistons of plunger type.
      <br/>
      That is, the primary piston 12 slidably penetrates first through third cup sealing members 16, 17, 18 disposed on the inner surface of an axial hole 15 formed in a housing 14 of the MCY 3 and the secondary piston 13 slidably penetrates fourth and fifth cup sealing members 19, 20 disposed on the inner surface of the axial hole 15.
    </p>
    <p num="30">In the axial hole 15 of the housing 14, a pressure intensifying chamber 21 is defined by the first cup sealing member 16, a first annular fluid chamber 22 is defined between the second and third cup seal members 17 and 18, a first fluid pressure chamber 23 is defined between the third and fourth cup sealing members 18 and 19, a second annular fluid chamber 24 is defined between the fourth and fifth cup sealing members 19 and 20, and a second fluid chamber 25 is defined by the fifth cup sealing member 20.</p>
    <p num="31">
      The first cup sealing member 16 is arranged to block the flow of brake fluid from the pressure intensifying chamber 21 to the opposite side about the first sealing member 16 and to allow the flow of brake fluid in the reverse direction.
      <br/>
      The second cup sealing member 17 is arranged to block the flow of brake fluid from the first annular fluid chamber 22 to the opposite side about the second cup sealing member 17 and to allow the flow of brake fluid in the reverse direction.
      <br/>
      The third cup sealing member 18 is arranged to block the flow of brake fluid from the first fluid pressure chamber 23 to the first annular fluid chamber 22 and to allow the flow of the brake fluid in the reverse direction.
      <br/>
      Further, the fourth cup sealing member 19 is arranged to block the flow of brake fluid from first fluid pressure chamber 23 to the second annular fluid chamber 24 and to allow the flow of the brake fluid in the reverse direction.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, the fifth cup sealing member 20 is arranged to block the flow of brake fluid from the second fluid pressure chamber 25 to the second annular fluid chamber 24 and to allow the flow of brake fluid in the reverse direction.
    </p>
    <p num="32">
      As shown in FIG. 2, the primary piston 12 has a first axial hole 26 formed in a front end portion (the left side in FIG. 2) thereof which opens toward the first fluid pressure chamber 23 and a second axial hole 27 formed in a rear end portion (the right side in FIG. 2) thereof which opens toward the pressure intensifying chamber 21 and the diameter is smaller than that of the first axial hole 26, so that the primary piston 12 is formed in a substantially cylindrical shape.
      <br/>
      Disposed in the first axial hole 26 are a rear end side of a first return spring 28 and a rear end side of a telescopic retainer 29, the maximum length of which is restricted, for supporting the first return spring 28 in the compressed state.
      <br/>
      The front end of the retainer 29 is always in contact with the secondary piston 13.
    </p>
    <p num="33">
      Disposed in the second axial hole 27 of the primary piston 12 is a front end portion of the output shaft 11 of the vacuum booster 2.
      <br/>
      The output shaft 11 slidably penetrates the sixth and seventh cup sealing member 30, 31 disposed on the inner surface of the second axial hole 27.
    </p>
    <p num="34">Also in the second axial hole 27 of the primary piston 12, a third annular fluid chamber 32 is formed between the sixth and seventh cup sealing members 30 and 31 and a reaction chamber 33 is formed by the seventh cup sealing member 31.</p>
    <p num="35">
      The sixth cup sealing member 30 is arranged to block the flow of brake fluid from the pressure intensifying chamber 21 to the third annular fluid chamber 32 and to allow the flow of brake fluid in the reverse direction.
      <br/>
      The seventh cup sealing member 31 is arranged to block the flow of brake fluid from the reaction chamber 33 to the third annular fluid chamber 32 and to arrow the flow of brake fluid in the reverse direction.
    </p>
    <p num="36">
      The output shaft 11 is provided with an axial hole 34 formed in a front end portion thereof which opens into the reaction chamber 33.
      <br/>
      Compressed and disposed between the output shaft 11 and the primary piston 12 is a second return spring 35 spring constant of which is smaller than that of the first return spring 28.
      <br/>
      When the output shaft 11 is in the illustrated inoperative position, the primary piston 12 and the output shaft 11 are separated from each other by the spring force of the second return spring 35.
      <br/>
      As the output shaft 11 advances, the second return spring 35 is compressed so that the primary piston 12 and the output shaft 11 contact with each other.
    </p>
    <p num="37">
      The primary piston 12 has a radial hole 36 formed in the front end portion thereof, which allows the communication between the first annular fluid chamber 22 and the first fluid pressure chamber 23.
      <br/>
      When the primary piston 12 is in the illustrated inoperative position, the radial hole 36 is positioned slightly behind the third cup sealing member 18 to allow the communication between the first annular fluid chamber 22 and the first fluid pressure chamber 23.
      <br/>
      As the primary piston 12 is actuated, the radial hole 36 passes over the third cup sealing member 18 so as not to allow the communication between the first annular fluid chamber 22 and the first fluid pressure chamber 23.
      <br/>
      The primary piston 12 has a passage 37 formed therein which always allows the communication between the first annular fluid chamber 22 and the third annular fluid chamber 32.
    </p>
    <p num="38">
      The output shaft 11 has a radial hole 38 formed in the front end portion thereof, which allows the communication between the third annular fluid chamber 32 and the reaction chamber 33.
      <br/>
      When the output shaft 11 is in the illustrated inoperative position, the radial hole 38 is positioned slightly behind the seventh cup sealing member 31 to allow the communication between the third annular fluid chamber 32 and the reaction chamber 33.
      <br/>

      <br/>
      By the advance of the output shaft 11, the radial hole 38 passes over the seventh cup sealing member 31 so that the reaction chamber 33 and the pressure intensifying chamber 21 are shut off from the reservoir 9.

      Though the volume of the pressure intensifying chamber 21 is increased by the advance of the primary piston 12 so that the pressure in the pressure intensifying chamber 21 is directed toward negative pressure at this point, brake fluid is supplemented from the reservoir 9 to the pressure intensifying chamber 21 through the check valve 77 so that the inside of the pressure intensifying chamber 21 is held at the atmospheric pressure.

      Therefore, the brake fluid in both the reaction chamber 33 and the pressure intensifying chamber 21 is discharged to the reservoir and the primary piston 12 retreats.

      The braking pressures of the WCYs 4, 5, 6, 7 are reduced.

      As the radial holes 36, 41 of the pistons 12, 13 are moved to positions behind the third and fifth cup sealing member 18, 20, respectively, the first fluid pressure chamber 23 and the second fluid pressure chamber 25 both are allowed to communicate with the reservoir 9 to be at the atmospheric pressure.

      When the brake pedal is pedaled with a rate of rise of the leg power or pedal stroke of the brake pedal which is higher than that for normal braking, an electronic control unit not shown detects the high rate rise according to a detected signal from a suitable detection sensor (not shown) and determines that the braking assist control such as for emergency braking is required.
      <br/>
      In this case, the electronic control unit drives the motor 52 to actuate the pump 53, switches the solenoid valve 72 to the communication position and opens the solenoid shut-off valve 75.

      At this point, the output shaft 11 already advanced to a position where the pressure intensifying chamber 21 and the reaction chamber 33 are both shut off from the reservoir 9 and become in the sealed state in the same manner as described above, so the pressure in the pressure intensifying chamber 21 and the pressure in the reaction chamber 33 are intensified to the pump discharge pressure.

      <br/>
      Since the pressure receiving area of the primary piston 12 where the pump discharge pressure acts and the pressure receiving area of the primary piston 12 on where the MCY pressure acts are equal to each other, the MCY pressure and the pump discharge pressure become equal to each other.

      Once the electronic control unit detects slipping tendency of at least one driving wheel based on wheel-speed signals from the wheel sensors for the driving wheels, the electronic control unit performs TRC control by controlling the motor 52 and the pump 53 (in this embodiment, the pump 70 is also controlled), and the solenoid shut-off valve 71, respectively, and supplies pump discharge pressure to the WCY of the driving wheel, which is in slipping tendency, to cancel the slipping tendency.

      Since the MCY pressure is intensified in this way, large braking force is obtained even when the negative pressure of the negative pressure source is decreased to lower than the predetermined value so that the output of the vacuum booster 2 is decreased.

      <br/>
      In the second embodiment, the sixth and seventh cup sealing members 30, 31 of the first embodiment are omitted and the sealing between the input rod 11' and the second axial hole 27 is ensured by the slidable fitting of the input rod 11' into the second axial hole 27.

      The large-diameter hole 27b of the second axial hole 27 is provided with an axial groove 79 formed in a portion at the inner surface thereof.

      In this state, the step 11c' is positioned in a range of the large-diameter hole 27b where the axial groove 79 does not extend.

      Just like the first embodiment, as the brake pedal is pedaled with power requiring the braking assist control, the pressure in the pressure intensifying chamber 21 is intensified corresponding to the input by supplying discharge pressure from the pump 53 to the pressure intensifying chamber 21, so the primary piston 12 advances by the intensified pressure of the pressure intensifying chamber 21, thereby conducting braking action.
      <br/>
      The output of the master cylinder 3 is expressed by the same equation as Equation 2 but without the spring force of the second return spring 35.
      <br/>
      In this case, therefore, the master cylinder 3 outputs at a higher servo ratio.

    <p num="81">
      The canceling operation of the braking action accompanied with the braking assist control is as follows.

      That is, as the brake pedal is released, the input shaft 11' retreats so that the step 11c is positioned in the range of the large-diameter hole 27b where the axial groove 79 extends so that the radial hole 38 is connected to the axial groove 79.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the reaction chamber 33 and the pressure intensifying chamber 21 both communicate with the reservoir 9.

    <p num="92">
      Though the vacuum booster 2 and the master cylinder 3 are employed in combination in the above embodiments, a hydraulic booster 80 is employed in the brake boosting system 1 of the fourth embodiment as shown in FIG. 6.
      <br/>
      The hydraulic booster 80 is the same as the hydraulic booster disclosed in Japanese Utility model Registered No. 2551658. Since the reference of a microfilm which contains the No. 2551658 makes Is possible to understand the hydraulic booster 80, the detail description is omitted.
      <br/>
      Only the simple description will be made as regard to the operation thereof.
      <br/>
      As the brake pedal not shown is pedaled, an input shaft 81 advances to switch a control valve 82.
      <br/>
      Then, fluid pressure in an accumulator 84 accumulated by a pump 83 is supplied to a power chamber 85 so that a power piston 86 is actuated and boosts leg power exerted on the brake pedal to output through an output shaft 87.
    </p>
    <p num="93">
      In the initial stage of operation of the hydraulic booster 80, a rear end portion 88a of the reaction piston 88 is not in contact with a step 81a of the input shaft 81 so that the hydraulic booster 80 performs a servo control at a higher servo ratio.
      <br/>
      When the fluid pressure in the power chamber 85 reaches a predetermined value, that is the input of the hydraulic booster 80 reaches a predetermined value, the reaction piston 88 retreats relative to the input shaft 81 so that the rear end portion 88a comes in contact with the step 81a of the input shaft 81.
      <br/>
      The hydraulic booster 80 starts to perform a servo control at a lower servo ratio (the servo ratio for the normal braking).
      <br/>
      Thus, the hydraulic booster 80 has the jumping characteristic whereby the rise in the output is increased in the initial stage of braking operation.
    </p>
    <p num="94">
      As the brake pedal is released, the input shaft 81 retreats and the control valve 82 is set in the inoperative state.
      <br/>
      The pressurized fluid in the power chamber 85 is discharged to the reservoir 9 through a discharge passage 89 formed in the input shaft 81 and a discharge passage 90 formed in a housing 14.
      <br/>
      As a result, the hydraulic booster 80 becomes inoperative.
    </p>
    <p num="95">In the fourth embodiment, the sectional area (effective pressure receiving area) of the power piston 86 and the sectional area of the primary piston 12 are set to be equal to each other.</p>

      Though the output shaft 11 comes in contact with the primary piston 12 only when the output shaft 11 advances relative to the primary piston 12 in the first embodiment, the output shaft 87 comes in contact with the primary piston 12 either when the output shaft 87 advances and when it retreats relative to the primary piston 12.
      <br/>
      For this, a flange 87a (not shown)is provided at the front end of the output shaft 87 and a contact portion 12a, operating the flange 87a when the output shaft 87 retreats relative to the primary piston 12, is formed in the primary piston 12.

      The other structure of the output shaft 87 is the same as that of the output shaft 11 of the first embodiment and the other structure of the primary piston 12 is the same as that of the primary piston 12 of the first embodiment.

    <p num="99">
      Assuming that the sectional area of the input shaft 81 is C, the spring force of the return spring 91 of the hydraulic booster is SPG3, and the spring force of the return spring 92 of the input shaft 81 is SPG, the MCY pressure P1 relative to the input F1 of the input shaft 81 during the normal braking in the fourth embodiment is found by the following Equation 3;
      <br/>
      P1 =F1 /C-SPG1 /A-SPG3 /A-SPG4 /C  (3)
    </p>
    <p num="100">
      MCY pressure P2 relative to the input F1 of the input shaft 81 during the assisted braking is found by the following Equation 4;
      <br/>
      P2 =(A/B*C)*F1 -SPG2 /B-SPG3 B-SPG4 /C  (4)
    </p>
    <p num="101">
      As comparison between Equation 3 and Equation 4 is made, the MCY pressure P2 produced during the assisted braking is (A/B) times as higher then as the MCY pressure P1 produced during the normal braking.
      <br/>
      Because B&lt;A, 1&lt;(A/B) is obtained, so it is found that the higher MCY pressure is produced during the asserted braking than a case of the normal braking.
    </p>
    <p num="102">Though the hydraulic booster with the jumping characteristic by virtue of the reaction piston 88 is employed in the fourth embodiment, a typical hydraulic booster without the reaction piston 88 may be employed.</p>

    <p num="104">
      As apparent from the above description, according to the brake boosting system of the present invention, when the braking assist is required, the fluid pressure in the fluid pressure source is supplied to the pressure intensifying chamber to intensify the master cylinder pressure of the master cylinder so that braking force larger than that for normal braking can be obtained.
      <br/>
      The braking assist can be securely obtained when it is required to quickly provide large braking force such as emergency braking.
    </p>
    <p num="105">The brake boosting system can be simply structured only by providing the pressure intensifying chamber and the reaction chamber in the master cylinder and controlling the supply and discharge of fluid pressure relative to the pressure intensifying chamber.</p>
    <p num="106">Also according to the present invention, since the ABS pump or the TRC pump, which is already provided, is also used as the fluid pressure source so that another pump exclusively for the braking assist control is not required, the brake pressure boosting system with braking assist function can be made at a lower cost without increase in the number of the parts.</p>
    <p num="107">
      According to the present invention, the input is boosted by the booster and the master cylinder pressure is further intensified when the braking assist is necessary, so large braking force can be rapidly and securely obtained even with not large input when it is required to quickly provide large braking force such as emergency braking.
      <br/>
      In addition, large braking force can be ensured even in the event of the pressure fluid failure by that the braking assist control is conducted by the electronic control unit to intensify the master cylinder pressure.
    </p>
    <p num="108">Moreover, large braking force is securely obtained even with negative pressure lowered in terms of the fuel consumption reduction of an engine, thereby effectively coping with the tendency of negative pressure reduction.</p>
