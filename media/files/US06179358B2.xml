    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="1">
      1.
      <br/>
      Field of the Invention
    </p>
    <p num="2">This invention relates to a mobile hospital system adapted to quickly provide comprehensive diagnoses and medical treatments to a relatively large number of patients in an area stricken by a large natural disaster or a harsh military dispute or in an extremely remote area where medical facilities are not available.</p>
    <p num="3">2. Prior Art</p>
    <p num="4">
      A large number of casualties can be given rise to in areas hit by devastating natural disasters such as earthquakes, floods caused by a prolonged rain fall or volcanic eruptions and the hospitals in the neighboring areas may normally have only a limited capacity for diagnoses and medical treatments so that many of the patients may be left uncared-for.
      <br/>
      If large hospitals are found in the neighboring areas.
      <br/>
      They may find themselves hopeless in providing medical care to the patients when the services of public utilities including the supply of electricity, water and fuel gas are disrupted.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      When a large natural disaster occurs, medical tents are normally set up as appropriate locations near the disaster-stricken area and attended by doctors ad nurses, who provide medical care to casualties on a first aid basis, the hardest-hit having the highest priority of treatment.
      <br/>
      However, the medical staff will then have to take care of a large number of patients with limited staff members and therefore many of the patients will not be adequately treated.
      <br/>
      Additionally, the patients who need long term medical care will have to be moved to a hospital remote from the disaster-stricken are if no medical facilities are available in nearby areas to accommodate the patients.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      In countries at war, medical aid will be provided typically by the international Red Cross so that wounded soldiers may be moved to casualty clearing stations while wounded civilians may be sent to emergency medical facilities for medical treatment.
      <br/>
      However, as pointed out above, the medical care provided by these facilities are mostly on a first aid basis and they may not be adapted to sophisticated surgical operations because they are not medically equipped in a sufficient and satisfactory fashion.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      As described above, in areas stricken by a large natural disaster or a harsh military dispute or in an extremely remote area, many patients who need medical care are left without being sufficiently taken care of because of insufficient medical staff and medical facilities particularly when a large number of patients are produced.
      <br/>
      Thus, patients who are not seriously wounded can eventually a suffer from chronic diseases and after-effects of diseases because their diseases are not completely cured, although then could be satisfactorily cured if the patients were medically treated in a satisfactory fashion.
      <br/>
      Therefore, there is a strong need for hospital facilities that can cope with a situation where a large number of patients are produced by a disaster.
    </p>
    <p num="8">Thus, in view of the above identified problem, it is therefore the object of the invention to provide a mobile hospital system that can be moved by means of tractors, helicopters, railway locomotives and/or sea vessels and adapted to provide comprehensive diagnoses and medical treatments to causalities and patients having various symptoms.</p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="9">According to a first aspect of the invention, the above object is achieved by providing a mobile hospital system comprising a plurality of container wagons adapted to functionally operate as part of a hospital and be moved appropriately by transportation means including tractors and helicopters so as to be able to set up a comprehensive hospital by connecting the plurality of container wagons on site, some of the container wagons being provided with a water supply means for supplying water, a power generation means for supplying electric power and an oil supply means for supplying fuel oils to the power generation means.</p>
    <p num="10">Preferably, each of the plurality of container wagons has a connecting opening at least on one of its four lateral sides so that any adjacently located two of the container wagons may be held in communication with each other by way of their respective connecting openings.</p>
    <p num="11">Preferably, the plurality of container wagons include at least a consulting room for treatments by a doctor, a surgical operation room for surgical operations and a medical instrument room equipped with various medical instruments.</p>
    <p num="12">Desirably, the surgical operation room is provided with an air cleaning apparatus for keeping it as clean room.</p>
    <p num="13">If the surgical operation room is provided with an air cleaning apparatus, it has an air duct arranged above the ceiling of the room and the ceiling has a plurality of air blow-in holes held in communication with the air duct, the air cleaning apparatus being adapted to draw air from a lower portion of the surgical operation room and blow in clean air to the air duct.</p>
    <p num="14">Desirably, the plurality of container wagons further include a ward, a canteen, a staff room and a staff bed room.</p>
    <p num="15">Preferably, at least one of the container wagons is airtightly sealed and isolated from ambient air.</p>
    <p num="16">Preferably, a mobile hospital system according to the invention further comprises a water purifying apparatus for purifying the natural water caught by it to the quality level of drinking water.</p>
    <p num="17">Still preferably, a mobile hospital system according to the invention further comprises an incinerator for burning the wastes produced from the container wagons.</p>
    <p num="18">Still preferably, for a mobile hospital system according to the invention, rails are laid sequentially in the intended area of operation for railroads and the container wagons are moved to the setup site by locomotives, where the container wagons on the rails are connected with each other to set up the hospital system.</p>
    <p num="19">Preferably, at least one of the plurality of container wagons is provided with drive means for driving the container wagon to move by itself.</p>
    <p num="20">
      Thus, according to the invention, a mobile hospital system comprising a plurality of container wagons adapted to functionally operate as part of a hospital is moved to an intended area by transportation means including tractors and helicopters so as to be able to set up a comprehensive hospital by connecting the plurality of container wagons on site.
      <br/>
      Each of the container wagons can be connected to a water supply means with ease by way of a piping kit and flexible pipes.
      <br/>
      Each of the container wagons can be connected to a power generation means by means of wires and cables.
      <br/>
      Then, each of the container wagons is supplied with power for lighting and driving medical instruments and also with drinking water and water to be used for medical treatments.
    </p>
    <p num="21">Additionally, wards equipped with beds are arranged for patients and accommodations are provided for the medical staff so that the mobile hospital system may remain on site for a prolonged period of time and operate to provide medical care comparable to a large hospital to eliminate the need of transporting heavily injured patients to remote hospitals.</p>
    <p num="22">When a certain period of time has elapsed from the disaster and the mobile hospital system is no longer needed, it can be disassembled with ease by disconnecting the water supply pipes and the electric wires to move to some other area, which may be a storage area.</p>

      Whenever necessary, it is provided with a microbe-free water supply system to be used for medical activities.
    </p>
    <p num="90">
      Now, the operation of the above described embodiment will be described.
      <br/>
      As long as the container wagons are not mobilized, they stay in the proper base.
      <br/>
      If a large earthquake occurred in a region of the country and all the hospitals in the region have been destructed and can no longer take care of the injured, each of the container wagons is connected to a tractor 9 and moved to the disaster-stricken region.
    </p>
    <p num="91">
      The container wagons are advantageously drawn to a plot of flat land having a certain extension.
      <br/>
      Typically, an athletic arena or a school yard is a preferably choice.
      <br/>
      As the container wagons arrive, they are arranged in an array by maneuvering the tractors 9 as shown in FIGS. 1 through 3.
      <br/>
      If the site is not flat, the auxiliary legs arranged at the bottom of each of the container wagons are used to finely regulate the height of the wagon so that the wagons are found flush with each other.
    </p>
    <p num="92">
      Then, any two adjacently located container wagons are connected by way of the oppositely disposed doors and the corridor members 14 and the produced corridor is surrounded by the bellows-like connecting seal 15.
      <br/>
      Then, the utility-related pipes and wires of the wagons including the water supply pipes and the electric wires are connected so that the container wagons are supplied with electricity, water and LPG.
      <br/>
      Now, the mobile hospital system is set up and ready not only for taking care of patients not only on a first aid basis but also providing a comprehensive diagnosis to each patient.
    </p>
    <p num="93">While the container wagons are moved to the destination by land by means of tractors 9 in the above description, a mobile hospital system according to the invention is not limited thereto and they may be moved by any other appropriate moving means.</p>
    <p num="94">
      If, for example, a remote island is hit by a large disaster, the container wagons cannot be moved to it by land.
      <br/>
      Then, each of the container wagons may be hung by wires, using the suspension fitting of the wagon, and transported to the destination by air typically by means of a helicopter.
      <br/>
      At least a tractor 9 will be used on the island and all the transported container wagons will be arranged in an array by maneuvering the tractor 9 in a manner as shown in FIGS. 2 and 3.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, the container wagons may be moved to the destination by sea by means of a marine vessel.
    </p>
    <p num="95">
      Railroads may be used to move the container wagons to the destination.
      <br/>
      If the destination is located in a remote and isolated area where no large scale hospitals are available, rails may be laid in parallel as an extension of the proper railroad as shown in FIG. 7.
      <br/>
      Then, the container wagons 18 are moved by rail and arranged in array on the rails 16 by operating the switches 17 so that any two adjacently located container wagons 18 are connected by way of the oppositely disposed doors and the corridor members 14 and then the utility-related pipes and wires of the wagons including the water supply pipes and the electric wires are connected so that the container wagons are supplied with electricity, water and LPG to operate the mobile hospital system as described above.
    </p>
    <p num="96">
      FIGS. 8 and 9 are schematic plan views of the container wagons of the second embodiment of the invention, showing a possible arrangement for connecting the illustrated wagons in a manner different from the first embodiment to realize a hospital system 1' on site.
      <br/>
      Since the container wagons are identical with their respective counterparts of the first embodiment, they will not be described here any further.
      <br/>
      This arrangement is particularly advantageous when the site is dimensionally limited in the lateral direction.
      <br/>
      It is also advantageous because the tractors 9 do not have to be separated from the respective container wagons for setting up the hospital system.
      <br/>
      However, it is accompanied by the disadvantage that the container wagons are less communicable if compared with the arrangement of FIGS. 2 and 3.
    </p>
    <p num="97">
      FIG. 10 illustrates an automotive container wagon.
      <br/>
      As shown, the automotive container wagon 28 has a driver's seat 29 and is equipped with an engine, drive wheels and other components necessary for an automobile so that the container wagon is elf-propelled.
      <br/>
      Thus, such a container wagon 28 may move to the destination without using a tractor.
      <br/>
      Additionally, if it is transported by air and/or sea, no tractor will be required to move it in the area of destination so that the overall efficiency will be significantly improved.
      <br/>
      Still additionally, if the intermediary container wagons (such as A6 and A7) in FIGS. 2 and 3 that have to be ultimately separated from the respective tractors are made automotive, their positions may be finely regulated with ease to reduce the effort required to connect the container wagons.
    </p>
    <p num="98">Thus, the above described embodiment of mobile hospital system comprising a predetermined number of container wagons can be moved to the destination hit by a large natural disaster in an easy and effective way and a mobile hospital system can be set up by connecting them on site to provide comprehensive medical services comparable to a large scale hospital including first aid services, medical treatments, surgical operations and hospitalization and nursery services in order to meet various requirements on the part of patients.</p>
    <p num="99">Additionally, since the mobile hospital system comprises wards for accommodating patients and lodgings for the medical staff, it can operates satisfactorily for a prolonged period of time to make it particularly adapted to large natural disasters and prolonged military disputes.</p>
    <p num="100">
      Still additionally, a mobile hospital system 1 is set up by appropriately connecting container wagons having doors 13 on the four lateral sides so that the arrangement of the container wagons can be determined appropriately depending on the topography of the site to make the system highly flexible in terms of positional arrangement.
      <br/>
      Finally, the medical facilities (A1 through A8) have a so-called clean room structure so that any secondary infections due to microbes floating in the air can be effectively prevented from taking place.
      <br/>
      The corridors connecting the container wagons and realized by corridor members 14 are isolated from ambient air so that no germs may enter from the outside.
    </p>
    <p num="101">
      The present invention is not limited to the above embodiments, which may be altered and modified appropriately depending on the circumstances of the disaster-stricken region where the mobile hospital system is used.
      <br/>
      For example, in a case where the disaster is of a relatively small scale and not many wards are required, less container wagons may be used than those shown in FIGS. 2 and 3.
      <br/>
      However, in a case where the disaster is very large, on the other hand, more surgical operation rooms and wards will have to be installed on site.
