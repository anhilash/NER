      A retro-focus type wide-angle lens attains a wide angle of view of 100 degrees in terms of taking angle of view, a far exit pupil position so as to suppress the occurrence of color shading, and a long back focus which is five times the focal length, thus being sufficient for disposing a three-color-separating optical system.
      <br/>
      The wide-angle lens comprises, successively from the object side, a first lens group G1, having a negative refracting power, constituted by a negative first-a lens group G1a and a positive first-b lens group G1b, and a second lens group G2 having a positive refracting power; and satisfies the following conditional expressions (1) and (2):wheref is the focal length of the whole system;Bf is the back focus of the whole system; andthetais an angle formed between a principal ray directed to a screen corner portion and an optical axis.

    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">
      1.
      <br/>
      Field of the Invention
    </p>
    <p num="3">The present invention relates to a wide-angle lens having a taking angle of view of about 100 degrees used in a surveillance camera or the like; and, in particular, to a wide-angle lens having a sufficiently long back focus between the lens and its image surface.</p>
    <p num="4">2. Description of the Prior Art</p>
    <p num="5">
      In general, for viewing or capturing a wider area, lenses usable at a wide angle of about 100 degrees are demanded in TV cameras for commercial use which are employed as video cameras, surveillance cameras, and the like.
      <br/>
      For such a demand, there have been proposed wide-angle lenses disclosed in Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication Nos. 9-80303 and 9-127413.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      In the wide-angle lenses disclosed in Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication Nos. 9-80303 and 9-127413, however, back focus is less than three times the focal length thereof.
      <br/>
      For disposing a three-color-separating optical system between the lens and the image surface, a longer back focus is demanded.
      <br/>
      Specifically, a back focus of about five times the focal length is required as a back focus sufficient for disposing the three-color-separating optical system.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      Also, when disposing a three-color-separating optical system between a wide-angle lens and its image surface, the problem of color shading is needed to be taken into account.
      <br/>
      Luminous fluxes emitted from the wide-angle lens would be incident on a dichroic film of the three-color-separating optical system with their angles greater as they are directed nearer the corner portions of the screen.
      <br/>
      Color shading is a phenomenon in which, as the angle of light beam incident on the dichroic film varies, the optical path length within the thin film would vary, thus changing its spectral characteristics, whereby colors would appear differently between the upper and lower parts of the screen.
    </p>
    <p num="8">It is demanded for a wide-angle lens coexisting with a three-color-separating lens to suppress the occurrence of such color shading and favorably correct various kinds of aberration, while having a sufficient back focus.</p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="9">In view of such circumstances, it is an object of the present invention to provide a wide-angle lens having a long back focus which is about five times the focal length, while exhibiting a wide angle of 100 degrees in terms of taking angle of view and suppressing the occurrence of color shading.</p>
    <p num="10">It is another object of the present invention to favorably correct various kinds of aberration in the above-mentioned wide-angle lens having a long back focus.</p>

    </p>
    <p num="26">Conditional expressions (1) to (6) will be explained in detail in the following.</p>
    <p num="27">
      Conditional expression (1) defines a range of back focus.
      <br/>
      It is a prerequisite for the wide-angle lens having a long back focus in accordance with this embodiment to secure this range of back focus in order to dispose a three-color-separating optical system 1 between the lens and the image surface.
      <br/>
      If the back focus so short that the lower limit value of the expression is not fulfilled, then it is difficult to dispose the three-color-separating optical system 1.
    </p>
    <p num="28">
      Conditional expression (2) defines the angle formed between a principal ray directed to a screen corner portion and the optical axis.
      <br/>
      Outside its upper and lower limits, there would be a problem that color shading is likely to occur.
    </p>
    <p num="29">
      As mentioned above, color shading occurs due to the fact that light beams are incident on a dichroic film in the three-color-separating optical system 1 at different angles.
      <br/>
      For suppressing the occurrence of such color shading, it is necessary for the exit pupil position to be set far so as to reduce differences in angle of light beams, corresponding to individual portions of the screen, which are incident on the dichroic film of the three-color-separating optical system 1.
    </p>
    <p num="30">
      In this embodiment, the angle formed between the optical axis X and the principal ray passing through the center position of the stop S so as to be directed to a screen corner portion is very small as defined by conditional expression (2), whereby the system can be considered nearly telecentric.
      <br/>
      As a consequence, with the value range defined by conditional expression (2), the exit pupil position can be set considerably far from the imaging surface position, whereby color shading can be prevented from occurring.
    </p>
    <p num="31">
      Conditional expression (3) is concerned with the composite power of the first lens group G1.
      <br/>
      In general, a retro-focus type in which respective lenses having negative and positive refracting powers are successively disposed from the object side has been known as a configuration for yielding a longer back focus in a wide-angle lens.
      <br/>
      This embodiment belongs to the retro-focus type as well.
      <br/>
      Though a longer back focus can be attained as the negative power of the lens on the object side is greater in the retro-focus type, it will be problematic in terms of aberration if the power is too strong.
      <br/>
      Hence, if the power is so weak that the upper limit value of conditional expression (3) is surpassed, then the back focus may be too short.
      <br/>
      If the power is so strong that the lower limit value of the expression is not fulfilled, on the other hand, then it is difficult to correct astigmatism, and Petzval sum becomes greater in the negative direction, thereby making it difficult to correct image surface curvature.
    </p>
    <p num="32">
      Conditional expression (4) is a condition concerning the composite power of the first-a lens group G1a.
      <br/>
      If the negative power is so weak that the upper limit value of the expression is surpassed, then a sufficient back focus may not be obtained.
      <br/>
      If the negative power is so strong that the lower limit value is not fulfilled, then the radius of curvature of the concave surface, on the image surface side, of each of the lenses L1, L2 in the first-a lens group G1a becomes so small that its manufacture will be difficult, and distortion will increase.
    </p>
    <p num="33">
      Conditional expression (5) is concerned with the refractive indexes of the eighth lens L8 and ninth lens L9 forming a cemented lens.
      <br/>
      If the upper limit value of the expression is surpassed, then Petzval sum becomes greater in the negative direction, whereby the image surface curvature increases in the positive direction.
      <br/>
      If the lower limit value of the expression is not fulfilled, on the other hand, it will be unfavorable in that both spherical aberration and image surface curvature become greater in the negative direction.
    </p>
    <p num="34">
      Conditional expression (6) defines the ratio of the radius of curvature R13 of the sixth lens L6 on the image surface side to the axial space between the sixth lens L6 and seventh lens L7.
      <br/>
      If the upper limit value of the expression is surpassed, then it becomes difficult to correct astigmatism.
      <br/>
      If the lower limit value of the expression is not fulfilled, it will be unfavorable in that spherical aberration becomes greater in the negative direction.
