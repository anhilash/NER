      <br/>
      An ultrasound sensor for distance measurement is disclosed.
      <br/>
      The ultrasound sensor has a housing, a ceramic buzzer, a plurality of isolators both received in the housing and a C ring for securing the plurality of isolators in the housing.
      <br/>
      The housing has an elliptical and a circular compartments defined therein.
      <br/>
      The elliptical compartment communicates with the circular compartment and both have a unique shape, which is able to limit the shape of the emitted signal by the ceramic buzzer.
      <br/>
      The limited range of the emitted signal by the ceramic buzzer covers the entire cross section of the vehicle and will not cause a false alarm by reflection from the ground.

      1.
      <br/>
      Field of the Invention
    </p>
    <p num="2">
      The present invention relates to an ultrasound sensor used to measure distance, and more particularly to a sensor for determining and indicating distances between vehicles and obstacles at close range with ultrasound techniques.
      <br/>
      The sensor has a unique shape that covers the entire width of the vehicle without being falsely activated by the reflected ground signal.
    </p>
    <p num="3">2. Description of Related Art</p>
    <p num="4">
      Distance measurement by ultrasound is very helpful for metropolitan drivers.
      <br/>
      Confined by limited parking spaces, most drivers have to depend on their skills to squeeze into a parking space.
      <br/>
      However, when backing or parking vehicles, drivers normally have blind spots, which can cause serious consequences.
      <br/>
      Therefore, an ultrasound sensor for detecting the distance to an object was introduced to the market for drivers to eliminat the dangers of the existence of blind spots.
      <br/>
      Related information about the ultrasound sensor can be seen in U.S. Pat. No. 4,500,977, issued to Gelhard on Feb. 19, 1985 and U.S. Pat. No. 4,437,032 also issued to Gelhard on Mar. 13, 1984. A conventional ultrasound sensor (80) used in vehicles for sounding an alarm when approaching obstacles usually is mounted at the center of a vehicle (90), as shown in FIG. 9.
      <br/>
      It is well known in the art that the sensitivity of the sensor (80) is adjustable and the shape of the emitted signal by the sensor (80) is circular.
      <br/>
      Therefore, for the purpose of covering the entire cross sectional area of the vehicle (80), the diameter of the emitted beam by the sensor (80) is adjusted to be b1, as shown in FIG. 10-A. However, when the ultrasound sensor (80) mounted on the vehicle (90) is activated, a portion of the signal will be reflected by the ground, which will initiate a false alarm informing the driver that the vehicle (90) is approaching a potential obstacle, as shown in FIG. 8-B. To eliminate the possibility of the activation of a false alarm, the sensitivity of the sensor (80) is adjusted to have a diameter b2 which is smaller than b1, as shown in FIG. 11-A. With such a beam diameter, the vehicle (90) is able to detect the distance from an obstacle effectively.
      <br/>
      However, both sides of the vehicle (90) become blind spots for the driver, due to the reduced diameter of the emitted beam by the sensor (80), as shown in FIG. 11-B.
    </p>

      <br/>
      The housing (10) has an elliptical shape defined therein, which means that the width Y1-Y2 is greater than the height X1-X2 thereof as shown in FIG. 2.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, the ceramic buzzer (20) functions as an ultrasound transceiver so as to transmit and receive ultrasound signals.
    </p>
    <p num="14">
      When in assembly, referring to FIG. 3, all the elements of the ultrasound sensor of the invention as shown in FIG. 1 are received in the elliptical compartment (11).
      <br/>
      Then, a layer of silicone rubber (15) fills the circular compartment (12) to seal the circular compartment (12).
      <br/>
      The anode of the ceramic buzzer element is provided with a elliptical wire (201) penetrating through the plurality of isolators (21, 22, 23) and extending outward therefrom and the cathode connects with the bottom of the elliptical compartment (11) and is provided with a circular wire (202) connected to the C ring (14).
      <br/>
      Preferably, the plurality of isolators (21, 22, 23) are a silicone rubber plate for thermal isolation, and felt and cork for sound isolation.
    </p>
    <p num="15">
      Referring to FIG. 4, the working cross section of the ultrasound sensor of the invention is changed due to the elliptical shape of the elliptical compartment (11) and the circular compartment (12).
      <br/>
      Due to the confinement of the elliptical shape of the compartment (11), the beam cross section of the ultrasound sensor has a width (a1) greater than the width of the vehicle (90), as shown in FIG. 5-A, and the bottom of the beam (a2) is above the ground, as shown in FIG. 5-B.
