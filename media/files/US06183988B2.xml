      The present invention is directed to a leukocyte-specific gene Sp140 and its associated protein.
      <br/>
      Since it has structural analogies to other regulatory proteins and is localized in the nuclear body of certain cell types, Sp140 may be a transcription regulator involved in the body's interaction with viruses and in promyelocytic leukemia.
      <br/>
      The Sp140 gene can be used in gene therapy for treating certain viral diseases, autoimmune disorders and cancers, while the Sp140 protein may be useful as a diagnostic and prognostic marker in the analysis of certain autoimmune disorders.

      Field of the Invention
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      The present invention is in the fields of molecular and cellular biology and biomedical diagnostics and therapeutics.
      <br/>
      Specifically, the invention relates to novel nucleic acid molecules, proteins and polypeptide fragments encoded thereby, polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies thereto, and methods of using the nucleic acid molecules, proteins/polypeptides and antibodies in diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic regimens for the control of autoimmune disorders, viral diseases and cancers.

      The nuclear body (NB, also known as nuclear domain 10, PML oncogenic domain, and Kr body) is a nuclear organelle whose function is unknown (Ascoli, C. A., and Maul, G. G., J. Cell. Biol. 112:785-795 (1991); Brasch, K., and Ochs, R. L., Exp. Cell Res. 202:211-223 (1992); Dyck, J. A. et al., Cell 76:333-343 (1994)).
      <br/>
      Using immunohistochemical staining, NBs appear as 5 to 30 discrete, punctate, dot-like regions within the nucleus.
      <br/>
      The NB is distinct from other nuclear domains including those involved in DNA replication and mRNA processing.
      <br/>
      In addition, components of the NB do not co-localize with kinetochores or centromeres (Brasch, K., and Ochs, R. L., Exp. Cell Res. 202:211-223 (1992)).
      <br/>
      The number of NBs in the cell, and the intensity of antibody staining of these structures, increase in response to stimuli including interferons (IFNs), heat shock and viral infection (Ascoli, C. A., and Maul, G. G., J. Cell. Biol. 112:785-795 (1991)).
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      The NB is a target of autoantibodies in the serum of patients with the autoimmune disease primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC).
      <br/>
      Approximately 40% of patients with PBC have antibodies directed against this structure (Evans, J., et al., Arthr. Rheum. 347:31-736 (1991); Szostecki, C. et al., Scand. J. Immunol. 36:555-564 (1992)).
      <br/>
      Serum from patients with PBC was used to identify and characterize a 100-kDa component of the NB which was designated Sp100 (Speckled, 100 kDa) (Szostecki, C. et al., J. Immunol. 145:4338-4347 (1990)).
      <br/>
      The fusion of Sp100 to the LexA DNA binding domain has been shown to activate gene transcription in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and it has been suggested that Sp100 may participate in activation of transcription of specific regions in the genome (Xie, K. et al., Mol. Cell. Biol. 13:6170-6179 (1993)).
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      A second component of the NB, designated NDP52, was characterized using a murine monoclonal antibody that reacted with the NB (Korioth, F., et al., J. Cell. Biol. 130:1-13 (1995)).
      <br/>
      A cDNA encoding NDP52 was identified and the predicted amino acid sequence contained coiled coil, leucine zipper and zinc finger motifs.
      <br/>
      One or more of these domains may be involved in interactions between NDP52 and other components of the NB (Korioth, F., et al., J. Cell. Biol. 130:1-13 (1995)).
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      A third component of the NB, PML, was identified by several investigators studying the t(15;17) translocation associated with human acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) (de The, H. et al., Nature (London) 347:558-561 (1990); Borrow, J. et al., Science 249:1577-1580 (1990); Longo, L. et al., J. Exp. Med. 172:1571-1575 (1990); Kakizuka, A. et al., Cell 66:663-674 (1991)).
      <br/>
      In this translocation, the amino terminal portion of PML is fused to retinoic acid receptor  ALPHA (RAR ALPHA ).
      <br/>
      PML was found to co-localize with Sp100 in the NB (Weis, K. et al., Cell 76:345-356 (1994); Koken, M. H. M. et al., EMBO 13:1073-1083 (1994)).
      <br/>
      Expression of the PML-RAR ALPHA  fusion protein in APL cells appears to disrupt the NB; in these cells, the NB antigens are detected in numerous smaller regions in the nucleus described as "microspeckles." Treatment of APL cells with retinoic acid (RA) results in differentiation of myeloid precursor cells and reformation of NBs (Dyck, J. A. et al., Cell 76:333-343 (1994); Weis, K. et al., Cell 76:345-356 (1994); Koken, M. H. M. et al., EMBO 13:1073-1083 (1994)).
      <br/>
      In patients with APL, treatment with RA results in differentiation of leukemic cells and temporary disease remission (Warrell, R. P. et al., N. Eng. J. Med. 329:177-189 (1993)).
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      PML, like Sp100 and NDP52, is expressed in a wide variety of human cells and established cell lines.
      <br/>
      For example, immunoreactive PML is detectable in myeloid precursor cells as well as in erythroblasts and megakaryocytes in the bone marrow (Daniel, M. T. et al., Blood 82:1858-1867 (1993)).
      <br/>
      In addition, PML has been detected in psoriatic skin lesions, hyperplastic breast and colon tissues, and in the endometrial mucosa during the follicular phase of the menstrual cycle (Koken, M. H. M. et al., Oncogene 10:1315-1324 (1995)).
      <br/>
      In recent studies, it was demonstrated that PML, like Sp100, is a target of autoantibodies in patients with PBC (Stemsdorf, T. et al., Scand. J. Immunol. 42:257-268 (1995)).
    </p>
    <p num="11">
      Recently, a lymphoid-restricted homologue of SP100 termed LYSP100 (for "lymphoid-restricted homologue of SP100") was reported (Dent, A. L. et al., Blood 88(4):1423-1436 (1996)).
      <br/>
      Although found in intact cells as microspeckles associated with the NBs of certain lymphoid cell lines, LYSP100 was reported to be morphologically and spatially distinct from PML in these cells, suggesting that it may represent a novel subnuclear domain.
      <br/>
      LYSP100 mRNA expression was also found to be restricted to lymphoid tissues such as the spleen, thus further distinguishing this gene from SP100 which is more widespread in its expression (Dent, A. L. et al., Blood 88(4):1423-1436 (1996)).
    </p>
    <p num="12">
      With the possible exception of LYSP100 (which has not yet been examined), expression of the previously identified components of the NB is enhanced by treatment with IFNs (Korioth, F., et al., J. Cell. Biol. 130:1-13 (1995); Guldner, H. H. et al., J. Immunol. 149:4067-4073 (1992); Doucas, V. et al., Genes &amp; Devel. 10:196-207 (1996)).
      <br/>
      It has been suggested that IFN induction of increased expression of Sp100 reflects a role for Sp100 in the "anti-viral state" (Guldner, H. H. et al., J. Immunol. 149:4067-4073 (1992)).
      <br/>
      In support of this notion, it has been demonstrated that IFN-induced expression of PML in Hep2 cells is associated with inhibition of adenovirus replication (Doucas, V. et al., Genes &amp; Devel. 10:196-207 (1996)).
    </p>
    <p num="13">
      The NB is a site of interaction between viral and host proteins.
      <br/>
      For example, it has been demonstrated that infection of cells with herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV-1) results in disruption of the NB (Maul, G. G. et al., J. Gen. Virol. 74:2679-2690 (1993); Maul, G. G., and Everett, R. D., J. Gen. Virol. 75:1223-1233 (1994)).
      <br/>
      Using HSV-1 deletion mutants, disruption of the nuclear body was shown to be a result of the action of the viral protein ICP0.
      <br/>
      Recent studies have demonstrated that other viral proteins, including the adenovirus E4-ORF3 protein, also interact with this nuclear organelle (Doucas, V. et al., Genes &amp; Devel. 10:196-207 (1996); Puvion-Dutilleul, F. et al., Exp. Cell. Res. 218:9-16 (1995); Carvalho, T. et al., J. Cell. Biol. 131:45-56 (1995)).

      BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS
      <br/>
      FIG. 1. Immunoblot of the in vitro translation product of the Sp140 cDNA Antibodies in human serum reacted with the 140-kDa translation product, as well as other reticulocyte lysate proteins (Panel A; "+" lane). In contrast, the 140-kDa band was not detected in a lane containing only reticulocyte lysate proteins (Panel A; "-" lane). Rat antiserum directed against Sp140 (amino acids 131-391) also reacted with the 140-kDa translation product (Panel B; "+" lane) but not with reticulocyte lysate proteins (Panel B; "-" lane).
      <br/>
      FIGS. 2A-2C. Panel A: The nucleotide and predicted amino acid sequences of Sp140 (SEQ ID NOs:1 and 2, respectively). The region of similarity between the amino terminal portions of Sp140 and Sp100 is indicated in italics. A presumed nuclear localization sequence is present between amino acids 381-400 (indicated by box). Conserved cysteine/histidine residues in the zinc finger motif are circled. The bromodomain between amino acids 681-715 is underlined. These sequence data are available from GenBank/EMBL/DDBJ under accession number U63420.
      <br/>
      Panel B: Comparison between the amino terminal regions of Sp140 (SEQ ID NO:3) and Sp100 (SEQ ID NO:4). Forty-nine percent of the amino acids in this region are identical.
      <br/>
      Panel C: Comparison between Sp140 amino acids 681-715 (SEQ ID NO:5) and a bromodomain in Saccharomyces cerevisiae protein BDF1 (SEQ ID NO:6). Seventeen of 35 amino acids in this region are identical.
      <br/>
      FIG. 3. Identification of Sp140 mRNA in human tissues by RNA blot hybridization. A membrane containing 2.5  MU g of poly-(A)+ RNA per lane of human spleen, thymus, prostate, testis, ovary, small intestine, colon, and peripheral blood leukocytes was hybridized with a 32 P-radiolabeled SacI/EcoRI fragment of the Sp140 cDNA. After washing under stringent conditions, the membrane was exposed to autoradiography. High levels of mRNA encoding Sp140 were detected in human spleen and peripheral blood leukocytes. To confirm the presence of RNA in each lane, the membrane was subsequently hybridized with a human  BETA -actin cDNA probe.
      <br/>
      FIG. 4. Expression of Sp140 mRNA in myeloid precursor cell lines. Low levels of Sp140 mRNA were detected in HL60 cells (lanes 1 and 4). Treatment of HL60 cells with PMA (lane 2) or DMSO (lane 5) markedly increased Sp140 gene expression. The level of Sp140 mRNA was further increased by combinations of PMA and IFN GAMMA  (lane 3) or DMSO and IFN GAMMA  (lane 6). Low levels of Sp140 mRNA were detected in NB4 cells (lane 7). After five days of incubation with RA, the level of Sp140 mRNA was markedly increased (lane 8). To confirm comparable loading of RNA in each lane, membranes were hybridized with a 10-fold molar excess of 3 P-radiolabeled oligonucleotide complimentary to 18S RNA.
      <br/>
      FIG. 5. Effect of interferon gamma (IFN GAMMA ) treatment on the level of Sp140 mRNA in HL60 cells. Low levels of Sp140 mRNA were detected in untreated HL60 cells (lane 1). Expression of Sp140 mRNA was enhanced 1, 2 and 4 days after addition of IFN GAMMA  (lanes 2, 3 and 4). To confirm comparable loading of RNA in each lane, membranes were hybridized with a 10-fold molar excess of 32 P-radiolabeled oligonucleotide complimentary to 18S RNA.
      <br/>
      FIG. 6. Immunoblot of proteins isolated from DMSO-treated HL60 cells. Serum from a rat immunized with a fusion protein containing GST-Sp140 (131-391) reacted with a 140-kDa protein in DMSO-treated HL60 cells (lane 1). In contrast, normal rat serum did not react with this protein (data not shown). Rat antiserum pre-incubated with recombinant protein did not react with Sp140 (lane 2).
      <br/>
      FIG. 7. Immunohistochemical localization of Sp140 and PML in HL60 cells treated with DMSO and NB4 cells treated with retinoic acid. Affinity-purified rat anti-Sp140 antibodies reacted with dot-like regions in DMSO-treated HL60 cells (panel A). The same staining pattern was seen using mouse monoclonal antibodies directed against PML (panel B). Pre-treatment of rat anti-Sp140 antibodies with recombinant protein blocked the NB staining pattern (panel C). Two color immunohistochemical staining revealed co-localization of Sp140 and PML in the NBs of individual cells (panel D; note the halo of blue surrounding brown-staining NBs, as indicated by arrows). In panels A and C, anti-Sp140 antibodies were revealed with TruBlue peroxidase substrate, resulting, in a blue precipitate. In panels B and D, mouse monoclonal anti-PML antibodies were detected using the DAB substrate, resulting in a brown precipitate. In co-localization studies, Sp140 immunoreactivity was detected using alkaline phosphatase-conjugated reagents and PhThalo Blue. The cells in panels A, C, and D were counterstained lightly with hematoxylin to provide a pale blue contrast, while cells in panel B were counterstained with neutral red dye. Rat anti-Sp140 antiserum reacted with NBs in RA-treated NB4 cells (panel E; DAB brown chromogen). Although the NB staining pattern was most evident in the indicated nucleus (arrow), faint staining of NBs was present in all cells in this field. Mouse monoclonal antibodies directed against PML also reacted with NBs in RA-treated NB4 cells (panel F; TruBlue peroxidase chromogen). Rat antiserum did not react with untreated NB4 cells (panel G).

    </p>
    <p num="19">
      The present invention provides isolated nucleic acid molecules comprising a polynucleotide having the nucleotide sequence shown in FIG. 2A (SEQ ID NO:1).
      <br/>
      The invention further provides isolated nucleic acid molecules comprising a polynucleotide encoding a Sp140 polypeptide having the amino acid sequence shown in FIG. 2A (SEQ ID NO:2), which was determined by sequencing a cloned cDNA.
      <br/>
      As is shown in FIG. 2B, the amino terminal portion of the Sp140 protein of the present invention (SEQ ID NO:3) shares about 49% sequence identity with that of Sp100 (SEQ ID NO:4).
      <br/>
      The nucleotide sequence shown in FIG. 2A (SEQ ID NO:1) was obtained by sequencing a cDNA clone as described below in Example 1.
      <br/>
      The sequence data are available from GenBank/EMBL/DDBJ under accession number U63420.
    </p>
    <p num="20">Nucleic Acid Molecules</p>
    <p num="21">
      Unless otherwise indicated, all nucleotide sequences determined by sequencing a DNA molecule herein were determined by dideoxy sequencing (Sanger, F., Science 214:1205-1210 (1981)), and all amino acid sequences of polypeptides encoded by DNA molecules determined herein were predicted by translation of a DNA sequence determined as above.
      <br/>
      Therefore, as is known in the art for any DNA sequence determined by this approach, any nucleotide sequence determined herein may contain some errors.
      <br/>
      Nucleotide sequences determined by these methods are typically at least about 90% identical, more typically at least about 95% to at least about 99.9% identical to the actual nucleotide sequence of the native DNA molecule.
      <br/>
      As is also known in the art, a single insertion or deletion in a determined nucleotide sequence compared to the actual sequence will cause a frame shift in translation of the nucleotide sequence such that the predicted amino acid sequence encoded by a determined nucleotide sequence will be completely different from the amino acid sequence actually encoded by the sequenced DNA molecule, beginning at the point of such an insertion or deletion.
    </p>
    <p num="22">
      Unless otherwise indicated, each "nucleotide sequence" set forth herein is presented as a sequence of deoxyribonucleotides (abbreviated A, G, C and T).
      <br/>
      However, by "nucleotide sequence" of a nucleic acid molecule or polynucleotide is intended, for a DNA molecule or polynucleotide, a sequence of deoxyribonucleotides, and for an RNA molecule or polynucleotide, the corresponding sequence of ribonucleotides (A, G, C and U), where each thymidine deoxyribonucleotide (T) in the specified deoxyribonucleotide sequence is replaced by the ribonucleotide uridine (U).
      <br/>
      For instance, reference to an RNA molecule having the sequence of SEQ ID NO:1 set forth using deoxyribonucleotide abbreviations is intended to indicate an RNA molecule having a sequence in which each deoxyribonucleotide A, G or C of SEQ ID NO:1 has been replaced by the corresponding ribonucleotide A, G or C, and each deoxyribonucleotide T has been replaced by a ribonucleotide U.
    </p>
    <p num="23">
      Using the information provided herein, such as the nucleotide sequence in FIG. 2A, a nucleic acid molecule of the present invention encoding a Sp140 polypeptide may be obtained using standard cloning and screening procedures, such as those for cloning cDNAs using mRNA as starting material.
      <br/>
      Illustrative of the invention, the nucleic acid molecule described in FIG. 2A (SEQ ID NO:1) was discovered in a cDNA library derived from HepG2 human hepatocellular carcinoma cells.
      <br/>
      The gene was also identified in cDNA libraries derived from human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) and human placenta.
      <br/>
      The determined nucleotide sequence of the Sp140 cDNA of FIG. 2A (SEQ ID NO:1) is approximately 2,905 bp in length, contains an open reading frame from bp 107 to 2,365 encoding a protein of 753 amino acid residues (SEQ ID NO:2), with an initiation codon at positions 107-110 of the nucleotide sequence in FIG. 2A (SEQ ID NO:1) preceded by an in-frame stop codon.
      <br/>
      The deduced molecular weight of the predicted Sp140 polypeptide (SEQ ID NO:2) is about 140 kDa.
      <br/>
      The amino acid sequence of the predicted Sp140 polypeptide is shown in FIG. 2A (SEQ ID NO:2) from amino acid residue 1 to residue 753.
      <br/>
      As shown in FIG. 2B, the amino terminal portion of Sp140 (amino acid residues 29-157; SEQ ID NO:3) is about 49% identical to that of the NB-associated protein Sp100 (residues 40-168; SEQ ID NO:4).

    <p num="24">
      As indicated, nucleic acid molecules of the present invention may be in the form of RNA, such as mRNA, or in the form of DNA, including, for instance, cDNA and genomic DNA obtained by cloning or produced synthetically.
      <br/>
      The DNA may be double-stranded or single-stranded.
      <br/>
      Single-stranded DNA or RNA may be the coding strand, also known as the sense strand, or it may be the non-coding strand, also referred to as the anti-sense strand.

      By "isolated" nucleic acid molecule(s) is intended a nucleic acid molecule, DNA or RNA, which has been removed from its native environment For example, recombinant DNA molecules contained in a vector are considered isolated for the purposes of the present invention.
      <br/>
      Further examples of isolated DNA molecules include recombinant DNA molecules maintained in heterologous host cells or purified (partially or substantially) DNA molecules in solution.
      <br/>
      Isolated RNA molecules include in vivo or in vitro RNA transcripts of the DNA molecules of the present invention.
      <br/>
      Isolated nucleic acid molecules according to the present invention further include such molecules produced synthetically.

      Isolated nucleic acid molecules of the present invention include DNA molecules comprising an open reading frame (ORF) with an initiation codon at positions 107-110 of the nucleotide sequence shown in FIG. 2A (SEQ ID NO:1); DNA molecules comprising the coding sequence for the mature Sp140 protein shown in FIG. 2A (SEQ ID NO:2); and DNA molecules which comprise a sequence substantially different from those described above but which, due to the degeneracy of the genetic code, still encode the Sp140 protein.
      <br/>
      Since the genetic code is well known in the art, one skilled in the art can make the degenerate variants described above using routine techniques without undue experimentation.
    </p>
    <p num="27">
      The present invention is further directed to fragments of the isolated nucleic acid molecules described herein.

      <br/>
      Of course, larger fragments 50-2000 nt in length are also useful according to the present invention as are fragments corresponding to most, if not all, of the nucleotide sequence shown in FIG. 2A (SEQ ID NO:1).
      <br/>
      By a fragment at least 20 nt in length, for example, is intended fragments which include 20 or more contiguous bases from the nucleotide sequence as shown in FIG. 1 (SEQ ID NO:1).
      <br/>
      Since the nucleotide sequence shown in FIG. 2A (SEQ ID NO:1) is provided, generating such DNA fragments would be routine to the skilled artisan.
      <br/>
      For example, restriction endonuclease cleavage or shearing by sonication could easily be used to generate fragments of various sizes.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, such fragments could be generated synthetically.
    </p>
    <p num="28">
      Preferred nucleic acid fragments of the present invention include nucleic acid molecules encoding epitope-bearing portions of the Sp140 protein.

      <br/>
      The inventors have determined that the above polypeptide fragments are antigenic regions of the Sp140 protein.
      <br/>
      Methods for determining other such epitope-bearing portions of the Sp140 protein are described in detail below.
    </p>
    <p num="29">
      In another aspect, the invention provides an isolated nucleic acid molecule comprising a polynucleotide which hybridizes under stringent hybridization conditions to a portion of the polynucleotide in a nucleic acid molecule of the invention described above, for instance, a nucleic acid molecule having a nucleotide sequence as set forth in FIG. 2A (SEQ ID NO:1).

      <br/>
      These hybridizing polynucleotides are useful as diagnostic probes and primers as discussed above and in more detail below.

    <p num="31">
      Of course, polynucleotides hybridizing to a larger portion of the reference polynucleotide (e.g., the nucleic acid molecule having a nucleotide sequence set forth in FIG. 2A (SEQ ID NO:1)), for instance, a portion 50-1000 nt in length, or even to the entire length of the reference polynucleotide, are also useful as probes according to the present invention, as are polynucleotides corresponding to most, if not all, of the nucleotide sequence of the nucleotide sequence as shown in FIG. 2A (SEQ ID NO:1).

      By a portion of a polynucleotide of "at least 20 nt in length," for example, is intended 20 or more contiguous nucleotides from the nucleotide sequence of the reference polynucleotide (e.g., the nucleotide sequence as shown in FIG. 2A (SEQ ID NO:1)).
      <br/>
      As indicated, such portions are useful diagnostically either as a probe according to conventional DNA hybridization techniques or as primers for amplification of a target sequence by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), as described, for instance, in Molecular Cloning, A Laboratory Manual, 2nd. edition, Sambrook, J., Fritsch, E.

      As indicated, nucleic acid molecules of the present invention which encode a Sp140 polypeptide may include, but are not limited to those encoding the amino acid sequence of the mature polypeptide, by itself; the coding sequence for the mature polypeptide and additional sequences, such as those encoding a leader or secretory sequence, such as a pre-, pro- or prepro-protein sequence; the coding sequence of the mature Sp140 polypeptide, with or without the aforementioned additional coding sequences, together with additional, non-coding sequences, including for example, but not limited to introns and non-coding 5' and 3' sequences, such as the transcribed, non-translated sequences that play a role in transcription, mRNA processing, including splicing and polyadenylation signals, for example; ribosome binding and stability of mRNA; an additional coding sequence which codes for additional amino acids, such as those which provide additional functionalities.
      <br/>
      Thus, the sequence encoding the polypeptide may be fused to a marker sequence, such as a sequence encoding a peptide which facilitates purification of the fused polypeptide.
      <br/>
      In certain preferred embodiments of this aspect of the invention, the marker amino acid sequence is a hexa-histidine peptide, such as the tag provided in a pQE vector (Qiagen, Inc.), among others, many of which are commercially available.
      <br/>
      As described in Gentz et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 86:821-824 (1989), for instance, hexa-histidine provides for convenient purification of the fusion protein.
      <br/>
      The "HA" tag is another peptide useful for purification which corresponds to an epitope derived from the influenza hemagglutinin protein, which has been described by Wilson et al., Cell 37: 767 (1984).
      <br/>
      As discussed below, other such fusion proteins include the Sp140 polypeptide fused to glutathione S-transferase (GST) at the N- or C-terminus.
    </p>
    <p num="34">
      The present invention further relates to variants of the nucleic acid molecules of the present invention, which encode portions, analogs or derivatives of the Sp140 protein.
      <br/>
      Variants may occur naturally, such as a natural allelic variant.
      <br/>
      By an "allelic variant" is intended one of several alternate forms of a gene occupying a given locus on a chromosome of an organism (see Genes II, Lewin, B., ed., John Wiley &amp; Sons, New York (1985)).
      <br/>
      Non-naturally occurring variants may be produced using mutagenesis techniques that are well-known in the art.
    </p>
    <p num="35">
      Such variants include those produced by nucleotide substitutions, deletions or additions.
      <br/>
      The substitutions, deletions or additions may involve one or more nucleotides.
      <br/>
      The variants may be altered in coding regions, non-coding regions, or both.
      <br/>
      Alterations in the coding regions may produce conservative or non-conservative amino acid substitutions, deletions or additions.
      <br/>
      Especially preferred among these are silent substitutions, additions and deletions, which do not alter the properties and activities of the Sp140 protein or portions thereof.
      <br/>
      Also especially preferred in this regard are conservative substitutions.
      <br/>
      Most highly preferred are nucleic acid molecules encoding the mature protein having the amino acid sequence shown in FIG. 1 (SEQ ID NO:2).
    </p>
    <p num="36">Further embodiments of the invention include isolated nucleic acid molecules comprising a polynucleotide having a nucleotide sequence at least 90% identical, and more preferably at least 95%, 96%, 97%, 98% or 99% identical to (a) a nucleotide sequence corresponding to that set forth in FIG. 2A (SEQ ID NO:1); (b) a nucleotide sequence encoding the Sp140 polypeptide having an amino acid sequence as set forth in FIG. 2A (SEQ ID NO:2); or (c) a nucleotide sequence complementary to either of the nucleotide sequences in (a) or (b).</p>
    <p num="37">
      By a polynucleotide having a nucleotide sequence at least, for example, 95% "identical" to a reference nucleotide sequence encoding a Sp140 polypeptide is intended that the nucleotide sequence of the polynucleotide is identical to the reference sequence except that the polynucleotide sequence may include up to five point mutations per each 100 nucleotides of the reference nucleotide sequence encoding the Sp140 polypeptide.
      <br/>
      In other words, to obtain a polynucleotide having a nucleotide sequence at least 95% identical to a reference nucleotide sequence, up to 5% of the nucleotides in the reference sequence may be deleted or substituted with another nucleotide, or a number of nucleotides up to 5% of the total nucleotides in the reference sequence may be inserted into the reference sequence.
      <br/>
      These mutations of the reference sequence may occur at the 5' or 3' terminal positions of the reference nucleotide sequence or anywhere between those terminal positions, interspersed either individually among nucleotides in the reference sequence or in one or more contiguous groups within the reference sequence.
    </p>
    <p num="38">
      As a practical matter, whether any particular nucleic acid molecule is at least 90%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98% or 99% identical to, for instance, the nucleotide sequence shown in FIG. 2A (SEQ ID NO:1) can be determined conventionally using known computer programs such as the BESTFIT program (Wisconsin Sequence Analysis Package, Version 8 for Unix, Genetics Computer Group, University Research Park, 575 Science Drive, Madison, Wis. 53711. BESTFIT uses the local homology algorithm of Smith and Waterman, Adv.
      <br/>
      Appl. Math. 2: 482-489 (1981), to find the best segment of homology between two sequences.
      <br/>
      When using BESTFIT or any other sequence alignment program to determine whether a particular sequence is, for instance, 95% identical to a reference sequence according to the present invention, the parameters are set, of course, such that the percentage of identity is calculated over the full length of the reference nucleotide sequence and that gaps in homology of up to 5% of the total number of nucleotides in the reference sequence are allowed.
    </p>
    <p num="39">
      The present application is directed to nucleic acid molecules at least 90%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98% or 99% identical to the nucleic acid sequence shown in FIG. 2A (SEQ ID NO:1), irrespective of whether they encode a polypeptide having the activity of Sp140.
      <br/>
      This is because even where a particular nucleic acid molecule does not encode a polypeptide having Sp140 activity, one of skill in the art would still know how to use the nucleic acid molecule, for instance, as a hybridization probe or a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) primer.
      <br/>
      Uses of the nucleic acid molecules of the present invention that do not encode a polypeptide having Sp140 activity include, inter alia, (1) isolating the Sp140 gene or allelic variants thereof in a cDNA library; (2) in situ hybridization (e.g., "FISH") to metaphase chromosomal spreads to provide precise chromosomal location of the Sp140 gene, as described elsewhere (Verma et al., Human Chromosomes: A Manual of Basic Techniques, Pergamon Press, New York (1988)); and (3) northern blot analysis for detecting Sp140 mRNA expression in specific tissues.
    </p>
    <p num="40">
      Preferred, however, are nucleic acid molecules having sequences at least 90%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98% or 99% identical to the nucleic acid sequence shown in FIG. 2A (SEQ ID NO:1) which do, in fact, encode a polypeptide having Sp140 protein activity.
      <br/>
      By "a polypeptide having Sp140 activity" is intended polypeptides exhibiting activity similar, but not necessarily identical, to an activity of the Sp140 protein of the invention, as measured in a particular biological assay.
    </p>
    <p num="41">Although the degree of activity need not be identical to that of the Sp140 protein, preferably, "a polypeptide having Sp140 protein activity" will exhibit substantially similar activity as compared to the Sp140 protein (i.e., the candidate polypeptide will exhibit greater activity or not more than about twenty-fold less and, preferably, not more than about ten-fold less activity relative to the reference Sp140 protein).</p>
    <p num="42">
      Of course, due to the degeneracy of the genetic code, one of ordinary skill in the art will immediately recognize that a large number of the nucleic acid molecules having a sequence at least 90%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, or 99% identical to the nucleic acid sequence of the deposited cDNA or the nucleic acid sequence shown in FIG. 2A (SEQ ID NO:1) will encode a polypeptide "having Sp140 protein activity." In fact, since degenerate variants of these nucleotide sequences all encode the same polypeptide, this will be clear to the skilled artisan even without performing the above described comparison assay.
      <br/>
      It will be further recognized in the art that, for such nucleic acid molecules that are not degenerate variants, a reasonable number will also encode a polypeptide having Sp140 protein activity.
      <br/>
      This is because the skilled artisan is fully aware of amino acid substitutions that are either less likely or not likely to significantly effect protein function (e.g., replacing one aliphatic amino acid with a second aliphatic amino acid).
      <br/>
      Guidance concerning how to make phenotypically silent amino acid substitutions is provided in Bowie, J. U., et al., Science 247:1306-1310 (1990) and in the references cited therein.

    <p num="43">Vectors and Host Cells</p>
    <p num="44">The present invention also relates to vectors which comprise the isolated DNA molecules of the present invention, host cells which are genetically engineered with the recombinant vectors, and the production of Sp140 polypeptides or fragments thereof by recombinant techniques.</p>
    <p num="45">
      Recombinant constructs may be introduced into host cells using well known techniques such as infection, transduction, transfection, electroporation and transformation.
      <br/>
      The vector may be, for example, a phage, plasmid, viral or retroviral vector.
      <br/>
      Retroviral vectors may be replication competent or replication defective.
      <br/>
      In the latter case, viral propagation generally will occur only in complementing host cells.
    </p>
    <p num="46">
      The polynucleotides may be joined to a vector containing a selectable marker for propagation in a host.
      <br/>
      Generally, a plasmid vector is introduced in a precipitate, such as a calcium phosphate precipitate, or in a complex with a charged lipid.
      <br/>
      If the vector is a virus, it may be packaged in vitro using an appropriate packaging cell line and then transduced into host cells.
    </p>
    <p num="47">
      Preferred are vectors comprising cis-acting control regions to the polynucleotide of interest.
      <br/>
      Appropriate trans-acting factors may be supplied by the host, supplied by a complementing vector or supplied by the vector itself upon introduction into the host.
    </p>
    <p num="48">
      In certain preferred embodiments in this regard, the vectors provide for specific expression, which may be inducible and/or cell type-specific.
      <br/>
      Particularly preferred among such vectors are those inducible by environmental factors that are easy to manipulate, such as temperature and nutrient additives.
    </p>
    <p num="49">Expression vectors useful in the present invention include chromosomal-, episomal- and virus-derived vectors, e.g., vectors derived from bacterial plasmids, bacteriophage, yeast episomes, yeast chromosomal elements, viruses such as baculoviruses, papovaviruses, vaccinia viruses, adenoviruses, fowl pox viruses, pseudorabies viruses and retroviruses, and vectors derived from combinations thereof, such as cosmids and phagemids.</p>
    <p num="50">
      The DNA insert should be operatively linked to an appropriate promoter, such as the phage lambda PL promoter, the E. coli lac, trp and tac promoters, the SV40 early and late promoters and promoters of retroviral LTRs, to name a few.
      <br/>
      Other suitable promoters will be known to the skilled artisan.
      <br/>
      The expression constructs will further contain sites for transcription initiation, termination and, in the transcribed region, a ribosome binding site for translation.
      <br/>
      The coding portion of the mature transcripts expressed by the constructs will preferably include a translation initiating at the beginning and a termination codon (UAA, UGA or UAG) appropriately positioned at the end of the polypeptide to be translated.
    </p>
    <p num="51">
      As indicated, the expression vectors will preferably include at least one selectable marker.
      <br/>
      Such markers include dihydrofolate reductase or neomycin resistance for eukaryotic cell culture and tetracycline or ampicillin resistance genes for culturing in E. coli and other bacteria.
      <br/>
      Representative examples of appropriate hosts include, but are not limited to, bacterial cells, such as E. coli, Streptomyces and Salmonella typhimurium cells; fungal cells, such as yeast cells, including Saccharomyces spp.; insect cells such as Drosophila S2 and Spodoptera Sf9 or Sf21 cells; mammalian cells such as CHO, COS, VERO and Bowes melanoma cells; and plant cells.
      <br/>
      Appropriate culture mediums and conditions for the above-described host cells are well-known in the art.
    </p>
    <p num="52">
      Among vectors preferred for use in bacteria include pQE70, pQE60 and pQE-9, available from Qiagen; pBS vectors, Phagescript vectors, Bluescript vectors, pNH8A, pNH16a, pNH18A, pNH46A, available from Stratagene; pcDNA3 available from Invitrogen; and pGEX, ptrc99a, pKK223-3, pKK233-3, pDR540, pRIT5 available from Pharmacia.
      <br/>
      Among preferred eukaryotic vectors are pWLNEO, pSV2CAT, pOG44, pXT1 and pSG available from Stratagene; and pSVK3, pBPV, pMSG and pSVL available from Pharmacia.
      <br/>
      Other suitable vectors will be readily apparent to the skilled artisan.
    </p>
    <p num="53">
      Among known bacterial promoters suitable for use in the present invention include the E. coli lacI and lacZ promoters, the T3 and T7 promoters, the gpt promoter, the lambda PR and PL promoters and the trp promoter.
      <br/>
      Suitable eukaryotic promoters include the CMV immediate early promoter, the HSV thymidine kinase promoter, the early and late SV40 promoters, the promoters of retroviral LTRs, such as those of the Rous sarcoma virus (RSV), and metallothionein promoters, such as the mouse metallothionein-I promoter.
    </p>
    <p num="54">
      Introduction of the construct into the host cell can be effected by calcium phosphate transfection, DEAE-dextran mediated transfection, cationic lipid-mediated transfection, electroporation, transduction, infection or other methods.
      <br/>
      Such methods are described in many standard laboratory manuals, such as Davis et al., Basic Methods In Molecular Biology (1986).
    </p>
    <p num="55">
      Transcription of the DNA encoding the polypeptides of the present invention by higher eukaryotes may be increased by inserting an enhancer sequence into the vector.
      <br/>
      Enhancers are cis-acting elements of DNA, usually about from 10-300 bp that act to increase transcriptional activity of a promoter in a given host cell-type.
      <br/>
      Examples of enhancers include the SV40 enhancer, which is located on the late side of the replication origin at bp 100-270, the cytomegalovirus early promoter enhancer, the polyoma enhancer on the late side of the replication origin, and adenovirus enhancers.
    </p>
    <p num="56">
      For secretion of the translated protein into the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum, into the periplasmic space or into the extracellular environment, appropriate secretion signals may be incorporated into the expressed polypeptide.
      <br/>
      The signals may be endogenous to the polypeptide or they may be heterologous signals.
    </p>
    <p num="57">
      The polypeptide may be expressed in a modified form, such as a fusion protein, and may include not only secretion signals, but also additional heterologous functional regions.
      <br/>
      For instance, a region of additional amino acids, particularly charged amino acids, may be added to the N-terminus of the polypeptide to improve stability and persistence in the host cell, during purification, or during subsequent handling and storage.
      <br/>
      Also, peptide moieties may be added to the polypeptide to facilitate purification.
      <br/>
      Such regions may be removed prior to final preparation of the polypeptide.
      <br/>
      The addition of peptide moieties to polypeptides to engender secretion or excretion, to improve stability and to facilitate purification, among others, are familiar and routine techniques in the art.
      <br/>
      A preferred fusion protein comprises a heterologous region from glutathione S-transferase (GST).
      <br/>
      For example, the plasmid encoding a portion, or all, of the Sp140 polypeptide depicted in FIG. 2A (SEQ ID NO:2) may be ligated into a GST expression vector such as pGEX (available from Pharmacia).
      <br/>
      This plasmid may then be used to transform host cells, and expression of the GST-Sp140 fusion protein may be induced by treatment of the transformed host cells with IPTG.
      <br/>
      The fusion protein comprising the Sp140 polypeptide or fragment thereof can then be purified by affinity chromatography selective for GST, as described (Smith, D. B, and Johnson, K. S., Gene 67:31-40 (1988)).
    </p>
    <p num="58">
      The Sp140 protein can be recovered and purified from recombinant cell cultures by well-known methods including ammonium sulfate or ethanol precipitation, acid extraction, anion or cation exchange chromatography, phosphocellulose chromatography, hydrophobic interaction chromatography, affinity chromatography, hydroxylapatite chromatography and lectin chromatography.
      <br/>
      Most preferably, high performance liquid chromatography ("HPLC") is employed for purification.
      <br/>
      Polypeptides of the present invention include naturally purified products, products of chemical synthetic procedures, and products produced by recombinant techniques from a prokaryotic or eukaryotic host, including, for example, bacterial, yeast, higher plant, insect and mammalian cells.
      <br/>
      Depending upon the host employed in a recombinant production procedure, the polypeptides of the present invention may be glycosylated or may be non-glycosylated.
      <br/>
      In addition, polypeptides of the invention may also include an initial modified methionine residue, in some cases as a result of host-mediated processes.
    </p>
    <p num="59">Sp140 Polypeptides and Fragments</p>
    <p num="60">
      The invention further provides an isolated Sp140 polypeptide having the amino acid sequence encoded by the isolated nucleic acid molecule depicted in FIG. 2A (SEQ ID NO:1), the amino acid sequence in FIG. 2A (SEQ ID NO:2), or a peptide or polypeptide comprising a portion of the above polypeptides.
      <br/>
      The terms "peptide" and "oligopeptide" are considered synonymous (as is commonly recognized) and each term can be used interchangeably as the context requires to indicate a chain of at least to amino acids coupled by peptidyl linkages.
      <br/>
      The word "polypeptide" is used herein for chains containing more than ten amino acid residues.
      <br/>
      All oligopeptide and polypeptide formulas or sequences herein are written from left to right and in the direction from amino terminus to carboxy terminus.
    </p>
    <p num="61">
      It will be recognized in the art that some amino acid sequences of the Sp140 polypeptide can be varied without significant effect of the structure or function of the protein.
      <br/>
      If such differences in sequence are contemplated, it should be remembered that there will be critical areas on the protein which determine activity.
      <br/>
      In general, it is possible to replace residues which form the tertiary structure, provided that residues performing a similar function are used.
      <br/>
      In other instances, the type of residue may be completely unimportant if the alteration occurs at a non-critical region of the protein.
    </p>
    <p num="62">
      Thus, the invention further includes variations of the Sp140 polypeptide which show substantial Sp140 polypeptide activity or which include regions of Sp140 protein such as the protein portions discussed below.
      <br/>
      Such mutants include deletions, insertions, inversions, repeats, and type substitutions (for example, substituting one hydrophilic residue for another, but not strongly hydrophilic for strongly hydrophobic as a rule).
      <br/>
      Small changes or such "neutral" amino acid substitutions will generally have little effect on activity.
    </p>
    <p num="63">
      Typically seen as conservative substitutions are the replacements, one for another, among the aliphatic amino acids Ala, Val, Leu and Ile; interchange of the hydroxyl residues Ser and Thr, exchange of the acidic residues Asp and Glu, substitution between the amide residues Asn and Gln, exchange of the basic residues Lys and Arg and replacements among the aromatic residues Phe, Tyr.
      <br/>
      As indicated in detail above, further guidance concerning which amino acid changes are likely to be phenotypically silent (i.e., are not likely to have a significant deleterious effect on a function) can be found in Bowie, J. U., et al., Science 247:1306-1310 (1990).

    <p num="64">
      Thus, the fragment, derivative or analog of the polypeptide of FIG. 2A (SEQ ID NO:2), or that encoded by the isolated nucleic acid molecule depicted in FIG. 2A (SEQ ID NO:1), may be (a) one in which one or more of the amino acid residues are substituted with a conserved or non-conserved amino acid residue (preferably a conserved amino acid residue) and such substituted amino acid residue may or may not be one encoded by the genetic code; (b) one in which one or more of the amino acid residues includes a substituent group; (c) one in which the mature polypeptide is fused with another compound, such as a compound to increase the half-life of the polypeptide (for example, polyethylene glycol); or (d) one in which the additional amino acids are fused to the mature polypeptide, such as a GST fusion region peptide or leader or secretory sequence or a sequence which is employed for purification of the mature polypeptide or a proprotein sequence.

      In another aspect, the invention provides a peptide or polypeptide comprising an epitope-bearing portion of a polypeptide of the invention.
      <br/>
      The epitope of this polypeptide portion is an immunogenic or antigenic epitope of a polypeptide of the invention.
      <br/>
      An "immunogenic epitope" is defined as a part of a protein that elicits an antibody response when the whole protein is the immunogen.
      <br/>
      These immunogenic epitopes are believed to be confined to a few loci on the molecule.
      <br/>
      On the other hand, a region of a protein molecule to which an antibody can bind is defined as an "antigenic epitope." The number of immunogenic epitopes of a protein generally is less than the number of antigenic epitopes.
      <br/>
      See, for instance, Geysen et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 81:3998-4002 (1983).
    </p>
    <p num="72">
      As to the selection of peptides or polypeptides bearing an antigenic epitope (i.e., that contain a region of a protein molecule to which an antibody can bind), it is well known in that art that relatively short synthetic peptides that mimic part of a protein sequence are routinely capable of eliciting an antiserum that reacts with the partially mimicked protein.
      <br/>
      See, for instance, Sutcliffe, J. G., et al., Science 219:660-666 (1983).
      <br/>
      Peptides capable of eliciting protein-reactive sera are frequently represented in the primary sequence of a protein, can be characterized by a set of simple chemical rules, and are confined neither to immunodominant regions of intact proteins (i.e., immunogenic epitopes) nor to the amino or carboxyl terminals.
      <br/>
      Peptides that are extremely hydrophobic and those of six or fewer residues generally are ineffective at inducing antibodies that bind to the mimicked protein; longer, peptides, especially those containing proline residues, usually are effective.
    </p>
    <p num="73">
      Antigenic epitope-bearing peptides and polypeptides of the invention are therefore useful to raise antibodies, including polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies mad as described below, that bind specifically to a polypeptide of the invention.
      <br/>
      Thus, a high proportion of hybridomas obtained by fusion of spleen cells from donors immunized with an antigen epitope-bearing peptide generally secrete antibody reactive with the native protein (Sutcliffe et al., supra, at 663).
      <br/>
      The antibodies raised by antigenic epitope-bearing peptides or polypeptides are useful to detect the mimicked protein, and antibodies to different peptides may be used for tracking the fate of various regions of a protein precursor which undergoes post-translational processing.
      <br/>
      The peptides and anti-peptide antibodies may be used in a variety of qualitative or quantitative assays for the mimicked protein, for instance in competition assays since it has been shown that even short peptides (e.g., about 9 amino acids) can bind and displace the larger peptides in immunoprecipitation assays.
      <br/>
      See, for instance, Wilson et al., Cell 37:767-778 (1984).
      <br/>
      The anti-peptide antibodies of the invention also are useful for purification of the mimicked protein, for instance, by adsorption chromatography using methods well-known in the art.
    </p>
    <p num="74">
      Antigenic epitope-bearing peptides and polypeptides of the invention designed according to the above guidelines preferably contain a sequence of at least seven, more preferably at least nine and most preferably between about 15 to about 30 amino acids contained within the amino acid sequence of a polypeptide of the invention.
      <br/>
      However, peptides or polypeptides comprising a larger portion of an amino acid sequence of a polypeptide of the invention, containing about 30 to about 50 amino acids, or any length up to and including the entire amino acid sequence of a polypeptide of the invention, also are considered epitope-bearing peptides or polypeptides of the invention and also are useful for inducing antibodies that react with the mimicked protein.
      <br/>
      Preferably, the amino acid sequence of the epitope-bearing peptide is selected to provide substantial solubility in aqueous solvents (i.e., the sequence includes relatively hydrophilic residues and highly hydrophobic sequences are preferably avoided); and sequences containing proline residues are particularly preferred.
    </p>
    <p num="75">
      Non-limiting examples of antigenic polypeptides or peptides that can be used to generate Sp140-specific antibodies include: a polypeptide comprising amino acid residues from about 131 to about 391 in FIG. 2A (SEQ ID NO:2); a polypeptide comprising amino acid residues from about 131 to about 300 in FIG. 2A (SEQ ID NO:2); a polypeptide comprising amino acid residues from about 131 to about 250 in FIG. 2A (SEQ ID NO:2); a polypeptide comprising amino acid residues from about 131 to about 200 in FIG. 2A (SEQ ID NO:2); and a polypeptide comprising amino acid residues from about 131 to about 150 in FIG. 2A (SEQ ID NO:2).
      <br/>
      As indicated above, the inventors have determined that the above polypeptide fragments are antigenic regions of the Sp140 protein.
    </p>
    <p num="76">
      The epitope-bearing peptides and polypeptides of the invention may be produced by any conventional means for making peptides or polypeptides including recombinant means using nucleic acid molecules of the invention.
      <br/>
      For instance, a short epitope-bearing amino acid sequence may be fused to a larger polypeptide which acts as a carrier during recombinant production and purification, as well as during immunization to produce anti-peptide antibodies.
      <br/>
      Epitope-bearing peptides also may be synthesized using known methods of chemical synthesis such as the "Simultaneous Multiple Peptide Synthesis (SMPS)" process (Houghten, R. A., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 82:5131-5135 (1985); U.S. Pat. No. 4,631,211).

      Immunogenic epitope-bearing peptides of the invention, i.e., those parts of a protein that elicit an antibody response when the whole protein is the immunogen, are identified according to methods known in the art.
      <br/>
      For instance, Geysen et al., supra, discloses a procedure for rapid concurrent synthesis on solid supports of hundreds of peptides of sufficient purity to react in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.
      <br/>
      Interaction of synthesized peptides with antibodies is then easily detected without removing them from the support.
      <br/>
      In this manner a peptide bearing an immunogenic epitope of a desired protein may be identified routinely by one of ordinary skill in the art.
      <br/>
      For instance, the immunologically important epitope in the coat protein of foot-and-mouth disease virus was located by Geysen et al. supra with a resolution of seven amino acids by synthesis of an overlapping set of all 208 possible hexapeptides covering the entire 213 amino acid sequence of the protein.
      <br/>
      Then, a complete replacement set of peptides in which all 20 amino acids were substituted in turn at every position within the epitope were synthesized, and the particular amino acids conferring specificity for the reaction with antibody were determined.
      <br/>
      Thus, peptide analogs of the epitope-bearing peptides of the invention can be made routinely by this method. U.S. Pat. No. 4,708,781 to Geysen (1987) further describes this method of identifying a peptide bearing an immunogenic epitope of a desired protein.
    </p>
    <p num="78">
      Further still, U.S. Pat. No. 5,194,392 to Geysen (1990) describes a general method of detecting or determining the sequence of monomers (amino acids or other compounds) which is a topological equivalent of the epitope (i.e., a "mimotope") which is complementary to a particular paratope (antigen binding site) of an antibody of interest.
      <br/>
      More generally, U.S. Pat. No. 4,433,092 to Geysen (1989) describes a method of detecting or determining a sequence of monomers which is a topographical equivalent of a ligand which is complementary to the ligand binding site of a particular receptor of interest.
      <br/>
      Similarly, U.S. Pat. No. 5,480,971 to Houghten, R. A. et al. (1996) on Peralkylated Oligopeptide Mixtures discloses linear C1 -C7 -alkyl peralkylated oligopeptides and sets and libraries of such peptides, as well as methods for using such oligopeptide sets and libraries for determining the sequence of a peralkylated oligopeptide that preferentially binds to an acceptor molecule of interest.
      <br/>
      Thus, non-peptide analogs of the epitope-bearing peptides of the invention also can be made routinely by these methods.

    <p num="79">
      As one of skill in the art will appreciate, Sp140 polypeptides of the present invention and epitope-bearing fragments thereof may be immobilized onto a solid support, by techniques that are well-known and routine in the art.
      <br/>
      By "solid support" is intended any solid support to which a peptide can be immobilized.
      <br/>
      Such solid supports include, but are not limited to nitrocellulose, diazocellulose, glass, polystyrene, polyvinylchloride, polypropylene, polyethylene, dextran, Sepharose, agar, starch, nylon, beads and microtitre plates.
      <br/>
      Preferred are beads made of glass, latex or a magnetic material.
      <br/>
      Linkage of the peptide of the invention to a solid support can be accomplished by attaching one or both ends of the peptide to the support.
      <br/>
      Attachment may also be made at one or more internal sites in the peptide.
      <br/>
      Multiple attachments (both internal and at the ends of the peptide) may also be used according to the invention.
      <br/>
      Attachment can be via an amino acid linkage group such as a primary amino group, a carboxyl group, or a sulfhydryl (SH) group or by chemical linkage groups such as with cyanogen bromide (CNBr) linkage through a spacer.
      <br/>
      For non-covalent attachments, addition of an affinity tag sequence to the peptide can be used such as GST (Smith, D. B., and Johnson, K. S., Gene 67:31 (1988)), polyhistidines (Hochuli, E., et al., J. Chromatog. 411:77 (1987)), or biotin.
      <br/>
      Such affinity tags may be used for the reversible attachment of the peptide to the support.
      <br/>
      Such immobilized polypeptides or fragments will also be useful, for example, in diagnostic assays determining the presence of antibodies directed against Sp140 in the serum of patients suffering from an autoimmmune, viral or neoplastic disease, as described below.
    </p>
    <p num="80">
      As one of skill in the art will also appreciate, Sp140 polypeptides of the present invention and the epitope-bearing fragments thereof described above can be combined with parts of the constant domain of immunoglobulins (IgG), resulting in chimeric polypeptides.
      <br/>
      These fusion proteins facilitate purification and show an increased half-life in vivo.
      <br/>
      This has been shown, e.g., for chimeric proteins consisting of the first two domains of the human CD4-polypeptide and various domains of the constant regions of the heavy or light chains of mammalian immunoglobulins (EP 0 394,827; Traunecker et al., Nature 331:84-86 (1988)).
      <br/>
      Fusion proteins that have a disulfide-linked dimeric structure due to the IgG part can also be more efficient in binding and neutralizing other molecules than the monomeric Sp140 protein or protein fragment alone (Fountoulakis et al., J. Biochem. 270:3958-3964 (1995)).

    <p num="81">Anti-Sp140 Antibodies</p>
    <p num="82">
      Epitope-bearing peptides and polypeptides of the invention are used to induce antibodies according to methods well known in the art, as generally described below (see, e.g., Sutcliffe, et al., supra; Wilson, et al., supra; and Bittle, F. J., et al., J. Gen. Virol. 66:2347-2354 (1985)).
      <br/>
      Animals may be immunized with free peptide; however, anti-peptide antibody titer may be boosted by coupling of the peptide to a macromolecular carrier, such as keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH) or tetanus toxoid.
      <br/>
      For instance, peptides containing cysteine may be coupled to carrier using a linker such as m-maleimidobenzoyl-N-hydroxysuccinimide ester (MBS), while other peptides may be coupled to carrier using a more general linking agent such as glutaraldehyde.
      <br/>
      Animals such as rabbits, rats and mice are immunized with either free or carrier-coupled peptides, for instance, by intraperitoneal and/or intradermal injection of emulsions containing about 100  MU g peptide or carrier protein and Freund's adjuvant.
      <br/>
      Several booster injections may be needed, for instance, at intervals of about two weeks, to provide a useful titer of anti-peptide antibody which can be detected, for example, by ELISA assay using free peptide adsorbed to a solid surface.
      <br/>
      The titer of anti-peptide antibodies in serum from an immunized animal may be increased by selection of anti-peptide antibodies, for instance, by adsorption to the peptide on a solid support and elution of the selected antibodies according to methods well known in the art.
    </p>
    <p num="83">Sp140 protein-specific antibodies can be raised against the intact Sp140 protein or an antigenic polypeptide fragment thereof, which may presented together with a carrier protein, such as an albumin, to an animal system (such as rabbit, rat or mouse) or, if it is long enough (at least about 25 amino acids), without a carrier.</p>
    <p num="84">
      As used herein, the term "antibody" (Ab) or "monoclonal antibody" (Mab) is meant to include intact molecules as well as antibody fragments (such as, for example, Fab and F(ab')2 fragments) which are capable of specifically binding to �protein name� protein.
      <br/>
      Fab and F(ab')2 fragments lack the Fc fragment of intact antibody, clear more rapidly from the circulation, and may have less non-specific tissue binding of an intact antibody (Wahl et al., J. Nucl. Med. 24:316-325 (1983)).
      <br/>
      Thus, these fragments are preferred.
    </p>
    <p num="85">
      The antibodies of the present invention may be prepared by any of a variety of methods.
      <br/>
      For example, cells expressing the Sp140 protein or an antigenic fragment thereof can be administered to an animal in order to induce the production of sera containing polyclonal antibodies, according to routine immunological methods.
      <br/>
      In a preferred method, a preparation of Sp140 protein is prepared and purified to render it substantially free of natural contaminants.
      <br/>
      Such a preparation is then introduced into an animal in order to produce polyclonal antisera of greater specific activity.
    </p>
    <p num="86">
      In the most preferred method, the antibodies of the present invention are monoclonal antibodies (or Sp140 protein-binding fragments thereof).
      <br/>
      Such monoclonal antibodies can be prepared using hybridoma technology Kohler et al., Nature 256:495 (1975); Kohler et al., Eur. J. Immunol. 6:511 (1976); Kohler et al., Eur. J. Immunol. 6:292 (1976); Hammerling et al., In: Monoclonal Antibodies and T-Cell Hybridomas, Elsevier, N.Y., pp. 563-681 (1981)).
      <br/>
      In general, such procedures involve immunizing an animal (preferably a mouse) with a Sp140 protein antigen or with a Sp140 protein-expressing cell.
      <br/>
      Suitable cells can be recognized by their capacity to bind anti-Sp140 protein antibody.
      <br/>
      Such cells may be cultured in any suitable tissue culture medium; however, it is preferable to culture cells in Earle's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (inactivated at about 56 (degree)  C.), and supplemented with about 10 g/l of nonessential amino acids, about 1,000 U/ml of penicillin, and about 100  MU g/ml of streptomycin.
      <br/>
      The splenocytes of such mice are extracted and fused with a suitable myeloma cell line.
      <br/>
      Any suitable myeloma cell line may be employed in accordance with the present invention; however, it is preferable to employ the parent myeloma cell line (SP2 O), available from the American Type Culture Collection, Rockville, Md.
      <br/>
      After fusion, the resulting hybridoma cells are selectively maintained in HAT medium, and then cloned by limiting dilution as described by Wands et al. (Gastroenterol. 80:225-232 (1981)).
      <br/>
      The hybridoma cells obtained through such a selection are then assayed to identify clones which secrete antibodies capable of binding the Sp140 protein antigen.
    </p>
    <p num="87">
      Alternatively, additional antibodies capable of binding to the Sp140 protein antigen may be produced in a two-step procedure through the use of anti-idiotypic antibodies.
      <br/>
      Such a method makes use of the fact that antibodies are themselves antigens, and that, therefore, it is possible to obtain an antibody which binds to a second antibody.
      <br/>
      In accordance with this method, Sp140 protein-specific antibodies are used to immunize an animal, preferably a mouse.
      <br/>
      The splenocytes of such an animal are then used to produce hybridoma cells, and the hybridoma cells are screened to identify clones which produce an antibody whose ability to bind to the Sp140 protein-specific antibody can be blocked by the Sp140 protein antigen.
      <br/>
      Such antibodies comprise anti-idiotypic antibodies to the Sp140 protein-specific antibody and can be used to immunize an animal to induce formation of further Sp140 protein-specific antibodies.

      It will be appreciated that Fab and F(ab')2 and other fragments of the antibodies of the present invention may be used according to the methods disclosed herein.

      Such fragments are typically produced by proteolytic cleavage, using enzymes such as papain (to produce Fab fragments) or pepsin (to produce F(ab')2 fragments).
      <br/>
      Alternatively, Sp140 protein-binding antibody fragments can be produced through the application of recombinant DNA technology or through synthetic chemistry.

      Where in vivo imaging is used to detect enhanced levels of Sp140 protein for disease diagnosis in humans (see below), it may be preferable to use "humanized" chimeric monoclonal antibodies.

      <br/>
      Methods for producing chimeric antibodies are known in the art (Morrison, Science 229:1202 (1985); Oi et al., BioTechniques 4:214 (1986); U.S. Pat.

    <p num="90">For use, the Sp140 protein-specific antibodies may be detectably labeled by covalent or non-covalent attachment of a chromogenic, enzymatic, radioisotopic, isotopic, fluorescent, toxic, chemiluminescent, nuclear magnetic resonance contrast agent or other label.</p>

      It will be appreciated by one of ordinary skill that the Sp140 protein-specific antibodies described herein may alternatively be coupled to a solid support, to facilitate, for example, chromatographic and other immunological procedures using such solid phase-immobilized antibodies.
      <br/>
      By "solid support" is intended any solid support to which an antibody can be immobilized.

    <p num="101">Autoimmune diseases</p>
    <p num="102">
      It is believed that mammals with certain autoimmune diseases express significantly enhanced levels of circulating antibodies directed against Sp140 protein when compared to a corresponding "standard" mammal, i.e., a mammal of the same species not having the autoimmune disease.
      <br/>
      Thus, the invention provides a diagnostic method useful in autoimmune disease diagnosis, which involves assaying the level of circulating anti-Sp140 antibodies in mammalian cells or body fluid and comparing these antibody levels with a standard anti-Sp140 antibody level, whereby a change (either an increase or a decrease) in the level of circulating anti-Sp140 antibodies over the standard is indicative of certain autoimmune diseases.
    </p>
    <p num="103">
      Where a diagnosis of an autoimmune disease has already been made according to conventional methods, the present invention is useful as a prognostic indicator, whereby patients exhibiting increased or decreased levels of circulating anti-Sp140 antibodies will experience a more favorable clinical outcome relative to patients with lower levels of circulating anti-Sp140 antibodies.
      <br/>
      For example, increased anti-Sp140 antibody levels are associated with the mild form of the autoimmune disease primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC), and patients with this form have a more favorable prognosis that patients with PBC who have lower levels of anti-Sp140 antibodies.
    </p>
    <p num="104">By "assaying the levels of circulating anti-Sp140 antibodies" is intended qualitatively or quantitatively measuring or estimating the levels of anti-Sp140 antibodies in a first biological sample either directly (e.g., by determining or estimating absolute anti-Sp140 antibody concentrations or titers) or relatively (e.g., by comparing the anti-Sp140 antibody levels in a first biological sample to those in a second biological sample).</p>
    <p num="105">
      Preferably, the level of anti-Sp140 antibodies in the first biological sample is measured or estimated and compared to that in a standard taken from a second biological sample obtained from an individual not having the autoimmune disease.

      Preferred for assaying anti-Sp140 antibody levels in a biological sample are immunological techniques.
      <br/>
      For example, anti-Sp140 antibody levels can be studied with classical methods such as enzyme-linked immunoadsorbent assay (ELISA), radioimmunoassay (RIA), western blot, dot/slot blot, or other similar methods employing Sp140 polypeptides or epitope-bearing fragments thereof immobilized on a solid support as described above.
      <br/>
      In this scenario, Sp140 polypeptides or epitope-bearing fragments thereof made according to the present invention are coupled to a solid support and contacted with a first biological sample to be tested for the presence of anti-Sp140 antibodies, under conditions favoring the formation of an antigen-antibody complex between the immobilized Sp140 (or fragments thereof) and anti-Sp140 antibodies.
      <br/>
      After allowing formation of the complex the anti-Sp140 antibodies that are bound to the immobilized Sp140 (if any) are detected using a second antibody directed against the anti-Sp140 antibody.
      <br/>
      The identity of this second antibody will depend upon the identity of the mammal from which the biological sample to be tested is derived; for example, if it is a human serum sample, the second antibody will be an anti-human antibody.

      As an alternative approach, a "sandwich" technique may be employed.

      These immobilized components can then be contacted with an isolated Sp140 polypeptide (or epitope-bearing fragments thereof) under conditions favoring the formation of a complex between the immobilized components and the Sp140 polypeptide.

      In both methods, the specific recognition is provided by the primary anti-Sp140 antibody but the secondary detection system can utilize fluorescent, enzyme, or other conjugated secondary antibodies.
      <br/>
      Suitable enzyme labels include, for example, those from the oxidase group, which catalyze the production of hydrogen peroxide by reacting with substrate.
      <br/>
      Glucose oxidase is particularly preferred as it has good stability and its substrate (glucose) is readily available.
      <br/>
      Activity of an oxidase label may be assayed by measuring the concentration of hydrogen peroxide formed by the enzyme-labeled antibody/substrate reaction.
      <br/>
      Besides enzymes, other suitable labels include radioisotopes, such as iodine (125 I, 121 I), carbon (14 C), sulphur (35 S), tritium (3 H), indium (112 In), and technetium (99m Tc), and fluorescent labels, such as fluorescein and rhodamine, and biotin.

      Viral Diseases and Neoplasia.
      <br/>
      It is believed that certain tissues in mammals with certain viral diseases and cancers express significantly decreased levels of the Sp140 protein and mRNA encoding the Sp140 protein when compared to a corresponding "standard" mammal, i.e., a mammal of the same species not having the viral disease or cancer.
      <br/>
      Further, it is believed that decreased levels of the Sp140 protein can be detected in certain body fluids (e.g., sera, plasma, urine, and spinal fluid) from mammals with cancer when compared to sera from mammals of the same species not having the viral disease or cancer.
      <br/>
      Thus, the invention provides a diagnostic method useful during viral disease or cancer diagnosis, which involves assaying the expression level of the gene encoding the Sp140 protein in mammalian cells or body fluid and comparing the gene expression level with a standard Sp140 gene expression level, whereby a decrease in the gene expression level over the standard is indicative of certain tumors or viral diseases.
    </p>
    <p num="112">Where a diagnosis has already been made according to conventional methods, the present invention is useful as a prognostic indicator, whereby patients exhibiting decreased Sp140 gene expression will experience a worse clinical outcome relative to patients expressing the gene at a higher level.</p>
    <p num="113">By "assaying the expression level of the gene encoding the Sp140 protein" is intended qualitatively or quantitatively measuring or estimating the level of the Sp140 protein or the level of the mRNA encoding the Sp140 protein in a first biological sample either directly (e.g., by determining or estimating absolute protein level or mRNA level) or relatively (e.g., by comparing to the Sp140 protein level or mRNA level in a second biological sample).</p>
    <p num="114">
      Preferably, the Sp140 protein level or mRNA level in the first biological sample is measured or estimated and compared to a standard Sp140 protein level or mRNA level, the standard being taken from a second biological sample obtained from an individual not having the viral disease or cancer.
      <br/>
      As will be appreciated in the art, once a standard Sp140 protein level or mRNA level is known, it can be used repeatedly as a standard for comparison.
    </p>
    <p num="115">
      Biological samples assayable according to these methods include mammalian body fluids (such as sera, plasma, urine, synovial fluid and spinal fluid) which may contain secreted Sp140 protein, and leukocyte, ovarian, prostate, heart, placenta, pancreas, liver, spleen, lung, breast and umbilical tissue which contain Sp140 protein as a component of the NB of the cells which form the tissues.
      <br/>
      Methods for obtaining tissue biopsies and body fluids from mammals are well known in the art.

      Where the biological sample is to include mRNA, a tissue biopsy is the preferred source.

      The present invention is useful for detecting viral diseases and cancer in mammals.

      Biochem. 162:156-159 (1987).
      <br/>
      Levels of mRNA encoding the Sp140 protein are then assayed using any appropriate method.
      <br/>
      These include Northern blot analysis, S1 nuclease mapping, the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), reverse transcription in combination with the polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and reverse transcription in combination with the ligase chain reaction (RT-LCR).

    <p num="118">
      Northern blot analysis can be performed as described in Harada et al., Cell 63:303-312 (1990).
      <br/>
      Briefly, total RNA is prepared from a biological sample as described above.
      <br/>
      For the Northern blot, the RNA is denatured in an appropriate buffer (such as glyoxal/dimethyl sulfoxide/sodium phosphate buffer), subjected to agarose gel electrophoresis, and transferred onto a nitrocellulose filter.
      <br/>
      After the RNAs have been linked to the filter by a UV linker, the filter is prehybridized in a solution containing formamide, SSC, Denhardt's solution, denatured salmon sperm, SDS, and sodium phosphate buffer.

      Sp140 protein-encoding cDNA labeled according to any appropriate method (such as the 32 P-multiprimed DNA labeling system (Amersham)) is used as probe.
      <br/>
      After hybridization overnight, the filter is washed and exposed to x-ray film. cDNA for use as probe according to the present invention is described in the sections above and will preferably at least 15 bp in length.

      To prepare probe DNA for use in S1 mapping, the sense strand of above-described cDNA is used as a template to synthesize labeled antisense DNA.
      <br/>
      The antisense DNA can then be digested using an appropriate restriction endonuclease to generate further DNA probes of a desired length.
      <br/>
      Such antisense probes are useful for visualizing protected bands corresponding to the target mRNA (i.e., mRNA encoding the Sp140 protein).
      <br/>
      Northern blot analysis can be performed as described above.
    </p>
    <p num="120">
      Preferably, levels of mRNA encoding the Sp140 protein are assayed using the RT-PCR method described in Makino et al., Technique 2:295-301 (1990).
      <br/>
      By this method, the radioactivities of the "amplicons" in the polyacrylamide gel bands are linearly related to the initial concentration of the target mRNA.
      <br/>
      Briefly, this method involves adding total RNA isolated from a biological sample in a reaction mixture containing a RT primer and appropriate buffer.
      <br/>
      After incubating for primer annealing, the mixture can be supplemented with a RT buffer, dNTPs, DTT, RNase inhibitor and reverse transcriptase.
      <br/>
      After incubation to achieve reverse transcription of the RNA, the RT products are then subject to PCR using labeled primers.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, rather than labeling the primers, a labeled dNTP can be included in the PCR reaction mixture.
      <br/>
      PCR amplification can be performed in a DNA thermal cycler according to conventional techniques.
      <br/>
      After a suitable number of rounds to achieve amplification, the PCR reaction mixture is electrophoresed on a polyacrylamide gel.

      Assaying Sp140 protein levels in a biological sample can occur using any art-known method.
      <br/>
      Preferred for assaying Sp140 protein levels in a biological sample are antibody-based techniques.
      <br/>
      For example, Sp140 protein expression in tissues can be studied with classical immunohistological methods.
      <br/>
      In these, the specific recognition is provided by the primary antibody (polyclonal or monoclonal) but the secondary detection system can utilize fluorescent, enzyme, or other conjugated secondary antibodies.
      <br/>
      As a result, an immunohistological staining of tissue section for pathological examination is obtained.
      <br/>
      Tissues can also be extracted, e.g., with urea and neutral detergent, for the liberation of Sp140 protein for Western-blot or dot/slot assay (Jalkanen, M., et al., J. Cell. Biol. 101:976-985 (1985); Jalkanen, M., et al., J. Cell. Biol. 105:3087-3096 (1987)).
      <br/>
      In this technique, which is based on the use of cationic solid phases, quantitation of Sp140 protein can be accomplished using isolated Sp140 protein or fragments thereof obtained according to the present invention as a standard.
      <br/>
      This technique can also be applied to body fluids.
      <br/>
      With these samples, a molar concentration of Sp140 protein will aid to set standard values of Sp140 protein content for different body fluids, like serum, plasma, urine, spinal fluid, etc.
      <br/>
      The normal appearance of Sp140 protein amounts can then be set using values from healthy individuals, which can be compared to those obtained from a test subject.
    </p>
    <p num="123">
      Other antibody-based methods useful for detecting Sp140 protein gene expression include immunoassays, such as ELISA and RIA as described above.
      <br/>
      For example, a Sp140 protein-specific monoclonal antibody obtained by the methods of the present invention can be used both as an immunoadsorbent and as an enzyme-labeled probe to detect and quantify the Sp140 protein.
      <br/>
      The amount of Sp140 protein present in the sample can be calculated by reference to the amount present in a standard preparation using a linear regression computer algorithm.
      <br/>
      Such an ELISA for detecting a tumor antigen is described in Iacobelli et al., Breast Cancer Research and Treatment 11:19-30 (1988).
      <br/>
      In another ELISA assay, two distinct specific monoclonal antibodies can be used to detect Sp140 protein in a body fluid, in a modification of the "sandwich" assay described above.
      <br/>
      In this assay, one of the antibodies is used as the immunoadsorbent and the other as the enzyme-labeled probe.
    </p>
    <p num="124">
      The above techniques may be conducted essentially as a "one-step" or "two-step" assay.
      <br/>
      The "one-step" assay involves contacting Sp140 protein with immobilized antibody and, without washing, contacting the mixture with the labeled antibody.
      <br/>
      The "two-step" assay involves washing before contacting the mixture with the labeled antibody.
      <br/>
      Other conventional methods may also be employed as suitable.
      <br/>
      It is usually desirable to immobilize one component of the assay system on a support, thereby allowing other components of the system to be brought into contact with the component and readily removed from the sample.
    </p>
    <p num="125">
      In addition to assaying Sp140 protein levels in a biological sample obtained from an individual, Sp140 protein can also be detected in vivo by imaging.
      <br/>
      Antibody labels or markers for in vivo imaging of Sp140 protein include those detectable by X-radiography, NMR or ESR.
      <br/>
      For X-radiography, suitable labels include radioisotopes such as barium or cesium, which emit detectable radiation but are not overtly harmful to the subject.
      <br/>
      Suitable markers for NMR and ESR include those with a detectable characteristic spin, such as deuterium, which may be incorporated into the antibody by labeling of nutrients for the relevant hybridoma.
    </p>
    <p num="126">
      A Sp140 protein-specific antibody or antibody fragment, such as that provided by the present invention, which has been labeled with an appropriate detectable imaging moiety, such as a radioisotope (for example, 131 I, 112 In, 99m Tc), a radio-opaque substance, or a material detectable by nuclear magnetic resonance, is introduced (for example, parenterally, subcutaneously or intraperitoneally) into the mammal to be examined for cancer or viral disease.
      <br/>
      It will be understood in the art that the size of the subject and the imaging system used will determine the quantity of imaging moiety needed to produce diagnostic images.
      <br/>
      In the case of a radioisotope moiety, for a human subject, the quantity of radioactivity injected will normally range from about 5 to 20 millicuries of 99m Tc.
      <br/>
      The labeled antibody or antibody fragment will then preferentially accumulate at the location of cells which contain Sp140 protein.
      <br/>
      In vivo tumor imaging is described in S. W. Burchiel et al., "Immunopharmacokinetics of Radiolabelled Antibodies and Their Fragments" (Chapter 13 in Tumor Imaging: The Radiochemical Detection of Cancer, S. W. Burchiel and B. A. Rhodes, eds., Masson Publishing Inc. (1982)).

      Among approximately one million bacteriophages, one clone (Sp140.1) producing immunoreactive recombinant protein was identified.

      To identify a full-length cDNA, the DNA fragment was radiolabelled and used to rescreen the HEpG2 cDNA library; no additional clones were identified.

      The radiolabelled fragment was then used to screen a HUVEC cDNA library and a single hybridizing cDNA (Sp140.2) was identified among one million bacteriophages.
      <br/>
      The clone contained a 2,732-bp insert that included the entire length of Sp140.1. A 2,193-nucleotide ORF extended to the 5' end of Sp140.2, suggesting that this clone also encoded only part of the full-length protein.

      <br/>
      The start codon is preceded by an in-frame stop codon.
      <br/>
      In preliminary analyses, several features of the predicted amino acid sequence of Sp140 (SEQ ID NO:2) were of interest.
      <br/>
      First, as shown in FIG. 2B, the amino terminal portion of Sp140 between amino acids 29-157 (SEQ ID NO:3) is 49% identical to the amino terminal region of Sp100 (SEQ ID NO:4), a previously identified autoantigen within the NB.
      <br/>
      In addition, the region in Sp140 between amino acids 228-317 is strongly negatively charged, in that 29 of the 92 amino acids in this region are either glutamic or aspartic acid.
      <br/>
      The central portion of Sp140, between amino acids 381-400, contains a potential bi-partite nuclear localization sequence (Silver, P. A., Cell 64:489-497 (1991); Dingwall, C., and Laskey, R. A., TIBS 16:478-481 (1991); Robbins, J. et al., Cell 64:615-623 (1991)).
      <br/>
      The carboxyl portion of Sp140 contains a cysteine-rich, zinc finger motif (amino acids 579-639), followed by a segment (amino acids 681-715; SEQ ID NO:5) that is similar to the bromodomain in Saccharomyces cerevisiae protein BDF1 (SEQ ID NO:6) (FIG. 2C) (Tamkun, J.

      <br/>
      Although the region of Sp140 used to immunize rats contained a short segment that was similar to Sp100 (9 of 27 amino acids identical), the rat antiserum did not react with Sp100 by immunoblot.

      Cloning and characterization of Sp140.
      <br/>
      Patients with the autoimmune disease primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) produce antibodies directed against components of a cellular organelle known as the nuclear body (NB).
      <br/>
      Three proteins in the NB--Sp100, NDP52 and PML--have previously been shown to be targets of autoantibodies.
      <br/>
      In the present invention, serum from a patient with PBC was used to identify a novel NB antigen which was designated Sp140 (SEQ ID NOs: 1, 2).
      <br/>
      The amino terminal portion of Sp140 (SEQ ID NO:3) is 49% identical to the amino terminal region of Sp100 (SEQ ID NO:4).
      <br/>
      These portions of Sp100 and Sp140 contain potential coiled coil motifs (data not shown).
      <br/>
      It has been hypothesized that the amino terminal domain of Sp100 may be a likely region for interactions between Sp100 and "other PBC autoantigens" (Koken, M. H. M. et al., EMBO J. 13:1073-1083 (1994)).
      <br/>
      A direct interaction between Sp100 and Sp140, however, has not yet been demonstrated.
    </p>
    <p num="168">
      The region in Sp140 between amino acids 579-619 contains a cysteine-rich, zinc finger motif.
      <br/>
      The presence of a zinc finger domain in Sp140 suggests that the protein is a member of a larger family of proteins that have been implicated in the control of development, cellular differentiation and cell growth.
      <br/>
      The zinc finger region may bind DNA directly or may interact with a second protein to form a dimer that binds DNA (Schleif, R., Science 241:1182-1187 (1988); Struhl, K., TIBS 14:137-140 (1989); Freemont, P. S., Ann. NY Acad. Sci. 684:174-12 (1993)).
      <br/>
      The order of the cysteine/histidine residues in Sp140 (C4HC3) differs slightly from that of the previously described RING finger (C3HC4) and LIM motifs (C2HC5).
      <br/>
      Koken et al. have observed that the C4HC3 motif is present in a variety of proteins including Drosophila trithorax and its human homologue ALL-1 and have proposed the name TTC (for trithorax consensus) for this family of proteins (Koken, M. H. M. et al., Comptes Rend.

      The portion of Sp140 between amino acids 681-715 (SEQ ID NO:5) contains a bromodomain.

      Bromodomains are conserved sequences that are found in a variety of transcriptional regulatory proteins (Tamkun, J. W. et al., Cell 68:561-572 (1992); Haynes, S. R. et al., Nucl. Acids Res. 20:2603 (1992); Lygerou, Z. et al., Nucleic Acids Res. 22:5332-5340 (1994)).
      <br/>
      The predicted secondary structure of the bromodomain includes two strongly amphipathic  ALPHA  helices followed by reverse turns.
      <br/>
      Although the functional significance of the bromodomain is unknown, the hydrophobic surfaces of the  ALPHA  helices may serve as sites of intramolecular protein-protein interaction.
      <br/>
      These interactions may influence the assembly or activity of multicomponent complexes involved in transcriptional activation (Carlson, M., and Laurent, B. C., Curr. Opin. Cell. Biol. 6:396-402 (1994)).

      <br/>
      Its predominant expression in human leukocytes suggests that Sp140 may have an important role in cellular functions that are unique to these cells.
      <br/>
      Low levels of Sp140 mRNA were detected in the myeloid precursor cell lines HL60 and NB4, while the expression of Sp140 was markedly increased during the course of differentiation of HL60 cells toward either monocytes or polymorphonuclear leukocytes and expression of Sp140 in NB4 cells was markedly increased following treatment with RA which induces a polymorphonuclear leukocyte morphology.

      Sp140 and acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL).
      <br/>
      In APL, a translocation between chromosomes 15 and 17 results in fusion of the NB protein PML to RAR ALPHA .
      <br/>
      Expression of the fusion protein disrupts the NB and inhibits normal myeloid maturation.
      <br/>
      Treatment of APL cells with RA results in reformation of the NB and induces leukemic cell maturation (Dyck, J. A. et al., Cell 76:333-343 (1994); de The, H. et al., Nature (London) 347:558-561 (1990); Borrow, J. et al., Science 249:1577-1580(1990); Longo, L. et al., J. Exp.

      <br/>
      The mechanism of action of RA in these cells is unknown.
      <br/>
      The myeloid precursor cell line NB4 contains the t(15; 17) translocation associated with APL (Lanotte, M. et al., Blood 77:1080-1086 (1991)).
      <br/>
      Using immunohistochemistry, Sp140 was not detected in untreated NB4 cells (FIG. 7, panel G).
      <br/>
      This was not surprising in view of the low level of Sp140 mRNA in these cells (FIG. 4).
      <br/>
      However, following treatment of NB4 cells with RA, Sp140 was detected within the NBs of these cells (FIG. 7, panel E).
      <br/>
      Taken together, the observations that expression of Sp140 in NB4 cells is induced by RA treatment and that Sp140 associates with the NB suggest that Sp140 may have a role in the action of RA on APL cells.
      <br/>
      The observed resistance of APL cells to RA that develops over time (Ruchaud, S. et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. (USA) 91:8428-8432 (1994); Warrell, R. P., Blood 82:1949-1953 (1993)) may, in part, be a result of a second event in these cells that alters the structure or function of a protein (possibly Sp140) that interacts with PML in the NB.

      IFN treatment increases the expression of each of the previously identified components of the NB (Sp100, PML and NDP52).

      This IFN induction of NB-associated proteins may have functional significance.

Immunol. 149:4067-4073 (1992)), and it has recently been demonstrated that overexpression of PML in Hep2 cells dramatically decreases the ability of these cells to support adenoviral replication (Doucas, V. et al., Genes &amp; Devel. 10:196-207 (1996)).
      <br/>
      Based on these results, it has been hypothesized that increased expression of PML may delay or block Sp100 and NDP52 recruitment to viral replication domains resulting in inhibition of viral DNA replication (Doucas, V. et al., Genes &amp; Devel. 10:196-207 (1996)).
      <br/>
      The identification in the present invention of Sp140, a novel NB component that is expressed in cells involved in host defense, raises the possibility that Sp140, like other NB components, may have a role in the pathogenesis of, or the host response to, viral infection.

    <p num="174">
      In summary, a novel component of the NB has been identified and characterized.
      <br/>
      The predicted amino acid sequence of Sp140 suggests that this protein is involved in the regulation of gene transcription.
      <br/>
      The predominant expression of Sp140 in leukocytes indicates that this protein has an important role in cellular functions that are unique to these cells.
