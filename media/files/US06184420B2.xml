    <p num="1">The present invention relates to the preparation of  GAMMA , DELTA -monounsaturated or  BETA , GAMMA , DELTA -diunsaturated ketones which are useful fragrances or useful intermediates for the synthesis of natural substances, by the combination of conventional reactions of allyl alcohols or propargyl alcohols with isopropenyl ethers with the formation of ketals of acetone as a byproduct, the isopropenyl ethers being prepared by reacting ketals of acetone with propyne or allene in the gas phase over heterogeneous catalysts and the ketal of acetone, obtained as byproduct, being fed into the stated preparation of the isopropenyl ether.</p>

      DE 1 193 490 and R. Marbet and G. Saucy, Helv.
      <br/>
      Chim. Acta 50, (1967), 2091-2095 and 2095-2100 disclose a process for the preparation of  GAMMA , DELTA -unsaturated ketones by reacting an allyl alcohol with enol ethers, in particular isopropenyl ethers, in the presence of an acid catalyst, e.g. phosphoric acid.
    </p>
    <p num="3">
      Furthermore, U.S. Pat. No. 3,029,287 and G. Saucy and R. Marbet, Helv.
      <br/>
      Chim. Acta 50, (1967) 1158-1167 disclose the reaction of the propargyl alcohols with enol ethers in the presence of acid catalysts to give  BETA , GAMMA , DELTA -diunsaturated ketones.
    </p>
    <p num="4">In both reactions, one mole of the corresponding ketal is formed as a byproduct from 2 moles of enol ether used, for example acetone dimethyl ketal from isopropenyl methyl ether used, in accordance with the following equations:  (Chemical Structure image '5' not included in text)   (Chemical Structure image '6' not included in text)</p>
    <p num="5">In these equations, R1 to R5 are each hydrogen or alkyl, alkenyl, cycloalkyl, cycloalkenyl, aryl or aralkyl radicals which are unsubstituted or substituted by oxygen-containing groups, it also being possible for R1 and R2, together with the carbon atom to which they are bonded, to form a 5- or 6-membered ring, and R6 is alkyl of 1 to 4 carbon atoms.</p>
    <p num="6">
      The ketal IV obtained as a byproduct must be converted back into the enol ether III for economic reasons.
      <br/>
      It is known that this can be done by converting the ketals, either in the liquid phase with acidic catalysts (according to EP 703 211) or in the gas phase over heterogeneous catalysts (according to DE 19 544 450) with elimination of alcohol, into the corresponding enol ethers according to the following equation:  (Chemical Structure image '7' not included in text)
    </p>
    <p num="7">Here, R is hydrogen or alkyl and R6 has the abovementioned meaning.</p>
    <p num="8">The stated known processes permit the preparation of the enol ethers in good yields in some cases but have the following disadvantages:</p>
    <p num="9">
      The reaction in the liquid phase according to EP 703 211 requires the use of a dissolved foreign substance, ie. an organic acid, the removal of which from the reaction mixture requires an additional separation step.
      <br/>
      Compared with the process in the liquid phase using a homogeneously dissolved catalyst, the process according to DE 19544450 has the advantage of the reaction in the gas phase over a heterogeneous catalyst that requires fairly high temperatures.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      Common to both processes is that one mole of alcohol is separated per mole of ketal and has to be separated off in an additional purification step, at considerable expense in some cases, and as a rule has to be discarded.
      <br/>
      This applies in particular to methanol, which frequently forms azeotropic mixtures.
      <br/>
      The weight yield, based on the ketal, is thus inevitably reduced.
    </p>
    <p num="11">It is an object of the present invention to provide a combination process which on the one hand permits the preparation of the required enol ether III over a heterogeneous catalyst in good yields without the alcohol originating from the ketal being obtained as a byproduct in stoichiometric amount and, on the other hand, recycling of the ketal obtained in the reactions of equations 1 and 2 into the preparation of the enol ethers.</p>
    <p num="12">We have found that this object is achieved, according to the invention, by a process for the preparation of unsaturated ketones of the formulae Ia and Ib  (Chemical Structure image '8' not included in text)</p>
    <p num="13">where R1, R2, R3, R4 and R5 are each hydrogen or alkyl, alkenyl, cycloalkyl, cycloalkenyl, aryl or aralkyl radicals which are substituted or unsubstituted by oxygen-containing groups, it also being possible for R1 and R2 together to form a 5- or 6-membered ring, which comprises the combination of the following reactions:</p>

      b) preparation of the isopropenyl ether of the formula III by reacting a ketal of the formula IV with propyne or allene, or a mixture thereof in the gas phase at elevated temperatures in the presence of a heterogeneous catalyst containing zinc or cadmium together with silicon or oxygen, and
      <br/>
      c) feeding the ketal of the formula iv formed in the reaction (a) into stage (b) for the preparation of the isopropenyl ether of the formula III again.

      The conditions in stage (a) are described in DE 1193490 or U.S. Pat. No. 3,029 287 or the stated publications in Helv.

      Chim. Acta. In this context, the information in these patent publications and literature publications are hereby expressly incorporated by reference.
    </p>
    <p num="20">The conditions in stage (a) are in general not critical for carrying out the novel combination process and can of course also be varied, for example by the choice of the catalyst and, if required, of the starting materials.</p>
    <p num="21">Accordingly, more recent improvements of the reaction in stage (a) are of course also suitable, as described, for example, in DE 19 649 564.4.</p>
    <p num="22">Preferred starting materials of the formula IIa are in particular tertiary allyl alcohols, R1 preferably being a saturated or unsaturated, branched or straight-chain alkyl radical which is unsubstituted or substituted by oxygen-containing groups, e.g. methoxy or ethoxy groups, an aryl radical or an alkylaryl radical of up to 20 carbon atoms and R2 is preferably C1 -C4 -alkyl, in particular methyl, it also being possible for R1 and R2 together to be tetramethylene or pentamethylene which is unsubstituted or substituted by one or more lower alkyl groups, and R3, R4 and R5 are each hydrogen.</p>
    <p num="23">Specific examples are 3-methyl-1-buten-3-ol, 3,7-dimethyl-1-octen -3-ol (hydrolinalool), 3,7-dimethylocta-2,6-dien-3-ol (linalool), 1-vinylcyclohexanol, 3,7,11-trimethyl-dodeca-1,6,10-trien-3-ol (nerolidol), 3,7,11-trimethyl-dodeca-1,6-dien-3-ol (hydronerolidol) and 3,7,11-trimethyl-dodec-1-en-3-ol(tetrahydronerolidol) and isophytol.</p>
    <p num="24">Preferred propargyl alcohols are tertiary propargyl alcohols of the formula IIb where R1 is a saturated or unsaturated, branched or straight-chain alkyl radical which is unsubstituted or substituted by oxygen-containing groups, or an aryl radical or an alkylaryl radical, each of up to 20 carbon atoms, and R2 is C1 -C4 -alkyl, in particular methyl, it also being possible for R1 and R2 together to be tetramethylene or pentamethylene which is unsubstituted or substituted by one or more lower alkyl groups, and R4 is hydrogen.</p>
    <p num="25">Specific examples are 3-methylbutyn-3-ol, 3,7-dimethyl-l-octyn-3-ol(hydrodehydrolinalool), 3,7-dimethylocta-6-en-1-yn-3-ol(dehydrolinalool), 3,7,11-trimethyldodeca-6,10-dien-1-yn-3-ol(dehydronerolidol), 3,7,11-trimethyldodeca-6-en-1-yn-3-ol and 3,7,11-trimethyldodec-1-yn-3-ol.</p>

    <p num="30">with propyne and/or allene in the gas phase in the presence of a heterogeneous catalyst containing zinc or cadmium and silicon and oxygen.</p>
    <p num="31">Although the mechanism of this reaction is not known in detail, the reaction may be regarded formally as if one mole of an alcohol R6 OH is transferred from the dialkoxy compound of the formula IV to the acetylene or allene with formation of the enol ether of the formula III.</p>
    <p num="32">Examples of suitable ketals are the dimethyl, diethyl, di-n-propyl, di-n-butyl and diisobutyl ketals of acetone. 2,2-Dimethoxypropane (acetone dimethyl ketal) is particularly preferred as a starting material.</p>
    <p num="33">
      The ketals and their preparation from acetone are disclosed in the technical literature.
      <br/>

    <p num="49">
      The precatalyst can then be calcined at not more than 600 (degree)  C., in particular from 80 to 300 (degree)  C., in air or under an inert gas.

      Calcination at from 120 to 250 (degree)  C. in air is particularly preferred.

    <p num="50">
      After the preparation of the generally still catalytically inactive precatalyst by application of a zinc or cadmium compound to a silica carrier, forming is preferably carried out, in which the actual active phase is formed in particular on the surface of the catalyst.
      <br/>
      This solid-state reaction is promoted by the presence of water, alcohols, preferably lower alcohols, or carboxylic acids, preferably lower carboxylic acids, and is therefore advantageously carried out by heating the precatalyst at from 50 to 400 (degree)  C. in a water- or alcohol-containing atmosphere.
      <br/>
      The reaction is preferably carried out at from 100 to 250 (degree)  C. in a water- or methanol-containing gas mixture.

      The reaction is particularly preferably carried out at from 120 to 200 (degree)  C. with a methanol-containing gas mixture directly in the reactor in which the reaction with the alkyne or allene is subsequently to take place.
      <br/>
      If a precatalyst based on zinc acetate is used, it is very easy to determine when the solid-state reaction is complete as virtually no methyl acetate is to be found in the exit gas at this time.
      <br/>
      In some cases it has proven advantageous to treat the precatalyst under reaction conditions with a mixture of methanol with propyne and allene and possibly also other components (eg. propene or propane) for the formation of the active phase.
      <br/>
      Formation of the active layer is indicated by the increase in the propyne and allene conversion (after from about 5 to 30 minutes, depending on the temperature), by the increase in the selectivity (after from 10 to 300 minutes, depending on the temperature) and by the decline in the concentration of methyl acetate in the exit gas.
      <br/>
      A steady state (with high propyne or allene conversions) and a high selectivity is reached after from about 2 to 20 hours, depending on the temperature.

      Catalysts having BET surface areas of from 100 to 400 m2 /g are preferred.

      Furthermore, the samples were investigated in detail by means of powder X-ray diffractometry (XRD) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM).
      <br/>
      Neither of the two structure analysis methods reveals any long-range order in the sense of a crystalline structure; all samples were amorphous.
      <br/>
      The distribution of the zinc over the carrier was investigated on appropriate sections under the electron microscope and by means of a microprobe.
      <br/>
      All samples, even after removal from the reactor, show that the catalyst has a substantially homogeneous distribution of elements and contains little or no crystalline ZnO.
      <br/>
      In the IR investigation (KBr pellets), the active catalyst prepared with zinc acetate shows no acetate bands (these are still visible in the precatalyst at 1570, 1410, 670 and 610 cm-1).
      <br/>
      In the 13 C-CP-MAS-NMR, too, acetate signals are no longer present.
      <br/>
      In the 29 Si-CP-MAS-NMR, the catalyst shows only the broad band at -109 ppm which is typical of amorphous SiO2, and a shoulder at -99 ppm (about 10% of the intensity of the main peak).
      <br/>
      The elemental analysis of a zinc acetate/SiO2 precatalyst shows that the molar C/Zn ratio is dependent on the calcination temperature.
      <br/>
      Catalysts dried at room temperature have a C/Zn ratio of 3.5 -4. After calcination at 200-250 (degree)  C. (optimum temperature), the C/Zn ratio is from 1 to 2.
      <br/>
      At higher temperatures, the C/Zn ratio decreases even further, as does the catalytic activity of the catalysts formed therefrom.
      <br/>
      After calcination at 500 (degree)  C. (24 hours), the C/Zn ratio in the precatalyst is 0.02. Active catalyst cannot be formed from this.
      <br/>
      Since the decomposition of the zinc acetate on the precatalyst is relatively slow, said precatalyst can be exposed to even higher temperatures for short times without the catalytic activity being completely lost.

      Different zinc silicates form depending on the pH established.

      The product obtained contains predominantly hemimorphite but is contaminated with sauconite (Zn3 Si4 O10 O(OH)2 * 4 H2 O).

      The dried white powder was investigated by X-ray diffraction and gave an X-ray powder pattern which corresponded to that of FIG. 1 and thus indicated the preparation of predominant amounts of X-ray amorphous zinc silicate in addition to a small amount of crystalline ZnO (index card 5-0664 of the JCPDS-ICDD index (1995)).
      <br/>
