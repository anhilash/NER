      A system and method for optimizing logistical operations in land seismic surveys.
      <br/>
      The system and method for modeling and optimizing logistical operations problems in land seismic survey operations is implemented in a computer program running on a computer processor.
      <br/>
      A logistical problem is formulated with a set of decision variables and problem data and the problem is modeled as an objective function and a set of constraints, expressed in terms of the problem data and the decision variables.
      <br/>
      The objective function is solved subject to the constraints and an optimal solution is generated for the set of decision variables to optimize the logistical problem.
      <br/>
      Logistical problems that may be optimized using this approach include: minimization of total costs in the design and operations of a land seismic survey, routing of one or more source crews through a sequence of source location points, placement of recording stations in a survey, placement of source locations, source crew and vehicle routing, offsetting source locations from exclusion zones to avoid obstacles and determining the optimal amount of an expendable resource needed for the survey.

    <heading>BACKGROUND</heading>
    <p num="1">
      This invention relates generally to solving logistical operations problems in three dimensional (3D) land seismic surveys.
      <br/>
      More particularly, the invention is a method and system for optimizing seismic surveys by applying operations research methodologies to the land seismic surveying problem domain.
      <br/>
      Optimization problems in 3D land seismic surveying are formulated and solved using mathematical programming techniques.
      <br/>
      The invention introduces a number of optimization models and methods for improving logistical operations in 3D land seismic surveys.
      <br/>
      The present method and system models logistical problems by formulating the problem as a set of inequalities and then solving the set of inequalities using an optimization software program using mathematical programming techniques.

      Seismic surveying is a key technology area in geophysical prospecting.
      <br/>
      Seismic surveying is primarily concerned with reflection seismology.
      <br/>
      A source on the surface of the earth generates a signal which propagates through the earth.
      <br/>
      The underground geological structures attenuate, reflect, and refract the signal.
      <br/>
      Receiver equipment on the earth's surface monitors the reflected wave.
      <br/>
      Using this and other information, seismologists construct a picture of the earth's subsurface.
    </p>
    <p num="3">
      Over the years, increasingly sophisticated survey designs and data processing techniques have been developed.
      <br/>
      More sophisticated designs have led to more complex logistical operations in conducting seismic surveys.
      <br/>
      For example, until the early 1980's, most land seismic surveys were two dimensional (2D) surveys conducted along a single line of source and receiver points.
      <br/>
      Today, most surveys are three dimensional (3D) where source and receivers points are scattered on a plane and the arrangement of the source and receiver points is defined by the requirements of the survey.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      The requirements of seismic surveying can be subdivided into two categories: geophysical and logistical.
      <br/>
      A great deal of the formal research has focused on improving the geophysical aspect of seismic surveys.
      <br/>
      The geophysical aspect involves achieving the best possible signal to construct the best possible picture of the earth's subsurface.
      <br/>
      Many improvements have been made in seismic signal source generation and receiver detection technology.
      <br/>
      In seismic surveying, a signal is generated from a source point, follows along a ray path, and is reflected off an underground target level.
      <br/>
      The reflected path returns to a receiver point.
      <br/>
      The reflected signal provides information on the underground structure such as a subsurface layer.
      <br/>
      The point of reflection of the underground target between the source and receiver is called the common midpoint (CMP).
      <br/>
      In seismic surveying, several receivers are turned on to detect the signal sent out from a single source point.
      <br/>
      This permits the simultaneous sampling of several CMPS.
      <br/>
      If the process is repeated with several sources instead of one source, then the same CMPs get sampled several times.
      <br/>
      Sampling on the same point improves the signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) for the processing of the data and results in better signal strength, which gives a better picture of the earth's subsurface.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      Much less emphasis has been placed on logistical operations and on techniques for improving those operations.
      <br/>
      The logistical aspect relates to the handling of the details of the seismic surveying operation along with any other factors besides geophysical ones that affect survey results.
      <br/>
      Among the many factors that influence the logistics of a survey are size of the survey, design of the survey, the amount of equipment available, and the number of crews available.
      <br/>
      These factors are controllable.
      <br/>
      Other factors that affect the survey results such as weather, terrain and underground geology are not controllable.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      Operations on a land seismic survey involve the coordination of signal generation (shooting), placement of equipment to receive the reflected signal, and recording of the results.
      <br/>
      The logistics center of a survey is called base camp.
      <br/>
      Line crews place the equipment (channels) on the ground and use vehicles referred to as line trucks.
      <br/>
      The equipment consists of cables, receivers and boxes.
      <br/>
      Boxes collect data and perform analog to digital conversion and filtering of the data.
      <br/>
      The boxes are powered by batteries and solar panels.
      <br/>
      Source crews (sets of vibrators or dynamite shooting crews) progress through a preplanned sequence of source locations.
      <br/>
      An acquisition system, located in a recording platform, turns different receivers on and off so that the required set of receivers that monitors a single source (called a patch) is turned on for each source measurement.
      <br/>
      The acquisition system also records the results from each shot.
      <br/>
      Line crews move equipment in the direction of the progression of the survey.
      <br/>
      Typically, there is not enough equipment available to cover the entire survey area.
      <br/>
      Thus, equipment movement is required.
      <br/>
      Measurements from a single source point typically take less than one minute.
      <br/>
      Movement of receiving equipment from one patch to the next one in the shooting sequence can take several minutes.
      <br/>
      Therefore, extra equipment is used to cover several patches ahead of the current source location.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      Given the high cost of performing seismic surveys, optimizing the operational as well as the geophysical aspects of the surveys is increasingly important.
      <br/>
      Because of the number of geophysical and logistical factors that influence survey results, including customer requirements and the complexity of optimization due to those factors, there is a need to develop computer models for survey optimization.
      <br/>
      The computer model needs to optimize survey operation, for example, by conducting a survey at the lowest possible cost or generating the highest possible profit, while maintaining the geophysical survey requirements.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      One of the ways to formulate and solve optimization problems in 3D land seismic surveys is by using operational research mathematical programming techniques.
      <br/>
      Mathematical programming has been widely applied to solve operations problems in manufacturing, transportation and logistics, finance, and marketing where the parameters are quantifiable.
      <br/>
      Mathematical programming techniques can be used when a problem is formulated as: (i) a set of decision variables, (ii) a problem specification to be solved that is expressed as a function to be minimized or maximized (called objective function), and (iii) a set of constraints.
      <br/>
      Decision variables are quantities under the control of the decision maker.
      <br/>
      Examples of decision variables are factors such as size of the survey, the design of the survey, the amount of equipment available, and the number of crews available.
      <br/>
      It is these controllable factors that provide the decision maker with the opportunity to improve or even optimize survey design and operations.
      <br/>
      The constraints are the restrictions that bound the problem, for example, the maximum number of signals that can be generated in a day (called the number of shots).
      <br/>
      The problem specification is essentially a set of inequalities modeling the general logistical problem to be solved.
      <br/>
      Examples of problem specifications that can be modeled using sets of inequalities include: minimization of total costs in the design and operations of a land seismic survey; the optimal routing of one or more source crews through a sequence of source location points; the optimal placement of recording locations in a survey; and the optimal amount of an expendable resource to purchase prior to the survey so there is a sufficient amount of the resource available for the survey with a minimal amount remaining.
      <br/>
      These inequalities take into account the decision variables and constraints corresponding to the particular instance of the problem to be solved.
      <br/>
      Other quantities in the inequalities, called problem data or parameters, are not computed but are set to given values or a set of values.
      <br/>
      An example of problem data might be the surveying costs for every source and receiver point.
      <br/>
      After the problem is modeled as a set of inequalities, it is translated into a form suitable for solution by a solver using, for example, an algebraic modeling language.
      <br/>
      The solver then computes the values of the decision variables which optimize the objective function and satisfy the set of constraints.
      <br/>
      The values of the decision variables are computed such that the objective function is optimized and the set of constraints is satisfied.
      <br/>
      The result is an improved survey design and logistical operation.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      Models become harder to solve when the decision variables are integer, the objective function and/or the constraints are nonlinear, and the problem data are stochastically defined.
      <br/>
      For integer programming problems, the computational complexity of the solution grows exponentially with the number of integer variables.
      <br/>
      No algorithm can solve all nonlinear programming problems to optimality.
      <br/>
      The best any algorithm can do in the general case is to guarantee local optimality (such as guarantee the best solution over a local region of possibilities).
      <br/>
      In certain special cases when the objective function has a special shape or structure, leading for example to the property of convexity, global optimality (the best solution over all possibilities) can also be guaranteed.
      <br/>
      To eliminate uncertainty in the data, assumptions may need to be made but may result in solutions that are far from optimal.
      <br/>
      Stochastic programming techniques use the structure of the mathematical model to furnish exact solutions or simulation (Monte Carlo sampling) to bound the optimal solution.
      <br/>
      Given all these complicating factors, an optimal solution, or a solution within a specified tolerance of the best possible solution, or just a feasible solution, that is, one that satisfies the problem constraints is sought.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      Many types of commercial optimization software packages (also called solvers) exist to solve mathematical programming problems.
      <br/>
      Once the mathematical model has been formulated, it must be input to a solver.
      <br/>
      Spreadsheet packages incorporate solvers and can be used to solve small (generally less than 200 variables) 3D seismic surveying problems.
      <br/>
      For larger problems, algebraic modeling languages such as GAMS (Brooke et al. 1992) or AMPL (Fourer et al. 1993) may be required.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, a program can be written to directly call a commercially available solver library.

      Problems amenable to mathematical programming techniques abound in land seismic operations.
      <br/>
      Vehicle routing problem formulations used in transportation may be adapted to the vehicles used in moving the equipment and in the shooting operations.
      <br/>
      Models used in logistics for facility locations may be used to determine the location and moves of the base camp and trucks carrying the recording system.
      <br/>
      Other problems include crew shuttling to and from remote locations, line crew scheduling, battery replacement strategies in the data recording boxes, and the balancing of workloads between line crews, line trucks, and source crews.
      <br/>
      Ultimately optimization modeling may be used to design seismic survey strategies that differ from those specified by geophysical criteria alone.
      <br/>
      For example, a seismic survey design may be developed by incorporating all costs (including cost of operations) that would ensure a certain fold coverage, offset distribution, and azimuthal distribution.

    <heading>SUMMARY</heading>
    <p num="12">
      The method and system of the present invention optimizes 3D land seismic survey logistics by formulating and modeling the survey problem in terms of an objective function and a set of constraints.
      <br/>
      The model is essentially a set of inequalities for modeling the problem to be solved, including the decision variables that can be controlled by the user, problem data, and the geophysical and operational constraints.
      <br/>
      Once the objective function is specified, a commercial optimization program may be used to optimize the function by computing values of the decision variables such that the objective function is optimized and the set of constraints are satisfied.
      <br/>
      Typical logistical problems that may be solved include minimizing the acquisition costs in the design and operations of the survey, optimizing source crew routing at the survey site, optimal placement of recording station locations, and the optimal amount of an expendable resource to purchase for a survey.

      The present invention comprises a method for modeling and optimizing logistical operations problems in land seismic survey operations, in a computer program running on a computer processor, the method comprising formulating a logistical problem with a set of decision variables and problem data, modeling the problem as an objective function and a set of constraints expressed in terms of the problem data and the decision variables, solving the objective function and generating an optimal solution for the set of decision variables to optimize the logistical problem.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, the method may comprise identifying decision variables under the control of a user for a logistical problem, identifying a set of operational and geophysical constraints for the logistical problem, identifying variable optimization problem parameters, building a mathematical model of the logistical problem using the decision variables, constraints and problem parameters, the model being expressed as an objective function and a set of constraints expressed in terms of the decision variables and problem parameters, and generating an optimal logistical problem solution.
      <br/>
      The method may further comprise translating the mathematical model into a form suitable for solution by a solver software program and using the solver software program to solve for the decision variables which satisfy the problem constraints and optimize the objective function.
      <br/>
      The objective function and constraints may be expressed in an algebraic modeling language and solved using an optimization program that optimizes the objective function.
      <br/>
      The logistical problem may be a three dimensional (3D) seismic survey problem.

      <br/>
      The processing costs may be a function of the size of the survey.
      <br/>
      The constraints may further comprise the geophysical requirements of fold, offset and azimuth, the maximum number of shots per day, and the maximum number of channels.
    </p>
    <p num="16">
      In one embodiment, the logistical problem is routing a 3D seismic survey source crew through a plurality of nodes in a minimum period of time.
      <br/>
      Each node may represent a rack, which is a set of source locations on the same source line between two adjacent receiver lines.
      <br/>
      The method may further comprise identifying as decision variables the number of times the source crew passes from one node to another node, requiring the constraint that each node must be visited at least once, requiring the constraint that each node must be departed at least once, and requiring the number of visits and departures from a node to be equal.
      <br/>
      In addition, the method may further comprise routing a plurality of source crews through the plurality of nodes.
      <br/>
      The method may further comprise requiring the constraint that each rack must be visited at least once by one of the crews, requiring the constraint that each source crew starts at a base camp location and returns to the base camp location, and minimizing the total cost of routing the plurality of source crews by solving for an optimal number of crews while equalizing the time for each source crew to be away from the base camp location.
    </p>
    <p num="17">
      In an alternate embodiment, the logistical problem is placing a recording station within a field of receiver locations such that the number of times the recording station must be moved to cover the field of receiver locations is minimized.
      <br/>
      The method further comprises identifying the location of the recording station at each point in time as a decision variable and requiring the constraint that each receiver location must be listened to at least once.
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      The present invention also comprises a system for modeling and optimizing logistical operations problems in land seismic survey operations.
      <br/>
      The system comprises means for identifying decision variables under the control of a user for a logistical problem, means for identifying a set of operational and geophysical constraints for the logistical problem, means for quantifying variable optimization problem parameters, and means for building a mathematical model of the logistical problem.

      The model may be expressed as an objective function subject to a set of inequalities representing the constraints.

      The expendable item may be vehicle fuel.

      In another embodiment, the logistical problem is placing shot locations so as to minimize the cost of the seismic survey while satisfying the operational and geophysical survey constraints.
      <br/>
      The survey constraints may further comprise placing the shot locations to achieve a minimum fold coverage, placing the shot locations so the locations fall within a minimum and maximum offset, and placing the shot locations so the locations fall within a minimum and maximum azimuth.
      <br/>
      The problem parameters may further comprise the cost of locating the shot location at a potential shot point, a set of shot locations that fall into a bin, the number of shot locations in the bin that fall into a minimum and maximum offset, minimum and maximum fold coverage for the bin that fall into the minimum and maximum offset, a set of shot locations for the bin that fall into a minimum and maximum azimuth, and minimum and maximum fold coverage for the bin that fall into the minimum and maximum azimuth.

      The method may further comprise determining the sequence of shots and determining new locations for shots to avoid shot exclusion zones.
      <br/>
      The shot exclusion zones where shot locations are to be avoided are problem parameters that may be determined by a user.

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading>
    <p num="25">
      FIG. 1 shows a block diagram depicting the general process of solving a logistical operations problem by formulating a mathematical programming model.
      <br/>
      The problem to be solved is first identified 10.
      <br/>
      The problem data parameters 11, decision variables 12 and constraints 13 are also identified.
      <br/>
      The logistical problem is represented as a mathematical model in terms of decision variables and the problem parameters 14.
      <br/>
      The model is expressed as an objective function and a set of inequalities representing the constraints of the problem.
      <br/>
      The model is then translated into a form suitable for solution by a solver program, using for example, an algebraic modeling language.
      <br/>
      The objective function is then optimized subject to the constraints 15 by using a commercial optimization software solver package.
      <br/>
      An optimal problem solution 16, that is a set of optimal decisions, is obtained.
    </p>
    <p num="26">
      FIG. 2 shows a flowchart depicting a high level view of formulating a mathematical programming model for solving a 3D land seismic surveying logistical operations problem.
      <br/>
      In formulating a mathematical programming model, the first step is to identify the 3D seismic survey problem to be solved, and expressing it as a problem statement 20.
      <br/>
      Problem data or parameters, that is quantities that are not computed but set to given values or set of values, are determined 21.
      <br/>
      The decision variables, those quantities under the control of the user and that may be optimized, are identified 22.
      <br/>
      The objective function is identified 23 and the constraints, both geophysical and operational, are also identified 24.
      <br/>
      The problem is then modeled in the form of a mathematical program, expressed as an objective function and set of constraints.
      <br/>
      The set of constraints is represented by a set of inequalities 25.
      <br/>
      An optimizer or solver is then used to solve the model and generate an optimal solution for the objective function 26 which may be displayed to a user 27.
      <br/>
      During optimization, an attempt is made to compute the values of the decision variables such that the objective function is optimized and the set of constraints are satisfied.

    <p num="27">
      FIG. 3 shows a 3D orthogonal survey design 30 where sources and receivers are located on a plain over the earth's surface and form a grid pattern.
      <br/>
      The vertical lines in FIG. 3 contain source locations 31 (represented by an "X") and the horizontal lines receiver locations 32 (represented by a " * ").
      <br/>
      Design considerations for the orthogonal survey design 30 include the spacing of the source 33 and receiver 34 lines, and the spacing of the source and receiver locations along the source and receiver lines 33-34.
      <br/>
      There are many different designs that exist for 3D surveys, often with more complicated design criteria than the one presented in FIG. 3.
    </p>
    <p num="28">
      FIG. 4 shows the survey design of FIG. 3 in more detail, where the signal sent from any given source point 41 is monitored by multiple receivers 42 on different lines.
      <br/>
      The set of receivers 42 that monitor a single source signal is often referred to as a patch 43.
      <br/>
      Two racks are shown 44 and 48.
      <br/>
      A rack is a set of source locations on the same source line between two adjacent receiver lines.
      <br/>
      For example, rack 44 is the set of source locations 41 on the same source line 45 between two adjacent receiver lines 46-47.
      <br/>
      In general, all sources in a single rack 44 shoot into the same patch 43.
      <br/>
      The survey design in FIG. 4 is called an orthogonal, split-straddle design because there are an equal number of receiver lines on each side of the rack 44 in the patch 43.
      <br/>
      FIG. 18 is a block diagram illustrating a computer processor and a computer program embodiment of the invention.
      <br/>
      A computer 800 executes a computer program 802 for modeling and optimizing logistical operations problems 810 in land seismic survey operations.
      <br/>
      The computer program 802 contains logic for identifying decision variables 812 under user control for a logistical problem 810.
      <br/>
      The computer program further consists of logic to identify geophysical and operational constraints 813 and logic for quantifying variable problem parameters 811 for the logistical problem 810.
      <br/>
      The decision control variables, problem parameters, and constraints are input to a logic 814 for building a mathematical model of the logistical problem 810, the model being expressed as an objective function subject to a set of inequalities representing the constraints, the objective function being expressed in terms of the decision variables and problem parameters.
      <br/>
      The mathematical model is input to a logic 815 for optimizing the objective function and solving for the decision variables while satisfying the set of constraints to generate an optimal logistical problem solution 816.
    </p>
    <p num="29">
      FIG. 5 depicts an instance of reflection seismology.
      <br/>
      In reflection seismology, a signal is generated from a source point 51, follows along a ray path 52, and is reflected off an underground target level 53.
      <br/>
      The reflected ray path 54 returns to a receiver point 55.
      <br/>
      The reflected signal 54 provides information on the underground structure, in this case, a subsurface layer.
      <br/>
      The point of reflection of the underground target 53 between the source 51 and receiver 55 is called the common midpoint (CMP) 56. In seismic surveying, several receivers are usually activated to detect the signal sent out from a single source point.
      <br/>
      This permits the simultaneous sampling of several CMP 56.
      <br/>
      If the process is repeated for several sources 51, then the same CMP 56 get sampled several times.
      <br/>
      Sampling on the same point improves the signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) for the processing of the data.
      <br/>
      CMPs 56 that share more or less the same position are grouped into predefined rectangular bins.
      <br/>
      Bin size depends on target size, spatial resolution required, and economics.
      <br/>
      The economic aspect is based on the direct relationship between the bin size, and the source and receiver locations spacing.
      <br/>
      For an orthogonal design as shown in FIG. 3, the bin dimensions are one half the source and receiver spacings.
      <br/>
      During processing, the data in each bin are averaged (or stacked) in order to improve the (S/N).
      <br/>
      The number of CMPs in each bin is called the fold coverage.
      <br/>
      The source/receiver pairs for each bin have a range of offsets (distance from shot point to receiver) and azimuths (direction or compass angle from shot point to receiver).
      <br/>
      Fold coverage, range of offsets, and range of azimuths are the main measures by which the geophysical requirements of a 3D survey are assessed.
    </p>
    <p num="30">
      Turning now to FIG. 6, a data flow diagram for formulating a mathematical program model for minimizing 3D survey acquisition costs in the design and operations of a 3D seismic survey is shown.
      <br/>
      In FIG. 6, the flow diagram of FIG. 2 is implemented to solve the specific problem of minimizing survey acquisition costs 600.
      <br/>
      Source and receiver points in the survey are arranged in an orthogonal split-straddle design as shown in FIG. 4.
      <br/>
      The next step in formulating a mathematical programming model is to decide what decisions can be made that provide the opportunity to improve the survey design and operation and to determine the decision variables 601.
      <br/>
      On a land seismic survey, the main decisions involve how to shoot the survey and how to place the receiving equipment.
      <br/>
      These decisions must be made in the most cost effective manner subject to the geophysical and operations requirements of the survey.
      <br/>
      Decision variables for this problem are shown in Table 1.

      --      number of receiver lines to be even for the split-straddle design).
    </p>
    <p num="32">
      The next step is to begin to define the objective function 602.
      <br/>
      Using a top-down formulation approach, we start with:
    </p>
    <p num="33">Minimize Total Acquisition Costs per square km.</p>
    <p num="34">The objective can be subdivided and restated as:</p>
    <p num="35">Minimize Preparation Costs per square km+Shooting and Recording Costs per square km+Processing Costs per square km.</p>
    <p num="36">
      A preparation cost model is then determined 603.
      <br/>
      FIG. 7 is a flowchart that depicts the details of determining the preparation cost model 71.
      <br/>
      Preparation Costs include permitting costs 72, surveying costs 73, cutting and clearing costs 74, and drilling costs 75 (in the case when dynamite is used as the source).
      <br/>
      We assume that permitting costs 72 are a function of area and hence are constant per square km.
      <br/>
      Surveying costs 73 are a function of the number of source and receiver locations.
      <br/>
      The survey costs per square km can be written as
      <br/>
      CSSV *(1/SS)*(1/SLS)+CRSV *(1/RS)*(1/RLS),
      <br/>
      where CSSV and CRSV are surveying cost per source point and surveying cost per receiver point, respectively.
      <br/>
      The quantities CSSV and CRSV are examples of problem data that are assumed to be fixed and known.
    </p>
    <p num="37">
      The cutting and clearing costs 74 are functions of the length of the source and receiver lines.
      <br/>
      This quantity may be written as
      <br/>
      CSCC *(1/SLS)+CRCC *(1/RLS),
      <br/>
      where CSCC and CRCC are cutting and clearing costs per km for source and receiver lines, respectively.
    </p>
    <p num="38">
      Drilling costs 75 are a function of the number of source locations, assuming that the depth of the charge hole is constant.
      <br/>
      Therefore, drilling costs per square km may be written as
      <br/>
      CDR *(1/SS)*(1/SLS),
      <br/>
      where CDR is the drilling cost per source location.
      <br/>
      For a survey on which the source is not dynamite, CDR is set equal to zero.
    </p>
    <p num="39">
      Turning back to FIG. 6, shooting and recording cost models are determined 604.
      <br/>
      Shooting and recording costs can be separated into two components: crew costs and equipment costs.
      <br/>
      We assume that crew costs can be stated as an average daily rates.
      <br/>
      Thus, crew costs per square km are
      <br/>
      CCR *(NS/ND),
      <br/>
      where CCR is the average daily cost of the crew.
      <br/>
      We assume that an average daily equipment cost can be obtained which varies with the number of receiver channels used on the job.
      <br/>
      This can be stated as
      <br/>
      CEQ *(NR*(1+I))*(NS/ND),
      <br/>
      where CEQ is the equipment cost per channel per day and I is an inflation factor to calculate the total number of channels used by the crew (active patch+spares).
      <br/>
      For example, if I equals 0.5, the total number of channels is 1.5 times the number needed to cover the active patch.

    <p num="62">
      Another 3D seismic survey problem solved using mathematical programming techniques is the optimal routing of one or more source crews through a sequence of source location points.
      <br/>
      FIG. 8 represents a set of locations for a source crew to visit (called nodes 1-5).
      <br/>
      Each node 1-5 represents a rack, which is the set of source locations on the same source line between two adjacent receiver lines.
      <br/>
      FIG. 8 is limited to 5 racks, labeled nodes 1 to 5, arbitrarily located, and a base camp 81 to simplify the example (number of nodes=n=6), but could be extended to represent additional locations of racks in the survey.
      <br/>
      Arcs between the nodes 1-5 represent access roads.
      <br/>
      The time needed to go from one node to the other one is known and indicated on each arc (tij between node i and node j).
      <br/>
      For example, the time to go from the base camp 81 to node 5 is shown as T=4.
      <br/>
      The arcs are directed, that is, the cost of traveling from node i to node j may differ from the cost of traveling from node j to node i. This can happen, for example, when the path between two nodes is a road, and that both directions on this road are not adjacent, but go on each side of a hill.
      <br/>
      It allows more flexibility by removing symmetry in the graph.
      <br/>
      Nevertheless, to simplify the model, we set tij =tji in the example.

      Due to this symmetry, only half the arcs are represented in FIG. 8.

      In order to eliminate this isolated loop and generate the solution in FIG. 9, we must include an additional constraint:

    <p num="80">Optimizing the Placement of Recording Stations within a Seismic Survey</p>
    <p num="81">
      Another 3D seismic survey problem solved using mathematical programming techniques is the optimal placement of recording station locations within a survey.
      <br/>
      FIG. 11 shows the grid pattern and solutions for such a location problem.
      <br/>
      In this example, consider a square grid, of 10 points per side.
      <br/>
      Each corner of the grid represents a receiver location.
      <br/>
      The lowest left corner location is labeled 1.
      <br/>
      The label is incremented by 1 for each location, until the upper right corner, labeled 100.
      <br/>
      A recording station can only be positioned on the corner of the grid.
      <br/>
      We assume that it covers any point located within a circular area, centered on the station, with a radius of two grid cells.
      <br/>
      We want to determine where we should locate the recording station (or truck) to minimize the number of times needed to move it to cover the whole area.
      <br/>
      The problem can be formulated as shown in Table 5.
    </p>
    <p num="82">

      --                  of locations needed.
      <br/>
      --      Constraint: Each receiver location must be listened to.
    </p>
    <p num="83">
      Another way to formulate the constraint, which yields the same results but makes the optimization problem easier, is to say that each receiver location must be listened to at least once.
      <br/>
      To code this constraint, we define patternK, the set of receiver locations that are covered by a recording station located in k as shown in FIG. 12, which shows the algebraic formulation of the set of receiver locations covered by a recording station.
      <br/>
      PatternK is a column vector of a matrix.
      <br/>
      Each row of this matrix (index I) is associated with a receiver location.
      <br/>
      Each column (index k) is associated with a recording station potential location.
      <br/>
      In each column, a "1" indicates that the given receiver location (row) is covered by the recording station located at the given node (column), and a "0" indicates otherwise.
      <br/>
      The value of pattern23 is given as an example in FIG. 12. For example, a receiver located in 12 is covered by a recording station located in k=23, but a receiver located in 11 is not.
      <br/>
      The problem is modeled as the objective function:  (Equation image '4' not included in text)
    </p>
    <p num="84">subject to the constraints:  (Equation image '5' not included in text)</p>

    <p num="87">where patternlk is the Ith element of patternk.</p>
    <p num="88">
      It is important to note that if the shape of the area covered by the recording station is not circular for station k, patternk can be modified to reflect the correct shape.
      <br/>
      The method can be extended to any terrain or grid shape by reformulating the covering patterns.
    </p>
    <p num="89">
      The objective function is now optimized subject to the set of constraints using an optimization program.
      <br/>
      The vectors patternK are stored in a data file which is read by the optimization program.
      <br/>
      Results indicate that the optimal number of station locations is 11.
      <br/>
      Multiple optimal solutions exist, for example locations (3,7,30,31,35,52,58,75,82,90 and 96) or (1,6,16,20,33,48,61,65,80,93 and 97), as shown in FIG. 11. These optimal solutions have different properties.
      <br/>
      For example, the total distance, computed here along the grid lines (rectilinear distances), to travel from each receiver location to the station which records its signal is smaller for the first solution optimal solution, represented with squares, than for the second optimal solution (162 distance units vs. 170).
      <br/>
      If the user wishes to minimize the number of moves of the recording station and the total distance between recording station locations and receiver locations, these two criteria can be put together in the objective function.
      <br/>
      The new objective function becomes:  (Equation image '6' not included in text)
    </p>
    <p num="90">
      The distance between each receiver location I and the possible recording station k, distIk, may be computed separately, and stored in a second data file, used by the optimization program that solves the objective function.
      <br/>
      This addition is useful if the recording is done using cables to minimize the length of cables needed.
      <br/>
      This problem formulation has other potential applications on a land seismic survey.
      <br/>
      Examples include optimal placement of shots and receivers, optimal location of trouble shooting crews, and optimal location of the base camp or repair facilities.

      Another 3D seismic survey problem solved using mathematical programming techniques is optimizing the placement of source locations using a location model to minimize costs subject to geophysical and operational constraints.

      FIG. 13 shows the set of thirty potential shot locations 130 to be used to select an optimal set of shot locations.

      The set of potential shot locations 130 labeled 1 through 30 are represented on a grid in between two receiver lines 131 and 132.
      <br/>
      After the location problem has been modeled as an objective function and a set of constraints, the optimal solution for shot locations is determined and shown in FIG. 13. The optimal set of shot locations are those labeled 1 through 5 (133) and 25 through 30 (134).

    <p num="94">The problem is modeled as the objective function:  (Equation image '7' not included in text)</p>
    <p num="95">
      The model is linear which makes it generally easier to solve than a nonlinear formulation.
      <br/>
      The model is based on the assumptions that offset and azimuth can be subdivided into ranges and that the quantities .function.k,  THETA kg(min),  THETA kg(max),  DELTA km(min), and  DELTA km(max) can be input by the user or derived from user input.
      <br/>
      Selecting ranges requires some judgment on the part of the user.
      <br/>
      Selecting ranges too narrow will result in a large number of constraints with large data requirements.
      <br/>
      The current formulation contains a level of abstraction that must be resolved in order to create a model corresponding to an actual survey design.
      <br/>
      In particular, the sets  PHI k,  ALPHA kg and  BETA km for k=1, 2, . . . , K, g=1, 2, . . . , G, m=1, 2, . . ., M, must be specifically determined in order to completely specify the constraints.
    </p>
    <p num="96">
      The set of potential locations for adding shots may contain shot locations that have already been fixed.
      <br/>
      For example, in an offset problem where shots need to be relocated to avoid obstacles in the field, most shots are fixed and only a subset needs to be relocated.
      <br/>
      Since the model does not need to determine shot locations that have already been fixed, either the corresponding decision variable can be constrained to one or left out of the model altogether.
      <br/>
      From a computational standpoint, the latter option is better but requires adjustment of the fold, offset, and azimuth constraints to reflect the additional amount required instead of the total amount.
      <br/>
      Only bins and ranges modified by the exclusion points need to be considered, decreasing also the number of constraints in the model.
    </p>
    <p num="97">
      In this model, we assume that the potential shot locations 130 labeled 1 through 30 on FIG. 13 can be assigned a cost associated with locating a shot point.
      <br/>
      More specifically, we assume that each ci is an accurate representation of what it costs to have a source point located at node i on the grid.
      <br/>
      This necessitates the aggregation of data.
      <br/>
      The cost information may be better represented by modeling the routing cost explicitly, and necessitates the consideration of the location and vehicle routing model which follows.

    <p num="99">
      Another 3D seismic survey problem solved using mathematical programming techniques is optimizing the placement of source locations and vehicle routing, including the sequence of shots.
      <br/>
      FIG. 14A shows a problem of optimizing source locations and vehicles routing with a set of nine potential shot locations 140 numbered vertically starting in the top left corner from 1 through 9.
      <br/>
      Base camps 1 and 2 are also shown.
      <br/>
      The number of source crews can vary, and in this instance the model is implemented for one or two crews.
      <br/>
      The first bin 141 includes nodes 1 to 7, and the second bin 142 includes notes 4 through 9.
      <br/>
      Two values are considered for the azimuth: horizontal and vertical (angles of 0, 90, 180 and 270 degrees), and diagonal (angles of 45, 135, 225 and 335 degrees).
      <br/>
      Only two values are considered for the offsets also: 1 for neighboring nodes, and 1.4 for neighboring nodes on a diagonal.
      <br/>
      One shot per bin is required.
      <br/>
      The values of minimum and maximum fold coverage are not restrictive on the choice of the set of shot locations.
      <br/>
      FIG. 14B shows the resulting solution.
      <br/>
      The solver selects base camp 2 and shot nodes 6 and 9 going from the base camp to node 6, then from node 6 to node 9 and then back to base camp 2.
      <br/>
      Due to symmetry in the model, many alternative optimum solutions exist such as base camp 2 to node 3 to node 6 and back to base camp 2; base camp 1 to node 7 to node 8 and back to base camp 1; and base camp 1 to node 8 to node 9 and back to base camp 1.

      <br/>
      There are alternative formulations, such as constraints on Xmin, the largest minimum offset, Xmax, the largest recorded offset, and formulating differently the azimuth constraints.
      <br/>
      The formulations discussed below assume that the initial design respects the geophysical constraints, and concentrates on the changes produced by the new shot point locations.
    </p>
    <p num="120">
      Constraints may be placed on Xmin, where Xmin is the length of the diagonal of a rectangle bounded by two source lines and two receiver lines.
      <br/>
      Let Xmin be the largest minimum offset accepted and B be the set of rectangles with at least one corner in an exclusion zone (i.e., one corner belongs to S*).
      <br/>
      There are four rectangles per shot point in an exclusion zone.
      <br/>
      Only one diagonal needs to be computed per shot point in an exclusion zone, though, determined by the value of Yil, i EPSILON S*, L EPSILON Li.
      <br/>
      So we have .vertline.S*.vertline. inequalities of the form:
      <br/>
      diagonal(a,b,c,d) &lt;= Xmin,
    </p>
    <p num="121">
      where a,b,c,d are the corners of the rectangle, with coordinates (*x,*y), and diagonal () the function computing Xmin, i.e.:

      diagonal(a,b,c,d)=max((cx -ax)2 +(cy -ay)2, (dx -bx)2 +(dy -by)2).
    </p>
    <p num="122">
      Constraints may be placed on Xmax, where Xmax is half the diagonal of a patch.
      <br/>
      The same technique as above can be used, centered on patches rather than rectangles.
      <br/>
      Constraints may also be placed on the azimuths.
      <br/>
      When an alternative location is selected, four azimuths change, one in each rectangle having the new point as a corner.
      <br/>
      So an azimuth cannot change by more than  +- 4.vertline.S*.vertline.. The azimuths can be computed when the alternative locations are known, and counters can be set to ensure the requirements.
    </p>
    <p num="123">
      These formulations present advantages over the previous ones because (1) the number of constraints is much smaller than in the previous formulation, making the problem less complex and easier to solve; and (2) there is no quantity to estimate: xmin and xmax can easily be given by the user.
      <br/>
      However, they rely on a definition which might be limited to the surface, and therefore not be strong enough to represent the geophysical constraints of the survey.
      <br/>
      In this case, the model using the new formulation rather than the previous one would be a relaxation of the original problem, giving an objective function and decision variables more or less close to the optimal solution.

    <p num="127">Optimizing Source Location and Vehicle Routing along with Receiver Equipment Layout Operational Constraints</p>
    <p num="128">
      Another 3D seismic survey problem solved using mathematical programming techniques is optimizing shot location and vehicle routing together with the operational constraints associated with the receiver equipment layout.
      <br/>
      Incorporating receiver equipment layout constraints requires a much more sophisticated model formulation.
      <br/>
      It also leads to a larger scale model that is even harder to solve to optimality than the combined location and vehicle routing model discussed previously.
      <br/>
      To overcome the problems with solving a larger scale model to optimality, one approach to incorporating receiver equipment constraints is an extension of a restricted form of the location and vehicle routing model.
    </p>
    <p num="129">
      FIG. 16 shows the incorporation of receiver equipment layout constraints into a source location and routing problem along with an optimal solution.
      <br/>
      In FIG. 16, a set of source locations 160 which includes nodes 1, 2, 25, 26, 27, 51, 52, 53, 54 are located on one side of a receiver line 161.
      <br/>
      Another set of source locations 162 are located on the opposite side of the receiver line 161 and include nodes 56, 58, 59, 81, 84, 85, 106, 107 and 108.
      <br/>
      A base camp 163 starting and ending position for the survey is located on one side of the receiver line.
      <br/>
      Limited receiver equipment restricts (or penalizes) certain movements of the source crew(s) across the receiver line 161.
      <br/>
      Penalties can be incorporated into the location and vehicle routing model by adjusting the cost coefficients (i.e.,  KAPPA ij) on routes across the receiver lines 161 that would represent expensive equipment movements.
      <br/>
      For example, crossing a receiver line 161 to shoot a source location might require the movement of an entire receiver line from the back to the front of spread layout in order to set up the necessary active set of receivers.
      <br/>
      Expensive line crossings may depend on the survey design and the amount of receiver equipment available.
    </p>
    <p num="130">
      To solve this difficulty, the model is restricted to a fixed initial starting point (base camp 163) that goes directly to a single point on the survey node 1, which is the closest point to the base camp.
      <br/>
      We assume that the receivers are laid out on parallel lines 161 on the grid defined for the potential source locations.
      <br/>
      Additionally, we assume that the following information is fixed and given: (1) the total number of receiver channels; (2) the number of channels/receiver line; and (3) the number of active receiver lines.
      <br/>
      Items 1 and 2 can be used to calculate the total number of receiver lines.
      <br/>
      The latter can be compared with item 3 to determine the number racks that can be shot in a sequence on a single shot line without an expensive move of receiver equipment.
      <br/>
      A rack is defined as the number of shots on a single shot line between two adjacent receiver lines.
      <br/>
      It is assumed that all shots in a rack shoot into the same set of active receivers.
      <br/>
      The cost coefficients that correspond to an expensive receiver line crossing are adjusted to reflect the additional cost.
      <br/>
      One could compensate for the restrictions to a certain extent by running different scenarios for the location base camp and the other three items.
      <br/>
      The procedure of adjusting the cost coefficients may be easily automated for a regular survey design.
      <br/>
      For irregular designs, automation might be difficult and individual consideration of the cost coefficients may be necessary.
      <br/>
      In practice, a combination of the two (automation with some adjustment) would be necessary for most surveys since most designs start from a regular base and are adjusted for local irregularities such as exclusion zones.
      <br/>
      In the resulting optimization also shown in FIG. 16, the number of crossings of the receiver line 161 is limited to two: the path 164 going from node 54 to node 108, and the path 165 and going from node 56 back to base camp 163.
      <br/>
      This limits the number of times the receiver equipment must be moved and optimizes cost.

    <p num="132">
      Another 3D seismic survey logistic operations problem solved using mathematical programming techniques is amount of gas to be purchased for equipment operations before starting a survey.
      <br/>
      This problem involves a stochastic problem, that is, the problem data are not known with certainty, but have a known probability distribution function.
      <br/>
      One of the most studied class of problems in stochastic programming is the two-stage stochastic model: the decision maker has to take a decision now (first stage) not knowing what the future will be.
      <br/>
      When the future occurs, the decision maker can adjust his decision (second stage), at a certain cost.
      <br/>
      Consider, for example, that the decision to be made is the amount of gas to be purchased for equipment operations before starting a survey, i.e., now. As the terrain is not known with certainty, the amount of gas needed, d, is not known with certainty either.
      <br/>
      Going around canyons and creeks increases the gas consumption.
      <br/>
      If the decision maker buys too much gas, the extra gas is sold back to the gas company, at 70% of the initial price.
      <br/>
      If, on the contrary, the amount of gas reserved is not sufficient, the decision maker can ask the gas company to deliver more gas to the local distributor, and buy this gas, at a price higher (c2) than the current price (c1), due to transportation and local distribution costs.
      <br/>
      This problem can be formulated as shown in Table 10.

      Results indicate that the decision maker should buy 1150 gallons of gas now (for a total cost of $528).
      <br/>
      If the demand turns out to be higher, the decision maker will then buy the extra gas from the local distributor.
      <br/>
      If the demand is lower, the extra gas is refunded at 70% of the original price by the gas company.
      <br/>
      This scenario is called first scenario in the discussion below.
      <br/>
      Assume now that the probabilities are changed so that low demands are more probable (scenario low), or, symmetrically, high demands more probable (scenario high).
      <br/>
      New probabilities are given for each of these scenarios in Table 11.
    </p>

      --        P(d = 1300) 0.1         0.4
    </p>
    <p num="144">
      In scenario low, the value of X decreases to 1000 gallons for an expected cost of $459.25. Since the probability of getting a high demand is low, less gas needs to be purchased in the first-stage than previously.
      <br/>
      On the other hand, due to the high cost of gas in the second-stage, enough gas is bought to face the demand 80% of the time.
      <br/>
      For scenario high, X increases to 1300 gallons, for an expected cost of $580.
      <br/>
      Following the same reasoning, it is wiser to buy in the first-stage enough gas to face a high demand, because it costs less in an average to resale excess gas than face a likely shortage.
    </p>
    <p num="145">
      Consider now that the decision maker can only buy full tanks of gas from the oil company.
      <br/>
      A tank contains 150 gallons of gas.
      <br/>
      The problem is now a stochastic model with integer first-stage decision variables that represent the number of tanks of gas purchased.
      <br/>
      Additionally, c1 is changed from cost per gallon to cost per tank.
      <br/>
      Consider that the demand can take the different values with the same probability.
      <br/>
      The decision maker should now buy 8 full tanks of gas (1200 gallons), thus 50 gallons more than previously, for an expected cost of $595.
      <br/>
      It is interesting to notice that the solution found is as close as possible to the solution of the first scenario.
      <br/>
      Consider now that 3 types of tanks are available, of capacities 100, 150 and 175 gallons.
      <br/>
      In this case, the variable X is replaced by three decision variables that represent the number of each size of tank purchased.
      <br/>
      The optimal solution is to one tank of 100 gallons and 7 tanks of 150 gallons (so a total of 1150 gallons) for an expected cost of $528, as previously.
      <br/>
      Let now the cost of gas per gallon decrease as the size of the tank increases.
      <br/>
      The solution reflects the discounted price: the best action consists of buying 7 tanks of 175 gallons (the largest tank and thus the smallest cost), for a total of 1225 gallons and $323.7. Lower costs in the first-stage implies a decrease in willingness to risk not meeting the demand and having to purchase gas later.
    </p>
    <p num="146">
      In this example, the demand is a discrete random variable.
      <br/>
      A variation of this problem is to use a continuous distribution.
      <br/>
      Such problems can be solved using Monte-Carlo sampling to approximate the distribution.
      <br/>
      It is also possible to extend this example by introducing random costs.
    </p>
    <p num="147">
      Other applications of stochastic programming exist in land seismic surveying operations.
      <br/>
      For example, equipment procurement on a survey sometimes involves the decision of purchasing new equipment versus procuring used, possibly less reliable equipment from other crews or other parts of the world.
      <br/>
      Most of the examples could be formulated as stochastic models if some of their parameters are random.
