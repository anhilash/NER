      Mastication articles are very popular with pets, and especially so with dogs.
      <br/>
      There are two basic types of mastication articles: digestible and non-digestible.
      <br/>
      The prototypical digestible type is "rawhide" or rawhide-derived; but starch- or seed-based or other digestible materials may be used as well.
      <br/>
      The non-digestible type is more variegated, and may include alone or in part components comprised of molded plastic, rope, textile fabrics, fiber-fill, foam, as well as other components.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      Mastication articles can provide therapeutic as well as amusement value to the pets that chew on them.
      <br/>
      The mastication provides a degree of exercise and cleans and massages the teeth and gums of the pet; and, pets (especially dogs) seem to enjoy mastication on things.
      <br/>
      In addition, giving pets desirable articles on which to chew may preclude them from mastication on other things that may be harmful to them or would upset the pet's owner.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      Mastication articles for pets tend to become messy and unsanitary as the pets chew on them.
      <br/>
      There is also a risk of microbial proliferation on or within the mastication articles during their storage.
      <br/>
      Both of these factors are especially problematic for digestible mastication articles, which provide ample nutritional resources for the abundant proliferation of microbes.
      <br/>
      It is therefore useful and valuable to provide sanitary mastication articles that are resistant to the proliferation of microbes and optionally to odors.
      <br/>
      Because pets chew continually upon these articles, and because pets can eventually digest these articles (even when they are not intended for digestion), toxicity considerations with regard to the microbe-inhibiting treatment are important.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      Of the digestible type, rawhide is the most popular type of mastication article.
      <br/>
      Ready-to-use rawhide may be acquired commercially in a variety of forms and is manufactured from animal (preferably cattle) hides by methods known in the Art (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,114,704).
      <br/>
      The manufacturing process generally consists of several steps.
      <br/>
      After the raw hides are obtained, they are usually treated in a lime-based solution (liming), the primary object of which is to loosen the hair on the hide.
      <br/>
      To the solution may be added ammonium salts, sodium sulfide, or other additives.
      <br/>
      After the liming treatment, the hair is removed from the hide, either by hand or using a dehairing machine.
      <br/>
      In the next step, known as "fleshing," tissue is removed from the flesh side of the hide.
      <br/>
      This may be performed with a special knife or with a fleshing machine.
      <br/>
      It is then necessary to ensure that all of the lime is removed from the hide.
      <br/>
      Washing in water can remove much of the lime, but it is generally necessary to use a more aggressive treatment with acids or acid salts to remove the remainder.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      After the hides are dehaired, fleshed, and cleaned, they may be cut into the desired shapes and manipulated.
      <br/>
      Drying may be done in ambient air or preferably in an oven at elevated temperatures (usually less than 150 (degree)  C.).

      <br/>
      The rawhide is treated with enzymes that are released into the dog's saliva upon mastication.
      <br/>
      Once in the dog's saliva, these enzymes set off a chain of reactions that attack oral pathogens present in the dog's mouth.
      <br/>
      Thiocyanate and iodide additives may optionally be added to enhance this effect.

      Mastication articles of the non-digestible type are considerably more variegated than those of the digestible type.

      They may be comprised of solid molded plastic, hollow molded plastic, textile fabrics, rope-materials, synthetic or natural fiber-fill, foams, etc.
      <br/>
      They generally possess a texture and structure that combine to create a desirable "mouth-feel" for the pet.

      Despite the desirability of effective microbe-inhibiting mastication articles for pets, there have been no practical solutions that would provide effective and continual protection against microbial proliferation in or on the articles.
      <br/>
      The only two disclosures which even remotely relate to microbe inhibition are the aforementioned U.S. Pat. No. 5,477,815, which only relates to enhanced drying of a rope-based article to shorten the period of time it is most susceptible to microbial proliferation; and U.S. Pat. No. 5,310,541, in which the rawhide is a carrier for an enzyme to be released into a dog's mouth.
      <br/>
      In the latter invention, the rawhide is only a vehicle for delivering a reaction-initiating enzyme into the dog's mouth.
      <br/>
      The enzyme, which is inactive with respect to microbes, reacts with the salivary solution in the dog's mouth, ultimately resulting in the temporary creation of ions in solution which attack oral pathogens in the dog's mouth; and these ions can exist only in the dog's saliva.
      <br/>
      The rawhide article itself therefore contains no species that will inhibit subsequent microbial proliferation in and on the article (any such species which are transferred to the article from the dog's saliva will soon dry-up and thus become ineffective).
    </p>
    <p num="22">Thus, there is a need in the art for mastication articles for pets, where the proliferation of microbes is prevented in and on the articles; where the microbe-inhibiting properties of the articles are continually active and durable; where these articles are desirable and attractive to the pets for which they are intended; and where these articles are safe for pets and humans.</p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="23">
      According to the invention, mastication articles for pets have an effective of amount of microbe-inhibiting agent or property that is effective in limiting microbial proliferation, and at the same time is not present in quantity, concentration, or nature whereby the articles may be harmful to the pets or humans who come into contact with the articles.
      <br/>
      The effective amount of the microbe-inhibiting agent or property limits the spread of the microbe-inhibiting chemicals or agents within and about the article, and takes into consideration the patterns of use and material structure of the article.
      <br/>
      The microbe-inhibiting agent or property can be at least one of a microbe-cidal, microbe-starving, and microbe-impenetrable agent.
      <br/>
      In one embodiment, a digestible mastication article is selected from a group consisting of animal skin, animal fat, vegetable, a vegetable starch or some blend thereof.
      <br/>
      In another embodiment, a non-digestible mastication article comprises at least one material selected from a group consisting of polymeric resins or solutions, fibers or threads, textile materials, foams, or some blend thereof.

      The active layer is selected from a group consisting of silver, copper oxide, zinc silicate and blends thereof.
      <br/>
      In a further embodiment, the active layer includes a barrier coating, whereby the rate of release of the microbe-inhibiting agent or property can be controlled.
      <br/>
      Also, the active layer can include a dispersion coating, whereby the core particles in the material are dispersed.
    </p>
    <p num="25">
      In another embodiment of the invention, the mastication article comprises rope, wherein the rope can be made of at least one material selected from a group, cotton, sisal, hemp, jute, henequen and blends thereof.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, the mastication article made from rope can include a core made of a hydrophobic material such as nylon.
    </p>
    <p num="26">
      In another embodiment of the invention, the mastication article is made of at least one material selected from the group including nylon, polyurethane, polyolefins and blends thereof.
      <br/>
      Such a mastication article can include a nutritive attracting agent within the material.
      <br/>
      Such a nutritive attracting agent is preferably selected from the group including animal meal, meat broth, dried meat, sugar and blends thereof.
    </p>
    <p num="27">
      Further, according to the invention, a method for producing a mastication article having a tough, chew resistant material and defining a shape in the form of a small article for enticing or being retrieved by a domestic animal comprises the step of applying an effective amount of a microbe-inhibiting agent to the tough, chew resistant material.

    <p num="28">
      In one embodiment, the microbe-inhibiting agent is in particulate form and is incorporated into core particles in the article.
      <br/>
      The core particles are selected from a group including zinc oxide, titanium oxide, barium sulfate and blends thereof.
      <br/>
      The process can include the additional step of incorporating the particles into a resin that is molded into the tough, chew resistant material.

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="37">
      Referring to FIGS. 1-5, several embodiments of a mastication article are shown.
      <br/>
      In FIG. 1, a first embodiment of a mastication article 10 made of a tough chew-resistant rawhide material 12 is shown.
      <br/>
      The rawhide material 12 includes a microbe-inhibiting agent applied to or incorporated therein, as will be discussed further below.
      <br/>
      A second embodiment is a mastication article 20 made of a rope material 22, as shown in FIG. 2.
      <br/>
      The rope material 22 preferably comprises cotton, and is treated with a microbe-inhibiting agent as will be described below.
      <br/>
      As shown in FIG. 3, the mastication article 20 may include a core 24 comprising a different material, usually a hydrophobic material such as nylon.
      <br/>
      FIG. 4 shows another embodiment of a mastication article 30 made of a plastic material 32.
      <br/>
      The mastication article 30 may be hollow, having a open center 34, as shown in FIG. 5, or solid (not shown), and is treated with a microbe-inhibiting agent during formation, as will be described below.
    </p>
    <p num="38">
      The term "microbe-inhibiting" in the present disclosure subsumes all characteristics (and the means for imparting these characteristics) which cause the mastication articles to be inhospitable to microbes.
      <br/>
      Distinctions can be made between three types of microbe inhibition:
    </p>
    <p num="39">
      "Microbe-cidal" refers to a property whereby microbes are actively killed or otherwise rendered ineffective.
      <br/>
      If a microbe comes within a sufficiently close range (direct contact, for some materials; within a "zone of inhibition" for others ) of a microbe-cidal material, it will be killed or otherwise rendered ineffective.
      <br/>
      Microbe-cidal properties may be imparted to materials by a variety of means.
      <br/>
      A preferred means uses microbe-cidal agents during the manufacturing process of the materials and/or treats the materials with microbe-cidal agents.
      <br/>
      A number of preferred agents are disclosed below.
      <br/>
      For the microbe-cidal property to be durable, it is often preferred that the agents be bonded in some manner to the materials comprising the pet article.
      <br/>
      Such materials exhibit smaller zones of inhibition than materials containing non- or weakly bonded agents, but the microbe-cidal property with regard to microbes coming directly into contact with the material can be more durable.
      <br/>
      Using agents which are insoluble or only sparingly soluble in water can also be a key element for durability.
    </p>
    <p num="40">
      "Microbe-starving" refers to a property whereby microbes are controlled or eliminated by deprivation of sources of nutrition.
      <br/>
      A material is said possess microbe-starving properties if microbes in contact with the material have difficulty acquiring the resources they need to survive.
      <br/>
      One can often provide or enhance a microbe-starving characteristic to a material by changing or altogether eliminating additives to the materials (e.g., plasticizers, fillers, or processing aids).
      <br/>
      Since adhered dust or liquids can provide nutrition for microbes, it is preferred that the material be provided with anti-adhesion properties (e.g., anti-static, low surface energy, etc.).
    </p>
    <p num="41">
      "Microbe-impenetrable" refers to the property of a material or coating which is impenetrable whereby a microbe cannot pass through the material or coating.
      <br/>
      In this case, microbes may proliferate to some degree on a surface of the material, but such proliferation will be confined to the surface.
      <br/>
      Thus if an article is treated on its exterior by a microbe-impenetrable coating, microbes from the environment will not be able to pass into the interior of the article, will be limited in the degree to which they can proliferate, and can more readily be removed by washing.
      <br/>
      Appropriate placement of microbe-impenetrable materials is important to their effectiveness in providing the microbe-inhibiting property.
    </p>
    <p num="42">
      It is often efficacious to fight the battle against microbial proliferation on several fronts.
      <br/>
      Thus preferred microbe-inhibiting mastication articles for pets will often possess combinations of microbe-inhibiting behavior.
      <br/>
      For example, when a particular component of a mastication article is most susceptible to microbial attack, this component may be treated with both a microbe-impenetrable layer and a microbe-cidal agent, while the remainder of the article is treated with only the microbe-cidal agent.
      <br/>
      Further, an additive which serves as a resource for microbial growth may be important only for certain parts of the article.
      <br/>
      For example, plasticizers often act as an effective resource for microbial proliferation; and one can use the plasticizer only where the flexibility is needed, and then treat this area with an effective combination of microbe-inhibiting characteristics; and the remainder of the article, where the plasticizer was not used, may be less vigorously protected.
    </p>
    <p num="43">
      For durability, the microbe-inhibiting agents should not readily dissolve into the fluids with which they come into contact.
      <br/>
      This includes fluids associated with their use (saliva, urine, or other bodily fluids) as well as washing and cleaning fluids (the microbe-inhibiting activity should be durable to repeated home laundering).
      <br/>
      The insolubility may be an intrinsic characteristic of the agent-fluid combination, or it may be due to the fact that the agents are well bonded to the materials comprising the article.
      <br/>
      Both types are included in the present invention.
    </p>
    <p num="44">Although both water-durable and non-water-durable microbe-inhibiting components can be used with effectiveness in the present invention, if a non-water-durable microbe-inhibiting component is used, the exterior of the exposed material should desirably be provided with water-repellent or otherwise water-insulating qualities.</p>
    <p num="45">
      In a preferred class of embodiments, microbe-inhibiting properties are conferred upon one or more of the materials comprising the pet article by treating the material with or otherwise incorporating into the material a microbe-inhibiting agent.
      <br/>
      This microbe-inhibiting agent is a chemical agent or particle that imparts to the material an effective microbe-inhibiting property.
      <br/>
      The microbe-inhibiting agents will often function primarily through a microbe-cidal mechanism.
      <br/>
      The microbe-inhibiting agents are typically chemicals, polymers, solutions (solid or liquid), or particulates (which may possess their own microbe-inhibiting activity or can act as hosts for other microbe-inhibiting agents).
      <br/>
      These microbe-inhibiting agents can exist in a variety of forms and be held in a variety of hosts before being incorporated into the mastication article.
      <br/>
      For example, they can be dissolved in a liquid; they can be incorporated in or form a particulate phase, either dry or suspended in a liquid; they can be included within a plasticizer compound; or they can be pre-incorporated into a material used in manufacturing the article (e.g., one can employ materials which already possess microbe-inhibiting properties).
    </p>
    <p num="46">Examples of chemical microbe-inhibiting agents for use in polymers may be found in Plastics Additives and Modifiers Handbook, pp. 338-350, J. Edenbaum, Ed., Chapman and Hall, Great Britain, 1996, and herein incorporated by reference.</p>
    <p num="47">
      The microbe-inhibiting treatment can be carried out at different points during the process of manufacturing the article or its component materials.
      <br/>
      For example, one can incorporate microbe-inhibiting agents in fibers as they are being manufactured, which microbe-inhibiting fibers can be used as the filling of stuffed mastication articles or as the fabric used as the external covers of mastication articles.
      <br/>
      One can also manufacture a microbe-inhibiting elastomeric-like material for use in a component of the mastication article which is made of (e.g., molded) plastic.
      <br/>
      One can also treat (as by spraying or soaking) some or all of the materials after they are partially or completely manufactured (e.g., one can soak rawhide sheets or the rope which will be later cut and formed into rope-bones in a microbe-inhibiting treatment solution; or one can treat the external cover and/or the filling or some component of the filling of a mastication articles before their final assembly).
      <br/>
      Alternatively or in addition, one can treat (as by spraying or dipping) the pet article when it is finished or nearly finished its manufacture.
      <br/>
      It is often preferred to perform soak treatments under elevated temperatures and/or pressures.
    </p>
    <p num="48">
      Microbe-inhibiting agents can be incorporated into the constituent material(s) of a mastication article by admixing the agent or a carrier for the agent with the raw ingredients to the material (e.g., add a liquid containing the agent to the resin mix before injection molding a plastic article).
      <br/>
      In this case, the microbe-inhibiting agent is usually dispersed relatively uniformly throughout the final article.
    </p>
    <p num="49">In cases where surface attachment is desired, the use of adhesion promoters is preferred, particularly in conjunction with "raw" microbe-inhibiting agents, i.e., those which do not need to be in solution to work effectively.</p>
    <p num="50">
      In cases where a bonding agent is not used to adhere the microbe-cidal agent to the mastication article material, or where such bonding is not entirely effective, it is often useful to diminish the rate at which the active microbe-inhibiting agent becomes de-activated.
      <br/>
      This process can be done by inhibiting volatilization or adding stabilizers.
    </p>
    <p num="51">
      When the microbe-cidal agents are not bonded or are only weakly bonded to materials forming the mastication article, it is preferred to package the articles such that the effective shelf life of the antimicrobial character is enhanced.
      <br/>
      For example, when volatilization of the antimicrobial agent is a problem, the packaging material can be made impervious to the antimicrobial agent.
    </p>
    <p num="52">
      It is useful to have a microbe-inhibiting agent at the surface of the mastication article, as well as in the interior.
      <br/>
      The microbe-inhibiting agent at the surface can be effective in inhibiting the proliferation of microbes directly on the surface.
      <br/>
      If suitable microbe-inhibiting agents are present in the interior, they can migrate to the surface as the agent initially at the surface becomes displaced.
      <br/>
      This effectively constitutes a "time-release" of microbe-inhibiting agent.
      <br/>
      In this manner, the concentration of the agent can be maintained at a safe level, any odors associated with unduly high concentrations of the agent are avoided, and the period of effective microbe-inhibiting protection can be considerably prolonged.
    </p>
    <p num="53">
      The microbe-inhibiting agent can be applied in a liquid form (as dissolved in a solvent) and deposited on the surface of the mastication article material.
      <br/>
      By choosing properly the liquid, material, environmental conditions (e.g., temperature, pressure) and optionally any additives, the agent can be made to penetrate the material; and a "time-release" system can be obtained.
    </p>
    <p num="54">
      A "time-release" property may also be provided by incorporating the active agent in a separate material, optionally particulate, which releases the agent in a time-controlled manner.
      <br/>
      For example, one can saturate a particulate zeolitic material with a microbe-inhibiting agent and incorporate the zeolitic material into the pet article.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, one can use a textile chosen specifically for its time-release characteristics for a particular microbe-inhibiting agent; and this textile may be incorporated in the mastication article.
    </p>
    <p num="55">
      If some form of heat-assisted disinfection of the articles is desired, it is important to use material-agent systems which do not degrade in the disinfection environment (e.g., washers, microwave, thermal ovens, etc.).
      <br/>
      The softening or decomposition temperatures of the polymers and chemical agents used, for example, must be higher than the disinfection temperature used.
    </p>
    <p num="56">
      Because the accumulation of undesired organic or inorganic matter may reduce the efficacy of microbe-inhibiting protection, the articles can be designed with materials which reduce the tendency for such accumulation.
      <br/>
      This can be accomplished by using low surface energy materials or applying a low surface energy coating; and/or by using anti-static materials or applying an anti-static coating.
      <br/>
      Non-hydrophilic materials (materials upon which water droplets form contact angles greater than about 30 degrees) are generally preferred to prevent the adhesion of such undesired matter.
    </p>
    <p num="57">
      Pets, especially dogs, often tear or otherwise damage or digest the mastication articles that they use.
      <br/>
      It is therefore important that the materials be non-toxic, non-carcinogenic, and effectively non-allergenic at the levels used in the articles.
      <br/>
      Some agents are non-toxic even at relatively high concentrations (e.g., triclosan, diiodomethyl-p-tolylsulphone, stabilized chlorine dioxide); other agents are non-toxic at relatively low concentrations, but become toxic at high concentrations (e.g., many unbonded quaternary ammonium compounds).
      <br/>
      If a mastication article employs a time release property, one must ensure that the time-releasing materials do not contain concentrations of the agents which exceed those which can be safely eaten by the animal of interest.
      <br/>
      The pet should be able to eat the article without harm.
      <br/>
      Also, the treated materials should be non-skin-sensitizing, i.e., should not generally cause allergic or other undesirable reactions on the skin or other membranes of the pet or people who effectively come into contact with the materials.

      <br/>
      At least some fraction of the constituent materials has microbe-inhibiting properties.
    </p>
    <p num="61">
      In preparing microbe-inhibiting synthetic materials derived from polymers, the microbe-inhibiting agents are preferably added to the precursor material (e.g., into the resin mix for molded plastics or into the melt or spin dope from which fibers are spun).
      <br/>
      For natural materials, the microbe-inhibiting agents are preferably either impregnated into the materials via a spray or soaking treatment.
      <br/>
      Microbe-inhibiting agents or carriers with such agents can also be included in an admixture of natural and/or synthetic materials that are to be transformed into the finished article.

    <p num="62">
      Phenol derivatives, especially 2,4,4'-trichloro-2'-hydroxydiphenol (known as Triclosan, Irgasan, Microban, etc.) are attractive and are preferred.

      <br/>
      Organotins, especially tri-n-butyltin maleate (as in Ultra Fresh DM-50), are also attractive and preferred.

      Soak-treating in an aqueous solution containing stabilized chlorine dioxide is also preferred.
    </p>
    <p num="63">
      It is important to note that post-treatment methods involve importantly different considerations when one is using a "strongly-bonded" type of agent.
      <br/>
      In the "diffusing" or "nonstrongly-bonded" case, one immerses or otherwise exposes the materials to a solution containing a particular concentration of the agent.
      <br/>
      Generally, the agent diffuses into the material until its concentration in the material is comparable to the concentration in the solution, i.e., the treatment level of the material is essentially proportional to the concentration of the agent in solution; and the agent concentration in the solution is the primary controlling variable.
      <br/>
      In typical treatments, the agent in solution is not appreciably depleted; and the amount of material exposed to the treatment solution is not carefully monitored and is not considered a primary variable of the treatment process.
    </p>
    <p num="64">
      In the strongly-bonded case, however, the agent usually does not diffuse into the material; rather, it chemically reacts with the surface of the material.
      <br/>
      Here one attempts to arrange conditions such that most of the "reactable" agent present in the solution reacts with and bonds to the surface of the material being treated.
      <br/>
      Knowledge of the amount of material being treated is thus important in determining the treatment level; and the material amount, along with the agent concentration in solution, are considered controlling variables of the treatment.
    </p>
    <p num="65">
      The term "amount of material," is intended to mean the "amount of reactable surface" of the material.
      <br/>
      For porous materials which can take up the solvent in their interiors (e.g., many natural materials such as cotton or rawhide, fabrics, foams, etc.), the mass of the material is often used as an indicator of the reactable surface area--i.e., one can specify an agent level in solution per unit weight of material being treated.
      <br/>
      For non-porous materials and/or materials which do not absorb the solvent being used (hard plastics, highly solvent-phobic materials), more direct knowledge of the reactable surface area is needed.
    </p>
    <p num="66">The preferred strongly-bonded agent for use in the present invention is 3-trimethoxysilylpropyldimethyloctadecyl ammonium chloride (as in Dow Corning 5700).</p>
    <p num="67">
      For use in mastication articles that contain fabrics, microbe-inhibiting fabrics can be constructed by weaving, knitting, or otherwise forming the fabric from fibers which possess the desired microbe-inhibiting properties.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, the fabrics can be post treated via spray-treating or by using a padding system such as are common in the art of textile finishing.
      <br/>
      For post treatment, tri-n-butyltin maleate (as in Ultra Fresh) is a preferred diffusing microbe-inhibiting agent (at fabric pick-up about 0.1%-0.5% by weight); and 3-trimethoxysilylpropyldimethyloctadecyl ammonium chloride (as in Dow Coming 5700) is a preferred strongly bonded microbe-inhibiting agent (at fabric pick-up about 0.08%-0.15% by weight).

      The preferred method for obtaining microbe-inhibiting foams is to include a microbe-inhibiting agent in the formulation of one of the foam precursors (i.e., before the material is foamed).
      <br/>
      A preferred microbe-inhibiting foam is obtained by adding Ultra Fresh DM-50 to the polyurethane foam formulation before foaming (typically in amounts ranging from 0.04% to 0.6% relative to the total weight of the formulation).
      <br/>
      Another preferred method is to use Dow Corning 5701 (a reactive silane quaternary ammonium compound, which works much like Dow Corning 5700).

      Another preferable microbe-inhibiting agent is known by the trade name, Intersept.

      It is a complex of polysubstituted imine salts and trialkyl phosphate esters with free alkylated phosphoric acid.
      <br/>
      It is relatively non-toxic; and it has been used as an antimicrobial finish on many building materials.
    </p>
    <p num="70">
      A further preferred type of microbe-inhibiting agent is typified by the MicroFree brand of particulates (available from DuPont).
      <br/>
      These particulates generally comprise a core particle (zinc oxide, titanium oxide, or barium sulfate) over which is coated a microbe-inhibiting active layer (silver, copper oxide, and/or zinc silicate).
      <br/>
      A barrier layer (to control the rate of release of the active component) and a dispersion coating (to facilitate dispersion of the particles in host materials) are included on top of the active layer.
      <br/>
      The particles range from about 0.3  MU m to 1  MU m in size.
      <br/>
      They can be incorporated into many resin systems for plastics processing, into the dope before fiber spinning, and into many coating systems for post-treatment.
      <br/>
      Good microbe-inhibiting efficacy can be imparted to various materials using these particles; and the resulting materials are generally non-toxic, very stable, and cost effective.

    <p num="72">Rawhide Mastication Articles</p>
    <p num="73">
      For rawhide mastication articles, microbe-inhibiting characteristics can be imparted to the rawhide by treating it with microbe-cidal agents as defined above during the process of manufacture.
      <br/>
      This treatment can be carried out during the liming or one of the cleaning phases; or an additional step can be added in which the hides are sprayed with or soaked in a microbe-cidal solution.
    </p>
    <p num="74">
      The rawhide can also be treated after it is essentially fully manufactured.
      <br/>
      In its "hard" form, it can be sprayed with a microbe-cidal solution (which can be allowed to soak-in), or it can be soaked in a microbe-cidal solution for a time sufficient for the microbe-cidal agents to infiltrate appreciably the rawhide.
      <br/>
      In the latter case, it will generally be necessary to dry the treated rawhide (in ambient air or in a furnace at elevated temperature).
    </p>
    <p num="75">It is necessary to ensure that the processing temperature, either during or after the microbe-inhibiting treatment, is not excessively high so as to inactivate or otherwise damage the microbe-inhibiting properties of the article.</p>
    <p num="76">
      Because dogs often eat rawhide, toxicity considerations are important.
      <br/>
      A preferred agent for use with rawhide products is chlorine dioxide, which is safe for both animal and human consumption (e.g., it is used in mouthwashes, toothpaste, and as a drinking-water additive).
      <br/>
      An appropriate solution concentration is in the range of about 0.1-2% by weight.
    </p>
    <p num="77">
      Also preferred is diiodomethyl-p-tolylsulphone.
      <br/>
      A commercially available form is available under the name Ultrafresh UF-95.
      <br/>
      It is generally desired to treat the rawhide so that the concentration of UF-95 is between 0.001% and 2%, preferably between 0.05% and 0.8% by weight.
      <br/>
      An alcohol, preferably ethanol, is the primary solvent of the preferred treatment solution.
      <br/>
      Acetone, in which the agent possesses a larger solubility than in ethanol, can also be used (provided the acetone does not persist substantially in the finished articles).
      <br/>
      When treating by soaking in such non-aqueous solutions, subsequent rinsing in an aqueous solution is preferred.

    <p num="78">
      Also preferred is tri-n-butyltin maleate.
      <br/>
      A commercially available form is available under the name Ultrafresh DM-50.
      <br/>
      Water is the primary solvent for the preferred treatment solution, which contains between 0.005%-0.4%, preferably 0.008%-0.1% by weight of the DM-50 agent.
    </p>
    <p num="79">
      Also preferred is triclosan.

      <br/>
      An alcohol, preferably ethanol, is the primary solvent of the preferred treatment solution.

      When treating by soaking in a triclosan solution, subsequent rinsing in an aqueous solution is preferred.
    </p>
    <p num="80">
      It is generally preferred to treat the rawhide during its manufacture, i.e., before the final drying step.
      <br/>
      In some cases, it is preferred to post-treat finished rawhide.
      <br/>
      First, one must "open-up" the rawhide structure.
      <br/>
      This is done by soaking the rawhide in water or other suitable non-toxic solvent (e.g., ethanol).
      <br/>
      The "opened" rawhide is then placed in the desired treatment solution for soaking.
      <br/>
      After sufficient time has elapsed for the rawhide to absorb an efficacious level of the microbe-inhibiting agent, it is removed from the treatment bath and dried.
      <br/>
      If the opening solvent and the treatment solvent are the same, one can combine the two steps (i.e., the treatment solution will serve also to open-up the rawhide).
    </p>
    <p num="81">
      Adding an amount (typically 0.1-20% by weight) of a soluble or dispersible polymer or organic material to the treatment solution can assist in the retention of the microbe-inhibiting agent in the rawhide.
      <br/>
      For example, one can incorporate many cellulose ether materials (e.g., methyl cellulose, hydroxyethyl cellulose, or carboxymethyl) or poly (vinyl alcohol) in water-based solvents.
      <br/>
      Starches, agar, gelatin, casein, lard, etc. can also be useful.
      <br/>
      Butyl cellulose, among others, is soluble in ethanol, a preferred solvent for triclosan and diiodomethyl-p-tolylsulphone.
      <br/>
      Preferred microbe-inhibiting agents to be used with retention-assisting ingredients are triclosan, diiodomethyl-p-tolylsulphone, and Ultra Fresh DM-50, and chlorine dioxide.
      <br/>
      When retention aids are used in this manner, one must ensure that both the retention aid and the microbe-inhibiting agent are sufficiently soluble or dispersible in the solvent.

    <p num="82">
      According to one embodiment of the invention mastication articles such as rawhide can be molded.
      <br/>
      Molded rawhide articles are formed by initially cutting or shredding conventional rawhide into small pieces.
      <br/>
      This process is often facilitated by first soaking the rawhide in a good solvent, such as water.
      <br/>
      It is often preferred to boil the rawhide in water before cutting it.
      <br/>
      The small pieces should then be dried.
    </p>
    <p num="83">These dried small pieces can then be admixed with additives designed to give the final product an improved "mouth feel." Casein, agar, gelatin, sugary syrups (e.g., honey) are examples; they are typically added in amounts less than about 10% by weight based on the weight of the final article.</p>
    <p num="84">
      The microbe-inhibiting agent is then added to this admixture.
      <br/>
      A preferred agent is triclosan, added in a quantity such that its concentration in the finished product is between 0.001% and 1%, preferably between 0.004% and 0.1% by weight.
      <br/>
      It is frequently preferable to dissolve the triclosan in a solvent before adding it to the mixture; the preferred solvent is ethanol.
      <br/>
      Diiodomethyl-p-tolylsulphone, as in UF-95, is also preferred.
      <br/>
      It should be added in a quantity such that its concentration in the finished product is between 0.001% and 2%, preferably between 0.01% and 0.8% by weight.
      <br/>
      It is sometimes preferable to dissolve the agent in a solvent before adding it to the mixture; the preferred solvent is either ethanol or acetone.
      <br/>
      Ultrafresh DM-50 is also preferred, added in a quantity such that its concentration in the finished product is between 0.001% and 1%, preferably between 0.004% and 0.1% by weight.

      It is frequently preferred that the DM-50 be carried in a solvent, preferably water.

    <p num="85">Chlorine dioxide dissolved in solvent is also preferred, added in a quantity such that its concentration in the finished product is between 0.0001% and 0.5%, preferably between 0.001% and 0.2% by weight.</p>
    <p num="86">
      The admixture is typically pre-heated to burn off a large part of the remaining solvents.
      <br/>
      The admixture is then fed into an injection molding machine under elevated temperature and pressure.
      <br/>
      It is desired that liquification occur.
      <br/>
      This generally requires pressures in excess of 60 atm and temperatures in excess of 120 (degree)  C. Pressures and temperatures in the environs of 75 atm and 145 (degree)  C., respectively, are preferred.
      <br/>
      Desired shapes are then molded.
    </p>
    <p num="87">
      Microbe-inhibiting molded rawhide can also be manufactured using other techniques.
      <br/>
      For example, one can obtain finely divided rawhide by boiling the rawhide; cutting it into small pieces; soaking the pieces in ethanol; drying the pieces in an oven; and grinding the rawhide in a coffee bean grinder.
      <br/>
      This finely divided rawhide can then be mixed with the desired microbe-inhibiting agent, a solvent, agar (or other degradable polymer), and optional flavoring additives.
      <br/>
      The mixture can be heated until it is quite thick, and then poured into a mold.
      <br/>
      Subsequent heating will further dry and congeal the product into a rawhide-based mastication article.
      <br/>
      Articles of this type, however, are generally much less tough than the injection-molded type.
    </p>
    <p num="88">
      It is also useful to provide a spray bottle or the like containing microbe-cidal solution which the pet owner can apply periodically to the rawhide to refresh its microbe-inhibiting properties.
      <br/>
      In this case, an aqueous solution of chlorine dioxide (with concentration about 0.083%) is preferred.
      <br/>
      Ethanol solutions, used with sufficiently low frequency and at sufficiently low concentrations so as not to affect adversely the animal, are also useful for this purpose.
      <br/>
      Other "natural anti-microbials" can also be used.

      Pets can derive pleasure from chewing them, and the pets can eventually digest them.
      <br/>
      Ideally, the articles are sufficiently dense and slow to absorb water that they retain their mechanical integrity and "chewability" for a significant period of time before they become very soft; and they exhibit a significant element of reversibility in characteristics upon drying.

    <p num="91">
      Such articles rarely comprise only starch, since pure starch tends to be brittle and is difficult to process.
      <br/>
      Starch is typically blended with other polymer materials and/or with materials that serve as plasticizers.
      <br/>
      Common polymer blending materials include poly-ethylene-acrylic acid or poly-ethylene-vinyl alcohol (see U.S. Pat. No. 5,419,283, which is hereby incorporated by reference).

      A shortcoming of prior mastication articles is that such digestible/degradable articles are extremely susceptible to the proliferation of microbes.

      Generally speaking, the anti-microbial agent(s) can be incorporated into the material(s) which will comprise the digestible/degradable mastication article when the material or blend of materials are in a molten or substantially dissolved state, or they can be incorporated into one or more of the constituent raw materials at the time of forming of these raw materials.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, the anti-microbial agent(s) can be mechanically mixed with the constituent raw material(s) before these materials are formed into the final article.
      <br/>
      In addition, the anti-microbial agent(s) can be included in a treatment solution to which the articles are exposed or to which the raw material is exposed prior to being used to form the articles.

      This agent possesses a broad spectrum of anti-microbial activity, and it is most active against fungi, yeasts, and algae.
      <br/>
      This agent is especially preferred in applications where the article may be partially or wholly digested or in cases where the article is in contact with materials which are to be digested.
      <br/>
      This agent can cause yellowing in the final material, and if this is deemed as unattractive, it may be used in conjunction with color suppressants.
      <br/>
      The agent melts at about 157 C. It is relatively insoluble in water (0.0001 g/l at 25 C).
      <br/>
      Acetone (350 g/l at 25 C) and ethanol (20 g/l at 25 C) are preferred solvents.
      <br/>
      The agent is generally stable in the pH range of 4-10.
      <br/>
      A preferred form of the agent is Ultrafresh UF-95, available from Thomas Research Associates.
      <br/>
      The concentration of UF 95 in the finished product should be between 0.001% to 3%, preferably between 0.01% and 1%. Another preferred synthetic agent for incorporation into articles possessing a digestible component is Irgasan DP300 (triclosan).
      <br/>
      It should be used in a quantity such that its average concentration in the finished product is between 0.001% and 1%, preferably between 0.004% and 0.1% by weight.
      <br/>
      Ethyl alcohol is a preferred solvent for triclosan.
      <br/>
      Ultrafresh NM-100 (available from Thomas Research Associates) is another preferred form of triclosan, added in a quantity such that its concentration in the finished product is between 0.001% and 2%, preferably between 0.004% and 0.3% by weight.
    </p>
    <p num="99">Triclosan melts at about 60 (degree)  C., and decomposes at about 285 (degree)  C. The fact that triclosan melts at 60 (degree)  C. facilitates the mixing of the triclosan with other raw materials, especially when such materials are in a powder form; and much flexibility in processing is achieved in the large window between melting and degradation.</p>
    <p num="100">
      Chlorine dioxide is also preferred, added in a quantity such that its concentration in the finished product is between 0.0001% and 0.5%, preferably between 0.001% and 0.2% by weight.
      <br/>
      Water is a preferred solvent.

      As noted earlier, in many cases, articles based on biodegradable materials, especially starch-based biodegradable materials, may be designed expressly as food items (in contrast to mastication articles that may be digestible or have a digestible component).
      <br/>
      In this case, the need for a microbe-inhibiting property is acute, since, in sharp contrast to human foods, people do not usually exercise the proper care to ensure that the articles are stored and transported properly before use.
      <br/>
      It is generally preferred in such cases to incorporate natural anti-microbial agents or food preservatives agents (or their oils) into mastication materials.
      <br/>
      These anti-microbial agents include garlic, turmeric, or other spices known to be inhospitable to microbes.
      <br/>
      Common food agents such as sugar and salt may be used to make the articles less susceptible to microbial proliferation.
      <br/>
      A variety of compatible preservatives and their properties are described in Disinfection, Sterilization, and Preservation, Edited by Seymour S. Block (Lea &amp; Feniger, 1991), which is herein incorporated by reference.
    </p>
    <p num="102">
      It is preferred to comminute these natural microbe-inhibiting materials to some degree before incorporation into the base material.
      <br/>
      It is further preferred to incorporate the natural antimicrobial materials into the raw material and then use the raw material in the usual manner to produce the articles.
    </p>
    <p num="103">
      Alternatively, one can include the comminuted material with the mix of other raw materials before molding the articles (e.g., add to the hopper before injection molding).
      <br/>
      Treatment may also be carried out by soaking, optionally under high pressure, the molded articles in a solution or broth containing the natural microbe-inhibiting materials.
    </p>
    <p num="104">
      In some cases (e.g., with garlic-based microbe-inhibiting agents), consumption by the animal can result in bothersome halitosis.
      <br/>
      If this is perceived as a problem, it is preferred to treat the natural microbe-inhibiting material in such a way as to derive an extract or broth which possesses the desired microbe-inhibiting quality but does not cause halitosis.
      <br/>
      Since many natural anti-microbial materials are believed to possess therapeutic properties for humans, there are many known methods to produce such extracts (e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,391,390, which is herein incorporated by reference).
    </p>
    <p num="105">
      Natural anti-microbial agents are often perceived by people in a more favorable light because they are "natural." In addition, they can also be preferred because they are frequently, at least in part, water soluble.
      <br/>
      This property facilitates incorporation of these materials into many biodegradable materials, such as the starch-based materials, which possess a significant degree of solubility with respect to water (in contrast to triclosan or diiodomethyl-p-tolylsulphone, which are not readily soluble in water).
      <br/>
      It is often preferable to use a biodegradable material--microbe-inhibiting agent combination which possess a common solvent).

      Although articles constructed from many polymers containing a digestible component, such as those based on Mater-Bi, are in fact digestible, they may not provide sufficient enticement for the pet to chew on them.
      <br/>
      For this reason, it is preferred to add enticing additives, such as flavorings or scents, to the articles.
      <br/>
      For example, an amount of catnip or catnip oil can entice a cat to chew or otherwise be attracted to the article.
      <br/>
      Comminuted catnip, for example, can be added to the hopper with the raw materials.
    </p>
    <p num="107">
      Similarly, a fish scent or fish-flavored additive may encourage the cat to chew on the article.
      <br/>
      Meat scents or flavorings are particularly attractive for dogs.
    </p>
    <p num="108">
      It is further desirable to incorporate components into the chewing articles which impart a therapeutic quality.
      <br/>
      For example, various vitamins, minerals, breath-freshening agents, and therapeutic herbs can advantageously be incorporated into the articles.
      <br/>
      To maintain the efficacy of these agents, however, it is important to ensure that processing temperatures subsequent to the incorporation of the relevant agents do not exceed the degradation temperatures of the active component of the agents.
    </p>
    <p num="109">
      Collagen and/or gelatin derived materials are also very attractive for forming degradable/digestible chewing articles.
      <br/>
      These may be used as the primary ingredient in the article or they can be blended with starch-based materials.
      <br/>
      The resulting materials can be made to possess microbe-inhibiting properties by methods described herein.

    <p num="111">Rope-Based Mastication Articles</p>
    <p num="112">Cotton is a highly absorbent material and is particularly attractive for constructing rope-based mastication articles; but when cotton becomes wet with saliva, it tends to dry relatively slowly, which can lead to bacteria growth.</p>

      A preferred process for treating cotton rope-based mastication articles for pets, or for treating rope-based mastication articles for pets in which cotton is a major component, is to soak the rope material in a solution containing Ultra Fresh DM-50.
      <br/>
      It is generally desired to treat the rope in an aqueous solution so that the content of the agent in the rope is about 0.03%-1.2%, preferably between 0.08% and 0.6% by weight.

    <p num="120">
      It is generally preferred to that the treatment occur at an elevated temperature, typically between 40-100 (degree)  Celsius.
      <br/>
      If a temperature higher than the boiling temperature of the primary solvent is used, however, increased pressured must be used.
      <br/>
      For example, the articles can be treated in an aqueous solution at temperatures exceeding 100 (degree)  C. if an autoclave or pressure cooker is used.

    <p num="121">
      Adding an amount (typically 0.1-20% by weight) of a soluble or dispersable polymer or organic material to the treatment solution can assist in the retention of the microbe-inhibiting agent in the rope-material and is preferred.

      Starches, agar, gelatin, casein, lard, etc. can also be useful.
      <br/>
      Butyl cellulose is an example of a polymer which is soluble in ethanol, a preferred solvent for triclosan.
      <br/>
      Preferred microbe-inhibiting agents to be used with retention-assisting ingredients are triclosan, diiodomethyl-p-tolylsulphone, Ultra Fresh DM-50, and chlorine dioxide.

      Another preferred method for constructing a microbe-inhibiting cotton-rope-based mastication article is to spray with or otherwise expose the individual filaments or threads to the microbe-inhibiting agent (either in solution or carrier form) as the rope is being formed.
      <br/>
      In order to expand the threads and make them more open to the introduction of the microbe-inhibiting agents, it is preferable to expose the threads to moisture before the microbe-inhibiting agents are introduced.

    <p num="130">Plastic Mastication Articles</p>
    <p num="131">
      Plastic-based mastication articles for pets are becoming increasingly popular.
      <br/>
      Except in some cases where degradable polymers are used, plastic-based mastication articles are not intended for digestion.
      <br/>
      Many non-digestible plastics possess a moderate natural microbe-starving quality--they provide little or no nutritive material for microbes to digest or metabolize and thereby thrive.
      <br/>
      Even with these articles, however, saliva and other fluids or materials deposit on the articles and provide nutrition for the proliferation of microbes.
      <br/>
      In addition, many plasticizers which are often used to increase flexibility in the final plastic article or to facilitate processing are readily digestible by microbes as described further below.
    </p>
    <p num="132">
      A greater source of nutrition in plastic-based mastication articles for pets relates to the methods by which the articles are made desirable to pets.
      <br/>
      Plastics are generally not particularly attractive to pets, especially those plastics that possess good natural microbe-starving characteristics.
      <br/>
      For this reason, animal meal, sugar, and similar attractive elements have been incorporated into such plastic-based mastication articles to make them more attractive for pets.
      <br/>
      Because these elements are also digestible by microbes, however, the natural microbe-starving characteristics which the articles may have possessed can become ineffectual.
    </p>
    <p num="133">According to one aspect of the invention, plastic-based mastication articles possess effective protection against the proliferation of microbes, even when digestible elements intended to make the articles more attractive for pets have been incorporated into the articles.</p>
    <p num="134">
      Plastic mastication articles for pets are frequently made by molding (e.g., injection molding, blow molding), or dipping processes known in the plastics fabrication art.
      <br/>
      Thermoplastic resins are typically used for injection molding and latex solutions are typically used for the dipping processes.
    </p>
    <p num="135">
      For articles constructed by molding processes, it is preferred first to incorporate the agent in a concentrated form into a resin carrier. U.S. Pat. No. 4,789,692, which is herein incorporated by reference, discloses numerous means for concentrating biocides in resin carriers.
      <br/>
      The resin carrier is then mixed or diluted in the appropriate ratio with the resin(s) with which it will comprise the final article, and the blend is processed, preferably by injection molding, into the desired shape.
      <br/>
      It is crucial to ensure that the resin mix is well-blended.
      <br/>
      The mixing or dilution factor is given by the ratio of the concentration of the agent in the concentrate to the desired final concentration in the article.
      <br/>
      For example, if the concentrated carrier contained 2% of the agent, and the desired final concentration was 0.2%, the mixing or dilution factor would be 2%/0.2%=10, e.g., the final mix would contain 1 part in 10 of the concentrated carrier.
    </p>
    <p num="136">
      Diiodomethyl-p-tolylsulphone is a preferred agent.
      <br/>
      It is preferred to incorporate UF-95 into the concentrated resin fraction such that the concentration in the final article is between 0.001% to 3%, preferably between 0.01% and 1%. The preferred concentration of UF-95 in the concentrated resin depends on the polymer or polymers comprising the resin, but is generally between 0.5% and 15%, preferably between 1% and 9%.
    </p>
    <p num="137">
      Preferred plastic materials for the articles according to the invention, alone or in combination, are nylon and polyurethane, although many other types of plastics, e.g., polyolefins, are suitable as well.
      <br/>
      It is generally preferred to use thermoplastics.
    </p>
    <p num="138">
      Another preferred microbe-inhibiting agent is 2,4,4'-trichloro-2'-hydroxydiphenol (triclosan).
      <br/>
      The microbe-inhibiting resin fraction is added to the base material resin in an amount such that the concentration of the agent in the final product is between 0.001% and 1.5%, preferably between 0.004% and 0.7% by weight.
      <br/>
      The preferred concentration of triclosan in the concentrated resin depends on the polymer or polymers comprising the resin, but is generally between 0.5% and 15%, preferably between 1% and 9%.

      In latex processing, the microbe-inhibiting agent is in powder or liquid form or suitably and is incorporated into a solid or liquid carrier that is preferably added to the latex mixture before molding.
      <br/>
      Preferred microbe-inhibiting agents are triclosan, diiodomethyl-p-tolylsulphone, tri-n-butylin maleate, and chlorine dioxide.
    </p>
    <p num="141">
      2,4,4'-trichloro-2'-hydroxydiphenol can also be obtained in a crystalline powder form (e.g., from TRInternational, Inc.), and the powder can be added to the article forming composition.
      <br/>
      For example, the powder can be added directly to the latex mixture.
      <br/>
      It can also be incorporated directly into the molten form of many thermoplastics.
      <br/>
      In the latter case, however, appropriate mixing should be carried out to ensure homogeneity.
    </p>
    <p num="142">
      Other desirable ingredients, such as meat broths, ground-up dried meat products, etc., can be added to the plastic-based mastication articles to impart a desirable flavor or scent.
      <br/>
      The addition of such ingredients can, however, negate the natural microbe-starving quality of these base polymer materials.
      <br/>
      Unfortunately, ingredients which are likely to make the make the article more attractive to pets are generally of a digestible nature (meat-based products, sugars, etc.), and are therefore likely to provide nutrition for the proliferation of microbes.
      <br/>
      This fundamental trade-off is circumvented by the invention.
      <br/>
      According to the invention, plastics-based mastication articles with such flavoring ingredients include a microbe-inhibiting agent in the resin mix or the precursor solution of the base plastic material.
      <br/>
      The preferred concentrations and related considerations given above apply.
    </p>
    <p num="143">
      A preferred method for constructing plastics-based mastication articles with such flavoring ingredients is to pre-treat the flavoring ingredients themselves with microbe-inhibiting agents.
      <br/>
      These pre-treatments can be done alone or in combination with adding microbe-inhibiting agent to the base plastic material.
    </p>

      If one is incorporating a solid or solid-like flavoring ingredient into a resin or melt mixture, it is preferred to soak the flavoring ingredients in a solution containing one or more microbe-inhibiting agents before incorporating the ingredients intro the resin or melt mixture.

      The ingredients should be dried before incorporation into the resin or melt mixture.

      The microbe-starving quality of some synthetic polymers is often unintentionally destroyed by processing with a plasticizer which contains nutritive elements which can support microbial proliferation.

      The plasticizers used in processing many polymers are digestible and/or degradable by microbes.
      <br/>
      If a plasticizer is to be used in processing materials used for constructing a mastication article for a pet, it is preferred to choose a plasticizer that does not diminish the natural microbe-starving and/or microbe-impenetrable property of the polymer.

      Plasticizers that are particularly resistant to fungal growth include: Abietic acid; hydrog. methyl abietate; tri-n-butyl aconitate; triethyl aconitate; di-(2-ethylhexyl)adipate; di-(2-ethylhexyl)acetate; ethyl-o-benzyl benzoate; chlorinated diphenyls; chlorinated paraffins; tri-n-butyl citrate; triethyl citrate; 2-nitro-2 methyl-1,3-propanediol diacetate; dimethyl phthalate; di-n-propyl phthalate; diisopropyl phthalate; dibutyl phthalate; diisobutyl phthalate; diisodecyl phthalate; dihexyl phthalate; dicapryl phthalate; di-(2 ethylhexel) phthalate; di-(2 ethylhexyl) phthalate; dicyclohexyl phthalate; dicyclohexyl phthalate; and dibenzyl phthalate.
    </p>
    <p num="151">Other Types of Plastic Articles</p>
    <p num="152">
      Plastics articles to be used for purposes other than as mastication articles for pets can be made with a microbe-inhibiting agent according to the invention.
      <br/>
      Particularly desirable are feeding bowls, litter boxes, and scoopers (e.g., for food, feces, used litter).
      <br/>
      It is preferred first to incorporate the microbe inhibiting agent in a concentrated form into a resin carrier. U.S. Pat. No. 4,789,692, which is herein incorporated by reference, discloses numerous techniques for concentrating biocides in resin carriers.
      <br/>
      The resin carrier is then mixed or diluted in an appropriate ratio with the resin(s) which will be used in the final article, and the blend is processed, preferably by injection molding, into the desired shape.
      <br/>
      The mixing or dilution factor is given by the ratio of the concentration by weight of the microbe-inhibiting agent in the resin carrier to the desired final concentration by weight in the article.
      <br/>
      For example, if the concentrated carrier contained 2% of the microbe-inhibiting agent by weight, and the desired final concentration was 0.2% by weight, the mixing or dilution factor would be 2%/0.2%=10, e.g., the final mix would contain 1 part in 10 of the concentrated carrier.
    </p>
    <p num="153">
      For bowls or other food-contacting products, diiodomethyl-p-tolylsulphone is the preferred microbe-inhibiting agent.
      <br/>
      It is specifically preferred to incorporate UF-95 into the concentrated resin fraction such that the concentration in the final article is between 0.001% to 3%, preferably between 0.01% and 0.1%. The preferred concentration of UF-95 in the concentrated resin depends on the polymer or polymers comprising the resin, but is generally between 0.5% and 15%, preferably between 1% and 9%.
    </p>
    <p num="154">The primary material comprising the bowl is preferably polypropylene, polyethylene, although many thermoplastic polymers are adequate.</p>
    <p num="155">
      Triclosan is also preferred for bowls in cases where anti-mildew and anti-mold properties are not essential.
      <br/>
      Using triclosan, it is preferred to incorporate the agent into a resin concentrate which is then blended with other resin to produce the final article via injection molding.
      <br/>
      It is preferred to incorporate UF-95 into the concentrated resin fraction such that the concentration in the final article is between 0.001% to 3%, preferably between 0.01% and 1%. The preferred concentration of triclosan in the concentrated resin depends on the polymer or polymers comprising the resin, but is generally between 0.5% and 15%, preferably between 1% and 9%.
    </p>
    <p num="156">
      For litter boxes and scoopers which will contact feces or other bodily waste, tri-n-butylin maleate is the preferred microbe-inhibiting agent.
      <br/>
      A commercial form, Ultrafresh DM-50, is specifically preferred.
      <br/>
      It is preferred to incorporate DM-50 into the concentrated resin fraction such that the concentration in the final article is between 0.005% to 4% by weight, preferably between 0.04% and 2%. The preferred concentration of DM-50 in the concentrated resin depends on the polymer or polymers in the resin blend, but is generally between 0.5% and 15%, preferably between 1% and 9% by weight.
    </p>
    <p num="157">
      Diiodomethyl-p-tolylsulphone is also a preferred microbe-inhibiting agent.
      <br/>
      It is preferred to incorporate UF-95 into the concentrated resin fraction such that the concentration in the final article is between 0.005% to 4%, preferably between 0.05% and 2%. By weight The preferred concentration of UF-95 in the concentrated resin depends on the polymer or polymers comprising the resin, but is generally between 0.5% and 15%, preferably between 1% and 9% by weight.

    <p num="158">Combs and other grooming aids can similarly be manufactured according to the invention.</p>
    <p num="159">Mastication Articles with Porosity</p>
    <p num="160">
      It is sometimes desirable, especially for animals that do not have powerful jaws (such as small dogs, cats, and rodents), to have a substantial porosity in the mastication articles according to the invention.
      <br/>
      In such cases, the articles can be made porous with well-known foaming techniques as disclosed, for example, in U.S. Pat. No. 5,360,830, which is herein incorporated by reference.
