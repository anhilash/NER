      A switching power supply apparatus is provided with a series circuit comprising a first switching section and a second switching section that repeat on/off operation complementarily, and a series circuit comprising a third switching section and a fourth switching section that repeat on/off operation complementarily, both series circuits are connected across an input power supply.
      <br/>
      A transformer includes a primary winding and secondary windings, and the primary winding is bridge-connected to the above-mentioned switching sections.
      <br/>
      The switching power supply apparatus is further provided with fifth and sixth switching sections that turn on/off in synchronization with the operation of the second and fourth switching sections, respectively to rectify the voltages generating at the secondary windings of the transformer.
      <br/>
      The second switching section and the fourth switching section are controlled to short-circuit the transformer in a period during which both the first switching section and the second switching section are off.

    <heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="1">The present invention relates to a switching power supply apparatus for supplying a stabilized DC voltage to industrial and consumer-oriented electronic apparatuses.</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">
      In recent years, switching power supply apparatuses have been required to be more compact, efficient and reliable as electronic apparatuses in which switching power supply apparatuses become less expensive, more compact, higher in performance and more energy-efficient.
      <br/>
      A switching power supply apparatus basically comprises an inverter that turns on and off an input DC voltage at a high frequency to covert it into a high-frequency AC voltage, a transformer for converting AC currents and voltages and for keeping insulation between input and output, and a rectifying and smoothing circuit for converting an alternating current into a direct current.
      <br/>
      The output voltage is regulated by changing the on/off ratios of the switching devices in the switching sections of the inverter section.
      <br/>
      Since the transformer is driven at a high frequency, it can be made compact.
      <br/>
      In addition, the transformer has an extremely low loss because of on/off operation.
      <br/>
      For these reasons, the switching power supply apparatus is characterized to be made compact and highly efficient.
    </p>
    <p num="3">
      However, in reality, there is no ideal switching device.
      <br/>
      In a semiconductor switch used in a switching section or a rectifying circuit, an on-voltage occurs due to the resistance of the semiconductor switch at its on-period, thereby causing a loss.
      <br/>
      Since a high-speed on/off characteristic is usually required for a rectifying and smoothing circuit in particular, high-speed diodes are used for the circuit.
      <br/>
      However, the high-speed diode has the disadvantage of requiring a particularly high on-voltage, thereby reducing efficiency.
      <br/>
      In recent years, MOS FETs have been improved greatly in performance, and attempts have been made to improve their efficiency by using such MOS FETs as rectifying devices and by carrying out synchronous rectification described below.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      Half-bridge-type and full-bridge-type circuits have been used for high-power switching power supply apparatuses.
      <br/>
      FIG. 6 shows a circuit diagram of a conventional example of a switching power supply apparatus comprising a combination of a full-bridge converter and synchronous rectifying devices.
      <br/>
      Referring to FIG. 6, the voltage value of an input DC power supply 1 is assumed to be "Vin".
      <br/>
      A series circuit comprising a first switching section 69 and a second switching section 70 is connected across input terminals 2a and 2b.

      When the first switching section 69 and the fourth switching section 72 are turned on by the on/off signals of the first high side driving circuit 78 and the second driving circuit 79, respectively at time t0, the input voltage Vin is applied to the primary winding 73a of the transformer 73.
      <br/>
      When the voltage Vin is applied to the primary winding 73a of the transformer 73, voltages are induced at the windings of the transformer 73.
      <br/>
      A positive voltage Vin/N*N' is generated at the first driving winding 73d.
      <br/>
      By properly selecting a value N', the fifth switching section 76 can be turned on.
      <br/>
      The voltage Vin/N induced at the first secondary winding 73b is applied to the series circuit of the inductance device 16 and the smoothing capacitor 17 via the fifth switching section 76 having been turned on.
      <br/>
      Since the current flowing through the inductance device 16 flows through the secondary winding 73b, a current flows through the primary winding 73a.
      <br/>
      Since the fifth switching section 76 has been selected to turn on at a sufficiently low voltage, no current flows thorough the first rectifying diode 74 connected in parallel therewith.
      <br/>
      The current flows through the fifth switching section 76 used as a synchronous rectifying device, whereby the rectifying diode 74 can have a lower rectifying loss.

    <p num="11">
      When the first switching section 69 and the fourth switching section 72 are turned off by the off-signals of the first high side driving circuit 78 and the second driving circuit 79, respectively at time t1, the current Ip at the primary winding of the transformer 73 becomes zero.
      <br/>
      At this time, a turn-off surge voltage is generated by the energy stored in the leak inductance parasitically existing in the transformer 73, and this causes a loss.
      <br/>
      In addition, when the second rectifying diode 75 turns on, the current flowing through the inductance device 16 is divided and flows through the first secondary winding 73b and the second secondary winding 73c of the transformer 73 because of the continuity of the magnetic flux at the transformer 73.
      <br/>
      At this time, the secondary windings 73b and 73c of the transformer 73 are short-circuited by the first rectifying diode 74 and the second rectifying diode 75 having been turned on, whereby the voltages induced at the windings of the transformer 73 become zero.

      Voltages depending on the turn ratio are induced at the windings of the transformer 73.
      <br/>
      A positive voltage generates at the second driving winding 73e of the transformer 73 and turns on the sixth switching section 77.
      <br/>
      At the first secondary winding 73b of the transformer 73, a voltage -Vin/N generates and turns on the first rectifying diode 74.
      <br/>
      The voltage generated at the second secondary winding 73c of the transformer 73 is applied to the series circuit of the inductance device 16 and the smoothing capacitor 17 via the sixth switching section 77 having been turned on.

      Hereafter, the same operation as that described above is repeated in the next half period.
    </p>
    <p num="13">
      The output voltage is controlled as described below.
      <br/>
      The on-periods of the first switching section 69 and the fourth switching section 72 are made equal to the on-period of the second switching section 70 and the third switching section 71, and is set at Ton (=t1-t0=t3-t2).
      <br/>
      The off-period thereof is set at Toff (=t2-t1=t4-t3).
      <br/>
      When a period Ts is assumed to be Ts=Ton+Toff, since the average of the voltage applied to the inductance device 16 becomes zero in the steady state, the output voltage Vout is represented by Vout (=1/N (Ton/Ts)).
      <br/>
      Therefore, the output voltage can be controlled by changing the on/off ratios of the switching sections.
    </p>
    <p num="14">
      This control can turn on the fifth switching section 76 and the sixth switching section 77, which carry out synchronous rectification only in the period when a voltage is applied to the transformer 73, whereby voltage drop can be reduced and efficiency can be improved.
      <br/>
      In addition, when no voltage is generated at the first secondary winding 73b and the second secondary winding 73c of the transformer 73, the fifth switching section 76 and the sixth switching section 77 remain off.
      <br/>
      Therefore, no short-circuit current flows at the moment when a voltage is applied to the primary winding 73a of the transformer 73.

      In the above-mentioned descriptions, a full-bridge converter has been taken as an example to explain.
      <br/>
      However, the above-mentioned operation can also be applied similarly to synchronous rectifying switching power supply apparatuses using half-bridge converters and push-pull converters.
    </p>
    <p num="16">
      In the above-mentioned conventional configuration, however, the fifth switching section 76 and the sixth switching section 77, synchronous rectifying devices, cannot be driven in the period when no voltage is generated at the transformer 73.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, currents flow through the first rectifying diode 74 and the second rectifying diode 75 in this period, thereby causing a problem of increasing a loss.
      <br/>
      Therefore, if a control is carried out so that the input voltage rises and the on-periods of the first to fourth switching sections 69, 70, 71 and 72 are shortened, the periods during which currents flow through the fifth switching section 76 and the sixth switching section 77 shorten for carrying out synchronous rectification.
      <br/>
      As a result, this causes a problem of reducing the effect of synchronous rectification.
      <br/>
      In the same way, even if the on/off signals to be applied to the first to fourth switching sections 69, 70, 71 and 72 are used, the fifth switching section 76 and the sixth switching section 77 cannot be turned on when the first to fourth switching section 69 to 72 are off.

      Generally speaking, when a MOS FET is used as a synchronous rectifying device, the body diode built in the MOS FET is used frequently as a rectifying diode.
      <br/>
      However, since the body diode turns on at a higher voltage, the effect of the synchronous rectification is reduced further.
      <br/>
      In addition, if it is turned on forcibly when no voltage is generated at the transformer 73, even if the switching devices on the primary side turn on and a voltage is applied to the transformer 73, a short-circuit condition is maintained until voltages are generated at the secondary windings of the transformer 73.
      <br/>
      This causes a problem of flowing an excessively large current.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, at the turn-on time of each switching section, a capacitor parasitically existing across the switching section is short-circuited.
      <br/>
      As a result, the energy stored in this capacitor causes a loss, and a surge-like short-circuit current causes noise and reduces reliability.
      <br/>
      Moreover, at the turn-off time of the switching section, the energy stored in the leak inductance of the transformer 73 causes resonance at the capacitor parasitically existing at the switching section, thereby also causing problems of occurrence of a loss and low reliability.

    <p num="18">Accordingly, an object of the present invention is to provide a highly efficient, reliable switching power supply apparatus.</p>
    <heading>BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="19">
      A switching power supply apparatus in accordance with the present invention comprises: a series circuit connected to an input power supply and comprising a first switching section and a second switching section which repeat on/off operation complementarily and have a very short rest period during which both the switching sections are off; a series circuit connected to the input power supply and comprising a third switching section and a fourth switching section that repeat on/off operation complementarily and have a very short rest period during which both the switching sections are off; and a transformer having a primary winding and also having a first secondary winding and a second secondary winding connected in series with each other, the primary winding of the transformer being connected between the connection point of the first switching section and the second switching section and the connection point of the third switching section and the fourth switching section.
      <br/>
      The switching power supply apparatus further comprises: a fifth switching section that turns on/off in synchronization with the operation of the second switching section to rectify the voltage generated at the first secondary winding of the transformer; a sixth switching section that turns on/off in synchronization with the operation of the fourth switching section to rectify the voltage generated at the second secondary winding; a smoothing circuit for smoothing the rectified voltage; a control section for controlling an output voltage by controlling the on/off ratio of the first switching section and the on/off ratio of the third switching section; and a control section for turning on the second switching section and the fourth switching section in order to short-circuit the primary winding of the transformer in a period during which both the first switching section and the second switching section are off except for the very short rest period.
    </p>
    <p num="20">
      According to the present invention, MOS FETs are used as switching devices for synchronous rectification.
      <br/>
      Since the MOS FET includes a diode, the voltage generated at the on-time of the MOS FET is reduced significantly by virtue of this diode.
      <br/>
      As a result, the efficiency of the power supply apparatus can be improved significantly.
      <br/>
      In addition, since each switching device performs zero-voltage switching, the energy loss does not occur at the turn-on time due to the short circuit of a parasitic capacitor, whereby it is possible to configure a highly efficient switching power supply apparatus causing less noise.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, the second switching device and the sixth switching device can be turned on/off at the same timing, and the fourth switching device and the fifth switching device can also be turned on/off at the same timing, whereby the control circuits can be configured simply.

      When the first switching element 3 turns off at time t1, the current flowing through the primary winding 11a of the transformer 11 continuously flows because of a leak inductance.

      As a result, the applied voltage of the first switching section 3a rises, and the voltage of the second switching section 5a lowers, whereby the voltage of the primary winding 11a of the transformer 11 lowers.

      When the voltage of the primary winding 11a becomes zero, the second diode 6 turns on.

      A rest period during which both the first switching element 3 and the second switching element 5 are off is set so that the second switching element 5 turns on while the second diode 6 is on.

      When the primary winding 11a is short-circuited, the energy stored in the leak inductance of the transformer 11 is retained, whereby the current Ip flowing through the primary winding 11a is kept constant.

      At this time, the voltages generating at the secondary windings 11b and 11c become zero.

      The sixth switching element 15 also turns on at time t2.

      The current flowing through the inductance device 16 continuously flows through the first secondary winding 11b via the fifth switching element 14.

      To flow the discharge current of the parasitic capacitor existing in parallel with the sixth switching element 15 to the second secondary winding 11c, the current of the first secondary winding 11b decreases, and the current of the primary winding 11a also decreases simultaneously.

      After the sixth switching element 15 turns on, the current flowing through the second secondary winding 11c continuously flows through the sixth switching element 15.

      Therefore, the currents of all the windings of the transformer 11 remain unchanged.
      <br/>
      The capacitors parasitically existing in parallel with the third switching section 7a and the fourth switching section 9a are discharged and charged, respectively by the current Ip of the primary winding 11a of the transformer 11.

      As a result, the applied voltage of the fourth switching section 9a rises, and the applied voltage of the third switching section 7a lowers, and the voltage Vp applied to the primary winding 11a lowers.
      <br/>
      When the applied voltage of the third switching section 7a becomes zero, the third diode 8 turns on, and the voltage to be applied to the third switching section 7a is retained at zero.

      A period during which both the third switching element 7 and the fourth switching element 9 are off is set so that the third switching element 7 turns on when the applied voltage of the third switching section 7a is zero.

      As a result, the input voltage Vin is applied to the primary winding 11a in the opposite direction.
    </p>
    <p num="37">
      Since a voltage -Vin/N is generated at the first and second secondary windings 11b and 11c, the current flowing through the second secondary winding 11c increases abruptly, and the current flowing through the first secondary winding 11b decreases abruptly.

      When the current flowing through the first secondary winding 11b becomes zero, the current flowing through the first rectifying diode 12 becomes zero and thereby turns off.

      The use of MOS FETs is recommendable for the switching elements 14 and 15 of the synchronous rectification.
      <br/>
      Since the MOS FET includes a diode therein, the voltage generated at the on-time of the MOS FET semiconductor device is far lower than that in the case of a high-speed rectifying diode.
      <br/>
      In the present embodiment, the periods during which currents flow through the first rectifying diode 12 and the second rectifying diode 13 become short, whereby the effect of synchronous rectification is enhanced.
      <br/>
      The turn-off timing of the fifth switching element 14 is made identical to that of the fourth switching element 9.
      <br/>
      However, the turn-off timing of the first rectifying diode 12 is delayed further due to the influence of the leak induction of the transformer as a load current is larger.
      <br/>
      Therefore, when the turn-off timing of the fifth switching element 14 is delayed depending on the load current, the conduction period of the first rectifying diode 12 can be shortened, whereby it is needless to say that the effect of improving the efficiency is enhanced.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, even if the diodes built in the MOS FETs are used instead of the rectifying diodes 12 and 13, the efficiency is hardly lowered, whereby the efficiency of the power supply apparatus can be improved significantly.
      <br/>
      In addition, since the switching elements 3, 5, 7 and 9 perform zero-voltage switching, the energy loss does not occur at the turn-on time due to the short circuit of the parasitic capacitors.
      <br/>
      Moreover, the energy stored in the leak inductance of the transformer is maintained by the short circuit of the coils of the transformer and effectively used for zero-voltage switching.
      <br/>
      Therefore, no wasteful energy loss occurs, whereby it is possible to configure a highly efficient switching power supply apparatus.
      <br/>
      Besides, in the present configuration, the second switching element 5 and the sixth switching element 15 can be turned on/off at the same timing, and the fourth switching element 9 and the fifth switching element 14 can be turned on/off at the same timing, whereby the control circuits can be configured simply.
      <br/>
      The rest period T is not required to be the same at all times, but may have a different value for each switching device.

      <br/>
      The electrostatic capacitance of the smoothing capacitor 17 is sufficiently large, whereby a stabilized output voltage Vout is output across the output terminals 18a and 18b.
      <br/>
      A load 19 is connected across the output terminals 18a and 18b, and consumes electric power.
      <br/>
      The two input terminals of a PWM circuit 20 are connected to the output terminals 18a and 18b, respectively, and the PWM circuit 20 compares the output voltage Vout with its internal reference voltage.
      <br/>
      Depending on the error amplification signal obtained as the result of the comparison, the PWM circuit 20 generates a PWM signal and applies the signal to a distribution circuit 21.
    </p>
    <p num="61">
      The distribution circuit 21 alternately distributes and outputs the PWM signal to two outputs.
      <br/>
      A first inverter 22 and a second inverter 23 invert the two output signals of the distribution circuit 21, respectively, and output the signals as a first inverter output and a second inverter output, respectively.
      <br/>
      A first high side driving circuit 24 and a second high side driving circuit 25 are formed of a semiconductor device or a driving transformer, and generate signals for turning on/off the first switching element 3 and the third switching element 7 depending on the output of the distribution circuit 21.
      <br/>
      A first driving circuit 26 and a second driving circuit 27 generate signals for turning on/off the second switching element 5 and the fourth switching element 9 depending on the outputs of the second and first inverters 23 and 22, respectively.
      <br/>
      A first insulated driving-circuit 67 insulated by a transformer or the like generates on/off signals for driving the fifth switching device 63 and the sixth switching device 64 at the same timing depending on the output of the first inverter 22.
    </p>
    <p num="62">
      A second insulated driving-circuit 68 insulated by a transformer or the like generates on/off signals for driving the seventh switching device 65 and the eighth switching device 66 at the same timing depending on the output of the first inverter 23.
      <br/>
      The on signals output from the first high side driving circuit 24, the second high side driving circuit 25, the first driving circuit 26, the second driving circuit 27, the first insulated driving-circuit 67 and the second insulated driving-circuit 68 have a delay time required for attaining zero-voltage switching described later.
      <br/>
      This generates a very short rest period T during which each switching device is off.
    </p>
    <p num="63">
      Referring to FIG. 5, the present embodiment is characterized in that the transformer has one secondary winding, and that the synchronous rectifying circuit comprises four switching devices.
      <br/>
      The operation of the present embodiment will be described below.
      <br/>
      When the first switching section 3a and the fourth switching section 9a turn on, the fifth switching device 63 and the sixth switching device 64 are turned on by the voltage generating at the secondary winding 58b.
      <br/>
      In addition, when the second switching section 5a and the third switching section 7a turn on, the seventh switching device 65 and the eighth switching device 66 are turned on.
      <br/>
      When the second switching section 5a and the fourth switching section 9a turn on, the fifth switching device 63, the sixth switching device 64, the seventh switching device 65 and the eighth switching 66 are controlled to turn on.
      <br/>
      Except for the above-mentioned operation for rectifying the voltage generating at the secondary winding 58b of the transformer 58, the operation of the present embodiment is the same as that of the circuit of the first embodiment shown in FIG. 1, and the descriptions of the operation are omitted.
    </p>
    <p num="64">
      The present embodiment can also offer the effect of synchronous rectification, and does not cause any loss due to the short circuit of the parasitic capacitor existing in parallel with each switching device.
      <br/>
      In addition, the energy stored in the leak inductance of the transformer can be used effectively.
      <br/>
      For this reason, the efficiency of the power supply apparatus can be improved significantly.
      <br/>
      The second switching element 5, the seventh switching device 65 and the eighth switching device 66 can be turned on at the same timing, and the fourth switching element 9, the fifth witching device 63 and the sixth switching device 64 can also be turned on at the same timing, whereby the control circuits can be configured simply.
      <br/>
      A full-bridge-type rectifying circuit is taken as an example and explained in the above-mentioned descriptions.
      <br/>
      However, even if the rectifying circuit is a half-bridge type or a push-pull type, that is, even if the rectifying circuits shown in FIG. 3 and FIG. 4 have the same configuration as that of the rectifying circuit shown in FIG. 5, the operation is substantially the same.
