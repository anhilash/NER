    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="1">
      The present invention relates to the field of delivery services.
      <br/>
      More particularly, this invention relates to a means and method for hanging a load chart on a delivery vehicle.
    </p>
    <p num="2">
      In the field of delivery services, it is common for delivery persons to use a clipboard or a load chart when loading, unloading and organizing the contents of the vehicle to ensure efficient delivery.
      <br/>
      Various delivery papers are conventionally held on the load chart.
      <br/>
      It is desirable for the load chart to be detachably mounted to the vehicle, but existing methods typically allow the load chart to scratch the vehicle.
      <br/>
      Thus, there is a need to hang a detachable load chart from a delivery vehicle without damaging the vehicle or marring its paint job.

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading>
    <p num="10">
      In FIG. 1, the rear corner of a medium-sized delivery vehicle 10 is shown.
      <br/>
      The vehicle 10 has a side wall 12, a rear wall 14, and a roof 16.
      <br/>
      A door 17 is typically provided in the rear wall 14.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, a drip rail or rain gutter 18 extends in a substantially horizontal direction at the intersection of the side wall 12 and the roof 16.
      <br/>
      A similar drip rail 18 can be provided above the door 17.
    </p>
    <p num="11">
      The load chart hanger 20 of this invention hangs a load chart 22 having a pair of horizontally spaced apart holes 24, 26 therein from the drip rail 18 of the vehicle 10.
      <br/>
      In FIGS. 2-4, the load chart hanger 20 is shown in greater detail.
    </p>
    <p num="12">
      The load chart hanger 20 includes a hanging bracket 28 and a self-balancing mounting arm 30 pivotally and slidingly mounted thereto.
      <br/>
      The hanging bracket 28 is a substantially rigid elongated cylindrical rod with a hooked upper end 32 and an eye 34 formed on the lower end.
      <br/>
      The hooked upper end 32 and the eye 34 are coplanar.
      <br/>
      The eye 34 includes a loop formed at the lower end of the first rod or hanging bracket 28.
      <br/>
      The loop has a gap therein of a given width.
    </p>
    <p num="13">
      Preferably, the hooked end 32 of the hanging bracket 28 is coated with a layer of plastic material so that it will not damage or mar the finish on the vehicle 10.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, such plastic coating provides additional frictional forces for retaining the hanging bracket 28 in one position and the drip rail 18.
      <br/>
      A layer of plastic coating can also be provided on the eye 34 to prevent scratching the vehicle 10.
    </p>
    <p num="14">
      The hanger 20 further includes a self-balancing mounting arm 30 that is pivotally and slidingly mounted to the eye 34 of the hanging bracket 28.
      <br/>
      The self-balancing mounting arm 30 includes an elongated second rod having a diameter or width greater than the width of the gap in the eye 34 so that the second rod cannot be removed from the eye through the gap.
      <br/>
      Thus, the mounting arm 30 is pivotally mounted and constrained in one direction within the eye 34.
      <br/>
      More particularly, the central portion 36 of the elongated second rod or mounting arm 30 pivots and is axially slidable within the eye 34.
      <br/>
      The mounting arm 30 or second rod is substantially rigid and cylindrical.
    </p>
    <p num="15">
      The central portion 36 passes through the eye 34 and has a bend in it.
      <br/>
      For ease of manufacturing and optimum self-balancing the bend covers less than 180 degrees so that the second rod does not loop around itself or pass through the eye a second time.
    </p>
    <p num="16">
      The central portion 36 includes a pair of angled legs 38, 40 joined together at an apex.
      <br/>
      The central portion 36 forms an inverted V shape and the legs 38, 40 terminate respectively at hooked lower end 42, 44.
      <br/>
      The central portion 36 is elevated above the hooked lower ends 42, 44.
      <br/>
      Each of the lower hooked ends 42, 44 bends outwardly, then upwardly and backwardly toward its respective leg 38, 40 so that each of the lower hooked ends 42, 44 is coplanar with its respective leg 38, 40.
    </p>
    <p num="17">
      As best seen in FIG. 1, the hooked lower ends 42, 44 are adapted to removably inserted into the mounting holes 24, 26 of the load chart 22.
      <br/>
      The hooked lower ends 42, 44 each extend in a direction that is generally opposite from the direction which the hooked end 32 of the hanging bracket 28 extends.
      <br/>
      Thus, the hooked upper end 32 and the hooked lower ends 42, 44 are disposed in three different planes because of their opposing orientations and the bend in the central portion 36.
      <br/>
      The hooked lower ends 42, 44 are preferably coated with plastic as well.
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      The present invention provides a method of detachably mounting a load chart 22 on a delivery vehicle 10.
      <br/>
      The method comprises the following steps: providing a substantially horizontal support member 18 on the vehicle 10; providing a load chart hanger 20 that includes a hanging bracket 28 and a self-balancing mounting arm 30, the hanging bracket 28 comprising an elongated first rod with a hooked upper end 32 and a lower end formed into an eye 34, the hooked upper end 32 and the eye 34 being coplanar; pivotally mounting the self-balancing mounting arm 30 through the eye 34 of the hanging bracket 28, the mounting arm 30 including an elongated second rod with opposite hooked lower ends 42, 44 and a central portion 36 therebetween pivotally and slidably mounted in the eye 34 of the first rod, the hooked lower ends 42, 44 each extending from the central portion 36 in a direction that is generally opposite from the hooked upper end 32 of the first rod; hanging the hanging bracket 28 from the support member 18 on the vehicle 10; providing a load chart 22 with a pair of horizontally spaced mounting holes 24, 26 therein; and inserting the hooked lower ends 42, 44 of the mounting arm 30 respectively into the mounting holes 24, 26 in the load chart 22 to detachably mount it to the mounting arm 30.
      <br/>
      The hooked upper end 32 of the hanging bracket 28 is particularly well adapted to mount the load chart 22 from the drip rail 18 of the vehicle 10.
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      FIG. 1 illustrates with dashed lines that the load chart hanger 20 can be mounted to the vehicle 10 in a variety of locations and ways.
      <br/>
      For example, when a substantially horizontal drip rail 18 is provided above the door 17 at the rear 14 of the vehicle 10, one or more holes 48 are drilled vertically through the rear drip rail 18 to receive the hooked upper end 32 of the hanger 20.
      <br/>
      In fact, the load chart hanger 20 of this invention can be used to mount the load chart 22 to other support members on the vehicle.
      <br/>
      A lip or a hole (vertical or horizontal) on the vehicle 10 is all that is necessary.
      <br/>
      The hooked upper end 32 can be inserted therein to hang the load chart 22.
    </p>
    <p num="20">Therefore, it can be seen that the present invention at least achieves its stated objectives.</p>
    <p num="21">
      The preferred embodiment of the present invention has been set forth in the drawings and specification, and although specific terms are employed, these are used in a generic or descriptive sense only and are not used for purposes of limitation.
      <br/>
      Changes in the form and proportion of parts as well as in the substitution of equivalents are contemplated as circumstances may suggest or render expedient without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as further defined in the following claims.
