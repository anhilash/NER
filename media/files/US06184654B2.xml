      A holster for a handheld, power intensive electronic device, such as a cellular telephone, incorporates within it a supplemental battery pack.
      <br/>
      The supplemental battery pack is used to recharge or maintain main, onboard battery pack of the cellular telephone and also to power certain supplemental circuits.
      <br/>
      The use of the docking-holster at least doubles the useful life of the device battery, which may be kept conveniently small.

    <heading>TECHNICAL FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="1">The present invention relates in general to power-intensive hand-held electronic devices, and more particularly to methods and apparatus for reducing power consumption in such devices by migrating many of their functions to a portable docking holster.</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">
      Wireless phones, pagers, camcorders and other hand-held electronic devices having large power requirements have been rapidly miniaturized.
      <br/>
      To meet a market for ever-smaller, hand-held, power-intensive electronic devices, certain trade-offs are made by the designer to reduce battery size and delete features that may be favored by only small portions of the market.
      <br/>
      For example, newer cellular phones provide sufficient "standby time" for most subscribers, but only a limited amount of "talk time." Heavy users are expected to carry spare batteries and swap batteries when the first battery unit expires.
      <br/>
      To use certain other features, such as a hands-free speakerphone, the subscriber is expected to return to his or her vehicle.
    </p>
    <p num="3">
      The trend is to smaller radiophones (and similar devices) and multi-band and multi-mode communications.
      <br/>
      There has arisen a problem of short battery life due to the size limitation.
      <br/>
      Manufacturers are designing in reduced amounts of useful battery life to keep the size of these devices small.
      <br/>
      As of the time of writing, the currently available models include the Motorola StarTAC (tm)  series, Ericsson 700 series, Qualcomm Q (tm)  series cellular/PCS phones, the Sony D-WAVE Zuma (tm)  CDMA phone and the Phillips Genie (tm)  TCD 828 GSM phone.
      <br/>
      For multi-mode, multi-band operation, battery life is an even tougher issue to address due to the complexity of the circuitry and the electrical power required by the on-board digital signal processors which typically are in multi-mode or multi-band phones.
    </p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="4">
      The present invention provides a portable docking unit system for wearable cellular/PCS phones, two-way pagers and similar devices.
      <br/>
      The present invention overcomes the above-described problems associated with using such a wearable device.
      <br/>
      The docking unit securely holds the portable device, and in preferred embodiments allows its continued use, while providing added features such as (a) a portable, battery-powered battery "saver" (b) a supplemental battery, and (c) a convenient attachment to belt or purse strap.
    </p>
    <p num="5">In preferred embodiments, a novel arrangement of the components keeps from increasing the overall thickness of the electronic device in the docking-holster, over that of the same electronic device in a traditional belt-clip.</p>
    <p num="6">A principal objective of the present invention is to provide a cost-effective solution to prolong the service time of a wearable phone without increasing the size of the phone.</p>
    <p num="7">A further objective is to provide a hidden battery pack which is blended into a holster for convenient use.</p>
    <p num="8">Another objective of the present invention is to provide energy management to let the hidden battery charge the main battery automatically to "save" the main battery's power during standby.</p>
    <p num="9">Another advantage is that the invention will allow the conventional device charger accessory to be used to charge the hidden battery.</p>
    <p num="10">Another objective of the present invention, in an alternative embodiment, is to use the docking-holster as a carrier of the same type battery pack as is used on the phone or other electronic device, in lieu of custom or fixed internal cells, in order to minimize the investment required of a current user to require the docking-holster of the present invention.</p>
    <p num="11">
      These objectives are accomplished in the present invention by a docking-holster system which (1) can be mechanically attached to the belt or purse strap, and (2) can electrically connect to the portable electronic device to increase the device's useful battery life.
      <br/>
      This permits prolonged use of very power-intensive, small cellular phones, etc., without reducing battery life or eliminating desirable, but occasional-use, features.
    </p>
    <p num="12">
      The present invention maintains the main battery of the portable electronic device near full charge, so that the device lasts longer during the day.
      <br/>
      In most embodiments, the period of usability or life is more than doubled.
      <br/>
      The docking-holster stores the electronic device between uses, but in almost all embodiments the device is also usable while nested in the docking-holster.
    </p>
    <p num="13">In one embodiment, the docking-holster can clip to a user's belt, pocket or purse strap, or can be carried without using the clip in a briefcase, pocket or purse.</p>
    <p num="14">
      In the embodiments including the one incorporating the Motorola StarTAC phone, the unit as combined with the docking-holster is much thinner than a StarTAC with both the commercially available carry-clip and "auxiliary" battery mounted to it, but yet has more power.
      <br/>
      In the case of the Qualcomm Q-Phone, this unit combined with the docking-holster according to the present invention is the same thickness as the unit with its commercially available belt-clip supplemental, and only slightly wider, yet doubles the talk-time of the device.
    </p>
    <p num="15">
      In certain embodiments, circuitry of the docking-holster can modify the voltage from the conventional charger, emulating a standard battery, so as to allow charging of the docking unit.
      <br/>
      The unit can also be charged by a supplemental power input, such as a travel charger, car-cord or transformer, and/or solar cells mounted to it.
      <br/>
      In certain embodiments, circuitry is provided which can modify the output voltage from the batteries within the docking-holster to properly charge the device battery, or to "save" the battery.

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
    <p num="17">
      FIG. 1 is a isometric view of a first embodiment of the invention.
      <br/>
      In this embodiment, a docking-holster indicated generally at 20 is designed to receive and hold a cellular telephone indicated generally at 21 of a particular make and model.
      <br/>
      Many of today's cellular telephones have distinctive shapes and it is contemplated that the precise shape of the docking-holster 20 will vary according to the make and model for which it is designed to be fit.
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      In the embodiment illustrated in FIG. 1, a front of the holster 20 is formed by a pair of wings 28 and 30 which extend in a frontward direction from a rear surface 24.
      <br/>
      The wings 28 and 30, in conjunction with a bottom panel or extension 32, form a cavity 34 in which the cellular phone 21 is closely held.
      <br/>
      To aid in releasably engaging the cellular telephone so that it does not inadvertently fall out, means such as dimples 36 may be formed to protrude inwardly from the wings in order to more tightly grip the sides of the cellular telephone 21.
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      Mounted on an upper portion of the rear side 24 is a clip 22 that preferably is spring loaded, either by a separate metallic spring (not shown) or by the natural elasticity of the clip 22.
      <br/>
      As best seen in FIG. 3, the clip 22 is so designed such that a belt or a strap may pass between it and the rear portion 24.
    </p>
    <p num="20">
      The holster 20 includes a supplemental battery pack 26.
      <br/>
      In the embodiment illustrated in FIG. 1, the supplemental battery pack 26 is a separate unit which mounts to the rear portion 24 of the holster 20 and, preferably, below the clip 22.
      <br/>
      This is ergonomically desirable because it puts the center of gravity of the entire holster 20 at its lowest point and permits the holster 20 to more readily hang from the strap by means of clip 22.
      <br/>
      Positioning the supplemental battery pack at this location also does not increase the overall thickness of the holster.
    </p>
    <p num="21">
      The supplemental battery pack 26 may simply be a battery pack of the type which is furnished with the cellular telephone 21 at purchase.
      <br/>
      In this manner, the user may purchase a further commercially available battery pack 26 and may recharge it in the same way that the user recharges the main battery pack (not shown) in the cellular telephone 21.
      <br/>
      In alternative embodiments, the battery pack 26 has different electrical characteristics from the main battery of the cellular telephone 21 and may, for example, have enhanced charge storing capability.
    </p>
    <p num="22">
      The components defining the cavity 34 should preferably permit the operation of the cellular telephone 21 while still in the holster 20.
      <br/>
      For example, as shown in FIG. 1, the cavity 34 has an entirely open face (to the leftward in FIG. 1) that allows a cover 38 of the cellular phone 21 to be flipped upward and permits the user to ready the phone 21 for use.
      <br/>
      As seen, the sidewall 30 can hold a solar panel 31, and keep it visible so that it remains useful.
      <br/>
      In alternative embodiments (not shown), the wings 28, 30 or other means for physically holding the phone 21 in place, may not be so extensive.
      <br/>
      Various means may be used to releasably secure the telephone 21 in the holster 20, so long as the user may easily remove the telephone for use without the holster, but nonetheless have it securely held by the holster 20.
    </p>
    <p num="23">
      In FIG. 1, there is also visible a bottom phone connector 40, which in the illustrated embodiment is used as a communications port to supplemental devices.
      <br/>
      In other embodiments, connector 40 is a means to supply power to the device.
      <br/>
      Somewhere in the front surface or interior surface of cavity 34 will be at least two conductive contacts (not shown) which electrically connect the main battery disposed in the phone 21 to a power management circuit incorporated into the holster 20, which in turn is connected to the supplemental battery pack 26.
      <br/>
      While in the illustrated embodiment the holster 20 comes with a belt clip that is used for convenient attachment to a belt or a purse strap, in other embodiments the belt clip is omitted in order to reduce size.
      <br/>
      These other embodiments are more specifically designed for carrying inside of containers, such as purses and the like.
    </p>
    <p num="24">
      FIG. 2 is a view similar to that shown in FIG. 1, but illustrating a further embodiment in which the supplemental battery pack 26 is permanently installed in, and is hidden by, the holster 20.
      <br/>
      In this embodiment, the battery pack 26 may be of different chemistry or characteristics than the main battery of the cellular phone 21 (FIG. 1) and a power management circuit is provided to interface between the two batteries, as will be explained below.
    </p>
    <p num="25">
      FIG. 2 illustrates the holster 20 with the cellular telephone removed.
      <br/>
      In addition to sidewalls or wings 28 and 30, the holster 20 is provided with a top hook 42 that is disposed at its upper margin; in alternative embodiments (not shown) multiple hooks may be provided.
      <br/>
      The top hook 42 is designed to fit over the cellular phone 21.
      <br/>
      The electronic device is held in place by compression between the top retaining hook 42 and the bottom connector 40.
      <br/>
      The structural elements of the holster 20 may be formed of a durable plastic material.
    </p>
    <p num="26">
      FIG. 3 is an elevational view from the ventral side of a docking-holster according to the invention.
      <br/>
      Visible within the cavity 34 is a series of conductive contacts 43 which supply power and signal conductors to the wearable device.
      <br/>
      FIG. 3 also shows an embodiment in which the top hook 42 has been replaced with a pair of hooks 42a which are disposed on two either upper corners.
    </p>
    <p num="27">
      FIG. 4 is an elevational view of a rear surface 24 of the embodiment shown in FIG. 1.
      <br/>
      In this illustrated embodiment, the supplemental battery pack 26 is removable, and is connected to the power management circuit located within the holster 20 by suitable conductive contacts.
    </p>
    <p num="28">
      FIGS. 5a, 5b and 5c show the holster 20 and the supplemental battery pack 26 in a disassembled condition.
      <br/>
      The rear surface 24 of the holster 20 includes a receptacle 44 to which the supplemental battery pack 26 is mounted.
      <br/>
      The rear surface 24 includes four conductive contacts 46 which mate with respective conductive contacts 48 located on the ventral surface 50 of the supplemental battery pack 26.
      <br/>
      A dorsal surface 52 of the supplemental battery pack 26 is shown in FIG. 5b. It is preferred that the dorsal surface 52 of the supplemental battery pack 26 be curved to conform to mating curved surfaces of the holster 20 in order to obtain a more pleasing appearance and a shape which will not catch on other articles.
      <br/>
      As indicated in FIG. 5c, the supplemental battery pack 26 has a locking mechanism 54 which is designed to engage with a locking mechanism 56 on the rear surface 24 of the holster 20.
      <br/>
      Two of the contacts 48 and two of the contacts 46 are used to transmit power from the supplemental battery pack 26 to the main, onboard battery (not shown) in the cellular phone 21.
      <br/>
      The other two contacts may be used for signal and sensing purposes.
    </p>
    <p num="29">
      FIG. 6 is a high level schematic electrical diagram of the main functional blocks of the power management circuitry according to the invention.
      <br/>
      Charge from an external source, such as a standard external battery charger meant for the cellular telephone 21 or from a cigarette lighter adapter (CLA), is input on path 200 to a charge control circuit 301 on path 200.
      <br/>
      The charge control circuit 301 steps the voltage of the power received on path 200 up or down, according to the characteristics of the battery 302 which makes up a portion of the supplemental battery pack 26 (FIGS. 1-5c).
      <br/>
      The circuit 301 is also responsible for terminating the charging of the battery 302 when the battery 302 is fully charged, or upon the advent of a dangerous condition such as a high temperature or current or voltage surge.
      <br/>
      In a preferred embodiment, the charge controller 301 has a charge sensing circuit 202 as a portion thereof, which, through a path 204 to the rechargeable battery pack 302, senses the state of charge of the cells 302.
      <br/>
      A power path 206 connects the charge control circuit 301 to the rechargeable supplemental battery 302, which in the embodiment illustrated in FIG. 5 is a rechargeable lithium ion pack.
      <br/>
      The battery 302 alternatively may be nickel metal hydride, nickel cadmium or a zinc air battery or a primary battery.
    </p>
    <p num="30">
      Battery 302 is coupled to a discharge controller 303 by means of a supervisor circuit 304, which may be omitted in certain embodiments.
      <br/>
      Power is made available on a path 208 from the battery 302.
      <br/>
      The charge/discharge controller 303 is responsible for putting the holster 20 into any of several states, including standby mode, shutdown mode, charge mode, charge termination mode, and high power mode.
      <br/>
      In a preferred embodiment, the charge/discharge controller includes a current sensing circuit 305 which senses the amount of charging current which the main battery in phone 21 is using.
      <br/>
      As will be explained below, depending on the value of the sensed current, the discharge/charge controller enters the circuit into any of a plurality of operational modes.
      <br/>
      A communication path 306 is connected between the charge/discharge controller for the main battery 21 and the charge controller for the recharging port.
      <br/>
      The controller 303 is connected to a cellular phone by interface 311.
    </p>
    <p num="31">
      FIG. 7 is a high-level schematic block diagram showing a logic flow chart by which charge/discharge controller 303 may control the operation of the docking-holster 20.
      <br/>
      At a start step 312, the current is read on current sensing path 313 (FIG. 6) by a current sensing circuit 305.
      <br/>
      If the sensed current is less than a predetermined, stored current ISTANDBY as determined at step 314, the discharge/charge controller 303 decides to enter the shutdown mode at 324, in which no current is supplied to the device.
      <br/>
      Otherwise, the controller goes to decision step 316.
      <br/>
      At step 316, if the current value is between the standby current value and a stored value ICHARGE, indicating a gradual drain on the supplemental battery, as many occur when the phone is on but no communication link has been established, the discharge/charge controller enters a power saver mode at step 320, during which limited power is supplied to the device.
      <br/>
      Finally, if at step 318 a predetermined charging current is determined to be less than the actual charging current, the procedure enters a step 322, which is fast charge mode for the circuit, enabling a high, optimum amount of power to be delivered to the device.
    </p>
    <p num="32">The procedure than periodically loops back to resample the current.</p>
    <p num="33">
      FIG. 8 is a detailed electrical schematic diagram for a power management circuit used in a holster 20 adapted for use with a StarTAC (tm)  series cellular telephone manufactured by Motorola.
      <br/>
      A lithium ion battery pack 302a is connected across the positive and negative power terminals 340 and 342.
      <br/>
      Terminals 340 and 342 connect to the "auxiliary" battery terminals located on the backside of the StarTAC (tm)  telephone.
      <br/>
      The supplemental battery pack 302a preferably operates at 3.6 volts in order to be compatible with the voltage of the StarTAC (tm)  phone.
      <br/>
      Because of the compatibility between the two battery types, no special control circuit is provided.
      <br/>
      An integrated circuit 343 is connected between the positive node 340 and a type selector input 346.
      <br/>
      A thermistor 348 is also connected to the output 346 so as to act as a temperature sensor.
      <br/>
      The type selector integrated circuit 344 is provided in order to distinguish chemistry and swap control.
      <br/>
      For proper operation with this Motorola embodiment, an identification integrated circuit 344 is included in the power management circuit, and has a data line 350 connected to a data output 349.
      <br/>
