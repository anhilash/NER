    <heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">The present invention relates to full thickness resection devices for performing localized resections of lesions in tubular organs, particularly the colon.</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND INFORMATION</heading>
    <p num="3">
      A resection procedure involves excising a portion of an organ, approximating the surrounding tissue together to close up the hole created by the excision, and removing the excess tissue.
      <br/>
      Various conventional devices and procedures are available for resectioning lesions in tubular organs.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      For example, several known resection devices and procedures requires at least one incision in an area near the portion of the organ to be excised for access to the lesion or treatment site (because, for example, the resectioning device may lack steering and/or viewing capabilities).
      <br/>
      Thus, the incision is required to allow the physician to access the organ section to be excised and guide the device to that section.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, when the organ section to be excised is beyond the reach of the surgical device, or the surgical device is not flexible enough to wind through the organ to the site to be excised, an incision will be required to position the device for the procedure.
      <br/>
      Of course, these incisions are painful and may involve a partial or entire loss of mobility while recuperating from the incision, in addition to recovering from the tubular resectioning procedure itself.
      <br/>
      In addition, the time required to recover from such a procedure is often longer than for procedures which do not require incisions.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      One type of conventional resection procedure utilizes a circular stapling instrument in which a tubular section of a tubular organ is excised, resulting in the tubular organ being separated into a first segment and a second segment.
      <br/>
      The end sections of the first and second segments are then individually tied in a purse-string fashion, approximated, stapled, and the "purse-stringed" end sections are then cut off.
      <br/>
      In this full circle resectioning procedure, at least one separate invasive incision must be made near the section to be excised in order to cut and individually tie the separate end sections of the organ.
      <br/>
      Also, a separate incision is necessary to place one part of the resectioning device in the first segment and a corresponding second part of the device in the second segment so that the device can then bring the first and second segments together to re-attach the organ sections back together.
      <br/>
      A first of these separate parts may generally include a staple firing mechanism while the second part includes an anvil for forming the staples.
      <br/>
      Thus, this type of resectioning procedure involves the drawbacks mentioned above in regard to procedures requiring invasive incisions.
      <br/>
      In addition, the separation of the organ into two segments creates the risk of spillage of non-sterile bowel contents into the sterile body cavity, which can cause severe infection and possibly death.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      An alternative resectioning device includes a stapling and cutting assembly on a shaft which can be bent or formed into a desired shape and then inserted into a patient's body cavity.
      <br/>
      Once the shaft has been bent into the desired shape, the rigidity of the shaft ensures that that shape is maintained throughout the operation.
      <br/>
      This arrangement limits the effective operating range of the device as the bending of the shaft into the desired shape before insertion and the rigidity of the shaft once bent require the physician to ascertain the location of the organ section to be removed before insertion, and deform the shaft accordingly.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, the rigidity of the shaft makes it difficult to reach remote areas in the organ--particularly those areas which must be reached by a winding and/or circuitous route (e.g., sigmoid colon).
      <br/>
      Thus, an incision may be required near the organ section to be excised in order to position the device at the organ section to be excised.
    </p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="7">
      The present invention is directed to a full-thickness resection system comprising a flexible endoscope and a stapling mechanism, wherein the endoscope is slidably received through at least a portion of the stapling mechanism.

      A position adjusting mechanism is provided for moving the anvil and the stapling head between the tissue receiving and stapling positions and a staple firing mechanism sequentially fires a plurality of staples from the stapling head across the gap against the anvil and through any tissue received in the gap and a knife cuts a portion of tissue received within the gap.

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
    <p num="9">
      As shown in FIGS. 1 and 2, an apparatus according to a first embodiment of the present invention comprises a working head assembly 2 which may preferably be connected to a distal end 4a of a sheath 4.
      <br/>
      The proximal end 4b of the sheath 4 may preferably be connected to a control handle 6.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      In operation, the entire apparatus is mounted onto an endoscope 8 by passing the endoscope 8 through the control handle 6, the sheath 4, and the working head assembly 2, as shown in FIG. 2.
      <br/>
      The endoscope 8 is then inserted into a body orifice to locate a lesion in the tubular organ under visual observation (usually while insufflating the organ).
      <br/>
      Once the lesion has been located, the working head assembly 2 and the sheath 4 are slidably advanced along the endoscope 8 into the tubular organ until the working head assembly 2 is in a desired position adjacent to the lesion.
      <br/>
      Those skilled in the art will understand that in an alternative embodiment, the working head assembly 2 may also be detachably coupled to a distal end of the endoscope 8, and the entire arrangement may then be inserted into the body orifice under visual observation.
    </p>
    <p num="11">
      As shown in FIG. 1, the working head assembly 2 comprises an anvil member 10 coupled to a distal end 12a of a proximal housing 12.
      <br/>
      The anvil member 10 has a substantially crescent-shaped cross-section (i.e., the outer edge 18 of the anvil member 10 substantially forms a portion of a first circle with a second smaller circular cut-out 13 formed within the first circle) with a proximal face 14 and a smaller distal face 16.
      <br/>
      The cut-out 13 of the anvil member 10 is included to allow the endoscope 8 to be slid through the entire working head assembly 2 so that the endoscope 8 may be advanced into the body passage allowing the working head assembly 2 to later be advanced into the body to the lesion.
      <br/>
      In addition, the cut-out 13 also provides forward vision via the endoscope 8.
      <br/>
      Thus, any shape of the cut-out 13 may be selected which is large enough to accommodate the endoscope 8, with a larger cut-out providing a larger field of vision.
      <br/>
      An outer surface 18 of the anvil member 10 extends substantially parallel to a central axis of the working head assembly 2 while the proximal and distal faces 14, 18 of the anvil member 10 extend in planes substantially perpendicular to the central axis.
      <br/>
      The outer surface 18 is joined to the distal face 16 by a tapered portion 5.
    </p>
    <p num="12">
      As shown in FIG. 3, the proximal face 14 of the anvil member 10 includes a first cavity 37 and a rim 41 encircling the first cavity 37.
      <br/>
      A plurality of staple-forming grooves 19 are arranged in two offset rows on the rim 41 of the anvil member 10 and a circular guiding slit 21 extends radially within the rows of grooves 19.
      <br/>
      The rim 41 protrudes from the remainder of the proximal face 14 so that a shallow cavity is formed on the proximal face 14.
    </p>
    <p num="13">
      The anvil member 10 is coupled to the proximal housing 12 by means of two mounting shafts 20a and 20b, which may preferably be substantially cylindrical.
      <br/>
      Each mounting shaft 20a, 20b is coupled to the proximal face 14 of the anvil member 10 on a respective one of two horns 22a, 22b formed by the crescent-shaped anvil member 10.
      <br/>
      Although the anvil member 10 is shown fixedly coupled to the mounting shafts 20a, 20b, those skilled in the art will understand that the anvil member 10 may also be pivotally coupled to the mounting shafts 20a, 20b in order to provide a greater field of vision through the endoscope 8 as shown in FIG. 3a. In this pivoted-type arrangement, the anvil member 10 is angled in a first configuration so that the horns 22a, 22b are closer to the dental end 12a of the proximal housing than the rest of the anvil member 10.
      <br/>
      Then, as the anvil member 10 is drawn towards the distal end 12a of the proximal housing 12, the anvil member 10 would be pressed against the distal end 12a beginning with the horns 22a, 22b, which would cause the anvil member 10 to pivot until the proximal face 14 of the anvil member 10 is parallel to the distal end 12a.
    </p>
    <p num="14">
      As shown in FIG. 1, the mounting shafts 20a, 20b are slidably received in mounting holes 26a, 26b, which have a size and shape substantially corresponding to the size and shape of the mounting shafts 20a, 20b and which run axially through the proximal housing 12.
      <br/>
      The mounting shafts 20a, 20b are preferably movable axially proximally and distally within the mounting holes 26a, 26b between a proximal most position in which a tissue gripping gap of a first predetermined width is formed between the rim 41 and the distal end 12a of the proximal housing 12, and a distal most position in which a tissue receiving gap of a larger second predetermined width is formed between the rim 41 and the distal end 12a of the proximal housing 12.
      <br/>
      The second predetermined width should preferably be more than twice the thickness of a wall of the organ being resectioned so that a section of the tubular organ may be pulled into a resectioning position between the anvil member 10 and the proximal housing 12.
    </p>
    <p num="15">
      As shown in FIG. 4, the proximal end of at least one of the mounting shafts 20a and 20b is coupled to a drive mechanism 102 provided within the proximal housing 12.
      <br/>
      In a preferred embodiment, the drive mechanism 102 is composed of a yoke 103 and a drive shaft 105.
      <br/>
      The yoke 103 is preferably slidably received within the proximal housing 12 for longitudinal movement along the axis of the proximal housing 12 so that, when the anvil member 10 is in the proximal most position, the yoke 103 is in a corresponding proximal most position and, when the anvil member is in the distal most position, the yoke 103 is in a corresponding distal most position.
    </p>
    <p num="16">
      The yoke 103 may preferably be substantially semicircular with a substantially rectangular cross-section.
      <br/>
      Although the semicircle formed by the yoke 103 in FIG. 4 forms substantially a quarter arc of a circle, the yoke 103 may form a larger semicircle based upon the interior accommodations of the proximal housing 12 and the position of the mounting shafts 20a, 20b.
      <br/>
      The mounting shaft 20a may preferably be coupled to the yoke 103 at a first end 103a of the yoke 103, and the mounting shaft 20b may be coupled at a second end 103b of the yoke 103.
      <br/>
      A shaft hole 107, having a diameter substantially corresponding to a diameter of a complementarily threaded distal end 105a of the drive shaft 105, extends through the yoke 103 at a point substantially midway between the first end 103a and second end 103b.
      <br/>
      Thus, when the drive shaft 105 is rotated, the threaded distal end 105a engages the shaft hole 107 to move the yoke 103 proximally or distally (in dependence upon the direction of rotation of the drive shaft 105).
    </p>
    <p num="17">
      The distal end 105a of the drive shaft 105 should preferably be threaded over a first section 105t substantially corresponding in length to at least the distance between the proximal and distal most yoke positions, while a remainder portion 105r may have no threads thereon.
      <br/>
      The drive shaft 105 may have an increased cross-section in the areas immediately adjacent to the threaded first section 105t proximally and/or distally of section 105t), thereby limiting the movement of the yoke 103 to the first section 105t.
      <br/>
      Those skilled in the art will understand that the drive shaft 105 is preferably rotatably mounted within the proximal housing 12 so that it may only rotated and may not move relative to the proximal housing 12.
      <br/>
      The drive shaft 105 preferably extends to a proximal end 105b which is coupled to a drive cable 100 which extends to the control handle 6 through the sheath 4.
      <br/>
      The drive cable 100 may preferably run axially along the peripheral interior of the sheath 4.
      <br/>
      Those skilled in the art will understand that the sheath 4 is preferably torsionally stiff to resist the torque forces from the drive cables rotating therein.
      <br/>
      However, the sheath 4 is longitudinally flexible to so that it may be slidably advanced along the endoscope 8, while minimizing interference with the operation of the endoscope 8 and trauma to surrounding tissue.
      <br/>
      The sheath 4 is preferably constructed similar to known endoscope insertion tubes, which are flexible yet allow the transfer of forces to swivel the distal end of the endoscope 8 in multiple directions and the torqueable rotation of the endoscope.
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      FIGS. 7-10 show a cutaway view of the working head assembly 2 in FIG. 1, in which the respective movements of the drive shaft 105 and the yoke 103 are restricted in the manner described above.
      <br/>
      As shown in FIG. 8, a pear-shaped rear cover plate 460 may preferably be connected to the proximal end 12b of the proximal housing 12.
      <br/>
      A first shaft hole 462 having a cross-sectional size substantially corresponding to the cross-sectional size of the drive shaft 105 is provided in a lower portion of the rear cover plate 460 for receiving the drive shaft 105 therethrough.
      <br/>
      Thus, the yoke 103 is restricted to only longitudinal movement in this arrangement because, the distal side of the yoke 103 is coupled to the mounting shafts 20a, 20b which are disposed in the mounting holes 26a, 26b, and the proximal side of the yoke 103 is coupled to the drive shaft 105 which is disposed in the first shaft hole 462.
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      As shown in FIG. 9a, the movement of the drive shaft 105 may be restricted to only rotation movement about its axis by two washer-type devices 470 fixedly attached to the drive shaft 105 on either side of the rear cover plate 460.
      <br/>
      A similar result may be achieved by providing the drive shaft 105 with a larger cross-sectional size on either side of the rear cover plate 460 in relation to the portion of the drive shaft 105 within the rear cover plate 460.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, the cross-section of a bulging portion 476 of the drive shaft 105 located substantially in the center of the rear cover plate 460 may be larger than the portions of the drive shaft 105 immediately adjacent to the bulging portion 476.
      <br/>
      The first shaft hole 462 may then have a center portion 474 with a larger cross-section than the rest of the first shaft hole 462 to accommodate the bulging portion 476 of the drive shaft 105.
    </p>
    <p num="20">
      FIG. 9b shows a coupling arrangement between the drive cable 100 and the drive shaft 105 in which a proximal end 105a of the shaft may have a D-shaped hole 105h extending therethrough.

      A distal end 102b of the drive cable 100 has a D-shape corresponding to the shape of the hole 105h so that the distal end 102b of the drive cable may be received within the hole 105h in the drive shaft 105.
      <br/>
      FIG. 9c shows an alternative coupling arrangement for coupling the drive cable 100 to the drive shaft 105 in which the hole 105h in the proximal end 105a of the drive shaft 105a and the distal end 102b of the drive cable 100 have corresponding squarish shapes.
      <br/>
      The single edge provided by the D-shapes in FIG. 9b and the four edges provided by the squarish shapes in FIG. 9c allow the drive cable 100 to transfer a rotational force to the drive shaft 105 with minimal slippage.

      FIG. 6 shows a wedge 402, a first portion 402a of which is non-rotatably coupled to an actuating shaft 400 so that rotation of the shaft 400 the wedge 402 rotates, preferably about the longitudinal axis of the working head assembly 2.
      <br/>
      The wedge 402 includes a blade handle 408 which extends from a first portion 408a coupled to the wedge 402 to a second portion 408b which is coupled to the blade 202 so that, when the wedge 402 is rotated, the blade 202 is rotated through the blade slit 36.
      <br/>
      The wedge 402 has a substantially bell-like cross-section when viewed axially, with a second portion 402b extending radially outward from the first portion 402a and, consequently, from the longitudinal axis of the shaft 40010 which preferably coincides with the longitudinal axis of the working head assembly 2.
      <br/>
      A notch of varying depth is cut out of a radially outer portion of the second portion 402b to form a cam surface 412 thereon.
      <br/>
      A first ramp section 412a ramps up from a leading face 402d of the wedge 402 to adjoin a second ramp section 412b that ramps down to adjoin a rear face 402e of the wedge 402.
      <br/>
      The wedge 402 is preferably arranged in the proximal housing 12 so that the cam surface 412 is substantially aligned with the staple slits 34.

      A staple driver 472 extends substantially longitudinally, proximally from each of the staple slits 34 having toward the plane in which the wedge 402 rotates and each staple driver 472 is slidably received within the working head assembly 2 for motion between a distal most, staple driving position and a proximal most inoperative position.
      <br/>
      In the inoperative position, an upper end of each of the staple drivers 472 is completely received within the proximal housing 12, just proximal of a respective staple.
      <br/>
      The staple drivers 472 are 30 preferably substantially rectangular in shape, although bottom edges 472a thereof may more preferably be rounded.
      <br/>
      The length of the staple drivers 472 is preferably selected so that, in the inoperative position, the bottom surfaces 472a extend into the plane of rotation of the wedge between the proximal and distal most extents of the first ramp portion 412a.
      <br/>
      The bottom surfaces 472a are, in the inoperative position, more preferably substantially aligned with the distal most projection of the of the cam surface 412 at the leading face 402d.
      <br/>
      Thus in operation, the wedge 402 is rotated by the actuating shaft 400 so that the first ramp section 412a of the cam surface 412 successively drives each of the staple drivers 472 into contact with a corresponding staple so that each staple driver 472 and its staple are driven distally through a respective one of the staple slits 34.
      <br/>
      This drives the staples across the gap from the distal end 12a into the anvil member 10, through any tissue held between the anvil member 10 and the proximal housing 12, and into the corresponding staple forming grooves 19.
      <br/>
      Thus the section of the tissue gripped between the anvil member 10 and the proximal housing 12 is stapled in a pattern substantially the same as that formed by the staple slits 34 (i.e., substantially circular).
      <br/>
      At the same time, the blade 202 is rotated through the blade slit 36 to cut the tissue which has just been stapled through the rotation of the wedge 402.

    <p num="31">
      After each of the plurality of staples has been fired, the wedge 402 may be driven in a reverse direction to reload a new plurality of staples.

      The wedge 402 may rotate in a direction opposite the staple firing direction without getting caught on any of the staple drivers 472 because the staple drivers are pushed out of the way by the second ramp section 412b of the cam surface 412.

      This rotational force is transferred to the actuating shaft 400, which then rotates the wedge 402 around the longitudinal axis of the actuating cable 450.
      <br/>
      The first ramp section 412a of the cam surface 412 of the wedge 402 then individually drives the staple drivers 472 distally as described above to staple the tissue received between the anvil member 10 and the proximal housing 12 with the cutting blade 202 lagging behind the firing of the stapling since the blade handle 408 is coupled to the rear face 402e of the wedge.

      FIG. 10a shows an alternative configuration of the wedge 402 of FIG. 6 including a separate blade portion 420.
      <br/>
      The blade portion 420 is preferably rotatably coupled to the distal end 400a of the actuating shaft 400 so that a rotation of the actuating shaft 400 about its longitudinal axis does not cause a corresponding rotation of the blade portion 420.
      <br/>
      As in FIG. 6, the wedge 202 of this apparatus is non-rotatably coupled to the distal end 400a of the shaft 400.
    </p>
    <p num="34">
      The blade handle 408 of this apparatus, which is coupled to a peripheral edge 420e of the blade portion 420, extends to the cutting portion of the blade 202.
      <br/>
      As described above, the cutting portion of the blade 202 extends past the distal end 12a except when the blade 202 is received within one of the extensions 84a and 84b.
    </p>
    <p num="35">
      The wedge 402 substantially corresponds in shape and size to the wedge 402 of FIG. 6, except that the blade handle 408 is not coupled thereto.
      <br/>
      In addition, a locking shaft 402h extends into a distal surface 402t located as shown in FIG. 10a so that when the blade portion 420 and the wedge portion 410 are aligned, the locking shaft 402h and a locking dimple 414 (shown in FIG. 10c) on the bottom face 420b of the blade portion 420 are substantially aligned.
      <br/>
      As shown in FIG. 10b, a spring 416 is received within the locking shaft 402h with a proximal end of the spring coupled to the proximal end of the locking shaft 402h.
      <br/>
      A locking ball 418 coupled to the distal end 416b of the spring 416 is sized so that when a proximally directed force is applied to the locking ball 418, the locking ball 418 may be slidably received within the locking shaft 402h.
      <br/>
      In addition, when no distally directed force is applied to the locking ball 418, the spring 416 preferably extends so that approximately one half (or more) of the locking ball 418 extends distally out of the locking shaft 402h.
      <br/>
      Thus, when the wedge 402 is rotated toward the blade portion 420, the locking ball 418 is received in a cut-out 425 formed on the proximal surface 420b of the blade portion 420.
      <br/>
      As shown in FIG. 10c, the cut-out 425 slopes downward to adjoin the locking dimple 424 so that when the locking ball 418 is received, the slope of the cut-out 425 gradually pushes the locking ball 418 into the locking shaft 420h.
      <br/>
      Then, when the wedge 402 moves into alignment with the blade portion 420, the locking ball 418 extends out of the locking shaft 402h and enters the locking dimple 414 to couple the wedge 402 to the blade portion 420 so that a rotation of the wedge 402 causes a corresponding rotation of the blade portion 420.
    </p>
    <p num="36">
      A radial length B, between the peripheral edge 420e of the blade portion 420 and the actuating shaft 400 may substantially correspond to a radial length W1 between the wall 402f of the wedge portion 410 and the actuating shaft.
      <br/>
      This places the blade handle 408 in substantially the same position, relative to the cam surface 402c of the wedge portion 410, as in the previous embodiments.
      <br/>
      Of course, those skilled in the art will understand that it is important that the blade 408 should extend substantially distally to the blade slit 36 so that rotation of the blade portion 420 will cause a corresponding rotation of the blade 202 through the blade slit 36.
    </p>
    <p num="37">
      In operation, the wedge 402 is initially situated proximally of one of the blade housings, e.g., 74a while the blade portion 420 is situated proximally of the blade housing 74b with the blade 202 received in the blade housing 74b.
      <br/>
      When the lesion tissue has been drawn into position between the distal end 12a and the anvil member 10, the physician actuates the shaft 400 by applying a force at the control handle 6.
      <br/>
      This causes the wedge portion 402 to rotate to sequentially drive each of the staple drivers 472 distally through the corresponding staple slit 34.
      <br/>
      When the wedge 402 has rotated fully into alignment with the blade portion 420 and the locking ball 418 is received into the locking dimple 414, the operator then operates the control handle 6 in the opposite direction to draw the blade 202 out of the blade housing 74b to cut all of the tissue extending radially inward of the rows of staples.
      <br/>
      When the blade 202 is received in the other blade housing 74a, the wall of the body passage is released and the lesion tissue remains within the gap between the distal end 12a and the anvil member 10 held by the grasping devices 108.
      <br/>
      The lesion tissue may then be withdrawn from the body for analysis.
      <br/>
      This embodiment of the wedge 402 provides a safeguard in case the stapling process must be prematurely aborted due to, for example, a jam in one of the staple slits 34.
      <br/>
      Using this embodiment, the cutting process is not begun until all of the staples have been fired.
      <br/>
      Thus, it is possible to reduce the risk of cutting an opening in an organ which is not completely closed by the staples.

      The actuating shafts 400 and 105 and the drive cables 450 and 102 are then located concentric to the endoscope lumen 40 in the sheath 4.

      FIG. 12 shows a device according to a third embodiment of the present invention.
      <br/>
      The proximal face 14 of the anvil member 10 of this embodiment has a cross-section similar to the crescent-shaped cross-section of the anvil member 10 of the device of FIG. 1.
      <br/>
      Thus, the anvil member 10 has two horns 22a and 22b formed on either side of a cut-out 13 which extends axially through the anvil member 10 from the proximal face 14 to the distal end 15 to receive the endoscope 8 therein.
      <br/>
      As with the device of FIG. 11, the cross-sectional size of the anvil member 10 diminishes in overall size from a maximum at the proximal face 14 to a minimum size at the distal end 15, and the horns 22a and 22b become less pronounced from the proximal face 14 to the distal end 15.
      <br/>
      In a side view, the anvil member 10 becomes gradually tapered from the proximal end 14 to the distal end 16.
    </p>
    <p num="52">
      As in the device of FIG. 11, the tapered shape of the anvil member 10 of the device of FIG. 12 allows for easier insertion of the device into the patient's body.
      <br/>
      In contrast to the second embodiment, the cut-out 13 provides a larger field of vision via the endoscope 8 as the anvil member does not totally enclose the cut-out 13.
      <br/>
      And, as in the first embodiment, two substantially cylindrical mounting shafts 20a and 20b are coupled to the proximal face 14 of the anvil member 10 on horns 22a and 22b and are received within the mounting holes 26a and 26b, respectively.
    </p>
    <p num="53">
      In contrast to the previous embodiments, the proximal housing 12 in this embodiment may preferably have a substantially oval cross-sectional shape.
      <br/>
      This shape of the proximal housing 12 is formed by extending the proximal housing 12 shown in FIG. 1 around the cut-out 29 to create the substantially cylindrical second endoscope lumen 52.
      <br/>
      The oval shape allows the second endoscope lumen 52 to be offset from the axial center of the proximal housing 12 and aligned with the first endoscope lumen 13.
      <br/>
      This offset of the second lumen 52 allows the cavity 30 to be provided adjoining the blade slit 36.
      <br/>
      In all other material respects, the proximal housing 12 in this embodiment is substantially identical to the proximal housing 12 illustrated in FIG. 1.

    <p num="54">
      FIG. 13 shows a device according to a fourth embodiment of the present invention.
      <br/>
      This embodiment is substantially similar to the embodiment shown in FIG. 12. However, the proximal face 14 of the anvil member 10 in this embodiment has a substantially oval-shaped cross-section corresponding to the proximal housing 12.
      <br/>
      The anvil member 10 is tapered towards the distal end 16 to form a substantially bullet-like structure having an oval-shaped cross-section.
      <br/>
      The cut-out 13 shown in FIG. 12 may preferably be enclosed within the anvil member 10 and thereby forms an extension of the first endoscope lumen 13.

    <p num="55">
      A substantially semicircular shield 31 extends from the proximal face 14 of the anvil member 10 and shields a hemispherical portion of the gap formed between the anvil member 10 and the proximal housing 12.
      <br/>
      The shield 31 allows a tissue section to be drawn primarily in the gap between the staple-forming grooves 19 and the staple slits 34 with minimal spill-over into the rest of the gap.
    </p>
    <p num="56">
      A recessed groove 35 may preferably be formed around a portion of the proximal housing 12 for slidably receiving the shield 31 therein.
      <br/>
      The recessed groove 35 may preferably have a size and shape substantially corresponding to the size and shape of the shield 31 so that when the anvil member 10 is in its proximal most position, the shield 31 is received within the recessed groove 35 to form a substantially completely continuous outer surface of the proximal housing 12.
    </p>
    <p num="57">
      In operation, the user may utilize suction through the endoscope 8 to draw a tissue section into the gap between the anvil member 10 and the proximal housing 12.
      <br/>
      In such a situation, the shield 31 prevents a portion of the tissue section or loose debris from being pulled into the area around the mounting shafts 20a and 20b which may otherwise interfere with the axial movement of the mounting shafts 20a, 20b.
      <br/>
      In addition, the shield 31 also serves to direct the pulling force of the suction to pull tissue primarily in the gap between the staple-forming grooves 19 and the staple slits 34.

      FIGS. 14a and 14b show a device according to a fifth embodiment of the present invention in which the working head assembly 2 is coupled to the endoscope 8 without the sheath 4.
      <br/>
      As described above, distal ends 500a of control cables 500 (i.e., drive cable 100 and actuating cable 450) may preferably be coupled to the working head assembly 2 while proximal ends 500b of the control cables 500 are coupled to the control handle 6 as in the previous embodiments.
      <br/>
      However, instead of using a flexible sheath 4 to receive the control cables 500 and the endoscope 8, the control cables 500 are inserted into respective tubes 510.
      <br/>
      Each of the tubes 510 should have a sufficient cross-section to allow the control cables 500 to rotate within the tubes 510.
      <br/>
      The tubes 510 are then fastened at various predetermined points along their lengths to the endoscope 8 by a plurality of fasteners 502.
      <br/>
      Those skilled in the art will understand that many different types of fasteners may be used either alone or in combination for this purpose so long as the fasteners do not impede the steering of the endoscope 8 or the rotation of the cables 500.
      <br/>
      Those skilled in the art will understand that tape (e.g., surgical, electrical, etc.), electrical cable, rubber bands, other belt-style fasteners, etc. may be used as fasteners.

    <p num="59">FIGS. 16-18 illustrate alternative configurations of the blade housing 74b and it will be understood that similar alternative embodiments may be implemented for the blade housing 74a.</p>
    <p num="60">
      The blade slit 36 continues through the blade housing 74b into housing portion 84b which extends from a forward end at which the blade slit 36 enters the blade housing 74b to a rearward end where the blade slit 36 and the housing portion 84b terminate.
      <br/>
      A shield receiving slit 480 extends through the blade housing 74b substantially perpendicular to the housing portion 84b between the forward and rearward ends thereof.
    </p>
    <p num="61">
      After an organ section has been stapled between the anvil member 10 and the proximal housing 12, and the blade 202 is drawn through the stapled tissue, there may be a problem if tissue stretches along with the blade 202 into the housing portion 84b without being completely severed.
      <br/>
      Withdrawal of the resectioned tissue might then lead to tearing of the tissue which is to remain in place.
    </p>
    <p num="62">
      As seen in FIG. 17, a flexible breakaway shield 482 having a shape and size substantially corresponding to the shape and size of the shield receiving slit 480 is inserted into the shield receiving slit 480.
      <br/>
      After entering the housing portion 84b, the cutting blade 202 contacts the shield 482 and further progress of the blade 202 deforms the shield 482 until the shield 482 is cut in half.
      <br/>
      When the shield 482 is cut in half, each half snaps back pulling the tissue in a direction opposite the direction of travel of the blade allowing the cutting blade 202 to completely sever the tissue.
    </p>
    <p num="63">
      FIG. 18 shows a second alternative arrangement in which a flexible gate 484, having a first gate half 484a and a second gate half 484b, may be removably or fixedly mounted within the shield receiving slit 480.
      <br/>
      Each of the halves 484a and 484b may preferably be mounted within a respective half of the shield receiving slit 480, so that a small gap formed therebetween substantially corresponds in width to the width of the cutting blade 202.
      <br/>
      The wiping action in a direction opposed to the direction of travel of the blade 202 is substantially the same as that of the shield 482 without requiring the severing and replacement of the shield 482 after each use.

      FIGS. 19a and 19b show a third alternative arrangement in which a pair of tissue blockers 600 and 602 facilitate the cutting of the resectioned tissue.

    </p>
    <p num="65">
      As shown in FIG. 19a, the first tissue blocker 600 is composed of a first rectangular bar 610 and a second rectangular bar 612 situated at a first end 21a of the guiding slit 21.

      The first rectangular bar 610 has a first base 610a and the second rectangular bar 612 has a second base 612a, which are both fixedly coupled to the proximal face 14 of the anvil member 10 and arranged so that the bases 610a, 612b straddle both sides of the guiding slit 21 with a gap formed therebetween corresponding to the width of the guiding slit 21.
    </p>
    <p num="66">
      A first slot 614a is provided in the first base 610a of the first rectangular bar 610, and a second slot 614b is provided in the second base 612a of the second rectangular bar 612 so that when the rectangular bars 610, 612 are coupled to the anvil member 10, the flexible breakaway shield 482 (shown in FIG. 17) may be disposed within the slots 614a, 614b.
      <br/>
      As shown in FIG. 19c, a pair of L-shaped holes 620, 622 are provided on both ends of the blade slit 30 on the distal end 12a of the proximal housing 12.
      <br/>
      The L-shaped holes 620, 622 extend longitudinally within the proximal housing 12 to receive the rectangular bars 610, 612 therein when the anvil member 10 is coupled to the proximal housing 12.
    </p>
    <p num="67">
      This arrangement operates similarly to the arrangement shown in FIG. 17, so that the wiping action of the shield 482 in a direction opposite to a movement of the blade 202 allows the blade 202 to completely cut through the resectioned tissue.
      <br/>
      Although the shield 482 is initially a single piece in a first operation of the device, the shield 482 may be re-used without replacement in further operations with minimal diminishment of its effectiveness.

      FIG. 20 shows a device according to a sixth embodiment of the present invention in which like reference numerals identify the same elements.

      The sheath 4 is substantially more rigid and shorter than in previous embodiments.
      <br/>
      Although this decreases the effective operative range of the device, the rigidity of the sheath 4 increases its overall structural strength, allowing greater forces to be transferred therethrough to the working head assembly 2 than in the previous embodiments.
      <br/>
      The cables 100, 450 driving the various mechanisms 102, 104 may then need to be stronger and stiffer in order to accommodate the increased forces.
      <br/>
      As a result of these changes, the overall size of the working head assembly 2 may then be increased to, for example, treat lesions that may be too large for the devices according to the previous embodiments to treat in a single procedure.

      As shown in FIG. 21, the anvil member 10 and the stapler member 17 preferably have substantially semi-circular shapes complementary to one another such that, when they are positioned adjacent to each other, they form a substantially annular clamp-like device (as shown in FIG. 23).
      <br/>
      The anvil member 10 and the stapler member 17 are pivotally connected via a substantially cylindrical hinge-pin 60 which is provided on a distal end 25a of the connecting adapter 25.

      <br/>
      The first extensions 10b may substantially correspond in shape and size to the second ring-like extensions 17b so that when the first anvil end 10a and the first stapler end 17a are engaged, an alternating arrangement of first and second extensions 10b, 17b is formed in which the holes of each of the first and second extensions 10b, 17b are substantially aligned to form a continuous hole in which a hinge-pin 60 is received.

      The rod links 150a, 150b provide a rigid coupling between the anchoring joints 23a, 23b and a distal end 154 of a push rod 152.
      <br/>
      Thus, a longitudinal force in a distal or proximal direction applied to the push rod 152 is transferred to the anchoring joints 23a, 23b, and thereby to the anvil member 10 and the stapler member 17.

      The wedge-sled 402 has a cut-out in a corner forming a cam surface 412 thereon and a blade handle 408.

Therefore, it is necessary to allow the actuating cable 450 disposed within the tube 332 and received within the stapler head 17c to correspondingly move with the stapler member 17.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, a channel 330 is provided in the connecting adapter 25 to receive the tube 332 therein.
      <br/>
      The channel 330 may preferably be formed within the connecting adapter 25 to substantially correspond to the arc path along which the tube 332 is pulled by the stapler member 17, as the stapler member 17 moves between the tissue receiving and the stapling positions.
      <br/>
      Thus, the channel minimizes bending and crimping of the tube 332.

      Those skilled in the art will understand that although the proximal housing 12 in any of the embodiments may preferably be composed of a metallic-type material, the proximal housing 12 may also be composed of a clear plastic-type material which would allow the user to operate the working head assembly 2 under visual observation by partially withdrawing the endoscope 8 into the second endoscope lumen 52 in the proximal housing 12.
      <br/>
      The user could then look through the walls of the endoscope lumen 52 into the proximal housing 12 to, for example, observe whether each of the plurality of staple drivers 472 have been actuated.
      <br/>
      In addition, the user may also observe whether the wedge 402 shown in FIGS. 10a and 10b is locked into the blade portion 420 as described above.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, selected portions of the proximal housing 12 may be composed of the clear plastic-type material providing a "window" to view through the proximal housing 12.

      Those skilled in the art will also understand that although the above-described embodiments show mechanical force transmission between the control handle and the working head assembly, this device could alternatively include an electronic control for receiving input from an operator coupled to a series of motors in the working head assembly.
      <br/>
      Those skilled in the art will further understand that the relative positioning of the stapling mechanisms and the position adjusting mechanisms to each other may be reversed, placing the stapling mechanisms in a distal-most position in relation to the position adjusting mechanism.
