      1.

      Field of the Invention
    </p>
    <p num="2">
      The present invention relates to carbapenem derivatives which have potent antimicrobial activity against a wide range of bacteria.
      <br/>
      More particularly, the present invention relates to novel carbapenem derivatives which have a substituted or unsubstituted imidazo�5,1-b�thiazole or imidazo�5,1-b�thiazolium group at the 2-position of the carbapenem ring through a pyrrolidinylthio group.
    </p>
    <p num="3">2. Background Art</p>
    <p num="4">Carbapenem derivatives, by virtue of potent antimicrobial activity against a wide spectrum of bacteria, have been energetically studied as a highly useful  BETA -lactam agent, and Imipenem, Panipenem, and Meropenem have been clinically used.</p>
    <p num="5">
      At the present time, both Imipenem and Panipenem, however, are used as a mixture due to instability against renal dehydropeptidase-1 ("DHP-1") in the case of Impenem and in order to reduce nephrotoxicity in the case of Panipenem.
      <br/>
      On the other hand, Meropenem, which has been recently put on the market, has increased stability against DHP-1 by virtue of the presence of a methyl group at the 1 BETA -position and hence enabled the use as a single active ingredient in medicaments.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      However, the stability against DHP-1 is not yet satisfactory.
      <br/>
      Further, the antimicrobial activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae (PRSP), and resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa which have risen a serious clinical problem these days are also not always satisfactory.
      <br/>
      It is therefore strongly demanded to obtain novel carbapenem antibiotics which have improved antimicrobial activity against these bacteria.
    </p>
    <p num="7">WO 96/028455 discloses that carbapenem derivatives having an aromatic heterocyclic imidazo�5,1-b�thiazolium-6-ylmethyl group at the 2-position of the carbapenem ring have antimicrobial activity.</p>
    <p num="8">
      Japanese Patent Laid-Open Nos. 239058/1993 and 291973/1995, WO 95/10520, and WO 93/21186 disclose carbapenem derivatives wherein the 5-position of a pyrrolidinylthio group bonded to the 2-position of the carbapenem ring is bonded to the carbon atom on the aromatic heterocycle through a suitable spacer.
      <br/>
      None of these publications disclose carbapenem derivatives bonded to a bicyclic aromatic heterocycle.
    </p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="9">The present inventors have now succeeded in synthesizing carbapenem derivatives having a substituted or unsubstituted imidazo�5,1-b�thiazole or substituted imidazo�5,1-b�thiazolium group at the 2-position of the carbapenem ring through a pyrrolidinylthio group (optionally through a pyrrolidinylthio group with a spacer).</p>

    <p num="1163">The stability of representative compounds, among the novel carbapenem derivatives of the present invention, against kidney dehydropeptidase-I (DHP-I) of a pig and a mouse was measured, and the residue (%) of the carbapenem derivatives three hr after the initiation of the test is summarized in Table 6.</p>
    <p num="1164">The stability against DHP-I was measured according to the following method.</p>
    <p num="1165">1. Preparation of DHP-I from kidney acetone powder of each animal.</p>
    <p num="1166">
      1.5 g of a kidney acetone powder (manufactured by Sigma) Porcine Type II (Lot. 33H7225) was suspended in 100 ml of 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.0) containing 20% butanol, and the suspension was stirred at 5 (degree)  C. for 48 hr. The suspension was then dialyzed against 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.0) (a cellulose tube 30/32 Viskase Sales Corp.) until the odor of butanol disappeared, thereby removing butanol.
      <br/>
      The dialyzate is centrifuged at 10000 * g (KUBOTA 6800) for 20 min, and the supernatant was obtained as a partially purified DHP-I.
      <br/>
      This partially purified DHP-I was subdivided and stored at -80 (degree)  C. The above procedure was repeated, except that 1.5 g of Mouse (Lot. 23F8105) was used.
      <br/>
      Thus, a partially purified DHP-I was prepared and stored.
    </p>
    <p num="1167">2. Measurement of stability against each DHP-I.</p>
    <p num="1168">
      For the carbapenem as the substrate agent, a solution (2000  MU g (potency)/ml) was prepared using sterilized, purified water.
      <br/>
      For the sample solution, the carbapenem (2000  MU g (potency)/ml) solution was added to the partially purified DHP-I of each animal to a final concentration of 100  MU g (potency)/ml).
      <br/>
      For the blank, 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.0) was used instead of the partially purified DHP-I of each animal.
      <br/>
      The reaction was allowed to proceed at 37 (degree)  C. for 3 hr, and a given amount of the reaction mixture was sampled.
      <br/>
      Methanol in the same amount as the sampled reaction mixture was added under ice cooling to terminate the reaction.
      <br/>
      The reaction mixture was filtered through a filter (Sanprep LCR 13-LH manufactured by MILLIPORE) and subjected to HPLC (column: CAPCELL PACK C18SG120, manufactured by Shiseido Co., Ltd.; detection: UV; mobile layer: acetonitrile/10 mM aqueous acetic acid solution) to determined the residue (%).
