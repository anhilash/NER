    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="3">
      As DRAMs increase in memory cell density, there is a continuing challenge to maintain sufficiently high storage capacitance despite decreasing cell area.
      <br/>
      Additionally, there is a continuing goal to further decrease cell area.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      The principal way of increasing cell capacitance is through cell structure techniques.
      <br/>
      Such techniques include three-dimensional cell capacitors, such as trenched or stacked capacitors.
      <br/>
      This invention concerns stacked capacitor cell constructions, including what are commonly known as crown or cylindrical container stacked capacitors.

    <p num="10">Capacitor and conductive line constructions produced according to the above and other methods are also disclosed.</p>
    <p num="11">
      A semiconductor processing method of forming a capacitor construction is first described with reference to FIG. 1 where a semiconductor wafer in process is indicated generally with reference numeral 10.
      <br/>
      Such comprises a bulk monocrystalline silicon substrate 12 and electrically isolating field oxide regions 14.
      <br/>
      Active area 16 lies therebetween.
      <br/>
      A stack of layers is shown for formation of a plurality of electrically conductive gate lines for fabrication of DRAM circuitry.
      <br/>
      Specifically, a layer 18 comprises a gate oxide layer, and a layer 20 comprises conductively doped polysilicon, a layer 22 comprises a higher conductivity silicide, such as WSix.
      <br/>
      Example thicknesses for layers 18, 20 and 22 are 90 Angstroms, 1500 Angstroms, and 1200 Angstroms, respectively.
      <br/>
      First and second capping layers 24 and 26, respectively, are provided outwardly of silicide layer 22.
      <br/>
      Purposes thereof will be apparent subsequently.
      <br/>
      A preferred material for layer 24 is Si3 N4, while a preferred material for layer 26 is undoped SiO2.
      <br/>
      Example preferred thicknesses for layers 24 and 26 are 2000 Angstroms each.
      <br/>
      Although not shown, a thin layer of oxide (i.e., 350 Angstroms) would preferably also be provided between layers 22 and 24.
    </p>
    <p num="12">
      Referring to FIG. 2, the composite layers are collectively patterned to form the illustrated conductive line stacks 27, 28, 29 and 30.
      <br/>
      Such comprise respective conductive portions 31, 32, 33 and 34, with the remaining respective portions thereof in the preferred embodiment constituting electrically insulative material.
      <br/>
      The discussion proceeds with reference to electrically conductive line pairs 31 and 32.
      <br/>
      In the preferred embodiment, identical processing also occurs relative to conductive line pair 33 and 34, as will be apparent.
      <br/>
      Electrically conductive lines 31 and 32 have respective outermost surfaces 35 and 36 which are effectively insulated by first capping layer 24.
      <br/>
      The patterned capping layer 24 forms respective first electrically insulative caps 37 and 38 over outer surfaces 35 and 36, effectively providing electrical insulation thereof.
      <br/>
      Patterned second capping layer 26 defines respective second caps 39 and 40 over first caps 37 and 38, respectively.
      <br/>
      Second caps 39 and 40 are preferably chosen to comprise a material which is selectively etchable relative to that of first caps 37 and 38.
    </p>
    <p num="13">
      Referring to FIG. 3, an electrically insulative spacer layer 42 is deposited.
      <br/>
      An example and preferred material is Si3 N4 deposited to an example thickness of 700 Angstroms.
    </p>
    <p num="14">
      Referring to FIG. 4, the spacer layer 42 is anisotropically etched to provide a pair of sidewall spacers 43, 44 laterally outward of conductive line 31, first cap 37 and second cap 39, and also a pair of sidewall spacers 45 and 46 laterally outward of conductive line 32, first cap 38 and second cap 40.
      <br/>
      The material of second caps 39 and 40 is advantageously chosen to be selectively etchable relative to sidewall spacers 43, 44, 45 and 46.
      <br/>
      Most preferred, first caps 37 and 38 are chosen to constitute the same predominant Si3 N4 material as spacers 43, 44, 45 and 46.
    </p>
    <p num="15">
      Diffusion regions 52, 54 and 56 are at some point provided relative to bulk substrate 12, as shown.
      <br/>
      Region 54 comprises a shared bit contact node for a bit line in accordance with fabrication of a DRAM array, whereas diffusion regions 52 and 56 constitute respective nodes to which electrical connection to a capacitor is to be made.
      <br/>
      Thus with respect to the above continuing discussion, diffusion region 52 constitutes a capacitor connection node provided between pair of conductive lines 31 and 32.
      <br/>
      The sidewall spacers 44 and 45 of each of the two described pairs of sidewall spacers are closer to node 52 than the other sidewall spacers 43 and 46 of each respective pair.
    </p>
    <p num="16">
      Referring to FIG. 5, second caps 39 and 40 are etched between the respective pairs of sidewall spacers 43, 44 and 45, 46, and selectively relative to first caps 37 and 38 to form recesses 48 and 50 over the pair of conductive lines 31 and 32, respectively, relative to sidewall spacers 43, 44 and 45, 46, respectively.
      <br/>
      Thus, material is etched over the pair of conductive lines between the respective spacers, which in the preferred embodiment comprises an electrically insulative material of SiO2.
      <br/>
      Further, outermost conductive line surfaces 35 and 36 remain electrically insulated by material 24 after the etching step.
    </p>
    <p num="17">
      Referring to FIG. 6, an electrically insulating layer 60 is deposited and planarized outwardly relative to conductive lines 31 and 32, and within recesses 48 and 50.
      <br/>
      An example and preferred material for layer 60 is borophosphosilicate glass (BPSG).
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      Referring to FIG. 7, insulating layer 60 is patterned and etched to define a capacitor container opening 62 therethrough relative to node 52.
      <br/>
      Capacitor opening 62 is patterned to have a pair of outer lateral sidewalls 63 and 64.
      <br/>
      Lateral sidewall 63 is positioned or received within the lateral confines of sidewall spacers 45 and 46, while lateral sidewall 64 is positioned or received within the lateral confines of sidewall spacers 43 and 44.
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      Referring to FIG. 8, an electrically conductive capacitor plate layer 65 is deposited over electrically insulating layer 60 and within capacitor opening 62, and accordingly over node 52, at least the one sidewall spacers 44 and 45 and within respective recesses 48 and 50.
      <br/>
      A preferred composition for layer 65 is conductively doped polysilicon.
    </p>
    <p num="20">
      Referring to FIG. 9, layer 65 is preferably chemical-mechanical polished (CMPed) to effectively define a first capacitor plate 66 effectively in the shape of a container.
      <br/>
      The recessing or etching of material between the illustrated sidewall spacers effectively results in layer 65 serpentining thereover, thus increasing surface area over that which would otherwise occur were such recesses not provided.
      <br/>
      Further in accordance with the preferred process, container 66 effectively includes sidewalls 68 and 70 which effectively project outwardly relative to conductive lines 31 and 32 within the lateral confines of respective recesses 48 and 50 between pairs of sidewall spacers 43, 44 and 45, 46, respectively.
    </p>
    <p num="21">
      Referring to FIG. 10, a capacitor dielectric layer 75 and a second capacitor plate layer 80 are provided over patterned first capacitor plate 65/66.
      <br/>
      A preferred material for layer 75 is an oxide, an ONO composite or a ferroelectric material.
      <br/>
      Layer 80 preferably constitutes conductively doped polysilicon.
      <br/>
      Processing would typically proceed in the fabrication of a DRAM array by patterning and isolating a contact opening through layers 80 and 75 over and to node 54.
      <br/>
      The opening would then be preferably separately plugged with tungsten.
      <br/>
      Subsequently, an electrically conductive layer would be deposited and patterned for fabrication of a bit line which ohmically connects with the plug.
    </p>
    <p num="22">Although the invention primarily spawned from concerns associated with maximizing capacitance in a capacitor construction, the artisan will appreciate applicability of the invention relative to fabrication of and resultant electrically conductive lines apart from capacitor fabrication.</p>
    <p num="23">
      The above described embodiment etched capping layer 26/caps 39, 40 without any masking of such capping material between the respective pairs of sidewall spacers.
      <br/>
      An alternate and preferred embodiment whereby some of said material between the respective pairs of sidewall spacers is masked during etching is described during with reference to FIGS. 11-13. Like numerals from the first described embodiment are utilized where appropriate, with differences being indicated by the suffix "b" or with different numerals.
    </p>
    <p num="24">
      FIG. 11 illustrates a wafer fragment 10b shown at a processing step subsequent to that depicted by FIG. 4 of the first described embodiment.
      <br/>
      Here, second capping layer 26/caps 39, 40 are not etched selectively relative to the sidewall spacers prior to provision of planarized electrically insulating layer 60b.
    </p>
    <p num="25">
      Referring to FIG. 12, the mask and etching utilized to produce capacitor container opening 62 also comprises etching of material 26 to produce recesses 48b and 50b in the same essential step utilized to produce the capacitor container opening.
      <br/>
      Thus in the first described embodiment, recesses 48 and 50 extend completely across the respective conductive lines between the respective sidewall spacers.
      <br/>
      In the FIGS. 11-13 embodiment, recesses 48b and 50b extend only partially across the respective lines between the respective sidewall spacers.
    </p>
    <p num="26">FIG. 13 illustrates resultant patterning to produce the same essential construction as the first described embodiment, but for remaining second caps 39b and 40b spanning only a portion of the line width, and thus providing a gap between the respective inner sidewall spacers and the respective cap 39b or 40b.</p>
    <p num="27">This second described embodiment is preferred over the first described embodiment in leaving gate oxide over the substrate area, such as the area over diffusion region 54, until such time as the substrate area is exposed for electrical contact therewith.</p>
    <p num="28">
      In compliance with the statute, the invention has been described in language more or less specific as to structural and methodical features.
      <br/>
      It is to be understood, however, that the invention is not limited to the specific features shown and described, since the means herein disclosed comprise preferred forms of putting the invention into effect.
