    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">
      The prior art for electromagnetic drillstring telemetry is based upon inductive (toroidal) or direct coupling of a source signal carrying the downhole sensor information to the drillstring and surrounding formation.
      <br/>
      Toroidal coupled systems induce a modulated electric current on the drillstring by means of electromagnetic coupling between a (primary) toroidal coil encircling a conductive mandrel connected to the drillstring, and a secondary coil comprising the drillstring, and surrounding formation.
      <br/>
      The modulated current, which is induced in the secondary, flows along the drillstring and drilling fluid, and through the formation in a pattern, which is governed by the electrical conductivity(s) of the drillstring and drilling fluid, and surrounding formation.
      <br/>
      The flow of current on the drillstring and through the formation is measured by a receiving apparatus at the surface.
    </p>
    <p num="3">
      The receiving apparatus is either inductively coupled to the modulated current through a transformer or directly coupled by sensing the potential difference (voltage) produced by the flow of modulated current between electrodes "grounded" at the surface.
      <br/>
      A previous patent (U.S. Pat. No. 4,181,014 to Zuvela et al.) describes several means of signal reception using sub-surface electrodes connected to the surface by insulated conductors. (See also U.S. Pat. No. 4,980,682 to Klein et al.)
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      The operation of the inductively coupled (toroidal) downhole transmitter-receiver (transceiver) is enhanced by insulating gaps in the downhole transceiver sub-assembly to isolate the toroidal primary coil from the surrounding drill collar (which would otherwise provide a direct short to the secondary, if it were not electrically isolated).
      <br/>
      The toroidal-inducing coil encircles an electrically conducting mandrel, which is mechanically and electrically connected to the upper and lower sections of drillstring.
      <br/>
      The toroidal sub-assembly and associated electronics are designed to provide impedance matching between the source circuitry and the load of the drillstring-formation circuit (U.S. Pat. No. 4,496,174 to McDonald et al., 1985).
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      In the prior art, the source impedance may be matched with the load using matching transformers (U.S. Pat. No. 2,389,241 to Silverman, 1944; U.S. Pat. No. 4,691,203 to Rubin, 1987).
      <br/>
      Matching transformers and associated complex electrical circuitry are employed to match the impedance of the downhole sub-assembly electronics to the very low impedance associated with the small gaps necessary to maintain the mechanical stability of the downhole transceiver sub-assembly.
      <br/>
      One of the herein inventors has previously patented an apparatus for electromechanical impedance matching (U.S. Pat. No. 5,130,706 to Van Steenwyk, 1992).
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      Transformer coupled electric-field telemetry systems require that the signal information be transmitted by various forms of modulation of a carrier signal.
      <br/>
      Pulse modulated systems have been described (U.S. Pat. No. 3,046,474 to Arps, 1962; U.S. Pat. No. 4,015,234 to Krebs, 1977); but these systems have required the generation of a very high-voltage pulse by means of capacitor discharge to overcome the poor impedance match between the downhole transmitter and the drillstring-formation load impedance.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      More recently, a low-voltage, low-impedance, current generator has been described (U.S. Pat. No. 5,270,703 to Guest).
      <br/>
      It should be noted that none of these methods for coupling a pulse to the drillstring-formation path are suited to a talk-down capability.
      <br/>
      See also U.S. Pat. No. 4,684,946 to Geoservice.

    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="8">
      The present invention relates to a method and apparatus to improve the effectiveness of electric-field borehole telemetry.
      <br/>
      A direct-coupled electromagnetic telemetry system is provided in which the downhole source drives a modulated electric current directly into the underground formation by means of a modulated voltage or current applied across an electrically insulating gap created in the drillstring by one or more gap sub-assemblies.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      Another aspect of the invention is directed to the use of insulating drill collars and wireline components, to match the downhole impedance of electric signal transmitter circuitry to the electrical impedance of the surrounding drilling fluids and geologic formations.
      <br/>
      By means of this aspect of the invention, downhole power requirements can be significantly reduced.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      Another feature of the invention is the use of the downhole electric fields generated by the telemetry apparatus for formation resistivity and induced polarization measurements.
      <br/>
      By using insulating drill collars and wireline components to vary transmitter and receiver electrode spacing and configuration, many of the methods of surface resistivity and induced polarization available to surface geophysics can be deployed on the drillstring, in conjunction with a downhole electric field telemetry system.
    </p>
    <p num="11">
      The invention provides a method and apparatus to configure an insulating gap in a drillstring or borehole casing, so as to enable the generation or detection of electric fields on the surface of the drillstring or borehole casing.
      <br/>
      The method can be used in the transmission of downhole measurements and drilling parameters from the drillstring to the surface, the transmission of control signals from the surface to any point on the drillstring, and the evaluation of resistivity and induced polarization response of the formation surrounding the drillstring, formation at the bit, or formation surrounding a cased borehole.

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
    <p num="14">
      The mechanical limitations imposed by the prior art of toroidal coupled borehole telemetry systems, and the difficulties in matching the drillstring-formation impedance of a short-gap, direct-coupled system are addressed by the present invention.
      <br/>
      By providing insulated drill collars or gap sub-assemblies used in conjunction with electric current supplying components and circuits, the invention provides direct coupled impedance matching, optimum location of the transmission gap in complex geologic systems, and the integration of formation evaluation geo-steering, and downhole telemetry, in a single system.
    </p>
    <p num="15">
      In certain embodiments of the invention, a direct coupled impedance match, or near match, to the drillstring-formation transmission path is provided.
      <br/>
      By proper selection of one or more insulated drill collars or gap sub-assemblies and conventional drill collars, the drillstring is configured to present an electrical impedance match between the downhole electric-field telemetry system and the surrounding formation.
      <br/>
      An insulated wireline may connect upper and lower sub-assemblies for completing an electrical circuit comprised of the upper drillstring, power source, wireline, bottom hole assembly, and formation.
    </p>
    <p num="16">
      A block diagram of the invention is shown in FIG. 1a. A downhole transceiver 100 transmits at 101 either drilling parameters or the results of formation evaluation measurements to a transceiver 102 at the surface, or receives signals from a surface transmitter for power management or other control requirements.
      <br/>
      Note transducers or sensors 103, 103a, and 104 supplying data to the transreceiver.
      <br/>
      The same instrumentation is used for both downhole telemetry and evaluation of formation resistivity and induced polarization (IP) response.
      <br/>
      Note transmission line 105 from 102 to 100.

    <p num="17">
      FIG. 1b shows the invention in a measurement-while-drilling (MWD) application.
      <br/>
      A bent sub-assembly means 302 in the drillstring provides directional control for the drilling operations.
      <br/>
      Voltage application apparatus is shown in the string and includes battery 24, insulated wireline 305, connected at connections 314 and 315 to upper and lower instrument housings 311 and 312, which house components, such as batteries, sensors and switching apparatus.
      <br/>
      Voltage or current is applied by electrical contact means 306 and 304 to the drillstring, and then to the formation.
      <br/>
      A borehole drill motor 313 is shown in the string above the drill bit 316.
      <br/>
      Upper extent of the string is indicated at 22, and the borehole appears at 22a, in formation 22b.
      <br/>
      A circuitry housing appears at 307.
      <br/>
      Surface equipment appears at 22c.
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      FIGS. 2a, 2b and 2c illustrate three possible configurations of the system used as a means of downhole electric-field telemetry.
      <br/>
      In each configuration, a voltage is impressed across an insulated drill collar 1, between upper and lower steel drillstring sections 4 and 5, and drives an electric current through the earth 2.
      <br/>
      In configuration of FIG. 2a, a power source 3 is connected across an upper section 4 of the drillstring, and a lower section 5 of the drillstring, as by wireline components 6 and a signal source (modulator) indicated as a switch 7, which opens and closes as a function of data to be transmitted, as via a path defined by the drillstring 4 and 5, and the formation 2.
      <br/>
      Sections 4 and 5 are typically metallic (steel), and collar 1 is in series with 4 and 5.
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      Signals are detected at the surface of the earth by a receiver 8, which measures the voltage produced by the downhole transmitter, as between two electrodes associated with 8 at the surface.
      <br/>
      Receiver 8 is in a line 8a connected between the upper end of the string 4 and 9a, and a probe 9 into the earth.
      <br/>
      Note the possible connection 9b to the steel casing in the borehole.
      <br/>
      In the configurations shown, one electrode comprises an electrical attachment to the drillstring, and the other electrode 9 is connected directly to the earth.
    </p>
    <p num="20">
      In FIG. 2b, the insulating section 1 of the drillstring is positioned above the level of a high resistive layer 10 of the formation through which wireline components extend, thus permitting the transmission of downhole information through an insulating geologic formation.
      <br/>
      Note connection at 6a of line 6 to string section 5a extending below 10, and connection at 6b to string section 4b above 1.
      <br/>
      The drillstring sections 4b and 5a consist of steel.
      <br/>
      Borehole casing is indicated at 4a.
    </p>
    <p num="21">
      In FIG. 2c, multiple metallic sections 4b, 4c, 5a, and 5c of the drillstring are interconnected by insulated sections or collars 1 and 1a.
      <br/>
      An electrical line 6 interconnects 4b and 5a to provide an impedance match and to extend the effective length of the insulating gap.
      <br/>
      Other elements remain as shown in FIG. 2b. Current flow in the formation appears at 400 and 401.
    </p>
    <p num="22">
      An alternate means of telemetry from a downhole location to the surface is implemented by modulating the impedance of the entire assembly as measured from surface connections 9 and 9a.
      <br/>
      A downhole means for alternately electrically connecting and disconnecting portions of the drillstring is provided by using an appropriately positioned gap or gaps 1 in the drillstring sections electrically connected by insulated wireline components 6 and a switching means 7.
      <br/>
      In this method, the only electrical power required for this means of downhole telemetry is that required for the operation of the electrical switch, thus eliminating the need for downhole power source 3.

      Note that voltage difference e1 --e2 is maintained by current flow ig across the gap 17a.

      The voltage across the gap is determined largely by the downhole source voltage at 14, the internal resistance 15 of the source 14 and wireline 16, and the resistance 18 of the fluids (mud) in the annulus surrounding the gap sub-assembly.
      <br/>
      The voltage across the gap drives a current ie into the earth 2.
      <br/>
      This flow of current at the surfaces produces a voltage drop (V1) across the resistance 21 of the earth at the surface.
      <br/>
      The voltage V1 is measured by the receiver electronics.

      In addition to downhole telemetry, the invention provides a means for evaluation of resistivity and induced polarization (IP) response at the bit, in the formation surrounding the drillstring or in the formation surrounding a cased borehole.
      <br/>
      By generating an electric field in the surrounding medium, i.e., formation, and with multiple current or voltage-sensing electrodes placed on the drillstring, at the bit, or on the casing of a cased borehole, the resistivity and IP response of the surrounding medium can be measured.
    </p>
    <p num="28">
      To evaluate formation resistivity and IP response at and directly ahead of the bit, a voltage pulse waveform, or a set of selected frequencies, is applied across an impedance matched insulated gap or gaps in the drillstring and drill collars configured as shown in FIG. 5.
      <br/>
      The bulk resistivity of the formation surrounding the insulated gap, drill collar or motor, bit-box, and bit can then be determined by well known data reduction methods for geophysical interpretation of formation resistivity and IP response.
      <br/>
      The resistivity at the bit is analytically separated from the bulk resistivity surrounding the bottom hole assembly by noting that, as the bottom hole assembly passes through a formation and the resistivity is measured, changes in the bulk resistivity will be due to resistivity changes at the bit.

    <p num="54">
      1) A means for the generation of low voltage electrical pulses to carry the signal information and thereby reduce the danger of electrical breakdown and discharge in the wellbore.
      <br/>
      In the prior art of direct coupled systems, the impedance mismatch between the source and surrounding formation was sometimes overcome by generating extremely high voltage pulses by the charging of a downhole capacitor.
      <br/>
      By reducing the required voltage, the present novel configuration reduces the hazard of such wellbore discharges.

    <p num="55">
      2) The generation of easily controlled and synthesized low voltage pulse waveforms also permits the application of recent advances in digital i.e. start duration wave-form signal processing to the detection of low-level signals in the presence of natural and man-made noise.
      <br/>
      Digital signal processing contemplates pulses or waveforms of less than 200 ms duration, and which may incorporate polarity reversal.

    <p num="56">
      3) The improved detection of synthesized waveforms permits Wavelet signal processing for the interpretation of low level signals.

      Wavelet analysis is a relatively new method of signal processing, which permits efficient "de-noising" of broad-band signals (see Daubechies, I, 1992, "Ten Lectures on Wavelets", Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics).

      <br/>
      The choice of surface electrode combinations may change during the drilling operation.
