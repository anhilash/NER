    <p num="3">The present invention relates to analogs of biologically active, naturally occurring polyamines having a wide variety of therapeutic properties, as well as pharmaceutical compositions containing the analogs and their use in methods of therapeutic treatment.</p>
    <heading>DISCUSSION OF THE PRIOR ART</heading>
    <p num="4">
      In recent years, a great deal of attention has been focussed on the polyamines, e.g., spermidine, norspermidine, homospermidine, 1,4-diaminobutane (putrescine) and spermine.
      <br/>
      These studies have been largely directed at the biological properties of the polyamines probably because of the role they play in proliferative processes.
      <br/>
      It was shown early on that the polyamine levels in dividing cells, e.g., cancer cells, are much higher than in resting cells.
      <br/>

    </p>
    <p num="5">
      Several lines of evidence indicate that polyamines, particularly spermidine, are required for cell proliferation: (i) they are found in greater amounts in growing than in non-growing tissues; (ii) prokaryotic and eukaryotic mutants deficient in polyamine biosynthesis are auxotrophic for polyamines; and (iii) inhibitors specific for polyamine biosynthesis also inhibit cell growth.
      <br/>
      Despite this evidence, the precise biological role of polyamines in cell proliferation is uncertain.
      <br/>
      It has been suggested that polyamines, by virtue of their charged nature under physiological conditions and their conformational flexibility, might serve to stabilize macromolecules such as nucleic acids by anion neutralization.

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="19">In the polyamines of the invention, as described in the above structural formula, R1 -R6 may be alkyl, e.g., methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, isopropyl, n-butyl, isobutyl, sec-butyl, tert-butyl; aryl, e.g., phenyl, p-tolyl, 2,4,6-trimethyl-phenyl; aryl alkyl, e.g., benzyl,  ALPHA -phenethyl,  BETA -phenethyl; cycloalkyl, e.g., cyclohexyl, cyclobutyl, cyclopentyl, cycloheptyl; any of the foregoing wherein the alkyl chain is interrupted by etheric oxygen, e.g., CH3 O(CH2)2 --, CH3 O(CH2)2 O(CH2)2 --, CH3 O(CH2)2 O(CH2)2 O(CH2)2- ; or hydrogen.</p>
    <p num="20">Except where R1 -R6 are hydrogen or etheric substituents, each are hydrocarbyl and may have from about 1 to about 12 carbon atoms, it being understood that the size of the substituents will be tailored in each case to ensure that the polyamine is capable of uptake by the target cell and, upon uptake, will competitively bind with the intracellular counter-anions as described above.</p>
    <p num="21">The bridging groups A, B and C may be the same or different and may be alkylene having 1-8 carbon atoms, e.g., methylene, trimethylene, tetramethylene, pentamethylene; branched alkylene, e.g., --CH(CH3)CH2 CH2 --, --CH2 CH(CH3)CH2 --, --CH(CH3)CH2 CH2 --, --CH2 CH(CH3)CH2 CH2 --; arylalkylene, e.g., --CH(Ph) CH2 CH2 --, --CH2 CH(Ph) CH2 --, --CH(Ph)CH2 CH2 CH2 --, --CH2 CH(Ph)CH2 --CH2 --; cycloalkylene, e.g., cyclohexylene, cis- and trans-1,3-cyclohexylene, 1,4-cyclohexylene, 1,3-cyclopentylene; heterocyclic groups which incorporate within the ring one of the nitrogen atoms of the polyamine �e.g.,  (Chemical Structure image '3' not included in text)</p>

      If there is any significance to the role of charge interaction in the biological properties of the polyamine analogs, alterations in the polyamine methylene backbone should have significant impact on the compound's biological properties.
      <br/>
      In fact, the significance of charge and the length of the methylene bridges separating the cations in the biological properties of the polyamine analogs has been demonstrated.
      <br/>
      For example, although N1,N12 -diethylspermine (DESPM) is quite active against a variety of tumors in cell culture, when the terminal ethyl groups are replaced by  BETA , BETA , BETA ,-tri-fluoroethyl groups, the anti-neoplastic activity essentially disappears.
      <br/>
      The trifluoroethyl group substantially reduces the pK8 of the terminal nitrogens and they are no longer protonated �J.

      Org. Chem., Vol. 24, "Fluorine containing nitrogen compounds--I Trifluoroethylamines," Bissel et al, pages 1256-1259 (1959)�. Even though the dimensions of bis- BETA , BETA , BETA -trifluoroethylspermine and diethylspermine are essentially the same, what was once a tetracationic spermine analog is now only a dication.
      <br/>
      On comparing the abilities of several polyamines and polyamine analogs to displace ethidium iodide from calf thymus DNA, bis- BETA , BETA , BETA -trifluoroethylspermine (BTFESPM) was found to behave more like putrescine than spermine.
      <br/>
      The same phenomenon is observed when one acetylates a terminal nitrogen of spermine.
      <br/>
      The amide nitrogen is not protonated at physiological pH, and the compound has no anti-neoplastic properties and behaves very much like spermidine in displacing ethidium iodide from DNA.

      Perhaps the most impressive finding regarding the separation of charge is associated with S-acetyltransferase (SAT), an enzyme responsible for the N-terminal acetylation of spermine and spermidine.

Extracting a single methylene from each of the three methylene bridges of DEHSPM substantially increases the ability of the analog to stimulate SAT up-regulation, DEHSPM has little impact on SAT levels, while DESPM up-regulates the enzyme by a factor of 200 and DENSPM by 1,200 fold.
      <br/>
      Although each of the tetraamines is a closely related linear tetracation at physiological pH, each provides a different signal to the cell.
      <br/>
      While DEHSPM has three 4-methylene bridges and little SAT-stimulating activity, DESPM which has a single central 4-methylene bridge and two terminal 3-methylene bridges is a more active SAT-stimulating factor.
      <br/>
      DENSPM has three 3-methylene bridges and is the most active SAT stimulator.
      <br/>
      Presumably, the cell then "reads the charge distribution" on the polyamines.
      <br/>
      This suggests that the key issue in the polyamine analogue's activity is the distance between the charged centers and not the nature of the groups separating these centers, "the insulators." However, that this was indeed the case required proof.

      The total concentration of polyamines in cation equivalents, as well as the ratios of the various polyamines, is very tightly regulated and, when this equilibrium is disturbed, the cell acts quickly to re-adjust.
      <br/>
      For example, when polyamine analogs are incorporated, these dynamics are disrupted and the cell responds by either excreting polyamines in the free state or by first acetylating them, followed by excretion of the N1 -acetyl compounds �J.

      The analogs appear to the cell as normal polyamines and provide many of the same regulatory messages that the natural polyamines do.
      <br/>
      As analog concentration increases in the cell, the following events ensue.
      <br/>
      Polyamine biosynthesis is down-regulated, just as when cells are grown in exogenous polyamines.
      <br/>
      The levels of ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) and S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase (AdoMETDC) are drastically reduced just as with the normal negative polyamine feedback control.
      <br/>
      Analogs with aminopropyl groups cause a marked increase in S-acetyl transferase (SAT).
      <br/>
      Once again, the issues are how the cell reads the charge distribution on the polyamines and how does it translate this information into regulatory events.
      <br/>
      The answers to both of these questions will allow one to define the structural boundary conditions for the general design of polyamine anti-neoplastics.
      <br/>
      Two fundamental issues needed to be addressed regarding the general structural requirements for anti-neoplastic polyamines: (1) Are the cationic centers really key to the compound's anti-neoplastic activity or are the nitrogen centers simply enough, and (2) what are the boundary conditions on the insulators, e.g., bridging groups separating the nitrogen or cationic centers?
    </p>
    <p num="31">
      The first question can be answered by comparing two polyamines with essentially the same distance between the nitrogens, but with different pKa values on spatially equivalent nitrogens.
      <br/>
      While the bis- BETA , BETA , BETA -trifluoroethyl analogue of N1, N12 -diethylspermine strongly suggested that charge was significant in polyamine analogue activity, additional examples had to be developed.
      <br/>
      In particular, examples were utilized in which other than simple methylene insulators were employed.

      The results of Table 1 clearly indicate that the nitrogen cationic centers are required for anti-neoplastic activity and not simply a nitrogen center.
      <br/>
      The pyridine compounds have their nitrogen separated by distances very similar to those in the corresponding piperidine systems.
      <br/>
      The major difference is, at physiological pH, the pyridine compounds are not substantially protonated at the pyridine nitrogens.
      <br/>
      This means that the piperidine compounds are tetracations at physiological pH, while the pyridines are dications.
      <br/>
      The dications, unlike the corresponding reduced and acyclic linear molecules, are not active against L1210 cells.

      Whether the cations can be insulated from each other by other than a methylene bridge, e.g., a more rigid cyclic backbone, while still maintaining the activity of the compound is a question important not only to an understanding of how cells process information on the polycations, but also to the design of improved therapeutics.
      <br/>
      If a variety of other aliphatic systems can be substituted for the methylene bridges in the polyamines, it is possible to alter not only the metabolic properties of the polyamine anti-neoplastics, but also their organ distribution and clearance properties.
      <br/>
      The data set forth in Table 2 further indicates that simple linear insulators are not a strict requirement for polyamine analogue anti-neoplastic activity.
      <br/>
      The results suggest that the polyamine nitrogens can be incorporated into a cyclic backbone.

      This observation was further investigated to verify that nitrogen insulators could also be cyclic alkyl groups.

      Table 2 clearly indicates that this is true.

      The intention is that the cell should incorporate these compounds via the polyamine's transport apparatus and that these analogues should find their way to the same sub-cellular distribution sites that the naturally occurring polyamines do, but once there, because of subtle alterations in the molecules, they should be unable to be further processed.
      <br/>
      The inability of the polyamines to be further processed is largely related to the fact that the terminal nitrogens in the active compounds are alkylated and unable to be acetylated by SAT.

Chem., Vol. 56, Bergeron et al, supra; and CRC Handbook on Microbial Iron Chelates, Bergeron et al, supra� were not designed for polyamine bridge expansions, but for the introduction of different alkyl groups at different nitrogens in the triamines or tetraamines.
      <br/>
      However, it has been recently shown that many of the simple terminally dialkylated polyamine analogs of interest can be accessed via the appropriate tosylamide.
      <br/>
      For example, to synthesize DESPM, spermine is first tosylated and then monoalkylated at each terminal tosylamide by treatment with sodium hydride and ethyl iodide.
      <br/>
      The tosyl groups are then removed under conditions of dissolving metal reduction.
      <br/>
      The shortcomings of the procedure are three-fold: (1) the alkylation must be symmetrical, i.e., the same alkyl group must be fixed to both terminal nitrogens, (2) the methylene insulators between the nitrogens are regulated by the availability of the starting polyamine, and (3) removal of the tosyl protecting group proceeds in low yield.
    </p>
    <p num="39">
      A more satisfactory alternative involves formation of the appropriate tetramesitylenesulfonamides, which can be alkylated in high yields and the tetramesitylenesulfonyl (MES) protecting groups quantitatively removed by treatment with 30% HBr in acetic acid and phenol (FIG. 1).
      <br/>
      This approach eliminates the low yield problem associated with removal of the tosyl protecting group under dissolving metal reduction conditions.
      <br/>
      The MES methodology has been extended to a symmetrical "segmented synthesis" which allows for the facile alteration of the methylene backbone (FIG. 2).
    </p>
    <p num="40">
      The segmented approach to constructing polyamine analogs offers numerous advantages in terms of flexibility and high yields.
      <br/>
      The procedure begins with mesitylenesulfonation of a primary amine providing (1), followed by alkylation of (1) with an excess of the appropriate dihalide (FIG. 2).
      <br/>
      The resulting halosulfonamide (2) can then be utilized to alkylate the disulfonamides, e.g., (3).
      <br/>
      The tetrasulfonamide (4) is treated with HBr/HOAc/PhOH to remove the mesitylenesulfonamide protecting groups.
      <br/>
      The resulting bromide is converted to the corresponding HCl salts.
      <br/>
      Thus, the limitations associated with the availability of the starting tetraamine have been eliminated, as well as removal of the tosyl protecting group.
      <br/>
      In addition, the earlier method was limited to terminal primary alkyl groups because of poor yields when alkylating with secondary and tertiary halides.
