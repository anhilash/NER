      The present invention relates to an electrophotographic photosensitive member, and a process cartridge and an electrophotographic apparatus provided with the electrophotographic photosensitive member.
      <br/>
      In more detail, the present invention relates to an electrophotographic photosensitive member having a surface layer containing a specified resin, and a process cartridge and an electrophotographic apparatus provided with the electrophotographic photosensitive member.
    </p>
    <p num="3">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
    <p num="4">
      Electrophotographic photosensitive members (OPC photosensitive members) containing organic photoconductive compounds have been aggressively developed in the recent years.
      <br/>
      For example, U.S. Pat. No. 3,837,851 discloses a photosensitive member provided with a charge transfer layer containing triarylpyrazoline, while U.S. Pat. No. 3,871,880 discloses a photosensitive member provided with a charge generation layer containing perylene pigment derivatives and a charge transfer layer containing condensates of 3-propylene and formaldehyde.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      Each of the organic photoconductive compounds has a different photosensitive wavelength region depending on the species of the compound.
      <br/>
      For example, Japanese Patent Laid-Open Nos. 61-272754 and 56-167759 disclose azo pigments having a high sensitivity in the visible region and Japanese Patent Laid-Open Nos. 57-19576 and 61-228453 disclose compounds having a high sensitivity in the infrared region.
    </p>
    <p num="6">Among these compounds, those having a high sensitivity in the infrared region have been used for laser beam printers and LED printers.</p>
    <p num="7">Meanwhile, the electrophotographic photosensitive member is naturally required to possess a proper sensitivity, electrical characteristic and mechanical characteristic in addition to optical characteristic to comply with the applied electrophotographic process.</p>
    <p num="8">Especially, since electrical and mechanical stresses are directly and repeatedly impressed to the electrophotographic photosensitive member for repeated use, durabilities against these stresses are also required.</p>
    <p num="9">For example, durabilities against chemical deterioration by ozone and nitrogen oxides generated during charging or against electrical and mechanical degradation such as surface abrasion and flaw caused by discharge and cleaning are required.</p>
    <p num="10">The OPC photosensitive member is in particular composed of a substance so soft as compared with inorganic photosensitive members that durability against mechanical degradation is especially needed.</p>
    <p num="11">
      The foregoing problems evidently occurs in the contact charging method being developed as a leading technology in recent years and disclosed in Japanese Patent Laid-Open Nos. 57-17826 and 58-40566, wherein the electrophotographic photosensitive member is charged by impressing a voltage on a charging member disposed in direct contact with the electrophotographic photosensitive member.
      <br/>
      This contact charging method has several advantages such as generating extremely small amounts of ozone as compared with scorotrons or being very economical without waste electricity in contrast to scorotrons in which about 80% of the current fed to a charger flows through the shield.
    </p>
    <p num="12">
      However, an improved mechanical strength is required for the electrophotographic photosensitive member because the charging member makes a direct contact with the electrophotographic photosensitive member.
      <br/>
      It is proposed, on the other hand, to use a voltage in which a direct current (DC) voltage is superimposed on an alternating current (AC) voltage as an impressed voltage in order to improve charging stability since the contact charging method also depends on charging by discharge (Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 63-149668).
    </p>
    <p num="13">
      Although this charging method enables one to improve charging stability, use of the AC voltage increases the amount of electric current flowing through the electrophotographic photosensitive member.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, the amount of abrasion of the electrophotographic photosensitive member may increase.
      <br/>
      As hitherto described, not only mechanical strength but also electrical strength, along with durability against solvent cracks caused by adhesion of a mechanical oil and hand grease, are required for the electrophotographic photosensitive member.
    </p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="14">The object of the present invention is to provide an electrophotographic photosensitive member having excellent mechanical durability and electrical durability and having an excellent solvent crack resistance.</p>
    <p num="15">Another object of the present invention is to provide a process cartridge and an electrophotographic apparatus equipped with the electrophotographic photosensitive member described above.</p>
    <p num="16">Accordingly, the present invention provides an electrophotographic photosensitive member comprising a substrate, a photosensitive layer formed thereon, and a surface layer of the electrophotographic photosensitive member containing a polyphenylene resin.</p>

    <p num="56">The FIGURE shows an illustrative construction of a process cartridge having an electrophotographic photosensitive member according to the present invention.</p>
    <p num="57">
      In the FIGURE, the reference numeral 1 corresponds to a drum-shaped electrophotographic photosensitive member according to the present invention that is driven by rotating around the center axis 2 along the direction indicated by the arrow at a prescribed speed.
      <br/>
      The photosensitive member 1 is uniformly charged with a given positive or negative potential around it with a primary charging means 3, followed by being exposed to an exposing light 4 from an exposing means (not shown in the FIGURE) such as a slit exposure or a laser beam scanning exposure.
      <br/>
      Electrostatic latent images are thus successively formed on the peripheral surface on the photosensitive member 1.
    </p>
    <p num="58">
      The electrostatic latent images formed are then developed with a toner at a development means 5.
      <br/>
      The toner developed images are successively transferred to a transfer member 7, fed from a paper feeder (not shown in the drawing) to a space between the photosensitive member 1 and transfer means 6 in synchronization with rotation of the photosensitive member 1, with the transfer means 6.
    </p>
    <p num="59">After image transfer, the transfer member 7 is separated from the surface of the photosensitive member, introduced into an image development means 8 and duplicated matters (copies) are printed out of the apparatus after image development.</p>
    <p num="60">
      The surface of the photosensitive member 1 after image transfer is cleaned by eliminating residual toner after transfer with a cleaning means 9, and after the de-charging treatment with a pre-exposing light 10 from a pre-exposing means (not shown in FIGURE), and the photosensitive member is repeatedly used for forming images.
      <br/>
      When the primary charging means 3 is a contact charging means using, for example, a charging roller, the pre-exposure is not always required.

      A plurality of the construction elements among the electrophotographic photosensitive member 1, primary charging means 3, development means 5 and cleaning means 9 may be integrated into a process cartridge and this process cartridge may be constructed so as to be attachable to and detachable from the main frame of the electrophotographic apparatus such as a copy machine or a beam printer.
      <br/>
      For example, at least one of the primary charging means 3, development means 5 and cleaning means 9 are held to be integrated with the photosensitive member 1 into a cartridge to construct a process cartridge 11 that is attachable to and detachable from the main frame of the apparatus using a guide means such as rails 12 on the main frame.

    <p num="62">The exposing light 4 is a reflection light or transmitted light from an original document, or a light irradiated by scanning a laser beam or by driving a LED array or a liquid crystal shutter array in response to signals generated by reading the original document with a sensor when the electrophotographic apparatus is a copy machine or a printer.</p>
