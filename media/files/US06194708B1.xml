    <heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="1">The present invention relates to a focus-type encode device, more particularly to an improvement over the encode device in U.S. Pat. No. 6,100,519.</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">
      As shown in FIG. 1, the encode device in U.S. Pat. No. 6,100,519 comprises a light emitter 1, an encode wheel 2 and a light detector 3.
      <br/>
      Moreover, a ring-shaped lens 24 is arranged on the incident plane of the encode wheel 2 such that the light from the light emitter 1 and impinging on the incident plane of the encode wheel 2 can be focused by the ring-shaped lens 24.
      <br/>
      A plurality of cylindrical lens 25 with focusing direction vertical to that of the ring-shaped lens 24 are arranged on the exiting plane of the encode wheel 2 such that the light leaving the exiting plane of the encode wheel 2 can be further focused.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the working beam projected toward the chip 31 of the light detector 3 has less interference.
      <br/>
      Moreover, the light detector 3 can be designed to place between the focus point and the lens to prevent the fabrication difficulty and resolution reduction.
    </p>
    <p num="3">
      However, the encode device in above-mentioned application still has some limitations.
      <br/>
      For examples, the incident plane and the exiting plane for the working beam should be aligned with the light emitter 1 and the light detector 3.
      <br/>
      The encode device in above-mentioned application will be not applicable when the light emitter 1 or the light detector 3 is placed on one side of the rim of the encode wheel 2.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      It is an object of the present invention to provide an improvement over the encode device in U.S. Pat. No. 6,100,519. A hollow dent is formed on the center part of the incident plane of the encode wheel.
      <br/>
      The inner circumference of the dent is provided with a ring-shaped lens such that the light impinging on the inner circumference of the dent is focused by the ring-shaped lens.
      <br/>
      The rim of the encode wheel is provided with a plurality of cylindrical lens which are perpendicular to the ring-shaped lens such that the light leaving the encode wheel can be further focused.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the working beam projected toward the chip of the light detector has less interference.

    <heading>DETAIL DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading>
    <p num="7">With reference now to FIGS. 2 and 3, the inventive focus-type encode device comprises a light emitter 1, an encode wheel 2 and a light detector 3.</p>
    <p num="8">
      The encode wheel 2 has a shaft 21 on the center of the incident lane thereof and is rotated by an actuated means such as a tracking ball.
      <br/>
      More particularly, the shaft 21 of the encode wheel 2 is in contact with the tracking ball and has friction with the tracking ball such that the encode wheel 2 will rotates with the tracking ball.
      <br/>
      Moreover, a hollow dent 23 is formed on the center part of the incident plane 22 of the encode wheel 2.
      <br/>
      The inner circumference of the dent 23 is provided with a ring-shaped lens 24 with radius of curvature R (not shown).
      <br/>
      The light of the light emitter 1 is focused when propagating to the lens 24.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      The rim of the encode wheel 2 is provided with a plurality of cylindrical lens 25 which are perpendicular to the ring-shaped lens 24.
      <br/>
      The convex part 253 or the concave part 251 of the cylindrical lens 25 is coated light blocking material or processed by sand grinding such that an opaque region is formed thereon.
      <br/>
      The total reflection angle of two adjacent cylindrical lenses 25 is smaller than 41.8 degree and the curvature radius of the cylindrical lens 25 is R2.
      <br/>
      According to the lens formula 1/f=(1/R1+1/R2)(n-1), the focus length of the length 25 depends on the curvature radius R1 and R2.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      The light detector 3 made of transparent material is arranged between the focal point and the lens and corresponding to the position of the light emitter 1.
      <br/>
      The light detector 3 comprises a pair of photo sensing chips 31 arranged on top and bottom sides respectively, which are functioned to receive the working beam from the rim of the encode wheel 2.
    </p>
    <p num="11">
      The light from the light emitter 1 will be initially focused by the ring-shaped lens 24 when propagating to the inner surface of the dent 23 of the encode wheel 2, and focused again by the cylindrical lens 25 when passing the rim of the encode wheel 2.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the interference will be minimized when the working beams is projected to the chip 31 of the light detector 3.
    </p>
    <p num="12">
      The light emitted from the light source 1 is chopped by the alternative light-transmission part and opaque part of the encode and a working beam is formed wheel when the encode wheel is rotated.
      <br/>
      If the encode wheel 2 is rotated continuously, a sinusoid signal can be generated by the photo sensing chip 31 detecting the working beam.
      <br/>
      As shown in FIG. 4, the quadrant signals (0,0), (0,1), (1,1) and (1,0) are generated by the chip 31 through a rectifying circuit.
    </p>
    <p num="13">
      As shown in FIGS. 5 to 7, the ring-shaped lens 24 can be designed to be as tooth-shaped cylindrical lens (FIG. 5), trapezoid-shaped cylindrical lens (FIG. 6) or rectangular lens (FIG. 7).
      <br/>
      Moreover, the convex part 242 or the concave part 241 is coated with light-blocking material or processed by sand-grinding, thus blocks or reflects the working beam.
    </p>
    <p num="14">To sum up, the inventive encoder can focus the light to the encode wheel with smaller interference and reflect or block the unwanted working beam.</p>
    <p num="15">
      Although the present invention has been described with reference to the preferred embodiment thereof, it will be understood that the invention is not limited to the details thereof.
      <br/>
      Various substitutions and modifications have suggested in the foregoing description, and other will occur to those of ordinary skill in the art.
      <br/>
      Therefore, all such substitutions and modifications are intended to be embraced within the scope of the invention as defined in the appended claims.
