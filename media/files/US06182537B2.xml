      An accessory (10) for a wrench socket (12) is disclosed including a generally cylindrical magnet (32) secured to a generally cylindrical, nonmagnetic, compressible disk (26) which snugly fits within the well (14) and magnetically insulates the magnet (32) from the socket (12).
      <br/>
      The accessory (10) is removably insertable into the socket (12) of any design and model and without need for modification of the socket (12) and captures a spark plug (100) slideably received in the well (14) of the socket (12) to magnetically hold the spark plug (100) captive in the well (14) as the socket (12) is moved to the fastening location while not magnetizing the socket (12) or the spark plug (100) sufficiently to be detrimentally magnetically attracted to metal adjacent to the fastening location.
      <br/>
      Specifically, the connecting nut (112) and insulator (104) of the spark plug (100) are insertable through an axial bore (70) formed in the disk (26) for access to the magnet (32).
      <br/>
      In a preferred form, the magnet (32) includes an axial passage (72) for slideable receipt of the connecting nut (112).
      <br/>
      In a further preferred form, an interconnecting bore (76) extends between the axial bore (70) and the magnet (32) for passage of the connecting nut (112).

    <heading>BACKGROUND</heading>
    <p num="1">The present invention relates generally to accessories for tools for initially holding spark plugs thereto, and particularly to accessories for wrench sockets for initially holding spark plugs captive therein and their method of fabrication.</p>
    <p num="2">
      While installing spark plugs, it is often desirable to maintain the spark plug with the tool until threading is initially underway.
      <br/>
      Often it was necessary to hold the spark plug relative to the tool with one hand while the tool was manipulated with the other hand.
      <br/>
      Because of limitations in space, access to the spark plug by the hand holding the spark plug and also by the tool itself was difficult if not impossible.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, due to the proximity of the hand to the spark plug and the tool, the hand initially holding the spark plug to the tool was especially prone to accidental injury.
      <br/>
      Thus, there is a well known need in the art for methods for temporarily holding the spark plug to the tool until the threading is initially underway.
    </p>
    <p num="3">
      Prior to the present invention, keeper accessories utilized rubber or similar material inserts in the socket to frictionally grip the spark plug.
      <br/>
      However, as frictionally gripping is very dependent upon physical size and coefficient of friction, such approaches have not been entirely satisfactory.
      <br/>
      Specifically, spark plugs have different configurations between manufacturers, which configurations change over time.
      <br/>
      Also, such inserts were especially prone to wear due to their frictional interaction with spark plugs such that physical size changed over time.
      <br/>
      Further, the coefficient of friction also varies with hardness such as the result of temperature or age, environmental conditions such as the presence of grease or oil, and the like.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      Several methods have been devised for the use of magnetic forces to retain fasteners to the tool during fastening or removal of the fasteners.
      <br/>
      However, approaches to use magnetic forces to retain spark plugs to the tool have previously attempted to magnetically attract the body of the spark plug which is the largest magnetic material mass of the spark plug.
      <br/>
      Acceptance of such prior approaches in the art has been limited due to the inherent deficiencies in such prior approaches.
      <br/>
      For example, many of such approaches required specially manufactured and designed tools to incorporate the spark plug retention feature and thus could not be utilized when the spark plug retention feature was not desired and could not be utilized with standard tools already in use.
      <br/>
      Further, many of such approaches magnetized the entire tool so that the tool was not only magnetically attracted to the spark plug but also to any metal in the path of the tool to the fastening location as well as metal surrounding the fastening location such as an engine block.
      <br/>
      Another approach was to utilize inserts which fit into a larger size of socket for use in installing or removing smaller sized spark plugs corresponding to the size of the insert and not the socket.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, many of such approaches were of complicated, multipiece designs incapable of being economically manufactured and assembled.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      It is thus an object of the present invention to provide a novel accessory for use in a wrench socket without need for modifying the wrench socket and for preventing spark plugs from sliding from the well of the socket to hold the spark plug captive in the well while the socket is being moved to the fastening location and while the spark plug is being initially threaded.
      <br/>
      In this regard, such a tool will be especially helpful in hard-to-get-at fastening locations and at greater efficiencies.
      <br/>
      Further, as many accidents happen when working in such hard-to-get-at fastening locations, the accessory will reduce the exposure of injury to the user's hand which was otherwise required to hold the spark plug in the wrench socket.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, the accessory will reduce the chance of injury due to sharp threads cutting fingers holding the spark plug while trying to initially thread the threaded portion of the spark plug.
      <br/>
      Likewise, the accessory will allow persons having handicaps or other disabilities to utilize wrench sockets in fastening situations which they otherwise were unable to perform.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      It is further an object of the present invention to provide such a novel accessory which captures the spark plug in the well of the socket but also does not magnetize the socket or the spark plug captured therein to such a degree to cause detrimental attraction of the socket and the spark plug to metal surrounding the fastening location.
      <br/>
      For example, the socket and spark plug will not be attracted to the metal block of an engine as it is moved adjacent thereto to the fastening location.
      <br/>
      In this regard, the accessory will increase efficiency and productivity.
      <br/>
      Specifically, the spark plug is captured in the socket in a desired position and will not change orientation and/or fall therefrom due to gravitational forces.
      <br/>
      Thus, threading of the spark plugs is easier to start with one hand operation.
    </p>
    <heading>SUMMARY</heading>
    <p num="7">
      Surprisingly, the above objectives can be satisfied in the field of wrench sockets by providing, in the preferred form, an insert accessory for use in a conventional wrench socket without modification.
      <br/>
      The accessory includes a magnet secured to a nonmagnetic disk in its preferred form by its receipt in a recess formed in the disk.
      <br/>
      The magnet is smaller than the well of the socket.
      <br/>
      The disk snugly fits within the well of the socket and magnetically insulates the magnet from the socket.
    </p>
    <p num="8">In other aspects of the present invention, the magnet is held in the recess of the nonmagnetic disk without requiring the use of glue or adhesive especially when the disk is formed of resilient, compressible material.</p>
    <p num="9">In further aspects of the present invention, the nonmagnetic disk includes an axial bore of a size for slideable receipt of the connecting nut and the insulator of the spark plug, with the magnet being accessible through the axial bore of the nonmagnetic disk and specifically being proximate to the connecting nut when the insulator is received in the axial bore of the nonmagnetic disk.</p>
    <p num="10">In still other aspects of the present invention, the magnet includes an axial passage of a size for slideable receipt of the connecting nut and abuttable with the electrode disk, with the magnet in the most preferred form being annular shaped.</p>
    <p num="11">The present invention will become clearer in light of the following detailed description of illustrative embodiments of this invention described in connection with the drawings.</p>

    <heading>DESCRIPTION</heading>
    <p num="15">
      An accessory for temporarily holding or keeping spark plugs captive with respect to a tool according to the preferred teachings of the present invention is shown in the drawings and generally designated 10.
      <br/>
      In the most preferred form, accessory 10 is utilized in conjunction with a tool in the form of a wrench socket 12.
      <br/>
      Generally, spark plug 100 includes a central conductor 102 extending through an insulator 104.
      <br/>
      A conductive body 106 is suitably secured on the lower portion of insulator 104 and includes a lower threaded portion 108 for threadable receipt such as in an engine head.
      <br/>
      Conductive body 106 further includes a hexagon nut 110 for purposes of receipt of a tool (such as wrench socket 12) allowing threadable receipt or removal of portion 108 into the engine head.
      <br/>
      Lower threaded portion 108 typically includes an integrally attached electrode.
      <br/>
      A connecting nut 112 is threadably received upon central conductor 102 extending beyond the upper end of insulator 104.

      Connecting nut 112 can be formed of conductive material or could be formed of nonconductive material such as aluminum.
      <br/>
      In any case, conductor 102 of spark plug 100 typically includes an electrode disk 114 which abuts with the upper end of insulator 104 and against which connecting nut 112 can be threadably tightened, with disk 114 having a radial size greater than connecting nut 112 at least at the point of abutment.
      <br/>
      Typically, connecting nut 112 has a radial size less than insulator 104 exposed above body 106, with insulator 104 exposed above body 106 in turn having a radial size less than hexagon nut 110.

      Socket 12 can be any standard design generally including a well 14 having a multisided periphery sized to axially slideably receive the corresponding sized nut 110 without allowing rotation of nut 110 relative thereto.
      <br/>
      Specifically, the outer ends of sides 18 forming well 14 intersect at corners 20 arranged at a diameter generally equal to the corners of nut 110, with portions of sides 18 forming well 14 arranged at a diameter less than the diameter of corners 20 or the corners of nut 110.

      It should further be appreciated that sockets 12 are manufactured with wells 14 of an elongated design and specifically of a depth such that spark plug 100 is able to be inserted in well 14 such that when connecting nut 112 abuts with the handle mounting end of socket 12, hexagon nut 110 is received within well 14 sufficiently to rotatably relate socket 12 and hexagon nut 110 of spark plug 100.

      Disk 26 according to the teachings of the present invention includes an axial bore 70 extending axially from face 30 such that magnet 32 in recess 46 is accessible from face 30 of disk 26.

      Now that the basic construction of accessory 10 according to the preferred teachings of the present invention has been explained, the operation and subtle features of accessory 10 can be set forth and appreciated.
      <br/>
      Specifically, when it is desired to initially hold spark plug 100 captive within well 14 of socket 12, accessory 10 of the preferred form shown can be positioned adjacent the open end of well 14 with periphery 42 of disk 26 extending over the inner periphery of well 14 and abutting with socket 12.
      <br/>
      At that time, accessory 10 can be pushed forcing disk 26 to pass into well 14 to compress disk 26 into well 14 with a snug, friction fit.
      <br/>
      Accessory 10 can be pushed into well 14 until face 28 is adjacent to or abuts with the handle mounting end and closes off the inner end of opening 24 of socket 12.
    </p>
    <p num="25">
      After accessory 10 is positioned in socket 12, socket 12 can be utilized in a very similar manner as socket 12 would be if it did not include accessory 10.
      <br/>
      As an example in the removal of spark plug 100 from an engine block, socket 12 is moved such that connecting nut 112 initially extends into well 14.
      <br/>
      As socket 12 is continued to move towards the engine block, connecting nut 112 will move deeper into well 14 until it extends into axial bore 70 of accessory 10.
      <br/>
      As socket 12 is again continued to move towards the engine block and with accessory 10 of the form of FIGS. 1 and 2, connecting nut 112 will extend into axial passage 72 of magnet 32 whereas with accessory 10 of the form of FIG. 3, connecting nut 112 will extend into axial bore 76.
      <br/>
      If not rotationally aligned, socket 12 with accessory 10 is rotated relative to the engine block until sides 18 and corners 20 of well 14 are aligned with hexagon nut 110 of spark plug 100.
      <br/>
      At which time, socket 12 is further moved towards the engine block until hexagon nut 110 is moved inside of well 14 in a nonslipping manner.
      <br/>
      At that time, socket 12 is rotated by any desired wrench handle.
      <br/>
      As hexagon nut 110 is located in well 14, rotation of socket 12 results in rotation of spark plug 100 relative to the engine block to thereby remove threaded portion 108 from the threaded opening of the engine block.
      <br/>
      After spark plug 100 has been threaded out of the engine block, socket 12 can be moved away from the engine block.
    </p>
    <p num="26">
      It should be appreciated that after spark plug 100 has been threaded out of the engine block and while socket 12 is moved away from the engine block, accessory 10 will hold spark plug 100 captive in socket 12 according to the teachings of the present invention.
      <br/>
      In particular, with accessory 10 of the form of FIGS. 1 and 2, magnet 32 will be magnetically attached to the sides of connecting nut 112 if formed of magnetic material and/or will be magnetically attached to disk 114.
      <br/>
      It can be appreciated that accessory 10 of the form of FIGS. 1 and 2 is especially advantageous in the ability to hold spark plugs 100 whether or not connecting nut 112 is formed of magnetic material and whether or not connecting nut 112 is threaded on the conductor 102.
      <br/>
      With accessory 10 of the form of FIG. 3, magnet 32 will be magnetically attached to the top of connecting nut 112 if formed of magnetic material or the top of conductor 102 if connecting nut 112 is not present.
      <br/>
      Thus, socket 12 including spark plug 100 can be moved to a position away from the engine block where threaded portion 108 can be grasped and spark plug 100 pulled from socket 12.
      <br/>
      It can be appreciated that the magnetic attachment force between magnet 32 and spark plug 100 will hold spark plug 100 captive in socket 12 during normal movement of socket 12 but allows spark plug 100 to be removed from socket 12 when desired such as by pulling on spark plug 100 as described and without resulting in movement of accessory 10 in well 14.
      <br/>
      Installation or replacement of spark plug 100 can be accomplished by generally reversing the removal procedure.
    </p>
    <p num="27">
      Often spark plugs 100 are located in depressions or cavities in the engine block which were of a size generally only larger than socket 12.
      <br/>
      Also, since considerable operation pressure is experienced, the tolerance between threaded portion 108 and the threaded opening in the engine block is minimized.
      <br/>
      Additionally, spark plugs 100 are often arranged generally vertical in engine block and will tend to slide from socket 12 (without accessory 10 according to the teachings of the present invention) when socket 12 is vertically oriented.
      <br/>
      Thus, prior to the present invention, two handed operation was often required with one hand holding the wrench including socket 12 while the other hand held spark plug 100 in socket 12, which was extremely difficult if working in close quarters such as when spark plugs 100 are received in depressions or cavities.
      <br/>
      Accessory 10 according to the teachings of the present invention is advantageous in allowing socket 12 to be moved relative to the engine block without spark plugs 100 falling from socket 12 so that single hand operation is possible.
      <br/>
      Additionally, receipt of connecting nut 112 in axial passage 72 or bore 76 and/or of insulator 104 inside of axial bore 70 has sufficient tolerance to self center spark plug 100 in socket 12 while preventing canting of spark plug 100 inside of well 14 of socket 12 which can occur if accessory 10 were not present.
      <br/>
      This feature is especially advantageous in initially threading threaded portion 108 into the engine block during installation of spark plug 100.
      <br/>
      This feature is also advantageous in guiding spark plug 100 into socket 12 especially to remove spark plug 100 from the engine block.
      <br/>
      The possibility of breaking or otherwise damaging insulator 104 is thereby reduced.
    </p>
    <p num="28">
      Due to the mounting of magnet 32 spaced within and from periphery 42 of disk 26 and the smaller diameter of magnet 32 than well 14, socket 12 is magnetically insulated from magnet 32 by disk 26.
      <br/>
      Specifically, due to the nonmagnetic material forming disk 26, disk 26 effectively prevents passage of the magnetic field of magnet 32 to socket 12.
      <br/>
      Thus, although spark plug 100 positioned within well 14 and abutting with magnet 32 will be attracted to and held by magnet 32 within well 14 of socket 12, the magnetic field created within socket 12 itself and the captured spark plug 100 will not be sufficient to be detrimentally attracted to any metal in the path of socket 12 to the fastening location as well as metal surrounding the fastening location.
      <br/>
      In this regard, the height of recess 46 between lower wall 50 and face 28 can be slightly greater than the height of magnet 32 between faces 34 and 36 so that magnet 32 is inset below face 28.
      <br/>
      Thus, there is less likelihood that face 36 of magnet 32 will engage the handle mounting end or any other portion of socket 12.
      <br/>
      However, the magnetic attraction of magnet 32 with the handle mounting end of socket 12 assists in the removable retention of accessory 10 in socket 12 according to the teachings of the present invention.
    </p>
    <p num="29">
      Due to the magnetic insulation of magnet 32 by disk 26, the magnetic attraction between spark plug 100 and magnet 32 is enhanced.
      <br/>
      Thus, the strength required for magnet 32 to effectively capture spark plug 100 within well 14 is minimized, with the attraction of socket 12 to metal (which is dependent on the strength of magnet 32) also being minimized.
    </p>
    <p num="30">
      It should be appreciated that sockets 12 are made by various manufacturers and are of various designs and configurations including with varying number of sides 18 forming well 14.
      <br/>
      However, as sockets 12 of whatever design must correspond to and slideably receive hexagon nut 110 of spark plug 100 to be operable, the diameter of corners 20 must be generally standard and corresponding to that of hexagon nut 110.
      <br/>
      Accessory 10 according to the teachings of the present invention takes advantage of this feature to allow use in conventional sockets 12 of whatever design and without modification.
      <br/>
      Specifically, disk 26 can be sized according to the diameter of corners 20 of the particular sized socket 12 for which accessory 10 is desired to be utilized.
      <br/>
      In its most preferred form, disk 26 can then be pushed into well 14 of socket 12 elastically deforming to match the periphery of well 14 regardless of the number and/or configuration of sides 18 of the particular socket 12 which accessory 10 is to be utilized.
      <br/>
      In fact, as accessory 10 is bound in well 14 by disk 26 deforming inside and along sides 18, high tolerances are possible between the relationship between the diameters of disk 26 and corners 20 such that accessory 10 can be utilized through a range of socket sizes such as for generally corresponding standard American (inch) or metric sizes.
      <br/>
      Thus, accessory 10 according to the teachings of the present invention is relatively inexpensive to fabricate and is versatile in application for the benefit of the average or experienced end user.
    </p>
    <p num="31">
      Further, in addition to being usable with most makes or models of sockets 12 without need for modifying socket 12, accessory 10 can be removed easily from socket 12 by pushing an elongated member through opening 24 thereby forcing accessory 10 from socket 12 and allowing standard use of socket 12.
      <br/>
      Also, any build up of grease, dirt, oil or the like can be wiped from accessory 10 after its removal from socket 12.
      <br/>
      Due to the resilient, compressible nature of disk 26 of the most preferred form, disk 26 generally returns to its original shape so that accessory 10 can be inserted into and removed from well 14 a multiplicity of times without detrimentally affecting the utilization of accessory 10.
    </p>
    <p num="32">
      It should be noted that shock or pounding forces can result in chipping, demagnetization, or other damage to magnet 32.
      <br/>
      In addition to removably positioning magnet 32 into and magnetically insulating magnet 32 from socket 12, disk 26 takes up and absorbs vibration or shock in applying torque to socket 12 to fasten or loosen threaded portion 108.
    </p>
    <p num="33">
      Additionally, due to the snug fit, accessory 10 is slideably adjustable inside of well 14 to positions spaced from the handle mounting end of socket 12 so that accessory 10 can be adjustably positioned in well 14 by passing an elongated member through opening 24 and pushing against face 28 and/or 36 to slide accessory 10 to the desired position inside of well 14.
      <br/>
      In any case, accessory 10 according to the teachings of the present invention is positioned spaced from the open end of well 14 and adjacent the handle mounting end of socket 12 so that it is typically clear of oil and grease contact.
    </p>
    <p num="34">
      Now that the basic teachings of the present invention have been explained, many extensions and variations will be obvious to one skilled in the art.
      <br/>
      For example, although in the most preferred form several unique and novel features have been utilized producing synergistic results, such features could be utilized separately or in other combinations according to the teachings of the present invention.
      <br/>
      As an example, in the most preferred form shown, axial bore 70 is shown of a generally cylindrical shape.
      <br/>
      However, axial bore 70 could be formed of other shapes including but not limited to frustoconical and which enhance guiding spark plug 100 into well 14 and accessory 10 according to the teachings of the present invention.
    </p>
    <p num="35">Likewise, although the presence of axial bore 70 is believed advantageous for several reasons including the enhancement of guiding spark plug 100 and of the increased retention of accessory 10 in well 14 due to its elongated length, accessory 10 according to the teachings of the present invention could have a height generally equal to the height of magnet 32 between faces 34 and 36 especially when magnet 32 includes axial passage 72.</p>
    <p num="36">
