      A desired consistency for particulate confectionery material is obtained by adjusting the spacing of a nip between two rotary milling cylinders in dependence upon a measured force exerted by the confectionery material on the cylinders during passage of the confectionery material through the nip.

    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="1">The invention relates to a method and device for pre-milling confectionery material, such as chocolate.</p>
    <p num="2">As is known, confectionery material is conventionally pre-milled or pre-refined by a granulometric reduction of the particles forming the mass of said material, this operation being carried out between two rotary cylinders, of which a first cylinder can controllably swing with respect to a second cylinder which is supported at a fixed position.</p>
    <p num="3">Prior confectionery material making systems comprise pre-refining machines arranged between the mixers and the end refining machines.</p>
    <p num="4">
      Said pre-refining machines allow the reduction of the particle size of the confectionery material particles to values which would be suitable for the end refining machines.
      <br/>
      More specifically, said pre-refining machines, due to the reduced granulometry, provide a confectionery material mass having an even doughiness and, accordingly, an even consistency.
    </p>
    <p num="5">Actually, it is known that an undesired variation of the consistency of a pre-refined confectionery mass would alter a proper operation of the end refining machines.</p>
    <p num="6">
      At present, the variation of the consistency of the confectionery material being refined is evaluated by analyzing the quality of the already refined product.
      <br/>
      These consistency variations are compensated for by changing the milling distance or gap between the pre-refining machine cylinders.
      <br/>
      Thus, by either increasing or decreasing the granulometry of the confectionery mass, either a reduction or an increase of the area of the surface of the confectionery material particles is obtained, thereby differently distributing the fat present in said mass, and consequently either decreasing or increasing the consistency thereof.
    </p>
    <p num="7">At present, in order to carry out a reliable adjustment of the confectionery material consistency, skilled persons must evaluate the quality of the end product exiting the refining machines or devices, so as to establish a proper adjustment of the pre-refining machines.</p>
    <p num="8">Such an operating method, based on a visual control of the end product exiting the refining machine, has the drawback that it operates only after having refined a part of the confectionery material, and, accordingly, with a considerable delay.</p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="9">Thus, the aim of the present invention is to overcome the above mentioned drawbacks of the prior art and, in particular, provide a confectionery material pre-milling method and device allowing to hold the confectionery material consistency constant.</p>
    <p num="10">According to the invention, this is achieved by a method for pre-milling a confectionery material, in which the particle size of the particles of said confectionery material is reduced between two cylinders, characterized in that said method comprises the steps of measuring the load or spreading-apart force between said two cylinders, comparing the measured spreading-apart force with a reference spreading-apart force value, to define a force variation, defining, based on said spreading-apart force variation, a desired distance between said cylinders allowing to adjust a mutual position of said cylinders by feedback controlling said position based on the measured distance between said cylinders.</p>
    <p num="11">
      In said pre-refining machines, the confectionery material is milled between milling cylinders having a preset milling distance or gap and respective mechanically set revolution speeds.
      <br/>
      Thus, to hold the confectionery material consistency constant, would mean to hold the load between said cylinders constant.
    </p>
    <p num="12">If the mixing device supplies the pre-refining machine with a confectionery material the consistency whereof changes depending, for example, on the fat contents of the product and on natural variations of the mixer metering device or the characteristics of the used starting materials, then a variation of the load or spreading-apart force produced by the confectionery material passing through said cylinders will be provided.</p>
    <p num="13">
      By the disclosed method, as the load between the cylinders changes, a new size or value of the milling gap for holding the confectionery material consistency unaltered will be set, and, based on this new gap or cylinder distance, the mutual positions of the laminating cylinders will be adjusted.
      <br/>
      Thus, by varying the milling gap, the confectionery mass particles granulometry is changed, thereby changing the solid phase specific surface area, so as to properly distribute the fat contents, to recover the confectionery material mass consistency to the desired values.

    <p num="29">FIG. 1 shows a confectionery material pre-milling device or pre-refining machine, generally indicated by 1.</p>
    <p num="30">The pre-refining machine 1 comprises laminating cylinders 2, 3 which are supported by a box-like supporting frame 4.</p>
    <p num="31">On the top of the laminating cylinders 2, 3 a conveying device 5 for conveying or feeding said confectionery material is provided.</p>
    <p num="32">Under said laminating cylinders 2, 3 a device 6 for outfeeding and conveying the pre-refined material to further downstream arranged and refining stations (not shown) is provided.</p>
    <p num="33">A drive 7 for rotatively driving said cylinders 2, 3 is operatively coupled to said laminating cylinders 2, 3.</p>
    <p num="34">The different parts 2, 3, 5, 6, 7 of the pre-refining machine 1 are operatively coupled to a drive and control device 8 arranged, for example, on a side of the framework 4 of the pre-refining machine 1.</p>
    <p num="35">FIG. 2 shown that the first laminating cylinder 2 is swingably supported on a pivot pin 10 by the box-like framework 4 of the pre-refining machine 1.</p>
    <p num="36">The second laminating cylinder 3 is fixedly supported on said box-like framework 4 of the pre-refining machine 1.</p>
    <p num="37">By levers 11, 12, rigid with the supports 13, 14, said laminating cylinders 2, 3 are operatively coupled to a controllable feedback adjusting device for adjusting the position of the first swinging cylinder 2 with respect to the second fixed cylinder 3, as generally indicated by the reference number 15.</p>
    <p num="38">FIG. 2 shows only one of the controllable feedback adjusting devices 15 for adjusting the position of the cylinder 2.</p>
    <p num="39">Preferably, said controllable feedback adjusting devices 15 for adjusting the position of the first cylinder 2 are provided in a number of two, and operate on both the supports 13 provided at the end portions of the first cylinder 2.</p>
    <p num="40">The controllable feedback adjusting device 15 for adjusting the position of the first cylinder 2 is provided with a motor reducing unit 16 the casing whereof is rigid with the lever 12 extending from the support 14 of the second cylinder 3.</p>
    <p num="41">
      The motor reducing unit 16 is preferably operatively coupled to a screw shaft 17, such as a ball recirculating screw.
      <br/>
      The shaft 17 controls the displacement of a scroll 18 which is operatively coupled to the lever 11 extending from the support 13 of the first cylinder 2.
    </p>
    <p num="42">Advantageously, said scroll 18 is articulatedly coupled by an articulation 19 to said lever 11.</p>
    <p num="43">Between the articulation 19 and the scroll 11 is arranged a spreading-apart force transducer or sensor 20.</p>
    <p num="44">Preferably, between said articulation 19 and scroll 18 a load cell is arranged.</p>
    <p num="45">Between the spreading-apart force transducer 20 and scroll 18 a resilient device 21 for absorbing possible impacts occurring between the two laminating cylinders 2, 3 as the confectionery material (not shown) passes therethrough is provided.</p>
    <p num="46">Preferably, said resilient device 21 comprises a hydraulic cylinder-piston assembly, the feeding pressure whereof is suitably controlled.</p>
    <p num="47">In a modified embodiment of the invention, between the spreading-apart force transducer 20 and the scroll 18, an overload device including a load pin designed for a preset breaking load is arranged.</p>
    <p num="48">Said ball recirculating screw 17 has one end thereof rigid with a position transducer or sensor 22.</p>
    <p num="49">For example, to one end of said ball recirculating screw 17, an encoder is keyed.</p>
    <p num="50">Said encoder would detect the ball recirculating screw 17 revolution, and would consequently provide a signal proportional to the mutual position of said scroll 18 which, in turn, would be proportional to the position of the first laminating cylinder 2.</p>
    <p num="51">The position of the first laminating cylinder 2 with respect to the second fixed cylinder 3 will define the size or width 23 of the milling gap or nip.</p>
    <p num="52">The spreading-apart force transducers 20 and the position transducers 22 are operatively coupled to the inlets of a drive and control device 25.</p>
    <p num="53">The drive and control device 25 is provided for conditioning and converting the signals coming from the spreading-apart and position transducers 20 and 22 respectively, for a subsequent processing (for example a digital type of processing).</p>
    <p num="54">Preferably, the drive and control device is provided with displays 26, 27 for digitally displaying the signals coming from the transducers 20, 22.</p>
    <p num="55">Advantageously, said drive and control device 25 is operatively coupled to a keyboard 28 and a video monitor 29 in order to display the operation status of the devices and for monitoring the pre-refining machine 1, setting the desired data and programming the drive and control device 25.</p>
    <p num="56">The output of said drive and control device 25 is operatively coupled to a drive unit 30.</p>
    <p num="57">The drive unit 30 is operatively coupled to the motor reducing unit 16.</p>
    <p num="58">With reference to FIG. 3, the method according to the invention and the operation of the pre-milling device will be hereinafter disclosed.</p>
    <p num="59">Because of the passage of the confectionery material 35 through the milling gap or nip defined between the laminating cylinders 2, 3, a spreading-apart or repulsion force F will be generated between said cylinders 2, 3.</p>
    <p num="60">Said spreading-apart force F, urging the swinging cylinder 2, will be detected by the spreading-apart force transducer or sensor 20, providing a corresponding signal 36.</p>
    <p num="61">This signal 36, proportional to the spreading-apart force F, is sent to the drive and control device 25, to be conditioned and converted, for example, to a digital signal.</p>
    <p num="62">Advantageously, for allowing the pre-refining machine operators to control a proper operation of the device, the signal 36 proportional to the spreading-apart force F is sent to a display 26.</p>
    <p num="63">The spreading-apart force F proportional signal 36 is compared at 37 with a signal FR proportional to a reference spreading-apart force value, as desired between the laminating cylinders 2, 3.</p>
    <p num="64">From the comparing step 37, a signal proportional to the spreading-apart force variation  DELTA F will be defined and sent to a calculating micro-processor 38, provided for defining the confectionery material pre-refining process parameters as it will be disclosed in a more detailed manner hereinafter.</p>
    <p num="65">The confectionery material refining process or method provides to use a strict relationship between the mechanical parameters of the refining device and the confectionery material mass consistency.</p>
    <p num="66">In particular:  (Equation image '1' not included in text)</p>
    <p num="67">where (d) is the distance or milling gap or nip of the cylinders 2, 3, (V) the peripheral speed of the cylinders 2, 3 involved in the pre-refining step, (+character pullout}) the consistency or viscosity of the confectionery material mass, (F) the load of the laminating cylinders 2, 3, and (C) a proportionality constant.</p>
    <p num="68">In an embodiment of the invention, the calculating microprocessor 38 defines, based on the spread-apart force variation  DELTA F, a laminating cylinder 2, 3 distance variation, by either adding or subtracting a pre-set value of the actual lamination cylinder distance.</p>
    <p num="69">The step by step variation of preset values is continuously performed up to found a lamination cylinder spread-apart force value equal to the reference spread-apart force value FR.</p>
    <p num="70">In a modified embodiment of the invention, by supplying the calculating microprocessor 38 with signals proportional to the confectionery material consistency +character pullout}, to the speed V1 of the first cylinder 2, to the speed V2 of the second cylinder 3 (the cylinder 2, 3 speeds V1, V2 being preset values), the desired distance (d) of the cylinders 2, 3 allowing to obtain the desired consistency (+character pullout}) of the confectionery material will be set.</p>
    <p num="71">Simultaneously, by the position transducer 22, the actual distance of the second swinging cylinder 2 and second fixed cylinder 3 is measured.</p>
    <p num="72">The position transducer 22 provides a signal (dm) which is proportional to the cylinder 2, 3 measured distance, which signal is supplied to the drive and control device 25 to be conditioned therein and converted, for example, to a digital signal.</p>
    <p num="73">Advantageously, for allowing the method to be monitored, said signal (dm) is sent to a display 27 and compared at 40 with said cylinder 2, 3 desired or target distance (d), thereby providing a reference signal 41 to the feedback adjustment controllable devices 15 for adjusting the position of said first swinging cylinder 2, said reference signal 41 being further supplied to an adjuster (r) controlling the driving unit of said motor reducing unit 16, which, in turn, will drive the first swinging cylinder 2 to bring it to the target distance from the second fixed cylinder 3.</p>
