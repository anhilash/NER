    <heading>STATEMENT REGARDING FEDERALLY SPONSORED RESEARCH OR DEVELOPMENT</heading>
    <p num="1">The United States Government has rights in this invention pursuant to Contract No. DE-FC02-97EE50476 between the United States Department of Energy and Energy Partners, Inc.</p>
    <heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">This invention relates generally to compositions and methods for fabricating electrically-conductive polymer composite structures and coatings, and more particularly to a highly-conductive graphite composite particularly suited for net shape molding a current collector plate for a fuel cell.</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="3">
      Solid polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) type electrochemical fuel cells are well known.
      <br/>
      Generally, PEM fuel cells comprise a membrane electrode assembly (MEA) and diffusion backing structure interposed between electrically conductive graphite current collector plates.
      <br/>
      In operation, multiple individual cells are arranged to form a fuel cell stack.
      <br/>
      When the individual cells are arranged in series to form a fuel cell stack, the current collector plates are referred to as bipolar collector plates.
      <br/>
      The collector plates perform multiple functions, including: (1) providing structural support; (2) providing electrical connection between cells; (3) directing fuel and oxidant reactants and/or coolant to individual cells; (4) distributing reactant streams and/or coolant within individual cells; (5) removing byproduct from individual cells; and (6) separating fuel and oxidant gas streams between electrically connected cells, In addition to being electrically conductive, collector plates must have good mechanical strength, high thermal stability, high resistance to degradation caused by chemical attack and/or hydrolysis, and low permeability to hydrogen gas.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      Typically, collector plates have intricate patterns formed on their major surfaces.
      <br/>
      For instance, integral channels may be provided for directing fuel, oxidant and/or byproduct through the fuel cell.
      <br/>
      Historically, graphite structures have been machined to a desired configuration from graphite composite blanks.
      <br/>
      Due in part to the expense and time consuming nature of machining, more recent efforts in the fuel cell manufacturing industry have focused on the development of compositions and methods for producing net shape molded fuel cell structures, such as bipolar collector plates, using compression molding and injection molding techniques.
      <br/>
      These efforts, which have had limited success, have concentrated primarily on molding compositions incorporating fluoropolymer binder materials.
      <br/>
      For example, bipolar collector plates molded from thermoplastic fluoropolymers, such as vinylidene fluoride, are disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,801,374, 4,214,969, and 4,988,583.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      Compared to other polymeric materials, fluoropolymers have relatively high viscosities.
      <br/>
      Significantly, the relatively high viscosity associated with fluoropolymers limits their effectiveness as binder materials in molding and coating compositions.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      In an effort to maximize the electrical conductivity of current collector plates for fuel cells, it is desirable to maximize electrically-conductive filler loading levels.
      <br/>
      Generally, as the percentage of filler particles in a given polymer composition is increased, there is a corresponding increase in the viscosity of the composition.
      <br/>
      Consequently, regardless of the polymer binder material chosen, the addition of electrically conductive filler must be limited to ensure some minimum degree of flow during processing.
      <br/>
      Such viscosity limitations are particularly pronounced in injection molding applications, where the viscosity of the polymer composition must be maintained at a low enough level to allow the composition to travel through intricate mold features such as channels and gates.
      <br/>
      In the case of fluoropolymer compositions, the high initial viscosity level associated with the fluoropolymer binder restricts the quantity of filler that can be loaded into the binder prior to processing.
      <br/>
      Consequently, the electrical conductivity of fuel cell collector plates fabricated using fluoropolymer binders is correspondingly limited.
    </p>
    <p num="7">For these and other reasons, there is a well-established need for improved compositions and methods for processing highly conductive composite structures for electronic, thermoelectric and electrochemical device applications.</p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="8">It is an object of this invention to provide a composition for fabricating thermally- and electrically-conductive polymer composite structures and coatings for use in highly-corrosive environments, wherein the electrical conductivity of the resulting structure or coating is improved as a result of enhanced filler loading capacity of the composition.</p>
    <p num="9">It is another object of this invention to provide a composition, and a method for processing said composition, to form a thermally- and electrically-conductive polymer composite structure or coating for use in electronic, thermoelectric and electrochemical devices.</p>
    <p num="10">It is another object of this invention to provide a non-fluorinated composition for rapidly net shape molding a current collector plate for a polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) fuel cell, wherein improved filler loading results in a current collector plate having a higher bulk electrical conductivity then conventional current collector plates fabricated from fluoropolymer-based compositions.</p>
    <p num="11">
      These and other objects of the invention are achieved with the novel compositions and methods of the present invention.
      <br/>

      In the best mode of the invention, the composition is used to mold a unitary current collector plate for a polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) fuel cell.
      <br/>
      However, the composition can be used to fabricate alternative collector plate structures as well.
      <br/>
      For instance, the composition can be coated onto the surface of a suitable substrate to form a multilayer collector plate structure.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, the term "structure" as used herein is intended to refer to either a unitary part or a coated part.
      <br/>
      Preferably, the composition comprises a low viscosity thermoplastic resin combined with a highly-conductive carbon or graphite filler material.

      The filler may be provided in various forms, including powder, fiber and flake.
      <br/>
      However, it is preferred that the filler material comprises a high purity graphite powder having a carbon content of greater than 98 percent.
      <br/>
      The use of graphite is preferred because graphite is electrochemically stable in a wide range of environments.
      <br/>
      The use of a powder form is preferred because powders are less apt to impede the flow of the composition during molding.
      <br/>
      Preferably, the graphite powder has an average particle size of approximately 23-26 microns, and a BET-measured surface area of approximately 7-10 m2 /g.
      <br/>
      The incorporation of small, low surface area conductive particles in the novel composition of the present invention is a significant departure from conventional conductive composites used to fabricate structures for electronic, thermoelectric and electrochemnical devices, Conventional conductive composites, such as those used to fabricate fuel cell collector plates, typically contain conductive particles having a very high surface area combined with a small particle size.
      <br/>
      For Instance, carbon black particles having a surface area of greater than 500 m2 /g and a particle size of less than 1 micron are typical.
      <br/>
      Commonly, conventional conductive composites also contain large fibers having a low surface area.
      <br/>
      For instance, fibers having a surface area of less than 10 m2 /g coupled with a fiber length in excess of 250 microns are typical.
    </p>
    <p num="26">
      The combination of reduced filler particle size and reduced filler particle surface area provides a means for maintaining material flow while increasing filler particle loading.
      <br/>
      Significantly, the relatively low particle size and surface area enable greatly improved filler particle packing densities as compared to known compositions for molding current collector plates.
      <br/>
      A corresponding increase in solids loading results in a fabricated plate having increased electrical conductivity, while minimizing gas permeable voids.
      <br/>
      Graphite powders having the above-identified properties are available from UCAR Carbon Company, Inc. of Lawrenceburg, Tenn., as well as from Asbury Carbons, Inc. of Asbury, N.J.
    </p>
    <p num="27">
      Carbon nanofibers may be added to the composition to improve electrical conductivity and mechanical strength of the molded collector plate.
      <br/>
      The carbon nanofibers typically have diameters ranging from a few nanometers to several hundred nanometers, and aspect ratios ranging from 50 to 1,500.
      <br/>
      Further additives may include carbon fibers, metal fibers such as stainless steel or nickel, and/or metal-coated carbon fiber concentrates having polymer sizing chosen from the aforementioned group of potential polymers (i.e., polyphenylene sulfides, modified polyphenylene oxides, liquid crystal polymers, polyamides, polyimides, polyesters, phenolics, epoxy-containing resins, epoxy novolacs and vinyl esters).
    </p>
    <p num="28">
      The preferred composition contains 45-95 wt % graphite powder, 5-50 wt % polymer resin, and 0-20 wt % metallic fiber, carbon fiber and/or carbon nanofiber.
      <br/>
      Where metallic fibers are added, it is preferred that at least 50 percent of the fibers have diameters ranging from a few nanometers to about 50 microns, and aspect ratios ranging from 10 to 5,000.
    </p>
    <p num="29">
      The composition is formed into a composite having a desired geometry by compression molding, injection molding, or a combination thereof.
      <br/>
      In the case of compression molding, the graphite and polymer powders, and/or metal-coated carbon particles or fibers, are initially blended together to obtain a uniform distribution and composition.
      <br/>
      A preform of the mixed blend is created by compressing the blend using a pressure of 5-100(10)6 N/m2 at a temperature below the melting temperature of the polymer constituent, and preferably at room temperature.
      <br/>
      The preform is heated to a temperature greater than the polymer melting temperature for a period of approximately 1-45 minutes.
      <br/>
      Subsequently, the preform is placed between mold platens heated to a temperature in the range of 180-350 (degree)  C. The mold platens are brought together at a clamping pressure of about 1-15(10)6 N/m2 and trapped gas within the mold Is removed by a degassing step in which a vacuum is applied.
      <br/>
      The degassing step takes approximately 1 minute.
      <br/>
      Following degassing, the mold clamping pressure is increased to about 5-75(10)6 N/m2. Subsequently, the mold is cooled to a temperature in the range of approximately 80-250 (degree)  C., and the part is removed from the mold.
    </p>
    <p num="30">
      In the case of injection molding, the filler and polymer powders, and/or metal coated carbon particles or fibers, are initially blended together to obtain a uniform distribution and composition, compounded into pellets, and then plasticized prior to injection into a mold.
      <br/>
      Where injection molding is employed, the composition must be maintained at an adequate temperature (i.e., well above the melting temperature of the polymer resin) to prevent the resin from freezing, or solidifying, as it flows into and through the cooler mold.
      <br/>
      To further aid in preventing the resin from freezing during injection, the mold itself is preferably heated to a temperature of approximately 80-350 (degree)  C. The mixture is rapidly injected into the mold to minimize heat loss due to the high thermal conductivity of the composition.
      <br/>
      Rapid injection also produces improved material flow into and through the mold by generating higher shear forces.
      <br/>
      Varying the injection pressure can affect the rate of injection.
      <br/>
      The injection pressure may vary depending upon a number of factors, such as composition viscosity, mold temperature, etc.
      <br/>
      However, it is preferred that the injection pressure is set at the maximum level that can be achieved without creating excessive mold flash.
      <br/>
      Mold flash occurs when the mold material is squeezed out of the mold cavity.
      <br/>
      Injection pressures may range from approximately 13-500(10)6 N/m2. The step of injection takes approximately 1-15 seconds.
      <br/>
      Following injection, the part may be retained in the mold prior to being ejected.
    </p>
    <p num="31">
      In a some instances, It may be desirable to employ a combination injection/compression molding process wherein the injection molded structure is subjected to a compression step following molding.
      <br/>
      This final compression step may, for instance, be employed to further enhance the conductivity of the molded structure by increasing the conductive filler packing density.
    </p>
    <p num="32">
      In an alternate embodiment of the invention, the novel composition is melted and applied to a metallic surface to provide a hardened, highly conductive protective layer upon cooling.
      <br/>
      The composition provides a means for protecting an underlying metallic structure from corrosion, while precluding a significant increase in electrical resistance.
      <br/>
      Structures suitable for fuel cell applications (i.e., having properties listed in Table 1) can be formed using numerous different coating methods.
      <br/>
      For instance, a coated structure can be formed by hot-dip coating thin, stamped or etched metal substrates into a melted form of the novel composition.
      <br/>
      Additional coating methods include cladding or hot roll coating a metal sheet, and subsequently hot stamping the coated surface to form a desired surface geometry.

      While the preferred embodiments of the invention have been illustrated and described, it will be clear that the invention is not so limited.
