      Technical Field of the Invention
    </p>
    <p num="2">The invention relates generally to a device that thermally maintains an elevated level of a hot beverage.</p>
    <p num="3">2. Background Art</p>
    <p num="4">
      People often consume hot drinks such as coffee when driving to their destinations.
      <br/>
      Time spent in traffic delays and traveling long distances, for example, turns an enjoyable hot drink into a cold distasteful liquid.
      <br/>
      Heat from the beverage transfers quickly to the ambient surroundings.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      Prior art devices include insulated beverage receptacles and hot plates or warmers.
      <br/>
      Insulated receptacles simply prolong the heat dissipation process.
      <br/>
      They can elongate the period in which the user considers the beverage enjoyable, but cannot maintain an elevated beverage temperature.
      <br/>
      Hot plates introduce some heat into the beverage through the bottom area of certain receptacles.
      <br/>
      However, this hot plate type of heating does not evenly distribute heat throughout the beverage.
      <br/>
      The reason is very little receptacle surface area contacts the hot plate, therefore minimizing heat transfer through the receptacle to the beverage.
      <br/>
      Additionally, this type of heater limits the type of receptacle materials that one can place onto them.
      <br/>
      Certain plastics and other low melting temperature materials will deform or melt when they contact a hot plate.
      <br/>
      Finally, some problems with other heated beverage apparatus is their design complexity and manufacturing difficulties, lack of thermal adjustability and circuit protection, and poor stability in mobile applications, to mention a few.
      <br/>
      Therefore, a necessity exists in the art for a simple, electrically heated beverage appliance that thermally maintains an elevated level of a hot beverage contained therein.

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE EMBODIMENT</heading>
    <p num="11">
      Referring now in more detail to FIGS. 1, 2, 3 and 4, an embodiment of an electrically heated beverage appliance is shown.
      <br/>
      In this embodiment, the electrically heated beverage appliance generally consists of a container (10), mating holding structure (23), and covering and thermal regulation means (47).
      <br/>
      The container (10) is designed to rest on electrical contacting members (20), (21), and (22) of the mating holding structure (23) and is shown above the mating holding structure in FIG. 1 and also in FIG. 4.
      <br/>
      The container (10) comprises a containing structure (67), thermally and electrically conductive member (13), heating means (15), retaining member (12), and a sealing member (63).
      <br/>
      The mating holding structure (23) consists of a holding member (26), electrical contacting members (20), (21), and (22), non-sliding, non-scratching means (25), electrical connecting means (not shown), fastening means (not shown) and elastic members (not shown).
      <br/>
      The covering and thermal regulation means (47) consists of a lid (40) and valve (42).
    </p>
    <p num="12">
      The thermally and electrically conductive member (13) in the container (10) is preferably made of thin, solderable metal, such as copper or the like.
      <br/>
      The thermally and electrically conductive member (13) includes a bottom portion (16) and top portion (61).
      <br/>
      The bottom portion (16) of the thermally and electrically conductive member (13) has a heating means (15) fastened in electrical contact with it, preferably by means of soldering or the like.
      <br/>
      In this embodiment, the beating means is shown as a positive temperature coefficient (PTC) thermistor.
      <br/>
      The heating means, however, can include any type of electrical heater.
      <br/>
      The heating means (15) is disk-shaped and includes a bottom portion (14) and top portion (62).
      <br/>
      When electricity is applied to the bottom portion (14) and top portion (62) of the heating means (15), the heating means (15) produces heat.
      <br/>
      This heat is transferred to the thermally and electrically conductive member (13) and then to the beverage collected within the container (10).
      <br/>
      The bottom portion (16) of the thermally and electrically conductive member (13) is part of an electrical circuit used to conduct electricity from the electrical contacting member (20) in the mating holding structure (23) to the top portion (62) of the heating means (15).
      <br/>
      When the container (10) is placed onto the mating holding structure (23), electrical contacting members (20) and (21) complete the electrical circuit required to power the heating means (15).
      <br/>
      Electrical contacting member (21) in the mating holding structure (23) directly touches the bottom portion (14) of the heating means (15).
      <br/>
      The electrical contacting member (22), through the thermally and electrically conductive member (13) and electrical contacting member (20), completes another electrical circuit.
      <br/>
      This circuit illuminates an indicating means (27) in the mating holding structure (23), telling the user the container (10) is properly positioned onto the mating holding structure (23) and is heating the beverage.
      <br/>
      Another indicating means (not shown) displays a "power on" condition when electricity is supplied to the mating holding structure (23).
    </p>
    <p num="13">
      The thermally and electrically conductive member (13) is positioned between a containing structure (67) and retaining member (12), forming the bottom boundary of the container (10).
      <br/>
      In this embodiment, both containing structure (67) and retaining member (12) are made of rigid, high temperature, non-toxic, and electrically non-conductive plastic.
      <br/>
      A sealing member (63), located between the thermally and electrically conductive member (13) and containing structure (67), is compressed forming a seal so a beverage can be retained within the container (10).
      <br/>
      The sealing member (63) is housed in a recess (64) at bottom portion of the containing structure (67).
      <br/>
      The containing structure (67) consists of a thin wall section (60) that extends downwardly at an angle from the annular lip (68) at the open top portion of the container (10), forming the outer boundary of the container (10).
      <br/>
      The external shape of the container (10) matches a similar shape in the mating holding structure (23).
      <br/>
      The physical contact caused by this match ensures proper electrical contact alignment and prevents accidental tipping of the container (10).
      <br/>
      The containing structure (67) also includes an internal thread (65) at the bottom open portion of the container (10) which mates to the external thread (66) of the retaining member (12).
      <br/>
      The retaining member (12) is assembled to the bottom portion of the containing structure (67) by means of a drive tool.
      <br/>
      In this embodiment, the tool utilizes recessed holes (11) to complete its function.
    </p>
    <p num="14">
      The lid (40) of the covering and thermal regulation means (47) in FIG. 3. has a groove (46) that seals against the annular lip (68) of the container (10).
      <br/>
      The valve (42) has a sealing face (43) which is semi-circular and flat.
      <br/>
      Both lid (40) and valve (42) are made of plastic.
      <br/>
      A knob (50) and annular, flexible, locking tab (48) extend upwardly from the midsection of the sealing face (43) and snaps into a hole (44) in the middle of the lid (40).
      <br/>
      The user controls the temperature of the beverage by rotating the knob (50) on the valve (42) which exposes or seals ventilation holes (45), thereby dissipating or retaining some heat stored in the beverage.
      <br/>
      An air vent hole (49), separate from the ventilation holes (45), allows air to enter and escape the cavity of the container (10) so the beverage flows freely.
      <br/>
      The user drinks the beverage through the opening (41) in the covering and thermal regulation means (47).
    </p>
    <p num="15">
      The top of the mating holding structure (23) has an opening to accept the bottom portion of the container (10).
      <br/>
      The holding member (26) has a downwardly extending, angular wall (28) that keeps the container (10) from accidentally tipping.
      <br/>
      A landing (29) at the foot of the wall (28) keeps the container (10) at the proper height with respect to the mating holding structure (23) to make electrical contact.
      <br/>
      The landing (29) also aligns and guides the electrical contacting members (20), (21), and (22).
      <br/>
      Elastic members (not shown) are part of an electrical circuit, and are positioned between each electrical contacting member (20), (21), and (22) and an electrically connecting means (not shown).
      <br/>
      For a clearer understanding of this embodiment, the elastic members could be compression springs, and the electrically connecting means could be a printed circuit board.
      <br/>
      The electrically connecting means comprises a power jack (24), two indicating means--"heat" mode (27) and "power on" mode (not shown), and a self-resettable fuse (not shown).
      <br/>
      The electrically connecting means is attached by fastening means to the bottom side of the holding member (26).
      <br/>
      The holding member (26) has a square footprint to aid in stabilizing the electrically heated beverage appliance (5) and (6).
      <br/>
      A non-sliding and non-scratching means (25) is affixed to the bottom of the holding member (26).
      <br/>
      Electricity is supplied to the mating holding structure (23) through a power cord assembly (not shown) using known connector means that are associated with household and automative outlets--comprising electrical transformers and power supplies, automotive electrical systems--such as cigarette lighter adapters, and other electrical power sources.
    </p>
    <p num="16">
      Considering now the operation of the disclosed embodiment, a desired hot beverage, such as coffee, is poured into the container (10).
      <br/>
      The container (10) is then placed onto the mating holding structure (23), and electricity is supplied to the heating means (15) through a power cord assembly (not shown) in conjunction with an electrically connecting means (not shown), elastic members (not shown), electrical contacting members (20) and (21), and a thermally and electrically conductive member (13).
      <br/>
      Heat from the heating means (15) is applied to the bottom surface (16) of the thermally and electrically conductive member (13), quickly passes through the thermally and electrically conductive member (13), and dissipates upwardly to thermally maintain the beverage previously placed in the container (10).
      <br/>
      The heating means (15) could be self-regulating and self-limiting, and should be selected to sufficiently maintain the desired consumption temperature of the hot beverage.
      <br/>
      A covering and thermal regulation means (47) comprising a lid (40) and valve (42) accompanies the electrically heated beverage appliance to prevent spilling of the beverage and deter heat dissipation.
      <br/>
      Additionally, if desired, the covering and thermal regulation means (47) can also thermally regulate the hot beverage.
      <br/>
      By rotating the valve (42) and controlling the quantity of exposed ventilation holes (45), the user can adjust the maintained beverage temperature.
