    <p num="1">
      The present invention relates to adhesive ethylene copolymer resin compositions and laminates using the compositions.
      <br/>
      More particularly, the invention relates adhesive ethylene copolymer resin compositions capable of being laminated with various resins such as polystyrene resins, ABS resin, polyacrylonitrile resins, polyester resins, polycarbonate resins, polyvinylidene chloride resins and ethylene/vinyl acetate copolymer saponified resins (EVOH) in a molten state to form laminates showing better retention of adhesion in an atmosphere of high temperatures than the conventional graft-modified low-crystalline ethylene polymers, and relates to laminates using the compositions.
      <br/>
      Further, the invention also relates to adhesive ethylene copolymer resin compositions exhibiting excellent adhesive strength particularly to metals and polar materials such as ethylene/vinyl alcohol copolymers, polyamides and polyesters, and to laminates using the compositions.
    </p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND ART</heading>
    <p num="2">
      Because of their excellent properties, ethylene copolymers have been molded by various methods and applied to various uses.
      <br/>
      However, the ethylene copolymers have poor affinity for metals and various polar materials, because they have no polar group in their molecules, that is, they are non-polar resins.
      <br/>
      Therefore, when the ethylene copolymers are applied to uses where they must be bonded to metals or blended with polar resins, some improvement should be made.
      <br/>
      In order to improve their affinity for the polar materials, for example, a method of graft-modifying the ethylene copolymers with polar monomers is known.
    </p>
    <p num="3">However, even the graft-modified ethylene copolymers show insufficient adhesive strength to polystyrene resins, ABS resin, polyacrylonitrile resins, polyester resins, polycarbonate resins, polyvinylidene chloride resins, etc.</p>
    <p num="4">In this connection, Japanese Patent Laid-Open Publication No. 241144/1986 describes that a composition comprising a low-density ethylene/ ALPHA -olefin copolymer having been partially or wholly graft-modified with an unsaturated carboxylic acid or its derivative and a tackifier shows good adhesive strength to styrene resins.</p>
    <p num="5">Japanese Patent Laid-Open Publications No. 045445/1989 and No. 029331/1990 describe that an adhesive resin composition comprising a low-density ethylene/ ALPHA -olefin copolymer, an ethylene/vinyl acetate copolymer and polyethylene having been partially or wholly graft-modified with an unsaturated carboxylic acid or its derivative shows good adhesive strength to polyester resins, polycarbonate resins, polyvinylidene chloride resins, etc.</p>
    <p num="6">However, the low-density ethylene/ ALPHA -olefin copolymers shown in these publications sometimes exhibit insufficient adhesive strength in an atmosphere of high temperatures.</p>
    <p num="7">Accordingly, if adhesive ethylene copolymer resin compositions, which have good adhesive strength to polystyrene resins, ABS resin, polyacrylonitrile resins, polyester resins, polycarbonate resins, polyvinylidene chloride resins, etc. and are hardly decreased in the adhesive strength even in an atmosphere of high temperatures, are developed, their industrial value will be extremely high.</p>
    <p num="8">
      The ethylene copolymers are required to have different properties according to the molding method or use purpose.
      <br/>
      For example, in the high-speed production of inflation films, an ethylene copolymer having a high melt tension for the molecular weight must be selected to conduct stable high-speed molding without suffering instability of bubbles or break of bubbles.
      <br/>
      The similar properties are required to prevent sagging or break of resin in the hollow molding or to restrain neck-in to a minimum in the T-die molding.
      <br/>
      In the extrusion molding, further, the ethylene copolymer is required to have a small stress in a high-shear state from the viewpoints of improvement in qualities of molded products and economical efficiency such as reduction of power consumption in the molding process.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      Meanwhile, a method of improving a melt tension or a swell ratio (die swell ratio) of the ethylene polymers obtained by the use of Ziegler catalysts, particularly titanium catalysts, to thereby improve moldability is proposed in Japanese Patent Laid-Open Publications No. 90810/1981 and No. 106806/1985.
      <br/>
      However, the ethylene polymers, specifically low-density ethylene polymers, obtained by the use of the titanium catalysts generally have problems of wide composition distribution and surface tackiness of their molded products such as films.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      Of the ethylene polymers prepared by the use of Ziegler catalysts, those prepared by the use of chromium catalysts have relatively good melt tension but has a problem of poor heat stability.
      <br/>
      The reason is presumably that the ends of chain molecules of the ethylene polymers prepared by the use of the chromium catalysts easily become unsaturated bonds.
    </p>
    <p num="11">
      The ethylene polymers obtained by the use of metallocene catalysts among the Ziegler catalysts are known to have advantages such as narrow composition distribution and low surface tackiness of their molded products such as films.
      <br/>
      In Japanese Patent Laid-Open Publication No. 35007/1985, however, it is described that the ethylene polymers obtained by using, as catalysts, zirconocene compounds composed of cyclopentadiene derivatives contain one terminal unsaturated bond per one molecule, and therefore it is thought that they have bad heat stability, similarly to the ethylene polymers obtained by the use of the chromium catalysts.
      <br/>
      Additionally, there is a fear of bad flowability in the extrusion molding process because these ethylene polymers have narrow molecular weight distribution.
    </p>
    <p num="12">Accordingly, if ethylene polymers having high melt tension, small stress in the high-shear region, good heat stability, excellent mechanical strength and narrow composition distribution is developed, their industrial value will be extremely high.</p>
    <p num="13">The present invention is intended to solve such problems associated with the prior art as described above, and it is an object of the invention to provide adhesive ethylene copolymer resin compositions having high adhesive strength to polystyrene resins, ABS resin, polyacrylonitrile resins, polyester resins, polycarbonate resins and polyvinylidene chloride resins even in an atmosphere of high temperatures, and to provide laminates using the compositions.</p>
    <p num="14">It is another object of the invention to provide adhesive ethylene copolymer resin compositions having excellent heat stability, moldability and transparency and capable of forming film layers of high adhesive strength to metals and materials of high polarity, and to provide laminates using the compositions.</p>

      The measurement is carried out using a MT measuring machine (manufacture by Toyo Seiki Seisakusho K.K.) under the conditions of a resin temperature of 190 (degree)  C., an extrusion speed of 15 mm/min, a take-up rate of 10 to 20 m/min, a nozzle diameter of 2.09 mm and a nozzle length of 8 mm.
      <br/>
      In the pelletizing, 0.05% by weight of tri(2,4-di-t-butylphenyl)phosphate as a secondary antioxidant, 0.1% by weight of n-octadecyl-3-(4'-hydroxy-3',5'-di-t-butylphenyl)propionate as a heat stabilizer and 0.05% by weight of calcium stearate as a hydrochloric acid absorber are previously added to the ethylene/ ALPHA -olefin copolymer.

      The B value, which indicates width of the composition distribution, is determined in the following manner.

      In a sample tube having a diameter of 10 mm, about 200 mg of a copolymer is homogeneously dissolved in 1 ml of hexachlorobutadiene to give a sample.
      <br/>
      A 13 C-NMR spectrum of the sample is measured under the conditions of a measuring temperature of 120 (degree)  C., a measuring frequency of 25.05 MHz, a spectrum width of 1,500 Hz, a filter width of 1,500 Hz, a pulse repetition time of 4.2 sec, a pulse width of 7  MU sec and a number of integration times of 2,000 to 5,000.
      <br/>
      From the spectrum, the PE, PO and POE values are found, and the B value is calculated by the above equation.

A sample (concentration: 0.1% by weight, quantity: 500 microliters) was moved in the column at a rate of 1.0 ml/min using o-dichlorobenzene (available from Wako Junyaku Kogyo K.K.) as a mobile phase and 0.025% by weight of BHT (available from Takeda Chemical Industries, LTD.) as an antioxidant.
      <br/>
      A differential refractometer was used as a detector.

    <p num="345">The present invention will be further described with reference to the following examples, but it should be construed that the invention is in no way limited to those examples.</p>
    <p num="346">Preparation Example 1</p>
    <p num="347">
      In a 200-liter continuous reaction apparatus, copolymerization of ethylene and 1-octene was carried out under the conditions of a residence time of 1 hour, a polymerization temperature of 80 (degree)  C. and a polymerization pressure of 5.6 kg/cm2 -G.
      <br/>
      In this reaction, hexane, 1-octene, ethylene and hydrogen were fed at feed rates of 95.5 l/hr, 4.5 l/hr, 3.4 l/hr and 10 Nl/hr, respectively.
    </p>
    <p num="348">
      As catalyst components, rac-dimethylsilylene-bis+1-(2-methyl-4-phenylindenyl)}zirconium dichloride (catalyst component (a)), methylaluminoxane (catalyst component (b)) and triisobutylaluminum (catalyst component (d)) were used The catalyst component (a) and the catalyst component (b) are previously contacted with each other.
      <br/>
      To the polymerization system, the catalyst component (a) was fed at a feed rate of 0.024 mmol/hr in terms of zirconium, the catalyst component (b) was fed at a feed rate of 7.2 mmol/hr in terms of aluminum, and the catalyst component (d) was fed at a feed rate of 10 mmol/hr in terms of aluminum.
    </p>
    <p num="349">As a result of the polymerization reaction, a polymer, i.e., an ethylene/1-octene copolymer (sometimes abbreviated to "PEO" hereinafter), was obtained at a rate of 5.0 kg/hr.</p>
    <p num="350">
      The ethylene/1-octene copolymer (PEO) had an ethylene content of 85.2% by weight, a density of 0.870 g/cm3, MFR of 5.8 g/10 min, MT of 0.76 g, MFR10 /MFR2 of 8.2, a B value of 1.00 and a crystallinity of 0%.
      <br/>
      The number of unsaturated bonds present in molecule was not more than 1 per one molecule of the copolymer.
    </p>
    <p num="351">Modification Example 1</p>
    <p num="352">The ethylene/1-octene copolymer (PEO) of 825 g obtained in Preparation Example 1 was dissolved in 5.7 liters of toluene (reaction solvent) at 160 (degree)  C.</p>
    <p num="353">To the resulting toluene solution, a toluene solution of maleic anhydride (4.13 g/250 ml) and a toluene solution of dicumyl peroxide (DCP) (0.33 g/50 ml) were slowly fed through separate feed pipes over a period of 4 hours.</p>
    <p num="354">
      After the feeding, the reaction was continued at 160 (degree)  C. for 30 minutes.
      <br/>
      Then, the system was cooled to room temperature to precipitate a polymer.
      <br/>
      The precipitated polymer was filtered, then repeatedly washed with acetone and vacuum dried at 80 (degree)  C. for 1 day, to obtain the aimed modified ethylene/1-octene copolymer (sometimes abbreviated to "MAH-PEO" hereinafter).

      Silica of 5.0 kg having been dried at 250 (degree)  C. for 10 hours was suspended in 80 liters of toluene, and the resulting suspension was cooled to 0 (degree)  C. To the suspension was dropwise added 28.7 liters of a toluene solution of methylaluminoxane (Al: 1.33 mol/l) over a period of 1 hour.
      <br/>
      During the addition, the temperature of the system was maintained at 0 (degree)  C. Subsequently, the reaction was continued-at 0 (degree)  C. for 30 minutes.
      <br/>
      Then, the temperature of the system was raised to 95 (degree)  C. over a period of 1.5 hours, and the reaction was conducted at this temperature for 20 hours.
      <br/>
      Then, the system was cooled to 60 (degree)  C., and the supernatant liquid was removed by decantation.
    </p>
    <p num="436">
      The resulting solid was washed twice with toluene and resuspended in 80 liters of toluene.
      <br/>
      To the system, 6.6 liters of a toluene solution of bis(1,3-n-butylmethylcyclopentadienyl)zirconium dichloride (Zr: 34.0 mmol/l) and 2.0 liters of a toluene solution of bis(1,3-dimethylcyclopentadienyl)zirconium dichloride (Zr: 28.1 mmol/l) were dropwise added over a period of 30 minutes, and the reaction was further conducted at 80 (degree)  C. for 2 hours.
      <br/>
      Then, the supernatant liquid was removed, and the remainder was washed twice with hexane, to obtain a solid catalyst containing 3.6 mg of zirconium based on 1 g of the catalyst.
    </p>
    <p num="437">Preparation of Prepolymerized Catalyst</p>
    <p num="438">
      To 85 liters of hexane containing 1.7 mol of triisobutylaluminum were added 0.85 kg of the solid catalyst-obtained above and 255 g of 1-hexene, and prepolymerization of ethylene was performed at 35 (degree)  C. for 12 hours.
      <br/>
      Thus, a prepolymerized catalyst in which 10 g of polyethylene (prepolymer) was produced per 1 g of the solid catalyst was obtained.
      <br/>
      This ethylene polymer had an intrinsic viscosity � ETA � of 1.74 dl/g.

    <p num="439">Polymerization</p>
    <p num="440">
      In a continuous type fluidized bed gas phase polymerization reactor, copolymerization of ethylene and 1-hexene was carried out at a polymerization temperature of 80 (degree)  C. under a total pressure of 20 kg/cm2 -G.
      <br/>
      To the system, the prepolymerized catalyst obtained above and triisobutylaluminum were continuously fed at feed rates of 0.18 mmol/hr (in terms of zirconium atom) and 10 mmol/hr, respectively.
      <br/>
      Further, ethylene, 1-hexene, hydrogen and nitrogen were continuously fed to keep the gas composition constant during the polymerization (gas composition: 1-hexene/ethylene=0.030, hydrogen/ethylene=5.5 * 10-4, ethylene concentration=25%).
    </p>
    <p num="441">
      Thus, an ethylene/1-hexene copolymer (EH-1) was obtained in an yield of 6.0 kg/hr. The ethylene/1-hexene copolymer (EH-1) had a density of 0.923 g/cm3, MFR of 2.1 g/10 min, a melting point (Tm, temperature at maximum peak, by DSC) of 114.5 (degree)  C., a melt tension (MT) of 2.1 g and a quantity of decane-soluble portion (W) at 23 (degree)  C. of 0.26% by weight.
      <br/>
      The number of the unsaturated bonds was 0.09 per 1,000 carbon atoms, and it was 0.16 per one molecule of the polymer.
      <br/>
      The B value indicating distribution of 1-hexene in the copolymer chains was 1.02.

    <p num="442">Graft Modification</p>
    <p num="443">The ethylene/1-hexene copolymer (EH-1) of 825 g was dissolved in 5.7 liters of toluene (reaction solvent) at 160 (degree)  C.</p>
    <p num="444">To the resulting solution, a toluene solution of maleic anhydride (4.13 g/250 ml) and a toluene solution of dicumyl peroxide (DPC) (0.33 g/50 ml) were slowly fed through separate feed pipes over a period of 4 hours.</p>
    <p num="445">
      After the feeding, the reaction was continued at 160 (degree)  C. for 30 minutes.
      <br/>
      Then, the temperature of the system was cooled to room temperature to precipitate a polymer.
      <br/>
      The precipitated polymer was filtered, then repeatedly washed with acetone and vacuum dried at 80 (degree)  C. for 1 day, to obtain the aimed graft-modified ethylene/1-hexene copolymer (MAH-EH-1).
