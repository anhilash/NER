      Anodic valve metal foils, roughened and provided with dielectric layers, and collector metal foils (metal foils for collector) are laminated alternately to cross with cathodic electroconductive polymer layers therebetween.
      <br/>
      Anodic terminals and cathodic terminals are connected with the respective ends of the metal foils.
      <br/>
      For the anodic valve metal foils, an aluminum foil whose internal is an unroughened bulk metal layer is used.
      <br/>
      The collector metal foil is selected from the group consisting of an Al foil similar to the anodic valve metal foil, an Ni foil, a Cu foil, and an aluminum foil including carbon.
      <br/>
      As a result, a four-terminal capacitor to provide high capacitance, low impedance, high current-carrying capacity and less heat generation, as well as low ESR and low ESL, is obtained.

    <heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="1">The present invention relates to electrolytic capacitors for electric circuits of power supplies or the like.</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">
      Conventionally, electrolytic capacitors and multilayer ceramic capacitors have been well known.
      <br/>
      Electrolytic capacitors comprise valve metals such as Al and Ta, while multilayer ceramic capacitors comprise electrodes of, for example, Pd or Ni and dielectrics of BaTiO3 or the like.
      <br/>
      Most of these capacitors, which are used for most electric circuits such as supplies, have two electrode terminals.
      <br/>
      According to the recent trend for requirement for smaller electric circuits that can be operated at high frequencies operating circuits, capacitors are also required to have high capacitance and low impedance.
      <br/>
      Regarding power supply circuits for driving CPU of computers or switching power supply circuits, particularly, higher noise rejecting property and ripple current absorbing property are required to design circuits that will be operated at high frequencies.
      <br/>
      As a result, low impedance capacitors with low equivalent series resistance (ESR), low equivalent series inductance (ESL), against high ripple current absorbing property and high capacitance are demanded highly.
      <br/>
      To meet the requirements, especially for obtaining low ESR, electroconductive polymers with high electric conductivity have been studied and developed to be used for solid electrolytes for cathode (hereinafter, cathodic solid electrolytes) of electrolytic capacitors.
    </p>
    <p num="3">The structure of a conventional aluminum electrolytic capacitor is explained below with a reference to FIG. 10. A capacitor element is manufactured by the steps of:</p>
    <p num="4">
      preparing an anodic foil 81 by roughening and forming a dielectric layer on the surface and also preparing a surface-roughened current-collecting cathodic foil 82;
      <br/>
      arranging separators 83 between the anodic foil 81 and the current-collecting cathodic foil 82; and
      <br/>
      winding the anodic foil 81, the current-collecting cathodic foil 82 and the separators 83.
      <br/>
      This element is sealed in a case with an electrolytic solution.

      In addition to that, decreasing inductance value is further required to lower the impedance at high frequencies of about 100 kHz or more.
      <br/>
      Regarding this requirement, four-terminal capacitors (capacitors with four electrode terminals) are disclosed, for example, in Japanese Laid-Open Patent Publication (Tokkai-Hei) No. 6-267802, Tokkai-Hei No. 6-267801, and "SP-cap" (a trademark of Matsushita Electric Industrial Co., Ltd. see Proceeding of '92 Symposium on Switching Power Supply System (S6(1994)-1-1)).
      <br/>
      On the other hand, there is a need for development of capacitors to allow relatively high current to the primary or secondary side of a power supply, while meeting the requirement for operation at high frequencies.
      <br/>
      An invention of a capacitor to decrease the entire impedance and raise the current-carrying capacity is also disclosed by Tokkai-Hei No. 4-32214.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      The above-mentioned aluminum electrolytic capacitor, however, has some disadvantages, including its high impedance due to the use of an electrolytic solution comprising ethylene glycol or the like as the main solvent, and its high inductance components due to the wound electrode foil.
      <br/>
      Although a conventional tantalum electrolytic capacitor lowers ESR by using electroconductive polymers for the electrolyte, high capacitance cannot be obtained sufficiently.
      <br/>
      A conventional multilayer ceramic chip capacitor cannot obtain high capacitance in comparison with a conventional aluminum electrolytic capacitor.
      <br/>
      In conventional techniques where a four-terminal structure is adapted to lower ESL flowering the inductance value), sufficient capacitance has not been obtained.
      <br/>
      In addition, the capacitor itself will generate heat and fail at the primary or secondary side of a power supply where relatively high current from about several A to several dozens of a flows.
      <br/>
      Considering these disadvantages, such a conventional capacitor cannot be used to pass a high current while meeting the requirement for circuits to be operated at high frequencies.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      The reasons are as follows.
      <br/>
      In a conventional aluminum electrolytic capacitor prepared by winding a slender electrode foil, the resistance of the foil becomes high and the capacitor element will generate heat easily even if a four-terminal structure is used.
      <br/>
      A conventional tantalum electrolytic capacitor also can lower the ESR to some degree by using functional polymers.
      <br/>
      It is not easy, however, to raise capacitance per volume to provide high capacitance because a sintered body is used, and a four-terminal structure is difficult to obtain.
      <br/>
      A multilayer ceramic capacitor disclosed in Tokkai-Hei No. 4-32214 adapts a four-terminal structure to lower ESL, and increases current-carrying capacity by providing double electrode layers.
      <br/>
      For the manufacturing process, the material for the electrode layers should be a sintered metal with a thickness of several  MU m. Therefore, the available current value is limited to several amperes, so the lamination number should be increased to be used for the primary or secondary side of the power supply or the like where relatively high current will flow.
      <br/>
      Increasing the lamination is not easy in the manufacturing steps, or the volume per capacitance will be increased if many electrode layers are laminated.
      <br/>
      The electrode layer cannot be made thicker than 3  MU m substantially, since delamination will occur (the dielectric layer peels off from the electrode layer) in manufacturing.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      These problems are explained below with a reference to FIGS. 13 and 14. FIG. 13 shows an equivalent circuit of a conventional two-terminal capacitor (inside the dotted box).
      <br/>
      FIG. 14 is an equivalent circuit diagram to show problems for a conventional four-terminal capacitor (inside the dotted box).
      <br/>
      To provide a capacitor that can be operated at high frequencies, ESR (equivalent series resistance) 111 and ESL (equivalent series inductance) 112 should be lowered.
      <br/>
      ESR can be lowered by using electroconductive polymers for the electrolyte or by improving the collector.
      <br/>
      ESL can be lowered by providing a four-terminal structure as shown in FIG. 14. In the conventional four-terminal capacitor in FIG. 14, however, the impedance as a capacitor element is high, and the resistance R+ (the resistance of anode) 121 and R- (the resistance of cathodic collector) 122 acting as circuit wires greatly contribute to heat generation when current flows.
      <br/>
      Thus such a structure cannot be used for a circuit of a primary or secondary side of a power supply where a relatively high current will flow.
      <br/>
      Tb meet the requirement, any means to decrease the R+ 121 and R- should be taken.
    </p>
    <p num="11">
      As mentioned above, conventional capacitors cannot meet a requirement for high capacitance and a low impedance.
      <br/>
      When such a capacitor is used for a circuit operated at high frequencies at a primary or secondary side of a power supply where a relatively high current is flowing, the element generates much heat, and the applicable current will be restricted.

      This invention aims to solve the above-mentioned problems, and the goal and means of this invention are distinguishable from those of the conventional techniques.

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading>
    <p num="19">The present invention is described in detail below referring to the attached FIGS. 1-9.</p>
    <p num="20">(First Embodiment)</p>
    <p num="21">
      FIG. 1 shows the structure of a capacitor element of a four-terminal capacitor of this invention.
      <br/>
      The surface of an anodic valve metal foil 11 is roughened by an electrolytic etching or the like to increase the surface area.
      <br/>
      On the surface of this anodic valve metal foil 11, a dielectric layer 13 is formed by anodization.
      <br/>
      This anodic valve metal foil 11 and a collector metal foil 12 are crossed and overlapped at approximately their center parts.
      <br/>
      For conduction, the dielectric layer is not formed at both ends or end faces of the anodic valve metal foil 11 to be connected with the anodic terminals.
      <br/>
      The capacitor element is provided by forming an electroconductive polymer layer such as polypyrrole for the true cathode between the anodic valve metal foil 11 and the collector metal foil 12.
      <br/>
      By using an electroconductive polymer layer for the true cathode, and also by directly contacting the collector metal foil 12 and the electroconductive polymer layer, the ESR can be lowered.
      <br/>
      The ESL can be also lowered by alternately laminating the anodic valve metal foil 11 and the collector metal foil 12.

      <br/>
      The surfaces of the collector metal foils 24 can be roughened.

      FIG. 3 is an electron micrograph of a cross section of an anodic valve metal foil available for a four-terminal capacitor of this invention.
      <br/>
      The anodic valve metal foil shown in FIG. 3 is an aluminum foil in which columnar pores 32 are formed by electrolytic direct current etching to increase the surface area.
      <br/>
      In FIG. 3, 31 refers to an unroughened bulk metal layer.
      <br/>
      The foil thickness in FIG. 3 is about 150  MU m, and the bulk metal layer 31 is about 15  MU m in thickness.
      <br/>
      The bulk metal layer 31 can be modified, or be made thicker or thinner by controlling the length of the columnar pores 32 or the foil thickness.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the configuration of the anodic valve metal foil is not limited to this embodiment.
      <br/>
      The columnar pores 32 can be also used for a four-terminal capacitor for high-voltage, and the dielectric layer can be formed for high-voltage (the thickness is up to about 5800 angstrom; 10 angstrom/volt).
      <br/>
      For higher capacitance, the dielectric layer can be made thin, and etched with alternating current to increase the surface area.

    <p num="24">
      FIG. 4 is an electron micrograph of a cross section of a collector metal foil available for a four-terminal capacitor of this invention.
      <br/>
      The collector metal foil in FIG. 4 is an aluminum foil, roughened by electrolytic a.c. etching to increase the surface area.
      <br/>
      In FIG. 4, 41 refers to a bulk metal layer, and 42 refers to etching pores.
      <br/>
      The foil thickness in FIG. 4 is about 90  MU m, and the thickness of the bulk metal layer 41 is about 45  MU m. The thickness of this bulk metal layer can be modified according to the etching condition and foil thickness.
      <br/>
      The configuration of the collector metal foil is not limited to this embodiment.
    </p>
    <p num="25">
      By using an anodic valve metal foil and also a collector metal foil, both having inside unroughened bulk metal layers, this invention facilitates a circuit current flowing through the bulk metal layer.
      <br/>
      Thus, a four-terminal capacitor with less heat generation and a higher current-carrying capacity can be obtained.
      <br/>
      In addition, lamination of short electrode foils increases the cross-sectional area for the flowing current, and the resistance can be reduced.
      <br/>
      When 1 A current is applied to an electrode foil that is 100  MU m in thickness and has an unetched bulk metal layer (thickness:50  MU m, length: 17 cm, and width:1.5 cm), the heat generation is about 6 mW if the volume resistivity of Al is about 2.6 E-6  OMEGA cm.
      <br/>
      When the flowing current is 10 A, the heat generation is about 0.6 W If this foil is separated into ten equal pieces and the ten pieces are laminated, the total cross-sectional area of the bulk metal layer increases ten times while the length becomes 1/10, and thus the resistivity can be about 1/100.
      <br/>
      Heat generation also can be controlled to about 1/100.
    </p>
    <p num="26">
      The current-carrying capacity can be increased also by using a collector metal foil of an Ni foil, a Cu foil, or an aluminum foil including carbon particles, since such a foil allows use of any desired thickness.
      <br/>
      The volume resistivity of Ta is about 10.4 E-6  OMEGA cm, Al is about 2.6 E-6  OMEGA cm, Ni is about 6.8 E-6  OMEGA cm, and Cu, about 1.7 E-6  OMEGA cm.
      <br/>
      This indicates that the current-carrying capacity can be increased by using an aluminum foil with a bulk metal layer, an Ni foil, or a Cu foil.
    </p>
    <p num="27">
      Since Ni tends not to form an oxide layer on its surface, an Ni foil can reduce the interfacial resistance to the electroconductive polymer layer, and can help to lower the ESR.
      <br/>
      In addition, since the collector metal foils do not have any capacity due to the oxide coatings, the capacity of the capacitor can be increased.
    </p>
    <p num="28">
      FIG. 5 is a cross-sectional view to show the configuration of an aluminum foil including carbon particles, which can be used for a four-terminal capacitor of this invention.
      <br/>
      In FIG. 5, 51 refers to aluminum, and 52 refers to electroconductive carbon particles.
      <br/>
      The aluminum foil with carbon particles is configured to expose electroconductive carbon particles on the surfaces of the foil.
      <br/>
      Since the electroconductive polymer layer and carbon particles contact with each other without intervention by an oxide coating layer, the interfacial resistance can be reduced compared to the use of an aluminum foil that easily forms an oxide coating, and the ESR can be lowered.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, an electroconductive polymer layer can be formed on the aluminum foil including carbon particles by an electrolytic polymerization, which is not available in conventional techniques, since an aluminum foil including carbon particles is used.
      <br/>
      As a result, the cost for producing a four-terminal capacitor of this invention can be reduced.

      A four-terminal capacitor shown in FIG. 2 was manufactured.

      For the anodic valve metal foils 23, a 100  MU m-thick aluminum foil with a purity of at least 99.98% was used.
      <br/>
      The surface of the anodic valve metal foil 23 was roughened by an electrolytic a.c. etching in a 35 (degree)  C. solution containing 10 wt % hydrochloric acid before the same foil 23 was cut into rectangular pieces.

      A capacitor element structurally based on an aluminum electrolytic capacitor (a 105 (degree)  C. specification, 400 working volts, anodization voltage:580V) was prepared by leading out respectively two portions of the anodic leads and cathodic leads from both ends of the anodic foil and those of the current-collecting cathode foil, and winding these via a separator.

      The electrode foil and cathode foil were 19 cm in length and 2 cm in width.

      A dielectric layer was formed by a constant-voltage anodization at 580V using a 60 (degree)  C. aqueous solution containing 5 wt % ammonium adipate.
      <br/>
      The thickness of the bulk metal layer of the anodic foil was 3 to 5  MU m. For the current-collecting cathode foil, a 50  MU m-thick aluminum foil was used.

      In FIG. 9, the "two-terminal measurement" means the lowering of ESL of the four-terminal capacitor in Example 3 when the capacitor was used as a two-terminal capacitor.
