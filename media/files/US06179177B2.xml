      <br/>
      Field of the Invention
    </p>
    <p num="2">The present invention relates to a band, such as a watch band or the like.</p>
    <p num="3">2. Description of Related Art</p>
    <p num="4">Conventionally, a watch band attached to a case and having a structure, as shown in FIG. 17 has been known.</p>
    <p num="5">
      Such a band comprises a band body 1 made of elastic rubber, a female buckle 2 attached on one end portion of the band body 1, and a male buckle 3 detachably attached on the other end portion thereof.
      <br/>
      In a state that the male buckle 3 is detached from the band body 1, the band body 1 is inserted into each insertion hole 6 of two band attachment portions 5 which are provided on a case complete 4, so that the case complete 4 can be attached to the band body 1.
      <br/>
      Thereafter, the male buckle 3 is attached to the other end portion of the band body 1.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      In such a case, an attachment hole 2a into which the one end portion of the band body 1 is inserted is formed in the female buckle 2.
      <br/>
      The one end portion of the band body 1 is inserted into the attachment hole 2a to be turned back.
      <br/>
      By securing the turned and overlapped portions to each other, the female buckle 2 is attached to the one end portion of the band body 1.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      Two attachment holes 3a and 3b into which the other end portion of the band body 1 is inserted are formed in the male buckle 3.
      <br/>
      By inserting the other end portion of the band body 1 into one attachment hole 3a and inserting a top end portion thereof into the other attachment hole 3b to be turned back, the male buckle 3 is detachably attached to the other end portion of the band body 1.
      <br/>
      A watch glass 7 is attached on an upper surface of the case 4, a case back 8 is attached on a lower surface thereof, and a watch module 9 is contained in an inside thereof.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      However, according to the watch band, since the female buckle 2 is attached to the one end portion of the band body 1 made of elastic rubber, while the male buckle 3 is attached to the other end portion thereof, positions of the female buckle 2 and the male buckle 3 are not stable to tend to move when the band body 1 is attached to the wrist.
      <br/>
      Therefore, there is a problem that it is difficult to attach the female buckle 2 and the male buckle 3 by one hand.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      Further, with the watch band, the other end portion of the band body 1 is inserted into the two attachment holes 3a and 3b of the male buckle 3 with being turned back in order, thereby the male buckle 3 is detachably attached to the other end portion of the band body 1.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, even if a length of the band body 1 is adjusted by the male buckle 3, the attached portion of the male buckle 3 maybe loosened.
      <br/>
      In this case, there is a problem that it is not possible to suitably fit the watch band to the wrist unless the length of the band body 1 is adjusted again.
    </p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="10">An object of the present invention is to provide a band whose handling for attaching and detaching of a band body thereof to the wrist or the like is improved, and which can be attached to the wrist or the like with suitable fitting.</p>

      <br/>
      In one end portion, i.e., a right end portion 10a in FIG. 1, of the first band member 10, a string 16 described later is attached, while in the other end portion, i.e., a left end portion 10b in the Figure, a D-shaped connecting ring 17 is attached.
      <br/>
      In the case, at the right end portion 10a of the first band member 10, a right end portion of the upper sheet 13 wraps a portion of the string 16 to be turned back, and the turned back portion is sewn to be secured to the lower sheet 14 and also be secured to the second band member 11 by sewing.
      <br/>
      At the left end portion 10b of the first band member 10, a left end portion of the upper sheet 13 is inserted into the connecting ring 17 to be turned back and the turned back portion is sewn to be secured only to the lower sheet 14.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, the left end portion 10b of the first band member 10 is in a free state against the second band member 11.
      <br/>
      A woven name-sheet 13a is secured on an upper surface in a side of the right end portion 10a of the first band member 10, that is, on an upper surface in a side of the right end portion of the upper sheet 13.
    </p>
    <p num="16">
      The first fastening member 12 comprises a pair of sheet fasteners 12a and 12b, that is, a pair of sheets having resilient hook and loop fasteners (sold under the registered trademark "Magic Tape" or "VELCRO") which are attached to surfaces of the first band member 10 and the second band member 11, facing to each other.
      <br/>
      One sheet fastener 12a is attached to a lower surface of the lower sheet 14 of the first band member 10, while the other sheet fastener 12b is attached to an upper surface of the second band member 11.
      <br/>
      The sheet fastener l2a is attached to the position for the case 4 to be set thereon, of the lower sheet 14, while the sheet fastener 12b is attached to the second band member 11, extending from the position for the case 4 to be set thereon to the left end portion 11b of the second band member 11.
    </p>
    <p num="17">
      The second fastening member 15 comprises a pair of sheet fasteners 15a and 12b attached on facing surfaces of the overlapped portions to each other at the both end portions 11a and 11b of the second band member 11 when the second band member 11 is bent to be attached to the wrist.
      <br/>
      One sheet: fastener 15a is attached on a lower surface of the right end portion 11a of the second band member 11, while a side of the left end portion of the sheet fastener 12b of the first fastening member 12 serves as the other sheet fastener which is attached on an upper surface of the left end portion 11b of the second band member 11.
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      With the string 16, an approximately intermediate portion thereof is attached to the right end portion 10a of the first band member 10 and the string 16 is separated in two portions in both sides of the right end portion 10a.
      <br/>
      The two portions of the string 16 are extended to a further right side of the right end portion 10a of the first band member 10.
      <br/>
      A hook member 18 is connected to the extended portion of the string 16 by a clasping fixture 19.
      <br/>
      The two portions of the string 16 are turned back at the clasping fixture 19.
      <br/>
      On top end portions of the separated strings 16, a securing member 20 is attached.

      As shown in FIG. 2, the two outside strings 16 separated in both sides are passed through outsides of the second clasping ring 19b along the both side portions 18b of the hook member 18, inserted into the first clasping ring 19a from the left side to the right side in FIG. 5A, and turned back.
      <br/>
      The turned back two inside strings 16 are grouped together and inserted into the second clasping ring 19b from the right side to the left side in FIG. 5A. In the state, the hook portion 18a of the hook member 18 is hooked to the connecting ring 17, thereafter the two inside strings 16 are pulled in a direction of parting from the hook member 18.
      <br/>
      Thereby, the first and second clasping rings 19a and 19b tighten and clasp the strings 16.
      <br/>
      In the state, when the back end of the hook member 18 is pushed up by raising the releasing ring 19c, and the hook member 18 is rotated about the hook portion 18a in the top end, the strings 16 clasped by the first and second clasping rings 19a and 19b are loosened.

      <br/>
      In the intermediate portion of the piece body 21a, a holding recess portion, i.e., a holding portion 21c is formed for holding the two inside strings 16 in the tied state, which is turned back by the clasping fixture 19.
    </p>
    <p num="25">Next, functions of the above-described watch band will be explained as follows.</p>
    <p num="26">
      In a case of putting the watch band on the wrist, as shown in FIG. 7, at first, the second band member 11 is wound around the wrist, thereby the right end portion 11a of the second band member 11 is overlapped on the left end portion 11b thereof.
      <br/>
      Then, the right end portion 11a and the left end portion 11b of the second band member 11 are fastened by the second fastening member 15, thereby the second band member 11 is temporarily secured to the wrist.
      <br/>
      In the state, the hook portion 18a of the hook member 18 connected to the string 16 at the right end portion 10a of the first band member 10 is hooked to the connecting ring 17 attached to the left end portion 10b of the first band member 10, thereafter the strings 16 in a side of the securing member 20 are pulled in the direction of parting from the hook member 18.
      <br/>
      Thereby, with tightening the second band member 11 by the first band member 10 to fit it to the wrist, the string 16 is tightened to be clasped by the first and second clasping rings 19a and 19b of the clasping fixture 19.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, it is possible to improve the handling for attaching of the watch band to the wrist, to easily control a degree of the fitness of the watch band to the wrist by controlling the strength of pulling the string 16, and to suitably attach the watch band to the wrist with fitting without slacking.
      <br/>
      Thereafter, the strings 16 in the side of the securing member 20 are inserted to the holding recess portion 21c of the string holding piece 21 to be secured; and the securing member 20 is, as shown in FIG. 2, placed and secured between the two strings 16 separated in the both sides.
      <br/>
      Thereby, it is possible to secure the securing member 20 and the string 16 to the watch band without dangling to become a hindrance.
    </p>
    <p num="27">
      In a case of detaching the watch band from the wrist, at first, the strings 16 in the side of the securing member 20 are taken out from the holding recess portion 21c of the string holding piece 21 to be moved in a side of the case 4, thereby the releasing ring 19c of the clasping fixture 19 is exposed.
      <br/>
      When the releasing ring 19c is picked to be pulled up, the position restricting portions 22 formed in the releasing ring 19c are brought into contact with the both side portions 18b of the hook member 18.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, the rotating position of the releasing ring 19c is restricted, thereby it becomes to easily pick the releasing ring 19c.
      <br/>
      In the state, when the back end of the hook member 18 is pulled up by the releasing ring 19c, and the hook member 18 is rotated upward about the hook portion 18a in the top end to be laid in a side of the connecting ring 17, it is possible to easily loosen to release the clasping of the string 16 clasped by the first and second clasping rings 19a and 19b.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, when the hook member 18 is rotated to be in the original state again, a play is occurred in the connecting of the hook portion 18a against the connecting ring 17 as the string 16 is loosened, thereby it is possible to simply and easily detach the hook portion 18a from the connecting ring 17.
      <br/>
      Thereafter, the both end portions 11a and 11b of the second band member 11 are pulled apart from each other, and the fastening with the second band member 11 by the second fastening member 15 is released, so that it is possible to easily detach the watch band from the wrist.
    </p>
    <p num="28">
      In a case of exchanging the watch band to another one, as shown in FIG. 1, at first, the left end portion 10b of the first band member 10 and the left end portion 11b of the second band member 11 are pulled apart up and down, respectively, thereby each sheet fastener 12a and 12b of the first fastening member 12 is pulled apart from each other, so that the fastening between the first band member 10 and the second band member 11 by the first fastening member 12 is released.
      <br/>
      Then, the left end portion 10b of the first band member 10 is detached from the second band member 11 to be in a free state.
      <br/>
      In the state, the left end portion 10b of the first band member 10 is pulled out from each insertion hole 6 of the two band attachment portions 5 provided on the case 4, so that it is possible to easily detach the case 4 from the first band member 10.
      <br/>
      On the other hand, the left end portion 10b of the first band member 10 is inserted into each insertion hole 6 of the two band attachment portions 5 of the case 4, thereafter the first band member 10 and the second band member 11 are fastened by the first fastening member 12.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, it is possible to easily attach the case 4 to the first band member 10 and to attach the first band member 10 and the second band member 11 to each other.
      <br/>
      Therefore, it is possible to simply and easily exchange the watch band.

    <p num="29">
      As above-described, according to the watch band, it is possible to improve the handling for attaching and detaching of the watch band to the wrist, to suitably attach the watch band to the wrist with fitting without slacking, and to simply and easily exchange the watch band to the case 4.
      <br/>
      Particularly, the first band member 10 has the length which is shorter than that of the second band member 11, and the both end portions 10a and 10b of the first band member 10 are connected through the string 16, the connecting ring 17 and the hook member 18.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, even if the watch band has a double layered structure when it is attached to the wrist, it is possible to obtain a watch band having a suitable design without a thick appearance of the band as a whole.

      However, it is not limited to that, for example, as shown in FIG. 9, a release handling portion 23 can be made as a body in one end portion of the first clasping ring 19a with projecting upward.
      <br/>
      In such a structure, the release handling portion 23 is picked to be rotated to be apart from the second clasping ring 19b, so that the string 16 clasped by the first and second clasping rings 19a and 19b can be loosened to be released.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, it is not required the releasing ring 19c as another piece of the clasping fixture 19 in the first embodiment.
      <br/>
      Therefore, it is possible to reduce the number of pieces of the watch band, and to produce the watch band at a low cost using an easy fabrication method.
