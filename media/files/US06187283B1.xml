      Field of the Invention
    </p>
    <p num="3">
      The present invention relates to methods for synthesizing zeolites from Y-zeolite.
      <br/>
      More particularly, the present invention relates to methods for synthesizing synthetic analogues of heulandite, brewsterite, epistilbite, harmotome and gmelinite zeolites containing alkaline earth cations using Y-zeolite as a starting material

      Description of the Related Art
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      Ever since Barrer's pioneering work (Barrer, et al., J. Chem. Soc., (1961), 971), numerous studies in zeolite synthesis have concentrated on the use of organic structure-directing agents (SDAs) in the synthesis mixture that affect the crystallization of zeolite.
      <br/>
      Debate continues on the roles of various types of organic components in the crystallization process.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      One problem with using organic reagents in zeolite synthesis is their cost.
      <br/>
      In order to reduce the expense of zeolite production, syntheses that do not use SDAs are desirable.
      <br/>
      Many natural zeolites that have unique structures have not been synthesized.
      <br/>
      Thus, new routes to synthesize known active zeolites without organic reagents could provide low cost materials Syntheses of the heulandite (HEU) family of zeolites, the most abundant zeolites found in nature, through a number of routes have been reported by Satokawa, et al.
      <br/>
      Microporous Mater., 8 (1997), 49; Williams, Chem.
      <br/>
      Commun., (1997), 2113; Zhao, et al., Zeolites, 19 (1997), 366-369; and Zhao, et al., Microporous Mater., 21 (1998), 371-379.
      <br/>
      These syntheses involve conventional hydrothermal crystallization using alkaline metal cations and amorphous oxides (not zeolites).
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      Most natural zeolites have alkaline earth cations as the dominant cation (i.e., highest concentration relative to all other metal cations present) in their composition.
      <br/>
      Because of this fact, we studied use of alkaline earth cations to prepare HEU, harmotome (PHI), brewsterite (BRE), epistilbite (EPI) and Yugawaralite (YUG) type zeolites from either zeolite P or L, as reported in Khodabandeh, et al., Microporous Mater. 12:(4-6) 347-359 (December 1997) Khodabandeh, et al., Microporous Mater., 11:(1-2) 87-95 (August 1997), Khodabandeh, et al., Microporous Mater., 9: (3-4) 149-160 (September 1997), Khodabandeh, et al., Chem. Comm., (10) 1205-1206 (May 1996).
      <br/>
      Of importance to our synthetic methodology is the starting material, e.g., the ratio of Si/Al and framework density.
      <br/>
      Hydrothermal conversions without organic SDAs can be effected only by converting a zeolite with a relatively lower framework density to one of a relatively higher framework density.
      <br/>
      Table 1 lists framework density for several zeolites.

    <p num="9">The choice of the starting material for zeolite synthesis with alkaline earth cations is of critical importance.</p>
    <p num="10">
      In 1960, Koizumi and Roy reported synthesis of a heulandite-type zeolite from the composition CaO.Al2 O3 .7SiO2.5H2 O at temperatures between 250 (degree)  C. and 360 (degree)  C. and a pressure range of 15,000 to 37,000 psi.
      <br/>
      In 1981, Wirsching obtained heulandite by hydrothermal alteration of rhyolitic glass under the action of CaCl2 solutions at temperatures of 200 (degree)  C. to 250 (degree)  C. and reaction times of around 80 days.
      <br/>
      Additionally, some syntheses for clinoptilolite zeolites have been reported.
    </p>
    <p num="11">
      Without methods described herein or others developed by one of the inventors, it is either difficult or impossible to produce other zeolites synthetically.
      <br/>
      For example, gmelinite cannot be synthesized from zeolite P or L because the framework density gmelinite is relatively lower than that of either zeolite P or L.
    </p>
    <p num="12">
      Harmotome, another rare zeolite of hydrothermal origin which has the phillipsite (PHI) topology, is characterized by three dimensional channels consisting of pores composed of eight tetrahedral atoms.
      <br/>
      The dominant cation in the zeolite is Ba.
    </p>
    <p num="13">Epistilbite, another rare zeolite of hydrothermal origin, has previously been produced by hydrothermal treatment of rhyolytic glass at 250 (degree)  C. and from powdered SiO2 glass at 250 (degree)  C. It has a structure characterized by intersecting channels composed of eight and ten tetrahedral atoms.</p>
    <p num="14">
      Zeolite beta (*BEA) (occurs naturally as mineral Tschernichite) and Boggsite (BOG) each can be synthesized from Y zeolite according to the methods of the present invention.
      <br/>
      Tschernichite has a Si/Al of about 5, but this ratio has not been synthesized Boggsite has Si/Al of about 5, but as far as the inventors are aware, has not yet been synthesized.
    </p>
    <p num="15">
      Since the naturally occurring materials are rare, but so potentially useful, it would be advantageous to enable less rigorous and therefore less expensive routes for producing greater quantities of these materials.

      Particularly of interest are routes that can produce materials with few or no impurities, i.e., anything other than the desired zeolite product (e.g., other zeolite by-product).
    </p>
    <p num="16">
      Y-zeolite (FAU) has long been used as an industrial catalyst due to its high activity and low cost.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, Y-zeolite can be used as an aluminum source for ZSM-5 synthesis (e.g., as reported by Bourgogne, et al., U.S. Pat. No. 4,503,024) and to prepare novel materials such as zeolite beta with low Si/Al ratios (Zones, et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,340,563).
      <br/>
      When Y-zeolice can be used as an aluminum source in zeolite synthesis, the type of cations for ion exchange is very important.
      <br/>
      For example, although relative to the control (Na--Y), Co--Y or Cu--Y reaction rates to chabazite were just as fast, Fe and Cr inhibit this reaction completely, as reported by Zones, J. Chem. Soc. Farad. Trans., 86 (1990), 3467 and 87 (1991), 3709 and Stud.

      Here, we focus on the use of Y-zeolite as a starting material for hydrothermal conversion with alkaline earth cations.

      The factors that determine the products are shown to be the Si/Al ratio in the starting zeolite, the presence or absence of seeds, the composition of the reaction medium, and the reaction time.

    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="19">
      The present invention provides synthetic routes to form zeolites using Y-zeolite as a starting material.
      <br/>
      In one aspect, methods according to the invention use an alkaline earth cation in a hydrothermal alteration of Y-zeolite.

    <heading>DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
    <p num="22">The preferred embodiments of the invention are now described, in which a general method for the production of alkaline earth cation-containing zeolites from Y-zeolite is used.</p>
    <p num="23">
      The invention will be better understood by reference to the following definitions.
      <br/>
      Since naturally occurring zeolites have different names according to their structures and compositions, clarity is needed when referring to zeolites.
    </p>
    <p num="24">
      By "zeolites," we mean microporous crystalline aluminosilicates as are commonly known throughout the literature.
      <br/>
      We refer to zeolites by the names recognized as indicating their framework topologies and their chemical compositions.
      <br/>
      The relevant framework topologies are defined in the Atlas of Zeolite Structure Types, published by Butterworth-Heinemann for the structure commission of the International Zeolite Association (IZA), third edition (Meier and Olsen editors), which is incorporated herein by reference.
    </p>
    <p num="25">
      By the term "dominant" as used herein, we mean an alkaline earth cation having largest content relative to all other metal cations present.
      <br/>
      In the zeolite or reaction medium, the content of all other metal cations is preferably less than about 1%.
    </p>
    <p num="26">
      CIT-3 is a synthetic analogue of the natural calcium form of heulandite zeolite.
      <br/>
      This material typically crystallizes with a composition of CaO:Al2 O3 :7SiO2 :6H2 O and has a two-dimensional pore system defined by intersecting 8- and 10-member ring pores.
    </p>
    <p num="27">
      CIT-4 is the first analogue of the rare natural zeolite brewsterite.
      <br/>
      It has a composition of SrO:Al2 O3 :5.8SiO2 :4.5H2 O and possesses the brewsterite topology, which consists of intersecting 8-member ring pores in two dimensions.
    </p>
    <p num="28">Gmelinite is a natural sodium-calcium zeolite with a typical composition of 8Na2 O:4CaO:Al2 O3 :4SiO2 :6H2 O. The main 12-member ring channels are interconnected at right angles by two-dimensional system of 8-member ring channels, and thus form a three-dimensional channel system.</p>
    <p num="29">
      Harmotome is the Ba-dominant analogue of the zeolite phillipsite (Gottardi, et al., Natural Zeolites, Springer-Verlag, Heidelberg (1985)).
      <br/>
      It has a typical composition of BaO:Al2 O3 :6SiO2 :6H2 O and the phillipsite topology, which consists of 8-member ring channels in three crystallographic directions.
    </p>
    <p num="30">Analcime is a sodium containing zeolite, with a typical composition Na2 O:Al2 O3 :4 SiO2 :H2 O and has irregular channels formed by highly distorted 8-membered rings.</p>
    <p num="31">Zeolite Y is the sodium aluminosilicate analogue of the natural faujasite possessing three-dimensional 12-membered ring pores The Si/Al ratio of the Y-zeolite useful in the methods of the present invention is at least 2.0, preferably between 2.0 and 10.0, more preferably between 2.0 and 5.0 and most preferably between 2.0 and 3.5.</p>
    <p num="32">Exemplary Syntheses and Analyses:</p>
    <p num="33">EXAMPLE 1</p>
    <p num="34">Zeolite-Y Starting Materials</p>
    <p num="35">
      Exemplary zeolite Y starting materials prepared were Na--Y zeolites with Si/Al ratios from 2.0 to 3.5. For example, Na--Y zeolite with Si/Al=2.0 was prepared in a TEFLON jar by adding 12.0 g of colloidal SiO2 (LUDOX HS-30) to a stirred solution containing 2.2 g of 50% w/w solution of NaOH and 1.7 g of sodium aluminate (Na2 O:Al2 O3 :3H2 O, EM) in 13.0 ml of water.
      <br/>
      This mixture was stirred at room temperature for 20-24 hours.
      <br/>
      The resulting gel was transferred to a TEFLON-lined stainless steel autoclave and heated at 120 (degree)  C. for 12 hours under autogenous pressure.
      <br/>
      After cooling the mixture, the zeolite synthesized was filtered and dried For the synthesis of Na--Y zeolites with Si/Al up to 5, 15-crown-5 (i.e., 1,4,7,10,13-pentaoxacyclopentadecane) was added first to the stirred solution.
      <br/>
      For example, Y-zeolite with Si/Al of 3.5 was prepared as follows: 1.4 g of sodium aluminate were added to a solution containing 1.8 g of 15-crown-5 and 1.8 g of 50% w/w NaOH in 10.0 g water. 16.0 g of colloidal silica were then added and the mixture stirred at room temperature for 20-24 hours.
      <br/>
      The resulting reaction mixture was transferred to a TEFLON-lined autoclave reactor and statically heated at a temperature of 110 (degree)  C. for 7 days.
    </p>
    <p num="36">For Si/Al greater than about 5, other synthetic routes are known or the Y-zeolite can be purchased commercially.</p>
    <p num="37">
      Ion exchange of zeolites was carried out (1 g zeolite/100 mL solution) using 1.0N chloride solutions of the desired cation at 70-80 (degree)  C. overnight (performed twice).
      <br/>
      Other solutions of the desired cation may be used, for example, nitrate or acetate.
      <br/>
      Carbonate solutions do not work due to low solubility in water.
      <br/>
      Thus, the method of the invention is not limited to use of chloride solutions.
    </p>
    <p num="38">
      The hydrothermal reaction of Y-zeolite with chloride solutions of the desired alkaline earth metal cation(s) and seeds, if used, at a temperature of 240 (degree)  C. (in TEFLON-lined autoclave) was accomplished over the course of 7 to 24 days.
      <br/>
      The pH of each solution was adjusted by adding a small amount of a concentrated hydroxide solution of the desired alkaline earth cation.
      <br/>
      Seeds, when used, were natural brewsterite from Strontian, Scotland and natural heulandite from near Poona, India.
      <br/>
      The synthesized products CIT-3 or CIT-4 were also used as seeds instead of natural brewsterite or heulandite.

      <br/>
      In the case of routine analysis and identification of phases., the samples were analyzed in the 2 THETA  range 2-51 in steps of 0.03 (degree)  under a scan speed of 5.0 (degree) /min.

      <br/>
      Tetrakis (trimethylsilyl) silane (TMS) was used as the external reference material for 29 Si NMR chemical shift determination, and all chemical shifts are reported in ppm relative to TMS.

      The adsorption isotherms for vapor-phase compounds were measured at 25 (degree)  C. using a McBain-Bakr balance.
      <br/>
      The adsorption amount of vapor phase compounds was measured at a pressure of P/P0 =0.3. Prior to the adsorption experiments, the samples were dehydrated at 250 (degree)  C. under vacuum for 5 hours.

      The 29 Si NMR spectra for four Y-zeolite samples with Si/Al varying from 2.0 to 3.5 are shown in FIG. 1.

      The four NMR peaks in each spectrum observed correspond to the following environments in the direction of decreasing chemical shift: Si(3Al), Si(2Al), S(1Al) and Si(0Al.).
      <br/>
      Assuming a random distribution of aluminum in the framework, it is possible to calculate the framework Si/Al ratio according to the equation:  (Equation image '1' not included in text)

      The conversion of Sr--Y zeolite to gmelinite occurred with Sr--Y zeolite having Si/Al under 2.4 and only in the absence of seeds.
      <br/>
      It appears that Sr--Y zeolite with low Si/Al ratio was converted to gmelinite because the Si/Al ratio of gmelinite is normally close to 2 0 (slashed zero)  On the other hand, only amorphous phases were obtained from Sr--Y zeolite with Si/Al ratios over 3.0 in the absence of seeds.

      As shown in Table 5, Sr--Y zeolite having Si/Al ratio of 3.5 was not transformed into crystalline phase, even in the presence of seeds The results presented above show that Y-zeolites having Si/Al in a certain range are particularly useful starting materials for the preparation of a number of alkaline earth zeolites using methods of the present invention.

    <p num="70">
      As shown by the data presented above, gmelinite was synthesized from Sr--Y zeolite with Si/Al ratio under 2.4 in a strontium-dominant reaction medium.
      <br/>
      Although research of gmellnite synthesis with strontium cation has been carried out for a long time, reproducibility of qmelinite synthesis was sometimes nil (Barrer, et al., 86 Hydrothermal Chemistry of Silicates; Part XII, (1964) 485-497).
      <br/>
      In order to determine the factors responsible for the lack of reproducibility of this synthesis, great care has been taken by the inventors to standardize factors such as temperature, heating time (duration in days), pH, solution concentration of strontium, and ratio of solution/starting zeolite.

      A number of alkaline earth zeolites have been synthesized through hydrothermal conversion of Y-zeolite with solutions containing alkaline earth cations according to methods of the present invention.

      Barium was a suitable cation for the synthesis of harmotome, calcium was not effective for the conversion of Y-zeolite, and strontium showed the greatest variety of behaviors for the hydrothermal conversion of Y-zeolite to synthetic analogues of the natural zeolites.

      Gmelinite synthesized from Sr--Y zeolite had adsorption capacities that lie between these of natural (faulted) GME and a reported fault-free GME (Daniels, et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc., (1978) 3097; Breck, Zeolite Molecular Sieves (1974) 625).
