    <heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="3">The present invention relates to a dielectric filter comprising a plurality of dielectric blocks and a transceiver using the dielectric filter.</p>
    <heading>PRIOR ART</heading>
    <p num="4">
      In a conventional dielectric filter of the kind referred to above, there are provided a plurality of resonators in a hexahedral rectangular dielectric unit.
      <br/>
      All of the six surfaces of the filter are substantially coated with an electrode film, and therefore, the filter does not require a shielding case or a mounting bracket, that is, the filter is able to be mounted on the surface of a circuit board.
      <br/>
      In the conventional structure as described above, since a plurality of resonators are provided in one dielectric block, many different kinds of molds must be provided if filters having different numbers of resonators are desired.
      <br/>
      More specifically, as the dielectric filter of this type is generally formed of ceramic material, the dielectric filter is manufactured by placing a ceramic material powder in a mold and baking the mold.
      <br/>
      Therefore, a different mold must be prepared for each type of filter to be manufactured, thus raising manufacturing costs.
      <br/>
      Moreover, since the distance between the resonators is determined by the size and shape of each mold, the degree of coupling between the resonators is hard to set.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      In another example of a conventional dielectric filter of a comb line type, the degree of coupling of the resonators and the frequency of each resonator are interrelated as a function of the structure of the filter.
      <br/>
      One is changed when the other is changed, and each affects the other, and therefore, it is difficult to adjust the resonant frequency and the degree of coupling independently of each other.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      In a further example of a known dielectric filter, a single resonator is provided in a single dielectric block which is coupled with another dielectric block having a resonator.
      <br/>
      Since a separate element is used to couple the dielectric blocks in this example, the structure is complicated and the number of parts is increased.
      <br/>
      This complicates manufacturing procedures and increases manufacturing costs.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      Yet another known dielectric filter is composed of a plurality of dielectric bodies, each of which is provided with a resonator and bonded together to form a unit.
      <br/>
      The resonator used is a quarter-wave resonator wherein one end face is short-circuited and the other end face is open-circuited.
      <br/>
      Electromagnetic energy leaks from the open end face, leading to undesirable coupling of resonators.
      <br/>
      It is very difficult to achieve a predetermined degree of coupling with this structure.
      <br/>
      Further, a shielding cover to prevent undesired coupling with an external circuit is required.
      <br/>
      There is also a limit to the degree the transceiver can be miniaturized when this type of filter is employed.
    </p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="8">
      A central object of the present invention is to provide a novel dielectric filter which can be easily manufactured to be compact in size, and with a variable number of resonators, which does not require a bracket or a shielding case and which does not require different molds for each resonator.
      <br/>
      It is a further object of the present invention to reduce the number of components and reduce manufacturing costs.
      <br/>
      It is a further object of the present invention to provide a filter wherein the resonant frequency of each resonator and the degree of coupling between resonators can be independently set or adjusted as desired.

      An island in the exposed part, having the conductive film coated thereon, is used as a first input coupling electrode 113.

      The fourth dielectric block 640 is coated with a thin conductive film 642 by a common electrode film forming method with the use of silver or copper, that is, a conductive material.
      <br/>
      Specifically, the outer surfaces of the six surfaces and the inner surface of the opening 641 except for the areas discussed below are coated with the conductive film.
      <br/>
      The film 642 at the top end, bottom end, right side and left side surfaces of the fourth dielectric block 640 is formed as shown in the development diagram of FIG. 44. As is clear in FIG. 44, an exposed rectangular area is formed at the right side surface of the dielectric block 640 in an area where the magnetic field shows superior energy component.
      <br/>
      The exposed area defines a fourth input coupling window 643 for the inductive coupling.
      <br/>
      A further exposed rectangular area is provided at the bottom surface of the dielectric block where the electric field has a predominating energy component.
      <br/>
      An island shaped electrode is formed in this exposed area to define a fourth output coupling electrode 644.
      <br/>
      A pair of small ring-shaped exposed areas 645 are formed near the front and rear side surfaces, respectively, in the inner surface of the opening 641, as illustrated in FIG. 39.
    </p>
    <p num="128">
      The fourth dielectric block 640 in the above constitution has, as represented in the equivalent circuit diagram of FIG. 41, the resonator R6-4 defined by the opening 641, the inductive coupling window 643 at the right side surface thereof and an external coupling capacity Ce between the inner surface of the opening 641 and the bottom end surface.
      <br/>
      The fourth input coupling window 643 is formed at the right side surface of the fourth dielectric block, and the fourth output coupling electrode 644 to be an output terminal of the filter VI is formed at the bottom surface of the dielectric block.
      <br/>
      Moreover, two stray capacities Cs are formed at the ring-shaped exposed areas 645 in the inner surface of the opening 641.
    </p>
    <p num="129">
      The four dielectric blocks constituted in the above-described manner are aligned side by side such that the left side surface of the first dielectric block 610 faces the right side surface of the second dielectric block 620, the left side surface of the second dielectric block 620 faces the right side surface of the third dielectric block 630, and the left side surface of the third dielectric block 630 faces the right side surface of the fourth dielectric block 640.
      <br/>
      When the aligned blocks are integrally bonded via a conductive adhesive material, the filter VI having a rectangular parallelepiped shape as shown in FIG. 38 is obtained.
      <br/>
      In the equivalent circuit diagram of the filter, the four resonators are connected via respective inductive coupling windows, having external coupling capacities Ce at both ends, as shown in FIG. 41. The stray capacity Cs of FIG. 41 is so small as to be negligible.

      <br/>
      At the same time, the first output coupling window 614 which is not coated with the conductive film and which is formed at the left side surface of the dielectric block 610 is opposed to the second input coupling window 623 at the exposed area of the right side surface of the second dielectric block 620, so that the inductive coupling is achieved between the resonators R6-1 and R6-2.

    <p num="131">
      The conductive film 622 at the left side surface of the second dielectric block 620 is integrally bonded to the conductive film 632 at the right side surface of the third dielectric block 630 through the conductive adhesive material 650 such as a solder or conductive adhesive agent containing silver powder.
      <br/>
      At the same time, the second output coupling window 624 formed at the left side surface of the second dielectric block 620 opposes the third input coupling window 633 at the right side surface of the third dielectric block 630, thereby realizing the inductive coupling of the resonators R6-2 and R6-3.

      Meanwhile, the conductive film 632 at the left side surface of the third dielectric block 630 is integrally bonded with the conductive film 642 at the right side surface of the fourth dielectric block 640 except for the exposed area by the conductive adhesive material 650.
      <br/>
      The third output coupling window 634 at the left side surface of the third dielectric block 630 faces the corresponding fourth input coupling window 643 at the right side surface of the fourth dielectric block 640, to achieve the inductive coupling of the resonators R6-3 and R6-4.
