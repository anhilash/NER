    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">
      The present invention relates generally to electric toothbrushes.
      <br/>
      More particularly, it relates to an improved battery powered toothbrush.
    </p>
    <p num="3">
      The benefits of brushing one's teeth using motorized toothbrushes are well known, and motorized movement in toothbrushes has been the subject of much recent innovation and design activity.
      <br/>
      Also, the commercial market has seen the introduction, over the last several years, of many different types of motorized toothbrushes.
      <br/>
      However, an examination of the available technology shows a tendency toward increasingly complex, expensive, and non-commercially feasible methods of achieving motorized motions in the bristles and heads of toothbrushes to aid in more effectively cleaning one's teeth.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      The commercial marketplace has become divided into two price markets.
      <br/>
      On the higher priced end are some of these more complex motorized toothbrushes that provide various motions to the bristles and brush head.
      <br/>
      The lower end of the market has become the province of very simple motorized toothbrushes that only vibrate through the use of an offset weight attached to the motor shaft, and which provide very little true additional cleaning benefit with their use, since no vigorous motion is transmitted to the cleaning surface of the brush.
      <br/>
      The vibrations are also very uncomfortable to the hand and act as a disincentive to brush one's teeth for an adequate time.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      Numerous electric toothbrushes have been developed over the years.
      <br/>
      Some known devices are shown in U.S. Pat. No. 5,070,567; U.S. Pat. No. 5,186,627; U.S. Pat. No. 5,274,870; U.S. Pat. No. 5,341,534; U.S. Pat. No. 5,378,153; and U.S. Pat. No. 5,732,433. The intention of the present invention is to provide a low cost, effective, ergonomically correct, motorized toothbrush wherein the brush includes both a moving circular brush portion and a fixed brush portion.
      <br/>
      Accordingly it has been considered desirable to develop a new and improved electric toothbrush which would overcome the foregoing difficulties and others while providing better and more advantageous overall results.
    </p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="6">The present invention relates to an electric toothbrush.</p>
    <p num="7">More specifically, the electric toothbrush is used in personal hygiene to clean one's teeth and gums using a motorized movement.</p>
    <p num="8">In a first preferred embodiment, the electric toothbrush includes an elongated body portion, a brush head attached to a first end of the elongated body portion, a handle attached to a second end of the elongated body portion, and an angled shaft between the brush head and the handle.</p>
    <p num="9">
      The brush head includes a longitudinal axis, a circular or moving portion and a static portion.
      <br/>
      The circular portion rotates, swivels, gyrates, oscillates or reciprocates about an axis normal to the longitudinal axis of the brush head and is incorporated into the larger brush head.
      <br/>
      The static portion includes static bristles located on opposite sides of the circular portion.
      <br/>
      The stiff bristles of the circular portion can be slightly recessed in height from the static bristles.
      <br/>
      This particular arrangement allows for the circular portion to include stiff bristles which will aid in the deep cleaning and plaque removal process, while the stationary bristles would typically consist of softer bristles, so as not to damage the gums.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      The brush head has a more traditional larger brush head shape which permits the user to brush his teeth in the typical manner of an up and down fashion, while a motorized moving portion of the brush head cleans more effectively.
      <br/>
      The design of the brush head allows for inexpensive manufacture and brings effective motorized toothbrushes within the financial reach of a larger portion of the population.
    </p>
    <p num="11">
      The angled shaft provides an ergonomic benefit that has not been utilized on a motorized toothbrush.
      <br/>
      The angle is well known for its ergonomic benefit in permitting easier access into the back recesses of the mouth while still contacting the tooth surface.
    </p>
    <p num="12">
      The elongated body portion includes a hollow portion.
      <br/>
      The toothbrush is further comprised of a motor within the hollow portion of the elongated body portion.
      <br/>
      The motor is operably connected to the moving portion of the brush head for rotating, oscillating or reciprocating the movable bristles on the head.
      <br/>
      The motor has a longitudinal axis which is coaxial with a longitudinal axis of the elongated body portion.
    </p>
    <p num="13">
      The hollow portion further includes a simplified gear assembly.
      <br/>
      The gearing may comprise any of several embodiments.
      <br/>
      In one embodiment, the gear assembly includes a worm gear, two step gears and a shaft.
      <br/>
      The motor is operatively connected to the worm gear.
      <br/>
      The step gears are operatively connected to the worm gear and to each other.
      <br/>
      The gear assembly delivers sufficient torque and speed, while preserving battery longevity.
      <br/>
      The first step gear permits a second matching step gear to be offset with respect to a longitudinal axis of the elongated body portion and placed at the desired angle so that the shaft itself can still be straight, thus losing no power or torque through the added friction of a flexible shaft.
      <br/>
      The shaft is operatively connected at a first end to the offset step gear and at a second end to the moving portion of the brush head.
    </p>
    <p num="14">
      The body further includes a switch to allow operation of the unit.
      <br/>
      The switch includes an actuator button and a metal contact.
      <br/>
      The switch is manually depressed by pressing a molded actuator button down, which presses against a metal contact, completing the circuit, as in a conventional momentary switch.
      <br/>
      The switch allows continuous operation, through a ramp design, by depressing and sliding the actuator button forward as in a conventional continuous switch.
      <br/>
      The forward motion, combined with the molded in ramp, causes the actuator button to move downward, pressing against the metal contact, and completing the circuit.
      <br/>
      By combining these two functions in one switch, the consumer can try the unit and see its operation prior to purchase, and still operate it continuously once out of the package.
    </p>
    <p num="15">
      The electric toothbrush can further include a battery located within the hollow portion of the elongated body portion.
      <br/>
      A slidable, snap-on cover is depressed then released from the end of the handle and opens to expose the hollow portion.
      <br/>
      The battery is then inserted and then the cover is slid into position and snapped into place.
    </p>
    <p num="16">In a second preferred embodiment, the electric toothbrush includes an elongated body portion, a brush head attached to a first end of the elongated body portion, a handle attached to a second end of the elongated body portion, and an angled shaft between the brush head and the handle.</p>
    <p num="17">
      The brush head includes a longitudinal axis, a circular or moving portion, a static portion, a first end and a second end.
      <br/>
      The first end of the head is located adjacent the first end of the elongated body portion, and the second end is located opposite the first end.
      <br/>
      The static portion is located at the first end or second end of the head.
      <br/>
      The circular portion is then located at the opposite end of the head.
      <br/>
      The moving portion can rotate, swivel, gyrate, oscillate or reciprocate about an axis approximately normal to the longitudinal axis of the brush head and is incorporated into the larger brush head.
      <br/>
      The circular portion is preferably located at the second end of the brush head to facilitate easier access and cleaning of the back of the user's mouth.
      <br/>
      The static bristles are located adjacent the circular portion.
      <br/>
      This particular arrangement allows for the circular portion to include stiff bristles which will aid in the deep cleaning and plaque removal process further in the back of the user's mouth, while the stationary bristles would typically consist of a softer bristle, so as not to damage the gums.
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      In a third preferred embodiment, the electric toothbrush includes an elongated body portion having opposed first and second ends, a hollow portion and a longitudinal axis, and a head attached to the first end of the elongated body portion.
      <br/>
      A handle is attached to the second end of the elongated body portion.
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      An angled shaft is located between the head and the handle.
      <br/>
      The toothbrush further includes a motor located within the hollow portion of the elongated body portion.
    </p>
    <p num="20">
      A plurality of gears are located in the hollow portion.
      <br/>
      The plurality of gears comprises a first gear and a second gear.
      <br/>
      The motor is connected to the first gear, and the first gear is connected to the second gear.
    </p>
    <p num="21">

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
    <p num="40">
      Referring now to the drawings wherein the showings are for the purposes of illustrating the preferred embodiments of the invention only and not for purposes of limiting same, FIG. 1 shows an electric toothbrush A according to a first preferred embodiment of the present invention.
      <br/>
      The electric toothbrush can be used for personal hygiene such as brushing one's teeth and gums.
    </p>
    <p num="41">
      As shown in FIG. 1, the electric toothbrush includes an elongated body portion 10, which has a first end 12 and a second end 14.
      <br/>
      A head 16 is attached to the first end 12 and a handle 18 is attached to the second end 14.
    </p>
    <p num="42">
      The head 16 has a more traditional larger brush head shape which permits the user to brush his teeth in the typical manner of an up and down fashion.
      <br/>
      As shown on FIG. 2, the length of the head 16, dimension "X", can range from about 0.75 inches to about 1.75 inches.
      <br/>
      The thickness of the brush head, dimension "Y", can range from about 0.25 inches to about 0.50 inches.
      <br/>
      The design of the head 16 allows for inexpensive manufacture and assists in bringing effective motorized rotational toothbrushes within the financial reach of a large portion of the population.
    </p>
    <p num="43">
      Referring now to FIG. 3, the head 16 further includes a longitudinal axis 19, a circular or moving portion or brush head 20 and a static portion or brush head 22.
      <br/>
      The static portion 22 is located on opposite sides of the circular portion 20.
      <br/>
      The circular portion 20 is located at the center of the brush head 16.
      <br/>
      The circular portion 20 rotates, swivels, oscillates or reciprocates about an axis approximately normal to the longitudinal axis 19 of the brush head 16.
      <br/>
      The circular portion 20 may rotate 360 (degree)  or partially rotate or oscillate or reciprocate in a back and forth manner.
    </p>
    <p num="44">
      The circular portion 20 includes stiff bristles 24.
      <br/>
      The static portion 22 includes soft bristles 26.
      <br/>
      The stiff bristles 24 are slightly recessed with respect to the soft bristles 26.
      <br/>
      The stiff bristles 24 aid in the deep cleaning and plaque removal process, while the stationary soft bristles 26 are softer so as to not damage the gums.
      <br/>
      The thickness of the bristles, dimension "Z", shown in FIG. 2, can range from about 0.25 inches to about 0.75 inches.
    </p>
    <p num="45">
      Referring again to FIG. 3, the elongated body portion 10 further includes an angled shaft 28, located between the head 16 and the handle 18.
      <br/>
      The angled shaft 28 provides an ergonomic benefit that has not been utilized on a motorized toothbrush.
      <br/>
      The angle is well known for its ergonomic benefit in permitting easier access-into the back recesses of the mouth while still contacting the tooth surface.
    </p>
    <p num="46">
      As shown in FIG. 4 and FIG. 5, the elongated body portion 10 further includes a hollow portion 30 which houses a motor 32.
      <br/>
      The motor 32 has a longitudinal axis 34 in line with a longitudinal axis 36 of the elongated body portion 10.
    </p>
    <p num="47">
      To provide power to the circular portion 20 to rotate or oscillate or reciprocate, the motor 32 powers a worm gear 40 and a pair of step gears 42, 43.
      <br/>
      The motor 32 is operatively connected to the worm gear 40.
      <br/>
      Step gear 42 is operatively connected to step gear 43 and the worm gear 40.

      <br/>
      The switch 50 also allows continuous operation through a ramp design, sliding the button 52 forward toward the head 16 to provide for continuous operation.
      <br/>
      Moving the button 52 forward, combined with a molded in ramp 58 in the metal contact 54, causes the button 52 to move downward, pressing against the metal contact 54 and completing the circuit.
      <br/>
      The toothbrush then continuously operates until the button 52 is slid back into an off position toward the handle 18 and the button 52 disengages the metal contact 54.
    </p>
    <p num="52">
      By combining these two functions in one switch 50, the toothbrush can be packaged in packaging as shown in FIG. 8 where the consumer can depress the button 52 through the packaging and see its operation while still inside the packaging, and then be able to operate it continuously once out of the package.
      <br/>
      FIG. 8 illustrates one version of the button 52.
      <br/>
      It should be noted that other sizes and shapes of buttons may be used.
