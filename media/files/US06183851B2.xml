    <heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="1">The present invention relates to an ink jet image recording medium which gives an excellent image quality and exhibits an excellent light-fastness.</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">
      With the spread of personal computers, printers such as ink jet printers have rapidly spread.
      <br/>
      Further, with the spread of photo scanners, photo CDs and digital cameras, the demand for printing system for printing digitized photographic image has been rapidly growing.
      <br/>
      In particular, the spread of simple inexpensive ink jet printers is remarkable.
      <br/>
      For these ink jet printers, the demand for better image quality has been growing year by year.
    </p>
    <p num="3">
      As a recording medium for use in ink jet recording system, there has heretofore been used an ordinary paper or a recording medium comprising an ink-receptive layer provided on a support which is called ink jet recording paper.
      <br/>
      However, an ink can easily run on such a recording medium.
      <br/>
      Further, such a recording medium exhibits a low gloss.
      <br/>
      Thus, such a recording medium cannot be put into practical use in the field of photographic image where a high resolution and gloss are required.
    </p>
    <p num="4">As an approach for solving these problems, a technique for ink jet recording medium using a paper coated with a resin on both sides thereof (i.e., so-called RC (resin-coated) paper) as a support and using gelatin as an ink-receptive layer is disclosed in JP-A-4-216990 and JP-A-6-64306 (The term "JP-A" as used herein means an "unexamined published Japanese patent application").</p>
    <p num="5">As an approach for bringing the appearance and touch of an image output from ink jet printers close to that of conventional photographic image, a recording medium comprising a synthetic hydrophilic resin in an ink-receptive layer and an ink jet recording method using the same are disclosed in JP-A-7-179032.</p>
    <p num="6">As an approach for improving the quality and stability of an image output from ink jet printers, a method involving the use of an image recording medium comprising an ink-receptive layer containing gelatin and a basic latex provided on a resin-coated support is disclosed in JP-A-8-244336.</p>
    <p num="7">
      It is certain that the foregoing proposals can give an image having a gloss closer to that of photographic image than with the conventional ink jet recording paper.
      <br/>
      However, the recording media proposed dry an ink at a low rate.
      <br/>
      Thus, an image formed on these recording media was not satisfactory in respect to resolution or graininess.
      <br/>
      For example, the image formed on these recording media shows stain or beading (granular density unevenness) that deteriorates image quality.
      <br/>
      In particular, a picture having a relatively small area printed on these recording media using a high speed printer shows a deteriorated image quality.
      <br/>
      Further, when these recording media are used for a printer of the type involving the jetting of a plurality of ink droplets having a low concentration for better image quality, the image thus formed is blurred.
      <br/>
      Moreover, the image thus formed can be transferred to other papers or objects which are superimposed thereon.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      For the purpose of solving these problems, many recording media which can dry an ink at a high rate have been disclosed.
      <br/>
      For example, JP-A-8-230309 and JP-A-6-183134 disclose a recording medium comprising a silica pigment.
      <br/>
      For example, JP-A-3-281383, JP-A-4-267180 and JP-A-5-24335 disclose a recording medium comprising an alumina pigment.
      <br/>
      These recording media comprise a porous recording layer which can fairly absorb an ink and hence dry at a raised rate.
      <br/>
      However, these recording media are disadvantageous in that since it is arranged to absorb an ink by an inorganic pigment such as silica pigment and alumina pigment, it exhibits a drastically deteriorated light-fastness.
      <br/>
      It has thus been keenly desired to provide a recording medium which can dry an ink at a high rate, gives an excellent image quality and exhibits an excellent light-fastness.
    </p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="9">It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide an image recording medium which can dry an ink at a higher rate than ever, gives an excellent image quality and exhibits an excellent light-fastness.</p>
    <p num="10">It is another object of the present invention to provide an image recording medium which can give a high image quality and exhibit a high light-fastness with a printer for printing digital image data, e.g., by ink jet printing process, particularly an ink jet printer which exhibits improved performances and hence a raised printing rate or an ink jet printer which jets a plurality of ink droplets having a low concentration to give an improved image quality.</p>
    <p num="11">These and other objects of the present invention will become more apparent from the following detailed description and examples.</p>
    <p num="12">The foregoing objects of the present invention are accomplished with the followings:</p>
    <p num="13">(1) An ink jet image recording medium comprising a coating layer provided on a support, wherein said coating layer comprises a dye-receptive polymer comprising a monomer unit represented by the following general formula (I) and one or more inorganic pigments incorporated therein:  (Chemical Structure image '2' not included in text)</p>
    <p num="14">wherein R1, R2, R3 and R4 each independently represent a hydrogen atom or an alkyl group which may be straight-chain or branched; L represents a divalent connecting group; and p represents an integer of 0 or 1.</p>

    <p num="22">In the present invention, the combined use of a dye-receptive polymer comprising a monomer unit represented by the general formula (I) and one or more inorganic pigments exerts a synergistic effect for enhancing the ink absorption rate and the dye receptivity to an extent that cannot be expected with the single use of these components, making it possible to provide an image recording medium which gives a very excellent image quality and exhibits an excellent light-fastness.</p>
    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="23">The present invention will be further described hereinafter.</p>

      <br/>
      If the molecular weight of the dye-receptive polymer employable herein is too small, the polymer can migrate too easily.

    </p>
    <p num="35">
      In the present invention, the incorporation of such an inorganic pigment in the coating layer provides a porous coating layer that can absorb an ink at an extremely higher rate.
      <br/>
      As a result, the image thus formed has an improved quality.
      <br/>
      Further, the problem of transfer of an ink to a paper or other objects superimposed on the image can be solved.
    </p>
    <p num="36">In the present invention, a coating layer containing a dye-receptive polymer comprising a monomer unit represented by the general formula (I) described in detail above and one or more inorganic pigments is provided.</p>
    <p num="37">
      The dye-receptive polymer comprising a monomer unit represented by the general formula (I) and the inorganic pigments may be incorporated in the same coating layer or separately incorporated in two or more coating layers.
      <br/>
      In particular, it is preferred that these components be separately incorporated in two or more coating layers so that coating layers having different functions are provided.
    </p>
    <p num="38">The case where these components are incorporated in the same coating layer (hereinafter referred to as "Type A") will be further described hereinafter.</p>
    <p num="39">
      The weight ratio of dye-receptive polymer comprising a monomer unit represented by the general formula (I) to one or more inorganic pigments to be incorporated in the coating layer (dye-receptive polymer/inorganic pigment) is from 95/5 to 5/95, preferably from 90/10 to 10/90.
      <br/>
      If the weight ratio of the dye-receptive polymer comprising a monomer unit represented by the general formula (I) exceeds the above defined range, the coating layer formed by the inorganic pigment exhibits an extremely reduced pore volume that retards the absorption of an ink.
      <br/>
      The highest volume of pores in the coating layer is preferably from 0.1 to 3 cc/g.
      <br/>
      On the contrary, if the weight ratio of the dye-receptive polymer comprising a monomer unit represented by the general formula (I) falls below the above defined range, the resulting coating layer exhibits a deteriorated dye receptivity that deteriorates the image quality and light-fastness.
      <br/>
      The inorganic pigment to be used herein is not specifically limited.
      <br/>
      The inorganic pigments as mentioned above are preferably used, singly or in admixture.
    </p>
    <p num="40">The coated amount of the dye-receptive polymer comprising a monomer unit represented by the general formula (I) and the one or more inorganic pigments can be easily determined by those skilled in the art depending on the amount of ink dye to be used, the kind and composition of the dye-receptive polymer comprising a monomer unit represented by the general formula (I), etc. It is preferably from 3 to 50 g/m2, most preferably from 5 to 40 g/m2.</p>
    <p num="41">
      In the present invention, the coating layer comprises a binder incorporated therein as necessary.
      <br/>
      As such a binder there is preferably used a hydrophilic binder.
      <br/>
      Examples of such a hydrophilic binder are disclosed in JP-A-62-253159, pp. 26-28. In some detail, a transparent or semitransparent hydrophilic binder is preferred.
      <br/>
      Examples of such a transparent or semitransparent hydrophilic binder include natural compounds such as protein (e.g., gelatin, gelatin derivative), and polysaccharides (e.g., cellulose derivative, starch, gum arabic, dextran, pullulan), and synthetic high molecular compounds such as polyvinyl alcohol, polyvinyl pyrrolidone and polyacrylamide.
      <br/>
      Other examples of binders employable herein include high absorbing polymers disclosed in JP-A-62-245260, i.e., homopolymer of vinyl monomer having --COOM or --SO3 M (in which M represents a hydrogen atom or an alkali metal), copolymer of these vinyl monomers, copolymer of these vinyl monomers with other vinyl monomers (e.g., sodium methacrylate, ammonium methacrylate).
      <br/>
      Two or more of these binders may be used in combination.
    </p>
    <p num="42">The weight ratio of binder/(dye-receptive polymer+inorganic pigment) is from 0.1/99.9 to 80/20. If the ratio of the binder exceeds the above defined range, the resulting coating layer exhibits a deteriorated dye receptivity and a reduced pore volume that disadvantageously deteriorates light-fastness and ink absorption rate.</p>
    <p num="43">
      In the present invention, a dye-receptive polymer comprising a monomer unit represented by the general formula (I), one or more inorganic pigments, and optionally a binder and additives described later are dissolved or dispersed in a solvent in an arbitrary proportion.
      <br/>
      The solution or dispersion thus obtained is applied to a substrate, and then dried to obtain an image recording medium according to the present invention.
      <br/>
      As the solvent there may be used either an aqueous solvent or an organic solvent.
      <br/>
      The coating method is not specifically limited.
      <br/>
      Preferred examples of the coating means employable herein include die coater, roll coater, blade coater, bar coater, comma coater, and gravure coater.
      <br/>
      The temperature at which the coated material is dried is not specifically limited but may be such that the support cannot be damaged.
      <br/>
      Under some drying conditions, the coating layer may crack on the surface thereof.
      <br/>
      Cracking may or may not occur.
      <br/>
      The size of cracks, if any, is not restricted.
    </p>
    <p num="44">
      The image recording medium of the present invention thus obtained comprises a dye-receptive polymer comprising a monomer unit represented by the general formula (I) and one or more inorganic pigments incorporated in the same coating layer.

      Further, the coating layer thus formed is a porous layer.
      <br/>
      Thus, the image recording medium of the present invention thus obtained can absorb an ink at a high rate, gives an excellent image quality and exhibits an excellent light-fastness.
    </p>
    <p num="45">In the present invention, the combined use of a dye-receptive polymer comprising a monomer unit represented by the general formula (I) and one or more inorganic pigments makes it possible to provide an image recording medium which gives a very excellent image quality and an excellent light-fastness to an extent that cannot be expected with the single use of these components.</p>
    <p num="46">The case where a dye-receptive polymer comprising a monomer unit represented by the general formula (I) and one or more inorganic pigments are separately incorporated in two or more coating layers will be described hereinafter.</p>
    <p num="47">In this case, there are two structures.</p>
    <p num="48">1) The upper layer contains a dye-receptive polymer comprising a monomer unit represented by the general formula (I), and the lower layer contains one or more inorganic pigments. (This structure will be hereinafter referred to as "Type B-1".)</p>
    <p num="49">2) The upper layer contains one or more inorganic pigments, and the lower layer contains a dye-receptive polymer comprising a monomer unit represented by the general formula (I). (This structure will be hereinafter referred to as "Type B-2".)</p>
    <p num="50">
      In the present invention, both the foregoing Type B-1 and Type B-2 are preferably used.
      <br/>
      The layer containing a dye-receptive polymer comprising a monomer unit represented by the general formula (I) will be hereinafter referred to as "dye-receptive layer", and the layer containing one or more inorganic pigments will be hereinafter referred to as "inorganic pigment layer".
    </p>
    <p num="51">
      Type B-1 will be further described hereinafter.
      <br/>
      Firstly, a dye-receptive layer containing a dye-receptive polymer comprising a monomer unit represented by the general formula (I) is provided.
      <br/>
      The coated amount of the dye-receptive polymer comprising a monomer unit represented by the general formula (I) is preferably from 2 to 50 g/m2, more preferably from 5 to 40 g/m2.
      <br/>
      If the coated amount of the dye-receptive polymer comprising a monomer unit represented by the general formula (I) falls below the above defined range, the resulting coating layer exhibits a deteriorated dye receptivity and light-fastness.
      <br/>
      The binder which is optionally used is same as used in the foregoing Type A. The weight ratio of binder/dye-receptive polymer is preferably from 0.1/99.9 to 80/20, more preferably from 10/90 to 70/30.
      <br/>
      If the weight ratio of the binder exceeds the above defined range, the resulting coating layer exhibits a deteriorated dye receptivity and light-fastness.
    </p>
    <p num="52">
      The percent water swelling of the entire dye-receptive layer is preferably from not less than 100% to not more than 300%, more preferably from not less than 150% to not more than 250%.
      <br/>
      The term "percent swelling" as used herein is meant to indicate a value obtained by dividing the thickness of the dye-receptive layer swollen with dropping water by the dry thickness of the dye-receptive layer, and then multiplying the quotient by 100.
      <br/>
      The control of the swelling behavior is very important for the controlling of diffusion or spreading of ink and the prevention of damage in the printer.
    </p>
    <p num="53">
      An inorganic pigment layer is then provided on the dye-receptive layer.
      <br/>
      The inorganic polymer to be used herein is not specifically limited.
      <br/>
      The inorganic pigments mentioned above are preferably used.
      <br/>
      These inorganic pigments may be used singly or in admixture.
      <br/>
      The coated amount of such an inorganic pigment is preferably from 0.1 to 20 g/m2, more preferably from 0.1 to 10 g/m2.
      <br/>
      In the case of Type B-1, the inorganic pigment layer acts to absorb an ink rapidly from the surface of the recording medium.
      <br/>
      If the coated amount of the inorganic pigment exceeds the above defined range, the ink spreads horizontally on the recording paper, causing stain that deteriorates image quality.
      <br/>
      On the contrary, if the coated amount of the inorganic pigment falls below the above defined range, the resulting inorganic pigment layer exhibits a deteriorated ink absorption that retards the ink absorption and hence causes beading resulting in the deterioration of image quality.
    </p>
    <p num="54">
      The binder which is optionally used is same as used in the foregoing Type A. The weight ratio of binder/inorganic pigment is preferably from 0.1 to 99.9 to 50/50, more preferably from 2/98 to 30/70.
      <br/>
      If the weight ratio of the binder exceeds the above defined range, the resulting inorganic pigment layer has a reduced pore volume that disadvantageously reduces the ink absorption rate.
      <br/>
      The volume of pores in the inorganic pigment layer is preferably from 0.1 to 3 cc/g.
    </p>
    <p num="55">
      The method for the application of the foregoing dye-receptive layer and the temperature at which these layers are coated are not specifically limited.
      <br/>
      The same method as used in the foregoing Type A can be used.
      <br/>
      The various coating layers are preferably applied either successively or simultaneously.
    </p>
    <p num="56">
      The recording medium of Type B-1 of the present invention thus obtained comprises a porous inorganic pigment layer as an upper layer.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, this type of a recording medium can absorb an ink at a very high rate as compared with the structure comprising a dye-receptive polymer comprising a monomer unit represented by the general formula (I) and one or more inorganic pigments incorporated in the same layer.
      <br/>
      Further, this type of a recording medium comprises a dye-receptive layer containing a dye-receptive polymer comprising a monomer unit represented by the general formula (I) as a lower layer.

      <br/>
      In the case of Type B-2, the inorganic pigment layer acts to absorb an ink solvent or wetting agent rapidly from the surface of the recording medium.
      <br/>
      If the coated amount of the inorganic pigment falls below the above defined range, the resulting inorganic pigment layer exhibits a deteriorated absorptivity that retards the drying of ink.
      <br/>
      On the contrary, if the coated amount of the inorganic pigment exceeds the above defined range, curling may occur to a practical disadvantage.
      <br/>
      The binder which is optionally used is same as used in the foregoing Type A. The weight ratio of binder/inorganic pigment is preferably from 0.1/99.9 to 50/50, more preferably 2/98 to 30/70.
      <br/>
      If the weight ratio of the binder exceeds the above defined range, the resulting inorganic pigment layer exhibits a reduced pore volume that extremely retards the absorption of an ink solvent or wetting agent to disadvantage.

      <br/>
      If the coated amount of the dye-receptive polymer comprising a monomer unit represented by the general formula (I) exceeds the above defined range, the resulting dye-receptive layer has a raised thickness that retards the absorption of an ink to disadvantage.
      <br/>
      On the contrary, if the coated amount of the dye-receptive polymer comprising a monomer unit represented by the general formula (I) falls below the above defined range, the resulting dye-receptive layer exhibits a deteriorated dye receptivity that deteriorates light-fastness and image quality.

      The binder which is optionally used is same as used in the foregoing Type A. The weight of binder/dye-receptive polymer is preferably from 0.1/99.9 to 80/20, more preferably from 10/90 to 50/50.

      <br/>
      This type of a recording medium further comprises a porous inorganic pigment layer as a lower layer.

      Accordingly, it can rapidly absorb an ink solvent or wetting agent, making it possible to dry an ink rapidly.

    <p num="61">As mentioned above, the present invention can provide an excellent image recording medium regardless of whether a dye-receptive polymer comprising a monomer unit represented by the general formula (I) and one ore more inorganic pigments are incorporated in the same coating layer or separately incorporated in different coating layers.</p>

      For example, a paper or synthetic high molecular compound (film) may be used.
      <br/>
      Specific examples of these support materials include polyethylene terephthalate film, polycarbonate film, polyvinyl chloride film, polystyrene film, polypropylene film, polyimide film, cellulose (e.g., triacetyl cellulose) film, materials comprising a pigment such as titanium oxide incorporated in these films, film process synthetic paper made of polypropylene, mixed paper made of synthetic resin pulp such as polyethylene pulp and natural pulp, Yankee paper, baryta paper, cast-coated paper, metal, cloth, and glass.
      <br/>
      These support materials may be used singly or in the form of support laminated with a synthetic high molecular compound such as polyethylene on one or both sides thereof.
      <br/>
      Further, support materials as disclosed in JP-A-62-253159 may be used.
    </p>
    <p num="87">Particularly preferred examples of the support material employable herein include a paper laminated with a polyolefin (e.g., polyethylene, polystyrene, polybutene), polyethylene terephthalate or the like on both sides thereof, and a plastic support (preferably comprising a white pigment such as titanium oxide and zinc oxide or tinting pigment such as cobalt blue, ultramarine and neodium oxide incorporated in a polyolefin).</p>
    <p num="88">
      The thickness of the polyolefin layer is not specifically limited but is preferably from 10 to 100  MU m, more preferably from 15 to 50  MU m, particularly from 20 to 35  MU m. The surface of the polyolefin layer may be mirror-finished or regularly or irregularly roughened or may be arbitrarily shaped.
      <br/>
      In particular, the polyolefin is preferably mirror-finished on the main surface thereof.
      <br/>
      The polyolefin layer is subjected to surface activation treatment such as corona discharge treatment and flame treatment, optionally followed by the application of an undercoating layer.
      <br/>
      A coating layer of the present invention is then applied to the surface of the polyolefin layer.
    </p>
    <p num="89">
      The white pigment which can be incorporated in the polyolefin on the surface side is not specifically limited.
      <br/>
      Titanium oxide and zinc oxide are preferred.
      <br/>
      In particular, anatase type titanium oxide is preferred.
      <br/>
      In order to improve its dispersibility, anatase type titanium oxide is preferably used in combination with zinc oxide in an amount of not more than 50%.
      <br/>
      The amount of the white pigment to be incorporated in the polyolefin is preferably not less than 5% by weight, more preferably from 10 to 50% by weight, particularly from 15 to 30% by weight.
    </p>
    <p num="90">
      The tinting pigment which can be incorporated in the polyolefin on the surface side is not specifically limited but is preferably one which can withstand a coating temperature of not lower than 300 (degree)  C., such as cobalt blue, ultramarine and neodium oxide.
      <br/>
      The amount of the tinting pigment to be used is from 0.1 to 3% by weight based on the weight of the white pigment.
      <br/>
      In order to attain the desired surface reflecting properties claimed herein, the kind and amount of the tinting pigment should be carefully selected.
      <br/>
      Even pigments called ultramarine have greatly different tints from manufacture to manufacture or from product number to product number.
      <br/>
      Therefore, it is preferred that various pigments be blended to attain the desired surface reflecting properties claimed herein.
    </p>
    <p num="91">If the support is a polyethylene-laminated paper containing a white pigment such as titanium oxide, the back layer is preferably designed to exert an antistatic effect and hence have a surface resistivity of not more than 1012  OMEGA  * cm.</p>

      The image recording medium of the present invention can be applied to all printing systems involving the release and reception of a dye, such as ink jet printing, sublimation type heat transfer printing and dye diffusion transfer printing.
      <br/>
      The effect of the present invention can be greatly exerted when the image recording medium of the present invention is applied to ink jet printing.
    </p>
    <p num="93">
      The ink jet printing process is not quite limited.
      <br/>
      The image recording medium may be used regardless of whether the ink jet printing process is effected on continuous or on-demand basis.
      <br/>
      The head system in the ink jet printing process is not limited.
      <br/>
      The image recording medium is preferably used in all printers, including piezo process printer, babble jet process printer, thermal jet process printer and ultrasonic printer.
    </p>
    <p num="94">
      In recent years, a remarkable development has been made in the field of ink jet system.
      <br/>
      For example, various new processes have been proposed and put into practical use, such as process involving the jetting of a plurality of droplets of an ink having a low concentration called photoink, each droplet having a small volume, process involving the improvement of image quality with a plurality of inks having the same hue but different concentrations and process involving the use of a colorless transparent ink.
      <br/>
      The recording medium of the present invention may be preferably used in any one of these processes.
      <br/>
      The effect of improving image quality can be remarkably exerted particularly when the image recording medium of the present invention is applied to a printer having a high printing rate or a printer of the process involving the jetting of a large amount of an ink having a low concentration.
