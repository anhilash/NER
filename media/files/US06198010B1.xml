      The present invention relates to a method for producing 1,1,1,3,3-pentafluoropropane.
      <br/>
      This method includes a first step of fluorinating 1-chloro-3,3,3-trifluoropropene in a liquid phase by hydrogen fluoride in the presence of an antimony compound as a catalyst, or a second step of fluorinating 1-chloro-3,3,3-trifluoropropene in a gas phase by hydrogen fluoride in the presence of a fluorination catalyst.
      <br/>
      If the first step is taken, 1,1,1,3,3-pentafluoropropane can be produced with a high yield.
      <br/>
      If the second step is taken, 1,1,1,3,3-pentafluoropropane can continuously be easily produced.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the second step is useful for an industrial scale production thereof.
      <br/>
      According to the invention, 1-chloro-3,3,3-trifluoropropene may be produced by a method including a step of reacting 1,1,1,3,3-pentachloropropane with hydrogen fluoride in a gas phase in the presence of a fluorination catalyst.
      <br/>
      This method is useful, because yield of 1-chloro-3,3,3-trifluoropropene is high.

    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">This invention relates to a method for producing 1,1,1,3,3-pentafluoropropane, which is useful as a foaming agent for foaming substances such as polyurethane, a refrigerant, and the like.</p>
    <p num="3">
      There are several conventional methods for producing 1,1,1,3,3-pentafluoropropane.
      <br/>
      For example, JP-A-Hei-6-256235 discloses a method for producing 1,1,1,3,3-pentafluoropropane from CF3 --CClX--CF2 Cl where X is hydrogen or chlorine, by catalytic hydrogenation.
      <br/>
      A preferable catalyst for this method is a common hydrogenation catalyst. U.S. Pat. No. 2,942,036 discloses a method of hydrogenating 1,2,2-trichloropentafluoropropane to produce 1,1,1,3,3-pentafluoropropane or 1,1,3,3,3-pentafluoro-1-propene or mixtures thereof.
      <br/>
      A catalyst for this method is palladium carried on activated carbon.
      <br/>
      These two methods mentioned hereinabove are superior in conversion and selectivity.
      <br/>
      However, these catalysts deteriorate considerably in these methods.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, it is necessary to prepare the raw material(s) of these methods in advance.
      <br/>
      Thus, these methods may not be suitable for the production of 1,1,1,3,3-pentafluoropropane in an industrial scale.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      There is disclosed, in published English translation (pp. 1312-1317) of Izvestiya Akademii Nauk SSSR, Otdelenie Khimicheskikh Nauk, No. 8, pp. 1412-1418, August, 1960 (CA 55, 349f), a method for producing 1,1,1,3,3-pentafluoropropane by hydrogenating 1,1,3,3,3-pentafluoro-1-propene in the presence of Pd--Al2 O3.
      <br/>
      However, it is difficult to find the raw material of this method (i.e., 1,1,3,3,3-pentafluoro-1propene) on the market.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      There is another method for producing 1,1,1,3,3-pentafluoropropane by fluorinating 1,1,1,3,3-pentachloropropane in a liquid phase in the presence of a catalyst (see WO96/01797).
      <br/>
      However, this method is relatively low in selectivity and yield.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      Unlike 1,1,1,3,3-pentalfluoropropane mentioned hereinabove, there is known another compound, 1-chloro-3,3,3-trifluoropropene, which is useful as an intermediate of medicines, of agricultural chemicals, of functional materials, and of fluorohydrocarbons.
      <br/>
      This compound is obtained, for example, by the following first to fifth processes.
      <br/>
      In the first process, 1,1,1-trifluoropropane is chlorinated to obtain 1,1,1-trifluoro-3,3-dichloropropane, and then this compound is dehydrochlorinated by an alcoholic basic compound to produce 1-chloro-3,3,3-trifluoropropene (see J. Am. Chem. Soc., 1942, 64, 1158).
      <br/>
      In the second process, hydrogen chloride is added to 3,3,3-trifluoropropyne to produce 1-chloro-3,3,3-trifluoropropene (see J. Chem. Soc., 1952, 3490).
      <br/>
      The second process is superior in conversion and selectivity.
      <br/>
      However, it is difficult to obtain the raw material of the second process (i-e., 3,3,3-trifluoropropyne) on the market.
      <br/>
      In the third process, 3-chloro-1,1,1-trifluoro-3-iodopropane is dehydroiodinated by alcoholic potassium hydroxide to produce 1-chloro-3,3,3-trifluoropropene (see J. Chem. Soc., 1953, 1199).
      <br/>
      In the fourth process, 3-bromo-3-chloro-1,1,1-trifluoropropane is dehydrobrominated by an alcoholic potassium hydroxide (see R. N. Haszeldine, J. Chem. Soc., 1951, 2495).
      <br/>
      The third and fourth processes are superior in conversion and selectivity.
      <br/>
      However, according to these processes, there is needed more than stoichiometric amount of potassium hydroxide, and it is necessary to prepare the raw materials in advance.
      <br/>
      Thus, there are problems to apply these processes to an industrial scale production.
      <br/>
      In the fifth process, 1,3,3,3-tetrachloropropene is fluorinated by hydrogen fluoride in the presence of an antimony catalyst (see U.S. Pat. No. 2,787,646).
      <br/>
      In the fifth process, there are a problem that it is difficult to obtain the raw material of the reaction on the market, and another problem that the yield of 1-chloro-3,3,3-trifluoropropene is poor for the industrial scale production.
    </p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="7">It is an object of the present invention to provide a method for producing 1,1,1,3,3-pentafluoropropane, which method is free of the above-mentioned drawbacks.</p>
    <p num="8">It is a specific object of the present invention to provide a method for producing 1,1,1,3,3-pentafluoropropane with a high yield, which method is suitable for an industrial scale production.</p>
    <p num="9">It is another object of the present invention to provide a method for easily continuously producing 1,1,1,3,3-pentafluoropropane, in which method there is used a raw material of 1-chloro-3,3,3-trifluoropropene that can easily be obtained on the market.</p>
    <p num="10">
      According to a first aspect of the present invention, there is provided a first method for producing 1,1,1,3,3-pentafluoropropane, comprising a step of fluorinating 1-chloro-3,3,3-trifluoropropene in a liquid phase by hydrogen fluoride in the presence of an antimony compound as a catalyst.
      <br/>
      According to the first method, 1,1,1,3,3-pentafluoropropane can be produced with an high yield, due to the use of an antimony compound as a catalyst for the fluorination.
    </p>
    <p num="11">
      According to a second aspect of the present invention, there is provided a second method for producing 1,1,1,3,3-pentafluoropropane, comprising a step of fluorinating 1-chloro-3,3,3-trifluoropropene in a gas phase by hydrogen fluoride in the presence of a fluorination catalyst.
      <br/>
      According to the second method, 1,1,1,3,3-pentafluoropropane can easily continuously be produced.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the second method is useful for an industrial scale production thereof.
      <br/>
      The raw material of the first and second methods, 1-chloro-3,3,3-trifluoropropene, can easily be obtained on the market.
    </p>
    <p num="12">
      According to the present invention, there is provided a third method for producing 1-chloro-3,3,3-trifluoropropene, which is a raw material of the first and second methods.
      <br/>
      The third method comprises a step of reacting 1,1,1,3,3-pentachloropropane with hydrogen fluoride in a gas phase in the presence of a fluorination catalyst.
      <br/>
      A raw material of the third method, 1,1,1,3,3-pentachloropropane, is easily obtained by one of the after-mentioned conventional methods.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, yield of 1-chloro-3,3,3-trifluoropropene is high, and therefore the third method is useful as an industrial-scale method for producing 1-chloro-3,3,3-trifluoropropene.
    </p>
    <p num="13">According to the present invention, the third method may be combined with either of the first and second methods, thereby to produce 1,1,1,3, 3-pentafluoropropane from 1,1,1,3,3-pentachloropropane.</p>
    <heading>DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
    <p num="14">In accordance with the first aspect of the present invention, there will be described in detail the above-mentioned first method for producing 1,1,1,3,3-pentafluoropropane, as follows.</p>
    <p num="15">
      In the first method, the step may be conducted by a continuous operation, a batch operation, or a half-batch operation in which only the reaction product is continuously removed from a reactor.
      <br/>
      Hereinafter, the description of the first method will be concerned mainly with a batch operation.
      <br/>
      If the first method is conducted by another operation, it is optional to modify the reaction condition(s) of a batch operation, which will be described hereinafter.
    </p>
    <p num="16">
      It is known to use an antimony catalyst for fluorinating halogenated hydrocarbons in a liquid phase by hydrogen fluoride.
      <br/>
      It is generally assumed that this antimony catalyst under its activated condition during the fluorination takes a form of a halogenated antimony compound represented by a formula of SbFaXb where X is a halogen, "a" and "b" are numbers each ranging from 0 to 5, and the total of "a" and "b" equals to 5.
      <br/>
      Thus, it is assumed that an antimony compound used as a catalyst in the first method also takes a form of such halogenated antimony compound, regardless of the form of the original antimony compound, when the antimony compound is under its activated condition during the fluorination.
      <br/>
      A halogenated antimony (III) compound, which is in a non-activated condition, is easily oxidized to another halogenated antimony (V) compound, which is in an activated condition, by chlorine, bromine or fluorine.
      <br/>
      Therefore, an antimony compound that is introduced as a catalyst into the reaction system of the first method is not limited to an antimony (V) compound.
      <br/>
      Examples of an antimony compound used in the first method are antimony pentachloride, antimony pentabromide, antimony pentaiodide, antimony pentafluoride, antimony trichloride, antimony tribromiide, antimony triiodide, and antimony trifluoride.
      <br/>
      Of these, antimony pentachloride and antimony trichloride are particularly preferable examples. -
    </p>
    <p num="17">
      In the first method, the catalyst is in an amount of preferably from 0.1 to 50 moles, more preferably from 10 to 30 moles, per 100 moles of 1-chloro-3,3,3-trifluoropropene.
      <br/>
      If it is less than 0.1 moles, both of conversion of 1-chloro-3,3,3-trifluoropropene and yield of 1,1,1,3,3-pentafluoropropane may become too low.
      <br/>
      If it is greater than 50 moles, tarry substances made up of high-boiling-point compounds may be produced too much.
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      In the first method, the reaction temperature is preferably from 10 to 150 (degree)  C., more preferably from 50 to 130 (degree)  C. If it is lower than 10 (degree)  C., both of conversion of 1-chloro-3,3,3-trifluoropropene and yield of 1,1,1,3,3-pentafluoropropane may become too low.
      <br/>
      If it is higher than 150 (degree)  C., tarry substances may be produced too much, and the catalyst may deteriorate considerably.
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      In the first method, the molar ratio of hydrogen fluoride to 1-chloro-3,3,3-trifluoropropene is preferably from 2:1 to 30:1, more preferably from 3:1 to 20:1.
      <br/>
      If it is less than 2:1, conversion of l-chloro-3,3,3-trifluoropropene may not become sufficiently high.
      <br/>
      If it is greater than 30:1, conversion of 1-chloro-3,3,3-trifluoropropene may not improve further, as compared with a case in which it is within this range of from 2:1 to 30:1.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, this may not economically be advantageous from the viewpoint of the recovery of the unreacted hydrogen fluoride.
    </p>
    <p num="20">
      In the first method, pressure needed to conduct the fluorination varies depending on the reaction temperature, and this pressure is not particularly limited as long as the reaction mixture in the reactor is maintained in the form of liquid.
      <br/>
      The pressure is preferably from 1.0 to 100 kg/cm2, more preferably from 5 to 30 kg/cm2.
    </p>
    <p num="21">
      In the first method, a solvent may be added to the reaction system in order to adjust the reaction rate and to suppress deterioration of the catalyst.
      <br/>
      Preferable examples of this solvent are 1,1,1,3,3-pentafluoropropane, which is the aimed product, and polychlorinated compounds (e.g., tetrachloroethane), which are hardly further chlorinated while the deteriorated catalyst is activated.
    </p>
    <p num="22">
      When the catalyst of the first method has deteriorated or has been an antimony compound that has an antimony's oxidation number other than +5, this catalyst can easily be activated to an activated condition here its antimony has an oxidation number of +5.
      <br/>
      This activation is conducted by introducing chlorine into the reaction system at a temperature of from 10 to 100 (degree)  C., in the presence of a solvent such as 1-chloro-3,3,3-trifluoropropene, 1,1,1,3,3-pentafluoropropane or the above-mentioned polychlorinated compound.
      <br/>
      Upon or after the introduction, stirring is conducted, if necessary.
      <br/>
      For the activation, chlorine is used in an amount of from 1 to 100 moles per mol of the catalyst.
      <br/>
      If the temperature is lower than 10 (degree)  C., it takes too long time to achieve the activation.
      <br/>
      If it is higher than 100 (degree)  C., the coexisting 1-chloro-3,3,3-trifluoropropene, 1,1,1,3,3-pentafluoropropane and/or polychlorinated compound may be chlorinated.

      In the first method, the obtained 1,1,1,3,3-pentafluoropropane may be purified by a conventional method for purifying reaction products obtained by the fluorination.

      <br/>
      Of  GAMMA -alumina, there is preferably used in the third method an activated alumina that is generally used for supporting catalyst, that is relatively large in specific surface area, and that is superior in heat resistance.

      Preferable examples of the same are stainless steels that are in the forms of wool, net, wire and thin tube, and a distillation tower's filler that is prepared from one of these stainless steels into an arbitrary shape.

    <p num="34">
      In the third method, the manner of preparing the second and third fluorination catalysts is not particularly limited.
      <br/>
      The second fluorination catalyst may be prepared by sequential steps of (a) preparing aluminum oxide from the precursor in the form of sphere or rod; and (b) treating the aluminum oxide with a fluorine-containing compound by spraying of a hydrofluoric acid solution, by immersion into this solution, or by bringing the aluminum oxide into contact with a gas that is hydrogen fluoride, fluorohydrocarbon or chlorofluorohydrocarbon under an elevated temperature.
      <br/>
      The third fluorination catalyst is prepared by immersing stainless steel into a hydrofluoric acid solution, followed by drying, or by filling a reaction tube with stainless steel and then allowing hydrogen fluoride to flow through the reaction tube.

    <p num="35">
      In each of the second and third methods, compositional change of the fluorination catalyst during the fluorination can effectively be prevented by treating, prior to the fluorination, the fluorination catalyst with a fluorination agent such as hydrogen fluoride, fluxorohydrocarbon or fluorochlorohydrocarbon, at a temperature not lower than the reaction temperature of the fluorination.
      <br/>
      The fluorination catalyst can effectively be prolonged in lifetime, and furthermore conversion and yield of the fluorination can effectively be improved, by supplying the reactor with oxygen, chlorine, fluorohydrocarbon or fluorochlorohydrocarbon, during the fluorination.

      This ratio of the second method is preferably from 1/80 to 1/2, more preferably from 1/40 to 1/3.
      <br/>

      <br/>
      This ratio of the third method is preferably from 1/30 to 1/3, more preferably from 1/10 to 1/3.

      If the amount of hydrogen fluoride is too large in each of the second and third methods, the amount of the reaction product contained in the unit volume of the gas released from the reactor may become small.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, it may become difficult to separate the reaction product from a mixture of the reaction products and the unreacted hydrogen fluoride released from the reactor.

      If the amount of hydrogen fluoride is too small in each of the second and third methods, conversion may become low, thereby lowering yield of the reaction product.
      <br/>
      However, even if the amount of hydrogen fluoride is too much or too little in each of the second and third methods, that is not critical to the fluorination of large scale, because low-fluorinated compounds, unreacted substances, and/or hydrogen fluoride, which usually accompanies the reaction product, is separated from the reaction product and is reused.
