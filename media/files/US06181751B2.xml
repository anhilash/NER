      A multi-stage detection system in a digital modulator includes a first-stage detector, a second-stage detector, and a third-stage detector.
      <br/>
      The first-stage detector detects an input signal.
      <br/>
      The second-stage detector receives the outputs from the first-stage detector.
      <br/>
      The third-stage detector receives the outputs from the second-stage detector.
      <br/>
      The first-stage detector includes first to third delays, first to third adders, and first to third detectors.
      <br/>
      The first delay delays the input signal by one sampling period.
      <br/>
      The first adder adds the input signal to the output from the first delay.
      <br/>
      The first detector detects the output from the first adder.
      <br/>
      The second delay delays the output from the first delay by one sampling period.
      <br/>
      The second adder adds the input signal to the output from the second delay.
      <br/>
      The second detector detects an output from the second adder.
      <br/>
      The third delay delays the output from the second delay by one sampling period.
      <br/>
      The third adder adds the input signal to the output from the third delay.
      <br/>
      The third detector detects the output from the third adder.

    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="1">The present invention relates to a multi-stage detection system in a digital demodulator for demodulating a received signal by differential detection.</p>
    <p num="2">
      Digital demodulators are widely used in the telecommunication field.
      <br/>
      A digital modulator which demodulates a received signal by differential detection can be efficiently used in a mobile communication system.
      <br/>
      The signal to be received by the digital demodulator is transmitted as a transmitted signal from a transmitter.
      <br/>
      For example, this transmitted signal is produced by differential phase shift keying in the transmitter.
      <br/>
      That is, the transmitted signal has phase information.
    </p>
    <p num="3">
      The coherent detection methods obtain the phase information by reproducing the carrier frequency and phase correctly (see, for example, Y. Matsumoto, S. Kubota and S. Kato, "A New Burst Coherent Demodulator for Microcellular TDMA/TDD Systems", IEICE Trans.
      <br/>
      Commun. Vol. E77-B, No. 7, pp. 927-933, July, 1994).
      <br/>
      If the carrier frequency and phase can be reproduced correctly, the demodulation characteristics are superior to that of the other kind of demodulators.
      <br/>
      However, it is complicated to realize the carrier synchronization and since the modulated signal is always transmitted under a fading environment in mobile communication, it is also quite difficult to reproduce the carrier frequency and phase exactly.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      The conventional differential detection methods calculate the phase difference between the two adjacent symbols of the received signal (see, for example, C. Liu and K. Feher, "Proposed  PI /4-QPSK with Increased Capacity in Digital Cellular Systems", ICC'92, pp. 316-318, 1992, and H. Tomita, Y. Yokoyama, T. Matsuki, "DIGITAL INTERMEDIATE FREQUENCY DEMODULATION TECHNIQUE FOR CELLULAR COMMUNICATION SYSTEMS", IEEE GLOBECOM'90, San Diego, Calif., pp. 1827-1831, December 1990), and a decision rule is used to obtain the transmitted information.

    <heading>DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading>
    <p num="10">The principle of the present invention will be described first with reference to the reference numerals in the accompanying drawings.</p>
    <p num="11">
      According to the present invention, a digital demodulator includes a first-stage detection means (first-stage detector 10), a second-stage detection means (second-stage detector 20), and a third-stage detection means (third-stage detector 30).
      <br/>
      The first-stage detection means (first-stage detector 10) has a first delay means (detectors A 120, B 140, and C 160) which receives an input signal indicating the phase information of a received signal and generates first to third delay signals by delaying the input signal.
      <br/>
      The delay time of each delay signal is equal to one sampling period.
      <br/>
      Letting  PHI k be the input signal, the respective delay signals are expressed as  PHI k-1,  PHI k-2, and  PHI k-3.
      <br/>
      The phase differences between  PHI k,  PHI k-1,  PHI k-2, and  PHI k-3 are calculated by a first addition means (adders 114 to 116) in the following manner.
      <br/>
      DELTA  PHI k,k-1 = PHI k - PHI k-1
      <br/>
      DELTA  PHI k,k-2 = PHI k - PHI k-2
      <br/>
      DELTA  PHI k,k-3 = PHI k - PHI k-3
    </p>
    <p num="12">
      A first detection means (detectors A 120, B 140, and C 160) is used to supply the estimates of the above values.
      <br/>
      The first detection means (detectors A 120, B 140, and C 160) includes a second addition means (adders 121 to 124, 141 to 144, and 161 to 164), an absolute value calculation means (absolute circuits 125 to 128, 145 to 149, and 165 to 168) for obtaining phase errors, and a first comparison means (comparators 129, 150, and 169).
    </p>
    <p num="13">The first comparison means (comparators 129, 150, and 169) is used to detect the minimum values of</p>

    </p>
    <p num="15">
      according to equations (9) to (21) given below.
      <br/>
      The estimates of  DELTA  PHI k, k-1,  DELTA  PHI k, k-2, and  DELTA  PHI k, k-3 are obtained according to equations (22) to (24) given below.  (Equation image '1' not included in text)
    </p>
    <p num="16">Note that  DELTA  PHI ' is one unknown of + +-  PI /4,  +- 3 PI /4},  DELTA  PHI " is one unknown of +0,  +-  PI /2,  +-  PI }, and  DELTA  PHI '" is one unknown of + +-  PI /4,  +- 3 PI /4}. If, for example,  EPSILON k, k-1(3),  EPSILON k, k-2(1), and  EPSILON k, k-3(2) are the maximum values, equations (25) to (27) given below are obtained:  (Equation image '2' not included in text)</p>
    <p num="17">
      The second-stage detection means (second-stage detector 20) includes a third-stage addition means (adders 21 to 23), and obtains the estimates of  DELTA  PHI k, k-1 by using the above estimates and the previous detection result according to equations (28) to (31) given below:
      <br/>
      DELTA  PHI k(1) = DELTA  PHI k,k-1  (28)
      <br/>
      DELTA  PHI k(2) = DELTA  PHI k,k-2 - DELTA  PHI k,k-1 (29)

      DELTA  PHI k(3) = DELTA  PHI k,k-3 - DELTA  PHI k-1,k-3  (30)
      <br/>
      DELTA  PHI k(4) = DELTA  PHI k,k-3 - DELTA  PHI k-1 - DELTA  PHI k-2  (31)
    </p>
    <p num="18">The decision rule is described as follows.</p>
    <p num="19">The estimates of  DELTA  PHI k(i) (i=1, 2, 3, 4) are the same,  PHI k which has the same value as these estimates is output as the detection result of the multi-stage detector; otherwise where two estimates are the same, and the remaining two estimates are the same, two different estimates  DELTA  PHI 'k and  DELTA  PHI "k are supplied to the third-stage detection means (third-stage detector 30).</p>
    <p num="20">This decision rule is realized by a second comparison means (decision rule circuit 25) of the second-stage detection means (second-stage detector 20).</p>
    <p num="21">The third-stage detection means (third-stage detector 30) includes a fourth addition means (adders 303 to 325) and a second absolute value calculation means (absolute circuits 326 to 337) for performing calculations based on equations (1) to (8).  (Equation image '3' not included in text)</p>
    <p num="22">
      Note that  DELTA  PHI k-1, k-2 = PHI k-1 - PHI k-2.

      The third-stage detection means (third-stage detector 30) further includes a third comparison means for detecting the minimum value from the above errors calculated based on equations (1) to (8),  EPSILON 'k, k-2(i) (i=1, . . . , 8), and outputting corresponding  DELTA  PHI 'k or  DELTA  PHI "k as the output from the multi-stage detector.
