    <heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">The invention relates to the use of cyclic ureas to reduce the surface tension in water-based systems.</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="3">
      The ability to reduce the surface tension of water is of great importance in waterborne coatings, inks, adhesives, and agricultural formulations because decreased surface tension translates to enhanced substrate wetting in actual formulations.
      <br/>
      Surface tension reduction in water-based systems is generally achieved through the addition of surfactants.
      <br/>
      Performance attributes resulting from the addition of surfactants include enhanced surface coverage, fewer defects, and more uniform distribution.
      <br/>
      Equilibrium surface tension performance is important when the system is at rest.
      <br/>
      However, the ability to reduce surface tension under dynamic conditions is of great importance in applications where high surface creation rates are utilized.
      <br/>
      Such applications include spraying, rolling and brushing of coatings or spraying of agricultural formulations, or high speed gravure or ink-jet printing.
      <br/>
      Dynamic surface tension is a fundamental quantity which provides a measure of the ability of a surfactant to reduce surface tension and provide wetting under such high speed application conditions.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      Traditional nonionic surfactants such as alkylphenol or alcohol ethoxylates, and ethylene oxide (EO)/propylene oxide (PO) copolymers have excellent equilibrium surface tension performance but are generally characterized as having poor dynamic surface tension reduction.
      <br/>
      In contrast, certain anionic surfactants such as sodium dialkyl sulfosuccinates can provide good dynamic results, but these are very foamy and impart water sensitivity to the finished coating.
    </p>
    <p num="5">There is a need for a family of surfactants which provide good equilibrium and dynamic surface tension properties, are low-foaming and would be widely accepted in the coating, ink, adhesive, and agricultural formulation industries.</p>
    <p num="6">The importance of reducing equilibrium and dynamic surface tension in applications such as coatings, inks, and agricultural formulations is well-appreciated in the art.</p>
    <p num="7">
      Low dynamic surface tension is of great importance in the application of waterborne coatings.
      <br/>
      In an article, Schwartz, J. "The Importance of Low Dynamic Surface Tension in Waterborlie Coatings", Journal of Coatings Technology, September 1992, there is a discussion of surface tension properties in waterborne coatings and a discussion of dynamic surface tension in such coatings.
      <br/>
      Equilibrium and dynamic surface tension were evaluated for several surface active agents.
      <br/>
      It is pointed out that low dynamic surface tension is an important factor in achieving superior film formation in waterborne coatings.
      <br/>
      Dynamic coating application methods require surfactants with low dynamic surface tensions in order to prevent defects such as retraction, craters, and foam.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      Efficient application of agricultural products is also highly dependent on the dynamic surface tension properties of the formulation.
      <br/>
      In an article, Wirth, W.; Storp, S.; Jacobsen, W. "Mechanisms Controlling Leaf Retention of Agricultural Spray Solutions"; Pestic.
      <br/>
      Sci. 1991, 33, 411-420, the relationship between the dynamic surface tension of agricultural formulations and the ability of these formulations to be retained on a leaf was studied.
      <br/>
      These workers observed a good correlation between retention values and dynamic surface tension, with more effective retention of formulations exhibiting low dynamic surface tension.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      Low dynamic surface tension is also important in high-speed printing as discussed in the article "Using Surfactants to Formulate VOC Compliant Waterbased Inks", Medina, S. W.; Sutovich, M. N. Am. Ink Maker 1994, 72 (2), 32-38. In this article, it is stated that equilibrium surface tensions (ESTs) are pertinent only to ink systems at rest.
      <br/>
      EST values, however, are not good indicators of performance in the dynamic, high speed printing environment under which the ink is used.
      <br/>
      Dynamic surface tension is a more appropriate property.
      <br/>
      This dynamic measurement is an indicator of the ability of the surfactant to migrate to a newly created ink/substrate interface to provide wetting during high speed printing.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      U.S. Pat. No. 5,098,478 discloses water-based ink compositions comprising water, a pigment, a nonionic surfactant and a solubilizing agent for the nonionic surfactant.
      <br/>
      Dynamic surface tension in ink compositions for publication gravure printing must be reduced to a level of about 25 to 40 dynes/cm to assure that printability problems will not be encountered.
    </p>
    <p num="11">U.S. Pat. No. 5,562,762 discloses an aqueous jet ink of water, dissolved dyes and a tertiary amine having two polyethoxylate substituents and that low dynamic surface tension is important in ink jet printing.</p>

      Substituted cyclic ureas have been reported to have utility in many applications.
      <br/>
      Nomura et al, Ind.
      <br/>
      Eng. Chein. Res. 1987, 26, 1056-1059, state these materials are useful as intermediates for medicines and resins and directly as chemotherapeutic agents, delignification reagents, and in cosmetics.
    </p>
    <p num="13">Likewise, U.S. Pat. No. 3,876,657 discloses 1-alkyl-2-imidazolidones (ethylene ureas) as having recognized utility as bactericides, central nervous system depressants, plant growth promoters, female fly sterilants, adhesives, textile treating agents, and as monomers for deriving polymers and copolymers.</p>
    <p num="14">
      In addition, Naumov et al, Khimiya Geteotsikl.
      <br/>
      Soedin. 1973, 1, 90-93, state these materials are useful as biologically active compounds, specifically as insecticides and insect repellents.
      <br/>
      Despite this extensive listing of utility, alkylated cyclic ureas have not been reported to have utility as surface tension reducing agents in water.
      <br/>
      In fact, Kanetani et al, Chem.
      <br/>
      Abs. 98:145450, converted long chain N-alkylimidazolidones (C8, C10, C12, C14, C16) to the propane sultone derivatives in order to make useful surfactants.

    <p num="16">
      U.S. Pat. No. 4,677,131 discloses substituted cyclic ureas have efficacy for enhancing drug absorption through the skin for therapeutic or diagnostic purposes.

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="25">This invention relates to the use of compounds of the formula  (Chemical Structure image '3' not included in text)</p>
    <p num="26">
      where R is a C6 to C12 alkyl group or R"O--(CH2)m --, R' is hydrogen or methyl, R" is a C4 to C12 alkyl group, m is 2-4 and n is 1 or 2, for the reduction of equilibrium and dynamic surface tension in water-based compositions containing an organic compound, particularly coating, ink, and agricultural compositions containing organic compounds such as polymeric resins, herbicides (excluding azole derivative fungicides), insecticides or plant growth modifying agents.
      <br/>
      It is desirable that an aqueous solution of the cyclic urea demonstrates a dynamic surface tension of less than 45 dynes/cm at a concentration of  &lt;= 5 wt % in water at 23 (degree)  C. and 1 bubble/second according to the maximum-bubble-pressure method.
      <br/>
      The maximum-bubble-pressure method of measuring surface tension is described in Langmuir 1986, 2, 428-432, which is incorporated by reference.
    </p>
    <p num="27">In one aspect of the invention the N-higher alkyl and alkoxyalkyl cyclic ureas of the formula  (Chemical Structure image '4' not included in text)</p>
    <p num="28">display excellent ability to reduce equilibrium and dynamic surface tension while producing substantially no foam.</p>
    <p num="29">Another aspect of this invention which is particularly advantageous is that the compounds of the formula  (Chemical Structure image '5' not included in text)</p>
    <p num="30">
      produce relatively high quantities of foam, and may therefore find application in many areas in which the formation of foam is important.
      <br/>
      Such applications may include ore flotation and mining applications, carpet shampoos, shaving cream, and the like.
      <br/>
      It was not anticipated that such a high degree of control of the foaming characteristic of these compounds could be achieved through the seemingly innocuous interchange of hydrogen and methyl.
    </p>
    <p num="31">These materials may be prepared by reacting a suitable diamine with urea:  (Chemical Structure image '6' not included in text)</p>
    <p num="32">This is the preferred route for commercial production.</p>
    <p num="33">Alternatively, the compounds of the invention may be prepared by reaction of a suitable cyclic urea with an alkyl halide in the presence of a base and an optional solvent:  (Chemical Structure image '7' not included in text)</p>
    <p num="34">
      where
      <br/>
      R is a higher alkyl group or R" and R' is methyl

    <p num="35">
      or
      <br/>
      R is methyl and R' is a higher alkyl group or R"
    </p>
    <p num="36">
      or
      <br/>
      R is hydrogen and R' is a higher alkyl group or R".
    </p>
    <p num="37">
      In these descriptions, the "higher alkyl group" may be a linear, branched, or cyclic C6 to C12 hydrocarbon moiety.
      <br/>
      In general, lower numbers of alkyl carbon or a higher degree of branching will increase the solubility of the surfactant but decrease the efficiency (i.e. a greater amount will be required to obtain a given reduction in surface tension).
      <br/>
      Examples of suitable higher alkyl groups include 1-hexyl, 2-hexyl, 3-hexyl, cyclohexyl, 1-octyl, 2-ethylhexyl, 2-octyl, 3-octyl, isooctyl, cyclooctyl, t7-nonyl, 2-nonyl, 3-nonyl, 4-nonyl, isononyl, n-decyl, isodecyl, 2-decyl, 3-decyl, n-dodecyl, cyclododecyl, and the like.
      <br/>
      Of course, this list is not comprehensive, and the particular alkyl group chosen for a particular use will depend on the performance characteristics required for that application.
      <br/>
      Derivatives in which the alkyl group is a mixture of isomers are also suitable for the practice of this invention.
      <br/>
      C7 to C10 hydrocarbon derivatives are preferred and C8 hydrocarbon derivatives are especially preferred.
    </p>
    <p num="38">Compounds in which the higher alkyl group contains ether linkages, i.e., R"O--(CH2)m --, are also suitable for use in this invention, as illustrated by the structure  (Chemical Structure image '8' not included in text)</p>
    <p num="39">
      where R" is a C4 to C12 alkyl group, m is 2-4, n is 1 or 2, and R' is hydrogen or methyl.
      <br/>
      Examples of suitable C4 to C12 alkyl groups include 1-butyl, 2-butyl, t-butyl, 1-pentyl, 2-pentyl, 3-pentyl, neopentyl, 1-hexyl, 2-hexyl, 3-hexyl, cyclohexyl, 1-octyl, 2-ethylhexyl, 2-octyl, 3-octyl, isooctyl, cyclooctyl, n-nonyl, 2-nonyl, 3-nonyl, 4-nonyl, isononyl, n-decyl, isodecyl, 2-decyl, 3-decyl, n-dodecyl, cyclododecyl, and the like.
      <br/>
      Derivatives in which R" is C6 to C10 alkyl and m is 3 are preferred, although the particular choice will depend on the properties required for a specific application.
    </p>
    <p num="40">The cyclic ureas are suitable for use in an aqueous composition comprising in water an inorganic compound which is a mineral ore or a pigment or an organic compound which is a pigment, a polymerizable monomer, such as addition, condensation and vinyl monomers, an oligomeric resin, a polymeric resin, a detergent, a caustic cleaning agent, a herbicide, especially a herbicide for chlorophyll-containing plants, an insecticide, or a plant growth modifying agent.</p>
    <p num="41">
      An amount of the cyclic urea compound that is effective to reduce the equilibrium and/or dynamic surface tension of the water-based, organic compound-containing composition is added.
      <br/>
      Such effective amount may range from 0.001 to 20 g/100 mL, preferably 0.01 to 10 g/100 mL, of the aqueous composition.
      <br/>
      Naturally, the most effective amount will depend on the particular application and the solubility of the particular cyclic urea.

      The starting diamine, N-n-octyl ethylene diamine was prepared from n-octyl chloride and ethylene diamine (Linsker and Evans, J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1945, 67, 1581-1582).
      <br/>
      This diamine (9.95 g, 0.058 mol) was reacted with urea (3.5 g, 0.058 mol) in a 50 mL 3-neck round bottom flask.
      <br/>
      The flask was equipped with a nitrogen inlet to flush the ammonia produced in the reaction out of the system and into a trap (dilute sulfuric acid).
      <br/>
      Ammonia evolution commenced at about 140 (degree)  C. and heating was continued to 210 (degree)  C. The temperature was held at this level for two hours to assure ring closure to the cyclic product.
      <br/>
      A small amount of material was sublimed from the reaction residue to give a white crystalline solid (mp 42.0-42.4 (degree)  C.) which was used for all further measurements.

      <br/>

      <br/>
      The reaction proceeded very slowly and the ethanol byproduct was distilled as it formed.

      A three-necked 100 mL flask was fitted with an addition funnel, reflux condenser topped with an N2 gas inlet, and a thermal well.

      <br/>
      Tetrabutyl ammonium hydrogen sulfate (0.34 g, phase transfer agent) and 1-methyl-2-imidazolidone (5.0 g, 0.050 mol) were then added.
      <br/>
      Upon gentle heating and stirring, a foamy mass formed that was difficult to stir.
      <br/>
      The mixture was agitated as well as possible and temperature was raised to 46 (degree)  C. Octyl bromide (10.0 g, 0.052 mol) was then added through the addition funnel.
      <br/>
      After a few minutes, a sample was withdrawn and analyzed by GC.
      <br/>
      Several minutes after taking the GC sample, the mixture loosened up and the temperature rose quickly to 65 (degree)  C. through self-heating.
      <br/>
      After holding a few minutes, the temperature then started to drop.
      <br/>
      A fine white solid was now present and the mixture was easily stirred.

      The temperature was raised to reflux temperature.

      After about 30 minutes of efficient stirring, GC analysis showed the reaction was almost complete.
      <br/>
      Heating was discontinued after an additional 20 minutes.
      <br/>
      The mixture was filtered and stripped on a rotary evaporator.
      <br/>
      The residue was distilled to give 3.5 g of a fraction boiling at 140-141 (degree)  C. at 3 torr (43% yield) which was used in all further tests.

      These data illustrate cyclic ureas containing branched alkyl groups are also useful in the practice of this invention.
      <br/>
      The effect of branching is to increase the solubility of the material and decrease its efficiency.
      <br/>
      This is illustrated by comparing the data obtained for the 0.1 wt % solution with that of N-n-octyltetrahydropyrimidone in the previous example.
      <br/>
      At 0.1 wt %, 2-ethylhexyltetrahydropyrimidone provided a surface tension of 35.9 dyne/cm at 0.1 b/s compared to 30.8 dyne/cm for the compound of the previous example, indicating that more of the branched compound was required to obtain an equivalent reduction in surface tension.
      <br/>
      On the other hand, the branched compound has a higher solubility, and outstanding dynamic properties were observed at higher concentrations.
      <br/>
      In fact, at a use level of 0.25%, the surface tension can be maintained below 33 dyne/cm, even at the extremely high surface creation rate corresponding to 20 b/s.

      The ability of a surfactant in aqueous systems to reduce surface tension under both equilibrium and dynamic conditions is of great importance in the performance of waterbased coatings, inks, adhesives, and agricultural formulations.
      <br/>
      Low equilibrium surface tension allows the development of excellent properties subsequent to application.
      <br/>
      Low dynamic surface tension results in enhanced wetting and spreading under the dynamic conditions of application, resulting in more efficient use of the formulations and fewer defects.
      <br/>
      In waterborne coatings, inks, adhesives, and agricultural formulations, the formation of foam is generally undesirable because it complicates handling and can cause defects or result in inefficient application.
      <br/>
      On the other hand, the formation of foam can be important in many other applications, and it is therefore desirable to be able to control the foaming characteristics of a surfactant so that its performance can be tailored for a specific application.
