      The present invention relates generally to a provisioning and management tool for managing a mobile satellite communication system, and more particularly, to a management tool for provisioning components in the satellite communication system including a mobile earth terminal satellite communication device.
      <br/>
      The mobile earth terminal provides voice, data, and facsimile transmission between mobile earth terminals and feederlink earth stations (FESs) that act as gateways to public networks or base stations associated with private networks.
    </p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND ART</heading>
    <p num="3">
      Wireless technology is not new.
      <br/>
      The age of electronic communication began with the invention of a practical telegraph in 1844, over 150 years ago.
      <br/>
      It has been said that the telegraph was a major factor in the explosive development of the Western United States in the mid-1800's.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      In 1983, the FCC issued licenses to provide mobile communications in a new frequency hand using a technique called cellular transmission which had been developed by both AT&amp;T and Motorola.
      <br/>
      The proponents invested over $400 million in the new business before the FCC licensed cellular service.
      <br/>
      Many people thought that consumers needed mobile communications as much as they needed a second Jaguar automobile.
      <br/>
      Much to the surprise of everyone the growth rate was phenomenal.
      <br/>
      An enormous mass market developed for this service.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      There are over 500 million users of wireline communications in the world today.
      <br/>
      By the early part of the next century, wireline will continue to grow, and wireless will be a major factor in telecommunications.
      <br/>
      According to the U.S. Commerce Department, there are at least 52 million cellular subscribers in the world (23 million in the U.S.).
      <br/>
      Within five years, experts estimate that there may be 150 million (50 million U.S.) and by 2005 we expect the worldwide total will be 260 million (65 million U.S.).
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      Cellular service is available in most urban regions, excluding, large, less developed areas.
      <br/>
      Service is not provided beyond the range of cells at which distances the signals are too weak.
      <br/>
      Cells typically do not exceed 10 miles in diameter, although super large cells have been created in the Caribbean.
      <br/>
      The new PCS service, which operates at much higher frequencies, requires even smaller cells, three times as many cells must be built as are required for cellular service.
      <br/>
      In regions where population density is low, the cost of building and operating transmission facilities may exceed the potential revenues.
      <br/>
      Wireless is sometimes blocked by terrain even in highly populated regions because the transmission signal arrives at low elevation angles.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      Surveys show that customers currently are unhappy with unavailability and call blockage.
      <br/>
      Because of the low elevation angle transmission, service is sometimes interrupted during transmission or handover from cell to cell.
      <br/>
      During the peak busy hours, circuits are often blocked by other callers.
      <br/>
      Subscribers would like to enjoy wireless service all of the time, wherever they are.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      Another major problem is that wireless transmission standards differ throughout the world.
      <br/>
      International travelers ar required to use different telephones when they travel to other regions.
      <br/>
      Even within the U.S. the new digital cellular service will be based on both time division multiple access (TDMA) and code division multiple access (CDMA) technology.
      <br/>
      Current plans suggest that digital cellular customers who roam up the East Coast will travel alternatively between systems that use different access methods.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      Most of the world's telephone service is concentrated in the industrialized world.
      <br/>
      The 800 million people in industrialized countries have access to 400 million telephone lines, but 5 billion people in developing countries have access to only 200 million telephone lines.
      <br/>
      In Asia, more than 3 billion people have only 75 million telephone lines, and in Africa, with 500 million people, there is only one telephone per 1000 population.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      The cost of closing the gap in developing countries has been estimated to be $3 trillion.
      <br/>
      Space based services are a faster and less costly solution.
      <br/>
      Large regions that are not served today could be economically served in the future with satellites.
      <br/>
      New systems hold the potential for extending service into regions that have been inaccessible or uneconomical to serve because of low population density or weak economic conditions.
    </p>
    <p num="11">
      Even in affluent, densely populated countries like Japan nd Germany, mountainous conditions prevent full coverage.
      <br/>
      Japanese cellular service operators expect that half of the land area will not be covered by terrestrial wireless.
      <br/>
      We are on the threshold of being able to provide universal, affordable wireless service throughout the world.
    </p>
    <p num="12">
      Wireless service is more expensive than wireline service, especially in urban regions.
      <br/>
      From a service provider perspective, the cost is higher because the call routing, call maintenance and billing is more complex.
      <br/>
      From a subscriber perspective, wireless telephone service adds great value.
      <br/>
      Wireless telephones allow mobile workers to talk while traveling.
      <br/>
      Mobile calls provide greater flexibility and permit communications in situations in which they were previously impossible.
    </p>
    <p num="13">
      Today, cellular systems offer service with a wide range of tariffs. typically, the systems charge a monthly service fee of about $30 plus an additional charge based on airtime.
      <br/>
      For local services, the airtime rates vary between $0.10 to $0.90 per minute, depending on the region of the country or the world.
      <br/>
      Often, service providers offer cellular telephones at a discount but require a one year service contract, payment for the telephone equipment being embedded within the service price structure.
    </p>
    <p num="14">
      Currently, satellite service is available worldwide as an alternative to cellular service, but the terminal cost and service rates are very high.
      <br/>
      Inmarsat signatories offer service for airtime rates ranging from $5 to $15 per minute. "Portable" terminals that cost at least $15,000 and have a mass of 10 kilograms (22 pounds) can be lugged on trips.
      <br/>
      Terrestrial cellular has 1000 times more customers at service rates which are a factor of ten lower than present space based systems.
      <br/>
      The prices are very elastic.
    </p>
    <p num="15">
      Manufacturers of handsets and satellite systems recognized that cellular type communications from space could be much less expensive in the future than it is today.
      <br/>
      Several companies have determined that space based wireless service can be provided at service rates which are affordable by a mass market.
    </p>
    <p num="16">
      The primary consideration for business success is having a cost effective product which customers desire.
      <br/>
      This means balancing the service charges to own a personal telephone as well as the air time rates with the needs of the subscriber.
      <br/>
      Cost must also be kept affordable and economical compared to alternatives.
      <br/>
      However, each system must strike a balance between low cost and high quality.
      <br/>
      As a business, the service and distribution functions must provide an outlet to the ultimate customer, the consumer.
    </p>
    <p num="17">
      In the mid 1960's we had correctly determined that the best orbit for fixed satellite service was a geostationary orbit.
      <br/>
      This choice was logical because a stationary orbit permitted satellites to appear fixed in the sky.
      <br/>
      Large, high gain ground terminals could be positioned to ensure that the transmission path always would be clear.
      <br/>
      Although large, the antennas had no need to track, since the satellites appeared motionless to it.
      <br/>
      Only three or four satellites were needed to view most of the globe (excepting the polar regions).
      <br/>
      Unfortunately, the distance to Geostationary Earth Orbit (GEO) is great (about 23,000 miles) and the propagation time delay produces overtalking and confusion.
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      During the 1980's, conditions developed for a major change in the satellite communications paradigm: Orbiting satellites closer to the Earth would permit more powerful transmission with reasonable sized satellites and antennas.
      <br/>
      In addition, inclined orbits could ensure high elevation angles to minimize blockage by buildings, and other obstacles.
      <br/>
      The microelectronics for a ground station had become so compact that an affordable, light, hand held terminal could be built for satellite service.
      <br/>
      The lower power, application specific integrated circuit (ASIC) was built with GaAs, High density Bipolar Transistors (HBT) and high electron mobility power transistors (HEMPT's).
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      A conceptual view of the satellite network system is illustrated in FIG. 1.
      <br/>
      The satellite network system design provides the capability for METs and FESs to access one or more multiple beam satellites located in geostationary orbit to obtain communications services.
    </p>
    <p num="20">
      The heart of the satellite network system for each of the networks is the Network Control System (NCS) which monitors and controls each of the networks.
      <br/>
      The principal function of the NCS is to manage the overall satellite network system, to manage access to the satellite network system, to assign satellite circuits to meet the requirements of mobile customers and to provide network management and network administrative and call accounting functions.
    </p>
    <p num="21">
      The satellites each transmit and receive signals to and from METs at L-band frequencies and to and from Network Communications Controllers (NCCS) and Feederlink Earth Stations (FESs) at Ku-band frequencies.
      <br/>
      Communications at L-band frequencies is via a number of satellite beams which together cover the service area.
      <br/>
      The satellite beams are sufficiently strong to permit voice and data communications using inexpensive mobile terminals and will provide for frequency reuse of the L-band spectrum through inter-beam isolation.
      <br/>
      A single beam generally covers the service area.
    </p>
    <p num="22">
      The satellite network system provides the capability for mobile earth terminals to access one or more multiple beam satellites located in geostationary orbit for the purposes of providing mobile communications services.
      <br/>
      The satellite network system is desired to provide the following general categories of service:
    </p>
    <p num="23">
      Mobile Telephone Service (MTS).
      <br/>
      This service provides point-to-point circuit switched voice connections between mobile and public switched telephone network (PSTN) subscriber stations.
      <br/>
      It is possible for calls to be originated by either the mobile terminal or terrestrial user.
      <br/>
      Mobile terminal-to-mobile terminal calls are also supported.
    </p>
    <p num="24">
      Mobile Radio Service (MRS).
      <br/>
      This service provides point-to-point circuit switched connections between mobile terminal subscriber stations and subscriber stations in a private network (PN) which is not a part of the PSTN.
      <br/>
      It is possible for calls to be originated from either end.
      <br/>
      Mobile terminal-to-mobile terminal calls are also supported.
    </p>
    <p num="25">
      Mobile Telephone Cellular Roaming Service (MTCRS).
      <br/>
      This service provides Mobile Telephone Service to mobile subscribers who are also equipped with cellular radio telephones.
      <br/>
      Then the mobile terminal is within range of the cellular system, calls are serviced by the cellular system.
      <br/>
      When the mobile terminal is not in range of the cellular system, the MTCRS is selected to handle the call and appears to the user to be a part of the cellular system.
      <br/>
      When the mobile terminal is not in range of the cellular system, the MTCRS is selected to handle the call and appears to the user to be a part of the cellular system.
      <br/>
      It is possible for calls to be originated either from the MET or the PSTN.
      <br/>
      Mobile terminal-to-mobile terminal calls are also supported.
    </p>
    <p num="26">
      NET Radio (NR).
      <br/>
      This service provides point-to-multipoint circuit switched connections between mobile terminal subscriber stations and a central base station.
      <br/>
      Mobile users are able to listen to two-way conversations and to transmit using a push-to-talk mode of operation.
    </p>
    <p num="27">
      Mobile Data Service (MDS).
      <br/>
      This service provides a packet switched connection between a data terminal equipment (DTE) device at a mobile terminal and a data communications equipment (DCE)/DTE device connected to a public switched packet network.
      <br/>
      Integrated voice/data operation is also supported.
    </p>
    <p num="28">
      The satellites are designed to transmit signals at L-band frequencies in the frequency band 1530-1559 MHz.
      <br/>
      They will receive L-band frequencies in the frequency band 1631.5-1660.5 MHz. Polarization is right hand circular in both bands.
      <br/>
      The satellites will also transmit in the Ku frequency band, 10,750 MHz to 10,950 MHz, and receive Ku-band signals in the frequency band 13,000 to 13,250 MHz.
    </p>
    <p num="29">
      The satellite transponders are designed to translate communications signals accessing the satellite at Ku-band frequencies to an L-band frequency in a given beam and vice versa.
      <br/>
      The translation will be such that there is a one-to-one relation between frequency spectrum at Ku-band and frequency spectrum in any beam at L-band.
      <br/>
      The satellite transponders will be capable of supporting L-band communications in any portion of the 29 MHz allocation in any beam.
    </p>
    <p num="30">
      Transponder capacity is also provided for Ku-band uplink to Ku-band down-link for signalling and network management purposes between FESs and NCCs.
      <br/>
      The aggregate effective isotropic radiated power (AEIRP) is defined as that satellite e.i.r.p. that would result if the total available communications power of the communications subsystem was applied to the beam that covers that part of the service area.
      <br/>
      Some of the key performance parameters of the satellite are listed in FIG. 2.
    </p>
    <p num="31">
      The satellite network system interfaces to a number of entities which are required to access it for various purposes.
      <br/>
      FIG. 3 is a context diagram of the satellite network system conceptually illustrating these entities and their respective interfaces.
      <br/>
      Three major classes of entities are defined as user of communications services, external organizations requiring coordination, and network management system.
    </p>
    <p num="32">
      The users of satellite network communications services are MET users who access the satellite network system either via terrestrial networks (PSTN, PSDN, or Private Networks) or via METs for the purpose of using the services provided by the system.
      <br/>
      FES Owner/Operators are those organizations which own and control FESs that provide a terrestrial interface to the satellite network.
      <br/>
      When an FES becomes a part of the satellite network, it must meet specified technical performance criteria and interact with and accept real-time control from the NCCs.
      <br/>
      FES Owner/Operators determine the customized services that are offered and are ultimately responsible for the operation and maintenance of the FES.
      <br/>
      Customers and service providers interact with the Customer Management Information System within the Network Management System.
    </p>
    <p num="33">The satellite network system interfaces to, and performs transactions with, the external organizations described below:</p>
    <p num="34">
      Satellite Operations Center (SOC): The SOC is not included in the satellite network ground segment design.
      <br/>
      However, the satellite network system interfaces with the SOC in order to maintain cognizance of the availability of satellite resources (e.g. in the event of satellite health problems, eclipse operations, etc.) and, from time to time, to arrange for any necessary satellite reconfiguration to meet changes in traffic requirements.
    </p>
    <p num="35">NOC: The satellite network system interfaces with the satellites located therein via the NOC for a variety of operational reasons including message delivery and coordination.</p>
    <p num="36">Independent NOCs: The satellite network system interfaces with outside organizations which lease resources on satellite network satellites and which are responsible for managing and allocating these resources in a manner suited to their own needs.</p>
    <p num="37">Other System NOCs: This external entity represents outside organizations which do not lease resources on satellite network satellites but with whom operational coordination is required.</p>
    <p num="38">
      The satellite network management system (NMS) is normally located at an administration's headquarters and may comprise three major functional entities; Customer Management Information System (CMIS), Network Engineering, and System Engineering (NE/SE).
      <br/>
      These entities perform functions necessary for the management and maintenance of the satellite network system which are closely tied to the way the administration intends to do business.
      <br/>
      The basic functions which are performed by CMIS, Network Engineering, and System Engineering are as follows:
    </p>
    <p num="39">
      Customer Management Information System: This entity provides customers and service providers with assistance and information including problem resolution, service changes, and billing/usage data.
      <br/>
      Customers include individual MET owners and fleet managers of larger corporate customers.
      <br/>
      Service providers are the retailers and maintenance organizations which interact face to face with individual and corporate customers.
    </p>
    <p num="40">
      Network Engineering: This entity develops plans and performs analysis in support of the system.
      <br/>
      Network Engineering analyzes the requirements of the network.
      <br/>
      It reconciles expected traffic loads with the capability and availability of space and ground resources to produce frequency plans for the different beams within the system.
      <br/>
      In addition, Network Engineering defines contingency plans for failure situations.
    </p>
    <p num="41">System Engineering: This entity engineers the subsystems, equipment and software which is needed to expand capacity to meet increases in traffic demands and to provide new features and services which become marketable to subscribers.</p>
    <p num="42">
      The satellite network system comprises a number of system elements and their interconnecting communications links as illustrated conceptually in FIG. 4.
      <br/>
      The system elements are the NOC, the NCC, the FES, the MET, the Remote Monitor Station (RMS), and the System Test Station (STS).
      <br/>
      The interconnecting communications links are the satellite network Internetwork, terrestrial links, the MET signaling channels, the Interstation signaling channels, and the MET-FES communications channels.
      <br/>
      The major functions of each of the system elements are as follows:
    </p>
    <p num="43">
      NOC.
      <br/>
      The NOC manages and controls the resources of the satellite network system and carries out the administrative functions associated with the management of the total satellite network system.
      <br/>
      The NOC communicates with the various internal and external entities via a local area network (LAN)/wide area network (WAN) based satellite network Internetwork and dial-up lines.
    </p>
    <p num="44">
      NCC. The NCC manages the real time allocation of circuits between METs and FESs for the purposes of supporting communications.
      <br/>
      The available circuits are held in circuit pools managed by Group Controllers (GCs) within the NCC.
      <br/>
      The NCC communicates with the NOC via the satellite network Internetwork, with FESs via Ku-to-Ku band interstation signaling channels or terrestrial links, and with mobile terminals via Ku-to-L band signaling channels.
    </p>
    <p num="45">
      FES. The FES supports communications links between METs, the PSTN, private networks, and other METs.
      <br/>
      Once a channel is established with an MET, call completion and service feature management is accomplished via In-Band signaling over the communication channel.
      <br/>
      Two types of FESs have been defined for the satellite network system; Gateway FESs and Base FESs.
      <br/>
      Gateway FESs provide MTS and MTCRS services.
      <br/>
      Base FESs provide MRS and NR services.
    </p>
    <p num="46">
      MET. The MET provides the mobile user access to the communications channels and services provided by the satellite network system.
      <br/>
      A range of terminal types has been defined for the satellite network system.
    </p>
    <p num="47">
      RMS. The RMS monitors L-band RF spectrum and transmission performance in specific L-band beams.
      <br/>
      An RMS is nominally located in each L-band beam.
      <br/>
      Each RMS interfaces with the NOC via either a satellite or terrestrial link.
    </p>
    <p num="48">
      STS. The STS provides an L-band network access capability to support FES commissioning tests and network service diagnostic tests.
      <br/>
      The STS is collocated with, and interfaced to, the NOC.
    </p>
    <p num="49">
      Communications channels transport voice transmissions between METs and FESs via the satellite.
      <br/>
      Connectivity for MET-to-MET calls is accomplished by double hopping the communications channels via specially equipped FESs.
      <br/>
      Signaling channels are used to set up and tear down communications circuits, to monitor and control FES and MET operation, and to transport other necessary information between network elements for the operation of satellite network.
      <br/>
      The system provides Out-of-Band and Interstation signaling channels for establishing calls and transferring information.
      <br/>
      In-Band signaling is provided on established communications channels for supervisory and feature activation purposes.
      <br/>
      A detailed description of the satellite network signaling system architecture is provided in L. White, et al., "North American Mobile Satellite System Signaling Architecture," AIAA 14th International Communications Satellite Conference, Washington, DC (March 1992), incorporated herein by reference.

      The satellite network Internetwork provides interconnection among the major satellite network ground system elements such as the NOCs, NCCs, and Data Hubs, as well as external entities.
      <br/>
      Various leased and dial-up lines are used for specific applications within the satellite network system such as backup interstation links between the NCC and FESs and interconnection of RMSs with the NOC.
    </p>
    <p num="51">
      The primary function of the NOC is to manage and control the resources of the satellite network system.
      <br/>
      FIG. 5 is a basic conceptual block diagram of the NOC and its interface.
      <br/>
      The NOC computer is shown with network connections, peripheral disks, fault tolerant features, and expansion capabilities to accommodate future growth.
      <br/>
      The NOC software is represented as two major layers, a functional layer and a support layer.
      <br/>
      The functional layer represents the application specific portion of the NOC software.
      <br/>
      The support layer represents software subsystems which provide a general class of services and are used by the subsystems in the functional layer.
    </p>
    <p num="52">
      The application specific functions performed by the NOC are organized according to five categories: fault management, accounting management, configuration management, performance management, and security management.
      <br/>
      The general NCC Terminal Equipment (NCCTE) configuration showing constituent equipment includes: processing equipment, communications equipment, mass storage equipment, man-machine interface equipment, and optional secure MET Access Security Key (ASK) storage equipment.
      <br/>
      The Processing Equipment consists of one or more digital processors that provide overall NCC control, NCS call processing, network access processing and internetwork communications processing.
    </p>
    <p num="53">
      The Communications Equipment consists of satellite signaling and communications channel units and FES terrestrial communication link interface units.
      <br/>
      The Mass Storage Equipment provides NCC network configuration database storage, call record spool buffering an executable program storage.
      <br/>
      The Man-Machine Interface Equipment provides operator command, display and hard copy facilities, and operator access to the computer operating systems.
      <br/>
      The MET ASK storage Equipment provides a physically secure facility for protecting and distributing MET Access Security Keys.
    </p>
    <p num="54">
      The NCCTE comprises three functional subsystems: NCCTE Common Equipment Subsystem, Group Controller Subsystem, and Network Access Subsystem.
      <br/>
      The NCCTE Common Equipment subsystem comprises an NCC Controller, NCCTE mass storage facilities, and the NCCTE man-machine interface.
      <br/>
      The NCC Controller consists of processing and database resources which perform functions which are common to multiple Group Controllers.
      <br/>
      These functions include satellite network Internetwork communications, central control and monitoring of the NCCTE and NCCRE, storage of the network configuration, buffering of FES and Group Controller call accounting data, transfer of transaction information to the Off-line NCC and control and monitoring of FESs.
    </p>
    <p num="55">
      The Mass Storage element provides NCC network configuration database storage, call accounting data spool buffering, and NCCTE executable program storage.
      <br/>
      The Man-machine Interface provides Operator command and display facilities for control and monitoring of NCC operation and includes hard copy facilities for logging events and alarms.
      <br/>
      A Group Controller (GC) is the physical NCC entity consisting of hardware and software processing resources that provides real time control according to the CG database received from the NOC.
    </p>
    <p num="56">
      The Group Controller Subsystem may incorporate one to four Group Controllers.
      <br/>
      Each Group Controller maintains state machines for every call in progress within the Control Group.
      <br/>
      It allocates and de-allocates circuits for FES-MET calls within each beam of the system, manages virtual network call processing, MET authentication, and provides certain elements of call accounting.
      <br/>
      When required, it provides satellite bandwidth resources to the NOC for AMS(R)S resource provisioning.
      <br/>
      The Group Controller monitors the performance of call processing and satellite circuit pool utilization.
      <br/>
      It also performs MET management, commissioning and periodic performance verification testing.
    </p>
    <p num="57">
      The Network Access Subsystem consists of satellite interface channel equipment for Out-of-Band signaling and Interstation Signaling which are used to respond to MET and FES requests for communications services.
      <br/>
      The Network Access Processor also includes MET communications interfaces that are used to perform MET commission testing.
      <br/>
      In addition, the subsystem includes terrestrial data link equipment for selected FES Interstation Signaling.
    </p>
    <p num="58">
      The principal function of the FES is to provide the required circuit switched connections between the satellite radio channels, which provide communications links to the mobile earth terminals, and either the PSTN or PN.
      <br/>
      FESs will be configured as Gateway Stations (GS) to provide MTS and MTCRS services or Base Stations to provide MRS and Net Radio services.
      <br/>
      Gateway and Base functions can be combined in a single station.
    </p>
    <p num="59">
      The FES operates under the real time control of the Network Communications Controller (NCC) to implement the call set-up and take-down procedures of the communications channels to and from the METs.
      <br/>
      Control of the FES by the NCC is provided via the interstation signaling channels.
      <br/>
      An FES will support multiple Control Groups and Virtual Networks.
      <br/>
      The FES is partitioned into two major functional blocks, the FES RF Equipment (FES-RE) and the FES Terminal Equipment (FES-TE).
      <br/>
      The principal function of the FES-RE is to provide the radio transmission functions for the FES.
      <br/>
      In the transmit direction it combines all signals from the communications and interstation signaling channel unit outputs from the FES-TE, and amplifies them and up-convert these to Ku-Band for transmission to the satellite via the antenna.
      <br/>
      In the receive direction, signals received from the satellite are down-converted from Ku-Band, amplified and distributed to the channel units within the FES-TE.
      <br/>
      Additional functions include satellite induced Doppler correction, satellite tracking and uplink power control to combat rain fades.
    </p>
    <p num="60">
      The principal function of the FES-TE is to perform the basic call processing functions for the FES and to connect the METs to the appropriate PSTN or PN port.
      <br/>
      Under control of the NCC, the FES assigns communications channel units to handle calls initiated by MET or PSTN subscribers.
      <br/>
      The FES-TE also performs alarm reporting, call detail record recording, and provision of operator interfaces.

    <p num="61">
      For operational convenience, an FES may in some cases be collocated with the NCC.
      <br/>
      In this event, the NCC RF Equipment will be shared by the two system elements and the interstation signaling may be via a LAN.
      <br/>
      Connection to and from the PSTN is via standard North American interconnect types as negotiated with the organization providing PSTN interconnection.
      <br/>
      This will typically be a primary rate digital interconnect.
      <br/>
      Connection to and from private networks is via standard North American interconnect types as negotiated with the organization requesting satellite network service.
      <br/>
      This will typically be a primary rate digital interconnect for larger FESs or an analog interconnect for FESs equipped with only a limited number of channels may be employed.

      Digital speech compression means that each satellite can serve a much larger number of customers, substantially reducing the cost of the space segment.
      <br/>
      Unfortunately compression introduces 80 to 100 milliseconds of additional delay, rendering GEO systems almost unusable due to overtalking.

      Omnidirectional antennas are also essential for personal telephones because the mobile users move.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, the GEO satellite loses its motionless advantage, and the satellites might just as well move also.

      Improved battery technology for higher power density meant lower mass.

      1.
      <br/>
      Data Transmission And Messaging From Very Small, Inexpensive Satellites.
      <br/>
      Sometimes these are called the Little low earth orbits (LEO's).
      <br/>
      These systems are the space equivalent of paging systems.
      <br/>
      Examples include Orbcomm, Starsys, and VITA.
      <br/>
      The GEO predecessor was GEOSTAR, which continues to operate using small packages on Spacenet 3 and GSTAR.
      <br/>
      Orbcomm has already launched experimental satellites.
      <br/>
      The messaging data rates range from 100 to 4800 bits per second (bps).

      Frequency spectrum was originally st aside for Maritime Mobile Satellite Service (MSS).
      <br/>
      The original set of bands was established with Inmarsat service in mind.
      <br/>
      These bands are in the region of 1.6 and 1.5 GHz. More recently, additional bands have been designated for Aeronautical MSS and Land MSS.
      <br/>
      These bands are also used for domestic service in the U.S., Canada, Mexico, Australia, and Japan.
    </p>
    <p num="98">
      The spectrum that was allocated for Radio Determination Satellite Service at WARC-88 was made coprimary with MSS at WARC-92.
      <br/>
      The U.S. FCC has allocated the top 5 MHz of the 1.6 GHz band for TDMA and the lower 11.5 MHZ for CDMA.
      <br/>
      The lower part of the 1.6 GHz band has also been used by Russian Glonass Navigation system and the Radio Astronomy service won a primary allocation for the lower part as well.
    </p>
    <p num="99">
      Inmarsat P has campaigned for additional service link spectrum in the new Personal Communication Service band which is also called the Future Personal Land Mobile Telephone Service (FPLMTS).
      <br/>
      Many of the developing countries and some developed countries use the 2.0/2.2 GHz bands for terrestrial services including troposcatter and microwave links.
    </p>
    <p num="100">
      In addition to the question of moving service link displacement dates, special provision must be made for feeder links.
      <br/>
      This could be a more important issue than the provision of communications services, since a wider bandwidth is required for the backhaul to the Land Earth Stations.
      <br/>
      Generally, wider bandwidths are available at higher frequencies.
      <br/>
      Currently, there is major competition for spectrum all the way up to 20/30 GHz (Ka bands).
    </p>
    <p num="101">Some of the satellite companies would like to operate in lower bands because the lower bands are less susceptible to rain attenuation and weather conditions.</p>
    <p num="102">
      These bands are currently used by a number of critical services, including the Aeronautical Services.
      <br/>
      The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) and the FAA use the C-band spectrum near 5 GHz for both communications and wind shear radar.
      <br/>
      Several of the Big LEO's, including Globalstar and Inmarsat P also want to use these bands.
    </p>
    <p num="103">
      Some of the systems would employ the use of reverse band transmissions for feeder links.

      FIG. 6 shows the relative altitude of the orbits.

      GEO satellites are located in orbits farthest from the Earth.

      Most of the non-geostationary satellites are located in LEO orbits, between the Earth's atmosphere and the inner Van Allen Belt.
      <br/>
      The inner belt contains trapped particles which have been ejected from the sun.
      <br/>
      The particles in the inner belt are high intensity, high energy electrons which are dangerous to electronic components.
      <br/>
      Collisions with satellites produce X-rays and additional energetic electrons.
      <br/>
      Shielding within the belt is not practical and satellites in this region would survive only for a few months.
    </p>
    <p num="105">
      Medium earth orbit (MEO) satellites take advantage of gap between the inner and outer Van Allen belts and orbit satellites in inclined orbits.
      <br/>
      This region enables service without encountering the extremely dangerous radiation levels within the Van Allen belts.
      <br/>
      Although the radiation level is about twice as intense as that for GEO, the MEO satellite can be protected by selective shielding and use of hardened electronic components.

      The race to provide lower cost, space based mobile communications started with the U.S. domestic proposals to the FCC by Skylink and MOBILSAT which merged with other proponents into the consortium which is called American Mobile Satellite Corp. (AMSC).

      This GEO system, illustrated in FIG. 7, is designed to service vehicles with transportable terminals.
      <br/>
      The satellite antennas are 5 to 6 meters in diameter.

      Each satellite can provide 1900 circuits.

      The system is designed to provide domestic service to the U.S. and Canada.

      MSAT uses the existing spectrum which is shared with Inmarsat.
      <br/>
      Other countries are also using this spectrum for domestic services.
      <br/>
      The constellation includes two GEO satellites, one for AMSC and one for Telsat Mobile Inc. of Canada which is also developing a comparable service.
      <br/>
      The satellite inclination is approximately 0 (degree) , having an altitude of approximately 35,000 km.

      Two ground stations or control stations are provided.
      <br/>
      The access method to the system is frequency division multiple access (FDMA).

      <br/>
      Separate antennas would be desirable for the satellite mobile link receive and transmit functions, but this may be impractical given such large aperture antennas.

    <p num="114">Iridium</p>
    <p num="115">
      Iridium was one of the earliest systems to consider voice communications from non-geostationary orbits.
      <br/>
      Much of the exploration and optimization of space based mobile communications services has taken Iridium into consideration.
      <br/>
      Iridium is designed to provide global communications by means of state of the art electronics.
      <br/>
      The architecture reflects the need to network LEO communications in space.
    </p>
    <p num="116">
      Because the satellites operate from relatively low altitude (460 statute miles), each satellite can only observe about 2% of the Earth's surface at a given time.
      <br/>
      Consequently 66 satellites are needed to provide the service.
      <br/>
      The satellites therefore are frequently out of contact with land facilities which could carry transmissions into the terrestrial wireline infrastructure.
      <br/>
      Iridium attempts to overcome this obstacle by passing communications between satellites until a land Earth station can make the terrestrial connection.
      <br/>
      This architecture provides a space network which links the entire Iridium system to the Public Switched Telephone Networks (PSTNs).
    </p>
    <p num="117">
      As illustrated in FIG. 9, each satellite projects 48 beams to the Earth, and the satellites provide very high link margins.

      The system is designed so that one satellite beam always provides service to a given spot on the Earth.
      <br/>
      Several satellites are available to provide service in more northerly locations, but only one satellite is used.
      <br/>
      Because the satellites orbit at the low altitude, the elevation angles can be as low as 10 degrees, and the average elevation angle is about 28 degrees.

      These motion of 15 degrees and 35 degrees per minute.

      Approximately twenty ground stations are used to control and/or administer the Iridium project.

      FIG. 10 is an illustration of a Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite system for Globalstar that does not use satellite cross links, uses CDMA communication protocol, and does not process signals on board.
      <br/>
      The Globalstar satellite system is similar to Iridium.
      <br/>
      The satellites operate at a higher altitude (about 830 statute miles), and can observe as much as 5% of the surface of the Earth at a time.
      <br/>
      Consequently, service can be provided by using a somewhat smaller number of satellites (i.e., approximately 48).
      <br/>
      Each satellite is simpler than the Iridium satellites, since Globalstar does not use satellite cross links.
      <br/>
      The system uses CDMA, but the satellites do not process the signals on board.
      <br/>
      This "bent pipe" transponder approach keeps complexity low.

      Globalstar employs spatial diversity by transmitting signals through two satellites.

      The two CDMA signals are combined in each handset using standard Rake receivers (which add the two CDMA signals constructively).

      This technique provides the most robust service when two satellites are available.

      FIG. 11 is an illustration of a Medium Earth Orbit (MEO) satellite system for Odyssey with satellites operating inside the Van Allen Belts.

      Odyssey employs orbiting satellites in Medium Earth Orbit or Intermediate Circular Orbits (ICO) for mobile satellite service.
      <br/>
      The Odyssey designers recognized that a cost effective system which would not cause time delay could use a relatively small number of satellites.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, a small constellation of satellites would require a smaller number of ground antennas and less complex operations.
      <br/>
      However, this meant that the satellites would operate inside the Van Allen Belts.
    </p>
    <p num="125">
      Ag These considerations led to the selection of the MEO, which can furnish initial service with only six satellites, and full global coverage with only nine satellites.
      <br/>
      With twelve satellites, at least two satellites are visible from any point in the world.
      <br/>
      The system is baselined with twelve satellites so that the satellite constellation would have built in redundancy.
      <br/>
      This configuration provides the foundation of diversity service.

      Satellites have an apparent motion of 1 (degree)  per minute.

      Odyssey provides the highest elevation angles of all the mobile satellite systems proposed for voice service.

      <br/>
      This type of diversity service provides very high availability for the user.
      <br/>
      The system is also designed with directed coverage to concentrate capacity into the regions where demand is the greatest.

    <p num="139">
      While the description below focuses on the AMSC Satellite System, this description is conceptually appropriate for the other above described satellite systems.
      <br/>
      The MET includes all of the communication and control functions necessary to support communications from a vehicle or fixed remote site using the resources of the satellite network system.
      <br/>
      FIGS. 15 and 16 are basic block diagrams of the physical architecture and functions of the mobile earth terminal.
      <br/>
      The basic functional diagram of FIG. 16 is implemented by baseband processing and RF electronics of FIG. 15. A standard voice coder/decoder receives coded messages from the baseband processing and RF electronic system and decodes the message received from the satellite antenna unit for delivery to the interface unit that includes standard user interfaces.
      <br/>
      Baseband processing and RF electronics receive satellite communications responsive with low noise amplifier (LNA) and output signals for transmission using the diplexer of the antenna unit.
      <br/>
      Baseband processing and RF electronics also outputs signals for use with beam steering antennas as will be discussed below.
      <br/>
      Advantageously, the mobile earth terminal is functional with antennas that are either steerable or nonsteerable.
    </p>
    <p num="140">
      The functional subsystems comprising the MET are shown in FIG. 16 and include the user interface, transceiver, antenna, logic and signaling, power supply subsystems, and Position Determination subsystem.
      <br/>
      The baseline MET will have a low gain directional antenna in the antenna subsystem.
      <br/>
      The satellite network system supports communications with METs using omnidirectional and higher gain directional antennas.
    </p>
    <p num="141">
      The user interface subsystem provides the user interfaces through which the user has access to the services supported by the satellite network system.
      <br/>
      Depending on the service(s) the MET will be equipped with one or more of the devices or ports.
      <br/>
      The transceiver subsystem consists of a receiver and a transmitter.
      <br/>
      The transmitter accepts voice, data, fax and signaling signals and converts them to a modulated RF signal.
      <br/>
      The transmit RF signal is routed to the antenna subsystem.
      <br/>
      The transmitter typically consists of the high power amplifier (HPA), the upconverter with its associated frequency synthesizer, the modulators and the modules for voice, Fax, or data encoding, multiplexing, scrambling, FEC encoding, interleaving and frame formatting.

      The receiver accepts modulated RF signals from the antenna subsystem and converts them into voice, data, fax or signaling signals as appropriate.
      <br/>
      The voice, data and fax signals are routed to the user interface subsystem.
      <br/>
      The receiver typically consists of the downconverter with its associated frequency synthesizer, the demodulator, and the modules for frame de-formatting, de-interleaving, FEC decoding, descrambling, demultiplexing and voice, Fax, or data decoding.
      <br/>
      The transceiver communicates over one channel in each direction at any one time.
      <br/>
      Thus, the transceiver subsystem will typically consist of only one receiver and one transmitter.
      <br/>
      However, the MET may also incorporate a pilot receiver for antennas and frequency tracking purposes, or a complete receiver dedicated to the continuous reception of the signaling channel from the Group Controller.
      <br/>
      Three different transceiver/receiver configurations are illustrated in FIGS. 17a-17c.
    </p>
    <p num="143">
      The antenna subsystem provides the MET interface to the satellite network and is responsible for receiving the RF signal from the satellite and transmitting the RF signal generated by the MET towards the satellite.
      <br/>
      The subsystem typically includes an antenna which may be either directional or omnidirectional, a diplexer, a low noise amplifier (LNA), an optional beam steering unit (BSU) if a directional antenna is used, a device such as a compass or an inertial sensor for the determination of the orientation of the vehicle, and an antenna for the position determination receiver.

      The logic and signaling subsystem acts as the central controller for the MET.
      <br/>
      Its basic functions are to initialize the MET by performing a self test at power up and control, based on a resident system table, the acquisition of one of the METs assigned outbound signaling channels from which updated system information and commands and messages from the GC are derived.
      <br/>
      The logic and signaling subsystem sets up and configures the transceiver for the reception and transmission of voice, data, fax or signaling messages as appropriate.
      <br/>
      The logic and signaling subsystem also handles the protocols between the MET and the FES and between the MET the GC via signaling messages, and checks the validity of the received signaling messages (Cyclic Redundance Check (CRC)) and generates the CRC codes for the signaling message transmitted by the MET.
    </p>
    <p num="145">
      The logic and signaling subsystem also interprets the commands received from the local user via the user interface subsystem (e.g. on/off hook, dialled numbers, etc.) and take the appropriate actions needed, and generates, or commands the generation, of control signals, messages and indications to the user through the user interface subsystem.
      <br/>
      The logic signaling system also controls the beam steering unit (if any) in the antenna subsystem, and monitors and tests all the other subsystems.
      <br/>
      In case of fault detection, it informs the user about the failure and take the appropriate measures needed to prevent harmful interference to the satellite network or other system.

      The power supply subsystem provides power to all other subsystems.

      A standard receiver such as a GPS or a Loran-C receiver is also provided for the determination of the position of the vehicle.

      This information is used by the logic and signaling subsystem for beam steering (if used) or for applications such as position reporting.

      The position determination system is implemented externally to the MET and interfaced through a dedicated data port in the user interface subsystem.

      The RMS is controlled by the NOC and communicates via leased lines or the interstation signaling channels if collocated with an FES.

    <p num="154">
      The basic element of communication for signaling and control for the MSS signaling system is the Signaling Unit (SU).
      <br/>
      The SU consists of 96 bits organized in 12 octets of 8 bits each.
      <br/>
      The first 80 bits comprise the message, and the last 16 a parity check, computed using the CCITT CRC-16 algorithm.
      <br/>
      The SU itself may take a variety of forms, depending on its use.
      <br/>
      The format of a typical SU, in this case a MET request for access, is shown in FIG. 19. For transmission, the SU is convolutionally encoded at either rate 3/4 or 1/2, adding an additional 32 or 96 bits respectively.
    </p>
    <p num="155">
      For the example given in FIG. 19, the meanings of the various fields are as follows:

      The frame formats used in the GC-S, MET-SR and MET-ST channels are closely related, and are based on a common 360 millisecond superframe established on the GC-S channel.
      <br/>
      The frame formats and relationships of the out of band signaling channels are shown in FIG. 20.
    </p>
    <p num="161">
      In FIG. 20, all timing relationships in the MSS system signaling scheme are determined from the GC-S frame structure.
      <br/>
      The GC-S is operated in the QPSK mode at an aggregate rate of 6750 b/s.
      <br/>
      The stream is divided into superframes of 360 ms, comprising three 120 ms frames.
      <br/>
      Each frame is in turn comprised of a 24-bit unique word (UW), six SUs, eight flush bits and 10 unused bits, for a total of 810 bits and 120 ms.
      <br/>
      The first frame of a superframe is identified by inversion of the UW.
    </p>
    <p num="162">
      Mobile terminals throughout the area covered by any beam receive GC-S channels with a total uncertainty of approximately 32 ms, primarily due to their geographical locations.
      <br/>
      The received superframe boundary establishes the four 90 ms "slots" in the MET-SR random access channels, which operate in the BPSK mode at 3375 b/s.
      <br/>
      The actual random access burst is comprised of a 24-bit preamble, a 32-bit UW, a 128-bit SU (96 bits rate 3/4 coded), and eight flush bits, for a total of 192 bits in 56.9 ms. This allows a 33.1 ms guard time between bursts.
      <br/>
      Mobile Terminals select a MET-SR channel and slot at random from among the permitted choices.
    </p>
    <p num="163">
      The MET-ST TDMA channels, which also operate in the BPSK mode at 3375 b/s, are comprised of bursts which are equal in length to the GC-S frame, and which are also timed on the received frame boundary.
      <br/>
      The TDMA burst is made up of a 24-bit preamble, a 32-bit UW, a 192-bit SU (96 bits rate 1/2 coded), and eight flush bits.
      <br/>
      The total length of the TDMA burst is 256 bits in 75.9 ms, which allows a guard time of 44.1 ms. Mobile Terminals always respond to commands received on the GC-S on a MET-ST channel which corresponds in number to the position of the command SU in the TDM frame.
      <br/>
      For example, the MET will respond to a command in SU slot 2 on MET-ST channel 2, and so forth.
      <br/>
      The response is always transmitted in the second frame time after receipt of the command, so that there is a minimum of 120 ms in which the MET can prepare its response.
    </p>
    <p num="164">
      The initial phase of establishing a call is handled by out-of-band signaling on the GC-S, MET-SR and MET-ST channels.
      <br/>
      This phase culminates in assignment of a pair of communication channels to the MET and FES.
      <br/>
      When these elements receive and tune to the communication channels, further signaling and control functions are accomplished using inband signaling.
      <br/>
      The communication channels, FES-C and MET-C, use a variety of related TDM formats which are determined by the intended use of the link, i.e., voice, data, or facsimile and one of three possible primary modes: call setup (entirely signaling), communication (no signaling), or in-band signaling (an occasional subframe of 128 bits is used for signaling/control).
    </p>
    <p num="165">
      The same 96-bit SU described above is used to accomplish in-band signaling.
      <br/>
      A typical example of a communication channel format, in this case voice mode in-band signaling is shown in FIG. 21.
    </p>
    <p num="166">
      The outbound TDM, inbound TDMA, and inbound random access channels provide signaling between the GC and each of the METS in the associated control group.
      <br/>
      All communications on these channels will be passed in the form of 96 bit (12 octet) messages known as signaling units.
      <br/>
      Each signaling unit will begin with a 1-octet messages type field and end with a two-octet cyclic redundancy check.
      <br/>
      The MET to GC Signaling Protocol (MGSP) serves as the layer two protocol for these channels.
    </p>
    <p num="167">
      Communications from the group controller (GC) to the mobile terminals is provided by the Outbound TDM or GC-S channel.
      <br/>
      The primary function of this channel is to carry frequency assignments from the GC to individual METs.
      <br/>
      In addition, the Outbound TDM channel carries network status information which is received by all METs in a particular beam and control group.
      <br/>
      The outbound TDM channel operates at a rate of 6750 bits/s with rate 3/4 FEC.
      <br/>
      QPSK modulation and nominally 6.5 kHz channel spacing (other spacings are under investigation) is employed.
      <br/>
      These parameters are identical to those of the communications channel and were chosen to reduce MET complexity.
    </p>
    <p num="168">
      Inbound TDMA (MET-ST) channels are used by the MET to respond to actions initiated by the GC, such as responding to the call announcement issued by the GC to check a MET's availability to receive a PSTN originated or MET to MET call.
      <br/>
      The Inbound Random Access (MET-SR) channels are used by METs to request frequency assignments and for other MET initiated actions.
      <br/>
      The inbound random access and TDMA channels each operate at a rate of 2400 bits/s with rate 3/4 FEC.
      <br/>
      DPS modulation and nominally 7.5 kHz channel spacing is employed.
      <br/>
      This modulation scheme has been selected because of its robust performance in the presence of frequency offset and timing errors.
      <br/>
      It also exhibits superior performance relative to conventional BPSK in the presence of band-limiting and hard-limiting.
    </p>
    <p num="169">
      Each control group has associated with it a number of L-band beams over which it operates.
      <br/>
      In each of these L-band beams a control group has associated with it a distinct set of outbound TDM, inbound TDMA, and inbound random access channels.
      <br/>
      The number of signaling channels of each type in each set is determined based on the level of signaling traffic flowing between the GC and the METs in that control group in that L-band beam.
      <br/>
      As signaling traffic levels change, new signaling channels of each type are allocated to or deallocated from a particular set of channels.
      <br/>
      The frequencies used for outbound TDM, inbound TDMA, and inbound random access channels are included in the status information carrier in the bulletin board signaling units transmitted on the outbound TDM channel.
    </p>
    <p num="170">
      Each MET is assigned to one of the outbound TDM channels in the control group and beam to which it belongs.
      <br/>
      Each control group supports up to 16 outbound TDM channels in each beam.
      <br/>
      Each outbound TDM channel has associated with it up to 6 inbound TDMA channels.
      <br/>
      An A inbound TDMA channel will only carry messages that are responses to messages received on the outbound TDM channel with which it is associated inbound random access channels will not associated with a particular outbound TDM channel.
      <br/>
      A MET chooses a inbound random access channel at random from among those associated with its control group and beam each time a message is to be transmitted.
      <br/>
      Each control group can support up to 64 inbound random access channels in each beam.
      <br/>
      Up to 64 of these channels may be used system wide to meet the signaling requirements of a fully loaded system supporting 5000 circuits.
    </p>
    <p num="171">
      Inband signaling channels (FES-C and MET-C) are provided between the FES and the MET.
      <br/>
      These channels are used to provide signaling for call setup and call release, and also provide the capability to pass other signaling information while a call is in progress.
      <br/>
      The FES-C and MET-C channels are operated in two separate modes in "call setup mode" only signaling messages are carried by the channel.
      <br/>
      In voice mode voice frames are carried by the channel, but the capability to inject signaling messages by occasionally dropping voice subframes exists.
      <br/>
      Frames IA containing inband signaling messages employ a unique word different from that used for frames containing only voice subframes.
    </p>
    <p num="172">
      Interstation signaling channels (GC-I and FES-I) are zPused to pass signaling information between the GC and each of the FESs.
      <br/>
      These channels operate at a rate of 9.6 to 64 kbit/s and are implemented using either the available 5 MHz Ku-band satellite capacity or terrestrial links.
      <br/>
      The LAP-F protocol will be employed on those links to ensure reliable transfer of variable length signaling and network management messages.
    </p>
    <p num="173">
      When a MET is idle (powered on and ready to receive a call) it will continuously receive an Outbound TDM channel in order to receive call announcements associated with incoming calls and obtain status information from bulletin board signaling units.
      <br/>
      Each MET will be capable of transmitting signaling information to the GC on any of the inbound random access channels or on any of the inbound TDMA channels associated with the outbound TDM channel that it is receiving.
      <br/>
      During a call a MET will receive and transmit all signaling information via the In-Band signaling channels.
      <br/>
      No signaling information will be sent to a MET via the outbound TDM channel during a call.
      <br/>
      Any signaling messages from the GC to the MET will be sent to the MET via the FES through the GC-I and FES-C channels.
    </p>
    <p num="174">
      Each group controller supports at least one outbound TDM channel in each of its associated L-band beams.
      <br/>
      Each outbound TDM signaling channel is continuously transmitted and carries frequency assignments and networks status information from the GC to the METs.
      <br/>
      The outbound TDM channels are also used to poll idle METs to see if they can accept incoming calls.
      <br/>
      As this channel is the only way to signal information to a MET not engaged in communications, it must be as robust as possible under harsh fading and shadowing conditions.
    </p>
    <p num="175">
      Another key element in the MSS system is the need for the METs to be as inexpensive as possible.
      <br/>
      Towards this end, the outbound TDM channel will have the same rate and modulation as the communications channels.
      <br/>
      This will maximize the commonality of the receive chain of the MET for communications and signaling.
      <br/>
      Note that as the demodulation process is much more complex than the modulation process, the inbound random access and inbound TDMA channels do not really require this level of commonality with the communications channel.
    </p>
    <p num="176">
      The number of outbound TDM channels assigned to each set of signaling channels is determined by the traffic supported by the group controller in that L-band beam.
      <br/>
      Assignment of METs to outbound TDM channels is made based on a special identifier assigned to each MET as commissioning.
      <br/>
      This identifier is called the GC-S Selector Identifier code (GSI).
      <br/>
      The MET selects the outbound TDM channel to be used by dividing the GSI by the total number of outbound TDM channels available in the given beam.
      <br/>
      The number of TDM channels available is given in the BB of each TDM channel.
      <br/>
      The remainder of the four bit binary division process will form the number of the channel to be used.
      <br/>
      Each MET will receive only the outbound TDM channel assigned to it.
      <br/>
      This method allows METs in the same logical grouping to be assigned to the same outbound TDM channel as is needed for the Net Radio Service provided by the MSS System.
      <br/>
      It also allows the load on the outbound TDM channels to be redistributed quickly if a channel fails or a new channel is added.
    </p>
    <p num="177">
      The 120 ms frame length was chosen because it would support 6 messages per frame and correspond to the slot size requirement (&gt;120 ms) of the inbound TDMA channel.
      <br/>
      This allows a direct correspondence between outbound TDM frames and inbound TDMA slots for the purposes of TDMA synchronization and scheduling responses to outbound messages.
      <br/>
      Eight flush bits are included at the end of each frame to allow the decoder to reset to a known state at the beginning of each frame.
      <br/>
      This allows more rapid reacquisition following channel fade events.
      <br/>
      The modulation scheme and transmission rate for this channel will be the same as for the transmission channel, namely QPSK modulation at a transmission rate of 6750 bps.
      <br/>
      Signaling units within each frame will be coded with a rate 3/4 constraint length K=7 convolutional code.

      The outbound TDM superframe has a duration of 360 ms and is made up of three outbound TDM frames.
      <br/>
      The superframe duration is the basic time interval over which message repetitions are done.
      <br/>
      Repetitions are used to increase the reliability of outbound TDM signaling units.
      <br/>
      Messages can be repeated in consecutive superframes.
      <br/>
      Studies by AUSSAT have shown that L-band fade events typically have durations ranging between 10 ms and 100 ms (2).
      <br/>
      Because the 120 ms frame would not provide adequate separation between message repetitions, the 360 ms superframe is used to reduce the chance of losing two copies of a message during the same L-band fade event.
      <br/>
      This repetition method is similar to that used in the AUSSAT system.
      <br/>
      Different numbers of repetitions may be used for different message types to provide different levels of reliability.
      <br/>
      The number of repetitions used for a particular message type will be a part of the signaling protocols and can be varied by the system operator.
      <br/>
      In addition to message repetitions, interleaving will be used to protect against burst errors.
      <br/>
      The interleaving is provided over a TDM frame and provides improved performance in the presence of short burst errors.

      The bulletin board is a set of signaling unit (SUs) that are periodically transmitted by the MCC on all outbound TDM channels.
      <br/>
      The bulletin board contains global information such as current network status, signaling channel frequencies and inbound random access channel congestion control parameters.
      <br/>
      Every MET processes the information in the bulletin board METs, on startup, and acquires the entire bulletin board before attempting to use the MSS system.
      <br/>
      At least one bulletin board SU is transmitted in every outbound TDM frame.
      <br/>
      Bulletin board SUs are also sent as "filler" SUs, i.e., sent when there are no other SUs pending on the outbound TDM channels.
      <br/>
      Bulletin board SUs do not occupy any fixed position in the outbound TDM frame.

      This number will be incremented by the NCC whenever the information in that page is updated.
      <br/>
      METs are required to build a local data structure that contains the contents of the bulletin board.

      Inbound messages consist of 96 bits before coding and 128 bits after rate 3/4 convolutional coding.
      <br/>
      The resulting burst will occupy 80 ms of the slot, allowing 40 ms of guard time.
    </p>
    <p num="182">
      This guard time arises due to the uncertainty in round trip transmission time between the satellite and a mobile terminal.
      <br/>
      Mobile terminals derive their inbound frame timing (for both the TDMA and random access channels) from the outbound TDM frames.
      <br/>
      Inbound TDMA slots have the same duration as an outbound TDM frame.
      <br/>
      At a MET each TDMA slot boundary occurs at an outbound TDM frame boundary.
      <br/>
      If MET A is nearer to the satellite than MET B, MET A will receive the outbound TDM channel At sooner than MET B, where At corresponds to the difference in propagation times to the satellite for the two terminals.
      <br/>
      As a result, if both METs synchronize their transmit timing to their reception of the outbound TDM channel, MET B's responses to messages will take 2 DELTA t longer to reach the satellite than MET A's responses.
      <br/>
      As additional guard time of 1 symbol time also must be included to account for the  +- 1/2 symbol synchronization uncertainty in the MET.
      <br/>
      This results in a total guard time requirement of 2 DELTA t+1 symbol time.
    </p>
    <p num="183">
      TDMA scheduling is done using a fixed relationship between outbound TDM channel time slots and inbound TDMA channels and slots.
      <br/>
      The response to a message received in the nth slot of the outbound TDM frame is transmitted on the nth TDMA channel assigned to that outbound TDM channel.
      <br/>
      The frequencies of the assigned inbound TDMA channels are contained in one of the bulletin board signaling units periodically transmitted in the outbound TDM channel.
      <br/>
      The response to an outbound message is transmitted in the TDMA time slot that begins 120 ms after the end of the TDM frame in which the outbound message was received.
      <br/>
      This should provide adequate time for message processing in the MET.
    </p>
    <p num="184">
      The inbound random access channel is used by the METs to transmit call requests to the GC.
      <br/>
      It is also used to carry other inbound messages for MET originated actions.
      <br/>
      The number of inbound random access channels assigned to a particular control group in a particular L-band beam depends on the traffic supported by that control group in that beam and is selectable by the network operator.
      <br/>
      To provide reasonable call setup times and call loss probabilities these channels are typically be operated at a throughput of approximately 25% or less.
      <br/>
      As the random access channel is operating at a relatively low efficiency, one of the prime goals in its design is that it be bandwidth efficient.
    </p>
    <p num="185">
      The frequencies used for the random access channels are transmitted in the bulletin board signal units.
      <br/>
      For each transmission, METs choose at random among the inbound signaling channels assigned to their control group.
      <br/>
      After transmitting a message, the MET waits a given amount of time for a response.
      <br/>
      If no response is received within this amount of time, the MET retransmits in a slot selected at random over some given number of slots.
      <br/>
      This procedure is repeated until either a response is received or a maximum number of transmissions is reached.
      <br/>
      The bursts on the random access channel are identical to those on the TDMA channel (i.e., modulation, coding, preamble, etc.).
    </p>
    <p num="186">
      The MET-GC Signaling Protocol (MGSP) procedures send signaling units between GCs and METs via the GC-S, MET-ST and MET-SR channels.
      <br/>
      This protocol encapsulates functions such as channel selection, channel access, slot timing, error recovery and congestion control.
      <br/>
      Higher layer functions, such as call processing, use the protocol for communicating among themselves between the METs and GCs.
    </p>
    <p num="187">
      The relationship of MGSP to other signaling layers in the GC and the MET is shown in FIG. 22. A transaction consists of a command message that is sent from an originating application to a destination application, to which the destination application replies with a response message.
      <br/>
      Each command and response consists of a signaling unit.
      <br/>
      The MGSP performs functions such as channel selection, error recovery using retransmission, and repetition of SUs to improve channel reliability.
      <br/>
      The MGSP at a MET also implements congestion control procedures for the MET-SR channels.
      <br/>
      Only one outstanding transaction exists between a MET and a GC in a given direction.
      <br/>
      However, two simultaneous transactions, one in each direction, are supported between a GC and a MET.
      <br/>
      MGSP also provides a only-way message service, that does not require a response from the receiver.
    </p>
    <p num="188">
      The improved call setup protocol used to establish a MET originated voice call is shown in FIG. 23. When a MET user initiates a call, the MET formats and transmits an access request message via a random access channel.
      <br/>
      This message includes the call type and the destination phone number.
      <br/>
      The group controller chooses an FES to handle the call and sends frequency assignments to the MET via the TDM channel and to the FES via the interstation signaling channel.
      <br/>
      The FES frequency assignment also includes the call type, the destination phone number to allow the FES to complete the call, and an access security check field used to verify the METs identity.
      <br/>
      The access security check field is generated by the group controller using the MET frequency assignment and the MET key which is known only to the MET and the group controller.
    </p>
    <p num="189">
      After the MET receives the frequency assignment, it transmits a scrambling vector message to the FES.
      <br/>
      This message contains the initial vector to be preloaded into the FES scrambler at the beginning of each voice channel frame.
      <br/>
      Letting the MET randomly pick this vector provides some degree of privacy on the Ku to L-band link.
      <br/>
      The scrambling vector message also contains an access security check field generated by the MET using its frequency assignment and its key.
      <br/>
      The FES compares this field with that received from the group controller to verify the identity of the MET.
      <br/>
      After receiving the scrambling vector message, the FES and the MET switch from call setup mode to voice frame mode and the FES completes the call to the terrestrial network user.
    </p>
    <p num="190">
      The improved protocol used for PSTN originated calls is shown in FIG. 24. When a call from a terrestrial network user arrives at an FES, the FES makes a channel request using interstation signaling.
      <br/>
      This request contains the phone number received from the terrestrial network user.
      <br/>
      The group controller determines the MET identity based on the phone number and transmits a call announcement via the TDM channel.
      <br/>
      The MET acknowledges this announcement via the TDMA channel.
      <br/>
      This exchange allows the group controller to verify that the MET is available before assigning bandwidth to the call.
      <br/>
      Frequency assignments are then made and the scrambling vector is transmitted by the MET.
      <br/>
      The call is then completed to the MET user.
    </p>
    <p num="191">
      MET to MET calls are set up using a double hop connection through an FES.
      <br/>
      These calls are set up by the group controller and the FES as a MET to PSTN call setup concatenated with a PSTN to MET call setup.
      <br/>
      As a result the METs require no additional call processing for MET to MET calls.

      Advantageously, the mobile satellite communication system includes a network engineering and systems engineering (NE/SE) support tool.
      <br/>
      The NE/SE system is used to support the activities of the communications engineering organization.
      <br/>
      This system enables the engineering organization to administer, provision and configure the Communications Ground Segment (CGS) systems resources to reflect communication service offerings.
      <br/>
      It also provides Mobile Satellite Service (MSS) management with a high-level view of the CGS network from both a configuration and performance perspective.

    <p num="194">
      FIG. 25 illustrates the NE/SE interfaces to CGS components and external organizations.
      <br/>
      The NE/SE system allows engineering to interface with internal business entities such as the Marketing organization for the exchange of forecast and capacity data, and the CMIS organization in support of customer registration.
      <br/>
      It also supports ability to communicate with the commercially available Bulletin Board Services (BBS) such as Cibernet On-line Roaming Database (CORD), North American Cellular Network (NACN), and other Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) agencies via Electronic Mail (E-Mail).
      <br/>
      The NE/SE system supports the organization's ability to define the configuration of the CGS network in support of the Mobile Satellite (MSAT) systems operation.
      <br/>
      Based on input from marketing and sales organizations, it contrasts expected traffic loads with the capability and availability of space and ground resources.
      <br/>
      NE/SE aids in formulating tactical plans to maximize the available resources of the MSS satellite.
      <br/>
      It allows a network engineer to produce frequency plans for different geographical regions and to define circuit pools for different groups of Mobile Terminal (MT) users.
      <br/>
      In addition, NE/SE defines contingency plans for failure situations, such as the loss of a satellite or a ground-based equipment outage.
      <br/>
      Engineering activities include configuration of the network, its logical resources and its physical components, including cellular switches.
      <br/>
      As a part of the configuration activity, NE/SE performs consistency checks on the data sent to Customer Management Information Systems (CMIS) and CGS.
      <br/>
      It is also responsible for configuring the communication paths to external Organizations (EO).
      <br/>
      The software configurations that are necessary to expand capacity to meet increases in traffic demand, while also supporting new features and services that become available to subscribers.
      <br/>
      It also tracks the logistics of network additions via generation of work orders.

      The server will contain all NE/SE development files in shadowed disk partitions, the Oracle database server software, the NE/SE database, and the COTS development software.
      <br/>
      The two Sparcstation 5s are connected by LAN to the primary server.
      <br/>
      The internal disks of the Sparcstation 5s are used for the operating system kernel and as a swap area for virtual memory; otherwise, each Sparcstation 5 relies on its connection to the primary server for all other disk-based files and services.

    <p num="198">
      The NE/SE system architecture is implemented as a set of client-server applications distributed across multiple processors that are interconnected via an Ethernet Local Area Network (LAN).
      <br/>
      Typically, the client workstations (Sun SparcStation 5 workstations) handle the user interface processing for the NE/SE system, while database access and NOC communication processes are located on the server workstation, a Sun SparcStation 20.
      <br/>
      For the purposes of the following architecture description, processes are divided between "client" processes and the "server" processes.

      Each process maps to the MLCSC most closely associated with it--note that not every MLCSC has a process associated with it.
      <br/>
      Those MLCSCs that do not map to a UNIX process are considered function code libraries and are compiled into the set of UNIX processes to the extent needed.

      The CGS Configuration function configures the CGS network, the logical resources of the network, and the physical components of the network by creating and making available this configuration data in the configuration database.
      <br/>
      Once provisioned, a set of configuration data can be verified against user defined "configuration rules, then deployed to the NOC for distribution.
      <br/>
      The Reconcile Data function is then called to maintain consistency between the NOC database and the NE/SE database.

    <p num="226">Logical Resource Configuration</p>
    <p num="227">
      The Logical Resource Configuration function is broken down into two activities: administration task which is concerned with creating and making a particular resource available and provisioning task which defines the behavior of a resource.
      <br/>
      The major traffic bearing service elements of CGS (satellites, beams, and control groups) are partitioned into resources such as circuit pools, virtual networks and frequency plans.
      <br/>
      The Logical Resource Configuration function, administers and provisions the above resources by performing the following tasks:
      <br/>
      Assigning identifiers or key values during resource creation
      <br/>
      Asserting attribute values to establish the behavior of the resource
      <br/>
      Updating a local version of the CGS configuration database.
    </p>
    <p num="228">An updated CGS configuration database, stored within the NE/SE system, is implemented by instructing the NOC to update the configuration of the affected service elements.</p>

      The NE/SE system administers and provisions a set of service offerings called Service Profiles which associate attribute values for various service elements with Virtual Network (VN) dialing plans (e.g., NCC information, GWS default parameters, etc . . . ) This is done by:
      <br/>
      Creating a Service Profile via operator input;
      <br/>
      Instructing the NOC to configure affected service elements
      <br/>
      Making the new profile available to CMIS for assignment.

      Each individual resource configuration requirement contains a Provisioning Criteria Table (PCT) that defines the manner in which the resource's attribute values are set.
      <br/>
      The NE/SE creates an interim instance of a resource that is provisioned and which can then be committed to the working configuration.
      <br/>
      The PCT contains column headings defined as follows:
    </p>
    <p num="362">
      Attribute Name of an attribute of the resource.
      <br/>
      An asterisk ("*") next to an attribute name indicates that the attribute is a key for the resource in the NOC database.
      <br/>
      A number sign ("-") next to an attribute name indicates that the attribute is a suggested key for a resource that is only managed by the NE/SE.
    </p>
    <p num="363">Generation Defines how the value of the attribute is generated for each new instance of the resource; a resource's PCT entry for Generation will be either Manual or Automatic.</p>
    <p num="364">Modify Indicates whether the attribute value may be modified once the resource is committed to the working configuration; a resource's PCT entry for Modify will be either Yes or No.</p>
    <p num="365">Selection Indicates the manner in which the entry of the attribute's value is performed by the engineer; a resource attribute's PCT entry of Selection will be either Range, test, or Choice, unless the attribute's Modify field is No, in which case Selection will be n/a.</p>
    <p num="366">Significantly, the NE/SE systems includes the following rule based processes for provisioning specific resources pertaining thereto.</p>
    <p num="367">
      1. When a new interim resource is created, the NE/SE provides a default value to each attribute whose PCT Generation field is "Manual".
      <br/>
      The default value of an attribute is either Last Used or the Template Value.
      <br/>
      Last Used indicates that the default value of an attribute is the last value of the attribute committed to the working configuration.
      <br/>
      Template Value indicates that the default value of the attribute is defined for the attribute in a template of attribute defaults.
    </p>
    <p num="368">
      2. The NE/SE allows the engineer to specify whether a new interim resource's attributes default to Last Used or Template Value.
      <br/>
      The NE/SE engineer has the capability of switching between Last Used and Template Value at any time during resource provisioning.
      <br/>
      Until an attribute's value is committed (when its owner resource is committed), the attribute defaults to Template Value, even if the engineer specifies Last Used.
    </p>
    <p num="369">3. The NE/SE indicates to the engineer an attribute's default value when an interim resource is created for the attribute's resource. (To further clarify; this requirement indicates that if attributes are entered via a data entry screen, the data fields for each attribute on the screen contain a default value when a new interim resource's screen is first displayed.)</p>
    <p num="370">
      4. The NE/SE provides a means for the engineer to load attribute default templates.
      <br/>
      The NE/SE provides a means for the engineer to copy and modify existing attribute default templates.
    </p>
    <p num="371">
      5. The NE/SE provides a baseline attribute default template which is loaded at NE/SE startup.
      <br/>
      It is desirable to restrict write access to this baseline template to engineers with special access privilege.
    </p>
    <p num="372">
      6. When a new interim resource is created, the NE/SE automatically generates a value for each resource whose PCT Generation field is "Automatic".
      <br/>
      An attribute value that is automatically generated adheres to the value constraints contained in both the Attribute Dictionary (AD) and the PCT for the attribute.
    </p>
    <p num="373">7. When the NE/SE automatically generates an attribute value for a new interim resource, the attribute value is the smallest valid attribute value that is not currently in use in the working configuration, as constrained by the attribute's PCT Additional Constraints entry and the attribute's AD entry, unless this requirement is explicitly superseded by a resource's requirements.</p>
    <p num="374">8. When the NE/SE automatically generates an attribute value for a new interim resource, the attribute value meets any further constraints imposed upon the attribute value by the resource's requirements.</p>
    <p num="375">
      9. The NE/SE does not permit modification of the attribute value of a committed resource if the attribute's PCT Modify field contains "No".
      <br/>
      An attribute in a newly-created interim resource whose PCT Modify field contains "No" may be modified before the resource is committed for the first time.
    </p>
    <p num="376">
      10. The NE/SE permits modification of the attribute value of a committed resource if the attribute's PCT Modify field contains "Yes".
      <br/>
      Any modification of a committed resource's attributes adheres to the resource's constraints, and shall not be considered part of the working configuration until the changes to the resource are committed to the working configuration.
    </p>
    <p num="377">
      11. The NE/SE displays a textual list of choices instead of (or in addition to) a range of numeric values for any attribute whose Value Constraints field in the AD contains quoted text associated with discrete integer values.
      <br/>
      For example, a cpType prompt should present to the user a list of the choices "Demand Period--Free Pool", "Demand Period--Reserved Pool", and "Full Period", not only the range or list of the values 0, 1, and 2 which correspond to these choices.
    </p>
    <p num="378">
      12. The NE/SE commits an interim resource to the working configuration by explicit command.
      <br/>
      This is separate from the action of creating the resource.
      <br/>
      The NE/SE allows an interim resource to be committed to the working configuration only if each attribute in the interim resource meets the constraints defined for that resource and its attributes.
    </p>
    <p num="379">
      13. The NE/SE satisfies all dependency relationships between resources in a working configuration when adding, modifying, or deleting resources.
      <br/>
      A parent resource is deleted if it has children resources only after requesting confirmation from the engineer.
      <br/>
      A resource is not deleted if another resource has foreign keys that associated with the resource to be deleted, except as described above.
    </p>
    <p num="380">
      14. The NE/SE maintains a template of component constraints for all attributes.
      <br/>
      It is required that the NE/SE permit modification of component constraint templates only by an individual with proper privileges.
    </p>
    <p num="381">
      15. For those attributes whose Resolution field in the AD contains an entry, the NE/SE prompts the engineer for the attribute value in the resolution units of the attribute, or in a scalar variation of the resolution units.
      <br/>
      For example, consider an attribute which has an AD Value Constraint entry of "1,000,000 thru 60,000,000" and a Resolution entry of "100 nsecs" (100 nanoseconds).
      <br/>
      Rather than request that the engineer provide an attribute value in 1,000,000 to 60,000,000 100 nanosecond units, the NE/SE may request a float value of 0.1 seconds to 6.0 seconds, or an integer value of 100 milliseconds to 6000 milliseconds, however, the attribute's value is entered, it is ultimately converted to a value in the range 1,000,000 to 60,000,000 before being downloaded to the NOC.
    </p>
    <p num="382">
      16. The NE/SE provides an indication of the value constraints and (for those attributes whose Resolution field in the AD contain an entry) the resolution of an attribute.
      <br/>
      For example, the AD shows that the tml attribute has a resolution of 0.5 seconds and a value constraint (expressed in terms of the range of values that can be sent to the NOC) of 0 thru 15.
      <br/>
      The NE/SE indicates to the engineer that tml may be entered as a value from 0.0 to 7.5 seconds in discrete 0.5 second increments. (For an attribute with such a relatively small number of discrete values in the range, a menu listing all possible values would be acceptable).
      <br/>
      The value entered is converted to a value of 0 to 15 before it is downloaded to the NOC.
    </p>
    <p num="383">17. The NE/SE permits an attribute's value to be entered only via selection from a list of explicit choices if the attribute's Selection entry in the PCT is "Choice".</p>
    <p num="384">
      18. The NE/SE permits the engineer to enter ASCH text for attributes whose Selection entry in the PCT is "Text".
      <br/>
      The maximum length of the text field that may be entered by the engineer for a given attribute shall be the length of the character array defined for the attribute in the AD, less one character for a terminating NULL (ASCH value 0), which must terminate all text entries sent to the NOC.
    </p>
    <p num="385">
      19. The NE/SE indicates to the engineer the permitted range of values for an attribute whose Selection entry in the PCT is "Range".
      <br/>
      A PCT Selection entry of Range is not precluded entry of the attribute's value from a list of choices.
    </p>
    <p num="386">
      20. When an attribute's Additional Constraint PCT entry has the form "Select from R resources" (where R names a resource), the NE/SE provides the capability for the engineer to specify the attribute's value by selecting from the list of the attribute's values defined in the R-type resources already committed to the working configuration.
      <br/>
      For example, the Antenna resource's rfelD additional Constraint states "Select from RFE resources"; this indicates that the value of rfelD in the Antenna resource is selected from the list defined by the values of rfelD in all of the RFE resources currently committed to the working configuration.
    </p>
    <p num="387">21. When an attribute's Additional Constraint PCT entry has the form "not used when A=v" (where A names another attribute and v is a value of attribute A), the NE/SE does not require the engineer to enter a value for the attribute if the condition A=v exists in the interim resource.</p>
    <p num="388">23. When an attribute's value is not required to be supplied by the engineer, the NE/SE supplies a valid value for the attribute when the attribute's resource data is sent to the NOC if the NOC requires that the attribute value be provided in the message.</p>

    <p num="492">The following is a list of some of the basic commands used in the NE/SE system:</p>
    <p num="493">Configuration Manager</p>
    <p num="494">Function: Allow the operator to perform system configuration and provisioning tasks</p>
    <p num="495">Work Order Generation</p>
    <p num="496">Function: Automatically generate necessary work orders in order to bring the NOC configuration into agreement with the configuration loaded in the application.</p>
    <p num="497">Provisioning</p>
    <p num="498">
      Function: Allows operator to configure system by creating instances of the system entities and provisioning those instances.
      <br/>
      The configuration state is represented by a directed graph consisting of entity icons at the nodes connected with directed line segments.
      <br/>
      The line segments represent the parent-child relationship between entities with the line pointing from the parent to the child.
      <br/>
      The number appearing in the upper right of the entity icon represents the number of instances of the entity.
      <br/>
      The number appearing in the lower right corner represents the number of instances for the currently selected parent instance(s).
      <br/>
      The number appearing in the lower left represents the instance currently selected.
      <br/>
      Instances of a child are relative to the currently selected instance of its parent.
      <br/>
      For example, there may be three instances of a child entity for instance one of its parent and two instances of the child for instance two of the parent.
      <br/>
      This relationship holds true for combinations of multiple parents.
      <br/>
      A configuration is provisioned by working through the graph from top to bottom.
      <br/>
      At least one instance of each parent must exist and be selected before an instance of a child can be created and provisioned.
      <br/>
      To select an entity, the operator will activate the icon.
      <br/>
      Upon activation, a Dialog box will be displayed.
      <br/>
      The currently selected instance will be highlighted in the List.
      <br/>
      The operator will select the desired instance and then activate the PushButton for the desired action.
      <br/>
      If the Select PushButton is activated, the selected instance will be made the current instance.
      <br/>
      A sample provisioning screen is illustrated in FIG. 52.
    </p>
    <p num="499">Retrieve NOC Configuration State</p>
    <p num="500">Function: Retrieves the configuration database currently in use by the NOC.</p>
    <p num="501">Deploy Restoral Plan</p>
    <p num="502">
      Function: Retrieve the name of a restoral plan to be deployed and then deploy it.
      <br/>
      A SelectionDialog was selected so that the restoral plan file names could be presented without permitting the operator to move to other directories as would be the case with a FileSelectionDialog.
      <br/>
      The system will check that the restoral plan name selected is actually a restoral plan in the proper directory prior to deploying it.
    </p>
    <p num="503">Communications</p>
    <p num="504">Function: Start NE/SE communication applications</p>
    <p num="505">Remote NOC Session</p>
    <p num="506">
      Function: Provide the operator with network management capabilities.
      <br/>
      Activation of Remote NOC Session PushButton will execute a script which will log into the proper host, start Polycenter, and redirect its X Windows displays back to the NE/SE workstation
    </p>
    <p num="507">GWS MAP Session</p>
    <p num="508">
      Function: Provide operator access to the MAP display on the switches.
      <br/>
      When the GWS MAP Session is activated, a SelectionDialog will be displayed with the available switches listed.
      <br/>
      Once the is operator selects the desired switch, a script will be executed to start the XTerm session and establish the connection to that switch.
    </p>
    <p num="509">AMS(R)S Simulation</p>
    <p num="510">Function: Allows NE/SE operator to send and receive AMS(R)S messages</p>
    <p num="511">Establish AMS(R)S Links</p>
    <p num="512">
      Function: Causes simulation to attempt establish AMS(R)S connections to NOC when activated.
      <br/>
      Component is disabled when the simulation has already established connections with the NOC.
      <br/>
      If the operator activates this component and it is found that the AMS(R)S has already connected to the NOC, an InformationDialog will be presented advising the operator of the previous connection and the simulation will discontinue its connection attempt.
    </p>
    <p num="513">CGS Events Display</p>
    <p num="514">Function: Display incoming CGS events in a window</p>
    <p num="515">NE/SE Messages Display</p>
