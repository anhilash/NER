      <br/>
      A first blade for scaling the fish is fixedly mounted on the top wall of the housing.
      <br/>
      The first blade is located generally adjacent to the second end the housing.
      <br/>
      A second blade for scaling the fish is fixedly mounted to the bottom surface of the platform.

    <p num="1">
      1.
      <br/>
      Field of the Invention
    </p>
    <p num="2">The present invention relates to fish scaling devices and more particularly pertains to a new automated fish scaling apparatus for scaling fish on a conveyor belt.</p>
    <p num="3">2. Description of the Prior Art</p>
    <p num="4">
      The use of fish scaling devices is known in the prior art.
      <br/>
      More specifically, fish scaling devices heretofore devised and utilized are known to consist basically of familiar, expected and obvious structural configurations, notwithstanding the myriad of designs encompassed by the crowded prior art which have been developed for the fulfillment of countless objectives and requirements.
    </p>
    <p num="5">Known prior art includes U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,318,472; 5,129,855; 2,279,685; 4,839,942; 1,982,084; and U.S. Des. Pat. No. 366,594.</p>
    <p num="6">
      While these devices fulfill their respective, particular objectives and requirements, the aforementioned patents do not a housing having a top wall, a first end and second end.
      <br/>
      A platform. having a bottom surface, a first end and a second end, is hingedly connected to the second end of the housing.
      <br/>
      A first continuous belt is adapted to carry a fish along a length of the top wall of the housing.
      <br/>
      A second continuous belt adapted to guide fish is rotatably coupled to a bottom surface of the platform.
      <br/>
      A first motor rotates the first continuous belt.
      <br/>
      A first blade for scaling the fish is fixedly mounted on the top wall of the housing.
      <br/>
      The first blade is located generally adjacent to the second end the housing.
      <br/>
      A second blade for scaling the fish is fixedly mounted to the bottom surface of the platform.
      <br/>
      The second blade is located generally adjacent to the second end of the platform.
    </p>
    <p num="7">In these respects, the automated fish scaling apparatus according to the present invention substantially departs from the conventional concepts and designs of the prior art, and in so doing provides an apparatus primarily developed for the purpose of scaling fish on a conveyor belt.</p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="8">In view of the foregoing disadvantages inherent in the known types of fish scaling devices now present in the prior art, the present invention provides a new automated fish scaling apparatus construction wherein the same can be utilized for scaling fish on a conveyor belt.</p>
    <p num="9">The general purpose of the present invention, which will be described subsequently in greater detail, is to provide a new automated fish scaling apparatus apparatus and method which has many of the advantages of the fish scaling devices mentioned heretofore and many novel features that result in a new automated fish scaling apparatus which is not anticipated, rendered obvious, suggested, or even implied by any of the prior art fish scaling devices, either alone or in any combination thereof.</p>
    <p num="10">
      To attain this, the present invention generally comprises a housing having a top wall, a first end and second end.
      <br/>
      A platform. having a bottom surface, a first end and a second end, is hingedly connected to the second end of the housing.
      <br/>
      A first continuous belt is adapted to carry a fish along a length of the top wall of the housing.
      <br/>
      A second continuous belt adapted to guide fish is rotatably coupled to a bottom surface of the platform.
      <br/>
      A first motor rotates the first continuous belt.
      <br/>
      A first blade for scaling the fish is fixedly mounted on the top wall of the housing.
      <br/>
      The first blade is located generally adjacent to the second end the housing.
      <br/>
      A second blade for scaling the fish is fixedly mounted to the bottom surface of the platform.
      <br/>
      The second blade is located generally adjacent to the second end of the platform.
    </p>
    <p num="11">
      There has thus been outlined, rather broadly, the more important features of the invention in order that the detailed description thereof that follows may be better understood, and in order that the present contribution to the art may be better appreciated.
      <br/>
      There are additional features of the invention that will be described hereinafter and which will form the subject matter of the claims appended hereto.
    </p>
    <p num="12">
      In this respect, before explaining at least one embodiment of the invention in detail, it is to be understood that the invention is not limited in its application to the details of construction and to the arrangements of the components set forth in the following description or illustrated in the drawings.
      <br/>
      The invention is capable of other embodiments and of being practiced and carried out in various ways.
      <br/>
      Also, it is to be understood that the phraseology and terminology employed herein are for the purpose of description and should not be regarded as limiting.
    </p>
    <p num="13">
      As such, those skilled in the art will appreciate that the conception, upon which this disclosure is based, may readily be utilized as a basis for the designing of other structures, methods and systems for carrying out the several purposes of the present invention.
      <br/>
      It is important, therefore, that the claims be regarded as including such equivalent constructions insofar as they do not depart from the spirit and scope of the present invention.
    </p>
    <p num="14">
      Further, the purpose of the foregoing abstract is to enable the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office and the public generally, and especially the scientists, engineers and practitioners in the art who are not familiar with patent or legal terms or phraseology, to determine quickly from a cursory inspection the nature and essence of the technical disclosure of the application.
      <br/>
      The abstract is neither intended to define the invention of the application, which is measured by the claims, nor is it intended to be limiting as to the scope of the invention in any way.
    </p>
    <p num="15">It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a new automated fish scaling apparatus apparatus and method which has many of the advantages of the fish scaling devices mentioned heretofore and many novel features that result in a new automated fish scaling apparatus which is not anticipated, rendered obvious, suggested, or even implied by any of the prior art fish scaling devices, either alone or in any combination thereof.</p>
    <p num="16">It is another object of the present invention to provide a new automated fish scaling apparatus which may be easily and efficiently manufactured and marketed.</p>
