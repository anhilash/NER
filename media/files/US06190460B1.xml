      Field of the Invention
    </p>
    <p num="3">The present invention relates to an apparatus for a low pressure chemical vapor deposition, and particularly to an improved apparatus for a low pressure chemical vapor deposition capable of achieving a fabrication of various kinds of thin films having a uniform thickness, preventing breakages of the palts, achieving automation of the system, and combining the use of a low pressure chemical vapor deposition apparatus and a plasma low pressure chemical vapor deposition apparatus.</p>
    <p num="4">2. Description of the Conventional Art</p>
    <p num="5">As well known to those skilled ill the art, the low pressure chemical vapor deposition (hereinafter called an "LPCVD") technique has been widely used so as to deposit nitride layers, oxide layers, silicon layers, and the like on a wafer having insulating, dielectric or conductive characteristics.</p>
    <p num="6">
      The deposition apparatus adopted in the LPCVD is directed to depositing a compound-made thin film on a wafer by reacting a chemical source gas in a reactor under a low pressure.
      <br/>
      This apparatus includes a single wafer input low pressure chemical vapor deposition device for depositing while loading wafer one by one and a vertical type low pressure chemical vapor deposition device for depositing in a state that a plurality of wafers are loaded.
      <br/>
      In addition, the single wafer input low pressure chemical vapor deposition apparatus has advantages in that it is easy to make the system automated and does not require wide foot point.
    </p>
    <p num="7">Hereinafter, only the single wafer input low pressure chemical vapor deposition apparatus of the conventional low pressure chemical vapor deposition apparatuses will now be explained.</p>
    <p num="8">FIG. 1 shows a conventional single wafer input low pressure chemical vapor deposition apparatus, which includes a deposition base 11 having a wafer inlet 11a and an outlet 11b for discharging reaction substances and opened/closed by an opening/closing plate 11c, a reactor 12 disposed above the deposition base 11 for forming a reaction space "S", a chemical source gas introducer 13 disposed on the upper portion of the reactor 12, and a substrate 14 which is lifted/lowered within the reaction space "S" by a lifting/lowering ram 15 passing through the opening/closing plate 11c.</p>
    <p num="9">The above-mentioned conventional single wafer input low pressure chemical vapor deposition apparatus is directed to placing a wafer "W" on the susceptor 14 by introducing the wafer "W" through the wafer inlet 11a in a state that the susceptor 14 is lowered down to a loading/unloading position lower than the wafer inlet 11a, and lifting the susceptor 14 using the lifting/lowering ram 15, driving a susceptor heating member 16 disposed at the susceptor 14, and introducing chemical source gas into the reactor 12 through a chemical source gas introducer 13, whereby the chemical source gas is deposited on the wafer "W" so as to form a compound thin film.</p>
    <p num="10">
      However, the conventional single wafer input low pressure chemical vapor deposition apparatus has disadvantages in that when heat is applied to the susceptor 14 having a wafer "W", since the heat is not applied to the reactor 12 and its periphery, the thermal effect is deteriorated.
      <br/>
      Due to the above-mentioned thermal effect, the pin hole is caused at the thin film, and die step coverage is decreased.
    </p>
    <p num="11">In addition, because the conventional single wafer input low pressure chemical vapor deposition apparatus provides the chemical source gas introducer 13, connected to a lower portion of the introduction tube 13a passing through the upper surface of the reactor 12, and a shower head 13b having a plurality of shower apertures so as to simply eject chemical source gas, so that a desired compound mixing cannot be achieved, whereby non-uniform layer can be deposited on the entire wafer surface.</p>
    <p num="12">Moreover, in order to overcome the above-mentioned problems, the plasma enhanced low pressure chemical vapor deposition apparatus, which is characterized to reacting the chemical source gas by generating plasma by connecting a plasma generator to the substrate and the electrode of the reactor, was introduced.</p>
    <p num="13">As shown in FIG. 2, the conventional plasma low pressure chemical vapor deposition apparatus includes a deposition base 21 having an inlet 21a formed at one side thereof and an outlet 21b formed at the other side thereof, wherein the lower portion thereof is opened/closed by an opening/closing plate 21c, a reactor 22 disposed at an upper portion of the deposition base 21, a chemical source gas introducer 23 disposed at the upper surface of the reactor 22, a susceptor 24 on which a wafer "W", which can be lifted/lowered within the reactor 22 by a lifting/lowering ram 25 through the opening/closing plate 21c, is mounted, a susceptor heating member 26 disposed at the susceptor 24, and a plasma generator 27 disposed at the reactor 22 and the susceptor 24 and connected to electrodes 27a and 27b.</p>
    <p num="14">The above-mentioned conventional plasma low pressure chemical vapor deposition apparatus is directed to depositing a compound thin film on a wafer "W" by lowering the lifting/lowering ram 25 through the opening/closing plate 21c and the susceptor 24 down to a loading/unloading position lower than the inlet 21a, by mounting the wafer "W" on the susceptor 24 through the inlet 21a, and by generating plasma in the reactor 22 by driving the plasma generator 27 connected to the electrodes 27a and 27b mounted on an upper portion of the reactor 22 and the susceptor while introducing the chemical source gas into the reactor 22 through the chemical source gas introducer 23 and while heating the susceptor and the wafer "W" by driving the susceptor heating member 26 after lifting the susceptor 24 with the wafer "W" up to the deposition position.</p>
    <p num="15">
      Tile above-mentioned plasma low pressure chemical vapor deposition apparatus has advantages in that it can minimize a characteristic variation of a device due to a deposition temperature by maintaining the process temperature at a low temperature by ionizing the chemical source gas by generating plasma.
      <br/>
      However, it has disadvantages in that the heat effect is deteriorated because the chemical source gas is introduced into a reaction space "S" in a state that the chemical source gas is not substantially heated since only the susceptor 24, on which the wafer "W" is mounted, is heated, and its periphery is not substantially heated.
      <br/>
      In addition, pin hole can occur at the thin film due to the above-mentioned lower heat effect, and the step coverage is deteriorated.
    </p>
    <p num="16">Moreover, because the chemical source gas introducer 23 is simply connected to the introduction tube 23a passing through an upper portion of the reactor 22 and a lower portion of the introduction tube 23a and includes a shower head 23b having a plurality of shower apertures, so that substantial pre-heating and mixing of the introducing chemical source gas are not performed and the wafer "W" which is loaded on the susceptor 24 cannot have substantial flooded by the chemical source gas, the uniformity level of the compound thin film is lowered.</p>
    <p num="17">In addition, since the wafer "W" mounted on the susceptor is directly exposed to the lower portion of the shower head, the wafer "W" is not substantially exposed with respect to the chemical source gas, so that the uniformity level of the thin film is lowered.</p>
    <p num="18">Moreover, since the waste gas in the chemical reaction is exhausted from the outlet, and the gas in the reactor cannot be exhausted at a desired speed, the remaining gas affects the quality of the thin film.</p>
    <p num="19">Referring to FIGS. 1 and 2, since the conventional low pressure chemical vapor deposition apparatus and the conventional plasma low pressure chemical vapor deposition apparatus provide the substrates 14 and 24 which are connected to an upper portion of the lifting/lowering rams 15 and 25 lifted/lowered within a range between the loading/unloading position and the deposition position, the desired precise loading/unloading cannot be achieved, disadvantageously affecting automation of the system.</p>
    <p num="20">In addition, referring to FIG. 4, the substrates 14 and 24 in the conventional low pressure chemical vapor deposition apparatus and the plasma low pressure chemical vapor deposition apparatus include the wafer placement sections 14b and 24b, on which the wafer "W" is mounted, being higher than the bodies 14a and 24a having the susceptor heating member, and wafer supporting protrusions 14c and 24c provided at a periphery of the wafer placement sections 14b and 24b, so that the wafer "W" is stably placed on the wafer placement sections 14b and 24b in the support protrusions 14c and 24c.</p>
    <p num="21">
      However, conventionally, the wafer "W" having a flat zone "F" is circular and is mounted on the susceptor 14 and 24 through the wafer inlets 11aand 12a using a robot hand "R".
      <br/>
      Here, since the fork-shaped robot hand "R" interferes with the wafer placement sections 14b and 24b during a certain operation mode, part of the both inner sides of the wafer placements 14b and 24b are cut away to be straight line sections 14d and 24d, so that the robot hand "R" freely operates between the straight line sections 14d and 24d.
      <br/>
      In addition, the width between the straight line sections 14d and 24dis smaller than the width between the inner sides of the fork of the robot arm "R".
    </p>
    <p num="22">
      In the above-mentioned construction, when lowering the robot hand "R" after moving the robot hand "R" to a position precisely mating with the wafer placement sections 14b and 24b, since the robot hand "A" is lowered at the outer side of the straight line sections 14d and 24d of the wafer placement sections 14b and 24b, there is not any interference between the robot hand "A" and the wafer placement sections 14b and 24b, and the wafer "W" is safely placed on the support protrusions 14c and 24c formed at the rim of the wafer placement sections 14b and 24b.
      <br/>
      When unloading the wafer, the operation is executed in the reverse order of the above-mentioned order.
    </p>
    <p num="23">However, referring to FIG. 3, when the wafer "W" is placed on the wafer placement sections 14b and 24b, since the both sides of the wafer "W" do not come into precise contact with the wafer placement sections 14b and 24b, that is, the wafer "W" slightly comes off from the straight line sections 14d and 24d of the wafer placement sections 14b and 24b, the heat of the susceptor heating member in the substrate bodies 14a and 24a is not evenly transferred to the entire surface of the wafer "W", and a desired deposition cannot be executed with respect to the both sides of the wafer "W", and the deposition with respect to the lower surface of the wafer "W" is executed because the chemical source gas is introduced over part of the lower surface of the wafer "W" in a state that the both sides of the wafer "W" is slightly lifted.</p>
    <p num="24">
      In addition, referring FIGS. 4A and 4B, in order to resolve the above-mentioned problems, wafer lifting/lowering pins 17 and 28 (preferably three) which are lifted/lowered in the wafer placement sections 14b and 24b of the susceptor 14 and 24 are provided.
      <br/>
      That is, as shown FIG. 4A, in a state that the wafer lifting/lowering pins 17 and 28 are lifted, the wafer "W" is positioned on the robot hand "A", and as shown in FIG. 4B, the wafer "W" is stably placed on the wafer placement sections 14b and 24b by lowering the lifting/lowering pins 17 and 28 unless the straight line sections of both sides of the wafer placement sections 14b and 24b formed on the susceptor bodies 14a and 24a are not provided.
    </p>
    <p num="25">
      However, in this case, a certain gap is formed between the susceptor bodies 14a and 24a and the wafer lifting/lowering pins 17 and 28 when mounting the wafer lifting/lowering pins 17 and 28.
      <br/>
      The chemical source gas infiltrates through the gap causing particles.
      <br/>
      In addition, it is difficult to precisely dispose the substrate heating member and the electrodes in the substrate bodies 14a and 24a.
      <br/>
      Moreover, the gas infiltrated into the gap affects the susceptor heating member causing heat loss.
      <br/>
      In addition, since the wafer lifting/lowering pins 17 and 28 are made of SUS or quartz, the wafer lifting/lowering pins 17 and 28 can easily broken, and it is difficult to maintain them.
    </p>

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="49">FIG. 5 shows a low pressure chemical vapor deposition apparatus, which includes a deposition base 110 having a wafer inlet 111 for passing the wafer "W" therethrough and an outlet 112 for exhausting reaction substances therethrough, a reactor 120 mounted on an upper portion of the deposition base 110 and having a reaction region "R" therewithin, a chemical source gas introducer 130 connected to an upper portion of the reactor 120 for introducing chemical source gas into the interior of the reactor 120, a susceptor 140 movable between the loading/unloading positions and the deposition position for receiving the wafer "W", a susceptor heating member 150 inserted into the substrate 140 and disposed on the susceptor 140 for heating the wafer "W", and a reactor heating member 160 disposed on an upper portion of the reactor 120 for heating the reactor 120.</p>
    <p num="50">
      The deposition base 110 is mounted on a deposition facility frame (not shown) and has an opening/closing plate 113 disposed at a lower portion of the deposition base 110 for opening/closing the interior of the deposition base 110.
      <br/>
      The opening/closing plate 113 has a lifting/lowering ram 114, and the susceptor 140 is fixed to an upper portion thereof, and a dust cover 115 is provided between the opening/closing plate 113 and the lifting/lowering ram 114 so as to prevent foreign matter or gas from infiltrating into the reactor 120 through a certain gap of the lifting/lowering ram 114.
    </p>
    <p num="51">The lifting/lowering ram 114 is lifted/lowered by a lifting/lowering driving member (not shown) which is of a linearly reciprocating mechanism.</p>
    <p num="52">
      In one aspect of the present invention, the deposition base 110 and the reactor 120 are integrally formed; however, it is not limited to that.
      <br/>
      In another aspect of the present invention, they can be made independently from each other.
      <br/>
      In this regard, tightly engaging the deposition base 110 and the reactor 120 is necessary.
    </p>
    <p num="53">
      The reactor 120 typically adopts quartz, and the upper portion thereof is closed by a sealing member 121.
      <br/>

    <p num="64">Reference numeral 116 denotes a cooling water path.</p>
    <p num="65">The operation of the lower pressure chemical vapor deposition apparatus will now be explained with reference to the accompanying drawings.</p>
    <p num="66">To begin with, the susceptor 140 is lowered down to a loading/unloading position by lowering the lifting/lowering ram 114, and a wafer "W" is placed on the susceptor 140 through the wafer inlet 111 in a state that a certain pressure in maintained in the reactor 120 using a vacuum pump (not shown).</p>
    <p num="67">At this time, the insertion section 142b of the position determination pin 142 fixed to the opening/closing plate 113 in a state that the susceptor 140 is lowered down to the loading/unloading position is inserted into the position determination groove 141 formed on the susceptor 140, and the lower surface of the susceptor 140 is restricted by the engaging jaw 142c of the position determination pin 142, so that the position of the susceptor 140 is precisely determined, thus positioning the wafer "W" on the susceptor 140 using a certain member such as a robot hand.</p>
    <p num="68">In a state that the wafer "W" is placed on the susceptor 140, the susceptor 140 is lifted up to the deposition position by the lifting/lowering ram 114.</p>
    <p num="69">Thereafter, the wafer "W" mounted on the susceptor and the reactor 120 are heated at temperature of 100 through 1,100 (degree)  C. by driving the susceptor heating member 150 and the reactor heating member 160, and the chemical source gas is introduced into the reactor 120 by the chemical source gas introducer 130.</p>
    <p num="70">The chemical source gas introduced into the introduction tube 131 of the chemical source gas introducer 130 is first introduced into the gas pre-heating region "H" which is defined at the uppermost portion of the reactor 120, and is pre-heated by the reactor heating member 160, and the chemical source gas is gushed toward the gas mixing region "M" through the shower aperture 132a of the first shower head 132.</p>
    <p num="71">At this time, since the shower aperture 133a of the second shower head 133 has a certain diameter smaller than that of the shower aperture 132a of the first shower head 132, and the number thereof is greater than that of the shower aperture 132a of the first shower head 132, the chemical source gas introduced into the gas mixing region "M" is substantially mixed therein for a certain time.</p>
    <p num="72">The chemical source gas introduced into the reaction space "R" through the shower aperture 133a of the second shower head 133 is reacted in the reactor 120 which is pre-heated to have a predetermined temperature by the reactor heating member 160 and deposited on the wafer "W" on the susceptor 140 as a compound thin film.</p>
    <p num="73">
      The wafer "W" mounted on the susceptor 140 and the gas mixing region "M" are heated by the susceptor heating member 150 and the reactor heating member 160, and the chemical source gas is introduced into the reaction region "R" in a state that the gas is substantially heated, so that a desired heat effect is achieved.
      <br/>
      In addition, since the chemical source gas is substantially heated through the gas preheating region "H" and the gas mixing region "M" which are defined by the first shower head 132 and the second shower head 133 and introduced thereinto, pin holes, cracks, and step coverage do not occur in the thin film, so that it is possible to obtain a desired better thin film.
    </p>
    <p num="74">When the deposition is completed, reaction substances or remaining gas in the reactor 120 are discharged to the outside through the outlet 112, and the susceptor 140 is lowered down to the loading/unloading position by the lifting/lowering ram 114, and the wafer "W" is unloaded through the wafer inlet 111 using a unloading member such as a robot hand.</p>
    <p num="75">In a state that the susceptor 140 is lowered down to the loading/unloading position, the unloading operation can be more precisely executed in cooperation with the position determination groove 141 of the susceptor 140 and the position determination pin 142 disposed at the opening/closing plate 113.</p>
    <p num="76">In addition, the reaction substances or remaining gas are properly exhausted through the outlet 112 of the deposition base 110.</p>
    <p num="77">Meanwhile, in this embodiment, the gas mixing region "M" and the outlet 112 are connected by a remaining gas exhausting tube 117 having an opening/closing valve 118 disposed at its intermediate position.</p>
    <p num="78">The remaining gas exhausting tube 117 is closed during a deposition process by closing the opening/closing valve 118 so that the chemical source gas introduced into the reactor 120 is not exhausted to the outside through the remaining gas exhausting tube 117 or the foreign matters such as air is not introduced thereinto.</p>
    <p num="79">After the deposition is completed and the wafer "W" is unloaded, the reaction substances and remaining gas in the gas mixing region "M" are exhausted to the outside at a desired speed by opening the opening/closing valve 118, that is, by connecting the gas mixing region "M" and the outlet 112.</p>
    <p num="80">
      Here, since the gas mixing region "M" has a relatively small diameter, it takes some times for the remaining gas in the gas mixing region 133 to be exhausted from the reaction region "R" to the outlet 112 through the shower aperture 133a of the second shower head 133, the thin film deposition may be damaged thereby.
      <br/>
      In order to resolve the above-mentioned problems, this embodiment of the present invention is directed to providing the remaining gas exhausting tube 117 connecting between the gas mixing region "M" and the outlet 112 and to opening the opening/closing valve 118 during a unloading operation, so that the remaining gas in the gas mixing region "M" is fast exhausted to the outside, and thus it is possible to prevent the thin film deposition.
    </p>
    <p num="81">In addition, this embodiment of the present invention is directed to fabricating better thin film by expediting the reaction of the chemical source gas by generating plasma in the reaction region "R" by applying a high frequency voltage to the reactor 120 and the substrate 140.</p>
    <p num="82">
      That is, using the plasma generator 171, a high frequency voltage is applied between the second shower head 133 formed with SiC material and the electrode 172 disposed at the susceptor 140, and plasma is generated therebetween, and the chemical source gas is substantially pre-heated through the first shower head 132 and the second shower head 133, and the a desired reaction can be achieved by the plasma discharge.
      <br/>
      Here, in order to reduce fabricating cost of the product, the second shower head 133 can be used as the electrode, not providing additional electrode to the reactor 120.

      FIG. 15 shows a susceptor of another embodiment according to the present invention.
      <br/>
      That is, the susceptor 540 includes a chemical source gas dispersion plate 544 for evenly introducing the chemical source gas over the entire surface of the wafer "W" mounted on the susceptor 540.

      The threaded bars 547 and 548 includes each three threaded bars and is disposed so as to prevent any interference from the wafer "W" which loaded/unloaded through the wafer inlet 511.
    </p>
    <p num="136">The susceptor 540 is directed to evenly introducing the chemical source gas over the entire surface of the wafer "W" by preventing the chemical source gas from being directly introduced onto the surface of the wafer "W" in a process that the chemical source gas is introduced into the reaction region "R" and from unevenly and partially introducing onto the surface of the wafer "W" by allowing the chemical source gas to cover the surface of the wafer "W" through the gap formed between the wafer "W" on the susceptor 540 and the dispersion plate 544, so that even thickness of a thin film can be achieved.</p>
    <p num="137">In addition, a desired thin film call be achieved by controlling the gap between the upper surface of the susceptor 540 and the dispersion plate 544 in accordance with the conditions of the chemical source gas and the thin film.</p>

    <p num="139">FIG. 16 shows a susceptor of another embodiment adopted in the low pressure chemical vapor deposition apparatus of the present invention, which is directed to achieving a desired loading/unloading operation using a robot hand "A" and receiving the entire surface of the wafer "W".</p>
    <p num="140">That is, the substrate 600 includes a susceptor body 610 having a placement section 611 for substantially receiving the wafer "W" except the part of the circular portion C1 thereof and a wafer holder 620 having an assistant placement section 625 for receiving the remaining circular part of the wafer "W".</p>

    <p num="145">The outer diameter of the wafer holder 620 is the same as the outer diameter of the susceptor body 610, and the width of the cut-away groove is wider than that of the robot hand "A".</p>
    <p num="146">An assistant placement section 625a is formed at the each end of straight line section 625, on which both sides of the circular section C1 of the wafer "W" is placed.</p>
    <p num="147">
      A circular protrusion, in which the outer circumferential surface of the both sides circular section C1 contacts with the inner surface thereof, is formed at a periphery of the assistant placement section 625a.
      <br/>
      The circular protrusion is protruded by about 0.8 mm which is similar to the thickness of the wafer "W".
    </p>
    <p num="148">In addition, the holder lifting/lowering bar 630 is provided so as to lifting/lowering the wafer holder 620.</p>
    <p num="149">The holder lifting/lowering bar 630 includes a plurality of connection bars 631 (preferably three bars) of which the upper end is connected to the outer end of the wafer holder 620, and a lifting/lowering connection bar 634 for fixing the lower ends of the connection bars 631, so that the lifting/lowering connection bars 634 are lifted/lowered by a lifting/lowering member (not shown).</p>
    <p num="150">A plurality of connection plates 632 and 635, which has the same number as the connection bars, are protruded from the outer end of the wafer holder 620, so that the wafer holder 620 and the lifting/lowering bars 634 are integrally connected by fixing the higher and lower ends of the connection bars 631 to the connection plates 632 and 635 using fixing screws 633 and 636.</p>
    <p num="151">Here, since the connection bars 631 are disposed at the rear portion and at both sides of the wafer holder 620, there is not any interference between the connection bars 631 and the wafer "W" while the wafer "W" is loaded or unloaded.</p>
    <p num="152">A ram aperture 637, through which the lifting/lowering ram passes through for lifting/lowering the susceptor, is formed at the central portion of the lifting/lowering connection bar 634, so that there is not any interference between the lifting/lowering ram and the holder lifting/lowering bar 630.</p>
    <p num="153">A screw aperture 638 for engaging the lifting/lowering drive member is formed at a periphery of the ram aperture 637 of the lifting/lowering connection bar 634.</p>
    <p num="154">The lifting/lowering drive member is not limited to its range of use of hydrogen cylinder, pneumatic cylinder, step motor, or linearly lifting/lowering drive device using motorized-screw.</p>
    <p num="155">The operation of loading/unloading the wafer "W" on/from the susceptor 600 of this embodiment according to the present invention will now be explained.</p>
    <p num="156">To begin with, as shown in FIGS. 16 through 18A through 18D, the wafer "W" is moved immediately above the wafer holder 620 by lifting the holder lifting/lowering bars 630 by the lifting/lowering drive member in a state that the lower surface of the wafer holder 620 is spaced apart from the upper surface of the susceptor 610.</p>
    <p num="157">Referring to FIG. 18B, the flat zone "F" of the wafer "W" is mated with the straight line section of the susceptor straight section 613, and the both sides circular section C1 of the wafer "W" is mated with the both sides assistant placement section 625a of the wafer holder 620, and as shown in FIG. 18C, the robot hand "A" is lowered and places the wafer "W" on the assistant placement section 625a of the wafer holder 620.</p>
    <p num="158">At this time, since the width of the robot hand "A" is narrower than the inner width of the cut-away groove 621 of the wafer holder 620, there is not any interference between the robot hand "A" and the wafer holder 620.</p>
    <p num="159">The wafer "W" on the wafer holder 620 is placed on the assistant placement section 625a, and the outer ends of the both sides circular section C1 comes into contact with the circular protrusions 625a.</p>
    <p num="160">Next, when the robot hand "A" comes off from the wafer holder 620, only the wafer "W" is placed on the holder 620.</p>
    <p num="161">When the robot hand "A" comes off from the wafer holder 620, the wafer holder 620 is lowered in accordance with a lowering of the holder lifting/lowering bar 630 which is lowered by the lifting/lowering drive member, so that as shown in FIG. 18D, the wafer is placed on the placement section 611.</p>
    <p num="162">When using the above-mentioned susceptor 600, the heat from the susceptor heating member disposed in the substrate body 610 is directly transferred to the region of the placement surface 612 of the placement section 611, and the heat therefrom is transferred to the region of the assistant placement section 625a of the wafer holder 620 through the wafer holder 620, so that the heat is evenly transferred to the entire surface of the wafer "W".</p>
    <p num="163">Therefore, since the wafer "W" is tightly placed on the susceptor 600, the deposition is evenly conducted over the entire surface of the wafer "W", so that better thin film without particle and cracks can be achieved, and a desired uniformity of the thin film can be also achieved, and the heat loss can be advantageously prevented.</p>
    <p num="164">In addition, since a thin lifting/lowering pin is not used as the conventional art, it is possible to prevent breakages of parts, and the maintenance is easier compared with the prior art.</p>
    <p num="165">Moreover, in a state that the outer end of the circular section C1 of the wafer "W" contact with the placement section and the inner surface of the circular protrusions 615a and 625a formed on the wafer holder 620, since the wafer "W" is placed, the heat efficiency can be increased.</p>
    <p num="166">FIG. 19 shows a susceptor of another embodiment according to the present invention, which is directed to controlling heat transfer efficiency with respect to the wafer "W" in accordance with a kind of thin film to be deposited by providing a wafer holder 602 having an outer diameter smaller than the outer diameter of the substrate body 610.</p>
    <p num="167">In addition, the length of the connection plate 632 connected with the connection bar 631 is longer than that in the previous embodiment since the outer diameter of the wafer holder 620 is smaller than that of the susceptor body 610.</p>
    <p num="168">Since the remaining constructions are the same as the embodiment of FIG. 16 through FIGS. 18A through 18D, the description with respect thereto will be omitted.</p>
    <p num="169">The above-mentioned aspect can be adopted to all the embodiments of the present invention.</p>
    <p num="170">Although the preferred embodiments of the present invention have been disclosed for illustrative purposes, those skilled in the art will appreciate that various modifications, additions and substitutions are possible, without departing from the scope and spirit of the invention as described in the accompanying claims.</p>
