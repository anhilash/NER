    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">
      1.
      <br/>
      Field of the Invention
    </p>
    <p num="3">This invention relates to cosmetics which have a keratin layer softening effect and which provide a good feeling when used, to guanidine derivatives including acid addition salts thereof which have a moisturizing effect, a keratin softening effect, etc. and are useful as components of cosmetic formulations and to a process for the production thereof.</p>
    <p num="4">2. Discussion of the Background</p>
    <p num="5">
      The keratin layer, the outermost layer of the skin, becomes dry and rough during exposure to low temperature, low moisture, etc., conditions (e.g., in the winter season) or when contacted with detergents or solvents in excess amounts.
      <br/>
      It is thought that such changes in the skin occur when a hygroscopic water soluble component, called NMF (natural moisturizing factor), in the keratin layer is lost causing a reduction in the water content of and in the softness of the keratin layer.
      <br/>
      As a consequence, conventional cosmetics for use in softening the skin are blended with various types of moisturizing agents including natural moisturizing components such as organic acids and amino acids, for the purpose of providing the keratin layer with a large quantity of moisture for a prolonged period of time.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      An example of such skin softening cosmetics are those in which an  ALPHA -hydroxy acid having a keratin layer softening function is blended as an organic acid as in JP-A-55-19291 (the term "JP-A" as used herein means an "unexamined published Japanese patent application").
      <br/>
      However,  ALPHA -hydroxy acids have a disadvantage in that their effects are transient and can be obtained only within a low pH range (pH 2 to 4) which inhibits normal skin physiology.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      In order to resolve such a problem, some cosmetics are adjusted to a neutral pH range by supplementing them with strong alkalis such as sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide and the like or amines such as triethanolamine and the like.
      <br/>
      These strong alkalis, however have a disadvantage in that the quality of the resulting cosmetics cannot be maintained at a constant level, because these alkalis spoil the stability of the cosmetics when blended in a large amount, and it is difficult to accommodate the pH range of the skin.
      <br/>
      Amines, on the other hand, are not desirable from a safety point of view because of the possibility to cause allergic reaction.
    </p>
    <p num="8">In order to resolve such problems caused by the blending of  ALPHA -hydroxy acids, cosmetics in which  ALPHA -hydroxy acids are used in combination with basic amino acids have been proposed for example in JP-B-3-30556 (the term "JP-B" as used herein means an "examined Japanese patent publication"), but their skin softening effects are not sufficient.</p>
    <p num="9">
      In addition, cosmetics blended with amino acids and their derivatives have been proposed with the aim of obtaining skin softening through improvement of the moisturizing effect, such as those in which the hydrolysate of coix seed and the like are blended (for example, JP-B-58-8007) and in which various types of peptides are blended (for example, JP-A-48-23944, JP-A-62-99315 and JP-A-2-178207).
      <br/>
      The skin softening effect of these amino acids and peptide compositions, however, are not sufficient.
    </p>
    <heading>OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="10">An object of the present invention is to overcome the aforementioned problems involved in the prior art and provide skin cosmetics which can soften the keratin layer without spoiling its normal skin physiology and give a proper feeling when used.</p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="11">
      In view of the above, the present inventors have discovered that the use of a guanidine derivative having a specified structure and acid-addition salts thereof provide cosmetics having excellent keratin layer softening effects which are superior to conventional materials in which basic amino acids are used alone or in combination with dicarboxylic acids.
      <br/>
      The present invention has been accomplished on the basis of this finding.
    </p>
    <p num="12">Thus, according to the present invention, there is provided a guanidine derivative represented by formula (1), (2) or (3)  (Chemical Structure image '2' not included in text)</p>
    <p num="13">
      wherein A and B may be the same or different from each other and each represents an alkylene group having 2 to 8 carbon atoms, D represents a single bond, --CO-- or an alkylene group having 1 to 6 carbon atoms which may have a substituent group, E represents a hydrogen atom, a lower alkyl group, an aralkyl group or an aryl group which may have a substituent group, m is an integer of 1 to 6, n is an integer of 0 to 6 and R1 represents a hydrogen atom, a lower alkyl group or --(AO)m --(BO)n --D--E, with the provisos that --(AO)m --(BO)n --D--E is not a hydroxyethyl group when R1 is a methyl group, that R1 is not hydrogen when A is a straight chain alkylene group, m=1 and n=0, that --(AO)m --(BO)n --D--E is not hydroxyethyl when R1 is hydrogen, a methyl group or a hydroxyethyl group and that --(AO)m --(BO)n --D--E is not a lower alkoxyethyl group when R1 is hydrogen, in formula (2), 1 is an integer of 1 to 10, G represents a hydrogen atom, a hydroxyl group, a carboxyl group, a sulfonic acid group or a phosphoric acid group and R1 is as defined immediately above, and, in formula (3), one of R2, R3 and R4 is a hydroxyl group and others are hydrogen atoms.
      <br/>
      Acid addition salts of Formula (1), (2) or (3) and a process for the production of compounds of Formula (1), (2) or (3) are also part of the invention.

      Skin cosmetics having the respective compositions shown in Table 2 were produced in a conventional manner.
      <br/>
      Keratin layer-softening effects of the thus produced skin cosmetics were examined by the following test method, with the results also shown in Table 2.
    </p>
    <p num="127">(Test Method)</p>
    <p num="128">
      A piece of the keratin layer having a size of 30 * 5 mm was soaked in each of the cosmetic preparations for 3 hours.
      <br/>
      After drying, the test piece was allowed to stand in an atmosphere of constant humidity and then checked for its tan  DELTA  value using a dynamic elasticviscosity measuring apparatus (manufactured by Rheologi).
      <br/>
      The results are expressed as relative values when the value of Comparative Example 1 is defined as tan  DELTA =1.
      <br/>
      Higher values indicate greater softening effects.
