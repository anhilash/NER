      An output buffer for a line driver uses transmission gates for active termination.
      <br/>
      A large p-channel driver is pulsed on during a low-to-high output transition, but this driver is turned off once the output voltage reaches a threshold.
      <br/>
      A feedback circuit includes a sensing inverter that has its input connected to the output node.
      <br/>
      The sensing inverter causes the gate of the p-channel driver to be driven high once the output swings past the threshold.
      <br/>
      A similar n-channel driver transistor is pulsed on during a low-going output transition but is disabled by a feedback circuit that senses the output voltage falling below a threshold.
      <br/>
      A pullup transmission gate is also connected between the output and the power supply, while a pulldown transmission gate is connected between the output and ground.
      <br/>
      Each transmission gate contains a p-channel and a n-channel transistor in parallel.
      <br/>
      The sizes of the p-channel and n-channel transistors in the transmission gate is sufficiently small to provide a resistance of 25 to 30 ohms.
      <br/>
      Both transistors in the pullup transmission gate are turned on when the output is driven high, while both transistors of the pulldown transmission gate are turned on when the output is driven low.
      <br/>
      Having both n and p transistors of the transmission gate on provides a more linear resistance across the voltage swing of the output.
      <br/>
      Since termination of about 25-30 ohms is provided by the transmission gate, an external series resistor is not needed for dampening.
      <br/>
      When driving large capacitive loads, several nanoseconds of R-C delay can be saved.

    <heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="1">This invention relates to CMOS output buffers, and more particularly to low-noise and impedance-adjusting output buffers.</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">
      Digital systems often use complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) circuits as interface or "glue" logic.
      <br/>
      Higher-performance systems require increased speed and current requirements for the glue logic.
      <br/>
      Higher current drive increases speed because load capacitances are more quickly charged or discharged.
      <br/>
      Unfortunately, unwanted noise often increases too.
    </p>
    <p num="3">
      CMOS chips with higher-drive output buffers often produce a type of noise known as ground bounce, due to rapid changes in current through the parasitic inductances of the integrated circuit (IC) package.
      <br/>
      These inductances resist changes in current by changing the voltages on power or ground supplies.
      <br/>
      Such voltage changes can falsely trigger logic within the IC device, or other devices in the system.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      The rate of voltage change of the output, the edge rate, increases for these faster devices.
      <br/>
      The high edge rate can reflect off the ends of printed-circuit-board (PCB) wiring traces driven by the output buffer.
      <br/>
      These reflections produce voltage variations known as undershoot, overshoot, and ringing (oscillation).
      <br/>
      Careful layout of these wiring traces is needed to minimize trace-ends that can cause reflections.
      <br/>
      Termination devices such as resistors to ground at the ends of the traces are often used to absorb the reflection-causing wave front produced by the high edge rate.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      FIG. 1 shows a memory module using a buffer or driver.
      <br/>
      Inputs to the memory module are buffered by driver 10.
      <br/>
      Driver 10 drives the input to synchronous dynamic-random-access memory (SDRAM) 12. SDRAMs require precise clock inputs for timing.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      The output from driver 10 is distributed to the inputs of SDRAMs 12 by wiring traces on the printed-circuit board (PCB) of the memory module.
      <br/>
      These wiring traces have a small amount of resistance 16 that is distributed throughout the wiring trace.
      <br/>
      The input pins of SDRAMs 12 have a relatively large capacitance.
      <br/>
      Overall capacitance can reach 70 pF.
      <br/>
      Thus a significant R-C delay occurs, and driver 10 must have a high current drive to meet timing requirements for the memory module.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      Dampening resistor 14 is sometimes used.
      <br/>
      Dampening resistor 14 is in series on the wiring trace between driver 10 and SDRAMs 12 rather than being a resistor to power or ground.
      <br/>
      Dampening resistors reduce or slow down the high edge rate as well as any reflections.
      <br/>
      Unfortunately, the speed of the output buffer is also reduced.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      While discrete dampening resistors are often used, the output buffer of driver 10 itself provides some impedance, which also acts as a dampening resistor.
      <br/>
      Unfortunately, this impedance decreases with higher-current-drive output buffers.
      <br/>
      The lower impedance of these output buffers creates a greater mis-match between the output buffer's impedance and the impedance of the wiring trace.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      A series resistance of about 33 ohms is used for dampening resistor 14.
      <br/>
      When driving a 70 pF load of inputs to SDRAM 12, an R-C delay of 2.3 ns occurs.
      <br/>
      As desired buffer speeds drop below 4 ns, this R-C delay is a significant design burden.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      High speed requires high-drive output buffers.
      <br/>
      These high-drive buffers have impedances of perhaps only 5 ohms, far less than the 35 to 30 ohms required for a series dampening resistor.
      <br/>
      Thus the output impedance is not sufficient for the needed dampening resistance.
    </p>
    <p num="11">
      Power budgets also limit the quality of termination.
      <br/>
      Lower-impedance resistors consume much power.
      <br/>
      CMOS chips driving terminated lines can only sink or source a limited amount of current in the static or D.C. state.
    </p>
    <p num="12">
      FIG. 2 is a diagram of a waveform of a prior-art high-drive output buffer driving a PCB wiring trace.
      <br/>
      The high current drive of the output buffer produces a high edge rate that rapidly changes the output voltage from ground to the power-supply voltage, Vcc.
      <br/>
      The high edge rate produces a wave front that travels down the wiring trace and reflects off one or more ends.
      <br/>
      The reflected wave front then travels back up the wiring trace to the output buffer, and raises the voltage at the output buffer when the reflected wave arrives.
      <br/>
      The raised voltage is above Vcc and is known as an overshoot.
      <br/>
      This reflected wave then reverses direction and travels back to the end of the wiring trace, is reflected, and again reaches the output buffer, producing a series of both overshoots and undershoots, known as ringing.
      <br/>
      Since the reflected wave is dampened and loses energy at each reflection, the amplitude of the ringing gradually decreases.
      <br/>
      Low-going ringing (undershoot) is caused by a mis-match in impedance.
      <br/>
      Multiple reflections interfere with each other and cause the ringing.
    </p>
    <p num="13">
      When the output buffer switches from high to low, another high-edge rate wave travels down the wiring trace and is reflected back, producing undershoot and more ringing.
      <br/>
      This undershoot can cause ground bounce inside the output buffer's IC.
    </p>
    <p num="14">
      When the ringing, overshoot, or undershoot is large, logic can read a static signal as low when the static signal is actually high.
      <br/>
      For example, a static 3-volt signal input to another pin of the IC is a high signal, but when the internal ground of the IC bounces up from 0 volt to 2 volt, the static 3-volt signal appears to be a 1-volt signal, a low input.
      <br/>
      When the input signal is connected to a latch or flip-flop, the false low can be latched in, causing an error.
      <br/>
      Thus noise is a serious problem.
    </p>
    <p num="15">
      Several prior-art solutions to these problems are known.
      <br/>
      For example, Pierce et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,319,252, assigned to Xilinx Inc. of San Jose, Calif., discloses an output buffer which gradually turns output buffers on and off so that there is no sharp discontinuity in the current flow.
      <br/>
      The output voltage is fed back to gradually turn off the output buffer at the end of the voltage transition.
      <br/>
      Lipp in U.S. Pat. No. 5,347,177, discloses a closed-loop trace which is driven by output buffers with level-sensitive impedance control.

      Sharpe-Geisler, U.S. Pat. No. 5,438,277, assigned to Advanced Micro Devices of Sunnyvale, Calif., discloses an output buffer using two pull-down devices.
      <br/>
      A noisy (larger) pull-down device is connected to a noisy ground (having ground bounce) while a quiet (smaller) pull-down device is connected to a quiet ground.
      <br/>
      A one-shot triggered by an internal signal first switches on the noisy pull-down, then turns off the noisy pulldown and turns on the quiet pull-down.

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
    <p num="28">
      The present invention relates to an improvement in variable-impedance output drivers.
      <br/>
      The following description is presented to enable one of ordinary skill in the art to make and use the invention as provided in the context of a particular application and its requirements.
      <br/>
      Various modifications to the preferred embodiment will be apparent to those with skill in the art, and the general principles defined herein may be applied to other embodiments.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the present invention is not intended to be limited to the particular embodiments shown and described, but is to be accorded the widest scope consistent with the principles and novel features herein disclosed.
    </p>
    <p num="29">
      The inventors have realized that the output impedance can be adjusted dynamically during a switching transition.
      <br/>
      During the transition, a low impedance can be provided as high current is delivered.
      <br/>
      However, near the end of the transition, the output impedance can be increased to 25-30 ohms, thus providing a series dampening resistance to absorb reflections.
      <br/>
      Thus the external dampening resistor can be eliminated.
    </p>
    <p num="30">
      Eliminating the external dampening resistor also eliminates the fixed R-C delay of as much as 2 ns.
      <br/>
      Instead, the effective resistance during the transition is 5 ohms, reducing the delay to 0.35 ns for a pF load.
      <br/>
      Once the transition is complete, the R-C delay again increases, since the output impedance increases to 30 ohms.
      <br/>
      However, by this time the output has been charged past the logic threshold, and thus the R-C delay does not increase the switching time.
    </p>
    <p num="31">
      The inventors have further realized that the variable impedance can be provided by pulsing the large driver transistors on and off during the transition.
      <br/>
      A feedback path is used to sense the output voltage.
      <br/>
      Once the output has been driven sufficiently to push the output voltage past a desired threshold, the large driver transistors turn off.
      <br/>
      Then an active termination is provided.
    </p>
    <p num="32">
      The inventors also realize that the active termination of about 25-30 ohms can be provided by full-CMOS transmission gates.
      <br/>
      Both an n-channel and a p-channel transistor continue to pull the output up after the large driver transistors is turned off.
      <br/>
      Likewise, another p-channel and n-channel transistor pair continue to pull the output low after the large pull-down driver transistor turns off.
    </p>
    <p num="33">
      Using both an n-channel and a p-channel transistor in parallel provides a more linear impedance that is less sensitive to voltage levels.
      <br/>
      Thus the transmission-gate active termination more closely matches the series resistance of an external dampening resistor than does a single n-channel or p-channel transistor.
    </p>
    <p num="34">
      The transmission gate can be activated early, allowing it to aid in switching the output.
      <br/>
      In particular, the n-channel transistor in the pull-up transmission gate can be turned on early to assist in pullup.
      <br/>
      Likewise, the p-channel transistor in the pull-down transmission gate can be turned on early to speed up pull-down.
    </p>
    <p num="35">Transmission Gates Provide Termination--FIG. 3</p>
    <p num="36">
      FIG. 3 is a diagram of an output buffer with feedback to vary impedance and transmission-gates for termination.
      <br/>
      Output 20 is connected to a large-capacitance external load (not shown) that does not have an external dampening resistor.
      <br/>
      Output 20 is driven high by p-channel driver transistor 28 and driven low by n-channel driver transistor 38.
      <br/>
      The output voltage of output 20 is input to feedback control 30, 32, which disable driver transistors 28, 38 once enough voltage swing on output 20 occurs to reach a threshold.
      <br/>
      Thus driver transistors 28, 38 are turned on only briefly during the transition of output 20.
    </p>
    <p num="37">
      The amount of time that driver transistors 28, 38 are on depends on the current drive delivered and the capacitance and trace resistance of the load on output 20.
      <br/>
      Since feedback control 30, 32 sense the output voltage, the time that the driver transistors 28, 38 are on is adjusted for current Vcc and temperature conditions and output loading.
    </p>
    <p num="38">
      Active termination of output 20 is provided by pullup transmission gate 18 and pulldown transmission gate 19.
      <br/>
      Pullup transmission gate 18 contains n-channel transistor 26 and p-channel transistor 24, while pulldown transmission gate 19 contains n-channel transistor 34 and p-channel transistor 36.
      <br/>
      Thus full-CMOS transmission gates are used for active termination.
    </p>
    <p num="39">
      When output 20 is driven high, both transistors 24, 26 of pullup transmission gate 18 are turned on.
      <br/>
      When output 20 is driven low, both transistors 34, 36 of pulldown transmission gate 19 are turned on.
    </p>
    <p num="40">Operation</p>
    <p num="41">
      When output 20 is low and input IN goes high, output 20 is driven from low-to-high.
      <br/>
      IN first turns on n-channel transistor 26 in pullup transmission gate 18, which begins to pull output 20 up. P-channel driver transistor 28 is then turned on through feedback control 30.
      <br/>
      Since p-channel driver transistor 28 is much larger than n-channel transistor 26, the output is rapidly pulled high by p-channel driver transistor 28 with a low impedance.
    </p>
    <p num="42">
      Once input IN is propagated through inverter 22, p-channel transistor 24 turns on, so that both transistors in pullup transmission gate 18 are activated.
      <br/>
      Transistors 34, 36 in pulldown transmission gate 19 are turned off.

      After output 20 has been driven to a voltage above a logic threshold, feedback control 30 disables driver transistor 28 by driving a high voltage to its gate.
      <br/>
      Once driver transistor 28 is shut off, the output impedance rises to the impedance through transmission gate 18, which remains on.

      Thus the overall impedance of transmission gate 18 tends to remain constant, or at least more linear than just a single pullup transistor.

    <p num="79">Advantages of the Invention</p>
    <p num="80">
      The output buffer or driver has a high current drive and high speed.
      <br/>
      Noise from the fast edge rate, such as ringing, undershoot, overshoot, and ground bounce are reduced.
      <br/>
      The impedance of the output buffer is dynamically controlled to provide low impedance as the output voltage is rapidly changing, but high impedance when the reflected wave front is received to dampen the reflections.
      <br/>
      An active termination from the transmission gate matches the trace resistance of a memory module clock line.
      <br/>
      Series resistance is provided by the transmission gate within the output buffer so that the external series dampening resistor can be eliminated.
      <br/>
      Active termination with relatively constant resistance across various voltage ranges is achieved.
      <br/>
      The high-speed output buffer has low resistance during switching but higher resistance after switching.
    </p>
    <p num="81">
      Since the feedback control senses the output voltage, the time that the driver transistors are on is adjusted for current Vcc and temperature conditions and output loading.
      <br/>
      Better process, temperature, and supply-voltage tracking is achieved.
      <br/>
      Matching termination also reduces unwanted electromagnetic interference (EMI).

    <p num="82">Alternate Embodiments</p>
    <p num="83">
      Several other embodiments are contemplated by the inventors.
      <br/>
      For example, the timing of the disabling of the driver transistors can be adjusted.
      <br/>
      The driver transistors and transmission gates can be provided with separate power-supply and ground busses to isolate output noise from internal circuits.
      <br/>
      Various device sizes can be used.
    </p>
    <p num="84">
      The resistors in series with the transmission gates can be implemented as diffusion resistors or as polysilicon resistors.

      Current may flow in either direction, as negative current can flow from ground to the power supply.
