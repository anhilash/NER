    <p num="1">This invention relates to the prophylaxis, amelioration and/or treatment of damage to the lining of the alimentary tract resulting from chemotherapy and/or radiation.</p>
    <p num="2">
      Chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy are effective at destroying tumours because they target fast-growing tissues.
      <br/>
      The mechanism involves impairment of DNA synthesis or interference with metabolic processes required for rapidly dividing cells.
      <br/>
      While tumour cells are selectively targeted by anticancer treatments, the fast-growing tissues of the host are also susceptible, particularly the immune cells of the body and the lining of the alimentary tract.
      <br/>
      Epithelial cell division in the alimentary tract occurs in the crypt zone of the mucosa.
      <br/>
      The newly synthesised cells then acquire their functional properties (such as digestive enzymes) as they migrate towards the luminal surface and finally, they are extruded into the lumen of the alimentary tract.
      <br/>
      This entire process takes only several days so that the mucosal epithelium of the alimentary tract has one of the most rapid rates of cell division of any body tissue, and is therefore a major site of toxicity for anticancer regimens.
    </p>
    <p num="3">
      The linings of the mouth and oesophagus are particularly sensitive to chemotherapy and radiation.
      <br/>
      The oral ulcerations characteristic of mucositis (also referred to as `stomatitis`) are a major clinical problem causing considerable pain, increased susceptibility to infection and inability to eat.
      <br/>
      Damage to the intestinal lining also occurs commonly in the small bowel, and less frequently in the large bowel, leading to severe diarrhoea and pain. (Verdi C J 1993 Cancer therapy and oral mucositis.
      <br/>
      An appraisal of drug prophylaxis.
      <br/>
      Drug Safety 9:185-195; Sonis S T 1993 Oral complications of cancer chemotherapy In VT DeVita Jr, S Hellman and S A Rosenberg (ed) Cancer, Principles and Practice of Oncology, pp 2385-2394.
      <br/>
      Philadelphia, J B Lippencott Co).
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      Mucositis occurs by two distinct mechanisms: by direct damage to the alimentary lining by anticancer drugs or radiation, and indirectly as a result of opportunistic infections associated with neutropenia in patients with a compromised immune system.
      <br/>
      As a result, any drug that causes significant neutropenia can precipitate indirect mucositis (Verdi C J 1993).
      <br/>
      Direct damage to the gut barrier would also increase susceptibility to opportunistic infections by allowing bacterial translocation across a damaged gut lining.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      In general, mucositis is manifest within 5 to 10 days of the drug or radiation treatment and can last several weeks.
      <br/>
      The severity of mucositis can vary from mild to so severe that it limits the dose of chemotherapy or radiation.
      <br/>
      For patients undergoing high-dose chemo/radiation therapy, mucositis is the chief source of infection and the resultant sepsis, the main cause of morbidity and mortality, and the primary reason for their hospitalisation.
      <br/>
      Patients suffering mucositis may need several weeks or more of intravenous feeding as a result of the mouth ulcers, cramps, extreme pain, gut denuding, and severe diarrhoea (Verdi 1993; Sonis 1993).
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      Mucositis can delay retreatment of patients with chemotherapy or radiotherapy or necessitate a subsequent dose reduction, thereby compromising the overall efficacy of anticancer treatment.
      <br/>
      With some anticancer regimens, mucositis is the limiting toxicity.
      <br/>
      Overcoming this toxicity would improve quality of life, reduce susceptibility to secondary infection, obviate the need for intravenous feeding, and importantly, improve the efficacy of tumour ablation through increased tolerance to higher doses of chemotherapy or radiation (Verdi C J 1993).
      <br/>
      Costs of hospitalisation would be substantially reduced as more patients could be managed as out-patients.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      About 40% of all patients receiving chemotherapy develop significant mucositis, with up to 100% incidence in some forms of chemotherapy or radiotherapy.
      <br/>
      Clinically significant mucositis develops with a range of standard chemotherapy drugs that are used, either alone or in combination, to treat various cancers including those of the colon, breast, prostate, head, neck and haemopoetic system.
      <br/>
      Examples of drugs that frequently cause direct mucositis include, but are not limited to, alkylating agents such as mechlorethamine, melphalan and busulphan, antimetabolites including cytarabine, floxuridine, 5-fluorouracil, mercaptopurine, methotrexate and thioguanine, cytotoxic drugs such as bleomycin, actinomycin-D, daunorubicin, etoposide, mitomycin, vinblastine and vincristine, and other chemotherapy drugs such as hyroxyurea and procarbazine (Sonis 1993).
      <br/>
      Direct exposure of the alimentary tract to high-dose radiotherapy, as occurs for example with total body irradiation, treatment of head and neck tumours or radiotherapy of abdominal tumours, will also cause a high incidence of mucositis.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      Mucositis is particularly severe with high-dose chemotherapy or when two or more drugs are used in the one course of treatment, for example the ablative therapy prior to bone marrow transplant or peripheral stem cell transplant.
      <br/>
      The combination of high-dose chemotherapy with aggressive radiotherapy can also cause severe mucositis (Sonis 1993).
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      The prior art suffers from the lack of an effective drug to prevent, reduce or treat damage to the lining of the alimentary tract resulting from chemotherapy and/or radiation.
      <br/>
      At present, patient treatment is mainly palliative to control pain through analgesics, prevent infection and provide intravenous nutritional support.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      The prior art includes a number of approaches aimed at reducing the severity of mucositis.
      <br/>
      Low energy laser treatment of the mouth has been reported to reduce the severity of oral mucositis in patients given high dose chemotherapy prior to bone marrow transplantation (Ninth Annual Meeting of the International Soc.
      <br/>
      Oral Oncology, June 1994, NIH, Bethesda, USA).
      <br/>
      Numerous drugs have been evaluated in the prevention of mucositis, with some degree of efficacy for cytoprotectants (e.g. sucralfate) and antimicrobial drugs such as chlorhexidine and benzydamine (reviewed in Verdi C J 1993).
      <br/>
      A somatostatin analogue (octreotide acetate) has been shown to inhibit secretory diarrhoea in patients with mucositis induced by the chemotherapy drug, 5-fluorouracil.
      <br/>
      The mechanism of action is probably secondary to inhibition of pancreatic and gastrointestinal function (Petrelli N J, Rodriguez-Bigas M, Rustum Y, Herrara L, Creaven P 1993 Bowel rest, intravenous hydration and continuous high-dose infusion of octreotide acetate for the treatment of chemotherapy-induced diarrhoea in patients with colorectal carcinoma.
      <br/>
      Cancer. 72:1543-1546).
    </p>
    <p num="11">
      Recombinant transforming growth factor-beta 3 (TGF-b 3) has been shown to reduce the severity of oral mucositis induced by injection of hamsters with 5-fluorouracil (Sonis S T, Lindquist L, Van Vugt A, Stewart A A, Stam K, Qu G -Y, Iwata K K, Haley J D 1994 Prevention of chemotherapy-induced ulcerative mucositis by transforming growth factor-b3.
      <br/>
      Cancer Res. 54:1135-1138).
      <br/>
      The effects of other growth factors are less clear.
      <br/>
      For example, recombinant epidermal growth factor (EGF) does not appear to relieve oral mucositis (Sonis S T, Costa J W, Evitts S M, Linquist L E, Nicolson M 1992 Effect of epidermal growth factor on ulcerative mucositis in hamsters that receive cancer chemotherapy.
      <br/>
      Oral Surg Oral Med Oral Pathol. 74:749-755), but may enhance intestinal recovery following abdominal radiation (McKenna K J, Ligato S, Kauffman G L, Abt A B, Stryker J A, Conter R L 1994 Epidermal growth factor enhances intestinal mitotic activity and DNA content after acute abdominal radiation.
      <br/>
      Surgery. 15:626-632).

      The prior art also includes International Patent Application PCT/SE93/00503) to Kabi Pharmacia.
      <br/>
      This application discloses the use of insulin-like growth factor-II (IGF-II) or effective analogues thereof for the manufacture of a medicament for prevention or treatment of nutritional or gastrointestinal diseases and for promoting human or animal neonatal growth.
      <br/>
      However, utility in the prophylaxis, amelioration and/or treatment of damage to the lining of the alimentary tract resulting form chemotherapy and/or radiation is neither disclosed or suggested.
    </p>
    <p num="13">
      The prior art also includes WO92/00994 A1 to GroPep Pty Ltd.
      <br/>
      This application discloses the use of a milk product extract for the treatment of gastrointestinal injury, disease or ulcers.
      <br/>
      However, utility in the prevention or treatment of damage to the alimentary tract resulting from chemotherapy or radiotherapy is neither disclosed nor suggested in this citation.
      <br/>
      Prior art in the field of mucositis, the most common injury from chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy predicts that it would be beneficial to reduce rather than increase the growth rate of the lining of the alimentary tract, and thereby render the cells less susceptible to chemotherapy or radiotherapy that targets rapidly growing tissues.
      <br/>
      This is the opposite effect to that which is predicted to occur with agents that heal or promote the regrowth of gastrointestinal tissues such as the plurality cell growth stimulating agents described in WO92/00994 A1.
      <br/>
      Accordingly the approach taken by the applicants in treating mucositis is contrary to the normal approach.
    </p>
    <p num="14">
      WO92/00994 A1 does not teach or disclose the use of a milk product extract for the amelioration or treatment of mucositis because the mechanism of alimentary tract damage in mucositis (inhibition of cell proliferation and neutropenia) is different from that which occurs in other alimentary tract conditions.
      <br/>
      For example, gastric ulcers, the treatment of which by milk products is described in the prior art, are not caused by an inhibition of cell proliferation nor are they accompanied by neutropenia Rather, they result from acid-induced destruction of the lining of the stomach.
      <br/>
      Mucositis of the mouth and esophagus is outside the region of the alimentary tract also claimed in WO92/00994A1, which only refers to the gastrointestinal tract (stomach and intestines).
      <br/>
      Since the structure of the epithelial lining of the mouth and esophagus is different from that in the stomach and intestines, an agent that reduces damage to the lining of the gastrointestinal tract cannot be predicted to have the same action in the mouth and esophagus.
    </p>

    <heading>INTRODUCTION TO EXAMPLES</heading>
    <p num="48">Surprisingly, a milk product extract from cheese whey, equivalent to GFE-2 in Australian Patent 645589 has been found by the applicants to reduce the severity of intestinal mucositis caused by injection of rats with the chemotherapy agent, methotrexate.</p>
    <p num="49">This same milk product extract has been found by the applicants to reduce the severity of oral mucositis in the hamster cheek pouch caused by injection in the hamsters with the chemotherapy agent, 5-fluorouracil.</p>
    <p num="50">In accordance with the above, treatment of chemotherapy or radiotherapy patients with GFE-2 would at least partially alleviate the symptoms of gut mucositis including mucosal damage, functional impairment, and susceptibility to infection, as well as at least partially alleviating the symptoms of oral and oesophagael mucositis, thereby facilitating recovery and potentially increasing tolerance to higher doses of chemotherapy drug or radiation.</p>
    <p num="51">EXAMPLE 1</p>
    <p num="52">Oral administration of a milk product extract from bovine cheese whey (GFE-2) partially prevents loss of small intestinal crypts and villi in rats with methotrexate-induced small bowel mucositis</p>
    <p num="53">
      In this Example, rats were injected with high doses of the chemotherapy agent, methotrexate, as an experimental model of gut mucositis.
      <br/>
      In rats, methotrexate damages the small bowel, but not the oral or colonic mucosa (Vanderhoof J A, Park J H Y, Mohammadpour H, Blackwood D 1990 Effects of dietary lipids on recovery from mucosal injury.
      <br/>
      Gastroenterology. 98:1226-1231.) Oral administration to methotrexate-injected rats of a milk product extract purified from bovine cheese whey (GFE-2 as described in Australian Patent 645,589) provided evidence that the milk product extract can ameliorate chemotherapy damage to the small bowel.
    </p>
    <p num="54">
      Male Sprague Dawley rats, weighing on average 140 g and maintained in metabolism cages were fed a high-carbohydrate diet.
      <br/>
      Control rats received no milk product extract, whereas experimental rats were treated for 5 days with a milk product extract purified from bovine cheese whey.
      <br/>
      The whey-derived milk product extract (Whey Growth Factor Extract) was prepared as described for GFE-2 in Australian Patent 645,589.
      <br/>
      GFE-2 treated rats were fed a modified diet containing 31.2 g GFE-2/kg diet in place of the equivalent amount of casein.
      <br/>
      In addition, the GFE-2 fed rats were given GFE-2 by stomach gavage on days 3, 4 and 5 of the experimental period so that the total dose of GFE-2 per day averaged 514 mg/day GFE-2.
      <br/>
      Control rats were fed the unmodified diet and gavaged by an identical protocol on days 3, 4 and 5 with an equivalent amount of bovine serum albumin to ensure an isonitrogenous diet.
    </p>
    <p num="55">
      One group of control rats and the GFE-2 treated rats (8 rats per group) were injected subcutaneously with 2.5 mg/kg methotrexate at the start of days 1, 2 and 3 according to the protocol described by Vanderhoof et al (1990), the entire disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.
      <br/>
      An additional control group (`pair-fed`) received sham methotrexate injections, and was pair-fed to the methotrexate-injected control group.
    </p>
    <p num="56">
      Rats were maintained in the metabolism cages for 5 days, at which time they were killed for collection of the gastrointestinal tract.
      <br/>
      Tissue samples were collected from the proximal small bowel (duodenum and jejunum) as well as the distal small bowel (ileum).
      <br/>
      Tissue samples were fixed in methacarn, embedded in paraffin, sectioned and stained with haematoxylin-eosin for histological analysis using methods described in Read et al (1992), the entire disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference (Read L C, Tomas F M, Howarth G S, Martin A A, Edson K J, Gillespie C M, Owens P C, Ballard F J 1992 Insulin-like growth factor-I and its N-terminal modified analogues induce marked gut growth in dexamethasone-treated rats.
      <br/>
      J Endocrinol. 133:421-431).
    </p>
    <p num="57">
      Compared with the pair-fed controls, the methotrexate-injected control group showed loss of mucosal crypts in the jejunum, and to a lesser extent in the ileum.
      <br/>
      This is illustrated in FIG. 1(a) as the area of intact crypts per unit area of total mucosa, and demonstrates that methotrexate causes loss of mucosal crypts (which contain the dividing cells of the epithelium) characteristic of chemotherapy damage.
      <br/>
      Also characteristic of chemotherapy damage in the small bowel, methotrexate injection caused stunting and loss of intestinal villi, being the functional compartment of the small bowel mucosa.
      <br/>
      This is illustrated in FIG. 1(b) by a reduction in the surface length of the finger-like villi per unit length of intestinal circumference in methotrexate-treated controls compared with the pair-fed group receiving no methotrexate.
    </p>
    <p num="58">
      Oral administration of GFE-2 for 5 days starting at the time of the first methotrexate injection partially prevented the loss of mucosal crypts and villi in both regions of the small bowel (FIG. 1).
      <br/>
      The effects of GFE-2 were statistically significant (P&lt;0.05 by ANOVA) in the jejunum, where methotrexate-induced damage was more severe, and in the ileum for villus surface length.
      <br/>
      The example demonstrates that oral administration of GFE-2 is able to partially prevent or accelerate repair of chemotherapy damage in the small bowel.
    </p>
    <p num="59">EXAMPLE 2</p>
    <p num="60">Sucrase activity in the mucosa of rats from Example 1</p>
    <p num="61">
      From the same experiment as described in Example 1, 4 cm lengths of small bowel were frozen for measurement of the activity of mucosal sucrase, an enzyme located on the surface of epithelial cells of the villus.
      <br/>
      Because sucrase is essential for digestion of dietary sucrose, the sucrase activity per unit length of intestine provides a measure of the functional capacity of the small bowel (Read et al, 1992).
    </p>
    <p num="62">Five days' oral administration of GFE-2 to methotrexate-injected rats significantly improved (P&lt;0.05) the sucrase activity per unit length of ileum compared with the methotrexate-injected control group, or the pair-fed control group (FIG. 2).</p>
    <p num="63">This example demonstrates that GFE-2 improves the functional capacity of the chemotherapy-damaged small bowel.</p>
    <p num="64">EXAMPLE 3</p>
    <p num="65">Oral administration of GFE-2 to rats for 5 to 12 days reduces bacterial translocation across the gut.</p>
    <p num="66">The ability of the gut epithelium to provide a barrier against bacterial invasion provides another measure of gut function that is compromised by gut mucositis.</p>
    <p num="67">
      In Example 3, 140 g male Sprague Dawley rats were injected with methotrexate for three consecutive days as described in Example 1.
      <br/>
      Methotrexate-injected rats were administered oral GFE-2 by an identical protocol to that described in Example 1.
      <br/>
      One group of rats was killed on day 5 after the start of methotrexate injections (as in Example 1), while in other groups, GFE-2 treatment was continued for a total of 8 or 12 days (8 rats per group).
      <br/>
      Control methotrexate-treated rats and pair-fed control rats identical to those in Example 1 were killed on days 5, 8 and 12 (8 rats per group).
    </p>
    <p num="68">
      Rats were maintained in metabolism cages as in Example 1 until exsanguination on day 5, 8 or 12.
      <br/>
      The abdominal skin was soaked in 70% ethanol before the intestine was removed under aseptic conditions.
      <br/>
      All visible mesenteric lymph nodes were placed into a sterile pre-weighed container.
      <br/>
      Samples were then weighed and brain heart infusion solution was added to a final concentration of 100 mg/ml.
      <br/>
      Tissues were homogenised in this solution with sterile glass-reinforced grinders.
      <br/>
      For measurement of translocation of gram negative bacteria into mesenteric lymph nodes, 40 or 60 mg of each tissue homogenate was placed onto MacConkey agar II or blood agar plates and incubated aerobically at 35 (degree)  C. for 48 hours.
      <br/>
      Enteric gram negative bacterial colonies were identified using API 20E strips, then counted.
      <br/>
      The incidence (proportion of animals exhibiting detectable bacterial translocation) and mean number of bacterial colonies per gram of tissue were calculated for each treatment group.
    </p>
    <p num="69">
      Pair-fed control animals receiving no methotrexate showed no incidence of bacterial translocation across the gut.
      <br/>
      Methotrexate injection impaired the intestinal barrier so that all rats in the methotrexate-injected control group (FIG. 3: `No GFE-2`) had positive bacterial cultures from mesenteric lymph nodes on day 5.
      <br/>
      The incidence in this group diminished over the next 7 days, but remained at 60% of rats on day 12 (FIG. 3a).
      <br/>
      The number of colonies per gram of mesenteric lymph node was maximal on day 5, and then diminished thereafter in parallel with the incidence (FIG. 3b).
    </p>
    <p num="70">
      Oral administration of GFE-2 resulted in a lower incidence of translocation on days 8 and 12, with the difference between GFE-2 treated and control methotrexate-injected rats reaching statistical significance by  CHI 2 test (P&lt;0.05) on day 12.
      <br/>
      The number of colonies per gram of mesenteric lymph node was also significantly lower in the GFE-2 treated group on both day 5 and 8.
    </p>
    <p num="71">
      The example demonstrates that oral administration of the milk product extract partially prevents chemotherapy-induced loss of barrier function in the gut.
      <br/>
      This could be expected to decrease the incidence of infection and sepsis following chemotherapy.
    </p>
    <p num="72">EXAMPLE 4</p>
    <p num="73">Milk product extracts protect intestinal cells in culture against damage by the chemotherapy agent, methotrexate.</p>
    <p num="74">The milk product extracts evaluated in this Example were GFE-2 prepared as described in Australian Patent 645,589, transiently acidified GFE-2 prepared as in Example 2 of International Patent Application PCT/AU95/00237 and the permeate fraction obtained by controlled pore ultrafiltration under acid conditions of GFE-2 as described in Example 5 of International Patent Application PCT/AU95/00237.</p>
    <p num="75">
      Intestinal epithelian cells (IEC-6) were plated on to plastic 96-well plates at a density of 2.5 * 104 cells/ml in Dulbecco-Modified Eagle's Minimal Essential Medium (DMEM) containing 10% fetal bovine serum.
      <br/>
      The plates were incubated in a humidified atmosphere at 37 (degree)  C. in the presence of 5% CO2 for 1 day after which the medium was replaced and the incubation continued for a second day.
    </p>
    <p num="76">On the third day the medium in each well was replaced by 100  MU l of a methotrexate solution (10-6 M in DMEM plus 10% fetal bovine serum) plus 100  MU l of a milk product extract solution containing either GFE-2, transiently acidified GFE-2 or permeate GFE-2 at various dilutions in DMEM plus 10% fetal bovine serum.</p>
    <p num="77">
      The cells were left in contact with these solutions for one day.
      <br/>
      The wells were then washed twice with DMEM and incubated for a further day in DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum.
    </p>
    <p num="78">
      After incubation of the cells in this fresh medium for one day the cells were washed, fixed and the cell numbers quantified using an automated methylene blue method (M H Oliver et al., J. Cell Sci. 92, 513, 1989, the entire disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference).
      <br/>
      Growth is expressed as the percentage survival of cells relative to cells not exposed to methotrexate.

      The results are illustrated in FIG. 4.

    <p num="82">
      This experiment investigated the effects of GFE-2 administered topically on chemotherapy-induced oral mucositis in male Golden Syrian hamsters.
      <br/>
      The trial included continuous treatment of GFE-2 to the cheek pouch of 10 hamsters treated with 5-fluorouracil.
    </p>
    <p num="83">
      Hamsters were divided into two groups of five animals.
      <br/>
      The initial mean body weight of each group was similar.
      <br/>
      All hamsters were given intraperitoneal injections of 90 mg/kg of 5-FU on day 1, and 60 mg/kg on day 3.
      <br/>
      The cheek pouch was scratched on days 1, 2 and 3 with six strokes of a wire brush in one direction and six strokes in the other perpendicular direction to achieve a uniform wound.
    </p>
    <p num="84">
      Groups were treated with either a commercial mouthwash as vehicle, or 0.3 ml of GFE-2 at 40 mg/ml protein concentration.
      <br/>
      The cheek pouch liquid treatments were applied daily for one minute, during which time the hamsters were anaesthetised using isoflurane anaesthesia.
    </p>
    <p num="85">
      The cheek pouch was assessed on days 5, 7, 8, 11, 13 and 15.
      <br/>
      Monitoring was based on a visual assessment of the cheek pouch (graded on a 1-10 scale) taking into account the overall severity of the lesion, degree of bruising, swelling and scarring.
      <br/>
      Body weight was recorded as a percentage of the day 0 value.

    <p num="86">
      Animals given a topical treatment of GFE-2 showed reduced mucositis compared to the vehicle treated group, measured as overall visual score (FIG. 5), total ulcer area and body weight loss (FIG. 6).
      <br/>
      Each of these effects was statistically significant by paired t-test favouring GFE-2 treatment.
