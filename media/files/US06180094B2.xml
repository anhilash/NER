      The present invention relates to a medicament which comprises a weakly basic anion exchange resin chelating with ferric ions as an active ingredient.
      <br/>
      The medicament is useful as a medicament for therapeutic and/or preventive treatment of hyperphosphatemia.
    </p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND ART</heading>
    <p num="2">
      Patients of chronic renal failure are unavoidably treated by dialysis normally at regular intervals over a prolonged period of time, and pathological conditions of increased plasma phosphate concentrations (4.5 mg/dl or more), i.e., hyperphosphatemia, are often appeared in the patients.
      <br/>
      Because no direct etiological treatment of hyperphosphatemia has been developed so far, diet therapy to lower phosphate absorption, or as a symptomatic therapy, treatment by oral administration of a medicament for hyperphosphatemia which adsorbs phosphate ions in the digestive tract are generally applied.
      <br/>
      As medicaments for therapeutic treatment of hyperphosphatemia, aluminum hydroxide gel and precipitated calcium carbonate are commonly used.
    </p>
    <p num="3">
      International Publication WO95/05184 discloses a method for eliminating phosphate ions in vivo by using a polymer such as polyallylamine, polyethylenimine or other, preferably a cross-linked polymer obtained by using a crosslinking agent such as epichlorohydrin or the like.
      <br/>
      The publicaition teaches that strongly basic anion exchange resins such as Dowex are not preferred from viewpoints that doses are inevitably high because of their weak adsorbability of phosphate ions and the resins may adsorb salts of bile acids.
      <br/>
      The publication also teaches that the aforementioned polymers are improved in these points compared to the conventional resins.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      Aluminum hydroxide gel used as a medicament for therapeutic treatment of hyperphosphatemia has problems of high daily dosage, and moreover, bad taste, which cause difficulty in administration by a patient.
      <br/>
      Additionally, aluminum ions, formed by dissociation from the aluminum hydroxide gel in contact with gastric hydrochloric acid, are absorbed from the intestinal tract, and as a result, prolonged administration may sometimes cause precipitation of aluminum in the brain and bones and induces so-called osteopathic aluminosis or encephalopathic aluminosis, microcytic anemia or other.
      <br/>
      On the other hand, precipitated calcium carbonate used as a medicament for therapeutic treatment of hyperphosphatemia also has a problem that calcium ions formed by dissociation in contact with gastric hydrochloric acid may cause hypercalcemia.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      In pathologic conditions of chronic renal failure accompanied by hyperphosphatemia, complications such as iron deficiency anemia, metabolic acidosis or other may often appear in patients.
      <br/>
      It is well known that administration of aluminum hydroxide gel under these conditions may further deteriorate the anemia.
      <br/>
      In addition, it is also known that cholestyramine (a preparation comprising a polystyrene-type strongly basic anion exchange resin: "Questran", Bristol Myers Squibb Co.), which is used as a cholesterol depressant that adsorbs bile acids, also adsorbs iron ions and suppresses the iron absorption from the intestinal tract to reduce the iron concentration in blood and tissues and lower the hematocrit level. which advances iron deficiency anemia (Digestive Diseases, Vol. 17, No. 3, p.263-269, 1972; and Clin.
      <br/>
      Res. Vol. 18, p.38, 1970).
      <br/>
      In addition, international Publication WO94/27621 discloses a method for binding iron ions by using a polymer having amino groups.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, if polystyrene resins and acrylic resins having amino groups, per se, are administered, the aforementioned adverse effect (iron deficiency anemia) may possibly be generated.

    <heading>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading>
    <p num="13">FIG. 1 shows pH-dependent changes in the amount of phosphate ions adsorbed by weakly basic anion exchange resins chelating with ferric ions (WA10-Fe, WA20-Fe, WA21-Fe, and IRA-67-Fe) and by precipitated calcium carbonate.</p>
    <heading>BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="14">The present invention relates to a medicament which comprises as an active ingredient a weakly basic anion exchange resin chelating with ferric ions, preferably a polyamine-type or an acrylic-type weakly basic anion exchange resin, and is used for therapeutic and/or preventive treatment of hyperphosphatemia.</p>
    <p num="15">
      The weakly basic anion exchange resins used as a raw material for the manufacture of the medicaments of the present invention are not particularly limited so long as they can adsorb phosphate ions.
      <br/>
      Examples of preferred weakly basic anion exchange resins include polyamine-type resins (including polyamine-type chelating resins) such as reaction products of a styrene/divinylbenzene copolymer and diethylenetriamine or other, and resins as polymerization products of compounds mainly comprising allylamine, vinylamine or other; and acrylic resins such as copolymers of divinylbenzene and amide compounds which comprise acrylic acid or methacrylic acid and dimethylaminopropylamine or other.
      <br/>
      Other resins may also be used in which the aforementioned weakly basic anion exchange resin is partly substituted with strongly basic exchange groups such as trimethylamine, dimethylethanolamine or other.
    </p>
    <p num="16">
      More specifically, known resins which have been used so far for the treatment of water, sugar solutions and other can be used, for example, Diaion WA10, WNA20, WA21 and WA30 (Mitsubishi Chemical), Amberlite IRA-35, IRA-67 (IRA-68).
      <br/>
      IRA-93ZU, IRA-94S, IRA-478 (Organo).
      <br/>
      WGR-2 (Dow Chemical) and other.
    </p>
    <p num="17">The weakly basic anion exchange resins chelating with ferric ions, which are used as an active ingredient of the medicaments of the present invention, can be prepared as resins that are bound to (that adsorb) ferric ions and chloride ions (Cl form), for instance, by stirring the aforementioned weakly basic anion exchange resin in an aqueous solution containing metal salt such as ferric chloride, or alternatively, by charging a column with the resin, passing in aqueous solution containing metal salt such as ferric chloride through the column, and washing the column with water.</p>
    <p num="18">Additionally, the weakly basic anion exchange resin chelating with ferric ions can be prepared as resins that are bound to (that adsorb) ferric ions and hydroxide ions, or resins in which hydroxide ions are further dissociated from the resulting resins (OH form) by treating the resins obtained above (Cl form) with an alkaline solution such as a sodium hydroxide solution to eliminate the chloride ions, and then washing the resins with water.</p>
    <p num="19">
      When the weakly basic anion exchange resin chelating with ferric ions are manufactured according to the aforementioned methods, resins are normally obtained which contain about from 0.2 to 50 mg of iron per gram of a dry resin, although the content may vary depending on types of resins and other.
      <br/>
      However, the contents of iron in the weakly basic anion exchange resins are not limited to the aforementioned range, and the methods for preparing the weakly basic anion exchange resin chelating with ferric ions are not limited to the methods described above.
    </p>
    <p num="20">
      The medicament of the present invention comprises, as an active ingredient, the weakly basic anion exchange resin chelating with ferric ions, preferably the aforementioned resin in the OH form, or may comprise a combination of two or more of the aforementioned resins.
      <br/>
      As the medicaments of the present invention, the aforementioned resin prepared, for example, in spherical or crushed form, per se, may be administered to patients.
      <br/>
      Generally, the medicaments are preferably administered to patients in the form of pharmaceutical compositions which are prepared by using one or more pharmaceutical additives ordinarily used in the art.
      <br/>
      Pharmaceutical compositions in the form of powders, granules, tablets, capsules, for example, may be appropriately chosen.
      <br/>
      For example, after a composition containing a resin chelating with ferric ions (Cl form) is prepared, the composition may be applied with an enteric coating comprising hydroxypropyl methylcellulose phthalate, methacrylic copolymer L or other to use as a pharmaceutical composition.
    </p>
    <p num="21">
      Although not intended to be bound by any specific theory, a mechanism that the medicaments of the present invention exhibit phosphate eliminating effect in vivo can be explained as follows: after oral administration of the weakly basic anion exchange resin, the resin is converted into a form containing chloride ions in the stomach by the binding of chloride ions to nitrogen atoms in the resin (positively charged in gastric juice), or by the substitution of a part or all of hydroxyl groups bound ionically to the resin with chloride ions.
      <br/>
      After then, when the resin in this form reaches in the intestinal tract (weakly basic), the chloride ions are substituted with phosphate ions, and the phosphate ions in the intestinal tract are adsorbed to the resin.
      <br/>
      Simultaneously, the chloride ions substituted with the phosphate ions are returned to the body.
    </p>
    <p num="22">
      A reason that the weakly basic anion exchange resins chelating with ferric ions (especially those in the OH form), active ingredients of the medicaments of the present invention, are preferable may be explained as follows: the weakly basic anion exchange resin chelating with ferric ions has ligands of the iron site, and can efficiently adsorb phosphate ions also by the coordinate bonds.
      <br/>
      Additionally, because highly selective ferric ions are bound to the resin by chelation, the resin does not adsorb useful metal ions existing in the body (iron ion, zinc ion, calcium ion, magnesium ion and other), and can selectively eliminate only phosphate ions without substantially affecting the balance of electrolytes in vivo other than phosphate such as the balance of chloride ions.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, the medicaments of the present invention can selectively adsorb and eliminate only phosphate without substantially adsorbing bile acids including cholic acid, deoxycholic acid, and taurocholic acid.
    </p>
    <p num="23">
      The weakly basic anion exchange resins chelating with ferric ions sometimes desorbs the ferric ions to some extent in an artificial gastric juice: however, it has been verified that no ferric ions are desorbed from the resins in an artificial intestinal juice.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, it is considered that no desorption of ferric ion,s will arise when the medicament of the present invention becomes contact with the intestinal juice, and that almost no affection will be caused by the medicament.
      <br/>
      Moreover, ferric ions are not easily adsorbed in vivo and the irons per se are substantially non-toxic.
      <br/>
      Therefore, it can be considered that, even if a small amount of ferric ions are desorbed from the medicaments of the present invention, the medicaments will not adversely affect a living body.
      <br/>
      Nevertheless, to patients for whom an increase of iron ions is undesired, it is recommendable to administer a pharmaceutical composition obtained by applying an enteric coating on the resins in the Cl form in order to completely inhibit desorption of the ferric ions in the stomach.
    </p>
    <p num="24">
      The active ingredients of the medicaments of the present invention are quite stable chemically and can never be absorbed from the digestive tract.
      <br/>
      Therefore, there is almost no possibility that the medicament might cause adverse effects such as toxicity resulting from the resin, per se.
    </p>
    <p num="25">
      Types of hyperphosphatemia to which the medicaments of the present invention may be applied are not particularly limited.
      <br/>
      The medicaments can be applied to patients with renal dysfunction who need dialysis therapy, e.g., patients with chronic renal failure, for therapeutic and/or preventive treatment of hyperphosphatemia caused by the dialysis therapy.
      <br/>
      The dose of the medicaments of the present invention is not particularly limited.
      <br/>
      Generally, about from 1 to 100 g, preferably about from 5 to 30 g, per day an adult may be administered.

      As shown in Tables 9 and 10, a significant increase in the blood phosphate concentration (1% significant difference in the t-test) was observed, as compared to the normal group, in rats fed with the adenine-containing feed for 4 weeks to generate chronic renal failure and then with the normal feed for 1 week (control group), even after the onset of chronic renal failure.
      <br/>
      In contrast, the blood phosphate concentration was significantly decreased, as compared to the control, in the groups fed with feeds admixed with WA10-Fe or IRA-67-Fe, which were weakly basic anion exchange resins, or precipitated calcium carbonate for 1 week after the onset of chronic renal failure.
    </p>
    <p num="83">From these results, it was revealed that the medicaments of the present invention which comprise a weakly basic anion exchange resin chelating with ferric ions can exert effectiveness on hyperphosphatemia in renal failure by administrations in a progressive stage to onset or after the onset.</p>
    <p num="84">Industrial Applicability</p>
    <p num="85">
      The medicaments of the present invention have excellent adsorbability and selectivity to phosphate ions and efficiently adsorb phosphate ions in vivo, and accordingly, they are useful for therapeutic and/or preventive treatment of hyperphosphatemia.
      <br/>
      The medicaments or the present invention also have an excellent characteristic of no adsorption of ions other than phosphate ions, and they enable effective therapeutic and/or preventive treatment of hyperphosphatemia without affecting the balance of essential metal ions to the body.
