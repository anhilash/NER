      This invention pertains to certain novel catalysts and catalyst support materials and processes for the preparation of the catalyst support materials and for the selective hydrogenation of 3,4-epoxy-1-butene (EpB) to 1,2-epoxybutane (butylene oxide--BO).
      <br/>
      More specifically, this invention pertains to (1) catalyst support materials having micropores filled with one or more inorganic oxides, (2) a process for the preparation of such catalyst support materials, (3) supported catalysts comprising one or more Group VIII metals deposited on the aforesaid support materials and (4) a process for the selective hydrogenation of EpB to BO using a catalyst comprising rhodium deposited of the aforesaid catalyst support materials.
    </p>
    <p num="2">
      U.S. Pat. No. 4,897,498 describes an efficient process for the preparation of EpB by the selective monoepoxidation of butadiene.
      <br/>
      Butylene oxide, which is one of many compounds which may be obtained from EpB, is useful in the manufacture of polyethers, alkylene glycols, aminoalkanols, epoxy resins, urethane polyols and nonionic surfactants and as a stabilizer for chlorinated hydrocarbons and fuel additive.

      According to Rylander, Catalytic Hydrogenation Over Platinum Metals, Academic Press, New York, page 478 (1967), epoxides, with a few exceptions (Berson and Suzuki, J. Am. Chem. Soc., 80, 4341 �1958�), readily undergo hydrogenolysis over platinum metal catalysts and the major product is usually an alcohol or mixture of alcohols resulting from cleavage of a carbon-oxygen bond; other products may arise by cleavage of the carbon-carbon bond and by loss of the oxygen function.
      <br/>
      The catalytic hydrogenation of EpB to butyraldehyde over palladium and to 1-butanol over Raney nickel is described in U.S. Pat. No. 2,561,984. No mention is made of the use of rhodium catalysts nor the observation of BO formation.
      <br/>
      The hydrogenation of EpB also has been reported by Russian workers in Zh.

      In this literature example, however, the epoxide is trisubstituted and less prone to hydrogenolysis due to steric hindrance.

      The significance of the conjugated system existing in EpB is demonstrated by Raney nickel-catalyzed hydrogenation of EpB and 1,2-epoxy-7-octene under mild conditions of 50 (degree)  C. and 3.5 bar total pressure.

      The hydrogenation of EpB gives 40.5% 1,2-epoxybutane and 58.4% 1-butanol whereas the hydrogenation of 1,2-epoxy-7-octene, wherein the double bond and epoxy group are separated by 4 carbon atoms, gives 94.4% 1,2-epoxyoctane.

      U.S. Pat. No. 5,077,418 and 5,117,013 disclose the preparation of BO by hydrogenating EpB in the presence of a supported rhodium catalyst.
      <br/>
      Although the supported rhodium catalysts disclosed in the '418 and '013 patents give excellent selectivities to BO, it has been found that the activity of the catalysts decreases substantially when the catalysts are used to hydrogenate EpB over extended periods of time, e.g., hydrogenation periods in excess of 20 hours or greater.
      <br/>
      This partial but substantial deactivation of the catalysts represents a severe impediment to the use of the supported rhodium catalysts disclosed in the '418 and '013 patents in a commercial (continuous) process.

    <p num="6">
      German Published Patent Application DE 195 32 645 A1 discloses the preparation of BO by catalytic hydrogenation of EpB in the presence of a heterogeneous catalyst comprising one or more catalytically-active elements of Groups 7 to 11 (Cu, Rh, Ru, Co, Ni, Pd and Pt) which are vapor-deposited under vacuum conditions on oxidized, metal mesh supports.
      <br/>
      Oxidation of the wire mesh support was conducted at 600 to 1100 (degree)  C. Vacuum deposition of catalytically-active components such as elements of Groups 7 to 11 is very expensive and requires extended periods of time.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, the catalytically-active component is very inefficiently distributed on the oxidized, wire mesh support which has a very low surface area, e.g. typically 1 square meter per gram (m2 /g) as compared to 20 to 100 m2 /g for conventional catalyst supports.
      <br/>
      These catalysts require very long reaction times for batch processes or very long contact times for continuous operation to achieve acceptable conversions of EpB.
      <br/>
      Catalysts prepared according to the above-described methodology described in DE 195 32 645 A1 were prepared and used to hydrogenate EpB to BO.
      <br/>
      At a reaction temperature of 50 (degree)  C., reaction times of 2 to 8 hours were required to convert EpB to BO in selective yields.

      We have discovered that EpB may be selectively hydrogenated at high rates in the presence of certain supported rhodium catalysts whereby the olefinic unsaturation is hydrogenated without significant hydrogenolysis of the conjugated epoxy group to produce BO without substantial loss of activity over extended periods of operation.
      <br/>
      The rhodium catalysts which exhibit good to excellent catalytic activity over extended periods of operation comprise rhodium deposited on an inert catalyst support material having micropores blocked or filled with an inorganic oxide.

      (4) A process for the manufacture of BO which comprises contacting EpB and hydrogen in the presence of a catalyst comprising rhodium metal deposited on the catalyst support material of embodiment (1).
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      The first embodiment of the present invention comprises a catalyst support material containing micropores blocked or filled with one or more inorganic oxides.
      <br/>
      These modified catalyst support materials may be obtained from any of the large number of conventional, porous, refractory catalyst carriers or support materials which are essentially inert in the presence of the reactants used and the product or products obtained from the processes in which catalysts prepared from the modified support materials are employed.
      <br/>
      Such conventional materials may be of natural or synthetic origin and preferably are of a macroporous structure, although even support materials which are considered macroporous always contain a certain and often significant fraction of micropores.
      <br/>
      These support materials typically have an apparent porosity of greater than 20%.
      <br/>
      Supports having a siliceous and/or aluminous composition are, in general, preferred.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      Specific examples of suitable supports are the aluminum oxides (including the materials sold under the trade name "Alundum"), charcoal, pumice, magnesia, zirconia, kieselguhr, fuller's earth, silicon carbide, porous agglomerates comprising silicon and/or silicon carbide, silica, selected clays, and artificial and natural ceramics.
      <br/>
      Refractory supports particularly useful in the preparation of catalysts in accordance with this invention comprise materials having low acidity, e.g., those described by Kozo Tanabe, Solid Acids and Bases, pp. 1-28, Academic Press, New York, 1970.  ALPHA -Alumina and, especially, silica are particularly preferred.
      <br/>
      The unmodified support materials have a specific surface area of about 5 to 100, preferably 7 to 80, and most preferably 10 to 50 square meters per gram (m2 /g) as measured by the B.E.T. method and an apparent porosity as measured by conventional mercury or water absorption techniques of from about 25 to about 50% by volume.
      <br/>
      The B.E.T. method for determining specific surface area is described in detail in Brunauer, S., Emmet, P. H., and Teller, E., J. Am. Chem. Soc., 60, 309-16 (1938).
      <br/>
      The unmodified support materials useful in the present invention contain micropores which constitute less than about 50%, preferably about 0.5 to 30%, and most preferably about 0.5 to 20%, of the total surface area of the support material.
      <br/>
      Mesopores and macropores constitute about 50 to 90% of the total surface area of the support material.
    </p>
    <p num="11">
      As used herein, the term "micropores" means pores less than a particular diameter (commonly expressed in Angstroms), typically less than 50  Angstrom .
      <br/>
      The unmodified support materials contain micropores (critical diameters of about 25-50  Angstrom , mesopores, and macropores.
      <br/>
      There are no clear definitions of diameter size ranges for mesopores and macropores.
      <br/>
      A detailed description of pore analysis and catalyst supports is presented by Thomas and Thomas, Introduction to the Principles of Heterogeneous Catalysis, Academic Press, London (1967 pp. 180-240. The size of 25  Angstrom  often is used since analytical methods of pore analysis tyupically use the value of 25A in the calculation of cumulative pore volumes and surface areas of micropores to define the physical properties of catalyst supports.
    </p>
    <p num="12">
      The actual physical form of the catalyst support material is not particularly important.
      <br/>
      While the form of the support material has little effect on catalyst activity, practical considerations such as ease of heat transfer, mass transfer, pressure drop due to fluid flow restrictions, efficiency of gas-liquid-solid contacting, catalyst durability, and the like make the use of defined shapes such as spheres, pellets, extrudates, rings, saddles, stars and the like preferred.
      <br/>
      For conventional, commercial, fixed-bed reactors used in continuous, liquid- and vapor-phase processes, e.g., trickle bed hydrogenation processes and fixed-bed, vapor-phase feed processes, the reactors typically are in the form of a plurality of parallel elongated tubes (in a suitable shell) approximately 1 to 2 inches in diameter and 10 to 50 feet long filled with catalyst.
      <br/>
      In such reactors, it is desirable to employ a support formed into a rounded shape, such as, for example, spheres, pellets, rings, tablets, stars and the like, having diameters of from about 0.1 inch to about 0.8 inch.
    </p>
    <p num="13">
      The catalyst support materials of the present invention are characterized by the presence therein of micropores which are blocked or filled with one or more inorganic oxides.
      <br/>
      Examples of the inorganic oxides are metal oxides which have essentially no acidic character such as oxides of the alkali metals, alkaline earth metals and lanthanides.
      <br/>
      The alkaline earth metal oxides, especially magnesium oxide, are preferred because of their superior hydrolytic stability.
      <br/>
      At least 25%, preferably at least 75%, of the total micropore volume is blocked by or filled with the inorganic oxides.
      <br/>
      The catalyst support materials of the present invention may be prepared by the steps of (i) contacting or immersing a catalyst support material containing micropores in a solution of one or more soluble inorganic salts such as, for example, soluble salts of the alkali metals, alkaline earth metals and lanthanides; (ii) drying the solution-impregnated catalyst support material produced in step (i); and (iii) calcining the material produced in step (ii) under conditions which convert the soluble inorganic salt to an insoluble inorganic oxide, thereby blocking (capping and/or filling micropores present in the catalyst support material.
      <br/>
      Examples of soluble salts include nitrates; hydroxides; carboxylates, e.g., acetates, oxalates, and the like; halides, e.g., chlorides, etc.
      <br/>
      The liquid component or phase of the solution may be selected from various inert (non-reactive) liquids such as water, alkanols, aliphatic glycols, aliphatic glycol mono- and di-ethers, amines or a mixture of and two or more such liquids.
      <br/>
      Step (i) of the process typically is carried out by first determining the micropore volume for a given quantity of catalyst support material according to procedures known to those skilled in the art.
      <br/>
      For example, micropore volume may be determined by using the mathematical analysis of liquid nitrogen condensation and filling of pores of support material.
      <br/>
      From the volume of liquid nitrogen required to fill pores and the amount of liquid nitrogen released when the pores are emptied, it is possible to calculate both the distribution of pore diameters and the total volume of pores within a particular pore diameter.
      <br/>
      Thus, this method can be used to calculate the total volume of pores having diameters less than 50  Angstrom .
      <br/>
      The mathematical procedure is defined as the Barrett, Joyner and Halenda (BTH) method and is fully described by Barrett, E. P., Joyner, L. S., and Halenda, P. P., J. Am. Chem.Soc., 93, 373-380 (1951).
    </p>
    <p num="14">
      To ensure micropore filling by inorganic salts, the total volume of micropores of a particular sample was calculated using the BJH method.
      <br/>
      These data were used to prepare an inorganic salt solution, which contained dissolved inorganic salt in an amount calculated to yield a volume of inorganic oxide that would be slightly in excess of the amount required to fill all the micropores upon decomposition of said salt.
      <br/>
      The volume occupied by dried inorganic, metal salts is equal to the mass of inorganic salt divided by the density of the salt, wherein density is defined as grams of salt per mL of salt.
      <br/>
      The appropriate amount of inorganic salt may be dissolved in a quantity of liquid, which approximates the total micropore volume of the support material to be treated in step (i).
      <br/>
      All, or essentially all, of the inorganic salt solution is absorbed by and into the micropores of the catalyst support material employed in step (i).
      <br/>
      Normally, the amount of inorganic salt employed in step (i) should be limited to the amount necessary to block only the micropores, i.e., significant blocking of the meso- and macro-pores should be avoided.
      <br/>
      Upon addition of the inorganic salt solution, the filling of the pores is facilitated by capillary action.
      <br/>
      The capillary wicking action also facilitates the preferential deposition of the inorganic salt into the micropores as the solvent is removed by evaporation.
      <br/>
      The solvent evaporates from the larger pores first, leaving the salt concentrated in the solution remaining in the smaller pores.
      <br/>
      This process continues until all of the solvent has been removed, with the result that the salt is preferentially concentrated in the micropores.
      <br/>
      This process may be enhanced and improved by using the methodology, commonly known to those skilled in the art, as vacuum impregnation.
      <br/>
      By first evacuating air out of the support to be impregnated in a suitable vessel, the capillary action is not impeded by the presence of air trapped in the micropores.
    </p>
    <p num="15">
      Step (ii) may be carried out using conventional procedures and equipment.
      <br/>
      For example, the solution-impregnated catalyst support may be dried by loading it on trays and placing it in a forced air oven.
      <br/>
      Or, preferably, for commercial operation, by feeding the material to a continuous vibratory screen type drier.
      <br/>
      The dried material obtained from step (ii) then is calcined to convert the soluble inorganic salt to an insoluble, inorganic oxide.
      <br/>
      The step (iii) calcination may be performed by heating the material from step (ii) at a temperature of about 200 to 700 (degree)  C., preferably about 300 to 500 (degree)  C., while passing a gas over and/or through the catalyst support material.
      <br/>
      When the soluble inorganic salt is a hydroxide or nitrate, the gas may be an inert (nonreactive) gas such as nitrogen, helium, carbon dioxide, and the like or the gas may contain oxygen.
      <br/>
      When using other soluble inorganic salts, e.g., carboxylates or halides, the gas should be an molecular oxygen-containing gas such as air, oxygen-enriched air or an inert gas containing molecular oxygen.
      <br/>
      The duration of the step (iii) calcination can vary depending on the type of soluble inorganic salt employed but typically is in the range of about 30 to 120 minutes.
    </p>
    <p num="16">
      The novel catalysts provided by our invention comprise one or more Group VIII metals deposited on a catalyst support material containing micropores blocked with one or more inorganic oxides, i.e., the catalyst support material of embodiment (1).
      <br/>
      The concentration of Group VIII metal on the catalysts can vary substantially depending, for example, on the particular metal employed and/or the particular chemical process in which the catalyst will be utilized.
      <br/>
      For example, the amount of Group VIII metal present may be in the range of 0.01 to 10 weight percent based on the total weight of the catalyst.
      <br/>
      However, the Group VIII metal more typically is present in a concentration of about 0.1 to 5 weight percent (same basis).
      <br/>
      Palladium, platinum, ruthenium, iridium, and, especially, rhodium represent the preferred Group VIII metals.
    </p>
    <p num="17">
      The novel supported Group VIII metal catalysts may be prepared in a manner analogous to the process used to prepare the pore-blocked catalyst support material.
      <br/>
      For example, the catalysts may be prepared by the steps comprising (1) contacting (immersing) the catalyst support material of embodiment (i) in a solution of a soluble Group VIII, (2) drying the material from step (1), and (3) reducing the catalyst precursor from step (2) at a temperature in the range of about 50 to 800 (degree) C. in the presence of a hydrogen-containing gas to convert the Group VIII metal salt to the Group VIII metal.
      <br/>
      As an illustration, a catalyst precursor comprising about two weight percent rhodium chloride on a support may be converted to an active catalyst by first, drying the catalyst precursor at a temperature ranging from 100 to 150 (degree)  C. in air or a gas stream containing oxygen, oxygen fortified air, or oxygen plus inert gaseous components and then, optionally, further heating, or calcining, the precursor at a temperature in the range of 300 to 1000 (degree)  C. in the presence of a gas consisting of air, oxygen fortified air, or a 0:100 to 100:0 oxygenlinert gas mixture, and then finally heating at a temperature in the range of 50 to 800 (degree)  C. in the presence of hydrogen/inert gas to convert the rhodium salt to metallic rhodium.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, the last step involving the reduction of the rhodium salt, or rhodium oxide, to metallic rhodium may be accomplished by using a solution containing a chemical reducing agent, such as sodium formate at temperatures ranging from 25 to 100 (degree)  C. for 10 to 60 minutes.

      A process for the manufacture of BO which comprises contacting EpB and hydrogen in the presence of a catalyst comprising rhodium metal deposited on the catalyst support material of embodiment (1) under hydrogenation conditions of pressure and temperature constitutes the fourth embodiment of the present invention.
      <br/>
      The hydrogenation of EpB in the presence of a supported rhodium catalyst prepared as described herein results in the selective hydrogenation of the olefinic unsaturation without significant hydrogenolysis of the conjugated epoxy group.
      <br/>
      As compared to prior art catalysts, the supported rhodium catalysts described herein maintain their catalytic activity in converting EpB to BO over extended periods of operation.
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      The hydrogenation conditions of temperature and pressure can vary substantially depending on several factors such as contact time with the rhodium catalyst, the amount of catalyst, the amount of rhodium present on the support and the mode of operation.
      <br/>
      Hydrogenation temperatures of about 20 to 150 (degree)  C. may be used although milder temperatures in the range of about 25 to 80 (degree)  C. are advantageous to maximize conversion to the desired BO and minimize conversion to alcohols and aldehydes.
      <br/>
      The hydrogenation process may be carried out using total pressures in the range of about 0 to 345 bar gauge (barg), preferably about 2 to 56 barg.
      <br/>
      As noted above, the optimum combination of temperature and pressure depends on other process variables but can be readily ascertained by those skilled in the art.
      <br/>
      The catalyst utilized in the hydrogenation process preferably comprises a silica support, modified as described herein, containing about 0.25 to 2.0 weight percent rhodium, based on the total weight of the catalyst, deposited thereon.
    </p>
    <p num="20">
      The hydrogenation process of this invention optionally may be carried out in the presence of an inert, organic solvent.
      <br/>
      Examples of such solvents include aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons such as heptane, cyclohexane, toluene, xylene and mixed xylene isomers; alkanols such as ethanol; ethers such as tetrahydrofuran; and the reaction products resulting from the hydrogenation of EpB, e.g., BO, butanol, butyraldehyde or a mixture of any 2 or more thereof.
      <br/>
      The process may be carried out in a batch, semi-continuous or continuous mode of operation.
      <br/>
      For example, batch operation may comprise agitating a slurry of a rhodium catalyst in EpB and, optionally, a solvent in a pressure vessel for a time sufficient to convert essentially all of the unsaturated epoxide to other compounds.
      <br/>
      The catalyst can be separated from the hydrogenated mixture by filtration and the components of the filtrate separated by distillation.
    </p>
    <p num="21">
      A preferred mode of operation uses a fixed bed of a supported rhodium catalyst wherein EpB is hydrogenated in the gas or, especially, liquid phase, optionally in the presence of an inert diluent or solvent.
      <br/>
      Liquid phase operation typically involves feeding a solution of EpB in an inert solvent-diluent to the top of a tubular, pressure reactor containing one or more fixed beds of a supported rhodium catalyst.
      <br/>
      The reactant solution flows (trickles) over the catalyst bed in the presence of hydrogen at elevated temperature and pressure and the hydrogenated product exits the bottom of the reactor and is separated into its components by distillation or extraction.
      <br/>
      The feed rates employed in liquid phase operation may be in the range of about 0.01 to 100 liquid hour space velocities (LHSV, unit volume of feed per unit volume of catalyst).
      <br/>
      Under most conditions, the LHSV will be in the range of about 0.1 to 10. Similar reaction conditions may be used when carrying out the process in the gas phase mode.
      <br/>
      Diluents for the process feed include inert gases as well as hydrogen.
      <br/>
      The maximum concentration of EpB vapor in the gas feed stream is controlled by the saturation vapor pressure of EpB at the reaction temperature.
      <br/>
      For a reaction temperature of 50 (degree)  C., the maximum vapor pressure of EpB is approximately 400 Torr or less partial pressure.
      <br/>
      The total feed rates for operation as a gas feed, fixed-bed reactor may be in the range of 100 to 20,000 space velocities (gas hourly space velocity--GHSV, unit volume of feed per unit volume of catalyst per hour), more preferably a GHSV in the range of 200 to 20,000.

      The procedure described in Comparative Hydrogenation Example 3 was repeated using a catalyst bed consisting of a mixture of 0.101 gram of the catalyst of Catalyst Example 3 (consisting of 1 weight percent rhodium deposited on a silica support which had been treated to block the micropores of the silica with lanthanum oxide) and 0.402 gram of an inert silica catalyst support material (to increase the volume of heated catalyst bed).
      <br/>
      Both the catalyst and the support diluent were sieved to give particles ranging in size from 410 to 840 microns (0.0164-0.0331 inches) in diameter.
      <br/>
      Reaction temperature was maintained at 40 (degree)  C. by a recirculating water-ethylene glycol bath inside a jacket that enclosed the tubular reactor.
      <br/>
      Before reaction, the catalyst was reduced in a stream composed of 20:80 hydrogen : nitrogen mixture at atmosphere pressure for 2 hours at 225 (degree)  C. Following reduction, the catalyst was cooled to reaction temperature in the same gas flow stream.
      <br/>
      Nitrogen was then removed from the feed stream and the sample pressurized under flowing hydrogen to a reaction pressure of 6.8 barg.
      <br/>
      The composition of the feed was 1.4 mole percent EpB in hydrogen.
      <br/>
      Conversion of EpB under these conditions from 3.0 hours to 66.2 hours of reaction time decreased from 50.4% to 45.0% while selectivity varied from 86.4% to 87.5% EpB over the same time interval.
      <br/>
      These results, in which conversion decreased only marginally, indicate that La2 O3 had satisfactorily been deposited in and had filled the micropores of the silica support material prior to the deposition of a rhodium salt onto the modified silica support.

      The composition of the feed was varied from 1.3 to 2.1 mole percent EpB in hydrogen.
      <br/>
      The process conditions and parameters employed and the results achieved are set forth in Table V wherein "Temp"is reactor temperature in  (degree) C., "EpB Conc" is the mole percent concentration of EpB in hydrogen fed to the reactor, "Time Interval" is the period of process operating time, in hours, for a particular combination of conditions/parameters, and "Select" is the percent selectivity to BO. "Contact Time" is the statistical length of time (in seconds) that the reactant gas is in contact with the catalyst particles.
      <br/>
      Contract time is changed by modifying the gas flow rates of the EpB vapor plus hydrogen feed gases that contact the catalyst. "EpB Conv" is the conversion of EpB fed to the reactor at the reaction conditions/parameters stated for the particular Time Interval indicated.
      <br/>
      For those Time Intervals for which 2 values are given for EpB Conv, the first value is initial conversion and the second value is the final conversion

      The results reported in Table V show that catalyst activity is relatively constant, with only slight decreases in EpB conversion, during the first fifty hours of reaction time.
      <br/>
      After 50 hours of reaction time, catalyst activity remains constant at the modified reaction conditions.
      <br/>
      The decrease in catalyst activity from 3-22 hours of reaction time is only 13.7% relative to the initial activity of 22% EpB conversion.
      <br/>
      The decrease in catalyst activity from 23-50 hours is only 15.3% relative to the initial activity of 26% conversion.
      <br/>
      These decreases in catalytic activities are far less severe than the performance of Comparison Examples 3 and 4,indicating that MgO has successfully blocked the micropores of the silica support and prevented deposition of the Rh salts during impregnation of Rh component.
      <br/>
      The constant catalyst activities from 51 4 69 hours, 70  --&gt; 72 hours, and 73 --&gt; 106 hours of reaction time illustrate that micropore filling by MgO gives long term, stable catalysts that have high selectivity.
