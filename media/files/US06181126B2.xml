      <br/>
      Field of the Invention
    </p>
    <p num="4">This invention relates to measuring instruments utilizing a variable color digital display.</p>
    <p num="5">2. Description of the Prior Art</p>
    <p num="6">
      A display device described in U.S. Pat. No. 3,740,570, issued on Jun. 19, 1973 to George R. Kaelin et al., uses special LEDs that exhibit different colors when subjected to different currents.
      <br/>
      The LEDs are biased by pulses of different amplitudes, to achieve different colors of the display, and by the length inversely proportional to the pulse amplitude, to compensate for variable brightness of the display caused by different amplitudes of the pulses.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      A circuit employing a dual-color LED driven by a dual timer is described in the article by Bill Wagner entitled 2-color LED+driver=versatile visual effects, published on Oct. 2, 1980 in EDN volume 25, No. 19, page 164.
      <br/>
      Since dual-color LEDs are connected to conduct currents in opposite directions, it would be impossible to forwardly bias them simultaneously.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      An electronic display having segments wherein each segment is capable of selectively illuminating two colors is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,488,149 issued on Dec. 11, 1984 to William A. Givens, Jr.
      <br/>
      Two AND gates are provided for biasing, in each display segment, either a first light emitting diode, for emitting a first color, or a second light emitting diode, for emitting a second color.
      <br/>
      It is not contemplated to illuminate both light emitting diodes in each segment simultaneously for blending the colors.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      A multi-colour LED display for seven segment figures is disclosed in German Patent No. 3,009,416 issued on Sep. 17, 1981 to Klaus Gillessen.
      <br/>
      The LED circuit consists of seven group of diodes, each group made up of two diodes, one red and one green.
      <br/>
      The cathodes of all red diodes are terminated in a common connection, and the green ones likewise, the anodes of each pair of diodes being common for that pair.
      <br/>
      Two transistors connected in cascade are utilized for activating either all green LEDs, or all red LEDs, but not both simultaneously.
      <br/>
      When a low level signal is applied to the base of the first transistor, the first transistor is blocked, and the second transistor is turned ON to illuminate the second set of the diodes.
      <br/>
      When a high level signal is applied to the input of the first transistor, the first transistor is turned ON, while the second transistor is blocked, whereby the first set of the diodes is illuminated.
      <br/>
      Since the first transistor cannot be simultaneously turned ON and OFF, it would be impossible to illuminate the two sets of the diodes simultaneously.
      <br/>
      In another embodiment is shown a multi-colour LED display utilizing three sets of LEDs: red, green, and blue, which are respectively commonly connected and may be activated by manual switches.
      <br/>
      It is not contemplated that the three sets of LEDs be activated in selective combinations to blend the colors.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      A digital electrooptical display with anti-parallel light emitting diodes is disclosed in East German Patent No. 220,844 issued on Apr. 10, 1985 to Thomas Hoffmann et al.
      <br/>
      Two light emitting diodes for emitting light of different colors are connected in each segment back-to-back.
      <br/>
      Since the light emitting diodes are connected to conduct currents in opposite directions, it would be impossible to illuminate them simultaneously, because the opposite currents attempting to pass through a single conductor would cancel.
    </p>

      A system for measuring radioactivity is described in U.S. Pat. No. 2,643,344, issued on Jun. 23, 1953 to Ian H. McLaren et al.
      <br/>
      Another systems for measuring radioactivity are described in U.S. Pat. No. 2,648,015 issued on Aug. 4, 1953 to Alexander Greenfield et al., and in U.S. Pat. No. 2,682,000 issued on Jun. 22, 1954 to Joseph F. Clayton et al.
      <br/>
      Since these three patents are very similar, they are equally authoritative.
      <br/>
      The system for measuring radioactivity, disclosed in the three patents, includes an analog pointer indicator having three scales, with three associated colored light bulbs, for indicating which scale is applicable for the reading of the measured value.
      <br/>
      A mechanism for automatic range selection is provided, which is controlled by two solenoids, and which also controls the three associated colored light bulbs.
      <br/>
      In response to the range selection, one of the light bulbs illuminates the indicator face with a distinctive color to indicate which measurement scale is applicable.
    </p>
    <p num="12">
      A digital meter is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 2,889,518, issued on Jun. 2, 1959 to Harold R. Hudson et al.
      <br/>
      The digital meter includes a motor, a wheel counter rotatable by the motor, a potentiometer rotatable by the motor, and a mechanical sampler (vibrator).
      <br/>
      An unknown voltage is compared, by the sampler, with an instant reference voltage that appears on the wiper of the potentiometer.
      <br/>
      The motor keeps rotating the potentiometer until the unknown voltage is equal to the reference voltage.
      <br/>
      The rotation of the motor is then automatically stopped, which also stops the wheel counter, whose position numerically indicates the value of the measured voltage.
      <br/>
      The decimal point monochromatic lamps are placed between the wheels of the counter.
      <br/>
      One of the decimal point lamps is illuminated, by manually operated range switch, to indicate by its position the selected measurement range.

    <heading>DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
    <p num="26">Referring now, more particularly, to the drawings, in FIG. 1 is shown a block diagram of a typical prior art digital display system which usually includes a device 10a for developing digital data, a suitable decoder 20 for converting the digital data into a displayable code, and a monochromatic digital display 30 for indicating the digital data visually.</p>
    <p num="27">
      As shown in FIG. 2, the present invention resides in the substitution of a commercially well known monochromatic digital display with a variable color digital display 40, and in the addition of a color control circuit 50 for controlling the color of display 40.
      <br/>
      The variable color digital display system of this invention can simultaneously indicate the values of two different quantities, from the outputs of respective devices 10b, 10c, by causing the value of the first quantity to be indicated on display 40 in digital format, and by controlling the color of display 40 in accordance with the value of the second quantity.
    </p>
    <p num="28">In FIG. 3 is shown a block diagram of another embodiment of a variable color digital display system of the present invention, characterized by a step variable color control circuit 51.</p>
    <p num="29">In FIG. 4 is shown a block diagram of still another embodiment of variable color digital display system, characterized by a continuously variable color control circuit 56.</p>
    <p num="30">
      In FIG. 5 is shown a block diagram of a 2-primary color display system including a commercially well known 7-segment display decoder driver 22, a variable color 7-segment display element 42, and a 2-primary color control logic circuit 52.
      <br/>
      The decoder driver 22 accepts a 4-bit BCD (binary coded decimal) code at its inputs A0, A1, A2, A3 and develops output drive signals at its outputs a, b, c, d, e, f, g, and DP (decimal point) to drive respective segments of 7-segment display element 42.
      <br/>
      The color control circuit 52 accepts color control logic signals at its inputs R (red), Y (yellow), and G (green) and develops at its outputs drive signals for red bus 5 and green bus 6, respectively, to illuminate display element 42 in a selected color.
    </p>
    <p num="31">
      In FIG. 6 is shown a block diagram of a 3-primary color display system including a 7-segment display decoder driver 22, variable color 7-segment display element 43, and a 3-primary color control logic circuit 53.
      <br/>
      The color control circuit 53 accepts color control logic signals at its inputs R (red), Y (yellow), G (green), BG (blue-green), B (blue), P (purple), and W (white) and develops at its outputs drive signals for red bus 5, green bus 6, and blue bus 7, respectively, to illuminate display element 43 in a selected color.

      In FIG. 7, the 2-primary color display element includes seven elongated display segments a, b, c, d, e, f, and g, arranged in a conventional pattern, which may be selectively energized in different combinations to display the desired digits.
      <br/>
      Each display segment includes a pair of LEDs (light emitting diodes): red LED 2 and green LED 3, which are closely adjacent such that the light signals emitted therefrom are substantially superimposed upon each other to mix the colors.
      <br/>
      To facilitate the illustration, the LEDs are designated by segment symbols, e.g., the red LED in the segment a is designated as 2a, etc.
    </p>
    <p num="33">
      In FIG. 8, red LED 2e and green LED 3e are placed on the base of a segment body 15a which is filled with a transparent light scattering material 16.
      <br/>
      When forwardly biased, LEDs 2e and 3e emit light signals of red and green colors, respectively, which are scattered within transparent material 16, thereby blending the red and green light signals into a composite light signal that emerges at the upper surface of segment body 15a.
      <br/>
      The color of the composite light signal may be controlled by varying the portions of the red and green light signals.

    <p num="34">In FIG. 9, each display segment of the 3-primary color display element includes a triad of LEDs: red LED 2, green LED 3, and blue LED 4, which are closely adjacent such that the light signals emitted therefrom are substantially superimposed upon one another to mix the colors.</p>

      <br/>
      Red LEDs are typically manufactured by diffusing a p-n junction into a GaAsP epitaxial layer on a GaAs substrate; green LEDs typically use a GaP epitaxial layer on a GaP substrate; blue LEDs are typically made from SiC material.

      The negative pulse at the TC output of counter 71f, which is connected to the Clear Direct input CD of flip-flop 73, causes the latter to be reset and to remain in its reset condition until it is set again at the beginning of the next 256-count cycle.

      It is thus obvious that the Q output of flip-flop 73 is at a high logic level for a period of time proportional to the data initially loaded into counter 71f.

      By referring now, more particularly, to the timing diagram shown in FIG. 34, in which the waveforms are compressed to facilitate the illustration, the EXAMPLE 1 considers the memory data `FD`, in a standard hexadecimal notation, to generate light of substantially red color.

      Commercially known digital multimeters are capable of indicating negative measured results, by displaying a small negative sign at the most significant digit, and positive measured results, usually by not displaying the minus sign.

      When a series of measurements is performed, it is difficult to distinguish between the positive and negative measurement results displayed on a long character string, particularly when the measurements are performed at a relatively fast rate.
      <br/>
      In FIG. 55 is shown how this problem may be effectively solved by displaying positive and negative measurement results in respectively different colors on a 31/2 digit common cathodes variable color display 48, which is capable of displaying a minus sign by illuminating the segment g in the most significant digit.

      When the POL output is at a low logic level, to indicate that the displayed number is positive, the minus sign is extinguished.

      A low logic level at the POL output forces the output of the inverter 151a to rise to a high logic level, to activate the color control input G, to thereby illuminate display 48 in green color.

      The description of a variable color digital display system shown in FIG. 56, which is capable of emphasizing the position of a decimal point in a string of digits, should be considered together with its accompanying timing diagram shown in FIG. 57. The display system, which in its exemplary embodiment utilizes eight single-digit variable color displays 46a to 46h, which are only partially shown, is capable of detecting the position of decimal point in a string of displayed digits and of displaying all digits that precede the decimal point in a first color and all digits that follow the decimal point in a second color.
      <br/>
      The decimal point outputs DP of common-cathodes 7-segment decoders 23a to 23h, which may receive displayable data in a conventional manner (not shown), are continuously scanned in a sequence by a multiplexer 146 which is incremented by a counter 162d driven by clock 199j of a suitable frequency.
      <br/>
      When an active high DP output is detected on certain of the decoders 23a to 23h, the inverting output W of multiplexer 146, which is connected to the set direct input SD of DP flip-flop 138j, drops to a low logic level 199n, to force the latter to its set condition.
      <br/>
      The Q output of DP flip-flop 138j, which is connected to the D inputs of all flip-flops 138b to 138h, rises to a high logic level for the remaining time of the scanning cycle, to thereby indicate, as may be best observed in FIG. 57 in the line designated F--F 138j Q OUTPUT at waveform 199p, the position of the detected decimal point in reference to the scanning cycle.
      <br/>
      A decoder 166 is incremented synchronously with the multiplexer 146, and, as a result, its outputs Y0 to Y7 are sequentially driven to a low logic level, to trigger in a sequence flip-flops 138b to 138h to states determined by the conditions of their D inputs, respectively, at the time of triggering, as may be best observed in FIG. 57 in the lines designated DEC 166 OUTPUTS Y0 to Y7 at waveforms 190a to 199h.
      <br/>
      All flip-flops 138b to 138h, which were triggered before the decimal point was located during the scanning cycle, are triggered to their reset states, while all remaining flip-flops 138b to 138h, which were triggered after the decimal point was located, are triggered to their set states.
      <br/>
      The Y7 output of the decoder 166 is connected to the clear direct input CD of the DP flip-flop 138j, to force the latter to its reset condition at the end of each scanning cycle.
      <br/>
      The outputs Q and Q of flip-flops 138b to 138h are respectively connected to color control inputs R and G of the color control circuits 52b to 52h, to thereby cause all display digits 46b to 46h that precede the instant decimal point to be illuminated in green color, and all remaining display digits that follow the decimal point to be illuminated in red color.
      <br/>
      It would be obvious that other color combinations may be devised.

      <br/>
      The decimal point outputs DP of all common-cathode 7-segment decoders 23a to 23h are respectively connected to the inputs of an OR gate 154.
      <br/>
      When decimal point is present in the displayed digital string, the appropriate DP output rises to a high logic level, thereby forcing the non-inverting output of OR gate 154, which is connected to interconnected color control inputs R of all color control circuits 52a to 52h, to rise to a high logic level, to thereby cause all displays 46a to 46h to illuminate in red color.

      The BCD codes for the respective digits are converted, by 7-segment decoders 22a, 22b, 22c, 22d, to signals for directly energizing the segments of the variable color display digits 42a, 42b, 42c, 42d, respectively, in a manner well understood by those skilled in the art.
      <br/>
      The color control circuit 50 causes all four display digits to illuminate uniformly in a selected color, as previously described.

    <p num="137">A like block diagram shown in FIG. 74 differs in that four color control circuits 50a, 50b, 50c, 50d are employed to independently control the colors of respective display digits 42a, 42b, 42c, 42d.</p>

      In FIG. 75 is shown, in a block diagram configuration, a multimeter utilizing two digital voltmeters 109a and 109b for measuring respective INPUT SIGNALS 1 and 2.

      <br/>
      In order to clearly distinguish between the two measured values, without the need for a visual gap therebetween, the color control circuit 52a is adapted, by having its color control input G connected to a high logic level, to illuminate the four most significant display digits D1 to D4 in green color, and like color control circuit 52b is adapted, by having its color control input R connected to a high logic level, to illuminate the four least significant digits D5 to D8 in red color.

      FIG. 76 is a block diagram of an RMS digital voltmeter with variable color crest factor indication.
      <br/>
      The RMS (Root Mean Square) value of the measured waveform is its heating value when applied to a resistor; it indicates the magnitude of the measured waveform regardless of its shape.
      <br/>
      The Crest Factor is the peak signal value divided by the RMS value; it indicates what type of a waveform it is.
    </p>
    <p num="140">
      The digital voltmeter includes an RMS converter 181 for converting an input measured signal to a DC value representative of the energy content of the measured signal.
      <br/>
      The DC value from the RMS converter 181 is applied to the HI input terminal of a digital voltmeter 105 which develops at its outputs signals to directly drive variable color digital display 40, to thereby indicate the measured RMS value in digital format, in a manner well known to those having ordinary skill in the art.
    </p>
    <p num="141">
      The invention resides in the addition of a crest factor converter 183 for computing the crest factor value of the measured waveform, and of a color converter 55 for controlling the color of display 40 in accordance with the crest factor value.
      <br/>
      The RMS digital voltmeter of the present invention will simultaneously indicate the RMS value of the measured waveform in digital format and in a color indicative of the crest factor value of the measured waveform, to thereby simultaneously indicate its magnitude and shape.

    <p num="142">
      FIG. 77 is a comparison chart of RMS and crest factor values for several exemplary waveforms.
      <br/>
      It is readily apparent that the crest factor value is a good indication of the waveform shape.
      <br/>
      The unity value of the crest factor indicates that the measured signal is either a symmetrical waveform or a DC signal.
      <br/>
      Small values of the crest factor (less than 2) usually indicate either a sine wave, triangle wave, or a low duty cycle pulse train.
      <br/>
      High values of the crest factor (greater than 4) usually indicate a noise signal or a pulse train with a high duty cycle.
    </p>
    <p num="143">As illustrated in FIG. 78, the crest factor converter 183 includes a ratio producing circuit 187 that develops at its output RATIO A:B a signal representative of the ratio of signals applied to its inputs A and B. The peak signal value, obtained from the output of the peak detector 185, is applied to the input A. The RMS signal value, obtained from the output of the RMS-to-DC converter 181, is applied to the input B. The computed ratio of the peak signal value to the RMS signal value, developed at the output RATIO A:B, is by definition a crest factor value of the measured signal.</p>
    <p num="144">
      In a simplified exemplary schematic diagram of a ratio producing circuit, shown in FIG. 79, the output DC voltage of the RMS-to-DC converter 181 is applied to the X1 input of a precision divider 188, while the output DC voltage of the peak detector 185 is applied to its input Z2.

      <br/>
      The potentiometer 127b and resistors 124p, 124r are used to adjust offset voltage; the capacitor 129p is selected to set a suitable averaging time constant.

      FIG. 81 is an exemplary detail of the peak detector circuit, in which a measured signal is applied, via a suitable resistor 124u, to the input of a peak detector 186, which develops at its output a DC voltage, retained on the hold capacitor 129r, representing the maximum value of the input signal.
      <br/>
      The present peak value may be from time to time reset, by applying a relatively short positive pulse 99p to interconnected inputs DET and RESET.
      <br/>
      When pulse 99p returns to a low logic level, new peak of the input signal may be measured.

      <br/>
      By way of an example, the comparator 141a may be set to develop active color control signal G for values of the crest factor less than 1.5, to illuminate display element 42 in green color, active color control signal Y for values of the crest factor between 1.5 and 2.5, to illuminate display element 42 in yellow color, and active color control signal R for values of the crest factor greater than 2.5, to illuminate display element 42 in red color.

      The keyboard 117 includes a DC V key 118a for setting the multimeter to its DC voltage mode, AC V key 118b for setting the multimeter to its AC voltage mode, OHMS key 118c for setting the multimeter to its OHMS mode, RANGE keys 118d, 118e, 118f, 118g, 118h, 118i for setting the multimeter to a selected range, LOCAL key 118j for setting the multimeter to its local mode, FRONT key 118k for selecting front measurement terminals, FILTER key 118m for setting the multimeter to its filter mode, AUTO key 118n for setting the multimeter to its autoranging mode, OFFS key 118p, `%` key 118r, and LAH key 118s for setting the multimeter to certain of its mathematical modes.
      <br/>

      In FIG. 87 is shown a block diagram of a variable color digital multimeter controlled by a microprocessor or microcomputer 168, which can be influenced either locally, by entering commands via the keyboard 117, or remotely, by sending commands over a bus via the remote control circuit 169.
      <br/>
      When properly commanded, the microprocessor 168 can control the input conditioning section 120, AC section 112, and OHMS section 113, to selectively switch, scale, attenuate, rectify, and filter the measured signals, before being applied to the input of an A/D converter 106, which repeatedly performs analog-to-digital conversions and develops output data indicative of the magnitude of the instant measured signal.
      <br/>
      The microprocessor 168 can from time to time read output data of the converter 106 and send same to display controller 167, which causes the data to be indicated on display 40 in digital format.
      <br/>
      The invention resides in the addition of a color memory 136, wherein data symbolizing a selected color may be stored, and color control 50 for illuminating display 40 in the selected color.
      <br/>
      It is contemplated that the color of display 40 may be controlled in accordance with certain of the following operating modes:
    </p>
    <p num="153">
      a.
      <br/>
      Local/remote mode: The multimeter may be set either to its local mode, e.g., by actuating the LOCAL key 118j on the front panel, wherein all commands are entered via the keyboard 117, and the remote control 169 is disabled, or to its remote mode wherein all commands are sent via the remote control 169, and the keyboard 117 is disabled.
      <br/>
      When in its local mode, microprocessor 168 will send data to the color memory 136 commanding color control 50 to illuminate display 40 in a first color (e.g., green); when in its remote mode, microprocessor 168 will send different data to color memory 136 commanding that display 40 be illuminated in a second color (e.g., red), so that an operator may readily distinguish the two modes.
      <br/>
      b. Normal/offset mode: The multimeter may be set to its offset mode, e.g., by actuating the OFFS key 118p on the front panel, wherein a numeric constant (an offset) is stored in the microprocessor's memory, to calculate and display the difference between a measured value and the offset; when in its normal mode, the multimeter displays true measured values.
      <br/>
      To indicate in which mode the multimeter currently operates, the microprocessor 168 will send data to the color memory 136 commanding that display 40 be illuminated in a first color when in its normal mode and in a second color when in its offset mode.
      <br/>
      c. Standard/percent mode: The multimeter may be set to its percent mode, e.g., by actuating the `%` key 118r on the front panel, wherein a percent deviation of a measured value from a value stored in the microprocessor's memory (reference value) is calculated and displayed; when in its standard mode, true measured values are displayed.
      <br/>
      To indicate in which mode the multimeter currently operates, microprocessor 168 will send data to color memory 136 commanding that display 40 be illuminated in a first color for the standard mode and in a second color for the percent mode.
      <br/>
      d. LAH/standard mode: The multimeter may be set to its LAH (Low, Average, High) mode, e.g., by actuating the LAH key 118s on the front panel, wherein the multimeter will store the most positive and most negative measured values, calculate the average measured value, and count the number of measurements during the LAH cycle; when in its standard mode, true measured values are displayed.
      <br/>
      To indicate whether the multimeter currently operates in the standard or LAH mode, the microprocessor 168 will send data to the color memory 136 commanding that display 40 be illuminated in a first color for the standard mode and in a second color for the LAH mode.

      In FIG. 88 is shown an expanded block diagram of a digital multimeter with a DC section 111 for processing DC signals, AC section 112 for processing AC signals, and OHMS section 113 for performing resistance measurements, as will be more fully explained later.
      <br/>
      The multimeter includes input terminals HI INPUT 116a, LO INPUT 116b, HI OHM 116c, LO OHM 116d on the front panel shown in FIG. 86, and like input terminals on the rear panel (not shown), which may be selectively connected to the input of a digital voltmeter 105.
      <br/>
      To select between the front and rear measurements, the FRONT key 118k may be actuated, which toggles a front/rear relay 191 between its energized and disenergized conditions.
      <br/>
      To facilitate the illustration, a convention was adopted that a particular relay is designated in the drawings by a certain numeral, and its associated contacts are designated by same numeral with character `a`, `b`, etc., appended.
      <br/>
      By way of an example, relay 191 has contacts 191a, 191b, 191c, 191d, 191e.
      <br/>
      When relay 191 is not energized, its contacts 191a to 191e are in the positions as illustrated, thereby making available the front input terminals for connection to the input of digital voltmeter 105.
      <br/>
      When relay 191 is energized, its contacts 191a to 191e switch to their other positions, respectively, thereby making available the rear input terminals for connection to the input of the digital voltmeter 105.

      <br/>
      When the measurements via the front input terminals are performed, as illustrated, relay contact 191e is open, and the color control input C1 is pulled to a low logic level by a suitable pull-down resistor 124v, thereby forcing, via an inverter 151e, the color control input C2 to rise to a high logic level, to thereby cause display 40 to be illuminated in the color C2 (e.g., red).
      <br/>
      When the measurements via the rear input terminals are performed, by causing relay 191 to be energized to switch its contacts 191a to 191e to their other positions, respectively, contact 191e is closed to apply a high logic level from the source +VCC to the color control input C1, and to simultaneously force, via inverter 151e, the color control input C2 to a low logic level, to thereby cause display 40 to be illuminated in the color C1 (e.g., green).

      <br/>
      The filter mode may be turned on and off by actuating the FILTER key 118m, to toggle filter flip-flop 138b.
      <br/>
      When key 118m is actuated, its associated keyswitch 119m momentarily closes, to connect a low logic level to the trigger input TRG of a timer 158, which is normally tied to a high logic level via its pull-up resistor 124i, to produce at the timer's output OUT a relatively short positive going pulse 99s, to trigger filter flip-flop 138b to its opposite state.
      <br/>
      The width of pulse 99s may be set by selecting suitable values of resistor 124z and capacitor 129s, to eliminate the problem of possible bouncing of keyswitch 119m.
      <br/>
      When flip-flop 138b is in its set condition, its output Q, which is connected to the input of a relay driver 157, rises to a high logic level, to activate the latter, to energize filter relay 196.
      <br/>
      The associated relay contact 196a closes to connect filter circuit 149 to the input of digital voltmeter 105.
