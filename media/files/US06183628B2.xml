      <br/>
      An improved process for separating hydrogen from hydrocarbons.
      <br/>
      The process includes a pressure swing adsorption step, a compression/cooling step and a membrane separation step.
      <br/>
      The membrane step relies on achieving a methane/hydrogen selectivity of at least about 2.5 under the conditions of the process.

      An important aspect of reformer operation is to generate as much hydrogen as possible, consistent with other requirements, of a quality suitable for use in the hydrogen-consuming units, particularly hydrocrackers and hydrotreaters.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      The overhead vapor from the reformer reactors is typically split into at least two portions, one for recycle in the reactor loop, the other that forms a purge from the loop and that is the source of the net hydrogen product.
      <br/>
      This reactor purge stream is often sent to pressure swing adsorption (PSA) for upgrading to a high purity hydrogen product, typically containing 99% or more hydrogen.
      <br/>
      The hydrocarbon tail gas stream created when the PSA beds are regenerated is frequently treated as a waste gas stream and sent in its entirety to the plant fuel header.
    </p>
    <p num="6">Use of pressure swing adsorption (PSA) for this upgrading step is taught, for example, in U.S. Pat. No. 5,332,492, in which PSA tail gas is returned to the contactor section of the phase-separation steps, and U.S. Pat. No. 5,278,344, in which PSA is used to purify the net hydrogen stream after catalytic reforming and in front of a hydrodealkylation step.</p>
    <p num="7">
      It is also possible to use PSA to treat other diverse streams containing mixtures of hydrogen and hydrocarbons in refineries and elsewhere.
      <br/>
      Representative examples of such hydrogen-containing streams include overhead streams from fractionation columns used downstream of catalytic crackers, hydrocrackers and the like, overhead streams from cryogenic and other condensation units, overhead streams from absorbers, effluent streams from steam reformers, and refinery and petrochemical waste streams in general.

      It is also known to use membrane separation for removing hydrogen from hydrocarbons in gas streams from various sources. U.S. Pat.

      The process yields a hydrogen-enriched permeate that can be recompressed and recirculated to the reactor. U.S. Pat. No. 4,548,619, to UOP, shows membrane treatment of the overhead gas from an absorber treating effluent from benzene production.
      <br/>
      The membrane again permeates the hydrogen selectively and produces a hydrogen-enriched gas product that is withdrawn from the process. U.S. Pat. No. 5,053,067, to L'Air Liquide, discloses removal of part of the hydrogen from a refinery off-gas to change the dewpoint of the gas to facilitate downstream treatment. U.S. Pat.

    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="21">
      The invention is an improved process for treating effluent streams from refinery, petrochemical and other operations.
      <br/>
      The invention separates a stream containing at least hydrogen, methane and a C3+ hydrocarbon into three streams: a hydrogen-enriched stream suitable for use as a source of hydrogen, a liquid C3+ hydrocarbon stream suitable for use as a source of LPG, and a methane-rich stream suitable for use as fuel gas.
    </p>
    <p num="22">In its most simple form, the invention includes three unit operations or steps: a pressure swing adsorption (PSA) step to separate a high-purity hydrogen stream from the effluent stream; a cooling and phase separation step to liquefy and remove a portion of the C3+ hydrocarbons present in the tail gas from the PSA beds after regeneration; and a membrane separation step to separate the remaining hydrocarbons from hydrogen.</p>
    <p num="23">In a basic embodiment, these steps take the following form:</p>
    <p num="24">
      (a) passing a stream comprising hydrogen, methane and a C3+ hydrocarbon through a pressure swing adsorption unit, thereby producing a hydrogen-enriched product stream and a tail gas stream;
      <br/>
      (b) cooling the tail gas stream, thereby producing a condensed C3+ hydrocarbon stream and an uncondensed stream;
      <br/>
      (c) passing the uncondensed stream across the feed side of a membrane separation unit containing a rubbery polymeric membrane having a feed side and a permeate side, and being selectively permeable to methane over hydrogen, under conditions sufficient that the membrane exhibits a methane/hydrogen selectivity of at least about 2.5;
      <br/>
      (d) withdrawing from the permeate side a permeate stream enriched in methane and C3+ hydrocarbon compared with the uncondensed stream;
      <br/>
      (e) withdrawing from the feed side a residue stream enriched in hydrogen compared with the uncondensed stream.
    </p>
    <p num="25">
      The process relies on obtaining a methane/hydrogen selectivity of at least about 2.5, more preferably at least about 3, and most preferably at least about 4, in the membrane separation step.
      <br/>
      This selectivity, which has hitherto been unknown in any membrane material, is achieved in the preferred case by using a polysiloxane membrane, particularly a silicone rubber membrane.
      <br/>
      The ability of such a membrane to produce such a comparatively high methane/hydrogen selectivity at low temperature and in the presence of one or more C3+ hydrocarbons is unexpected and very advantageous in terms of obtaining three useful product streams from the process.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, under these conditions the membrane exhibits extremely high selectivity for other hydrocarbons over hydrogen, such as 10 or more for ethane/hydrogen and 30 or more for propane/hydrogen.
    </p>
    <p num="26">
      The tail gas from regeneration of the PSA beds is typically at comparatively low pressure, for example about 50 psia.
      <br/>
      Production of a liquid C3+ hydrocarbons stream in step (b) is facilitated, therefore, by compressing the tail gas to a few hundred psi in addition to cooling it.
      <br/>
      The compression/cooling step also produces a membrane feed stream containing an appropriate amount of C3+ hydrocarbon and at an appropriate temperature to yield a methane/hydrogen selectivity of at least about 2.5 in the membrane separation step.
    </p>
    <p num="27">Preferably, the invention includes an additional step of recirculating at least a portion of the hydrogen-enriched membrane residue stream to the pressure swing adsorption unit, thereby increasing the amount of high-purity hydrogen produced by the process.</p>
    <p num="28">Optionally, at least a portion of the membrane permeate stream is recirculated to the compression/cooling step.</p>
    <p num="29">
      The invention has an important advantage over other polymeric membrane separation processes that have been used in the industry in the past: all hydrocarbons, including methane, permeate the membrane preferentially, leaving a residue stream on the feed side that is concentrated in the slower-permeating hydrogen.
      <br/>
      The use of hydrocarbon-selective, hydrogen-rejecting polymeric membranes means that the hydrogen-enriched stream is retained on the feed side of the membrane.
      <br/>
      In other words, the hydrogen-enriched stream withdrawn from the membrane separation unit remains at pressure, which is desirable for recycle to the adsorption unit, as well as for facilitating delivery to other destinations in embodiments in which the residue stream is not recycled in the process.
      <br/>
      In contrast, hydrogen-selective membranes deliver a hydrogen-enriched stream at the comparatively low pressure of the permeate side, and this stream must almost always be recompressed for further treatment or use.
    </p>
    <p num="30">The use of polymeric materials for the membranes renders the membranes easy and inexpensive to prepare, and to house in modules, by conventional industrial techniques, unlike other types of hydrogen-rejecting membranes, such as finely microporous inorganic membranes, including adsorbent carbon membranes, pyrolysed carbon membranes and ceramic membranes, which are difficult and costly to fabricate in industrially useful quantities.</p>
    <p num="31">The invention has a number of advantages, including but not limited to:</p>
    <p num="32">
      increased hydrogen production compared with prior art techniques
      <br/>
      production of a discrete LPG stream
      <br/>
      ability to debottleneck plants where fuel gas production is at maximum.
    </p>
    <p num="33">
      Optionally, the hydrogen-rich stream from the membrane separation operation may be sent to a second membrane separation step to provide additional separation between the remaining light hydrocarbons and hydrogen.
      <br/>
      In this case, it is preferred to recirculate the permeate from the first membrane separation step to the compression/cooling step, to recirculate the hydrogen-rich residue from the second membrane separation step to the PSA step and to withdraw the methane-rich permeate from the second membrane separation step for use as fuel gas or to send to any other desired destination.
    </p>
    <p num="34">
      The preferred membranes used in the present invention permeate all of the hydrocarbons, hydrogen sulfide and water vapor preferentially over hydrogen, and are capable of withstanding exposure to these materials even in comparatively high concentrations.
      <br/>
      This contrasts with cellulose acetate and like membranes, which must be protected from exposure to heavy hydrocarbons and water.
      <br/>
      If liquid water or C3+ hydrocarbons condense on the surface of such membranes, which can happen if the temperature within the membrane modules is lower than the upstream temperature and/or as the removal of hydrogen through the membrane increases the concentration of other components on the feed side, the membranes can suffer catastrophic failure.
      <br/>
      On the other hand, the membranes used in the invention preferentially and rapidly pass these components, so they do not build up on the feed side.
      <br/>
      Thus, the membranes can handle a wide diversity of stream types.
      <br/>
      This is a differentiating and important advantage over processes that have previously been available.
    </p>
    <p num="35">Most significantly, the invention provides membrane processes that can separate methane from hydrogen with a practical, industrially useful selectivity, and retain the hydrogen at high pressure.</p>

      The invention is an improved process for treating effluent streams from refinery, petrochemical and other operations.
      <br/>
      The invention separates a stream containing at least hydrogen, methane and a C3+ hydrocarbon into three streams: a hydrogen-enriched stream suitable for use as a source of hydrogen, a liquid C3+ hydrocarbon stream suitable for use as a source of LPG, and a methane-rich stream suitable for use as fuel gas.
    </p>
    <p num="45">
      The process can be applied to any gas stream containing such a mix of components.
      <br/>
      Streams that may be treated by the process of the invention include, but are not limited to, streams from unit operations in refineries, such as catalytic reforming, hydrocracking, catalytic cracking and isomerization; and streams from petrochemical and other chemical manufacturing operations, such as dealkylation, hydrogenation, steam cracking and ammonia production.
      <br/>
      In a basic aspect, the invention includes three unit operations or steps: a pressure swing adsorption (PSA) step to separate a high-purity hydrogen stream from the effluent stream; a cooling and phase separation step to liquefy and remove a portion of the C3+ hydrocarbons present in the tail gas from the PSA beds after regeneration; and a membrane separation step to separate the remaining hydrocarbons from hydrogen.
      <br/>
      The membrane separation step uses a rubbery polymeric membrane, preferably polysiloxane, and is carried out under conditions that provide a methane/hydrogen selectivity of at least about 2.5, more preferably at least about 3, and most preferably at least about 4.
    </p>
    <p num="46">
      The invention in its basic aspect is shown schematically in FIG. 1.
      <br/>
      It will be appreciated by those of skill in the art that this and the other figures described below are very simple schematic diagrams, intended to make clear the key aspects of the invention, and that an actual process train will usually include many additional components of a standard type, such as compressors, heaters, chillers, condensers, pumps, blowers, other types of separation and/or fractionation equipment, valves, switches, controllers, pressure-, temperature-, level- and flow-measuring devices and the like.
      <br/>
      Referring to this figure, feed stream 101, containing at least methane, hydrogen and a C3+ hydrocarbon, passes to PSA treatment step 102.
      <br/>
      The goal of this step is to provide a supply of hydrogen, typically, but not necessarily, of better than 99% purity, for reuse in the process from which stream 101 originates, or elsewhere, such as in hydrotreating or hydrocracking.
    </p>
    <p num="47">
      PSA systems usually comprise a series of beds of a zeolite or similar material that will selectively sorb one or more components of the gas mixture.
      <br/>
      The beds are connected in such a way that each bed can be switched periodically from adsorption mode to regeneration mode.
      <br/>
      As one bed or set of beds is taken off-line for regeneration, another bed or set of beds is switched in so that gas can be processed continuously.
      <br/>
      In the sorption mode, which is typically carried out at elevated pressure, typically above 150 psia, such as 200 psia, 300 psia, 500 psia or above, hydrocarbons are adsorbed onto the active beds.
      <br/>
      In the present invention, the adsorption step is carried out preferably at a pressure no higher than about 750 psia, and more preferably in the range 50-500 psia.
      <br/>
      The gas exiting the bed, stream 103, typically has a very high hydrogen content, such as 99 vol % hydrogen or higher.
    </p>
    <p num="48">
      When the adsorbing beds have been charged to the desired level, they are switched into desorption/regeneration mode.
      <br/>
      The desorption/regeneration step can be carried out by any convenient techniques known in the art.
      <br/>
      Such techniques include, but are not limited to, passing a displacement gas cocurrently through the bed to sweep out unadsorbed gas from the void spaces, cocurrent depressurization of the bed to position the mass transfer front appropriately, countercurrent depressurization to remove previously adsorbed gas, and countercurrent purging to complete regeneration of the bed for reuse.
    </p>
    <p num="49">
      Depressurization of the bed during these steps may take place by multiple reductions in pressure, as is known in the art, and may reduce the pressure to atmospheric pressure (15 psia) or below.
      <br/>
      Removal of void space gas and positioning of the mass transfer front is preferably carried out, however, at a pressure in the range 50-250 psia, and countercurrent desorption is preferably carried out at a pressure no lower than 15 psia, more preferably in the range 15-75 psia, yet more preferably no lower than about 30 psia and most preferably no lower than about 50 psia.
    </p>
    <p num="50">By way of non-limiting example, a typical bed cycle may be: (i) adsorption at 500 psia; (ii) depressurization to 200 psia under cocurrent flow conditions; (iii) depressurization to 50 psia under countercurrent flow conditions; (iv) purging at 50 psia; (v) repressurization.</p>
    <p num="51">
      The hydrogen product stream is withdrawn from the process as stream 103.
      <br/>
      The hydrocarbon gases that are removed during the desorption/regeneration steps are shown generally in FIG. 1 as stream 104.
      <br/>
      In practice, several streams of different compositions will be produced during the individual parts of the regeneration cycle.
      <br/>
      It is within the scope of the invention to treat only one of these streams, or some other portion of the total, in the remaining steps 105 and 108, but is preferred to treat all of the PSA off gas, or tail gas, as shown in FIG. 1.
    </p>
    <p num="52">
      In the aggregate, tail gas stream 104 has a typical composition of about 40%, 50% or 60% hydrogen and 60%, 50% or 40% mixed C1 -C6 hydrocarbons.
      <br/>
      This stream is passed to compression/cooling step 105.
      <br/>
      This step has two functions: one, to condense part of the C3+ hydrocarbons content of stream 104 to produce an LPG or liquefied light hydrocarbon product, and two, to facilitate the subsequent membrane separation step and downstream recycle or treatment.
      <br/>
      Any type of compressor may be used to compress stream 104, and the desired pressure may be reached in one or multiple stages.
      <br/>
      Preferably, the stream is raised to a pressure in the range 150-750 psia, and most preferably in the range about 300-400 psia.
    </p>
    <p num="53">
      It is desirable to avoid cooling to very low temperatures, since reaching these adds to the cost and complexity of the process.
      <br/>
      By very low temperatures, we mean temperatures below about -100 (degree)  C. The temperature at which step 105 is operated should be above -100 (degree)  C., and most preferably above about -40 (degree)  C. Temperatures down to about the bottom of the most preferred range should be possible to reach by single-stage refrigeration, for example using propylene as the cooling refrigerant.
    </p>
    <p num="54">
      The degree of cooling to which the gas is subjected also depends to some extent on the gas composition.
      <br/>
      The invention relies on obtaining a methane/hydrogen selectivity of at least about 2.5 in the membrane separation step.
      <br/>
      Such a selectivity is currently unknown from any membrane material at temperatures above 0 (degree)  C. Unexpectedly, however, as discussed in more detail below with regard to the membrane separation step, we have found that a methane/hydrogen selectivity of 2.5, 3, or even 4 or more can be obtained from a silicone rubber membrane exposed to a stream containing hydrogen, methane and a C3+ hydrocarbon at sub-zero temperatures.
      <br/>
      Thus, the preferred operating range for the compression/cooling step is between 0 (degree)  C. and -40 (degree)  C. The temperature can be reached in any manner, including, but not limited to, simple air aftercooling of the compressor outlet gases, heat exchange against other streams, such as the streams entering or leaving the membrane unit, chilling by external refrigerants, and any combinations of these.
      <br/>
      Such methods are familiar to those of skill in the art.
      <br/>
      The compression/cooling step results in condensation of a liquid hydrocarbon fraction, stream 106, which is withdrawn from the process, and which may be sent to any desired destination.
    </p>
    <p num="55">
      Gas stream 107 leaves the compression/cooling step and passes to membrane separation step 108.

      The permeability of a gas or vapor through a membrane is a product of the diffusion coefficient, D, and the Henry's law sorption coefficient, k. D is a measure of the permeant's mobility in the polymer; k is a measure of the permeant's sorption into the polymer.
      <br/>
      The diffusion coefficient tends to decrease as the molecular size of the permeant increases, because large molecules interact with more segments of the polymer chains and are thus less mobile.
      <br/>
      The sorption coefficient depends, amongst other factors, on the condensability of the gas.
    </p>
    <p num="56">
      Depending on the nature of the polymer, either the diffusion or the sorption component of the permeability may dominate.
      <br/>
      In rigid, glassy polymer materials, the diffusion coefficient tends to be the controlling factor and the ability of molecules to permeate is very size dependent.
      <br/>
      As a result, glassy membranes tend to permeate small, low-boiling molecules, such as hydrogen and methane, faster than larger, more condensable molecules, such as C3+ organic molecules.
      <br/>
      For rubbery or elastomeric polymers, the difference in size is much less critical, because the polymer chains can be flexed, and sorption effects generally dominate the permeability.
      <br/>
      Elastomeric materials, therefore, tend to permeate larger, condensable molecules faster than small, low-boiling molecules.
      <br/>
      Thus, most rubbery materials are selective in favor of all C3+ hydrocarbons over hydrogen.
      <br/>
      Examples of polymers that can be used to make such elastomeric membranes, include, but are not limited to, nitrile rubber, neoprene, polydimethylsiloxane (silicone rubber), chlorosulfonated polyethylene, polysilicone-carbonate copolymers, fluoroelastomers, plasticized polyvinylchloride, polyurethane, cis-polybutadiene, cis-polyisoprene, poly(butene-1), polystyrene-butadiene copolymers, styrene/butadiene/styrene block copolymers, styrene/ethylene/butylene block copolymers, and thermoplastic polyolefin elastomers.
      <br/>
      For the smallest, least condensable hydrocarbons, methane in particular, even rubbery polymers tend to be selective in favor of hydrogen, because of the relative ease with which the hydrogen molecule can diffuse through most materials.
      <br/>
      For example, neoprene rubber has a selectivity for hydrogen over methane of about 4, natural rubber a selectivity for hydrogen over methane of about 1.6, and Kraton, a commercial polystyrene-butadiene copolymer, has a selectivity for hydrogen over methane of about 2.
      <br/>
      Therefore, although any of the rubbery membrane materials mentioned above are useful for providing separation of C2+ hydrocarbons from hydrogen, even most rubbery materials are unsuitable for the type of methane/hydrogen separation required in the present invention.
      <br/>
      To applicants' knowledge, among the polymeric membranes that perform gas separation based on the solution/diffusion mechanism, silicone rubber, specifically polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) and closely related polymers are the only materials that are selective in favor of methane over hydrogen, and thus are potentially useful within the scope of the invention.
      <br/>
      Other materials that we expect may be found to be methane/hydrogen selective include other polysiloxanes, such as other alkyl-substituted siloxanes, copolymers of PDMS or other alkyl-substituted siloxane with other materials, and the like.
      <br/>
      For example, U.S. Pat. No. 4,370,150 cites data for silicone-polycarbonate copolymer membranes that suggest a pure gas selectivity of about 1.3 for methane over hydrogen, but this would, of course, depend on the exact composition of the polymer and the other components of an actual gas.
    </p>
    <p num="57">
      As mentioned above, the invention relies on obtaining a methane/hydrogen selectivity of at least about 2.5, more preferably at least about 3, and most preferably at least about 4 in the membrane separation step.
      <br/>
      However, such a selectivity is currently unknown from any membrane material at temperatures above 0 (degree)  C. Our experiments with silicone rubber films and binary methane/hydrogen mixtures at sub-zero temperatures showed that the methane/hydrogen selectivity increases only slightly with decreasing temperature, from about 1.4 at 20 (degree)  C. to about 1.9 at -20 (degree)  C. Furthermore, the permeability of silicone rubber to both hydrogen and methane drops with decreasing temperature.
      <br/>
      Unexpectedly, however, in a multicomponent mixture containing hydrogen, methane and C3+ hydrocarbons, the permeability of silicone rubber to methane was no longer found to decrease with decreasing temperature, but now to increase with decreasing temperature, a trend opposite to that observed with the binary gas mixture.
      <br/>
      In the same multicomponent mixture, however, the hydrogen permeability continues to decrease with decreasing temperature, resulting in a substantial increase in methane/hydrogen selectivity.
      <br/>
      In tests with silicone rubber films of a few hundred microns thickness, we found that a methane/hydrogen selectivity of 3, 4 or even 5 or more can be obtained when the film is exposed to a stream containing hydrogen, methane and a C3+ hydrocarbon at sub-zero temperatures, such as -5 (degree)  C. or -20 (degree)  C. Using composite membranes of just a few microns thick in membrane modules, such as will be used in an actual industrial separation process, instead of thick silicone rubber films, it is necessary to go to slightly lower temperatures to achieve comparable performance.
      <br/>
      For example, a methane/hydrogen selectivity of 4 may be attained from a laboratory film at -20 (degree)  C., but it may be necessary to go to -30 (degree)  C. to attain that same selectivity from a module in an industrial plant.
      <br/>
      On this basis, and taking into account also the preferred operating temperatures for the upstream condensation step, the preferred operating temperature for the membrane separation step 108 is in the range 0 (degree)  C. to -40 (degree)  C.
    </p>
    <p num="58">
      For some specific gas mixture/membrane material combinations, it may be possible to obtain adequate cooling and desired condensation of C3+ hydrocarbons in step 105 and to obtain the desired selectivity in the membrane separation step 108 even at a temperature slightly above 0 (degree)  C. In this case, operation at such a temperature will obviously reduce cooling costs and will be convenient if water vapor is present in the feed stream.
      <br/>
      On the other hand, the membrane separation performance may be less than would be achieved by operating at lower temperature.
    </p>
    <p num="59">
      The membrane may take any convenient form known in the art.
      <br/>
      The preferred form is a composite membrane including a microporous support layer for mechanical strength and a rubbery polymeric coating layer, most preferably silicone rubber, that is responsible for the separation properties.
      <br/>
      Additional layers may be included in the structure as desired, such as to provide strength, protect the selective layer from abrasion, and so on.
    </p>
    <p num="60">
      The membranes may be manufactured as flat sheets or as fibers and housed in any convenient module form, including spiral-wound modules, plate-and-frame modules and potted hollow-fiber modules.
      <br/>
      The making of all these types of membranes and modules is well known in the art.
      <br/>
      Flat-sheet membranes in spiral-wound modules are our most preferred choice.
      <br/>
      Since conventional polymeric materials are used for the membranes, they are relatively easy and inexpensive to prepare and to house in modules, compared with other types of membranes that might be used as hydrogen-rejecting membranes, such as finely microporous inorganic membranes, including adsorbent carbon membranes, pyrolysed carbon membranes and ceramic membranes.
    </p>
    <p num="61">
      To achieve a high transmembrane hydrocarbon flux, the selective layer responsible for the separation properties should be thin, preferably, but not necessarily, no more than 30  MU m thick, more preferably no more than 20  MU m thick, and most preferably no more than about 10  MU m thick.
      <br/>
      Although composite membranes with silicone rubber selective layers of just 1 or 2  MU m thick can be made, extremely thin membranes, such as less than about 5  MU m thick, are not preferred, since the resulting extremely high fluxes may give rise to a permeant-depleted boundary layer at the membrane surface on the feed side, and hence to overall diminished separation performance.
    </p>
    <p num="62">
      A driving force for transmembrane permeation is provided by a pressure difference between the feed and permeate sides of the membrane.
      <br/>
      Most preferably, this driving force is provided simply by compression/cooling step 105, from which membrane feed stream 107 emerges at an elevated pressure, typically of a few hundred psi.
      <br/>
      The pressure on the permeate side may be atmospheric, or may be maintained at an above-atmospheric or below-atmospheric pressure convenient with respect to the destination of the permeate stream.
      <br/>
      As a general guide, a pressure ratio (feed pressure/permeate pressure) of at least about four or five is preferred.
    </p>
    <p num="63">
      By selectively removing the non-hydrogen components, the membrane separation step results in a membrane residue stream, 110, that is enriched in hydrogen compared with the membrane feed stream, 107.
      <br/>
      Typically, but not necessarily, stream 110 will contain more than 60% hydrogen, such as 70% hydrogen, 75% hydrogen, 80% hydrogen or more.
      <br/>
      This stream can be sent to any desired destination.
      <br/>
      For example, it may be returned to the process from which stream 101 originates, or cascaded to another process within the refinery or chemical plant.
      <br/>
      Most preferably, at least a portion of the stream is returned to the inlet side of the PSA unit for additional hydrogen recovery, as illustrated with respect to FIG. 2.
    </p>
    <p num="64">
      The membrane separation step also results in a permeate stream, 109, that is enriched in methane and other hydrocarbons compared with the membrane feed stream 107.
      <br/>
      This stream can be sent to any desired destination, such as directly to the plant fuel header, to further treatment, or to a saturated gas plant for splitting into separate C2 -C5 hydrocarbon fractions.
      <br/>
      The stream may also be of suitable composition to serve as feed to a steam reformer.
      <br/>
      Most preferably, particularly if it contains a high percentage of C3+ hydrocarbons, such as above 10% hydrocarbons, at least a portion of stream 109 is recirculated to the compression/cooling step, as illustrated below with respect to FIG. 2.
    </p>
    <p num="65">
      Turning now to FIG. 2, this shows a preferred embodiment of the invention in which a second membrane separation step is used to provide more selective purging of the lightest hydrocarbons.
      <br/>
      Referring to this figure, stream 201 is passed to and treated in PSA unit 202 to form high-purity hydrogen product stream 203.
      <br/>
      Hydrocarbon tail gas stream 204, from one or more of the regeneration cycles of the PSA beds, is combined with hydrogen-depleted permeate stream 209 and introduced into compression/cooling step 205.
      <br/>
      This step is carried out under pressure/temperature conditions that give rise to liquefaction of a portion of the hydrocarbons, and that result in an uncondensed stream at a temperature and with a C3+ hydrocarbon content that will provide a methane/hydrogen selectivity of at least about 2.5 in the subsequent membrane separation step.
      <br/>
      LPG stream 206, which is rich in C3+ hydrocarbons, is withdrawn from the process.
    </p>
    <p num="66">
      The uncondensed gas, stream 207, leaves the compression/cooling step and passes to membrane separation step 208.
      <br/>
      In this case, two membrane separation steps are used, 208 and 211, and it not necessary that step 208 provide a high methane/hydrogen selectivity of 2.5 or more.
      <br/>
      Thus, although silicone rubber membranes are still most preferred, other membranes taught in parent application Ser.
      <br/>
      No. 09/273,207, such as rubbery membranes that are selective for C2+ hydrocarbons over hydrogen and superglassy polymers, may be used in this step.
      <br/>
      Also, the step may optionally be operated at a higher temperature, such as above 0 (degree)  C. This reduces the overall cooling load of the process.
      <br/>
      In addition, any water vapor present in the feed gas will permeate the membrane, be recirculated in stream 209 and be removed from the process in stream 206.
    </p>
    <p num="67">
      The first membrane separation step divides stream 207 into permeate stream 209, enriched in hydrocarbons and depleted in hydrogen, and residue stream 210, enriched in hydrogen and depleted in hydrocarbons.
      <br/>
      The permeate stream is recirculated to the inlet side of the compression/cooling step.
    </p>
    <p num="68">
      Residue stream 210 is withdrawn from membrane unit 208.
      <br/>
      In this embodiment, the process involves returning a portion of the hydrogen recovered from the PSA tail gas for additional recovery by the PSA unit, and purging a portion of the gas to control build up of methane or other light contaminants in the process loops.
      <br/>
      In this case, however, the purging is done by means of an additional membrane step, 211.
      <br/>
      This second membrane step is carried out using membranes the requirements for which are the same as those discussed above with respect to FIG. 1, namely that they be rubbery polymeric membranes capable of exhibiting a methane/hydrogen selectivity of at least about 2.5, more preferably at least about 3 and most preferably at least about 4 under the conditions of the process.
      <br/>
      Thus, for this step, polysiloxane membranes are preferred, and silicone rubber membranes are most preferred, and the preferred temperature operating range for the membrane is between 0 (degree)  C. and -40 (degree)  C. Because stream 210 has been dried by the first membrane separation step, sub-zero temperatures can now be used for the second membrane separation step without concern about ice formation.
      <br/>
      As the gas has already passed through the first membrane separation step, stream 210 is substantially lighter in C3+ hydrocarbon content than stream 207.
      <br/>
      However, stream 210 is usually as much as 5 (degree)  C., 10 (degree)  C., 15 (degree)  C. or more colder than membrane feed stream 207 as a result of Joule-Thomson cooling brought about by permeation of condensable hydrocarbons, and, as the temperature of the feed gas drops, less of the C3+ hydrocarbon gas is required to maintain the membrane selectivity above about 2.5.
    </p>
    <p num="69">
      If stream 210 is not at a temperature low enough to provide the required selectivity in unit 211, it may be subjected to further optional cooling, 214, as indicated, before being introduced into unit 211.
      <br/>
      The second membrane separation step produces hydrogen-enriched residue stream 213, which is recirculated to the PSA step for additional hydrogen recovery, and methane-enriched and hydrogen-depleted permeate purge stream, 212, which is sent to fuel gas or otherwise disposed of.
      <br/>
      In this manner, the amount of unrecovered material is reduced still further compared with the embodiment of FIG. 1.
    </p>
    <p num="70">
      As will be appreciated by those of skill in the art, the membrane area and operating parameters of the membrane separation steps described with respect to FIGS. 1 and 2 above can be varied to focus on specific targets, such as high LPG recovery, high hydrogen recovery, or low fuel gas production.
      <br/>
      One particular benefit of the invention is that it provides control of the amount of fuel gas produced by refinery and chemical industry operations.
      <br/>
      Prior art operations that use PSA to recover hydrogen have generally sent the resulting hydrocarbon waste stream to the fuel line.
      <br/>
      The process of the invention provides the ability to reduce the gas sent to the fuel line by 50% or more, compared with the case in which PSA alone is used to treat the off gases.
      <br/>
      A useful result is that some plants that were previously bottlenecked by fuel gas production are able to increase throughput, thereby increasing product yield.

    <p num="73">Preparation of Silicone Rubber Films</p>
    <p num="74">
      Dense, isotropic films of silicone rubber (polydimethylsiloxane) �PDMS� were made from a 4-wt % solution of silicone rubber in iso-octane (Silicone Dehesive 940 A, Wacker Silicone Corp., Adrian, Mich.).
      <br/>
      The silicone rubber solution contained a crosslinker (V 24) and a platinum-based catalyst.
      <br/>
      The solution was cast on a glass plate, and the solvent was evaporated at ambient conditions for one week.
      <br/>
      The films were then dried in a vacuum oven at 80 (degree)  C. for 12 hours.
      <br/>
      The thickness of the resulting films was determined with a precision micrometer.
      <br/>
      Film samples with thicknesses of 100-300  MU m ( +- 1  MU m) were used for the permeation experiments.

    <p num="77">
      An experiment was carried out to determine the performance of silicone rubber films at different temperatures.
      <br/>
      Films were prepared as in Example 1.
      <br/>
      Samples of the films were cut into 12.6-cm2 stamps, and subjected to permeation tests in a permeation test-cell apparatus.
      <br/>
      The tests were performed using the constant pressure/variable volume method, with a gas mixture containing 50% hydrogen and 50% methane.
      <br/>
      The feed pressure was 150 psig, the permeate pressure was atmospheric (0 psig), and the feed temperature was varied between -20 (degree)  C. and 35 (degree)  C. The compositions of the residue and permeate were determined with a gas chromatograph equipped with a thermal conductivity detector, and permeabilities were calculated.
      <br/>
      The methane/hydrogen selectivity was calculated from the ratio of the permeabilities.
      <br/>
      The stage-cut, that is, the ratio of permeate to feed flow rate, was always less than 1%.

      The methane and hydrogen permeabilities both decreased with decreasing feed temperature.
      <br/>
      The silicone rubber film was more permeable to methane than to hydrogen over the whole temperature range.
      <br/>
      Because the hydrogen permeability of silicone rubber exhibited a stronger temperature dependence than that of methane, the methane/hydrogen selectivity increased slightly from about 1.3 at 35 (degree)  C. to about 1.9 at -20 (degree)  C., as shown in FIG. 4.

      The permeabilities of both methane and hydrogen were higher at 35 (degree)  C. in the multicomponent mixture than in the binary mixture.
      <br/>
      The permeability of hydrogen showed the same trend in the multicomponent mixture as in the binary mixture; that is, it decreased with decreasing temperature.

      The permeabilities of methane, ethane, propane and n-butane increased with decreasing feed temperature.

      For the most condensable gas, n-butane, the permeability increase was about 10-fold, from about 20,000 Barrer at 35 (degree)  C. to about 200,000 Barrer at -20 (degree)  C. The methane permeability almost doubled, from about 1,500 Barrer to about 3,000 Barrer, as the temperature was lowered from 35 (degree)  C. to -20 (degree)  C. This is an unexpected result, and the opposite from the trend in the binary mixture case, where decreasing the temperature also decreased the methane permeability.

      The process produces 11,000 lb/h of purge gas, of which about 1,100 lb/h is hydrogen.
      <br/>
      In prior art processes which purge the entire PSA tail gas stream, the stream would contain 15,000 lb/h of gas, of which 1,800 lb/h is hydrogen.
      <br/>
      Thus, the process is very advantageous in debottlenecking plants where production is limited by fuel gas generation.
