    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="1">The present invention relates to a lawn and garden spreader, and in particular to a lawn and garden spreader adapted to efficiently spread pelletized mulches, fertilizers, and other oversized applications.</p>
    <p num="2">
      Lawn and garden spreaders are used to spread and disperse a wide variety of lawn and garden applications.
      <br/>
      The spreaders typically include a hopper, an aperture located in the bottom of the hopper, a gate for opening and closing the aperture, a disbursement blade for spreading the application, and a mechanism for opening and closing the gate.
    </p>
    <p num="3">
      Heretofore, lawn and garden spreaders have normally incorporated a single gate to open and close the aperture.
      <br/>
      Typically, these spreaders allow the operator to adjust the gate between the fully open and fully closed positions only.
      <br/>
      As a result, the size of the apertures are calibrated so as to allow the operator to spread only a single type of application with any given spreader.
      <br/>
      Other systems, allow the operator to adjust the gate between a plurality of positions thereby allowing the operator to adjust the size of the aperture for the given application.
      <br/>
      However, current spreaders are typically not designed to provide adequate flow and metering of new pellet fertilizers, mulches and other similar large applications.
      <br/>
      Many new pelletized mulches and fertilizers are much larger than those typically utilized in the industry for many years and measure from 1/4 of an inch up to and including 1 inch in any direction.
      <br/>
      With most spreaders, opening the gate to a position such that these oversized applications can sufficiently flow through the aperture results in an un-metered flow.
      <br/>
      At the other extreme, restricting the aperture to meter the flow results in clogging and intermittent flow of the application through the aperture.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      Another problem associated with most lawn and garden spreaders adapted to spread various sized applications is that they are complicated to operate and require the operator to consult charts and graphs in order to determine what setting is appropriate for a given application.
      <br/>
      Still others provide no help at all requiring the operator to rely on trial and error in an attempt to configure the spreader appropriately for each application.
    </p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="5">
      One aspect of the present invention is to provide a lawn and garden spreader that is adapted for efficiently spreading pelletized mulches and other like applications larger in size than granular products are typically associated with lawn and garden applications.
      <br/>
      The spreader includes a gravity flow hopper having an outlet aperture in a lower portion thereof, and a horizontally oriented track disposed adjacent to the outlet aperture.
      <br/>
      A rotatable disbursement blade is situated below the outlet aperture such that an application flowing through the aperture will contact the disbursement blade.
      <br/>
      A gate is slidably mounted within the track such that the gate may be shifted between an extended position wherein the gate closes the outlet aperture and a retracted position wherein the outlet aperture is open.
      <br/>
      A metering door is pivotably attached to the hopper such that the metering door may be rotated between a raised position wherein the door covers the aperture, and an open position wherein the door is lowered and meters the application flowing through the aperture and onto the disbursement blade.
      <br/>
      A mechanical linkage is operatively connected with the gate and the door thereby allowing the operator to selectively operate the gate between the extended and retracted positions, and the door between the closed and open positions.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      Another aspect of the present invention is to provide a method for metering and spreading pelletized mulches and the like applications that are larger in size then granular products typically associated with lawn and garden applications.
      <br/>
      The method includes providing a gravity flow hopper having an outlet aperture formed in a lower portion thereof and a horizontally oriented track disposed adjacent to the outlet aperture, providing a rotatable disbursement blade situated below the aperture, providing a gate slidably mounted in the track and shiftable between an extended position wherein the gate closes the outlet aperture and a retracted position wherein the outlet aperture is open, and providing a metering door pivotally attached to the hopper for rotation between a closed position wherein the door is raised and covers the aperture and an open position wherein the door is lowered.
      <br/>
      The method further includes providing a first mechanical linkage operatively connected with the gate thereby allowing the operator to selectively operate the gate between the extended and the retracted positions, and providing a second mechanical linkage operatively connected with the door thereby allowing the operator to selectively operate the door between the closed and open positions and a plurality of intermediate selectable positions therebetween and calibrated so as to provide a predetermined flow rate of an application contained in the hopper through the aperture and onto the disbursement blade.
      <br/>
      The method still further includes placing the appropriate application within the hopper, operating the gate in cooperation with the door such that even and uninterrupted flow of the application from the hopper through the aperture is achieved, and adjusting the door such that the application flows through the aperture in and onto the disbursement blade at a specific rate.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      The principal objects of the present invention are to provide a lawn and garden spreader adapted for effectively spreading pelletized mulches, and other similar applications larger in size than granular products typically associated with lawn and garden applications.
      <br/>
      The utilization of a sliding gate in combination with a pivoting door system allows the operator to sufficiently open the aperture associated with the hopper such that the application contained in the hopper freely flows through the aperture, yet allows the operator to meter the flow of the application onto the disbursement blade by way of the pivoting door system.
      <br/>
      A further object of the present invention is to provide a metering system that is easy to operate and adjust with respect to the appropriate flow rate for a given application.
    </p>
    <p num="8">These and other features, advantages, and objects of the present invention will be further understood and appreciated by those skilled in the art by reference to the following specification, claims, and appended drawings.</p>

      However, it is to be understood that the invention may assume various alternative orientations and step sequences, except where expressly specified to the contrary.
      <br/>
      It is also to be understood that the specific devices and processes illustrated in the attached drawings and described in the following specification are simply exemplary embodiments of the inventive concepts defined in the appended claims.
      <br/>
      Hence, specific dimensions and other physical characteristics relating to the embodiments disclosed herein are not to be considered as limiting, unless the claims expressly state otherwise.
    </p>
    <p num="11">
      The reference numeral 10 (FIGS. 1 and 2) generally designates a lawn and garden spreader embodying the present invention.
      <br/>
      In the illustrated example, the spreader 10 includes a gravity flow hopper 12 having an outlet aperture 14 located in a lower portion thereof, and a horizontally oriented track 16 disposed adjacent to aperture 14.
      <br/>
      A rotatable disbursement blade 18 (FIG. 3) is situated below aperture 14 such that an application 20 flowing through aperture 14 will contact blade 18.
      <br/>
      A gate 22 is slidably mounted within track 16 such that gate 22 may be shifted between an extended position wherein gate 22 closes aperture 14 and a retracted position wherein aperture 14 is open.
      <br/>
      A metering door 24 is pivotally attached to hopper 12 such that door 24 may be rotated between a raised position wherein door 24 covers aperture 14, and an open position wherein door 24 is lowered and meters the application 20 flowing through aperture 14 and onto blade 18.
      <br/>
      A first mechanical linkage 26 is operatively connected with gate 22 allowing the operator to selectively operate gate 22 between the extended and retracted positions.
      <br/>
      A second mechanical linkage 28 is operatively connected with door 24 allowing the operator to selectively operate door 24 between the closed and open positions.
      <br/>
      Gate 22 and door 24 may be operated in combination so as to allow the application 20 to flow freely through aperture 14 while allowing the operator to selectively meter the flow of the application 20 by way of door 24.
    </p>
    <p num="12">
      The illustrated hopper 12 (FIGS. 1, 2 and 3) is defined by a rearwardly sloping front wall 30, inwardly sloping side walls 32, an outer rear wall 34, an inwardly sloping inner rear wall 36, and a bottom wall 38.
      <br/>
      Aperture 14 is substantially centrally located within bottom wall 38.
      <br/>
      Front wall 30, side wall 32, and inner rear wall 36 slope inwardly towards aperture 14 thereby providing a gravity flow to the application 20 located in hopper 12.
      <br/>
      Aperture 14 is provided with a substantially rectangular shape, however, other geometrical shapes may be employed.
      <br/>
      Aperture 14 measures approximately 3 inches in width and 4 inches in length, thereby providing adequate area for application 20 to exit hopper 12 via aperture 14 notwithstanding that application 20 may be provided in a size much larger than that typically associated with lawn and garden applications which is discussed in greater detail below.
      <br/>
      It should be noted that aperture 14 may be provided in various sizes depending on the range of sizes of application 20 spreader 10 is designed to accommodate.
      <br/>
      Outer rear wall 34 of hopper 12 is provided with a pivot aperture 35 centrally located therein.
      <br/>
      Track 16 comprises two L-shaped track members 39a and 39b, attached to and extending downwardly from bottom wall 38 of hopper 12, and a guide member 41, also attached to and extending downwardly from bottom wall 38 of hopper 12.
      <br/>
      Track members 39a and 39b are adapted so as to guide and support gate 22 between the open and closed postions.
      <br/>
      Guide member 41 is adapted so as to provide a pocket 37 between guide member 41 and bottom wall 38 of hopper 12.
    </p>
    <p num="13">
      Illustrated spreader 10 is rollably supported by a wheel system 40 that allows the operator to roll spreader 10 across a lawn, garden, or other area.
      <br/>
      Spreader 10 is further provided with a rearwardly extending push handle 42 that allows the operator to manipulate the spreader 10 on wheel system 40.
      <br/>
      Spreader 10 is still further provided with a pair of support legs 44 that extend downwardly and rearwardly from hopper 12 and allow the operator to store the spreader 10 in an upright position when not in use.
    </p>
    <p num="14">
      Blade 18, as illustrated in FIGS. 3 and 4, is situated below aperture 14 of hopper 12 such that application 20 flowing through aperture 14 will contact blade 18.
      <br/>
      Blade 18 is rotatably driven by a mechanical linkage (not shown) between blade 18 and wheel system 40 such that relative rotational motion of wheel system 40 causes blade 18 to rotate.
      <br/>
      Blade 18 is adapted to disperse and spread the application 20 flowing through aperture 14 of hopper 12 onto and about the lawn or garden.
    </p>
    <p num="15">
      The illustrated gate 22 (FIGS. 2 and 3) is provided with a substantially rectangular shape, however, other geometrical shapes corresponding to the size and shape of aperture 14 within hopper 12 may be employed.
      <br/>
      Gate 22 is adapted to be slidably mounted between track members 39a and 39b and within pocket 37 such that it may be shifted by the operator between the extended position (FIG. 2) wherein gate 22 closes aperture 14 thereby prohibiting the flow of the application 20 through aperture 14, and the retracted position (as illustrated by the phantom lines, FIG. 2) wherein aperture 14 is open and the application 20 is allowed to freely flow therethrough.
      <br/>
