      A suspension system for personal water craft.
      <br/>
      The personal water craft suspension system includes a gas-inflated bladder (10) that is adapted for placement between a hull and seat of a personal water craft.
      <br/>
      The suspension system further includes at least one telescopic connector between the seat and the hull.
      <br/>
      For the typical personal water craft, the suspension system includes a back seat telescopic latch stud (18) and a front seat telescopic U hook(40).
      <br/>
      These telescopic connectors enable the seat to move up and down with respect to the hull with the bladder sandwiched between the seat and hull.
      <br/>
      The suspension system is operative to absorb or dampen the effects of bumps and other forces acting on personal water craft when a user is seated on the personal water craft and is riding over rough water.

    <heading>TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
    <p num="2">
      This invention relates to a personal water craft suspension system.
      <br/>
      Specifically this invention relates to a new suspension system for new and preexisting personal water craft that provides increased comfort for the user.
    </p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND ART</heading>
    <p num="3">
      Personal water craft use has become a very popular sport.
      <br/>
      Examples of a personal water craft (PWC) include water jet propelled crafts such as the JetSki.RTM. and Waverunner.RTM.. However for purposes of the present invention a PWC applies to any low profile water craft.
      <br/>
      Unfortunately riders of personal water craft often experience rough, and uncomfortable rides.
      <br/>
      As the personal water craft moves over high waves or choppy water, the rider when seated often bounces up and down on the seat, which puts stress on the body of the rider.
      <br/>
      Many riders learn to reduce the uncomfortable effects caused by rough waters by standing with each leg bent at the knee.
      <br/>
      When the personal water craft moves up or down the rider can bend or flex his legs to absorb some of the resulting shock.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      Several systems have been devised for user comfort; however, each has one or more significant drawbacks.
      <br/>
      One such system, shown in U.S. Pat. No. 5,603,281 (1997), shows a personal water craft reconstructed in a new design to implement an effective shock absorber.
      <br/>
      The disadvantages of this suspension system are adapting it to existing and newly manufactured personal water craft without a suspension design.
      <br/>
      This suspension is complex, not adjustable and is an expensive feature.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      Siebert in U.S. Pat. No. 2,787,315 (1954), shows a spring seat for outboard boats.
      <br/>
      The spring seat of Seibert is not designed to mount to a personal water craft.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      Gauss, in U.S. Pat. No. 3,427,038 (1969), shows a complex suspension system designed for the entire floor of a boat to move.
      <br/>
      This system is designed for large boats and thus shares the same disadvantage as that of Siebert's.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      O'Link in U.S. Pat. No. 3,186,674 (1965), shows an improvement in a suspension system for a boat seat.
      <br/>
      This system is not designed to mount to personal water craft and thus shares the disadvantage of Siebert's.

    <p num="8">
      Mardikinian in U.S. Pat. No. 5,309,861 (1994), shows a personal water craft reconstructed in a new design to implement an effective shock absorber.
      <br/>
      It is similar to U.S. Pat. No. 5,603,281 (1997) and thus shares the same disadvantages.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      Jones in U.S. Pat. No. 4,909,177 (1990), shows an inflatable boat seat to mount to the interior of an inflatable boat.
      <br/>
      One disadvantages of this seat is that it is not easily adaptable to a personal water craft.
    </p>
    <p num="10">Harvey, Renaud, Gagnon, Rondeau, LaPointe in U.S. Pat. No. 5,542,371 (1996), shows a more complex version of U.S. Pat. No. 5,603,281 (1997) and which shares the same disadvantages.</p>
    <p num="11">
      Mardikinian in U.S. Pat. No. 5,465,679 (1995), shows a suspension system in which the floorboards of a personal water craft absorb the shock.

    <p num="29">
      Referring now to the drawings and particularly to FIG. 1, there is shown therein, a schematic view representative of an exemplary embodiment of a bladder 10 of the present invention.
      <br/>
      The bladder 10 is comprised of a molded flexible water resistant material such as a synthetic rubber.
      <br/>
      The bladder 10 includes a valve stem 14 molded into the bladder which enables the bladder to be inflated with inexpensive gases such as air.
      <br/>
      In addition the valve stem enables the internal pressure of the bladder to be easily adjusted depending on the desired suspension characteristics of the rider.
    </p>
    <p num="30">
      The bladder 10 includes a shape that is adapted for placement between the hull and seat of a PWC.
      <br/>
      The bladder is operative to compress and expand responsive to forces acting between the hull and seat.
      <br/>
      This enables the bladder to dampen the effects of bumps and other shocks or vibrations by allowing the seat to move up and down with respect to the hull.
    </p>
    <p num="31">
      Mounting holes 12 are clearance holed molded into the bladder to enable the bladder to be permanently fastened to the underside of the PWC seat if desired.
      <br/>
      In such embodiments the bladder 10 may be permanently attached to the seat with rivets, glue or any other operative connecting means.
    </p>
    <p num="32">
      As shown in FIG. 1A, the bladder includes top and bottom gasket surfaces 16 that have a shape and contour which corresponds to the opposing surfaces of the seat and the hull.
      <br/>
      The gasket surfaces are operative to prevent water from entering the PWC from between the seat and hull.
      <br/>
      Although the exemplary embodiment is shown with relatively flat gasket surfaces, alternative embodiments of the bladder may include any shape which is operative to create a water tight seal between with both the seat and the hull.
    </p>
    <p num="33">
      FIGS. 2 and 3 show exemplary views of telescopic connectors 18 and 40 that are operative to releaseably mount the seat to the hull of a PWC when the bladder is positioned between the seat and the hull.
      <br/>
      These telescopic connectors enable the seat to move up and down with respect to the hull while keeping pressure on the gasket surface of the bladder for maintaining the watertight seal between the seat and hull.
    </p>
    <p num="34">
      The telescopic latch connector 18 shown in FIG. 2 is operative to replace a standard stock prior art fixed latch mounting stud 52 which is shown in FIG. 2B. This described telescoping latch connector 18 includes a shaft 22 with integral locking head 20.
      <br/>
      As shown in FIG. 2A, the shaft is in operative connection with a piston head 34 that is operative to reciprocate within a cylinder body 28.
      <br/>
      The cylinder body includes a compression spring 36 between the piston head 34 and a retaining plug 38.
      <br/>
      The compression spring 36 is operative to bias the piston head 34 in a direction that moves the shaft 22 to an extended or expanded position for latching the locking head 20 to the seat of the PWC.
      <br/>
      The cylinder body 28 includes a washer 32 between the piston head 34 and cylinder body 28.
      <br/>
      The washer 32 is operative to minimize water entering the cylinder body and further acts as a sound buffer when the piston 34 taps the end of the cylinder body 28.
    </p>
    <p num="35">
      The telescopic latch connector 18 replaces an original stock fixed latch stud 52 by sliding through the original stock hole in the personal water craft fiberglass hull 30.
      <br/>
      The cylinder body 28 is threaded to receive locking nuts 26 for mounting the telescopic connector in the hull 30.
      <br/>
      The locking nuts 26 along with washers 24 enable the telescoping latch stud 18 to be adjustably positioned on the PWC hull 30 for providing the required amount of gasket pressure for the bladder.
    </p>
    <p num="36">
      FIG. 3 shows an exemplary telescopic U hook connector 40 that is operative to replace a stock fixed front U hook 54 as shown in FIG. 3A. This described telescopic U hook 40 includes a U bolt 42 with integral stop washers 44.
      <br/>
      Each side of the threaded U bolt 42 includes the compression spring 46 under the welded stop washers 44.
      <br/>
      The stop washers 44 are weld fastened to the threaded U bolt 42 and act as a stopper for the compression springs 46.
      <br/>
      The threaded U bolt 42 replaces the original stock fixed U bolt 54 shown in FIG. 3A by sliding through the original stock holes in the personal water craft fiberglass hull 30.
      <br/>
      Both ends of the threaded U bolt 40 include washers 48 which are sandwiched between the hull and locking nuts 50.
      <br/>
      Washers 48 are operative to absorb sound and impact of the up and down movement in the telescoping U hook 40.
    </p>
    <p num="37">
      It is to be understood that the described telescopic connectors are representative of one exemplary embodiment of the present invention.
      <br/>
      Other embodiments may include alternative telescopic configurations to correspond to the latching mechanisms required for other hull and seat designs.
      <br/>
      In addition all elements that comprise this invention are preferable non-corrosive, water and U.V. resistant.
    </p>
    <p num="38">
      FIGS. 4-6 show a stock PWC 58 that is being retrofitted with the suspension system of the present invention.
      <br/>
      FIG. 4 is representative of the stock PWC 58 with hull 60 and seat 62.
      <br/>
      FIG. 5 shows the relative locations for installing the telescopic latch connector 18, bladder 10, and telescopic U hook 40 in the PWC 58.
