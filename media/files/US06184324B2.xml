    <heading>CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS</heading>
    <p num="1">This application claims priority from U.S. provisional application serial No. 60/033,114 entitled, "Synthesis of Acrylates Suitable for Production of Polymer", filed Dec. 18, 1996, which is incorporated herein by reference.</p>
    <heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">
      The present invention relates to high energy density capacitors and the dielectric materials used therein.
      <br/>
      It particularly relates to dielectric materials of polymerized (alpha-substituted)acrylate monomers for use in a thin film capacitor, such as a polymer multilayer capacitor.
    </p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="3">
      Capacitors, which basically include two electrodes separated by a dielectric material, are used in a wide variety of electrical applications to accumulate and store an electrical charge.
      <br/>
      The development of electronic devices and circuits of reduced size has led to a need for significantly smaller capacitors having increased capacity per unit volume and high temperature capabilities.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      Thin polymer films offer significant potential to produce smaller capacitors with increased capacity per unit volume.
      <br/>
      Such capacitors could therefore reduce the size of implantable devices, such as defibrillators, which currently use relatively large aluminum electrolytic capacitors in which the dielectric is aluminum oxide.
      <br/>
      Such large capacitors have an energy density of about 2 Joules/centimeter3 (J/cm3), which leads to capacitors of about 15 cm3.
      <br/>
      Smaller and lighter weight capacitors having higher energy densities (e.g., at least about 3 J/cm3) would provide significant advantage in decreasing the size of implantable devices.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      One type of small, high energy density capacitor is referred to as a polymer multilayer (PML) capacitor.
      <br/>
      Examples of such capacitors are described, for example, in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,499,520 (Cichanowski), 4,490,774 (Olson et al.), 4,954,371 (Yializis), 5,097,800 (Shaw et al.), and 5,032,461 (Shaw et al.).
      <br/>
      They are typically made by a vapor deposition process in which a polymerizable compound is vapor deposited onto a substrate and polymerized to form a polymer film.
      <br/>
      The polymerizable compounds are typically polymerized using electron beam or ultraviolet radiation.
      <br/>
      The polymer films are then typically metallized by either sputtering or vapor depositing a metal, such as aluminum.
      <br/>
      These processes (vapor coating, polymerizing, and metallizing) are repeated until the desired number of layers has been achieved.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      Although there are a number of polymeric dielectric materials known for use in high energy density capacitors, such as PML capacitors, there is still a need for a wider variety of such materials that have the potential to produce smaller capacitors with increased capacity per unit volume.
      <br/>
      There is a particular need to produce small high energy density capacitors for use in high voltage defibrillators.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      A number of patents and other documents have been reviewed in which polymeric dielectric materials are disclosed.
      <br/>
      Also, a number of patents have been reviewed in which capacitors, particularly PML capacitors, are disclosed.

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
    <p num="16">
      The present invention is directed to organic polymeric dielectric materials for use in high energy density capacitors.
      <br/>
      Such materials are typically in the form of thin films.
      <br/>
      As used herein, a "high energy density" capacitor is one that has an energy density of at least about 3 J/cm3.
    </p>
    <p num="17">
      Materials with a high dielectric constant (e.g., at least about 7) are insulators which, in addition to having low conductive properties, have significant capacitance (i.e., charge storage) properties.
      <br/>
      For two parallel plate electrodes separated by a dielectric material, the capacitance is measured as the charge divided by the voltage across the electrodes.
      <br/>
      The higher the capacitance, the more charge can be separated by the dielectric material (and, hence, "stored") at a given voltage.
      <br/>
      Capacitance is due to charge transfer resulting from molecular cooperativity (i.e., alignment) among dipoles in the dielectric material.
      <br/>
      Capacitance (C) is a function of the area and separation of the parallel plate electrodes according to the following equations:
      <br/>
      C0 = EPSILON 0 (A/D) and C= EPSILON 0 EPSILON '(A/D)
    </p>
    <p num="18">where</p>
    <p num="19">
      C0 =capacitance of free space between the electrodes
      <br/>
      C=capacitance of the material under test
      <br/>
      EPSILON 0 =permittivity of free space (a constant)
      <br/>
      EPSILON '=relative permittivity of the material under test
      <br/>
      A=area of parallel plate electrode
      <br/>
      D=separation of the parallel plate electrode
    </p>
    <p num="20">
      so,
      <br/>
      EPSILON '=C/C0
    </p>
    <p num="21">
      The relative permittivity ( EPSILON ') can be measured by standard techniques, where an AC voltage of known frequency placed across the dielectric material results in a measurable current of the same frequency.
      <br/>
      This current can be separated into capacitive and conductive components because the current due to conduction is in phase with the voltage, but the current due to capacitive phenomena is 90 (degree)  out of phase with the voltage.
      <br/>
      The analysis gives two quantities: 1) the relative permittivity ( EPSILON '), a measure of the dipole (capacitive) response; and 2) the loss factor ( EPSILON "), a measure of both ionic conductivity and dipole response.
    </p>
    <p num="22">
      The relative permittivity ( EPSILON ') is a measure of the ability of the dielectric material to store charge.
      <br/>
      A high  EPSILON ' value is desired for high energy density capacitors.
      <br/>
      The  EPSILON ' will vary with the frequency and temperature of measurement.
      <br/>
      At high frequency the molecular structure has insufficient time to align its dipoles efficiently, and an unrelaxed relative permittivity ( EPSILON u ') is measured.
      <br/>
      At sufficiently low frequency, the structure has adequate time to align its dipoles, and a relaxed relative permittivity ( EPSILON r ') is measured.
      <br/>
      The  EPSILON r ' is greater than the  EPSILON u ' value.
      <br/>
      The  EPSILON r ' value is more reflective of the structure of the dielectric material than the  EPSILON u ' value because the dipole response requires cooperativity in molecular motion to orient the dipoles on the polymer.
      <br/>
      To best measure the relative permittivity as a property of a dielectric material's structure, the  EPSILON r ' value should be measured.
      <br/>
      The  EPSILON r ' is frequently referred to as the relaxed dielectric constant, or the low frequency dielectric constant.
      <br/>
      In this document, the term dielectric constant means the relaxed relative permittivity ( EPSILON r ').
      <br/>
      Preferably, suitable organic polymeric dielectric materials of the present invention have a dielectric constant of at least about 7, and more preferably, at least about 10, as cured and determined according to the procedure described in the Examples.
    </p>
    <p num="23">
      The loss factor ( EPSILON ") is a frequency and temperature dependent function of both ionic conductivity and dipole response.
      <br/>
      The  EPSILON " can be used to measure conductivity at sufficiently low frequency, or dipole response at higher frequency.
      <br/>
      The  EPSILON " at sufficiently high frequency is a measure of loss in charge due to molecular rearrangements necessary to facilitate dipole alignment.
      <br/>
      A portion of the total charge is dissipated as heat to the polymer matrix during this cooperative molecular process.
      <br/>
      A commonly used term for expressing this energy loss is the dissipation factor (or, loss tangent; tan  DELTA = EPSILON " /  EPSILON ').
      <br/>
      The higher the dissipation factor, the more energy is lost to the dielectric material, and the less charge is transferred between electrodes.
      <br/>
      The measurement is made directly from the phase angle difference ( DELTA ) between the applied AC voltage and the resulting AC current.
      <br/>
      A pure conductor (i.e., resistor) will result in no phase angle shift; the frequency of the voltage in and the current out will be the same and in-phase.
      <br/>
      However, a pure capacitor will result in a 90 (degree)  phase angle lag.
      <br/>
      Dielectric materials with both conductive and capacitive properties will have a phase shift between 0 (degree)  and 90 (degree)  (i.e., tan  DELTA &gt;0).
      <br/>
      A low value of tan  DELTA  is desired for energy transfer efficiency in high energy density capacitors.
      <br/>
      In this document, the term dissipation factor means the loss factor divided by the relaxed relative permittivity (i.e., tan  DELTA = EPSILON " /  EPSILON r '), taken at the same frequency and temperature.
      <br/>
      Preferably, suitable organic polymeric dielectric materials of the present invention have a dissipation factor of no greater than about 0.10, and more preferably, no greater than about 0.05, as cured and determined according to the procedure described in the Examples.
    </p>
    <p num="24">
      Dielectric strength is also an important characteristic of a dielectric material.
      <br/>
      In a high energy density capacitor, electrical breakdown (failure of the dielectric material in the capacitor) occurs when the applied voltage can no longer be maintained stable without excessive current flow and physical disruption.
      <br/>
      This failure of the dielectric material, due to high voltage stress, is called voltage breakdown.
      <br/>
      The dielectric strength is the measured voltage gradient at failure (usually in units of V/:m; the voltage divided by the thickness of the dielectric between the electrodes).
      <br/>
      Dielectric strength is measured by ASTM D149 using an AC voltage source increased at a constant rate across a dielectric of known thickness.
      <br/>
      Preferably, suitable organic polymeric dielectric materials of the present invention have a dielectric strength of at least about 250 V/:m, and more preferably, at least about 400 V/:m.
    </p>
    <p num="25">
      Such organic polymeric dielectric materials are made from one or more polymerizable compounds that include at least one polymerizable group and at least one dipole (i.e., dipole group).
      <br/>
      Preferably, the polymerizable compounds have at least two dipoles per molecule, and more preferably, at least two dipoles and at least two polymerizable groups per molecule.
      <br/>
      Such dipoles are preferably mobile, particularly once the compounds are polymerized.
      <br/>
      That is, upon polymerizing the compounds, the dipoles are capable of motion such that they can be oriented in an applied electric field.
      <br/>
      The dielectric material can also include polymerized monomers that do not have such dipole groups, as long as the dielectric material has a dielectric constant of at least about 7.
      <br/>
      Thus, mixtures of various monomers can be used to prepare the organic polymeric dielectric materials of the present invention.
    </p>
    <p num="26">
      To provide this mobility, the dipoles are typically pendant from the polymeric chain and attached to the remainder of the polymeric chain through a heteroatom-containing linking group.
      <br/>
      Such linking groups typically include at least one bond with a rotational energy barrier of less than about 2.8 kcal/mole, and preferably less than about 2.0 kcal/mole, when in the gas phase.
      <br/>
      As used herein, the "rotational energy barrier" or "gas phase rotational energy barrier" is the difference between the highest and lowest energy conformers for the bond under consideration in the gas phase.
      <br/>
      Rotational energy barrier values can be calculated based on information for gas phase monomers containing such bonds provided by Lowe, "Barriers to Internal Rotation and Single Bonds," Progress in Physical Organic Chemistry, Vol. 6, pages 1-80, Streitweiser, Jr., and Taft, ed., Interscience Publishers, 1968.
      <br/>
      For example, a C--C bond in (e.g., CH3 --CH3) has a gas phase rotational energy barrier of about 2.8 kcal/mole to about 3.9 kcal/mole, whereas a C--Si bond (e.g., CH3 --SiH3) has a gas phase rotational energy barrier of about 1.4 kcal/mole to about 1.8 kcal/mole, a C--N bond (e.g., CH3 --NH2) has a gas phase rotational energy barrier of about 2.0 kcal/mole, and a C--O bond (e.g., CH3 --OH) has a gas phase rotational energy barrier of about 1.1 kcal/mole.
      <br/>
      The linking group includes one or more heteroatoms and one atom in the main polymeric chain, which can be the heteroatom (e.g., oxygen, silicon, sulfur, or nitrogen atom), although the heteroatom(s) of the linking group are typically not part of the main polymeric chain.
      <br/>
      The heteroatom(s), e.g., oxygen, can also be present in the linking group in the form of a functional group, e.g., carbonyl group.
    </p>
    <p num="27">
      The polymerizable groups are preferably (alpha-substituted)acrylate groups (e.g., acrylates, methacrylates).
      <br/>
      By placing the term "alpha-substituted" in parentheses, this means that the alpha carbon of the acrylate group may or may not be substituted.
      <br/>
      Thus, the monomers are referred to herein as alkyl (alpha-substituted)acrylates.
      <br/>
      This can include monofunctional alkyl (alpha-substituted)acrylates of the formula R'--O--C(O)--CR".dbd.CH2 substituted with one or more dipoles in R' and/or R".
      <br/>
      In this formula, R' is an organic group, preferably, a C1 -C30 organic group, more preferably, a C1 -C8 organic group, which may be aliphatic, alicyclic, aromatic, or a combination thereof, optionally containing heteroatoms or functional groups, and R" is H or an organic group, preferably C1 -C5 organic group, which is typically an aliphatic group, optionally containing heteroatoms or functional groups.
      <br/>
      Such monomers include acrylates and alpha-substituted acrylates, such as methacrylates.
      <br/>
      The alkyl (alpha-substituted)acrylates can also include multifunctional acrylates, such as oxybismethacrylates of the type disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,889,948 (Mathias et al.), substituted with one or more dipoles.
      <br/>
      Mixtures of alkyl (alpha-substituted)acrylates can be used to make the organic polymeric dielectric material of the present invention.
      <br/>
      Also, mixtures of alkyl (alpha-substituted)acrylates with other polymerizable monomers without the acrylate functionality can also be used to make the organic polymeric dielectric material of the present invention.
    </p>
    <p num="28">
      The dipole groups are an assemblage of one or more atoms that have partial or unitary electric charges of opposite sign separated by a finite distance.
      <br/>
      The degree of polarity is typically a function of the distance between the atoms and the electronegativity of the individual atoms.
      <br/>
      Preferably, the degree of polarity is defined by the group's electronegativity.
      <br/>
      Group electronegativities are described in Wells, Prog.
      <br/>
      Phys. Org. Chem., 6, 111-145 (1968) and Inamoto et al., Chemistry Letters, 1003-1006 (1982).
      <br/>
      Suitable dipoles have a group electronegativity that is preferably at least about 2.5, more preferably, at least about 2.75, even more preferably, at least about 3.0, and most preferably, at least about 3.2. Examples of preferred dipole groups (including single atoms) include cyano groups, sulfone groups (including alkyl sulfones), sulfoxide groups, halogen atoms, pyrrolidonyl groups, furfuryl groups, tetrahydrofurfuryl groups, acetyl groups, acetylenyl groups, phenylacetylenyl groups, 2,2,2-trifluoroethyl groups, nitrile groups, cyanoethyl groups, methoxy groups, acetate groups, carbonate groups, diphenyl groups, dinitrile groups, difluoromethyl groups, dichloroethyl groups, trifluoromethyl groups, trichloromethyl groups, formyl groups, trifluoroacetyl groups, phenylketone groups, ester groups, cyanoester groups, acetamide groups, trifluoroacetamide groups, amines, alkylamines, dialkylamines, nitro groups, hydroxyl groups, ketones, ethers, trifluoromethyl ether groups, phenylethyl groups, salts thereof, and combinations thereof.
    </p>
    <p num="29">
      In order to fully exploit the potential of high energy density capacitors, particularly thin film capacitors such as PML capacitors, the alkyl (alpha-substituted)acrylate compounds (i.e., alkyl (alpha-substituted)acrylate monomers) used to produce the organic polymeric dielectric materials should preferably have a relatively high density of dipole groups per unit weight (i.e., a sufficient number of dipoles such that the polymer has a dielectric constant of at least about 7).
      <br/>
      Typically, this occurs if at least about 1 weight percent, preferably, at least about 5 weight percent, and more preferably, at least about 10 weight percent, of the monomers, or polymers produced therefrom, are dipole groups.
    </p>
    <p num="30">
      The alkyl (alpha-substituted)acrylate monomers used in making the organic polymeric dielectric materials also preferably have two or more polymerizable groups per molecule (hence, are multifunctional) to ensure that the product formed is a crosslinked organic polymeric dielectric material.
      <br/>
      Preferably, the crosslinks include --CH2 --O--CH2 -- moieties.
      <br/>
      Crosslinking contributes to the polymer having the ability to withstand the voltages experienced by high energy density capacitors without decomposing or melting.
      <br/>
      As a result, the more highly crosslinked the polymer, the higher the dielectric strength of the material.
    </p>
    <p num="31">
      The alkyl (alpha-substituted)acrylate monomers used in making the organic polymeric dielectric materials preferably have a high oxygen content to permit effective clearing (e.g., substantially complete oxidation) and little, if any, carbon formation, which produces undesirable conductivity.
      <br/>
      Thus, the organic polymeric dielectric materials of the present invention have effective clearing or self-healing properties as described in Reed, IEEE Transactions on Dielectrics and Electrical Insulation, 1, 904-922 (1994).
    </p>
    <p num="32">
      The alkyl (alpha-substituted)acrylate monomers used in making the organic polymeric dielectric materials preferably have a molecular weight of less than 600 grams/mole and are liquid at or near room temperature (20-25 (degree)  C.).
      <br/>
      This is particularly desirable for efficient delivery during manufacture of the capacitors.

      However, dielectric materials having a dielectric constant of at least about 7 can be formed from mixtures of these compounds with each other or with other alkyl (alpha-substituted)acrylates.
      <br/>
      These compounds are believed to be new compositions of matter, and as such, are provided by the present invention.

    <p num="42">
      Such compounds can be prepared by one of skill in synthetic organic chemistry.
      <br/>
      For Example, Scheme 1 below shows a monomer that could by synthesized using the commercially available compound 1 as the starting material.
      <br/>
      Reduction using boron or aluminum hydrides would give the di(butyronitrile)silane (J.
      <br/>
      Seyden-Penne, Reductions by the Alumino- and Borohydrides in Organic Synthesis, VCH Publishers, New York, N.Y., 1991, p. 144).
      <br/>
      This silane can be converted to a polymerizable monomer by reacting with two equivalents of a protected allylic alcohol, such as allyl acetate (Speier, Adv.
      <br/>
      Organomet. Chem., 17, 407-447, 1979).
      <br/>
      After deprotection and acrylation, compound 2 would result.
      <br/>
      Acrylation could be accomplished using acrylic acid, acryloyl chloride, transesterification, or any other synthetic equivalent.  (Chemical Structure image '3' not included in text)
    </p>
    <p num="43">
      Alditols are also good starting materials for the synthesis of monomers that can be polymerized to materials with high dielectric constants.
      <br/>
      Alditols are molecules include a linear carbon chain with a hydroxyl group attached to each of the carbons.
      <br/>
      Since alditols are synthesized by reduction of sugars, they are commonly available with carbon chains of three to six carbons, and in a wide variety of stereochemistries.
      <br/>
      An example of how an alditol can be transformed to a monomer useful for making capacitors is shown in Scheme 2.
      <br/>
      The starting alditol 3 could represent erythritol or threitol, because the stereochemistry is not specified, and the method described could be used with higher molecular weight alditols.
      <br/>
      The first step is to protect the primary hydroxyls as the ethoxyethyl ethers (Semmelhack et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc., 103, 2427 (1981)).
      <br/>
      Then the remaining hydroxyls are cyanoethylated (Bruson, "Cyanoethylation", Organic Reactions, Volume V, edited by R. Adams, John Wiley and Sons, Inc., New York, N.Y., 1949), using acrylonitrile in the presence of a basic catalyst, yielding compound 4.
      <br/>
      After deprotection and acrylation, the monomer 5 results.
      <br/>
      Acrylation could be accomplished by the methods described above.
      <br/>
      It is expected that monomers made from higher alditols would have higher relaxed relative permittivities, because a higher percentage of their molecular weight consists of the polar nitrile groups.
      <br/>
      The stereochemistry of the alditol used is expected to be important, because this stereochemistry can affect the mobility of the polar side chains.  (Chemical Structure image '4' not included in text)

      Compound 7 can then be converted to the corresponding oxybismethacrylate ether, 8, by heating with DABCO and formaldehyde (Tsuda et al., Polymer, 35(15), 3317-3328 (1994)).  (Chemical Structure image '5' not included in text)

      Compound 10 can be cyanoethylated, giving the dicyanoethylated compound 11.

      The intermediate 10 can also be halogenated using thionyl chloride or phosphorous tribromide (Villieras et al., Synthesis, 924 (1982)).

      To allow synthesis of materials in which polar groups are attached to the periphery of the molecule and to the central scaffold that links the polymerizable units together, a strategy such as the one shown in Scheme 6 can be used.

      In this scheme, an alpha-chloromethylacryloyl chloride intermediate 13 is generated.
      <br/>
      In the first step, tert-butyl acrylate is treated with formaldehyde and DABCO.
      <br/>
      Running this reaction in the presence of water forces the equilibrium to favor the formation of tert-butyl alpha-hydroxymethylacrylate.

      This compound can then be treated with thionyl chloride to generate the alpha-chloromethylacryloyl chloride intermediate 13 (Jariwala et al., Macromolecules, 26, 5129-5136 (1993)).

      The original synthesis is less than optimal because commercially available cyanoethylacrylate contains about fifteen percent di(ethyleneglycol) diacrylate as a side product of synthesis, which cannot be easily removed.
      <br/>
      The presence of this side product results in the formation of a mixture of isomers, instead of a single product.
      <br/>
      The route shown in Scheme 7 allows the synthesis of the desired product as a single isomer.
      <br/>
      Tert-butyl acrylate is converted to the di-tert-butyl oxybismethacrylate, which can then be converted to the diacid chloride by treatment with thionyl chloride (Tsuda, Polymer, 35(15), 3317-3328 (1994)).

      A schematic representation of a system 10 used to form a PML capacitor sheet using the compounds of the present invention is shown in FIG. 1.

      In this system and method, a liquid polymerizable monomer or mixture of monomers is pumped from a monomer delivery system 11 into a vacuum chamber 12, fitted with a vacuum pump (not shown) where it is atomized using an ultrasonic atomizer 14 and evaporated using evaporator 15.
      <br/>
      It is then deposited onto a substrate, such as polyethylene terephthalate or other polymer film, on a rotating drum 16 (or directly on the drum) to form a condensed liquid film of this polymerizable monomers.
      <br/>
      This liquid film is then polymerized, and preferably crosslinked, by irradiation, such as by electron beam irradiation using an electron beam gun 17, to form a polymeric film.
      <br/>
      Other forms of irradiation can also be used, such as ultraviolet irradiation.
      <br/>
      As the drum 16 continues to turn, a layer of metal is evaporated onto the polymeric film.
      <br/>
      This metallization step can be carried out by a variety of methods, such as by sputtering or vapor depositing.
      <br/>
      For example, as shown in FIG. 1, a wire feed 18 is directed to a resistive evaporation system 19, where the metal is evaporated onto the polymer film on the rotating drum 16.
      <br/>
      The metal is typically aluminum, although it could be a wide variety of electrically conductive materials (e.g., metals), such as zinc.
      <br/>
      These processes (vapor coating, polymerizing, and metallizing) are repeated until the desired number of layers has been achieved.

    <p num="53">
      Alternatively, a spin coating process can be used in which a polymerizable monomer or a mixture of polymerizable monomers is deposited onto a substrate.

      <br/>
      A preferred process is represented by the flowchart shown in FIG. 4.
      <br/>
      To form a capacitor from the capacitor sheet (i.e., strap) 20 of FIG. 2, the capacitor sheet is rough cut, vacuum baked under mechanical pressure to finish cure and flatten the sheet, and then diced into small pieces or blocks.
      <br/>
      As shown in FIG. 2, this typically occurs along lines 25 to form a capacitor block of the desired size.
      <br/>
      Such pieces (i.e., blocks) are typically about 2-3 centimeters long, by about 2-3 centimeters wide, by about 1-3 millimeters thick.
      <br/>
      The edges of each capacitor piece are then typically smoothed by ashing them in an oxygen plasma, for example, followed by removing the fringes of the electrode material using, for example, isopropanol in an ultrasonic bath in a desmearing step.
      <br/>
      The termination edges of the pieces of capacitor sheet are then ashed in an oxygen plasma to remove dielectric material between the electrode layers and expose the electrode layers.
      <br/>
      This removal typically occurs as the result of etching in a vacuum using, for example, a 50 Watt oxygen plasma generated at 100 kilohertz.
      <br/>
      These exposed electrode layers at the edges of the blocks of capacitor sheet are then coated with layers of nickel or copper, for example, by vapor deposition or sputtering.
      <br/>
      This establishes reliable electrical connections between the electrodes and strengthens the exposed electrode ends.
      <br/>
      This layer of metal (e.g., nickel or copper) is typically about 1000 angstroms to about 1500 angstroms thick.
      <br/>
      Solder material is applied to the outer nickel or copper layer in a wave solder step, and the edges are then optionally treated to clean them to prevent arcing.
      <br/>
      A variety of the pieces of capacitor sheet are then assembled and electrically connected to form a terminal, which is then optionally encapsulated in epoxy, for example, as a passivation layer and moisture barrier.

      Cyanoethylation of SOLKETAL: This reaction was performed in an inert atmosphere glovebox.
      <br/>
      Five hundred grams SOLKETAL were placed in a dry 1000 mL 3-neck round-bottom flask.
      <br/>
      This flask was then outfitted with a stir bar and stirring started. 280 mg sodium metal were added and the necks of the flask were sealed with rubber septa, one of which was pierced with a hypodermic needle to allow pressure equalization.
      <br/>
      The reaction was stirred until the sodium dissolved. 205 g acrylonitrile were then added dropwise via a pressure-equalizing addition funnel.
      <br/>
      A five degree exotherm was observed.
      <br/>
      The reaction was stirred overnight.
      <br/>
      The next day, the flask was outfitted with a condenser and thermometer.
      <br/>
      The reaction was heated to 93 (degree)  C. with no visible reflux, indicating the reaction had gone to completion (the boiling point of acrylonitrile is 77 (degree)  C.).
      <br/>
      The sodium was neutralized by adding one equivalent of hydrochloric acid in 10 mL water.
      <br/>
      The reaction mixture was transferred to a one liter single neck flask and vacuum distilled through a 42 inch vacuum jacketed and silvered distillation column.
      <br/>
      This column was one inch in diameter and packed with 0.16 inch PRO-PAK brand distillation packing.
      <br/>
      After the forerun, consisting primarily of unreacted SOLKETAL, 503.8 grams of product were collected (72% based on SOLKETAL).

      Acetic acid was added slowly while stirring until a single phase formed (57.55 g acetic acid were used).
      <br/>
      The reaction was stirred at room temperature overnight.
      <br/>
      The acetic acid and water were removed by distillation.
      <br/>
      The remaining material was dissolved in an equal volume of tetrahydrofuran and filtered through a chromatography column containing basic alumina.
      <br/>
      The solution was then filtered through an inch of neutral alumina in a fritted disc filter and through paper.

    <p num="81">
      A liquid diacrylate-containing monomer, such as di-2-cyanoethyl oxybismethacrylate, was mixed with 0.2% (nominal) IRGACURE I-184 photoinitiator, followed by mixing for 1 hour at room temperature.
      <br/>
      Approximately 0.5 cm3 was placed over the silvered area of a Micromet System III Microdielectrometer low conductivity IC chip sensor.
      <br/>
      The coated sensor was degassed in a vacuum oven for 15 seconds.
      <br/>
      It was then passed under a UV light source at a constant rate (Fusion Systems; D bulb, speed 5, UVA dose=6.1 J/cm2) to begin polymerization.
      <br/>
      The extent of polymerization was monitored by the decrease in log conductivity of the sample with the Microdielectrometer.
      <br/>
      The cure was finished when the log conductivity did not change with additional UV passes.

    <p num="82">Test Procedure for Measurement of Dielectric Properties</p>
    <p num="83">
      The dielectric properties of the cured diacrylate-containing monomer, such as di-2-cyanoethyl oxybismethacrylate, were measured with a Micromet System III Microdielectrometer.
      <br/>
      The sample had already been completely cured on a calibrated Micromet low conductivity IC chip sensor as described above.
      <br/>
      The sample was subjected to a frequency scan (approximately 100,000-1 Hz) at ambient temperature, while the permittivity and loss factor were measured at each discreet frequency.
      <br/>
      A Cole-Cole plot was constructed (Loss Factor vs Permittivity), and the relaxed relative permittivity was extrapolated from the dipole response at high frequency and the ionic conduction at low frequency (FIG. 6).
      <br/>
      The relaxed relative permittivity is equivalent to the dielectric constant at the lowest frequency where a true dipole response is observed.
      <br/>
      The relaxed relative permittivity is characteristic of the dipole nature of the crosslinked polymer independent of any frequency-induced viscoelastic response.
      <br/>
      The dissipation factor is a measure of the dielectric energy loss due to viscous phenomena in the polymer.
      <br/>
      The dissipation factor is equivalent to tan  DELTA (=Loss Factor/Relaxed Relative Permittivity).
    </p>
    <p num="84">
      Using these methods, the following acrylate-containing monomers were first UV cured, and then were tested for dielectric properties (dielectric constant and dissipation factor) at ambient temperature.

      The results are reported below in Table 1.
