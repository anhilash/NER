    <p num="1">This application claims priority upon U.S. provisional application serial No. 60/034,163, filed Dec. 28, 1996; the contents of which are herein incorporated by this reference in their entirety.</p>
    <heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">The invention relates to a process for deactivating a polymerization catalyst used for the preparation of polycarbonates.</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND</heading>
    <p num="3">
      Poly(2,2,4,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclobutylene carbonate), the polycarbonate of 2,2,4,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclobutanediol, has been formed by melt polymerization processes employing basic alkali metal catalysts.
      <br/>
      But the polycarbonate is somewhat thermally unstable due to the presence of basic alkali metal catalyst residue.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      Various methods of adding acidic material to destroy the basic catalyst residues which remain in polycarbonates and cause instability have been reported in the literature.
      <br/>
      For example, U.S. Pat. No. 3,022,272 discloses that materials such as aromatic sulfonic acid, organic acid halides and chlorocarbonates, dialkyl sulfates, and acid salts of inorganic acids such as ammonium sulfate are useful "catalyst killers."
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      The acidic materials that have been used for this purpose have practical disadvantages.
      <br/>
      The aromatic sulfonic acids, acid halides and, to a lesser extent, the acid salts of inorganic acids, are corrosive and some, particularly the strong acids such as toluenesulfonic acid, have been found to produce undesirable color in the finished product.
      <br/>
      The dialkyl sulfates, while not so corrosive, are known to be both toxic and possibly carcinogenic, and the presence of traces of them in the final product would present a problem for the consumer, especially if the plastic was used in food or cosmetic containers.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      Another problem with many known deactivation methods is that the catalyst is not completely deactivated.
      <br/>
      Evidence of remaining active catalyst is shown in U.S. Pat. No. 3,022,272 which discloses that, after deactivation of the catalysts, the interesterification can be further continued to a limited extent in order to further increase the molecular weight of the polymer.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      U.S. Pat. No. 2,210,617 discloses a process for preparing a polycarbonate in the presence of an alkali metal catalyst.
      <br/>
      After polymerization, the excess alkali metal is removed by washing with a strong acid such as hydrochloric acid.
      <br/>
      The polymerization is then completed by further heating under vacuum.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      U.S. Defensive Publication T873,016 discloses removal of basic alkali metal catalyst residues from poly(2,2,4,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclobutylene carbonate) in the solid state or in solution.
      <br/>
      The process therein is conducted by contacting the polymer with an acidic organic compound having solvent power and an ionization constant of about 2 * 10-1 to 2.5 * 10-6, followed by extraction either with the acid, or by dissolving the polymer in a water-immiscible solvent and extracting the solution with water.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      In light of the above, it is highly desirable to provide a process for increasing the thermal stability of poly(2,2,4,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclobutylene carbonate) containing active alkali metal catalysts by completely deactivating the catalyst residue contained in the polymer.
      <br/>
      It would be especially desirable to provide a catalyst deactivation method which does not require the use of strongly acidic, corrosive, or volatile materials, nor washing or extraction of the catalyst from the polymer.

    <p num="36">at a temperature and time sufficient to form a deactivated polycarbonate.</p>
    <p num="37">The invention further relates to a process of deactivating a polycarbonate, comprising admixing the polycarbonate containing an active alkali metal catalyst residue with a phosphorous compound at a temperature and time sufficient to deactivate the alkali metal catalyst to form a deactivated polycarbonate, wherein the deactivated catalyst is not removed from the deactivated polycarbonate.</p>
    <p num="38">The applicants unexpectedly discovered a process by which particular phosphorus-containing compounds can be used to completely deactivate basic alkali metal catalyst residues contained in poly(2,2,4,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclobutylene carbonate), therefore substantially increasing the thermal stability of the polymer.</p>
    <p num="39">The effectiveness of the present deactivation process on poly(2,2,4,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclobutylene carbonate) was particularly surprising since thermal stabilization of aliphatic polycarbonates by the addition of an acidic material is not generally useful or expected.</p>
    <p num="40">
      The process of the present invention has the further unexpected benefit of not requiring removal of the deactivated catalyst from the polymer.
      <br/>
      This is particularly surprising in light of U.S. Defensive Publication T873,016 in which acid phosphates (acidic esters of phosphoric acid) and acid phosphites (acidic esters of phosphorous acid) are listed as two of several types of acids which react with alkali metal catalyst residue to form salt impurities in poly(2,2,4,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclobutylene carbonate).
      <br/>
      The Defensive Publication teaches that the salts formed are colored impurities which must be removed from the polycarbonate in order to provide a polycarbonate product having improved thermal stability and good color.
    </p>
    <p num="41">
      The applicants have found the retention of the catalysts deactivated by the particular phosphorus compounds of the present process has no deleterious effect on polymer color.
      <br/>
      It has also been found that the improvement in polymer thermal stability is surprisingly good when the deactivated catalyst is retained in the polymer matrix.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the use of the particular phosphorus compounds of the present invention as deactivators provides a much faster, yet unexpectedly effective, deactivation process.
    </p>
    <p num="42">In light of the literature disclosing other methods of deactivating alkali metal catalysts in polycarbonates as being acid/base neutralizations, it was particularly surprising to find that the present process is very effective when the phosphorus compound is a non-acidic derivative of phosphorous acid.</p>
    <p num="43">
      An additional unexpected benefit of the present process is that it can be conducted under molten conditions.
      <br/>
      This allows for very convenient deactivation immediately after melt polymerization.
      <br/>
      This is surprising in view of U.S. Defensive Publication T873,016 which teaches against deactivation of alkali metal catalysts under molten conditions due to the formation of colored decomposition impurities.
    </p>
    <p num="44">
      The process of the present invention comprises treating a polycarbonate containing active alkali metal catalyst residues with an effective amount of a phosphorus-containing deactivator to form a deactivated polycarbonate.
      <br/>
      The term "active" is used herein to describe a catalyst residue which is capable of promoting further polymerization.
      <br/>
      A "deactivated" catalyst will not promote polymerization.
    </p>
    <p num="45">
      In one embodiment, poly(2,2,4,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclobutylene carbonate) is treated with the present deactivation process after the polymerization process has proceeded to the desired molecular weight.
      <br/>
      Since the alkali metal catalyst is completely deactivated by the present process, no further buildup of molecular weight will occur under high vacuum, as occurs in many of the known deactivation methods.
    </p>
    <p num="46">
      This process is effective in deactivating ionized basic metal residues of alkali metal condensation catalysts known in the polycarbonate art.
      <br/>
      Suitable alkali metal catalysts include, but are not limited to, oxides, hydrides and hydroxides of alkali metals, free alkali metals, butyl lithium, phenyl lithium, sodium aluminate, and alkali metal alkoxides such as sodium methoxide.
      <br/>
      The present process is preferably used to deactivate sodium methoxide, lithium methoxide, sodium metal, and lithium metal.
    </p>
    <p num="47">
      The present process is useful in deactivating alkali metal residues contained in poly(2,2,4,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclobutylene carbonate).
      <br/>
      The polycarbonate can be made by melt polymerization or solid-state polymerization methods where alkali metal catalysts are employed. U.S. Pat. No. 3,313,777 discloses poly(2,2,4,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclobutylene carbonate) prepared by condensation of 2,2,4,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclobutanediol and carbonic acid in the presence of alkali metal catalysts.
    </p>
    <p num="48">Applicants' provisional application (serial no. 60/034,992) incorporated herein in its entirety, discloses the preparation of poly(2,2,4,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclobutylene carbonate) by the self-condensation melt polymerization reaction of carbonic acid 3-methoxycarbonyloxy-2,2,4,4-tetramethyl-cyclobutyl ester methyl ester (the bis(methyl carbonate) of 2,2,4,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclobutanediol) in the presence of a catalyst selected from the group consisting of alkali metals, alkoxides of alkali metals, carboxylates of alkali metals, and mixtures thereof under polycondensation conditions of temperature and pressure.</p>
    <p num="49">
      Applicants' provisional application (serial no. 60/034,164) incorporated herein in its entirety, discloses a two-staged process for making poly(2,2,4,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclobutylene carbonate).
      <br/>
      The first polymerization stage comprises heating a mixture containing the diol, dimethyl carbonate, and an effective amount of a basic catalyst for a time sufficient to react a sufficient number of hydroxyl groups (at least about 75%), thereby forming an intermediate including methyl carbonate-terminated oligomers.
      <br/>
      The second stage includes reacting the intermediate under polycondensation conditions of pressure and temperature no greater than 300 (degree)  C. for a time sufficient to form polycarbonate.
    </p>
    <p num="50">The catalyst deactivators useful in the present process are phosphorus-containing acids and esters including phosphorous acid and the compounds represented by the following formulas:  (Chemical Structure image '7' not included in text)</p>
    <p num="51">wherein, R1 -R7 and R9 are, independently, hydrogen; aliphatic hydrocarbon of from 1 to 20 carbon atoms; substituted aromatic hydrocarbon of from 6 to 20 carbon atoms; or unsubstituted aromatic hydrocarbon of from 6 to 20 carbon atoms; R8 and R10 -R13 are, independently, substituted or unsubstituted aromatic hydrocarbon of from 6 to 20 carbon atoms; or aliphatic hydrocarbon of from 1 to 20 carbon atoms; A is a tetrafunctional hydrocarbon group; and x is an integer of from 1 to 3.</p>
    <p num="52">
      Suitable deactivators for use in the present process must be nonvolatile for reaction efficiency.
      <br/>
      Deactivators are considered nonvolatile for present purposes if they have vapor pressures low enough that they do not vaporize from the polymerization mixture under present processing conditions by distillation, sublimation, and the like.
      <br/>
      Volatile deactivators reverse the deactivation reaction by vaporization.
    </p>
    <p num="53">
      Suitable deactivators for use in the present process must also be stable under the conditions of the present process.
      <br/>
      The deactivator used should be stable enough so that it is not removed from the mixture by decomposition.
      <br/>
      Decomposition of the deactivator during the high temperature deactivation step could also lead to unwanted addition of color to the product.
    </p>
    <p num="54">
      In one embodiment, the deactivator is acidic.
      <br/>
      Examples of suitable catalyst deactivators represented by the formulas above include, but are not limited to, distearyl pentaerythritol diphosphite, trilauryl phosphite, di(isooctyl)phosphite, diphenyl phosphite, diphenyl phosphate, phosphorous acid, phosphoric acid, and phenyl phosphonic acid.
      <br/>
      Diphenyl phosphate is a preferred acidic deactivator.
    </p>

      In one embodiment, deactivator is a trialiphatic triester of phosphorous acid or an aromatic ester of phosphorous acid.
      <br/>
      In another embodiment, the trialiphatic ester is a compound having the formula (Ia), (Ib), or (Ic), wherein, R1 -R6 are, independently, an aliphatic hydrocarbon of from 1 to 20 carbon atoms.
      <br/>
      The preferred non-acidic deactivators are aliphatic triesters of phosphorous acid (triphosphites) represented by formulas (Ia), (Ib), and (Ic), more preferably trilauryl phosphite.

      In the process of the present invention, the active polycarbonate is treated with an effective amount of deactivator.
      <br/>
      An "effective amount" is herein defined as an amount sufficient to deactivate all basic alkali metal catalyst residues so that they no longer catalyze polymer formation or polymer buildup reactions.
    </p>
    <p num="57">
      The concentrations of deactivator used in the process of the present invention are expressed herein as equivalent percents, wherein the addition of 100 equivalent percent deactivator is the theoretical amount of deactivator to neutralize the amount of basic catalyst added to the polymerization reaction mixture.
      <br/>
      The concentration of active basic catalyst is necessarily theoretical due to the fact that some of the basic catalyst added to the polymerization mixture may be in a reacted form or as an unionized free metal and, therefore, unavailable for reaction with the deactivator.
    </p>
    <p num="58">
      For acidic deactivators, the equivalent percent is based upon the number of protic hydrogens contained therein.
      <br/>
      The amount of acidic deactivator added to the polymer may be varied within wide limits.
      <br/>
      For those deactivators which contain acidic protons, as little as about 75 equivalent percent, to as much as about 1,000 equivalent percent is an effective amount.
      <br/>
      However, more than about 500 equivalent percent of the theoretical amount required for catalyst neutralization should generally be avoided, not only for economic reasons, but because larger amounts may affect polymer properties.
      <br/>
      A preferable concentration of carboxylic acid to deactivate the polycarbonate is about 75 to 500 equivalent percent, preferably about 75 to 200 equivalent percent, more preferably about 75 to 175 equivalent percent, even more preferably about 100 to 125 equivalent percent.
    </p>
    <p num="59">
      For non-acidic ester deactivators (having no protic hydrogens) the required concentration of deactivator is based on the atoms of phosphorus which are contained in one mole of the deactivator.
      <br/>
      The concentration of non-acidic deactivators is represented hereinafter as a ratio of the number of phosphorus atoms per basic alkali metal atom (P/M), based on the theoretical concentration of active alkali metal atoms.
      <br/>
      The amount of non-acidic deactivator may be varied within wide limits, depending on the composition of the deactivator.
      <br/>
      A non-acidic deactivator concentration providing about 1 P/M to 10 P/M has been found useful.

      2) Degradation Rate Constant (DRC) determinations were made by melt thermal stability testing using a Dynamic Analyzer RDAII mechanical spectrometer rheometer manufactured by Rheometrics, Inc. (Piscataway, N.J.), using 25 mm flat parallel plate fixtures, nitrogen purge gas, 10% strain, 1 radian/.sctn. oscillation frequency, 1 mm sample gap (sample thickness), 275 (degree)  C. melt temperature.

    <p num="81">
      To test thermal stability, sample polymer pellets were dried overnight under full vacuum at 120 (degree)  C. The rheometer was preheated to 275 (degree)  C. test temperature.

      The "zero gap" between the parallel plates was set, and pellets loaded directly onto the lower plate and allowed to melt.

      <br/>
      Into the flask were placed 130.00 grams (0.50 mole) of bis(methyl carbonate) derivative of 2,2,4,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclobutanediol (approximately 49 percent trans), and 0.0126 grams (approximately 50 ppm Na based on a theoretical polymer yield of 119 grams) of sodium formate.

      The polymer was colorless and has a very low melt viscosity.

      The high melt viscosity polymer was treated with the deactivation process of Example 2 except that 0.0288 grams (125 equivalent percent) of 85% aqueous H3 PO4 was used as the deactivator.
      <br/>
      The "No Catalyst Deactivator," "Catalyst Deactivator Added" and "Catalyst Deactivator Added+Vacuum" samples were slightly yellow tinted and had IV's of 0.88, 0.84, and 0.82 dL/g, respectively, which shows that deactivation was complete.

    <p num="111">
      The DRC's were 435.8 * 10-5, 470.3 * 10-5, and 424.5 * 10-5, respectively.
      <br/>
      The results of thermogravimetric analyses (TGA) in N2 which showed that the temperature at which 10% weight loss had occurred were, respectively, 352 (degree)  C., 354 (degree)  C., and 354 (degree)  C. This illustrates the poor thermal stabilities of all three samples and that deactivation of the basic catalyst residues does not thermally stabilize poly(1,4-cyclohexanedimethylene carbonate).

    <p num="112">Example 3</p>
    <p num="113">
      This Example illustrates the use of a phosphorus compound containing acidic protons, 85% aqueous H3 PO4, as the catalyst deactivator at 125 equivalent percent of the basic catalyst residues in the process of the present invention using poly(2,2,4,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclobutylene carbonate) prepared from the glycol and dimethyl carbonate as in Example 2.
