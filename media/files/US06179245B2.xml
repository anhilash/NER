      A flange design for spools and reels may be provided from molded materials such as plastics.
      <br/>
      Improved strength, stiffness, fracture resistance, energy absorption, and toughness may be provided by appropriate design of corrugations extending substantially radially from a hub or core portion toward a rim portion.
      <br/>
      Spools and reels may be produced from Styrene plastics, olefinics such as polyethylene and polyprophelene, and may have tubes formed from the same or different materials.
      <br/>
      Flanges may be designed to crush near a rim or to be stiff near a rim.
      <br/>
      Likewise, portions of a flange may be designed to buckle, fracture, or otherwise fail sufficiently to absorb energy, while protecting a spool from excessive fracture or distortion.
      <br/>
      Likewise, portions of the flange may be designed to fail while others nearby do not, in order to protect against catastrophic failure (e.g. extensive separation).
      <br/>
      Thus, whether a tube is integrally formed with a flange or attached to a flange by fasteners or bonding, the impact load typically tested by drop testing a loaded flange (wire-wrapped flange) may be survived by designing wall thicknesses, corrugation dimensions, and angles to selectively balance distortion, fracture, toughness, and stiffness of various portions of a spool or reel.

    <heading>BACKGROUND</heading>
    <p num="2">
      1.
      <br/>
      The Field of the Invention
    </p>
    <p num="3">This invention relates to spools and reels for receiving stranded materials, and, more particularly, to novel systems and methods for producing plastic flanges for reels and spools as take-up of electrical wire during manufacture.</p>
    <p num="4">2. The Background Art</p>
    <p num="5">
      Spools and reels are used in many industries.
      <br/>
      However, in the wire and cable industry, the comparative weight of stranded material on a reel or spoon is greater than others of similar size in other industries.
      <br/>
      Fracture of flanges near an outer diameter thereof is common if dropped.
      <br/>
      Likewise, due to certain conventional shapes, central tubes (hubs, cores, etc.) and their junctions with flanges are not inherently resistant to fracture from impact loads caused by dropping.
      <br/>
      Dropping from a working bench is common for reels and spools.
      <br/>
      Manufacturing processes for manufacturing reels and spools, as well as manufacturing processes for wire and other stranded materials, typically compels smooth circumferential edges at the outermost diameter of a flange.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, a spool not retained on an arbor during use (using the wire, rather than manufacturing and taking up the wire) may roll easily across any flat surface.
      <br/>
      Thus, while a spool or reel is considered tare weight in shipping wire and cable, and a disposable item whose cost is to be minimized, it must function reliably and durably during its entire useful life.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      Otherwise, a substantial length of stranded material may be damaged beyond use the material held on a spool or reel having a value of a few dollars may itself have a value of one thousand times the cost of a spool.
      <br/>
      A value two orders of magnitude greater than that of the spool is routine for wire of common usage.
    </p>
    <p num="7">3. State of the Art</p>
    <p num="8">
      Stranded materials, upon manufacture, are typically taken up directly onto a reel or spool.
      <br/>
      The take-up spool or reel receives the strand directly from the last step in the manufacturing process.
      <br/>
      Thereafter, the filled spool is effective for storage and handling purposes.
      <br/>
      Upon sale or distribution, the spool is often placed on an arbor, either alone or with other spools, for convenient dispensing of the linear or stranded material.
      <br/>
      Linear or stranded materials include electrical wire whether in single or multiple strands and cable (comprised of multiple wires), rope, wire rope, hose, tubing, chain and plastic and rubber profile material (generally any polymeric or elastomeric extruded flexible material).
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      In general, a host of elongate materials as diverse as pharmaceutical unit dose packages, fiberoptic line and log chains are stored on spools.
      <br/>
      Likewise, ribbon, thread and other stranded materials are wrapped on spools.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      The requirement for a spool in the manufacture and handling of wire is substantially different than spools in the textile industry.
      <br/>
      For example, the weight of wire is several times the weight of thread or rope.
      <br/>
      The bulk of wire, which translates to the inverse of density, is substantially lower for wire than for hose, tubing or even chain.
    </p>
    <p num="11">
      Meanwhile, most spools are typically launched on a one way trip.
      <br/>
      The collection and recycling of spools is hardly worth the effort, considering that their materials are not easily recyclable.
    </p>
    <p num="12">
      In the art, a typical spool has a tube portion extending between two flange portions positioned at either end of the tube portion.
      <br/>
      A spool may have a rounded rim or rolled edge at the outermost diameter.
      <br/>
      This rim serves structural as well as aesthetic and safety purposes.
      <br/>
      Spools may be manufactured in a variety of tube lengths.
      <br/>
      Each flange is fitted by some fixturing to one end of the tube and there retained.
      <br/>
      Details of spools are contained in the U.S. Pat. No. 5,464,171 directed to a mating spool assembly for relieving stress concentrations, incorporated herein by reference.
    </p>
    <p num="13">
      The impact load of a spool of wire dropping from a bench or other work surface to a floor in a manufacturing environment is sufficient to fracture the spool in any of several places.
      <br/>
      Fracture may damage wire, preclude removal, or release the wire in a tangled, useless mass.
    </p>
    <p num="14">
      Spools may break at the corner where the tube portion meets the flange portion or may fracture at an engagement portion along the tube portion.
      <br/>
      Spools may break near the corner between the flange and the tube portion where a joint bonds or otherwise connects the tube portion to the flange portion.
    </p>
    <p num="15">
      Spools and reels experience significant breakage during drop tests when manufactured in styrene or styrene-based plastics such as ABS.
      <br/>
      Polyolefins are very tough materials.
      <br/>
      Tough means that a material can tolerate a relatively large amount of straining or stretching before rupture.
      <br/>
      By contrast, a material which is not tough will usually fracture rather than stretch extensively.
      <br/>
      As a result, when a reel of wire is dropped, the energy of impact breaks the spool.
    </p>
    <p num="16">
      Polyolefins, by contrast, may actually be drawn past yielding into their plastic elongation region on a stress-strain chart.
      <br/>
      Polyolefins thus elongate a substantial distance.
      <br/>
      The result is that olefinic plastics will absorb a tremendous amount of energy locally without rupture.
      <br/>
      Thus, the wire on a spool which has been dropped does not become a tangled mat of loops.
    </p>
    <p num="17">
      Given their toughness, olefinic parts will bend, strain, distort, but usually not break.
      <br/>
      Nevertheless, olefinic plastics are not typical in the art of wire spools.
      <br/>
      Polyolefin parts are not bonded into multi-piece spools.
      <br/>
      However. Lack of a solvent is one problem, lack of a durable adhesive is another.
      <br/>
      Therefore, any spool would have to be manufactured as unit of a specific size.
      <br/>
      The inventory management problem created by unique spools of various sizes is untenable, although the cost of some olefinic resins is lower than that of styrene-based resins.
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      Moreover, the cycle time of molds directly related to material properties is usually much faster for styrene-based resins.
      <br/>
      The designs available use wall thicknesses which result in warpage as well.
      <br/>
      All these factors and more combine to leave olefinic resins largely unused in the spool industry, as is the design of bonded parts for spools from olefinic resins.
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      In drop tests, a spool may be dropped axially, radially, or canted off-axis.
      <br/>
      In a radial drop, spools that break typically fail near the middle of the length of the tube, or tubes may shear at a flange.
      <br/>
      In axial drops, flanges may separate from tubes in failed spools.
      <br/>
      In an off-axis drop, flanges typically fracture, and may separate from tubes, releasing wire.
    </p>
    <p num="20">
      Large spools are typically called reels in the wire industry.
      <br/>
      Heavy-duty reels of 12 inches in diameter and greater (6 feet and 8 feet are common) are often made of wood or metal.
      <br/>
      Plastic spools of 12-inch diameter and greater are rare and tend to be very complex.
      <br/>
      The rationale is simple.
      <br/>
      Inexpensive plastics are not sufficiently strong or tough to tolerate even ordinary use with such a large mass of wire or cable wrapped around the spool.
    </p>
    <p num="21">
      Moreover, large flanges for reels are very difficult to manufacture.
      <br/>
      Likewise, the additional manufacturing cost of large spools is problematic.
      <br/>
      High speed molding requires quick removal after a short cycle time.
      <br/>
      Flanges are typically manufactured to have very thick walls.
      <br/>
      Increased thicknesses directly lengthen cycle times.
      <br/>
      Thus designs do not scale up.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the flanges have very slow cooling times and molding machines have low productivity in producing them.
    </p>
    <p num="22">
      Styrene plastic is degraded by recycling.
      <br/>
      That is, once styrene has been injection molded, the mechanical properties of the resulting plastic are degraded.
      <br/>
      Thus, if a spool is recycled, ground up into chunks or beads and re-extruded as part of another batch, the degradation in quality can be substantial.
      <br/>
      Olefinic plastics improve over styrene-based plastics in that olefinic plastics can be completely recyclable.
      <br/>
      The mechanical properties of an olefinic plastic are virtually identical for reground stock as for virgin stock.
    </p>
    <p num="23">
      In reels, a 12-inch diameter unit is instructive.
      <br/>
      Such a spool is usually manufactured of wood.
      <br/>
      Nevertheless, a plastic spool in 12-inch diameter may also be manufactured with a pair of plastic flanges holding a layered cardboard (paperboard) tube detained therebetween.
      <br/>
      The flanges are typically bolted together axially to hold the tube within or without a circumferential detent as with wooden reels.
    </p>
    <p num="24">
      The reels have an additional difficulty when they are dropped during use.
      <br/>
      The flanges do not stay secured.
      <br/>
      The flange and tube are often precarious wooden assemblies held together by three or more axial bolts compressing the flanges together.
      <br/>
      The tube is prone to slip with respect to the flanges, breaking, tilting or otherwise losing its integrity under excessive loads.
      <br/>
      Such loads result from the impact of dropping onto a floor from a bench height or less.
      <br/>
      For the largest reels, rolling over or into obstacles or from decks during handling is more likely to be the cause of damage.
    </p>
    <p num="25">
      Very large cables, having an outside diameter up to several inches is taken up during manufacturing on a very large reel, from two feet to eight feet in diameter.
      <br/>
      The current state of the art dictates wooden reels comprised of flanges capturing a barrel-like tube of longitudinal slats therebetween.
      <br/>
      The two flanges are held together by a plurality of long bolts extending therethrough.
    </p>
    <p num="26">
      Wooden reels are not typically recyclable.
      <br/>
      A splinter or blemish in a reel can damage insulation on new cable or wire wrapped therearound at the manufacturing plant.
      <br/>
      Damaged insulation destroys much of the value of a reel of cable or wire.
      <br/>
      That is, the wire must be spliced, or may have damage extending over several wrapped layers of wire.
      <br/>
      Splices segmenting the original length of wire wrapped on the reel add costs in labor, reliability, service and the like.
    </p>
    <p num="27">
      Wood cannot be recycled and reconstructed cost effectively.
      <br/>
      In addition, the plurality of bolts and nails must be removed with other related metal hardware.
      <br/>
      The reels do not effectively burn without the labor investment of this dismantling operation.
    </p>
    <p num="28">
      Also, a wooden reel that is slightly out of adjustment, damaged, or broken, is problematic.
      <br/>
      A broken reel leaves a large area splintered to damage wire insulation.
      <br/>
      A reel which is loose will tilt and twist as the slats shift with respect to the flanges.
    </p>
    <p num="29">
      Steel reels tend to be more frequently recyclable.
      <br/>
      However, each must be returned in its original form to be reused.
      <br/>
      Thus, the bulk of transfer is as large as the bulk of original shipment, although the weight is less.
      <br/>
      Also, steel is heavy, subject to damage by the environment such as by stains, rust, peeling of paint, denting, accumulation of coatings or creation of small burrs on surfaces and corners.
      <br/>
      For example, when a reel is rolled over a hard surface, sharp objects, grit or rocks tend to raise small burrs on the outer edge of the flange.
      <br/>
      Similarly, contact with any sharp or hard object can raise burrs on the inside surfaces of the flanges.
    </p>
    <p num="30">
      As with wooden reels, only to a greater extent, a burr on a steel reel tends to act like a knife, slicing through insulation and ruining wire.
      <br/>
      Perhaps the most difficult aspect of burrs is that they are hardly detectable at sizes which are nevertheless highly damaging to insulation.
      <br/>
      Of course the weight and cost of steel reels is another factor in the difficulty of employing them for delivery of cable.
    </p>
    <p num="31">
      What is needed is a design for large (12 inches greater diameters) and small diameter (typically 6 1/2-inch outside diameter) plastic spool flanges, which can tolerate the energy of being dropped when fully wrapped with wire.
      <br/>
      In addition, even in the standard styrene-based plastic spools, a better design is desired.
      <br/>
      What is needed in large reels of from a foot to eight feet approximately in outside flange diameter is a reel which is dimensionally stable, maintains structural integrity in service and during accidental dropping, which will not fracture or separate at a flange if it is dropped, and which is economically recyclable.
    </p>
    <p num="32">
      In a large reel, on the order of two to eight feet in diameter, what is needed is a lightweight, high-strength reel.
      <br/>
      The reel should not tend to damage wire when scratched, gouged, or otherwise having a burr raised on any key surface.
      <br/>
      Similarly, a large reel should be resilient enough that it does not maintain a permanent set, such as a steel reel will, when damaged.
      <br/>
      A plastic reel should be formed in a design that resists fracture and of a material which is tough.
      <br/>
      The material should be flexible enough that a burr will not damage insulation.
      <br/>
      A large reel should be recyclable.
      <br/>
      Recycling is most efficient if a reel can be reground near the site of use.
      <br/>
      Empty reels are more voluminous than they are heavy.
    </p>
    <p num="33">
      Moreover a design is needed that provides improved toughness by virtue of design, regardless of the toughness of the material.
      <br/>
      Catastrophic failure of reels and spools limits their applicability within the wire and cable industry.
      <br/>
      The risk of losing the use of the stranded material held thereon is not to be risked for the cost of using plastic spools and reels.
    </p>
    <heading>BRIEF SUMMARY AND OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="34">In view of the foregoing, it is a primary object of the present invention to provide spools and reels and a method of designing them that will optimize strength, stiffness, fracture, distortion, toughness, and so forth at various locations within the flanges for survival of drop tests.</p>
    <p num="35">It is an object of the invention to provide various flange designs that can absorb shock or impact loads without completely fracturing.</p>
    <p num="36">It is an object of the invention to provide a design of, and method for designing, flanges of spools and reels having controlled fracture and controlled distortion in order to optimize survival of flanges and the integrity of the flange-to-tube transitions in configurations of spools having minimum weight and highest produceability in molding outputs.</p>
    <p num="37">It is an object of the invention to provide selective distortion, stiffness, and fracture of a flange in order to protect the integrity of a core or hub region of the flange.</p>
    <p num="38">It is an object of the invention to provide an eccentric application of impact loads transmitted from a rim toward a core region of a flange connecting to a tube portion, whether the tube is initially formed integrally or separately from the flange.</p>
    <p num="39">It is an object of the invention to provide multiple regions within the web of a flange, with the regions adapted to provide differing material properties, including different sections, moments of inertia, stiffness, strength, toughness, fracture-resistance, fracture-susceptibility, and the like.</p>
    <p num="40">It is an object of the invention to provide increased stiffness and strength in the web of a from thinner walls, yet such that impact loads will not separate a rim and web from a core region of a flange, but maintain mechanical integrity of the flange especially in the tube transition region.</p>
    <p num="41">
      The invention solves this multiplicity of problems with flanges for plastic spools and reels formed in a multi-piece structure preferably by molding from olefinic ABS, styrenic, and other plastics.
      <br/>
      Some of the designs may be made tough, even when manufactured of styrene-based plastics.
      <br/>
      The designs are particularly well adapted to manufacture using molded polyethylene and polypropylene or similar olefinic plastics regardless of tube (core) retention methods.
    </p>
    <p num="42">
      The structures and methods of the invention apply to spools and reels of all sizes.
      <br/>
      Notwithstanding a structure that can be injection molded in a 61/2-inch flange diameter may have to be roto-molded (tumble-molded) in an eight foot size, the invention applies consistent with the foregoing objects, and in accordance with the invention as embodied and broadly described herein, an apparatus and method are disclosed, in suitable detail to enable one of ordinary skill in the art to make and use the invention.
    </p>
    <p num="43">
      In one presently preferred embodiment of an apparatus in accordance with the invention, a central tube or core section may be disposed between two flanges.
      <br/>
      Construction of the core and flange joints may be done in accordance with various approaches known in the art, as well as those articulated in U.S. Pat. No. 5,464,171, incorporated herein by reference.
    </p>
    <p num="44">
      Nevertheless, a tube may be completely hollow, ribbed or corrugated, itself.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, tubes may be arranged to fit within cavities formed in flanges, or to fit outside a sleeve protruding inwardly from a flange, or both at once.
      <br/>
      In certain embodiments, a flange and tube may be molded in a single piece with a mating tube and associated flange being molded in another piece.
      <br/>
      The two pieces may then be bonded together by a suitable means to provide a complete spool or reel.
    </p>
    <p num="45">
      Hybrid spools and reels may be formed using different materials for flanges than for tubes (cores).
      <br/>
      In other embodiments, a single material may be used for both flanges and tubes assembled from two or more parts.
      <br/>
      In one presently preferred embodiment, a cardboard tube may be adapted to fit over sleeves protruding from integrally formed flanges extending therefrom.
    </p>
    <p num="46">
      In one embodiment, flanges may be corrugated to provide a multiplicity of beneficial features.
      <br/>
      Thickness of walls, more complete closure of cavities (on all sides but one, for example), selective fracture resistance and fracture susceptibility, stiffness, strength, rigidity, a moment of inertia, a section, and so forth may be affected.
    </p>
    <p num="47">
      Corrugations may be arranged in a spoke-like configuration extending radially from a core or a hub portion of a flange.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, corrugations may extend radially at uniform or non-uniform circumferential angles.
      <br/>
      Corrugations may extend circumferentially between orthogonal surfaces thereto or surfaces non-orthogonal thereto in order to optimize weight, strength, stiffness, toughness, and other significant functionality.
    </p>
    <p num="48">
      Corrugations may terminate in selective angles with respect to tangents to the hub (core) portion, and at different selected angles with respect to tangents to a rim or outer circumference of a flange.
      <br/>
      Moreover, an angle of sweep measured between a tangent of a corrugation edge proximate a core and such an angle measured proximate a rim may differ by any suitable number of degrees.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, corrugations may be formed to direct loads in a web between a core or hub and a rim portion of a flange.
    </p>
    <p num="49">
      Alternatively, corrugations may be arranged to preclude direct transfer of loads normal to any tangents to a hub, rim, or both.
      <br/>
      Loads may include compression, tension, shear, bending, and so forth.
      <br/>
      Corrugation surfaces may be designed to provide a selected strength, stiffness, and toughness at any location within a flange.
      <br/>
      Corrugations may provide axial loading to retain stranded material, even after substantial damage to a flange.
      <br/>
      Moreover, the balance between strength, stiffness, and toughness may be designed specifically to be different at different locations within a flange.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, flanges may be designed specifically to address loading caused by different types of falls, a major source of damage in use.
    </p>
    <p num="50">
      Eccentric and tangential interception of corrugations by a hub of a flange may be designed to promote absorption of energy of an impact, by distortion, selective fracture, or by rigid survival.
      <br/>
      However, in certain embodiments, portions of a flange may be designed to fail to a selected extent in a selected region in order to protect other portions of the flange that would result in more costly damage if allowed to fracture.
    </p>
    <p num="51">
      Thus, for example, outer portions of a flange may be permitted to crush, bend, break, and so forth in order absorb certain loads.
      <br/>
      The rim having greater circumference, more material may be naturally provided for absorbing such damage.
      <br/>
      Meanwhile, a hub may be configured to minimize damage, since a hub may be substantially smaller than a rim (outer diameter or outermost portion) of a flange.
      <br/>
      In one presently preferred embodiment, bending loads may selectively fracture corrugation walls on one axial side, while transferring loads away to other areas.
      <br/>
      This re-distribution may reduce fractured circumference at the core, maintaining integrity while permitting fracturing of adequate length to absorb shock loads.
    </p>
    <p num="52">
      Even near a hub, geometries of flanges may promote selective fracture.
      <br/>
      For example, selected portions of corrugations may be designed to have thicknesses, angles, and loads calculated to cause a fracture of limited length and direction.
      <br/>
      Other nearby locations may be configured with geometries, materials, thicknesses, and so forth to virtually preclude fracture in a similar circumstance.
      <br/>
      Both features, one susceptible to ready fracture at a known location, and one resistant to expected fracture at a nearby location may provide selective fracture for absorption of energy without catastrophic failure.
      <br/>
      Catastrophic failure may be regarded as a failure that is likely to destroy the contents of a spool or reel, render it otherwise useless due to increased effort to retrieve, or create an impossibility or difficulty of supporting and retrieving stranded materials, and the like.
    </p>
    <p num="53">
      In other embodiments, circumferential corrugations may be used.
      <br/>
      Moreover, angled or curved corrugations may be used in combination with one another, or circumferential corrugations, or with surfaces of various configurations in order to optimize fracture toughness, strength, stiffness, etc.
      <br/>
      In one embodiment, a flange may be subdivided radially to provide portions having greater or lesser resistance to fracture or energy absorption.
      <br/>
      Corrugations may have axial depth.
      <br/>
      Axial depth may be constant or variable in a radial or circumferential direction.
      <br/>
      Nevertheless, molding considerations may provide or benefit from certain uniformities.
    </p>
    <p num="54">
      Inner surfaces of flanges, those surfaces in contact with the stranded materials stored thereon, may be smooth or corrugated.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, distances across adjacent corrugations may be uniform or non-uniform in a radial, circumferential, or axial direction.
      <br/>
      Moreover, a directorix may be defined for each corrugation, and even each surface extending in a more-or-less radial direction.
      <br/>
      Thus, adjacent surfaces or directrices defining surfaces extending radially but connected circumferentially by orthogonal or other surfaces, may have different angles, and may be angled, curved, both, or alternating.
    </p>
    <p num="55">
      As a practical matter, inner surfaces or interior surfaces of a spool may desirably be designed to extend circumferentially a greater portion of circumference of a flange at any given radius.
      <br/>
      Thus, the inner, clear span of a stranded material between axial support surfaces will be a relatively lesser fraction of the overall circumference at any radius.
      <br/>
      Nevertheless, multiple corrugations having sufficiently high frequency to provide short clear spans may obviate any necessity for non-uniformity in a circumferential expanse of any corrugation on an inner or outer surface of a flange.
      <br/>
      Likewise, surface liners, such as a paperboard, or re-ground plastics, any other inexpensive material may be installed during manufacture, or after manufacture, to separate wire or other stranded materials from touching an interior flange surface or from tending to escape axially into corrugations corresponding to exterior flange surfaces.

      <br/>
      Thus, the following more detailed description of the embodiments of the apparatus and methods of the present invention is not intended to limit the scope thereof.
      <br/>
      Rather, the scope of the invention is as broad as claimed herein.
      <br/>
      The illustrations merely represent certain, presently preferred embodiments of the invention.
      <br/>
      Embodiments of the invention will be best understood by reference to the drawings, wherein like parts are designated by like numerals throughout.
    </p>
    <p num="58">
      Those of ordinary skill in the art will, of course, appreciate that various modifications to the details of the apparatus and methods illustrated in the Figures may easily be made without departing from the essential characteristics of the invention.
      <br/>
      Thus, the following description of the Figures is by way of example, and not limitation, and simply illustrates certain presently preferred embodiments consistent with the invention as claimed.
    </p>
    <p num="59">
      Referring to FIG. 1, an apparatus 10 may be referred to as a spool 10 or reel 10. the apparatus 10 may include flanges 12, 1, 4, each being provided with a rim 16 and web 18.
      <br/>
      The web 18 may extend continuously or discontinuously in a radial, circumferential, axial, or all such, or any combination of such directions.
      <br/>
      The web 18 extends, whether continuously or periodically (e.g. perforated, spoked, etc.), between a region proximate a tube 20 and the rim 16 near an outermost circumference of a flange 12.
      <br/>
      In speaking of flanges 12, 14, in general, a single flange 12 may be referred to, and may be interpreted as including features that may be included in all flanges 12, 14, but need not be necessarily inputed thereto in all embodiments.
    </p>
    <p num="60">
      The web 18 extends between the rim 16 and a core 22 or hub 22 near the tube 20 and intended to engage the tube 22 in certain presently preferred embodiments.
      <br/>
      In other embodiments, the tube 20 may be formed in parts integrated with respected flanges 12, 14, and bonded or otherwise fastened to form the tube 20 as an integrated portion of a single-piece spool.
    </p>
    <p num="61">
      As a practical matter, a cap 23 may be positioned as part of the core 22 or applied thereto in order to seal, space, or otherwise serve the flange 12.
      <br/>
      For example, the cap 23 may be a portion of the external portion of the core 22.
      <br/>
      Meanwhile, an interior portion 24 of a core 22 may be tubular in nature, and may include multiple tubes or sleeves for capturing or otherwise engaging the tube 20 extending between the flanges 12,14.
    </p>
    <p num="62">
      The cap 23 may be provided in order to provide an aperture 26 for receiving a driver or dog from a machine on which the apparatus 10 may rotate.
      <br/>
      Other apertures 27, 28 may be used for other functions such as starting and tying, respectively, the stranded material (e.g. wire) wrapped about the tube 20 between the flanges 12,14.
    </p>
    <p num="63">
      Each flange 12,14 may be provided with corrugations 30.
      <br/>
      Corrugations 30 may be configured to have cavities 31 on opposite, alternating sides of each respective flange 12,14.
      <br/>
      The alternating nature of the cavity 31 and the surfaces 29 is somewhat arbitrary.
      <br/>
      That is, when viewing a flange 12,14 from one side, (e.g. axially speaking) the raised portion may be thought of as a surface 29 and the depressed portion may be thought of as a cavity 31, not withstanding each cavity 31 is defined by a surface 29.
    </p>
    <p num="64">
      An arbor aperture 32 may be sized to rotate freely and support the apparatus 10 on an arbor during delivery from, or wrapping of the contained, stranded material thereon.
      <br/>
      The arbor aperture 32 may have a surface 33 operating as an arbor bearing 33 for supporting the weight of the apparatus 10 while accommodating friction, wear, and other structural requirements.
    </p>
    <p num="65">
      A cavity 34 may be provided as part of the inside portion 24 of a core.
      <br/>
      Inside refers to the location seen from the same side of a flange 12, 14 as the stranded material would occupy.
      <br/>
      The cavity 34 may receive the tube 20.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, a cavity 34 may be corrugated, ribbed, or otherwise filled.
      <br/>
      In one embodiment, the cavity 34 may be irrelevant.
      <br/>
      In such an embodiment, a rim 20 may be designed to extend over an outermost diameter of the core 22, and more particularly an inside portion 24 of a core 22.
      <br/>
      As noted, the cavity 34 may simply be an extension of a tube 20 made in two parts, each part integrally formed with its respective flange 12, 14.
    </p>
    <p num="66">
      Referring to FIG. 2, and to FIGS. 1-16 generally, an apparatus 10 may include flanges 12,14 in which the web 18 extends in a variety of shapes between a rim 16 and a core 22.
      <br/>
      In general, the direction of a specific corrugation 30 may extend in any of the directions available.
      <br/>
      Corrugations 30 may be shaped to appear like spokes 38, although the specific functionality may be substantially different.
    </p>
    <p num="67">
      For example, viewing the flange portion 10 of an apparatus 10 in FIG. 2, the core portion 22 may be surrounded by the web 18 extending in a radial direction 44, having a thickness in an axial direction 46 at any location, and extending circumferentially 48 or in a circumferential direction 48.
      <br/>
      The directions radially 44, axially 46, and circumferentially 48 maybe defined with respect to a center 50 or axis 50 of the apparatus 10.
      <br/>
      The arbor aperture 32 may be defined by an arbor radius 52 formed within the cap 23 having a capped radius 54.
    </p>
    <p num="68">
      Each of the corrugations 30 may extend axially, radially, and circumferentially, as needed to connect the core 22 and the rim 16.
      <br/>
      The outermost flanged diameter 58 may be thought of as the effective outer diameter of the apparatus 10 and the flange 12.
      <br/>
      In one presently preferred embodiment, the thickness 57 of the rim 16 may be substantially, even orders of magnitude, less than the outermost diameter 58.
      <br/>
      Thus, the flange radius 59 about the center 50 is substantially the same on either side of the rim 16, in such a circumstance.
    </p>
    <p num="69">
      In certain embodiments, the rim 57 may not exist other than to be the edge of the flange 12.
      <br/>
      However, in keeping with structural mechanics factors, a rim 16 may extend axially away from a surface 29 of a web 18.
      <br/>
      In certain embodiments, the surface 29 may be flush with the rim 16, axially.
      <br/>
      In other embodiments, the rim 16 may extend axially away from the surface 29 beyond that amount needed to define the cavity 31 with respect thereto.
    </p>
    <p num="70">
      In certain selected embodiments, a flange 12 may be formed to have a core region 62 of the web 18 extending a portion of the flange radius 59 away from the core 22 (hub 22, cap 23, etc.).
      <br/>
      The remainder of the radius 59 may be covered by a rim region 64 of the flange 12 as illustrated by a generic flange portion 40.
      <br/>
      The rim region 64 of a web 18 is distinct from the rim 16.
      <br/>
      A rim 16 may typically extend orthogonally away from a surface 65 defining the web 18.
    </p>
    <p num="71">
      Thus, a core region 62 is that portion of a flange 12 and specifically of the web 18 of a flange 12 extending between a core 22 and some detectable or significant transition portion 60 or transition 60 of the web 18.
      <br/>
      Between the rim 16 and the transition 60 extends the rim portion of the web 18 of the flange 12.
      <br/>
      The transition 60 may be positioned anywhere desired for improving the structural integrity of a flange 12.
      <br/>
      Meanwhile, in general, a spool 10 or a reel 10 may be manufactured with or without any of the apertures 26, 27, 28, 32 as determined to be suitable for the apparatus 10.
    </p>
    <p num="72">
      The significance of the transition 60, which may be a mathematical circle or other geometry as well as a region having some radial dimension that is not insignificant, is for providing differing balances of strength, weight, stiffness, toughness, fracture-resistance, and fracture-susceptibility of the flange 12.
      <br/>
      Moreover, the direction of corrugations may change between the core region 62 and the rim region 64.
    </p>
    <p num="73">
      For example, a flange 12 may have corrugations 30 extending in a completely or substantially radial direction.
      <br/>
      A flange 12 may have corrugations 30 forming the web 18 and extending exclusively in a circumferential direction.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, the flange 12 may have corrugations 30 having a circumferentially curving aspect extending between the core 22 and the rim 16 continuously or discontinuously.
      <br/>
      In one embodiment, both curved and straight corrugations may exist in a single flange.
      <br/>
      In certain embodiments, certain types of corrugations 30 may be disposed in the core region 62 of the flange 12 as compared with corrugations 30 in the rim portion 64 of the flange 12.
    </p>
    <p num="74">
      Moreover, the rim portion 64 may be designed to promote or resist crushing, fracture, resilience, etc.
      <br/>
      The core region 64 may be designed to resist or promote deflection, distortion, crushing, fracture, or the like.
      <br/>
      However, in one presently preferred embodiment, the core 22 must not be completely separable from the core region 62 ofthe flange 12.
      <br/>
      Thus, the material characteristics of the rim region 64 and the core region 62 of the flange 12 may be designed to absorb shock, fracture, distortion, energy, and so forth without improper failures.
      <br/>
      Catastrophic failure (e.g. spool rendered unusable, complete separation, or contents useless, etc.) of an apparatus 10 is to be avoided.
    </p>
    <p num="75">
      Nevertheless, spools 10 and reels 10 are dropped periodically.
      <br/>
      Such drops should be accommodated by a selected design for a flange 12.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, the generic flange portion 40 illustrates the transition 60 in a dashed circle indicating that it may or may not exist and it may be moved radially inward or outward.

      Similarly, the rim 16 is delimited by the outermost diameter 58 and a dashed circle interior thereto indicating that the construction, thickness, and even existence of a rim 16 are design parameters that may be traded off against other considerations.

    <p num="76">Thus, in general, a spool 10 or reel 10 may have a flange portion 40 of a flange 12 designed to optimize the performance of the apparatus 10 by a combination of structural stiffness, toughness, strength, weakness, distortion, energy absorption, selective fracture, and so forth.</p>
    <p num="77">
      Referring to FIG. 3, an apparatus 10 may have corrugations 66, 67, 68, 69 extending in a circumferential direction 48.
      <br/>
      A web 18 of a flange 12 may have numerous corrugations 30.
      <br/>
      The corrugations 30 may be disposed to have alternating surfaces 29 and cavities 31.
      <br/>
      The extent in a radial direction 44 of any cavity 31 or surface 29 may be selected by a designer.
      <br/>
      Nevertheless, circumferential corrugations 66-69 may reduce the probability of transmitting a shock load directly from the rim 16 to the core 22, and may bend more easily from the core 22.
    </p>
    <p num="78">
      Substantial fracture of the core 22 causing separation from the core 22 from the web 18 over a more than about a third of the circumference of a core, will typically be regarded as a catastrophic failure.
      <br/>
      A fracture extent of half or more often releases the wire thereon.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, some mechanism for absorbing shock loads applied to a rim 16 by a drop of a spool 10 or a reel 10 resulting in an impact of a rim 16, may profitably be accommodated by eliminating or reducing the probability of catastrophic failure between the core 22 and the web 18 from shear, bending, or the like.
    </p>
    <p num="79">
      The rim 16 has a substantially larger aspect (size, radius, etc.) than does the core 22.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, less material is typically available to support a force transmitted between the web 18 and the core 22 than is available to absorb a radial or a bending shock at the rim 16.
      <br/>
      Moreover, the bending moment of an axial component of load at a rim 16 is substantially greater at the core 22 than at the rim 16.
    </p>
    <p num="80">
      Several factors may be accommodated in a design.
      <br/>
      However, stress levels may be far higher at any interface between the core 22 and the web 18, for a flange 12 having a constant thickness everywhere, as is good design practice for certain methods of plastics manufacture.

    <p num="81">
      Referring to FIG. 4, and still referring generally to FIGS. 1-16, corrugations 30 or a particular surface 19, 29, 31 extending substantially, radially, or to some extent radially to a substantial amount of its traverse or extent, may be defined or described by a directorix 70.
      <br/>
      Thus, a directorix 70a, 70b, 70c, 70d, 70e, 70f, 70g, 70h, may be regarded as a defining curvature for a selected wall 19 or connector 19 portion of a corrugation 30.
      <br/>
      One may think of a connector 19 or a wall 19 as that portion of a corrugation 30 extending from a surface 29 to the bottom of a cavity 31.
      <br/>
      Thus, a corrugation may extend principally in a radial direction 44, a circumferential direction 48, or both, while a connector 19 or a wall 19 will extend principally in an axial direction 46, and radial direction 44 to connect adjacent corrugations 30.
    </p>
    <p num="82">
      Each directorix 70 may have several features.
      <br/>
      Controls 72, 74, 75, 76 illustrate certain controlling features for defining the shape of a directorix 70 and its traverse between a core 22 and a rim 16.
      <br/>
      The traverse of a directorix 70 may be defined in terms of a core angle 80, a sweep angle 74, and a rim angle 76.
      <br/>
      The core angle 72 may be defined with respect to a directorix 70 and a tangent 78 to the core 22.
      <br/>
      A rim angle 84 may be defined with respect to a tangent 78 and a directorix 70.
      <br/>
      A sweep angle 82 may be defined in terms of a difference between a tangent 85a to a directorix 70 at a core contact point 81 and a tangent 85b to the same directorix 70 at a rim contact point 83.
    </p>
    <p num="83">
      Alternatively, a sweep angle 82 may be defined as a difference between a circumferential position of a core contact point 81 and a rim contact point 83 associated with a single directorix 70 of a corrugation 30 traversing between a core 22 and a rim 16 along a web 18.
      <br/>
      The latter definition may provide insights into how much of a web 18 has been traversed by a directorix 70 (e.g. by a wall 19 of a corrugation 18 defined by a directorix 70) in a circumferential direction.
      <br/>
      Adjacent walls 19 connected by a particular corrugation 30 may have different shapes, and thus more than one directorix 70 to define them.
    </p>
    <p num="84">
      In FIG. 4, the former definition of a sweep angle is used as illustrated in control 75.
      <br/>
      The latter definition of sweep angle 82 is used in the control 74.
      <br/>
      Each of the flanges in the controls A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J uses the former definition for sweep angle 82.
    </p>
    <p num="85">
      In general, a directorix 70 may be straight or curved.
      <br/>
      A directorix 70 may or may not include an inflection point 89 as illustrated in the directorix 70e of control E in FIG. 4.
      <br/>
      In certain embodiments, normals 79a with respect to a tangent 78 to the core 22, and normals 79b with respect to the rim tangent 86 may be used to define sweeps 82 and other geometric features of any directorix 70 of a flange 12.
    </p>
    <p num="86">
      In general, a directorix 70, and thus the corresponding wall 90 contacting a core 22 or rim 16 at a core angle 80 or rim angle 84, respectively, will affect the stress and stress concentration at the core contact point 81 or rim contact point 83, respectively.
      <br/>
      One may note that a directorix 70 approaching a core 22 fully tangent thereto may promote stress concentrations at an interior region 77a, while reducing them at an exterior region 77b with respect to the core 22 and directorix 70 (see control B, control C, and controls 72, 76).
    </p>
    <p num="87">The point of designing and controlling a core angle 80, sweep angle 82, and rim angle 84 is to control structural design elements that may thereby control the localization of distortion, stress, fracture, toughness, and so forth in a flange 12, and particularly at those locations where the web 18 of a flange 12 contacts a core 22 or a rim 16.</p>
    <p num="88">
      One may think of a stress concentration, such as that which may arise in a region 77a, as an invitation to structural failure locally.
      <br/>
      One may think of a smooth transition such as may occur in a region 77b as promoting structural integrity by removing the directionality of forces that may tend to rupture the integrity of a flange between a directorix 70 (actually the wall 19 defined by the directorix 70) and the core 22.
    </p>
    <p num="89">
      Accordingly, a directorix 70 may be designed to promote failure in an interior region 77a or a corrugation wall breaking away from a core 20.
      <br/>
      Meanwhile, the same directorix 70 may promote structural integrity with the core 22 at an exterior region 77b or on an axially oppositely disposed corrugation wall.
      <br/>
      Thus, during impact, a corrugation 30 and a directorix 70, meaning a wall 19 defined thereby, may selectively fracture and separate at distinct locations with respect to a core 22, while others remain integral.
    </p>
    <p num="90">
      In FIGS. 1-16 several, substantially orthogonal surfaces result from the use of corrugations 30 in flanges 12.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, orthogonal surfaces may flex with respect to one another if not stiffened by a third mutually orthogonal surface.
      <br/>
      A separation of two surfaces may affect orthogonal surfaces until flexure becomes available to a last connected surface.
      <br/>
      A combination of a portion of a core 22 maintaining its structural integrity with respect to a wall 19 (e.g. directorix 70) may maintain a structural contact between each surface 29, associated connecting wall 19, core 22, the cap 23, and any combination thereof At the same time, the same corrugation 30 may selectively fracture with respect to the core 22 at a somewhat different location.
      <br/>
      Typically a wall-thickness away or more from the integral portion, to absorb the energy of impact.
      <br/>
      Nevertheless, the integral portion and transferring loads away then maintains sufficient structural integrity of the web 18 and of the entire flange 12 to prevent loss of the contained, stranded material held by the apparatus 10.
    </p>
    <p num="91">
      One may note that a directorix 70, such as a directorix 70a that is normal to the core tangent 78 and the rim tangent 86 will typically transfer impact loads directly to the cores 22 from the rim 16 in a direction 44.
      <br/>
      By contrast, a directorix 70, such as a directorix 70b may still deliver impact loads from a rim 16 to a core 22, radially eccentrically, or in bending with additional torsion outside of an axial-radial plane.
      <br/>
      Likewise, a directorix 70, such as a directorix 70c, 70d, 70e, 70f, 70g may not present a straight-line path in a radial direction between a rim 16 and a core 22.
    </p>
    <p num="92">
      Web 18 may transfer loads through the wall 29, 31 (exterior or interior surfaces 29, 31 of corrugations 30).
      <br/>
      Stiffening may not be readily available from the connector 19 (wall 19, of a directorix 70) to transmit loads.
      <br/>
      Nevertheless, the connector 19 may be available to provide stiffness against excessive column buckling, shell buckling or distortion, and the like in a radial direction.
      <br/>
      Bending may be resisted more by radially direct walls 19.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, the core angle 80, sweep angle 82, rim angle 84, number of corrugations 30, thicknesses thereof, and the like, may be designed to promote a selected amount of local distortion, fracture, integrity, toughness, and stiffness, and so forth within the web 18 and flange 12 generally.
    </p>
    <p num="93">
      Perforations within the web 18 may be used selectively to promote increased or reduced stress.
      <br/>
      For example, perforations may be provided at an interior region 77a to promote fracture while continuous material may provide the web 18 in a wall 29 of a corrugation 30 in the region 77b exterior to a core contact point 81.
      <br/>
      In one presently preferred embodiment, a bending load may fracture a corrugation 30, but each corrugation is circumferentially discontinuous at any axial position.
      <br/>
      Thus, a corrugation may part radially and axially from a core 22 along a circumferential crack at or near the core 22.
    </p>
    <p num="94">
      A corrugation 30 axially opposite an adjacent fractured one, will not then experience a bending load effective to separate it from the core at the same circumferential location.
      <br/>
      Core angles 80 and circumferential discontinuity of corrugations tend to control the direction of cracks, precluding extensive propagation circumferentially.
      <br/>
      Thus, a continuous crack will not propagate around the core 22 circumferentially 48.
      <br/>
      The core 22 remains attached to the web 18.
      <br/>
      Moreover, the corrugations provide structural strength and stiffness in three dimensions, preventing failure of the flange 12 in service.
    </p>
    <p num="95">
      Referring to FIG. 5, an elevated surface 90 and a flush surface 92 or recessed surface 92 may be thought of as the surfaces themselves, or the entire walls in such locations.
      <br/>
      One may note that the flush wall 92 or the recessed wall 92, when viewed axially from outside a flange 12 provides a contact surface 92 for supporting stranded material to be wound on a tube 20.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, one may design the corrugations 30 such that any pair of adjacent connector walls 19 within a single corrugation 30 are spaced to promote greater circumferential distance 48 (see FIGS. 2-3) than that for an elevated or exterior wall 90.
    </p>
    <p num="96">
      Thus, the clear span 93 of wire crossing a corrugation 30 associated with an exterior wall 90 may be minimized.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, a cover 120, such as a paper board, or inexpensive material not integral with a flange 12 (see FIG. 7), may be provided to reduce bulging or pulling of stranded materials axially 46 into a cavity 31, interior to a particular corrugation 30.
    </p>
    <p num="97">
      A length 94 of a tube 20 may selected in accordance with a thickness 96 required to support the stranded material on a tube 20.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, each end 90 of the tube 20 may be fitted to a slot 100 designed to support the tube 20 of the associated length 94, when fully loaded with product (stranded material), in a drop test or in an accident during operation.
      <br/>
      The core wall 102 may be designed to bond or fasten to the tube 20 in a manner calculated to maintain sufficient integrity between the tube 20 and the flange 12, 14 during a drop, thereafter.
    </p>
    <p num="98">
      In order to provide minimum weight, minimum wall thicknesses, and the like for each flange 12, 14, a core sleeve 104 may be designed to support the ends 98 of the tube 20.
      <br/>
      For example, less material is available to take the force of impact at the core 22.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, additional support about the slot 100 may be provided by a core sleeve 104 extending inside a tube 20, as well as the core wall 102 extending over the outside surface of the end 98.

    <p num="99">
      A bearing surface 106 may be formed to extend axially away from the cap 23 of a core 22.
      <br/>
      Thus, less material may be used and wall thicknesses may be maintained at a constant value while providing additional bearing surface 106 to reduce friction and maintain integrity ofthe cap 23.
      <br/>
      In large reels, typically greater than one foot in diameter 58, and often several feet in diameter, the bearing surface 106 or bearing wall 106 (e.g. bearing 33) may be a critical design feature for suitable life of an apparatus 10.

      As a practical matter, struts 108 may be provided inside a core 22.

      In one embodiment, corrugations 30 may extend to the arbor aperture 32.
      <br/>
      For example, the sleeve 104 may exist and extend axially away from the web 18 to receive the tube 20.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, struts 108 may be sized to permit the core 22 to receive the tube 20 therein.
      <br/>
      Nevertheless, in one presently preferred embodiment, large reels 10 may have a slot 100 formed between a core wall 102 and a core sleeve 104.

      Referring to FIG. 6, and continuing to refer to the remaining FIGS. 1-16, a flange 12 of a spool or reel 10 may be provided with an inside face 110 (e.g. see also surface, faces, walls, etc. including walls 90, 92, and 29, 31).
      <br/>
      In the embodiment of FIG. 6, the inside face of a wall 111 of a corrugation 30 may be opposed to an outside face 112 thereof.
      <br/>
      Thus, an inside face 110 may be any face that is exposed to the interior of a spool 10 or a flange 10 while an exterior face 110 may be any surface exposed to an environment external to the portion of the spool 10 or reel 10 supporting or containing the stranded material.
      <br/>
      Thus, a cavity 31a may have an exterior surface 112 corresponding to the cavity surface 31 of FIG. 1.
    </p>
    <p num="102">
      Meanwhile, the same corrugation 30a may have an interior surface 110 corresponding to an elevated surface 90 or outer wall 29, depending on one's perspective.

      Thus, one may speak of a wall 111 of a corrugation 30 sharing or connecting to an adjacent wall 111 of an adjacent corrugation 30 by a connector 19 or connecting wall 19.
      <br/>
      Thus, for example, a wall 111a of a corrugation 30a forming a cavity 31a may share a connecting wall 19ab with a wall 111b of a corrugation 30b.
      <br/>
      Similarly, the wall 111a may share a connecting wall 19ac with a wall 111c of a corrugation 30c.
    </p>
    <p num="103">
      One may note that the region 77a of FIG. 7 may form a sharp angle and a stress concentration between the connecting wall 19ac and the core wall 102 of the core 22.

      Meanwhile, the region 77b is completely smooth or may be so designed for the connecting wall 19ab of the same corrugation 30a.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, for a radial load in tension, fracture may be anticipated in an area 77a before fracture in an area 77b.
      <br/>
      However, in bending, the web 18 may fracture along a line between 77a and 77b at maximum stress, but not usually at the same radial location on an adjacent corrugation 30b, 30c of opposite sense (inside/outside), which is acting as a fulcrum for the fracturing process.
      <br/>
      Connecting walls 19 may fracture partially or completely in an axial direction toward a fulcrum (e.g. regions between 77a and 77b for corrugations 30b, 30c.
    </p>
    <p num="104">
      One may also note however, that the cavity 31a also has various relationships with both the corrugation 30a and the corrugation 30b.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, the connecting wall 19ab within the cavity 31a may also have equivalent locations having the same geometry as the areas 77a and 77b for the corrugation 30a.
    </p>
    <p num="105">
      However, such interior 77a and exterior 77d connecting regions may have an opposite sense on opposite sides of the respective walls 19ac and 19ab, and with respect to the adjacent and corresponding corrugations 30c, 30b, respectively.
      <br/>
      Thus, upon impact, a fracture may occur in any corrugation 30, depending on whether bending is inward or outward axially, partially separating a wall 111a from a core 22, beginning at an area 77a and extending along the core 22 or the wall 102 of the core 22 toward the area 77b.

      However, the wall 19ab may tend to fracture away from the core 22 within the cavity 31a.

      The corrugation 30 opposite a fractrured one is acting as a fulcrum for fracture, yet maintaining its own integrity with the core 22 and particularly the core wall 102 in the area 77b.

      Thus, the cavity depth 95 and the wall thickness 118 may typically add up to the flange thickness 114.

      Nevertheless, the flange thickness 114 need not be constant in a radial direction 44.
      <br/>
      Similarly, a wall thickness 118 need not be uniform in a radial direction 44 or a circumferential direction 48 but may be adapted to absorb or sustain loads.
      <br/>
      Nevertheless, constant wall thickness at all locations tends to promote uniformity of stress and reliable manufacture at consistent molding times for plastics.
    </p>
    <p num="109">Extending in a radial direction 44, a corrugation 30 may be tapered in order to reduce weight, balance forces, permit selected distortion, or provide more uniform impact loading, For example, near the rim 16, more material exists in a circumferential direction 48 to absorb loading, breakage, distortion, and the like as a result of shock loads (forces, impact) when compared with a location near or at the core wall 102.</p>
    <p num="110">
      Moreover, the bending moment on a flange 12 is greatest near the core 22 in response to a load applied near the rim 16.

      Thus, a tapered flange 12 having a narrower flange thickness 114 near the rim 12 may provide a closer balance or more uniform distribution of forces in the flange 12.
      <br/>
      On the other hand, selective fracture may be designed into various corrugations, as a result of a uniform flange thickness 114, thus focusing energy at the core 22 as it interfaces with the web 18 (e.g. walls 111 and connector walls 119.)

      Referring to FIG. 7, one may note that a point 132 along a connector wall 19ac is one type of core contact point 81 or core contact line 81 for a directorix 19ac or connector wall 19ac.
      <br/>
      Similarly, for the corrugation 30a, the core contact line 81 or core contact point 81 is identified by the point or line 130 of tangency of the connector wall 19ab with the core wall 102.

      Thus, adjacent connector walls 19ac, 19ab operate similarly.

      For example, if the width 133 of a corrugation 30 (e.g. 30a) is comparatively larger than the same dimension 133 of an adjacent corrugation 30 (e.g. 30b, 30c), at any given distance 131 or radius 131 from a central axis 50 of a flange 12, distortion may be effected.
      <br/>
      Moreover, the clear span 93 between adjacent internal corrugations 30 (e.g. on the inside face of the flange 12) may be reduced.
      <br/>
      The walls 111a having a larger dimension 133 may be more susceptible to distortion in an axial direction or a direction upon impact.
    </p>
    <p num="115">
      Accordingly, non-uniform stiffness within adjacent walls 111, corresponding to adjacent corrugations 30, may provide absorption of energy without failure of the fundamental structure of the flange.
      <br/>
      Nevertheless, the corrugations 30 may prevent catastrophic failure with an appropriate amount of relative stiffness where needed.
      <br/>
      Corrugations 30 having a comparatively narrower width 133 may be designed to bend or spring by virtue of having an aspect ratio closer to a value of one.
    </p>
    <p num="116">
      An aspect ratio may be thought of as the ratio of depth 95 of a cavity 31 with respect to a span 133 or width 133 of a single corrugation 30 at a particular radius 131.
      <br/>
      Thus, for example, interior walls 111 in contact with stranded material may have comparatively larger widths 133 than exterior walls 111 not in contact with the stranded material.
      <br/>
      Moreover, provision of a sharp angle near the transition from a connector wall 19 to a corrugation wall 111 may promote selective fracture, allowing a corrugation 30 to spring separately from its adjacent corrugation.
      <br/>
      Thus, selective local failure or separation may actually protect the overall integrity of the flange 12 under impact or shock loading.

      Stress concentration inhibition may be provided by fillets in selective corners.
      <br/>
      Increased stress concentration factors may be provided by sharpening the angle between connected, especially orthogonal, surfaces.

      Fillets need not be constant along the entire length of a directorix 70 (connector wall 95).

    <p num="118">
      In one embodiment, a corrugation 30 may be formed to have a comparatively sharper angle between a wall 111 and one of the adjacent connecting walls 19 with a comparatively more rounded transition between the same wall 111 and its opposite connecting wall 19.
      <br/>
      Thus, one connecting wall 19 will remain with one corrugation 30, while the adjacent connecting wall 19 will remain integral with the wall 11 of the next corrugation 30.
    </p>
    <p num="119">
      For example, a corrugation 30a may remain integral with the connecting wall 19ac, by virtue of proper location of fillets, while separating from the connector wall 19ab due to an absence or sharpness of fillets.
      <br/>
      Similarly, the corrugation 30b or 30c may provide selective breakage and selective integrity in order to absorb more shock with distortion and breakage.
    </p>
    <p num="120">
      Breakage absorbs tremendous amounts of energy.
      <br/>
      Selective breakage may absorb energy of impact in areas where the contained wire or other stranded material on a tube 20 of a reel 10 or spool 10 will not be damaged or rendered unusable or inaccessible.

      If the connector walls 19 of the corrugations 30 of FIG. 7 are straightened in accordance with other designs illustrated in FIG. 4 or similar thereto, impact loads may be delivered directly from the rim 16 to the core 22.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, breakage may occur between the corrugations 30 and the core 22.
      <br/>
      Whereas the apparatus of FIG. 7 may provide eccentric loading on the core 22, reducing, absorbing, or eliminating much of the radially directed energy from the corrugations 30 to the core 22, a straight connector wall connected normal to a core tangent 78, may fracture from the core 22 at the core wall 102 or in the web 18.
      <br/>
      However, as with bending loads, once fracture occurs, a corrugation can both re-distribute loads through the web 18 and resist further failure due to its shape.
      <br/>
      A comparatively longer core wall 102 (as compared with corrugation 30 thickness 114 axially) may act as a cantilevered "barrel stave," flexing radially but not failing axially at all locations.

      Again, in selected embodiments, one connector wall 19 corresponding to an individual corrugation 30 may have a core angle 80 close to perpendicular.

      Impact may cause shearing of the core 22 or web 18 and breakage.
      <br/>
      Meanwhile, an adjacent connector wall 19 may be curved or positioned eccentrically, tangent, or the like, with respect to the core 22 or a core tangent 78.

      The wall 19 may permit torsional distortion in one or more directions 44, 46, 48.

      <br/>
      Thus, both fracture and toughness may be provided for absorbing impact without destroying the entire structural integrity of a corrugation 30.
      <br/>
      In certain embodiments, adjacent corrugations 30, meaning in this context adjacent and on the same side (e.g. inside or outside) of the flange 12, may be disposed closer together and alternating in their impact resistance and toughness characteristics).

      A corrugation 134 and an adjacent corrugation 136 may share a connector wall 135, a specific instance of a wall 19.

      Nevertheless, in view of the formation of contact areas 138 or connection areas 138, the corrugation 134 may transition within a single surface 112 to the cap 23 of the core 22.
      <br/>
      A corrugation 134 may tend to continue fracture and reduce or eliminate integrity between portions of the web 18, or between the web 18 and core 22.
      <br/>
      However, all fracturing will absorb energy, while tending to protect a fulcrum area opposite (axially) the fracture beginning in the corner 77a and proceeding circumferentially 48 a limited distance due to the circumferential discontinuity of material.

      <br/>
      The structural strength and stiffness of the web 18 may then redistribute loading even when partially separated from the core 22 by failure under bending loads.

      In the latter event, cantilevered portions may extend axially parallel to one another.

      Moreover, once some amount of fracture has occurred, stress may be relieved.
      <br/>
      Moreover, inasmuch as three orthogonal surfaces appear at each ofthe corners 152, 154, 156, a selective fracture to separate one surface from the other two, may permit flexure between the two remaining orthogonal surfaces.

      So long as rigidity is maintained, loads must either be supported or materials must be distorted (deflected) or fractured.

      Bending survival may be substantially enhanced.

      Fracture directions may be thus controlled.

    <p num="154">
      A point 152 may be formed by connecting walls 135.
      <br/>
      Nevertheless, selection of the respective dimensions of the exterior corrugations 134 and interior corrugations 136 may leave a space for corners 154, 156 in an individual interior corrugation 136 to be separated, analogously to the structure of FIG. 10. Numbers, dimensions, and aspect ratios of corrugations 134, 136 may be selected in accordance with design choices to balance strength, rigidity, flexibility, distortion, toughness, selective fracture, and so forth as described previously.
    </p>
    <p num="155">
      Continuous fracture of the web 18 from the core 22 can be avoided by the directionality of loadings in bending or direct radial impact.
      <br/>
      Moreover, distortion and stiffness may be balanced against each other in olefinic plastics, while fracture lengths and directions may be balanced against weight and strength in more brittle materials for maintaining system integrity.
    </p>
    <p num="156">
      Referring to FIG. 13, a spool 10 or reel 10 may include a flange 12 having panels 160 disposed interiorly (toward the wire or strand) or exteriorly, alternating therebetween, or in some designed pattern.
      <br/>
      In the embodiment of FIG. 13, the connecting walls 162 are all illustrated as viewable from the exterior as ribs 162.
      <br/>
      Nevertheless, the ribs 162 need only be so displayed for the sake of clarity.
      <br/>
      As a practical matter, all of the combinations for recessing or raising individual panels 160 cannot be shown in a single figure.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, any of the panels 160 may be raised or recessed axially as desired.
      <br/>
      Thus, the ribs 162 may represent schematically the connecting walls 162 (e.g. 19) between adjacent panels 160.
      <br/>
      In the embodiment of FIG. 13, a core region 62 extends from a core 22 outward to a transition 60.
    </p>
    <p num="157">
      Between the transition 60 or transition region 60 and the rim 16, defined by a rim wall 13 extending circumferentially 48 and axially 46, stiffness, toughness, fracture resistance, fracture susceptibility, and the like may be traded off differently than in the core region 62.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, the rim region 64 may be designed to have very stiff, thin, fracture-susceptible walls.
      <br/>
      Thus, in a standard drop test (e.g. from workbench height) a portion of a flange 12 may be bent, crushed, or broken by axial, off-axis, or radial loads near the rim 16 in order to preserve the integrity of connections between the core 22 and the web 18 of the flange 12 in the core region 62.
    </p>
    <p num="158">
      Alternatively, the rim region 64 of the web 18 may be adapted to provided selected distortion and deflection to absorb the energy of impact, up to some pre-designed failure point at which fracture may be precipitated.
      <br/>
      Nevertheless, in the core region 62, flexibility, eccentricity, spring response, distortion, and the like as described with respect to other designs herein, may be designed in as appropriate.
    </p>
    <p num="159">
      The transition region 60 may be defined by a medial rim 164.
      <br/>
      A medial rim 164 may be smooth, or somewhat abrupt, and may be analogous to the outer rim 16 of the flange 12.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, specific energy absorption mechanisms may be implemented near the medial rim 164 to mollify the transmission of radial and bending loads toward the core 22 through the core region 62 of the flange 12.
    </p>
    <p num="160">
      The counter-running, connecting walls 162, tend to stiffen the flange substantially.
      <br/>
      Uniformly curved, connecting walls 162, all oriented in a single orientation and distributed circumferentially 48, may provide more flexibility, and less stiffness, both radially and in bending.
      <br/>
      The direction or sense of curvature of the connecting walls 162 in the rim region 164 and the connecting walls 135 in the core region 62 may be the same or opposite.
      <br/>
      Thus, either an inflected or a monotonic curvature or sense of curvature may be provided.

    <p num="161">
      Referring to FIG. 14 a spool 10 or a reel 10 may be provided with tapered corrugations 30.
      <br/>
      The components of the apparatus of FIG. 14 correspond to those of FIG. 6, but show schematically a variable cavity depth 116 and flange thickness 114.
      <br/>
      The flange thickness 114 and cavity depth 116 vary with radial 44 position along the flange 12.
      <br/>
      Both outer corrugations 134 and inner corrugations 136 are illustrated in cross section.
      <br/>
      The larger size of the rim 16 may provide distribution or re-distribution of loads upon localized failure of the web 18 between the rim 16 and core 22, as described above.
      <br/>
      Wider connecting walls 19, 135 may absorb more energy of distortion during and preceding fracture, thus protecting a wall 111 opposite one failing in bending.
    </p>
    <p num="162">
      Referring to FIG. 15. a cross-section of a flange 12, in accordance with FIG. 2 may illustrate various aspects of corrugations 30.
      <br/>
      For example, a wall 111 of a corrugation 30 may have a uniform or non-uniform pitch 170.
      <br/>
      Even with a uniform pitch 170, the circumferential span 172 within a cavity 31 of a corrugation 30 may be different for interior and exterior corrugations 30.
      <br/>
      For example, various patterns 174 (note, herein, that a trailing alphabetical character is simply a specific instance of the leading reference numeral that generically refers to all items of the same type or class) may have various aspect ratios of cavity depth 116 to width 172.
    </p>
    <p num="163">
      An aspect ratio may change dramatically as a cavity width 172 narrows near the core 22 and widens near the rim 16.
      <br/>
      By contrast, a cavity depth 116 may be more-or-less constant.
      <br/>
      However, a non-constant or non-uniform cavity depth 116 may be employed as illustrated in FIG. 14. Accordingly, the aspect ratio of a corrugation 30 may change dramatically from a rim having a comparatively large circumferential dimension 172 and the smallest axial dimension 116.
      <br/>
      Near the core 22, the circumferential dimension 172 will be minimized, while the axial cavity depth dimension 116 will be maximized.
    </p>
    <p num="164">
      The pattern 174a presumes a rectangular or perpendicular relationship between connecting walls 19 and the corresponding corrugation walls 175a, 175b.
      <br/>
      The description of a wall 111 as an inner wall 175a and an outer wall 175b is merely for convenience.
    </p>
    <p num="165">
      A trapezoidal pattern 174b may provide a circumferential span 172 in a cavity 31a interior (near the wire) that may or may not be of the same dimension when disposed exterior to the flange (away from the wire).
      <br/>
      Similarly, a cavity depth 116 may vary circumferentially according to an angle 176 at which a wall 111 extends to form a ramp 177 along a ramp span 178.
      <br/>
      The comparative proportion or aspect ratio of both the clear span 172 (clear circumferential span or open circumferential span 172) and the cavity depth 116 may be designed for a specific application.
    </p>
    <p num="166">
      Moreover, the aspect ratio of open spans 172 corresponding to exterior walls 175b and interior walls 175a of corrugations 30 may be selected to provide the various benefits defined herein.
      <br/>
      Thus, that aspect ratio need not be unity.
      <br/>
      Moreover, the aspect ratio of cavity depth 116 to clear span 172, or even to the total pitch 170 may be designed to promote structural integrity and energy absorption.
      <br/>
      Maximum cavity depth 116 may vary from one corrugation 30 to another 30.
      <br/>
      In one embodiment, the aspect ratio of cavity depth 116 to clear span 172 for a corrugation 30 corresponding to an exterior wall 175b may be of an order of magnitude of one or less.
      <br/>
      Meanwhile, the angle 176 may typically be adapted between 0 and 90 degrees accordingly.
      <br/>
      Likewise, the angle 176 will affect the span 178 associated with the ramp portion 177.
    </p>
    <p num="167">
      The pattern 174c may take on may ofthe attributes of the pattern 174b.
      <br/>
      Nevertheless, the pattern 174c may be seen as a degenerate form of the pattern 174b.
      <br/>
      The cavities 31 have collapsed (degenerate case) from trapezoids to triangles.
      <br/>
      Thus, one may compare the inside peak 179a corresponding to an interior wall 175a to the exterior or outside peak 179b corresponding to an interior wall 175b of a corrugation 30.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, a flange thickness 114 may still be defined for all of the patterns 174.
      <br/>
      Nevertheless, less surface area is presented to the stranded material in the design of the pattern 174c.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, stiff, stranded material, may be best adapted to the use of the flanges 12 of the pattern 174c.
    </p>
    <p num="168">
      The pattern 174d may be thought of as a non-uniform aspect ratio of the interior cavities 31a to exterior cavities 31b corresponding to exterior corrugation walls 175b and interior corrugation walls 175a, respectively.
      <br/>
      Thus, the span 172a divided by the span 172b may provide a circumferential aspect ratio for non-uniform corrugations 30.
      <br/>
      Likewise, uniform corrugations 30 may have a circumferential aspect ratio of one.
      <br/>
      That is, at any given radius 131 from a center 50, the circumferential aspect ratio is one for a uniformly distributed arrangement of corrugations 30 extending substantially radially.
      <br/>
      Again, the aspect ratio of cavity depth 116 to span 172a, as well as the aspect ratio of cavity depth 116 to the exterior or outer span 172b may be designed as described herinabove.
    </p>
    <p num="169">
      The pattern 174e may be sinusoidal or otherwise curved and inflected as desired.
      <br/>
      Many of burdens and benefits of the pattern 174e correspond to the pattern 174c.
      <br/>
      As a practical matter, the pattern 174d, if modified slightly to permit a draft angle (for molding) less radical than the ramp 177 of the pattern 174b, may provide an excellent combination of flexure, toughness, stiffness, energy absorption, spring response or resilience and so forth for a flange design.
    </p>
    <p num="170">
      Referring to FIG. 16, various configurations of flanges 12 are illustrated.
      <br/>
      In general, each flange extends from a center line 50 a distance 59 or a radius 59 to the outer extremity of a rim 16.
      <br/>
      The pattern 180a reflects a cross-section cut radially through half a flange 12.
      <br/>
      The pattern 180a may reflect the design of FIG. 3, FIG. 7, FIG. 9, or FIG. 11, in selected embodiments.
      <br/>
      That is, the walls 111 may extend to provide interior cavities and exterior cavities 31b.
      <br/>
      Thus, the corrugations 30 may extend circumferentially, exclusively, or circumferentially and radially as illustrated in FIGS. 1-14. A liner 182 may be provided as illustrated in the liner 120 of FIG. 7.
    </p>
    <p num="171">
      The periodicity of the cavities 31a, 31b in a radial direction 44 may be governed by the frequency or circumferential pitch 170 of a directorix 70 defining corrugations 30, regularly or irregularly, about the circumference 48 of a flange 12.
      <br/>
      Accordingly a liner 182 of paper, or of some other material may be provided to promote or support stranded materials against bulging into the interior cavities 31a.
    </p>
    <p num="172">
      The pattern 180b illustrates a tapered corrugation 30.
      <br/>
      The corrugations 30 may be tapered regardless of which pattern 174 (see FIG. 15) is used.
      <br/>
      Similarly, the pattern 180c of FIG. 16 corresponds to a uniform corrugation thickness 114.
    </p>
    <p num="173">
      From the above discussion, it will be appreciated that the present invention provides a method and apparatus for balancing strength, stiffness, fracture, and toughness in reels and spools, incorporating material properties.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, corrugations may be adapted to several configurations and a design process calculated to protect stranded materials contained on a spool or reel.
      <br/>
      Cost of material, molding speeds, and the like may all be affected as desired by selection of specific design criteria in accordance with the invention.
      <br/>
      Spools and reels from small unitary sizes on the order of inches or smaller may be produces according to the invention.
      <br/>
      Likewise, reels of substantial size for supporting large amounts of heavy materials such as wire, cable, wire rope, and the like may be designed in sizes having an order of magnitude on the order of feet.
