    <p num="19">
      The lower alkyl groups referred to herein preferably contain 1-6 carbon atoms and include methyl, ethyl, propyl, butyl, pentyl, hexyl, and the corresponding branched-chain isomers thereof.
      <br/>
      These groups are optionally substituted by one or more halo, hydroxy, amino or lower alkylamino groups.
    </p>
    <p num="20">
      In the instance where R" and R'", together with the nitrogen atom to which they are attached, form a heterocyclic ring having from 5 to 7 members, which may optionally contain a sulfur, oxygen, silicon, selenium or additional nitrogen atom, such heterocyclic rings are typified by pyrrolyl, imidazolyl, pyrazolyl, pyrrolidinyl, imidazolidinyl, piperdinyl, morpholinyl and piperazinyl groups, which can optionally be substituted by lower alkyl groups.
      <br/>
      Especially preferred for use in the present invention are pyrrolodine, morpholino and piperazinyl groups.
    </p>
    <p num="21">
      Where the possibility exists for substitution of a phenyl or aryl ring, the position of the substituents may be ortho, meta, or para to the point of attachment of the phenyl or aryl ring to the nitrogen of the hydrazine group.
      <br/>
      Preferably, the substituents are para or meta to the point of attachment; and where more than one is present on the same ring, they are preferably in the para and meta positions.
    </p>
    <p num="22">
      The halo atoms in the above formula may be fluoro, chloro, bromo or iodo.
      <br/>
      The lower alkoxy groups contain 1-6, and preferably 1-3, carbon atoms and are illustrated by methoxy, ethoxy, n-propoxy, isopropoxy and the like.
    </p>
    <p num="23">
      The A, C, P and Q atomic groups of the compounds of formula I can be selected from a variety of such groups known in the chemical arts.
      <br/>
      In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the A and the combination of the P and Q group are each a pyridyl ring.
      <br/>
      Other embodiments are those wherein the A group is a quinolinyl, piperazinyl, or an anthracenyl group, optionally substituted with R, and R' substitutents.
    </p>
    <p num="24">
      The compounds of this invention are salts wherein the X- anion is derived from a acid, typically one which is biologically and pharmaceutically acceptable.
      <br/>
      The resultant salts can thus be derived from a variety of organic and inorganic acids such as sulfuric, phosphoric, hydrochloric, hydrobromic, sulfamic, citric, lactic, maleic, succinic, tartaric, cinnamic, acetic, benzoic, gluconic, ascorbic, methanesulfonic and related acids.
    </p>
    <p num="25">
      Of the compounds encompassed by formula I, certain substituents are preferred.
      <br/>
      For instance, the compounds wherein both the A and the combination of the P and Q group are a pyridyl ring are preferred, as are the compounds wherein the A group is derived from a quinolinyl group and the combination of the P and Q group is derived from a pyridyl group.
      <br/>
      These compounds are the result of the reaction of the N,N-disubstituted-formamide with the appropriately substituted 2,2'-bipyridine or 2-(2-pyridyl)4-carboxyquinoline.
      <br/>
      Also highly preferred due to their utility in biomolecular synthesis and various diagnostic applications are the compounds which are the reaction product of an N,N-disubstituted-formamide with an amino acid which has been coupled to 2-(2-pyridyl)4-carboxyquinoline.

      In certain cases, the preparation of the compounds of the instant invention involves the preparation and use of novel starting materials.
      <br/>
      A general scheme for the preparation of several of such starting materials is shown below as Scheme I. In this scheme, the preparation of several necessary starting materials for the process of the instant invention are the novel compounds of formula I wherein A represents the atomic group necessary to form a quinoline ring, and B represents the atomic group necessary to form a pyridyl ring is shown, using the known starting materials isatin and 2-acetylpyridine.
      <br/>
      In step A, isatin and 2-acetylpyridine are reacted in the presence of a strong base, such as sodium or potassium hydroxide to form the sodium or potassium salt of 2-(2-pyridyl)4-carboxyquinoline.
      <br/>
      This salt can then be converted to the free acid by treatment with a dilute solution of a strong mineral acid, such as hydrochloric or sulfuric acid.
      <br/>
      Treatment of the free acid with the appropriate alkanol and a strong acid affords the alkyl ester of the acid.
      <br/>
      This alkyl ester can then be reduced, using, for instance, sodium borohydride or another reducing agent to give the corresponding alcohol.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, the free acid can be converted to the corresponding acyl halide by treatment with thionyl chloride with or without the presence of a non-polar hydrocarbon solvent.
      <br/>
      As can be expected the acyl halide can serve as a starting material to produce additional compounds, such as the ethylene glycol ester, as well as the corresponding amide compounds such as by reaction with a diamine.
      <br/>
      These compounds have a reactive termini that can be used to generate additional novel compounds for use with the instant invention.
    </p>
    <p num="35">
      In a similar fashion, the pyrazine analogs of the compounds in Scheme I can be prepared by substituting 2-acetylpyrazine for 2-acetylpyridine.
      <br/>
      For example, 2-(2-pyrazinyl)-4-carboxyquinoline, (4)2-(2-pyrazinyl)-4-carboxymethylquinoline, (5) 2-(2-pyrazinyl)4-hydroxymethylquinoline, (6) 2-(2-pyrazinyl)-4-carboxyquinoline acid chloride; (7) 2-(2-pyrazinyl)-4-carboxyquinoline ethylene glycol ester; and 2-(2-pyrazinyl)4-carboxyquinoline, methyl benzyl ester, can be prepared by use of the appropriate 2-acetylpyrazine starting material.  (Chemical Structure image '3' not included in text)
    </p>
    <p num="36">
      A particularly useful embodiment of the present invention involves the reaction of acyl halide compounds with a natural or synthetic amino acid.
      <br/>
      As shown in Scheme II below, this reaction results in a starting material which links the amino acid to the carbonyl moiety.
      <br/>
      Generally, this reaction is conducted in an anhydrous polar solvent, such as anhydrous acetonitrile, in the presence of an acid acceptor, such as triethylamine.
      <br/>
      Preferred for use in this reaction are the naturally and non-naturally occurring amino acids and their alkyl, especially methyl, or benzyl esters.
      <br/>
      The reaction can also be extended to include peptides of two or more amino acids, and the alkyl or benzyl esters of amino acids and can thus function as a method of synthetically preparing a "tag" or label of such a peptide.
      <br/>
      Since non-natural amino acids and peptides can be derived from  BETA -lactams, fluorescent  BETA -lactams can be generated by the instant methodology.
      <br/>
      Particularly useful are fluorinated amino acids and  BETA -lactams.

      Depending upon the nature of the reactants, a solvent can be used or the reaction can proceed neat.
      <br/>
      When a solvent is utilized, it is typically a nonpolar aprotic solvent, such as benzene, toluene, hexane, etc. but polar solvents such as acetonitrile can also be used.

    <p num="44">
      Reaction conditions for the instant process vary depending upon the nature of the starting materials, and the presence or absence of a solvent.
      <br/>
      Typical temperatures range from 0 (degree)  C. to room temperature.
      <br/>
      With highly reactive starting materials, a somewhat lower temperature may be desirable, as well as the use of an inert atmosphere, such as a nitrogen or argon atmosphere, to inhibit side reactions.
    </p>
    <p num="45">
      Anhydrous conditions will also help to minimize possible side reactions, especially where more than one set of reactive nitrogen atoms are available, Where the various R. R'" and R"" substitutents would allow side reactions, they can be suitably protected. prior to the conduct of the reaction, to avoid such reactions.
      <br/>
      Typical protecting groups useful for such procedures are well-known in the art, and can be removed after isolation of the imidazolium compound.
    </p>
    <p num="46">
      Where the structure of the starting materials contains more than one N--C--C--N moiety, it will be appreciated that both reactive sites can be the subject of the instant process by use of two equivalents of the disubstituted formamide reactant.

      Numerous "monomer" (containing a single imidazolium ring) and "dimer" (containing two imidazolium rings) compounds of this type can be produced by the judicious choice of starting materials.

      Generally, the fluorescent compound of the instant invention is incorporated into the polymer matrix by extrusion or injection molding.
      <br/>
      The process of incorporation generally operates at a temperature range of about 150 (degree)  C. to about 250 (degree)  C., depending upon the polymer matrix utilized.
      <br/>
      When polymethyl methacrylate is used, the temperature is generally at a range of about 200 (degree)  C. to about 240 (degree)  C.

    <p num="51">The novel fluorescent pigments formed by mixing the compounds of the present invention with a polymer matrix are highly suitable for pigmenting waterborne paints and films and articles made of polyolefins, e.g. polyethylene or polypropylene, and for printing fiber materials, for example, fabrics in polyester or cotton or polyester/cotton blends.</p>
    <p num="52">Such fluorescent pigments possess high luminenscence and advantageous application properties, for example, high lightfastness and a low migration tendency.</p>
    <p num="53">
      The possession of fluorescent properties further enables the use of the compounds of the instant invention in a variety of medical, pharmaceutical and diagnostic applications.
      <br/>
      Fluorescent clonal markers can be utilized to elucidate various biological mechanisms, in both animal and plants such as the embryogenesis of an organism, drug binding sites, and drug disposition in the body.
    </p>
    <p num="54">
      For instance, by attaching a fluorescent compound of the instant invention to a biomolecule such as the end of one arm of a probe sequence of nucleic acids, and a non-fluorescent quench moiety to the end of the other arm of a probe sequence of nucleic acid, the synthesis of specific nucleic acids can be monitored.
      <br/>
      Similarly, when such fluorescent compounds are used in nucleic acid amplification assays, gene detection is homogeneous and sensitive.
      <br/>
      Still further, nucleic acid probes containing the fluorescent compounds of the instant invention can be introduced into living cells, thus enabling the origin, movement, and fate of specific mRNAs to be traced.
      <br/>
      Such methods of attaching fluorescent compounds to such probes have been described in the art, for example in Tyagi et al., Nature Biotechnology, 14, pp. 303-308, and T. Stein Chem.
      <br/>
      Eng News, Jul. 18, 1994, pp. 34-44. By utilizing the various compounds of the instant invention which emit light of a different wavelength, detection of many different targets in the same solution can be identified.
      <br/>
      For example, a two-dimensional array of immobilized molecular beacons derived from the compounds of the instant invention can be used in a single assay to carry out an extensive survey of an amplified genomic region.
      <br/>
      Fluorescence is especially useful to probe proteins, and DNA.
    </p>
    <p num="55">
      In similar fashion, the compounds of the instant invention can be utilized as fluorescent tags for any variety of biomolecules to enable the tracking and the disposition of such molecules.
      <br/>
      Especially important biomolecules which can be tagged by the instant compounds include amino acids, peptides, proteins, B-lactams, oligonucleotides, RNA, DNA, and lipids.
      <br/>
      The compounds of the instant invention can thus be included in kits to utilize as labeling agents for such biomolecules in various diagnostic and research applications.
      <br/>
      Methods for utilizing such fluorescent tags for biomolecules are described in, for instance, Rich et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc., (1995), 117, 733-739, Bakthavalam et al., J Med. Chem., (1991), 34, 3235-3241, Kraus et al., Chem. Rev., (1996), 96, 523-527, and Wilchek et al., Analytical Biochemistry, (1988), 171, 1-32, whose teachings are herein incorporated by reference, especially those pertinent to the development of biotin related-systems.
    </p>
    <p num="56">
      A further alternative to labeling already formed biomolecules involves the ab initio synthesis of biomolecules using amino acids which have been reacted in accordance with the process of the instant invention to contain the fluorescent tag within their structure.
      <br/>
      Typically, a solution of the amino acid, ester thereof or a  BETA -lactam in an anhydrous polar solvent, such as acetonitrile, is reacted with a compound of the instant invention which contains an acyl halide functional group, such as, for instance, the acyl chloride of 2-(2-pyridyl)4-carboxyquinoline, in the presence of an acid acceptor such as triethylamine.
      <br/>
      This reaction is typically conducted at temperatures of about 0 to about 20 (degree)  C. Typical reaction times range from about 1 to 10 hours depending upon the exact nature of the reactants.
      <br/>
      Using this method, one can prepare fluorescent amino acids, both natural and synthetic, which can then be utilized directly in the synthesis of biomolecules to provide fluorescent versions thereof.  BETA -lactams so modified can be used to generate non-natuarally occuring amino acids incorporating fluorescent characteristics.
    </p>
    <p num="57">
      Further, the compounds of the instant invention can be used as fluorescent sensors for transition metals due to the advantages of using a fluorescent tag which can be detected at a very low concentration level.
      <br/>
      Such usage is described, for instance, by Fabbrizzi et al., Chem. Euro. J., (1996), 2, pp. 75 et seq., whose teachings are herein incorporated by reference.
    </p>
    <p num="58">
      Another utility wherein the instant compounds can be used is in the preparation of non-linear optical polymers.
      <br/>
      By dissolving a compound of formula I in a polymer, subjecting the polymer to a large electric field at or above its glass transition temperature , and cooling the polymer, there is obtained a material with second-order optical non-linearity as described by Marder et al., Science, (1994) 263, pp 1706-1715.

    <p num="59">
      The compounds of the instant invention can also be utilized to label various therapeutic agents to enable their disposition in the body.
      <br/>
      As such, therapy with such labeled -therapeutic agents can be closely monitored with respect to target organs and tissues.
      <br/>
      This is particularly useful in the treatment of various cancers, especially those of a solid tumor type, where localization of the chemo-therapeutic agent is extremely important, and dosage, due to the possibility of side-effects, must be closely monitored.
      <br/>
