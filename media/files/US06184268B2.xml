    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="10">
      The present invention is generally directed to ink compositions, and processes thereof, and more specifically, the present invention is directed to processes for the preparation of colored aqueous, or water containing ink compositions particularly suitable for use in ink jet printing processes, and especially thermal ink jet processes, and other similar processes, and wherein there is permitted minimal or no kogation, inks with suitable particle sizes, minimal intercolor bleed for the images developed, and wherein paper curl is minimized and image smearing is minimal, or avoided.
      <br/>
      The inks in embodiments of the present invention are comprised of an ink vehicle, colorant, and additives, and wherein the inks exhibit no or minimal kogation or heater deposits when used with a high glass transition resin that is designed to complement the colorant.
      <br/>
      Prevention of heater deposits/kogation enables for example, superior ink jetting performance and enhanced life in the printhead, and excellent thermal stability of the ink, for example the ink usually will not decompose or settle for extended time periods of up to about one year.
    </p>
    <heading>PRIOR ART</heading>
    <p num="11">
      Ink jet printing can be considered a non-impact method that produces droplets of ink that are deposited on a substrate, such as paper or transparent film, in response to an electronic digital signal.
      <br/>
      Thermal or bubble jet drop-on-demand ink jet printers are useful as outputs for personal computers in the office and in the home.
    </p>
    <p num="12">
      In existing thermal ink jet printing, the printhead typically comprises one or more ink jet ejectors, such as disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,463,359, the disclosure of which is totally incorporated herein by reference, each ejector including a channel communicating with an ink supply chamber, or manifold, at one end and having an opening at the opposite end, referred to as a nozzle.
      <br/>
      A thermal energy generator, usually a resistor, is located in each of the channels a predetermined distance from the nozzles.
      <br/>
      The resistors are individually addressed with a current pulse to momentarily vaporize the ink and form a bubble, which expels an ink droplet.
      <br/>
      As the bubble grows, the ink rapidly bulges from the nozzle and is momentarily contained by the surface tension of the ink as a meniscus.
      <br/>
      As the bubble begins to collapse, the ink remaining in the channel between the nozzle and bubble starts to move toward the collapsing bubble, causing a volumetric contraction of the ink at the nozzle and resulting in the separation from the nozzle of the bulging ink as a droplet.
      <br/>
      The feed of additional ink provides the momentum and velocity for propelling the droplet towards a print sheet, such as a piece of paper.
      <br/>
      Since the droplet of ink is emitted only when the resistor is actuated, this type of thermal ink jet printing is known as "drop-on-demand" printing.
      <br/>
      Other types of ink jet printing, such as continuous-stream or acoustic, are also known.
    </p>
    <p num="13">Ink jet inks, and processes thereof are illustrated, for example, in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,840,674; 5,021,802; 5,041,161; 4,853,036; 5,124,718; 5,065,167 and 5,043,084, the disclosures of which are totally incorporated herein by reference.</p>
    <p num="14">
      In a single-color ink jet printing apparatus, the printhead typically comprises a linear array of ejectors, and the printhead is moved relative to the surface of the print sheet, either by moving the print sheet relative to a stationary printhead, or vice-versa, or both.
      <br/>
      In some systems, a relatively small printhead moves across a print sheet numerous times in swathes, much like a typewriter.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, a printhead, which consists of an array of ejectors and extends the full width of the print sheet, may be passed once down the print sheet to give full-page images in what is known as a "full-width array" (FWA) printer.
      <br/>
      When the printhead and the print sheet are moved relative to each other, imagewise digital data is used to selectively activate the thermal energy generators in the printhead to permit the desired image to be created on the print sheet.
    </p>
    <p num="15">
      With the demand for higher resolution printers, the nozzles in ink jet printers are decreasing in size.
      <br/>
      Nozzle openings are typically about 50 to 80 micrometers in width or diameter for 300 spi printers.
      <br/>
      With the advent of 600 spi printers, these nozzle openings are typically about 10 to about 40 micrometers in width or diameter.
      <br/>
      These small dimensions require inks that do not plug the small openings.
    </p>
    <p num="16">Therefore, an important consideration for ink jet ink can be the ability of the ink to be stable with minimal or no settling, the ability of the ink to remain in a fluid condition in a printhead opening on exposure to air, and moreover wherein when the inks are selected for ink jet printing there is minimized paper curl, or wherein paper curl can be controlled.</p>
    <p num="17">
      Another important measured property for an ink jet ink is the latency or decap time, which is the length of time over which an ink remains fluid in a printhead opening or nozzle when exposed to air and, therefore, is capable of firing a drop of ink at its intended target.
      <br/>
      Latency is the maximum idling times allowed for ink to be jetted by a printer with a speed equal to or greater than 5 m/s (equivalent to an ink traveling a distance of 0.5 millimeter in less than 100  MU s) without a failure.
      <br/>
      This measurement can be accomplished with the printhead or nozzles uncovered or decapped and generally at a relative humidity of about 15 percent.
      <br/>
      The time interval is the longest length of time that the printhead, uncovered, will still fire or eject a specified drop without drop displacement or loss of density.
      <br/>
      The longer the latency time rating, the more desirable the ink.
      <br/>
      The inks of the present invention possess many of these characteristics in embodiments thereof.
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      Moreover, another important consideration for ink jet inks, especially for pigment, such as carbon black, based inks, is for the pigment dispersion to remain stable throughout the life of the ink jet cartridge.
      <br/>
      Dye-based ink jet inks suffer from deficiencies in waterfastness and lightfastness after being printed on various substrates.
      <br/>
      Pigments provide an image on a wide variety of substrates, having high optical density with high waterfastness and lightfastness.
      <br/>
      Therefore, pigments are a preferred alternative to dyes, provided the pigment dispersions can be made stable to prevent flocculation and/or aggregation and settling.
      <br/>
      Some cosolvents that can be selected as clogging inhibitors cause destabilization of pigment dispersions and, therefore, are not usually effective in pigmented inks.
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      There is thus a need for aqueous ink compositions and processes thereof that can be utilized in high resolution ink jet printers.
      <br/>
      Additionally, there is a need for colored, especially pigmented inks that provide high latency and also remain stable throughout the life of the ink jet cartridge.
      <br/>
      There is also a need for pigmented inks that provide high optical density in a single pass.
      <br/>
      More importantly, there is a need for ink jet inks wherein paper curl, and/or image smearing can be eliminated or minimized when such inks are selected for ink jet printing processes, and wherein the images possess minimal, or acceptable intercolor bleed, that is for example, wherein color overlap, or diffusing of one color into another is minimal, or avoided; and wherein excellent waterfast and lightfast images can be generated.

    <p num="68">Procedure for Identifying Kogation:</p>
    <p num="69">
      To monitor the kogation behavior, droplets of ink were added to an open faced heater and electrical current was applied to generate bubble formation.
      <br/>
      The pulsing was run to 2 * 10 6 pulses at 38 Volts at 2KHz.
      <br/>
      The heater was then removed and examined underneath a microscope for heater deposit examination.
      <br/>
      In addition, the heater was rinsed with Dl water and reexamined to observe if particulates were removed.
      <br/>
      This helps to identify the severity of the depositions on the heaters.
      <br/>
      Reported is the before rinsing process.
      <br/>
      Having the heaters covered with debris, an early sign of kogation, since the number of pulses is fairly small compared to the expected life of the heaters in a printer machine.
      <br/>
      When heaters are covered with debris, they insulate the heaters, hence less energy is available for formation of the ink bubble to generate the appropriate drop size.
      <br/>
      To the consumer, the image printed over time would decrease in optical density and produce streaky prints, with the additional failure of the heaters.
    </p>
    <p num="70">
      Thermal stability is also important for pigmented ink systems.
      <br/>
      Heat treatment at 60 (degree)  C. for 24 hours provides an indication if the ink is sufficiently stable.
      <br/>
      Monitoring of physical properties is one tool for assessing the aforementioned ink stability.
      <br/>
      Deviations of 0.3 or greater in viscosity can be disadvantageous as the ink properties in the printhead would change and cause nonuniformity in the ink drops on printed paper.
      <br/>
      Also, the ink may not function as desired if the thermal stability is compromised, for example ejection efficiency and optical density would be decreased and phase separation of the ink would occur at the front face of the printhead.

      The rating for 1 and 2 indicate that essentially no heater deposits were visually seen on the heaters after the kogation procedure was performed.
      <br/>
      The use of a higher glass transition resin combined with the appropriate colorant, or carbon black dispersion provided excellent interaction in the ink mixture, hence no agglomeration to the heaters upon firing the heaters.
      <br/>
      In the Comparative Examples, the resins with low glass transition temperatures agglomerated upon heating with the carbon black dispersion causing excessive heater deposits and insulating the heaters.
      <br/>
      The grading of a 7 indicates heavy ink deposits, and when this occurs, the firing frequency decreases, and the efficiency of the voltage applied is reduced significantly, resulting in poor jetting and streaky prints from the printhead, and lower optical density.
