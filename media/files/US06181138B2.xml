      An azimuthally tunable resistivity measurement tool is provided.
      <br/>
      In one embodiment, the tool comprises a set of three skewed receiver antennas and a transmitter antenna.
      <br/>
      The three skewed receiver antennas are oriented in equally-spaced azimuthal directions to give them preferential sensitivity in those directions.
      <br/>
      The transmitter antenna transmits a radio-frequency signal that propagates through the formation surrounding a borehole.
      <br/>
      The signals from the three receiver antennas can be measured and combined to synthesize the signal that would be received by a virtual antenna oriented in any desired direction.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, virtual receivers oriented perpendicular to the tool axis and with variable azimuthal orientations can be synthesized.
      <br/>
      The orientation of such a virtual receiver that has a maximized receive signal amplitude can be used to identify the direction of a nearby bed boundary, and the maximized amplitude can be used to estimate the distance to the boundary.
      <br/>
      In another embodiment, the tool comprises a set of three skewed transmitter antennas and a receiver antenna.
      <br/>
      The signal responses of the receiver antenna to each of the transmitter antennas can be measured and combined to synthesize a signal response to a virtual transmitter antenna oriented in any desired direction.
      <br/>
      In yet another embodiment, the tool comprises a set of skewed transmitter antennas and a set of skewed receiver antennas.
      <br/>
      The skewed transmitter and receiver antennas work cooperatively to establish virtual transmitter/receiver pairs oriented in any desired azimuthal directions.

    <p num="1">
      The present invention relates generally to a bottomhole drilling assembly that includes a logging while drilling ("LWD") sub-system for determining characteristics of the borehole and formation during the drilling of a well.
      <br/>
      More particularly, the present invention relates to a resistivity logging tool for measuring formation resistivity parameters during drilling.
      <br/>
      Still more particularly, the present invention comprises an azimuthally tunable resistivity tool to facilitate navigation relative to a bed boundary during drilling.

    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">
      The gathering of downhole information has been done by the oil well industry for many years.
      <br/>
      Modern petroleum drilling and production operations demand a great quantity of information relating to the parameters and conditions downhole.
      <br/>
      Such information typically includes the location and orientation of the wellbore and drilling assembly, earth formation properties, and drilling environment parameters downhole.
      <br/>
      The collection of information relating to formation properties and conditions downhole is commonly referred to as "logging", and can be performed by several methods.
    </p>
    <p num="3">
      In conventional wireline logging, a probe or "sonde" having various sensors is lowered into the borehole after some or all of the well has been drilled.
      <br/>
      The sonde is typically constructed as a hermetically sealed steel cylinder for housing the sensors, and is typically suspended from the end of a long cable or "wireline".
      <br/>
      The wireline mechanically suspends the sonde and also provides electrical conductors between the sensors (and associated instrumentation within the sonde) and electrical equipment located at the surface of the well.
      <br/>
      Normally, the cable transports power and control signals to the sonde, and transports information signals from the sonde to the surface.
      <br/>
      In accordance with conventional techniques, various parameters of the earth's formations adjacent the borehole are measured and correlated with the position of the sonde in the borehole as the sonde is pulled uphole.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      The sensors used in a wireline sonde may include a source device for transmitting energy into the formation, and one or more receivers for detecting the energy reflected from the formation.
      <br/>
      Various sensors have been used to determine particular characteristics of the formation, including nuclear sensors, acoustic sensors, and electrical sensors.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      For an underground formation to contain petroleum, and for the formation to permit the petroleum to flow through it, the rock comprising the formation must have certain well known physical characteristics.
      <br/>
      For example, one characteristic is that the rock in the formation have space to store petroleum.
      <br/>
      If the rock in a formation has openings, voids, and spaces in which oil and gas may be stored, it is characterized as "porous".
      <br/>
      Thus, by determining if the rock is porous, one skilled in the art can determine whether or not the formation has the requisite physical properties to store and yield petroleum.
      <br/>
      Various wireline sensors may be used to measure formation porosity.
      <br/>
      Examples include the acoustic sensors described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,237,153, 3,312,934, 3,593,255, 4,649,525, 4,718,046, 4,869,349, and 5,069,308.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      While wireline logging is useful in assimilating information relating to formations downhole, it nonetheless has certain disadvantages.
      <br/>
      For example, before the wireline logging tool can be run in the wellbore, the drillstring and bottomhole assembly must first be removed or "tripped" from the borehole, resulting in considerable expense and a loss of drilling time for the driller (who typically is paying daily fees for the rental of drilling equipment).
      <br/>
      In addition, because wireline tools are unable to collect data during the actual drilling operation, drillers must at times make decisions (such as the direction to drill, etc.) based on limited and possibly insufficient information, or else incur the costs of tripping the drillstring to run a wireline logging tool.
      <br/>
      Another disadvantage is that because wireline logging occurs a relatively long period after the wellbore is drilled, the accuracy of the wireline measurement can be questionable.
      <br/>
      As one skilled in the art will understand, the wellbore conditions tend to degrade as drilling muds invade the formation in the vicinity of the wellbore.
      <br/>
      In addition, the borehole shape may begin to degrade, reducing the accuracy of the measurements.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      Because of these limitations associated with wireline logging, there recently has been an increased emphasis on the collection of data during the drilling process itself By collecting and processing data during the drilling process, the necessity of tripping the drilling assembly to insert a wireline logging tool can be eliminated, and the driller can make accurate "real-time" modifications or corrections as needed to optimize drilling performance.
      <br/>
      For example, the driller may change the weight-on-bit to cause the bottomhole assembly to tend to drill in a particular direction, or, if a steerable bottomhole assembly is used, the driller may operate in the sliding mode to effect source corrections.
      <br/>
      Moreover, the measurement of formation parameters during drilling, and hopefully before invasion of the formation, increases the usefulness of the measured data.
      <br/>
      Further, making formation and borehole measurements during drilling can save the additional rig time which otherwise would be required to run a wireline logging tool.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      Designs for measuring conditions downhole along with the movement and location of the drilling assembly, contemporaneously with the drilling of the well, have come to be known as "measurement-while drilling" techniques, or "MWD".
      <br/>
      Similar techniques, concentrating more on the measurement of formation parameters, have commonly been referred to as "logging while drilling" techniques, or "LWD".
      <br/>
      While distinctions between MWD and LWD may exist, the terms MWD and LWD often are used interchangeably.
      <br/>
      For the purposes of this disclosure, the term LWD will be used with the understanding that this term encompasses both the collection of formation parameters and the collection of information relating to the movement and position of the drilling assembly.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      The measurement of formation properties during drilling of the well by LWD systems improves the timeliness of measurement data and, consequently, increases the efficiency of drilling operations.
      <br/>
      Typically, LWD measurements are used to provide information regarding the particular formation in which the borehole is traversing.
      <br/>
      During the last several years, many in the industry have noted the desirability of an LWD system that could be especially used to detect bed boundaries in a real-time fashion to enable the driller to make directional corrections to stay in the pay zone.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, the LWD system could be used as part of a "Smart" system to automatically maintain the drill bit in the pay zone.
      <br/>
      See, e.g. commonly assigned U.S. Pat. No. 5,332,048, the teachings of which are incorporated by reference herein.
      <br/>
      The assignee has also developed a system which permits the measurement of LWD data at the drill bit to provide an earlier indication of bed boundaries and formation characteristics.
      <br/>
      See U.S. Pat. No. 5,160,925. The use of an LWD system with these other systems makes it possible to conduct at least certain portions of the drilling process automatically.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      Ordinarily, a well is drilled vertically for at least a portion of its depth.
      <br/>
      The layers or strata that make up the earth's crust are generally substantially horizontal.
      <br/>
      Therefore, during vertical drilling, the well is substantially perpendicular to the geological formations through which it passes.
      <br/>
      One of the properties of the formation that is commonly logged is its resistivity.
      <br/>
      LWD tools that are designed to measure the resistivity of the surrounding formation need not be azimuthally focused, as the formation in question surrounds the wellbore and is essentially the same in all directions.
      <br/>
      Thus the rotation of the LWD tool with the bit has no significant effect on the measured resistivity.
      <br/>
      For this reason, typical LWD resistivity tools that are adapted for use in vertical wells are azimuthally symmetric and have no azimuthal sensitivity.
    </p>
    <p num="11">
      In certain applications, however, such as when drilling through formations in which the reservoir boundaries extend vertically, or when drilling from an off-shore platform, it is desirable to drill wells at less of an angle with respect to bed boundaries in the strata.
      <br/>
      This is often termed "horizontal" drilling.
      <br/>
      When drilling horizontally, it is desirable to maintain the well bore in the pay zone (the formation which contains hydrocarbons) as much as possible so as to maximize the recovery.
      <br/>
      This can be difficult since formations may dip or divert.
      <br/>
      Thus, while attempting to drill and maintain the well bore within a particular formation, the drill bit may approach a bed boundary.
      <br/>
      As the rotating bit approaches the bed boundary, the bed boundary will be on one side of the bit axis, i.e. in one azimuthal range with respect to the bit axis.
    </p>
    <p num="12">
      If a near-bit resistivity tool were capable of sensing resistivity values azimuthally, the sensed values could be analyzed to discern the direction of the bed boundary.
      <br/>
      If the tool were sufficiently sensitive, the approaching bed boundary would be detected in sufficient time to allow the driller to make corrections in accordance with known techniques to avoid exiting the desired formation.
      <br/>
      Hence, it is desirable to provide an LWD tool that allows azimuthally sensitive resistivity measurements, a tool that is easy to manufacture and assemble and that is sufficiently durable and reliable in the drilling environment.
    </p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="13">
      Accordingly, there is provided herein an azimuthally tunable resistivity measurement tool.
      <br/>
      In one embodiment, the tool comprises a set of three skewed receiver antennas and a transmitter antenna.
      <br/>
      The three skewed receiver antennas are oriented in equally spaced azimuthal directions to give them preferential sensitivity in those directions.
      <br/>
      The transmitter antenna transmits a radio-frequency signal that propagates through the formation surrounding a borehole.
      <br/>
      The signals from the three receiver antennas can be measured and combined to synthesize the signal that would be received by a virtual antenna oriented in any desired direction.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, virtual receivers oriented perpendicular to the tool axis and with variable azimuthal orientations can be synthesized.
      <br/>
      The orientation of such a virtual receiver that has a maximized receive signal amplitude can be used to identify the direction of a nearby bed boundary, and the maximized amplitude can be used to estimate the distance to the boundary.

    <p num="14">
      In another embodiment, the tool comprises a set of three skewed transmitter antennas and a receiver antenna.
      <br/>
      The three skewed transmitter antennas are oriented in equally spaced azimuthal directions to give them preferential gain in those directions.
      <br/>
      The signals received by the receiver antenna in response to a signal from each of the transmitter antennas can be measured and combined to synthesize a signal received by the receiver antenna in response to a signal from a virtual transmitter antenna oriented in any desired direction.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, virtual transmitters oriented perpendicular to the tool axis with variable azimuthal orientations can be synthesized.
      <br/>
      The orientation of such a virtual antenna that creates a maximized response signal can be used to identify the direction of a nearby bed boundary, and the maximized amplitude can be used to estimate the distance to the boundary.

      During the course of the following description, the terms "above" and "below" are used to denote the relative position of certain components with respect to the direction of flow of the incoming drilling mud.
      <br/>
      Thus, where a term is described as above another, it is intended to mean that drilling mud flows first through the first component before flowing through the second component.
      <br/>
      Thus, these and other terms are used to identify the relative position of components in the bottomhole assembly (or BHA), with respect to the distance to the surface of the well, measured along the wellbore path.
    </p>
    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading>
    <p num="18">
      Referring now to FIG. 1, a drilling installation is shown.
      <br/>
      A drilling rig 10 at the surface 12 of the well supports a drill string 14.
      <br/>
      The drill string 14 penetrates through a work platform 16 and into a borehole 18 that is drilled through earth formations 20 and 21.
      <br/>
      The drill string 14 may comprise coil tubing 24 from a spool 22 at its upper end, and a bottom hole assembly 26 (commonly referred to as a "BHA") coupled to the lower end of the coil tubing 24.
      <br/>
      The BHA 26 may include a drill bit 32, a downhole motor 40, one or more drill collars 28, an azimuthally tunable resistivity tool 50 mounted on collar section 55 as described in detail below, LWD sensors positioned in a collar section 55, directional MWD sensors located in a non-magnetic section 60, and one or more stabilizer(s) (not shown) for penetrating through earth formations to create the borehole 18.
      <br/>
      The drill collars 28, which also may be non-magnetic so as not to interfere with the MWD measurements, are used in accordance with conventional techniques to add weight to the drill bit 32 and to stiffen the BHA 26, thereby enabling the BHA 26 to transmit weight to the drill bit 32 without buckling.
      <br/>
      The weight applied through the drill collars 28 to the bit 32 permits the drill bit to penetrate underground formations.
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      The coil tubing 24 is forced into the borehole 18 by a tubing injector 13.
      <br/>
      Tubing injector 13 typically consists of an opposed pair of endless chains configured to grip the tubing.
      <br/>
      The chains may be driven in either direction to inject or withdraw the tubing from the borehole.
    </p>
    <p num="20">
      As the drill bit 32 operates, drilling fluid or mud is pumped from a mud pit 34 at the surface through the hose 37, into the tubing 24, and to the drill bit 32.
      <br/>
      After flowing through the drill bit 32, the drilling mud rises back to the surface through the annular area between the tubing 24 and the borehole 18, where it is collected and returned to the mud pit 34 for filtering.
      <br/>
      The drilling mud is used to lubricate and cool the drill bit 32 and to remove cuttings from the borehole 18.
      <br/>
      The drilling mud may also perform a number of other functions, which could include providing operating power to the downhole motor or other components downhole.
      <br/>
      As one skilled in the art will realize, the downhole motor or turbine 40 may be used downhole to rotate the drill bit 32.
    </p>
    <p num="21">
      As shown in FIG. 1, BHA 26 is defined as all of the downhole components from the top of the drill collars 28, down to the drill bit 32, including downhole motor 40.
      <br/>
      In the preferred embodiment, the BHA 26 preferably includes a measurement while drilling system, referred to herein as an "MWD system".
    </p>
    <p num="22">
      As is known in the art, an MWD system 60 typically includes directional MWD sensors and drilling parameter sensors such as weight-on-bit (WOB), torque-on-bit (TOB), shock, vibration, etc.
      <br/>
      In the preferred embodiment, directional sensors are provided in the BHA 26 to indicate the inclination angle, the horizontal angle, and the rotational angle (a.k.a. "tool face angle") of the BHA 26.
      <br/>
      As is commonly defined in the art, the inclination angle is the deviation from vertically downward, the horizontal angle is the angle in a horizontal plane from true North, and the tool face angle is the orientation (rotational about the tool axis) angle from the high side of the wellbore.
      <br/>
      In accordance with known techniques, wellbore directional measurements can be made as follows: a three axis accelerometer measures the earth's gravitational field vector relative to the tool axis and a point on the circumference of the tool called the "tool face scribe line". (The tool face scribe line is typically drawn on the tool surface as a line parallel to the tool axis.) From this measurement, the inclination and tool face angle of the BHA can be determined.
      <br/>
      Additionally, a three axis magnetometer measures the earth's magnetic field vector in a similar manner.
      <br/>
      From the combined magnetometer and accelerometer data, the horizontal angle of the BHA may be determined.
    </p>
    <p num="23">
      The LWD tool 50 preferably is located close to the drill bit 32 to facilitate the ability to examine the formation as close to the bit as possible.
      <br/>
      As one skilled in the art will understand, the LWD tool 50 could also be located further up the BHA 26 from the drill bit 32 without departing from the principles of the present invention.
      <br/>
      Moreover, the LWD tool 50 may in actuality comprise multiple collar sections for housing various LWD sensors.
      <br/>
      The LWD formation sensors preferably include the present azimuthally tunable resistivity sensor, as well as gamma, sonic, density and neutron sensors in accordance with normal industry practice.
      <br/>
      See generally "State of the Art in MWD", International MWD Society (Jan. 19, 1993).
      <br/>
      A battery pack or other power source may be included in the LWD tool 50, or alternatively may be positioned in any convenient location to provide power to the various electrical assemblies in the BHA.

      Still referring to FIG. 1, downhole data signaling unit 35 is preferably provided as part of BHA 26 and is used to transmit sensed values to a surface receiver via a mud pulse acoustic signal.
      <br/>
      The drilling mud serves as a communication medium between the controller and components at the surface of the well.
      <br/>
      By altering the flow of the drilling mud through the interior of the drillstring, pressure pulses may be generated, in the form of acoustic signals, in the column of drilling mud.
      <br/>
      By selectively varying the pressure pulses through the use of a mud pulser in the mud signaling unit 35, encoded binary pressure pulse signals can be generated to carry information indicative of downhole parameters to the surface for immediate analysis.
      <br/>
      In addition, the downhole system may also include the capability of receiving mud pulse signals from the surface to control the operation or activation of certain MWD sensors or other downhole components.
      <br/>
      The signaling unit 35 in the preferred embodiment comprises a mud pulser unit housed in a non-magnetic sub in accordance with conventional industry practice.

      In accordance with industry practice, the downhole controller may include appropriate data encoding circuitry, such as an encoder, which produces digitally encoded electrical data signals representative of the measurements obtained by the formation sensors and directional sensors.
      <br/>
      In addition, the controller processes the data received from the sensors and produces encoded signals indicative of a portion or all of the received signals for transmission to the surface via a mud pulse signal.

      As disclosed in these inventions, the inclination of the bottomhole assembly can be changed by selectively varying the extension of the stabilizer blades.

      In many cases, the lower end of the borehole is deviated substantially from vertical, as shown in FIG. 1, so as to extend the length of its passage through an oil-bearing formation such as 21.
      <br/>
      Thus, it is desirable to provide a tool capable of detecting and locating bed boundaries such as 23.
      <br/>
      Although in FIG. 1 BHA 26 is deviated approximately 90 degrees from vertical, it will be understood that the present invention can be used to advantage in any similar situation wherein it is desired to locate a bed boundary 23 that is located to one side, rather than ahead, of collar section 55.
    </p>
    <p num="28">
      The various "beds" 20, 21 in the earth have characteristic resistivities which can be used to identify their position.
      <br/>
      For example, in a so-called "shaley-sand" formation, a shale bed may be characterized by a low resistivity of about 1  OMEGA  * m. A bed of oil-saturated sandstone, on the other hand, may be characterized by a higher resistivity of about 10  OMEGA  * m or more.
      <br/>
      The sudden change in resistivity at the boundary between beds of shale and sandstone can be used to locate these boundaries.

      Two types of drill pipe 24 are popular: threaded tubing, and coiled tubing.
      <br/>
      Threaded tubing consists of lengths of pipe with threaded ends which allow the threaded tubing to be coupled together to form the drill string 14.
      <br/>
      Coiled tubing is a long, continuous pipe which is unwound from a spool as it is fed into the well.
      <br/>
      Each type has advantages and disadvantages, but one of the disadvantages of coiled tubing, at least from a logging standpoint, is that coiled tubing is not rotated during drilling operations.
      <br/>
      A logging sensor with azimuthal sensitivity would preferably have an azimuthally "steer-able" sensitivity.
      <br/>
      With threaded tubing, this issue can be resolved by the rotation of the drill string.

      Other means are needed for coiled tubing.

      A variety of tool types are used for measuring resistivity.
      <br/>
      Induction tools are one type of resistivity tool generally known in the art.
      <br/>
      An induction tool comprises a pair of antenna coils, one of which transmits while the other receives.
      <br/>
      Induction tools measure the resistivity of the formation by measuring the current induced in the receiving antenna as a result of magnetic flux caused by current in the emitting antenna.
      <br/>
      Specifically, an alternating current with a known intensity is fed to the emitting coil or antenna.
      <br/>
      Current flow through the emitting coil induces currents in the formation that flow in coaxial loops around the tool.
      <br/>
      These currents in turn induce a signal in the receiving coil.
      <br/>
      This signal induced in the receiving coil can be measured and is generally proportional to the conductivity of the formation.
    </p>
    <p num="31">
      Of similar construction is a second type of resistivity tool called an electromagnetic propagation (EMP) tool.
      <br/>
      These tools operate at much higher frequencies than induction tools (about 106 Hz as compared with about 104 Hz).
      <br/>
      EMP tools use transmitter coils to transmit radio frequency signals into the formation, and use receiver coils to measure the relative amplitude and phase of the signals received by the receivers.
      <br/>
      The attenuation and phase shift of the signals is indicative of the conductivity of the formation.
      <br/>
      Higher frequency signals provide a higher measurement accuracy, but tend to have a reduced investigation depth.
      <br/>
      Consequently, when multiple transmitter coils are present, the transmitter-receiver configuration(s) with a shallower investigation depth may employ a higher frequency (e.g. 2 MHz) for better accuracy, and transmitter-receiver configuration(s) with deeper investigation depths may require a lower frequency (e.g. 0.5 MHz) for adequate performance.

      Referring now to FIG. 2, a resistivity tool subassembly 102 is shown.

      <br/>
      A wire coil 104 is placed in the region 106 and spaced away from the surface of subassembly 102 by a constant distance.
      <br/>
      To mechanically support and protect the coil 104, a non-conductive filler material (not shown) such as epoxy, rubber, or ceramics may be used in the reduced diameter regions 106.
      <br/>
      Coil 104 is a transmitter coil, and coils 110 and 112 are receiving coils.
      <br/>
      In operation, transmitter coil 104 transmits an interrogating electromagnetic signal which propagates through the wellbore and surrounding formation.
      <br/>
      Receiver coils 110, 112 detect the interrogating electromagnetic signal and provide a measure of the electromagnetic signal's amplitude attenuation and phase shift between coils 110 and 112.
      <br/>

    <p num="33">
      Alternatively, if the resistivity is generally known, the amplitude and phase shift information may be used in accordance with conventional techniques to estimate the distance to the nearest boundary layer.

      Advantageously, a second transmitter coil 108 may be added to the subassembly to provide additional resistivity measurements.
      <br/>
      The signal measurements from two (or more) different transmitter-receiver coil spacings provide enough information to determine formation resistivity and the distance to any nearby boundary layer.
      <br/>
      The first transmitter 104 may be spaced approximately 30 inches from the last receiver coil 112.

      The transmitter and receiver coils may comprise as little as one loop of wire, although more loops may provide additional signal power.

      The distance between the coils and the tool surface is preferably in the range from 1/16 inch to 3/4 inch, but may be larger.
    </p>
    <p num="34">

      The wire coils discussed herein are approximately planar, i.e. they reside in a flat plane.
      <br/>
      The orientation of a plane (and hence, the coils) can be described by a vector perpendicular to the plane.
      <br/>
      This perpendicular vector is called a "normal" vector.

      FIG. 3 shows a coil having a normal vector at a skew angle  THETA  from the tool axis and an azimuth angle of  ALPHA .
      <br/>
      The azimuth angle  ALPHA  can be found by projecting the normal vector into a plane perpendicular to the tool axis.

      Non-equally spaced azimuthal angles can also be employed.

      In a homogeneous formation (i.e. no bed boundaries are nearby), S(RZ,TL) and S(RT,TL) equal zero.
      <br/>
      When a nearby bed boundary lies in the  ALPHA =0 direction, S(RT,TL) will be negligible and the amplitude of S(RZ,TL) may be used to estimate the distance to the boundary.
      <br/>
      For other azimuthal angles, the angle a which maximizes the amplitude of
      <br/>
      S(RZ ',TL)=S(RZ,TL) cos  ALPHA +S(RT,TL) sin  ALPHA
    </p>
    <p num="61">
      is the azimuthal direction (with 180 (degree)  ambiguity) of the bed boundary.
      <br/>
      The phase of S(RZ ',TL) can be used to resolve the 180 (degree)  ambiguity, and the maximized magnitude of S(RZ ',TL) may be used to estimate the distance to the bed boundary.
    </p>
    <p num="62">
      Another method for determining the direction of the boundary is to measure the azimuthal resistivities, and then form a direction vector from the measurements.
      <br/>
      The amplitude of signal S(R1,T1) is primarily indicative of the resistivity of the region of the formation between transmitter T1 and receiver R1 in the azimuth  ALPHA =0 direction.
      <br/>
      FIG. 5 shows a first order approximation of the gain patterns for transmitter T1 (210) and receiver R1 (218).
      <br/>
      The shaded overlap region is the region which most affects the resistivity measurement of signal S(R1,T1).
      <br/>
      As one skilled in the art will understand, receiver coil 112 (R4) may be used to determine an attenuation and phase difference if accurate quantitative measurements are desired.
      <br/>
      In other words, the relative amplitude and phase of measured signals S(R4,T1) and S(R1,T1) may be used to form estimates of azimuthal resistivity with better accuracy than may be achieved from S(R1,T1) alone.
    </p>
    <p num="63">
      The amplitude of signal S(R2,T2) is primarily indicative of the formation resistivity in the azimuth  ALPHA =120 (degree)  direction, and the amplitude of signal S(R3,T3) is primarily indicative of the formation resistivity in the azimuth  ALPHA =240 (degree)  direction.
      <br/>
      Azimuthal sensitivities can also be obtained for any azimuthal angle using the virtual response synthesis method.
    </p>
    <p num="64">
      For example, one can construct a virtual transmitter T ALPHA  directed in the azimuthal direction a from the actual transmitters T1, T2, and T3, and can construct a virtual receiver R ALPHA  in the same a azimuthal direction from receivers R1, R2, and R3.
      <br/>
      The amplitude of the synthesized response S(R ALPHA ,T ALPHA ) is then indicative of the resistivity in the desired  ALPHA  direction.
    </p>
    <p num="65">
      One low-complexity way to synthesize a transmitter T ALPHA =60 is to simply add the signals of T1 and T2 together.
      <br/>
      The skew angle  THETA  is changed somewhat, but this effect may be empirically compensated or ignored.
      <br/>
      A virtual receiver R ALPHA =60 can be constructed similarly.
      <br/>
      It can be shown that the signal S(R60,T60) may be expressed:
      <br/>
      S(R60,T60)=S(R1,T1)+S(R1,T2)+S(R2,T1)+S(R2,T2)  (7)

      The S(R180,T180) and S(R300,T300) signals may be similarly expressed:

      <br/>
      S(R300,T300)=S(R1,T1)+S(R1,T3)+S(R3,T. sub.1)+S(R3,T3)  (9)

      As shown in FIG. 6, these equations provide azimuthal resistivity measurements in six equally spaced directions.
      <br/>
      These six measurements can be processed to give a directional vector indicating the direction of a nearby boundary.
      <br/>
      For example:
      <br/>
      Direction=( RHO 0 cos 0 (degree) + RHO 60 cos 60 (degree) + RHO 120 cos 120 (degree) + RHO 180 cos 180 (degree) + RHO 240 cos 240+ RHO 300 cos 300 (degree) )i
      <br/>
      +( RHO 0 sin 0 (degree) + RHO 60 sin 60 (degree) + RHO 120 sin 120 (degree) + RHO 180 sin 180 (degree) + RHO 240 sin 240 (degree) + RHO 300 sin 300 (degree) )j
    </p>
    <p num="68">
      A variety of ways may be used for estimating the distance to the bed boundary.
      <br/>
      For example, the change in apparent resistivity (derived from S(RL,TL)) can be used to estimate the distance.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, the magnitude of the Direction vector defined above can be used to estimate the distance.
    </p>
    <p num="69">
      When the tool includes more than one transmitter to provide multiple transmitter-receiver spacings, the apparent resistivity at various distances from the tool can be measured.
      <br/>
      With reference to FIG. 7, when the tool is nearly parallel to the boundary, the difference in apparent resistivities for the different receiver-transmitter configurations can be used to provide estimates of the distances D1, D2 (and angle of approach) to the bed boundary.
      <br/>
      To increase the reliability of this estimate, the rate of change of the apparent resistivities can be tracked for additional information.

      Analog switch 804 is configured to drive any one of the transmitter coils T1, T2, T3, T4 with a high frequency signal from radio-frequency signal source 806.

      The resistivity tool 202 is assumed to be parallel to the bed boundary, at a depth D, and oriented so that the boundary is in the  ALPHA =0 azimuthal direction.
