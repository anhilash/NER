    <heading>BACKGROUND ART</heading>
    <p num="2">
      Reciprocating piston internal combustion engines include one or more pistons that are reciprocally disposed within corresponding combustion cylinders.
      <br/>
      The pistons are interconnected with each other through the use of a rotatable crankshaft.
      <br/>
      Reciprocation of the pistons causes rotation of the crankshaft.
    </p>
    <p num="3">
      An internal combustion engine utilizes air and fuel to create combustion within the various combustion cylinders.
      <br/>
      Combustion causes movement of the piston within the combustion cylinder which is transferred to the crankshaft and other moving parts of the engine for various purposes.
      <br/>
      The combustion process generates heat that is transferred throughout the engine.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      In order to maintain engine life, it is known to remove as much heat as possible from the engine.
      <br/>
      It is also known that providing cooled intake air will aid in improved efficiency, cleaner combustion and engine cooling.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      However, providing cooled intake air, or cooling of any kind, generally requires at least auxiliary energy and components.
      <br/>
      This solution is not favorable since it adds weight to the system.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      In U.S. Pat. No. 3,439,657 entitled "Cooling Devices for Supercharged Internal Combustion Engines" issued to Gratzmuller on Apr. 22, 1969, there is disclosed a cooling device and process for supercharged internal combustion engines.
      <br/>
      The device and process utilizes the water cooling circuit of the engine.
      <br/>
      The supercharger air inlet is provided with a pair of serially arranged heat-exchangers to lower the temperature of the supercharger air.
      <br/>
      The first heat-exchanger receives cooling liquid from a liquid cooling circuit that includes the water jacket of the engine.
      <br/>
      The second heat-exchanger is located in the air inlet between the engine and the first heat-exchanger and forms the part of a separate liquid cooling circuit provided with a circulation pump and air-cooled radiator.
    </p>
    <p num="7">There is thus the problem of providing cooled intake air for an internal combustion engine without adding appreciable weight or complexity to the system.</p>

    <heading>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading>
    <p num="12">The drawing shows an internal combustion engine in partial sectional view with a diagrammatic representation of heat exchange circuits for the engine in accordance with the principles of the present invention.</p>
    <heading>BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="13">
      Referring now to the drawing, there is shown and embodiment of an internal combustion engine 10 of the present invention.
      <br/>
      Internal combustion engine 10 includes an engine block 14 with a plurality of combustion cylinders of which only one such combustion cylinder 18 is shown.
      <br/>
      Each combustion cylinder reciprocatingly carries a piston of which only one such piston 16 is shown.
      <br/>
      Thus, the following description(s) relating to piston 16 and/or combustion cylinder 18 should be construed to cover the plurality of pistons and combustion cylinders within engine 10.
    </p>
    <p num="14">
      Piston 16 is pivotally coupled to connecting rod 20 and is reciprocal within combustion cylinder 18.
      <br/>
      Connecting rod 20 is coupled to a crankshaft (not shown) for translating the reciprocal piston motion to rotational motion.
      <br/>
      Piston 16 within combustion cylinder 18 defines combustion area 19.
      <br/>
      In communication with combustion area 19 is intake port 56 that is in communication with a typical fuel/air system, and exhaust port 58 that is in communication with various exhaust conduits.
      <br/>
      Fuel injector 60 injects the fuel/air mixture into combustion area 19 as is known in the art, and is compressed by piston 16 once the fuel enters therein via intake port 56.
      <br/>
      Compression of the fuel/air mixture within combustion area 19 by piston 16 creates combustion.
      <br/>
      Combustion gasses exit combustion area 19 via exhaust port 58.
      <br/>
      Engine 10 also includes various filters, conduits for oil, gas, air and the like, and other components that are typical of internal combustion engines.
      <br/>
      Engine 10 preferably includes a plurality of pistons, piston chambers, connecting rods, and intake/exhaust ports, as well as other various components as is typical.
      <br/>
      Various types of internal combustion engines as well as other engine types may utilize the principles of the present invention.
    </p>
    <p num="15">
      Engine 10 includes aftercooler 24 that is in fluid communication with air intake tube 22.
      <br/>
      Hot, compressed gas from the turbocharger (not shown) is received into aftercooler 24 which somewhat cools the compressed gas.
      <br/>
      Fuel for the combustion process within the various combustion cylinders is supplied in addition to the air from aftercooler 24 and intake tube 22.
      <br/>
      The various combustion cylinders are in fluid communication with intake tube 22 as is known in the art.
      <br/>
      Engine 10 also has exhaust output tube, pipe or stack 26 which is in fluid communication with the various combustion cylinders as is known in the art.
      <br/>
      The exhaust gas from the combustion cylinders is externally expelled through and from exhaust tube 26, as indicated by the large, outlined arrow.
      <br/>
      Exhaust tube 26 is made from a thermally conductive material such as metal to allow the heat from the exhaust gas to be conducted thereto.
    </p>
    <p num="16">
      In accordance with an aspect of the present invention, engine 10 includes first thermal exchange circuit 28 and second thermal exchange circuit 30.
      <br/>
      First thermal exchange circuit 28 is a heat transfer circuit that obtains heat through one portion of the circuit, and releases heat in another portion of the circuit.
      <br/>
      This is accomplished through a thermal transfer agent disposed within heat transfer circuit 28.
      <br/>
      Second thermal exchange circuit 30 is a cooling circuit that obtains heat through one portion of the circuit, and releases heat in another portion of the circuit.
      <br/>
      A gaseous transform agent is disposed within cooling circuit 30 which is caused to undergo a state change to create cooling.
    </p>
    <p num="17">
      Heat transfer circuit 28 is characterized by thermally conducting tube or conduit 32 in which is disposed a heat exchange/transfer agent that is capable of obtaining, carrying, and releasing heat.
      <br/>
      The exchange agent may be a liquid that remains a liquid in normal ambient temperatures to temperatures ranging from 600 (degree)  to 700 (degree)  C., such as, preferably ammonia (NH4).
      <br/>
      Tube 32 may be formed from any suitable thermally conducting metal or other type of suitable thermally conducting material.
      <br/>
      Conduit 32 includes heat obtaining portion or coil section 34 that is coiled or wrapped around exhaust stack 26.
      <br/>
      Coil section 34 is in a thermal relationship with exhaust stack 26 such that heat absorbed by exhaust stack 26 is conducted to coil section 34.
      <br/>
      Generally, the closer that coil 34 is to exhaust stack 26, the greater the heat exchange that takes place from exhaust stack to coil 34.
      <br/>
      Preferably, insulation 36 surrounds coil section 34 to aid in the transfer of heat emanating from exhaust stack to coil 34.
      <br/>
      As well, coil 34 conducts the heat it receives to the heat transfer agent disposed within circuit 28.
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      First thermal exchange circuit 28 also includes first one-way valve 38 and second one-way valve 40 with thermal exchange portion or heat conduction section 42 disposed therebetween.
      <br/>
      Heat conduction section 42 is shown as a straight section of tube, but may be any configuration to allow efficient heat conduction from the transfer agent within circuit 28 to the heat conduction area 42 defined by the particular heat conduction section.
      <br/>
      Also, while two one-way valves 38 and 40 are shown in the drawings, it should be understood that only one one-way valve may be sufficient.
      <br/>
      Further, more than two one-way valves may be used depending on the desired characteristics of heat exchange circuit 28.
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      Cooling circuit 30 is characterized by thermally conducting tube or conduit 44 in which is disposed a cooling or refrigerant agent that is capable of utilizing heat and pressure to produce cold.
      <br/>
      Such a cooling agent may be freon.
      <br/>
      Conduit 44 may be formed from any suitable thermally conducting metal or other type of suitable thermally conducting material that can also withstand pressures associated with liquid and gaseous freon.
      <br/>
      Conduit 44 includes coil section 46 that is coiled or wrapped around intake tube 22.
      <br/>
      Preferably, insulation 48 surrounds coil section 46 to aid in the retention of cold emanating from coil section 46.
      <br/>
      Cooling circuit 30 also includes one-way valve 50 and restriction/aperture/orifice 54 with thermal exchange portion 52 disposed therebetween.
      <br/>
      While only one one-way valve is shown and is sufficient in second thermal exchange circuit 30, it should be understood that several one-way valves may be used.
      <br/>
      It should also be understood that the terms "first" and "second" with respect to the thermal exchange circuits, as well as the one-way valves is only a matter of choice in distinguishing one thermal exchange circuit from the other.
    </p>
    <p num="20">
      Thermal exchange portion 42 of heat transfer circuit 28 is thermally coupled to thermal exchange portion 52 of cooling circuit 30 in a manner to obtain the best thermal exchange or heat conduction therebetween.
      <br/>
      Such thermal coupling may include the welding of tube portions 42 and 52 together, and/or maintaining them in abutting relationship.
      <br/>
      Further, thermal exchange portions 42 and 52 may take other shapes and forms in order to achieve the most efficient thermal exchange between the two circuits.
    </p>
    <p num="21">
      Heat transfer circuit 28 receives heat from exhaust stack 26 that is transferred to second thermal exchange or cooling circuit 30 through exchange portions 42 and 52.
      <br/>
      Cooling circuit 30 uses the heat from heat transfer circuit 28 to produce cooling in cooling circuit 30.
      <br/>
      The cooling may be used for a variety of cooling applications.
    </p>
    <p num="22">
      Specifically, and with reference to heat transfer circuit 28, as exhaust stack 26 gains heat by conduction from the exhaust gas flowing therethrough, coil section 34 gains heat by conduction from exhaust stack 26.
      <br/>
      The heat transfer agent within tube 32 gains heat by conduction from coil section 34.
      <br/>
      Heat imparted to the transfer agent within the closed heat transfer circuit 28 causes the heat transfer agent therein to expand and thus create motion or circulation.
      <br/>
      One-way valves 38 and 40 cause the circulation to flow in one direction as indicated by arrows 64, 66, and 68.
      <br/>
      At the area around arrows 64 and 66, the transfer agent has its maximum heat capacity.
      <br/>
      After flowing through tube portion or heat transfer area 42 the heated transfer agent conducts heat to tube portion or heat obtaining area 52 and thus has it minimum heat capacity around arrow 68.
    </p>
    <p num="23">
      With reference to cooling circuit 30, the gaseous cooling agent within tube 44 and around the area of arrow 72 obtains heat by conduction from tube portion 42.
      <br/>
      The addition of heat causes expansion in the cooling agent thereby creating motion or circulation that is controlled in flow direction 70 by one-way valve 50.
      <br/>
      As the heated cooling agent, in gaseous form, encounters restriction 54 there is an increase in pressure.
      <br/>
      The increased pressure causes the cooling gaseous agent to become a liquid.
      <br/>
      After the now liquid cooling agent flows through restriction 54, immediate expansion takes place, and the liquid cooling agent becomes a gas cooling agent absorbing heat and producing cooling within coil section 46.
      <br/>
      Thereafter, the gaseous cooling agent flows as per arrow 70.
    </p>
    <heading>INDUSTRIAL APPLICABILITY</heading>
    <p num="24">
      During operation of internal combustion engine 10, heat from combustion gasses expelled or exhausted from combustion cylinders 18 and directed out of exhaust pipe 26 heats up exhaust pipe 26 to temperatures around 600 (degree) -700 (degree)  C. Coil section 34, being in thermal exchange relationship with exhaust pipe 26 becomes heated through conduction.
      <br/>
      The liquid ammonia within heat transfer circuit 28 is likewise conductively heated by coil section 34.
      <br/>
      Heat imparted to the ammonia causes expansion and motion of the ammonia, which tries to circulate within the circuit.
      <br/>
      One-way valves 38 and 40, however, permit the circulation to flow in only one direction as indicated by the arrows.
      <br/>
      The liquid ammonia within first thermal exchange circuit 28 thus utilizes heat generated by the engine during operation for its operation.
      <br/>
      No additional energy is required.
    </p>
    <p num="25">
      Tube portion 42 is in thermal exchange relationship with tube portion 52 of cooling circuit 30.
      <br/>
      As tube portion 52 heats up from conduction by tube portion 42, the gaseous freon begins to expand and circulate within the circuit.
      <br/>
      The circulating freon flows in only one direction as indicated by the arrows because of one-way valve 50.
      <br/>
      As the heated freon flows through aperture or orifice 54, the pressure and temperature of the freon drop such that the temperature is between 20 (degree) -40 (degree)  C. below zero (-20 (degree)  to -40 (degree)  C.).
      <br/>
      The cooled freon gas then circulates through coil 46 or other network of tubes and/or coils to provide cooling through conduction.
      <br/>
      The present dual heat transfer or thermal exchange cycle linked by a heat exchanger within the internal combustion engine, continues to produce cooling without additional energy input.
    </p>
    <p num="26">
      Coil 46 may be placed in the engine oil cooler to aid in cooling the engine oil.
      <br/>
      As well, coil 46 could pass through the hydraulic oil line to aid in cooling the hydraulic oil therein.
      <br/>
      In another instance, coil 46 may consist of a series or network of tubes enclosed in an insulated container.
      <br/>
      Air passages at either end of the insulated container allow for a flow of air through the container which blow over the coil or network of tubes which cools the flowing air.
      <br/>
      A fan or blower at one air passage forces the air through the insulated container which exits the other air passage to provide cooled air such as in air conditioning.
      <br/>
      In this case, however, no additional fuel is spent in providing cooled air above that which is used by the engine.
      <br/>
      Only a small amount of electricity is expended by the fan.
    </p>
    <p num="27">It is an advantage of the present invention that cooler combustion air is provided to the air intake of an internal combustion engine.</p>
