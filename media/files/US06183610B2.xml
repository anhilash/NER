      In the conventional updraft flow apparatuses for composite plating the inner surface of a cylindrical body, the maximum current density is practically restricted to about 20 A/dm2 because circumferential distribution of the flow velocity of the composite plating liquid in the annular space is uneven and the increase of the current density causes defects in appearance, such as burning, rough deposits, lack of plating, flaking, flowering, etc.
      <br/>
      Thus, the productivity of the composite plating work with the conventional updraft flow apparatuses for composite plating the inner surface of a cylindrical body is low.

    <p num="35">
      Electric power is applied between the soluble positive electrode 9 and the works 100.
      <br/>
      Fine metal particles deposit from the composite plating liquid containing metallic ions on the inner surface of the works 100.
      <br/>
      Thus, metal layers are formed on the inner surfaces of the works 100.
      <br/>
      Fine particles of antiabrasion materials, lubricants, etc. dispersed in the composite plating liquid are confined between the metal particles depositing on the inner surface of the works 100 to be dispersed in the metal layers.
      <br/>
      Thus, composite plating layers are formed on the inner surfaces of the works 100.
      <br/>
      Metallic ions are supplied to the composite plating liquid from the soluble positive electrode 9 to replenish the composite plating liquid with the consumed metallic ions.

    <p num="40">The composite plating procedure is continued for a predetermined time, while the circulation of the composite plating liquid is continued, thereby forming composite plating layers of desired thickness on the inner surfaces of the works 100.</p>
    <p num="41">A plurality of sets of works 100 set on a plurality of openings 2a are simultaneously supplied with the composite plating liquid to be simultaneously composite plated.</p>
    <p num="42">After the continuation of the composite plating procedure for a predetermined time, the rod body 8 is drawn upward out of the third work fixing jig 4c, the third work fixing jig 4c and the tie-rods 6 are taken away, and the works 100 are detached from the second work fixing jig 4b.</p>

      In the present apparatus for composite plating the inner surface of a cylindrical body, the composite plating liquid flowing upward out of the annular space between the soluble positive electrode 9 and the second rectification cylinder 5b collides with the baffle plate 7.
      <br/>
      If the circumferential distribution of the flow velocity of the composite plating liquid in the annular space between the soluble positive electrode 9 and the second rectification cylinder 5b is uneven, the circumferential distribution of the static pressure of the composite plating liquid generated by the collision of the composite plating liquid flowing upward out of the annular space with the baffle plate 7 becomes uneven.
      <br/>
      That is, large static pressure is generated in the circumferential portion where the flow velocity is large, while small static pressure is generated in the circumferential portion where the flow velocity is small.
      <br/>
      Thus, the flow resistance increases in the circumferential portion where the flow velocity is large to decrease the flow velocity, while flow resistance decreases in the circumferential portion where the flow velocity is small to increase the flow velocity.
      <br/>
      Thus, the circumferential distribution of the flow velocity of the composite plating liquid in the annular space between the soluble positive electrode 9 and the second rectification cylinder 5b is evened, and the circumferential distribution of the flow velocity of the composite plating liquid in the annular space between the soluble positive electrode 9 and the inner surface of the works 100 is evened.
    </p>
    <p num="45">
      In the present apparatus for composite plating the inner surface of a cylindrical body, no appearance defect is caused by an increase of the current density beyond the maximum allowable current density in the conventional apparatuses because the circumferential distribution of the flow velocity of the composite plating liquid in the annular space between the soluble positive electrode 9 and the inner surface of the works 100 is even.
      <br/>
      Thus, the present apparatus for composite plating the inner surface of a cylindrical body can achieve higher productivity of the composite plating work than conventional updraft flow apparatuses for composite plating the inner surface of a cylindrical body.
    </p>
    <p num="46">
      In the present apparatus for composite plating, the inner surface of a cylindrical body, the first rectification cylinder 5a and the second rectification cylinder 5b are disposed to provide the annular space between the soluble positive electrode 9 and the works 100 with the same annular spaces at its entrance and at its exit, thereby restricting abrupt change of the shape of the flow channel at the entrance and the exit of the annular space between the soluble positive electrode 9 and the works 100.
      <br/>
      Thus, the flow of the composite plating liquid in the annular space between the soluble positive electrode 9 and the works 100 is stabilized and the generation of turbulence in the flow of the composite plating liquid is suppressed.
      <br/>
      Thus, the circumferential distribution of the flow velocity of the composite plating liquid in the annular space between the soluble positive electrode 9 and the works 100 is evened, current density can be increased beyond the maximum allowable current density in the conventional apparatuses, and the productivity of the composite plating work is increased.
    </p>
    <p num="47">The lengths of the first rectification cylinder 5a and the second rectification cylinder 5b are desirably equal to or larger than the outside diameter of the annular space between the soluble positive electrode 9 and the inner surface of the works 100 to sufficiently stabilize the flow of the composite plating liquid.</p>
    <p num="48">
      In the present apparatus for composite plating the inner surface of a cylindrical body, the flow rate adjusting tank 3 is disposed below the works 100, the flow rate adjusting tank 3 is provided with the opening 2a opposing the lower end of the annular space between the soluble positive electrode 9 and the inner surface of the works 100, and the composite plating liquid is made to flow from the flow rate adjusting tank 3 into the annular space through the opening 2a.
      <br/>
      The composite plating liquid force fed by the pump 13 does not directly flow into the annular space from the conduit 12 but first flows into the flow rate adjusting tank 3 to be made free from drift current in the flow rate adjusting tank 3, then flows into the annular space.
      <br/>
      Thus, the flow of the composite plating liquid in the annular space between the soluble positive electrode 9 and the inner surface of the works 100 is stabilized and the generation of turbulence in the flow of the composite plating liquid is suppressed.
      <br/>
      Thus, the circumferential distribution of the flow velocity of the composite plating liquid in the annular space between the soluble positive electrode 9 and the inner surface of the works 100 is evened, current density can be increased beyond the maximum allowable current density in the conventional apparatuses, and the productivity of the composite plating work is increased.

    <p num="49">
      In the present apparatus for composite plating the inner surface of a cylindrical body, the composite plating liquid is supplied to a plurality sets of the works 100 from the single flow rate adjusting tank 3 to composite plate the plurality sets of the works 100 simultaneously.
      <br/>
      Thus, the productivity of the composite plating work is increased.
    </p>
    <p num="50">
      In the present apparatus for composite plating the inner surface of a cylindrical body, the composite plating liquid flowing in the annular space between the soluble positive electrode 9 and the works 100 can leak through the ports 100a extending from the inner surface to the outside of the works 100 and the composite plating liquid discharging holes 4b1, 4c1 formed in the second work fixing jig 4b and the third work fixing jig 4c.
      <br/>
      Thus, detergent, pre-treatment liquid, etc. remaining in the ports 100a are discharged from the ports 100a with the leaking composite plating liquid.
      <br/>
      Thus, detergent, pre-treatment liquid, etc. remaining in the ports 100a do not mix with the composite plating liquid flowing in the annular space between the soluble positive electrode 9 and the works 100 to pollute it.

    <p num="51">
      In the present apparatus for composite plating the inner surface of a cylindrical body, the composite plating liquid colliding with the baffle plate 7 scatters into the space around the works 100 from the periphery of the baffle plate 7.
      <br/>
      Thus, the setting procedure of the works 100 on the apparatus for composite plating becomes easier than that in the case where the composite plating liquid colliding with the baffle plate 7 is recovered through a closed-circuit pipe and returned to the annular space between the soluble positive electrode 9 and the inner surface of the works 100.

      In the present apparatus for composite plating the inner surface of a cylindrical body, the peripheral portion of the baffle plate 7 is bent downward to scatter the composite plating liquid colliding with the baffle plate 7 obliquely downwardly from the periphery of the baffle plate 7.
