      A heat transfer device comprises a heat conductive base, first and second cylindrical chambers defined in the heat conductive base and parallel to each other, a first heat conduction pipe fixed within the first cylindrical chamber, a second heat conduction pipe pivotally received in the second cylindrical chamber, and a sealing mechanism.
      <br/>
      One end of the first heat conduction pipe is secured within the first cylindrical chamber, while the other end thereof is attached to a heat-generating electrical element for absorbing heat produced by the electrical element and then transmitting the absorbed heat to the heat conductive base.
      <br/>
      One end of the second heat conduction pipe is pivotally mounted within the second cylindrical chamber, while the other end thereof is connected to a monitor panel of the Notebook computer for dissipating the heat transmitted by the heat conductive base to the exterior of the Notebook computer via the monitor panel.
      <br/>
      A heat-conductive lubricant surrounds the end of the second heat conduction pipe within the second cylindrical chamber thereby providing heat conduction and lubrication between the pipe and the chamber.

    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="1">The present invention relates to a heat transfer device, and particularly to a heat transfer device which is pivotally assembled in a Notebook type computer for transmitting heat produced by the CPU of the Notebook type computer to the monitor thereof.</p>
    <heading>PRIOR ART DESCRIPTION</heading>
    <p num="2">
      As the computing speed and the power capacity of electrical chips increases, the heat produced by the electrical chips increases.
      <br/>
      Heat transfer devices directly mounted to the surface of an electrical chip are commonly used for dissipating heat produced, thereby keeping the temperature of the chip within its operating range. U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,615,735; 5,537,343 and 5,541,811 disclose heat transfer devices which are directly attached on a mother board.
      <br/>
      Such heat transmitting elements dissipate the heat produced by an electrical chip, such as a central processing unit (CPU), mounted on the mother board, through heat conductive fin-like members.
      <br/>
      However, in practice, such heat transmitting elements are not efficient and can not meet increasingly higher requirements for dissipating heat.
    </p>
    <p num="3">
      U.S. Pat. No. 5,690,468 discloses another type of heat transfer device.
      <br/>
      This heat transfer device comprises a heat dissipating portion, a heat conduction pipe and a fan.
      <br/>
      The heat dissipating portion includes a rectangular base and a plurality of heat dissipating fins integrally extending upward from an upper surface of the base.
      <br/>
      The bottom surface of the base is closely attached to an electrical chip.
      <br/>
      The fan is mounted in the center of the upper surface of the base.
      <br/>
      The heat conduction pipes are fixed among heat dissipating fins formed on a lateral side of the base.
      <br/>
      This kind of heat transfer device is superior in heat dissipating efficiency.
      <br/>
      However, since a Notebook computer is strictly limited by a height requirement, this kind of heat transfer device is not suitable for use in a Notebook computer because of the device's bulky body.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      Furthermore, the prior art heat transfer devices discussed above all dissipate heat through the Notebook computer's mother board, on which the electrical chips are mounted.
      <br/>
      For a Notebook computer user, this can be painful and unsustainable if the user operates the Notebook computer from his/her lap.

      FIG. 1 is a cross-sectional view of a heat transfer device in accordance with the present invention; and
      <br/>
      FIG. 2 is a perspective view of the heat transfer device of FIG. 1.

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="11">Referring to FIGS. 1 and 2, a pivotable heat transfer device 1 in accordance with the present invention comprises a heat conductive base 10, first and second heat conduction pipes 20, 30 mounted to the heat conductive base 10, and a sealing mechanism 40 mounted on the heat conductive base 10.</p>
    <p num="12">
      The heat conductive base 10 includes upper and lower members 18, 16 aligning with each other in a vertical overlapping relationship.
      <br/>
      The upper and lower members 18 and 16 are glued together using a heat conductive adhesive 50.
      <br/>
      A first cylindrical chamber 12 is defined in the lower member 16 for securely receiving one end "A" of the first heat conduction pipe 20 therein.
      <br/>
      A second cylindrical chamber 14 is defined in the upper member 18 and parallel to the first cylindrical chamber 12 for receiving one end of the second heat conduction pipe 30.
      <br/>
      The first and second chambers 12, 14 have first and second openings 140, 141 at opposite sides of the base 10, respectively.
      <br/>
      A step 142 is formed in the second chamber 14 near the second opening 141.
      <br/>
      A few screw threads are formed in the inner surface of the second chamber 14 near the second opening 141.
      <br/>
      The lower member 16 forms a pair of laterally extending wing plates 162.
      <br/>
      A pair of screw holes 164 is defined in opposite corners of each wing plate 162 for securing the base 10 onto a mother board (not shown) via corresponding bolts 60.
    </p>
    <p num="13">
      The end "A" of the first heat conduction pipe 20 is fixed within the first chamber 12 of the base 10, while the other end "B" of the first heat conduction pipe 20 is connected to a corresponding electrical element (not shown), such as a central processing unit (CPU), for transmitting the heat produced by the CPU to the heat conductive base 10.
      <br/>
      The end "A" of the first heat conduction pipe 20 is perpendicular to the end "B".
      <br/>
      One end "C" of the second heat conduction pipe 30 is pivotally received within the second chamber 14 of the base 10, while the other end "D" thereof is connected to a monitor panel (not shown) of the Notebook computer for transmitting the heat absorbed from the heat conductive base 10 to the exterior of the Notebook via the monitor panel.
    </p>
    <p num="14">
      A heat-conductive lubricant 70 surrounds the end "C" of the second heat conduction pipe 30 in the second cylindrical chamber 14 thereby providing heat conduction and lubrication between the second heat conduction pipe 30 and the second chamber 14.
      <br/>
      The sealing mechanism 40 is secured in the second opening 141 of the second chamber 14 of the base 10 thereby sealing the lubricant 70 within the second chamber 14.
      <br/>
      The sealing mechanism 40 comprises a sealing ring 42 and a threaded plug 44.
      <br/>
      The threaded plug 44 could also be replaced with a rubber plug and other suitable members to seal the second chamber 14.
      <br/>
      The sealing ring 42 is positioned to abut against the step 142 of the second chamber 14.
      <br/>
      The threaded plug 44 is screwed into the second opening 141 via the screw threads 144, while the second heat conduction pipe 30 extends through the sealing ring 42 and an aperture 442 defined in the threaded plug 44.
      <br/>
      Thus, the sealing mechanism 40 effectively seals the lubricant 70 within the second chamber 14, and the second heat conduction pipe 30 can still move pivotally with the end "C" thereof received in the second chamber 14 and extending through the sealing mechanism 40.
    </p>
    <p num="15">
      Therefore, when the heat transfer device 1 is positioned in the Notebook computer, the end "B" of the first heat transmitting pipe 20 is attached to a heat-generating electrical element, for example, the CPU, to absorb the heat produced by the element and to simultaneously transmit the absorbed heat to the heat conductive base 10 via the other end "A" secured within the lower member 16.
      <br/>
      The lower member 16 then conducts the absorbed heat to the upper member 18 through the conductive adhesive 50.
      <br/>
      The end "C" of the second heat conduction pipe 30 then absorbs the heat from the upper member 18 via the heat conductive lubricant 70 and conducts it to the other end "D" thereof.
      <br/>
      The heat is then dissipated to the exterior of the Notebook via heat exchanges between the end "D" of the second heat conduction pipe 30 and the monitor panel of the Notebook computer.
      <br/>
      It should be noted that all materials used in the heat transfer device 1 are made of heat conductive materials, thereby ensuring efficient heat dissipation therethrough.
