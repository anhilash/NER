      The trailer wheels have pivotal attachment to the trailer and are pivotal for steering with a steering shaft (4) that is length-controllable intermediate rigid positioning on the chassis and a steering arm (6) attached to a steering rod (7) that is connected to a pivotal attachment of the trailer wheels to the chassis.
      <br/>
      Separately and optionally from being pivotal on the pivotal towing attachment by wheel-following of the trailer wheels, the chassis is pivotal on the pivotal towing attachment with a positioning shaft (8) that is length controllable intermediate rigid positioning on the chassis and a rigid lateral attachment (5, 9) to the towing vehicle.
      <br/>
      Length changes of the steering shaft steer the trailer wheels to guide the rear portion of the trailer from-side-to-side for selective turn-positioning of the trailer wheels.
      <br/>
      Length changes of the positioning shaft position the trailer laterally from-side-to-side for selectively side-towing of the trailer.
      <br/>
      Length changes of the steering shaft and the positioning shaft are controllable from a remote position with hydraulic-cylinder motors (39), electrical motors (41) and/or mechanical linkages.

      Field of the Invention.
    </p>
    <p num="2">This invention relates to steering of machinery trailers and dollies having wheels that are relatively far behind wheels of a towing vehicle.</p>
    <p num="3">2. Relation To Prior Art.</p>
    <p num="4">
      Wheels of machinery trailers that are relatively far behind wheels of a towing vehicle take shortcuts instead of following behind or where desired on turns.
      <br/>
      Typical are wheels of tandem rake dollies that bypass hay on turns, highway-trailer wheels that run over curbs and industrial dollies that hit corner stacks and structures when their wheels take shorter distances than those of towing vehicles such as various types of tractors and trucks.
    </p>
    <p num="5">There are known trailer-steering means, but none that allow turn-positioning with controllable motors in a manner taught by this invention.</p>
    <p num="6">Examples of different but related devices for steering trailing vehicles are described in the following patent documents. U.S. Pat. No. 5,412,929, issued to Urbain et al, described a tandem implement hitch having a hydraulic cylinder expandable between pivotal arms of wheel-turning rods. U.S. Pat. No. 5,404,702, issued to Lewis, described a windrow apparatus for guiding hay into a hay bailer from opposite sides. U.S. Pat. No. 4,166,352, issued to Knusting, described a hay-making machine that was adjustable to land irregularities but not to turns. U.S. Pat. No. 5,231,829, issued to Tonutti, described a rake trolley with width adjustment but not wheel-following turn adjustment. U.S. Pat. No. 5,025,616, issued to Moss, described a side arm for towing a second rake beside and behind a first rake towed by a tractor. U.S. Pat. No. 4,977,734, issued to Rowe et al, described a hydraulically foldable hay rake.</p>
    <p num="7">Problems with trailing of wheels of agricultural and industrial trailers and dollies continue to exist.</p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="8">In light of these problems, objects of patentable novelty and utility taught by this invention are to provide a steerable machinery trailer which:</p>
    <p num="9">
      Provides selective steering of rear wheels of a trailer from a driver position of a vehicle towing the trailer; and
      <br/>
      Provides selectively lateral following of wheels of a trailer behind either side of a towing vehicle.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      This invention accomplishes these and other objectives with a steerable machinery trailer having a chassis intermediate a pivotal towing attachment and trailer wheels proximate a rear portion of the chassis.
      <br/>
      The trailer wheels have pivotal attachment to the trailer and are pivotal for steering with a steering shaft that is length-controllable intermediate rigid positioning on the chassis and a steering arm attached to a steering rod that is connected to a pivotal attachment of the trailer wheels to the chassis.
      <br/>
      Separately and optionally from being pivotal on the pivotal towing attachment by wheel-following of the trailer wheels, the chassis is pivotal on the pivotal towing attachment with a positioning shaft that is length controllable intermediate rigid positioning on the chassis and a rigid lateral attachment to the towing vehicle.
      <br/>
      Length changes of the steering shaft steer the trailer wheels to guide the rear portion of the trailer from-side-to-side for selective turn-positioning of the trailer wheels.
      <br/>
      Length changes of the positioning shaft position the trailer laterally from-side-to-side for selectively side-towing of the trailer.
      <br/>
      Length changes of the steering shaft and the positioning shaft are controllable from a remote position with fluid motors, electrical motors and/or mechanical linkages,

    <p num="14">
      Referring first to FIG. 1, a steerable machinery trailer 1 with a chassis such as a single-rod chassis 2 has a pivotal towing attachment proximate a front portion of the chassis and has trailer wheels 3 with a steering-pivotal attachment to a rear portion of the chassis.
      <br/>
      A steering shaft 4 is extension-length controllable intermediate a first chassis position 5 and a steering arm 6 that is attached to a steering rod 7 that has steering-pivotal attached to axles on which the trailer wheels 3 rotate.
      <br/>
      A positioning shaft 8 is extension-length controllable intermediate a second chassis position 9 and a positioning arm 10 that is extended laterally from a tow pin 11 that is attachable non-rotatably to a towing vehicle such as a tractor 12.
      <br/>
      The front portion of the chassis such as the single-rod chassis 2 is attached rigidly to a tow sleeve 13 that pivots on the tow pin 11.
    </p>
    <p num="15">
      Extension-length control of the steering shaft 4 and the positioning shaft 8 have contrasting effects because the steering rod 7 is rotatable in a steering sleeve 14 and the tow pin 11 is non-rotatable in the tow sleeve 13.
      <br/>
      Extension-length control of the steering shaft 4 pivots the steering rod 7 and the trailer wheels 3 while extension-length control of the positioning shaft 8 pivots the tow sleeve 13 and the chassis.
    </p>
    <p num="16">
      Referring to FIGS. 1-2 and 26-28, the steering rod 7 has steering-pivotal attachment to trailer-wheel axles that can be either rigid-axle extensions 15 from opposite ends of a pivotal axle beam 16 as depicted in FIGS. 1 and 26 or pivotal-axle extensions 17 from opposite ends of a rigid axle beam 18 as depicted in FIGS. 2 and 27-28.
      <br/>
      The steering rod 7 pivots in the steering sleeve 14 in response to pivotal travel of the steering arm 6 from length changes of the steering shaft 4.
    </p>
    <p num="17">
      The steering sleeve 14 extends downward to an axle sleeve 19 for turning the pivotal axle beam 16.
      <br/>
      The steering sleeve 14 extends to the rigid axle beam 18 for turning the pivotal-axle extensions 17 with a tie rod 20 that is actuated by an actuator 21 extended between a bottom end of the steering rod 7 and a suitable connection of the actuator 21 to the tie rod 20 in accordance with known steering technology.
      <br/>
      The actuator 21 with a bifurcated connection as depicted in FIGS. 27-28 also can be used.
      <br/>
      The tie rod 20 is attached pivotally to axle arms 22 that are attached to the pivotal-axle extensions 17.
    </p>
    <p num="18">A chassis machinery hitch 23 is positioned on an aft side of the pivotal axle beam 15 and on the aft side of the rigid axle beam 17 for applications that require towing additional machinery.</p>
    <p num="19">
      Referring to FIGS. 1-2 and 20-25, a single-rod chassis 2 can have angle rods 24 and chassis gussets 25 with which it is attached to the tow sleeve 13 which pivots on the tow pin 11.
      <br/>
      At a top of the tow pin 11, the positioning arm 10 is attached rigidly for pivotal positioning of the single-rod chassis 2 with length-changing of the positioning shaft 8 in opposition to non-rotational rigidity of the tow pin 11.
    </p>
    <p num="20">
      Non-rotational rigidity of the tow pin 11 is provided by non-rotational attachment of the tow pin 11 to a towing vehicle such as a tractor 12.
      <br/>
      Non-rotational attachment to the towing vehicle is accomplished with a three-point hitch 26 or an equivalently rigid attachment.
      <br/>
      Preferably, the three-point hitch 26 or its equivalent has a hitch sleeve 27 with which it is rotatable between a use position forward and a non-use position rearward as depicted in FIGS. 20 and 22. A non-use position rearward is indicated by dashed lines.
      <br/>
      The three-point hitch 26 can be locked in use or non-use positions by a locking means such as a hitch-lock pin 28 that extends through the hitch sleeve 27 and the tow pin 11.
    </p>
    <p num="21">
      The purpose of rotation of the three-point hitch 26 or its equivalent is for applications of this steerable machinery trailer 1 requiring towing by vehicles not having three-point-hitch capability or for uses not requiring side-positioning when only the steering features will be used.
      <br/>
      Rotation of the three-point hitch 26 or its equivalent to a rearward non-use position prevents its obstructive contact with different towing vehicles.
    </p>
    <p num="22">Towing of the single-rod chassis 2 by vehicles without rotationally rigid attachment is accomplished preferably with either a ball hitch 29 as depicted in FIGS. 20 and 23 or an eye hitch 30 on forward portions of hitch plates 31 at a bottom of a tow pin 11 and a tow sleeve 13 as depicted in FIGS. 24-25. The hitch plate 31 is affixed rigidly to the tow pin 11.</p>
    <p num="23">
      Preferably a hitch jack 32 is attached pivotally proximate the hitch plate 31 as depicted in FIGS. 20, 23 and 24-25 to position the three-point hitch 26, the ball hitch 29 and the eye hitch 30 vertically for their attachment to select types of towing vehicles employed.
      <br/>
      The hitch jack 32 is rotatable between a horizontal non-use position depicted in FIGS. 20 and 23 and a use position depicted in FIGS. 24-25. The hitch jack 32 can be sized, shaped and positioned for noninterference with towing vehicles or with vehicles being towed.
    </p>
    <p num="24">
      Referring to FIGS. 1-4, the chassis can be a plural-rod chassis 33 as shown with either a pivotal axle beam 16 in FIG. 3 or a rigid axle beam 18 in FIG. 4.
      <br/>
      A towing vehicle can be either a tractor truck 34 or a tractor 12, described in relation to FIGS. 1-2, for either a plural-rod chassis 33 or a single-rod chassis 2 described in relation to FIGS. 1-2.
    </p>
    <p num="25">
      Referring to FIGS. 1-6, the chassis can be either a high-rod chassis 35 as shown in FIGS. 1-2 and 5 or a low-rod chassis 36 as shown in FIGS. 3-4 and 6 regardless of whether one or a plurality of rods are used for its construction.
      <br/>
      A high-rod chassis 35 supports loads under rods and allows passage of machinery such as finger-wheel rakes 37 from-side-to-side laterally under it.
      <br/>
      A low-rod chassis 36 supports loads such as van 38 on it.
      <br/>
      A low-rod chassis 36 is more likely to have need for only a steering shaft 4 and related steering features, described in relation to FIGS. 1-2, for turn control, while a high-rod chassis 35 is likely to have need for a positioning shaft 8 and related features, described in relation to FIGS. 1-2, for side towing in addition to turn control.
    </p>
    <p num="26">
      Referring to FIG. 7, the steering shaft 4 described in relation to FIGS. 1-2 can be a telescopic rod that is extension-length controllable with a hydraulic-cylinder motor 39 in which fluid is pressured selectively against a piston 40 intermediate a steering-arm 6 portion and a first chassis position 5.
      <br/>
      Similarly, the positioning shaft 8 described in relation to FIGS. 1-2 can be a telescopic rod that is extension-length controllable with a hydraulic-cylinder motor 39 in which fluid is pressured selectively against a piston 40 intermediate a positioning-arm 10 portion and a second chassis position 9.
    </p>
    <p num="27">
      Referring to FIGS. 8-9, the steering shaft 4 and the positioning shaft 8 described in relation to FIGS. 1-2 can be telescopic rods that are extension-length controllable with an electric motor 41 that is rotated selectively in rotation of drive-gear teeth in gearing drive of extension-arm teeth on the telescopic rods.
      <br/>
      The drive-gear teeth can be pinion gearing 42 and the extension-arm teeth can be rack teeth 43 as depicted in FIG. 8.
      <br/>
      Optionally, the drive-gear teeth can be helical gearing 44 and the extension-arm teeth can be helical-screw teeth 45 as depicted in FIG. 9.
    </p>
    <p num="28">
      Referring to FIGS. 10-11, a hydraulic-cylinder motor 39 is preferable for most single-rod chassis 2 for rapid but less accurate steering control.
      <br/>
