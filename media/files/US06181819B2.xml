      In electrophotographic and thermal transfer type recording means, three colors of yellow, magenta and cyan are used for color formation.
      <br/>
      In many recording means, a color material of black color is used to enhance the reproducibility of black.
      <br/>
      For example, it has been provided an appartus wherein if a color of original is judged to be a black, only a black color material is used.
    </p>
    <p num="7">In some prior art image processing apparatuses, spacial frequency characteristics of the original are judged, and the sharpness of recorded image is improved using edge emphasizing or like space filter means such that image areas with sharp image density changes are given sharper image density changes.</p>
    <p num="8">These apparatuses, however, have the following drawbacks.</p>
    <p num="9">
      Usually, for sharply recording edges of characters density changes of the original are extracted.
      <br/>
      Even in this case, erroneous judgement is prone in screen areas of the original, resulting in an unseemly screen reproduction image and in different color shades of edges of color characters from those in the original.
      <br/>
      Further, heretofore, a judgement level for judging character edges in images is fixed absolutely, making it difficult to select an adequate judgement level according to characteristics of a given image.
    </p>
    <p num="10">Further, heretofore character areas and intermedate image areas in a given image are judged as such, and these different areas are processed separately, i.e., the character areas are processed by pure binarization while the intermediate image areas are processed by providing a systematic dither process, for instance, thereby obtaining a satisfactory image.</p>
    <p num="11">Even this prior art method, however, still requires great improvement in connection with the function of discriminating character areas and intermediate image areas, and problems are encountered in connection with character areas and intermediate image areas, i.e., particular areas of image.</p>
    <p num="12">Further, as noted above in electrophotographic and thermal transfer type apparatuses three colors of yellow, magenta and cyan are used in superimposition on one another for color formation, and in many of these apparatuses color materials for black color are used to enhance the reproducibility of black.</p>
    <p num="13">In some of these apparatuses, colors of color originals is reproduced faithfully, and characters (particularly black characters) contained in color originals are reproduced sharply.</p>
    <p num="14">As an example, according to Japanese Patent Publication (Kokoku) No. 56-48869, the color of original is judged, and for a black area a sole color material for black color is used.</p>
    <p num="15">Further, in some apparatuses spacial frequency characteristics of original are determined, and the sharpness of recorded image is improved using edge emphasizing or like spacial filter means such that image areas with sharp image density changes are given sharper image density changes.</p>
    <p num="16">
      Further, in some of the recording means noted above a particular resolution of recording is generated psuedowise for graduation expression by using a systematic dither process or the like.
      <br/>
      Some of these apparatuses use such means as varying the dither matrix size by determining spacial frequency characteristics of the original or switching binarized image and dither image for clearly recording character edges or the like in the recorded image.
    </p>
    <p num="17">However, these apparatuses have the following drawbacks.</p>
    <p num="18">In an apparatus for monochromatic recording in black by judging original colors, black dots contained in a four-color screen print original produced by off-set printing or the like are emphasized, and an unseemly replica of image is obtained.</p>
    <p num="19">
      Further, in case where character edges are recorded sharply by extraction of original image density changes, screen areas of the original cause erroneous judgement to result in an unseemly replica of screen image.
      <br/>
      Further, color character edges cause different color shades from those in the original.
      <br/>
      Still further, there is no apparatus, which permits optimal separation of character areas, screen areas and photograph areas in case of full color copying and also in case of monochromatic copying.
    </p>
    <p num="20">There has been proposed a system, in which an original image is read out, edge areas containing characters and drawings and intermediate image areas containing photographs in the read-out image are separated from one another, and appropriate processes are provided for the respective separated areas (as disclosed in, for instance, "Nikkei Electronics", 1987, No. 425, p-p. 100-101.</p>
    <p num="21">In the prior art technique, however, when an original with intermediate images expressed by screen is read out for processing, the screen areas are judged as edge areas, and therefore undesired processing is provided.</p>
    <p num="22">
      Hitherto, there is known a technique of processing a read-out color image by spacial filtering using wellknown digital filter techniques.
      <br/>
      Further, there is an apparatus, in which the sharpness of the image quality (hereinafter referred to as sharpness) is changed continuously by continuously changing spacial frequency characteristics in spacial filter.
    </p>
    <p num="23">Meanwhile, there has been proposed a system, in which edge areas containing characters or the like and intermediate image areas containing photographs are separated from a read-out image, and appropriate processes are provided to the respective separated areas.</p>
    <p num="24">
      In the prior art apparatus, however, the same sharpness is provided for any of the developing colors of magenta (M), cyan (C), yellow (Y) and black (Br).
      <br/>
      Therefore, there are the following difficiencies.
    </p>
    <p num="25">When the sharpness is reduced in order to prevent noise in photograph areas or moire of screen, the sharpness of character areas is lost, and an image lacking sharpness is obtained.</p>
    <p num="26">Further, where the same sharpness is provided for character areas and flat areas such as photograph areas in an original at all times, in case of desiring an increased sharpness for increasing the sharpness of character areas, noise components in photograph areas are emphasized as well, or in case of desiring reduced sharpness to prevent noise in photograph areas or moire in screen the sharpness of character areas is lost.</p>
    <p num="27">Further, it is liable to judge intermediate tone areas expressed by screen in a portion of original to be edge areas or judge very thin characters as screen, and such "erroneous judgement" causes undesired processing of a portion of image.</p>
    <p num="28">Further, there is a problem in the prior art that with such areas as black characters a color blut of a certain color is generated around black areas due to such causes characteristics of processing circuits for processing individual color components of color image signal or lack of uniformity for individual colors of the sensitivity of a sensor section for converting a given image into a color image signal.</p>
    <p num="29">For this reason, there has been proposed a method of preventing the generation of color blurs (color bleeding) in colors round black character areas.</p>
    <p num="30">However, it has been confirmed by the inventors that black blur is generated around color characters in addition to color blurs around black characters.</p>
    <p num="31">More specifically, the black component is clearly recorded in areas corresponding to color character edges, thus degradating the quality of the reproduced image.</p>

    <heading>DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
    <p num="41">Embodiment</p>
    <p num="42">
      Now, an embodiment of the invention applied to a full-color digital copy machine will be described.
      <br/>
      It is to be construed, however, that this embodiment is by no means limitative, and the invention is applicable as well to various other apparatuses, for instance an apparatus having only a function of converting a given image into an electrical signal.
    </p>
    <p num="43">Overall Construction</p>
    <p num="44">FIG. 2 shows an overall construction of the full-color digital copier.</p>
    <p num="45">
      Image scanner 201 reads out an original and performs digital signal processing on the read-out image.
      <br/>
      Printer 202 prints out a full-color image on a sheet in correspondence to the original image read out by image scanner 201.
    </p>
    <p num="46">
      In image scanner 201, original 204 urged against original table glass (as hereinafter referred to as platen) 203 by mirror surface plate 200 is illuminated by lamps 205.
      <br/>
      Image light from the original is led by mirrors 206 to 208 to lens 209 to be focused on three-line sensor (hereinafter referred to as CCD) 210.
      <br/>
      CCD 210 supplies red (R), green (G) and blue (B) components of full color data of the focused image to signal processing unit 211.
      <br/>
      Lamps 205 and mirrors 206 to 208 scan the entire original area by being moved mechanically in directions perpendicular to an electric scanning direction of the CCD.
      <br/>
      Lamps 205 and mirror 206 are moved at speed v, while mirrors 207 and 208 are moved at one half the speed v (v/2).
      <br/>
      In signal processing unit 211, the read-out image is electrically processed to provide magenta (M), cyan (C), yellow (Y) and black (Bk) components which are supplied to printer 202.
      <br/>
      In one scanning cycle of image scanner 201 one of the components M, C, Y and Bk is supplied to printer 202, and one printing-out cycle is completed by four original scanning cycles.
    </p>
    <p num="47">

      These area judgements are effected by circuits 1304 to 1330 shown in FIG. 13. Selectors 1302 and 1303 select MAX and MIN signals from among R, G and B according to the output of MAX/MIN detector 1301, and selectors 1304 to 1309 select values of constants ka, kb, kc, ia, ib and ic in an interlocked relation to the operation of selector 1303.
      <br/>
      For example, if MAX and MIN are respectively R and G signals, selectors 1304 to 1309 respectively select KAG, KBG, KCG, iAG, iBG and iCG as constants ka, kb, kc, ia, ib and ic.
      <br/>
      The values of constants ka, kb, kc, ia, ib and ic are varied depending on whether the minimum value is R, G or B for the following reason.

    <p num="97">
      The division of the color space area shown in FIG. 16-1 is done using R, G and B color disassembling signals from CCD sensors.
      <br/>
      The MAX/MIN plane of the R. G and B signals has a deviation from the human's sight characteristic.
      <br/>
      This means that the drawing of color-free and colored areas has to be switched according to the color of the original.
    </p>
    <p num="98">
      Accordingly, in this embodiment the MAX axis intercept values of ka, kb, kc, ia, ib and ic are made variable according to the color of the original.
      <br/>
      In this embodiment, the original color is specified according to the result of judgement of the MIN signals in R, G and B light amount signals for the following reason.
      <br/>
      The color hue of original as judged by the man greatly depends on the reflected densities of C, M and Y contained in the original, and the maximum reflected density color corresponds to the minimum light amount signal color.
      <br/>
      Further, the R, G and B light amount signals are converted to C, M and Y density signals using -log functions, and therefore the range is compressed on the maximum value side of light amount signal and expanded on the minimum value side thereof.
      <br/>
      It will be seen that it is advantageous in the aspect of judgement accuracy to use the MIN color signal of light amount signal for the separation of color signal determining the color hue of density signal.
    </p>
    <p num="99">Thus, selectors 1304 to 1309, each of which has a construction as shown in detail in FIG. 15-1, generate MAX intercept values ka, kb, kc, ia, ib and ic using decoding signals S10, S11 and S12 indicating MIN color.</p>
    <p num="100">In this embodiment, ka, kb, kc, ia, ib and ic are made to be as follows according to values determined experimentally by taking CCD sensor color disassembling (color separation) filters into considerations, the ranges of R, G and B being from "0" to "255".

      In the above way, subtractors 1316 to 1315 use different MAX axis intercept values for subtraction from the MAX value for respective MIN colors.

      Meanwhile, values of J1 to J4 are increased in dot portions (or screen portions) as shown at 1909 to 1912.

      FIG. 18-1 is a block diagram showing a character edge judgement unit.

      Referring to FIG. 18-1, reference numeral 1801 designates a density change detection unit, and 1802 a unit for detecting the continuity of density changes for extracting character edge.
      <br/>
      Reference numeral 1842 designates a dot (screen) judgement unit for detecting that a given pixel is a dot image.
      <br/>
      The unit includes dot feature extraction unit 1827 and dot area judgement unit 1828 (detailed internal constructions being described later).
      <br/>
      When dot detection signal DOT becomes "1", the output of NAND gate 1840 becomes "0" (ATLAS=0), and character edge judgement signal EDGE0 is cancelled by AND gate 1841 (EDGE=0).
      <br/>
      In other words, even a portion which is judged to have an edge, is excluded from the edge if it is determined to be a dot (or a screen), and in this case character edge judgement signal is "0".

      Image signal is converted by signal conversion table 1826 into TXG signal.
      <br/>
      FIG. 18-8 shows the construction of signal conversion table 1826.
    </p>
    <p num="130">
      Referring to FIG. 18-8, there are two different signal conversion tables 1881 and 1882.
      <br/>
      The relation between input and output in table 1881 is constructed according to an equation  (Equation image '8' not included in text)
    </p>
    <p num="131">
      Both the inputs and outputs of the table are 8-bit signals, and the signal values are in a range of 0 to 255.
      <br/>
      Table 1881 is used for character edge judgements of ordinary color photographs and various and originals containing dot photographs and various data.
    </p>
    <p num="132">
      The character edge judgement unit usually functions to separate character data in an original from photograph data.
      <br/>
      In many usual character data are recorded in white background.
      <br/>
      On the other hand, photograph data is recorded in the form of continuous changes of density data, and sharp density changes are hardly present in white background.
    </p>
    <p num="133">
      In table 1881 great data level changes are provided in the neighborhood of white background (i.e., a level of 255) in order to facilitate the understanding of character data in white background.
      <br/>
      In order to make it more difficult to detect as character edge a density change with respect to a background having a certain density as is often the case with a photograph, level changes of data in the neighborhood of black background (level 0) are compressed.
      <br/>
      For this reason, table 1881 uses a range of 0 &lt;= x &lt;= 1 with a characteristic of y=x2.
    </p>
    <p num="134">
      Table 1882, on the other hand, is free form level conversion between the input and output as in an equation
      <br/>
      out=in.
    </p>
    <p num="135">
      This signal conversion table 1882 is provided for separating minute character data recorded in a colored background as in a map.
      <br/>
      Therefore, it is provided that input=output for equally separating character data in colored and white backgrounds.
      <br/>
      Selector 1883 selects the outputs of these two tables to provide TXG signal.
      <br/>
      ATLAS signal is supplied as selection singal to selector 1883.
      <br/>
      With H level the output of table 1882 is provided, and with L level the output of table 1881 is provided.
    </p>
    <p num="136">TXG signal provided from selector 1883 shown in FIG. 18-8 is delayed by line memories 1803 and 1804, and three line data are simultaneously input to detector 1805 shown in FIG. 18-1 (the internal construction of which is shown in FIG. 20-1), and which thus provides eight different density change data AK1 to AK8.</p>
    <p num="137">The data AK1 to AK8 are given as  (Equation image '9' not included in text)</p>
    <p num="138">Any of these signals is "1" if there is a sharp density increase in rightward, downward, rightwardly downward, leftwardly downward, leftward, upward, leftwardly upward and rightwardly upward directions with respect to a given pixel and is "0" otherwise.</p>
    <p num="139">
      In the case of the above equations, T1 represents main scanning direction density change detection slice level, T2 auxiliary scanning direction density change detection slice level, and T3 oblique direction density change detection slice level.
      <br/>
      These levels are controlled according to ATLAS signal and 4-bit SEG signal.
      <br/>
      The SEG signal is supplied by the user from operation unit 407 as shown in FIG. 1.
    </p>
    <p num="140">Detector 1805, as shown in FIG. 20-1, includes flip-flops (F/F) 2001 to 2006, differential calculators 2007 and 2014 and comparators 2015 to 2122.</p>
    <p num="141">
      Referring to FIG. 20-1, flip-flops 2001 to 2006 latch image data of pixel 1094 shown in FIG. 19B, differential calculators 2007 to 2014 calculate J1 to J8 noted above, and comparators 2015 to 2022 judgement results AK1 to AK8.
      <br/>
      Density change detection slice level generator is a ROM table, which receives ATLAS and SEG signals as address and provides T1, T2 and T3 as output data.
    </p>
    <p num="142">
      In this embodiment, the SEG signal may assume nine different step values "0" to "8".
      <br/>
      An increase of this value increases slice levels T1, T2 and T3.
      <br/>
      Consequently, if there is no great density change in original, density change signals AK1 to AK8 vanish.
      <br/>
      Conversely, reduction of the SEG signal value reduces T1, T2 and T3.
      <br/>
      Consequently, signals AK1 to AK8 are generated with a small density change in original.
      <br/>
      It is to be understood that in this embodiment the extent of detection of density change is varied through control of the SEG signal.
      <br/>
      When the ATLAS signal is "1", the values of T1, T2 and T3 are reduced to one half as a whole compared to the "0" ATLAS singal, thus making it reader to detect small density changes in original.
      <br/>
      In consequence, in the "1" ATLAS singal case, minute character data in original can be detected.

    <p num="143">
      Referring back to FIG. 18-1, enclosed in dashed rectangle 1802 is a circuit for detecting that sharp density change is continuous in a direction at an angle of 90 degrees with respect to the direction of the density change.

      For example, designated at 2201 and 2202 in FIG. 22-1 are reference pixels when detecting the continuity of vertical edge.

      These reference pixels are for a case when detecting three consequtive pixels, round which the neighboring pixels have a density change feature given as AK1 or AK5.

      The density change data AK1 to AK8, BK1 to BK8, CK1 to CK8, DK1 to DK8 and EK1 to EK8 formed for five lines in the above way are delayed by pixel delay in the 1-st to 5-th step flip-flops for continuity check shown in FIG. 22-1. Subsequently, NAND gates 1809 to 1824 check continuity of three pixels with center pixel (CPU3, CBT3, CLF3, CRT3, CUL3, CBR3, CUR3 and CBL3) as end, and NOR gates 1825 generate EDGE0 signal indicating that the center pixel constitutes a continuous edge.

      Four different gamma conversion characteristics can be selected according to 2-bit DGAM signal supplied to address line together with V5 signal, as shown in FIG. 34.
    </p>
    <p num="214">
      In case of DGAM=0 in FIG. 34, input is equal to output, and this is applicable to non-edge portions.

      In case of DGAM=1, the conversion characteristic is such that of input values of 0 to 255 for inputs in sections of j on the sides of 0 and 255 respective outputs of 0 and 255 are provided and these sections are connected by a line with a slope (inclination) of 255/(255-2j).

      With this characteristic, for an input in the neighborhood of "0" as low density input a lower density video signal is provided, while for an input in the neighborhood of "255" as high density input a higher density video signal is provided, thus providing emphasis on density change of input in the neighborhood of "128" as intermediate density.

    <p num="218">PWM Conversion Unit</p>
    <p num="219">
      VIDEO signal obtained after gamma conversion is converted in PWM conversion unit 119 into a pulse width signal.
      <br/>
      This pulse width modulation signal is used to control the "on" time of laser 213 so as to obtain copy output 406 with gradation density expression.
    </p>
    <p num="220">FIG. 37 shows details of PWM modulation circuit used in the modulation unit.</p>
    <p num="221">
      D/A converter 3701 converts VIDEO signal into analog image signal AV, and toggle flip-flops 3702 and 3803 subject image signal CLK synchronized to VIDEO signal and screen clock CLK4 at double the frequency to HSYNC synchronization and frequency division to 1/2 to obtain clocks CLK4F and CLKF with duty ratio of 50%.
      <br/>
      These two clocks are deformed by integrators 3704 and 3705 into triangular waves, which are then peak regulated by amplifiers 3706 and 3707 into the output dynamic range of A/D covnerter for comparison with AV signal in analog comparators 3708 and 3709.
      <br/>
      Consequently, AV signal is converted into two pulse width modulation signals PW4 and PW.
      <br/>
      Subsequently, selector 3710 either PW4 or PW according to DSCR signal to provide laser drive signal LDR.
    </p>
    <p num="222">
      The timing chart of the operation of this circuit is shown in FIG. 38. As shown, triangular wave TRI4 obtained by integrating clock 4F obtained by frequency dividing CLK4 by 1/2 has a frequency corresponding to one pixel of image.
      <br/>
      This triangular wave is changed substantially linearly over the entire output range of D/A converter.
      <br/>
      Thus, this triangular wave and analog image signal AV are compared to each other, whereby AV signal is pulse width modulated with one pixel interval of image as one cycle period to obtain PW4.
      <br/>
      Likewise, TRl is obtained from CLKF obtained by frequency dividing pixel clock CLK by 1/2.
      <br/>
      Thus, according to TRI the AV signal is pulse width modulated with two pixels of image as one cycle to obtain PW.
      <br/>
      PW4 signal obtained as a result of pulse width modulation with a period of one pixel is recorded by printer with the same resolution as clock CLK.
      <br/>
      However, if PW4 signal is used for image recording, sufficient graduation expression can not be obtained by the features of etectrophotographic process using a printer for the basic density unit is as small as one pixel.
    </p>
    <p num="223">
      On the other hand, with PW signal the density is reproduced with two pixels as unit.
      <br/>
      Thus, sufficient graduation expression can be obtained.
      <br/>
      However, the resolution of the recording is reduced to one half compared to the case of PW4.
    </p>
    <p num="224">
      For the above reason, in this embodiment PW and PW4 are switched for each pixel by controlling DSCR according to the kind of image.
      <br/>
      More specifically, PW4 is used for black and intermediate saturation character edge portions requiring high resolution.
      <br/>
      On the other hand, PW is used for colored character edge portions and non-edge portions in a sense of attaching importance to the color tone.
      <br/>
      It is experimentally recognized, however, with an original constituted by thin colored characters such as a map it is better to use PW4 with importance attached to the resolution for colored character edges as well even with sacrifice in the color tone.
      <br/>
      Signal DSCR for switching PW and PW4 is obtained by delaying SCR signal from screen switching signal generation unit 111 in line delay 121 by one line and one clock.
      <br/>
      FIG. 39 shows details of screen switching signal generation unit 111, and FIG. 40 shows details of screen switching signal generation unit 111 in case when PW4 is used for thin colored characters as well.
      <br/>
      Screen switching signal generation unit 111 includes these circuits shown in FIGS. 39 and 40, and these two circuits are switched according to the mode input from operation unit 407.
      <br/>
      Therefore, DSCR shown in FIG. 38 is LOW for black or intermediate saturation character edge portions (and also colored character edge portions as well in the case of FIG. 40), and during these periods PW4 is provided as LDR signal.
      <br/>
      During this time, even if judgement as edge portion is provided, in case of character edge portion (CAN1=1) having color deviation, PW4 signal is not used in order to prevent deterioration of the quality of recorded image due to emphasis of color deviation.

    <p num="225">
      Through the above processing, laser drive signal LDR is generated to be supplied to printer 201 shown in FIG. 2.
      <br/>
      According to this signal, semiconductor laser 213 is driven by pulse width modulation driving for each pixel, and the resultant laser beam is used for line scanning of photosensitive drum 217.

    <p num="228">For edge portion S, which is strongly black, sole black tonor is recorded according to density signal M2 as shown in FIG. 26. Further, strong edge emphasis as shown in FIG. 32 is provided.</p>
    <p num="229">
      Further, gamma conversion characteristic of DGAM=3 as shown in FIG. 34 is used.
      <br/>
      Consequently, the black character edge portion is recorded as sharp image close to binary image with strong edge emphasis on black tonor color and sharp slop (inclination) gamma characteristic.
      <br/>
      Further, for portion S the DSCR signal shown in FIG. 37 is LOW, and there laser is therefore driven with PWM modulation signal PW4 with a cycle period of one pixel to obtain recorded image of high resolution for each pixel.
    </p>
    <p num="230">
      For non-edge portion P, on the other hand, four color developing materials Y, M, C and Bk are recorded with V2 signal having been UCR/masking color processed, no edge emphasis is provided, and further linear gamma conversion characteristic of DGAM=0 is used.
      <br/>
      Therefore, recording is effected in color tone and graduation faithful to the original.
      <br/>
      Further, in portion P the DSCR signal is HIGH, and therefore PWM modulation signal PW with two-pixel cycle period is used for laser driving.
      <br/>
      Consequently, in the printer the density is expressed for every two pixels, and recorded image with high gradation can be obtained.
    </p>
    <p num="231">
      FIGS. 46-1 and 46-2 show recorded image as a result of switching of the laser drive signal between pulse width modulation signal PW for every two pixels and pulse width modulation signal for every pixel according to DSCR signal.

      Here, the shaded portions are recorded according to pulse width modulation signal for each pixel as shown at 4601, and hatched portions are recorded with pulse width modulation signal for every two pixels as shown at 4602.

      While the laser beam scans section a', SCR signal corresponding to character edge portion is generated.
      <br/>
      Therefore, marginal portions of character are recorded with pulse width modulation singal for every pixel as shown.
      <br/>
      As a result, marginal portions of character are sharp recorded image faithful to the original and with less irregularities.

      In addition, the sharpness is improved with gamma conversion characteristic with slight DGAM=1.
      <br/>
      Further, the laser is driven with pulse width modulation signal with two-pixel cycle period.

      Therefore, the color tone (or gradation) is faithfully reproduced although the sharpness of the character edge is slightly inferior.

    <p num="234">
      Further, non-edge portion P is similar to that shown in FIG. 45-1. In FIGS. 45-3 and 45-4, edge portion t is based on intermediate saturation judgement.
      <br/>
      In this portion, as shown in (c) of FIG. 26, V2 signal is used only by one half for developing colors of M, C and Y, and a signal obtained by adding together one halves of V2 and M2 signals is used for developing color Bk.
    </p>
    <p num="235">
      These signals are given weak edge emphasis.
      <br/>
      Further, characteristic DGAM=2 is used as gamma conversion characteristic.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the signal change of character edge is made comparatively sharp although it is not so sharp as for black character edges.
      <br/>
      As laser drive signal, pulse width modulation signal for every pixel is used for portion t only when Bk developing material is used.
    </p>
    <p num="236">Further, the color hue of edge portion is maintained by recording developing materials of Y, M and C according to pulse width modulation signal for every two pixels.</p>
    <p num="237">Thus, the color hue of portion t of intermediate saturation is repdocued with developing materials of Y, M and C, and the sharpness of character edge is reproduced with developing material of Bk.</p>
    <p num="238">
      In the cases of FIGS. 45-5 and 45-6, intermediate saturation and black components are generated in character edge portions due to color deviation.
      <br/>
      In this case, the processing of edge portion as described before with reference to FIGS. 45-1 to 45-4 is all cancelled by CAN1 signal.
      <br/>
      This has an effect of preventing color deviation portion to be recorded by emphasis.
    </p>
    <p num="239">
      When copying is done with ATLAS signal of "1", EDGE signal shown in FIG. 45 is generated even with very minute density change.
      <br/>
      For this reason, even in case of thin characters or characters in colored background, black, colored and intermediate saturation characters are recorded sharply as shown in FIGS. 45-1 to 45-4.
      <br/>
      Thus, it is possible to obtain satisfactorily modulated image.
    </p>
    <p num="240">Now, a control operation of control unit 401 for varying ATLAS and SEG signals according to the operation unit input shown in FIG. 6 will be described hereinafter.</p>
    <p num="241">Map Mode/Standard Mode</p>
    <p num="242">
      As described above, the map mode is one, in which thin characters and low density characters can be readily judged to be character edges.
      <br/>
      When this mode is selected, the control unit makes ATLAS signal to be "1".
    </p>
    <p num="243">
      In consequence, character edge judgement unit 107 detects minute density changes over the entire density range from white to black as described before with reference to FIG. 20-2. To select this map mode, the operator depresses image creation key 613 shown in FIG. 6 (block 4702 in FIG. 47).
      <br/>
      As a result, control unit 401 switches standard screen 4701 displayed on liquid crystal display unit over to image creation mode setting screen 4703, as shown in FIG. 47.
    </p>
    <p num="244">In screen 4701, designated at 4713 is copying magnification, 4714 recording sheet size, and 4715 set number of copies.</p>
    <p num="245">
      Every time the operator depresses +character pullout} key 608, as indicated at 4704, cursor is lowered by one step.
      <br/>
      When key 608 is depressed three times, the display screen is switched over to display 4705, and when key 608 is depressed further twice, i.e., a total of five times, cursor 4712 is moved to a preset position in the map mode.
    </p>
    <p num="246">
      Here, the OFF display is a dark display under bright background, and the ON display is a bright display under dark background.
      <br/>
      It is shown that the map mode is OFF (i.e., not set).
    </p>
    <p num="247">When +character pullout} key 611 is depressed, as shown at 4707, map mode=OFF is discriminated, and ATLAS signal is made "0", while switcing the display back to the standard display, as shown at 4711.</p>
    <p num="248">When +character pullout} key 610 is depressed, as shown at 4705, control unit 401 causes display of the OFF state of the map mode as bright display under dark background, as shown at 4708 and causes display of the ON state as dark display under bright background to indicate that the map mode is ON (i.e., set).</p>
    <p num="249">
      When +character pullout} key 611 is depressed at this time, as shown at 4709, control unit 401 discriminates map mode=ON for making ATLAS signal "1" and switching the display back to standard display 4711.
      <br/>
      When +character pullout} key 609 is depressed at 4708, control unit 401 switches the display back to the state shown at 4705, thus indicating that the map mode is turned OFF again.
      <br/>
      When copy start key 602 is depressed in the presence of display 4711, control unit 401 causes copying operation according to ATLAS signal as set above.
      <br/>
      When copy start key 602 is depressed in display state 4705 or 4708, control unit 401 changes ATLAS signal in correspondence to the map mode display state noted above and switches the display back to display 4711.
      <br/>
      Copying operation is started subsequently.

    <p num="250">Control of SEG Signal</p>
    <p num="251">Now, an operation of control unit 401 to control SEG signal to character edge judgement unit 107 according to key input to the operation unit shown in FIG. 6, will now be described with reference to FIG. 48.</p>
    <p num="252">When asterisk key 612 is depressed, as shown at 4802, in standard screen 4801, control unit 401. changes the display on the liquid crystal display unit over to asterisk (*) mode set screen display 4803.</p>
    <p num="253">
      When the operator depresses +character pullout} key five times, for instance, to select character/photograph separation level 6, control unit 401 provides display 4805 and brings cursor 4815 to character/photograph separation level position.
      <br/>
      When the operator depresses asterisk key 612 or +character pullout} key 611 at this time, the display is changed to one 4807 for setting the character/photograph separation level.
    </p>
    <p num="254">
      The character/photograph separation level is one of nine levels as shown, and each display position corresponds to SEG signal value.
      <br/>
      When cursor 4816 is at the leftmost position, SEG=0.
      <br/>
      As the cursor position is shifted by one step to the right, the SEG signal value is increased by one.
      <br/>
      When the cursor comes to the rightmost position, SEG=8.
      <br/>
      In display state 4807 SEG=4.
      <br/>
      When +character pullout} key 609 is depressed twice, as shown at 4808, control unit 401 provides display 4809 and recognizes SEG=2.

    <p num="255">When +character pullout} key 610 is depressed three times in display state 4807, as shown at 4810, the display is changed to one 4811, and SEG=7 is recognized.</p>

      When +character pullout} key is depressed in display states 4809 and 4811 as shown at 4812 and 4813, control unit 401 provides SEG signal value and causes display 4814 again.
      <br/>
      Even when copy start key 602 is depressed in either of display states 4807, 4809 and 4811, control unit 401 provides the SEG signal value and provides display 4814 again to start copying operation.
    </p>
    <p num="257">
      In case when ATLAS=0, by increasing the SEG signal value dot judgement slice level T4 in the dot area (screen area) judgement unit is reduced.
      <br/>
      In this case, determination as dote (screen) takes place even with slight dot feature signal DOT0.
      <br/>
      As shown in FIG. 20-2, slice levels T1, T2 and T3 are increased, making the character edge extraction more difficult.
      <br/>
      As a result, portions which are sharply recorded as character edges in recorded image are reduced.
      <br/>
      This means that the process is suited for recording soft photograph as a whole (preference to photograph).
      <br/>
      When the SEG signal value is reduced on the other hand, T4 is increased, thus making generation of dot signal DOT more difficult and reducing T1, T2 and T3.
      <br/>
      Thus, character edges are more readily extracted.
      <br/>
      As a result, portions which are sharply recorded as character edges in recorded image are increased, and even fine character data is sharply recorded (preference to character).
    </p>
    <p num="258">
      In case of ATLAS=1 (i.e., when the map mode is ON), T1, T2 and T3 are changed according to the magnitude of SEG signal with the same tendency as in the case of ATLAS=0.
      <br/>
      For this reason, preference to photograph is obtained by increasing SEG, while preference to character is obtained by reducing SEG.
    </p>
    <p num="259">
      In case of ATLAS=1, DOT signal is ignored as shown in FIG. 18-1. Further, as shown in FIG. 20-2, the values of T1, T2 and T3 are respectively reduced to be less than one half compared to the case of ATLAS=0.
      <br/>
      Therefore, finer characters and also characters in colored background due to the circuit of FIG. 18-7 are extracted.

    <p num="260">
      In the above description, color disassembly signal G is used as brightness signal of color image signal.
      <br/>
      However, character edge extraction means are not limited to those dealing with color read-out singals, but the invention is also applicable to those dealing with read-out signals of monochromatic original reader without color disassembly function such as facsimile apparatus.

    <p num="261">Second Embodiment</p>
    <p num="262">Character edge judgement unit 107 as noted above detects character edge according to the level difference of preceding and succeeding pixels with respect to a given (objective) pixel.</p>
    <p num="263">
      However, deviation of original image focusing lens 209 shown in FIG. 2 from the set position causes fading of the optical image focused by CCD 210.
      <br/>
      Due to this fading, there are cases when a character original can be detected as character edge and when this can not.
    </p>
    <p num="264">
      With an original, in which black and white recur at a pitch of about 0.2 mm as shown in FIG. 49A, the CCD output for G has a MTF of about 85% in the best focus state of the focusing lens used in this embodiment (FIG. 49B).
      <br/>
      In view of fluctuations at the time of mass production, the average value of MTF is about 55% (FIG. 49C).
    </p>
    <p num="265">Further, the worst value of MTF due to fading amounts to about 40% (FIG. 49D).</p>
    <p num="266">
      In this embodiment the original is disassembled into 400 dots per inch 25.5 mm. Therefore, 0.2 mm corresponds to about three pixels.
      <br/>
      In other words, the pitch of recurrence of white and black in the original shown in FIG. 49A is about three pixels.
    </p>
    <p num="267">Meanwhile, in the character edge extraction in this embodiment, level difference at a distance of about 2 pixels is detected for taking level difference of pixels leftwardly, rightwardly, upwardly, downwardly and oblique with respect to a given pixel.</p>
    <p num="268">
      In this embodiment, the theorem of sampling is used to obtain disassembling at the limit.
      <br/>
      Further, using an original a three-pixel cycle slightly coarser than the two-pixel cycle, edge detection slice levels T1, T2 and T3 as shown in FIG. 20-2 and dot area judgement slice level T4 as shown in FIG. 18-6 are made variable according to MTF value of G signal in the original.
    </p>
    <p num="269">In the original shown in FIG. 49A, black has a density of 2 0 (slashed zero)  An actual original may contain characters recorded as black data with a density of 0.2. In this case, the black level is about 170, the range of black and white is 85 level and one-third of the value in case when the black data density is 2 0 (slashed zero)  In order to permit determination of black data with density of 0.2 as character, control unit 401 generates SEG signal to make the value of one-third of amplitude value W determined by measurement to be the center value of character/photograph separation level shown at 4807 in FIG. 48.</p>
    <p num="270">
      In case of MTF of 55%, W=145.
      <br/>
      Therefore, SEG=6 which is closest to T1 =48 with ATLAS=0 at T1 =W/3, is made to correspond to the center value of the character/photograph separation level.
    </p>
    <p num="271">
      In case of MTF of 85%, W=215.
      <br/>
      In this case, therefore, T1 =71.
      <br/>
      Therefore, SEG=8 which is closet to T1 =71 and corresponds to T1 =80 is made to correspond to the center value of the character/photograph separation level.
    </p>
    <p num="272">
      In case of MTF=40%, W=105, and T1 =35.

      Thus, SEG=4 is made to correspond to the center of the character/photograph separation level.
    </p>
    <p num="273">In this embodiment, SEG corresponding to the center value of character/photograph separation level is limited to five values of SEG=4 to SEG=8, and these values are made to correspond to respective center values of CENTER=0 to CENTER=4.</p>

      FIG. 52 shows values of SEG selected by control unit 401 in correspondence to the display scale of character/photograph separation level shown at 4807 in FIG. 48 in case of CENTER values of 0 to 4.

      Character/photograph level 1 shows the left end of the display scale and corresponds to the reference to character.

      When the operator inputs data from ten key set 604 and asterisk key 612, a character/photograph separation level center value input mode is set.

      Control unit 401 recognizes this mode input and causes display 5305 on liquid crystal display unit 601.
      <br/>
      The operator then inputs the CENTER value calculated in step 5306 (in the illustrated case "2" is input).
      <br/>
      The control unit recognizes the CENTER value input by the ten key set and provides display as shown at 5307.

    <p num="278">
      The operator then provides input from +character pullout} key 611, whereupon the CENTER value is stored in non-volatile memory.

      As shown, in this second embodiment means is provided, which varies the character edge detection level in correspondence to the fading in the optical system.

    <p num="282">In this embodiment, a memory for storing one-line signal of G signal is added to the construction shown in FIG. 1, and also means is provided for causing control unit 401 to recognize the setting of original shown in FIG. 49A on the original table by a man, thus causing G signal due to original to be stored in the memory to let control unit 401 automatically set the CENTER value shown in FIG. 53 using the maximum and minimum values of the signal values.</p>
    <p num="283">As has been shown, with this embodiment, by the provision of means for varying the character edge judgement level, it is possible to suppress generation of discontinuity of density in photograph recorded image or sharp high density dots due to erroneous determination of photograph original as character original.</p>

    <p num="288">
      Areas which are not judged as EDGE by character edge judgement unit 107 in the first embodiment include dot (screen) originals as shown at 1903 in FIG. 19.

      In order to prevent this, this embodiment is constructed such that FILTER circuit 117 provides smoothing for an original area not determined as character edge (i.e., an area which is highly possibly a dot or screen).

    <p num="300">As described above, according to the invention the character edge judgement and saturation judgement of original are executed simultaneously, whereby it is possible while maintaining the color hue of colored character portion to improve the sharpness of color-free character portion, remove color impurity in black character portion and suppress moire fringe of dot original portion while improving the sharpness of character portion and increasing the amount of black color material of black character portion to permit clear reproduction of black character.</p>
    <p num="301">Fifth Embodiment</p>
    <p num="302">It has been described in connection with the first embodiment that intermediate saturation judgement signal UNK and black judgement signal BL are generated due to color bleeding around colored character due to scanning speed fluctuations and focusing magnification errors.</p>

    <p num="304">Therefore, if UNK or BL signal is generated due to erroenous judgement caused by color bleeding as noted above, a great amount of black toner is used for colored character edge portions of recorded image, thus resulting in an unseemly image.</p>
    <p num="305">To prevent this, in the first embodiment CAN signal is generated through detection of the presence of small light amount color signal (COL) around a given pixel.</p>
    <p num="306">In this case, if the given pixel is of intermediate saturation or in case of black signal, it is determined to be due to color bleeding around colored character, thus preventing use of a great quantity of black toner through a process as shown in the table of FIG. 26.</p>

      In the first embodiment G signal is used for the detection of light quantity signal.
      <br/>
      However, a G signal provided in response to the reading of a green color original indicates a maximum light quantity value like the case of a white original.
      <br/>
      Therefore, with color deviation portions generated around a green character, the G signal has reduced signal value compared to the green character portion, and CAN signal is generated.
      <br/>
      As a result, a great amount of tonor is used around green character in recorded image, thus resulting in deterioration of recorded image.

      These G2, G3 and G4 signals are supplied to calculation unit 1722 same as that in the first embodiment to generate the CAN signal.

    <p num="310">
      The ND signal represents the brightness of original independent of the color hue, and it is generated by supplying the outputs of multipliers 4501 to 4503, which provide 1/3 of respective color disassembly signals R, G and B of the original, to adder 4504.
      <br/>
      Since the ND signal is thus a sum of 1/3 of each of signals R, G and B, it has all color components.

    <p num="311">By using this ND signal as brightness singal, it is possible to generate CAN signal from calculation unit 1722 for color bleeding generated around colored characters of all color hues.</p>

      In the embodiments of FIGS. 1 and 2, it is possible to generate CAN signal for cancelling intermediate saturation judgement or black judgement up to one pixel around pixel, with which color judgement signal COL is generated.
      <br/>
      However, UNK signal two pixels outside COL signal shown in FIG. 56 remains for CAN signal is not generated.
      <br/>
      Consequently, CAN signal is generated as well for portions, for which black judgement signal BL is generated.
      <br/>
      Thus, developing colors M, C and Y as well as developing color Bk are recorded with color signal V2 generated from UCR/MASK circuit 105, as shown in FIG. 26. On the other hand, for portion, for which intermediate saturation signal UNK is generated, CAN signal is not generated.
      <br/>
      Therefore, only one half of color signal V2 generated in UCR/MASK circuit 105 is used for developing colors M, C and Y, and density signal M2 is provided for developing color Bk.
      <br/>
      Therefore, there are cases when a greater amount of Bk toner is used for outer intermediate saturation portion than inner black portion, and in such cases recorded image is formed, in which two-dot black edges are present around colored character.
    </p>
    <p num="316">
      In the sixth embodiment, CAN signal is generated, which cancels BL and UNK signals generated for two dots around the above color judgement signal.

      FIG. 51 shows an involved structure.

      This Figure is a substitute for FIG. 17-3 in the first embodiment.
      <br/>
      Like the fifth embodiment, ND1 signal, which represents the average value of R, G and B signals, is provided from adder 4504.
      <br/>
      Line memories 4701 to 4704 each delays the light quantity signal ND1 by one line to provide light quantity signals ND1, ND2, ND3, ND4 and ND5 for five lines.
      <br/>
      This light quantity signal is supplied to calculation unit 4705.
      <br/>
      At the same time, 5-line color judgement signals COL1, COL2, COL3, COL4 and COL5 corresponding to the respective light quantity signals are also supplied to calculation unit 4705.
    </p>
    <p num="318">FIG. 58 shows calculation unit 4705 in detail.</p>
    <p num="319">
      The light quantity signals ND1 to ND5 and color judgement signals COL1 to COL5 for five lines are delayed by four clocks at the most by flip-flops 4801 to 4812.
      <br/>
      Here, ND33 and COL33 are of the given pixel.
      <br/>
      Like the case of FIG. 17-2, comparators 4813 to 4816 and AND gates 4817 to 4820 execute judgement as to whether there is a pixel with less light quantity (higher density) than a given pixel and judged to be a colored pixel around the given pixel.
      <br/>
      This completes a check concerning one pixel around the given pixel.
    </p>
    <p num="320">
      Subsequently, comparators 4812, 4822, 4823 and 4824 and AND gates 4825 to 4828 execute a check as to whether there is a pixel with less light quantity value and judged to be a colored pixel one pixel outwardly of the pixel one pixel outwardly of the given pixel.
      <br/>
      This check is done for checking whether there are two pixels having a color deviation feature outwardly of the given pixel.
    </p>
    <p num="321">Further, light quantity levels of the given pixel and a pixel one pixel outwardly of the given pixel are compared, and if the given pixel is higher in the light quantity value (i.e., lower in density), the given pixel is liable to be of erroneous judgement due to influence of color judgement pixel two pixels outwardly of it.</p>
    <p num="322">To check this, AND gates 4818 to 4832 AND the outputs of AND gates 4825 to 4828 and outputs of comparators 4813 to 4816.</p>
    <p num="323">
      For example, comparator 4821 compares ND23 of pixel one pixel above the given pixel and ND13 of pixel further one pixel above.
      <br/>
      If ND13 is lower in the light quanatity value (i.e., higher in density) than ND23 and concerns a color judgement pixel (COL13=1), ND23 is a color deviation pixel of colored pixel ND13, and AND gate 4825 provides output of "1".
    </p>
    <p num="324">If ND23 is lower in the light quantity value than the given pixel ND33 in addition, the given pixel ND33 is a color deviation pixel two pixels outwardly of colored pixel ND13, and AND gate 4829 provides output of "1".</p>
    <p num="325">The outputs of AND gates 4817 to 4820 indicating the presence of a high density colored pixel one pixel outwardly of the given pixel and outputs of AND gates 4829 to 4832 indicating the presence of a high density colored pixel two pixels outwards are ORed by OR gates 4833 to 4837, whereby CAN signal is provided.</p>
    <p num="326">The CAN signal is dealt with in the same way as CAN signal in FIG. 1 and is used for cancelling BL and UNK signals two pixels outwardly of COL signal.</p>
    <p num="327">As described above, with this embodiment it is possible to distinguish color bleeding component contained around color edge portion of original and signal of color-free or intermediate saturation.</p>
    <p num="328">In consequence, at the time of image recording color-free edge portions can be recorded sharply by using a greater amount of black toner, while there is no need of using unnecessary black toner for color edge portion, thus permitting high saturation image recording.</p>
    <p num="329">Further, particularly with this embodiment a signal obtained by combining R, B and G signals is used for the judgement of character edge portion, and therefore it is possible to effectively prevent black color bleeding around a sole green color character, for instance.</p>
    <p num="330">Seventh Embodiment</p>
    <p num="331">
      In the embodiment shown in FIG. 42, a smoothing process is performed for all areas other than character edge areas.
      <br/>
      The smoothing process, although it has an advantage of alleviating dot moire (or screen moire), has a demerit of sacrifice in the sharpness of image.
    </p>
    <p num="332">
      The seventh embodiment seeks to improve this difficiency.
      <br/>

      <br/>
      A first difficiency is that with thin and intricated characters character edges are grasped difficultly and are liable to be grasped as part of photograph (dots or screen), thus resulting in failure of clear reproduction.
    </p>
    <p num="372">A second difficiency is that sharp edge portions in photograph are liable to be recognized as characters, thus resulting in unnatural edge emphasis to obtain unseemly image.</p>
    <p num="373">A third difficiency is that an image with characters provided on a dot background as in a map is liable to be detected as dot image to result in failure of clear copying of characters.</p>

      As shown in FIG. 72F, 2-bit select signals (S(0), S(1)) are 0, 1, 2 and 3, four inputs A, B, C and D are selectively provided.
    </p>
    <p num="408">Therefore, in the spacial filter unit the factor matrix can be switched in synchronism to DFIL signal supplied in synchronism to a given pixel.</p>
    <p num="409">
      In this embodiment, predetermined values are set in registers 351 to 356 in advance such that the filter factor corresponds to photograph sharpness when DFIL=0, 1 and to character sharpness when DFIL=2, 3 with respect to filter switching signal DFIL.
      <br/>
      In this embodiment, the operator inputs values as shown in FIG. 72G to obtain a factor matrix shown in FIG. 72H, and thereby sets of factors corresponding to the values of sharpness set by the CPU are set in individual operators.
      <br/>
      For sharpness, the operator can input a desired value from operation unit 1870, and different values can be set for a plurality of areas by area designation.
    </p>
    <p num="410">
      FIG. 72H shows selectable spacial filter combinations.
      <br/>
      DFIL0 to DFIL4 are given in the horizontal direction, and the sharpness level (capable of being set to five levels in this embodiment) is shown in the vertical direction.
      <br/>
      For example, in case of sharpness of "3", smoothing is provided with DFIL=0, and edge emphasis is provided with DFIL=1.
      <br/>
      The degree of edge emphasis is increased as one goes to the right, e.g., DFIL2, DFIL3, . . . .
    </p>
    <p num="411">
      In case of DFIL=0, sharpness 1 represents strongest smoothing, and the degree of smoothing is reduced with sharpnesses 2, 3, and so forth.
      <br/>
      Sharpness 4 provides edge emphasis, and sharpness 5 provides strong edge emphasis.
    </p>
    <p num="412">In this way, the greater the value of DFIL and the value of sharpness the degree of edge emphasis is the stronger (i.e., the degree of smoothing is the weaker), and the smaller the value of DFIL and value of sharpness, the stronger is the degree of smoothing (the weaker is the degree of edge emphasis).</p>
    <p num="413">The filter control signal DFIL will now be described.</p>
    <p num="414">Filter Control Signal Generation Unit</p>
    <p num="415">The case of FIG. 73 in this embodiment is basically the same as the case of FIG. 31, and the difference is that FIL(0) and FIL(1) signals are controlled according to MODE0, MODE2, PHASE(0) and PHASE(1) signals.</p>
    <p num="416">
      IN the case of the character mode the mode signal is MOD0=0 and MOD1=1, and the values of FIL(0) and FIL(1) are forcibly made "1" irrespective of BL1 signal (black pixel) and EDGE signal (edge).
      <br/>
      In the case of photograph mode, NOD0=1 and MOD1=0, and the values of FIL(0) and FIL(1) are forcibly made "0".
      <br/>
      Further, in automatic character/photograph judgement mode MOD0=MOD1=1 the values of FIL(0) and FIL(1) similarly depend on CAN1, BL1, EDGE, UNK1 and COL1.
    </p>
    <p num="417">More specifically, in the character mode in each original kind mode MOD0=0, and FIL(0)="1" and FIL(1)="1". Thus, strong edge emphasis is provided for the entire copy surface, and character sharpness is adopted.</p>
    <p num="418">In the photograph mode MOD0="1" and MOD1="0", and FIL(0)="0" or FIL(1)="0". Thus, photograph sharpness is adopted over the entire copy surface.</p>
    <p num="419">
      In the charactr/photograph mode MOD0="1" and MOD1="1", and FIL(0) and FIL(1) are switched according to the image area.
      <br/>
      Photograph sharpness and character sharpness are applied for each pixel.
    </p>
    <p num="420">
      In FIG. 73, when PHASE(0) and PHASE(1) are supplied and PHASE(0)=PHASE(1), that is, in case of Bk tonor development and FIL(0)=0, FIL(1) signal is held "1" at all time.
      <br/>
      This is done so in that in case of BK printing it is desirable to provide stronger edge emphasis compared to the case of Y, M and C for black pixels are reproduced more sharply and image becomes tenser.
    </p>
    <p num="421">Filter Switching</p>
    <p num="422">FIG. 74B shows the correspondence between the values of FIL(0) and FIL(1) and values of FIL.</p>
    <p num="423">
      FIG. 74A shows application of filter switching signal FIL to various original modes.
      <br/>
      In FIG. 74A, in case of the character mode FIL=3 is applied to the entire image area.
    </p>
    <p num="424">
      In case of the character/photograph mode, FIL=3 is applied for black character portion (Bk1=1 and EDGE=1).
      <br/>
      FIL=2 is applied for intermediate saturation character portion (UNK=1 and EDGE=1).
      <br/>
      For flat portion (EDGE=0) and colored portion (COL1=1 and EDGE=1), FIL=1 is used for development with Bk tonor (PHASE(0)=PHASE(1)=1), and FIL=0 is used for developing with C, M or Y tonor.
    </p>
    <p num="425">In case of the photograph mode, FIL=1 is used when Bk tonor is used for development, and FIL=0 C, M or Y tonor is used for development.</p>
    <p num="426">The value of FIL (DFIL) is for such processing as to enhance the sharpness in the order of values of 3, 2 and 1 and enhancing the smoothing effect in the order of values of 0,1, 2 and 3.</p>
    <p num="427">Filter of FIL=3 is used when the utmost sharpness is necessary, and it is used for overall image area in character mode and black character portion in original in case of character/photograph mode.</p>
    <p num="428">Filter of FIL=2 is used when sharpness next to FIL=3 is necessary, and is used for intermediate color character portion in original in character/photograph mode.</p>
    <p num="429">
      FIL=0 or FIL=1 is used for flat and colored portions in character/photograph mode or overall image area in photograph mode.
      <br/>
      It is possible to provide modulation of the overall image by setting the sharpness in case of development with Bk tonor to be stronger than the sharpness in case of development with Y, M or C tonor.
      <br/>
      FIL=1 is used when using Bk tonor for development, and FIL=0 is used when using Y, M or C tonor.
    </p>
    <p num="430">
      As shown in the note column in FIG. 74A, the case of FIL=0 and FIL=1 corresponds to photograph sharpness, and in case of switching the sharpness value in five steps with operation unit 1870, the filter factors of FIL=0 and FIL=1 are switched in an interlocked relation to one another by CPU 1871.
      <br/>
      Likewise, FIL=2 and FIL=3 are switched in an interlocked relation to one another in correspondence to the character sharpness.
    </p>
    <p num="431">
      The photograph sharpness and character sharpness are individually divided into two divisions for interlocking as above for the following reason.
      <br/>
      The case of FIL=0, 1 occurs when major portion of original is judged to be photograph image, while the case of FIL=2, 3 occurs when the major portion is judged to be character image.
      <br/>
      Therefore, variation of the sharpness strength in an interlocked fashion is more effective for preventing the reproduced image from becoming unnatural.
    </p>
    <p num="432">
      It is of course possible to permit setting of the sharpness strength independently for FIL=0 to 4.
      <br/>
      Particularly, such independent adjustment is effective if it is intended to provide for increased sharpness for character and obtain very smooth reproduction of photograph portion.

    <p num="433">Screen Switching Signal Generation Unit</p>
    <p num="434">
      FIG. 75 shows the circuit construction of screen switching signal generation unit 111.
      <br/>
      The basic construction and functions are the same as those in case of FIG. 39, and the difference is that MOD1 and MOD2 signals are supplied from CPU 1871.
    </p>
    <p num="435">
      In case of the character mode, the circuit shown in FIG. 75, including OR gate 8006, AND gates 8001 to 8005 and NOR gate 8004, provides MOD1=1 and MOD0=0, gate 8001 provides output of "0", gate 8002 provides output of "1", gate 8003 provides output of "0", gate 8004 provides output of "0", and gate 8005 provides output of "0" at all time.
      <br/>
      Thus, SCR=0 is provided at all time, that is, printing is done with PW4 at all time.
    </p>
    <p num="436">
      In case of the photograph mode, MOD1=0 and MOD0=1, gate 8001 provides output of "1", gate 8002 provides output of "0", gate 8003 provides output of "1", gate 8004 provides output of "1", and gate 8006 provides output of "1" at all time.
      <br/>
      Thus, SCR=1 at all time, that is, printing is done with PW at all time.
    </p>
    <p num="437">
      In case of character/photograph mode, MOD1=1 and MOD0=1.
      <br/>
      Gate 8001 provides output of "0", gate 8002 provides output of "0", gate 8003 provides output of "0", and gate 8004 provides output of "1".
      <br/>
      Thus, SCR signal corresponding to BL1, UNK1, CAN1 and EDGE is generated like the case of FIG. 39.
    </p>
    <p num="438">More specifically, in various original kind modes, in character mode (MOD=1 and MOD0=0) SCR="0" at all time, PW4 is selected at all time, and printing is done with high resolution of 400 dpi (dot per inch).</p>
    <p num="439">In photograph mode (MOD=0 and MOD0=1), SCR="1" at all time, PW is selected at all time, and printing is done with high graduation of 200 dpi, for instance.</p>
    <p num="440">In character/photograph mode (MOD=1 and MOD0=1), PW4 is selected for black character areas and PW for others.</p>
    <p num="441">In the above way, an input signal enable circuit may be formed for driving the laser driver for printing differently, i.e., for high resolution and high graduation, according to mode signals MOD1 and MOD0, thus permitting printing in correspondence to the kind of image.</p>
    <p num="442">In this embodiment, the combinations of modes, judgement conditions and processing conditions are not limited to the above specific example.</p>
    <p num="443">
      For example, in the case of FIG. 75 a map mode may be defined as MOD0=0 and MOD1=0 in addition to the three different modes noted above in this embodiment (other modes being the same as in the above embodiment).
      <br/>
      In the case of the map mode, with EDGE=1 SCR=0 is provided to select PW4 irrespective of BL1, UNK1 and CAN1.
      <br/>
      Thus, it is possible to maintain the sharpness of characters peculier to the map.

      <br/>
      When it is detected in step 4306 that sharpness is set, sharpness value is set and held in step 4307.

      In step 4308, values of R00 to R33 are set in registers in corresondence to the value of sharpness held in step 4307, and copying operation is executed in step 4305.

    <p num="458">Further, with this embodiment sharpness for character portion and that for photograph portion can be selected independently, and thus it is made possible to set sharpness of image continuously and independently in dependence on the king of input image (for instance, character image, photograph image and character/photograph image), thus permitting images of adequate sharpness to be obtained according to the use and taste.</p>
    <p num="459">The strength of sharpness may be set as key input to the operation unit, or it may be input from a keyboard of a computer when the apparatus is connected thereto.</p>

    <p num="499">
      In the embodiments of FIGS. 82 and 86, original kind modes (character, character/photograph and photomodes) and map mode are designated for individual areas.
      <br/>
      However, these modes are by no means limitative, and it is possible to set other parameters.
    </p>
    <p num="500">
      FIGS. 87A and 87B show such an embodiment.
      <br/>
      In these Figures, displays like those in FIG. 80 are designated by like reference numerals.
      <br/>
      Like the case of FIG. 80, when .tangle-soliddn. key is depressed in display 910 or 911 for map mode ON/OFF selection, display 4703 shown in FIG. 87B is provided, and the cursor is brought to character sharpness.
      <br/>
      Now, character sharpness can be designated in five steps such that the character sharpness designation is increased by one with +character pullout} key (4703 to 4704) and is reduced by one with +character pullout} key (4704 to 4703).
    </p>
    <p num="501">When .tangle-soliddn. key is depressed in state 4703 or 4704, the cursor is brought to photograph sharpness, and now photograph sharpness can be designated in five steps with +character pullout} and +character pullout} keys as in 4703 and 4704 (4705, 4706).</p>
    <p num="502">When .gradient. key is depressed in state 4705 or 4706, character/photograph separation level can be set, and it can be designated in five steps with +character pullout} and +character pullout} keys (4707, 4708).</p>
    <p num="503">In either of cases 4703 to 4708, by depressing OK key things go to 908 in FIG. 87A to wait for area designation. (By repeating the above operation it is possible to designate sharpness without limitation on the number of areas.</p>
    <p num="504">In area 0 in FIG. 79, it is possible to designate character/photograph separation level and sharpness with usual operation as area other than designated area.</p>
    <p num="505">Further, as shown in FIG. 88 CPU 406 may receive address from address generator 407 and generate MOD0, MOD1 and ATLAS signals in synchronism to each address.</p>
    <p num="506">Further, for providing filter corresponding to the values of character sharpness and photograph sharpness in each area, the CPU supplies the values of R00 to R33 to 402 and supplies T1 to T3 to 403 according to the value of the character/photograph separation level.</p>
    <p num="507">
      FIG. 89 shows processing flow.
      <br/>
      When it is detected in step 4901 that area designation has been made, in step 4902 a mode (character, character/photograph, photograph, map, sharpness, character/photograph separation level) is designated for the designated area.
    </p>
    <p num="508">When it is detected in step 4903 that the mode is switched by the usual key operation, mode (character, character/photograph, map, sharpness, separation level) for an area outside designated area 0 shown in FIG. 79 is switched.</p>
    <p num="509">When it is detected in step 4905 that the start key is depressed, in step 4907 T1 to T3 are provided according to character/photograph separation level, R00 to R33 according to sharpness, and MOD0, MOD1 and ATRAS according to original mode, during copying operation and in synchronism to the designated area.</p>
    <p num="510">In the above embodiments shown in FIG. 78 and following Figures, by varying the standards of character/photograph judgement in an area designation range, it is possible, even if an area subject to erroneous character/photograph judgement is present in an image under consideration, to obtain satisfactory image judgement by designating such range in advance and inputting judgement standards such as to permit satisfactory judgement in the designated area.</p>
    <p num="511">
      Further, while this embodiment is adapted to permit variation of the standards of character/photograph judgement, this is by no means limitative; for example, it is possible to permit setting of the character mode or photograph mode noted above absolutely without character/photograph judgement for a particular area.
      <br/>
      This embodiment deals with color images for processing, and this means that there are many cases of processing of dot color images.
      <br/>
      Therefore, with combination of the area designation and character/photograph judgement control it is possible to obtain image area judgement with very high accuracy.
    </p>
    <p num="512">
      Further, in this embodiment it is possible to set map mode, character sharpness and photograph sharpness independently in area designatoni area as shown in FIGS. 87A and 87B.
      <br/>
      Thus, for an area in an image under consideration, for which emphasis is desired, for instance, for a character portion in image where character and photograph are present in superimposition on each other such as a commercial catalog, area designation may be done for such portion, and slightly stronger character sharpness may be provided for that area.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, map mode may be designated to obtain a desired image with emphasis provided to edges of character portion.

    <p num="536">
      Referring to FIG. 101, gamma switching signal generation unit 110 consists of a R0M, and it receives color judgement signal, character edge judgement signal (and color mode signal) as address and provides GAM signal as data.

      FIG. 102 shows contents of Rom table.
      <br/>
      As noted before, GAM=3 for black character edge portion (EDGE=1, BL1=1), and GAM=2 for intermediate saturation character edge portion (EDGE=1, UNK=1).
      <br/>
      In either case, if there is CAN1 signal indicating BL1=1 or UNK=1 due to color deviation, GAM=0 is provided in order not to emphasize character edges.
      <br/>
      However, in three-color and mono-color cases the operation is equivalent to that without use of color judgement signal.
    </p>
    <p num="537">
      Thus, SCR shown in FIG. 103 is LOW for portion corresponding to black or intermediate saturation character edge portion (as well as colored character edge portion in case of FIG. 4).
      <br/>
      For these portions, PW4 is provided as LDR signal.
      <br/>
      If judgement as character edge portion is given at this time, PW4 is not used in case of character edge portion (CAN=1) in order to prevent degradation of the recorded image quality due to emphasis of color deviation.

    <p num="538">In the embodiment shown in FIG. 103, if C0 (i.e., lower bit of CMODE signal) is other than "1", i.e., if in a color mode other than the four-color mode, DSCR is determined solely by EDGE without any bearing on color judgement signals BL1, UNK1 and CAN1.</p>
    <p num="539">Now, a different example of character edge judgement unit 107 shown in FIG. 1 will be described.</p>
    <p num="540">FIG. 104 is a block diagram showing character edge judgement circuit 11-3 in this embodiment.</p>

      In this construction, EDGE=1 as output when and only when EDGE0'="1" and DOT1'="0".

      Pixel, color judgement unit 1101 generates, for each pixel, BLP signal indicating black, COL signal indicating a color trace, and UNK signal indicating obscurity, these signals being supplied to area processing unit 1102.
      <br/>
      Area processing unit 1102 executes area judgement of BLP, COLP, UNKP and G signals in a 5-by-5 area including a given pixel to remove errors, thus generating BL, COL and UNK signals as well as CAN signal.
    </p>
    <p num="548">
      Character edge judgement unit 1103 executes judgement as to whether a portion is a character edge portion according to G signal and generates EDGE signal.
      <br/>
      The reason for making judgement as to whether a portion is a character edge portion according to the sole G signal is as follows.
      <br/>
      As shown in FIG. 7, among R, G and B signals G signal is closest to the spectral luminous efficiency characteristic, and therefore it can represent character edge detection signal of white/black image.
      <br/>
      With this embodiment, it is possible to simplify the construction.
    </p>
    <p num="549">The construction of FIG. 105 is obtained by adding conversion unit 1104 to the construction of FIG. 95 to permit character edge judgement with increased accuracy.</p>
    <p num="550">FIG. 106 is a view for supplementary explanation of the reason for altering the values of constants ka, kb, kc, ia, ib and ic according to the output of the MAX/MIN detection circuit shown in FIG. 106.</p>
    <p num="551">
      Generally, a full-color sensor has a peculier color balance deviation.
      <br/>
      Therefore, if colored/color-free judgement is made for all color hues with the same judgement standards, it will result in erroneous judgement.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, the three-dimensional space of R-G-B is divided into three, as shown in FIG. 13, to cope with the balance characteristic of the sensor.
      <br/>
      More specifically, the three-dimensional space of R-G-B is divided into area 5702 with MIN=R, area 5703 with MIN=G and area 5704 with MIN=B, and corresponding values of ka, kb, kc, ia, ib and ic are used.
    </p>
    <p num="552">
      For example, for a sensor, with which R component signal is rather low, the values of KAR, KBR, KCR, iAR, iBR and iCR in FIG. 13 are set to be slightly greater.
      <br/>
      By so doing, in case of MIN=R it is possible in the area shown in FIG. 12-1 to make area A wide and area C narrow.
      <br/>
      In this way, it is possible to cope with various sensors sofisticatedly.

    <p num="553">Subtractors 1310 to 1312 and comparators 1316 to 1318 judge magnitude relations between MAX-ka and 2MIN, between MAX-kb and MIN and between MAX-kc and MIN2.</p>

    <p num="559">Flip-flop 1843 effects synchronization of DOT1 in main scanning and provides EDGE0' and DOT1'.</p>
    <p num="560">

      <br/>
      Further, by varying the above operations according to the color processing mode it is possible to obtain clear output image due to optimum processing for each color processing mode.

      At this moment, DSCR in FIG. 38 will be described in greater detail.
      <br/>
      DSCR in FIG. 38 is LOW for black or intermediate saturation character edge portions corresponding to black toner development.
      <br/>
      Only for these portions, PW4 is selected, and LDR signal is provided.
      <br/>
      Even if judgement as character edge portion is provided in this case, PW4 signal is not used in case of character edge portion with color deviation (CAN=1) in order to prevent degradation of recorded image quality due to emphasis of color deviation.
    </p>
    <p num="571">This is based on a viewpoint that it is black character edge that is required to be a sharp character edge and in case of colored character edge reproduction of the color hue of original is more important.</p>
    <p num="572">
      Meanwhile, in black character edge portion the tonors of M, C and Y are not present as shown in FIG. 25-1. Further, in colored character Bk toner is hardly present due to the action of UCR circuit 105.
      <br/>
      Further, in intermediate saturation character edge portion both Bk toner and M, C and Y toners are adequately present as shown in FIG. 25-2. FIG. 110 shows a different example of screen switching signal generation unit 111.
    </p>
    <p num="573">By taking the above features into considerations, in this embodiment the character edge judgement unit is permitted to use pulse width modulation signal PW4 of one-pixel cycle period for laser driving only for Bk toner.</p>
    <p num="574">
      This permits realization of sharpness comparable to that obtainable with the first embodiment for black character edges, in which there are intrinsically less color components.
      <br/>
      In addition, with color character edges in which color components are slightly contained, only Bk component is recorded sharply, graduation of color components can be maintained, and satisfactory color reproducibility can be ensured.

      Gate 4401 decodes that 2-bit PHASE signal is "3", i.e., the developing color is Bk, and its output is made an output permission singal for NAND gate 4402.

      The other gates are the same as those in FIG. 39, and SCR signal is "0" when and only when a portion in consideration is a character edge portion and the developing color is Bk.

    <p num="577">In the above embodiment full-color images are dealt with for judgement, and the invention is of course effective as well for white/black images.</p>
    <p num="578">
      In the above embodiment G signal is used, and this gives rise to a problem that character edges are difficultly detected with yellow characters.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, as shown in FIG. 111, calculator 1000 may be provided to perform calculation on three signals of R, G and B such that, for instance, Y=aR+bG+cB (a, b and c being constants) to obtain edge detection with respect to y.

      As has been shown, with this embodiment it is possible to reliably determine intermediate saturation areas with flat density, dots for representing intermediate tone in input image and edges of characters and drawings.

      Further, the principles of the invention are of course applicable to apparatuses other than copiers.
    </p>
    <p num="581">Further, with the above embodiment it is possible to cope sofisticatedly with photograph images, character images and character/photograph images for optimum processing by altering black character processing according to mode signal.</p>
    <p num="582">
      The mode setting is not limited to the above example, but it is possible to consider various other modes such as gloss mode and gloss removal mode.
      <br/>
      Further, the processing altered according to mode is not limited to the black character processing (character edge detection, dot detection, etc.), but it is possible to consider various other image processings such as alteration of screen signal.
    </p>
    <p num="583">Further, although the above embodiment concerned a digital color copying apparatus, the invention is of course applicable to various other image processing apparatuses as well as noted before.</p>
    <p num="584">Further, with the above embodiment by permitting independent selection of sharpness for M, C and Y and that for Bk, adequate image quality can be obtained by providing particularly strong sharpness for Bk.</p>
    <p num="585">More specifically, by permitting independent setting of sharpness of each of a plurality of color component signals including Bk (black) signal, it is possible to obtain image with enhanced black or otherwise improve the image quality.</p>
    <p num="586">Further, with this embodiment it is possible to obtain images with adequate sharpness according to use or taste by permitting independent selection of the sharpness for character portions and that for photograph portions, i.e., by permitting continuous and independent setting of the sharpness of input image according to the kind thereof (for instance character image, photograph image, character/photograph image, etc.).</p>
    <p num="587">The strength of sharpness may be set by key input to the operation unit or from a keyboard of a computer when the apparatus is connected thereto.</p>
    <p num="588">Further, the setting ranges are not limited to specific examples in the above embodiment, and it is possible to freely vary the size, type and coefficients of the spatial filter.</p>
    <p num="589">While the above embdiments of the ivention concerned color copiers, this is by no means limitative, and the invention is applicable as well to other apparatuses, for instance a scanner alone or an image processing unit alone without any scanner.</p>
    <p num="590">Further in the above embodiment the image processing is switched by switching spacial filters, switching  GAMMA  or switching screens (i.e., numbers of lines), and according to the invention it is possible to permit a sole one of such processings.</p>
    <p num="591">Further, while an electrophotographic color printer has been dealt with, this is by no means limitative, and the invention is applicable as well to other printers such as a thermal printer or ink jet printer or bubble jet printer.</p>
    <p num="592">As has been shown, with the above embodiment it is possible to obtain reliable separation judgement of dot image areas and characters or drawings.</p>
    <p num="593">The mode switching in the above embodiment may be done for various processes such as filter processing, gamma conversion, UCR-Masking coefficients.</p>
    <p num="594">As shown above, with the above embodiment adequate image processings can be permitted according to various printing modes.</p>
    <p num="595">Further, since judgement conditions of judgement means for judging character portion or half-tone portion are set for a designated area in image under consideration, for an area subject to erroneous judgement in the above judgement satisfactory judgement can be obtained by controlling the judgement means, for instance inputting judgement conditions suited to such area.</p>
    <p num="596">Further, since spatial filter means or density conversion means for processing input image signal is controlled according to the degree of color or freedom from color in imput image signal, it is possible to provide selective edge emphasis to predetermined image, for instance black characters alone.</p>
    <p num="597">Further, it is possible to control character edge judgement standards by operation of the operation unit.</p>
    <p num="598">
      Further, it is possible to discriminate color impurity portions contained in the neighborhood of colored edge portions of original and color-free or intermediate saturation signal.
      <br/>
      Thus, when recording an image colorfree edge portions can be recorded sharply using much black toner.
      <br/>
      On the other hand, for colored edge portions high saturation image recording is possible without use of unnecessary black toner.
    </p>
    <p num="599">Thus, with the above embodiment it is possible to permit satisfactory judgement of colored character portions and improve the quality thereof.</p>
    <p num="600">As has been described in the foregoing, with the above embodiment it is possible to permit image processing for reproducing image of very excellent quality.</p>
