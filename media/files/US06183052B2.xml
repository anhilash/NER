      An apparatus for controlling the turning behavior of a vehicle controls the braking forces of diagonally located wheels of the vehicle independently of depression of a brake pedal to produce a target braking force difference between the controlled wheels when the vehicle is turning, thereby applying a desired yaw moment to the vehicle.
      <br/>

    <p num="1">
      1.
      <br/>
      Field of the Invention
    </p>
    <p num="2">This invention relates to an apparatus and method for properly controlling the braking forces applied to the wheels of a motor vehicle when the vehicle is turning, to stabilize turning behavior of the vehicle.</p>
    <p num="3">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
    <p num="4">
      A control apparatus for a motor vehicle disclosed in Unexamined Japanese Patent Publication (KOKAI) No. 8-310360, for example, controls the braking forces applied to a pair of diagonally located wheels when the vehicle is turning, to produce a difference of braking force between these wheels.
      <br/>
      Such a difference in braking force acts upon the vehicle as a turning moment or a returning moment.
      <br/>
      The turning moment serves to cancel out understeer of the vehicle, while the returning moment serves to cancel out oversteer of the vehicle, whereby the turning behavior of the vehicle is stabilized.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      The difference of braking force to be produced between the pair of controlled wheels is determined in accordance with the turning state, that is, required yaw moment, of the vehicle.
      <br/>
      If, however, the driver further depresses the brake pedal after the difference between the braking forces to be applied to the controlled wheels is determined, the braking forces applied to all wheels of the vehicle increase, with the result that a desired difference cannot be produced between the braking forces applied to the controlled wheels.
      <br/>
      In the above control apparatus, therefore, if the brake pedal is further depressed while the vehicle is turning, the turning behavior control is canceled at this point of time.
    </p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="6">An object of this invention is to provide a control apparatus and a control method which permit both turning behavior control of a motor vehicle and braking force control based on driver's operation of the brake pedal to be performed in a compatible manner.</p>
    <p num="7">
      An apparatus for carrying out a control method according to this invention comprises wheel brakes provided for the respective wheels, each of the wheel brakes being supplied with a braking pressure and applying a braking force to a corresponding one of the wheels; an adjusting device connected to the wheel brakes, the adjusting device being capable of adjusting the braking pressures of two, right and left wheels, among the wheels, independently of driver's braking operation; a detection device for the vehicle, the detection device including a plurality of sensors arranged in the vehicle and detecting a traveling state of the vehicle based on outputs from the sensors when the vehicle is turning; brake controllers connected to brake circuits for supplying the braking pressures to the wheel brakes, respectively, and detecting fluid pressures in the brake circuits which are indicative of actual braking pressures in the wheel brakes, respectively; and a control device connected to the detection device and the brake controllers.
      <br/>
      The control device receives outputs of the detection device and the brake controllers and performs the following operations:
    </p>
    <p num="8">The control device sets a target braking force difference to be produced between right and left wheels, selects one of the right and left wheels as a controlled wheel, determines a target braking pressure for the controlled wheel based on the target braking force difference and the actual braking pressure of a non-selected one of the right and left wheels, and controls the actual braking pressure of the controlled wheel by means of the adjusting device in accordance with the target braking pressure, thereby producing the target braking force difference between the right and left wheels and applying yaw moment to the vehicle.</p>
    <p num="9">
      With the above control apparatus, even if the braking operation by the driver changes after the target braking force difference for the controlled wheel is determined, the actual braking pressure of the controlled wheel is controlled taking account of the actual braking pressure of the non-selected wheel.
      <br/>
      Consequently, the target braking force difference can be produced with accuracy between the controlled wheel and the non-selected wheel, whereby a desired yaw moment is applied to the vehicle and thus the turning behavior of the vehicle is stabilized.
    </p>
    <p num="10">The control device preferably performs feedback control such that the actual braking pressure of the controlled wheel becomes equal to the target braking pressure.</p>
    <p num="11">Still preferably, the controlled wheel and the non-selected wheel are an outer front wheel and an inner rear wheel as viewed in a turning direction of the vehicle, respectively.</p>
    <p num="12">
      The detection device may include, as the aforementioned sensors, a yaw rate sensor for detecting a yaw rate of the vehicle, wheel speed sensors for detecting speeds of the wheels, a longitudinal acceleration sensor for detecting a longitudinal acceleration of the vehicle, a lateral acceleration sensor for detecting a lateral acceleration of the vehicle, and an angle sensor for detecting a rotational angle of a steering wheel of the vehicle.
      <br/>
      In this case, the detection device may further include a state-of-motion calculation circuit for calculating a state of motion of the vehicle based on outputs supplied thereto from the yaw rate sensor, the wheel speed sensors, the longitudinal acceleration sensor and the lateral acceleration sensor, and outputting a result of calculation, and a driving operation calculation circuit for calculating a state of driver's driving operation based on an output of the angle sensor supplied thereto, and outputting a result of calculation.
      <br/>
      This detection device can accurately detect the traveling state of the vehicle.
    </p>
    <p num="13">
      The adjusting device may include automatic brake circuits connecting an air tank containing compressed air to the wheel brakes, and may further include a supply valve, a pressure control valve and an air over hydraulic booster arranged in each of the automatic brake circuits in series from an air tank side.
      <br/>
      Specifically, the supply valve comprises a normally-open, solenoid-operated on-off valve and supplies compressed air from the air tank to the corresponding automatic brake circuit when opened.
      <br/>
      The pressure control valve adjusts pressure of the compressed air supplied from the corresponding supply valve and supplies the adjusted air pressure to the corresponding air over hydraulic booster.
      <br/>
      The air over hydraulic booster converts the air pressure supplied from the corresponding pressure control valve to hydraulic pressure, to thereby generate a braking pressure in a corresponding one of the wheel brakes.
      <br/>
      A brake system including such automatic brake circuits is suited for use in a heavy-duty vehicle such as a truck or bus.
    </p>
    <p num="14">Preferably, the detectors each detect an air pressure in the corresponding automatic brake circuit at a location more upstream than the corresponding air over hydraulic booster.</p>
    <p num="15">
      Further scope of applicability of the present invention will become apparent from the detailed description given hereinafter.
      <br/>
      However, it should be understood that the detailed description and specific example, while indicating preferred embodiment of the invention, are given by way of illustration only, since various changes and modifications within the spirit and scope of the invention will become apparent to those skilled in the art from this detailed description.

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading>
    <p num="17">
      Referring to FIG. 1, there is illustrated a brake system applied to a heavy-duty motor vehicle 1 such as a truck or bus.
      <br/>
      The vehicle 1 has front wheels WFL and WFR for steering, and double tire-type rear wheels WRL and WRR as driving wheels.
      <br/>
      Each wheel is provided with a wheel brake 2, which is connected to a corresponding air over hydraulic booster 4 through hydraulic piping 3.
      <br/>
      The boosters 4 transmit air pressures applied thereto to the brake fluid in the respective hydraulic pipes 3, that is, in the respective wheel brakes 2.
      <br/>
      The boosters 4 can thus be applied with air pressures from respective pneumatic pipes 8.
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      The pneumatic pipes 8 are connected to respective double check valves 12.
      <br/>
      More specifically, each double check valve 12 has two inlet ports and one outlet port, and each pneumatic pipe 8 is connected to the outlet port of the corresponding double check valve 12.
      <br/>
      A connecting pipe 13 extends from one of the inlet ports of each double check valve 12.
      <br/>
      The two connecting pipes 13 for the front wheels WFL and WFR are connected to a front relay valve 14F, and the two connecting pipes 13 for the rear wheels WRL and WRR are connected to a rear relay valve 14R.
      <br/>
      Supply pipes 24 extend from the respective relay valves 14F and 14R and are connected to corresponding air tanks 6, respectively.
      <br/>
      Namely, the boosters 4 associated with the front wheels and the boosters 4 associated with the rear wheels are connected to the respective air tanks 6 so that the two boosters associated with the front or rear wheels can be supplied with air pressure from the same air tank 6.
      <br/>
      Each air tank 6 is supplied with compressed air from a compressor which is driven by the engine of the vehicle.
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      The relay valves 14 each have an input port, and pilot pipes 16 for the front and rear wheels extend from the respective input ports.
      <br/>
      The pilot pipes 16 are connected to a dual brake valve 18.
      <br/>
      The brake valve 18 has two valve chambers (not shown) which are connected to the respective air tanks 6.
    </p>
    <p num="20">
      A connecting pipe 20 extends from the other of the inlet ports of each double check valve 12.
      <br/>
      The two connecting pipes 20 for the front wheels are connected to a front supply valve 22F, and the two connecting pipes 20 for the rear wheels are connected to a rear supply valve 22R.
      <br/>
      The supply valves 22F and 22R are connected to the corresponding supply pipes 24.
      <br/>
      More specifically, each supply pipe 24 bifurcates at a downstream portion thereof, and the relay valve 14 and the supply valve 22 are connected to the respective branches.
    </p>
    <p num="21">Thus, the brake system is provided with service brake circuits and automatic brake circuits: the service brake circuits include the pneumatic lines having the relay valves 14, the pilot pressure lines and the hydraulic lines, while the automatic brake circuits include the pneumatic lines having the supply valves 22, and the hydraulic lines.</p>
    <p num="22">The service brake circuits function as follows:</p>
    <p num="23">
      When the driver steps on a brake pedal 26, the brake valve 18 is set in operation.
      <br/>
      The brake valve 18 supplies the air pressure, supplied thereto from the air tanks 6, to the input ports of the relay valves 14F and 14R respectively through the pilot pipes 16 as signal pressure.
      <br/>
      The relay valves 14 are opened such that their opening corresponds to the signal pressure, that is, the force of depression, or the depression stroke, of the brake pedal 26.
      <br/>
      With the relay valves 14 thus opened, air pressure is supplied from the air tanks 6 to the boosters 4 through the supply pipes 24, the connecting pipes 13 and the pneumatic pipes 8.
      <br/>
      The boosters 4 convert the air pressure to hydraulic pressure, which is then transmitted to the brake fluid in the respective hydraulic pipes 3.
      <br/>
      As a result, braking pressure builds up inside the wheel brakes 2 and braking force is applied to the wheels WFL, WFR, WRL and WRR.
    </p>
    <p num="24">
      As the driver decreases or increases the depression stroke of the brake pedal 26, the signal pressure supplied from the brake valve 18 to the relay valves 14F and 14R varies in response to such a change in the depression stroke, whereby the braking force applied to the individual wheels is adjusted.
      <br/>
      If the brake pedal 26 is released from depression, the brake valve 18 stops the supply of the signal pressure, thereby closing the relay valves 14.
      <br/>
      When the relay valves 14 are thus closed, compressed air in the pneumatic lines extending from the relay valves 14 to the boosters 4 are released from the relay valves 14 into the atmosphere, and accordingly, the braking pressure of the individual wheels drops to a non-braked level.
    </p>
    <p num="25">
      The automatic brake circuits operate independently of the driver's braking operation, and can apply a braking force to each wheel.
      <br/>
      More specifically, when the supply valves 22F and 22R are opened, air pressure is supplied from the air tanks 6 to the boosters 4, with the result that braking pressure builds up inside the individual wheel brakes 2.
    </p>
    <p num="26">
      The supply valves 22 are electrically connected to an electronic control unit (ECU) 28 and their opening/closing operation is controlled by the ECU 28.
      <br/>
      Each supply valve 22 has two built-in solenoid-operated valves (hereinafter referred to as solenoid valves), each of which comprises a three-port, two-position directional control valve.
      <br/>
      More specifically, each solenoid valve has an inlet port, an outlet port and a discharge port.
      <br/>
      In the supply valve 22F for the front wheels, the inlet ports of the two solenoid valves are connected to the supply pipe 24 associated therewith, while the outlet ports of the same are connected to the respective two connecting pipes 20 associated therewith.
      <br/>
      Also in the supply valve 22R for the rear wheels, the inlet and outlet ports of the two solenoid valves are connected in a similar manner.
      <br/>
      In FIG. 1, the electrical connection between the ECU 28 and each supply valve 22 is indicated by a single line for simplicity of illustration.

      When the solenoid valve is in a rest position, communication between the inlet and outlet ports thereof is blocked, while the outlet and discharge ports communicate with each other.

      On the other hand, when the solenoid valve is shifted from the rest position to an operating position, communication between the inlet and outlet ports is established while communication between the outlet and discharge ports is blocked.
      <br/>
      As a result, air pressure is supplied from the air tank 6 to the booster 4 via the supply valve 22, so that braking pressure builds up in the wheel brake 2 of the wheel associated therewith.

      The ECU 28 can operate the individual solenoid valves of the supply valves 22F and 22R independently of one another in such a manner that braking force is applied to only one of the front or rear wheels.

      Namely, the ECU 28 can apply braking force to a desired wheel.

      The automatic brake circuits are further provided with pressure control valves 10, each of which is inserted in the corresponding pneumatic pipe 8 connecting the booster 4 and double check valve 12 associated therewith, as shown in FIG. 1.

      Like the aforementioned supply valves 22, each of the pressure control valves 10 has two solenoid valves built therein.
      <br/>
      FIG. 2 specifically shows the two solenoid valves 10a and 10b in each pressure control valve 10, and the solenoid valves 10a and 10b are arranged in order such that the former is closer to the double check valve 12 than the latter is.
      <br/>
      The solenoid valve 10a is a solenoid-operated on-off valve, while the solenoid valve 10b is a three-port, two-position directional control valve.

      When the solenoid valves 10a and 10b are each in a rest position as illustrated in FIG. 2, the pneumatic pipe 8 is open.
      <br/>
      In this case, air pressure can be supplied to the booster 4 through the pneumatic pipe 8.
      <br/>
      On the other hand, when the solenoid valve 10a is shifted from the rest position to an operating position, a portion of the pneumatic pipe 8 between the solenoid valve 10a and the booster 4 is pneumatically isolated.
      <br/>
      In this case, the air pressure in the booster 4 is maintained.

    <p num="30">
      If the solenoid valve 10b, in addition to the solenoid valve 10a, is shifted from the rest position to an operating position, a portion of the pneumatic pipe 8 between the solenoid valve lob and the booster 4 communicates with the atmosphere through the discharge port of the solenoid valve 10b.
      <br/>
      Consequently, the air pressure in the booster 4 is released into the atmosphere and the braking pressure inside the wheel brake 2 drops.

    </p>
    <p num="35">Yaw moment control for the vehicle will be now briefly explained below.</p>
    <p num="36">
      A basic concept of the yaw moment control is to produce a difference of braking force between the right and left wheels when the vehicle is turning.
      <br/>
      Specifically, a difference of braking force is generated between the left and right wheels of the vehicle and the right front wheel WFR and the left rear wheel WRL.
      <br/>
      Such a braking force difference acts upon the vehicle as turning moment that assists the vehicle turn, or returning moment that counteracts the vehicle turn.
      <br/>
      Consequently, an actual yaw moment of the vehicle is brought to a target yaw moment, so that the turning behavior of the vehicle is stabilized.
    </p>
    <p num="37">The wheels to be controlled by the yaw moment control are not limited to the above diagonally located wheels, and may be the right and left front wheels or the right and left rear wheels.</p>
    <p num="38">The block diagram of FIG. 3 will be now described in more detail.</p>
    <p num="39">
      The calculation block 56 calculates the state of motion of the vehicle based on sensor information such as the wheel speeds .nu.W of the respective wheels, the longitudinal acceleration GX, lateral acceleration GY and yaw rate  GAMMA  of the vehicle, etc.
      <br/>
      The state of motion of the vehicle includes a vehicle body speed .nu., slip ratios S of the respective wheels, a slip angular velocity d BETA  of the center of gravity, etc.
    </p>
    <p num="40">The calculation block 54 calculates an operational angular velocity .nu.Th and a steering angle  DELTA  of the front wheels, based on an angle Th of operation of the steering wheel 40 detected by the angle sensor 42.</p>
    <p num="41">
      Based on the vehicle body speed .nu. and the steering angle  DELTA , the calculation block 58 calculates a target yaw rate  GAMMA t of the vehicle.
      <br/>
      Specifically, the target yaw rate  GAMMA t is calculated according to the following equation (1) based on a linear two-wheel model:
      <br/>
      GAMMA t =(.nu./(1+A * .nu.2) * ( DELTA /L)  (1)
    </p>
    <p num="42">where A represents a stability factor, and L represents a wheel base (m).</p>
    <p num="43">
      Based on a deviation of an actual yaw rate  GAMMA  from the target yaw rate  GAMMA t, the calculation block 60 calculates a required yaw moment Md to be applied to the vehicle 1.
      <br/>
      The required yaw moment Md output from the calculation block 60 takes a positive or negative value depending on whether the yaw rate deviation is positive or negative.
      <br/>
      If the required yaw moment Md takes a positive value, it means that the vehicle tends to understeer, and if the required yaw moment Md takes a negative value, then it means that the vehicle tends to oversteer.
    </p>
    <p num="44">
      Further, the calculation block 60 compares the yaw rate deviation with a positive or negative threshold, and outputs the result of comparison.
      <br/>
      These thresholds serve as a condition for initiating the yaw moment control.
    </p>
    <p num="45">The function of the control block 64 will be described in detail below.</p>
    <p num="46">
      Before execution of the yaw moment control using the automatic brake circuits, the control block 64 first selects wheels to be controlled.
      <br/>
      Specifically, the outer front wheel and the inner rear wheel as viewed in the turning direction of the vehicle are selected as the wheels to be controlled.
    </p>
    <p num="47">
      Then, based on the turning direction and understeer (US) or oversteer (OS) of the vehicle, the control block 64 determines a braking pressure control mode for each of the wheels.
      <br/>
      The turning direction of the vehicle can be detected by making a determination as to whether the detected yaw rate takes a positive value or not, or based on the direction of rotation of the steering wheel 40.
    </p>
    <p num="48">TABLE 1 below shows control modes for the respective wheels.</p>
    <p num="49">

    <p num="50">
      In TABLE 1, "Plus" denotes a control mode in which the braking pressure (control air pressure) of the wheel is increased, "Minus" denotes a control mode in which the braking pressure of the wheel is decreased, and "--" denotes a mode in which the braking pressure of the wheel is not controlled.
      <br/>
      Wheels of the non-control mode are those wheels which are not controlled during the yaw moment control.
    </p>
    <p num="51">
      As is clear from TABLE 1, during the yaw moment control, the braking pressure of one of the controlled wheels is increased, while the braking pressure of the other of the controlled wheels is decreased.
      <br/>
      Consequently, there occurs a difference in braking pressure, that is, braking force, between the controlled wheels, whereby the vehicle is given turning moment or returning moment.
      <br/>
      The turning or returning moment represents the aforementioned required yaw moment Md of the vehicle, and the braking pressures of the controlled wheels are controlled in accordance with the required yaw moment.
    </p>
    <p num="52">More specifically, the control block 64 first calculates a difference between target braking forces to be produced between the left and right wheels to be controlled, in accordance with the required yaw moment Md.</p>
    <p num="53">
      Provided an amount of change in braking force of each of the diagonally located wheels to be controlled is dF and a yaw moment of the vehicle acted upon by the change dF is M, when the vehicle makes a turn with the brake pedal 26 depressed by the driver, the relationship between the change dF in braking force and the yaw moment M is given by equation (2) below.
      <br/>
      In equation (2), no consideration is given to change in the lateral force of the tire.
      <br/>
      2 * (dF * T/2)=M  (2)
    </p>
    <p num="54">where T represents a tread �m�.</p>
    <p num="55">
      The yaw moment M corresponds to half the required yaw moment Md.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, using the required yaw moment Md, the amount of change dF in braking force of one wheel to be controlled can be calculated according to equation (2).
      <br/>
      The difference between the target braking forces is twice as large as the change dF.
    </p>
    <p num="56">
      The amount of change dF in braking force can be regarded as an amount of change in the braking pressure within the wheel brake 2, that is, a controlled variable.
      <br/>
      As mentioned above, the braking pressure of the wheel brake 2 is determined by the braking air pressure supplied to the booster 4.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the change dF of braking force can be attained through control of the braking air pressure.
    </p>
    <p num="57">
      Equation (2) can be rewritten as indicated by the following equations, wherein the amount of change dF in braking force of one wheel to be controlled is expressed separately as controlled variables dPf and dPr for the braking air pressures of the front and rear wheels, respectively:
      <br/>
      dPf * Bf * Tf /2=Md /2  (3.1)
      <br/>
      dPr * Br * Tr /2=Md /2  (3.2)

    <p num="58">where Bf and Br �kgf/kgf/cm2 � represent brake factors of the front and rear wheels, respectively, and Tf and Tr �m� represent the treads of the front and rear wheels, respectively.</p>
    <p num="59">
      In the case of a heavy-duty vehicle such as a truck or bus, the brake factor and the tread greatly differ between the front and rear wheels.
      <br/>
      In controlling the braking air pressure, therefore, whether the wheel to be controlled is a front or rear wheel needs to be taken into consideration.
      <br/>
      The brake factor Bf or Br is determined based on an amount of change in the braking force actually produced in the front or rear wheel, as measured per unit change of the braking air pressure.
    </p>
    <p num="60">
      Based on the above equations (3.1) and (3.2), the controlled variables dP for the braking air pressures can be calculated according to the equations below.
      <br/>
      dPf =Md /(Bf * Tf)  (4.1)
      <br/>
      dPr =Md /(Br * Tr)  (4.2)

    <p num="61">In accordance with the control modes applied to the wheels, one of the controlled variables dPf and dPr for the braking air pressures takes a positive value while the other takes a negative value.</p>

      The controlled variables dPf and dPr for the braking air pressures, calculated in the control block 64, are supplied to the command block 68.
      <br/>
      In the command block 68, the controlled variables dPf and dPr are converted to command signals (switching signals) for the supply valves 22 and the pressure control valves 10, and the command signals are output from the command block 68 to corresponding ones of the supply valves 22 and the pressure control valves 10.
    </p>
    <p num="63">
      FIG. 4 shows details of the command block 68.
      <br/>
      The command block 68 generates command signals for the individual wheels to be controlled.
      <br/>
      Where one of the wheels to be controlled is the left front wheel WFL, command signals for the supply valve 22 and the pressure control valve 10 associated with the left front wheel WFL are generated as explained below.
    </p>
    <p num="64">
      Assuming that the vehicle 1 is turning to the right while being braked, the braking air pressure for the right front wheel WFR is determined by the stroke of depression of the brake pedal 26 by the driver, that is, the opening of the relay valve 14f operated in accordance with the signal pressure from the brake valve 18.
      <br/>
      In this case, an actual braking air pressure Pof of the right front wheel WFR corresponds to the air pressure output from the relay valve 14f.
      <br/>
      As shown in FIG. 4, the actual braking air pressure Pof of the right front wheel WFR, detected by the sensor 44, is supplied to the control system for controlling the braking air pressure of the left front wheel WFL.
    </p>
    <p num="65">
      The control system for the left front wheel WFL has an adding section 72.
      <br/>
      The adding section 72 adds up the actual braking air pressure Pof and the controlled variable dPf for the braking air pressure of the left front wheel WFL output from the control block 64, and supplies a subtracting section 74 with a target braking air pressure Ptf for the left front wheel WFL.
      <br/>
      In this case, if the controlled variable dPf for the braking air pressure is positive, the target braking air pressure Ptf supplied is larger than the actual braking air pressure Pof, and if the controlled variable dPf for the braking air pressure is negative, the target braking air pressure Pttf is smaller than the actual braking air pressure Pof.
    </p>
    <p num="66">
      The subtracting section 74 calculates a deviation Per of an actual braking air pressure P of the left front wheel WFL from the target braking air pressure Ptf.

      The actual braking air pressure P of the left front wheel WFL also is detected by the sensor 44.
      <br/>
      The detection signal from the sensor 44 has already been subjected to filtering at a low-pass filter 76 in the aforementioned filtering block 52.
    </p>
    <p num="67">
      The deviation Per output from the subtracting section 74 passes through a filter 78 and then is supplied to an arithmetic section 80.
      <br/>
      The filter 78 has a dead zone and removes noise contained in the detection signal of the sensor 44 or a fine fluctuation component in the actual braking air pressure P. The dead zone of the filter 78 is defined by thresholds of, for example, .+- 0 (slashed zero) 1 kgf/cm2.
    </p>
    <p num="68">
      When the deviation Per is greater than a predetermined value, the arithmetic section 80 outputs a signal for switching the solenoid valve of the supply valve 22f associated with the left front wheel WFL.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, the connecting pipe 20 leading to the booster 4 associated with the left front wheel WFL is opened, and air pressure is supplied from the air tank 6 to the booster 4 through the connecting pipe 20 and the pneumatic pipe 8.

    <p num="69">
      The arithmetic section 80 has a bivariate map which, using the deviation Per and the actual braking air pressure P as variables, define operation modes and their execution time periods for the pressure control valve 10.

      The solenoid valves of the supply valve 22 and pressure control valve 10 associated with the left front wheel WFL are switched in accordance with outputs from the arithmetic section 80.

      Consequently, the braking force FFL of the left front wheel WFL becomes greater than the braking force FFR of the right front wheel WFR, and similarly, the braking force FRR of the right rear wheel WRR becomes smaller than the braking force FRL of the left rear wheel WRL.
      <br/>
      The difference in braking force between the right and left wheels acts on the vehicle 1 as a returning moment corresponding to the required yaw moment Md for canceling out the oversteer of the vehicle 1, with the result that the turning behavior of the vehicle is stabilized.
    </p>
    <p num="82">The braking forces of the wheels other than the controlled wheels, that is, the right front wheel WFR and the left rear wheel WRL, are determined by the stroke of depression of the brake pedal by the driver.</p>
    <p num="83">
      In the case illustrated in FIG. 7, the vehicle tends to understeer.
      <br/>
      Initiating the yaw moment control in this case makes the braking force FFL of the left front wheel WFL smaller than the braking force FFR of the right front wheel WFR and makes the braking force FRR of the right rear wheel WRR higher than the braking force FRL of the left rear wheel WRL.
      <br/>
      As a result, the vehicle 1 is acted upon by a turning moment canceling out the understeer of the vehicle, whereby the turning behavior of the vehicle 1 is stabilized.
    </p>
    <p num="84">FIGS. 8 and 9 illustrate cases where the brake pedal 26 is further depressed by the driver while the vehicle 1 is turning with the brake applied.</p>
    <p num="85">
      Specifically, FIG. 8 shows the case where, in the state shown in FIG. 6, the brake pedal 26 is further depressed.
      <br/>
      In this case, the braking forces of the right front wheel WFR and left rear wheel WRL which are the non-controlled wheels increase as the depression stroke of the brake pedal 26 increases.
      <br/>
      The braking air pressure for the left front wheel WFL, which is a wheel to be controlled, is controlled so that it may become equal to the target braking air pressure determined based on the actual braking air pressure Pof of the right front wheel WFR as mentioned above, and similarly, the braking air pressure for the right rear wheel WRR, which is the other wheel to be controlled, is also controlled so that it may become equal to the target braking air pressure determined based on the actual braking air pressure Pof of the left rear wheel WRL.
      <br/>
      Consequently, the difference in braking force between the left front wheel WFL and the right rear wheel WRR becomes equal to the target braking force difference (corresponding to 2 * dF) determined by the yaw moment control, with the result that the turning behavior of the vehicle 1 can be stabilized in a like manner.
    </p>
    <p num="86">More specifically, the adding section 72 (see FIG. 4) in the aforementioned command block 68 outputs the result of addition of the controlled variable (dPf, dPr) for the braking air pressure of the controlled wheel and the actual braking pressure (Pof, Por) of the non-controlled wheel, so that change in the actual braking pressure of the non-controlled wheel is reflected in the controlled variable for the braking air pressure.</p>
    <p num="87">
      FIG. 9 illustrates the case where, in the state shown in FIG. 7, the brake pedal 26 is further depressed.
      <br/>
      In this case, the braking forces of the left front wheel WFL and right rear wheel WRR, which are the wheels to be controlled, are controlled based on the respective target braking air pressures, that is, the target braking forces, which follow up change in braking force of the right front wheel WFR and the left rear wheel WRL.
      <br/>
      As a result, also in this case, the difference in braking force between the left front wheel WFL and the right rear wheel WRR becomes equal to the target braking force difference determined by the yaw moment control, whereby the turning behavior of the vehicle 1 can be stabilized in a like manner.
    </p>
    <p num="88">Even in the case where the stroke of depression of the brake pedal 26 is reduced, the difference in braking force between the controlled wheels is controlled so that it may become equal to the target braking force difference determined by the yaw moment control.</p>
    <p num="89">
      According to the above-described yaw moment control for stabilizing the turning behavior of the vehicle, even if the depression stroke of the brake pedal 26 changes during the yaw moment control, the target braking air pressures for the controlled wheels are determined with reference to respective actual braking air pressures of the non-controlled wheels.
      <br/>
      Consequently, the target braking force difference between the right and left wheels is properly determined, whereby the vehicle can be acted upon by a suitable required yaw moment and the depressing operation of the brake pedal 26 by the driver can be reflected in the braking of the vehicle.
    </p>
    <p num="90">Where the diagonally located wheels of the vehicle are selected as wheels to be controlled, controlling these wheels permits the vehicle to be effectively acted upon by turning moment or returning moment even If change in braking force of the controlled wheels is small.</p>
    <p num="91">
      Since the braking air pressure for each wheel is monitored by the sensor 44, the braking forces, that is, the braking air pressures, of the controlled wheels can be controlled with reliability by the yaw moment control, thus improving the reliability of the yaw moment control.
      <br/>
      Further, the braking air pressures are controlled by the pressure control valves 10 arranged immediately upstream of the respective boosters 4, and accordingly, delay in the response of the boosters 4 can be minimized.
      <br/>
      Consequently, the apparatus of this invention is suited for a brake system for a heavy-duty vehicle, such as a truck or bus, which utilizes air pressure for braking.
    </p>
    <p num="92">
      This invention is not limited to the foregoing embodiment alone.
      <br/>
      For example, sensors for detecting the braking pressures in the respective hydraulic pipes 3 may be used instead of the sensors 44.
      <br/>
      In this case, the pressure feedback system of the command block 68 may use a proportional gain for converting hydraulic pressure to air pressure.
    </p>
    <p num="93">
      Further, in addition to the sensors 44, pressure sensors for detecting the air pressures output from the relay valves 14 or the signal pressures output from the brake valve 18 may be used.
      <br/>
      Such pressure sensors detect the braking air pressures of the non-controlled wheels.
      <br/>
      Where the signal pressures output from the brake valve 18 are detected by pressure sensors, the detection signals of the pressure sensors need to be corrected by means of a proportional gain to obtain signals corresponding to the air pressures output from the relay valves 14.
    </p>
    <p num="94">Also, the brake system to be used is not limited to the aforementioned air over hydraulic brake system and may be a full air brake system.</p>
    <p num="95">
      In cases where the right and left front wheels or the right and left rear wheels are selected as wheels to be controlled, the controlled variable dP for the braking air pressure for producing the required yaw moment is calculated according to the equation below.
      <br/>
      dP=2 * Md /(B * T)
    </p>
    <p num="96">The apparatus according to this invention is equally applicable to a vehicle whose rear wheels are of a double axle type.</p>
