    <p num="1">
      1.
      <br/>
      Field of the Invention
    </p>
    <p num="2">
      This invention relates to a disposable diaper excelling in resistance to pressure and an absorbent resin excelling in resistance to pressure.
      <br/>
      Further, this invention relates to an absorbent resin preeminently excelling in affinity for aqueous liquids and exhibiting prominently improved speed of absorption and ratio of water absorption capacity under no pressure and under pressure as compared with the conventional equivalents and a method for the production thereof.
    </p>
    <p num="3">2. Description of Related Art</p>
    <p num="4">In recent years, absorbent resins capable of absorbing some ten to some hundred times their own weights of water have been developed and have been found utility in various applications requiring absorption and retention of water such as in the field of hygienic materials including sanitary goods and disposable diapers, the field of agriculture and horticulture, the field of foodstuffs requiring retention of freshness, and the field of industrial products requiring protection against dew formation and refrigeration.</p>
    <p num="5">The absorbent resins of this class have been known in various types such as, for example, a hydrolyzed starch-acrylonitrile graft polymer, neutralized starch-acrylic acid graft polymer, saponified vinyl acetate-acrylic ester copolymer, hydrolyzed acrylonitrile copolymer or the product of cross-linkage thereof, hydrolyzed acrylamide copolymer or the product of cross-linkage thereof, self-cross-linking polyacrylic acid salts, and partially neutralizing cross-linked polyacrylic acid salts.</p>
    <p num="6">
      The absorbent resin has the necessary quality thereof varied by the kind of use.
      <br/>
      As the characteristics which are required by an absorbent resin intended for such hygienic materials as disposable diaper, for example, high ratio of water absorption capacity, high speed of absorption, large capacity for permeation, etc. to be manifested to an aqueous liquid under pressure may be cited.
      <br/>
      EP 443627, for example, discloses an absorbent structure which uses an absorbent resin excelling in ratio of water absorption capacity and speed of absorption under pressure in a concentration of not less than 60 wt %. The properties of ratio of water absorption capacity and speed of absorption do not always exhibit a positive correlation.
      <br/>
      Particularly, the ratio of water absorption capacity and the speed of absorption under pressure betray antinomy.
      <br/>
      It is, therefore, difficult to have these two properties simultaneously improved.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      Addition to surface area, for example, has been tried with a view to enabling an absorbent resin to acquire a heightened speed of absorption.
      <br/>
      Attempts have been made to decrease the particle diameter of the absorbent resin or fabricate the absorbent resin in the form of granules or scales.
      <br/>
      Generally when the absorbent resin is given a decreased particle diameter with a view to adding to surface area, however, the absorbent resin conversely suffers a decrease in the ratio of water absorption capacity under pressure or under no pressure because the decrease of particle diameter degrades the physical strengths of resin and contracts the gaps between the particles of resin swelled with absorbed water.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      A technique is known which cross-links molecular chains near the surface of an absorbent resin and increases the cross-link density in the surface layer of the resin with a view to enabling the polymer, when swelled with absorbed water, to secure gaps for transfer of liquid between the particles thereof and consequently prevent the absorbent resin from decreasing the ratio of water absorption capacity even on exposure to pressure.
      <br/>
      Incidentally, the largeness of surface area and the ratio of water absorption capacity under pressure generally contradict each other such that the surface layer of resin is cross-linked uniformly based on difficulty of uniformity mixing of the resin and a cross-linking agent when the particles of resin have an increased surface area.
      <br/>
      Most of the improvements achieved to date with a view to heightening the ratio of water absorption capacity of an absorbent resin under pressure and increasing the speed of absorption thereof as well have stemmed from combinations of the two methods (increase of surface area and cross-linkage near surface) mentioned above.
      <br/>
      Regretfully, however, these improvements are incapable of yielding satisfactory results owing to the technical limit imposed by the fact that the two properties contradict each other as mentioned above.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      As a means for breaking through this technical limit by enlarging the surface area without decreasing the particle diameter, the concept of obtaining a porous polymer by using a foaming agent and so on and the technique for giving a cross-linking treatment to the proximity of the surface of the polymer have been proposed in recent years.
      <br/>
      As concrete examples of this approach, a method which comprises polymerizing a 70 mol % neutralized aqueous sodium polyacrylate solution in the presence of a cross-linking agent and a carbonate as a foaming agent and cross-linking the proximity of the surface of the produced polymer (U.S. Pat. No. 5,314,420 and JP-A-07-185331), a method which comprises polymerizing a 70 mol % neutralized aqueous potassium polyacrylate or aqueous ammonium salt solution in the presence of a cross-linking agent and a carbonate salt as a foaming agent and a cross-linking the proximity of the surface of the produced polymer (WO 9502002, U.S. Pat. No. 5,712,316 and EP 707603), a method which comprises polymerizing a partially neutralized aqueous sodium acrylate solution in the presence of a solid foaming agent in a dispersed state and giving a cross-linking treatment to the proximity of the surface of the produced polymer (EP 744435), and besides a method using foaming agents a method which comprises obtaining a sodium acrylate polymer with a porous surface by the reverse-phase suspension polymerization performed in the presence of a specific surfactant and giving a cross-linking treatment to the proximity of the surface of the polymer (EP 0695762) may be cited.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      Indeed, these methods which give a cross-linking treatment to the proximity of the surface of a porous polymer using a foaming agent have improved the ratio of water absorption capacity and the speed of absorption under pressure.

      In spite of the improvements, however, these methods still suffer degradation of the affinity of the surface of the polymer, typically porous in texture, for water because the porous polymer, on being subjected to the cross-linking treatment given to the proximity of the surface thereof, does not permit each control of the cross-link density owing to the polymer constitution itself the absorbent resin when the density of cross link in the surface is increased for the purpose of heightening the ratio of water absorption capacity under pressure.
      <br/>
      In spite of deliberate use of the porous polymer, therefore, there are problems of ultimate degradation of the speed of absorption.
    </p>
    <p num="11">
      It has been heretofore known to use such absorbent resin as exhibits a high ratio of water absorption capacity under pressure under load for disposable diapers.
      <br/>
      The loads proposed to date for use in the determination of a ratio of water absorption capacity, a factor typically representing physical properties fit for actual use of a relevant absorbent resin in diapers include 10 g/cm2 (JP-A-60-135432), 0.3 psi (about 20 g/cm2, EP 0339461), 50 g/cm2 (JP-A-63-99861), 63000 dynes/cm2 (about 50 g/cm2, WO 9511932, U.S. Pat. No. 5,684,106),60 g/cm2 (EP 707603), total of minimum 0.01 --maximum of 0.7 psi (total of about 0.7 g/cm2 --maximum of 63 g/cm2, U.S. Pat. No. 5,601,542), and 0.6 through 1 psi (about 43 g/cm2 through about 71 g/cm2, JP-A-08-510484, U.S. Pat. No. 5,629,377), for example.
      <br/>
      The absorbent resins which reflect these specific loads have been disclosed there.
      <br/>
      Among these conventional absorbent resins, those which exhibit the highest ratios of water absorption capacity under pressure are the absorbent resin manifesting a ratio of 25.9 g/g under a load of 1 psi (about 71 g/cm2) (Test Run 6e of JP-A- 09-501975, WO 9505856) and the absorbent resin manifesting a ratio of 8 ml/g under a load of 1.7 psi (about 121 g/cm2) (Table B of EP 0339461).
      <br/>
      While these absorbent resins manifest ratios of water absorption exceeding 30 g/g under relatively low pressure, these ratios of water absorption capacity under load notably fall generally as the load increases (U.S. Pat. No. 5,601,542, EP 0707603, U.S. Pat. No. 5,629,377, and Table B of EP 0339461).
      <br/>
      When the load increases from 0.3 psi to 0.6 psi, for example, the ratio of water absorption capacity under pressure in most cases falls notably to not more than one half.
      <br/>
      The resins under a load of 100 g/cm2 (about 1.4 psi) manifested a capacity for absorption of not more than 10 g/g, or not more than 20 g/g at most, even when the surface area of resin was increased for getting preeminently speed of absorption.
      <br/>
      Regretfully, the conventional techniques have not fully satisfied the needs of the market for an absorbent resin manifesting high ratio of water absorption capacity under pressure and fair speed of absorption under still higher pressure, i.e. conditions necessary for a disposable diaper of high performance.
      <br/>
      Thus, an absorbent resin which satisfactorily reconciles the two factors, i.e. ratio of water absorption capacity and speed of absorption, remains yet to be completed.
    </p>
    <p num="12">
      In the case of a disposable diaper, since a baby wearing one incessantly moves about and, therefore, exerts unsteady load thereon, there are times when even an absorbent resin manifesting a due ratio of water absorption capacity under high pressure fails to exhibit a stable capacity for absorption to pressure.
      <br/>
      Simply because an absorbent resin manifests a due ratio of water absorption capacity under a load of 10 to some tens of g/cm2 which is estimated from the standard body weight (about 10 kg) of a baby, when incorporated in an actual diaper, is suspected that the absorbent resin fails to bring about a fully satisfactory result in disposable diapers.
      <br/>
      When the ratio of water absorption capacity under pressure which has been determined by simply varying the load (10--some tens of g/cm2) as practiced heretofore is relied on to rate or screen a given absorbent resin, it does not serve as a reliable index for the performance of the absorbent resin such as in disposable diapers.
      <br/>
      For the purpose of final evaluation of an absorbent resin intended for use in a diaper, the determination of the absorbent resin for such physical properties as ratio of water absorption capacity under pressure is not satisfactory.
      <br/>
      As things now stand, it is after all necessary to spend cost, time, and labor copiously to manufacture diapers and subject them to a test by monitors.
    </p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="13">It is an object of this invention is to provide an absorbent resin which enjoys heretofore unattainable excellent absorption properties perfectly reconciling the two factors, ratio of water absorption capacity and speed of absorption under pressure, at a very high level approximating the known technical boundaries.</p>
    <p num="14">A further object of this invention is to provide a method for the production of an absorbent resin which manifests a high ratio of water absorption capacity under no pressure and under pressure and a high speed of absorption under no pressure and under pressure.</p>
    <p num="15">Still another object of this invention is to provide a pressure-resistant absorbent resin which manifests such a high ratio of water absorption capacity as has never been attained by any conventional absorbent resin under high pressure of 100 g/cm2, incurs a decline of the ratio of water absorption capacity only sparingly owing to addition to the pressure, and manifests a fully satisfactory ratio of water absorption capacity.</p>
    <p num="16">Yet another object of this invention is to provide a disposable diaper which uses the pressure-resistant absorbent resin mentioned above and, therefore, manifests a high ratio of water absorption capacity even when a baby wearing this diaper moves about and exerts incessantly varying load thereon, suffers leakage of urine only sparingly, and offers a large capacity for absorption.</p>
    <p num="17">The invention has a further object of providing an absorbent resin which manifests a high ratio of water absorption capacity under pressure in spite of a large surface area of the particles thereof.</p>
    <p num="18">Besides, it is an object of this invention to provide a parameter for an absorbent resin which is correlated with the actual use of a diaper in the determination of physical properties of the absorbent resin.</p>
    <p num="19">The objects mentioned above are accomplished by the following items (1)-(6).</p>
    <p num="20">(1) An absorbent resin produced by adding a compound having a plurality of functional groups capable of reacting with a group represented by formula --COOR in which each R is independently hydrogen atoms, metal atoms or ammonium to an absorbent cross-linked polymer having a --COOR group of 12 mmol/g or more and a molecular ratio of --COOH/--COOR of not more than 0.5.</p>
    <p num="21">(2) An absorbent resin having the proximity of the surface thereof subjected to a cross-linking treatment with a compound having a plurality of functional groups capable of reacting with a group represented by formula --COOR in which each R is independently hydrogen atoms, metal atoms or ammonium, having a --COOR group in a concentration of 12 mmol/g or more and a molecular ratio of --COOH/--COOR of not more than 0.5.</p>
    <p num="22">(3) An absorbent resin having a BET specific surface area of 0.03 m2 /g or more and a ratio of water absorption capacity under high pressure of 25 g/g or more to artificial urine under a load of 100 g/cm2.</p>
    <p num="23">(4) A pressure-resistant absorbent resin manifesting a ratio of water absorption capacity under pressure of 30 g/g or more to artificial urine under a load of 50 g/cm2, and a pressure-resistant absorption ratio of 0.6 or more, wherein said pressure-resistant absorption ratio is defined as the ratio of said ratio of water absorption capacity under high pressure to artificial urine under a load of 100 g/cm2 to a ratio of water absorption capacity under pressure to artificial urine under a load of 50 g/cm2.</p>
    <p num="24">(5) A disposable diaper using a pressure-resistant absorbent resin manifesting a ratio of water absorption capacity under pressure of 30 g/g or more to artificial urine under a load of 50 g/cm2, and a pressure-resistant absorption ratio of 0.6 or more, wherein said pressure-resistant absorption ratio is defined as the ratio of said ratio of water absorption capacity under high pressure to artificial urine under a load of 100 g/cm2 to a ratio of water absorption capacity under pressure to artificial urine under a load of 50 g/cm2.</p>
    <p num="25">(6) A method for the production of an absorbent resin, characterized by adding a compound having a plurality of functional groups capable of reacting with a group represented by formula --COOR in which each R is independently hydrogen atoms, metal atoms or ammonium to an absorbent cross-linked polymer having a --COOR group of 12 mmol/g or more and a molecular ratio of --COOH/--COOR of not more than 0.5 and heating the resultant mixture.</p>
    <p num="26">Surprisingly, this invention, by using as a base polymer a polymer of improved --COOR density, namely an absorbent cross-linked polymer containing --COOR groups in a concentration of 12 mmol/g or more and having a molecular ratio of --COOH/--COOR of not more than 0.5., allows a notable increase of the speed of absorption without a decrease in the speed of absorption even after the secondary cross-linking treatment performed in the proximity of the surface.</p>
    <p num="27">Further, the absorbent cross-linked polymer of improved----COOR density mentioned above allows production of an absorbent resin which shows a notable reduction in the time required for the secondary cross-linking treatment irrespectively of the morphology, namely the choice among such forms as spherical particles, crushed particles, scaly particles, and porous particles and manifests speed of absorption and ratio of water absorption capacity under no pressure or under pressure at fully satisfactorily reconciling levels as compared with those obtained heretofore.</p>
    <p num="28">
      The polymer of improved --COOR density as the base polymer, namely the absorbent cross-linked polymer containing --COOR groups in a concentration of 12 mmol/g or more and having a molecular ratio of --COOH/--COOR of not more than 0.5., is subjected to surface cross-linkage using a covalent cross-linking agent and then the resultant absorbent resin is caused to have the ratio of water absorption capacity thereof under no load lowered to 0.9-0.3 times the level which existed prior to the cross-linkage.
      <br/>
      Producing these absorbent resin, it is obtained a novel pressure-resistant absorbent resin which manifests such a high ratio of water absorption capacity under pressure as has never been attained by the conventional absorbent resin even under a load of 100 g/cm2 and shows an extremely small decrease in the capacity for absorption in spite of a notable increase of load from 50 g/cm2 to 100 g/cm2, namely a product which possesses a high pressure-resistant absorption ratio and manifests highly satisfactory absorption under load of any level.
    </p>
    <p num="29">Further, use of this pressure-resistant absorbent resin permits production of a disposable diaper which manifests a high ratio of water absorption capacity under pressure, suffers leakage of urine only sparingly, and enjoys a large capacity for absorption even when the load incessantly moves about and varies.</p>
    <p num="30">
      This invention has established that not only the ratio of water absorption capacity under pressure to artificial urine under a load of 50 g/cm2 proposed to date but also the pressure-resistant absorption ratio defined as the ratio of the ratio of water absorption capacity under high pressure to artificial urine under a load of 100 g/m2 to the ratio of water absorption capacity under pressure of 50g/cm2 mentioned below, namely the ratio; (the ratio of water absorption capacity under high pressure to artificial urine under a load of 100 g/cm2) (the ratio of water absorption capacity under pressure to artificial urine under a load of 50 g/cm2), serves as an important index for the acceptability of a given absorbent resin for use in a disposable diaper.
      <br/>
      That is to say, while it has been known that the ratio of water absorption capacity under pressure is lowered by increasing the load, this invention has established that the stability of the ratio of water absorption capacity under specific levels of pressure (100 g/cm2 and 50 g/cm2) is important for a disposable diaper.
    </p>
    <p num="31">
      The present invention has perfected for the first time an absorbent resin manifesting such a high ratio of cubical absorption as 23 g/g under high pressure in spite of such a large specific surface area as not less than 0.3 m2 /g and has also discovered that this novel absorbent resin is used highly effectively in a disposable diaper.
      <br/>
      Further, this invention has established that this parameter of the absorbent resin is very satisfactorily correlated with the result of actual use of the disposable diaper (the results of evaluation of disposable diapers by monitors).

    <heading>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading>
    <p num="32">FIG. 1 illustrates a device used in the present invention for the determination of the ratio of water absorption capacity under pressure.</p>
    <heading>DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading>
    <p num="33">(I) Absorbent cross-linked polymer</p>
    <p num="34">
      An absorbent cross-linked polymer used in the present invention has a group represented by formula --COOR in which each R is independently hydrogen atoms, metal atoms or ammonium and a ratio of --COOH/--COOR of not more than 0.5. Examples of R are alkali metal such as lithium sodium potassium rubidium cesium, alkaliearth metal such as beryllium magnesium calcium, transition element such as zinc and other metal such as aluminum.
      <br/>
      Example of ammonium contains ammonium(NH4), primary ammonium such as monoethanolammonium, methyammonium, secondary ammonium such as dimethylammonium and dimethylammonium, tertiary ammonium such as triethanolammonium triethylammonium, and quarternary ammonium such as tetramethyammonium.
      <br/>
      A preferable R is a hydrogen atom, alkali metal or ammonium(NH4), more preferable is a hydrogen atom, lithium, sodium, or ammonium(NH4).
      <br/>
      R is used in the present invention form of simple kind or a mixture of two or more kinds.
      <br/>
      This invention has established by the absorbent cross-linked polymer having --COOR group of 12 mmol/g or more for governing factor for the ratio of water absorption capacity and the speed of absorption under pressure.
      <br/>
      Herein the --COOR group of the absorbent cross-linked polymer contains total of carboxyl group (--COOH) and neutralized thereof per unit amount of the absorbent cross-linked polymer.
      <br/>
      If the ratio of --COOH/--COOR is 0.5 or more, the shortage will bring about disadvantages such as jeopardizing the stability and degrading various physical properties such as speed of absorption and ratio of water absorption capacity under pressure.
      <br/>
      If the absorbent cross-linked polymer has a --COOR group content of 12 mmol/g or more, it will not allow production of an absorbent resin which satisfactorily reconcile a ratio of water absorption 10 capacity and a speed of absorption under pressure as well as improved absorbing peculiarity, as aimed at by this invention.
    </p>
    <p num="35">
      The --COOR density of the absorbent cross-linked polymer can be expressed by the amount of COOR groups per unit amount of the absorbent resin in theoretically.
      <br/>
      In the case of a polymer (molecular weight of 94 g/mol) produced by polymerization of acrylic acid and neutralizing carboxyl group with sodium hydroxide of 100 mol %, for example, --COOR content is computed in accordance with the following formula
    </p>
    <p num="36">
      1/94(g/mol)=10.6 mmol/g. Using poly metal having n charge as R, 20 --COOR is given expression of --COO(M)1/n, --COOR content can be computed as same.
      <br/>
      If the absorbent cross-linked polymer comprising compounds such as starch, PVA, surfactant and so on, or monomer not containing --COOR, content of the absorbent cross-linked polymer can be suitably corrected. --COOR content of an absorbent cross-linked polymer can be found by any of the known methods of analysis such as neutralization titration with sodium polyacrylate having a known --COOR group content as the standard or NMR elemental analysis, X-ray fluorimetry.
      <br/>
      Incidentally, since the absorbent resin generally has a water content of not more than 10% by weight, the computation of the --COOR group content of the absorbent resin must be suitably corrected with respect to this water content.
      <br/>
      It is essential that the absorbent resin of this invention should contain --COOR groups at a higher concentration than the partially neutralized sodium polyacrylate (about 11 mmol/g) or the partially neutralized potassium polyacrylate (about 10 mmol/g) copiously used in the commercially available absorbent resins.
    </p>
    <p num="37">(II) Method of production of an absorbent polymer</p>
    <p num="38">It is obtained by the following (1)-(4) methods, preferably by the (1)-(3) methods.</p>
    <p num="39">(1) A method for obtaining the absorbent cross-linked polymer by preparing an aqueous --COOR group-containing monomer solution containing a copolymerizing cross-linking agent and adapted to acquire a --COOR group content of 12 mmol/g or more and furnish a molecular ratio of --COOH/--COOR of not more than 0.5 subsequent to polymerization, polymerizing the aqueous solution, drying the resultant polymer in the form of a gel absorbing water, and optionally pulverizing the dried polymer.</p>
    <p num="40">(2) A method for obtaining the absorbent cross-linked polymer by polymerizing an aqueous --COOR acid group-containing monomer solution and, during the subsequent neutralization of not less than 50 mol % of the base of the resultant polymer, neutralizing the resultant polymer with a salt until the --COOR group content of the polymer reaches a level of 12 mmol/g or more, drying the resultant polymer in the form of a gel absorbing water, and optionally pulverizing the dried polymer.</p>
    <p num="41">(3) A method for obtaining the absorbent cross-linked polymer by preparing an aqueous --COOR group-containing monomer solution adapted to acquire a --COOR group content of 12 mmol/g or more and furnish a molecular ratio of --COOH/--COOR of not more than 0.5 subsequent to polymerization, polymerizing the aqueous solution, subsequently causing a compound having a plurality of functional groups capable of reacting with a --COOR group to react with the polymer thereby introducing a cross-linked structure into the polymer thereby, and optionally drying this polymer.</p>
    <p num="42">(4) A method which comprises preparing the ester compound of the aforementioned --COOR group-containing monomer adapted to acquire a --COOR group content of 12 mmol/g or more and furnish a molecular ratio of --COOH/--COOR of not more than 0.5 subsequent to saponification of the polymer, polymerizing the ester compound, and saponifying the polymer before or after being cross-linked.</p>
    <p num="43">Salt used for neutralizing of monomer are, for example, solution of lithiumhydroxide, sodiumhydroxide, calciumhydroxide, inorganic amine such as hydroxyl amine, organic amine such as monoethanol amine, dimethanolamine, triethanolamine.</p>
    <p num="44">So long as the produced absorbent cross-linked polymer contains --COOR groups in a concentration of 12 mmol/g or more and furnishes a molecular ratio of --COOH/--COOR of not more than 0.5., the step of neutralizing the base and the introduction of the cross-linked structure may be carried out at an arbitrary stage before, after, or during the polymerization.</p>
    <p num="45">
      As more specific preferred embodiments of this invention for the synthesis of the absorbent cross-linked polymer of this invention, the following (a) - (e) methods, preferably the (a) or (d) methods, may be cited.
      <br/>
      Preferably, in this invention, the (a)-(d) methods are used for increasing the surface area of the absorbent resin and the (b) method specializing form polymerization is used for obtaining an absorbent resin having a large surface area and containing fine powder sparingly.
    </p>
    <p num="46">(a) A method which polymerizes an aqueous lithium acrylate solution containing a copolymerizing cross-linking monomer and having a degree of neutralization in the range of 50-100 mol % in the presence of a polymerization initiator in a state having bubbles of inert gas dispersed.</p>
    <p num="47">(b) A method which polymerizes an aqueous lithium acrylate solution containing a copolymerizing cross-linking monomer and having a degree of neutralization in the range of 50-100 mol % in the presence of a polymerization initiator and a surfactant in a state having bubbles of inert gas dispersed.</p>
    <p num="48">(c) A method which subjects an aqueous lithium acrylate solution containing a copolymerizing cross-linking monomer and having a degree of neutralization in the range of 50-100 mol % to reversed-phase suspension polymerization in an organic solvent in the presence of a polymerization initiator and a surfactant.</p>
    <p num="49">(d) A method which polymerizes an aqueous acrylic acid solution containing a copolymerizing cross-linking monomer in the presence of a polymerization initiator and, subsequent to the polymerization, adds an aqueous solution of lithium carbonate or lithium hydroxide to the resultant polymerization product to neutralize 50-100 mol % of the acid base.</p>
    <p num="50">(e) A method which obtains a lithium salt of polyacrylic acid by polymerizing an acrylic ester and further saponifying it before or after the resultant polymer being cross-linked, and optionally ion-exchanging the product of saponification.</p>
    <p num="51">(II-a) --COOR containing monomer</p>
    <p num="52">
      The --COOR containing monomers which are simultaneously used for producing the absorbent cross-linked polymer mentioned above may be two or more monomers selected from among maleic acid, fumaric acid, itaconic acid, mesaconic acid, citraconic acid, and acrylic acid.
      <br/>
      Salt of carboxyl group containing monomer contains the monomer of salt mentioned above.
      <br/>
      So long as these monomers allow production of an absorbent cross-linked polymer containing --COOR groups in a concentration of 12 mmol/g or more and having a molecular ratio of --COOH/--COOR of not more than 0.5, they may be suitably used in combination with other monomers capable of copolymerizing therewith.
      <br/>
      As concrete examples of such other monomers, sulfonic acid group-containing monomers such as 2-(meth)acryloyl ethane sulfonic acid, 2-(meth)acryloyl propane sulfonic acid, 2-(meth)-acrylamide-2-methyl propane sulfonic acid, vinyl sulfonic acid, and styrene sulfonic acid, salts thereof with such alkali metals as lithium, sodium, and potassium, and ammonium salts thereof; nonionic hydrophilic group-containing monomers such as (meth)-acrylamide, N-substituted (meth)acrylamide, 2-hydroxyethyl (meth)acrylate, 2-hydroxypropyl (meth)acrylate, methoxypoly-ethylene glycol (meth)acrylate, polyethylene glycol (meth)-acrylate, N-vinyl pyrrolidone, and N-vinyl acetamide; amino group-containing unsaturated monomers such as N,N-dimethylamino-ethyl (meth)acrylate, N,N-dimethylaminopropyl (meth)acrylate, and N,N-dimethylaminopropyl (meth) acrylamide and the products of quaternization thereof; and acrylic esters such as methyl (meth)-acrylate, ethyl (meth)acrylate, and butyl (meth)acrylate and hydrophobic monomers such as vinyl propionate may be cited.
    </p>
    <p num="53">(II-b) Copolymerizing cross-linked monomer</p>
    <p num="54">
      The copolymerizing cross-linking monomers which are usable preferably for the synthesis of an absorbent cross-linked polymer in this invention include ethylene glycol di(meth)acrylate, diethylene glycol di(meth)acrylate, triethylene glycol di(meth)-acrylate, propylene glycol di(meth)acrylate, polyethylene glycol di(meth)acrylate, trimethylol propane di(meth)acrylate, trimethylol propane tri(meth)acrylate, pentaerythritol di(meth)acrylate, pentaerythritol tri(meth)acrylate, pentaerythritol tetra(meth)-acrylate, N,N'-methylene bis(meth)acrylamide, triallyl isocyanurate, trimethylol propane di (meth) allyl ether, triallyl amine, tetraallyloxy ethane, and glycerol propoxy triacrylate, for example.
      <br/>
      The amount of such copolymerizing cross-linking monomer to be advantageously used is in the range of 0 to 2 parts by weight, preferably 0.001-1 part by weight, based on 100 parts by weight of the --COOR group-containing monomer.
      <br/>
      If the amount of the cross-linking monomer is not more than 0.001 part by weight, the proportion of the water-soluble component in the produced absorbent cross-linked polymer will possibly increase to the extent of preventing the polymer from securing fully sufficient capacity for absorption and speed of absorption under pressure.
      <br/>
      Conversely, if the amount of the cross-linking monomer exceeds 2 parts by weight, the cross-link density in the produced polymer will possibly increase too much for the produced absorbent cross-linked polymer to acquire a fully satisfactory ratio of water absorption capacity.
    </p>
    <p num="55">(II-c) Polymerization initiator</p>
    <p num="56">
      The polymerization initiators which are preferably usable in the synthesis of an absorbent cross-linked polymer of this invention include azo compounds such as 2,2'-azobis(2-amidinopropane) dihydrochloride; peroxides such as ammonium persulfate, potassium persulfate, sodium persulfate, hydrogen peroxide, benzoyl peroxide, cumene hydroperoxide, and di-t-butyl peroxide; and redox initiators produced by combining the peroxides mentioned above with such reducing agents as sulfites, hydrogen sulfites, thiosulfates, formamidine sulfinic acid, and ascorbic acid, for example.
      <br/>
      These polymerization initiators may be used either singly or in the form of a mixture of two or more members.
    </p>
    <p num="57">
      The amount of the polymerization initiator to be used for the --COOR group-containing monomer falls in the range of 0.001-5 parts by weight, preferably 0.01-1 part by weight, based on 100 parts by weight of the --COOR group-containing monomer, though it is variable with the combination of the monomer with the polymerization initiator.
      <br/>
      If the amount of the polymerization initiator to be used is not more than 0.001 part by weight, the amount of the unaltered monomer will increase and consequently, the amount of the residual monomer in the produced absorbent cross-linked polymer will proportionately increase.
      <br/>
      Conversely, if the amount of the polymerization initiator exceeds 5 parts by weight, the polymerization will not be easily controlled and the amount of the water-soluble component in the produced absorbent cross-linked polymer will increase unduly.
    </p>
    <p num="58">
      The temperature at which the polymerization is initiated falls in the range of 0-70 (degree)  C., preferably 10-65 (degree)  C., though it is variable with the kind of polymerization initiator to be used.
      <br/>
      The polymerization temperature in the process of reaction is in the range of 20-110 (degree)  C., preferably 30-90 (degree)  C. If the temperature at the start of polymerization or the polymerization temperature in the process of reaction deviate from the ranges mentioned above, such disadvantages as (a) an increase in the amount of the residual monomer in the produced absorbent cross-linked polymer and (b) a decrease in the ratio of water absorption capacity of the absorbent cross-linked polymer due to an advance of excessive self-cross-linking reaction will possibly ensue.
    </p>
    <p num="59">(II-d) Surfactant</p>
    <p num="60">The surfactants which are optionally used for synthesizing a preferred absorbent cross-linked polymer of this invention by the (B) and (C) method mentioned above include anionic surfactants, nonionic surfactants, cationic surfactants and amphoteric surfactants, for example.</p>

      <br/>
      Though the temperature at which the fragments are dried is not particularly limited, it generally falls in the range of 100-250 (degree)  C., preferably in the range of 120-200 (degree)  C., for example.
      <br/>
      The duration of drying is not particularly limited but suitably decided generally in the approximate range of 10 seconds--five hours, more advantageously in the approximate range of one minute--two hours.
    </p>
    <p num="74">
      The means for drying the fragments is not particularly limited.
      <br/>
      Various methods such as drying by heating, drying with hot air, drying under a vacuum, drying with infrared ray, drying with microwave, drying with a drum drier, dehydration by azeotropic distillation with a hydrophobic organic solvent, and high-humidity drying by the use of hot steam can be employed.
      <br/>
      A preferred absorbent cross-linked polymer for this invention has a porous texture.
      <br/>
      The holes in the polymer have an average pore diameter in the range of 10-500  MU m, preferably in the range of 20-400  MU m. The average pore diameter of a given absorbent cross-linked polymer can be determined by subjecting the cross-section of a dry sample to image analysis by the use of an electron  MU mcope.
      <br/>
      The porous polymer can be produced by the aforementioned (A) or (B) method of foam polymerization.
    </p>
    <p num="75">(i) Form of absorbent cross-linked polymer and BET specific area</p>
    <p num="76">
      The absorbent cross-linked polymer to be effectively used in this invention may be in any arbitrary form which is selected from among the forms of fibers, spheres, granules, scales, porous particles, and crushed fragments.
      <br/>
      With consideration for the absorption properties, the polymer is preferred to be in the form of spheres or porous particles having an average particle diameter in the range of 10-1000  MU m. More preferably, it is in the form of particles having an average particle diameter in the range of 100-600  MU m. The specific surface area of these particles is generally 0.035 m2 /g or more, preferably 0.040 m2 /g or more, and more preferably 0.05 m2 /g or more, more preferably 0.08 m2 /g or more, especially 0.10 m2 /g or more.

      <br/>
      The content of fine powder is preferably 20 wt % or less, more preferably 10 wt % or less, and more more preferably not more than 5 wt %. In the context of the present invention, the BET specific area is intended to be mesured by measurement thereof described in Example.

    <p num="77">(III) Absorbent resin</p>
    <p num="78">
      It has been found to be particularly suitable for a disposable diaper which enjoys an improved ratio of water absorption capacity under pressure to artificial urine under a load of 100 g/cm2, suffers an only sparing decline of the ratio of water absorption capacity under pressure owing to a load, and manifests a high pressure-resistant absorption ratio.
      <br/>
      From the standpoint of securing a pressure-resistant absorbent resin of this invention, it is essential to use a covalent bond-forming cross-linking agent as a compound having plural of functional groups capable of reacting with --COOR groups and it is preferable to lower the ratio of water absorption capacity under no load of the absorbent cross-linked polymer by the agency of the covalent bond-forming cross-linking agent to 0.9-0.3 times the level which existed prior to the surface cross-linking.
    </p>
    <p num="79">
      If the decrease of the ratio of water absorption capacity under no load is not more than 0.9 times the level which existed before the surface cross-linking, the improvement of the ratio of water absorption capacity under pressure to artificial urine under a load of 100 g/cm2 will not be sufficient even when an absorbent cross-linked polymer containing --COOR groups in a concentration of 12 mmol/g or more and having a molecular ratio of --COOH/--COOR of not more than 0.5 is used and the pressure-resistant absorption ratio will be possibly insufficient.
      <br/>
      If the decrease of the ratio of water absorption capacity under no load declines to below 0.3 times the level which existed before the cross-linking, the produced polymer will be deficient in the ratio of water absorption capacity and will possibly suffer from an inferior speed of absorption.
      <br/>
      For the sake of securing the pressure-resistant absorbent resin contemplated by the present invention, it suffices to adjust suitably the kind and amount of a cross-linking agent and the temperature and duration of heating so that the ratio of water absorption capacity under no load may fall in the range of 0.9-0.3 times, preferably in the range of 0.85-0.5 times, and more preferably in the range of 0.8-0.6 times, the level which existed before the surface cross-linking.

      In the context of the present invention, the ratio of water absorption capacity of absorbent cross-linked polymer and absorption resin under pressure is intended to be measured by measurement thereof described in Example.

      For the purpose of increasing the cross-link density in the proximity of the surface of the absorbent cross-linked polymer, the absorbent cross-linked polymer of this invention which contains --COOR groups in a concentration of 12 mmol/g or more and has a molecular ratio of --COOH/--COOR of not more than 0.5. is heated after having added a compound having a plurality of functional groups capable of reacting with --COOR groups.
      <br/>
      Though the temperature of this heating may be properly selected to suit the cross-link density to be expected, it is in the range of 40-250 (degree)  C., preferably in the range of 80-220 (degree)  C. This invention has established that when the reaction time is suitably selected in the range of 1-120 minutes, preferable of 3-60 minutes.

    <p num="101">The use of an absorbent cross-linked polymer containing --COOR groups in a concentration of 12 mmol/g or more and having a molecular ratio of --COOH/--COOR of not more than 0.5 as a base polymer as contemplated by this invention results in markedly curtailing the reaction time or lowering the reaction temperature as compared with the conventional 70 mol % neutralization cross-linked sodium polyacrylate (amount of --COOR groups: 11.4 mmol/g).</p>
    <p num="102">(III-d) BET specific surface area</p>
    <p num="103">
      The absorbent resin of this invention which has a large specific surface area of 0.03 m2 /g or more, preferably 0.035 m2 /g or more, more preferably 0.04 m2 /g or more and has a ratio of water absorption capacity of 25 g/g or more , preferably 28 g/g or more , more preferably 30 g/g or more to artificial urine under a load of 100 g/cm2.
      <br/>
      The content of fine powder of a particle diameter of 150  MU m or less, lowered to not more than 20 wt %, preferably 10 wt % or less, and more preferably 5 wt % or less.
      <br/>
      In the context of the present invention, the content of fine powder is intended to be measured by measurement thereof described in Example.
      <br/>
      The absorbent resin having a large specific surface area and a small content of fine powder is obtained by the foaming mentioned above.
    </p>
    <p num="104">
      It has been heretofore known to decrease the particle diameter of an absorbent resin for the purpose of enabling the absorbent resin to acquire an increase speed of absorption.
      <br/>
      When the content of fine powder not exceeding 150  MU m in diameter is suffered to exceed 20 wt %, or further 30 wt %, the absorbent resin not merely yields a swelled gel which tends to clog the texture of a diaper induces the diaper to leak urine but also furnishes uniform surface cross-linkage only with difficulty and degrades the ratio of water absorption capacity under pressure.
      <br/>
      As a means for enlarging the surface area of an absorbent resin without reducing the particle diameter thereof, a method which uses a foamed absorbent resin has been proposed.
      <br/>
      Where the ratio of water absorption capacity under pressure deserves first consideration when a cross-linking treatment is given to the proximity of surface of a porous resin, since the treatment must form a high cross-link density in the surface, the surface of a porous polymer which allows no easy control of cross-link density is compelled to sacrifice its hydrophilicity.
      <br/>
      In spite of the use of the porous polymer, therefore, the surface cross-linking eventually results in lowering the speed of absorption.
    </p>
    <p num="105">
      Heretofore, the surface area and the ratio of water absorption capacity under pressure, particularly the ratio of water absorption capacity under high pressure, have been contradictory properties.
      <br/>
      This invention, owing to the increase of the content of --COOR groups density of 12 mmol/g or more in an absorbent resin or an absorbent cross-linked polymer, allows provision of a novel absorbent resin which incredibly manifests an exceptionally high ratio of water absorption capacity of not less than 22 g/g under high pressure even when the surface area is increased by decreasing the particle diameter or foaming the resin particles.
    </p>
    <p num="106">(IV) Pressure-resistant absorbent resin</p>
    <p num="107">
      This invention further provides a novel absorbent resin, namely a pressure-resistant absorbent resin which exhibits a ratio of water absorption capacity of 35 g/g or more to artificial urine under a no load, and a ratio of water absorption capacity of 30 g/g or more, preferably 33 g/g, to artificial urine under a pressure load of 50 g/cm2, and a ratio of water absorption capacity of 22 g/g or more to artifical urine under a high pressure load of 100 g/cm2, and a ratio of water absorption capacity after five minutes of 25 g/g of more under 50 g/m2, and a speed of absorption of less than 20 sec.
      <br/>
      The absorbent resin of this invention contains a water-soluble component in a concentration of not more than 25 wt %, preferably not more than 15 wt %, and more preferably not more than 10 wt %. In the context of the present invention, the contains a water-soluble component is intended to be measured by measurement thereof described in Example.
    </p>
    <p num="108">(V) Pressure-resistant absorption ratio</p>
    <p num="109">
      The term "pressure-resistant absorption ratio" as used in this invention refers to the magnitude determined by the ratio: (the ratio of water absorption capacity under high pressure to artificial urine under a load of 100 g/cm2)/(the ratio of water absorption capacity under pressure to artificial urine under a load of 50 g/cm2).
      <br/>
      This is a novel parameter which has not attracted any attention to date.
    </p>
    <p num="110">

      <br/>
      The sample of Example 2 of this invention which will be described herein below, for instance, manifests exceptionally stable absorption properties to such a change in load (pressure) as 0.82 of pressure-resistant ratio.
    </p>
    <p num="111">
      Since both ratios are low, their declines due to an increase of the load apparently contract and, as a result, the pressure-resistant absorption ratio possibly reaches a level exceeding 0.7 (as in the samples of Controls 1-3 of this invention to be described specifically herein below).
      <br/>
      The absorbent resin which has a ratio of water absorption capacity under pressure falling short of 30 g/g to artificial urine under a load of 50 g/cm2, however, is incapable of withstanding the load of a standard baby and fails to accomplish any of the objects of this invention.
      <br/>
      It has been found that simply because a given absorbent resin manifests a duly high ratio of water absorption capacity under a load of 10 to some tens of g/cm2 which is estimated from the standard body weight (about 10 kg) of a baby, it does not necessarily follow that this absorbent resin, when incorporated in an actual diaper, fulfills a satisfactory function.
    </p>
    <p num="112">
      The absorbent resins simply manifesting high ratios of water absorption capacity under pressure which have been proposed to date reach a large total.

      Simply because a given absorbent resin manifests a duly high ratio of water absorption capacity under a load of 10 to some tens of g/cm2 which is estimated from the standard body weight (about 10 kg) of a baby, it does not necessarily follow that this absorbent resin, when incorporated in an actual diaper, fulfills a satisfactory function.
      <br/>
      It has been further established that a recently proposed conventional absorbent resin manifests a ratio of water absorption capacity of not less than 30 g/g under pressure (50 g/cm2) and that even this absorbent resin has a ratio of water absorption capacity of 18 g/g at most under high pressure (100 g/cm2), a magnitude decidedly insufficient for any absorbent resin.
      <br/>
      This invention has further established that the decline of the ratio of water absorption capacity under such a pressure as exceeds the load estimated from the body weight, namely the pressure-resistant absorption ratio which is determined by the ratio (the ratio of water absorption capacity under high pressure to artificial urine under a load of 100 g/cm2) / (the ratio of water absorption capacity under pressure to artificial urine under a load of 50 g/cm2) is extremely important for disposable diapers.
    </p>
    <p num="113">Further, it has been established that even the conventional absorbent resin which manifests a ratio of water absorption capacity of not less than 30 g/g under pressure (50 g/cm2) suffers the ratio of water absorption capacity to be decreased largely by an increase of the load (pressure) and that specifically, this absorbent resin manifests the pressure-resistant absorption ratio, a magnitude defined as the ratio of the aforementioned ratio of water absorption capacity under pressure to the ratio of water absorption capacity under high pressure to artificial urine under a load of 100 g/cm2, at a low level of not more than 0.6.</p>
    <p num="114">It has been found by the inventors' monitor test that the conventional absorbent resin manifesting a pressure-resistant absorption ratio of not more than 0.6 gives no perfect performance as a diaper even when the ratio of water absorption capacity under pressure is not less than 30 g/g to artificial urine under a load of 50 g/cm2.</p>

    <p num="121">
      The absorbent resin or the pressure-resistant absorbent resin of this invention, when combined with such a fibrous substance as pulp, is transformed into absorbent articles.
      <br/>
      The absorbent articles include hygienic materials (bodily humor absorbing materials) such as disposable diapers and sanitary napkins, pads intended for wear by patients of incontinence, materials for protecting lacerations, and materials for cure of lacerations; absorbent articles for the urine of pet animals; materials for civil engineering and construction such as building material, water-retaining material for soil, water-preventing material, packing material, and gel water bags; food grade articles such as drip absorbents, freshness-retaining material, and refrigerating material; various industrial articles such as oil-water separating material, material for preventing food from condensation of water, and coagulating material; and agricultural and horticultural articles such as water-retaining materials for plants and soil, for example.

    <p num="122">(VII-b) Disposable diaper</p>
    <p num="123">
      The disposable diaper which uses the absorbent resin or pressure-resistant absorbent resin of this invention is fabricated, for example, by sequentially superposing a back sheet made of material impervious to water, a core layer (absorbent materiel) containing the absorbent resin of this invention, and a top sheet (surface material) formed of material pervious to liquid in the order mentioned and meanwhile mixing the layers to each other and then attaching to the resultant superposed layers a gather (elastic part) and a so-called tape fastener.
      <br/>
      The term "disposable diaper" as used herein is meant to embrace such pants as are fitted with a disposable diaper and used for training infants on the habit of autonomic urination and defecation.

    <p num="125">(VIII) Effect</p>
    <p num="126">The absorbent resin or the pressure-resistant absorbent resin of this invention manifests the outstanding effects enumerated in the following items (1)-(5).</p>
    <p num="127">(1) The absorbent resin, in the process of manufacture, offers enhanced reactivity with a compound having a plurality of functional groups capable of reacting with the --COOR groups present in the proximity of surface of the polymer without reference to the shape of a base polymer and, consequently, permits a reduction of the duration of a heat treatment for the surface cross-linking treatment without being affected by the shape of the polymer.</p>
    <p num="128">(2) Even the base polymer of a porous texture, after the surface cross-linking treatment, suffers no decline of the affinity thereof for an aqueous liquid and, consequently, allows a marked addition to the speed of absorption.</p>
    <p num="129">(3) The produced absorbent resin enjoys heretofore unattainable great improvements in absorption properties as aptly evinced by ample reconciliation between the two frequently contradictory factors, i.e. the ratio of water absorption capacity under pressure and the speed of absorption.</p>
    <p num="130">(4) The novel pressure-resistant absorbent resin is provided which manifests such a high ratio of water absorption capacity under pressure even under a load of 100 g/cm2 as has never been found in the conventional absorbent resin, suffers only a sparing decline of the capacity for absorption in spite of a great increase of load from 50 g/cm2 to 100 g/cm2, and manifests an outstanding capacity for absorption under a load of any magnitude.</p>
    <p num="131">
      (5) The disposable diaper is provided which uses a pressure-resistant absorbent resin manifesting a ratio of water absorption capacity of not less than 30 g/g under pressure to artificial urine under a load of 50 g/cm2 and a pressure-resistant absorption ratio of not less than 0.6, the pressure-resistant absorption ratio being defined as the ratio of the aforementioned ratio of water absorption capacity under pressure to the ratio of water absorption capacity under high pressure to artificial urine under a load of 100 g/cm2.
      <br/>
      The disposable diaper consequently provided, therefore, manifests a high ratio of water absorption capacity under pressure, suffers leakage of urine only sparingly, and enjoys a large capacity for absorption even when the load of a baby's body weight is constantly varied due to the incessant movement of the baby, it has provided a thin type disposable diaper thereby concentration of absorbent resin in core (absorbent).
    </p>
    <p num="132">
      (6) The absorbent resin having such a high ratio of water absorption capacity of 22 g/g under high pressure as has never been attained in spite of a large specific surface area of not less than 0.03 m2 /g has been obtained for the first time in the art.
      <br/>
      It has been found that this novel absorbent resin is unusually suitable for a disposable diaper.
      <br/>
      This absorbent resin is preferred to have the content of fine powder of particle diameter of not more than 150  MU m lowered to a level of not more than 20 wt %, preferably not more than 10 wt % Incidentally, the absorbent resin having a large surface area and a small content of fine powder is obtained by the foaming described above.

      After the elapse of 60 minutes thence, the pouch was pulled up, drained by a centrifugal separator at 250 G for three minutes, and weighed (W1 g).

      This procedure was repeated to find the weight (W0 g) of the pouch containing neither absorbent cross-linked polymer nor absorbent resin.

      <br/>
      First, about 5 g of an absorbent cross-linked polymer (a sample prepared by separating a portion consisting of particles having particle diameters in the range of 600-300  MU m with the aid of JIS standard sieves) was placed in a microcell (Type: QS-400) having an inner volume of about 13 cm2.
      <br/>
      The microcell containing the sample was heated in a stream of nitrogen gas to 150 (degree)  C. until the sample was thoroughly deaerated and dehydrated.

      Next, the microcell containing the sample was cooled in a stream of a mixed gas consisting of helium gas and 0.1% of Krypton gas to -200 (degree)  C. until the mixed gas was adsorbed to an equilibrium by the sample.
      <br/>
      Thereafter, the microcell containing the sample was warmed to room temperature to effect elimination of the sample from the mixed gas and measure the amount of the krypton-mixed gas consequently eliminated.
      <br/>
      The specific surface area of the absorbent cross-linked polymer was determined based on the amount of the krypton-mixed gas thus found.
      <br/>
      The process of adsorption--elimination of the microcell containing the sample was performed up to three repetitions.

      The sample was left freely falling into a cup of acrylic resin having a known weight (g) and an inner volume of 100 ml (adapted to meet the specification of JIS K3362 6.2, with necessary modifications).
      <br/>
      Of the total volume of the absorbent cross-linked polymer fallen into the cup, the convex surface portion was gently removed by sliding a glass rod.
      <br/>
      Then, the weight (g) of the cup filled with the polymer was measured to the smallest unit of 0.01 g to find the weight (g) of the absorbent cross-linked polymer per 100 ml.
      <br/>
      This weight was divided by the volume of the cup and the quotient consequently found was reported as the bulk specific gravity (g/ml).

      <br/>
      The container 2 is provided at the top thereof with an opening part 2a and on the lateral part thereof with an opening part 2b.
      <br/>
      The ambient air inlet pipe 3 is inserted into the opening part 2a and the conduit 4 is fitted to the opening part 2b.

      The metal net 9 is made of stainless steel and has 400 mesh (38  MU m in mesh size).

      <br/>
      Meanwhile, parallelly to the preparatory steps, 0.9 g of the absorbent resin was uniformly spread inside the supporting cylinder 8, namely on the metal net 9 and the weight 10 was mounted on the layer of the absorbent resin.
      <br/>
      Then, on the filter paper 7, the metal net 9 or the supporting cylinder 8 having the absorbent resin and the weight 10 mounted thereon was set in place.
      <br/>
      The weight, W2 (g), of the artificial urine 22 absorbed by the absorbent resin over the duration of 60 minutes following the time the supporting cylinder 8 was mounted on the filter paper 7 was found by the use of the balance 1.
      <br/>
