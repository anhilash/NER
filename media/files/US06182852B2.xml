      The invention includes a novel profile for a container bottom and method of manufacturing the improved bottom.
      <br/>
      The improvement involves the creation of an additional angled portion in the inner leg area of a container bottom during the formation of the bottom profile during the bodymaking step.
      <br/>
      Known container bottom profiles have a single portion in the inner leg area after the bodymaking process.
      <br/>
      The inventive profile includes the following discrete portions starting at the nose of the container bottom and working inwards towards the central axis: a nose, a substantially linear lower leg portion projecting upwards from the nose, a separate angled portion between the lower leg portion and the dome inclined generally at an angle more towards the longitudinal central axis of the container than the angle of the lower leg portion, and a dome.

    <p num="2">

      <br/>
      Technical Field
    </p>
    <p num="3">This invention relates generally to the design and manufacture of aluminum containers as are commonly used for containment of beverages, and in particular to an improved bottom structure and process for manufacturing the improved bottom structure.</p>
    <p num="4">2. Background</p>
    <p num="5">
      Two piece aluminum containers have been used extensively for distributing beverages such as beer, carbonated soft drinks and other beverages such as tea.
      <br/>
      A large portion of the cost of delivering beverages to consumers in containers is the material cost.
      <br/>
      This has led to ongoing efforts in the industry to reduce the amount of material used in containers.
      <br/>
      The widespread use of such containers makes it possible to achieve large savings with what would otherwise appear to be a very small reductions in material requirements.
      <br/>
      These efforts are referred to within the industry as "lightweighting." Efforts to lightweight aluminum containers have focused on four areas: the bottom profile, the side wall, the neck area and the container lid.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      Light weighting of the bottom profile generally involves either changing the geometry of the bottom as it is manufactured during the bodymaking process, modifying the bottom profile shape after the bodymaking process, or some combination of the two.
      <br/>
      Despite the efforts to lightweight aluminum containers, the need for a strong bottom has required substantial thickness be retained in the bottom to achieve required strengths.
      <br/>
      If the container bottom is not sufficiently strong the central dome area will be forced downward by the internal pressure of the contents until it reverses shape.
      <br/>
      This is referred to as dome reversal.
      <br/>
      As a practical matter, the dome on all aluminum containers manufactured for commercial use today will reverse at some finite pressure.
      <br/>
      The pressure at which the dome reverses is one criteria which is used to measure the strength of a particular bottom profile.
      <br/>
      This pressure is referred to as the "dome reversal pressure" or DRP.
      <br/>
      Design changes that increase the dome reversal pressure are the equivalent of design changes that permit light weighting of the container, since material thickness container be reduced while maintaining the required dome reversal pressure.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      The bodymaking process includes the process steps of drawing and ironing.
      <br/>
      The bottom profile of a container is typically formed as the last step, in a pressing process that draws material to the required shape and dimensions.
      <br/>
      The bottom profile is formed when punch nose tooling, located on the bottom end of a punch on the interior of the container blank, is forced against a dome plug and outer retainer located on the opposite side of the container blank.
      <br/>
      The profile formed in the aluminum sheet feed stock will thus conform to match the intersection between the punch nose tooling, outer retainer, and the dome plug.
      <br/>
      Typically, the punch nose tooling has a coining surface which defines the point in the process where there is continuous contact between the dome plug tooling, the metal of the container blank, and the punch nose tooling.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      During the creation of the bottom profile, the thickness of the aluminum in the center of the bottom is not significantly changed.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the thickness required for adequate bottom strength must be the thickness of the feed stock.
      <br/>
      The inability to improve the strength of the bottom creates a situation in which the bottom profile requirements determine the minimum acceptable feed stock thickness.
      <br/>
      Improvements in the side wall and neck area which could permit the use of thinner feed stocks cannot be implemented unless an improved bottom profile has been identified and a process for manufacturing containers with the improved profile defined.
      <br/>
      Thus, there remains a need for improved container bottom profiles and manufacturing methods therefore.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      One known method of improving the strength of a bottom profile is to reform either the outside or inside area around the nose. U.S. Pat. No. 5,105,973, describes an inside reform process for improving the strength of the container.
      <br/>
      Reforming of the outside is also known.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      Another limitation on known processes is that the inside diameter of the bottom profile is formed in a drawing process.
      <br/>
      In prior processes, a dome plug has been used to form a substantially linear inner leg portion between the nose and the dome.
      <br/>
      The inner leg is formed when the dome plug and opposing tooling known as the punch nose are pressed together with a metal container blank between them.
      <br/>
      The process requires sufficient clearance to allow the metal to flow between the opposing tooling without shearing and tearing.
      <br/>
      As a result of the clearances used in prior art processes, the inner leg portion, though linear, will angle slightly outwardly at the bottom, away from the longitudinal central axis 116 of the container when the dome plug tooling is removed.
      <br/>
      This occurs because the aluminum of the bottom is formed from the end of the punch nose tooling to the top of the dome plug which has a smaller diameter than the inside diameter of the inner leg portion of the punch nose tooling.
      <br/>
      The difference in diameter causes the inner leg to slant slightly toward the inner axis at the top.
    </p>
    <heading>BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="11">In accordance with the preferred embodiments, many of the disadvantages, shortcomings, and problems associated with previous container designs and methods of manufacturing have been substantially reduced or eliminated.</p>
    <p num="12">It has been considered by the inventors, that if the angularity of the inner leg to the longitudinal central axis 116 of the container could be made to approach zero, the dome reversal pressure would increase.</p>
    <p num="13">It has also been considered by the inventors, that if the inner leg length could be manufactured more vertically, and therefore as a cylinder portion, then there would be an increase in the dome reversal pressure.</p>
    <p num="14">
      An advantage of the present disclosure is that it reduces the angularity of the inner leg portion of the bottom of the container body relative to the central axis of the container.
      <br/>
      Another advantage of the present disclosure is that it increases the length of the inner leg portion combined with the frusto-conical portion of the invention.
      <br/>
      Another advantage of the present disclosure is that it increases the buckle strength of the container body.
      <br/>
      Another advantage of the present disclosure is that it increases the dome reversal pressure of the container body.
      <br/>
      Another advantage of the present disclosure is that it allows for reduction in the amount of metal required to manufacture the bottom structure of the container body.
      <br/>
      Another advantage of the present disclosure is that it achieves improved performance and material savings without the need for additional reforming steps.
      <br/>
      Other advantages of the present disclosure will become apparent from the following descriptions, taken in connection with the accompanying drawings, wherein, by way of illustration and example, an embodiment of the present disclosure is disclosed.
    </p>
    <p num="15">
      For all purposes intended to facilitate understanding of the disclosure herein presented, the following definitions of terms are given: The terms "Container" and "can" are used interchangeably. "Container stand plane" means an imaginary plane perpendicular to the longitudinal central axis 116 of the container, and intersecting the axis at the lowermost point of the container.
      <br/>
      In example, the surface of a table upon which the container was placed in an upright position, would be the "container stand plane." As related especially to elements of the container, "downwardly" means a direction towards the container stand plane, and "upwardly" means a direction away from the container stand plane.
      <br/>
      Likewise, "outwardly" means a direction away from the longitudinal central axis 116 of the container, and "inwardly" means a direction towards the longitudinal central axis 116 of the container.
      <br/>
      The phrase "extends from adjacent" or similar phrases are intended to refer to the situation where two portions of an article are either attached to each other or connected by one or more connecting portions such as transitional radii, chamfers, or the like.

      Container 100 is an open-ended vessel having a sidewall portion 110 and a bottom structure 120, which is of a unique configuration.
      <br/>
      Container 100 has an open-ended mouth portion 114 at its uppermost end.

      Mouth portion 114 is integrally attached to generally circumferential sidewall portion 110.
      <br/>
      Sidewall portion 110 is attached at its lowermost end to bottom structure 120, thus forming an open-ended vessel.
      <br/>
      Container 100 has a longitudinal central axis 116, which is perpendicular to a container stand plane 118.
      <br/>
      The design of bottom structure 120 is further detailed in FIG. 3.

    <p num="30">
      FIG. 2 is a side view of a container 200 comprising the previously known technology.
      <br/>
      More specifically, FIG. 2 is an enlarged cross-sectional side view of a bottom structure 220 of container 200.
      <br/>
      In this view, the detail of bottom structure 200 is shown.
      <br/>
      A domed central panel 220 forms the center of bottom structure 220.
      <br/>
      Central panel 222 is attached at its outermost circumference to an inner leg portion 230.
      <br/>
      Inner leg portion 230 is attached at its lower edge to the inner edge of a generally semi-toroidal nose portion 232.

      FIG. 3 is an enlarged cross-sectional side view of bottom structure 120 of the preferred embodiment as indicated in FIG. 1.
      <br/>
      As can be seen in this view, and in FIG. 1, a domed central panel 122 forms the center of bottom structure 120.
      <br/>
      The outer edge of central panel 122 is attached to a semi-toroidal inner radius 124.
      <br/>
      Inner radius 124 is disposed between central panel 122 and the upper edge of an outwardly and downwardly inclined frusto-conical portion 126.
      <br/>
      While preferred, inner radius 124 is not required and may be replaced by a chamfered portion, or frusto-conical portion 126 may be attached directly to central panel 122.
      <br/>
      Frusto-conical portion 126 extends axially outwardly and downwardly from adjacent to central panel 122.
      <br/>
      Frusto-portion 126 is inclined outwardly and downwardly from longitudinal central axis 116 of container 100 at angle  ALPHA .
      <br/>
      The preferred angle  ALPHA  is about 14.5 (degree) . However, angle  ALPHA . may be from about 5 (degree)  to about 25 (degree) . More preferably, angle  ALPHA  is from about 10 (degree)  to about 20 (degree) . Most preferably angle  ALPHA  is from about 13 (degree)  to about 16 (degree) . Frusto-conical portion 126 is attached at its lower edge to a semi-toroidal outer radius 128.
      <br/>
      Outer radius 128 is disposed between frusto-conical portion 126 and the upper edge of a substantially cylindrical inner leg portion 130.
      <br/>
      While preferred, outer radius 128 is not required may be replaced by a chamfered portion, or frusto-conical portion 126 may be attached directly to inner leg portion 130.

      A cross-section of nose portion 132 may be semicircular, or it may include a combination of other linear and non-linear components in forming a structure that at its lowest point is tangent to container stand plane 118.
      <br/>
      Nose portion 132 thus forms a "ring" upon which container 100 may rest upright on horizontal surfaces.
      <br/>
      The outer edge of nose portion 132 is attached to the lower edge of an upwardly inclined outer leg portion 134.

    <p num="40">
      In the preferred embodiment of the present disclosure, container 100 is provided being comprised of generally of sidewall portion 110 and bottom structure 120.
      <br/>
      Bottom structure 120 is comprised of central panel 122 attached by inner radius 124 to frusto-conical portion 126 which is essential to the present invention.
      <br/>
      Frusto-conical portion 126 is attached by outer radius 128 to inner leg portion 130.
      <br/>
      Inner leg portion 130 is attached to nose portion 132.
      <br/>
      Nose portion 132 defines the lowermost extent of container 100 and forms a "ring" upon which container 100 may rest upright on horizontal surfaces.
      <br/>
      The outer edge of nose portion 132 is attached to the lower edge of an upwardly inclined outer leg portion 134.
      <br/>
      Leg portion 134 is attached to sidewall portion 110, thus forming container 100.
    </p>
    <p num="41">
      In the preferred embodiment, inner leg portion 130 is more vertically oriented than previously known designs that were manufactured using similar manufacturing methods and tooling before any secondary reform processing steps.
      <br/>
      In a preferred embodiment inner leg portion 130 will be oriented at an angle between from about -5 (degree)  to about 0 (degree)  after the secondary reform process.
      <br/>
      Before the secondary reform process, the inner leg portion 130 has an angle from about -1 (degree)  to about 4 (degree)  with respect to the longitudinal central axis 116 of the container.
      <br/>
      In comparison, inner leg portion 230 is oriented at an angle from about 0 (degree)  to about 2 (degree)  relative to longitudinal central axis of container 200 of the prior art after application of the same secondary reform processing step.
      <br/>
      Also, inner leg portion 130, combined with the vertical component of frusto-conical portion 126 is longer than previously known designs.
      <br/>
      Also, inner leg portion 130 has a larger inside diameter than previously known These dimensional changes, in combination with the presence of frusto-conical portion 126, provide container 100 with improved operating characteristics.
    </p>
    <p num="42">
      The unexpected aspect of the invention was the magnitude of the increase in the dome reversal pressure that was achieved.
      <br/>
      For example, tests performed on the preferred embodiment as disclosed, indicate an increase in dome reversal pressure from 94.5 psi to 99.7 psi for containers made using aluminum feedstock having a thickness of 0.0104 inches and an increase in dome reversal pressure from 91.4 psi to 97.8 psi for containers made using aluminum feedstock having a thickness of 0.0102 inches.
      <br/>
      These measurements were taken on containers that had their bottom profiles reformed using an outside reform process.
      <br/>
      While the container bottom of the invention provides increased strength without an additional outside reforming step, the preferred method includes both the modified container bottom described herein combined with known outside reform processes.
      <br/>
      However, the only variables were the change in initial bottom profile and the feed stock thickness.
      <br/>
      These tests show that the feed stock thickness required to manufacture container 100 could be reduced by 0.0002" (two ten thousandths of an inch) while having an increase in dome reversal pressure from 94.5 psi to 97.8 psi.
    </p>
    <p num="43">
      The inventors devised container 100 and a method for manufacturing container 100, such that inner leg portion 130 would be more vertically oriented than previously known designs, by reducing the clearance between base portion 152 of dome plug 140 and inner leg forming portion 180 of punch nose 170.
      <br/>
      To achieve this, dome plug 140 has a base portion 152 with a diameter that is 0.020" (twenty thousandths of an inch) larger in diameter than the dome plug used to create previously known designs.
      <br/>
      However, it was determined that this alteration would prohibit proper drawing of the metal, for which previously known clearance was provided.
      <br/>
      Chamfered portion 148 on dome plug 140 provides angular relief that allows the feed stock metal of container 100 to retain the necessary metallurgical integrity to flow through the restricted clearance between base portion 152 of dome plug 140 and inner leg forming portion 180 of punch nose 170.
      <br/>
      In addition, chamfered portion 148 on dome plug 140 generates frusto-conical portion 126 onto bottom structure 120 of container 100.
      <br/>
      Since the angle of inner leg 130 must flatten outwardly as container 100 is pressurized for inversion to occur, the improved vertical orientation of inner leg 130 results in superior buckle performance over previously known designs formed by the same process.
      <br/>
      Frusto-conical portion 126 acts to further increase dome reversal pressure by providing an additional vertical component to the height of central panel 122, and by providing a discontinuity in the structure of central panel 122 that mechanically resists inversion.
    </p>
    <p num="44">
      In previous container bottom profiles, the top of the central panel is 0.425 inches above the container stand plane.
      <br/>
      In the design for container 100 disclosed herein, the top of central panel 122 is 0.435 inches above the container stand plane 118.
      <br/>
      The 0.010 inch increase in the height of central panel 122 is a result of the increase in the combined length of inner leg portion 130 and the vertical component of frusto-conical portion 126.
      <br/>
      This is achieved by recessing coining surface 178 of punch nose 170 by 0.010" (ten thousandths of an inch) compared to punch nose tooling of previously known designs.
    </p>
    <p num="45">The combination of these modifications results in a bottom profile which has improved strength characteristics similar to that achieved by an "inside reformed" bottom profile without the additional process step of inside reforming.</p>
    <p num="46">While this invention has been described in connection with a preferred embodiment, it is not intended to limit the scope of the invention to the particular form set forth, but on the contrary, it is intended to cover such alternatives, modifications, and equivalents as may be included within the spirit and scope of the invention as defined by the appended claims.</p>
