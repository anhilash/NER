    <heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="1">
      The present invention concerns a new photographic material that reduces the amount of dust generated when the material is conveyed.
      <br/>
      The invention also concerns the use of such material to reduce the amount of dust generated when the material is conveyed.
    </p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">
      Photographic material conventionally comprises a transparent reflective support that is coated with one or several image-forming layers containing silver halide photographic emulsions.
      <br/>
      From shooting to development, these materials are subject to many mechanical stresses.
      <br/>
      In particular, these mechanical stresses act on the photographic material when it is being moved, for example during exposure, development, printing or projection.
      <br/>
      Physical deterioration of the photographic material follows with partial shredding of the superficial layers of the photographic material.
      <br/>
      This partial shredding generates debris and dust which accumulate on the material itself, on any other photographic material in contact or located close by, and on the conveyor mechanism.
    </p>
    <p num="3">
      This problem is especially important in the cinematography industry.
      <br/>
      Motion picture films are photographic materials that are always used in movement, for example when shooting, developing, printing or projecting the film.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      In cinematographic shooting, a set of scenes is filmed on a first color negative film for shooting.
      <br/>
      This negative film is cut and spliced to make up the final motion picture film that comprises a selection of scenes.
      <br/>
      This assembled negative film is then printed on positive color film, called a Master.
      <br/>
      This master, which constitutes the final motion picture film, is used to produce a copy onto intermediate negative film.
      <br/>
      This intermediate negative film is then used to print positive copies intended for projection in movie theater.
      <br/>
      These copies are obtained by exposing copy positive film using the intermediate negative film, the two films being placed one against the other and driven at speeds in the order of 50 to 100 m/min.
      <br/>
      This copying step is repeated as many times as necessary.
    </p>
    <p num="5">Consequently, a large number of copies are printed from a single intermediate negative film.</p>
    <p num="6">
      While these copies are being printed, dust and debris are generated by the wear and tear of the superficial parts of the copy positive film as they move.
      <br/>
      These dust and debris tend to accumulate mechanically or electrostatically on the intermediate film, which causes the appearance of defects on the following printed copies.
      <br/>
      In order to limit these defects, the copy printing operation has to be interrupted regularly to clean the intermediate negative film on which the dust and debris have accumulated.
    </p>
    <p num="7">The objective of the present invention is to provide copy positive photographic material that generates a low amount of dust and debris when printing copies.</p>

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="12">
      The non image-forming layer of the invention material is a layer that is not sensitive to radiation, usually visible light.
      <br/>
      This layer comprises a hydrophilic colloid in which metallic silver is dispersed in particle form.
    </p>
    <p num="13">
      The hydrophilic colloid is usually gelatin or a gelatin derivative such as acetylated gelatin, phthalated gelatin, oxidized gelatin, etc.
      <br/>
      The hydrophilic colloid can be a water-soluble polymer or copolymer such as polyvinylic alcohol, cellulose hydroxyethyl, etc.
      <br/>
      Colloids that can be used in photography are described in Research Disclosure, September 1996, 591, 38957, Section II A, hereafter called "Research Disclosure".
    </p>
    <p num="14">
      The metallic silver particles contained in the non image-forming layer can have very varied forms, for instance balls, filaments, etc.
      <br/>
      According to one preferred embodiment, the metallic silver is in filament form.
      <br/>
      The average filament length is usually less than or equal to 0.1  MU m.
    </p>
    <p num="15">According to one particular embodiment, the metallic silver content of the non image-forming layer is between 0.1 and 1 mg/dm2, preferably between 0.3 and 0.6 mg/dm2.</p>
    <p num="16">The image-forming layer of the material of the invention can comprise a set of silver halide image-forming layers.</p>
    <p num="17">
      Photographic emulsions are conventionally constituted of silver halide grains dispersed in a hydrophilic colloid, for example, gelatin.
      <br/>
      Silver halide grains can be constituted of chloride, bromide, chlorobromide, bromochloride, chloroiodide, bromoiodide or bromochloro-iodide.
    </p>
    <p num="18">The silver halide grains can have any conventional geometric form (e.g. cubic or octahedral regular crystalline form), and can be prepared using various techniques, for example, techniques such as single or double jet precipitation, with accelerated and interrupted flow, as described by T. E. James, The Theory of the Photographic Process, 4th ed., Macmillan, 1977, Chapter 3, and in Research Disclosure, Section I.</p>
    <p num="19">Silver halide emulsions can be sensitized chemically or by means of sensitizers based on sulfur, selenium, tellurium, platinum, gold, palladium, iridium, osmium, rhenium or phosphorus, or combinations of these sensitizers.</p>
    <p num="20">Silver halide emulsions can be spectrally sensitized by means of polymethine spectral dyes, which comprise the cyanines, merocyanines, cyanines and complex merocyanines (i.e. tri-, tetra- and polynuclear cyanines and merocyanines), oxonols, hemioxonols, styryls, merostyryls and streptocyanines.</p>
    <p num="21">Chemical or spectral sensitization methods are described in Research Disclosure, Sections IV and V.</p>
    <p num="22">
      Dye-forming couplers are compounds that during development produce a dye image by reacting with the oxidized developer.
      <br/>
      These compounds are known in the art and are described in detail in The Theory of the Photographic Process, 4th ed., T. E. James, 337-338 and in Research Disclosure, Section X; these compounds are for example, acylacetanilide compounds, 5-pyrazolones substituted in position 1 and 3, phenols, indophenols, etc.
    </p>
    <p num="23">
      In addition to the compounds mentioned above, the photographic product can contain other compounds that are photographically useful, for example, coating aids, stabilizers, plasticizers, antifoggants, antistatic agents, matting agents, oxidized developer scavengers, etc.
      <br/>
      Examples of these compounds are described in Research Disclosure, Sections VI, VII, VIII, and X.
    </p>
    <p num="24">
      Supports useful in the scope of the invention are described in Section XV of Research Disclosure.
      <br/>
      These supports are usually polymer supports such as cellulosic polymers, polystyrenics, polyamides, polyvinylics, polyethylene, polyester, paper or metallic supports.
    </p>
    <p num="25">According to one particular embodiment, the invention material comprises at least one additional layer located between the non image-forming layer and the set of image-forming layers, this additional layer containing an oxidized developer scavenger, for example 2,5 di-sec-hydroquinone.</p>
    <p num="26">The material of the invention can be a black-and-white photographic material or a color photographic material.</p>
    <p num="27">The invention material is preferably a color product of which the set of image-forming silver halide emulsion layers of the material of the present invention comprises at least one blue sensitive silver halide emulsion layer containing a yellow dye-forming coupler, at least one red sensitive silver halide emulsion layer containing a cyan dye-forming coupler, and at least one green sensitive silver halide emulsion layer containing a magenta dye-forming coupler.</p>
    <p num="28">
      The material of the present invention is preferably color positive motion picture film intended for printing copies for motion picture.
      <br/>
      Such material comprises a transparent support and a set of image-forming silver halide emulsion layers containing in order from the support, one emulsion layer with blue sensitive silver halides containing a yellow dye-forming coupler, one emulsion layer with red sensitive silver halides containing a cyan dye-forming coupler, and one emulsion layer with green sensitive silver halides containing a magenta dye-forming coupler.
    </p>
    <p num="29">
      The invention material can comprise intermediate layers, for example, an antihalation layer, an antistatic layer, and oxidized developer scavenger layers, etc.
      <br/>
      These various layers and their arrangements are described in Section XI of Research Disclosure.
    </p>
    <p num="30">
      The material of the present invention is particularly useful for printing otion picture copies.
      <br/>
      In this case, the material is exposed as shown in FIG. 1 herein the material 10 is a developed intermediate negative film, for example, ENC.RTM. film manufactured by the Eastman Kodak Company, the material 14 is a material of the present invention, the device 12 is a device for exposing the material 14 through the negative film 10, the material 14' being the invention material after exposure.
    </p>
    <p num="31">The material 14' is a motion picture copy that after development will be ready for projection.</p>
