      The invention provides methods for the production of recombinant bovine Follicle Stimulating Hormone (bFSH) as well as vectors and cells for use in those methods.
      <br/>
      In particular the invention provides baculovirus based vectors which are capable of expression of bFSH in insect cells. bFSH is a heterodimeric protein belonging to a family of glycoprotein hormones which are produced in the pituitary or the placenta.
      <br/>
      It finds its use in many fertility related applications.
      <br/>
      Expression of bFSH in baculovirus/insect cell systems leads to a recombinant bFSH which has an unexpected high activity in a human FSH receptor assay and/or a bovine immature oocyte assay.
      <br/>
      The genes encoding the subunits of bFSH may be present on one baculovirus derived vector or on two or more vectors which are to be cotransfected.

    <heading>BACKGROUND</heading>
    <p num="2">
      1.
      <br/>
      Field of the Invention
    </p>
    <p num="3">
      This invention relates to the field of recombinant expression in insect cells.
      <br/>
      It relates especially to the expression of heterodimeric proteins in such cells and more particularly to the expression of glycoprotein hormones such as follicle stimulating hormone and the like.
    </p>
    <p num="4">2. State of the Art</p>
    <p num="5">
      Follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) belongs to the family of glycoprotein hormones, which are produced either in the pituitary (LH, TSH) or in the placenta (hCG).
      <br/>
      Within a species, each of these hormones consists of a common  ALPHA  subunit, which is non-covalently bound to a hormone specific  BETA  subunit.
      <br/>
      Purified FSH administered alone or in combination with luteinizing hormone (LH), has been used to induce a superovulatory response.
      <br/>
      The results with these hormones or with pregnant mare serum gonadotropin (PMSG), which contains intrinsic FSH and LH activity, have been variable.
      <br/>
      The use of recombinant bovine FSH (rec.bFSH), which is guaranteed to be free of LH, and which is homologous to the species in which it is applied most frequently, may improve superovulation results.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, bovine FSH is difficult to purify in substantial quantities from bovine pituitaries (Wu et al., 1993).
      <br/>
      Rec.bFSH therefore may provide sufficient material to allow for structure-function studies by epitope mapping (Geysen et al., 1984; Westhoff et al., 1994).
    </p>
    <p num="6">cDNA's of bovine  ALPHA  subunit (Erwin et al., 1983; Nilson et al., 1983), as well as cDNA's of bovine FSH  BETA  subunit (Esch et al., 1986; Maurer &amp; Beck, 1986) have been isolated.</p>
    <p num="7">
      As indicated in Table 1, recombinant FSH has been produced in chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells for the human (Keene et al., 1989; Van Wezenbeek et al., 1990; Roth et al., 1993) and the ovine (Mountford et al., 1994) species, whereas for the bovine species recombinant FSH has been produced in CHO cells and in transgenic mice (Greenberg et al., 1991).
      <br/>
      Rec.bFSH has also been produced in mouse epithelioid cells (Chappel et al., 1988) and has been applied for superovulation in cattle (Looney et al., 1988; Wilson et al., 1989, 1993).
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      The baculo virus expression system is based on the infection of insect cells with a recombinant baculovirus (L. A. King and R. D. Possee, 1992) and is increasingly used for production of heterologous proteins.
      <br/>
      Insect cells have the glycosylation apparatus capable of synthesis of high mannose or hybrid type carbohydrates, as well as simple O-linked chains, and recombinant proteins can be expressed with much higher efficiency as compared with the chinese hamster ovary or COS cell system (Chen et al., 1991).
      <br/>
      The baculovirus expression system has been used to produce amongst others the  ALPHA  subunit of hCG (Nakhai et al., 1991a,b), the  ALPHA  subunit of carp gonadotropin (Huang et al., 1991; Chen and Bahl, 1991), the  BETA  subunit of hCG (Chen et al., 1991; Sridhar and Hasnain, 1993; Sridhar et al., 1993; Nakhai et al., 1992; Jha et al., 1992), hCG (Chen and Bahl, 1991; Nakhai et al., 1992), the receptor for human FSH (Christophe et al., 1993) and, quite recently, human FSH (Lindau-Shepard et al., 1994; Dias et al., 1994) (Table 1).
      <br/>
      Co-expression of two, or more, proteins by the baculovirus expression system has been achieved for instance by construction of a multiple expression transfer vector containing two, or more, foreign genes each of which is under the control of a copy of the p10 or polyhedrin promoter.
      <br/>
      Such expression vectors have been applied to the production of 2 totally unrelated proteins, for instance luciferase and hCG  BETA  (Hasnain et al., 1994), but also to the production of 3 or 4 closely related proteins, which may be assembled in vivo to complex structures (Belayev and Roy, 1993).
      <br/>
      Such a system might also be used for co-expression of FSH  ALPHA  and FSH  BETA , including the bovine forms.
      <br/>
      However, the synthesis of protein complexes has also been accomplished by co-infection of insect. cells with two different recombinant viruses.
      <br/>
      This has been applied to bluetongue virus proteins (French, Marshall &amp; Roy, 1990), hCG (Chen &amp; Bahl, 1991) and hFSH (Lindau-Shepard et al., 1994).
      <br/>
      Here we report for the first time the synthesis of bovine FSH in insect cells, by co-infection of cells with two recombinant viruses carrying the genes of bFSH ALPHA  and bFSH BETA , respectively.
      <br/>
      This bFSH appears to be active in at least three different bioassay systems.
      <br/>
      Production in insect cells of only bFSH ALPHA  was about 10 times higher than of only bFSH BETA , but co-infection of the two recombinant viruses resulted in production of heterodimer at a level comparable to that of bFSH ALPHA  alone.
      <br/>
      A similar effect has been observed with the production of recombinant ovine FSH in Chinese hamster ovary cells (Mountford et al., 1994), and of recombinant hCG in monkey cells (Reddy et al., 1985).

    <p num="10">Up to now no reports have been presented describing baculo expression of bovine FSH.</p>
    <p num="11">
      A surprising effect, obtainable by expressing bovine FSH in baculovirus based systems, is that very high biological activity is found, as demonstrated both in a heterologous system containing human FSH receptors, and in a homologous system containing bovine immature oocytes.
      <br/>
      It appears that the biological activity of baculo-derived rbFSH is at least as high as native FSH purified from pituitaries, or as rbFSH produced in higher eukaryotic cell systems.
    </p>
    <p num="12">
      This leads directly to an application in humans, especially in those cases in which administration of FSH needs to be carried out only a limited number of times, or in which the application can be carried out in vitro.
      <br/>
      Furthermore parts of the rbFSH molecule may act as an FSH antagonist and therefore can be used as a male contraceptive.
      <br/>
      This will only be possible if (fragments of) bovine FSH produced in baculovirus systems will not be immunogenic, and can therefore be used in humans without restrictions.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, bFSH or fragments of it may be used for vaccination against FSH as a means of contraception in the male.
      <br/>
      In the human this could be an attractive alternative for the use of hFSH, because a heterologous hormone (or part of it) may be more immunogenic than the homologous hormone.
    </p>
    <p num="13">
      For the bovine species the results of the oocyte maturation inhibition test lead to application in superovulation treatments in the bovine, where it can act as a substitute for Pregnant Mare Serum Gonadotropin (PMSG) or other hormones with FSH activity, in the treatment of reproductive problems such as anoestrus incomplete follicle development etc.
      <br/>
      It can also be used in in vitro experiments, for instance for the purpose of in vitro maturation and fertilization of oocytes.
      <br/>
      The biological activity of baculo-derived rbFSH in a rat-Sertoli-cell assay and a Y1 cell assay indicates that this biological activity most likely is not species specific.
      <br/>
      Applications therefore can be expected in other species than the human, bovine or rat, both in vivo and in vitro.
    </p>
    <p num="14">
      The invention further allows one to tailor the degree of sialylation, and thus the metabolic clearance rate and in vivo biological activity of FSH, by cloning the transsialydase-gene into the subunit-gene(s) containing baculo-vector.
      <br/>
      This may allow for addition of neuraminic acid to the glycan cores of rbFSH, and thus for increased biopotency.
    </p>
    <p num="15">Another part of the invention provides for fusion of (parts of) the bFSH BETA - and bLSH BETA -gene in order to tailor chimaeric hormones with a fixed ratio of FSH to LH bioactivity.</p>
    <p num="16">
      It will be understood that these kind of applications and embodiments lie within the scope of the present invention.
      <br/>
      Thus, where FSH is used in the present application this must be read as including fragments and/or derivatives thereof.
      <br/>
      It will also be clear that the exemplified vectors and/or regulatory elements are only examples and that other vectors capable of expression in insect cells will be suitable as well, as will other regulatory elements.
      <br/>
      The cloning techniques are also known in themselves and may be varied.
      <br/>
      The exemplified cell line is a well known and often used insect cell line.
      <br/>
      Other cell lines capable of being transfected by the vectors of the invention will also be applicable.
      <br/>
      Culture media for the transfected cells can be suitably selected by the person skilled in the art.
      <br/>
      Once bovine FSH has been expressed it is known how to isolate it from the culture.
      <br/>
      Once isolated and/or purified pharmaceutical preparations can easily be formulated using the knowledge obtained with other recombinant or isolated gonadotropins.

    <p num="22">
      Autographa californica Nuclear Polyhedrosis Virus (AcNPV) and recombinant virus stocks were propagated in Spodoptera frugiperda clone-21 (Sf21) cells grown as monolayers in TC100 medium (GIBCO--BRL), supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum plus antibiotics.
      <br/>
      For cotransfection, Sf21 cells were grown in Grace medium (Grace, 1962), supplemented with 10% foetal calf serum plus antibiotics.
      <br/>
      For immunological assays like RIP or IPMA and for protein production, Sf21 cells were grown in Sf900 serum-free medium (GIBCO--BRL) plus antibiotics.
      <br/>
      In order to reduce the background of wild type virus, modified AcNPV in which the p10 gene was exchanged for a synthetic and unique BSU36I restriction site was used for cotransfection (Martens et al.,1994).
      <br/>
      After homologous recombination between wild type virus and the transfer vector, circular recombinant viral DNA will be formed, which can infect Sf21 cells.
      <br/>
      Non-circular DNA is not infectious, and therefore background will be reduced.
      <br/>
      However, due to non-homologous recombination, background percentage will be reduced from 95% to 70% only (Martens, 1994).

    <p num="23">Enzymes and chemicals</p>

      Restriction enzymes and phage T4 DNA ligase were purchased from Biolabs (USA) and used as recommended by the supplier. 35 S methionine was obtained from Amersham UK.
      <br/>
      VenR  (tm) DNA polymerase was from Biolabs (USA).
      <br/>
      All cloning procedures were carried out essentially according to Sambrook et al. (1989).
    </p>
    <p num="25">Plasmids, and construction of transfer vectors</p>
    <p num="26">
      The cDNA coding for bFSHa was purified after double digestion of the plasmid bov Alpha-pSP64 -1 (Leung et al., 1987) with Nco I plus XBa I. The DNA of 554 bp's contained a signal sequence of 72 bp at the 5' end , and an untranslated region of 188 bp at the 3' end.
      <br/>
      It was cloned into the unique Nco I and XBa I sites of vector pARKhl which is a derivative of transfer vector pAcAs3 (Vlak et al., 1990).
      <br/>
      The Nco I site contained an ATG codon which coincided exactly with the start of the signal sequence of bFSH ALPHA .
      <br/>
      Correct insertion with respect to the p10 gene of bFSH ALPHA  in the vector was confirmed by extensive restriction enzyme analysis and sequencing (dideoxy method), and the selected transfer vector was designated pDWa9.1 (See FIG.1A and FIG. 1B).
    </p>
    <p num="27">
      DNA coding for bFSH BETA  was obtained by amplification of the relevant region of Bov FSHbeta pGEM3 (Maurer and Beck, 1986) by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR).
      <br/>
      A 39-cycle amplification was performed with Ven DNA polymerase.
      <br/>
      The sequences of the synthetic oligonucleotides used in PCR reactions were as follows
    </p>
    <p num="28">(5' 3'): 1, C C T G A G A G A T C T A T C A T G A A G T C T G T C C A G T T C T G (SEQ. ID. NO. 1); 2, G A G G G A T C C A G A T C T A G A G G A T T T A G G T G A C A C T A T A (SEQ. ID. NO. 2).</p>
    <p num="29">
      Primer 1 introduced a BspH I restriction site by changing the sequence A G G A T G A A G into A T C A T G A A G, which allowed cloning of the bFSH BETA -cDNA on the ATG at the start of the signal sequence.
      <br/>
      Primer 2 introduced a combined Bgl II/XBa I restriction site and a SP6 flag at the 3' end of bFSH BETA -cDNA.
    </p>
    <p num="30">
      After PCR, the bFSH BETA -cDNA of 1.5 kb length was purified by electrophoresis in a 4% agarose gel, and doubly digested with BspH I/Stu I. A 348 bp DNA fragment was isolated and cloned into the unique Nco I and Stu I sites of the vector pARKhl.
      <br/>
      The recombinant plasmid was termed pDW BETA 1.
    </p>
    <p num="31">
      Vector pARKh1 was derived from vector pAcAs3 (Vlak et al., 1990). pAcAs3 is a transfer vector of 9809 bp, containing the baculovirus p10 promoter, directly flanked by a unique BamH I site.
      <br/>
      The nucleotide sequence around this BamH I site was first modified by PRC in such a way, that an ATG start codon was formed; the resulting plasmid was called pAcMo8 (Vlak &amp; van Oers, 1994).
      <br/>
      Further modifications by PCR introduced a multiple cloning site (MCS) containing a Nco I site, followed by Bgl II, Xba I, Pst I and BamH I. This plasmid was called pPAI.
      <br/>
      A synthetic MCS plus hybrid envelope glycoprotein of hog cholera virus (E1) plus 3 stop codons were inserted by cloning Bgl II+blunted PSt I of pPEh8 (van Rijn et al., 1992) into Bql II+blunted BamH I of pPA1, resulting in transfer vector pARKh1.
      <br/>
      Hybrid E1 contains a unique Stu I site, which allowed for the exchange of E1 for bFSH BETA . bFSH BETA  was cloned into pARKh1 in two parts.
      <br/>

      So far, we have not purified of rbFSH subunits or hormone, and specific (bio)activity per unit of weight is based on ELISA in which purified hormone-subunits were used as reference preparations.

      It has been mentioned in the literature that specific activity of rhFSH can vary between 10.000 and 40.000 IU mg-1, depending on the method of protein recognition and/or the use of various protein standards (Mannaerts et al., 1991).

      This also may reveal possible microheterogeneity, as has been demonstrated for rhFSH (De Boer and Mannaerts, 1990).
      <br/>
      The observed variation in bioactivity between different bio-assays (cAMP production of Y1 cells, morphological changes of Y1 cells, cAMP production in rat-Sertoli-cells, maturation inhibition of bovine oocytes) (Table 2) may be explained by differences in glycosylation between pituitary and recombinant bFSH.
    </p>
    <p num="89">
      Until now, bovine recombinant FSH has been produced only in mouse epitheloid cells (Chappel et al., 1988) and in transgenic mice (Greenberg et al., 1991), although reference was made also to CHO cells (Greenberg et al., 1991, commercial preparation from Genzyme Corp.).
      <br/>
      Reports about application of rbFSH for superovulation in cattle do not give any specification of the rbFSH used (Looney et al., 1988; Wilson et al., 1988; Wilson et al., 1993), although it apparently is from commercial origin.
    </p>
    <p num="90">
      Most likely all these rbFSH products were based on the same subunit cDNA's as were used in our baculo-expression system.
      <br/>
      Sofar, the only rFSH which has been produced in the baculovirus system, is human FSH (Lindau-Shepard et al., 1994; Dias et al., 1994).
      <br/>
      The cDNA that was used for hFSH ALPHA  subunit consisted of a 51 bp untranslated 5' region, a 72 bp signal sequence, a 276 bp sequence of the a subunit, and a 222 bp untranslated 3' region.
      <br/>
      In contrast, the cDNA of the  BETA  subunit contained the minimal contiguous hFSH BETA  sequence, including the leader sequence but without untranslated regions at either the 5' or 3' end.
      <br/>
      It is our feeling that the untranslated 3' region which we have used in the cDNA of the bovine FSH BETA  subunit, may have contributed to its stability and to a high production level.
    </p>
    <p num="91">To further illustrate this phenomenon the posttranscriptional regulation of bFSH BETA  subunit mRNA is discussed below</p>
    <p num="92">FSH BETA  mRNA</p>
    <p num="93">
      The FSH BETA  subunit is encoded by a single gene in species studied, which has been characterized in the human, rat and cow, and contains three exons and two introns (reviewed by Haisenleder et al. 1994).
      <br/>
      FSH BETA  subunit biosynthesis most likely is a rate limiting step in FSH heterodimer assembly and secretion (Greenberg et al., 1991).
      <br/>
      The FSH BETA  mRNA nucleotide and polypeptide amino acid sequences are highly conserved between species (approx. 80%).
      <br/>
      In rats and cows, only one mRNA (of approx. 1.7 kb) has been demonstrated, but the human FSH BETA  gene produces four mRNA size variations.
      <br/>
      The different mRNA sizes appear to be due to the use of two different transcription start sites and two different polyadenylation sites, but it is unknown if all four mRNA transcripts are translated or hormonally regulated.
      <br/>
      The biosynthesis and secretion of LH and FSH are under the control of multiple hormones: GnRH, which is released from the hypothalamus in a pulsatile manner, sex steroid hormones and the gonadal protein hormones inhibin, activin, and follistatin.
      <br/>
      The latter have preferential effects on FSH; inhibin and follistatin decrease FSH BETA  mRNA levels and FSH secretion, whereas activin is stimulatory.
      <br/>
      Follistatin binds activin with high affinity, blocking stimulation of FSH secretion, and inhibin with lower affinity.
    </p>
    <p num="94">Stability of FSH BETA  mRNA</p>
    <p num="95">
      Inhibin and follistatin appear to repress steady state FSH BETA  mRNA levels at least in part by reducing the stability of FSH BETA  transcripts (Dalkin et al., 1993; Carrol et al., 1991).
      <br/>
      In rats, the pulsatile administration of GnRH stimulates FSH BETA  gene transcription, while estrogen inhibits FSH BETA  mRNA transcription in vivo.
      <br/>
      In contrast, the ability of testosterone to elevate FSH BETA  mRNA levels in the presence of a GnRH antagonis is independent of any influence on gene transcription, and presumably represents a posttranscriptional effect on FSH BETA  mRNA stability (reviewed by Haisenleder et al., 1994; Mercer &amp; Chin, 1995).
      <br/>
      Similarly, the gonadal peptide activin enhances FSH BETA  mRNA expression in rat pituitary cell cultures, in part by increasing the half-life of the FSH BETA  transcript over 2-fold (Carrol et al., 1991).
    </p>
    <p num="96">FSH BETA  mRNA 3'UTR</p>
    <p num="97">
      A common feature of FSH BETA  genes is an extremely long 3'UTR (1 kb, 1.2 kb and 1.5 kb in the rat, bovine and human genes, respectively).
      <br/>
      This compares to LH BETA - and TSH BETA -mRNA which have a total length (including 3'UTR) of approximately 700 bp (Maurer and Beck, 1986).
    </p>
    <p num="98">
      There are five highly conserved segments within the long 3'UTRs of the rat, human and bovine FSH BETA  genes.
      <br/>
      Apart from this observation, sequences within the 3'UTR of several genes have been shown to be important in determining RNA stability (reviewed by Gharib et al., 1990).
    </p>
    <p num="99">
      Removal of the majority of the 3'UTR from the ovine FSH- BETA  subunit cDNA insert dramatically enhanced the accumulation of oFSH BETA -mRNA transcripts in COS cells, indicating a role for this region in regulating mRNA stability.
      <br/>
      A similar effect is seen in stably transfected CHO cells, although a corresponding effect on oFSH BETA  mRNA translation is not found, possibly reflecting translational inefficiency of  BETA  subunit mRNA (Mountford et al., 1994).
      <br/>
      The significance of this 3'UTR of FSH BETA  mRNA is presently unknown, but it has been speculated that it may play a role in determining FSH BETA  mRNA stability.
      <br/>
      This is supported by studies showing that elements in the 3'UTR can regulate MRNA in other cell systems (Haisenleder et al., 1994).
    </p>
    <p num="100">AU-rich regions</p>
    <p num="101">
      Of particular interest is the presence of 6 copies of the pentanucleotide AUUUA within the reported 3'-UTR sequence of bovine FSH BETA  (in the ovine sequence also 6 of such motifs have been found; Mountford et al., 1992).
      <br/>
      There is compelling evidence to suggest that this element plays a critical role in the destabilization of a number of short-lived cellular mRNAs encoding lymphokines and proto-oncogenes (Cleveland and Yen, 1989).
      <br/>
      These so-called AU rich sequences, when inserted into 3'UTR of a normally stable mRNA, have a destabilizing effect (Ross, 1988) and cause selective degradation of transiently expressed messengers (Shaw and Kamen, 1986).
    </p>
    <p num="102">These motifs have been found in highly labile mRNAs such a C--fos, or granulocytemonocyte colony-stimulating factor FM--CSF, and resemble the AU-rich motifs in the 3'UTR of the labile human LdhC (testis specific isozyme of lactate dehydrogenase) mRNA (Salehi-Ashtiani &amp; Goldberg, 1995).</p>
    <p num="103">Size of FSH BETA -mRNAU</p>
    <p num="104">
      Porcine FSH BETA  subunit CDNA has been used for production of pFSH BETA  in the baculovirus expression system (Sato et al., 1994, JP930071875).
      <br/>
      The cDNA used in this system was isolated by Kato (1988) and contained 929 basepairs, although Northern analysis showed a length of about 1.8 kb. The porcine FSH BETA  gene which was cloned into a baculovirus contained only 436 bp, which consisted of a 18 bp signal sequence, a 327 bp FSH BETA  gene and a 91 bp 3'UTR (Sato et al., 1994, JP930071875).
      <br/>
      The total sizes of porcine FSH BETA - and FSH BETA -mRNA reportedly were in the 2 kb range (Maurer &amp; Beck, 1986).
      <br/>
      Nucleotide analysis of bovine FSH BETA  mRNA showed a total length of 1728 basepairs, excluding a several hundred nucleotide tract of poly A at the 3'terminus.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the 1067 bp 3'UTR of bovine FSH cDNA which we have used (van de Wiel et al., 1995), is approximately ten times as long as the 3'UTR of porcine FSH BETA  cDNA used by the Japanese group, and is very close to the total length of 1341 bp found by Maurer and Beck (1986).
      <br/>
      Most importantly it contains four of the six ATTTA sequences found in the full length 3'UTR, whereas the truncated porcine FSH BETA  3'UTR described by Sato et al., JP930071875, (1994) contains no ATTTA sequence.
    </p>
    <p num="105">Relationship between size of FSH BETA -cDNA and production level</p>
    <p num="106">
      The size of bovine FSH BETA  mRNA which was isolated and used for expression in the baculovirus system by Sharma, Dighe and Canerall (1993) has not been reported.
      <br/>
      Production levels of both subunites in the soluble fraction reportedly were approximately 120 ng/ml; no mention was made of production of FSH heterodimer.
    </p>
    <p num="107">
      Production levels reported for rpFSH in Sf 21 cells by Sato et al., JP930071875 (1994) were approximately 0.1  MU g/ml, although in Tn5 cells a production was reported of 1  MU g/ml.
      <br/>
      Specific activity of this rpFSH as calculated from their data was 1250 IU/mg.
      <br/>
      In our bovine system we obtained production levels of 1-5  MU g/ml; specific activity in the same in vitro bioassay as used by Sato et al., JP930071875 (1994) (OMI) was 7700 IU/mg.
    </p>
    <p num="108">
      As reported in the literature, levels of expression of recombinant proteins in insect cells may be too high, thus compromising posttranslational processing and excretion of the wanted protein into the culture medium (Sridhar et al., 1993; Sridhar &amp; Hasnain, 1993).
      <br/>
      High production levels of porcine LH receptor for instance resulted in intracellular accumulation and degradation of the product, with relatively low levels excreted into the medium (Bozon et al., 1995; Pajot-Augy et al., 1995).
      <br/>
      We have now found that increasing the length of the 3'UTR of bFSH BETA  cDNA which we have used and thus increasing the number of ATTTA sequences, significantly increased the levels of excreted product, as compared to the results of Sato et al., JP930071875 (1994).
    </p>
    <p num="109">Apparently, by selecting the length of the 3'UTR of FSH subunit cDNA, and thus choosing the number of specific ATTTA sequencs, one may selectively modify the stability of the corresponding mRNA, and modify the levels of the product that is excreted by the insect cells used.</p>
