      The present disclosure includes a method of plasma etching a trench having rounded top corners in a silicon substrate.
      <br/>
      One embodiment includes the following general steps: a) providing a semiconductor structure comprising a hard masking layer, overlying a silicon substrate; b) plasma etching through said hard masking layer and any additional underlying layers overlying said silicon substrate using at least one plasma feed gas which does not provide polymer deposition on surfaces of said semiconductor structure during etching; where said plasma etching exposes a face of said silicon substrate; and c) plasma etching at least a first portion of a trench into said silicon substrate using reactive species generated from a feed gas comprising a source of fluorine, a source of carbon, a source of hydrogen, and a source of high energy species which provide physical bombardment of said silicon substrate.
      <br/>
      Top corner rounding is effected by deposition of a thin layer of polymer on a top corner of the trench during etching of the first portion of the trench, resulting in the formation of a rounded "shoulder" at the top corner of the trench.
      <br/>
      Typically a layer of silicon oxide overlies at least a portion of the silicon substrate surface.
      <br/>
      The method described provides excellent critical dimension control over the active area of a transistor produced using the method and reduces the need to remove polymer from substrate and reactor surfaces after etching of the silicon trench.

      The present invention pertains to a method for etching a trench in a silicon substrate.
      <br/>
      In particular, the present invention pertains to particular plasma etch chemistries, process conditions, and a series of steps which may be used to produce rounded top corners on a trench etched in a silicon substrate.
      <br/>
      The term "top trench corner" refers to the transition from the upper sidewall of a trench to the upper surface of the substrate in which the trench is formed.

    <p num="4">2. Brief Description of the Background Art</p>
    <p num="5">
      Trenches formed in silicon using traditional etching methods typically have sharp, squared-off top corners.
      <br/>
      These sharp, squared-off corners lead to high field stress in film layers subsequently deposited thereon during further processing steps.
      <br/>
      The high field stress can potentially lead to the electrical breakdown of the overlying deposited film layers.
      <br/>
      Further, the sharp, squared-off corners are a point of charge accumulation, which can cause edge leakage.
      <br/>
      Rounding of the top corners in trench structures can be critical for device performance.
      <br/>
      However, rounding of the corners in a manner which results in a loss of device active area is undesirable.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      Various methods for obtaining a rounded top corner on a trench formed in a silicon substrate are known in the art.
      <br/>
      For example, U.S. Pat. No. 5,843,846, issued Dec. 1, 1998 to Nguyen et al., discloses a method for rounding the top corners of a sub-micron trench in a semiconductor device after trench formation.
      <br/>
      The method comprises exposing the previously formed trench to a gas comprising a carbon-fluorine gas, argon, and nitrogen directly after trench formation.
      <br/>
      The combination of the carbon-fluorine and nitrogen gases etch back the silicon nitride and stress relief oxide layers in order to expose the top corners of the trench.
      <br/>
      As the top corners of the substrate are exposed, nitrogen and argon gases are said to sputter the top corners, rounding them as the etch process completes the trench.
      <br/>
      The method is preferably performed using a low density parallel plate etch reactor.

      No. 09/042,249, filed Mar. 13, 1998, discloses a method of obtaining a rounded top corner on a trench formed in a semiconductor substrate comprising the following steps: (a) providing a film stack comprising the following layers, from the upper surface of the film stack toward the underlying substrate, (I) a first layer of patterned material (typically, a patterned photoresist) which is resistant to a wet etch solution used to etch an underlying second layer and which is resistant to dry etch components used to etch the semiconductor substrate (typically, silicon), and (ii) a second layer of material (typically, silicon dioxide) which can be preferentially etched using a wet etch solution, wherein the second layer of material is deposited directly on top of the semiconductor substrate; (b) wet etching the second layer by immersing the film stack in a wet etch solution for a period of time sufficient to form an undercut beneath the first layer and to expose the underlying semiconductor substrate; and c) isotropically dry etching the exposed semiconductor substrate so as to form a trench in the semiconductor substrate.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      A sharp corner at the bottom of a trench can also be a source of stress, causing problems of the kind described with reference to the top corners of the trench.
      <br/>
      In addition, a rounded corner facilitates filling of the trench with a reduced possibility of trapping voids within the fill material.
      <br/>
      It is desirable to provide an etch process which provides a rounded bottom corner while maintaining a desired trench sidewall angle, for example, about 80 (degree)  to 90 (degree) .

    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="9">
      We have discovered an improved method of obtaining rounded top trench corners on a trench formed in a silicon substrate.
      <br/>
      In particular, a hard mask (for example and not by way of limitation, silicon nitride) and typically an underlying silicon oxide layer are first pattern etched using "clean" etch chemistries; that is, etch chemistries that do not result in the deposition of polymer on feature surfaces during etching.
      <br/>
      After completely etching through the hard mask and a silicon oxide layer, when present, a top corner rounding step is performed using etch chemistry which results in the deposition of a thin layer of polymer on the upper edge (top corner) of the silicon trench.
      <br/>
      The thin layer of polymer forms a rounded "shoulder" at the top corner of the trench.
      <br/>
      Thus, top corner rounding is effected during the etching of the first portion of the silicon trench.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      The use of "clean" chemistries to etch overlying layers such as a silicon nitride or silicon oxide layer minimizes the total amount of polymer generated during the entire etch process, and reduces polymer removal problems after etch.
      <br/>
      Because the polymer-generating corner rounding step is performed after etching of an overlying layer of silicon oxide in many cases, we are able to define the device active area critical dimension during the oxide etch step.
      <br/>
      We are able to maintain a stable and reproducible active area critical dimension control.
    </p>
    <p num="11">In one embodiment, the method comprises the following steps: a) providing a semiconductor structure comprising a hard masking layer, overlying a silicon substrate; b) plasma etching through the hard masking layer and any additional underlying layers overlying the silicon substrate using at least one plasma feed gas which does not provide polymer deposition on surfaces of the semiconductor structure during etching, where the etching exposes a surface of the silicon substrate; and c) plasma etching at least a first portion of a trench into the silicon substrate using reactive species generated from a feed gas comprising a source of fluorine, a source of carbon, a source of hydrogen, and a source of high energy species which provide physical bombardment of the silicon substrate.</p>
    <p num="12">
      Plasma feed gas recipes which provide excellent results in the top corner rounding step include CHF3 /HBr/CF4 or CHF3 /argon/CF4.
      <br/>
      Less preferably,CH2 F2 may be used in place of CHF3.
      <br/>
      Use of CH2 F2 may result in increased polymer deposition, and require the adjustment of the relative amounts of the gaseous components making up the plasma feed gas.

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="14">
      The present invention relates to corner rounding during the etching of silicon trenches.
      <br/>
      Disclosed herein are three methods for top corner rounding and a method for bottom corner rounding which can be used in combination with any of the three top corner rounding methods.
    </p>
    <p num="15">In the embodiments described below, a typical etch stack used to form a trench in a silicon substrate is, from top to bottom, a patterned photoresist, a layer of silicon nitride, and a layer of silicon oxide, all overlying a silicon substrate into which a trench is to be etched.</p>
    <p num="16">
      A first method of creating a rounded top corner on an etched silicon trench comprises etching both the silicon oxide layer and an upper portion of the underlying silicon substrate during a "break-through" step which immediately precedes the step in which the silicon trench is etched.
      <br/>
      The break-through step is used for removal of the silicon oxide layer overlying silicon substrate areas in which a trench is to be etched.
      <br/>
      The plasma feed gas for the break-through step comprises carbon and fluorine.
      <br/>
      The atomic ratio of fluorine to bromine in the plasma feed gas is preferably within the range of about 10:1 to about 50:1.
    </p>
    <p num="17">
      In this method, the photoresist layer is preferably not removed prior to the break-through etching step.
      <br/>
      Subsequent to the break-through step, a trench is etched to a desired depth in the silicon substrate using a different plasma feed gas composition, which does not provide polymer formation.
      <br/>
      Both the silicon oxide etch and silicon trench etch may be performed in a single processing chamber, reducing processing time, providing increased throughput, and providing a decrease in processing costs.
      <br/>
      In some instances, other etch stack layers, such as the photoresist layer and the silicon nitride layer, may be removed in the same process chamber, using a plasma which produces byproducts compatible with the plasmas used in subsequent device processing steps.
      <br/>
      The principal etchant of the break-through etch plasma is generated from a feed gas containing fluorine which may be, by way of example and not by way of limitation, selected from the group consisting of CF4, CHF3, CH2 F2, CH3 F, and combinations thereof.
      <br/>
      The principal etchant is preferably selected from the group consisting of CF4, CHF3, and combinations thereof; and CF4 has been shown to work very well.
      <br/>
      The plasma feed gas may further include CH4.
      <br/>
      In some instances, the presence of CH4 may be required, for example, when the amount of photoresist material available during the silicon oxide layer etch is minimal.
      <br/>
      The plasma feed gas preferably further includes a nonreactive, diluent gas selected from the group consisting of argon, helium, xenon, krypton, and combinations thereof.
      <br/>
      The nonreactive, diluent gas is most preferably argon.
      <br/>
      The plasma feed gas may further include a controlled amount of oxygen, which may be used to improve the top corner rounding effect.
      <br/>
      The radius of the rounded corner depends on the feature size of the structure being etched.
      <br/>
      For a feature size of about 0.35  MU m, a typical radius for a rounded top corner ranges from about 15 nm to about 25 nm.
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      A second method of creating a rounded top corner on the etched silicon trench comprises formation of a built-up extension on the sidewall of the patterned silicon nitride layer during etch (break-through) of the underlying silicon oxide adhesion layer.
      <br/>
      The built-up extension on the silicon nitride sidewall acts as a sacrificial masking material during etching of the silicon trench, delaying etching of the silicon at the outer edges of the top of the trench.
      <br/>
      This permits completion of trench etching with delayed etching of the top corner of the trench, and provides a more gentle rounding (increased radius) at the top corners of the trench.
      <br/>
      For example, for a feature size of about 0.16  MU m, a typical radius for a rounded top corner ranges from about 25 nm to about 40 nm.
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      In this second method of creating a rounded top corner, the photoresist used to pattern the silicon nitride hard mask is removed prior to the silicon oxide break-through step.
      <br/>
      The plasma feed gas used during the break-through step must provide a source of hydrogen, a source of fluorine, a source of carbon, and a source of surface bombardment atoms.
      <br/>
      Typically, the surface bombardment atom source is an inert plasma feed gas such as argon, helium, krypton, nitrogen, xenon, or a combination thereof.
      <br/>
      Argon works particularly well.
      <br/>
      A single compound may be used to provide the hydrogen, carbon, and fluorine.
      <br/>
      Typically, more than one gaseous compound is used.
      <br/>
      It is important to have a controlled amount of carbon present in the process chamber at the time of the break-through step.
      <br/>
      While the hydrogen and the carbon are used to form polymeric material which deposits upon the silicon nitride sidewall, the fluorine and the bombardment atoms (typically argon) provide for removal of native oxide layers.
      <br/>
      Examples of hydrogen sources other than hydrogen gas include HBr (which requires an increased amount of carbon in the process chamber to work well), CHF3, CH2 F2, CH3 F, NH3, CH4, and combinations thereof.
      <br/>
      Several of these hydrogen-containing compounds may also serve as carbon and fluorine sources.
      <br/>
      An excellent source of carbon and fluorine is CF4.
      <br/>
      One of the plasma feed gas recipes which provides excellent results is a combination of CF4, HBr, and argon.
    </p>
    <p num="20">
      During the etching of the silicon trench which follows the break-through step, it is desirable to round the bottom corners of the finished silicon trench.
      <br/>
      We have developed a method for rounding the bottom corners which may be used in combination with either of the top corner rounding methods described above.
      <br/>
      The plasma used to etch the silicon trench is one commonly used in the art and is different from that used for the top corner rounding methods.
      <br/>
      In some instances, the substrate may be removed from the processing chamber prior to the silicon etch, but preferably the silicon oxide etch and silicon trench etch are performed in sequence in a single processing chamber.
    </p>
    <p num="21">
      In at third top corner rounding method, the silicon nitride hard mask and silicon oxide layer are first etched using "clean" etch chemistries; that is, etch chemistries that do not result in the deposition of polymer on feature surfaces during etching.
      <br/>
      After completely etching through the silicon oxide layer (and in some instances overetching slightly into the silicon substrate), a separate top corner rounding step is performed using etch chemistry which results in the deposition of a thin layer of polymer on a top corner of the trench, resulting in the formation of a rounded "shoulder" at the top corner of the trench.
      <br/>
      In particular, the top corner rounding is effected during the etching of the first portion of the silicon trench (not during the silicon oxide etch step).
      <br/>
      This reduces the amount of polymer which must be stripped after completion of etching of the trench, while providing excellent critical dimension control in a transistor device active area.
    </p>
    <p num="22">
      Typically, the hard mask comprises an inorganic material such as silicon nitride, which is plasma etched using a feed gas which does not result in polymer deposition on surfaces of the semiconductor structure during etching.
      <br/>
      The hard mask is preferably plasma etched using a feed gas which does not contain carbon.
      <br/>
      The feed gas used to etch the silicon nitride layer typically comprises SF6 or CF4, or a combination thereof, which is used in combination with HBr.
    </p>
    <p num="23">
      When there is a silicon oxide layer underlying the hard masking layer, the silicon oxide layer is typically plasma etched using a feed gas which does not contain hydrogen.
      <br/>
      Plasma etching of the silicon oxide layer is typically performed using a feed gas comprising CF4 and argon.
    </p>
    <p num="24">
      After etching of the layer directly overlying the silicon substrate (typically a silicon oxide layer) a top corner rounding step is performed.
      <br/>
      The corner rounding step is performed during etch of a first portion of a trench into the underlying silicon substrate.
      <br/>
      The etching is carried out using reactive species generated from a feed gas comprising a source of fluorine, a source of carbon, a source of hydrogen, and a source of high energy species which provides physical bombardment of the silicon substrate.
      <br/>
      A single compound (e.g., CHF3,) may be used to provide the hydrogen, carbon, and fluorine.
      <br/>
      Typically, more than one gaseous compound is used.
      <br/>
      The source of fluorine is typically selected from the group consisting of CF4, CHF3, CH2 F2, and combinations thereof The source of carbon is typically selected from the group consisting of CF4, CHF3, CH2 F2, and combinations thereof.
      <br/>
      The source of hydrogen is typically selected from the group consisting of HBr, CHF3, CH2 F2, and combinations thereof.
    </p>
    <p num="25">
      During the top corner rounding step, the carbon and hydrogen in the feed gas combine to provide deposition of a thin layer of polymer on a top corner of the trench, resulting in the formation of a rounded "shoulder" at the top corner of the trench.
      <br/>
      It is important to have a controlled amount of carbon present in the process chamber at the time of the top corner rounding step.
    </p>
    <p num="26">
      While the hydrogen and the carbon are used to form polymeric material which deposits upon the top corner of the trench during etching of a first portion of the trench, reactive fluorine-comprising species and high energy physical bombardment species provide for removal of the silicon trench substrate.
      <br/>
      The source of high energy physical bombardment species is typically selected from the group consisting of HBr, argon, krypton, xenon, helium, and combinations thereof.
    </p>
    <p num="27">
      Preferably, the top corner rounding step is performed using a process chamber pressure of at least 40 mTorr, most preferably, within the range of about 40 mTorr to about 90 mTorr.
      <br/>
      Depending on the desired final trench depth, the top corner rounding step is typically performed for a time period within the range of about 10 seconds to about 30 seconds.
      <br/>
      Etching of the silicon substrate during the top corner rounding step is typically performed to a depth of about 50 .di-elect cons. to about 200  Angstrom .
    </p>
    <p num="28">
      After performance of the top corner rounding step, the remaining portion of the trench is etched to a desired final depth, preferably using a feed gas which does not contain carbon.
      <br/>
      Trench etching is typically performed using conventional silicon etch chemistry, such as HBr/Cl2 /O2 or Cl2 /O2 or HBr, or HBr/Cl2.
    </p>
    <p num="29">
      In most applications, a trench having rounded bottom corners is desired.
      <br/>
      The term "bottom trench corner" refers to the transition from the lower sidewall of a trench to the base (bottom) of the trench.
      <br/>
      The trench is typically etched to a desired final depth in the silicon substrate using conventional silicon etch chemistry, where the plasma feed gas comprises chlorine, or oxygen, or a combination thereof.
      <br/>
      The plasma feed gas may include SF6.
      <br/>
      We have discovered that a more rounded bottom trench corner is obtained using a two-step silicon etch process.
      <br/>
      In the first silicon etch step, the trench is etched to a depth within the range of about 75% and about 95%, most preferably, within the range of about 80% and 90%, of its desired final depth.
      <br/>
      The etch chamber pressure is within the range of about 15 mTorr and about 40 mTorr.
      <br/>
      Preferably the chamber pressure is about 20 to 30 mTorr.
      <br/>
      The etch plasma is a high density plasma having an electron density ranging from about 109 to 1012 e- cm3.
      <br/>
      In the second silicon etch step, the process chamber pressure is increased to range between about 40 mTorr and about 90 mTorr.
      <br/>
      Preferably, the process chamber pressure is between about 50 mTorr to about 60 mTorr.
      <br/>
      In addition to a higher process pressure, a high substrate bias is employed during the second etch step, to ensure that the etchant species will be directed to the bottom of the trench, resulting in rounding of the bottom trench corners Optionally, SF6 may be added to the silicon trench etch plasma feed gas to assist in the corner rounding process.
      <br/>
      For a feature size of about 0.16  MU m, a typical radius obtained for a rounded bottom corner ranges from about 15 nm to about 25 nm.
      <br/>
      The second step etch is carried out using the same etch chemistry, but at a process chamber pressure within the range of about 40 mTorr to about 90 mTorr.

      The detailed methods, preferred process parameters, and experimental examples are provided below.

    <p num="31">I. AN APPARATUS FOR PRACTICING THE INVENTION</p>
    <p num="32">
      The method of the invention is preferably performed in an etch processing apparatus which provides for separate power control of a plasma generation source and a substrate biasing device.
      <br/>
      An example of such an apparatus is the Applied Materials' CENTURA.RTM. polysilicon etch system.
      <br/>
      FIGS. 1 and 2 are schematics of an individual CENTURA.RTM. DPS (tm)  polysilicon etch chamber 102 of the type used in the Applied Materials' CENTURA.RTM. polysilicon etch system.
      <br/>
      The CENTURA.RTM. DPS (tm)  polysilicon etch chamber 102 is configured to be mounted on a standard CENTURA.RTM. 5200 etch mainframe.
    </p>
    <p num="33">
      FIG. 1 shows a detailed schematic of an individual CENTURA.RTM. DPS (tm)  polysilicon etch chamber 102 of the type used in the CENTURA.RTM. etch system.
      <br/>
      The CENTURA.RTM. DPS (tm)  polysilicon etch chamber 102 consists of an upper chamber 104 having a ceramic dome 106, and a lower chamber 108.
      <br/>
      The lower chamber 108 includes a monopolar electrostatic chuck (ESC) cathode 110.
      <br/>
      Gas is introduced into the chamber via four ceramic gas injection nozzles 114.
      <br/>
      Chamber pressure is controlled by a closed-loop pressure control system 118 with a throttle valve 116.
    </p>
    <p num="34">
      FIG. 2 shows a schematic of a cross-sectional side view of the polysilicon etch chamber 102.
      <br/>
      During processing, a substrate 220 is introduced into the lower chamber 108 through inlet 222.
      <br/>
      The substrate 220 is held in place by means of a static charge generated on the surface of electrostatic chuck (ESC) cathode 110 by applying a DC voltage to a conductive layer located under a dielectric film on the chuck surface.
      <br/>
      The cathode 110 and substrate 220 are then raised by means of a wafer lift 224 and sealed against the upper chamber 104 in position for processing.
      <br/>
      Etch gases are introduced into the upper chamber 104 via the ceramic gas injection nozzles 114.
      <br/>
      The polysilicon etch chamber 102 uses an inductively coupled source 226 at 12.56 MHZ for generating and sustaining a high density plasma.
      <br/>
      The wafer is biased with an RF source 230 at 13.56 MHZ. Power to the plasma source 226 and substrate biasing means 230 are controlled by separate controllers, 228 and 232, respectively.
    </p>
    <p num="35">
      An endpoint subsystem (not shown) senses the end of the etch process by monitoring changes in the light emitted by the plasma in the etch chamber 102.
      <br/>
      The standard CENTURA.RTM. DPS (tm)  endpoint system consists of amonochromator and photomultiplier tube which automatically endpoints all etch chambers.
      <br/>
      A fiber optic cable routes light from a recessed quartz window on the chamber to the monochromator or an optional HOT (High Optical Throughput) pack photomultiplier.
      <br/>
      When the monochromator is used, light is shone into a motor-driven concave grating.
      <br/>
      Light is then reflected onto the entrance slit on the photomultiplier tube, which amplifies the light.
      <br/>
      This data is then displayed on a PC monitor.
      <br/>
      The operator sets an algorithm which controls the endpoint system.
      <br/>
      Overetching can be programmed to start either as the film begins to clear or when it has cleared completely.
      <br/>
      The endpoint time can be adjusted by changing the number of windows that the signal must exit to endpoint.
      <br/>
      The endpoint wavelength is programmable for each process step.
      <br/>
      An appropriate endpoint wavelength is selected depending on the films being etched.
    </p>
    <p num="36">
      Alternatively, the method of the invention may be performed in an etch processing apparatus wherein power to a plasma generation source and power to a substrate biasing means are controlled by a single power control, such as the Applied Materials' MXP or MXP+polysilicon etch chamber.
      <br/>
      FIG. 3 is a schematic of an Applied Materials' MXP+polysilicon etch chamber 300, which is a parallel plate plasma etch chamber of the kind which is well-known in the art.
      <br/>
      The MXP+polysilicon etch chamber offers advantages over other similar etch chambers in that it includes a simplified, two-dimensional gas distribution plate 302, which allows for more uniform gas distribution throughout the chamber.
      <br/>
      Another modification is a removable aluminum chamber liner 304, which can be easily removed and replaced during each wet cleaning procedure, allowing for a more rapid cleaning cycle.
      <br/>
      Yet another modification is an improved focus ring 306, which moves together with (rather than independently from) the cathode 308, resulting in reduced particle generation due to fewer moving parts within the apparatus.
      <br/>
      The high temperature cathode 308 has independent temperature control (not shown), which functions in response to a temperature reading from pedestal temperature probe 312, which permits operation at a temperature in excess of the process chamber temperature.
      <br/>
      The substrate to be processed (not shown) rests on an electrostatic chuck pedestal 310, which is joined to cathode 308.
    </p>
    <p num="37">As would be appreciated by one skilled in the art, the inventive method may be used in a variety of etch chambers, such as those described in, for example, U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,242,538; 5,705,081; 5,534,751; and 5,698,062.</p>
    <p num="38">II. A FIRST METHOD OF ETCHING A SILICON TRENCH HAVING ROUNDED TOP CORNERS</p>
    <p num="39">
      FIG. 4A shows a schematic of a semiconductor structure 400 comprising an etch stack overlying a silicon substrate 402.
      <br/>
      This etch stack comprises, from top to bottom, a patterned photoresist layer 408, a silicon nitride layer 406, and a silicon oxide layer 404.
      <br/>
      The thickness of the patterned photoresist layer 408 is typically within the range of about 4000  Angstrom  to about 10,000  Angstrom .
      <br/>
      The silicon nitride layer 406 typically has a thickness within the range of about 1000  Angstrom  to about 2000  Angstrom .
      <br/>
      The silicon oxide layer 404 typically has a thickness within the range of about 50  Angstrom  to about 350  Angstrom .
      <br/>
      The relative thicknesses of the film layers illustrated in FIGS. 4A-4D are not to scale.
      <br/>
      The drawings are intended only to show the relative positions of the various layers on silicon substrate 402.
    </p>
    <p num="40">
      The patterned photoresist layer 408 may be any suitable photoresist material patterned using techniques known in the art.
      <br/>
      Typically, the photoresist layer material is an organic, carbon-containing material.
      <br/>
      The thickness and patterning method for the photoresist 408 will depend on the particular photoresist material used.
      <br/>
      A frequently used photoresist is a DUV photoresist available from either JSR or Shipley.
      <br/>
      A typical film thickness for a DUV photoresist ranges from about 4,000 to about 10,000  Angstrom .
    </p>
    <p num="41">
      Referring to FIG. 4B, the silicon nitride layer 406 has been pattern etched (opened) to expose a surface 410 of the silicon oxide layer 404.
      <br/>
      Preferably, the silicon nitride layer 406 is pattern etched using a plasma generated from a plasma feed gas comprising SF6, in combination with a profile control additive such as HBr or CHF3.
      <br/>
      Etch process conditions are apparatus-sensitive, but one skilled in the art can determine appropriate conditions for a given apparatus by minimal experimentation, based on process conditions generally known in the art.
    </p>
    <p num="42">
      A "break-through" step is then performed to remove the silicon oxide layer 404 from the open patterned areas overlying silicon substrate 402.
      <br/>
      As shown in FIG. 4C, the break-through step is carried out to an "over etch" condition, so that not only is the silicon oxide layer 404 removed, but a portion of the upper surface 414 of the silicon substrate 402 is etched in a manner which generates a rounded shape 412 adjacent the sidewalls of the silicon oxide layer 404.
      <br/>
      Typically, in order to obtain the rounded shape 412 near the surface 414 of the silicon substrate 402, it is only necessary to etch the silicon substrate to a depth within the range of about 100  Angstrom  and about 400  Angstrom , preferably, within the range of about 100  Angstrom  and about 200  Angstrom , during the silicon oxide breakthrough etch.
    </p>
    <p num="43">
      The breakthrough etch is performed using a specialized plasma generated from a plasma feed gas comprising carbon and fluorine.
      <br/>
      The reactive species generated from the carbon and fluorine-comprising plasma react with the silicon oxide in layer 404 to form the volatile reaction products SiF4 and CO2.
      <br/>
      The availability of carbon from residual photoresist layer 408, and from the plasma feed gas make possible the silicon oxide etching at a lower substrate bias (typically less than about --200 V), which provides a gentle rounding of the upper trench corners, since these corners are not as highly bombarded by ions attracted by the substrate bias.
      <br/>
      In instances where there is minimal photoresist residue available, it may be necessary to increase the amount of carbon present in the plasma feed gas.
      <br/>
      This may be done by increasing the amount of a carbon-fluorine containing compound in the feed gas, by addition of a carbon-containing compound such as CH4 to the feed gas, or a combination of both.
    </p>
    <p num="44">
      The break-through etch step is carried out for a time period sufficient to provide an overetch. (For a feature size of about 0.35  MU m, a typical overetch is about 300-400  Angstrom  into the silicon substrate and the rounding of the upper corners of the silicon trench provides a rounded top corner having a radius of about 15 nm to about 25 nm).
      <br/>
      The trench is subsequently etched to a desired depth using a different etch chemistry.
      <br/>
      It is also possible that there is some formation of polymeric residue near the sidewall of the etched silicon oxide layer 404 which acts as a sacrificial mask for the silicon substrate directly underneath the silicon oxide layer, and that this contributes to the rounding of the upper corner of the silicon surface during the break-through step.
    </p>
    <p num="45">
      The plasma feed gas for the break-through step may further include oxygen (O2), which may be used to improve the top corner rounding effect.
      <br/>
      The presence of O2 during the overetch of the silicon results in the production of silicon oxide, which may serve as a passivating agent. at the edge of the top trench corner.
      <br/>
      The presence of the polymeric residue adjacent the sidewall of the etched silicon oxide layer, in combination with a silicon oxide build-up in the same area during the overetch portion of the break-through step, may contribute to formation of the rounded top corner 412 at the upper surface 414 of the silicon substrate 402 during subsequent etching of the silicon trench.
    </p>
    <p num="46">
      The principal etchant of the plasma feed gas which is used to perform the breakthrough etch may be selected from the group consisting of CF4, CHF3, CH2 F2, CH3 F, and combinations thereof.
      <br/>
      Experimental results have demonstrated that a principal etchant selected from the group consisting of CF4, CHF3, and combinations thereof works well.
      <br/>
      CF4 provides excellent results.
      <br/>
      If there is insufficient photoresist residue available, or the imaging mask used for initial patterning of the etch stack does not contain carbon, the plasma feed gas may further include CH4 to increase the amount of polymer formation.
      <br/>
      Further, the addition of O2 may be used to adjust the amount of polymer formation when CH4 is added to the plasma source gas.
    </p>
    <p num="47">
      The plasma feed gas for the breakthrough etch preferably further includes a nonreactive, diluent gas selected from the group consisting of argon, helium, xenon, krypton, and combinations thereof.
      <br/>
      The nonreactive, diluent gas is most preferably argon.
      <br/>
      The nonreactive, diluent gas dilutes the carbon and fluorine-containing gas, slowing down the overall rate of etching and increasing the selectivity of etching the silicon oxide layer relative to etching of the photoresist layer.
      <br/>
      The term "selectivity" refers either to 1) the ratio of the etch rate of a first material to the etch rate of a second material, or 2) the etch rate of a first material divided by the etch rate of a second material.
      <br/>
      If the first material has a faster rate of etching than the second material, then selectivity will be greater than 1:1.
      <br/>
      In general, a fast silicon oxide etch rate is not desired, because the silicon oxide layer is so thin that etching is completed quickly even if the silicon oxide etch rate is relatively low, and it is desired to provide time to permit formation of the polymer-oxide combination build-up adjacent the sidewall of the etched silicon oxide layer during the silicon oxide breakthrough etch step.

      Table One, below, provides process conditions for the first method of top corner rounding described above.

      In addition to providing the process conditions for the break-through, corner rounding step, the table provides process conditions for a compatible pattern etching of the silicon nitride layer.

      Silicon oxide: silicon (SiO2 : Si) etch selectivity is preferably greater than 1.
      <br/>
      The maximum SiO2 : Si selectivity (2.4) was obtained in Run -19 (refer to Table Four), using the following process conditions: 10 sccm CF4, 120 sccm argon, 30 mTorr process chamber pressure, 1200 W source power, 50 W bias power, and a 20 (degree)  C. substrate temperature.
      <br/>
      The optimum top trench corner rounding effect was observed in Run -25 (refer to Table Five), where the process conditions were the same as those in Run -19, with the following exceptions: 40 sccm CF4 and 750 W source power.
      <br/>
      A typical etch time for about 100  Angstrom  of oxide was about 20 seconds.
      <br/>
      For a given etch process, one skilled in the art can adjust the relative amount of the carbon and fluorine comprising compounds to the plasma feed gas and the amount of power applied to plasma generation to obtain a satisfactory top trench corner rounding effect, while providing an advantageous silicon oxide: silicon etch selectivity.

    <p num="62">III. A SECOND METHOD OF ETCHING A SILICON TRENCH HAVING ROUNDED TOP CORNERS</p>
    <p num="63">
      FIG. 5A shows a schematic of a semiconductor structure 500 comprising an etch stack overlying a silicon substrate 502.
      <br/>
      This etch stack comprises, from top to bottom, a patterned silicon nitride hard mask 506 and a silicon oxide layer 504 overlying a silicon substrate 502.
      <br/>
      The silicon nitride hard masking layer 506 typically has a thickness within the range of about 1000  Angstrom  to about 2000  Angstrom .
      <br/>
      The silicon oxide layer 504 typically has a thickness within the range of about 50  Angstrom  to about 350  Angstrom .
    </p>
    <p num="64">
      The break-through step used to etch through the silicon oxide layer 504 as shown in FIG. 5B is also used to create a built-up extension 508 upon sidewall 507 of silicon nitride hard mask 506.
      <br/>
      The second top corner rounding method break-through step is performed using a plasma generated from a plasma feed gas comprising a source of hydrogen, a source of carbon, a source of fluorine, and a source of surface bombardment atoms.
      <br/>
      Typically, the surface bombardment atom source is an inert plasma feed gas such as argon, helium, krypton, nitrogen, xenon, or a combination thereof.
      <br/>
      Argon works particularly well.
      <br/>
      A single compound may be used to provide the hydrogen, carbon, and fluorine.
      <br/>
      Typically, more than one gaseous compound is used.
      <br/>
      It is important to have a controlled amount of carbon present in the process chamber at the time of the break-through step.
      <br/>
      While the hydrogen and the carbon are used to form polymeric material which deposits upon the silicon nitride sidewall, the fluorine and bombardment atoms (typically argon) provide for removal of native oxide layers.
      <br/>
      Examples of hydrogen sources include H2, HBr (which requires the presence of an increased amount of carbon in the process chamber to work well), NH3, CHF3, CH2 F2, CH3 F, CH4, and combinations thereof.
      <br/>
      Several of these hydrogen-containing compounds may also serve as carbon and fluorine sources.
      <br/>
      An excellent fluorine source is CF4.
    </p>
    <p num="65">
      One of the recommended plasma feed gas recipes is a combination of CF4, HBr, and argon.
      <br/>
      The combination of the CF4 with either HBr, CH2 F2, or a combination of these gases results in the formation of a Cx Hy -based polymer on the silicon nitride sidewall 507.
      <br/>
      This combination of plasma feed gases is capable of providing polymer deposits in the absence of a photoresist, and is not dependent on the amount of residue available from a previous process step.
    </p>
    <p num="66">
      The plasma feed gas chemistry (i e., CF4, argon, and HBr or CH2 F2) is preferably made more reactive using an RF source capable of producing a higher electron density.
      <br/>
      The combination of polymer deposits with byproducts from the silicon oxide etch which make up extension 508 act as a sacrificial mask to prevent the silicon at the silicon oxide/silicon interface at the top of the trench from being etched until desired.
    </p>
    <p num="67">
      A combination of a high process chamber pressure (within the range of about 40 mTorr to about 90 mTorr) and a low substrate bias (within the range of about -300 V to about -350 V) during the silicon oxide breakthrough step enhances the chemical reaction of the gases and prevents directional etching of the silicon substrate.
      <br/>
      The depth to which the silicon 502 is etched during the breakthrough step is minimal (typically less than about 100  Angstrom  during a 20-second breakthrough etch), so silicon erosion adjacent silicon oxide layer 504 is not a problem.
      <br/>
      Argon gas may be used to enhance the plasma density and to provide bombarding high energy species which assist in break through of native oxides.
    </p>
    <p num="68">Because the extension 508 deflects the etchant species further down the substrate sidewall, the result is the formation of a more rounded shape (a corner or edge 512 having a larger radius) on the upper sidewall of the silicon substrate.</p>
    <p num="69">
      Table Six, below, provides process conditions which have shown excellent results for performlng a silicon nitride pattern etching step which is compatible with the silicon oxide break-through step, and for the silicon oxide breakthrough step in which an extension is formed on the side walls of the silicon nitride hard mask.
      <br/>
      The process conditions provided in Table Six are specific to the use of a processing apparatus in which the source power and bias power are separately controlled, such as the Applied Materials' CENTURA.RTM. DPS (tm)  polysilicon etch system.

      This etch stack comprises, from top to bottom, a patterned photoresist layer 808, a silicon nitride layer 806, and a silicon oxide layer 804.
      <br/>
      The thickness of the patterned photoresist layer 808 is typically within the range of about 4,000  Angstrom  to about 10,000  Angstrom .

      Etch process conditions are apparatus-sensitive, but one skilled in the art can determine appropriate conditions for a given apparatus by minimal experimentation, based on process conditions generally known and published in the art.
    </p>
    <p num="80">Although FIG. 8C does not show any overetch of silicon oxide layer 804 into underlying silicon substrate 802, in some instances, this is helpful in obtaining control over the critical dimension of the patterned silicon oxide layer 804.</p>
    <p num="81">
      FIG. 8D shows the structure 800 of FIG. 8C after the top corner rounding step.
      <br/>
      During the top corner rounding step, the silicon substrate is plasma etched for a short period of time (typically about 10-30 seconds, which is sufficient to provide an etch depth of about 50 to about 200  Angstrom ) using a feed gas comprising a source of fluorine, a source of carbon, a source of hydrogen, and a source of high energy species which provide physical bombardment of the silicon substrate.
      <br/>
      The carbon and hydrogen within the feed gas combine to provide deposition of a thin layer of polymer on the top corner of the trench during etching of the first portion of the trench, resulting in the formation of a rounded "shoulder" 812 at the top trench corner.
    </p>
    <p num="82">
      Preferred feed gases for use in the top corner rounding step are CHF3 /HBr/CF4 or CHF3 /Ar/CF4.
      <br/>
      CH2 F2 may be used in place of CHF3, although the use of CH2 F2 generally produces an increase in the amount of polymer deposition and may require an adjustment in the relative amounts of the plasma feed gas components.
      <br/>
      Since some of the top corner rounding polymer deposition is removed during etch of the remainder of the silicon trench, it may be preferable to use CH2 F2 for top corner rounding when the silicon trench is deeper.
      <br/>
      Krypton, xenon, helium, and combinations thereof may be used in place of HBr or argon to provide physical bombardment of the substrate.
      <br/>
      If, for example, helium is used in place of argon, a substantially greater feed rate of helium must be used to obtain equivalent physical bombardment to argon, due to the much smaller size and weight of the helium atom.
    </p>
    <p num="83">
      For a shallow trench having a final depth within the range of about 2000  Angstrom  to about 6000  Angstrom , the top corner rounding step is typically performed for a time period within the range of about 10 seconds to about 30 seconds.
      <br/>
      For deeper trenches (5000-6000  Angstrom ), the top corner rounding time should be toward the high end of this time range in order to allow for sufficient polymer deposition at the top corners of the trench.
      <br/>
      For a given trench depth, the optimum amount of time required will vary depending on the particular equipment and process conditions used, and can easily be determined through routine experimentation.
      <br/>
      Etching of the silicon substrate during the top corner rounding step is typically performed to a depth of about 50  Angstrom  to about 200  Angstrom , depending on the desired final trench depth.

      The trench is typically etched to a depth within the range of about 2000  Angstrom  to about 6000  Angstrom .

      Hydrogen-based polymers deposited on upper surfaces of the semiconductor structure will typically be removed during an oxide-based silicon trench etch.

      However, the polymer "shoulders" generated at the top corners of the trench during the trench corner rounding step are typically protected by the shadowing effect of the silicon nitride hard mask during etching of the trench into the silicon substrate.
      <br/>
      However, if silicon trench etching proceeds for a sufficient time period, the corner-rounding polymer coating may be removed.

      FIGS. 5C and 5D illustrate a two-step silicon trench etch process, wherein the first step provides a rounded top corner in the second method of etching a silicon trench having rounded top corners, and wherein the second step provides a rounded bottom corner, if desired.
      <br/>
      The two step silicon trench etch process, when used in conjunction with either the first or second method for providing top corner rounding, produces overall curved trench profiles, with minimal risk of trench stress areas.
    </p>
    <p num="93">
      In the first silicon etch step, shown in FIG. 5C, a trench 518 is etched to a depth "A", which is within the range of about 75% and about 95% of its desired final depth, using conventional silicon etch chemistry with a process chamber pressure within the range of about 20 mTorr and about 40 mTorr.
      <br/>
      For example and not by way of limitation, the first silicon etch step is typically performed using a plasma generated from a plasma feed gas comprising Cl2 and O2, under the following process conditions: 90 sccm Cl2 ; 10 sccm O2 ; 30 m Torr chamber pressure; 1,000 W source power; and 200 W bias power.
      <br/>
      Other silicon etch chemistry known in the art may be used as well.
      <br/>
      The important concept is that only a portion of the trench is etched at the initial chamber pressure, with the subsequent completion of the trench etch being carried out at increased chamber pressure.
    </p>
    <p num="94">
      In the second silicon etch step, shown in FIG. 5D, the process chamber pressure is increased.
      <br/>
      The trench 518 is etched to its desired final depth B using conventional silicon etch chemistry with a process chamber pressure within the range of about 50 mTorr and about 90 mTorr, resulting in rounding of the bottom trench corners 520.

      The term "etch profile", "trench profile", or "feature profile" generally refers to, but is not limited to, the cross-sectional profile of the sidewall of an etched feature.

      In many instances herein, the etch profile is described in terms of an angle between the sidewall and the surface on which the feature stands (i.e., the substrate).
      <br/>
      The term "vertical profile" refers to a feature profile wherein a cross-section of the feature exhibits sidewalls which are perpendicular to the surface on which the feature stands.
      <br/>
      The term "positive profile" (also known as an "undercut" profile) refers to a feature profile wherein the width of the cross-section of the feature is larger as the distance away from the opening on the substrate increases.
      <br/>
      The term "negative profile" (also known as a "tapered" profile) refers to a feature profile wherein the width of the cross-section of the feature is smaller as the distance away from the opening on the substrate surface increases.
