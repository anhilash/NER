      A polymer contains a succinimide ring substituted on the nitrogen atom by a reactive group, where the ring is supported either by the main chain or by a side chain, the polymer resulting from reacting at least one polyolefin with at least one compound containing a maleimide ring substituted on the nitrogen atom by a reactive group with formula -R-(X)n where X is a reactive group, n is a whole positive number equal to 1 or more and R is a residue containing at least one carbon atom.These polymers can be used for the production of co-extruded products, multi-layered materials, surface coatings and polymer alloys.

    <p num="1">The present invention concerns polymers containing at least one succinimide ring substituted on the nitrogen atom by a reactive group, where the ring is supported either by the main chain or by a side chain.</p>
    <p num="2">
      The properties of the polymers of the present invention are improved compared with polymers which do not contain a succinimide ring substituted on the nitrogen atom by a reactive group.
      <br/>
      In particular, they have improved adhesive properties and can thus be used as surface coatings.
      <br/>
      They are also more heat resistant than the polymers from which they are derived.
    </p>
    <p num="3">The polymers of the present invention have reactive groups which allow them to be used in the production of polymer alloys.</p>
    <p num="4">
      The polymers of the present invention can be defined as polymers containing at least one succinimide ring substituted on the nitrogen atom by a reactive group, the ring being supported either by the main chain or by a side chain, the polymers resulting from reacting at least one polyolefin obtained from at least one unsaturated monomer selected from ethylene, butenes and norbornenes, with at least one compound containing a maleimide ring substituted on the nitrogen atom by a reactive group with formula --R--(X)n where X is a reactive group, n is a number equal to 1 or more and R is a residue containing at least one carbon atom.
      <br/>
      Usually, n equals 1 and in this case the compound containing a maleimide ring used in the present invention is represented by formula 1 below:  (Chemical Structure image '1' not included in text)
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      The reactive group --X is generally selected from a hydroxyl group, a carboxylic group, a carboxamide group, a carboxylic acid halide group, a thiol group, a thiocarboxylic group, an amino group, a halogen, an epoxy group, and an esterified carboxylic group in which the ester portion contains a reactive group.
      <br/>
      When a plurality of --X groups are present, they can be identical or different.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      Very often, the reactive group is selected from groups which can react with epoxy functions by opening the oxirane ring.
      <br/>
      Usually, compounds containing a reactive group are used which are selected from a carboxylic group, a carboxamide group and an acid halide group, for example a carboxylic acid chloride group.
      <br/>
      The preferred group is the carboxylic group.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      The group --R-- is normally selected from the group formed by saturated or unsaturated, substituted or unsubstituted aliphatic hydrocarbons, and substituted or unsubstituted aromatic groups.
      <br/>
      In general, unsubstituted groups are preferred, normally groups containing at least one aromatic nucleus.
      <br/>
      Examples of groups which are frequently used are benzenic groups which are bonded in the ortho, meta or para position to the nitrogen atom and to the reactive group --X.
      <br/>
      Normally, the para or meta form is used.
    </p>
    <p num="8">The polyolefins used to produce the polymers of the present invention can be formed by homopolymerisation or copolymerisation of at least two monomers.</p>
    <p num="9">
      In one particularly preferred form, the polyolefin is selected from the group formed by high density polyethylenes and ethylene copolymers which are preferably constituted by at least 90% of ethylene moieties and at most 10% of a C3 to C8 olefin.
      <br/>
      More particularly, high density polyolefins are used which preferably have a density of about 0.9 to about 0.97 and a fusion index measured in accordance with standard ASTM D-1238 of about 0.2 to about 100 (measurements carried out under a 19.6 kg load at 190 (degree)  C.).
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      The polymers of the present invention are prepared bringing a molten polyolefin into contact with at least one compound containing a maleimide ring substituted on the nitrogen atom by a reactive group in a mixer or extruder.
      <br/>
      This preparation can be carried out with or without a radical initiator.
      <br/>
      Examples of radical initiators are peroxides.
      <br/>
      Preferably, a radical initiator is not used in the present invention.
      <br/>
      This possibility of forming, without a radical initiator, polymers containing a succinimide ring substituted on the nitrogen atom by a reactive group, the ring being supported either by the principal chain or by a side chain, constitutes a distinct advantage of the present invention which avoids the risk of cleavage and cross-linking of the polymer.
      <br/>
      The reaction temperature is normally in the range from about the fusion temperature of the polyolefin to about 300 (degree)  C. This temperature is usually about 200 (degree)  C. to about 260 (degree)  C. The reaction time is relatively short and normally does not exceed 10 minutes.
      <br/>
      An extrusion-reaction system is normally preferable as it produces very good results.
    </p>
    <p num="11">
      The present invention also concerns the use of the polymers described above for the production of surface coatings.
      <br/>
      These polymers, with good adhesive properties, are more suitable than the starting polyolefins for this application.
      <br/>
      These polymers can also be used to produce alloys of polymers, in which the reactive function improves formation of the alloys.
      <br/>
      They can also be used for the production of co-extruded products.
      <br/>
      They can also be used for the production of multi-layered materials.

    <p num="13">EXAMPLE 1</p>
    <p num="14">
      This example describes the preparation of a grafted polymer in a mixer. 42.5 grams (g) of medium density polyethylene (d=0.954) sold by FINA under the trade name Finathene 3802.RTM. and 0.42 g of 4-maleimidobenzoic acid (AMB) were introduced into a Haake Rheocord.RTM. kneader.
      <br/>
      The working temperature was 240 (degree)  C., the blade rotation rate was 64 revolutions per minute (rpm).
      <br/>
      After 5 minutes of mixing at 240 (degree)  C., the reaction product was cooled in water and dried at 60 (degree)  C. under 1 millimetre (mm) of mercury for 8 hours.

      The total rate at which the products were introduced into the extruder was 5 kilograms per hour and the reaction temperature in the extruder was held at 240 (degree)  C. The screw rotation speed was 100 rpm, the residence time was 1 minute.
      <br/>
      The rod leaving the die was cooled in water at 25 (degree)  C., granulated and dried for the adhesion tests.

      The test procedure comprised preparing metallic specimens. 600 cm3 of chromic-sulphuric acid mixture was prepared and a series of specimens was placed on a support then immersed in a receptacle containing the chromic-sulphuric acid mixture which was held at a temperature of 60 (degree)  C. After 15 minutes, the samples were withdrawn.

      They were rinsed with plenty of water and oven dried for 2 hours at 80 (degree)  C.

    <p num="27">
      An adhesive bonding surface 25.4 mm * 12.7 mm was delimited on a specimen and a maximum adhesive joint thickness of 125 * 10-6 m was delimited using shims.

      Two specimens were adhesively bonded using a DARRAGON table press preheated to 200 (degree)  C., applying a pressure of 0.5 MPa for 5 minutes.

    <p num="28">
      A traction test was then carried out with an INSTRON type machine provided with a measuring head of 105 Newton.
