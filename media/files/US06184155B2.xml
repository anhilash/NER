      <br/>
      A process for forming an ultra-thin, silicon dioxide, gate insulator layer, for narrow channel length MOSFET devices, has been developed.
      <br/>
      The process features the use of a two step, in situ steam generated, (ISSG), procedure, to grow a silicon dioxide layer at a physical thickness between about 10 to 20 Angstroms, offering a gate insulator layer with a reduction in leakage current, during standby, or operating modes, when compared to counterpart silicon dioxide layers, formed without the use of the two step, ISSG procedure.
      <br/>
      The two step, ISSG procedure is comprised of a first step, featuring a steam oxidation, and an in situ anneal, in a nitrous oxide ambient, followed by the second step of the two step, ISSG procedure, performed in situ, in the same furnace used for the first step of the two step, ISSG procedure, with the second step of the two step, ISSG procedure again comprised of a steam oxidation, followed by an in situ anneal, performed in a nitrous oxide ambient.

    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="1">(1) Field of the Invention</p>
    <p num="2">The present invention relates to methods used to fabricate semiconductor devices, and more specifically to a method used to form a silicon dioxide, gate insulator layer, for a metal oxide semiconductor field effect transistor, (MOSFET), device.</p>
    <p num="3">(2) Description of Prior Art</p>
    <p num="4">
      The advent of micro-miniaturization, or the use of sub-micron features, for MOSFET devices, have necessitated the use of ultra-thin, gate insulator layers.
      <br/>
      For example, the use of 0.13 um, (or channel lengths of 0.13 um), technology, results in a projected gate insulator layer, with a thickness in the range of 10 to 20 Angstroms.
      <br/>
      The use of these ultra-thin gate insulator layers, such as thermally grown silicon dioxide, can present unacceptable leakage rates, during the operation of the 0.13 um MOSFET device.
      <br/>
      In addition significant, and unacceptable, gate insulator leakage can occur during the standby, or off mode, of the narrow channel length MOSFET device.

      This invention will teach a process for forming ultra-thin, silicon dioxide gate insulator layers, in which the leakage rate of the thin silicon dioxide layer is reduced, when compared to counterparts formed without the use of the process described in this present invention.

      <br/>
      However that prior art does not teach the novel process, now presented, allowing ultra-thin, silicon dioxide layers to be used for sub-micron MOSFET devices, featuring reductions in leakage currents, when compared to counterparts fabricated without the benefit of this invention.

    <heading>DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
    <p num="11">
      The method of forming a MOSFET device, featuring an ultra-thin, silicon dioxide gate insulator layer, obtained via a two step, in situ steam generated, (ISSG), procedure, will now be described in detail.
      <br/>
      The ultra-thin, silicon dioxide gate insulator layer, obtained using the two step ISSG procedure, will be applied to a P channel, or PMOS, device.
      <br/>
      However the two step, ISSG grown, silicon dioxide gate insulator layer, can also be used for N channel, or NMOS devices.
    </p>
    <p num="12">
      A semiconductor substrate 1, comprised of P type, single crystalline silicon, with a &lt;100&gt; crystallographic orientation, is used and schematically shown in FIG. 1.
      <br/>
      Isolation regions 2, comprised of silicon oxide, defined as either shallow trench isolation, (STI), or field oxide, (FOX), regions, are next formed in portions of semiconductor substrate 1.
      <br/>
      The STI version is created via initially forming a shallow trench in semiconductor substrate 1, via conventional photolithographic and reactive ion etching, (RIE), procedures, followed by filling of the shallow trench with silicon oxide, via a low pressure chemical vapor deposition, (LPCVD), or a plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition, (PECVD), procedure.
      <br/>
      A chemical mechanical polishing procedure is then employed to remove portions of the silicon oxide layer, from the top surface of semiconductor substrate 1, resulting in the desired STI region.
      <br/>
      A FOX isolation region, if used as isolation region 2, is obtained via thermal oxidation of exposed regions of semiconductor substrate 1, not protected by an oxidation resistant mask pattern, such as silicon nitride.
      <br/>
      After formation of the FOX isolation region, the oxidation resistant mask pattern is selectively removed.
      <br/>
      Well region 3, an N well region for this illustration, is next formed in semiconductor substrate 1, via conventional photolithographic and ion implantation procedures.
      <br/>
      After forming a masking photoresist shape, not shown in the drawings, an ion implantation procedure, performed using phosphorous or arsenic ions, at an energy between about 40 to 80 KeV, at a dose between about 4E15 to 8E15 atoms/cm2, is employed to create N well region 3, schematically shown in FIG. 1.
      <br/>
      If this invention, the use of an ultra-thin, silicon dioxide gate insulator layer, is applied to a NMOS device, well region would be a P well region, formed using boron or BF2 implanted ions.
      <br/>
      The photoresist shape, used as a mask for definition of N well region 3, is removed via plasma oxygen ashing and careful wet cleans.
    </p>
    <p num="13">
      The method of forming the two step, ISSG, ultra-thin silicon dioxide layer, to be used as the gate insulator for a narrow channel length MOSFET device, will next be addressed.
      <br/>
      A pre-clean procedure, using a dilute hydrofluoric acid (DHF), solution is used prior to initiation of the first step, of the two step, ISSG procedure.
      <br/>
      The first step, of the two step ISSG procedure, comprises the growth of an initial silicon dioxide layer, performed in a conventional furnace, followed by an in situ anneal procedure, resulting in initial silicon dioxide layer 4a, schematically shown in FIG. 2.
      <br/>
      Silicon dioxide layer 4a, is thermally grown in a steam ambient, at a temperature between about 600 to 900 (degree)  C., resulting in a physical thickness for initial silicon dioxide layer 4a, between about 8 to 12 Angstroms.
      <br/>
      The electrical thickness of silicon dioxide layer 4a, which is measured when the MOSFET device is in an inversion mode, is greater, between about 15 to 20 Angstroms.
      <br/>
      At the conclusion of the oxidation procedure, an in situ anneal cycle, is performed in a nitrous oxide ambient, at a temperature between about 800 to 1000 (degree)  C., for a time between about 10 to 30 sec., to reduce surface states residing at the silicon dioxide--substrate interface.
    </p>
    <p num="14">
      The second step, of the two step ISSG procedure, is then performed, in situ, in the same furnace used for the first step, of the two step procedure, without exposure of initial silicon dioxide layer 4a, to the environment.
      <br/>
      The second step, of the two step ISSG procedure initiates with a thermal oxidation procedure, performed in a steam environment, at a temperature between about 600 to 800 (degree)  C., followed by another in situ anneal procedure, again performed in a NO ambient, at a temperature between about 800 to 1000 (degree)  C., for a time between about 10 to 30 sec., The second step, of the two step ISSG procedure, results in the attainment of final, silicon dioxide layer 4b, schematically shown in FIG. 3, at a physical thickness between about 10 to 20 Angstroms, or at an electrical thickness between about 20 to 25 Angstroms.
    </p>
    <p num="15">
      The completion of the MOSFET device, featuring silicon dioxide, gate insulator layer 4b, obtained via the two step, ISSG procedure, is next addressed, and schematically shown in FIG. 4.
      <br/>
      A polysilicon layer is deposited via LPCVD procedures, at a thickness between about 1000 to 2500 Angstroms.
      <br/>
      The polysilicon layer can be doped in situ, during deposition, via the addition of phosphine, or arsine to a silane ambient, or the polysilicon layer can be deposited intrinsically then doped via implantation of arsenic or phosphorous ions.
      <br/>
      Conventional photolithographic and RIE procedures, using Cl2 as an etchant for the polysilicon layer, are used to create polysilicon gate structure 5.
      <br/>
      If desired, lower word line resistance can be obtained via the use of a polycide gate structure, comprised of an overlying metal silicide layer, such as tungsten silicide, on an underlying polysilicon layer.
      <br/>
      Lightly doped, P type source/drain region 6, is next formed via implantation of boron or BF2 ions.
      <br/>
      If an NMOS device is desired, an N type, lightly doped source/drain region would be formed via implantation of arsenic or phosphorous ions.
      <br/>
      Insulator spacers 7, are next formed on the sides of gate structure 5, via deposition of a silicon oxide, or of a silicon nitride layer, via LPCVD or PECVD procedures, at a thickness between about 1000 to 2000 Angstroms, followed by an anisotropic RIE procedure, performed using CHF3 of CF4 as an etchant.
      <br/>
      Finally heavily doped, P type source/drain regions 8, are formed via implantation of boron, or BF2 ions.
      <br/>
      Again if an NMOS device is being fabricated, a heavily doped, N type source/drain region would be used, obtained via implantation of arsenic or phosphorous ions.
    </p>
    <p num="16">
      The advantage of forming a silicon dioxide, gate insulator layer, via the two step, ISSG procedure, described in this invention, is graphically illustrated in FIG. 5.
      <br/>
      The leakage current density, (Jg), for silicon dioxide layers, in PMOS devices, are shown as a function of the electrical thickness of the gate insulator layer.
      <br/>
      It can be seen that for a silicon dioxide, gate insulator layer, at an electrical thickness of about 22 Angstroms, the leakage for the two step, ISSG, silicon dioxide layer 11, described in this invention, is only at about 2 amps/cm2.
      <br/>
      Silicon dioxide layer 10, formed using the two step procedure, oxidation and in situ anneal in NO, but however allowing exposure of the initial silicon oxide layer to the atmosphere, prior to the second step, or prior to formation of the final silicon dioxide layer, resulted in a leakage of about 5 amps/cm2, while sample 9, prepared using only the first step, of the two step, ISSG procedure, resulted in a leakage of about 7 amps/cm2.
