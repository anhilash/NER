      An alkaline developing solution for a radiation sensitive composition, which has no undissolved products even when the concentration of a pigment contained in a radiation sensitive composition is high, which does not cause such problems as scum, the residue after development and re-adhesion, and which can form pixels having a sharp pattern edge.The alkaline developing solution for a radiation sensitive composition is an aqueous solution which contains (A-1) at least one inorganic alkaline compound and (A-2) at least one organic alkaline compound selected from the group consisting of alkanolamines and alkylamines or which contains the above component (A-1), the above component (A-2) and (B) at least one nonionic surfactant selected from the group consisting of etherified polyoxyethylenes and etherified polyoxyethylene-polyoxypropylene block copolymers.

    <heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="1">
      The present invention relates to an alkaline developing solution for a radiation sensitive composition and to a development method.
      <br/>
      More specifically, it relates to an alkaline developing solution, which is advantageously used for a radiation sensitive composition used in the production of a color filter that is a constituent member of a color liquid crystal display, and to a development method.
    </p>
    <heading>PRIOR ART</heading>
    <p num="2">
      A large number of proposals have been made on the production process of a color liquid crystal display (LCD).
      <br/>
      Recently, a process for aligning liquid crystals has been becoming popular that comprises forming a color filter having red, green and blue pixels and a black matrix on a transparent substrate such as glass, forming a transparent conductive film made from, for example, indium tin oxide (ITO) on the color filter by sputtering to form a transparent electrode and forming an alignment layer on the electrode.
    </p>
    <p num="3">
      There are several methods for producing such a color filter, as exemplified by such known methods as a pigment dispersion method, dying method, printing method and method for performing lamination in the same manner as a dry film.
      <br/>
      The pigment dispersion method is currently the most popular.
      <br/>
      In the pigment dispersion method, a color filter is produced by coating a radiation sensitive composition, which has an organic pigment and/or an inorganic pigment dispersed therein, by a spin coater to form a predetermined color pattern.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      Heretofore, there have been only red, green and blue pixels for the color layer of a color filter produced by the pigment dispersion method.
      <br/>
      However, as described above, attempts have recently been made to form a light shading layer, which serves as a black matrix, from a radiation sensitive composition which has a pigment such as carbon black dispersed therein.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      The radiation sensitive composition comprises an organic and/or inorganic pigment for coloration or light shading and a resin component, which can be cured by, for example, ultraviolet radiation and which is soluble in an alkaline developing solution, as essential ingredients.
      <br/>
      The pigment and the resin component must be quickly dispersed or dissolved in the alkaline developing solution when unnecessary portions are removed in the development step.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      However, in reality, there frequently occur such a problem that the radiation sensitive composition to be completely removed at the time of development remains (the residue after development) and such a problem that the pigments and the resin component, which are removed from a glass substrate to be dispersed or dissolved in the alkaline developing solution, are re-adhered to the glass substrate, black matrix or cured color layer.
      <br/>
      These problems cause an irregular color distribution in the color filter or a defect such as an adhesion failure in the post-step.
      <br/>
      Therefore, an alkaline developing solution is strongly desired that can fully disperse or dissolve both the pigments and the resin component, which are contained in the radiation sensitive composition, to remove these in the development step.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      As means for solving the above problems, JP-A 7-120935 (the term "JP-Ar" as used herein means an "unexamined published Japanese patent application") proposes an alkaline developing solution for a radiation sensitive composition, which is an aqueous solution containing an alkaline compound and 0.01 to 1.0 wt % of a nonionic surfactant and which has a pH of 9 to 13.
      <br/>
      JP-A 9-171261 proposes an alkaline developing solution for a negative color photosensitive composition, which is a buffer aqueous solution containing a nonionic surfactant and comprising a strong basic substance and a weak basic substance.

    <p num="8">However, these developing solutions also have such a problem that, when the concentration of a pigment contained in the radiation sensitive composition is high, undissolved products are liable to remain in the development step where unnecessary portions are removed, thereby causing such problems as scum, the residue after development and re-adhesion and making it impossible to form pixels having a sharp pattern edge.</p>

      The first developing solution is an aqueous solution comprising the component (A-1) and the component (A-2), and the second developing solution is an aqueous solution comprising the component (A-1), the component (A-2) and the component (B).

      Such alkaline developing solutions can be advantageously used to develop a coated film formed from a radiation sensitive composition having silica particles or fine particles of a pigment dispersed therein and a coated film formed from a radiation sensitive composition containing none of these fine particles.
      <br/>
      Even when a color filter is formed from a radiation sensitive composition having a high concentration of fine particles, the alkaline developing solutions can fully disperse or dissolve unnecessary fine particles and an unnecessary resin component in the development step, does not cause such problems as scum, the residue after development and re-adhesion, and prevents the formed pattern from peeling off from a glass substrate, thereby making it possible to form pixels having a sharp pattern edge.

      The alkaline developing solution for a radiation sensitive composition according to the present invention can fully disperse or dissolve unnecessary portions to remove them without causing the detachment of a coated film formed from a radiation sensitive composition for a color filter, particularly when the coated film is developed, even if the concentration of a pigment contained in the radiation sensitive composition is high.
      <br/>
      Therefore, it can form pixels having a sharp pattern edge without causing such problems as scum, film residues and re-adhesion.

      <claim-text>What is claimed is:</claim-text>
      <claim-text>1.</claim-text>
      <claim-text>A development method comprising developing a thin film, made from a radiation sensitive composition comprising an alkali-soluble resin and a radiation sensitive compound and having a latent image pattern, with an alkaline developing solution to form a thin film pattern, wherein the alkaline developing composition is an aqueous solution containing (A) (A-1) a water-soluble and alkaline inorganic compound and (A-2) at least one water-soluble and alkaline organic compound selected from the group consisting of 2-dimethylaminoethanol, 2-diethylaminoethanol, 2-(diisopropylamino)ethanol and 2-(di-n-butylamino)ethanol, and wherein said radiation sensitive composition further comprises silica particles or fine pigment particles.</claim-text>
