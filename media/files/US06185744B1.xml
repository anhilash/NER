    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="3">
      The invention relates to thermal garments.
      <br/>
      More particularly, the invention relates to active thermal control garments, rather than passive garments that only provide insulation to contain the body heat of the user or to block ambient heat.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      In many settings of daily life, in both work and recreational settings, a person will be subjected to excessive heat or cold.
      <br/>
      Exposure to heat and cold is common for those who work outside, and for some indoor, industrial environments.
      <br/>
      It is well-known to use insulating clothing to minimize body heat loss in a cold environment and to block high ambient temperature.
      <br/>
      It is also known to use an active, auxiliary heat source, such as an electric resistance heat insert for gloves and boots, for example.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      There are also known some high technology environment suits that provide cooling as well as heating.
      <br/>
      Such garments are, however, often found in the context of a total environment suit that includes a separate thermal unit that is connected by hoses, or the like, with a thermal barrier and insulated thermal control garment.
      <br/>
      While this may be appropriate in space exploration or in some specialized terrestrial context, there remain a great number of situations in which a worker or sportsman is subjected to excessive heat or cold, in which the known high technology approach is simply impractical, and in which the know insulating approaches are inadequate.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      Consider, for example, the great many settings in which construction workers labor in sweltering summer heat or in numbing winter cold.
      <br/>
      Active control of one's body temperature under these circumstances will minimize risks of hypothermia and hyperthermia, and will also enhance efficiency and effectiveness in performing the task at hand.
    </p>
    <p num="7">Thus, one will readily appreciate the desirability of a self contained, versatile thermal garment that a worker, or sportsman, may use to help keep warm or cool.</p>
    <heading>BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="8">
      A personal thermal garment according to the invention has a shell that is worn by the user, and that overlays and covers a substantial portion of the back and the chest of the user.
      <br/>
      The shell has inner and outer layers that are interconnected and define a chamber between the layers.
      <br/>
      The chamber extends substantially throughout the shell.
      <br/>
      Thus, the chamber also overlays a substantial portion of the back and chest of the user.
      <br/>
      An access opening is provided in the shell to access the chamber.
      <br/>
      And, a thermal insert that can be preheated to warm the user or can be precooled to cool the user is easily and conveniently inserted into and removed from the chamber, through the access opening.
      <br/>
      The thermal insert substantially conforms to the chamber and has a body portion with two leg portions that extend in the same general direction from the body portion.
      <br/>
      The access opening is sized to have a length that is about the same as a width of the thermal insert.
      <br/>
      In one aspect of the invention, the insert body substantially overlays and covers the back of the user, with one of the two legs extending over one of the user's shoulders from the insert body, and with the other of the two legs extending over the other shoulder of the user.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      In another aspect of the invention, the insert body may generally be a right quadrilateral portion that wraps around and substantially overlays and covers the user between the shoulders and hips.
      <br/>
      One of the two legs extends toward one of the user's shoulders, while the other of the two legs extends toward the other shoulder.
      <br/>
      The insert body may also have first and second opposing ends with the first leg being located near the first end, and the second leg being located near the second end.
      <br/>
      The insert may further have a third leg that extends over the user's upper back, toward the neck, from the body, and between the first and second ends.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      The thermal insert may have two congruent layers and multiple compartments defined between the two layers.
      <br/>
      At least one of the multiple compartments is sealed closed and contains a thermal storage medium.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, the insert may be constructed in one, integral piece.
    </p>
    <p num="11">These and other features, objects, and benefits of the invention will be recognized by one having ordinary skill in the art and by those who practice the invention, from the specification, the claims, and the drawing figures.</p>

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="13">
      A first embodiment of a thermal garment according to the invention is generally shown in the drawing FIGS. 1-6, and is indicated by the reference number 20.
      <br/>
      The garment 20 comprises two major parts, namely, a shell 22 and a thermal insert 24.
    </p>
    <p num="14">
      The shell 22 is worn by a user and overlays and covers a substantial portion of the back and the chest of the user.
      <br/>
      The shell 22 has inner and outer layers 26 and 28, respectively, that are interconnected to define a chamber 30 between the layers.
      <br/>
      The chamber 30 extends generally throughout the shell 22 and, thus, also overlays and covers a substantial portion of the back and the chest of the user.
      <br/>
      The inner and outer layers 26 and 28, respectively, may be constructed of any suitable material, including, and not limited to natural fiber fabrics, synthetic fiber fabrics, blended fiber fabrics, and membrane materials, for example, as will be understood by one having ordinary skill in the art.
    </p>
    <p num="15">
      Most preferably, the inner layer 26 will have an open mesh fiber construction, which may be a high pile, crush resistant cloth that is pliable to conform to the body of the user, and is porous, with good air transfer qualities, to serve as a heat control baffle, for example.
      <br/>
      The inner layer 26 may also be an open mesh of firm or stiff fibers that are interwoven to define a porous spacer that is also pliable to conform to the body of the user, and is interposed between the user and the thermal insert, for example.
      <br/>
      In any embodiment, the inner layer 26 preferably modulates or diffuses heat transfer between the user and the thermal insert 24 to distribute the heat transfer in a generally uniform or homogenous thermal flow.
    </p>
    <p num="16">
      The outer layer 28 will preferably block heat transfer between the thermal insert 24 and the user's environment to define a micro environment within the thermal garment 20, with the thermal insert acting as a heat sink to absorb heat from or radiate heat to the user.
      <br/>
      Thus, the outer layer 28 may preferably provide thermal insulation and wind blocking qualities.
      <br/>
      The thermal insulation quality may be provided by a layer of insulating material 34, such as Thinsulate brand insulation or other suitable, garment quality insulation, as one having ordinary skill in the art will understand.
      <br/>
      The wind blocking property may be provided by any tightly woven fabric 36 or a micro fiber fabric, which are currently popular in the clothing industry, for example.
      <br/>
      Thus the outer layer 28 may actually be a multiple layer component of the shell 22.
      <br/>
      The outer layer 28 may alternatively be a single layer of a material that satisfactorily provides the preselected design criteria of a particular configuration of a thermal garment according to the invention.
    </p>
    <p num="17">
      While the thermal garment 20 is specifically shown in a vest configuration, a thermal garment according to the invention may also be made in any desirable cut or fashion, including a jacket or a coat, for example.
      <br/>
      In whatever configuration the thermal garment 20 is constructed, it will include an access opening 40 with a length that extends fully across the breadth of the user to provide convenient access to the chamber 30 between the inner and outer layers 26 and 28, respectively, for unrestricted insertion and removal of the thermal insert 24.
      <br/>
      The access opening 40 is conveniently provided with a full breadth flap 42 across the shoulders of the thermal garment 20.
      <br/>
      A hook and loop fastener 44 is preferably used to hold the access opening 40 in a closed position and maximize the thermal barrier effectiveness of the outer layer 28.
      <br/>
      Although, one who practices the invention may choose to use alternative fasteners, as are known in the garment industry.
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      The thermal insert 24 substantially conforms to the chamber 30 and has a body portion 50 with two leg portions 52 that extend in the same general direction from the body portion.
      <br/>
      The body portion 50 has a width that is about the same as the length of the access opening 40 to facilitate quick and convenient insertion and removal of the thermal insert 24 into and from the chamber 30 in the shell.
      <br/>
      The body portion 50 is positioned in the chamber 30 to substantially overlay and cover the back of the user, while one of the two legs 52 extends into the chamber, over one of the user's shoulders, and the other of the two legs 52 extends into the chamber over the other shoulder of the user.
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      The thermal insert 24 may also have various constructions, including, two congruent layers 54 of material, that are aligned with one another and attached to one another along their perimeter and selectively within the perimeter to define a quilted member with an array of individual compartments 56 defined between the two layers.
      <br/>
      The array of compartments may be defined in a checker board pattern as is specifically shown in the drawing figures, or may be defined in a box quilting pattern as is understood by one having ordinary skill in the art.
      <br/>
      Each of the individual compartments 56 is filled with a thermal material during assembly of the thermal insert 24.
      <br/>
      The choice of how the compartments 56 are defined may be affected by the selection of thermal material.
    </p>
    <p num="20">
      In one embodiment of the thermal insert 24, the two layers 54 may be any conventional durable and pliable fabric material and the thermal material may be ceramic beads, for example.
      <br/>
      In a second, alternative embodiment of the thermal insert 24, the two layers 54 maybe a water tight material and the thermal material may be a "freezable" or heatable liquid or jell, for example.
      <br/>
      Of course, the thermal insert will most preferably remain pliable even after freezing, as will be understood by one having ordinary skill in the art.
      <br/>
      Also, the two layers 54 may be attached to one another with any suitable method, according to the material selected, including sewing, gluing, or welding, for example, as will be understood by one having ordinary skill in the art.
    </p>
    <p num="21">
      In use, the thermal garment 28 may be worn by the user to warm or cool the user and to generally insulate the user from his environment.
      <br/>
      The garment 20 will commonly be prepared for wearing by preheating the thermal insert 24 in an oven or the like or precooling the thermal insert in a refrigerator or freezer or the like.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, the insert 24 may simply be stored at room temperature for use in a moderate environment, to provide a heat sink.
      <br/>
      With the thermal insert 24 previously prepared by heating or cooling and the like, the insert is inserted into the chamber 30 of the garment 20 through the access opening 48.
      <br/>
      So assembled, the garment 20 is worn by a user and the thermal insert 24 generally surrounds the torso of the user, to provide a heating or cooling thermal source.
      <br/>
      With the thermal insert spaced from the user by the thermal baffle of the inner layer 26, heat flow between the user and the insert 24 is moderated to minimize hot and cold spots.
    </p>
    <p num="22">
      A first alternative embodiment 120 of a thermal garment according to the invention is a generally shown in the drawing FIGS. 7-9. The garment 120 also comprises two major parts, namely a shell 122 and a thermal insert 124, each substantially as discussed above in greater detail regarding the garment 20, shell 22 and thermal insert 24.
      <br/>
      The garment 120 differs from the garment 20, discussed above, in the configuration of the thermal insert 124 and the access opening 140.
      <br/>
      Because of the substantial similarities between the garments 20 and 120, common reference numbers will be used for common elements, and only the differences will be discussed.
    </p>
    <p num="23">
      In the thermal garment 120, the access opening 140 is positioned adjacent the front placket of the garment and incorporated into the perimeter seam between the inner and outer layers 26 and 28, respectively, of the shell.
      <br/>
      The access opening 140 may be closed with a hook and loop fastener, a zipper, or an alternative fastener, as is known in the garment industry.
      <br/>
      With the access opening 140 located along the front placket 160 of the garment 120, the thermal insert 124 is fed through the access opening and into the chamber 30 to wrap around the user.
    </p>
    <p num="24">
      Depending upon the specific requirements of the user, the thermal insert 124 may have alternative configurations.
      <br/>
      In a first configuration, the thermal insert 124 has a quadrilateral body portion 150 with two opposing ends, and two legs 152 that extend in the same general direction from the body portion (FIG. 9).
      <br/>
      One of the two legs 152 is located at one of the two opposing ends, and the other of the two legs 152 is located at the other of the two opposing ends of the body portion 150.
      <br/>
      A third leg 154 is generally centered between the first two legs 152, and extends from the body portion 150 in the same general direction as the two legs 152.
      <br/>
      While the two legs 152 extend over the chest, from the body portion 150 toward the neck or shoulders, of the user, the third leg extends up the back of the user toward the neck or shoulders of the user, when worn.
    </p>
    <p num="25">
      In a second configuration (not shown), the thermal insert has a generally quadrilateral body portion without any legs.
      <br/>
      This is substantially only the body portion 150 of the insert 124.
      <br/>
      In this configuration, the thermal insert is useful to thermally protect the vulnerable lower thoracic area of the user.
      <br/>
      Further, the second configuration of the thermal insert may be used in combination with the first configuration 122 for extreme conditions to further protect the vulnerable lower thoracic area.
    </p>
    <p num="26">
      A second alternative embodiment 220 of a thermal garment according to the invention is a generally shown in the drawing FIG. 10. The garment 220 also comprises two major parts, namely a shell 222 and the thermal insert 124, again each substantially as discussed above in greater detail regarding the garments 20 and 120, shell 22 and thermal insert 124.
      <br/>
      The garment 220 differs from the garment 120, discussed above, in the configuration of the access opening 240.
      <br/>
      Again, because of the substantial similarities among the various embodiments of the garments 20, 120, and 220, common reference numbers will be used for common elements, and only the differences will be discussed.
    </p>
    <p num="27">
      In the thermal garment 220, the access opening 240 is positioned at the bottom hem of the garment and incorporated into the bottom hem seam, between the inner and outer layers 26 and 28, respectively, of the shell.
      <br/>
      The access opening 240 may be closed with a hook and loop fastener, a zipper, or an alternative fastener, as is known in the garment industry.
      <br/>
      With the access opening 240 located along the bottom hem of the garment 220, the thermal insert 124 is fed upward through the access opening and into the chamber 30.
    </p>
    <p num="28">
      It will be understood by one having ordinary skill in the art and by others, that various modifications and improvements may be made without departing from the spirit of the disclosed concept.
      <br/>
      Various relational terms, including left, right, front, back, top, and bottom, for example, are used in the claims only to convey relative positioning of various elements of the claimed invention.
