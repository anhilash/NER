    </p>
    <heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">This invention relates to improvements in progressive cavity style devices of the type composed of a helicoidal rotor acting with a complimentary helicoidal stator and also well known as a "Moineau pump" which is used in this instance as a motor to drive other equipment.</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="3">
      Progressive cavity pumps have been known since their invention was disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 1,892,217, entitled "Gear Mechanism" to Moineau.
      <br/>
      The helicoidal rotor and the stator engage with each other along a sealing line to create cavities which progress axially as the rotor is rotated relative to the stator.
      <br/>
      Because of the required sealing and sliding contact concept of a Moineau pump, the stator and the rotor become subject to extensive wear, which necessitates frequent replacement of the stator and/or the rotor.
      <br/>
      Commercially available Moineau pumps, as well as those disclosed in the prior art, require extensive disassembly of the pumping apparatus to replace the worn stator and/or rotor, in addition to the down time loss of use.
      <br/>
      In a pump device, rotary motion is applied to the rotor which causes fluids and solids to be passed therethrough.
      <br/>
      Where the progressive cavity device is used as a motor, one method is to apply fluid pressure to the cavity to cause the rotor to rotate, the power therefrom having many uses.
      <br/>
      In the case of use in drilling wells, the ability to decrease the frequency of down time and extend the useful life of the motor is a desired objective.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      In a progressive cavity pump or motor, problems arise because the axial centerline of the rotor is required to orbit or gyrate relative to the centerline of the stator.
      <br/>
      Thus, there is a great deal of flexture that must be accounted for to obtain long life of parts.
      <br/>
      The art is filled with various types of universal joints, flexible shafts, and mechanical connections to compensate for the orbital or gyrating type of motion.
      <br/>
      Many of these are disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,923,376 and 2,739,650.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      Heretofore, the conventional Moineau pump and motor art has used a rubber or elastomer materials bonded to steel for the stator contact surface.
      <br/>
      Such elastomers include not only natural rubber, but also synthetics, such as G.R.S., Neoprene, Butyl and Nitrile rubbers, although there are other types such as soft PVC.
      <br/>
      The key, of course, is to make the elastomer property soft enough to maintain the sealed cavity, yet be hard enough to withstand the abrasive wear from the working contact between the rotor and the stator.
      <br/>
      The rotor in these instances is usually made of steel.
      <br/>
      Some efficiency of the pump/motor is lost because the elastomer mold must be thicker at the peaks of the helicoid in order to create the progressive cavity.
      <br/>
      This lack of uniform thickness creates compressibility differences which, at increasing pressures, causes bypass of the fluids being pumped.
      <br/>
      Thus, the pump/motor reaches a point where it is less efficient at ever increasing pressure.
      <br/>
      Because of the different thicknesses, there are different expansion characteristics and different rates and the pump does more work and builds up heat from the friction.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      Rubber used as the stator contact surface is not preferable in high temperature environments because of its low heat conductivity.
      <br/>
      In addition, as progressive cavity devices increase in diameter and/or length, flow characteristics to maintain a successful and long lasting bond of the rubber to a steel housing becomes more difficult.
      <br/>
      Also, where hydrocarbons make up the material to be pumped, such as in oil producing wells, rubber is known to deteriorate.
      <br/>
      One attempt to overcome these problems is taught in U.S. Pat. No. 3,912,426 by using multiple stators connected in series with separate but connected rotors for each stator.
      <br/>
      The stators surfaces, however, are still composed of rubber.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      Moineau type rotor and stator devices have been used heretofore for downhole drilling motors for drilling straight or deviated boreholes in earth formations.

    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="12">
      It is an overall object of this invention to disclose new forms of stators, rotors and flex shafts for increasing the efficiency and longevity of progressive cavity motors.
      <br/>
      To that end, a primary object of this invention is to provide the use of composites or variations of composites alone or in combination with elastomers in the makeup of the stator and/or rotor and/or flex shaft of progressive cavity motors.
    </p>
    <p num="13">Another object is to provide a progressive cavity motor manufactured according to this invention which are capable of use in not only downhole drilling of well bores but for other above ground industrial applications.</p>
    <p num="14">
      Another object of the invention is to provide a progressive cavity style motor in which the output power is available from either end of a rotor.
      <br/>
      In all cases, the rotary power is derived by forcing fluid to flow into the cavity between the stator and rotor from an inlet to an outlet delivering rotary power at the end or ends of the rotor.

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading>
    <p num="16">
      While the invention has been described with a certain degree of particularity, it is manifest that many changes may be made in the details of construction and the arrangement of components without departing from the spirit and scope of this disclosure.
      <br/>
      It is understood that the invention is not limited to the embodiment set forth herein for purposes of exemplification, but is to be limited only by the scope of the attached claim or claims, including the full range of equivalency to which each element thereof is entitled.
    </p>
    <p num="17">
      FIG. 1 is a simple representative of a typical progressive cavity or Moineau type motor according to this invention.
      <br/>
      Such motors include a basic housing 10 through which power fluid enters at 12 into the cavities 28 formed between the rotor and stator to create the rotary motion of the rotor.
      <br/>
      Specifically, the motor is made up of the helicoid stator 20, and a matching helicoid rotor 30.
      <br/>
      The rotor includes a flex shaft 40, which in this embodiment is supported by bearings 42 and packing as needed.
      <br/>
      The pressure fluid exits through or around drill bit 56 via ports 58.
      <br/>
      The flex shaft 40 and appropriate bearing supports must translate the rotation and gyration of rotor 30 to true rotary motion of shaft 40 which is imported to, in this instance, drill bit 56.
      <br/>
      The flex shaft 40 must be able to withstand the motor thrust and torque loads, yet be flexible to the gyrational and eccentric motion of rotor 30.
      <br/>
      Drill pipe bearing support systems as found in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,636,151 and 3,840,080 are inclusive for use with this aspect of the invention.
      <br/>
      The invention herein is directed for use in all forms of progressive cavity motor applications, the specific invention being in the makeup of the stator and/or the rotor and/or flex shaft utilizing composite materials.
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      Composite materials are typically defined to include carbon fibers, boron fibers, ceramic fibers, glass fibers, thermoplastic fibers, natural fibers, metallic fibers, fibrous reinforced and synthetic fibers, all of which are typically impregnated with thermal setting resins.
      <br/>
      Typical of such thermal setting resins are the alkyd polyesters, general purpose epoxy, general purpose phenolic and urea-formaldehyde compositions.
    </p>
    <heading>THE STATOR</heading>
    <p num="19">
      The stator formulations of this invention are best described herein with reference to the cross-section shown in FIGS. 2 and 3 which are used herein to describe the various alternate embodiments by reference to those portions of the stator identified as 22, 24 and 26, the latter being the surface by which the rotor 30 will sealably function within the cavities 28.
      <br/>
      The various stator embodiments are capable of being formed by a variety of methods, including molding and/or machining and thus, provide formulations that can be adapted to a variety of motor uses and environments.
      <br/>
      Although the drawings indicate the use of an outer housing 10, it is to be understood that in some usages the invention herein could be made up utilizing the stator area without the outer housing 10.
    </p>
    <heading>EMBODIMENT A</heading>
    <p num="20">
      In this embodiment, stator 20 is comprised of areas 22 and 24 of a composite material which acts as a supportive structure for the helicoid interface 26 of a rubber elastomer.
      <br/>
      The rotor 30, is comprised of steel or composite materials as hereinafter described.
      <br/>
      Areas 22 and 24 may be on one unitary member or plural layers of composites in differing characteristics and compositions.
    </p>
    <heading>EMBODIMENT B</heading>
    <p num="21">In this embodiment, areas 22 and 24 are made of a composite material, while the helicoid liner 26 is a thermoplastic resin.</p>
    <heading>EMBODIMENT C</heading>
    <p num="22">In this embodiment, composite material will make up the total stator, including areas 22, 24 and 26.</p>
    <heading>EMBODIMENT D</heading>
    <p num="23">In this embodiment, areas 22 and 24 are of hardened materials, either machinable or moldable, such as steel or ceramics, with the bonded inner lining 26 being formulated of a composite material.</p>
    <heading>EMBODIMENT E</heading>
    <p num="24">
      The supportive structure 22 and 24 is comprised of a composite material wherein the resin is formulated to create some elastomeric properties with the inner rotor contact surface 26 being of composite material having little or no elastomeric properties.
      <br/>
      Such a stator of this embodiment will provide an improved sealing and wear surface between the rotor and stator surfaces, thereby increasing mechanical efficiency as well as reducing heat during the motor action.
      <br/>
      This construction allows for expansion and contraction of the stator parts together, since the thermal transfer coefficient of the composite is higher and capable of wicking off the resulting frictional heat caused by the rotor to stator action.
    </p>
    <heading>EMBODIMENT F</heading>
    <p num="25">
      Areas 22 and 24 would be comprised of a rubber elastomer with the inner rotor contact surface 26 being a bonded composite material.
      <br/>
      In this embodiment, the elastomer becomes protected from any deteriorating or abrasive produced fluids and solids and destructive friction between the rotor and stator.
    </p>
    <p num="26">
      Referring now to FIG. 3, a combination stator and rotor is configured in a variety of manners.
      <br/>
      In one embodiment, the stator inner face 26 would be of a composite having elastomeric properties with the supporting outer zones 22/24 being a non-compressible composite for use with rotors of steel or noncompressible composite.
      <br/>
      Various combinations are possible when the rotor 30A is of two part construction of an inner core 98 and outer surface 100.
      <br/>
      For instance, if the inner core 98 is a non-compressible composite and the outer surface 100 elastomeric composite or rubber, the preferred stator comprising areas 22, 24 and 26 would be non-compressible.
      <br/>
      Vice-versa, if the core 98 is an elastomeric composite and the outer surface 100 is a non-elastomeric composite, the stator 30 elements 22, 24, and 26 would then be a non-elastomeric, non-compressible composite, or surface 26 made of an elastomeric composite, while area 24 and 26 are non-compressible composites.
    </p>
    <p num="27">
      An alternate embodiment is shown in FIG. 4 wherein the power from the rotor may be taken off of at one or both ends as may be applicable to an industrial need.
      <br/>

    <heading>ROTOR AND FLEX SHAFT</heading>
    <p num="28">
      In one embodiment of this invention for use with any of the stator embodiments, the rotor may be steel or formed of a composite material.
      <br/>
      Another embodiment is to form the rotor 30, and the flex shaft(s) 40 and/or 50 as a single unitary member such as shown in FIG. 5 wherein the flex shaft 40A is combined with a connecting means 42.
      <br/>
      In another embodiment a separate rotor as shown in FIG. 6 includes means such as threaded bore 60 which can be attached to a separately made flex shaft.
      <br/>
      The rotor and the flex shaft can be formed in a variety of ways such as utilizing a resin transfer mold (RTM) for making complex configurations.
      <br/>
      One method of forming a flex shaft and/or rotor is shown in FIG. 7.
      <br/>
      Metal or composite end fittings 60 and 62 include an outer molded or machine threaded portion 64 and 66 respectively for connection to the rotor at one or both ends.
      <br/>
      The fittings include first inner shoulders 68 and 70 for retaining the composite fibers axially to provide tensile and shear strength.
      <br/>
      Adjacent the inner shoulders are polygonal, usually hexagonal, surfaces 72 and 74 respectively.
      <br/>
      Inner cylindrical portions 76 and 78 provide a surface to retain a mandrel 80.
      <br/>
      Mandrel 80 may be any form of material, plastic or metal and is used to assemble the parts and provide support for the process of forming the composite structure of the flex shaft.
      <br/>
      The mandrel 80 is to have flexibility in and of itself.
      <br/>
      After assembly of parts 60, 62 and 80, the process of winding resin impregnated composite fibers occurs by rotating the assembly relative to the resin impregnated composite fibers 86 in one angular direction and fibers 88 in the opposite direction, typically 45 (degree)  as shown, or by rotating the fibers around a fixed mandrel, until the height thereof matches the outer diameter of flanges 60 and 62.
      <br/>
      Each layer adds anywhere from between 0.025 to 0.040 inches (0.64 to 1.0 mm) per layer.
      <br/>
      The resin used makes up about 40% of the resulting composition, and because of the wrapping of the layers of composite 86 and 88 in the manner shown, the fibers are oriented at an angle to the sheer plane of the flex shaft.
      <br/>
      Thus, such a construction, as described, permits the orbital, gyrational, or eccentric movement of the flex shaft relative to an axial power source required to operate a progressive cavity pump.
    </p>
    <p num="29">
      Another embodiment of flex shaft is shown in FIG. 8 being so constructed to create a flex point 94 formed as a concave indentation less than diameter D. The location of the flex point will vary with the characteristics of the motor including size.
      <br/>
      The flex point can be formed by changing, via computer controlled means, the angular direction of the composite fibers and/or resin materials at the point or area where flex is desired.
      <br/>
      For instance, during a filament winding at +45 (degree)  and 45 (degree)  up to section 96 (FIG. 7), the angular direction would be changed to angles less than 45 (degree)  to create a flex section without decreasing overall diameter D.
    </p>
    <p num="30">
      Ordinarily, the flex shaft and rotor used in progressive cavity motors are made of steel.
      <br/>
      Utilizing a composite flex shaft permits the use of materials which are antiisotropic.
      <br/>
      To make a steel flex shaft more flexible consists of either reducing the wall thickness or making the diameter smaller.
      <br/>
      Both of these methods reduce the strength of a metallic flex shaft, especially to fatigue.
      <br/>
      Utilization of a type of composite fiber and the alignment of these fibers permits a larger wall thickness while providing maximum strength and maximum flexibility required in the eccentric orbital motion.
      <br/>
      Composite materials are inherently better in fatigue application than metals, nor will they rust, corrode or react with the chemicals found in oil production environment; yet, the materials can be used in environments exceeding 600 (degree)  F. (315 (degree)  C.).
      <br/>
      Overall, the strength, fatigue and stiffness of composite materials are found to be equal to and in most cases exceeding the specifications of metals, including titanium, steel, aluminum, etc.
    </p>
    <p num="31">One example of a progressive cavity motor comprised constituent material of:</p>
    <p num="32">E-Type Fiberglass of Owens Corning.</p>
    <p num="33">DPL Epoxy Resin from Shell Chemical Co.</p>
    <p num="34">Lindride 6K hardener from Lindeau Company</p>
    <p num="35">
      Uncurred sheet rubber 0.075" thick was loaded with Teflon&amp; and lubricant supplied by Kirkhill Rubber Co.. The stator was formed by laying up strips of the rubber on a helicoidal mandrel.
      <br/>
      The composite of fiberglass and resin plus hardener in a ratio of 100/88 resin/hardener were then filament wound over the rubber.
      <br/>
      The assembly was then cured in an oven at a temperature of approximately 300 (degree)  F. (150 (degree)  C.).
      <br/>
      The composite becomes essentially non-compressible.
      <br/>
      The helicoid rotor was steel.
      <br/>
      Initial tests in this form as a pump indicated a longer run life to failure than an ordinary elastomeric rubber stator.
    </p>
    <p num="36">
      A flex shaft was constructed as per FIG. 7 using:
      <br/>
      E-Type Fiberglass,
      <br/>
      DPL Epoxy Resin
      <br/>
      Lindride 6K Hardener, and
      <br/>
      Machined Metal End Fittings
    </p>
    <p num="37">
      A thin, flexible tube 80 of polyolefin, sold by Phillips Petroleum under the name DRISCOLL, acts as a mandrel that is bonded to and holds the end fittings 60 and 62 in space.
      <br/>
      Next, the fiberglass and epoxy is filament wound as shown  +- 45 (degree)  (88 and 86) over the assembly until it is built up to the desired outer diameter.
    </p>
    <p num="38">
      The terms "elastomeric" or "resilient" as used with reference to composites is accomplished by variations in the composite fibers and/or the resin formulations to achieve the desired characteristic.
      <br/>
      For example, HELOXY flexablizer by Shell Chemical Co. is added to the DPL-862 Epoxy Resin in an amount within the range of 20-40% by weight.
      <br/>
      This is then mixed with a hardener and TEFLON.RTM. powder in an amount to maintain a workable (flowable) mixture which is then applied to the fiber in the formation of a stator and/or rotor.
      <br/>
      The resulting composite is oven cured at 300-400 (degree)  F. (150-200 (degree)  C.) for approximately four hours.
