      The conductance may be adjusted of an electronic circuit including a first electronic component having a nominal conductance with a given inaccuracy.
      <br/>
      The circuit includes at least one additional field effect transistor connected in parallel with the component.
      <br/>
      The sources of all field effect transistors are connected to a common source, the drains of all field effect transistors are connected to a common drain, and a control unit controls the gate voltage of each field effect transistor individually.
      <br/>
      The gate voltage is controlled by connecting the gate voltage of each field effect transistor either to a common gate or to the common source.
      <br/>
      The component may be used to form switches or amplifiers or to control the conductance of circuits including other electronic components serially connected with the electronic circuit.

    <heading>BACKGROUND</heading>
    <p num="3">
      In many electronics implementations mechanical relays are used.
      <br/>
      There has long been a desire to replace the mechanical relays with solid state circuits or switches, that may be integrated in silicon components.
      <br/>
      Such circuits have a number of advantages compared to the conventional mechanical relays:
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      they normally take up less space on the circuit board
      <br/>
      they enable a higher degree of integration and thereby also a higher degree of flexibility.
      <br/>
      they are normally able to switch from off-state to on-state and vice versa much faster than mechanical relays.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      A major drawback with designing electronic system using solid state switches is that their resistance in the on state, or on-resistance, is relatively high compared to mechanical relays.
      <br/>
      Further, for several applications, the resistance in the on-state has to have an exact value, which can be hard to reach using a solid state switch solution.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      In some applications two switches are used together, for example, to connect or disconnect the signal loop between a subscriber and a line circuit in a telephone network.
      <br/>
      In this case it is important to match the switches to substantially the same resistance, as differences in on-resistance between them will result in deterioration of the longitudinal balance for the signal loop, making the network more sensitive to common mode noise.
      <br/>
      To keep the longitudinal balance for the signal loop at an acceptable level, the difference in resistance between the two switches should be kept below 1 OMEGA .
      <br/>
      A number of switches may be used together in a line circuit, for example, for testing purposes.
      <br/>
      These switches should also be matched to each other as perfectly as possible.
      <br/>
      The switches inside the signal loop must also work bidirectionally, that is, they must be able to conduct current in both direction and handle both negative and positive high voltages.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      The use of two mirrored transistors, for example, in differential amplifiers or line drivers, also requires exact tuning of the mirrored transistors, to minimize the error introduced in the differential signal by the amplifier or driver itself.
      <br/>
      It is then important that the output characteristics of the transistors are well tuned both in the linear region (where channel-conductance and on-resistance are defined) and in the saturation region (where the trans-conductance is defined).
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      Further, because of the requirements on high linearity, even for low voltage drops across the switch is low, it is feasible to use field effect transistors (FETs) rather than bipolar solutions to implement the switch.
      <br/>
      The linearity is needed to mask out signal distortion.

      Field Effect Transistors are unipolar, multielectrode semiconductors, comprising four regions, commonly referred to as ground, source, drain and body.
      <br/>
      Normally, the body region is connected together with the source region.
      <br/>
      Current may flow in conducting channels between the source and the drain, and is modulated by an electric field applied at the gate.
      <br/>
      Application of a suitable bias across the transistor causes charge carriers to flow from the source to the drain of the transistor, that is, the current is controlled by the difference between the gate voltage and the source/drain voltage.

      The inaccuracy of a single transistor is determined by variations in the manufacturing process and in the properties of the material used.
      <br/>
      The inaccuracy of the conductance of a transistor is approximately 10%.
      <br/>
      The difference in on-resistance between two switches used in a pair should be kept below 1 OMEGA .
      <br/>
      Normally, therefore, transistors with an on-resistance up to 10 OMEGA  are used in such applications.
    </p>
    <p num="11">
      To reduce the inaccuracy in the on-resistance of a switch, the absolute value of the on-resistance is kept low.
      <br/>
      For example when used to connect and break the signal loop in a telephone network, an on-resistance lower than 20 OMEGA , or even 10 OMEGA  is required to fulfil the requirements of a mismatch lower than 1 OMEGA .
      <br/>
      Also, the performance at high voltages must be very good, typically for breakdown voltages higher than 300V for the switch.
      <br/>
      The requirements on on-resistance and high breakdown voltage together makes a switch based on FETs quite spacious.
    </p>
    <p num="12">
      A common transistor switch for analogue applications may also comprise two field effect transistors of opposite channel type, connected in parallel.
      <br/>
      The respective drains and sources of the two transistors are tied together to become the switch terminal, while the gates of the transistors are used to control the on/off action.
      <br/>
      Essentially, the n channel transistor is on for positive gate-to-source voltages and off for negative gate-to-source voltages (vice versa for the p channel transistor).
      <br/>
      The on characteristic for such a transistor switch is then sensitive to variations in the conductance of both the n and the p channel transistor.
    </p>
    <p num="13">To fulfil the above requirements on good linearity, high breakdown voltage, and low mismatch of the on-resistance of the switches, and also achieve a low mismatch of the conductance of transistors, currently the devices are overdimensioned, to keep the total on-resistance lower than what is really necessary.</p>

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS</heading>
    <p num="37">
      FIG. 1A is a graph showing typical output characteristics for a FET.
      <br/>
      Three curves show the output when three different gate voltages VGS1, VGS2 and VGS3, respectively, are applied.
      <br/>
      The current IDS and the voltage VDS between the drain and the source of a FET are shown along the vertical and the horizontal axis, respectively.
      <br/>
      The region to the left of a vertical dotted line is the linear region of the transistor, in which the current IDS increases in a substantially linear way with increasing VDS.
      <br/>
      The region to the right of the vertical dotted line is the saturation region, in which the current IDS is substantially constant for a constant gate voltage VGS.
    </p>
    <p num="38">
      When the transistor is used as switch, the on state, is in the linear region, that is, to the left of the vertical dotted line, in other words, for low values of VDS.
      <br/>
      The region used for the on state is indicated as Ron on the vertical axis.
      <br/>
      This serves both to keep the forward voltage drop VDS as low as possible and to achieve linear transistor characteristics with respect to the current IDS and the voltage VDS.
      <br/>
      In the linear region, for a constant VGS, the channel conductance GD is defined as GD =dIDS /dVDS.
    </p>
    <p num="39">If the transistor is sufficiently linear GD may be taken to be 1/RON, RON being the on-resistance.</p>
    <p num="40">
      A dashed line indicates a typical resistive load line for when the transistor is used as an amplifier.
      <br/>
      When used as an amplifier, the transistor operates in the saturation region of the graph shown in FIG. 1A. In this region, the current IDS between the drain and the source is controlled by the gate voltage VGS.
      <br/>
      The characteristics of the transistor is then primarily determined by its transconductance GM, that is, for a constant VDS, GM =dIDS /dVGS.
    </p>
    <p num="41">
      FIG. 1B is a graph showing typical output characteristics for a FET with the same gate voltages VGS1, VGS2 and VGS3, respectively as in FIG. 1A. The current IDS and the voltage VDS from the drain to the source of a FET are shown along the vertical and the horizontal axis, respectively.
      <br/>
      Three different curves for each VGS : the middle, solid line indicates the situation when the conductance corresponds to the nominal conductance, that is, G=Gnom.
      <br/>
      The lower, dashed line and the upper, dotted line show the deviation that may be caused by the inaccuracy of the conductance, that is, G=Gnom- DELTA G and Gnom+ DELTA G, respectively.
    </p>
    <p num="42">
      The present invention will enable a finer tuning of both the channel conductance GD and the transconductance GM of the component than prior art techniques.
      <br/>
      Therefore, references in this document to the conductance G of the transistor, or the switch, should be taken to include both the channel conductance GD, the transconductance GM and also the on-resistance RON.
    </p>
    <p num="43">
      FIG. 2A shows a prior art bidirectional switch obtained by serially connecting two FETs TR1, TR2, each comprising a source S1, S2, a drain D1, D2 and a gate G1, G2.
      <br/>
      The sources S1, S2 of the first TR1 and the second TR2 transistors have been connected so that the transistors TR1, TR2 mirror each other, to enable the switch to function bidirectionally, that is, regardless of the direction of the voltage across the switch.
    </p>
    <p num="44">
      FIG. 2B shows another example of a prior art bidirectional switch comprising a first TR3, TR4 and a second pair TR5, TR6 of transistors each comprising one n type and one p type transistor.
      <br/>
      The sources and the drains, respectively, of the first transistor pair TR3, TR4 are interconnected to form a common source and a common drain.
      <br/>
      In the second transistor pair TR5, TR6, the gates and the drains, respectively, are interconnected.
      <br/>
      The gate of one transistor TR3 in the first pair is connected to the common gate of the second pair TR5, TR6.
      <br/>
      The gate of the other transistor TR4 of the first pair is connected to the common drain of the second pair TR5, TR6.
    </p>
    <p num="45">
      FIG. 2C shows a prior art differential amplifier comprising two transistors TR7, TR8.
      <br/>
      The sources of the two transistors are interconnected and connected to ground through a resistor.
      <br/>
      The gate voltages of the transistors form the input to the amplifier, and voltage between the drains forms the output of the amplifier.
      <br/>
      A number of different embodiments of this basic structure are known.
      <br/>
      In all of them it is important that the conductances of the two transistors are substantially equal.
    </p>
    <p num="46">
      FIG. 3 shows an assembly T of transistors T1, T2, . . . , TN connected in such a way that they can be trimmed to a specific conductance with a very low inaccuracy.
      <br/>
      The package T comprises a first transistor T1, which is always connected, and a number of smaller transistors T2, T3, . . . , TN, each of which is individually connectable in parallel with the first transistors T1.
    </p>
    <p num="47">The sources S1, S2, S3, . . . , SN of all transistors T1, T2, T3, . . . , TN are connected to a common source S. The drains D1, D2, D3, . . . , DN are connected to a common drain D.</p>
    <p num="48">The gates G2, G3, . . . GN of the transistors that are to be connected will be connected to the gate G of the first transistor T1, thus this gate also constitutes the gate of the transistor assembly T; the ones that are not to be connected will be connected to the common source contact S.</p>
    <p num="49">This is shown in the FIG. 3 as a control unit CU in which the gates, G2, G3, . . . GN of each of the transistors T2, T3, . . . , TN is connectable either to the common gate G or to the common source contact S, schematically shown in the figure as switches 2, 3, . . . , N. Obviously, instead of providing the connection means, the switches could be implemented individually for each transistor.</p>
    <p num="50">
      The switches 2, 3, . . . , N may be implemented in a number of different ways.
      <br/>
      One relatively simple solution is to use two low voltage FETs for each switch, one connecting the gate G2, G3, . . . , GN to the common gate G and one connecting the gate G2, G3, . . . , GN to the common source.
      <br/>
      The low voltage FETs must then be controlled so that only one of them is closed at any given time.
      <br/>
      As the voltage across these low voltage FETs will never exceed the maximum voltage between the gate and the source of the inventive switches, and they will always be used to apply a voltage to the gate of the inventive switches, they may be made very small compared to the high voltage FETs used in the switches according to the invention.
      <br/>
      The on- or off-status of the switches 2, 3, . . . , N, may then be software controlled directly from a CPU, EEPROM or a similar kind of unit.
    </p>
    <p num="51">Alternatively, the switches 2, 3, . . . , N could consist of fuses or anti-fuses which in a procedure of trimming of the conductance value are chosen to be shorted or broken.</p>
    <p num="52">
      Thus the transistor assembly will function as a single transistor and can be used in any transistor application.
      <br/>
      It is, however, particularly useful for applications requiring a very exact conductance, such as differential amplifiers or line drivers.
      <br/>
      In FIG. 3, n type Field Effect Transistors are used.
      <br/>
      As will be readily understood, p type Field Effect Transistors could also be used.
      <br/>
      Further, the FETs might be, for example, Metal Oxide Semiconductor Field Effect Transistors (MOSFET), Junction Field Effect Transistors (JFET), Metal Semiconductor Field Effect Transistors (MESFET), lateral or vertical Double Diffused MOSFET) or similar components.
    </p>
    <p num="53">FIG. 4 shows a similar assembly to the one shown in FIG. 3, but instead of the main transistor T1 in FIG. 3, a resistor R1 is used.</p>
    <p num="54">
      A number of transistors T2', T3', . . . , TN' having gates G2', G3', . . . , GN, sources S2', S3', . . . , SN' and drains D2', D3', . . . , DN', are connected in the same manner as in FIG. 3, with the sources S2', S3', . . . , SN' connected to a common source S', and to a first leg of the resistor, the drains D2', D3', . . . , DN' connected to a common drain D' and to a second leg of the resistor.
      <br/>
      The gates G2', G3', . . . , GN are connectable, in a control unit CU', by switches 2', 3' and N', respectively, to one of the common gate G' and the common source S'.

    <p num="55">In the following it will be shown how the relative error of the conductance of the transistor may be reduced according to one embodiment of the invention, shown in FIG. 3, if the whole package T is seen as one transistor, having a conductance of G.

    <p num="78">FIG. 5A is a schematic representation of the reasoning discussed in connection with equations (1)-(11).</p>
    <p num="79">On the first vertical axis A, the nominal conductance G1nom of the main transistor T1 is shown, with its maximum deviations G1nom+G1max above G1nom and G1nom- DELTA G1max the same distance below G1nom.</p>

    <p num="81">
      On the third vertical axis 3, the two extreme situations in which the first additional transistor T2 will be connected are shown: In the first situation, the actual conductance of the first transistor is the lowest possible conductance, G1min=G1- DELTA G1max.
      <br/>
      The first additional transistor is therefore connected, to produce the total conductance G1min+G2nom, with the inaccuracy  +-  DELTA G2max.

      In the second situation, the actual conductance of the first transistor is equal to G1nom.

      The adjustable switch according to the invention will be especially useful in applications in which two switches are used, that should be tuned to each other as accurately as possible.

      One such application, as explained above, is a differential amplifier.
      <br/>
      Another important application is a subscriber line in a telecommunications network.

      The Subscriber Line Interface Circuit SLIC comprises a first A1 and a second A2 amplifier, one for each subscriber line.

      The resistance of the incoming and outgoing subscriber lines in this application, including both the switches sw1, sw2 and the amplifiers A1, A2, resistors R4 and R5, and other components that have been left out for clarity, should be kept as low as possible to reduce the noise.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the switches should be tuned not only with respect to each other, but with respect to the total conductance of the subscriber lines.
      <br/>
      If amplifiers according to the invention, like the amplifier shown in FIG. 7, are used, the amplifiers may also be used for controlling the conductance of the subscriber lines.
