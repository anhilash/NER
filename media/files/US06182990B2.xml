      The ends of parallel members 39, 42 include wheel attachment means such as axle-receiving stub members 39a, 42a.
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      Side folding support members 60, 61 are substantially identical and pivotally connected to side rail portions 21, 22, respectively, by substantially identical angle-shaped clamps 49, and releasably secured by suitable releasable couplers 62, such as thumb screws, to flooring 63 and lower frame portions 31, 32 respectively.
      <br/>
      Each side member is comprised of a length of tubing bent into a generally right angle configuration having a rounded right angle portion and substantially equal adjacent sides, or legs.
      <br/>
      The rounded right angle portion is connected at its center thereof by couplers 62 to flooring 63 and the adjacent legs are pivotally connected at the ends thereof by angle-shaped clamps 49 to its respective side rail portions 21,22.
      <br/>
      Side members 60, 61 are restrained from sliding longitudinally on rails 21, 22, by appropriate stops such as welded beads 21a, 22a.
      <br/>
      The configuration of angle-shaped clamps 49 is discussed in more detail hereinbelow.
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      H-shaped front folding support frame 40 is pivotally coupled intermediate upper frame member 20 and lower frame 30, and includes a main support formed of first and second upright side tubes with an interconnecting cross-bar.
      <br/>

      <br/>
      The bottom two free arms 40b are pivotally connected by T-shaped clamps 50 one to lower frame portion 33 between rounded corner 33a and lower frame member 39, and the other to frame portion 33 between rounded corner 33b and frame member 40.
      <br/>
      Interconnecting cross-bar 40c includes a second connector means, such as apertured stub 40d, for attachment of hitch assembly 70.
    </p>
    <p num="20">
      Likewise, the generally identical rear H-shaped support member 41 is pivotally coupled intermediate upper frame member 20 and lower frame 30 at the rear of the cargo enclosure.
      <br/>
      The top two arms 41a are pivotally connected by T-shaped clamps 50 to upper frame rear rail portion 24, and its bottom two arms 41b pivotally connected by T-shaped clamps 50, one to lower frame portion 34a and one to frame portion 34b.
    </p>
    <p num="21">
      FIG. 4 is an exploded sectional view of T-shaped clamp 50.
      <br/>
      The clamp 50 is formed of two mirror image parts, each having crossbar, or in-line portions 50a, 50b and stem portions 50c, 50d.
      <br/>
      In-line portions 50a, 50b are configured for matingly enclosing tubing therethrough, the inside diameter of the mated portions being slightly greater that the enclosed tubing to permit pivoting of the clamp about the enclosed tubing.
      <br/>
      Stem portions 50c, 50d are configured for matingly receiving tubing 41b therein, portions 50c and 50d fixedly retaining tubing 41b by attachment means such as screw and nut 50e, 50f, respectively.
      <br/>
      Angled clamps 49 are similarly constructed except that the stem portion is angled from the in-line portion.
    </p>
    <p num="22">
      FIGS. 3 and 5 show the frame structure in two positions during collapse, or folding, the wheel and hitch assembly having been removed.
      <br/>
      As best shown in FIG. 3, the couplers 62 (one shown) have been released and the side support members 60, 61 folded inwardly and upwardly by pivoting of clamps 49 in the directions shown about rails 21 and 22.
      <br/>
      As shown in FIG. 5, the front and rear H-shaped members 40, 41 have been pivoted by means of T-shaped clamps 50 to fold the upper frame member 20 rearwardly and downwardly in the directions shown to fully collapse the trailer with the upper frame member 20 generally overlying the lower frame member 30.
    </p>
    <p num="23">
      Hitch assembly 70 is formed of tubular material and includes a hollow portion 70a configured for fitting between the apertured stubs 33d, 40d, portion 70a configured for receiving therethrough a rod (not shown) having thumb screw head 70b and a threaded end for threadable attachment to threaded stub 33d.
      <br/>
      Portion 70a has welded thereto U-shaped member 70d proximate the top end thereof and member 70c proximate the bottom thereof, the open ends of member 70d attached to a respective side of the axle of the bicycle rear wheel, and the open ends of member 70c welded to member 70d as support arms.
    </p>
    <p num="24">
      The construction of the trailer is substantially of aluminum tubing, primarily of one diameter, thus effecting economies of assembly.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, with the primary exception of the hinge assembly and rounded corners of the upper and lower frames, the other tubular stock consists of straight lengths of material.
      <br/>
      In use, the trailer 30 is stable and efficient.
    </p>
    <p num="25">
      While the description of the trailer 10 has utilized directional references, such as up, down, right, left, clockwise, rearwardly, etc., is it to be understood that these terms are utilized with reference to the orientations in the figures and are not intended to be limiting.
      <br/>
      The construction of the trailer 10 is of aluminum tubing which, with the exception of angle-shaped interconnectors 49 and T-shaped interconnectors 52, are all of the same diameter, thus effecting economies of fabrication.
      <br/>
      In addition, the pivotal interconnectors 49, 50 are formed of injected plastic of wall thickness sufficient to provide stability at the points of connection, and as pivot axes are dimensioned and configured for providing support in the lengthwise direction of the tubes connected.
    </p>
    <p num="26">While there has been shown and described a preferred embodiment, other adaptations and modifications may be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention.</p>
