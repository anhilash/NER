      1.
      <br/>
      Field of the Invention
    </p>
    <p num="3">The present invention is directed generally to processes used in the manufacture of solid state electronic devices and, more particularly, to processes used in the manufacture of memory devices employing metal oxide semiconductor field effect transistors (MOSFETs).</p>
    <p num="4">2. Description of the Background</p>
    <p num="5">
      The fabrication of MOSFETs is itself a complex process.
      <br/>
      The fabrication of devices which employ MOSFETs is equally complex, if not more so.
      <br/>
      For example, fabrication of MOSFETs requires an understanding of crystal structures and the methodologies for adding and selectively removing material from a crystalline wafer.
      <br/>
      Material may be added by oxidation, diffusion, ion implantation, and chemical deposition to name a few techniques.
      <br/>
      Removal of material may be accomplished, for example, by ion etching, chemical etching, and plasma etching.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      Putting all those various steps together to build a device which has hundreds of thousands of MOSFETs interconnected to form a complex device such as a Static Random Access Memory (SRAM) is a complicated matter.
      <br/>
      When designing a circuit, other considerations come into play such as heat dissipation, line capacitance, speed, etc.
      <br/>
      Also of primary importance is the particular technology chosen and its inherent limitations.
      <br/>
      For example, using photolithography places a lower limit of about 0.25 microns on the size of components or component parts.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      The drive for ever more complicated devices has driven the size of individual components to the smallest size compatible with the technology used to produce the device.
      <br/>
      In some circumstances, planar space on chips has become so scarce that devices like capacitors are formed in trenches or stacked on top of other devices to save space.
      <br/>
      In any event, such small, closely packed devices must nevertheless each carry out the function for which they are fabricated in a manner that does not interfere with neighboring devices.
      <br/>
      To permit that, sometimes components, component parts, or spacing between components are made larger than the smallest dimension permitted by the fabrication technology to insure proper operation.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      Other considerations in the fabrication of complicated devices such as SRAMs are the number of masks needed to fabricate the device and the number of process steps required.
      <br/>
      It may be that a desirable geometry simply requires too many additional process steps or the creation of one or more additional masks such that the advantage gained by the desirable geometry is more than offset by the inefficiencies encountered in its production.
      <br/>
      It thus becomes a very difficult engineering problem to design desirable geometries that satisfy all the requirements demanded of the finished device and which can be produced economically by commercially available processes.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      One example of this type of engineering problem can be seen in the design and fabrication of nibble structures.
      <br/>
      A nibble structure is that portion of a poly gate which extends past the active area and over a portion of the field oxide.
      <br/>
      It is desirable to have the poly gate extend past the active area to ensure good overlap onto the active area, but not too far over the field oxide so as not to interfere with a neighboring poly gate.
      <br/>
      Current practice dictates making the nibble structure larger than a minimum size to insure that rounding off that occurs during the creation of openings in the poly layer does not make the nibble structure too small.
      <br/>
      Also, typical commercially available photolithography techniques require that the openings between poly gates be a minimum of 0.25 microns.
      <br/>
      It is thus necessary to increase the spacing between devices to insure that when the opening is made, and rounding off occurs, the resulting nibble structure is not too small.
      <br/>
      It would be advantageous to create nibble structures and poly gate spacings that are as small as possible, and to do so without requiring the use of additional masks and associated process steps.
    </p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="10">
      The present invention is directed to creating ultra-small nibble structures using a modification of an already existing mask.
      <br/>
      The method is comprised of the steps of depositing a layer of nitride on a circuit being fabricated according to standard MOSFET process steps.
      <br/>
      A layer of photoresist is patterned using a modification of an existing mask such as a contact mask modified to include a nibble pattern.
      <br/>
      The nitride layer and an underlying oxide layer are removed according to the patterned photoresist to create a contact opening and an opening over the field oxide.
      <br/>
      Spacers may be created in the opening over the field oxide.
      <br/>
      A conductive layer and a polysilicon layer exposed in the opening over the field oxide are removed extending the opening down to the field oxide to create a nibble structure in the polysilicon layer.
    </p>
    <p num="11">
      Use of the spacer in the opening over the field oxide permits the poly to poly spacing above the field oxide to be approximately 0.15 microns.
      <br/>
      Use of the spacers also eliminates rounding of the poly gate.
      <br/>
      That allows the nibble structure to be designed ultra-small because the process will not result in the structure being fabricated smaller than designed.
      <br/>
      The opening over the field oxide is created using a modification of an existing mask, for example a contact mask, so that no additional mask step is required.
      <br/>
      That allows a desirable geometry to be fabricated without uneconomical modifications of existing fabrication processes.
      <br/>
      Those advantages and benefits of the present invention, and others, will become apparent from the Description of the Preferred Embodiments hereinbelow.

    <heading>DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
    <p num="13">
      FIG. 1 illustrates a portion of a wafer 10 on which a local oxidation of silicon (LOCOS) process has been performed.
      <br/>
      The LOCOS process is well known in the art and is not described in detail herein.
      <br/>
      The LOCOS process results in field oxide regions 12, 13, 14.
      <br/>
      Between the field oxide regions 12 and 13 is a region of gate oxide 16.
      <br/>
      Between the field oxide regions 13 and 14 is a region of gate oxide 17.
      <br/>
      As is known in the art, the gate oxide regions 16 and 17 may be formed as part of the LOCOS process or, after the LOCOS process, the gate oxide regions may be stripped and thermally regrown for the process of providing al more pure gate oxide.
      <br/>
      The particular process used on the wafer 10 to form field oxide regions 12, 13, 14 and gate oxide regions 16, 17 is not of particular importance with respect to the method of the present invention.
    </p>
    <p num="14">
      A polysilicon layer 19 is deposited over the gate oxide regions 16, 17 and field oxide regions 12, 13, 14.
      <br/>
      A first conductive layer 21, for example a layer of Wsix, is deposited over the polysilicon layer 19.
      <br/>
      A first layer of oxide 23 is deposited over the first conductive layer 21.
      <br/>
      The layers 19, 21, and 23 may have the following exemplary thicknesses: 2,000 angstroms, 1,200 angstroms, and 4,000 angstroms, respectively.
    </p>
    <p num="15">
      A layer of photoresist (not shown) is applied on top of the first layer of oxide 23.
      <br/>
      The layer of photoresist is patterned using a poly gate pattern.
      <br/>
      Thereafter, an etch is performed which selectively removes portions of the first layer of oxide 23, first layer of conductive material 21, and polysilicon layer 19 to achieve the configuration illustrated in FIG. 2.
    </p>
    <p num="16">
      With the wafer configured as shown in FIG. 2, it is now possible to perform an implant in the active area as shown by arrows 24.
      <br/>
      The material and energy level used for the implant depends upon the desired characteristics of the completed device and does not form a feature of the present invention.
      <br/>
      For example, phosphorus or arsenic implants may be performed to create areas 25 which have an excess of electrons.
    </p>
    <p num="17">
      Turning to FIG. 3, after the removal of any remaining photoresist, a layer of nitride 27 is deposited on the wafer.
      <br/>
      The nitride is preferably a thin layer approximately 200 angstroms thick.
      <br/>
      The nitride layer 27 is covered by a layer of photoresist (not shown) which is patterned using an existing mask which has been modified to include the nibble pattern.
      <br/>
      In the exemplary process being discussed, the existing mask is an exhume contact mask that has been modified to include the nibble pattern.
      <br/>
      Depending on the process, some other mask may be a more appropriate choice to modify to include the nibble pattern.
      <br/>
      Thereafter, the wafer is subjected to a nitride/oxide etch which selectively removes portions of nitride layer 27 and oxide layer 23 as shown in FIG. 4.
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      In FIG. 4, it is seen that an opening 29 for the exhume contact is formed and an opening 31 over field oxide 12 is formed.
      <br/>
      The opening 31 will be used to define the length of the nibble structure which will be formed by that portion of the polysilicon layer 19 which extends over the edge of the field oxide region 12.
      <br/>
      After the openings 29 and 31 have been created, the remainder of the photoresist is removed.
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      Turning to FIG. 5, a second layer of oxide (not shown), such as a teos oxide, is deposited.
      <br/>
      The oxide layer may be on the order of 1,000 angstroms thick.
      <br/>
      The teos oxide is then etched with an etch that stops on nitride.
      <br/>
      The result of that etch is to create spacers 33 in opening 31.
      <br/>
      Spacers 34 are also formed in opening 29.
      <br/>
      A spacer 35 is formed on that portion of the polysilicon layer 19, conductive layer 21, and oxide layer 23 which collectively form a gate terminal 37 of a transistor.
      <br/>
      A spacer 39 is also formed on top of field oxide region 13 adjacent the exposed edge of the polysilicon layer 19, conductive layer 21, and first layer of oxide 23.
    </p>
    <p num="20">
      Turning to FIG. 6, a wet nitride etch is performed which removes all of the remaining exposed nitride layer 27.
      <br/>
      Thereafter, an implant may be performed in the active area as represented by the arrows 41.
      <br/>
      The particular implant that is performed is not relevant to the method of the present invention and is therefore not further described.
    </p>
    <p num="21">
      In FIG. 7, the substrate is subjected to a process which deposits a second layer of conductive material 43, for example titanium or doped polysilicon.
      <br/>
      A third layer of oxide 45 is deposited on the layer of conductive material 43.
      <br/>
      Thereafter, photoresist is applied and patterned according to a conductive metal pattern, such as a titanium pattern.
      <br/>
      Thereafter, a dry oxide/titanium/poly etch is performed which removes portions of the conductive layer 43, oxide layer 45 (leaving behind selected portions as shown in FIG. 7), and etches the conductive layer 21 and polysilicon layer 19 exposed in opening 29.
    </p>
    <p num="22">
      The opening 29 is approximately 0.25 microns in width before the spacer 33 is created.
      <br/>
      After the spacer 33 is created, the width of the opening tapers from the top of the first layer of oxide 23 to the bottom of the first layer of oxide 23 as shown in FIG. 8.
      <br/>
      At the bottom of the first layer of oxide 23, the opening 29 is approximately 0.15 microns wide.
      <br/>
      Thereafter, as a result of the etch, the width of the opening remains substantially constant at 0.15 microns through the first conductive layer 21 and the layer of polysilicon 19.
      <br/>
      When the etch cuts through the poly layer 19, a nibble structure 48 is formed.
      <br/>
      In the prior art, nibble structures are on the order of 0.2 to 0.25 microns.
      <br/>
      Using the method of the present invention, ultra-small nibble structures on the order of 0.1 to 0.15 microns can be fabricated.
    </p>
    <p num="23">After the nibble structure 48 is formed, the remaining photoresist is removed, and the wafer is subjected to standard processing steps, which are not shown.</p>
    <p num="24">
      The present invention represents several advances over the prior art as illustrated in FIG. 9 which is a top view looking down onto two gate oxide regions 16 separated by a field oxide region 12.
      <br/>
      First, the nibble structure 48 formed by that portion of the poly layer 19 which extends beyond gate oxide region 16 to overlap field oxide region 12 can be precisely controlled.
      <br/>
      It is not necessary to make the nibble structure longer than needed for fear that rounding as a result of the photolithographic process, shown in FIG. 9 by dashed lines, will excessively shorten the nibble structure.
      <br/>
      The use of the spacer 33 insures that rounding does not occur and that the cut 50 of the polysilicon layer 19 occurs where desired thereby insuring the proper size of the nibble structure 48.
    </p>
    <p num="25">
      Additionally, the cut 50 in the polysilicon layer 19 is only 0.15 microns wide thereby allowing devices (active areas 16) to be laid out somewhat closer together.
      <br/>
      That, combined with the shortening of the length of the nibble structure, represents a substantial savings in surface area thereby allowing for greater component densities.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, the aforementioned advantageous geometry is achieved by modifying an exhume contact pattern to create the opening 29 over the field oxide region 12 at the same time that the exhume contact opening is formed.
      <br/>
      Therefore, no additional mask step is required.
    </p>
    <p num="26">
      While the present invention has been described in conjunction with preferred embodiments thereof, many modifications and variations will be apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art.
