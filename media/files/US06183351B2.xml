    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="1">The present invention relates to a method of supplying a chemical mechanical polishing liquid and an apparatus therefor.</p>
    <p num="2">
      Logic devices in the semiconductor devices are required to exhibit excellent high speed performances.
      <br/>
      In order to form multilevel interconnection structure, a process is necessary for carrying out a chemical mechanical polishing to a metal layer such as a tungsten layer, wherein an oxidizing agent is used for oxidizing the metal layer as a chemical polishing and subsequently removing the oxidized metal layer with polishing particles as a mechanical polishing.
      <br/>
      In order to rise the rate of the chemical and mechanical polishing, it is necessary to use an oxidizing agent as a solvent which has a large oxidizing capability.
    </p>
    <p num="3">
      The chemical mechanical polishing to the tungsten layer may be carried out by polishing agents.
      <br/>
      One of the available polishing agents which may, for example, comprise a mixing solution of hydrogen peroxide and iron nitrate as an oxidizing agent added with silica particles.
      <br/>
      Other available polishing agent comprises a polishing solution including KI03 as an oxidizing agent and alumina particles.
      <br/>
      Further another available polishing agent is an iron nitrate polishing solution showing a high polishing rate.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      FIG. 1 is a schematic view illustrative of a conventional chemical mechanical polishing system, wherein an iron nitrate is used as a polishing liquid Iron Fe acts as a catalyst in the hydrogen peroxide solution for Fenton's oxidation to efficiently generate OH-radicals.
      <br/>
      Oxidizing power of the OH-radicals oxidizes tungsten to form WO42- ions which promotes chemical etching to tungsten, resulting in an increase in rate of the chemical mechanical polishing.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      Heavy metal such as Fe is added in small amount into the solvent for increasing the oxidizing power.
      <br/>
      However, such heavy metal is likely to reside on the polishing surface of the device.
      <br/>
      This residual heavy metal contaminates the device thereby deterioration in performances and characteristics of the contaminated device, whereby the reliability of the semiconductor device is lowered.
      <br/>
      In addition the residual heavy metal on the device also results in a further contamination of the as a cross contamination of the production line or manufacturing line.
      <br/>
      The cross contamination is extremely serious problem when the logic device is manufactured in the common production lime to DRAM which requires an extremely high cleaning level.
    </p>
    <p num="6">In the above circumstances, it had been required to develop a novel method of chemical mechanical polishing to a metal layer in surface of a semiconductor device free from the above problems.</p>

      FIG. 3B is a cross sectional view illustrative of a polishing liquid activation system of a polishing liquid feeding system in a chemical mechanical polishing system.
      <br/>
      The polishing liquid activation system 5 has a quartz glass tube 13 for allowing the polishing liquid to be flown through the quartz glass tube 13.
      <br/>
      The polishing liquid activation system 5 also has a mercury lamp 12 positioned over the quartz glass tube 13 for irradiating an ultraviolet ray through the quartz glass tube 13 onto the polishing liquid, whereby the polishing liquid is activated by the ultraviolet ray to form OH-radicals.

      The mirror 14 reflects the ultraviolet ray to the quartz glass tube 13 for re-irradiation of an ultraviolet ray through the quartz glass tube 13 onto the polishing liquid, whereby the mirror improves the efficiency in irradiation of the ultraviolet ray onto the polishing liquid.
      <br/>

      FIG. 5 is a diagram illustrative of a variation in relative absorbance of hydrogen peroxide to an ultraviolet ray having various wavelengths over wavelength of the absorbable ultraviolet ray.
      <br/>
      An absorption wavelength band of the hydrogen peroxide solution is a low wavelength band of not higher than 300 nanometers, for which reason an available wavelength range of the ultraviolet ray is 150-320 nanometers.
      <br/>
      As the ultraviolet ray irradiation lamp, a high pressure mercury lamp, a low pressure mercury lamp, a xenon lamp having an emission peak at about 250 nanometers are also available.

      The flow rate of the polishing liquid through the quartz glass tube 13 is controlled by the third and fourth valves 7 and 8 so that the time duration for irradiation of the ultraviolet ray onto the polishing liquid is adjusted.
      <br/>
      This adjustment in the tine duration for irradiation of the ultraviolet ray onto the polishing liquid results in adjustment in an amount of the generated OH-radicals in the polishing liquid, wherein the OH-radicals are generated by the irradiation of the ultraviolet ray onto the polishing liquid.
    </p>
    <p num="40">
      In accordance with the present invention, only hydrogen peroxide is used as the oxidizing agent without using iron nitrate.
      <br/>
      Irradiation of the ultraviolet say to hydrogen peroxide in the polishing liquid generates the OH-radicals which increase the oxidizing power of the polishing liquid.
      <br/>
      After the activation of the polishing liquid by irradiation of the ultraviolet ray to hydrogen peroxide in the polishing liquid, the activated polishing liquid is supplied onto the polishing pad within a possible short time for suppressing or preventing a deterioration in oxidizing power of the activated polishing liquid.
      <br/>
      The polishing liquid activated by the ultraviolet ray irradiation is initiated to become deteriorated after five minutes from the activation of the polishing liquid, for which reason it is preferable to feed the activated polishing liquid onto the polishing pad within one minute without exposing the same to an atmosphere.
      <br/>
      It is also preferable that the length of the downstream side tube of the feeding pipe is not longer than 5 meters.

      Notwithstanding, the above novel chemical maniacal polishing is applied to polish a copper or aluminum layer in a surface of the semiconductor wafer.

    <p num="43">
      An example of the above present invention will be described.
      <br/>
      A polishing solution having 20% by weight of silica particles which have an averaged diameter in the range of 0.05 micrometers to 0.2 micrometers is stored in the polishing solution tank 1.
      <br/>
      A hydrogen peroxide solution is stored in the hydrogen peroxide solution tank 2.
      <br/>
      The polishing solution is fed at a flow rate of 120 cc/min to the polishing liquid tank 3 and the hydrogen peroxide solution is fed at a flow rate of 30 cc/min to the polishing liquid tank 3.
      <br/>
      The polishing solution and the hydrogen peroxide solution are mixed in the polishing liquid tank 3 thereby to form the polishing liquid.
      <br/>
      The polishing liquid is fed through the feeding pipe having the polishing liquid activation system 5 onto the polishing pad 10 at a flow rate of about 50 cc/min.
      <br/>
      The flow rate of the polishing liquid is controlled by the third and fourth valves 7 and 8.
      <br/>
      The quartz glass tube 13 has a diameter of 4 millimeters for allowing the polishing liquid to be flown through the same.
      <br/>
      The mercury lamp 12 has a square-plate shape of 10 centimeters.
      <br/>
      The mercury lamp 12 is distanced from the quartz glass tube 13 by 1 centimeter for irradiating an ultraviolet ray having a wavelength of 248 nanometers through the quartz glass tube 13 onto the polishing liquid, whereby the polishing liquid is activated by the ultraviolet ray to form OH-radicals.
      <br/>
      The mirror 14 is provided in an opposite side to the mercury lamp 12 with reference to the quartz glass tube 13 so that the quartz glass tube 13 extends through an inter-space defined between the mercury lamp 12 and the mirror 14.
      <br/>
      The mirror 14 reflects the ultraviolet ray to the quartz glass tube 13 for re-irradiation of the reflected ultraviolet ray through the quartz glass tube 13 onto the polishing liquid, whereby the mirror improves the efficiency in irradiation of the ultraviolet ray onto the polishing liquid.
      <br/>
      The quartz glass tube 13 is of course transparent to the ultraviolet ray.
      <br/>
      The quartz glass tube 13 extends in zigzag or snake form so that the quartz glass tube 13 extends throughout the inter-space between the mercury lamp 12 and the mirror 14.
      <br/>
      A downstream side tube 6 of the feeding pipe is defined between the polishing liquid activation system 5 and a polishing liquid supply port through which the polishing liquid is supplied onto the polishing pad 10.
      <br/>
      The downstream side tube 6 has a length of about 1 meter.
      <br/>
      The downstream side tube 6 may comprise a polyvinyl alcohol tube.
      <br/>
      The polishing liquid is free of any metal such as iron nitrate, for which reason no metal such as Fe remains on the polished surface of the wafer after the chemical mechanical polishing is carried out.
      <br/>
      Since the irradiation of the ultraviolet ray onto the polishing liquid containing hydrogen peroxide generates OH-radicals which provides a large oxidizing power which is substantially the same as the conventional polishing liquid containing iron nitride the polishing rate of the novel chemical mechanical polishing by use of the metal free polishing liquid is substantially the same as the polishing rate of the conventional polishing liquid containing iron nitride even the novel chemical mechanical polishing by use of the metal free polishing liquid is free from the problem with heavy metal contamination to the polished surface of the semiconductor wafer.

    <p num="44">
      In order to evaluate the influence of exposure of the activated polishing liquid to the atmosphere, the metal free polishing liquid of the present invention is activated and then exposed to an atmosphere so as to measure variation in amount of OH-radicals generated by the activation of the polishing liquid by the ultraviolet ray irradiation over time.
      <br/>
      FIG. 6 is a diagram illustrative of a variation in measured amount of OH-radicals generated by the activation of the polishing liquid by the ultraviolet ray irradiation over time after the ultraviolet ray irradiation.
      <br/>
      The amount of the OH-radicals generated in the polishing liquid by the ultraviolet ray irradiation is simply decreased as time passes from the ultraviolet ray irradiation.
    </p>
    <p num="45">
      In order to also evaluate the influence to the amount of OH-radicals by the length of the downstream feeding tube 6 from the polishing liquid activation system 5, the metal free polishing liquid of the present invention is activated and then fed through the so as to measure variation in amount of OH-radicals generated by passing the polishing liquid through the downstream feeding tube 6 having various lengths over the length of the downstream feeding tube 6.
      <br/>
      FIG. 7 is a diagram illustrative of a variation in amount of OH-radicals generated by passing the polishing liquid through the downstream feeding tube having various lengths over the length of the downstream feeding tube.
      <br/>
      The amount of the OH-radicals generated in the polishing liquid by the ultraviolet ray irradiation is simply decreased as the length of the downstream feeding tube becomes longer.

    <p num="46">
      FIG. 4 is a diagram illustrative of concentrations of residual Fe as contaminating the polished surface of the wafer both when the conventional chemical mechanical polishing method is carried out by using a conventional iron nitrate containing polishing liquid and when the novel chemical mechanical polishing method is carried out by using a novel iron nitrate free polishing liquid activated by the ultraviolet ray irradiation.
      <br/>
      After the conventional chemical mechanical polishing method was carried out, then the measured concentration of the residual Fe on the polished surface of the wafer is about 1 * 1012 atoms/cm2.
      <br/>
      This high concentration level of the residual Fe on the polished surface of the wafer requires a cleaning process for removing the contaminating residual Fe from the polished surface of the wafer without, however, etching, the metal layer such as tungsten, tungsten nitride or titanium layer shown on the polished surface of the wafer.
      <br/>
      By contrast, after the novel chemical mechanical polishing method was carried out, then the measured concentration of the residual Fe on the polished surface of the wafer is about less than 1 * 1010 atoms/cm2.
      <br/>
      This low concentration level of the residual Fe on the polished surface of the wafer requires no cleaning process for removing the contaminating residual Fe from the polished surface of the wafer.

      <br/>
      Those metals are oxidized by the polishing liquid and also the oxidation is promoted by the OH-radicals generated by the ultraviolet ray irradiation.
