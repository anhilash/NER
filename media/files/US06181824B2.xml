    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">
      The present invention relates to a code string editing apparatus, a picture coded signal decoding apparatus and a moving picture coded signal decoding apparatus.
      <br/>
      More particularly, the present invention relates to a code string editing apparatus, a picture coded signal decoding apparatus and a moving picture coded signal decoding apparatus which are suitable for decoding a plurality of picture/moving picture coded signals into a single picture/moving picture.
    </p>
    <p num="3">A conventional picture coded signal decoding apparatus 1000 will be explained below by referring to FIG. 12. This picture coded signal decoding apparatus 1000 receives four picture coded signals and decodes these signals into one picture signal.</p>
    <p num="4">
      An example of the utilization of the picture coded signal decoding apparatus 1000 will be described below.
      <br/>
      Referring to FIG. 12, four picture signals Pa, Pb, Pc and Pd are generated for pictures taken by four cameras 1a, 1b, 1c and 1d respectively.
      <br/>
      The generated four picture signals Pa, Pb, Pc and Pd are coded into picture coded signals Ca, Cb, Cc and Cd by picture coding apparatuses 2a, 2b, 2c and 2d respectively.
      <br/>
      The coded picture coded signals Ca, Cb, Cc and Cd are transferred to the picture coded signal decoding apparatus 1000 through transmission paths 3a, 3b, 3c and 3d respectively.
      <br/>
      In the picture coded signal decoding apparatus 1000, the picture coded signals Ca, Cb, Cc and Cd are decoded into a picture signal P, which is then transmitted to a monitor unit 5 through a transmission path 4 and is displayed there as a composite picture.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      The operation of the conventional picture coded signal decoding apparatus 1000 will be explained next.
      <br/>
      The picture coded signal decoding apparatus 1000 is structured to include four picture decoding units 1100a, 1100b, 1100c and 1100d and one picture composing unit 1200.
      <br/>
      In the picture coded signal decoding apparatus 1000, the four picture coded signals Ca, Cb, Cc and Cd are input through the four transmission paths 3a, 3b, 3c and 3d respectively.
      <br/>
      The input picture coded signals Ca, Cb, Cc and Cd are decoded into the picture signals Pa, Pb, Pc and Pd by the picture decoding units 1100a, 1100b, 1100c and 1100d respectively.
      <br/>
      The four picture signals Pa, Pb, Pc and Pd are sent to the picture composing unit 1200 and are then composed into the one picture signal P. The composite picture signal P is sent out to the transmission path 4.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      According to the conventional picture coded signal decoding apparatus described above picture decoding units corresponding to the number of picture coded signals being input are necessary.
      <br/>
      In this example illustrated in FIG. 12, four picture coded signals are applied.
      <br/>
      Thus, four picture decoding units are necessary.
      <br/>
      If more than four picture coded signals are applied then more picture decoding units are necessary.
      <br/>
      Further, for each picture decoding unit used, peripheral circuits for operating the picture decoding units are necessary.
      <br/>
      As a result, it is difficult to make a compact and economical structure for a picture coded signal decoding apparatus.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      Further, in order to correspond to a change in the number of input picture coded signals, it is necessary to change the number of picture decoding units in addition to the necessary change in the structure of the picture composing unit.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, it is difficult to change the number of picture coded signals that are input.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      Also, in many cases, when a picture signal is coded, the picture signal is converted into a code of a smaller capacity highly efficiently.
      <br/>
      Thus, when a picture coded signal is decoded, the capacity of the code becomes larger.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, the picture composing unit needs to process picture information of a large capacity code resulting from the decoding of a small capacity picture coded signal.
      <br/>
      Therefore, a large processing capacity is required for the picture composing unit.
      <br/>
      A large processing capacity in the picture composing unit is particularly required when a fine picture including a large quantity of information is to be processed, or when a moving picture is to be processed based on a series of pictures received continuously.
    </p>

      Each of the series of pictures 10 for structuring the moving picture 100 has at least one sub-picture 12 including a predetermined number of scanning lines.
      <br/>
      The sub-pictures 12 are disposed in parallel along a direction orthogonal with a scanning line 11.
      <br/>
      In other words, one picture 10 has either one sub-picture 12 or has a plurality of sub-pictures 12 disposed in parallel.
      <br/>
      Each sub-picture 12 has at least one picture element 13 laid along the scanning lines as shown in FIG. 1B.

      A moving picture coded signal 200 for describing the moving picture 100 shown in FIG. 1A will be explained with reference to FIGS. 2A-2C. In FIG. 2A the moving picture coded signal 200 has a series of picture coded signals 20 arranged in time series.

      In FIG. 2B each picture coded signal 20 has a picture head 21 at its head.

      Further, each picture coded signal 20 has at least one coded sub-picture (hereinafter to be referred to as a slice) 25, following the picture header.
      <br/>
      Each slice 25 corresponds to a respective sub-picture 12 shown in FIG. 1A.

      <br/>
      Each slice number 23 shows a sequence that the sub-picture 12 (reference FIG. 1A) corresponding to the slice 25 in which this slice number is included is disposed on the picture 10 (reference FIG. 1A).

      Each picture code string 24 describes the picture information of each picture element 11 (reference FIG. 1B) respectively.

      Next, a first mode for carrying out the present invention will be explained with reference to FIGS. 3 and 4.
      <br/>
      The present mode of implementation is an example of a code string editing apparatus for editing four picture coded signals into one picture coded signal.
      <br/>
      The invention is not limited to an implementation where four picture coded signals are edited into one picture coded signal.
      <br/>
      The invention can operate with more than four or less than four picture coded signals.
    </p>
    <p num="25">
      In FIG. 3, a code string editing apparatus 2000 is structured to have buffer memories 2011(1) to 2011(4) for storing four picture coded signals C1, C2, C3 and C4 respectively being input, header detecting circuits 2013(1) to 2013(4) for detecting picture headers and slice headers, switches 2012(1) to 2012(4) for selecting buffer memories for reading out picture coded signals, an adding circuit 2015 for adding a predetermined number to a slice number, a switch 2016 for replacing or deleting a slice number, a sequencer 2014 for controlling the switches 2012(1) to 2012(4) and 2016, and a buffer memory 2006 for smoothing the output of an edited picture coded signal.
      <br/>
      The respective buffer memories 2011(i) (in this case, i represents each of 1, 2, 3 and 4), the respective header detecting circuits 2013(i) and the respective switches 2012(i) are formed as four respective series of input sections 2010(i).
    </p>
    <p num="26">
      The buffer memories 2011(1) to 2011(4) are for absorbing a time difference between a timing when the picture coded signals C1, C2, C3 and C4 are input and a timing when the picture coded signals C1, C2, C3 and C4 are read out.
      <br/>
      Each header detecting circuit 2013(i) reads out a picture coded signal Ci from the buffer memory 2011(i) of the corresponding series when the switch 2012(i) of the corresponding series is in the closed state, and sends this signal to the switch 2012 (i) and, at the same time, detects the picture header and the slice header included in this picture coded signal Ci and sends a detection signal Di to the sequencer 2014 after the detection.
      <br/>
      Each switch 2012(i) selectively achieves the closed state and the open state according to an instruction Oi given from the sequencer 2014.
    </p>
    <p num="27">
      The adding circuit 2015 stores in advance a numerical value to be added, and replaces a slice number included in the picture coded signal with a slice number which is the former slice number added with the numerical value.
      <br/>
      The adding circuit 2015 can be structured by, for example, the following members not shown such as a memory in which the numerical value to be added is stored in advance, a slice number detecting section for detecting a code string for showing a slice number from the picture coded signal, a slice number reading section for reading the slice number shown by the detected code string, an adder for adding the numerical value stored in the memory to the read slice number, a code string generating section for generating a code string for showing the added slice number, and an editing section for replacing the code string showing the slice number included in the picture coded signal with the generated code string.
    </p>
    <p num="28">In order to provide the memory with a numerical value to be added in advance, the numerical value may be fixedly stored in the memory in advance, or the memory may be structured so as to be rewritable and an input section for inputting a numerical value to the memory is provided so that a numerical value to be added is given according to the number of slices included in the picture coded signal.</p>
    <p num="29">
      The switch 2016 can selectively achieve the following three states: a through-state T in which a direct contact is possible from the switches 2012(1) to 2012(4), an add state A in which a direct connection is made to the adding circuit 2015 and a delete state N in which the input side is set to the open state.
      <br/>
      Any one of these three states is selected based on an instruction O0 from the sequencer 2014.
    </p>
    <p num="30">
      The sequencer 2014 is given in advance a sequence processing procedure, and carries out a sequential control of the switches 2012(1) to 2012(4) and the switch 2016 by proceeding with the sequence based on a detection signal which indicates that the picture header has been detected and a detection signal which indicates that the slice header has been detected.
      <br/>
      The detection signals are received from each header detecting circuit 2013 respectively.
      <br/>
      Details of the sequence processing will be explained later.
    </p>
    <p num="31">
      The outline of the operation of the code string editing apparatus 2000 will be explained next.
      <br/>
      When the four picture coded signals C1, C2, C3 and C4 are input, they are stored in the buffer memories 2011(1) to 2011(4) respectively.
      <br/>
      When the sequencer 2014 has sent an instruction Oi, to one of the switches 2012(i') to set it to the closed state, a picture coded signal Ci' is read out from a buffer memory 2011(i') which belongs to an input section 2010(i') of the same series as that of the switch 2012(i'), and the read-out picture coded signal Ci' is sent to 2013 (i') and is also sent to the adding circuit 2015 and the switch 2016 through a header detecting circuit 2013(i').
    </p>
    <p num="32">
      In the adding circuit 2015, the slice number of the picture coded signal Ci' included therein is replaced by the slice number which is added by a predetermined number.
      <br/>
      Based on the instruction O0 of the sequencer 2014, the switch 2016 selects any one of the picture coded signal added with the slice number by the adding circuit 2015 and the picture coded signal sent directly without passing through the adding circuit 2015, and further, if indicated by the instruction O0, deletes the slice number from the selected picture coded signal.
      <br/>
      The switch 2016 then sends the selected picture coded signal or the picture coded signal of which slice number has been deleted to the buffer memory 2006.
      <br/>
      The picture coded signal sent to the buffer memory 2006 has its time axis smoothed and is output as one picture coded signal C.
    </p>
    <p num="33">
      On the other hand, the header detecting circuit 2013(i') detects a slice header from the picture coded signal Ci', and sends a detection signal Di' to the sequencer after having detected the slice header from the picture coded signal Ci'. When the detection signal Di' has been sent to the sequencer 2014, the sequencer 2014 sends an instruction to the switch 2012(i') to set this switch to the closed state, and further sends an instruction to the next switch 2012(i") in a predetermined sequence to set this switch to the closed state.
      <br/>
      Thereafter, the picture coded signals C1, C2, C3 and C4 are read out for each slice in the same manner.
      <br/>
      By reading the picture coded signals from each slice for one picture component, the picture coded signals C1, C2, C3 and C4 can be edited into one picture coded signal.
      <br/>
      Further, by repeating the above-described operation, a moving picture coded signal to which the picture coded signals C1, C2, C3 and C4 are applied sequentially can be edited into one moving picture coded signal.
    </p>
    <p num="34">
      Next, description will be made of the operation of the code string editing apparatus 2000 in the case where picture coded signals C1, C2, C3 and C4 for showing four pictures (1) to (4) each having a predetermined number of sub-pictures, for example, fifteen (15), with reference to FIG. 4.
      <br/>
      In this case, if the number of sub-pictures is not given in advance, it is possible to decide whether the picture coded signals of the picture have been read out or not by detecting the picture header, as described above.
    </p>
    <p num="35">
      Referring to FIG. 4, at first, a picture header is read out from each of the respective buffer memories 2011(1) to 2011(4) (step S1).
      <br/>
      In other words, the picture coded signal C1 is read out from the buffer memory 2011(1) and the picture header is detected.
      <br/>
      Then, the detected picture header is transferred to the buffer memory 2006.
      <br/>
      Then, the picture coded signals C2, C3 and C4 are read out from the buffer memories 2011(2) to 2011(3), the picture headers are read out, and these picture headers are deleted directly without being transferred.
    </p>
    <p num="36">
      The reading of the picture coded signal C1 from the buffer memory 2011(1) is started (step S2).
      <br/>
      In this case, the picture coded signal is transferred to the buffer memory 2006 in the state of including the slice header.
      <br/>
      Then, the reading from the buffer memory 2011(1) is continued further (step S3).
      <br/>
      In this case, it is decided whether the slice header is detected from the read-out picture coded signal or not (step S4).
      <br/>
      When the slice header is not detected, the read-out picture coded signal is transferred to the buffer memory 2006 (step S5).
      <br/>
      If the slice header has been detected, the reading from the buffer memory 2011(1) is stopped.
      <br/>
      The picture coded signal for one slice is read out from the buffer memory 2011(1) in the manner as described at the steps S3 to S5.
    </p>
    <p num="37">
      Next, the reading of the coded picture signal C2 from the buffer memory 2011(2) is started (step S6).
      <br/>
      In this case, the picture coded signal is transferred to the buffer memory 2006 in the state of including the slice header, in the same manner as described at the step S2.
      <br/>
      At steps S6 to S9, the picture coded signal for one slice is read out from the buffer memory 2011(2) in the same manner as described at the steps S3 to S5.
    </p>
    <p num="38">
      When it has been decided that the slice header was detected, a decision is made as to whether the reading of the picture (2) has been finished or not (step S10).
      <br/>
      This decision can be done by deciding whether the reading of slices from the buffer memory 2011(2) has been carried out fifteen (15) times or not.
      <br/>
      In this case, if the number of sub-pictures has not been given in advance, it is possible to decide whether the reading of the picture coded signal C2 of the picture (2) has been finished or not by detecting the picture header in the manner as described above.
      <br/>
      If the reading of the picture (2) has not been finished as a result of the decision at the step S10, the process goes back to the reading of the buffer memory 2011(1).
      <br/>
      In the manner as described above, it is possible to read out the picture coded signals one slice by one slice alternately from the buffer memories 2011(3) and 2011(4).
    </p>
    <p num="39">
      In the manner as described above, it is possible to transfer to the buffer memory 2006 a picture coded signal showing a picture having a picture shown by the picture coded signal C2 read out from the buffer memory 2011(2) disposed at a right-hand side position of a picture shown by the picture coded signal C1 read out from the buffer memory 2011(1).
      <br/>
      At the step S10, when the reading of the picture (2) has been finished, the reading from the buffer memory 2011(3) is started.
    </p>
    <p num="40">
      At steps S11 to S19, the picture coded signals are read out by each one slice alternately from the buffer memories 2011(3) and 2011(4) in the same manner as described at the steps S2 to S10.
      <br/>
      However, the process at the steps S11 to S19 is different from that at the preceding steps in that the slice number is transferred in the state that the slice number included in each slice is replaced by the slice number to which the number 15 which is the number of sub-pictures included in the picture is added.
      <br/>
      With this arrangement, it is possible to make the coded picture signals read out from the buffer memories 2011(3) and 2011(4) correspond to a lower-side position of the picture of the picture coded signal read out from the buffer memory 2006.
      <br/>
      In this case, if the number of sub-pictures to be added is not given in advance, the number of reading slices until the picture head has been detected is counted and this number can be used as the number of the sub-pictures.

    <p num="41">
      In the manner as described above, it is possible to generate a picture coded signal for showing one picture which includes four pictures shown by the four picture coded signals C1, C2, C3 and C4 stored in the buffer memories 2011(1) to 2011(4).
      <br/>
      Further, by repeating the above process, it is possible to generate a moving picture coded signal for showing one moving picture including four moving pictures shown by four moving picture coded signals.

      According to the moving picture coded signal decoding apparatus of the fourth mode of implementation, a frame which reaches as a single, that is, the picture coded signal C13 is deleted, and the frames that reach at the time t2, that is, the picture coded signals C14 and C23 to C43 are decoded.
      <br/>
      By dropping the frame of the moving picture having such a fast frame speed, it becomes always possible to generate a moving picture signal for sequentially displaying pictures having four moving pictures composed with decoded moving picture signals.
    </p>
    <p num="58">Further, when the frame speed of a plurality of moving pictures is fast, it is possible to drop frames based on the timing of the reaching of a picture coded signal for the moving picture coded signal of which frame speed is the lowest.</p>
    <p num="59">Although description has been made of the case where the input number of moving picture coded signals is four in the above explanation, the number is not limited to four as is the case with the above-described first to third modes of implementation.</p>
    <p num="60">
      As a more detailed application example of the picture signal decoding apparatus of the fourth mode of implementation, this can be applied to the moving picture coded signal as standardized in MPEG-2 (Moving Picture Experts Group-2).
      <br/>
      More specifically, for example, when four picture coded signals for showing four low-resolution screens respectively are input according to the MPEG-2 standard, these signals can be composed into a composite picture signal for showing one medium-resolution screen determined by the MPEG-2.
      <br/>
      In this case, a picture of low resolution is structured to have 15 sub-pictures each including 16 scanning lines vertically and 176 pixels laterally, so that there are 240 scanning lines vertically and 176 pixels laterally in total as the picture.
      <br/>
      A picture of medium resolution have 480 scanning lines vertically and 704 pixels laterally.
    </p>
    <p num="61">
      Further, at the time of generating a moving picture signal, picture elements artificially generated can be inserted into the peripheral section of each picture structuring a moving picture.
      <br/>
      In other words, by providing a picture element generating unit for generating the picture elements to be inserted, the picture generated by this is given to the code string editing apparatus, so that the picture elements can be inserted into the moving picture to be generated.
    </p>
    <p num="62">
      In general, a monitoring unit such as a CRT to be used for displaying a moving picture has, in many cases, a bent border for the range where a display is actually made.
      <br/>
      To be more specific, as shown in FIG. 9A, for a range of A0 in which a moving picture is to be accepted by a monitoring unit, in practice, a moving picture is displayed in only a range AM by being limited by a mask or the like, so that a part of the screen is dropped.
      <br/>
      In this case, when a range A for a generated moving picture is smaller than the range A0, it becomes possible to disperse the dropped portion to the peripheral section of the screen by inserting picture elements into the starting point side of the scanning line of the monitoring unit.
    </p>
    <p num="63">In other words, as shown in FIG. 9B, by inserting the picture elements into the section of E1 and this section is given as a range A' in the monitor, the dropped section of the range A for the generated moving picture can be dispersed to the four corners of the screen, and this section can be made smaller.</p>
    <p num="64">
      Further, at the time of generating a composite moving picture signal, the composite moving picture can be generated in the state that the picture code string corresponding to the picture elements at a predetermined section of the periphery of each given moving picture is deleted.
      <br/>
      For example, as shown in FIG. 10A, a moving picture having four moving pictures composed, each having a range of A1, A2, A3 and A4 respectively, becomes a range A. Thus, this range A exceeds an actual display range AM of the monitoring unit.
      <br/>
      In such a case, the picture coded strings corresponding to the picture elements at sections of ranges D1, D2, D3 and D4 in the ranges A1, A2, A3 and A4 of the moving pictures are deleted, and these pictures are composed to be located within ranges of A1', A2', A3', and A4' as shown in FIG. 10B. In this way, those dropped sections which can not be displayed can be inserted into the peripheral sections of the ranges A1, A2, A3 and A4 of the pictures.
    </p>
    <p num="65">
      This is also effective in the case of displaying a composite picture by matching the center of the range AM actually displayed to the center of the range A of the composed moving picture.
      <br/>
      In other words, by making a display in the manner as shown in FIG. 11B, dropped sections which are not displayed can be dispersed to the peripheral sections of the areas A1, A2, A3 and A4 of the moving pictures to be composed.
      <br/>
      As described above, when important information is displayed at the center of the pictures to be composed, an insertion or a deletion of picture elements to match the picture display range enables to avoid a loss of the information.
