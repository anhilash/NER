      A rack assembly for mounting telecommunications equipment and adapted for withstanding seismic forces includes a main frame subassembly including an upper horizontal support member, a lower horizontal support member, a first vertical support member, and a second vertical support member spaced in parallel relation to the first vertical support member.
      <br/>
      The first and second vertical support members each have a double-bend profile, defined by an inside base portion, a first medial leg and a second medial leg each extending substantially orthogonally from the inside base portion, a first distal leg extending substantially orthogonally from the first medial leg in a direction towards the second medial leg, and a second distal leg extending substantially orthogonally from the second medial leg in a direction towards the first medial leg.
      <br/>
      An extension frame subassembly is securely attached to the upper horizontal support member of the main frame subassembly.
      <br/>
      The extension frame subassembly includes vertical frame members having the same double-bend profile as the first and second vertical support members of the main frame subassembly.

    <heading>TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
    <p num="1">The present invention relates to racks or bays used primarily for mounting and housing telecommunications equipment, and more specifically to racks and extension assemblies designed to protect equipment mounted in such racks from forces encountered during a seismic event.</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND ART</heading>
    <p num="2">
      Telecommunications equipment racks or bays are typically installed in controlled environment vaults, central switching offices, and remote switch buildings.
      <br/>
      Many conventional racks presently found in such facilities are large and cumbersome, because there has previously been a need to accommodate bulky and heavy equipment such as copper wiring and electromechanical switching components.
      <br/>
      The overall height of a conventional rack is typically 11.5 feet, which corresponds the ceiling height of rooms in which such racks are installed.
      <br/>
      To provide strength and stability, telecommunications racks are typically bolted to the floor and tied off the ceiling superstructure, and cables and wires are run from the superstructure directly through the tops of the racks.
    </p>
    <p num="3">
      Because of recent advances in the telecommunications industry, including the development and use of fiber optic transmission cable and small-scale, fully electronic components, the design of racks has been scaled down.
      <br/>
      As a result, the overall height required for racks has been reduced to 9 feet and most recently has been reduced to 7 feet.
      <br/>
      However, the ceiling heights of pre-existing facilities have not changed.
      <br/>
      New 7 foot racks may be installed next to old 9 foot or 11.5 foot racks.
      <br/>
      As a result, gaps are created between the tops of the 7 foot racks and the ceiling of the facility.
      <br/>
      This is undesirable in that wires or cables running down from the ceiling superstructure to the 7 foot racks are exposed and not protected by the racks, and the racks cannot be tied off to the ceiling superstructure with the use of conventional means.
      <br/>
      It is particularly undesirable in localities where the racks must adhere to rigid industry standards regarding the ability of telecommunications racks to withstand seismic forces.
      <br/>
      For example, racks of this type must be designed to meet the BELLCORE Zone 4 seismic test set forth in Document - GR-63-CORE.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      Accordingly, there is a need for a telecommunications rack which can be adapted for installation in facilities with either 7, 9 or 11.5 foot ceilings.
      <br/>
      One way to accomplish this is to provide extension assemblies that are mountable to the top of a 7 foot rack.
      <br/>
      However, the rack with the extension assembly installed thereto must still meet industry seismic standards.
      <br/>
      In addition, the industry has recommended that users of such racks refrain from installing telecommunications equipment in the extended portions of the racks.
      <br/>
      This is because the extended portions themselves are not designed to safely protect telecommunications equipment from seismic forces.
      <br/>
      Unfortunately, in order to conserve space many users often ignore this recommendation and proceed to install sensitive equipment in the extended portions, thereby increasing the risk of severe damage to costly equipment.
      <br/>
      Therefore, there is a further need to provide an extension assembly that permits the rack to comply or remain in compliance with seismic standards while preventing the installation of equipment into the extension assembly itself.
      <br/>
      Applicant has designed a rack assembly which meets all of these requirements and which is described in detail hereinbelow.

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="20">
      Referring now to the drawings, in FIG. 1 a main frame subassembly is provided and generally designated 10.
      <br/>
      Main frame subassembly 10 includes a lower horizontal support member or base subassembly 12, the details of which are described below, an upper horizontal support member 14, and two vertical support members 16.
      <br/>
      Vertical support members 16 are secured to upper horizontal support member 14 and base subassembly 12 by conventional means such as nuts and bolts extending through appropriately located holes.
      <br/>
      In one embodiment, the overall height of main frame subassembly 10 is 7 feet and the overall width is 257/8 inches.
      <br/>
      Holes 18 in upper horizontal support member 14 may be used for running cables or wires therethrough or, in an application in which an extension frame is not needed, for access through which conventional means are employed for tying off main frame subassembly 10 to a 7 foot ceiling.
    </p>
    <p num="21">
      Vertical support members 16 each have a double-bend profile.
      <br/>
      That is, each vertical support member 16 includes an inside base portion 22 facing the interior of main frame subassembly 10, medial legs 24,26 extending outwardly from inside base portion 22, and distal legs 28 extending transversely towards each other from medial legs 24, 26.
      <br/>
      Preferably, inside base portion 22 is 5.06 inches deep, and one medial leg 24 of each vertical support member 16 is greater in length than the other medial leg 26.
      <br/>
      Vertical support members 16 additionally include holes 32 and 34 of various sizes and locations to which equipment may be mounted directly or to which shelving or individual racks may be mounted.
      <br/>
      The width between inside base portions 22 of vertical support members 16 is 211/2 inches.
    </p>
    <p num="22">
      In order to extend the height of main frame subassembly 10 as needed by the end user, an extension frame subassembly is provided and generally designated 40 in FIGS. 2 and 3.
      <br/>
      Extension frame subassembly 40 includes upper and lower horizontal frame members 42 and 44 and vertical frame members 46, all of which are secured to each other by conventional means.
      <br/>
      Upper horizontal frame member 42 may include a series of holes 48, similar to holes 18 of upper horizontal support member 14 of main frame subassembly 10, for running cables or wires therethrough from a ceiling superstructure and/or for tying off extension frame subassembly 40 to the ceiling superstructure.
      <br/>
      Extension frame subassembly 40 is securely mounted to the top of main frame subassembly 10 to form a rack assembly, generally designated 50 in FIG. 4.
      <br/>
      The height of extension frame subassembly 40 can be either 2 or 4.5 feet, depending upon whether an overall height of 9.0 or 11.5 feet for rack assembly 50 is required at the particular installation site.
    </p>
    <p num="23">
      Certain aspects of the present invention permit rack assembly 50, as constructed from main frame and extension subassemblies 10, 40, respectively to adequately protect equipment installed therein from the deleterious effects of seismic forces.
      <br/>
      Referring again to FIGS. 2 and 3, vertical frame members 46 are sized similarly to vertical support members 16 of main frame subassembly 10, and have the same double-bend profile as vertical support members 16.
      <br/>
      Vertical frame members 46 and vertical support members 16 are constructed of a steel having a minimum yield strength of 50,000 psi and an percent elongation of 26% or greater.
      <br/>
      ASTM -AS-715 steel may be specially ordered to obtain these properties.
      <br/>
      In this case, percent elongation is a measure of the ductility of the material, and is characterized by elongation and reduction in cross-sectional area during testing.
      <br/>
      Hence, percent elongation is defined as (Lf -Lo)/Lo, where Lo is the original gage length of the test specimen and Lf is the distance between the gage marks at fracture.
    </p>
    <p num="24">
      In addition, a spread-out 4-bolt pattern is used to secure extension frame subassembly 40 to main frame subassembly 10.
      <br/>
      Thus, holes 52 are provided (only two holes 52 are shown in FIG. 2) in lower horizontal frame member 44 proximate to the four corners thereof, and in alignment with corresponding holes 54 drilled into upper horizontal support member 14 of main frame subassembly 10 (see FIG. 1).
      <br/>
      Preferable fastening means include 5/8-11 * 11 3/4 inch bolts 56, 5/8-11 inch hex nuts 57, 5/8 inch lock washers 58, and 5/8 inch flat washers 59.
    </p>
    <p num="25">
      In order to provide additional stiffness to extension frame subassembly 40, and to prevent end users from installing equipment within the interior of extension frame subassembly 40 as opposed to within main frame subassembly 10, a filler panel 60 is preferably secured within extension frame subassembly 40.
      <br/>
      In the embodiment shown in FIGS. 2 and 3, filler panel 60 includes a central panel portion 62 and upper and lower tabs 64, 66, respectively.
      <br/>
      Upper and lower tabs 64, 66 are respectively disposed within slotted areas 68, 72 in upper and lower horizontal frame members 42, 44.
      <br/>
      Angled portions 74 extend forwardly from both sides of central panel portion 62, and side tabs 76 extend outwardly from angled portions 74.
      <br/>
      Side tabs 76 are disposed in registered contact with medial legs 24 of vertical frame members 46.
      <br/>
      Filler panel 60 can be secured to extension frame subassembly 40 by means of fasteners extended through holes (not shown) in upper, lower and side tabs 64, 66, 76, respectively, or through slots 78 on filler panel 60.
    </p>
    <p num="26">
      In the embodiment shown in FIGS. 6 and 7, the base subassembly, generally designated 12, includes upper and lower base plates 82, 84, respectively, front and rear braces 86, 88, respectively, and gussets 92.
      <br/>
      Each gusset 92 includes a horizontal portion 94, and inner and outer legs 96, 98 depending downwardly therefrom and disposed in contact with lower base plate 84.
      <br/>
      Lower base plate 84 includes cut-outs 102 to accommodate insertion of vertical support members 16 adjacent to gussets 92.
      <br/>
      In order to increase the stability and strength of rack assembly 10, removable angle inserts 110 having horizontal and vertical portions 112, 114 are provided, as shown in detail in FIGS. 5A-5C. Each angle insert 110 is installed in base subassembly 12 such that horizontal portion 112 contacts lower base plate 84 and vertical portion 114 contacts both inner leg 96 of gusset 92 and inside base portion 22 of vertical support member 16.
      <br/>
      Angle inserts 110 are preferably bolted to base subassembly 12 through holes 116 in angle inserts 110, holes (not shown) in gussets 92 or inside base portions 22, and holes or slots 118 in lower base plate 84.
      <br/>
      Removably fastened angle inserts 110 may be replaced without replacing entire base subassembly 12, and thus are superior to conventional welded inserts.
    </p>
    <p num="27">
      It will thus be seen that there is provided, as described hereinbefore, a telecommunications rack which can assume different heights in order to accommodate the specific needs of the user.
      <br/>
      This is accomplished by providing an extension frame that is structurally designed to permit the rack to maintain compliance with industry requirements for resistance against seismic forces, in a manner not heretofore known.
      <br/>
      The extension frame also includes a panel which adds stiffness and prevents installation of sensitive equipment therein.
    </p>
    <p num="28">
      It will be understood that various details of the invention may be changed without departing from the scope of the invention.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, the foregoing description is for the purpose of illustration only, and not for the purpose of limitation--the invention being defined by the claims.
