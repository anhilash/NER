      Apparatus for grooming and decorating hair includes a hair clip and a grooming device pivotally connected to the hair clip.
      <br/>
      The grooming device can be moved between a position between the jaws of the hair clip and a position exterior of the hair clip and projecting outwardly from the jaws.

    <heading>TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
    <p num="1">
      This invention relates to apparatus for grooming and decorating hair.
      <br/>
      More particularly, the apparatus can be attached to an individual's hair to augment or style the hair or employed to groom the individual's hair when removed therefrom.
    </p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">Decorative clips for hair are well known and the clips come in a wide variety of shapes and sizes.</p>
    <p num="3">
      U.S. Pat. No. 5,501,239, issued Mar. 26, 1996, illustrates a clip comprising a pair of jaws having a mutual pivotal connection.
      <br/>
      The jaws of the clip are provided with a spring which urges the jaws into engagement.
      <br/>
      A hair piece is connected to the clip.
    </p>
    <p num="4">The following patents also disclose hair pieces and approaches for attaching them to an individual's hair: U.S. Pat. No. 3,280,826, issued Oct. 25, 1996, U.S. Pat. No. 4,830,029, issued May 16, 1989, U.S. Pat. No. 5,813,418, issued Sep. 29, 1998, U.S. Pat. No. 2,165,716, issued Jul. 11, 1939, and U.S. Pat. No. 2,651,310, issued Sep. 8, 1953.</p>
    <p num="5">
      All of the above-identified patents have in common the fact that they disclose devices for enhancing the appearance of or decorate the hair of the wearer.
      <br/>
      The devices are not suitable for performing the function of grooming an individual's hair.
    </p>
    <heading>DISCLOSURE OF INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="6">The present invention relates to apparatus of relatively simple, inexpensive construction which is readily adaptable to either groom an individual's hair or decorate the hair.</p>
    <p num="7">
      The apparatus includes a hair clip for selective attachment to an individual's hair.
      <br/>
      A grooming device is connected to the hair clip, the grooming device for grooming the hair of an individual when the hair clip is not attached to the individual's hair.

    <heading>MODES FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="11">
      Referring now to FIGS. 1-9, a preferred form of apparatus constructed in accordance with the teachings of the present invention is illustrated.
      <br/>
      The apparatus includes a hair clip 10 and a grooming device in the form of an elongated brush 12
    </p>
    <p num="12">Hair clip 10 includes jaws 14 and 16, each having a plurality of gripper teeth 18.</p>
    <p num="13">
      The jaws curve as shown and the jaws are movable between a closed condition (shown in FIGS. 1 and 3, for example) and an open position (shown in FIGS. 2 and 9, for example).
      <br/>
      The jaws define a clip interior 20 (FIG. 4).
    </p>
    <p num="14">
      When the jaws are open the distal clamping ends of the jaws (the distal ends of gripper teeth 18) form a space sufficiently large to enable passage of brush 12 therethrough.
      <br/>
      This is illustrated quite clearly in FIG. 2, for example.
      <br/>
      When, however, the jaws are closed, movement of the brush between the positions of FIG. 1 and FIG. 3 is prevented.
    </p>
    <p num="15">
      Located between jaws 14, 16 is a housing 26 defining a housing opening 28.
      <br/>
      The jaws 14, 16 are pivotally connected to opposed sides of housing 26 by a pivot connection 30.
      <br/>
      Springs 32 disposed at the pivot connections bias the jaws 14, 16 closed.
      <br/>
      Projections 40 on the jaws are manually pressed together by the user of the apparatus to overcome the bias of springs 32 and temporarily move the jaws to open position.
    </p>
    <p num="16">
      The brush 12 is pivotally connected at one end thereof to housing 26 of the hair clip by a pivot pin 50.
      <br/>
      When the brush 12 is in the position shown in FIGS. 1 and 4, for example, the bristles of the brush extend through housing opening 28 and into the interior of the housing.
      <br/>
      Thus the bristles are protected and concealed when an individual wishes to utilize the apparatus as a hair decoration.
    </p>
    <p num="17">
      When it is desired to use the brush, the jaws are opened and the brush swung downwardly and away from the jaws about pivot pin 50 until the brush reaches the position shown in FIG. 3.
      <br/>
      A protrusion 54 on the brush engages the housing 26 when the brush is in the position shown in FIG. 3 to prevent further movement of the brush.
      <br/>
      After the brush has been used to groom the hair it can readily be returned to its initial position of FIG. 1 by again opening the jaws and swinging the brush in a clockwise direction (as viewed in FIG. 2).
      <br/>
      The grooming device pivotally moves in a direction orthogonal to the direction of movement of the pivotally interconnected jaws.
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      FIGS. 10-12 illustrate an alternative embodiment of the invention which includes hair clip 10.
      <br/>
      In this embodiment a hair piece 60, formed of either natural or artificial hair is attached in any suitable manner to the hair clip and hides the top of the hair clip including the housing thereof.
      <br/>
      Also in this embodiment, the grooming device is in the form of a comb 62 having teeth 64.
      <br/>
      FIG. 10 illustrates the apparatus with the comb hidden between the jaws 14, 16 of the hair clip.
      <br/>
      In FIGS. 11 and 12 the comb is shown fully extended for hair grooming use.
    </p>
    <p num="19">Ribbons or other decorative items can be attached to the hair clip.</p>
