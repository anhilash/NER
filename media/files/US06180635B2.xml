      T-cells play an important role in the immune response, however in autoimmune disease T-cells are activated against particular tissues, e.g. causing the inflammation associated with rheumatoid arthritis.
      <br/>
      Interleukin-2 (IL2) is an essential autocrine growth factor for T-cells and hence inhibition of IL-2 transcription is beneficial in the modulation of autoimmune disease.
      <br/>
      Formation of a transcriptional complex of the protein nuclear factor of activated T-cells-1 (NFAT-1) on the IL-2 promoter is essential for IL2 transcription.
      <br/>
      NFAT-1 mediated transcription has therefore been proposed as appropriate molecular target for immunomodulation, Y. Baine et al., J. Immunol., 1995, 154, 3667-3677.

    <p num="3">W. F. Michne et al., in J. Med. Chem. (1995) 38, 2557-2569 disclose a number of quinazoline-2,4-diones and pyrrolo�3,4-d�pyrimidine-2,4-diones which inhibit transcription regulated by the DNA region bound by the NFAT-1 protein.</p>
    <p num="4">We have now found novel thieno�2,3-d�pyrimidinediones which exhibit pharmacological activity, in particular immunosuppressive activity.</p>
