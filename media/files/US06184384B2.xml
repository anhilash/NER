    <heading>BACKGROUND</heading>
    <p num="2">
      The present invention resides generally in the field of chlorinated pyridines.
      <br/>
      More particularly, the present invention relates in one preferred aspect to processes for preparing 3,5-dichloropyridine by dechlorinating 2,3,5,6-tetrachloropyridine in an acidic medium such as that provided by an alkanoic acid, especially acetic acid.
    </p>
    <p num="3">
      As further background, polychlorinated pyridine derivatives are important intermediates in the preparation of pesticides.
      <br/>
      Consequently, much effort has been made at both the academic and industrial levels to find improved, economically-practicable processes for their preparation.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      3,5-Dichloropyridine is one such intermediate.
      <br/>
      Proposed processes for its production have been widely diverse and have included both the selective chlorination of intermediate compounds, the selective dechlorination of higher-chlorinated pyridines, and other routes.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      For example, JP011211268 (1989) describes the preparation of 3,5-dichloropyridine by dechlorinating chloropyridine compounds under catalytic hydrogenation conditions in the presence of palladium on carbon.
      <br/>
      JP 03200769 (1991) describes a process for oxidizing hydrazinopyridine derivatives to give chloropyridine compounds.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      Despite work toward convenient and effective routes to 3,5-dichloropyridine, there remain needs for improved processes for the practicable, commercial-scale production this compound.
      <br/>
      The present invention is addressed to these needs.
    </p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="7">A feature of the present invention is the discovery that 3,5-dichloropyridine can be selectively prepared by the dechlorination of higher-chlorinated pyridines in an acidic medium in the presence of zinc.</p>
    <p num="8">
      Accordingly, in one preferred embodiment, the invention provides a process for preparing 3,5-dichloropyridine which comprises dechlorinating a tri-, tetra- or pentachloropyridine compound having chlorines at the 3- and 5-positions, in an acidic medium including zinc, so as to selectively form 3,5-dichloropyridine.
      <br/>
      In a more preferred form, the invention provides for the preparation of 3,5-dichloropyridine by dechlorinating 2,3,5,6-tetrachloropyridine to selectively form 3,5-dichloropyridine in a medium including an alkanoic acid and zinc.

      The preferred processes are highly selective for the 3,5-dichloro- products, and can be conducted so as to achieve high conversion of the higher-chlorinated pyridine starting material.
      <br/>
      Additional preferred embodiments of the invention as well as their features and advantages will be apparent from the description that follows.
    </p>
    <heading>DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
    <p num="15">
      For the purposes of promoting an understanding of the principles of the invention, reference will now be made to certain of its embodiments and specific language will be used to describe the same.
      <br/>
      It will nevertheless be understood that no limitation of the scope of the invention is thereby intended, such alterations and modifications and applications of the principles of the invention as described herein being contemplated as would normally occur to one skilled in the art to which the invention pertains.
    </p>
    <p num="16">
      As disclosed above, the present invention features processes for preparing a 3,5-dichloropyridine compound by the dechlorination of a higher-chlorinated pyridine compound in an acidic medium in the presence of zinc.
      <br/>
      In particular aspects of the invention, provided are processes for selectively preparing 3,5-dichloropyridine by dechlorinating 2,3,5,6-tetrachloropyridine in a medium containing an alkanoic acid, especially acetic acid, and zinc.
    </p>
    <p num="17">In a general sense, the starting materials for processes of the invention will be encompassed by the formula:  (Chemical Structure image '2' not included in text)</p>
    <p num="18">
      wherein R1, R2, and R3, are H, chloro, or a non-interfering substituent such as a C1 to C20 hydrocarbon, e.g. alkyl, with the proviso that at least one of R1, R2, and R3 is chloro.
      <br/>
      Illustrative starting materials thus include, for example, 2,3,4,5,6-pentachloropyridine, tetrachloropyridine compounds such as 2,3,5,6-tetrachloropyridine, optionally substituted at the 4-position with a non-interfering substituent as disclosed above, especially lower (C1 to C6) alkyl, and 2,3,4,5-tetrachloropyridine, optionally substituted at the 6-position with a non-interfering substituent as disclosed above, especially lower alkyl.
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      An especially preferred feature of the invention involves the discovery that 2,3,5,6-tetrachloropyridine can be selectively converted to 3,5-dichloropyridine in good yield by dechlorination in the presence of zinc in an acidic medium.
      <br/>
      The preferred starting material, 2,3,5,6-tetrachloropyridine  (Chemical Structure image '3' not included in text)
    </p>
    <p num="20">
      can be obtained commercially or can be prepared using procedures well known to the art and literature.
      <br/>
      For example, suitable processes by which 2,3,5,6-tetrachloropyridine can be made are disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,591,857 issued Jan. 7, 1997 and the background literature discussed therein.
      <br/>
      As will be appreciated, this and other polychlorinated pyridine starting materials may be obtained from these or other known sources or chemical routes without departing from the present invention.
    </p>
    <p num="21">
      The selected chlorinated pyridine starting material is dechlorinated in the presence of zinc as an electron donor to form a 3,5-dichloropyridine compound.
      <br/>
      It is preferred that the zinc be used in particulate form to provide increased surface area for the reaction.
      <br/>
      Zinc chips or zinc dust may be used.
      <br/>
      As to amounts, it is preferred that at least 0.5 gram atoms of zinc be used per gram atom of chlorine to be removed.
      <br/>
      Typically, about 0.5 gram atoms to 3 gram atoms of zinc will be used per gram atom of chlorine to be removed, more preferably about 1 to 3 gram atoms of zinc per gram atom of chlorine.
      <br/>
      Thus, as an example, in the case of the dechlorination of 2,3,5,6-tetrachloropyridine to 3,5-trichloropyridine, it will be preferred to use about 1 to about 6 gram atoms of zinc per mole of 2,3,5,6-tetrachloropyridine.
      <br/>
      Most preferably in this case, about 2 to about 4 gram atoms of zinc are used per mole of 2,3,5,6-tetrachloropyridine.
    </p>
    <p num="22">
      As disclosed above, the inventive processes can optionally be conducted in the presence of a catalyst, such as a compound having both hydrophobic and hydrophilic character and traditionally used as a phase transfer catalyst.
      <br/>
      Preferred such compounds will demonstrate the capacity to increase the rate of reaction to form the desired dechlorinated pyridine derivative and assist in reducing the undesired agglomeration of the zinc particles.
      <br/>
      Preferred catalyst compounds include organic quaternary ammonium compounds.
      <br/>
      For example, the phase transfer catalyst can be provided by a cation encompassed by the formula:  (Chemical Structure image '4' not included in text)
    </p>
    <p num="23">
      wherein:
      <br/>
      R4, R5, and R6, which may be the same as one another or may differ, are H; C1 to C6 alkyl, and wherein two of R4, R5 and R6 may together as alkyl groups form a ring; C1 to C6 alkenyl; alkyl-phenyl, wherein the alkyl is C1 to C6 and the phenyl is optionally substituted with C1 to C6 alkyl, C1 to C6 alkenyl, halogen, hydroxyl, or C1 to C6 alkoxy; or phenyl, optionally substituted with C1 to C6 alkyl, C1 to C6 alkenyl, halogen, hydroxyl, or C1 to C6 alkoxy; and
      <br/>
      R7 is C1 to C6 alkyl; C1 to C6 alkenyl; alkyl-phenyl, wherein the alkyl is C1 to C6 and the phenyl is optionally substituted with C1 to C6 alkyl, C1 to C6 alkenyl, halogen, hydroxyl, or C1 to C6 alkoxy; or phenyl, optionally substituted with C1 to C6 alkyl, C1 to C6 alkenyl, halogen, hydroxyl, or C1 to C6 alkoxy.
    </p>
    <p num="24">Within this formula, it is preferred that R4, R5, R6, and R7 all be organic (i.e. not H), and particularly preferred that they be alkyl, and most preferably C1 to C4 alkyl.</p>
    <p num="25">These preferred phase transfer catalyst compounds can be provided to the reaction mixture by a suitable salt, for example of the formula:  (Chemical Structure image '5' not included in text)</p>
    <p num="26">wherein R4, R5, R6, and R7 are as defined above, X is an anion having from 1 to 3 negative charges, and n is 1 to 3 and corresponds to the number of negative charges of X. Preferred anions, X, include halogens and hydroxy groups.</p>
    <p num="27">
      Other catalyst compounds may also be used, alone or in combination.
      <br/>
      For example, suitable catalysts include quaternary-forms of cyclic amines, e.g. N,N-dimethylpyrrolidinium salts, quaternary forms of diamines, e.g. diamine methyl quats such as ethylene diamine methyl quat, and the like.
      <br/>
      Still further compounds useful as catalysts in the invention include alcohols (including lower alkanols and longer-chain aliphatic alcohols), ethers (e.g. crown ethers), polyethers such as polyethylene glycol (PEG) of differing molecular weights, and other like compounds.
    </p>
    <p num="28">
      As to amounts, it is preferred that the catalyst compounds be charged generally in catalytic amount.
      <br/>
      As used in the art and herein, the term catalytic amount contemplates amounts which are less than stoichiometric relative to the relevant reactant (chlorinated pyridine compound).
      <br/>
      In the present invention, the catalyst, when included, will usually be used in the range of about 0.01 mole percent to 30 mole percent relative to the 2,3,5,6-tetrachloropyridine or other chlorinated pyridine starting material.
      <br/>
      Most preferably, the catalyst is charged in an amount of about 0.05 mole percent to about 10 mole percent relative to the polychlorinated pyridine starting material.
    </p>
    <p num="29">
      As disclosed above, processes of the invention are conducted in reaction medium containing an acid, and typically having a pH less than 8, more typically less than about 7.
      <br/>
      The acidic medium is desirably provided by the inclusion of an organic acid such as a carboxylic acid.
      <br/>
      Alkanoic acids are preferred, including for example C1 to C5 alkanoic acids such as formic, acetic, propanoic, butanoic and pentanoic acids.
      <br/>
      Among these, acetic acid is preferred.
      <br/>
      Inorganic acids can also be used, for example HCl can be used in the presence of NH4 Cl.
    </p>
    <p num="30">
      Liquid organic acids can be used essentially neat as the reaction solvent, e.g. in the case of glacial acetic acid.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, the solvent system can include water and/or one or more organic solvents including, as examples, inert aliphatic solvents such as hexane, heptane, haloalkanes such as perchloroethylene or methylene chloride, and the like, and inert aromatic solvents such as benzene or alkyl benzene solvents including toluene, xylene, ethyl benzene, 2-chlorotoluene, as well as other benzene derivatives such as alkoxy benzenes, e.g. anisole.
      <br/>
      Preferred among these are aromatic solvents, more preferably toluene, mixed xylenes, or ortho-xylene.
    </p>
    <p num="31">
      Discussing now the procedures involved in the conduct of preferred inventive reactions, the reactants and solvent(s) can be charged all together prior to reacting, or one or more of the materials such as the zinc, catalyst, or acid can be all or partially dosed to the reaction mixture over the course of the reaction.
      <br/>
      For example, in one mode, processes of the invention are carried out while adding a portion of the zinc at the start of the procedure, and then periodically dosing the remainder of the zinc to the reaction mixture over the course of the reaction.
      <br/>
      This and similar variations will be apparent to the skilled artisan upon reviewing the disclosures herein.
    </p>
    <p num="32">
      As to temperature, preferred reactions of the invention are conducted at temperatures in the range of about 10 (degree)  C. to about 150 (degree)  C., including under reflux conditions.
      <br/>
      More preferably, these temperatures are in the range of about 20 (degree)  C. to about 80 (degree)  C. The reactions may be allowed to proceed adiabatically, and when so conducted the reaction exotherm will cause a rise in temperature over the course of the reaction.
      <br/>
      The reactions may also be conducted under isothermal conditions, with appropriate measures taken to remove heat generated by the exotherm.
      <br/>
      Relatedly, the reaction pressure utilized can generally be subatmospheric, atmospheric, or superatmospheric.
      <br/>
      As to duration, preferred inventive reactions will typically be complete in about 0.5 to about 24 hours, more preferably in the range of 1 to about 10 hours.
    </p>
    <p num="33">
      Reactions in accordance with the invention are preferably conducted with agitation of the reactor contents, for example by stirring.
      <br/>
      This assists in increasing the reaction rate and in preventing the undesired agglomeration of zinc particles.
    </p>
    <p num="34">
      As to results, preferred processes of the invention provide high yields and selectivity for 3,5-dichloropyridine, generally in excess of 60% isolated yields.
      <br/>
      In addition, chemical yields can readily be obtained in excess of 70% (based on GC analysis).
      <br/>
      Also advantageously, preferred processes of the invention provide high selectivity to 3,5-dichloropyridine.
      <br/>
      For example, 3,5-dichloropyridine can be produced in a selectivity above about 80% in more preferred processes.
    </p>
    <p num="35">
      Reacted mixtures of the invention can be worked up using general procedures known to the art.
      <br/>
      It is noted that upon completion of the reaction, there sometimes can occur a layer of agglomerated solids which can be filtered during workup.
      <br/>
      Layer separations, when needed, can be conducted in a conventional manner, with the 3,5-dichloropyridine product generally occurring in the organic layer.
      <br/>
      Such organic layers can be conventionally processed to obtain the chlorinated pyridine product in a purified form, for example by fractional distillation to achieve a purity of about 95% or greater.
    </p>
    <p num="36">The purified 3,5-dichloropyridine compounds produced in accordance with in the invention can be used in a conventional manner, and are known intermediates to pesticides and other useful compounds.</p>
    <p num="37">
      In order to provide a further understanding of the invention and its advantages, the following specific working Examples 1-8 are provided, and are summarized in Table 1, in which the following abbreviations are used: DCP=dichloropyridine; TCP=trichloropyridine; penta=pentachloropyridine; hr=hours; GC=gas chromatography.
      <br/>
      It will be understood that these examples are illustrative and not limiting of the invention.

    <p num="38">EXAMPLE 1</p>
    <p num="39">
      A 1000 ml flask, equipped with a stirrer, reflux condenser, and thermometer, was charged with 2,3,5,6-tetrachloropyridine (Symtet) (54.2 grams, 0.25 mole), 250 ml of 95% acetic acid (5% water by weight), and tetramethylammonium bromide (0.51 grams, 0.0033 mole).
      <br/>
      The reaction mixture was warmed to 40 (degree)  C. and zinc dust (49.04 grams, 0.75 mole) was added in 5 equal portions over a 2 hour period holding the reaction temperature to 40-50 (degree)  C. The reaction mixture was then stirred for 6 hours at 40-50 (degree)  C. The reaction mixture was diluted with water (250 ml) and the pH raised to 7.0 with 50% NaOH solution.
