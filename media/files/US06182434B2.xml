      The process is carried out on a spinning system that has a driven spindle (13) and a balloon limiter (14) concentric with it, driven in the same direction as the spindle (13) an provided with an inner work surface (44).
      <br/>
      For the purpose of reaching the high operating speed, the yarn (P) entrained by the work surface (44) and running toward the tube (23) on the spindle (13) is first always given by the centrifugal process the shape of a rotating, open loop (48), from which the yarn (P) is subsequently drawn off and coiled directly onto the tube (23).
      <br/>
      In this connection, this rotating, open loop (48) can be radially delimited by a rotating or stationary limit ring (28).

    <heading>TECHNICAL DOMAIN</heading>
    <p num="1">The invention relates to a spindle spinning or spindle twisting process that is carried out on a spinning system with a feed device for the fiber formation, with a driven spindle for the tube and with a balloon limiter arranged parallel with the spindle, also driven and having on its inner side a work surface for contact with the yarn, and a spinning system for execution of the process.</p>
    <heading>STATE OF THE ART</heading>
    <p num="2">From U.S. Pat. No. 2,833,111 and in particular EP 0 496 114 A1 a spinning system is known in which a balloon limiter driven in the direction of the spindle's rotation serves as a support for the ring with the urchin or for another, equivalent means for carrying out a yarn force control before the yarn is coiled onto the tube.</p>
    <p num="3">
      The production speeds of such a spinning system are limited by a physical barrier that consists in that at extreme production speeds of spindles, the mass of the urchin or of another equivalent means causes a high degree of tensile stress that negatively influences the course of the spinning process as well as the practical characteristics of the yarn spun out.
      <br/>
      During operation there occurs at the same time a considerable urchin wear due to the contact with the fast running, extremely taught yarn.
      <br/>
      For this reason, it is necessary for the urchin to have been made of a very abrasion-resistant material and at the same time to be non-deformable for the purpose of overcoming the centrifugal forces in the yarn.
      <br/>
      These two conditions can only be fulfilled by using materials with greater density, resulting on the other hand in their greater specific mass.
      <br/>
      As was already mentioned, the urchin mass causes an undesired increase of stress in the yarn spun out, at constant rotational speeds of the balloon limiter rotating together with the urchin.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      In another known spinning system of the type cited above (GB 2,088,907 A) the balloon limiter is formed by an actuated bell.
      <br/>
      In this case the yarn coming from a drafting arrangement runs inside the bell up to its lower edge.
      <br/>
      At this lower edge the yarn goes through a guide opening and is then coiled over this lower edge onto a tube.
      <br/>
      Thus, the yarn force control before the yarn is coiled onto the tube is carried out in this case by means of a lower bell edge.
      <br/>
      But because the yarn first runs through the guide opening from the inside of the bell out and then over the lower bell edge back against the tube, a large yarn loop is created between the yarn and the bell; this loop produces a considerable frictional resistance in such a way that it is neither possible to spin out several types of yarn nor to increase production speed.
    </p>
    <heading>DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="5">The invention is based on the technical problem of creating a process of the type mentioned above and a spinning system for execution of the process, which reliably alleviates or eliminates all disadvantages stemming from the use of the known yarn force control before the yarn is coiled onto the tube and thereby makes possible the production of a high-quality ring spun or ring twisted yarn even at extremely high production speeds.</p>
    <p num="6">
      In so doing, the present invention features a process and a system in that the yarn entrained by the work surface of the balloon limiter goes directly from this work surface onto the tube as a rotating, open loop which stretches due to the action of the centrifugal force, in connection with which its reverse bending has a greater radial distance from the rotational axis of the spindle than that point on the work surface of the balloon limiter from which the yarn stretches into the rotating, open loop.
      <br/>
      In this process, a so-called yarn force control before yarn coiling onto the tube is carried out with the same yarn, namely by means of the rotating, open loop.
      <br/>
      In this case the advantage lies in the fact that no frictional resistances are caused that would limit the yarn in its faster movement to the tube, in such a way that the yarn coiling speed, that is, the spindle rotational speed, can be increased accordingly.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      In a further design of the invention it is provided for that the rotating, open loop is radially limited during operation.
      <br/>
      Through radial limitations, the size of the rotating, open loop, that is, the distance of its reverse bending from the rotational axis of the spindle can be reduced, in such a way that the production of a quality yarn becomes possible even with relatively small space requirements.
    </p>
    <p num="8">In a further design of the invention it is provided for that the yarn forming the rotating, open loop is braked before coiling onto the tube; above all, this makes it possible to choose not only the different rotational speeds, but also corresponding rotational speeds of the spindle and the balloon limiter.</p>
    <p num="9">The spinning system for execution of the process contains a feed device for the fiber formation, a driven spindle for the tube and a balloon limiter arranged parallel with the spindle, also driven and having on its inner side a work surface for contact with the yarn.</p>
    <p num="10">
      According to the invention, in such a spinning system it is provided for that a peripheral stop for the transition of the yarn from this work surface directly onto the tube is arranged on the work surface, in connection with which the yarn is formed by the action of the centrifugal force in the form of a rotating, open loop, whereby any desired point on the work surface which is situated at a greater distance from the entry end of the balloon limiter than the cited peripheral stop is arranged at the greater radial distance from the rotational axis than this peripheral stop.
      <br/>
      This spinning system operates according to the process according to the invention, in connection with which all earlier limitations in the domain of so-called yarn force control before the yarn is coiled onto the tube are dispensed with.
      <br/>
      In this way, it becomes possible to produce various types of yarn that are at least as good as the so-called ring spun yarn and, in so doing, to achieve high production speeds.
    </p>
    <p num="11">
      The self-regulating spindle or twisting system according to the invention makes it possible to manufacture the high-quality ring spun yarn or high-quality twists at extremely high production speed.
      <br/>
      Useful designs and further developments of the object of the invention are indicated in the subclaims.

    <heading>THE PROCESS FOR IMPLEMENTING THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="13">
      In FIG. 1 is the complete spinning system for spindle spinning, arranged at the frame 1 of the spinning machine, whose basic componentries form the feed device 2 of the fiber formation and the twisting and coiling mechanism 3 with an upstream control point for the beginning of the forming of the yarn balloon.
      <br/>
      In the case of the spinning system for spindle spinning, the feed device 2 is embodied by the typical draft device 4 with the exit rollers 5.
    </p>
    <p num="14">
      The draft device 4 is known in the widest variety of designs of spindle spinning or jet spinning and from further spinning systems, such that it is not described in more detail.
      <br/>
      The purpose of the draft device is to process the submitted fiber band in such a way that at the exit from the draft device a small band of fiber is available the longitudinal density of which corresponds to the longitudinal density of the spun yarn P. Mounted over the draft device 4 on the holder 6 and adjustable on the vertical rod 7 is a roving spool 8, from which unwinds the roving 9 that is fed over a guide 10 into the draft device 4.
      <br/>
      Indicated by the broken lines on the right side of FIG. 1 is an alternative arrangement of the supply of the draft device 4 with the band of fiber 11 drawn out of a can 12.
    </p>
    <p num="15">
      The twisting and coiling mechanism 3 (FIGS. 1, 2) consists of the spindle 13 and the balloon limiter 14 arranged concentrically to the spindle 13.
      <br/>
      Assigned to the draft device 4 is a control point 15 for the beginning of the forming of the yarn balloon 16 of the yarn P formed.
      <br/>
      This control point is mounted on the surface of at least one of the exit rollers 5 of the draft device 4 as a control contact for the yarn with the corresponding exit roller or the exit rollers 5.
      <br/>
      The arrangement of the control point 15 in the area of the clamping point of the exit rollers 5 makes it possible for the yarn P formed to exit without the typical yarn guide from the draft device 4 directly into the twisting and coiling mechanism 3.
    </p>
    <p num="16">
      The electric drive motor 18 of the spindle 13 is mounted on the spindle rail 19, which is mounted sliding by means of the sleeve 20 along the vertical guide rod 21, which is a component of the known, not illustrated, device for actuating the program-controlled, vertical reverse motion of the spindle 13 in the direction of the double arrow 22.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, the spindle 13 may also be operated with other typical drive means, e.g. with a belt transmission.
    </p>
    <p num="17">
      A tube 23 (FIG. 2) for the yarn coil 24 is placed on the spindle 13.
      <br/>
      The program of the motion of the spindle rail 19 in the direction of the double arrow 22 is determined by the selection of yarn coil 24.
      <br/>
      In the case of an alternative, not illustrated, kinematically reversed arrangement of the spindle 13 and the balloon limiter 14, the spindle is attached in stationary manner to the frame 1, while the balloon limiter 14 executes a vertical movement along the spindle 13.
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      The balloon limiter 14 is formed, for example, from a hollow cylinder 25 which has, on the side facing away from the control point 15, a funnel-shaped mouth 26 in the form of a radial flange 27.
      <br/>
      The balloon limiter 14/the funnel-shaped mouth 26 goes over into a limit ring 28 which is concentric to the axis 17 of the spindle 13 and which bears on its inside a limit wall 29, advantageously with a concave profile.
      <br/>
      This limit wall 29 goes over into the side wall 30 which runs essentially parallel with the radial flange 27 and ends in a short flange 31 that defines the opening for the passage of the spindle 13 and the tube 23 with the yarn coil 24 (FIGS. 2, 3).
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      The cylinder 25 is mounted rotating on aerostatic or roller bearings 32 in a two-piece sleeve 33, whose flange 34 is attached with devices not illustrated to the rail 35, which is attached with devices not illustrated to the frame 1 of the spinning system.
      <br/>
      The balloon limiter 14, which goes through the concentric opening 36 of the rail 35, is driven by the belt 37 of the electric motor 38 attached to the frame 1 (FIG. 1).
      <br/>
      The two-piece sleeve 33 has an inner radial groove 39 with a not illustrated radial opening for the entry and exit of the belt 37.
      <br/>
      The rotation of the balloon limiter 14 in the direction of the arrow 40 runs in the same direction as the rotation of the spindle 13 in the direction of the arrow 41.
      <br/>
      Should the occasion arise, the cylinder 25 can be produced as a rotor of the electric drive motor or it can be driven by a driven friction roll and the like.
      <br/>
      The limit ring 28, the funnel-shaped mouth 26 of the balloon limiter 14 and the side wall 30 delimit the direction-indicating cavity 42 that has the shape of a radial gap 43 (FIG. 3).
      <br/>
      The purpose of the direction-indicating cavity 42 will be explained later.
    </p>
    <p num="20">
      The balloon limiter 14 has an inner work surface 44 for contact with the yarn P, which is achieved between the entry end 45 and the exit end 46 (FIG. 2).
      <br/>
      The work surface 44 is the part of the surface of the cavity of the balloon limiter 14 against which the formed yarn is pressed by the centrifugal force and with which this yarn is entrained.
      <br/>
      The exit end 46 is situated on the work surface 44 in the greatest diameter of the limit wall 29 (FIGS. 2, 3).
      <br/>
      For the purpose of the invention, other forms of the work surface 44 in the cylindrical part of the balloon limiter 14 are also suitable.
      <br/>
      For example: the work surface is shaped in the middle as a bushing that widens conically toward the entry end on one side and toward the exit end on the other side.
    </p>
    <p num="21">
      The cylinder 25 is advantageously thin-walled and made of a light metal alloy or a composite.
      <br/>
      It is desirable for the work surface 44 to have a layer of a suitable material to ensure a low degree of friction with respect to the yarn, and for it to be highly wear-resistant.
      <br/>
      Should the occasion arise, to reduce the frictional properties with respect to the yarn, the work surface may be provided with a groove or a molded rib to produce ventilation effects; they usefully reduce direct contact of the yarn with the work surface of the balloon limiter, but on condition that the work surface is still able to entrain by the friction the yarn that runs through it.
    </p>
    <p num="22">
      Delimited on the work surface 44 is a peripheral stop 47 for the transition of the yarn P from the work surface 44 into the rotating, open loop 48, formed by the centrifugal force, as will be explained further.
      <br/>
      In the example of construction in FIG. 3, the peripheral stop 47 is situated in the transition area of the cavity from the cylinder 25 into the funnel-shaped mouth 26, which forms the smallest diameter of the work surface 44 of the balloon limiter 14.
      <br/>
      In another case, for example when designing the work surface with radial ribs (not illustrated), this peripheral stop may be situated in the last smallest diameter of the work surface 44, in the direction of movement of the yarn P through the balloon limiter 14.
      <br/>
      The radial distance A of the peripheral stop 47 from the axis 17 of the spindle 13 is smaller than the radial distance B of the limit wall 29 of the limit ring 28 from the axis 17 of the spindle 13, whereby this radial distance B is equal to the radial distance C of the exit end 46 from the axis 11 of the spindle 13 (FIGS. 3, 4).
      <br/>
      In FIGS. 3 and 4, the limit ring 28 is pictured with radial or tangential ventilation openings 49 (for reasons of simplification of the fig., only one ventilation opening 49 is drawn in), the purpose of which will be explained later.
      <br/>
      The direction of rotation of the spindle 13 and of the balloon limiter 14 according to the arrows 40, 41 is basically parallel.
    </p>
    <p num="23">
      While the work surface 14 rotates at rotations npp, the spindle 13 rotates for example only at rotations nv &lt;npp.
      <br/>
      It is therefore important that in operation, the movement of the balloon limiter 14 with respect to the rotation of the spindle 13 is always bound to a constant higher angular velocity of the balloon limiter 14 by means of known mechanical, electromechanical or electronic bonds, depending on which drive of the spindle 13 and of the balloon limiter 14 is used.
    </p>
    <p num="24">
      It is mentioned above that the balloon limiter 14 goes over into the limit ring 28.
      <br/>
      According to the present invention, a limit ring 28, stable in its position and concentric with the spindle 13, is adjacent to the balloon limiter 14 in the direction of movement of the yarn P through the balloon limiter 14.
      <br/>
      The word "is adjacent to" means that the limit ring 28 is either movably connected with the balloon limiter 14, as shown by FIGS. 1 through 3, or is arranged independently, either fixed or movably with its own drive, as will be indicated further on.
    </p>
    <p num="25">The spinning system according to FIGS. 1 through 4 operates as follows:</p>
    <p num="26">
      The fiber formation goes through three phases of change during the spinning process.
      <br/>
      In the section between the draft device 4 and the exit end 46 of the work surface 44, the "yarn is formed, in the section between the exit end 46 of the work surface 44 and the tube 23, the "yarn is reshaped" and on the tube 23 is the "resulting yarn".
      <br/>
      To simplify the description, unless otherwise necessary, the expression "yarn" will be used.
    </p>
    <p num="27">
      A band of fiber with the longitudinal density of the resulting yarn emerges from the draft device 4 into which the roving 9 unwound from the roving spool 8 is fed.
      <br/>
      Immediately after the clamping point of the exit rollers 5 of the draft device 4, the fiber formation is compacted by twists that are imparted to the fiber formation on the one hand by the action of the twisting of the beginning of the yarn P on the tube 23 due to the rotations (nv) of the spindle 13 and, on the other hand, by additional twists, caused by the rotations (npp) of the work surface 44 over which the yarn P entrained by it moves.
      <br/>
      A result of the rotational relation of the spindle 13 and the balloon limiter 14 is a high degree of twist in the yarn P in its section between the clamping point of the exit rollers 5 and the exit end 46 of the work surface 44 (FIG. 2).
      <br/>
      The beginning of the aforementioned yarn section is not directly in the clamping point of the exit rollers 5, because a small band of fiber emerges from this clamping point that is pulled by the rotation into the so-called rotation triangle whose vertex is the actual point of the beginning of the formed yarn balloon.
      <br/>
      For simplification, this small part of the length in the indicated yarn section can be ignored.
    </p>
    <p num="28">
      After the peripheral stop 47, the rotating yarn stretches, as a result of the action of the balance between the centrifugal force caused by the weight of the yarn, the reaction frictional force of the yarn during its movement over the work surface 44, and the reaction coiling force, into the rotating, open loop 48 and enters the radial gap 43 in which it is radially bound by the limit wall 29 over which the reverse bending 50 of the rotating, open loop 48 moves.
      <br/>
      The aforementioned peripheral stop 47 is delimited by the beginning of the rotating, open loop 48.
      <br/>
      The stretching/shaping of the rotating, open loop 48 is also influenced to a certain degree by the pneumatic force that act in the point of forming of the loop.
      <br/>
      Since these pneumatic forces are unessential for the forming of the rotating, open loop, they are not explained in greater detail in the description.
    </p>
    <p num="29">
      The radial distance D of the reverse bending 50 of the rotating, open loop 48 from the axis 17 of the spindle 13, which is greater than the radial distance A, influences the value of the centrifugal force the action of which causes the rotating, open loop 48 to form.
      <br/>
      In the case of a radial limitation of the rotating, open loop 48, the following physical processes run their course.
    </p>
    <p num="30">
      In the beginning of the forming of the rotating, open loop 48, it rotates freely in the space of the radial gap 43.
      <br/>
      As a result of the predominant size of the component of the inner force in the yarn, which is directed in the tangential direction to the periphery of the work surface 44, over the reaction frictional force directed in the same tangent, the yarn P shifts along the periphery of the work surface 44 against the direction of its rotation.
      <br/>
      In the meantime, the rotating, open loop 48 gradually enlarges as a result of the predominant inner force of the yarn over the resultant of the forces acting on the yarn sliding over the work surface 44, until the moment when its reverse bending 50 comes into contact with the limit wall 29 of the limit ring 28.
      <br/>
      As the first contact of the yarn with the aforementioned wall occurs, the yarn in its reverse bending 50 is entrained with the rotating, open loop 48 in the direction of rotation of the work surface 44, and this results in a coiling of the yarn's elementary part corresponding to the periphery onto the tube 23 and a corresponding elementary reduction in size of the rotating, open loop 48.
      <br/>
      In this way, the yarn's contact with the limit wall 29 is limited.
      <br/>
      It is thus clear that a principle develops of regulation of the radial distance of the reverse bending 50 of the rotating, open loop 48 from the axis 17 of the spindle 13 and thus a regulation of the coiling conditions for the yarn P onto the tube 23.
      <br/>
      In the radial gap 43 in which the yarn P begins to take the shape of the rotating, open loop 48, for the purpose of proper introduction onto the tube 23, the originally more highly twisted yarn changes in such a way that the originally excessive twist is eliminated.
      <br/>
      The section of the reshaped yarn begins between the exit end 46 and the tube 23, onto which the resulting yarn P is coiled with the desired twist Z. The formed yarn as well as the reshaped yarn P is thus more compacted by the additional twist, and this is made use of to obtain a very high degree of productivity of the yarn.
      <br/>
      This productivity can be significantly greater than with the peak productivity levels of ring spinning and it is therefore clear that the spindle may have extremely high rotational speeds, in connection with which the resulting yarn has the nature of classic ring spun yarn and even further advantages in the surface structure, as will be mentioned later.
    </p>
    <p num="31">The purpose of the direction-indicating cavity 42, especially of the radial gap 43, is the positional orientation of the rotating, open loop 48 in conformity with the coiling of the yarn P onto the tube 23.</p>
    <p num="32">
      When the twisting and coiling mechanism 3 starts up, due to the influence of the centrifugal force caused by the mass of the yarn, the rotating, open loop 48 forms which consumes the fiber formation delivered by the draft device 4 and it increasingly expands and its reverse bending 50 distances itself from the axis 17 of the spindle 13.
      <br/>
      In this first phase, the yarn does not yet coil itself onto the tube 23.
      <br/>
      The rotating, open loop 48 and the spindle 13 rotate in synchronous rotations, whereby there occurs between the yarn P and the work surface 44 a radial slip which balances out the difference in rotations between the spindle 13 and the work surface 44.
    </p>
    <p num="33">
      This is the first phase, during which the yarn is not yet coiled onto the tube 23.
      <br/>
      In the subsequent, second phase, with widenings of the distance of the reverse bending 50 of the rotating, open loop 48 from the axis 17, there is either a gradual or erratic increase in the frictional forces that cause the coiling of the yarn P onto the tube 23, namely in such a way that in a npp &gt;nv relation, the rotating, open loop 48x illustrated in broken line overtakes the spindle 13 in its rotation and inversely, in a npp &lt;nv relation, the rotating, open loop 48y delays in its rotation in relation to the spindle 13 (FIG. 4).
      <br/>
      In this second phase, the yarn P is coiled onto the tube 23 and the slip between the yarn and the work surface 44 becomes smaller.
    </p>
    <p num="34">
      The spinning process is characterized by a very rapid alternation of the two indicated phases, which goes into the continuous process in which there occurs a mutual pervasion of both phases.
      <br/>
      At both rotation relations npp &gt;nv and npp &lt;nv, it is necessary for the tractive force in the yarn to have a specific value, and not too low a value, where the filling of the rotating, open loop 48 with yarn would not be able to be completed, but not too great a value, either, such that the tensile stress in the yarn would not cause the yarn to draw and thereby would not cause a loss of the yarn stretching necessary for the subsequent processing stages.
    </p>
    <p num="35">
      Characteristic for the rotating, open loop 48, which overtakes the spindle 13 in its rotation or delays in its rotation in relation to the spindle 13, is its open form which is caused by dynamic effects on the yarn.
      <br/>
      The forces acting on the yarn are influenced by many factors, above all by the speeds of the spindle 13 and the balloon limiter 14, as well as frictional characteristics and the shape of the work surface 44 as well as of other components with which the yarn comes into contact.
    </p>
    <p num="36">The above shows that the rotating, open loop 48 itself forms a force control means that acts on the yarn P before it is coiled onto the tube 23 of the spindle 13.</p>
    <p num="37">Selection of the rotations npp in relation to nv is dependent, in a npp &gt;nv relation, on the technological procedure when spinning various degrees of yarn fineness and on the requirements for the resulting twist properties of the yarn.</p>
    <p num="38">The condition for the spinning process to progress satisfactorily with a favorable npp &gt;nv relation is for the npp rotations to have at least the value of the relation  (Equation image '1' not included in text)</p>
    <p num="39">where</p>
    <p num="40">
      0min signifies the minimum circumference of a yarn coil 24 on the tube 23, or in other words, the smallest circumference of the tube 23 in the area intended for coiling the yarn, and
      <br/>
      Z signifies the number of twists brought into a unit of length of the yarn.
    </p>
    <p num="41">In an extreme case of the npp &gt;nv relation, the relative rotations nr of the rotating, open loop 48 in relation to the work surface 44 are in the interval from 0 to n.</p>
    <p num="42">In this connection, the following relation applies:  (Equation image '2' not included in text)</p>
    <p num="43">
      where
      <br/>
      0max signifies the greatest circumference of a yarn coil 24 of the yarn on the tube 23.
    </p>
    <p num="44">The above shows that even in a borderline case of the relation selected, namely a minimal difference between npp and nv, practically throughout the process of creation of the yarn coil 24 on the tube 23, particularly of a conical yarn coil, there occurs a relative movement of the rotating, open loop 48 in relation to the work surface 44.</p>
    <p num="45">
      The relative movement of the rotating, open loop 48 is also accompanied by a relative movement of the formed yarn P not only crosswise over the work surface 44 from its entry end 45 to its exit end 46, but also by a relative movement along the periphery of the work surface 44, in connection with which this movement has a positive effect on the yarn formed.
      <br/>
      The peripheral movement of the formed yarn reduces its contact with the work surface 44 and thereby, the level of the reaction frictional force acting against the movement of the drawn yarn crosswise over the work surface 44 is also reduced.
      <br/>
      The peripheral movement at the same time rounds off the surface of the yarn and in this way usefully reduces its hairiness.
    </p>
    <p num="46">
      Under certain circumstances, particularly in the case of a greater selected difference between npp and nv, there also occurs a partial rolling of the formed yarn, which additionally compacts it temporarily, particularly in its section between the control point 15 and the limit wall 29 of the limit ring 28.
      <br/>
      The yarn in the rotating, open loop 48 nevertheless does not come into intensive mechanical contact, in such a way that no bundles of the surface fibers of the yarn are formed which would otherwise lead to a greater undesired stiffness of the yarn.
    </p>
    <p num="47">
      The purpose of the ventilation openings 49 in the limit wall 29 of the limit ring 28 is a continuous cleaning of the radial gap 43 of remainders of free fibers and other impurities that are drawn into this space during the spinning process.
      <br/>
      At the same time, these ventilation openings form an additional current of air in the radial gap 43 which usefully supports a stretching of the yarn into the rotating, open loop 48.

      For the operation of spinning in or startup, the spinning system (FIG. 1) is equipped with a foldable suction nozzle 51 and a not illustrated system for securing and releasing the housing 20 to/from the guide rod 21 and with a pivoting arrangement of the spindle rail 19.
      <br/>
      After stopping the balloon limiter 14 and the spindle 13, the spindle rail 19 with the spindle 13 is folded away into the lower position shown in broken line.
      <br/>
      The operator searches for the end of the yarn P on the tube 23 and threads the necessary yarn length through the balloon limiter 14, for example with a threading needle.
      <br/>
      When the spindle rail 19 moves, the length of the yarn threaded through is straightened into the working position in such a way that it is somewhat looser in the yarn forming section, to compensate for the forces acting on the yarn, because at the moment of spinning startup, the yarn is not yet compacted by an excessive number of twists.
      <br/>
      Throughout these manipulations, the band of fiber from the exit rollers 5 of the draft device 4 is sucked off by the suction nozzle 51, which was folded into working position (FIG. 1), into a not illustrated supply container for recyclable fiber material.
      <br/>
      After the typical connecting of the yarn to the emerging band, the spinning process begins by starting up the units of the twisting and coiling mechanism 3 in a npp &gt;nv relation.
      <br/>
      At startup of the work surface 44 as well as the spindle 13.
      <br/>
      The looser yarn in the section of its formation is not under tensile stress in standard manner.
      <br/>
      This makes it possible, as a result of the excessive weight of the centrifugal force, acting on the yarn, over the frictional force between the yarn being created and the work surface 44, to form the beginning of a rotating, open loop 48 in the radial gap 43 while at the same time forming a supply of newly formed and reshaped yarn.

      At a certain value of the frictional forces acting on the rotating, open loop 48 at the guide edge 95d of the guide ring 94d, a corresponding braking action can be exerted that also makes possible the npp =nv rotation relation.
      <br/>
      For the execution according to FIG. 10, the relation A&lt;C&lt;B applies and for the rotating, open loop 48 the relation A&lt;D.
      <br/>
      FIG. 11 represents a variant of the twisting and coiling mechanism 3e with the balloon limiter 14e formed from a hollow cylinder 25e.
      <br/>
      The work surface 44e goes over the peripheral stop 47e into the funnel-shaped mouth 26e in the form of a short flange 55e, which is ended by the exit end 46e of the work surface 44e.
      <br/>
      Placed in front of the balloon limiter 14e is a concentric, non-rotating balloon limiter 66e with an inner work surface 67e.
      <br/>
      The bearings of the balloon limiters 14e and 66e, the drive of the balloon limiter 14e and the spindle 13e are not illustrated.

    <p num="73">
      The rotating yarn P stretches due to the action of the centrifugal force caused by the mass of the yarn, from the peripheral stop 47e into the rotating, open loop 48, from which the yarn is continuously drawn and is coiled onto the tube 23e.
      <br/>
      In this form of execution the reverse bending 50 of the rotating, open loop 48 is not radially limited by any body.
      <br/>
      For the twisting and coiling mechanism 3e according to FIG. 11 the A&lt;C relation applies, and the A, C&lt;D relations apply to the forming of the rotating, open loop 48.

The balloon limiter 14g in the form of a hollow cylinder 25g reaches with its lower edge, which delimits the peripheral stop 47g and at the same time also the exit end 46g, into the cavity of the limit ring 28g with the limit wall 29g.

      With regard to FIG. 5 it should also be noted that it in the npp &gt;nv relation an open loop 48x forms that overtakes the spindle 13a in its rotation.

      Another variant of the twisting and coiling mechanism 3m is shown in FIG. 19. The funnel-shaped mouth 26m of the balloon limiter 14m, formed by the conical flange 90m, in this case goes over into a limit ring 28m whose limit wall 29m, by which a direction-indicating cavity 42m is delimited, comprises with the inner wall of the conical flange 90m an obtuse angle, in such a way that the limit wall 29m is situated diverging in relation to the axis 17 of the spindle 13m.

      <br/>
      The rear bough of the rotating, open loop 48 directed from the work surface 44m onto the tube 23m, continuously lowers during stretching of the rotating, open loop 48 until it touches the guide edge 95m of the guide ring 94m.
      <br/>
      This results in the braking of this rear bough at the guide edge 95m and the coiling of a corresponding section of the yarn P onto the tube 23m.
      <br/>
      By shortening the rotating, open loop 48, its rear bough comes into a higher position, thereby interrupting the yarn coiling.
      <br/>
      Similar to other forms of execution, this process of stretching and shortening of the rotating, open loop 48 is continuously repeated.

      The spinning system can operate at various rotational speeds.

      <br/>
      The rotations of the rotating, open loop 48 are always slower than those of the spindle 13m, however.

      FIGS. 20 and 21 show a variant of the twisting and coiling mechanism 3n with the balloon limiter 14n, which is embodied by a hollow rotation body 52n whose work surface 44n widens conically from the entry end 45n, which also forms the peripheral stop 47n of the work surface 44n.
      <br/>
      The exit end 26n of the work surface 44n of the balloon limiter 14n reaches into the limit ring 28n, which is formed in a body 99n attached by means not illustrated on a stationary ring rail 92n with concentric opening 93n.

      The limit wall 29n of the limit ring 28n goes on the one hand over the functional recess 100n into the upper radial side wall 101n of the limit ring 28n and, on the other hand, over the functional gap 102n into the guide ring's 94n guide edge 95n embodied by the lower radial side wall.
      <br/>
      This guide edge 94n is situated, with respect to the direction of movement of the yarn P through the balloon limiter 14n, behind a not illustrated plane running through the exit end 46n, between the exit end 46n and the limit wall 29n.
    </p>
    <p num="99">
      The direction-indicating cavity 42n in the form of a radial gap 43n, into which the exit end 46n of the work surface 44n reaches, is delimited by the limit wall 29n and the upper radial side wall 101n of the limit ring 28n on one side and the guide edge 95n of the guide ring 94n on the other side.
      <br/>
      For the purpose of adjusting the desired height of the radial gap 43n that ensures the steering of the formed yarn P onto the tube 23n, the guide ring 94n is mounted axially adjustable in the body 99n of the limit ring 28n.
      <br/>
      In the example of execution of the invention, the guide ring 94n is screwed with its threaded outer heel 103n into the thread 104n of the inner cylindrical recess 105n in the body 99n of the limit ring 28n.
      <br/>
      Arranged on the periphery of the upper side wall of the outer cylindrical heel 103n are the cleaning openings 106n whose not illustrated longitudinal axes run parallel with the axis 17 of the spindle 13n.

      The direction-indicating cavity 42n is connected by means of the functional gap 102n with the space 107n delimited by the upper side wall of the threaded outer heel 103n of the guide ring 94n, with the wall of the inner cylindrical recess 105n of the body 99n and with the rib-shaped closing 108n of the guide edge 95n of the guide ring 94n.

      The direction of rotation of the spindle 13n is marked by the arrow 41.

      For the construction of the twisting and coiling mechanism 3n the C&lt;B, D relation applies.
    </p>
    <p num="101">The inner wall 109n of the guide ring 94n tapers conically from the guide edge 95n; this facilitates the spinning startup process of the spinning unit.</p>
    <p num="102">
      During the operation, the radial gap 43n is affected by the movement and guiding of the section of the rotating, open loop 48 due to precise guiding of the yarn P onto the tube 24n.
      <br/>
      The air current through the radial gap 43n, caused by the movement of the yarn P, is intensively attenuated by its walls.
      <br/>
      That has a positive effect on the shaping of the rotating, open loop 48, particularly in the area around its reverse bending 50.
      <br/>
      The intensity of the force between the limit wall 29n of the limit ring 28n and the yarn P situated on it is reduced.
      <br/>
      The resulting force reduction results in reduced friction for the yarn P and reduced wear of the limit wall 29n.
    </p>
    <p num="103">
      The spinning system can operate at various rotational speeds of the balloon limiter 14n and the spindle 13n.
      <br/>
      It proves most advantageous when the rotations of the balloon limiter 14n are somewhat faster than those of the spindle 13n, but they may eventually also be equal or a bit slower.
      <br/>
      The rotations of the rotating, open loop 48 are always slower than those of the spindle 13m, however.
      <br/>
      This means that the rotating, open loop 48 into which the yarn P stretches from the peripheral stop 47n, delays in its rotation in relation to the spindle 13n.
    </p>
    <p num="104">
      The continuous removal of dust and fiber remainders arising during the spinning is ensured by the cleaning openings 106n during operation.
      <br/>
      The impurities are removed from the radial gap 43n into the outside surroundings by means of the functional gap 102n of the space 107n and the cleaning openings 106n.
      <br/>
      For the purpose of increasing the cleaning effect, these cleaning openings can be arranged with their longitudinal axes diagonally in relation to the axis 17 of the spindle 13n.
      <br/>
      Consequently, there is a drop in pressure between the ends of openings, which allows the removal of a larger quantity of air and in this way a faster movement of the impurities out of the radial gap 43n.
    </p>
    <p num="105">
      The above-mentioned shows that the spinning conditions can generally be changed by selecting the rotations of the balloon limiter, the spindle, and eventually also of the limit ring and their relations to each other.
      <br/>
      The variant is advantageous when the limit ring is constructed as a static limit ring, i.e., its rotations are equal to null.
      <br/>
      The rotation relation of the balloon limiter speed and the spindle has a considerable influence on the forming of a rotating, open loop delaying or overtaking in relation to the spindle rotation.
      <br/>
      Concretely speaking, the geometric arrangement of individual components and their surface layout also come into play.
      <br/>
      It is above all a matter of the shape and diameter of the balloon limiter and the limit ring, eventually also of the guide ring.
      <br/>
      The nature of the rotating, open loop can also be influenced by the layout and height of the direction-indicating cavity, if it is used for the spinning system, and eventually also by cleaning and ventilation openings.
    </p>
    <p num="106">
      By the selection of speeds of the spindle, the balloon limiter and the radial distances A, B, C and D, the spinning conditions can also be formed for the production of cotton, synthetic or mixed yarns of corresponding degrees of fineness, for example.
      <br/>
      In addition, the described twisting and coiling mechanisms are also suitable for yarn twisting.
    </p>
    <p num="107">
      One of the possible solutions of this kind is illustrated in broken line in FIG. 1.
      <br/>
      The linear formation 110 of a feed spool 111 and the linear formation 112 of another feed spool 113 can be fed in this case by means not illustrated in the direction of the arrow 114 and 115 to the exit rollers 5 of the draft device 4 and from there into the twisting and coiling mechanism 3 for the purpose of combining together into the twisted yarn.
