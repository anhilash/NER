      A blood collection device combining an elongated needle cannula and vial insertion cannula fixed to a rotatable reel.
      <br/>
      The rotatable reel is supported in an L-shaped bowl and hollow stem combination.
      <br/>
      A sloping needle cannula is injected into a body or vein inside of a body so blood or other fluid flows from the body into the needle cannula and into the vial insertion cannula.
      <br/>
      A vial is inserted into the bowl until the vial insertion cannula penetrates the soft vial plug and the vial then is filled with blood or other fluid.
      <br/>
      When sufficient blood or fluid is drawn into the vial, the vial is removed and a lever or button is pushed, releasing a biased coil spring which causes the reel to rotate, thus winding the needle cannula and the vial insertion cannula around the reel, destroying the needle cannula and the vial insertion cannula and further pulling the needle cannula into the hollow stem and the vial insertion cannula into the bowl, preventing a person from being accidentally pricked or otherwise injured by either contaminated cannula.

    <heading>BACKGROUND OF INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="1">
      There are several types of safety blood sampling designs available today.
      <br/>
      One such design is shown in a patent issued to Jagger et al on Jun. 3, 1986 U.S. Pat. No. 4,592,744. This is a safety blood sampling device that requires two hands to operate or to cover the needle cannula.
    </p>
    <p num="2">
      Blood samples are also taken with syringes and there are also many safety syringes available.
      <br/>
      Some of these designs have a sleeve or sheath that will cover the needle after it has been used.
      <br/>
      Some typical designs with sleeves or sheaths are Z. M. Roehr et al., U.S. Pat. No. 3,008,570; Z. M. Roehr, U.S. Pat. No. 3,107,785; Bartner et al., U.S. Pat. No. 3,895,633; G. K. Burke, U.S. Pat. No. 3,306,291; Gyure et al., U.S. Pat. No. 4,300,678; Winstead Hall, U.S. Pat. No. 4,356,822; Sampson, U.S. Pat. No. 4,425,120; Larson, U.S. Pat. No. 4,639,249; Harbaugh, U.S. Pat. No. 4,655,751; Strauss, U.S. Pat. No. 4,664,654; Braginetz, U.S. Pat. No. 4,666,435; Spencer, U.S. Pat. No. 4,702,738; Milorad, U.S. Pat. No. 4,702,739; Spencer, U.S. Pat. No. 4,801,295; Poncy, U.S. Pat. No. 4,816,022; and Hughes, U.S. Pat. No. 4,840,619.
    </p>
    <p num="3">
      Other designs have a retractable needle such as Weltman, U.S. Pat. No. 3,306,290; and Dent, U.S. Pat. No. 4,392,859. These designs do not have a means whereby the needle is extended from the syringe and held in place in a positive and rigid position in order to first inject the needle prior to injecting the medication.
      <br/>
      Still other designs have methods of bending the needle to render it harmless after the medication has been injected.
      <br/>
      Most of these designs have one major purpose and that is to prevent the spread of infectious diseases such as aids, hepatitis, or other diseases from accidental injection with a contaminated needle after the needle of the syringe has been inserted into a patient with the above mentioned disease.
      <br/>
      These various designs all work well to a degree, but they all fall short of their intended purpose during the act of covering the needle, or removing the needle, which requires two hands.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      All of these designs require at least two hands to operate.
      <br/>
      The use of two hands to cover the contaminated needle is most unsatisfactory in that during the act of placing a second hand on the blood sampling device or syringe, the person holding the blood sampling device or syringe in one hand may be bumped and accidentally inject the needle into their other hand before it can grasp the syringe.
      <br/>
      Other accidental jabbings or injections can happen in an ambulance where just as a person tries to grasp the contaminated blood sampling device or syringe, the ambulance can hit a bump in the road causing the person holding the blood sampling device or syringe to accidentally stick another person or themselves with the contaminated needle.
      <br/>
      The need has developed for a blood sampling device or syringe that will cover the contaminated needle with the use of only one hand.
    </p>
    <heading>SUMMARY</heading>
    <p num="5">
      It is the object of this invention to provide a blood sampling device wherein the needle of the blood sampling device is retracted into the barrel of the blood sampling device to protect others from an accidental pricking after it has been used.
      <br/>
      The needle cannula can be retracted into the barrel with the use of only one hand; and that one hand being the hand that was used to inject the needle cannula into a patient.
      <br/>
      It is still another object of the present invention to further prevent the accidental release of the needle cannula after the needle cannula is in the barrel of the blood sampling device.
      <br/>
      It is still yet another object of the present invention to provide a blood sampling device wherein the needle cannula is sloped for ease of skin penetration.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      The foregoing and other objects and advantages are attained by a blood sampling device.
      <br/>
      Another object of the present invention is to render the blood sampling device useless after the needle cannula is retracted into the barrel of the blood sampling device to prevent the accidental reuse of the contaminated device.
      <br/>
      This is accomplished using a hollow sloping cannula guide, a needle cannula, a reel, a biased spring and a vial guide tube in combination with a latching means, wherein when said blood sampling device is used to inject a needle cannula into a vein in the body or part of the body in order to withdraw blood for testing purposes, the latching means is released and the biased spring rotates the reel and further winds the needle cannula and the vial insertion cannula around said reel thereby rendering the needle cannula and the vial insertion cannula harmless and preventing the accidental pricking of others.
    </p>
    <p num="7">The features of the present invention can be best understood together with further objects and advantages by reference to the following descriptions taken in connection with accompanying drawing, wherein like numerals indicate like parts.</p>

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading>
    <p num="9">Referring to FIG. 1 there is shown an exterior elevational view of the device 1 of the preferred embodiment.</p>
    <p num="10">The cannula 6 is shown comprised of three sections: the needle cannula 7 that is the section of the cannula 6 that is inserted into a body, the cannula bend 9 is the section that is suitably bent around the bend bar 11, and the vial insertion cannula 8 or the part of the cannula 6 that is inserted into a blood collection vial.</p>
    <p num="11">
      The needle cannula guide 12 has a first end wherein the needle cannula 7 extends from the first end of the needle cannula guide 12.
      <br/>
      The needle cannula 7 is shown extending from the needle cannula guide 12 at a slight declivity 13.
      <br/>
      The declivity 13 allows the needle cannula 7 to be inserted into the flesh, veins, or arteries easier and to remain in the flesh with less stress on the flesh.
      <br/>
      The needle cannula guide has a second end that forms an elbow and a receptor 15 for the vial guide tube 14.
      <br/>
      The third end of the needle cannula guide 12 rests on part of the flesh that is penetrated by the needle cannula 7, and the fourth end is the area of the needle cannula guide 12 that forms the receptor 15 for the vial guide tube 14.
      <br/>
      The first end of the receptor 15 is where the needle cannula guide 12 rests on the flesh of a body, the second end of the recepter receives the vial guide tube 14.
