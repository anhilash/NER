      Field of the Invention
    </p>
    <p num="2">The present invention relates to an image converting apparatus suitable for a special effect image editing apparatus for performing various processes for an image of an input video signal, in particular, to an image converting apparatus for converting an input video image into an image with various metallic lusters.</p>
    <p num="3">2. Related Prior Art</p>
    <p num="4">
      A special effect image editing apparatus performs various processes for an image of an input video signal.
      <br/>
      Typical special effect processes performed by a conventional special effect editing image apparatus include enlarging an image, reducing an image, moving an image, rotating an image, emphasizing the contour of an image, shading off an image, color-inverting an image, and color- converting an image.
      <br/>
      Such a special effect image editing apparatus is used to generate an impressive image.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      In addition, a special effect process for changing the texture of a substance is desired.
      <br/>
      In other words, assuming that there is a doll made of ceramic, even if the colors of the image of the doll are changed, the contour thereof is emphasized, or the image is shaded off, the texture of the ceramic is not substantially changed.
      <br/>
      When reflected light of a metal can be represented for such an image, the image of the doll made of ceramics can be converted into an image of a doll made of gold or silver.
      <br/>
      Thus, when a special effect process for changing the texture of a substance can be performed, an image that has a completely different impression from the original image can be reproduced.
      <br/>
      Consequently, a very interesting image can be generated.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      A special effect process for converting an input image into an image with various metallic lusters requires calculations for the image conversion.
      <br/>
      It is necessary to analyze reflected light of the metal and perform calculations corresponding to the analyzed results.
      <br/>
      To do that, a model of reflected light for metallic lusters is created.
      <br/>
      With the model, the calculation process for generating metallic lusters is considered.
      <br/>
      However, a model of reflected light is represented in three dimensions.
      <br/>
      On the other hand, a conventional video signal is represented in two dimensions rather than three dimensions.
      <br/>
      Thus, it is difficult to perform a process for converting a video signal into an image with a metallic luster using the model of the conventional reflected light.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      In addition, since there are various patterns as input images, even if the process for generating a metallic luster is performed for an input image, a proper effect may not take place.
      <br/>
      In addition, in the case that the variations in the brightness of the input image is small, the image may be equally colored.
      <br/>
      Thus, in this case, a metallic luster may not take place.
      <br/>
      In contrast, when the variations in the brightness of the input image is large, the resultant image glares and thereby appears as an unsmooth image.
      <br/>
      Consequently, when the input signal is a video signal, it should be processed corresponding to the pattern.
    </p>
    <p num="8">Therefore, an object of the present invention is to provide an image converting apparatus for converting an image of an input video signal into an image with a metallic luster and representing a metallic luster with parameters designated corresponding to the input image.</p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="9">The above and other disadvantages of the prior art systems are overcome by the present invention of an image converting apparatus for converting an image of an input video signal into an image with a metallic luster, comprising a brightness signal extracting means for extracting a brightness signal component from the input video signal, a parameter designating means for designating parameters for converting the image, and a calculating means for performing calculations for generating a metallic luster for the image of the input video signal with the brightness signal extracted by the brightness signal extracting means and the parameters designated by the parameter designating means.</p>
    <p num="10">
      In the preferred embodiment the calculating means is composed of a look-up table.
      <br/>
      An amplitude designating means, disposed ahead of the calculating means in the signal processing, designates an amplitude characteristic of the input brightness signal supplied to the calculating means.
      <br/>
      A combining means, disposed after the calculating means in the signal processing, combines a video signal that has been image-converted by the calculating means and the input video signal corresponding to a key signal.
    </p>
    <p num="11">The present invention is furthermore an image converting method for converting an image of an input video signal into an image with a metallic luster, comprising the steps of extracting a brightness signal component from the input video signal, designating parameters for converting the image, and performing calculations for generating a metallic luster for the image of the input video signal with the brightness signal that has been extracted and the parameters that have been designated.</p>

      Generally, reflected light of an opaque substance is composed of diffusion reflected light and mirror-surface reflected light.
      <br/>
      With a model of reflected light of diffusion reflected light and mirror-surface reflected light, a model of reflected light of an opaque substance can be represented.
      <br/>
      Although the model of the reflected light is three-dimensional data, assuming that the brightness of the input video signal linearly varies, the model of the reflected light can be represented with brightness data.
      <br/>
      With a circuit that performs such calculations, a circuit that converts an input image into an image with a metallic luster can be accomplished.
    </p>
    <p num="13">
      When the circuit that performs such calculations is a look-up table, the circuit structure can be simplified.
      <br/>
      In addition, the process can be performed at high speed.
      <br/>
      Moreover, with parameters designated, an image of a substance with an optimum metallic luster can be reproduced on real-time basis.
    </p>
    <p num="14">
      When a pre-modifying circuit is disposed at an upstream stage from the circuit that performs the calculations, the dynamic range of a look-up table can be properly designated.
      <br/>
      In addition, with a key processor, a process for generating an image with a metallic luster can be performed when the brightness level exceeds a predetermined value.

    <heading>DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
    <p num="17">
      Next, with reference to the accompanying drawings, embodiments of the present invention will be described.
      <br/>
      The present invention is applied to an image converting apparatus for converting an image of an input video signal into an image with a metallic luster.
      <br/>
      It is considered that such an image converting apparatus analyzes a model of reflected light of a substance with a metallic luster, obtains a calculation equation for generating the metallic luster corresponding to the model, and performs a process for the input image corresponding to the input image.
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      First of all, the reflection of light from an opaque substance is analyzed and thereby a display model of a conventional opaque substance is created.
      <br/>
      When light emitted from a light source reaches the surface of a substance, the light is reflected on the surface and transmitted therefrom.
      <br/>
      The reflection of light from the source on the surface of the substance is generally categorized into diffusion reflection and mirror-surface reflection.
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      Diffusion reflection means a reflection in which incident light is repeatedly reflected and refracted on a layer of particles on the surface of the substance and thereby part of the light is emitted from the surface.
      <br/>
      Diffusion reflection takes place, for example, on the surface of chalk, rubber, or the like.
      <br/>
      On the other hand, a mirror-surface reflection means a reflection that takes place only on a shiny surface of a substance, as in a reflection from a mirror.
    </p>
    <p num="20">
      First, the diffusion reflection is analyzed.
      <br/>
      As described above, the diffusion reflection takes place when incident light is repeatedly reflected and refracted on a layer of particles on the surface of the substance and thereby part of the light is emitted from the surface.
      <br/>
      Such a diffusion reflection can be defined with the amount of energy of light.
      <br/>
      In other words, as shown in FIG. 1, the amount of energy of light that enters a unit area S of the surface of a substance 101 is proportional to cosine of the incident angle.
      <br/>
      With respect to the amount of light energy, assuming that the intensity of the incident light is represented by I, the intensity of the reflected light is represented by R, the reflection coefficient is represented by wd, and the incident angle is represented by  THETA , the diffusion reflection can be represented as follows:
      <br/>
      R=wd (cos  THETA )I  (1)
    </p>
    <p num="21">
      On the other hand, the mirror-surface reflection is a reflection that takes place only on the surface of a substance.
      <br/>
      As shown in FIG. 2, in the case of the mirror-surface reflection, incident light that reaches a substance 102 is reflected symmetrically with respect to the normal of the surface of the substance 102.
      <br/>
      Moreover, in the case of the mirror-surface reflection, light scatters and spreads due to a finely uneven surface.
      <br/>
      Thus, as shown in FIG. 3, in the case of the mirror-surface reflection, in addition to the direction of the regular reflection, incident light that reaches a substance 103 also reflects in the direction with an angle of  ALPHA  degrees to the direction of the regular reflection.
    </p>
    <p num="22">
      As described above, in the mirror-surface reflection, light reflects both in the direction of the regular reflection and the direction with the angle of  ALPHA  degrees thereto.
      <br/>
      The intensity of the reflected light is the strongest in the direction of the regular reflection.
      <br/>
      The intensity of the reflected light in the direction with the angle of  ALPHA  degrees to the direction of the regular reflection is attenuated by (cos  ALPHA )n.
      <br/>
      Thus, the mirror-surface reflection can be represented as follows:
      <br/>
      R=ws (cos  ALPHA )n I  (2)
    </p>
    <p num="23">where I is the intensity of the incident light, R is the intensity of the reflected light, Ws is the reflection coefficient, and  ALPHA  is the angle between the direction of the regular reflection and the direction of the view line.</p>
    <p num="24">
      As described above, on a general opaque substance, the diffusion reflection and mirror-surface reflection take place.
      <br/>
      The diffusion reflection and mirror-surface reflection can be represented by Equations (1) and (2), respectively.
      <br/>
      Thus, with Equations (1) and (2), a mode of reflected light of a general opaque substance can be created.
    </p>
    <p num="25">
      In the above description, the incident light is explained as simple light (brightness and darkness).
      <br/>
      However, light emitted from a light source has a particular spectrum.
      <br/>
      When light with a spectrum reflects on the surface of a substance, the reflected light has a spectrum of which a spectrum I ( GAMMA ) of the incident light and a spectrum R ( GAMMA ) of the reflected light are multiplied (P( GAMMA )=I( GAMMA )R( GAMMA )).
    </p>

      <br/>
      Reference numeral 111 is a reflection surface of the virtual substance.
      <br/>
      The x axis represents a horizontal position, the z axis represents a three-dimensional depth position, and the y axis extends downwardly on the drawing.
      <br/>
      Thus, in FIG. 7, the x-y plane is treated as a screen of a monitor.
      <br/>
      In addition, the direction of the view line is treated as the positive direction of the z axis.
      <br/>
      Light sources are disposed at x=0.80, x=0.56, and x=0.27. Rays of light are emitted from the light sources 121, 122, and 123 to the reflection surface 111 of the virtual substance 110.
    </p>
    <p num="38">
      Next, to consider only the diffusion reflection, in the mirror-surface reflection component in Equation (3),  ALPHA  is treated as a constant ( ALPHA =0).
      <br/>
      In the mirror-surface reflection,  ALPHA  represents the angle between the direction of the regular reflection and the direction of the view line.
      <br/>
      Thus, the angle  ALPHA  does not relate to the diffusion reflection.
      <br/>
      Assuming that the angle  ALPHA  between the direction of the regular reflection and the direction of the view line is 0, incident angles  THETA 1,  THETA 2, and  THETA 3 of the light sources 121, 122, and 123 are obtained with Equation (3).
      <br/>
      A curve z=f(x) that represents the surface 111 of the virtual substance 110 can be considered as follows:

      The normal of the substance 110 is placed between the light source and the view line, the angle between the light source and the normal and the angle between the view line and the normal being an angle  THETA , each.

      Next, the mirror-surface reflection term (d2 +ws (cos  ALPHA )n) in Equation (3) will be considered.

      To consider only the mirror-surface reflection term, it is assumed that  THETA  (reflection angle) of the diffusion reflection term in Equation (3) is constant.

      As represented by Equation (3), the mirror reflection level depends on the value of the cosine of the angle  ALPHA  between the direction of the regular reflection and the direction of the view line.

      Thus, with ( ALPHA =0), the mirror reflection level becomes the maximum.
      <br/>
      The mirror reflection level decreases corresponding to the angle  ALPHA .
      <br/>
      The condition ( ALPHA =0) is satisfied when the direction of the regular reflection matches the direction of the view line.

    <p num="46">
      Since the decrease curve is defined by the reflection curve z=f (x) represented by Equation (9), the decrease curve corresponds to a cosine curve.

      A combined curve 144 of the curves 141, 142, and 143 becomes a mirror-surface reflection curve.

      The parameter p and the parameters mR, mG, and mB are parameters of which the coefficient k4 in Equation (11) is divided into two portions.
