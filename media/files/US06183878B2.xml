      <br/>
      The invention concerns an electrochrome system comprising a mixture of reducible and oxidizable substances RED1 and OX2, at lest one RED1'-OX2' pair being covalently interlinked via a bridge and, for at least one RED1'' or OX2'' substance, the reciprocal conversion of the oxidized form and the reduced form being brought about by the fracture or formation of a sigma-bond.
      <br/>
      The electrochrome system is characterized by simplified electron transfer and reduced secondary reactions.

  <description format="original" lang="en" id="desc_en">
    <p num="1">The present invention relates to an electrochromic system, an electrochromic fluid comprising this electrochromic system, and an electrochromic device.</p>
    <p num="2">Electrochromic devices which contain an electrochromic system are already known.</p>
    <p num="3">
      Such devices customarily contain, as the electrochromic system, redox couples which are dissolved in an inert solvent.
      <br/>
      Additionally, conducting salts, light stabilizers and substances which affect the viscosity may be included.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      Used as a redox couple is one reducible and one oxidizable substance each.

      Electrochromic devices can be used in many different ways.
      <br/>
      For example, they may take the form of an automobile rearview mirror which during a journey at night can be darkened by a voltage being applied and thus prevents dazzling by the headlights of other vehicles (compare e.g. U.S. Pat. No. 3,280,701, U.S. Pat. No. 4,902,108, EP-A-0,435,689).
      <br/>
      Such devices may further also be employed in window panes or automobile canopies where, after a voltage has been applied, they black out the sunlight.
      <br/>
      Finally, such devices may also be used to build up a matrix display for graphic representation of information such as letters, numbers and symbols.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      Electrochromic devices normally comprise a pair of glass or plastic panes, one of which being mirrored in the case of an automobile mirror.
      <br/>
      One side of these panes is coated with a transparent, electroconductive layer, e.g. indium tin oxide (ITO).
      <br/>
      These panes are then used to construct a cell by their electroconductively coated sides which face one another being bonded, preferably cemented, to an annular or rectangular gasket.
      <br/>
      The gasket establishes a uniform spacing between the panes, for example from 0.1 to 0.5 mm. This cell is then, via a port, filled with an electrochromic solution and is tightly sealed.
      <br/>
      Via the ITO layer contact can be made separately with the two panes.

      The prior art electrochromic systems comprise redox couples which, after reduction and oxidation, form colored free radicals, cationic free radicals or anionic free radicals, which are chemically reactive.
      <br/>
      As disclosed, for example, by Topics in Current Chemistry, Vol. 92, pp. 1-44 (1980), such (ionic) free radicals may be sensitive with respect to electrophiles or nucleophiles or even free radicals.
      <br/>
      To achieve a high stability of an electrochromic device containing such an electrochromic system which is to survive several thousands of operating cycles it is therefore necessary to ensure that the solvent used is absolutely free from electrophiles, e.g. protons, nucleophiles and oxygen.
      <br/>
      It is also necessary to ensure that such reactive species are not formed by electrochemical processes on the electrodes during operation of the electrochromic device.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      The reverse reaction to RED1 and OX2 formulated according to the above reaction equation also takes place continuously away from the electrodes within the volume of the solution while the electrochromic device is operated.
      <br/>
      Because of the described hazards of degradation reactions of the free radicals or (ionic) free radicals by electrophiles, nucleophiles or free radicals it is important for the long-term stability of the display that the reverse reaction in accordance with the above reaction equation can take place as rapidly as possible and without side reactions.
    </p>
    <p num="10">We have found that in an electrochromic system which comprises at least one Red-Ox couple linked covalently with one another via a bridge and further at least one electrochromic substance which after reduction or oxidation is not converted into an (ionic) free radical species but has a closed electron shell in the reduced or oxidized form, the electron transfer is facilitated and side reactions can be avoided.</p>
    <p num="11">The present invention therefore relates to an electrochromic system comprising oxidizable substances RED1 which, by releasing electrons at an anode, are converted from a weakly colored or colorless form into a colored form OX1, and reducible substances OX2 which, by accepting electrons at a cathode, are converted from a weakly colored or colorless form into a colored form RED2, the absorbance in the visible region of the spectrum increasing in each of these cases, and the weakly colored or colorless form being recovered in each case after charge equalization, wherein the substances RED1 and OX2 are a mixture comprising at least one couple RED1 '/OX2 ' which is linked covalently to one another via a bridge and at least one substance RED1 " or OX2 " in which the reciprocal conversion of oxidized and reducible form takes place by a  SIGMA  bond being broken or formed.</p>

      The reduction and oxidation processes in the electrochromic system according to the invention generally take place by electrons being accepted or released at a cathode or anode, respectively, a potential difference of from 0.3 to 3 V preferably obtaining between the electrodes.
      <br/>
      After the electric potential is switched off, charge equalization generally takes place spontaneously between the substances RED2 ' and OX1 ', RED2 " and OX1 ' or RED2 ' and OX1 ", respectively, accompanied by bleaching or fading of the color.
      <br/>
      Such a charge equalization also takes place even while the current is flowing in the interior of the electrolyte volume.

      The present invention therefore further relates to electrochromic devices containing an electrochromic fluid according to the invention.
      <br/>
      The design of an electrochromic device which may be configured, e.g., as a window pane, automobile canopy, automobile rearview mirror or display, is known in principle.
      <br/>
      The electrochromic device according to the invention comprises two transparent glass or plastic panes which face one another, one of which is optionally mirrored and whose sides which face one another are coated electroconductively, e.g. with indium tin oxide (ITO), between which the electrochromic fluid according to the invention is located.
      <br/>
      If one of the panes is mirrored, it may likewise be utilized as a conductive layer.
      <br/>
      The spacing of the two panes is generally 0.05-1 mm, preferably 0.1-0.5 mm. The desired spacing between the panes is generally established by means of a gasket.
    </p>
    <p num="63">
      The gasket may be made, for example, from plastic or thin glass or another non-conductive material which is inert with respect to the electrochromic fluid.
      <br/>
      This may involve, for example, adhesives which cure thermally or photochemically, for example epoxy resins or acrylates.
      <br/>
      The distance between the panes may be established by means of spacers, for example small plastic or glass spheres, or certain sand fractions.
    </p>
    <p num="64">
      In addition to the above-described novel electrochromic substances in particular of the formulae (1), in particular the formulae (Ia) to (Id) and (CI) to (CIV), the novel self-erasing single-cell electrochromic device may also contain other substances such as those described, for example, in U.S. Pat. No. 4,902,108, Topics in Current Chemistry, Vol. 92, pp. 1-44 (1980) and Angew.
      <br/>
      Chem. 90, 927 (1978).
      <br/>
      Such electrochromic substances are members, for example, of the groups specified above under the formulae (II) to (XX), in which case none of the specified radicals can then have the meaning "direct bond to the bridge B".
      <br/>
      An admixture of such redox systems may be advantageous, for example, to correct or intensify the hue of e.g. the display, when energized, in the case of the electrochromic device according to the invention.
