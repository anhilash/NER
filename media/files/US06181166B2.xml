      <br/>
      A signal driver circuit uses a single power supply to provide differential low voltage swing signals for use in an integrated circuit.
      <br/>
      The driver reduces interconnect voltage swing and power consumption, while improving the speed performance of the interconnect.
      <br/>
      The driver includes series coupled drive transistors to provide differential signals on integrated circuit interconnects.
      <br/>
      The driver circuit can include circuitry to place the interconnects in a tri-state condition to allow for shared interconnects.
      <br/>
      An integrated circuit, such as a processor, includes first and second differential interconnects, a receiver circuit connected to the first and second differential interconnects for detecting a differential voltage provided thereon, and a driver circuit connected to the first and second differential interconnects for providing the differential voltage.

    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">
      Integrated circuits are fabricated to include multiple circuits performing different functions.
      <br/>
      These circuits are physically distributed across the integrated circuit and often need to communicate with each other.
      <br/>
      The communication, therefore, is accomplished using complex, and often Iong, interconnect lines, or buses.

      Rapidly increasing integration density, in combination with on-die heat dissipation problems, has motivated a strong interest in exploring low-power/low-voltage circuit methodologies, while retaining high performance.
      <br/>
      As the integration density increases, major on-chip performance bottlenecks are experienced as a result of long point-to-point interconnects between and within an integrated circuit Functional Unit Blocks (FUB's).
      <br/>
      This is primarily because interconnect capacitance per unit length, dominated by sidewall fringing and cross-coupling, increases with lateral dimension scaling.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      Mixed (multiple) voltage swing based CMOS circuit techniques have been studied previously for high performance/low power on-chip data path interconnects.
      <br/>
      See for example Nakagome et al., "Sub-1-V Swing Internal Bus Architecture for Future Low-Power ULSI's", IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits, April 1993, pp. 414-419, and Krishnamurthy et al., "Exploring the Design Space of Mixed Swing QuadRail for Low Power Digital Circuits", IEEE Transactions on VLSI Systems, December 1997, pp. 388-400 for different mixed voltage swing based CMOS circuit techniques.
      <br/>
      The general principle behind these approaches is to suppress voltage swings across long interconnects by employing an additional pair of power supply rails (Vdd2 and Vss2). driver circuit is used to receive an input signal and provides an output signal on internal interconnect lines.
      <br/>
      The output signal is limited to voltage swings between Vdd2 and Vss2.
      <br/>
      The voltage power rails, Vdd2 and Vss2, can be externally provided, or internally generated.
      <br/>
      For a given Vdd1 and Vss1, reducing the low voltage swing Vdd2-Vss2) offers a nearly linear, to quadratic, reduction in interconnect power depending on how the additional pair of power rails are generated, eg., by employing on-chip series regulation or off-chip switching regulation techniques.
      <br/>
      Providing the additional voltage supply creates a burden, particularly in low-voltage circuits.
      <br/>
      This burden is created by both area penalty of generating the power supply and penalties in routing the addition power rails throughout the integrated circuit.
      <br/>
      Further, the additional power supply must provide the drive current needed to drive long bus lines.
      <br/>
      Thus, a low voltage, high current second power supply would be needed.

    </p>
    <p num="12">
      Source follower based mixed swing circuitry is described herein which eliminates the need for an additional pair of power supply rails required by existing techniques.
      <br/>
      The described circuitry employs a fully differential, tri-state NMOS-only driver to drive point-to-point on-chip data path interconnects.
      <br/>
      FIG. I illustrates a block diagram of an integrated circuit 100 which provides communication between a first circuit 102, or Functional Unit Block, and a second circuit 104.
      <br/>
      The integrated circuit 100 can be any type of integrated circuit, including, but not limited to, processors, controllers, memory devices, and application specific integrated circuits (ASIC).
      <br/>
      Signals provided by the first circuit 102 are driven by a driver circuit 106 over internal interconnects 108.
      <br/>
      The driver circuits 106 and 106' provide differential signals on the interconnects which have a reduced voltage swing that is less than a voltage differential of a single power supply, or a single pair of voltage rails.
      <br/>
      Tri-state circuitry 112 is provided in drive circuitry 106 to selectively place the internal interconnects 108 in a tri-state condition.
      <br/>
      A receiver circuit 110 detects the differential signals and provides an output, restored to full power rails, to the second circuit 104.
    </p>
    <p num="13">
      The driver circuit described herein provides a static output.
      <br/>
      That is, the interconnect voltage swing is switched only when input data transitions.
      <br/>
      As such, interconnect dynamic power drops linearly with the reduced bus switching activity.
      <br/>
      This represents a substantial savings in power compared to other dynamic low swing approaches which precharge and evaluate the bus every cycle, independent of input data activity, contributing to a large dynamic power loss at low input data activities.
    </p>
    <p num="14">
      FIGS. 2-5 illustrate four embodiments of a driver circuit according to the present invention.
      <br/>
      Each circuit shares the power and ground rails (Vdd1 and Vss1) with peripheral circuitry (operating at CMOS levels, Vdd1-Vss1), and does not require an additional power supply.
    </p>
    <p num="15">
      Referring first to FIG. 2, a driver circuit 206 is illustrated which receives an input signal on node 220 and provides a differential output on interconnect lines 250 and 252.
      <br/>
      The interconnect lines 250 and 252 are generally illustrated as having a line resistance and bulk capacitance.
      <br/>
      It will be understood that the electrical characteristics will be dictated by the layout and fabrication of the integrated circuit.
      <br/>
      The driver circuit 206 also receives a tri-state enable signal (Tr_enable) on node 222 to place the differential outputs in a tri-state condition such that additional driver circuits (see FIG. 1) can actively drive the interconnect lines 250 and 252.
    </p>
    <p num="16">
      The driver circuit 206 includes first series connected transistors 230a, 230b, 230x and second series connected transistors 240a, 24b, 240x.
      <br/>
      In general, transistors 230a and 240a are pull-up transistors, transistors 230b and 240b are pull-down transistors, and transistors 230x and 240x are tristate transistors for the two interconnects.
      <br/>
      These transistors are preferably n-channel field effect transistors (FET) used to drive the interconnect lines 250 and 252 and define the voltage swing provided in these interconnect lines.
      <br/>
      A substrate connection for the drive transistors 230a, 230b, 230x and 240a, 24b, 240x are coupled to Vss1, in this embodiment.
    </p>
    <p num="17">
      The tri-state enable signal provided on node 222 is coupled to the gate of tristate transistors 230x and 240x.
      <br/>
      When the Tr_enable signal is in a low state, these transistors are turned off.
      <br/>
      Likewise, inverters 236 and 246 force NOR gates 234 and 244, respectively, to have a low output.
      <br/>
      As such, transistors 230a and 240a are turned off.
      <br/>
      The interconnect lines 250 and 252, therefore, are placed in a tri-state condition, and the interconnect lines can be driven by an additional driver circuit.
      <br/>
      It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that the logic gate 234 of the tristate circuitry, including 234, 236, 238, 244 and 246, could be adapted to control the gate of the pull-down transistor 230a or 240a by placing the tristate transistor 230x or 240x in the pull-up circuit.
      <br/>
      That is, the tristate transistor would be placed between the interconnect line connection and Vddl.
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      In operation (Tr_enable is high), true and complementary data signals from input line 220 drive the NMOS driver transistors 230a, 230b and 240a, 240b.
      <br/>
      Thus, transistors 230x and 240x are activated and the output of NOR gates 234 and 244 are controlled by true and complementary data signals 220.
      <br/>
      Transistors 230b and 240b are controlled directly by the data signals.
      <br/>
      Note that inverter 238 is included to provide a complementary data signal in response to data line 220.
      <br/>
      The voltage signal on the interconnect lines transition between Vdd1-Vt and Vss1, where Vt is the threshold voltage drop of transistor 230a or 240a.
      <br/>
      A fully differential sense amplifier 210 regenerates a regular voltage swing signal (Vdd1-Vss1) at a receiving end of the interconnect lines in response to the differential signals on lines 250 and 252.
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      An alternate embodiment of the driver circuit is illustrated in FIG. 3.
      <br/>
      The driver circuit 206 includes series drive transistors 230a-x and 240a-x which have their substrate connected to a substrate voltage, Vsub, which is greater than Vss1.
      <br/>
      The interconnect voltage, therefore, transitions between Vdd1-n*Vt and Vss1, where, n represents the extent to which the signal swing is suppressed by the back-bias applied to the substrate rails (Vsub-Vss1).
      <br/>
      While the increase in back-bias increases the voltage swing on the interconnect by reducing the transistor threshold voltages, the drive current of transistors 230a-x and 240a-x is increased, providing increased performance.
    </p>
    <p num="20">
      Referring to FIG. 4, an alternate driver circuit 206 is illustrated which receives an input signal on node 220 and provides a differential output signal on interconnect lines 250 and 252.
      <br/>
      The driver circuit 206 also receives a tri-state enable signal (Tr-enable) on node 222 to place the differential outputs in a tri-state condition such that additional driver circuits can actively drive the interconnect lines.
    </p>
    <p num="21">
      The driver circuit includes first series connected transistors 280a, 28b, 280x and second series connected transistors 284a, 284b, 284x.
      <br/>
      These transistors are preferably n-channel field effect transistors (FET) which provide intermediate outputs 300 and 302.
      <br/>
      Additional transistors 288-294 are provided to drive the interconnect lines 250 and 252 and define the voltage swing provided in the interconnect lines.
    </p>
    <p num="22">

      <br/>
      The intermediate outputs 300 and 302, therefore, are placed in a tri-state condition.
      <br/>
      Transistors 288-294 are also tri-stated, and the interconnects 250 and 252 can be driven by an additional driver circuit.

    <p num="23">
      In operation (Tr_enable is high), true and complementary data signals from input line 220 drive the series NMOS transistors 280a, 280b and 284a, 284b.

      That is, transistors 280x and 284x are activated and the output of NOR gates 234 and 244 are controlled by true and complementary data signals derived from input line 220.
      <br/>
      Transistors 280b and 284b are controlled directly by the data signals.
      <br/>
      The intermediate outputs 300 and 302 transition between Vdd1-Vt and Vss1, where Vt is the threshold voltage drop of transistors 280a or 284a.
      <br/>
      These intermediate outputs 300 and 302 control the "cascaded" transistors 288, 290, 292 and 294.
      <br/>
      Transistors 288 and 290 drive interconnect line 250, while transistors 292 and 294 drive interconnect line 252.
      <br/>
      The cascaded architecture of the driver circuit 206 of FIG. 4 further reduces the interconnect voltages from the voltages experienced with the drivers of FIGS. 2 and 3.
      <br/>
      That is, by reducing the voltage swing on the intermediate outputs 300 and 302, the interconnect voltages are further reduced by the threshold voltages of transistors 288-294.
    </p>
    <p num="24">
      While the substrate connection for the drive transistors 288-294 are coupled to Vss1, in the embodiment of FIG. 4, an alternate driver circuit 206 is illustrated in FIG. 5 where the substrate connection for the drive transistors 288-294 are coupled to a substrate voltage, Vsub, which is greater than Vss1.
      <br/>
      As explained above, the voltage transitions on interconnect lines 250 and 252 are suppressed by the back-bias applied to the substrate rails (Vsub-Vss1).
      <br/>
      While the increase in back-bias reducing the transistor threshold voltages and increases the voltage swing on the interconnect, the drive current of transistors is increased and provides an increase in performance.
    </p>
    <p num="25">
      The above described drivers reduce the voltage swing across the integrated circuit interconnects.
      <br/>
      Since the voltage swing across the interconnect is reduced, a linear dynamic power reduction is achieved compared to a static CMOS (full swing) implementation.
      <br/>
      Power savings are obtained without employing any additional power rails as compared to two additional rails in prior static CMOS-based low swing driver approaches (Vdd2 and Vss2), offering significant layout area savings as well.
    </p>
    <p num="26">
      The reduced voltage swing across the interconnect lines results in a nearly linear reduction in driver delay compared to full-swing operation.
      <br/>
      This reduction in driver delay is achieved without a loss in the driver transistors' on-drive voltage (Vgs).
      <br/>
      Prior static CMOS-based low swing drivers suffer from a linear reduction in on-drive voltage with reducing voltage swings and hence offer much lesser delay improvements.
      <br/>
      See Krishnamurthy et al., IEEE/ACM Intl.
      <br/>
      Symposium on Low Power Electronics and Design, August 1996, pp. 381-386 for a demonstration that a 6% degradation in performance is experienced on 2000  MU m data path interconnects with CMOS-based low swing drivers.
      <br/>
      The present invention enables considerable downsizing of drive transistors for a given delay constraint, leading to further power savings as well as layout area savings.
      <br/>
      Additionally, repeaterless interconnects can be driven for much longer distances on-chip than prior approaches.
    </p>
    <p num="27">
      Since the present invention provides a tristate driver, multiple drivers can drive the same interconnect bus (with only one driver's Tr_enable asserted during a given clock phase) significantly improving interconnect routing channel density for a given bus bandwidth.
      <br/>
      Further, since much longer interconnects can be driven without repeater insertion, bidirectional transceiver techniques employed on full-swing off-chip interconnects may be used.
      <br/>
      This has the potential to offer a full 2 * improvement in bandwidth compared to a unidirectional repeater-based transceiver circuit.
      <br/>
      In addition, the invention is fully differential and hence achieves high Common Mode Rejection Ratios comparable to single-ended full-swing static-CMOS driver schemes.
    </p>
    <p num="28">
      Prior driver circuitry applies a fixed source-bulk voltage of Vss2 on the driver's NMOS pull-down transistor (not shown), contributing to body effect and degrading performance.
      <br/>
      As the interconnect voltage swing decreases, Vss2 increases, increasing body effect and further degrading performance.
      <br/>
      In the present invention, the NMOS driver pull-up transistor 230a or 288a suffers from a transient body effect as the output charges towards Vddl; the body effect is maximized only when the output has charged fully to Vdd1-n * Vt.
      <br/>
      Thus, body effect induced performance loss decreases with reducing interconnect voltage swing.
      <br/>
      Again, the body terminals of the driver devices can be tied to a positive supply Vsub&gt;Vss1, as explained above.
      <br/>
      This essentially forward biases the source-drain junctions and reduces the driver devices threshold voltage, contributing to delay improvement.

One embodiment of the differential sense amplifier circuit is illustrated in FIG. 6.
      <br/>

      When CLK transitions to a low state, transistor 310 is activated and the differential voltages provided on inputs 302 and 304 activate either transistor 306 or 308.
