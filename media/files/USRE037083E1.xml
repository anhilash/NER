      A method of driving a surface discharge plasma display panel has a reset step of applying a pulse of a first voltage to paired first and second electrodes, a write step of applying a pulse of a second voltage to second and third electrodes corresponding to cells to be turned ON, and a sustain discharge step of applying an AC pulse of a fourth voltage to the paired first and second electrodes.
      <br/>
      The pulse of the first voltage is so set that it is higher than a first discharge start voltage, a third voltage caused by the discharge is higher than the first discharge start voltage, and the first, second, and third electrodes have the same potential after the application of the pulse of the first voltage.
      <br/>
      Therefore, an address discharge of the surface discharge plasma display panel can be caused by a wide range of voltages, and display quality of the panel can be improved.

    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="1">
      1.
      <br/>
      Field of the Invention
    </p>
    <p num="2">The present invention relates to a method and an apparatus for driving a surface discharge plasma display panel, and more particularly, to a method and an apparatus for driving a three-electrode surface-discharge alternating-current plasma display panel (AC PDP).</p>
    <p num="3">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
    <p num="4">
      Recently, flat display panels such as AC PDPs are required to have large screens, large capacity, and the ability to display full-color images.
      <br/>
      In particular, the AC PDPs are required to provide more display lines and intensity levels and stably rewrite their screens without decreasing the luminance of the screens.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      Conventionally, a line-by-line self-erase addressing method for driving the PDP is proposed.
      <br/>
      In the prior art driving method, wall charges (which are charges caused on the surface of the wall) remain during the reset period, and decrease the address discharge.
      <br/>
      Fluctuations in the remnant wall charges narrow the range of the potential for securing the stable operation of the PDP under various conditions.
      <br/>
      The fluctuations also change an optimum value of the potential, to destabilize the operation of the PDP or lower the display quality thereof.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      Further, in another prior art driving method, for example, 256 shades of gray can be realized by dividing a frame into eight sub-fields (which are disclosed in, for example, Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication (Kokai) No. 4-195188 and Japanese Patent Application No. 4-340498).
      <br/>
      In this driving method, two to three times of discharge should be carried out in the reset period, to uniformly distribute wall charges and secure stable operation.
      <br/>
      However, the discharge produces light even when displaying black, and thus the contrast of PDP is deteriorated.
      <br/>
      Note that the related art and the problems thereof will be briefly explained later.
    </p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="7">
      An object of the present invention is to provide a method and an apparatus for driving a surface discharge plasma display panel with a wide range of voltages for causing address discharge, to improve the display quality of the panel.
      <br/>
      Further, another object of the present invention is to provide a method and an apparatus for driving a surface discharge plasma display panel that displays black with low luminance, to improve the display quality of the panel.
    </p>
    <p num="8">According to the present invention, there is provided a method of driving a surface discharge plasma display panel having a first substrate, first and second electrodes arranged in parallel with each other on the first substrate and paired for respective display lines, a second substrate spaced apart from and facing the first substrate, third electrodes arranged on the first or second substrate away from and orthogonal to the first and second electrodes, wherein the method comprises a reset step of applying a pulse of a first voltage to the paired first and second electrodes; a write step of applying a pulse of a second voltage to the second and third electrodes corresponding to cells to be turned ON; and a sustain discharge step of applying an AC pulse of a fourth voltage to the paired first and second electrodes, wherein the pulse of the first voltage being so set that it is higher than a first discharge start voltage, a third voltage caused by the discharge is higher than the first discharge start voltage, and the first, second, and third electrodes have the same potential after the application of the pulse of the first voltage.</p>
    <p num="9">
      The plasma display panel may have a wall charge accumulating dielectric layer covering the surfaces of the first and second electrodes, a phosphor formed over the second substrate, a discharge gas sealed in a cavity defined between the first and second substrates, and cells formed at intersections where the first and second electrodes cross the third electrodes; the reset step may be used to cause discharge between the first and second electrodes and uniformly distribute charges over the dielectric layer; the write step may be used to cause discharge between the second and third electrodes, so that predetermined quantities or more of first and second wall charges of opposite polarities are accumulated on the dielectric layer on the first and second electrodes, respectively, in the cells to be turned ON; the sustain discharge step may be used to turn ON the cells in which the sum of the third voltage between the first and second wall charges and the fourth voltage having the same polarity as the third voltage exceeds a first discharge start voltage, and to alternate the opposite polarities of the first and second wall charges; and the reset step, the write step, and the sustain discharge step may be repeatedly carried out, so that the polarity of the AC pulse in the sustain discharge step is opposite to that of the pulse of the first voltage in the reset step.
      <br/>
      An erase pulse that is lower than the first discharge start voltage and gently rises may be applied to the first and second electrodes after the application of the pulse of the first voltage during a reset period, to add the voltage of the erase pulse to the first and second wall charges that have not been erased by the pulse of the first voltage due to abnormalities in the cells, thereby discharging and erasing the remnant wall charges.
    </p>

    <p num="29">
      FIG. 2 shows a cycle of voltage waveforms applied to the electrodes according to a first prior art method for driving the PDP.
      <br/>
      Namely, FIG. 2 shows one driving cycle in "line-by-line self-erase addressing method" of the prior art.
      <br/>
      In FIG. 2, (i), (ii), (iii) and (iv) are waveforms of address electrodes Aj, sustain electrodes X, selected sustain electrode Ys, and unselected sustain electrodes Yt, respectively.
      <br/>
      Also, in FIG. 2, "W" corresponds to a write discharge in all cells in a selected line, "A" corresponds to a self-erase address discharge in specified cells in a selected line, and "S" corresponds to a sustain discharge.
    </p>
    <p num="30">
      In this prior art line-by-line self-erase addressing method, the sustain electrodes Yi are sequentially selected from Y1 to Yn.
      <br/>
      Further, in the following explanations, a selected one of the sustain electrodes Yi is represented by Ys and the remaining unselected electrodes by Yt.
      <br/>
      For example, if s=1, then t=2 to n. A line of cells corresponding to the sustain electrode Ys is called the selected line, and lines of cells corresponding to the unselected sustain electrodes Yt are called the unselected lines.
      <br/>
      In the selected line, the address electrodes Aj corresponding to cells to be turned ON are represented by Aa and the cells to be turned OFF are represented by Ab.
    </p>
    <p num="31">First, the sustain electrodes Yt are set to 0V, and a write pulse of potential VW is applied to the sustain electrodes X. At the same time, a pulse of potential VS is applied to the sustain electrode Ys.</p>
    <p num="32">
      A discharge start voltage between the sustain electrodes X and Yi is Vfxy.
      <br/>
      The potential VW is set as follows:
      <br/>
      VS+VW&gt;Vfxy&gt;VW   (1)
    </p>
    <p num="33">(Note that the determining of the potential VS will be explained later.)</p>
    <p num="34">
      All cells in the selected line cause write discharge W between the sustain electrodes X and Ys.
      <br/>
      As the discharge develops, electrons, i.e., negative wall charges accumulate over the protective film 13 on the sustain electrode X corresponding to the selected line (hereinafter referred to as the sustain electrode X side).
      <br/>
      On the other hand, ions, i.e., positive wall charges accumulate over the protective film 13 on the sustain electrode Ys.
      <br/>
      These wall charges reduce the strength of an electric field in the discharge cavity, so that the discharge quickly comes to an end within one to several microseconds.
      <br/>
      The voltage due to the wall charges at the end of the discharge is Vwall1.
    </p>
    <p num="35">
      Next, the sustain electrodes Ys and Yt are set to 0V, and a sustain pulse of -VS is applied to the sustain electrode X. The potential VS is determined as follows:
      <br/>
      VS+Vwall1&gt;Vf&gt;VS   (2)
    </p>
    <p num="36">As a result, the sustain electrodes X and Ys of only the selected line cause a sustain discharge S. Opposite to the previous case, positive wall charges accumulate on the sustain electrode X side and negative wall charges on the sustain electrode Ys side.</p>
    <p num="37">
      Further, the sustain electrodes X and Yt and the address electrodes Aa are set to 0V, and a sustain pulse 200 of -VS is applied to the sustain electrode Ys.
      <br/>
      At the same time, an address pulse of -VA is applied to the address electrodes Ab.
      <br/>
      This causes a sustain discharge between the sustain electrodes X and Ys of the selected line.
      <br/>
      A discharge start voltage between the address electrodes Aj and the sustain electrodes Yi is Vfay, and the potential of the wall charges on the sustain electrode Ys side is Vwall2.
      <br/>
      The potential VA is set as follows:
      <br/>
      VA+VS+Vwall2&gt;Vfay&gt;VS   (3)
    </p>
    <p num="38">
      In connection with the cells to be turned OFF in the selected line, the address electrodes Ab and sustain electrode Ys cause the address discharge to excessively accumulate positive wall charges on the sustain electrode Ys side.
      <br/>
      The potential VA is so set that the wall charges themselves start a discharge between the sustain electrodes X and Yi after the address discharge when the sustain electrodes X and Ys and the address electrodes Ab are set to 0V.
      <br/>
      This self-erase discharge cannot eliminate the wall charges because the amount of the wall charge is insufficient and because the time since the application of the address pulse is insufficient.
      <br/>
      The remnant wall charges will cause no problem if they cause no sustain discharge when a sustain pulse is added to them.
    </p>
    <p num="39">
      The cells that have self-erase discharged never cause sustain discharge and are kept in an OFF state even if sustain pulses are alternately applied to the sustain electrodes X and Yi.
      <br/>
      In connection with the cells to be turned ON, an address pulse is applied to the address electrodes Aj.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, the sustain pulses repeatedly cause the sustain discharge to turn ON the cells.
    </p>
    <p num="40">
      FIG. 3 shows changing drive cycles in display lines.
      <br/>
      An abscissa indicates time and an ordinate indicates the display lines.
      <br/>
      In FIG. 3, reference mark W denotes a drive cycle for writing display data, S denotes a drive cycle for carrying out sustain discharge in the present field, and s denotes a drive cycle for carrying out sustain discharge in the preceding field.
    </p>
    <p num="41">
      FIG. 4 shows a sub-field of voltage waveforms applied to the electrodes according to a second prior art for driving the PDP.
      <br/>
      In FIG. 4, (i), (ii), (iii), (iv), (v) and (vi) are waveforms of address electrodes Aj, sustain electrodes X, sustain electrode Y1, sustain electrode Y2, sustain electrode Y3 and sustain electrode Yn, respectively.
      <br/>
      Also, in FIG. 4, "W" corresponds to a total write discharge, "S" corresponds to a sustain discharge, and "C" corresponds to a partial erase discharge.
    </p>
    <p num="42">
      This driving method employs a separate address-sustain discharge self-erase addressing method.
      <br/>
      Each sub-field involves a reset period in which a small quantity of wall charge is left in every cell, an address period in which address discharge is to accumulate wall charges to be used by the sustain discharge carried out afterward in pixels (cells) to be turned ON, and a sustain discharge period in which sustain pulses are added to the wall charges to cause sustain discharge only in the cells that have previously caused the address discharge.
    </p>
    <p num="43">
      First, during the reset period, the sustain electrodes Y1 to Yn are set to 0V, and a write pulse of VS+VW is applied to the sustain electrodes X. The potential VW is determined to satisfy the above equation (1).
      <br/>
      The sustain electrodes X and Y1 to Yn cause total write discharge W.
    </p>
    <p num="44">
      Next, the sustain electrodes X are set to 0V, and a sustain pulse of VS is applied to the sustain electrodes Y1 to Yn.
      <br/>
      The potential VS is determined to satisfy the above equation (2).
      <br/>
      The sustain electrodes X and Y1 to Yn cause total sustain discharge S.
    </p>
    <p num="45">
      Further, the sustain electrodes Y1 to Yn are set to 0V, and an erase pulse 202 of lower than the potential VS is applied to the sustain electrodes X. At the same time, an address pulse 204 of -VS is applied to the address electrodes Ab, to partly neutralize and reduce the wall charges.
      <br/>
      This results in leaving negative wall charges on the sustain electrodes Y1 to Yn.
      <br/>
      These remnant wall charges are used to cause the next address discharge with low potential VA.
      <br/>
      The quantity of the wall charges is determined so that the cells that have caused no address charge during the address period never cause sustain discharge in response to sustain pulses during the sustain discharge period.
    </p>
    <p num="46">Then, the address period starts.</p>
    <p num="47">First, the sustain electrodes X and Y1 to Yn are set to potential VS.</p>
    <p num="48">
      Next, the sustain electrode Y1 is selected.
      <br/>
      Namely, a scan pulse 206 is applied only to the sustain electrode Y1 among the electrodes Y1 to Yn.
      <br/>
      At the same time, an address pulse of VA is applied to the address electrodes Aa corresponding to the cells to be turned ON in the selected line, to cause write discharge in the cells.
      <br/>
      Then, the sustain discharge period starts.
    </p>
    <p num="49">Further, the sustain electrodes Y1 to Yn are provided with the same voltage waveform, and sustain pulses 208 are alternately applied to the sustain electrodes X and Y, to turn ON the cells to which data have been written in the address period.</p>
    <p num="50">
      The driving method of FIG. 4 makes wall charges remain during the reset period, to decrease the address discharge.
      <br/>
      Fluctuations in the remnant wall charges narrow the range of the potential VA for securing the stable operation of the PDP under various conditions.
      <br/>
      The fluctuations also change an optimum value of the potential VA, to destabilize the operation of the PDP or lower the display quality thereof.
      <br/>
      The remnant wall charges fluctuate due to the following reasons.
    </p>
    <p num="51">
      First, the wall charges formed by the total write discharge are dependent on an ON state of the preceding sub-field.
      <br/>
      Next, the impedance of drive circuits including the electrodes of the PDP fluctuate depending on temperature and vary the discharge characteristics.
      <br/>
      Further, the discharge characteristics of the cells are dependent on temperature.
    </p>
    <p num="52">The driving method of FIG. 2 accumulates wall charges on the sustain electrodes X and Ys before the address discharge, to cause the same problem as mentioned above.</p>
    <p num="53">Further, the driving method of FIG. 4 determines luminance according to the length of the sustain discharge period, i.e., the number of the sustain pulses.</p>
    <p num="54">
      In FIG. 4, a frame is divided into eight sub-fields SF1 to SF8.
      <br/>
      The ratio of the sustain discharge periods of the sub-fields SF1 to SF8 is 1:2:4:8:16:32:64:128 to realize 256 shades of gray.
    </p>
    <p num="55">
      If a screen is written at 60 Hz, a frame will last for 16.6 microseconds.
      <br/>
      If one frame involves 510 sustain discharge cycles (each with two times of discharge), the numbers of sustain discharge cycles in the sub-fields SF1 to SF8 are 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, and 256, respectively.
      <br/>
      If the period of the sustain discharge is eight microseconds, the total sustain discharge period in one frame will be 4.08 microseconds.
      <br/>
      If each sub-field includes a reset period of about 50 microseconds, one address cycle will be 3 microseconds for driving the PDP of 500 lines.
    </p>
    <p num="56">
      It is important to carry out two to three times of discharge (three discharge cycles) in the reset period, to uniformly distribute wall charges and secure stable operation.
      <br/>
      This discharge, however, produces light even when displaying black and reduces contrast.
      <br/>
      According to the driving methods of FIGS. 4 and 5, the number of sustain discharge operations in one frame is, for example, 510 * 2=1020 (which is a relative value).
      <br/>
      A reset period in one sub-field involves three times of discharge, i.e., the total write discharge, sustain discharge, and erase discharge.
      <br/>
      Also, in FIG. 5, the respective address lines are denoted as 1 through N.
    </p>
    <p num="57">
      These discharge operations are stronger than the sustain discharge carried out in the sustain discharge period.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, the brightness due to the three times of discharge is about five times of that of normal sustain discharge.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, the ratio of the maximum luminance and the minimum luminance, i.e., the luminance of black is 1020:5 * 8=26:1.
    </p>
    <p num="58">
      This ratio is in a dark room.
      <br/>
      In a lighted room, the surface reflection of the PDP deteriorates contrast.
      <br/>
      This means that there is no reason to display many shades of gray.
      <br/>
      Since the quality of black is an important factor for the display quality of images, the contrast must be secured.
    </p>
    <p num="59">
      The driving method of FIG. 2 achieves, on every cell in a selected line, three times of discharge, i.e., the write discharge W, the next sustain discharge S, and sustain discharge S carried out in parallel with the address discharge even on cells to be turned OFF.
      <br/>
      These discharge operations deteriorate the ratio of the maximum luminance and the minimum luminance for black, similar to the previous case.

    <p num="60">Next, the principle of the present invention will be explained.</p>

    <p num="62">
      In a first invention, the surface discharge plasma display panel has first and second electrodes arranged on a first substrate, and the first and second electrodes run in parallel with each other and are paired for respective display lines.
      <br/>
      A second substrate is spaced apart from and faces the first substrate, and third electrodes Aj are arranged on the first or second substrate.
      <br/>
      The third electrodes (Aj) are arranged away from the first and second electrodes and orthogonal thereto, and the surfaces of the first and second electrodes are covered with a wall charge accumulating dielectric layer.
      <br/>
      A phosphor is formed over the second substrate, and a cavity defined between the first and second substrates seals a discharge gas.
      <br/>
      Intersections where the first and second electrodes cross the third electrodes Aj form cells, respectively.
    </p>
    <p num="63">
      In this first invention, a reset step is carried out to apply a pulse of first voltage to the paired first and second electrodes, to cause discharge between the electrodes so that charges are uniformly distributed over the dielectric layer.
      <br/>
      Further, a write step is carried out to apply a pulse of second voltage to the second and third electrodes corresponding to cells to be turned ON, to cause discharge between the electrodes so that predetermined quantities or more of first and second wall charges having opposite polarities are accumulated on the dielectric layer on the first (X) and second (Yi) electrodes, respectively, in the cells to be turned ON.
      <br/>
      Further, a sustain discharge step is carried out to apply an AC pulse of fourth voltage to the paired first and second electrodes so that the sum of a third voltage between the first and second wall charges and the fourth voltage having the same polarity as the third voltage exceeds a first discharge start voltage to turn ON the cells and so that the polarities of the first and second wall charges oppositely alternate at each discharge.
    </p>
    <p num="64">
      Note that these steps are repeated so that the polarity of the AC voltage pulse in the sustain discharge step may be opposite to the polarity of the pulse of first voltage in the reset step.
      <br/>
      As shown in FIGS. 7A to 7C, the pulse of first voltage is higher than the first discharge start voltage, and the third voltage caused by the discharge is higher than the first discharge start voltage.
      <br/>
      The first, second, and third electrodes have the same potential after the pulse of first voltage is applied.
      <br/>
      In FIG. 7A, (i) , (ii) and (iii) are waveforms of third electrodes Aj, first electrodes X and second electrodes Yi, respectively.
      <br/>
      In FIG. 7B, (i) , (ii) and (iii) are waveforms of third electrodes Aj, first electrodes X and second electrodes Yi, respectively.
      <br/>
      Similarly, in FIG. 7C, (i) , (ii) and (iii) are waveforms of third electrodes Aj, first electrodes X and second electrodes Yi, respectively.
    </p>
    <p num="65">
      In FIGS. 6A to 6F, the second electrodes Yi are formed on the second substrate.
      <br/>
      The present invention is applicable to a conventional structure in which the second electrodes Yi are formed on the first substrate on the second substrate side or on the opposite side with respect to the first and second electrodes X and Yi.
    </p>
    <p num="66">The reset step of the first invention will be explained with reference to FIGS. 6A to 6F and 7A to 7C.</p>
    <p num="67">
      First, as shown in FIG. 6A, in process (a), before the reset step (process (b)), the quantity of wall charges differ from cell to cell depending on the preceding displaying conditions.
      <br/>
      The preceding sustain step is completed so that a pulse of first voltage produced in the following process (b) is additive to the wall charges.
    </p>
    <p num="68">
      Next, as shown in FIG. 6B, in process (b), the pulse of first voltage is applied to the first and second electrodes X and Yi.
      <br/>
      This first voltage is higher than the first discharge start voltage between the first and second electrodes X and Yi, so that, even if there are no wall charges, large discharge compared with the discharge in the sustain discharge step occurs between these electrodes.
    </p>
    <p num="69">
      Further, as shown in FIG. 6C, in process (c), electrons and positive ions produced by the discharge are attracted by the first and second electrodes X and Yi whose polarities are opposite to those of the electrons and ions.
      <br/>
      The electrons and ions are accumulated on the dielectric layer 1, to form first wall charges on the first electrode X and second wall charges on the second electrode Yi.
      <br/>
      These wall charges reduce the strength of an electric field in the discharge cavity, so that the discharge quickly ends within one to several microseconds.
    </p>
    <p num="70">
      Next, as shown in FIG. 6D, in process (d), the pulse of first voltage is so set that the third voltage between the first and second wall charges is higher than the first discharge start voltage.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, strong discharge compared with the discharge in the sustain discharge step is again caused.
    </p>
    <p num="71">
      Further, as shown in FIG. 6E, in process (e), due to this strong discharge and due to the fact that the first, second, and third electrodes have the same potential, substantially no wall charges are accumulated, and space charges are almost completely neutralized.
      <br/>
      This sort of self-erase discharge will never be caused by the sustain discharge even if the first, second, and third electrodes have the same potential.
    </p>
    <p num="72">
      Furthermore, as shown in FIG. 6F, in process (f), the cavity will contain some space charges that have not been recombined.
      <br/>
      These space charges serve as a pilot for easily causing discharge in the next address discharge period.
      <br/>
      A wait time required for almost completing the self-erase discharge is about five microseconds or more, although it is dependent on the material and size of the cells and the kind and concentration of the sealed gas.
      <br/>
      If the wait time is too long, time for other processes will be shortened and the priming effect will be reduced.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, the wait time must be shorter than 50 microseconds.
    </p>
    <p num="73">
      The first invention carries out the self-erase discharge to almost completely neutralize the wall charges, and to equalize conditions around the first and second electrodes when writing data in cells to be turned ON.
      <br/>
      This results in expanding the range of the second voltage in the write step, to always achieve stable address discharge with no regard to the distribution conditions of charges before the write discharge onto fluctuations in temperature.
      <br/>
      The first invention prevents write errors and improves the display quality of the PDP.
    </p>
    <p num="74">
      For cells to be turned OFF, no discharge is carried out between the first and second electrodes.
      <br/>
      This results in improving the ratio of the maximum luminance and the minimum luminance for displaying black as well as the display quality of shades of gray compared with the prior art.
    </p>
    <p num="75">Note that the potential of the third electrodes Aj is about the average of the potential of the first and second electrodes X and Yi while the pulse of first voltage is being applied, as shown in FIGS. 7A to 7C.</p>
    <p num="76">
      Further, the voltage of the third electrodes Aj with respect to the first electrodes X and the voltage of the third electrodes Aj with respect to the second electrodes Yj have substantially the same absolute value and opposite signs.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, the third electrodes Aj produce substantially the same attractive force on positive and negative charges, and therefore, the positive and negative charges are neutralized on the third electrodes Aj.
      <br/>
      As a result, substantially no wall charges are accumulated on the third electrodes Aj, to thereby improve the effect of the first invention.
    </p>
    <p num="77">In addition, the pulse of first voltage is generated by setting the second electrodes Yi to a ground level and by applying a pulse of positive voltage to the first electrodes X, as shown in FIG. 7A. This configuration requires no negative high voltage pulse, so that a simple, compact, inexpensive power source is employable for the PDP drive circuit.</p>
    <p num="78">Further, the potential of the third electrodes Aj is kept at a ground level during the application of the pulse of first voltage, as shown in FIG. 7B. This configuration is capable of reducing the power source requirements.</p>
    <p num="79">Furthermore, the potential of the first, second, and third electrodes X, Yi, and Aj are kept at a ground level before and after the application of the pulse of first voltage, as shown in FIGS. 7A to 7C.</p>
    <p num="80">Below, the preferred embodiments of a method and an apparatus for driving a surface discharge plasma display panel according to the present invention will be explained, with reference to the accompanying drawings.</p>
    <p num="81">
      A plasma display panel (PDP) to which the following embodiments are applicable has a cell structure as shown in FIG. 1A. A selected one of the sustain electrodes Yi is represented with Ys and the remaining unselected electrodes by Yt.

      A line of cells corresponding to the sustain electrode Ys is called a selected line, and a line of cells including one of the sustain electrodes Yt is called an unselected line.
      <br/>
      In the selected line, those of the address electrodes Aj corresponding to cells to be turned ON are represented with Aa and those to be turned OFF with Ab.

    <p num="82">
      FIG. 8 shows a drive cycle of voltage waveforms applied to the electrodes according to a PDP driving method based on a first embodiment of the present invention.
      <br/>
      In FIG. 8, (i) , (ii), (iii) and (iv) are waveforms of address electrodes Aj, sustain electrodes X, selected sustain electrode Ys and unselected sustain electrode Yt, respectively.
      <br/>
      In FIG. 8, reference mark W denotes a write discharge in all cells in a selected line (total write discharge), C denotes a self-erase discharge in all cells in the selected line (total self-erase discharge), A denotes write address discharge in specified cells in the selected line, and S denotes a sustain discharge.
      <br/>
      Note that the method of this first embodiment is a line-by-line write address method, and thus the sustain electrodes Yi are sequentially selected from Y1 to Yn.
    </p>
    <p num="83">Note that, references 1-a to 1-e, 2-a to 2-f, 3-a to 3-e, and 4-a to 4-e denote processes.</p>
    <p num="84">
      (1-a) First, the address electrodes Aj and sustain electrodes Yt are set to 0V, and a write pulse 210 of Vw is applied to the sustain electrodes X. At the same time, a pulse of -Vs is applied to the sustain electrode Ys.
      <br/>
      Before this process (1-a), i.e., in the last stage of a drive cycle of FIG. 8, zero or positive wall charges are accumulated on the electrodes X, and zero or negative wall charges are accumulated on the sustain electrode Ys.
      <br/>
      This is done by oppositely setting the polarity of the write pulse and the polarity of the last sustain pulse in the drive cycle.
    </p>
    <p num="85">
      The potential values Vw and Vs are set as follows:
      <br/>
      Vw+Vs&gt;=Vf   (4)
    </p>
    <p num="86">
      Accordingly, write discharge W is caused between the sustain electrodes X and Ys in all cells in the selected line.
      <br/>
      For example, Vw=130V, Vs=180V, and Vf=290V.
      <br/>
      Since the voltage Vw+Vs of the write pulse is sufficiently greater than the voltage Vs of the sustain pulse, strong discharge compared with sustain discharge occurs.
      <br/>
      As the discharge progresses, negative wall charges accumulate on the sustain electrode X side and positive wall charges on the sustain electrode Ys side.
      <br/>
      These wall charges reduce the strength of an electric field in the discharge cavity, so that the discharge ends within one to several microseconds.
      <br/>
      The voltage of the wall charges when the discharge ends is Vwall3.
      <br/>
      The potential Vw is set such that the voltage Vwall3 satisfies the following:
      <br/>
      Vwall3&gt;Vf   (5)
    </p>
    <p num="87">
      (1-b) Next, the sustain electrodes X and Ys are simultaneously returned to 0V.
      <br/>
      According to the equation (5), a voltage between the wall charges on the sustain electrode X side and the wall charges on the sustain electrode Yi side causes self-erase discharge C. Since the potential differences of the sustain electrode X, sustain electrode Ys, and address electrodes Aj are each 0V and since the magnitude of the discharge is large, space charges produced by the discharge do not accumulate (theoretically zero) as wall charges on the sustain electrodes X and Ys and address electrodes Aj.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, the space charges recombine in the discharge cavity and are nearly completely neutralized.
      <br/>
      The cavity may contain a small quantity of charges that have not recombined.
      <br/>
      These space charges serve as a pilot to easily cause the next address discharge.
      <br/>
      This is called a priming effect.
    </p>
    <p num="88">A wait time required for nearly completing the self-erase discharge is about 5 to 50 microseconds, e.g., 20 microseconds after the fall of the write pulse, although it depends on the material and size of the cells and the kind and concentration of the sealed gas.</p>

      (1-c) Further, the sustain electrodes X and Yt and address electrodes Ab are set to 0V, a pulse of -Vs is applied to the sustain electrode Ys, and an address pulse 212 of Va is applied to the address electrodes Aa.
      <br/>
      The potential values Va and Vs are set as follows:
      <br/>
      Vsmin&lt;=Vs&lt;Vfxymin   (6)

      Va+Vs&gt;=Vfaymax   (7)

    <p num="91">
      For the cells to be turned ON, address discharge is caused between the address electrodes Aa and the sustain electrode Ys.
      <br/>
      This discharge triggers discharge between the sustain electrodes X and Ys.
      <br/>
      Unlike the prior art of FIG. 2, negative and positive wall charges accumulate on the sustain electrodes X and Ys, respectively, so that sustain discharge pulses to be applied can cause sustain discharge.
      <br/>

      <br/>
      This results in expanding the range of the potential Va, always carrying out stable address discharge with no regard to the distribution of charges before the write discharge or changes in temperature, preventing write errors, and improving the display quality of the PDP.

    <p num="95">
      Further, unlike the prior art of FIG. 2, no discharge occurs between the sustain electrodes X and Ys in the cells to be turned OFF in the process (1-c), so that the number of light emitting discharge operations carried out in all cells in the selected line is two in the write cycle, which is 2/3 of the operations used in the prior art.

      Further, each sub-field is made of a reset period for nearly completely erasing wall charges in all cells, an address period for carrying out address discharge to accumulate wall charges in cells to be turned ON, to enable the following sustain discharge, and a sustain discharge period for adding a sustain pulse to the wall charges to cause sustain discharge only in the cells in which the address discharge has occurred.

      <br/>
      Before the process (2-a), i.e., in the last stage of the sub-field of FIG. 9, the polarity of a sustain pulse applied to the sustain electrodes is opposite to that of the write pulse.

      The reason why the potential of the write pulse 222 is the sum of Vs and Vw is because a power source for the potential Vs is also used for providing a sustain pulse.

      Then, the attractive force of the address electrodes A1 to Am on positive charges will be equal to that on negative charges, and therefore, positive and negative charges on the address electrodes A1 to Am are neutralized.

      As a result, substantially no wall charges accumulate on the address electrodes A1 to Am.
      <br/>
      On the other hand, the potential Vaw must be low to allow a compact power source circuit.

      <br/>
      The reason why the unselected sustain electrodes Y2 to Yn are set to -Vsc is to lower the potential Va and reduce power consumption.

      <br/>
      The quantities of the wall charges are sufficient to cause sustain discharge in response to a sustain discharge pulse to be applied later.

      A preferable value of the potential Vax will be explained.
      <br/>
      It is preferable to reduce the load on an address driver involving a relatively large number of switching operations as much as possible, to reduce total power consumption.
      <br/>
      Namely, it is required to reduce the potential Va applied to the address electrodes within the limit defined by the equation (7A).
      <br/>
      In consideration of the mechanism that discharge between the address electrodes Aa and the sustain electrode Ys triggers discharge between the sustain electrodes X and Ys, to accumulate wall charges required for sustain discharge, the voltage Vax+Vy between the sustain electrodes X and Ys may be increased under the restriction of the equation (6A), to lower the potential Va.

      <br/>
      Then, the sustain discharge will not occur between the sustain electrodes X and Y1 to Yn.
      <br/>
      To prevent this, the positive voltage (potential Vs/2) is applied to the address electrodes Al to Am, to cancel an electric field produced by the negative wall charges on the address electrodes A1 to Am.
