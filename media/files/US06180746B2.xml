      Field of the Invention
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      The present invention relates generally to polyimides.
      <br/>
      It relates in particular to a polyimide precursor solid residuum, which is effectively employed in the preparation of polyimide foam and the fabrication of polyimide foam structures.
    </p>
    <p num="5">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
    <p num="6">
      High performance polyimides are presently used in the aerospace industry, for example, in joining metals to metals, or metals to composite structures.
      <br/>
      In addition, polyimides are rapidly finding new uses as foam insulation in cryogenic applications, and as structural foam having increased structural stiffness without large weight increases, in aerospace structures.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      Polyimide foam materials have a number of beneficial attributes for next generation space vehicles, such as high temperature and solvent resistance, flame resistance, low smoke generation, high modulus and chemical and hot water resistance.
      <br/>
      Another area for polyimide foams is in the manufacture of low density insulation for thermal and acoustic applications, and reinforcement for the maritime industry.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,147,966 and 5,478,916 disclose polyimides that can be melt processed into various useful forms such as coatings, adhesives, composite matrix resins and films.
      <br/>
      These polyimides are prepared from various diamines and dianhydrides in various solvents.
      <br/>
      The use of monoanhydrides as endcapping agents is also disclosed in these patents to control the molecular weight of the polymers and, in turn, to make them easier to process in molten form.
      <br/>
      The use of ethers to make polyimide adhesives was disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,065,345, which demonstrates another method to produce polyimide resin systems.
      <br/>
      FIG. 1 shows the method employed by these patents to produce polyimides.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      U.S. Pat. No. 3,483,144 discloses a process for making polyimide foam by ball milling a mixture of monomers and heating the mixture to 300 (degree)  C. In all cases, the foams produced by this patent are the result of dianhydricles or tetraacids being dissolved by a diamine upon melting.
      <br/>
      The ensuing reaction produces water and thus foams the molten material.
      <br/>
      FIG. 2 illustrates the process to make foam by this patent.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      The state-of-the-art technology for making polyimide foams as disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,298,531, 5,122,546, 5,077,318, and 4,900,761 utilizes solutions of diamines and dianhydride derivatives in a low molecular weight alkyl alcohol solvent.
      <br/>
      Polyimide precursor solutions and powders therefrom are then processed into foams through the expulsion of water and alcohol (R-OH) during the thermal imidization process.
      <br/>
      In these cases the alcohol solvent reacts initially with the dianhydride to form a covalently bonded specie referred to as a dialkylester-diacid (DADA) before the aromatic diamine is added.
      <br/>
      The aforementioned patents also illustrate the use of blowing agents to aid in the foaming process.
      <br/>
      The blowing agents utilized by these patents serve as a separate entity and usually result in a foam that has residual blowing agent within its cell walls.
      <br/>
      FIG. 3 demonstrates the state-of-the-art in this foam technology.
    </p>
    <p num="11">
      Howsoever useful, these related art processes for preparing foams from polyimide precursors are all found wanting, in that none provide foam densities over a wide range.
      <br/>
      Indeed, many commercially-available polyimide foams are made by employing an added step of densifying a low density foam to produce a foam of desired higher density.
      <br/>
      Moreover, in many of these related art processes undesirably high foaming temperatures are required, because the foaming agents are volatile by-products generated in the polycondensation reaction.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, many of these related art processes do not provide for uniformity in the blowing of the foam, and they result in non-uniformity of the foamed product.
      <br/>
      In particular, many of these foaming processes start out slowly, build tip to a maximum, and then taper off toward the end.
      <br/>
      The foamed products produced often exhibit non-uniformity of density and cell size throughout the foamed structure, which results in low yields of acceptable product.
      <br/>
      Additionally, some of the polyimide precursors employed in these related art processes (especially those involving isocyanate chemistry) have poor hydrolytic stability and poor stability toward other types of decomposition.
    </p>

    <heading>DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
    <p num="30">
      According to the present invention, a polyimide precursor solid residuum was fonned from the reaction of a dianhydride dispensed in a mixture of ethers and various alkyl alcohols at room temperature.
      <br/>
      See FIG. 4 for a representation of an ether stabilizing unit, according to the present invention.
      <br/>
      This suspension was treated at 70 (degree)  C. for 6 hours in order to convert the dianhydride into a DADA complexed with ether by hydrogen bonding.
      <br/>
      This hydrogen bonding occurs between the ether oxygen and the acid protons.
      <br/>
      The resulting solution, DADA with hydrogen bonded ether was mixed with a diamine and stirred for 2 hours to yield a homogeneous polyimide precursor solution. (Likewise, similar polyimide foam precursors were formed from tetracarboxylic acid forms (TA) of the dianhydrides and diamines mixed in various ethers and alkyl alcohols.) The solution was then charged into a stainless-steel vat and treated at 70 (degree)  C. for 14 hours in order to evaporate excess solvents (ether and alkyl alcohol).
      <br/>
      The resulting material was allowed to cool and then crushed into a fine powder (.about.2 to .about.200  MU m).
      <br/>
      The powder was then heated to a temperature to allow foaming and imidization of the foam.
      <br/>
      The presence of the ether complex stabilizes the monomeric reactants and prevents chain growth and imidization until an optimum temperature and melt viscosity are reached for foaming.
      <br/>
      This temperature generally exceeds the temperature required for the onset of foaming used in the preparation of state-of-the-art foams.
      <br/>
      However, the hydrogen bonding that does occur between the ether and the DADA or TA/diamine salts causes the ether/blowing agent to be homogeneously distributed and thus an excellent and uniform cellular structure is obtained.
      <br/>
      FIG. 5 illustrates a foaming process employing a polyimide precursor solid residuum which is complexed with an ether according to the present invention.
    </p>
    <p num="31">
      The need to transform high temperature polyimides into high quality, low density foams is apparent.
      <br/>
      Foams of various densities, strengths, and thermal properties are now being required for future reusable launch vehicles, maritime ships, and commercial aeronautics applications.
      <br/>
      The present invention affords a technology capable of reproducible producing high quality foams of various chemical make-ups, densities, thermal properties, and strengths, by utilizing the effects of hydrogen bonding of an ether with a DADA in a mixture with diamines.

      1. 756 g (2.4 mol) of ODPA was dispersed in a mixture of 480 g of THF and 280 g of MeOH at room temperature.
      <br/>
      This solution was treated at 70 (degree)  C. for 6 hours in order to convert the ODPA into ODP-DADA complexed with THF by hydrogen bonding. 488 g (2.4 mol) of 3,4'ODA was added to the resulting solution of ODPA-DADA and stirred for 2 hours to yield a homogeneous polyimide precursor solution.
      <br/>
      The resulting polyimide precursor solution had a solids content of 70 wt % and a viscosity of 20 poise at 20 (degree)  C. The solution was then charged into a stainless-steel vat and treated at 70 (degree)  C. for 14 hours in order to evaporate off the solvent (THF and MeOH).
      <br/>
      The resulting material was allowed to cool and crushed into a fine powder (2 to 500  MU m). (These powders are sieved using a mesh, if needed.) The polyimide precursor solid residuum was then treated for an additional amount of time (0 to 300 minutes) at 80 (degree)  C. to further reduce the residual solvents to around 1-10 wt % depending on the final foam density desired.
      <br/>
      Residual amounts of THF were determined by measuring proton NMR spectra of the powders.

    <p num="75">Comparative Examples</p>
    <p num="76">
      The following examples, which do not exemplify the polyimide precursor solid residuum of the present invention, are set forth for comparative purposes, as they are characteristic of the related art.
      <br/>
      1. Into a reaction flask fitted with a mechanical stirrer were charged 20.4 g (0.057 mol) of BTDA-TA, 11.8 g (0.057 mol) of 4,4'ODA, and 75 g of THF.
      <br/>
      Stirring was begun and continued for 24 hours at ambient temperature.
      <br/>
      Thereafter, the resulting slurry (Solid contents: 30 wt %) was charged into a stainless-steel vat and air-dried at ambient temperature for 6 hours in order to drive off an excess amount of THF.
      <br/>
      As a result, dried powders, which showed no-tackiness, were obtained.
      <br/>
      THF content of the resulting powder was 1.9 wt %. This powder did not foam when the expandability was measured according to Example 35 above.
      <br/>
      2. The procedure of Comparative Example 1 was repeated except that m-PDA (0.057 mol) and dioxane were used in replacement of 4,4'ODA and THF, respectively.
      <br/>
      Dried powders, which showed no-tackiness, were obtained as in the case of Comparative Example 1.
      <br/>
      Dioxane content of the resulting powder was 1.6 wt %. This powder did not foam as was the case in comparative example 1.
      <br/>
      3. 19.7 g (0.057 mol) of ODPA-TA and 11.8 g (0.057 mol) of 3,4'ODA were dissolved into 46.0 g and 27.5 g of MeOH, respectively.
      <br/>
      The resulting two uniform solutions (30 wt %--solids each) were added together and mixed under mechanical stirring at ambient temperature.
      <br/>
      During stirring for 10 min. the solution changed to a heterogeneous suspension.
      <br/>
      The stirring was continued for 24 hours at ambient temperature.
      <br/>
      Thereafter, the resulting slurry (solid contents: 30 wt %) was filtered to produce a wet cake.
      <br/>
      The obtained wet cake was dried for 2 hours at 60 (degree)  C. to produce quantitatively a salt-like powder consisting of equimolar amounts of ODPA-TA and 3,4'ODA and no residual MeOH.
      <br/>
      This was confirmed by NMR measurements. 8 g of the powder was wetted by 2 g of THF, and the resulting mixture was air-dried for 2 hours.
      <br/>
      THF content of the resulting powder was 2.5 wt %. This powder did not foam when the expandability was measured according to Example 35 above.
