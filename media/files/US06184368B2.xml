      Methods for syntheses of polyvalent carbohydrate molecules by glycosylations of partially protected polysaccharides with a single glycosylating agent or a mixture of glycosylating agents(i.e., a combinatorial library) are disclosed.

      An alternate method utilizes a glycoside, the aglycon of which carries a halogen which can be under strong alkaline conditions linked with a partially protected polysaccharide by an ether linkage.

      The product of the latter reaction can be subjected to further glycosylation with a single glycosylating agent or a mixture of such agents (=library).
      <br/>
      The novel resulting polyvalent carbohydrate molecules may be used as antiinfective agents (antibacterial, antiparasital), both for prevention and treatment of diseases, and as agents either for preventing the formation of, or disrupting, biofilms.

    <heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">
      This invention relates to the preparation of novel polyvalent carbohydrate molecules, including polyvalent oligosaccharide molecules by linking a carbohydrate or a combinatorial carbohydrate library to a suitable matrix.
      <br/>
      Combinatorial carbohydrate libraries may be obtained using polymer-supported as well as classical solution methodologies, which may be further transformed into glycosylating agents.
      <br/>
      The glycosylating agents are then linked to a high-molecular weight matrix to produce, after deprotection, polyvalent hydrocarbon molecules in excellent yields.
      <br/>
      The matrices do not elicit any immunologic or allergic reactions in human or animal recipients.
      <br/>
      Such polyvalent molecules prevent infections caused by bacterial colonization, and hence may be used in foods, for example, in infant formulae and young children's foods to decrease the chance of contracting infectious diseases, in oral hygiene products, and in other products, such as disinfectants, cleansers, soaps, deodorants, ear drops and nasal sprays.
    </p>
    <p num="3">
      The polyvalent carbohydrate molecules may be further used in the treatment of bacterial infections, as they are not expected to cause drug resistance.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, such carbohydrate polyvalent molecules, by virtue of their strong adherence to sites that bind carbohydrates, will disrupt biofilms or prevent biofilm formation and therefore have applications wherever biofilms are involved.
    </p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="4">
      Oligosaccharides occurring naturally in glycolipids, glycoproteins and proteoglycans have been ascribed a variety of functions in biological systems (see Varki, A. Glycobiology 3, 97(1993)).
      <br/>
      Although the universality of these functions is unknown at this point in time, there are properties of oligosaccharides which make them of immediate practical importance because oftheir possible use as human therapeutics and, particularly important, as preventive agents of human infections.
      <br/>
      For prevention purposes, these polyvalent carbohydrate molecules can be used as food additives, dental cleansers, mouthwashes, eardrops, ointments, and similar agents.
      <br/>
      Infections caused by colonization mediated by adherence to tissues through carbohydrate substrate binding are targets of these preventive agents.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      As an example, such adherence is the adhesion of pathogens to human epithelia through the binding of pathogens to epithelial cells by bacterial or parasital adhesins.
      <br/>
      Adhesins are proteins showing specific binding affinity to oligosaccharide (carbohydrate) moieties of glycolipids and glycoproteins displayed on epithelial cells in colonized tissues.
      <br/>
      Since the attachment to host cells is the initial event of the infectious process, interference with binding by oligosaccharides mimicking the oligosaccharide moieties of glycolipids or glycoproteins prevents (see Zopf, D., Roth, S. Lancet 347, 1017 (1996)) or reduces the infection.
      <br/>
      Such attachment also occurs when the carbohydrate is located on the pathogen and therefore the binding to the host's proteins is mediated by this carbohydrate.
      <br/>
      Thus carbohydrates naturally occurring in human milk (see Anianson, G., Andersson, B., Lindstedt, R. &amp; Svanborg, C., Microbial Pathogenesis 8, 315) offer protection to infants against infections.
      <br/>
      Carbohydrates may, in addition to protection against infection, be utilized for treatment of infectious diseases that are increasingly more difficult to treat because of growing pathogen resistance to antibiotics and drugs.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      Since individual natural oligosaccharides usually bind to their accepting molecules weakly, individual oligosaccharides must be used in impracticably large quantities for an effective treatment.
      <br/>
      This problem is overcome in carbohydrate polyvalent molecules �see Zopf, D., Roth, S. Lancet 347, 1017 (1996)� since such molecules bind the accepting molecules through multiple contacts resulting in strong binding.
      <br/>
      These polyvalent molecules occupy the carbohydrate binding site tightly and the infectious process is thus interrupted.
      <br/>
      The combinatorial polyvaleni oligosaccharide molecule has a further advantage of making it possible to utilize the strongest binders and their combinations for a particular pathogenic bacterium without any prior knowledge of exact binding requirements of the particular microorganism.
      <br/>
      The matrix molecule should be a biocompatible material, not eliciting an immune response, suitable for the purpose, for instance a starch for infant foods or a gel-forming oligosaccharide such as a carrageenan for dental pastes, or a similar scaffold for disruption or removal of biofilms.
      <br/>
      However, all matrices can be considered for all applications.
      <br/>
      The biofilms are often responsible for infective properties of microorganisms, for failures of implanted bioengineering devices, as well as for malfunctions of engineering structures such as oil pipelines, and the water intakes of municipal water and industrial plants.
    </p>
    <heading>DESCRIPTION OF RELATED ART</heading>
    <p num="7">
      The polyvalent carbohydrate molecules are defined as glycosylated polysaccharides.
      <br/>
      Many methods for glycosylation of monosaccharides, oligosaccharides, and other small molecule aglycons are known in the art.
      <br/>
      The glycosyls should be spread along the polysaccharide chains with an average frequency of no more than one glycosyl per two monosaccharide units of the polymeric chain.
      <br/>
      The glycosyls are derived from oligosaccharides of general formula �monosaccharide�n, where n=1-5, both linear and branched.

    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="9">The present invention provides in one aspect a method for the preparation of polyvalent carbohydrate molecules which comprises:</p>
    <p num="10">
      a) reacting as a first reactant at least one carbohydrate having at least one monosaccharide unit with a second reactant which is a polysaccharide partially protected by protecting groups, and having at least one free hydroxyl group per two consecutive monosaccharide units of polymeric chain, to form a linkage between the free hydroxyl group of the polysaccharide derivative and an anomeric carbon of the carbohydrate;
      <br/>
      b) removing the protecting groups; and
      <br/>
      c) purifying the solid.
    </p>
    <p num="11">
      The present invention also provides a process for the preparation of polyvalent carbohydrates molecules which comprises the steps of
      <br/>
      a) forming a glycosylating agent from at least one carbohydrate or a library of carbohydrates equipped with a suitable leaving group at the anomeric carbon of the carbohydrate or a carbohydrate library;
      <br/>
      b) subjecting the glycosylating agent to a reaction with a polysaccharide partially protected with acyl protecting groups, the latterbeing synthesized from the polysaccharide by incomplete acylation or complete acylation and mild incomplete acyl hydrolysis, in which reaction a glycosidic linkage between the glycosylating agent and the partially protected polysaccharide is formed, which linkage cannot be severed under deprotecting conditions;
      <br/>
      c) removing all protecting groups; and
      <br/>
      d) purifying the polyvalent carbohydrate molecules.
    </p>
    <p num="12">
      Alternatively, a glycosyl can be linked to hydroxyl groups of a polysaccharide through a tether.
      <br/>
      For example, such a tether may be obtained by a procedure which comprises the steps of
      <br/>
      a) forming a glycosylating agent from at least one carbohydrate or a library of carbohydrates equipped with a suitable activating leaving group at the anomeric carbon of the carbohydrate or carbohydrate library;
      <br/>
      b) subjecting the glycosylating agent to a reaction with a non-geminal hydroxyhalogenoalkane which yields a glycoside of a halogenoalkane;
      <br/>
      c) subjecting the glycoside of halogenoalkane to a condensation reaction with a polysaccharide as such, or partially protected, under strong basic conditions, in which reaction an ether linkage between the linker bound to the glycosylating agent and the polysaccharide was formed, which linkage as well as the glycosidic bond cannot be severed during subsequent manipulations;
      <br/>
      d) removing all protecting groups;
      <br/>
      e) purifying the polyvalent carbohydrate molecules; and, if required
      <br/>
      f) subjecting such polyvalent molecules to additional glycosylations.
    </p>
    <p num="13">
      We have now found that glycosylations ofmatrices partially protected, preferably from 25 to 85% with selected protecting groups can be performed under liquid-phase chemistry conditions adapted to the limited solubility of the matrices.
      <br/>
      We have also found that suitable partial protection of the matrices such as water-insoluble starch is achieved under acylation conditions using acyl anhydride and the corresponding acid, or in two steps comprising exhaustive protection with acyl protecting groups such as, for example, acetyl groups followed by partial random removal of the protecting groups under the influence of a base.
      <br/>
      We have further found that the glycosylations are satisfactorily performed in solvents in which the partially protected matrix is soluble, preferably dipolar solvents, and most preferably solvents selected from the group consisting of dioxane, acetonitrile, and dimethylformamide.
      <br/>
      The progress of glycosylation can be monitored preferably by infrared and N.M.R. spectroscopies and gas-liquid chromatography of acid hydrolysates (alditol acetates) of polyvalent carbohydrate molecules.
    </p>
    <p num="14">
      These methods make it possible to synthesize novel solid water-soluble polyvalent carbohydrate molecules, the components of which are standard parts of numerous foods.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, polyvalent carbohydrate molecules are analogous to natural polyvalent glycosylated casein, a known provider of antiinfective protection for newborn and very small children (see Anianson, G., Andersson, B., Lindstedt, R. &amp; Svanborg, C., Microbial Pathogenesis 8, 315).
      <br/>
      The advantage of utilizing polysaccharides as the matrix instead of casein is that polysaccharides are completely devoid of any interference with the recipient's immune system.
    </p>
    <p num="15">
      These novel polyvalent carbohydrate molecules (PCM) are defined as substances prepared from starch from natural sources using glycosylation reactions and they are characterized by the presence ofpolymeric chains ofthe original starch on which carbohydrate molecules are grafted with frequencies of one carbohydrate per two monomer units of the polymer to one carbohydrate unit per fifty monomer units ofthe polymer.
      <br/>
      Carbohydrates may be either monosaccharides, single or in any combination, or oligosaccharides, single or in any combination, or a combination of monosaccharides and oligosaccharides.
      <br/>
      Such polyvalent carbohydrate molecules are water soluble irrespective of whether the original polymer was water soluble or insoluble.
    </p>
    <p num="16">
      The saccharide may be either an oligosaccharide formed from at least two monosaccharide units by definition, or a monosaccharide.
      <br/>
      The reducing monosaccharide unit of an oligosaccharide, or a monosaccharide, must be suitably derivatized so as to allow attachment of a leaving group or a derivative thereof.
      <br/>
      The saccharide must be capable of being elaborated into a substance which is suitable for subsequent glycosylation.
      <br/>
      The glycosylation is performed under standard liquid-phase chemistry conditions that are well known in the art and are, of course, dependent upon the monosaccharide units and their associated linkages, and upon the nature ofprotecting groups.
      <br/>
      The protecting groups are those which would be suitable for the defined purposes and may preferably be selected from C2 -C7 acyl groups such as acetyl, ketoacetyl such as levulinyl, branched chain acyls such as pivaloyl, and aromatic acyls such as benzoyl.
      <br/>
      Such groups may be removed by treatment with basic reagents, and the product purified by precipitation with solvents, preferably certain water-miscible organic solvents.
      <br/>
      In all other aspects the conditions of reactions performed follow established protocols from solution chemistry.
      <br/>
      References to these protocols are described earlier.
      <br/>
      Solution chemistry protocols that may be established in the future, and protocols employing enzymes, will be applicable as well.
    </p>
    <p num="17">
      Monitoring the glycosylation reaction has been found to be easily achieved, preferably through infrared or N.M.R. spectrometry, or by gas-liquid chromatography of alditol acetates obtained after acid hydrolysis ofthe product of glycosylation.
      <br/>
      The deprotection ofthe product depends on the protecting groups utilized and methods of deprotection are well known in the art.
      <br/>
      Typically this is achieved by treatment with basic reagents.
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      The polyvalent carbohydrate molecules may be used in many applications which comprise food components boosting prevention of bacterial infections (e.g., infant formulas and young children's foods), in oral hygiene products, in remedies for illnesses caused by bacterial infections and requiring treatment with less toxic agents than presently available, such as early childhood Otitis media, in products disrupting biofilms or to prevent biofilm formation, in glycotherapeutics for diseases untreatable with conventional means such as cancer, arthritis, and cystic fibrosis.
      <br/>
      Utilities are not limited to the above applications.
    </p>
    <heading>DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
    <p num="19">
      In order that the invention may be better understood, embodiments will now be described by way of example only, with reference to the accompanying reaction schemes.
      <br/>
      In one preferred form ofthe invention, single glycosyl or a library of glycosyls may be randomly (but reproducibly) linked to different polysaccharide hydroxyl groups through glycosidic linkages.
    </p>
    <p num="20">
      Glycosylation conditions are well known in the art and they may be selected from any of those described in the subsequent examples.
      <br/>
      Such reactions give good anomeric specificity when glycosylating agents are equipped with a participating group, usually an adjacent functional group that controls the stereochemical outcome ofthe reaction.
      <br/>
      Preferred examples of such a participating group include an ester group, such as an acetyl and a benzoyl group, and amidic groups such as acetamido groups.
      <br/>
      After the reaction is completed, which reaction can be monitored by thin layer chromatography, and then neutralized, the solvent is evaporated in vacuo to dryness and purified by trituration with ethanol to remove residual reagents and solvents from the glycosylated, partially protected polymer.
      <br/>
      All hydroxyl groups of the glycosylating agents are protected with protecting groups which may preferably be selected from C2 -C7 acyl groups such as acetyl, ketoacetyl, such as levulinyl, branched acyl chains such as pivaloyl, and aromatic acyls such as benzoyl.
      <br/>
      Such groups may be removed by treatment with basic reagents, and purified by precipitation with certain water-miscible organic solvents.
      <br/>
      In all other aspects the conditions of reactions performed follow established protocols from classical solution chemistry.
      <br/>
      References to these protocols are described earlier.
      <br/>
      Solution chemistry protocols that may be established in the future, and protocols employing enzymes, will be applicable as well.
