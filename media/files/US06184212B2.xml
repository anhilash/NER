    <heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">
      This invention relates to compositions and methods for modulating expression of the human mdm2 gene, a naturally present cellular gene implicated in abnormal cell proliferation and tumor formation.
      <br/>
      This invention is also directed to methods for inhibiting hyperproliferation of cells; these methods can be used diagnostically or therapeutically.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, this invention is directed to treatment of conditions associated with expression of the human mdm2 gene.
    </p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="3">
      Inactivation of tumor suppressor genes leads to unregulated cell proliferation and is a cause of tumorigenesis.
      <br/>
      In many tumors, the tumor suppressors, p53 or Rb (retinoblastoma) are inactivated.
      <br/>
      This can occur either by mutations within these genes, or by overexpression of the mdm2 gene.
      <br/>
      The mdm2 protein physically associates with both p53 and Rb, inhibiting their function.
      <br/>
      The levels of mdm2 are maintained through a feedback loop mechanism with p53.
      <br/>
      Overexpression of mdm2 effectively inactivates p53 and promotes cell proliferation.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      The role of p53 in apoptosis and tumorigenesis is well-known in the art (see, in general, Canman, C. E. and Kastan, M. B., Adv. Pharmacol., 1997, 41, 429-460).
      <br/>
      Mdm2 has been shown to regulate p53's apoptotic functions (Chen, J., et al., Mol. Cell Biol., 1996, 16, 2445-2452; Haupt, Y., et al., EMBO J., 1996, 15, 1596-1606).
      <br/>
      Overexpression of mdm2 protects tumor cells from p53-mediated apoptosis.
      <br/>
      Thus, mdm2 is an attractive target for cancers associated with altered p53 expression.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      Amplification of the mdm2 gene is found in many human cancers, including soft tissue sarcomas, astrocytomas, glioblastomas, breast cancers and non-small cell lung carcinomas.
      <br/>
      In many blood cancers, overexpression of mdm2 can occur with a normal copy number.
      <br/>
      This has been attributed to enhanced translation of mdm2 mRNA, which is thought to be related to a distinct 5'-untranslated region (5'-UTR) which causes the transcript to be translated more efficiently than the normal mdm2 transcript.
      <br/>
      Landers et al., Cancer Res. 57, 3562, (1997).
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      Several approaches have been used to disrupt the interaction between p53 and mdm2.
      <br/>
      Small peptide inhibitors, screened from a phage display library, have been shown in ELISA assays to disrupt this interaction �Bottger et al., J. Mol. Biol., 269, 744 (1997)�. Microinjection of an anti-mdm2 antibody targeted to the p53-binding domain of mdm2 increased p53-dependent transcription �Blaydes et al., Oncogene, 14, 1859 (1997)�.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      A vector-based antisense approach has been used to study the function of mdm2.
      <br/>
      Using a rhabdomyosarcoma model, Fiddler et al. �Mol. Cell Biol., 16, 5048 (1996)� demonstrated that amplified mdm2 inhibits the ability of MyoD to function as a transcription factor.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, expression of full-length antisense mdm2 from a cytomegalovirus promoter-containing vector restores muscle-specific gene expression.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      Antisense oligonucleotides have also been useful in understanding the role of mdm2 in regulation of p53.
      <br/>
      An antisense oligonucleotide directed to the mdm2 start codon allowed cisplatin-induced p53-mediated apoptosis to occur in a cell line overexpressing mdm2 �Kondo et al., Oncogene, 10, 2001 (1995)�. The same oligonucleotide was found to inhibit the expression of P-glycoprotein �Kondo et al., Br. J. Cancer, 74, 1263 (1996)�. P-glycoprotein was shown to be induced by mdm2.
      <br/>
      Teoh et al �Blood, 90, 1982 (1997)� demonstrated that treatment with an identical mdm2 antisense oligonucleotide or a shorter version within the same region in a tumor cell line decreased DNA synthesis and cell viability and triggered apoptosis.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      Chen et al. �Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 95, 195 (1998); WO 99/10486� disclose antisense oligonucleotides targeted to the coding region of mdm2.
      <br/>
      A reduction in mdm2 RNA and protein levels was seen, and transcriptional activity from a p53-responsive promoter was increased after oligonucleotide treatment of JAR (choriocarcinoma) or SJSA (osteosarcoma) cells.

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="15">
      Tumors often result from genetic changes in cellular regulatory genes.
      <br/>
      Among the most important of these are the tumor suppressor genes, of which p53 is the most widely studied.
      <br/>
      Approximately half of all human tumors have a mutation in the p53 gene.
      <br/>
      This mutation disrupts the ability of the p53 protein to bind to DNA and act as a transcription factor.
      <br/>
      Hyperproliferation of cells occurs as a result.
      <br/>
      Another mechanism by which p53 can be inactivated is through overexpression of mdm2, which regulates p53 activity in a feedback loop.
      <br/>
      The mdm2 protein binds to p53 in its DNA binding region, preventing its activity.
      <br/>
      Mdm2 is amplified in some human tumors, and this amplification is diagnostic of neoplasia or the potential therefor.
      <br/>
      Over one third of human sarcomas have elevated mdm2 sequences.
      <br/>
      Elevated expression may also be involved in other tumors including but not limited to those in which p53 inactivation has been implicated.
      <br/>
      These include colorectal carcinoma, lung cancer and chronic myelogenous leukemia.
    </p>
    <p num="16">
      Many abnormal proliferative conditions, particularly hyperproliferative conditions, are believed to be associated with increased mdm2 expression and are, therefore believed to be responsive to inhibition of mdm2 expression.
      <br/>
      Examples of these hyperproliferative conditions are cancers, psoriasis, blood vessel stenosis (e.g., restenosis or atherosclerosis), and fibrosis, e.g., of the lung or kidney.
      <br/>
      Increased levels of wild-type or mutated p53 have been found in some cancers (Nagashima, G., et al., Acta Neurochir. (Wein), 1999, 141, 53-61; Fiedler, A., et al., Langenbecks Arch.
      <br/>
      Surg., 1998, 383, 269-275).
      <br/>
      Increased levels of p53 is also associated with resistance of a cancer to a chemotherapeutic drug (Brown, R., et al., Int. J. Cancer, 1993, 55, 678-684).
      <br/>
      These diseases or conditions may be amenable to treatment by induction of mdm2 expression.
    </p>
    <p num="17">
      The present invention employs antisense compounds, particularly oligonucleotides, for use in modulating the function of nucleic acid molecules encoding mdm2, ultimately modulating the amount of mdm2 produced.
      <br/>
      This is accomplished by providing oligonucleotides which specifically hybridize with nucleic acids, preferably mRNA, encoding mdm2.
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      This relationship between an antisense compound such as an oligonucleotide and its complementary nucleic acid target, to which it hybridizes, is commonly referred to as "antisense". "Targeting" an oligonucleotide to a chosen nucleic acid target, in the context of this invention, is a multistep process.
      <br/>
      The process usually begins with identifying a nucleic acid sequence whose function is to be modulated.
      <br/>
      This may be, as examples, a cellular gene (or mRNA made from the gene) whose expression is associated with a particular disease state, or a foreign nucleic acid from an infectious agent.
      <br/>
      In the present invention, the target is a nucleic acid encoding mdm2; in other words, a mdm2 gene or RNA expressed from a mdm2 gene. mdm2 mRNA is presently the preferred target.
      <br/>
      The targeting process also includes determination of a site or sites within the nucleic acid sequence for the antisense interaction to occur such that modulation of gene expression will result.
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      In accordance with this invention, persons of ordinary skill in the art will understand that messenger RNA includes not only the information to encode a protein using the three letter genetic code, but also associated ribonucleotides which form a region known to such persons as the 5'-untranslated region, the 3'-untranslated region, the 5' cap region and intron/exon junction ribonucleotides.
      <br/>
      Thus, oligonucleotides may be formulated in accordance with this invention which are targeted wholly or in part to these associated ribonucleotides as well as to the informational ribonucleotides.
      <br/>
      The oligonucleotide may therefore be specifically hybridizable with a transcription initiation site region, a translation initiation codon region, a 5' cap region, an intron/exon junction, coding sequences, a translation termination codon region or sequences in the 5'- or 3'-untranslated region.
      <br/>
      Since, as is known in the art, the translation initiation codon is typically 5'-AUG (in transcribed mRNA molecules; 5'-ATG in the corresponding DNA molecule), the translation initiation codon is also referred to as the "AUG codon," the "start codon" or the "AUG start codon." A minority of genes have a translation initiation codon having the RNA sequence 5'-GUG, 5'-UUG or 5'-CUG, and 5'-AUA, 5'-ACG and 5'-CUG have been shown to function in vivo.
      <br/>
      Thus, the terms "translation initiation codon" and "start codon" can encompass many codon sequences, even though the initiator amino acid in each instance is typically methionine (in eukaryotes) or formylmethionine (prokaryotes).
      <br/>
      It is also known in the art that eukaryotic and prokaryotic genes may have two or more alternative start codons, any one of which may be preferentially utilized for translation initiation in a particular cell type or tissue, or under a particular set of conditions.
      <br/>
      In the context of the invention, "start codon" and "translation initiation codon" refer to the codon or codons that are used in vivo to initiate translation of an mRNA molecule transcribed from a gene encoding mdm2, regardless of the sequence(s) of such codons.
      <br/>
      It is also known in the art that a translation termination codon (or "stop codon") of a gene may have one of three sequences, i.e., 5'-UAA, 5'-UAG and 5'-UGA (the corresponding DNA sequences are 5'-TAA, 5'-TAG and 5'-TGA, respectively).
      <br/>
      The terms "start codon region" and "translation initiation codon region" refer to a portion of such an mRNA or gene that encompasses from about 25 to about 50 contiguous nucleotides in either direction (i.e., 5' or 3') from a translation initiation codon.
      <br/>
      This region is a preferred target region.
      <br/>
      Similarly, the terms "stop codon region" and "translation termination codon region" refer to a portion of such an mRNA or gene that encompasses from about 25 to about 50 contiguous nucleotides in either direction (i.e., 5' or 3') from a translation termination codon.
      <br/>
      This region is a preferred target region.
      <br/>
      The open reading frame (ORF) or "coding region," which is known in the art to refer to the region between the translation initiation codon and the translation termination codon, is also a region which may be targeted effectively.
      <br/>
      Other preferred target regions include the 5' untranslated region (5' UTR), known in the art to refer to the portion of an mRNA in the 5' direction from the translation initiation codon, and thus including nucleotides between the 5' cap site and the translation initiation codon of an mRNA or corresponding nucleotides on the gene) and the 3' untranslated region (3' UTR), known in the art to refer to the portion of an mRNA in the 3' direction from the translation termination codon, and thus including nucleotides between the translation termination codon and 3' end of an mRNA or corresponding nucleotides on the gene). mdm2 is believed to have alternative transcripts which differ in their 5'-UTR regions.
      <br/>
      The S-mdm2 transcript class is translated approximately 8-fold more efficiently than the L-mdm2 transcripts produced by the constitutive promoter.
      <br/>
      Landers et al., Cancer Res., 57, 3562 (1997).
      <br/>
      Accordingly, both the 5'-UTR of the S-mdm transcript and the 5'-UTR of the L-mdm2 transcript are preferred target regions, with the S-mdm2 5'-UTR being more preferred. mRNA splice sites may also be preferred target regions, and are particularly useful in situations where aberrant splicing is implicated in disease, or where an overproduction of a particular mRNA splice product is implicated in disease.
      <br/>
      Aberrant fusion junctions due to rearrangements or deletions may also be preferred targets.
    </p>
    <p num="20">Once the target site or sites have been identified, oligonucleotides are chosen which are sufficiently complementary to the target, i.e., hybridize sufficiently well and with sufficient specificity, to give the desired modulation.</p>
    <p num="21">
      "Hybridization", in the context of this invention, means hydrogen bonding, also known as Watson-Crick base pairing, between complementary bases, usually on opposite nucleic acid strands or two regions of a nucleic acid strand.
      <br/>
      Guanine and cytosine are examples of complementary bases which are known to form three hydrogen bonds between them.
      <br/>
      Adenine and thymine are examples of complementary bases which form two hydrogen bonds between them.
    </p>
    <p num="22">"Specifically hybridizable" and "complementary" are terms which are used to indicate a sufficient degree of complementarity such that stable and specific binding occurs between the DNA or RNA target and the oligonucleotide.</p>
    <p num="23">
      It is understood that an oligonucleotide need not be 100% complementary to its target nucleic acid sequence to be specifically hybridizable.
      <br/>
      An oligonucleotide is specifically hybridizable when binding of the oligonucleotide to the target interferes with the normal function of the target molecule to cause a loss of utility, and there is a sufficient degree of complementarity to avoid non-specific binding of the oligonucleotide to non-target sequences under conditions in which specific binding is desired, i.e., under physiological conditions in the case of in vivo assays or therapeutic treatment and, in the case of in vitro assays, under conditions in which the assays are conducted.
    </p>
    <p num="24">
      Hybridization of antisense oligonucleotides with mRNA interferes with one or more of the normal functions of mRNA.
      <br/>
      The functions of mRNA to be interfered with include all vital functions such as, for example, translocation of the RNA to the site of protein translation, translation of protein from the RNA, splicing of the RNA to yield one or more mRNA species, and catalytic activity which may be engaged in by the RNA.
    </p>
    <p num="25">
      The overall effect of interference with mRNA function is modulation of mdm2 expression.
      <br/>
      In the context of this invention "modulation" means either inhibition or stimulation; i.e., either a decrease or increase in expression.
      <br/>
      This modulation can be measured in ways which are routine in the art, for example by Northern blot assay of mRNA expression as taught in the examples of the instant application or by Western blot or ELISA assay of protein expression, or by an immunoprecipitation assay of protein expression, as taught in the examples of the instant application.
      <br/>
      Effects on cell proliferation or tumor cell growth can also be measured, as taught in the examples of the instant application.
    </p>
    <p num="26">
      The antisense compounds of this invention can be used in diagnostics, therapeutics, prophylaxis, and as research reagents and in kits.
      <br/>
      Since these compounds hybridize to nucleic acids encoding mdm2, sandwich, calorimetric and other assays can easily be constructed to exploit this fact.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, since the antisense compounds of this invention hybridize specifically to nucleic acids encoding particular isozymes of mdm2, such assays can be devised for screening of cells and tissues for particular mdm2 isozymes.
      <br/>
      Such assays can be utilized for diagnosis of diseases associated with various mdm2 forms.
      <br/>
      Provision of means for detecting hybridization of oligonucleotide with a mdm2 gene or mRNA can routinely be accomplished.
      <br/>
      Such provision may include enzyme conjugation, radiolabelling or any other suitable detection systems.
      <br/>
      Kits for detecting the presence or absence of mdm2 may also be prepared.
    </p>
    <p num="27">
      The present invention is also suitable for diagnosing abnormal proliferative states in tissue or other samples from patients suspected of having a hyperproliferative disease such as cancer or psoriasis.
      <br/>
      The ability of the oligonucleotides of the present invention to inhibit cell proliferation may be employed to diagnose such states.
      <br/>
      A number of assays may be formulated employing the present invention, which assays will commonly comprise contacting a tissue sample with an antisense compound of the invention under conditions selected to permit detection and, usually, quantitation of such inhibition.
      <br/>
      In the context of this invention, to "contact" tissues or cells with an antisense compound means to add the compound(s), usually in a liquid carrier, to a cell suspension or tissue sample, either in vitro or ex vivo, or to administer the antisense compound(s) to cells or tissues within an animal.
      <br/>
      Similarly, the present invention can be used to distinguish mdm2-associated tumors, particularly tumors associated with mdm2 ALPHA , from tumors having other etiologies, in order that an efficacious treatment regime can be designed.
    </p>
    <p num="28">
      The antisense compounds of this invention may also be used for research purposes.
      <br/>
      Thus, the specific hybridization exhibited by oligonucleotides may be used for assays, purifications, cellular product preparations and in other methodologies which may be appreciated by persons of ordinary skill in the art.
    </p>
    <p num="29">
      In the context of this invention, the term "oligonucleotide" refers to an oligomer or polymer of ribonucleic acid or deoxyribonucleic acid.
      <br/>
      This term includes oligonucleotides composed of naturally-occurring nucleobases, sugars and covalent intersugar (backbone) linkages as well as oligonucleotides having non-naturally-occurring portions which function similarly.
      <br/>
      Such modified or substituted oligonucleotides are often preferred over native forms because of desirable properties such as, for example, enhanced cellular uptake, enhanced binding to target and increased stability in the presence of nucleases.
    </p>
    <p num="30">
      The antisense compounds in accordance with this invention preferably comprise from about 5 to about 50 nucleobases.
      <br/>
      Particularly preferred are antisense oligonucleotides comprising from about 8 to about 30 linked nucleobases (i.e. from about 8 to about 30 nucleosides).
      <br/>
      As is known in the art, a nucleoside is a base-sugar combination.
      <br/>
      The base portion of the nucleoside is normally a heterocyclic base.
      <br/>
      The two most common classes of such heterocyclic bases are the purines and the pyrimidines.
      <br/>
      Nucleotides are nucleosides that further include a phosphate group covalently linked to the sugar portion of the nucleoside.
      <br/>
      For those nucleosides that include a pentofuranosyl sugar, the phosphate group can be linked to either the 2', 3' or 5' hydroxyl moiety of the sugar.
      <br/>
      In forming oligonucleotides, the phosphate groups covalently link adjacent nucleosides to one another to form a linear polymeric compound.
      <br/>
      In turn, the respective ends of this linear polymeric structure can be further joined to form a circular structure, however, open linear structures are generally preferred.
      <br/>
      Within the oligonucleotide structure, the phosphate groups are commonly referred to as forming the internucleoside backbone of the oligonucleotide.

    <p num="32">
      The oligonucleotides of the invention may additionally or alternatively include nucleobase modifications or substitutions.
      <br/>
      As used herein, "unmodified" or "natural" nucleobases include adenine (A), guanine (G), thymine (T), cytosine (C) and uracil (U).
      <br/>

      The N6 position of a purine nucleobase may also be utilized to link a lipophilic moiety to an oligonucleotide of the invention (Gebeyehu, G., et al., Nucleic Acids Res., 1987, 15, 4513).
      <br/>
      Such lipophilic moieties include but are not limited to a cholesteryl moiety �Letsinger et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA., 86, 6553 (1989)�, cholic acid �Manoharan et al., Bioorg. Med. Chem. Let., 4, 1053 (1994)�, a thioether, e.g., hexyl-S-tritylthiol �Manoharan et al., Ann. N.Y. Acad. Sci., 660, 306 (1992); Manoharan et al., Bioorg. Med. Chem.

Oligonucleotides comprising lipophilic moieties, and methods for preparing such oligonucleotides, as disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,138,045, 5,218,105 and 5,459,255, the contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference.
    </p>
    <p num="34">
      The present invention also includes oligonucleotides which are chimeric oligonucleotides. "Chimeric" oligonucleotides or "chimeras," in the context of this invention, are oligonucleotides which contain two or more chemically distinct regions, each made up of at least one nucleotide.
      <br/>
      These oligonucleotides typically contain at least one region wherein the oligonucleotide is modified so as to confer upon the oligonucleotide increased resistance to nuclease degradation, increased cellular uptake, and/or increased binding affinity for the target nucleic acid.
      <br/>
      An additional region of the oligonucleotide may serve as a substrate for enzymes capable of cleaving RNA:DNA or RNA:RNA hybrids.
      <br/>
      By way of example, RNase H is a cellular endonuclease which cleaves the RNA strand of an RNA:DNA duplex.
      <br/>
      Activation of RNase H, therefore, results in cleavage of the RNA target, thereby greatly enhancing the efficiency of antisense inhibition of gene expression.
      <br/>
      Cleavage of the RNA target can be routinely detected by gel electrophoresis and, if necessary, associated nucleic acid hybridization techniques known in the art.
      <br/>
      This RNAse H-mediated cleavage of the RNA target is distinct from the use of ribozymes to cleave nucleic acids.
      <br/>
      Ribozymes are not comprehended by the present invention.
    </p>
    <p num="35">
      Examples of chimeric oligonucleotides include but are not limited to "gapmers," in which three distinct regions are present, normally with a central region flanked by two regions which are chemically equivalent to each other but distinct from the gap.
      <br/>
      A preferred example of a gapmer is an oligonucleotide in which a central portion (the "gap") of the oligonucleotide serves as a substrate for RNase H and is preferably composed of 2'-deoxynucleotides, while the flanking portions (the 5' and 3' "wings") are modified to have greater affinity for the target RNA molecule but are unable to support nuclease activity (e.g., 2'-fluoro- or 2'-O-methoxyethyl-substituted).
      <br/>
      Other chimeras include "wingmers," also known in the art as "hemimers," that is, oligonucleotides with two distinct regions.
      <br/>
      In a preferred example of a wingmer, the 5' portion of the oligonucleotide serves as a substrate for RNase H and is preferably composed of 2'-deoxynucleotides, whereas the 3' portion is modified in such a fashion so as to have greater affinity for the target RNA molecule but is unable to support nuclease activity (e.g., 2'-fluoro- or 2'-O-methoxyethyl-substituted), or vice-versa.
      <br/>
      In one embodiment, the oligonucleotides of the present invention contain a 2'-O-methoxyethyl (2'-O--CH2 CH2 OCH3) modification on the sugar moiety of at least one nucleotide.
      <br/>
      This modification has been shown to increase both affinity of the oligonucleotide for its target and nuclease resistance of the oligonucleotide.
      <br/>
      According to the invention, one, a plurality, or all of the nucleotide subunits of the oligonucleotides of the invention may bear a 2'-O-methoxyethyl (--O--CH2 CH2 OCH3) modification.
      <br/>
      Oligonucleotides comprising a plurality of nucleotide subunits having a 2'-O-methoxyethyl modification can have such a modification on any of the nucleotide subunits within the oligonucleotide, and may be chimeric oligonucleotides.
      <br/>
      Aside from or in addition to 2'-O-methoxyethyl modifications, oligonucleotides containing other modifications which enhance antisense efficacy, potency or target affinity are also preferred.
      <br/>
      Chimeric oligonucleotides comprising one or more such modifications are presently preferred.
      <br/>
      Through use of such modifications, active oligonucleotides have been identified which are shorter than conventional "first generation" oligonucleotides active against mdm2.
      <br/>
      Oligonucleotides in accordance with this invention are from 5 to 50 nucleotides in length, preferably from about 8 to about 30.
      <br/>
      In the context of this invention it is understood that this encompasses non-naturally occurring oligomers as hereinbefore described, having from 5 to 50 monomers, preferably from about 8 to about 30.
    </p>
    <p num="36">
      The oligonucleotides used in accordance with this invention may be conveniently and routinely made through the well-known technique of solid phase synthesis.
      <br/>
      Equipment for such synthesis is sold by several vendors including Applied Biosystems.
      <br/>
      Any other means for such synthesis may also be employed; the actual synthesis of the oligonucleotides is well within the talents of the routineer.
      <br/>
      It is well known to use similar techniques to prepare oligonucleotides such as the phosphorothioates and 2'-alkoxy or 2'-alkoxyalkoxy derivatives, including 2'-O-methoxyethyl oligonucleotides �Martin, P., Helv. Chim. Acta, 78, 486 (1995)�. It is also well known to use similar techniques and commercially available modified amidites and controlled-pore glass (CPG) products such as biotin, fluorescein, acridine or psoralen-modified amidites and/or CPG (available from Glen Research, Sterling Va.) to synthesize fluorescently labeled, biotinylated or other conjugated oligonucleotides.

    <p num="38">Pharmaceutically acceptable "salts" are physiologically and pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the nucleic acids of the invention: i.e., salts that retain the desired biological activity of the parent compound and do not impart undesired toxicological effects thereto �see, for example, Berge et al., "Pharmaceutical Salts," J. of Pharma Sci., 66:1 (1977)�.</p>
    <p num="39">For oligonucleotides, examples of pharmaceutically acceptable salts include but are not limited to (a) salts formed with cations such as sodium, potassium, ammonium, magnesium, calcium, polyamines such as spermine and spermidine, etc.; (b) acid addition salts formed with inorganic acids, for example hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, sulfuric acid, phosphoric acid, nitric acid and the like; .COPYRGT. salts formed with organic acids such as, for example, acetic acid, oxalic acid, tartaric acid, succinic acid, maleic acid, fumaric acid, gluconic acid, citric acid, malic acid, ascorbic acid, benzoic acid, tannic acid, palmitic acid, alginic acid, polyglutamic acid, naphthalenesulfonic acid, methanesulfonic acid, p-toluenesulfonic acid, naphthalenedisulfonic acid, polygalacturonic acid, and the like; and (d) salts formed from elemental anions such as chlorine, bromine, and iodine.</p>
    <p num="40">
      The oligonucleotides of the invention may additionally or alternatively be prepared to be delivered in a "prodrug" form.

      The term "prodrug" indicates a therapeutic agent that is prepared in an inactive form that is converted to an active form (i.e., drug) within the body or cells thereof by the action of endogenous enzymes or other chemicals and/or conditions.
      <br/>
      In particular, prodrug versions of the oligonucleotides of the invention are prepared as SATE �(S-acetyl-2-thioethyl) phosphate� derivatives according to the methods disclosed in WO 93/24510 to Gosselin et al., published Dec. 9, 1993.

      In some cases it may be more effective to treat a patient with an oligonucleotide of the invention in conjunction with other traditional therapeutic modalities in order to increase the efficacy of a treatment regimen.
      <br/>
      In the context of the invention, the term "treatment regimen" is meant to encompass therapeutic, palliative and prophylactic modalities.
      <br/>
      For example, a patient may be treated with conventional chemotherapeutic agents, particularly those used for tumor and cancer treatment.

      The formulation of therapeutic compositions and their subsequent administration is believed to be within the skill of those in the art.
      <br/>
      Dosing is dependent on severity and responsiveness of the disease state to be treated, with the course of treatment lasting from several days to several months, or until a cure is effected or a diminution of the disease state is achieved.
      <br/>
      Optimal dosing schedules can be calculated from measurements of drug accumulation in the body of the patient.
      <br/>
      Persons of ordinary skill can easily determine optimum dosages, dosing methodologies and repetition rates.
      <br/>
      Optimum dosages may vary depending on the relative potency of individual oligonucleotides, and can generally be estimated based on EC50 s found to be effective in in vitro and in vivo animal models.
      <br/>
      In general, dosage is from 0.01  MU g to 100 g per kg of body weight, and may be given once or more daily, weekly, monthly or yearly, or even once every 2 to 20 years.
      <br/>
      Persons of ordinary skill in the art can easily estimate repetition rates for dosing based on measured residence times and concentrations of the drug in bodily fluids or tissues.
      <br/>
      Following successful treatment, it may be desirable to have the patient undergo maintenance therapy to prevent the recurrence of the disease state, wherein the oligonucleotide is administered in maintenance doses, ranging from 0.01  MU g to 100 g per kg of body weight, once or more daily, to once every 20 years.

      Thus, in the context of this invention, by "therapeutically effective amount" is meant the amount of the compound which is required to have a therapeutic effect on the treated mammal.
      <br/>
      This amount, which will be apparent to the skilled artisan, will depend upon the type of mammal, the age and weight of the mammal, the type of disease to be treated, perhaps even the gender of the mammal, and other factors which are routinely taken into consideration when treating a mammal with a disease.
      <br/>
      A therapeutic effect is assessed in the mammal by measuring the effect of the compound on the disease state in the animal.
      <br/>
      For example, if the disease to be treated is cancer, therapeutic effects are assessed by measuring the rate of growth or the size of the tumor, or by measuring the production of compounds such as cytokines, production of which is an indication of the progress or regression of the tumor.

    <p num="53">Synthesis of Oligonucleotides</p>
    <p num="54">
      Unmodified oligodeoxynucleotides are synthesized on an automated DNA synthesizer (Applied Biosystems model 380B) using standard phosphoramidite chemistry with oxidation by iodine.  BETA -cyanoethyldiisopropyl-phosphoramidites are purchased from Applied Biosystems (Foster City, Calif.).
      <br/>
      For phosphorothioate oligonucleotides, the standard oxidation bottle was replaced by a 0.2 M solution of 3 H-1,2-benzodithiole-3-one 1,1-dioxide in acetonitrile for the stepwise thiation of the phosphite linkages.
      <br/>
      The thiation cycle wait step was increased to 68 seconds and was followed by the capping step.
    </p>
    <p num="55">
      2'-methoxy oligonucleotides are synthesized using 2'-methoxy  BETA -cyanoethyldiisopropyl-phosphoramidites (Chemgenes, Needham, Mass.) and the standard cycle for unmodified oligonucleotides, except the wait step after pulse delivery of tetrazole and base was increased to 360 seconds.
      <br/>
      Other 2'-alkoxy oligonucleotides were synthesized by a modification of this method, using appropriate 2'-modified amidites such as those available from Glen Research, Inc., Sterling, Va.
    </p>
    <p num="56">
      2'-fluoro oligonucleotides were synthesized as described in Kawasaki et al., J. Med. Chem., 36, 831 (1993).
      <br/>
      Briefly, the protected nucleoside N6 -benzoyl-2'-deoxy-2'-fluoroadenosine was synthesized utilizing commercially available 9- BETA -D-arabinofuranosyladenine as starting material and by modifying literature procedures whereby the 2'- ALPHA -fluoro atom is introduced by a SN 2-displacement of a 2'- BETA -O-trifyl group.
      <br/>
      Thus N6 -benzoyl-9- BETA -D-arabinofuranosyladenine was selectively protected in moderate yield as the 3',5'-ditetrahydropyranyl (THP) intermediate.
      <br/>

      To the residue N,N-diisopropylamine tetrazonide (0.29 g, 1.67 mmol) was added and dried over P2 O5 under high vacuum overnight at 40 (degree)  C. Then the reaction mixture was dissolved in anhydrous acetonitrile (8.4 mL) and 2-cyanoethyl-N,N,N1,N1 -tetraisopropylphosphoramidite (2.12 mL, 6.08 mmol) was added.
      <br/>
      The reaction mixture was stirred at ambient temperature for 4 hrs under inert atmosphere.
      <br/>
      The progress of the reaction was monitored by TLC (hexane:ethyl acetate 1:1).
      <br/>
      The solvent was evaporated, then the residue was dissolved in ethyl acetate (70 mL) and washed with 5% aqueous NaHCO3 (40 mL) Ethyl acetate layer was dried over anhydrous Na2 SO4 and concentrated.
      <br/>
      Residue obtained was chromatographed (ethyl acetate as eluent) to get 5'-O-DMT-2'-O-(2-N,N-dimethylaminooxyethyl)-5-methyluridine-3'-�(2-cyanoethyl)-N,N-diisopropylphosphoramidite� as a foam (1.04 g, 74.9%).

    <p num="133">
      p53 is known to regulate the expression of a number of genes and to be involved in apoptosis.
      <br/>
      Representative genes known to be regulated by p53 include p21 (Deng, C., et al., Cell, 1995, 82, 675), bax (Selvakumaran, M., et al., Oncogene, 1994, 9, 1791-1798) and GADD45 (Carrier, F., et al., J. Biol. Chem., 1994, 269, 32672-32677).
      <br/>
      The effect of an mdm2 antisense oligonucleotide on these genes is investigated by RPA analysis using the RIBOQUANT (tm)  RPA kit, according to the manufacturer's instructions (Pharmingen, San Diego, Calif.), along with the hSTRESS-1 multi-probe template set.
      <br/>
      Included in this template set are bclx, p53, GADD45, c-fos, p21, bax, bcl2 and mcl1.
      <br/>
      The effect of mdm2 antisense oligonucleotides on p53-mediated apoptosis can readily be assessed using commercial kits based on apoptotic markers such as DNA fragmentation or caspase activity.

      Oligonucleotide activity was assayed by quantitation of mdm2 mRNA levels by real-time PCR (RT-PCR) using the ABI PRISM (tm)  7700 Sequence Detection System (PE-Applied Biosystems, Foster City, Calif.) according to manufacturer's instructions.
      <br/>
      This is a closed-tube, non-gel-based, fluorescence detection system which allows high-throughput quantitation of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) products in real-time.
      <br/>
      As opposed to standard PCR, in which amplification products are quantitated after the PCR is completed, products in RT-PCR are quantitated as they accumulate.
      <br/>
      This is accomplished by including in the PCR reaction an oligonucleotide probe that anneals specifically between the forward and reverse PCR primers, and contains two fluorescent dyes.
      <br/>
      The primers and probes used were:
    </p>
    <p num="152">
      Forward: 5'-GGCAAATGTGCAATACCAACA-3' (SEQ ID NO. 269)
      <br/>
      Reverse: 5'-TGCACCAACAGACTTTAATAACTTCA-3' (SEQ ID NO. 270)
      <br/>
      Probe: 5'-FAM-CCACCTCACAGATTCCAGCTTCGGA-TAMRA-3' (SEQ ID NO. 271)
    </p>
    <p num="153">
      A reporter dye (e.g., JOE or FAM, PE-Applied Biosystems, Foster City, Calif.) was attached to the 5' end of the probe and a quencher dye (e.g., TAMRA, PE-Applied Biosystems, Foster City, Calif.) was attached to the 3' end of the probe.
      <br/>
      When the probe and dyes are intact, reporter dye emission is quenched by the proximity of the 3' quencher dye.
      <br/>
      During amplification, annealing of the probe to the target sequence creates a substrate that can be cleaved by the 5'-exonuclease activity of Taq polymerase.
      <br/>
      During the extension phase of the PCR amplification cycle, cleavage of the probe by Taq polymerase releases the reporter dye from the remainder of the probe (and hence from the quencher moiety) and a sequence-specific fluorescent signal is generated.
      <br/>
      With each cycle, additional reporter dye molecules are cleaved from their respective probes, and the fluorescence intensity is monitored at regular (six-second) intervals by laser optics built into the ABI PRISM (tm)  7700 Sequence Detection System.
      <br/>
      In each assay, a series of parallel reactions containing serial dilutions of mRNA from untreated control samples generates a standard curve that is used to quantitate the percent inhibition after antisense oligonucleotide treatment of test samples.

      RT-PCR reactions were carried out by adding 25  MU l PCR cocktail (1 *  TAQMAN.RTM. buffer A, 5.5 mM MgCl2, 300  MU M each of dATP, dCTP and dGTP, 600  MU M of dUTP, 100 nM each of forward primer, reverse primer, and probe, 20 U RNAse inhibitor, 1.25 units AMPLITAQ GOLD.RTM., and 12.5 U MuLV reverse transcriptase) to 96 well plates containing 25  MU l poly(A) mRNA solution.
      <br/>
      The RT reaction was carried out by incubation for 30 minutes at 48 (degree)  C. Following a 10 minute incubation at 95 (degree)  C. to activate the AMPLITAQ GOLD.RTM., 40 cycles of a two-step PCR protocol were carried out: 95 (degree)  C. for 15 seconds (denaturation) followed by 60 (degree)  C. for 1.5 minutes (annealing/extension).
