    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="1">This invention relates to a cyclic decoration lamp assembly, and more particularly, this invention relates to a cyclic decoration lamp assembly which contains a plurality of decoration lamps.</p>
    <p num="2">
      Referring to FIG. 1, a conventional decoration lamp device comprises a lamp 3 disposed on a lamp clamp 2, and the lamp clamp 2 disposed on a plate 1.
      <br/>
      However, the lamp clamp 2 may not position the lamp 3 stably.
      <br/>
      The lamp 3 may be disposed on the lamp clamp 2 loosely.
    </p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="3">An object of the invention is to provide a cyclic lamp assembly which contains a plurality of decoration lamps positioned on the cyclic decoration lamp assembly stably.</p>
    <p num="4">
      In accordance with a first preferred embodiment of this invention, a cyclic decoration lamp assembly comprises a cyclic frame assembly and a decoration lamp string.
      <br/>
      The decoration lamp string comprises a plurality of sockets, and a wire connected to the sockets.
      <br/>
      Each socket has two lateral grooves.
      <br/>
      Each socket receives a bulb.
      <br/>
      The cyclic frame assembly comprises a first cyclic frame, a second cyclic frame, a third cyclic frame, and a plurality of connection rods arranged in a radiation shape and disposed in a spacing defined between two cyclic frames.
      <br/>
      A clearance is defined between two connection rods.
      <br/>
      Each connection rod has a protruded bar.
      <br/>
      The first cyclic frame has a plurality of first protruded posts and a plurality of first notches.
      <br/>
      The second cyclic frame has a plurality of second protruded posts and a plurality of second notches.
      <br/>
      The third cyclic frame has a plurality of third protruded posts.
      <br/>
      The first cyclic frame engages with a first annular plate.
      <br/>
      The first annular plate has a plurality of first apertures receiving the first protruded posts.
      <br/>
      The second cyclic frame engages with a second annular plate.
      <br/>
      The second annular plate has a plurality of second apertures receiving the second protruded posts.
      <br/>
      The third cyclic frame engages with a third annular plate.
      <br/>
      The third annular plate has a plurality of third apertures receiving the third protruded posts.
      <br/>
      Each socket is inserted in the respective clearance.
      <br/>
      Each lateral groove receives the respective protruded bar.
      <br/>
      The wire is inserted in the second cyclic frame and the third cyclic frame.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      In accordance with a second preferred embodiment of this invention, a cyclic decoration lamp assembly comprises a star-shaped cyclic frame assembly and a decoration lamp string disposed in the star-shaped cyclic frame assembly.
      <br/>
      The decoration lamp string comprises a plurality of sockets, and a wire connected to the sockets.
      <br/>
      Each socket receives a bulb.
      <br/>
      The star-shaped cyclic frame assembly comprises an outer cyclic frame, an inner cyclic frame, and a plurality of connection rods connecting the outer cyclic frame and the inner cyclic frame.
      <br/>
      The outer cyclic frame has a first protruded bar.
      <br/>
      The inner cyclic frame has a second protruded bar.
      <br/>
      Each socket is inserted in a spacing between the outer cyclic frame and the inner cyclic frame.
      <br/>
      Each socket has two lateral grooves receiving the first protruded bar and the second protruded bar.

      <br/>
      Each socket 21 has two lateral grooves 211.
      <br/>
      Each socket 21 receives a bulb 22.
      <br/>
      The wire 201 can be connected to the sockets 21 electrically in parallel or in series.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      The cyclic frame assembly 10 comprises a first cyclic frame 12', a second cyclic frame 12, a third cyclic frame 12", and a plurality of connection rods 11 arranged in a radiation shape and disposed in a spacing defined between two cyclic frames 12' and 12 or 12 and 12".
      <br/>
      A clearance 13 is defined between two connection rods 11.
      <br/>
      Each connection rod 11 has a protruded bar 111.
      <br/>
      The first cyclic frame 12' has a plurality of first protruded posts 122' and a plurality of first notches 121'. The second cyclic frame 12 has a plurality of second protruded posts 122 and a plurality of second notches 121.
      <br/>
      The third cyclic frame 12" has a plurality of third protruded posts 122".
      <br/>
      The first cyclic frame 12' engages with a first annular plate 14'. The first annular plate 14' has a plurality of first apertures 141' receiving the first protruded posts 122'. The second cyclic frame 12 engages with a second annular plate 14.
      <br/>
      The second annular plate 14 has a plurality of second apertures 141 receiving the second protruded posts 122.
      <br/>
      The third cyclic frame 12" engages with a third annular plate 14".
      <br/>
      The third annular plate 14" has a plurality of third apertures 141" receiving the third protruded posts 122".
      <br/>
      Each socket 21 is inserted in the respective clearance 13.
      <br/>
      Each lateral groove 211 receives the respective protruded bar 111.
      <br/>
      The wire 201 is inserted in the second cyclic frame 12 and the third cyclic frame 12".
      <br/>
      Each first aperture 141' receives the respective first protruded post 122'. Each second aperture 141 receives the respective second protruded post 122.
      <br/>
      Each third apertures 141" receives the respective third protruded post 122".
    </p>
    <p num="10">Referring to FIGS. 6 to 8, another cyclic decoration lamp assembly comprises a star-shaped cyclic frame assembly 30 and a decoration lamp string 20 disposed in the star-shaped cyclic frame assembly 30.</p>
    <p num="11">
      The decoration lamp string 20 comprises a plurality of sockets 21, and a wire 201 connected to the sockets 21.
      <br/>
      Each socket 21 receives a bulb 22.
      <br/>
      The wire 201 can be connected to the sockets 21 electrically in parallel or in series.
    </p>
    <p num="12">
      The star-shaped cyclic frame assembly 30 comprises an outer cyclic frame 31, an inner cyclic frame 32, and a plurality of connection rods 33 connecting the outer cyclic frame 31 and the inner cyclic frame 32.
      <br/>
      The outer cyclic frame 31 has a first protruded bar 311.
      <br/>
      The inner cyclic frame 32 has a second protruded bar 321.
      <br/>
      Each socket 21 is inserted in a spacing between the outer cyclic frame 31 and the inner cyclic frame 32.
      <br/>
      Each socket 21 has two lateral grooves 211 receiving the first protruded bar 311 and the second protruded bar 321.
      <br/>
      Therefore, a plurality of decoration lamps can be positioned on the cyclic decoration lamp assembly stably.
