      A vehicle behavior control apparatus is provided which is designed to estimate the state of behavior of a vehicle body and to apply the brakes to wheels for suppressing an unwanted change in behavior of the vehicle body.
      <br/>
      The apparatus determines a lateral momentum of the vehicle body during traveling to estimate the state of behavior of the vehicle body based on the speeds of the wheels and calculates a target braking effort to be produced by each of the brake actuators based on the state of behavior of the vehicle.

    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="1">
      1.
      <br/>
      Technical Field of the Invention
    </p>
    <p num="2">The present invention relates generally to a behavior control apparatus for vehicles which monitors the behavior of a vehicle body and automatically regulates the braking effort applied to each wheel to control the behavior of the vehicle body.</p>
    <p num="3">2. Background Art</p>
    <p num="4">
      Japanese Patent First Publication No. 9-226555 discloses an automatic brake control system for vehicles designed to control brake pressure (i.e., wheel cylinder pressure) applied to each wheel as a function of traveling conditions of the vehicle.
      <br/>
      This system monitors the lateral acceleration acting on the vehicle, the direction of a turn, and the brake pedal effort produced by a vehicle operator to determine a target wheel speed of a compliance one of outside wheels during turning based on the speed of a front one of inside wheels and the lateral acceleration when no brakes are applied and to determine a target wheel speed of a front one of inside wheels during turning based on the speed of a front one of the outside wheels and the lateral acceleration when the brakes are being applied and the braking force applied to the wheels according to one of the target wheel speeds.
      <br/>
      In brief, a control reference value used in controlling a speed difference between the outside and inside wheels during turning based on the lateral acceleration is switched between states of applying the brakes and applying no brakes, thereby bringing the rotation of the right and left wheels into a preselected condition, e.g., by adjusting the speeds of the right and left wheels to have the same slip ratio for stability of vehicle motion.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      The above conventional system, however, does not estimate a vehicle condition in the automatic brake control and may encounter the problems that the automatic brake control causes the deterioration of vehicle behavior and/or the lack of braking force.
      <br/>
      Specifically, when the automatic brake control is carried out without taking a dynamic balance of the whole of a vehicle body into account in determining a target controlled state of each wheel, it may cause the dynamic balance of the vehicle body or vehicle behavior to be deteriorated.
    </p>

    <heading>DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading>
    <p num="32">
      Referring now to the drawings, wherein like numbers refer to like parts in several views, particularly to FIG. 1, there is shown a hydraulic system of a vehicle behavior control apparatus according to the present invention.
      <br/>
      The illustrated embodiment is used with, as one example, a rear-wheel drive vehicle equipped with a front hydraulic line for adjusting the braking force applied to right and left front wheels and a rear hydraulic line for adjusting the braking force applied to right and left rear wheels.
    </p>
    <p num="33">
      A brake pedal 1 is connected to a master cylinder 2 which serves as a hydraulic source producing brake pressure to be applied to each wheel.
      <br/>
      The master cylinder 2 is a tandem master cylinder in which two hydraulic pressure chambers are provided, one for each of the front and rear hydraulic lines.
      <br/>
      When the brake pedal 1 is depressed by a vehicle operator, it pushes pistons 2a and 2b through a brake booster 1a to develop hydraulic pressure within the master cylinder 2.
      <br/>
      The piston 2a, the brake booster 1a, and the brake pedal 1 are connected mechanically through a rod.
      <br/>
      The pistons 2a and 2b are connected to each other through a spring.
      <br/>
      A liquid-tight seal is disposed between the periphery of the pistons 2a and 2 and an inner wall of the master cylinder 2 to hermetically seal primary and secondary chambers 2A and 2B defined by the pistons 2a and 2b within the master cylinder 2.
      <br/>
      Within the primary and secondary chambers 2A and 2B, substantially the same hydraulic pressures is developed by the pedal effort.
      <br/>
      The second spring is also disposed between the piston 2b and an inner end of the master cylinder 2.
      <br/>
      The second spring serves to urge the brake pedal 1 to return to its initial position when released to speed the reduction in pressure within the master cylinder 2.

      A master reservoir 3 is disposed above the master cylinder 2 which is filled with brake fluid and which communicates with the primary and secondary chambers 2A and 2B in the master cylinder 2 through fluid paths formed between the master reservoir 3 and the master cylinder 2.
      <br/>
      The fluid paths between the master reservoir 3 and the master cylinder 2 each have the diameter much smaller than the inner diameter of the master cylinder 2 to function as an orifice which develops differential pressure of the brake fluid when flowing from the master cylinder 2 to the master reservoir 3.
      <br/>
      When the brake pedal 1 is depressed to move the pistons 2a and 2b to the right, as viewed in the drawing, so that they close the fluid paths to block the fluid communication between the master reservoir 3 and the master cylinder 2, it will cause pressure in the primary and secondary chambers 2A and 2B to be elevated to develop the master cylinder pressure (i.e., the brake pressure).
    </p>
    <p num="35">The master cylinder pressure is delivered to first and second hydraulic lines A and E. The first and second hydraulic lines A and E, as clearly shown in FIG. 1, have substantially the same part of construction, and explanation of part of the second hydraulic line B identical with that of the first hydraulic line A will be omitted here.</p>
    <p num="36">
      The first hydraulic line A has a pair of branch lines A1 and A2 which lead to a wheel cylinder 4 for the front right wheel FR and a wheel cylinder 5 for the front left wheel FL, respectively.

      The first hydraulic line A has a differential pressure control valve 6 disposed upstream of the branch lines A1 and A2.
      <br/>
      The differential pressure control valve 6 is a two-position valve switchable between an open position and a differential pressure position.
      <br/>
      In the differential pressure position, the flow of the brake fluid both from the master cylinder 2 and from the wheel cylinders 4 and 5 is inhibited basically, but the flow of the brake fluid from the wheel cylinders 4 and 5 to the master cylinder 2 is allowed only when the fluid pressure in the wheel cylinders 4 and 5 exceeds the master cylinder pressure plus a set pressure (e.g., 50 kgf/cmm2).
      <br/>
      The master cylinder pressure is not elevated above a set pressure.
      <br/>
      The pressure in the wheel cylinders 4 and 5 is, thus, held below a preselected level, thereby avoiding an excessive elevation in pressure in the first hydraulic line A which would cause breakage thereof.

      A check valve 6a is disposed in parallel to the differential pressure control valve 6.

      <br/>
      The check valves 9a and 9b may be built in the pump 9.
      <br/>
      The pump 9 may be a piston pump or a trochoid pump.
      <br/>
      The trochoid pump usually has a small fluid-flow pulsation and thus is useful when the pump 9 is activated frequently to perform a brake assist function.
      <br/>
      The pump 9 is driven by a motor M which also drives a pump 39 installed in the second hydraulic line E.
    </p>
    <p num="41">
      The brake fluid discharged from the pump 9 passes through a damper 13.

      The damper 13 suppresses the pulsation of the brake fluid from the pump 9.

    <p num="42">
      The pump 9 sucks the brake fluid not only from the reservoir 10, but also from the primary chamber 2A of the master cylinder 2 and the master reservoir 3 through the hydraulic line D. The hydraulic line D connects at one end with the inlet port of the pump 9 and at the other end with branch lines D1 and D2 which lead to the primary chamber 2A and the master reservoir 3, respectively.
      <br/>
      The branch lines D1 and D2 have disposed therein control valves 14 and 15 which selectively establish and block communications between the pump 9 and the primary chamber 2A and between the pump 9 and the master reservoir 3, respectively.

      A check valve 15a is disposed in the branch line D2 to avoid the backflow of the brake fluid to the master reservoir 3.

      <br/>
      This is because there is a possibility that the flow of the brake fluid into the reservoir 10 from the primary chamber 2A or the master reservoir 3 disturbs the reduction in wheel cylinder pressure during the anti-skid control or the vehicle behavior control.

    <p num="43">In a normal braking mode where the brakes are applied to the vehicle only by depression of the brake pedal 1, all the valves in the first hydraulic line A are in the illustrated positions so that the pressure in the primary chamber 2A is applied to the wheel cylinders 4 and 5 through the differential pressure control valve 6 and the pressure elevation control valves 7 and 8.</p>
    <p num="44">
      The second hydraulic line E, as can be seen from the drawing, is different in structure from the first hydraulic line A in that the branch line D2, the control valve 15, and the check valve 15a installed in the branch line D2 are not provided.

      Other arrangements are identical, and explanation thereof in detail will be omitted here.
    </p>
    <p num="45">
      The installation of the branch line D2 in the first hydraulic line A for pumping the brake fluid out of the master reservoir 3 is for the following reasons.
      <br/>
      Usually, the deceleration of the vehicle body during braking causes the load of the vehicle body to be shifted forward, thereby resulting in an increase in braking ability of the front wheels.
      <br/>
      This is also evident from a known ideal braking force distribution curve.
      <br/>
      Specifically, a longitudinal braking force (i.e., a road surface gripping force) and a lateral braking force (i.e., a side force) developed by the front wheels become greater than those developed by the rear wheels.
      <br/>
      The application of braking effort to at least one of the front right and left wheels is, thus, effective in controlling the vehicle behavior.
      <br/>
      However, when the brake pedal 1 is not depressed by the vehicle operator, it is difficult for the pump 9 to suck the brake fluid from the primary chamber 2A of the master cylinder 2 to elevate the wheel cylinder pressure quickly because of flow resistance resulting from negative pressure developed in the primary chamber 2A.
      <br/>
      In order to avoid this problem, the pump 9 is connected to the master reservoir 3 through the branch line D2 to allow the pump 9 to suck the brake fluid out of the master reservoir 3 at a less flow resistance.
      <br/>
      The reason that the branch line D4 is not provided in the second hydraulic line E for the rear brakes is because braking of the rear wheels is not usually useful in controlling the vehicle behavior, and it is not essential to increase the pressure in the rear wheel cylinders 34 and 35 quickly as compared with the front brakes.

      The above described valves installed in the first and second hydraulic lines A and E are, as shown in FIG. 2, electrically controlled by an electronic control unit (ECU) 100. The ECU 100 consists essentially of a ROM, a RAM, an I/O interface, etc. and receives outputs of a lateral acceleration sensor 50, wheel speed sensors 60, and an M/C (master cylinder) pressure sensor 70 to provide control signals to the valves in the first and second hydraulic lines A and E. The lateral acceleration sensor 50 may be designed to measure the lateral acceleration acting on the vehicle body directly or alternatively implemented with a yaw rate sensor which measures the yaw rate of angular motion applied to the vehicle body.

      The wheel speed sensors 60 are provided, one for each of the front right and left wheels FR and FL and the rear right and left wheels RR and RL, and may be of an electromagnetic pickup type which outputs an electric signal as a function of speed of the wheel.

      For instance, the second greatest of the wheel speeds or a maximum wheel speed may be determined as the vehicle body speed using the known algorithm.
      <br/>
      In a case where a longitudinal acceleration sensor is installed in the vehicle, the vehicle body speed may be determined by integrating the longitudinal acceleration acting on the vehicle body.

      Alternatively, the vehicle body speed may be determined using a sensor capable of measuring an absolute speed of the vehicle body.

      The first is that the value of longitudinal acceleration acting on the vehicle body determined by an output of the sensor 50 or estimated mathematically is negative.

      In the first algorithm, the smallest of speeds of the four wheels is determined as the speed of the vehicle body.

      The reason that the first and second algorithms are used selectively depending upon the deceleration of the vehicle is because when the vehicle is decelerating, it may send any of the wheels into brake-caused skids so that the speeds of the skidding wheels become much smaller than the speed of the vehicle body, and conversely, when the vehicle is not decelerating, but accelerating, it may send any of the wheels into acceleration-caused skids so that the speeds of the skidding wheels become much greater than the speed of the vehicle body.

      If there is a wheel whose diameter is much smaller than any other wheels such as a temper tire-mounted wheel or a wheel whose tire inflation pressure is extremely lowered, the speed of that wheel is corrected to compensate for a difference in diameter between that wheel and the other wheels.

      The front state variable 1 is expressed in state 1 in the equation (10) below and calculated based on the front wheel state variable stateW1 and a vehicle state variable stateV1 derived by an output of a sensor which is installed directly on the vehicle body to measure behavior of the vehicle body (i.e., the lateral acceleration sensor 50).

      In step 910, a rear state variable 2 (=state2) is determined according to the equation (11) below.

      The front state variable state1 is a variable indicative of stability of a front portion of the vehicle body around the front right and left wheels.
      <br/>
      The rear state variable state2 is a variable indicative of stability of a rear portion of the vehicle body around the rear right and left wheels.
      <br/>
      The front and rear state variables state1 and state2 take smaller values when the stability is increased, while they take greater values when the instability is increased.

    <p num="97">
      In step 920, a weighting coefficient K1 used in a following step 940 is determined.
      <br/>
      The weighting coefficient k1 may be a constant value (K1=0.5) or changed within a range from 0 to 1.0 with a vehicle state such as understeer or oversteer or a state of a steering wheel.
      <br/>
      The weighting coefficient K1 is, as can be seen from the equation (13) below, a value for determining which of the front state variable state1 (i.e., the degree of stability of the front portion of the vehicle body) and the rear state variable state2 (i.e., the degree of stability of the rear portion of the vehicle body) is to be weighted in determination of a state parameter S1, as will be described later, for determining the instability of the vehicle.
      <br/>
      Thus, if K1 =0.5, the front state variable state1 and the rear state variable state2 are weighted equally.
    </p>
    <p num="98">
      The weighting coefficient K1 may alternatively be determined depending upon the acceleration or deceleration of the vehicle.
      <br/>
      For instance, in a case of a front engine front drive vehicle, the front wheels (i.e., driven wheels) are subjected to acceleration during acceleration of the vehicle.
      <br/>
      The weighting coefficient K1 is thus decreased (e.g., K1=0.2).
      <br/>
      During deceleration of the vehicle, the weight of the vehicle is shifted forward, thus causing the rear wheels (i.e., compliance wheels) to be locked more easily than the front wheels.
      <br/>
      The weighting coefficient K1 is thus increased (e.g., K1=0.8) to decrease the weight of the rear state variable state2.
      <br/>
      Specifically, the weighting coefficient K1 may be changed depending upon which of the front and rear wheels are driven wheels.
    </p>
    <p num="99">
      In step 930, the criterion P1 is determined.
      <br/>
      The criterion P1 may be a constant value (e.g., P1=2) or changed within a range of positive values with the state of the vehicle, steering, or braking.
      <br/>
      For instance, when the brake pedal 1 is depressed or when the baking effort of the engine is applied to the wheels, a difference in speed between the wheels tends to occur, which may result in an error of the control.
      <br/>
      In order to avoid this problem, the criterion P1 may be increased during braking.
      <br/>
      The criterion P1 may alternatively be changed with the coefficient of adhesion  MU  between tire and road surface.
      <br/>
      The coefficient of road-tire adhesion  MU  may be determined in a known manner or alternatively using an output of the lateral acceleration sensor 50.
      <br/>
      In a case where the output of the lateral acceleration sensor 50 is used, the criterion P1 is decreased as the lateral acceleration acting on the vehicle body is decreased and the coefficient of road-tire adhesion  MU  is decreased.
      <br/>
      This is because a difference in speed between the wheels will be decreased as the coefficient of road-tire adhesion  MU  is decreased, so that a range within in which the vehicle behavior is stable becomes narrower.
      <br/>
      The reason that the lateral acceleration acting on the vehicle body may be used in determining the coefficient of road-tire adhesion  MU  is because the lateral acceleration acting on the vehicle body bears a one-to-one correspondence to the lateral acceleration acting on each wheel until limits of the coefficients of road-tire adhesion  MU  of all the wheels are reached, so that the state parameter S1, as will be discussed later, is hardly increased up to the criterion P1 until at least one of the limits of the coefficients of road-tire adhesion  MU  is reached, however, if at least one of the wheels exceeds the limit of the coefficient of road-tire adhesion  MU  thereof, it will cause a difference between lateral accelerations acting on the vehicle body and that wheel to be developed, therefore, the lateral acceleration acting on the vehicle body (=the lateral acceleration acting on the wheels) at this time corresponds to the coefficient of road-tire adhesion  MU .

      Specifically, the state parameter S1 is determined in terms of the front and rear state variables state1 and state2 derived based on the wheel state variables and the vehicle state variables in steps 900 and 910.

      The instability of the whole of the vehicle body or vehicle behavior may be determined accurately by adding the instability of the front portion of the vehicle body and the instability of the rear portion of the vehicle body.

      If a YES answer is obtained, then the routine proceeds to step 990 wherein it is determined that the vehicle is in an unstable state as a whole.
      <br/>
      The reference value n1 may be changed with the state of braking of the vehicle and/or the coefficient of road-tire adhesion  MU .
      <br/>
      Specifically, the reference value n1 is increased as the criterion P1 is decreased, while it is decreased as the criterion P1 is increased.
      <br/>
      For instance, when the coefficient of road-tire adhesion  MU  is small, and the criterion P1 is also small, an increase in reference value n1 will cause a period of time until the routine proceeds to step 990 and determines the instability of the vehicle in step 990 to be prolonged, thereby avoiding an error in determination of the instability which would arise from the decrease of the criterion P1.
      <br/>
      It is advisable that the period of time until the determination of the instability of the vehicle be prolonged ten times or more.

      For instance, the wheel cylinder pressures for the front left wheel FL and the rear left wheel RL are increased at a rate  DELTA A. The rate  DELTA A may be changed with a running condition or a road surface condition which would cause the behavior of the vehicle to change.
      <br/>
      For instance, when the vehicle is steered rapidly or the coefficient of road-tire adhesion  MU  is low (e.g., during traveling on a snowy or icy road), the rate  DELTA A may be lowered to decrease the rate of pulse-increase or pulse-decrease in wheel cylinder pressure for avoiding rapid change in behavior of the vehicle accompanied by the termination of the control.
      <br/>
      Additionally, when the state parameter S2 is great or when the lateral acceleration acting on the vehicle body is great, the rate  DELTA A may be decreased to decrease the rate of pulse-increase or pulse-decrease in wheel cylinder pressure for avoiding an unwanted change in behavior of the vehicle immediately after the vehicle behavior becomes stable.

      Further, a roll of the vehicle body during cornering may be avoided by monitoring lifts of tires of the inside wheels and applying brakes to the outside wheels so as to suppress the lifts of the tires.
      <br/>
      One example of determination of the lifts of tires will be discussed below.
    </p>
    <p num="164">
      Usually, the outside wheels are applied with a load of the vehicle body during cornering so that they grip on the road and are stable in speed.
      <br/>
      The lifting of the inside wheels may, thus, be monitored by estimating the speed of the inside wheels based on the speed of the outside wheels and the lateral acceleration acting on the vehicle body to determine a change in speed of the inside wheels.
    </p>
    <p num="165">In practice, the change in speed of the inside wheels during cornering may be determined using the equations (26) to (28) below.</p>
    <p num="166">PTr=(VWFR+VWRR)-(VWFL+VWRL)  (26)</p>
    <p num="167">where PTr is a parameter which indicates a difference in speed between the inside and outside wheels during cornering and which is mathematically determined based on the measured speeds of the wheels.</p>
    <p num="168">PT=GY * A/(1+B * z-1)  (27)</p>
    <p num="169">
      where PT is a parameter which indicates a difference in speed between the inside and outside wheels during cornering and which is estimated by the lateral acceleration acting on the vehicle body, A and B are constants, z is a complex variable in the z-transform.
      <br/>
      The inside-outside wheel speed difference parameter PT is established with a first-order lag of the lateral acceleration in a transfer system.
      <br/>
      The equation (27), thus, uses a transfer function of the first-order lag.
    </p>
    <p num="170">Thus, if the inside wheels during cornering are the right wheels, the sum of speeds of the inside wheels VR(=VWFR+VWRR) may be expressed below from the equations (26) and (27).</p>
    <p num="171">VR=VWFR+VWRRVWFL+VWRLGY * A/(1+B * z-1)  (28)</p>
    <p num="172">
      If VR/2 is defined as an estimated inside wheel speed, and differences between the speed of the front inside wheel (i.e., the front right wheel) and the estimated inside wheel speed and between the speed of the rear inside wheel (i.e., the rear right wheel) and the estimated inside wheel speed are defined as tire lift parameters PFR and PRR for the front and rear inside wheels (i.e., the front right and rear right wheels), respectively, they are expressed as follows:
      <br/>
      PFR=.vertline.VWFR-VR/2.vertline.  (29)
      <br/>
      PRR=.vertline.VWRR-VR/2.vertline.  (30)
    </p>
    <p num="173">When either of the tire lift parameters PFR and PRR of the front and rear inside wheels exceeds a threshold value, the brakes applied to the wheels are controlled as described above so as to minimize the amount of lift of the wheel.</p>
    <p num="174">
      The relation between the speed of a wheel and the tire lift parameter of the wheel is shown in FIGS. 27(a) and 27(b).
      <br/>
      When any one of the inside wheels is lifted up from the road surface during cornering, that wheel, as indicated by a solid line in FIG. 27(a), hardly experiences a change in wheel speed.
      <br/>
      At this time, the tire lift parameter, as indicated by a solid line in FIG. 27(b), rises.
      <br/>
      When the tire lift parameter exceeds a threshold value, the braking effort is applied to either or both of the front and rear outside wheels to control the rolling of the vehicle body.
      <br/>
      It is advisable that the braking effort greater than that used in controlling the above described instability of behavior of the vehicle body be applied to the outside wheels.
    </p>
    <p num="175">
      The tire lift parameters PFR and PRR may alternatively be determined using the yaw rate of angular motion applied to the vehicle body.
      <br/>
      In this case, the inside-outside wheel speed difference parameter PT is also established with a first-order lag of the yaw rate in a transfer system and thus determined taking a transfer function of the first-order lag of the yaw rate into account.
      <br/>
      The use of the yaw rate in determining the tire lift parameters PFR and PRR offers the following advantage.
    </p>
    <p num="176">
      Each of the wheel speed sensors 60 is sensitive only to the direction of rotation of the wheel and cannot detect the lateral speed of the wheel in a side slip direction.
      <br/>
      Specifically, when the vehicle undergoes a side slip, the wheel speed sensors 60 are insensitive to rotational motion of the vehicle body, but a lateral acceleration signal outputted from the lateral acceleration sensor 50 contains a component of the side slip.
      <br/>
      Therefore, if VR is determined based on a difference between the sum of speeds of the outside wheels measured by the wheel speed sensors 60 and the lateral acceleration measured by the lateral acceleration sensor 50, it will cause the tire lift parameters PFR and PRR to have errors resulting from the side slip.
      <br/>
      In contrast, the yaw rate sensor is sensitive only to rotational motion (yawing) of the vehicle body, not the side slip, and the rotational motion of the vehicle body causes a difference in speed between the right and left wheels to occur.
      <br/>
      Outputs of the yaw rate sensor and the wheel speed sensors 60, thus, contain components indicative of the rotational motion of the vehicle body, thereby allowing the tire lift parameters PFR and PRR to be determined without the errors resulting from the side slip.
    </p>
    <p num="177">The control of the brakes applied to the wheels may be performed when it is determined in step 40 of FIG. 3 that the vehicle is in the unstable state and when it is determined that the amount of lift of any of the wheels exceeds the threshold value or alternatively only when the amount of lift of any of the wheels exceeds the threshold value regardless of the determination in step 40.</p>

      Therefore, the invention should be understood to include all possible embodiments and modifications to the shown embodiments which can be embodied without departing from the principle of the invention as set forth in the appended claims.

      For example, the front and rear wheel state variables stateW1 and stateW2 are determined in step 600 of FIG. 9 based on differences in speed between the front right and left wheels and between the rear right and left wheels, respectively, but they may alternatively be determined using differences in speed between the front right and rear left wheels and between the front left and rear right wheels, respectively, according to the equations (31) and (32) below.
      <br/>
      stateW1=(VWFRC-VWRLC) * VX/TR  (31)
      <br/>
      stateW2=(VWRRC-VWFLC) * VX/TR  (32)
    </p>
    <p num="180">
      In this case, the front state variable state1 will be a parameter indicating the state of the vehicle body in a diagonal direction from the front right to the rear left wheel.
      <br/>
      The rear state variable state2 will be a parameter indicating the state of the vehicle body in a direction from the front left to the rear right wheel.

      The lateral acceleration sensor 50 is implemented with the lateral G-sensor measuring the lateral acceleration acting on the vehicle body directly or the yaw rate sensor measuring the yaw rate of angular motion applied to the vehicle body, but the vehicle behavior control apparatus may be equipped with both the lateral G-sensor and the yaw rate sensor.
      <br/>
      In this case, the parameters stateV1 and stateV2 used in the equations (10) and (11) may be expressed as follows:
      <br/>
      stateV1=GY+Lf *  DELTA yr  (33)
      <br/>
      stateV2=GY-Lr *  DELTA yr  (34)

    <p num="182">where Lf and Lr indicate distances between the center of gravity of the vehicle body and the front axle and between the center of gravity of the vehicle body and the rear axle, respectively, and  DELTA yr is a differentiated value of the yaw rate.</p>
    <p num="183">The determination of instability using the state variables state1 and state2 calculated based on the above parameters stateV1 and stateV2 further increase the accuracy of the vehicle behavior control.</p>
    <p num="184">
      The behavior control apparatus of this invention may be used with a front drive vehicle equipped with two hydraulic lines: one extending from the front right wheel to the rear left wheel and the second extending from the front left wheel to the rear right wheel.
      <br/>
      In this case, the wheel cylinder 5 shown in FIG. 1 is provided for the rear left wheel RL, and the wheel cylinder 35 is provided for the front left wheel FL.
    </p>
    <p num="185">
      Actuators other than the brakes may also be controlled using the equations (26) to (30) and the tire lift parameters PFR and PRR.
      <br/>
      As one example of the actuators, vehicle occupant restraint devices such as an airbag for a vehicle operator or a front passenger or side airbags may be activated based on the tire lift parameters PFR and PRR.
      <br/>
      In this case, a transient status of the vehicle roll may be estimated using the determination of the tire lift.
      <br/>
      Specifically, when the tire lift is detected, it may be determined that there is a high possibility that the vehicle turns sideways to deploy the airbags.
    </p>
    <p num="186">FIG. 28 shows one example of such airbag control.</p>
    <p num="187">
      First, in step 1900, outputs of a roll rate sensor, the lateral acceleration sensor 50, and a steering sensor are monitored.
      <br/>
      The steering sensor can be of a known type designed to measure the angle of rotation of the steering shaft (i.e., the steering wheel).
      <br/>
      The roll rate sensor can also be of a known type installed in the vicinity of the center of gravity of the vehicle.
    </p>
    <p num="188">
      In step 1910, at least one state parameter is determined using at least one of the sensor outputs monitored in step 1900.
      <br/>
      For example, the roll rate of the vehicle is determined as the state parameter using the output of the roll rate sensor.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, the lateral acceleration (or the yaw rate) of the vehicle body may be determined as the state parameter using the output of the lateral acceleration sensor 50.
      <br/>
      The roll rate and the lateral acceleration (or the yaw rate) may alternatively be estimated using the vehicle speed (or the wheel speeds) and a steered angle of the steering wheel.
    </p>
    <p num="189">
      In step 1920, it is determined whether the state parameter is greater than or equal to a threshold value or not.
      <br/>
      If a NO answer is obtained, then the routine proceeds to step 1960 wherein the vehicle is not in the transient state of the roll.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, if a YES answer is obtained in step 1920, then the routine proceeds to step 1930 wherein the tire left parameters PFR and PRR are determined in the same manner as described above and wherein it is determined whether each of the tire lift parameters PFR and PRR exceeds a threshold value or not.
      <br/>
      If at last one of the tire lift parameters PFR and PRR is smaller than the threshold value meaning that at least one of the front and rear inside wheels during cornering of the vehicle is in contact with the road surface, then the routine proceeds to step 1960.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, if a NO answer is obtained in step 1930 meaning that the front and rear inside wheels are both lifted away from the road surface, then the routine proceeds to step 1940 wherein the vehicle is in the transient state of the roll.
      <br/>
      The routine proceeds to step 1950 wherein the airbags are deployed.
      <br/>
      Additionally, in step 1950, the brakes may also be applied to at least the front wheels to increase the slip ratio, resulting in a decrease in side force, which will cause the reactive force from the road surface acting on the outside wheels about which the vehicle rolls to be decreased for preventing the vehicle from turning sideways.
      <br/>
      When the vehicle operator is pressing the brake pedal 1, the brake pressure which is higher than the master cylinder pressure produced by the pedal effort may be applied to one of the front and rear wheels that is not lifted away from the road surface.
    </p>
    <p num="190">
      In step 1930, an additional determination may also be made as to whether the length of time between t1 and t2 in FIG. 27(b) either of the tire lift parameters PFR and PRR is greater than the threshold value (e.g., zero) exceeds a given interval or not.
      <br/>
      In this case, if YES answers to the two determinations are obtained in step 1930, then the routine proceeds to step 1940.
