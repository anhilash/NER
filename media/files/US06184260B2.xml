    <heading>BACKGROUND OF INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">
      The present invention relates generally to a method for making nanoporous silicone resins which are useful for forming low dielectric constant films.
      <br/>
      More specifically, the present invention in a preferred embodiment is a method for making a nanoporous silicone resin having a narrow pore size range by hydrosilating a hydridosilicon containing resin with a 1-alkene comprising about 8 to 28 carbon atoms to form an alkylhydridosiloxane resin, coating the alkylhydridosiloxane resin on a substrate, and heating the coated substrate to effect thermolysis of alkyl substituents comprising about 8 to 28 carbon atoms of the alkylhydridosiloxane resin to form a nanoporous silicone resin.

    <p num="3">
      Semiconductor devices often have one or more arrays of patterned interconnect levels that serve to electrically couple the individual circuit elements forming an integrated circuit (IC).
      <br/>
      These interconnect levels are typically separated by an insulating or dielectric film.
      <br/>
      Previously, a silicon oxide film formed using chemical vapor deposition (CVD) or plasma enhanced techniques (PECVD) was the most commonly used material for such dielectric films.
      <br/>
      However, as the size of circuit elements and the spaces between such elements decreases, the relatively high dielectric constant of such silicon oxide films is inadequate to provide adequate electrical insulation.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      In order to provide a lower dielectric constant than that of silicon oxide, dielectric films formed from siloxane-based resins have found use.
      <br/>
      An example of such films are those formed from poly(hydrogen)silsesquioxane resins as described for example in Collins et al., U.S. Pat. No 3,615,272 and Haluska et al. U.S. Pat. No. 4,756,977. While such films provide lower dielectric constants than CVD or PECVD silicon oxide films and also provide other benefits such as enhanced gap filling and surface planarization, typically the dielectric constants of such films are limited to approximately 3 or greater.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      It is well known that the dielectric constant of the above discussed insulating films is an important factor where IC's with low power consumption, cross-talk, and signal delay are required.
      <br/>
      As IC dimensions continue to shrink, this factor increases in importance.
      <br/>
      As a result, siloxane based resin materials and methods for making such materials that can provide electrically insulating films with dielectric constants below 3 are desirable.
      <br/>
      In addition it is desirable to have siloxane-based resins and method for making such resins that provide low dielectric constant films which have a high resistance to cracking.
      <br/>
      Also, it is desirable for such siloxane-based resins to provide low dielectric constant films by standard processing techniques.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      It is known that the dielectric constant of solid films decrease with a decrease in density of the film material.
      <br/>
      Therefore considerable work is being conducted to develop porous insulating films for use on semiconductor devices.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      Kapoor, U.S. Pat. No. 5,494,859, describes a low dielectric constant insulating layer for an integrated circuit structure and a method of making the layer.
      <br/>
      A porous layer is formed by depositing on a structure a composite layer comprising an insulating matrix material and a material which can be converted to a gas upon subjection to a converting process.
      <br/>
      Release of the gas leaves behind a porous matrix of the insulating material which has a lower dielectric constant than the composite layer.
      <br/>
      The matrix forming material is typically silicon oxide and the material which can be converted to a gas upon subjection to a converting process is exemplified by carbon.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      Hedrick et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,776,990, describe an insulating foamed polymer having a pore size less than about 100 nm made from a copolymer comprising a matrix polymer and a thermally decomposable polymer by heating the copolymer above the decomposition temperature of the decomposable polymer.
      <br/>
      The copolymers described are organic polymers that do not contain silicon atoms.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      Smith et al., WO 98/49721, describe a process for forming a nanoporous dielectric coating on a substrate.
      <br/>
      The process comprises the steps of blending an alkoxysilane with a solvent composition and optional water; depositing the mixture onto a substrate while evaporating at least a portion of the solvent; placing the substrate in a sealed chamber and evacuating the chamber to a pressure below atmospheric pressure; exposing the substrate to water vapor at a pressure below atmospheric pressure and then exposing the substrate to base vapor.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      Mikoshiba et al., Japanese Laid-Open Patent (HEI) 10-287746, describe the preparation of porous films from siloxane-based resins having organic substituents which are oxidized at a temperature of 250 (degree)  C. or higher.
      <br/>
      The useful organic substituents which can be oxidized at a temperature of 250 (degree)  C. or higher given in this document include substituted and unsubstituted groups as exemplified by 3,3,3-trifluoropropyl,  BETA -phenethyl group, t-butyl group, 2-cyanoethyl group, benzyl group, and vinyl group.
    </p>

Examples of R1 include methyl, ethyl, and phenyl.
      <br/>
      Hydridosilicon containing resins useful in the present process and their methods for preparation can be those described, for example in Collins et al. U.S. Pat. No. 3,615,272; Hanneman et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,063,267; and Bank et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,010,159; all of which are hereby incorporated by reference.
      <br/>
      Preferred is when the hydridosilicon containing resin is selected from the group of hydridosiloxane resins described by formulas (HSiO3/2)n, (H2 SiO)m, and (HSiO3/2)x (H2 SiO)y ; where n, m, x, and y are as described above.
      <br/>
      More preferred is when n is an integer within a range of about 100 to 1000, m is an integer within a range of about 100 to 1000, and x and y are each one or greater and x+y is within a range of 100 to 1000.
      <br/>
      Most preferred is when the hydridosilicon containing resin is a hydridosiloxane resin described by formula (HSiO3/2)n, where n is as described above and n is preferably within a range of about 100 to 1000.
    </p>
    <p num="21">
      It is preferred that the hydridosilicon containing resin be diluted in an organic solvent that is not detrimental to the hydrosilation reaction.
      <br/>
      The organic solvent can be generally any non-aromatic organic solvent that does not contain carbon-carbon unsaturated bonds and aromatic solvents.
      <br/>
      The organic solvent can be substituted or unsubstituted.
      <br/>
      Examples of useful organic solvents include alkanes such as dodecane, n-pentane, hexane, n-heptane, and isooctane; cycloalkanes such as cyclopentane and cyclohexane; aromatics such as benzene, toluene, xylene, and mesitylene; ketones such as methylisobutylketone; halogen substituted alkanes such as trichloroethane; and halogen substituted aromatics such as bromobenzene and chlorobenzene.
      <br/>
      Additionally, combinations of the above organic solvents may be used together as cosolvents for the hydridosilicon containing resin.
      <br/>
      The preferred organic solvents are aromatic compounds because of their high volatility, with toluene and mesitylene being most preferred because of their safety profile.
    </p>
    <p num="22">
      It is preferred that the hydridosilicon containing resin be diluted in the organic solvent at a weight percent within a range of about 5 to 60 weight percent of the solution comprising the resin and organic solvent.
      <br/>
      More preferred is when the hydridosilicon containing resin is diluted in the organic solvent at a weight percent within a range of about 10 to 30 weight percent on the same basis.
    </p>
    <p num="23">
      In the present method the hydridosilicon containing resin is contacted with a 1-alkene comprising about 8 to 28 carbon atoms.
      <br/>
      The 1-alkene can be straight chained or branched and may be substituted or unsubstituted.
      <br/>
      Substituted 1-alkenes include those for example having hydroxy substitution, 1-alkenes having acyloxy substitution such as described by formula CH2.dbd.CH(CH2)a OC(O)(CH2)b CH3, alkoxycarbonyl substitution such as described by formula CH2.dbd.CH(CH2)a C(O)O(CH2)b CH3, alkoxy substitution such as described by formula CH2.dbd.CH(CH2)a O(CH2)b CH3, carbonyl substitution such as described by formula CH2.dbd.CH(CH2)a (O)(CH2)b CH3, and cycloalkyl substitution such as described by formula CH2.dbd.CH(CH2)a R3 where R3 is a cycloalkyl group comprising about 5 to 10 carbon atoms, a &gt;= 0, b &gt;= 0, and the total number of carbon atoms in the substituted 1-alkene is within a range of about 8 to 28.
    </p>
    <p num="24">
      It is preferred that the 1-alkene be a branched 1-alkene since the present inventors have discovered that during thermolysis the resulting branched alkyl groups substituted on the alkylhydridosiloxane resin release lower molecular weight hydrocarbon components than then linear alkyl substitutions have a comparable number of carbon atoms and thus the thermolysis products are more easily removed from the cured nanoporous siloxane resins.
      <br/>
      Examples of 1-alkenes useful in the present process include 1-octene, 1-decene, 1-dodecene, 1-eicosene, 1-pentatricontene, and 3,7,11,15-tetramethyl-1-hexadecen-3-ol.
      <br/>
      It is preferred that the 1-alkene be an unsubstituted straight or branched chain molecule comprising 12 to about 20 carbon atoms or 3,7,11,15-tetramethyl-1-hexadecen-3-ol (isophytol), with isophytol being most preferred.
      <br/>
      Preferred is when the 1-alkene is selected from the group consisting of 1-eicosene, 1-dodecene, and 3,7,11,15-tetramethyl-1-hexadecen-3-ol.

    <p num="25">
      It is necessary in the present method that after the hydrosilation reaction at least about 45 percent of the silicon atoms remain substituted with at least one hydrogen atom to retain curing ability of the silicon resin.
      <br/>
      Generally, this amount of hydrogen atoms bonded to silicon atoms in the resin can be achieved by adding an amount of 1-alkene comprising about 8 to 28 carbon atoms to the present method such that the mole ratio of the 1-alkene to silicon-bonded hydrogen in the hydridosilicon containing resin is within a range of about 0.05:1 to 0.7:1, with a range of about 0.1:1 to 0.5:1 being preferred.

    <p num="26">
      The present method requires the presence of a platinum group metal-containing hydrosilation catalyst.

      The platinum group metal-containing hydrosilation catalyst can be any of those known in the art to effect a hydrosilation reaction between a silicon-bonded hydrogen atom and an unsaturated carbon-carbon bond.
      <br/>
      By "platinum group metal" it is meant ruthenium, rhodium, palladium, osmium, iridium, and platinum, with platinum being preferred.
      <br/>
      Examples of platinum group metal-contain catalysts which may be useful in the present invention are described for example in Willing, U.S. Pat. No. 3,419,593; Lee et al., U.S. Pat. No. 3,989,668; Chang et al., U.S. Pat. No 5,036,117; Ashby, U.S. Pat. No. 3,159,601; Lamoreaux, U.S. Pat. No. 3,220,972; Chalk et al., U.S. Pat. No. 3,296,291; Modic U.S. Pat.

No. 3,928,629 all of which are hereby incorporated by reference to show platinum group metal containing catalysts and methods for their preparation which may be useful in the present method.
      <br/>
      A preferred platinum group metal-containing catalyst is a complex of platinum with 1,3-diethenyl-1,1,3,3-tetramethyldisiloxane.
    </p>
    <p num="27">
      The amount of platinum group metal-containing catalyst useful in the present method is not narrowly limited as long as there is a sufficient amount present to accelerate a reaction between silicon-bonded hydrogen atoms and the 1-alkene comprising about 8 to 28 carbon atoms.
      <br/>
      The appropriate amount of the platinum group metal-containing catalyst will depend upon the particular catalyst used.
      <br/>
      In general as low as about 0.001 part by weight of platinum group metal for every million parts by weight of components present in Step (A), including any solvent when present, may be useful.
      <br/>
      Preferably the amount of platinum group metal is at least about 1 ppm on the same basis, with about 10 to 100 ppm being more preferred, and 20 to 60 ppm being most preferred.
    </p>
    <p num="28">
      The temperature at which the hydridosilicon containing resin is contacted with the 1-alkene comprising about 8 to 28 carbons is not critical as long as it does not effect significant gelation or curing of the alkylhydridosiloxane resin product.
      <br/>
      Generally the temperature can be within a range of about 20 (degree)  C. to 150 (degree)  C., with a temperature within a range of about 50 (degree)  C. to 100 (degree)  C. being preferred.
    </p>
    <p num="29">
      In step (A) of the present method an alkylhydridosiloxane resin is formed where at least 5 percent of the silicon atoms are substituted with at least one alkyl group comprising about 8 to 28 carbon atoms and at least 45 percent of silicon atoms are substituted with at least one hydrogen atom.
      <br/>
      Preferred is where about 10 to 25 percent of the silicon atoms are substituted with at least one alkyl group comprising about 8 to 28 carbon atoms and at least 70 percent of the silicon atoms are substituted with at least one hydrogen atom.
    </p>
    <p num="30">
      In step (B) of the present method the alkylhydridosiloxane resin of step (A) is heated at a temperature sufficient to effect thermolysis of alkyl groups comprising about 8 to 28 carbon atoms from the silicon atoms.
      <br/>
      The heating may be conducted as a single-step process or as a two-step process.
      <br/>
      In the two-step process the alkylhydridosiloxane resin is first heated at a temperature sufficient to effect curing without significant thermolysis of the alkyl groups comprising about 8 to 28 carbon atoms from the silicon atoms.
      <br/>
      Generally this temperature can be in a range of from about 20 (degree)  C. to 350 (degree)  C. Then, the cured silicone resin is further heated at a temperature within a range of greater than 350 (degree)  C. up to the lessor of the decomposition temperature of the silicon resin polymer backbone or R1 substituents (as described above) on the silicon atoms to effect thermolysis of the alkyl groups comprising about 8 to 28 carbon atoms from the silicon atoms.
      <br/>
      Generally, it is preferred that the thermolysis step be conducted at a temperature in a range of greater than 350 (degree)  C. to about 600 (degree)  C., with a temperature in a range of about 400 (degree)  C. to 550 (degree)  C. being most preferred.
      <br/>
      In the single-step heating process the curing of the silicone resin and thermolysis of the alkyl groups comprising about 8 to 28 carbon atoms are effected simultaneously by heating the alkylhydridosiloxane resin to a temperature within a range of greater than 350 (degree)  C. up to the lessor of the decomposition temperature of the silicone resin polymer backbone or R1 substituents on the silicon atoms.
      <br/>
      Generally, it is preferred that the single-step method of heating be conducted at a temperature in a range of greater than 350 (degree)  C. to about 600 (degree)  C., with a temperature in a range of about 400 (degree)  C. to 550 (degree)  C. being most preferred.
    </p>
    <p num="31">
      In the present method it is preferred that the heating of step (B) be conducted in an inert atmosphere.
      <br/>
      The inert atmosphere is useful because the presence of oxygen may oxidize Si-H bonds and cause the formation of silanol groups resulting in an increased dielectric constant (DK) for the resin.
      <br/>
      The inert atmosphere can be any of those known in the art, for example argon, helium, or nitrogen.

      The thermolysis of the alkyl groups comprising about 8 to 28 carbon atoms results in the formation of a nanoporous silicone resin.

      The nanoporous silicone resins formed by the present method are particularly useful as low dielectric films on electronic devices such is integrated chips.
      <br/>
      The silicon resins of the invention can generally be applied to the surface of electronic devices in the form of a dilute solvent solution by methods such as spin coating, dip coating, spray coating, or flow coating.
      <br/>
      The solvent is then allowed to evaporate by drying to form a homogeneous resin which is then heated as described above to cure and provide for a nanoporous silicone resin having a dielectric constant less than about preferably 2.5.
