    <heading>TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
    <p num="1">The present invention relates to a rubber composition, more specifically relates to a rubber composition superior in the properties required for applications such as footwear, conveyor belt covers, rolls, hoses, cables, rubberized fabrics, and grips, depending upon those applications and relates to footwear, conveyor belt covers, rolls, hoses, cables, rubberized fabrics, and grips which are formed by such a rubber composition in whole or part.</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND ART</heading>
    <p num="2">
      In recent years, various processed products formed from rubber or elastomers have been used in a wide variety of fields.
      <br/>
      These processed products use, as the starting materials, rubber compositions which are comprised mainly of rubber or elastomers and secondarily contain various types of fillers, additives, coloring agents, reinforcing agents, etc. so as to both secure the inherent properties of the rubber or elastomer and also impart or improve various properties required for the specific applications.
      <br/>
      In general, a rubber or elastomer alone cannot give the required reinforcement, and therefore, carbon black is compounded or formulated as a filler.
      <br/>
      However, silica etc. is sometimes compounded, together with the carbon black or in place of the carbon black, when the rubber product required is not black.
      <br/>
      For example, in the applications such as footwear, conveyor belt covers, rolls, hoses, cables, rubberized fabrics, grips, various colors are required, depending upon the applications.
    </p>
    <p num="3">
      However, rubber compositions containing silica, suffer from phenomena such as the increase in the viscosity, the scorching, the delayed vulcanization, when unvulcanized, which cause inferior processability or poor productivity.
      <br/>
      These unique phenomena in rubber compositions containing silica are believed to be due to the silanol groups present on the silica surface.
      <br/>
      That is, the increase in the viscosity is due to the cohesion of the silanol groups, which forms structural body in the rubber composition, whereby the viscosity is increased, the vulcanization accelerator etc. are adsorbed by the polarity of the silanol groups and, as a result, the vulcanization reaction is delayed, the performance in mixing is decreased due to the insufficient compatibility with the nonpolar rubber and, as a result, the processability of the unvulcanized rubber composition is decreased.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      Further, silane coupling agents are often used together with rubber compositions containing silica.
      <br/>
      However, silanol groups are also present in the internal cavities of the silica particles.
      <br/>
      These silanol groups are reacted with the silane coupling agent to cause a loss of the silane coupling agent and, as a result, the reinforcing effect is decreased.
      <br/>
      Therefore, there was the problem that a large amount of silane coupling agent had to be compounded.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      Various methods have been proposed in the past to solve these problems unique to rubber compositions containing silica.
      <br/>
      For example, methods have been proposed of adding a polar substance such as diethylene glycol or a fatty acid (see Rubber Industry Handbook, 4th edition; Tire Technology International 1995, p. 107 to 108; JP-A-6-248116, etc.).
      <br/>
      However, according to these methods, when the polar compounding agent such as diethylene glycol is added to the rubber composition, the adsorbing phenomenon of polar compounding agents such as vulcanization accelerator is prevented to a certain extent, but they cannot completely prevent it.
      <br/>
      They cannot prevent substances chemically bonding with silica such as the silane coupling agent from bonding in the internal cavities of the silica and, therefore, cannot be said to be methods which can be fully applied in practice to completely resolve all problems.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      Further, elimination of these problems inherent to rubber compositions containing silica and the realization of excellent properties in such rubber compositions depending upon the applications of the final products have been sought.
      <br/>
      For example, in rubber compositions used for the soles of footwear or portions of boots etc. exposed to harsh wear, a superior abrasion resistance of the vulcanizate is sought.
      <br/>
      Further, in rubber covers of conveyor belts, since abrasion occurs due to the carrying of the transported loads and cracks occur due to the flexing at the pulley portions, a superior abrasion resistance and crack resistance are sought.
      <br/>
      In rubber compositions used for rolls, due to the abrasion caused by carrying the transported iron metal, paper, etc. and the load due to the transported products, a superior abrasion resistance and bondability with iron metal of the vulcanizate are sought.
      <br/>
      In rubber compositions used for hoses, since the hoses expand due to the water pressure, oil pressure, etc. and the hoses contact each other or other objects, a superior modulus and abrasion resistance are sought.
      <br/>
      In rubber compositions used for coverings of cables, considering the lifetime of the products, a superior abrasion resistance is sought.
      <br/>
      Further, in rubber compositions used for rubberized fabric, in recent years abrasion resistance has been increasingly demanded even for rubberized clothing such as boat parkers.
      <br/>
      Further, even in the grips attached to the gripping portions of equipment or parts such as golf clubs, bicycles, motorcycles, agricultural machinery, due to the abrasion which occurs each time the user or worker grips them, abrasion resistance is sought in the rubber compositions for the grips as well.
    </p>

    <heading>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading>
    <p num="18">The present invention will now be explained with reference to the drawing, wherein FIG. 1 is a view for explaining the structure of a test hose used for measurement of the abrasion resistance of a rubber composition for a hose.</p>
    <heading>BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="19">The detailed explanation will now be given of the rubber composition for footwear, rubber composition for conveyor belt covers, rubber composition for rolls, rubber composition for hoses, rubber composition for cables, rubber composition for rubberized fabrics, and rubber composition for grips of the present invention (hereinafter these rubber compositions will be referred to all together as "the rubber compositions of the present invention" except when explaining these rubber compositions individually).</p>
    <p num="20">
      The present inventors found that, by blending a rubber composition having as essential ingredients (A) an elastomer, (B) a filler, and (C) a polysiloxane having the formula (I), it was possible to obtain a rubber composition superior in the processability in the unvulcanized state and the various physical properties of the vulcanizates and found that, by using a silane coupling agent in combination, it was possible to improve the abrasion resistance.
      <br/>
      Further, they engaged in intensive studies to find the proportions of the composition for satisfactorily obtaining the properties required for rubber compositions used for various applications and, as a result, found suitable rubber compositions for a rubber composition for footwear, rubber composition for conveyor belt covers, rubber composition for rolls, rubber composition for hoses, rubber composition for cables, rubber composition for rubberized fabrics, and rubber composition for grips, whereby the present invention was completed.
    </p>
    <p num="21">
      The elastomer (A) which is one of the essential ingredients of the rubber composition of the present invention is not particularly limited and may be any elastomer commonly used for various rubber compositions or may be suitably selected depending upon the application and the required properties etc.
      <br/>
      For example, diene elastomers, olefin elastomers, etc. may be mentioned.
      <br/>
      As specific examples of diene elastomers, natural rubber (NR), polyisoprene rubber (IR), polychloroprene rubber (CR), styrene-butadiene copolymer rubber (SBR), polybutadiene rubber (BR), acrylonitrile-butadiene copolymer rubber (NBR), butyl rubber (IIR), etc. may be mentioned.
      <br/>
      As specific examples of the olefin elastomers, ethylene-propylene copolymer rubbers (EPM, EPDM), ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer (EVA), ethylene-methacrylate copolymer (EMA), ethylene-methyl methacrylate copolymer (EMMA), etc. may be mentioned.
    </p>
    <p num="22">
      Further, the filler, which is the ingredient (B) of the rubber composition of the present invention may be, of course, general inorganic fillers (e.g., calcium carbonate, clay, talc, diatomaceous earth, mica, alumina, aluminum sulfate, barium sulfate, calcium sulfate, etc.) and further reinforcing agents such as carbon black, silica.
      <br/>
      In the present invention, as the filler, these may be used alone or in combination.
    </p>
    <p num="23">
      Among these, in particular, silica is poor in mixability and processability and therefore, the effect of improvement of the present invention is remarkable.
      <br/>
      As the silica used, hydrous silicic acid having a nitrogen specific surface area of 50 to 300 m2 /g used for rubber may be mentioned.
      <br/>
      As specific examples of the silica, Carplex (Shionogi &amp; Co.), Tokusil (Tokuyama Corp.), Starsil (Kamijima Kagaku), Silton (Mizusawa Industrial Chemicals Ltd.), Vulkasil (Bayer), Ultrasil (Degussa), etc. may be mentioned.
    </p>
    <p num="24">
      Further, in formula (I) showing the polysiloxane used as the ingredient (C) of the rubber composition of the present invention, R1 is a C1 to C18 substituted or unsubstituted monovalent hydrocarbon group which may have an ether bond.
      <br/>
      As the substituted or unsubstituted monovalent hydrocarbon group, for example, a methyl group, ethyl group, propyl group, pentyl group, hexyl group, stearyl group, etc. may be mentioned.
      <br/>
      Further, as the group having an ether bond, an ethoxyethyl group, butoxyethyl group, etc. may be mentioned.
      <br/>
      R2 is a hydrogen atom or a substituted or unsubstituted C1 to C18, preferably C2 to C18, hydrocarbon group, which may contain a heteroatom.
      <br/>
      As the C1 to C18 hydrocarbon group, for example, a methyl group, ethyl group, propyl group, or a residual group based on styrene,  ALPHA -methylstyrene,  ALPHA -methylstyrene dimer, chloromethylstyrene, acrylonitrile, acrylglycidyl ether, phenylglycidyl ether, limonene, isooctene, vinylcyclohexene, etc. may be mentioned.
      <br/>
      R3 is a methyl group or phenyl group.
      <br/>
      Further, m is an integer of 1 or more, while n is 0 or a positive integer. m+n is 3 or more, preferably 10 or more, in view of the boiling point of polysiloxane etc.
      <br/>
      In particular, those having 10 to 50 are easily available as a raw material.
      <br/>
      Further, in the polysiloxane used as the ingredient (C) in the present invention, a repeating unit having an OR group at the side chain is an essential constituent unit and at least one thereof should be present in the molecule.
      <br/>
      Further, repeating units having the groups R2 and R3 at the side chains are constituent units introduced, if necessary.
    </p>
    <p num="25">Further, the polysiloxane is a polymer or oligomer covering the surface of the silica particles and having, as a magnitude indicating the lubricating effect, an average degree of polymerization of 3 to 1000, preferably an average degree of polymerization of 10 to 1000.</p>
    <p num="26">
      In the rubber composition of the present invention, it is believed that, by adding this polysiloxane, the silanol groups of the silica contained in the rubber composition react with the polysiloxane so that the silica surface is covered with the polysiloxane.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the increase in the viscosity of the rubber composition due to the cohesion of the silanol groups is avoided and a composition having a lower viscosity than the conventional rubber compositions containing silica is obtained.
      <br/>
      Further, it is possible to avoid the phenomenon of the decrease in the mixing performance of the mixture due to the insufficient compatibility with nonpolar rubber resulting from the polarity of the silanol groups in conventional rubber compositions.
      <br/>
      That is, it is possible to improve the processability of the unvulcanized composition.
      <br/>
      Further, the vulcanization delay caused by the adsorption of the vulcanization accelerator etc, due to the polarity of the silanol groups is also improved.
      <br/>
      Further, it is possible to avoid loss of the silane coupling agent, explained below, due to the reaction with the silanol groups present in the internal cavities of the silica particles, and therefore, it is possible to decrease the amount of the silane coupling agent added.
    </p>
    <p num="27">The polysiloxane represented by the formula (I) may in general be synthesized, for example, by reacting an Si--H--group containing polysiloxane with an alcohol in the presence of a transition metal catalyst.</p>
    <p num="28">As the Si--H group containing polysiloxane, the following formulae may be mentioned:  (Chemical Structure image '3' not included in text)</p>
    <p num="29">Among these, in view of the inexpensive price, the use of methyl hydrogen polysiloxane is particularly preferred.</p>
    <p num="30">
      Further, as the alcohol usable as the reaction starting material, for example, methanol, ethanol, propanol, butanol, pentanol, heptanol, octanol, octadecanol, phenol, benzyl alcohol, etc. may be mentioned.
      <br/>
      Further, alcohols having oxygen atoms such as ethylene glycol monomethyl ether, diethylene glycol monomethyl ether, may be mentioned.
      <br/>
      Among these, from the viewpoint of the improvement in the processability, ethanol is particularly preferred.
    </p>
    <p num="31">
      Further, as the transition metal catalyst, for example, chloroplatinic acid, a platinum-ether complex, platinum-olefin complex, PdCl2 (PPh3)2, RhCl(PPh3)2, a mixture of CuO2 and Me2 NCH2 --CH2 NMe2, tin octylate, zinc octylate, etc. may be mentioned.
      <br/>
      Further, acidic and basic catalysts may be used.
    </p>
    <p num="32">
      Further, various types of organic groups may be introduced into the polysiloxane depending upon the type of the rubber.
      <br/>
