    <heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="1">The present invention relates to a method for processing a silver halide photographic light-sensitive material (hereinafter also referred to light-sensitive material), and particularly to a method for rapidly processing large sized light-sensitive material for graphic arts use by an automatic processor without formation of stain on the formed image.</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">
      Recently, photographic light-sensitive materials for graphic arts are often processed by an automatic processor combined with a laser image output apparatus, a so-called image-setter.
      <br/>
      The processed light-sensitive material outputting an image output by the image-setter is often used as a final original image for printing to a lithographic printing plate.
      <br/>
      Therefore, clear images become an important property of the processed light-sensitive material.
    </p>
    <p num="3">
      On the other hand, the exposure by the image-setter can be rapidly performed.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, it requires shortening the time for processing by raising the transportation speed of the automatic processor to respond to the speed of the exposing process.
      <br/>
      Some problems such as adhesion of stains of remaining color and formation of roller marks on the processed light-sensitive material and jamming of the light-sensitive material, are occurring during high speed transportation and processing to correspond to the output speed of the image-setter.
      <br/>
      Such problems are markedly produced in silver halide photographic light sensitive materials having an absorption maximum at the wavelength of 600 to 800 nm.
      <br/>
      Specifically in silver halide photographic light sensitive materials containing a compound represented by formulas (1) to (6), described below, such problems occur markedly.
    </p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="4">The object of the invention is to provide a method for processing a light-sensitive material for use in graphic arts by which the light-sensitive material can be processed without any problem such as formation of stain, residual color, unsuitable transportation and formation of roller marks even during the rapid processing so as to correspond to the output speed by the image-setter.</p>
    <p num="5">The object of the invention can be accomplished by the following constitution:</p>
    <p num="6">
      1.
      <br/>
      A method for processing a silver halide photographic light sensitive material in an automatic processor comprising the steps of:
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      - (a) developing an exposed silver halide photographic light sensitive material with a developing solution in the automatic processor,
      <br/>
      - (b) fixing the developed silver halide photographic material with a fixing solution in the automatic processor,
      <br/>
      - (c) washing the fixed silver halide photographic material with water in the automatic processor, and
      <br/>
      - (d) drying the washed silver halide photographic material in the automatic processor,
    </p>
    <p num="8">wherein the silver halide photographic material exhibits an absorption maximum at a wavelength of 600 to 800 nm; the automatic processor comprises at least a roller provided after completing the step of washing, the roller is brought into contact with the silver halide photographic material, and the surface of the roller is covered with a material exhibiting a contact angle with water( THETA ) of more than 0 (degree)  and less than 60 (degree)  (i.e., within the range of 0 (degree) &lt; THETA &lt;60 (degree) );</p>

    <heading>BRIEF EXPLANATION OF THE DRAWING</heading>
    <p num="17">
      FIG. 1 illustrates a contact angle according to an embodiment of the invention.
      <br/>
      FIG. 2 illustrates the film transport mechanism of an automatic processor used in the invention
    </p>
    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="18">It was discovered by the inventors that dye stains can be reduced by controlling the wetting property of the surface of the roller, and the residual color and transportation property are improved and the line-like marks (roller marks) on the surface of the light-sensitive material caused by the roller pressure are also inhibited by a means based on the assumption that dye stains of the processed light sensitive material relates to the behavior of the water derived from the light-sensitive material on the roller.</p>
    <p num="19">
      In cases where the light-sensitive material exhibited the absorption maximum at wavelengths of 600 to 800 nm, specifically, when the light-sensitive material contained a sensitizing dye represented by formula (1), (2), (3), (4), (5) or (6), dye stains were prominent.
      <br/>
      In the invention, such stains can be reduced by controlling the property of the roller which is directly in contact with the light-sensitive material (preferably, the roller provided between after the step of washing and before the step of drying, and more preferably, being a squeezing roller).
      <br/>
      Specifically, the present invention is characterized in that the surface of the roller is covered with a material exhibiting a contact angle with water ( THETA ) of between 0 (degree)  and 60 (degree)  (i.e., 0 (degree) &lt; THETA &lt;60 (degree) ).
    </p>
    <p num="20">
      The expression "after the step of washing" means downstream of the position at which supply of washing water to the light-sensitive material is finished.
      <br/>
      In cases where the processor has a transport rack in the drying step zone, the expression "before the step of drying" means at the front of the rack.
      <br/>
      In cases where the position of starting the drying step is not definitely specified by such a rack, the temperature of the light-sensitive material immediately after completion of washing is assumed to be  ALPHA  (degree)  C. and the position "before the step of drying" is to be the position immediately before the temperature in he vicinity of the light sensitive materials, preferably the temperature of the light-sensitive material reaches  ALPHA  plus 30 (degree)  C.
    </p>
    <p num="21">
      It is preferred that at least 80% of the surface of the roller (more preferably, at least 95%) is covered with a material exhibiting a contact angle with water satisfying the relationship of 0 (degree) &lt; THETA &lt;60 (degree) . The roller is preferably opposite roller type, comprising two rollers opposite to each other.
      <br/>
      The surface of one of the opposed rollers, which is brought into contact with the emulsion layer side of the light-sensitive material, is preferably covered with a material exhibiting a water contact angle ( THETA ) of 0 (degree) &lt; THETA &lt;60 (degree) , and more preferably, the surface of both of the opposite rollers is covered with material exhibiting a water contact angle ( THETA ) of 0 (degree) &lt; THETA &lt;60 (degree) .
    </p>
    <p num="22">
      Herein, a squeezing roller refers to a roller to squeeze washing water adhered to, or penetrated into the light-sensitive material after completion of washing.
      <br/>
      In general, the contact angle is defined as the angle ( THETA ) between a liquid and the surface of a solid material at the line of contact, as illustrated in FIG. 1.
      <br/>
      Thus, the contact angle with water (i.e., a water contact angle) means the angle of contact between water and the surface of the material.
    </p>
    <p num="23">Further, in addition to the roller (preferably, squeezing roller) provided between after the step of washing and before the step of drying, it is preferred that at least 80% of the surface of the first roller (or initial roller) during the drying stage is covered with a material exhibiting a contact angle ( THETA ) with water within the range of 0 (degree) &lt; THETA &lt;60 (degree) . It is more preferred that at least 80% of the surface of all of rollers provided in the drying step zone (preferably, all rollers of a transport rack during the drying step zone) is covered with a material exhibiting a water contact angle ( THETA ) within the range of 0 (degree) &lt; THETA &lt;60 (degree) .</p>
    <p num="24">
      An auxiliary roller which is brought into contact with the roller described above but not in contact with the light-sensitive material may be provided in the processor.
      <br/>
      Such an embodiment will be described later.
      <br/>
      Even in cases where the surface of a roller (preferably, a squeezing roller)provided between after the step of washing and before the step of drying is covered with a material exhibiting a water contact angle ( THETA ) of 0 (degree) &lt; THETA &lt;60 (degree) , the dye stains can be effectively inhibited by providing the auxiliary roller which is brought into contact with the roller described above but not in contact with the light-sensitive material itself.
    </p>
    <p num="25">
      The contact angle of the material of the roller surface can be usually controlled by selecting the chemical composition of the surface.
      <br/>
      For example, the contact angle with water is made larger when the critical surface tension at the roller surface is made smaller.
      <br/>
      Examples of the material effectively usable for controlling the critical surface tension include phenol resin (Bakelite), silicone rubber, rubber and fluorinated rubber.
      <br/>
      In the invention, a rubber roller having the surface treated with a water repellent resin.
      <br/>
      Examples of such the material include natural rubber (NR), isopropylene rubber (IR), polybutadiene rubber (BR), alphin rubber, styrene-butadiene rubber (SBR), high-styrene rubber, ethylene-propylene rubber (EPM, EPDM), chlorosulfonated polyethylene, butyl rubber (IIR), chloroprene rubber (CR), acrylonitrile-butadiene rubber (NBR), polysulfide rubber (T), aryl rubber (AM, ANM), silicone rubber (Si) and fluorinated rubber FPM).
      <br/>
      Among them, ethylene-propylene rubber, natural rubber and chloroprene rubber are particularly preferred.

      A dye which has two or more of the water-solubilizing groups capable of ionized in water with a pK value of from 4 to 11 is preferable.
      <br/>
      A dye which has two or more groups having a pK value of from 4 to 11 and one or more groups having a pK value of not more than 4 is particularly preferable since such the dye is excellent in the sensitizing ability and the stain caused by remaining thereof is small.
