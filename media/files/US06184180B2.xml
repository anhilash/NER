      Field of the Invention
    </p>
    <p num="2">This invention relates to reversible heat-sensitive recording materials in which formation of images and decolorization of the images can be carried out by controlling the heat energy.</p>
    <p num="3">2. Prior Art</p>
    <p num="4">
      Heat-sensitive recording materials generally comprise a support and, provided thereon, a heat-sensitive recording layer mainly composed of a normally electron donating colorless or slightly colored dye precursor and an electron accepting color developer.
      <br/>
      The dye precursor and the color developer instantaneously react upon application of heat by thermal head, thermal pen, laser beams or the like to form an image.
      <br/>
      Such heat-sensitive recording materials are disclosed in Japanese Patent Application Kokoku Nos. 43-4160, 45-14039 and the like.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      In general, in the case of these heat-sensitive materials, when an image is once formed, it is impossible to erase the image to restore the portion to the original state.
      <br/>
      Therefore, for further recording of information, it is only possible to make recording in the portions where no image is formed.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, the area for heat-sensitive recording is limited and the information to be recorded is restricted and not all of the necessary information can be recorded.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      Recently, reversible heat-sensitive recording materials capable of repeating the formation of images and the decolorization of the images have been proposed for solving the above problems.
      <br/>
      For example, Japanese Patent Application Kokai Nos. 54-119377, 63-39377, 63-41186 and the like, disclose dispersed in the matrix resin.
      <br/>
      However, in these recording materials, the transparency of the recording materials is reversibly changed and so the contrast between the imaged portion and the unimaged portion is insufficient.
    </p>
    <p num="7">Furthermore, according to the methods described in Japanese Patent Application Kokai Nos. 50-81157 and 50-105555, since the images formed by these methods change depending on the environmental temperatures, the temperature at which the image-formed state is maintained differs from the temperature at which the image-erased state is maintained and so these two states cannot be maintained for a desired period at room temperature.</p>
    <p num="8">
      Further, Japanese Patent Application Kokai No. 59-120492 mentions a method for maintaining the image-formed state and the image-erased state by keeping the recording material in the region of the hysteresis temperature utilizing the hysteresis characteristics of color forming components.
      <br/>
      However, this method has the defects that a heating source are needed for formation and decolorization of images and besides, the temperature region at which the image-formed state and the image-erased state can be maintained is limited to the region of the hysteresis temperature.
      <br/>
      Thus, this method is still not sufficient for using the materials in the temperature environment of daily life.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      In addition, Japanese Patent Application Kokai Nos. 2-188293 and 2-188294 and International Patent Publication No. WO90/11898 disclose reversible heat-sensitive recording media comprising a leuco dye and a color developing and decolorizing agent which causes color formation of the leuco dye upon heating and causes decolorization of the color.
      <br/>
      The color developing and decolorizing agents are amphoteric compounds having an acidic group which causes color formation of the leuco dye and a basic group which causes decolorization of the leuco dye and they preferentially cause one of the color formation action of the acidic group and the decolorization action of the basic group by controlling the heat energy, thereby to perform the color formation and decolorization.
      <br/>
      However, according to this method, it is impossible to completely exchange the color forming reaction and the decolorizing reaction from each other only by control of heat energy and since both the reactions simultaneously take place at a certain ratio, sufficient color density cannot be obtained and besides the decolorization cannot completely performed.
      <br/>
      For this reason, a sufficiently high contrast of the image cannot be obtained.
      <br/>
      Moreover, since the decolorizing action of the basic group acts also on the color formed portion at room temperature, the density of the color formed portion inevitably decreases with time.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      Furthermore, in Japanese Patent Application Kokai No. 5-124360, reversible heat-sensitive recording media which can form images and erase images by heating a leuco dye is described, and as an electron-receiving compound (reversible color developing agent), there are exemplified an organic phosphoric acid compound,  ALPHA -hydroxyaliphatic carboxylic acid, aliphatic dicarboxylic acid and a specific phenol compound such as an alkylthiophenol, an alkyloxyphenol, an alkylcarbamoylphenol, alkyl gallate each having a carbon number of 12 or more, etc.
      <br/>
      However, in this recording media, coloring density is low or decolorization of images becomes incomplete so that the two problems cannot be solved simultaneously and image stability with time is also not practically satisfied.
      <br/>
      Moreover, in Japanese Patent Application Kokai No. 5-294063, as a decolorization promoting agent for improving decolorizability of the above-mentioned reversible heat-sensitive recording media, there are described an aliphatic acid derivative, wax, higher alcohol, respective esters of phosphoric acid/benzoic acid/phthalic acid or oxy acid, silicone oil, liquid crystal compound, surfactant and aliphatic acid saturated hydrocarbon having 10 or more carbon atoms or the like, but these effects are small so that it cannot be said that it can be practically used since an image density at the time of erasing is yet high.
    </p>
    <p num="11">
      Recently, in Japanese Patent Application Kokai No. 10-67726, as a reversible color developing agent, a phenol compound having a long chain alkyl group in which specific connecting groups are combined is exemplified and a contrast of color forming and color erasing has been improved.
      <br/>
      However, even when the reversible color developing agent is used, stability of the recorded image with a lapse of time is not satisfied.
      <br/>
      And yet, there is a problem that a sufficient color forming density cannot be obtained depending on a leuco dye to be used in combination.
    </p>
    <p num="12">On the other hand, the present inventors have found reversible color developing agents which have a high possibility for practical use as proposed in Japanese Patent Applications Kokai No. 6-210954 and No. 7-179043. However, even when these agents are used, there is much room for further improvement in the points of obtaining stability of the above recording image with a lapse of time or a sufficient color forming density irrespective of the kind of the leuco dyes.</p>
    <p num="13">As explained above, according to the conventional technique, there have been no reversible heat-sensitive recording materials which can give good image contrast, can form images and erase the images and can maintain images having time stability under the daily environment.</p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>

    <heading>DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
    <p num="19">
      In the compound represented by the formula (I), R1 and R2 each represent a divalent hydrocarbon having 1 to 18 carbon atoms, R1 is preferably a divalent hydrocarbon group having 1 to 11 carbon atoms, and R2 is preferably a divalent hydrocarbon group having 2 to 11 carbon atoms.
      <br/>
      R3 represents a hydrocarbon group having 1 to 24 carbon atoms, preferably a hydrocarbon group having 6 to 11 carbon atoms.
      <br/>
      Moreover, it is more preferred that the total carbon atoms of R1, R2 and R3 are 11 to 30, and particularly preferably that they are aliphatic hydrocarbon groups having the total carbon atoms of 11 to 30.
      <br/>
      The sum of the carbon atoms relates to a color forming property, a color erasing property and an image storage property.
      <br/>
      If the sum of the carbon atoms is less than 11, a color forming property is good but a color erasing property and an image storage property tend to be worse, while if the sum of the carbon atoms is more than 30, a color erasing property and image an image storage property are good but a color forming property is tend to be worse.
      <br/>
      Thus, if the total carbon atoms are within the above range, the resulting recording material is well-balanced without impairing a contrast of color forming and color erasing and an image storage property.
      <br/>
      R1, R2 and R3 each specifically represent an alkylene group or an alkyl group, and an aromatic ring may be contained in the respective groups, particularly in the case of R1 and R2, they may comprise aromatic rings alone.
    </p>
    <p num="20">
      Also, X1 in the formula (I) represents a divalent group having at least one --CONH-- bond, and specific examples thereof may include an amide (--CONH--, --NHCO--), urea (--NHCONH--), urethane (--NHCOO--, --OCONH--), diacylamine (--CONHCO--), diacylhydrazide (--CONHNHCO--), oxalic acid diamide (--NHCOCONH--), acyl urea (--CONHCONH--, --NHCONHCO--), 3-acylcarbazinic acid ester (--CONHNHCOO--), semicarbazide (--NHCONHNH--, --NHNHCONH--), acylsemicarbazide (--CONHNHCONH--, --NHCONHNHCO--), diacylaminomethane (--CONHCH2 NHCO--), 1-acylamino-1-ureidomethane (--CONHCH2 NHCONH--, --NHCONHCH2 NHCO--), malonamide (--NHCOCH2 CONH--) and the like.
      <br/>
      Of these, as X1, urea, diacylhydrazide, oxalic acid diamide, acylsemicarbazide and diacylaminomethane are preferred.
      <br/>
      Moreover, X2 represents an oxygen atom or a sulfur atom, and due to easiness in preparation, a sulfur atom is preferred.

    <p num="21">
      The compound represented by the formula (I) is an electron-accepting compound, and has an ability of color-forming a leuco dye and also has specifically a color erasing effect, i.e., a reversible effect.
      <br/>
      Incidentally, in an electron-accepting compound which has been used in the usual heat-sensitive recording material such as 2,2-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)propane, bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)sulfone, 4-hydroxybenzoic acid benzyl, etc., such a reversible effect is never observed.

      Next, a method of forming a color and erasing a color of the reversible heat-sensitive recording material of the present invention is described.
      <br/>
      The color formation can be brought about when a rapid cooling occurs subsequent to the heating and it is possible by heating using, for example a thermal head, a laser beam light, etc.
      <br/>
      Also, the decolorization can occur when the cooling rate after the heating is slow.
      <br/>
      It can be carried out by using light sources such as thermal head, hot roll, hot stamping, high frequency heating, hot air, electrical heater, radiant heat from a light source such as tungsten lamp or halogen lamp, hot air or the like.
    </p>
    <p num="82">
      The principle of the image forming and erasing of the reversible heat-sensitive recording material of the present invention is not yet clear, but the following can be expected.
      <br/>
      A dye precursor which is generally colorless or pale color is heated with an electron-accepting compound such as a phenolic compound, movement in electron from the dye precursor to the electron-accepting compound occurs and a color is formed.
      <br/>
      At this time, the electron-accepting compound is considered to present at extremely close to the colored dye molecule.
      <br/>
      Also, when the electron-accepting compound is separated from the colored dye molecule, the colored dye molecule accepts an electron again to become the state of the dye precursor before coloring.
      <br/>
      The present invention is considered to change the distance between the electron-accepting compound molecule and the dye molecule by heating and to carry out color formation and decolorization.
    </p>
    <p num="83">
      When the above is described in more detail, a large number of the conventionally known electron-accepting compound which is called to as a reversible color developing agent has an aliphatic chain in the structure so that it can be considered that it is less compatibility with the dye precursor molecule and the colored dye molecule so that it is hardly dissolved at the coagulated state.
      <br/>
      Also, when the dye precursor molecule and the reversible color developing agent molecule are in a freely movable state as in the melted state, the dye precursor molecule and the reversible color developing agent molecule are each dissolved with a certain ratio and become a colored state.
      <br/>
      Therefore, when the mixture at the color-forming and melting state is gradually cooled, as the temperature lowers, the reversible color developing agent molecule and the dye precursor molecule become the state of not dissolving with each other to cause phase separation and discolored.
    </p>
    <p num="84">
      The reversible color developing agent represented by the formula (I) to be used in the present invention contains, in particular, a bond having an ability of causing a hydrogen bond such as an amide bonding in the molecule, so that it rapidly crystallizes by the intramolecular hydrogen bond.
      <br/>
      At the crystallized state, these molecules are stabilized by the hydrogen bonding group such as the amide bonding group, etc., and the phenolic hydroxyl group which is a color forming site also forms a stable intramolecular hydrogen bond so that a more stable crystal, i.e., a decolorized state is formed.
      <br/>
      On the other hand, when the mixture in a fused state is rapidly cooled, crystallization after phase separation cannot accompany by the temperature change and it solidifies at the colored state so that the colored state is fixed and the colored state is stably maintained after solidification, i.e., after cooling.
      <br/>
      In the reversible color developing agent of the present invention, the distance between the phenolic hydroxyl group which is a color forming site and the specific hydrogen bonding group existing the amide bonding group is separated with a certain extent so that the degree of freedom at the color forming site is increased whereby the color forming ability becomes high.
      <br/>
      The reason why the color can be decolorized within a short period of time in spite of the high color forming ability can be considered that the specific hydrogen bonding group such as the amide bonding group forms a hydrogen bond with a certain extent even when it is in a colored state.
    </p>
    <p num="85">
      The decolorization promoting agents represented by the formulae (II) to (IX) to be used in the present invention have an aliphatic chain in the molecule as in the reversible color developing agent represented by the formula (I) so that they have compatibility with the reversible color developing agent.
      <br/>
      The decolorization promoting agents generally have a low melting point than the reversible color developing agent whereby the decolorization phenomenon is more accelerated.
