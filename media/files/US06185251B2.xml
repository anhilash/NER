      The present invention provides an optimal procedure for determining in the time domain equalizer coefficients for an equalizer, where the equalizer compensates for the effects of the communications channel on the transmitted signal.
      <br/>
      A unit pulse is transmitted over the communications channel, and a channel impulse response is estimated from the received signal.
      <br/>
      A cost function establishes a mean-square error associated with the estimated channel impulse response as compared to a desired impulse response signal.
      <br/>
      The value of the cost function varies based upon an offset value between the estimated channel impulse response and an equalized channel impulse response.
      <br/>
      Values of the cost function are determined for different offsets, and the offset that produces the smallest cost function value (corresponding to the minimum mean-square error) is selected.
      <br/>
      The optimal equalizer coefficients are then calculated using the selected offset and the established cost function.
      <br/>
      In a preferred embodiment, the invention is applied to multicarrier modulation systems.
      <br/>
      Moreover, the cost function is defined as a krakovian function that depends on the offset value.
      <br/>
      That krakovian function includes a first krakovian which uses the channel impulse response and a second krakovian which uses the autocorrelation of the channel impulse response.
      <br/>
      Using the first and second krakovians and the selected offset corresponding to the minimal value of the established cost function, the optimal equalizer coefficients are determined in a straightforward, one step calculation.

    <heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="1">The present invention relates to equalization, and more particularly, for equalizers used in multicarrier modulation systems.</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND AND SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">
      Asymmetric high speed Digital Subscriber Line (ADSL) and Very high speed Digital Subscriber Line (VDSL) are examples of modern communication systems which permit transmission of data over communication lines at very high rates, e.g., up to 52 Mbits/s.
      <br/>
      One example of a high speed data application is video on demand.
      <br/>
      The transmission of high-speed data over band-limited channels may be accomplished through the use of DMT-based, digital communications systems.
      <br/>
      DMT modems follow the general principle of transmitting data by is dividing it into several interleaved bit streams, and using these bit streams to modulate several carriers.
    </p>
    <p num="3">
      A significant limitation in high data rate communication systems is intersymbol interference (ISI).
      <br/>
      One way to compensate for ISI in a DMT system is to add a cyclic prefix (guard time) to the beginning of each transmitted DMT symbol.
      <br/>
      Unfortunately, while increasing the length of prefixes reduces ISI, it also decreases the effective data rate.
      <br/>
      Another approach to combating ISI is to employ an equalizer at the receiver, but many equalizers require considerable and ongoing computation "overhead." There is a need, therefore, to keep the cyclic prefix length as small as possible and still compensate for ISI using an equalization technique that does not require complicated and ongoing computations.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      For purposes of this application, equalization is the process of correcting or compensating for the ISI caused by the communications channel.
      <br/>
      In practical communications, the frequency response of the channel is not known.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, an equalizer is designed using numerous parameters that must be adjusted on the basis of measurements of a channel's signal-affecting characteristics.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      A transversal filter having a delay line with taps spaced by T-seconds (where T is the sampling interval and fs =1/T is the sampling rate at the receiver) is a common choice for an equalizer.
      <br/>
      The outputs of the filter taps are multiplied by a filter coefficient, summed, and fed to a decision device.
      <br/>
      The tap coefficients correspond to the channel parameters and represent to some extent a "model" of the channel.
      <br/>
      If the coefficients are properly selected, the equalizer significantly attenuates or practically removes the interference from symbols that are adjacent in time to the desired symbol.
      <br/>
      The selection of the coefficient values is typically based on minimization of either peak distortion or mean-squared distortion.
      <br/>
      The coefficients are selected so that the equalizer output is forced towards zero at N sample points on either side of the desired pulse.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      There are two general types of automatic equalization.
      <br/>
      The first equalization approach transmits a training sequence that is compared at the receiver with a locally-generated or otherwise known training sequence.
      <br/>
      The differences between the two sequences are used to set the equalizer filter coefficients.
      <br/>
      In the second approach, commonly referred to as adaptive equalization, the coefficients are continually and automatically adjusted directly from the transmitted data.
      <br/>
      A drawback of adaptive equalization is its computational "cost" involved in continually updating the filter coefficients so that the channel model is adapted to the current conditions of the channel.
      <br/>
      Equalizer coefficient computational methods employing adaptive algorithms such as the least mean square (LMS) or recursive least square (RLS) are computationally expensive.
      <br/>
      At a very high sampling rate for high data rate communications system, this kind of continual LMS updating of the equalizer filter coefficients is particularly expensive.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      The present invention seeks to reduce both computational cost and cyclic extension, but at the same time effectively equalize received signals to compensate for ISI using a short length equalizer.
      <br/>
      For many communication applications, such as VDSL and ADSL, the communications channel does not change that much during a particular transmission.
      <br/>
      In this context of relative "constant" channel conditions, it is satisfactory to estimate the channel coefficients during an initial training sequence before the message is transmitted without thereafter adjusting the filter coefficient values during the transmission.
      <br/>
      Of course, it may be necessary to monitor channel quality during the transmission, and if channel quality decreases below a certain threshold, the equalizer coefficients could then be updated.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      The present invention provides an optimal procedure for determining in the time domain equalizer coefficients for an equalizer, where the equalizer compensates received signals that are distorted by passing through the channel.
      <br/>
      A unit pulse is transmitted over the communications channel, and a channel impulse response is estimated from the received signal.
      <br/>
      A cost function establishes a mean-square error associated with the unequalized channel impulse response as compared to a desired impulse response signal.
      <br/>
      The value of the cost function varies based upon an offset value between the estimated channel impulse response and an equalized channel impulse response.
      <br/>
      Values of the cost function are determined for different offsets, and the offset that produces the smallest cost function value (corresponding to the minimum mean-square error) is selected.
      <br/>
      The optimal equalizer coefficients are then calculated using the selected offset and the established cost function.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      In a preferred embodiment, the invention is applied to multicarrier modulation systems.
      <br/>
      Moreover, the cost function is defined as a krakovian function that depends on the offset value.
      <br/>
      That krakovian function includes a first krakovian which uses the channel impulse response and a second krakovian which uses the autocorrelation of the channel impulse response.

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="12">
      In the following description, for purposes of explanation and not limitation, specific details are set forth, such as particular modulation/demodulation techniques, applications, protocols, etc. in order to provide a thorough understanding of the present invention.
      <br/>
      For example, the present invention is described in the context of a multicarrier modulation digital communications system in which krakovian algebra is used to facilitate calculation of optimal equalizer coefficients.
      <br/>
      However, it will be apparent to one skilled in the art that the present invention may be practiced in other embodiments that depart from such specific details.
      <br/>
      In other instances, detailed descriptions of well-known methods, protocols, devices, and circuits are omitted so as not to obscure the description of the present invention with unnecessary detail.
    </p>
    <p num="13">Multicarrier Modulation System</p>
    <p num="14">
      FIG. 1 shows an example Discrete Multitone (DMT) communication system in which the present invention may be employed.
      <br/>
      In a Discrete Multitone system, in general, the input bit stream is first serial-to-parallel converted.
      <br/>
      The parallel output is then grouped into N groups of bits corresponding to the number of bits per symbol.
      <br/>
      Portions of bits are allocated to each DMT carrier.
    </p>
    <p num="15">
      More specifically, transmitter 100 includes a serial-to-parallel converter 140, a multicarrier modulator 160, and a pretransmit processor 180.
      <br/>
      Receiver 120 includes a post channel processor 200, a multicarrier demodulator 220, and a parallel-to-serial converter 240.
      <br/>
      The transmitter and receiver are linked in this example by a digital subscriber line (DSL) or other form of communication channel 260.
      <br/>
      Serial input data at a rate of btotal /Tsymb bits per second are grouped by converter 140 into blocks of btotal bits for each multicarrier symbol, with a symbol period of Tsymb.
      <br/>
      The btotal bits in each multicarrier symbol are used to modulate N separate carriers in modulator 160 with bi bits modulating the i-th carrier.
    </p>
    <p num="16">
      Preferably, an Inverse Discrete Fourier Transform (IDFT) is used as a DMT modulator to generate Ns time-domain samples of a transmit signal for each block of btotal bits, where Ns is preferably equal to twice the number of modulated carriers, i.e., 2N. The corresponding multicarrier demodulator performs a Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT), where bi bits are recovered from the i-th sub-carrier.
      <br/>
      As depicted in FIG. 2, the carriers or subchannels in a DMT system are spaced 1/T Hz apart across N/T Hz of the frequency band.
      <br/>
      More detailed discussion of the principles of multicarrier transmission and reception is given by J. A. C. Bingham in "Multicarrier Modulation for Data Transmission: An Idea Whose Time Has Come", IEEE Communications Magazine, Volume 28, Number 5, pp. 5-14, May 1990.

      <br/>
      Adding the cyclic prefix is a discrete-time technique used to eliminate ISI in the DMT system.
      <br/>
      However, as described in the background, it is desirable to minimize the length of the prefix in order to maximize data throughput assuming the receiver equalizer can effectively remove or otherwise compensate for ISI.
      <br/>
      The independent modulating and demodulating vectors are the IDFT and the DFT given by the following general relationships:  (Equation image '1' not included in text)

    <p num="18">
      A DMT system with N channels for transmitting complex data requires a DFT size of 2N because of forced Hermite symmetry in the frequency domain.
      <br/>
      The Hermite symmetry is necessary in order to obtain real-valued samples in the time domain.
      <br/>
      In a preferred embodiment, IDFT and DFT are implemented using IFFT and FFT algorithms using, for example, an approach disclosed in commonly-assigned "Method and Apparatus for Efficient Computation of Discrete Fourier Transform and Inverse Discrete Fourier Transform," U.S. patent application Ser.

      FIG. 3 is a block diagram showing the principal operative components of a basic DMT transmitter 30 and a basic DMT receiver 32 connected through a channel 34.
      <br/>
      Serial input data are grouped into blocks, converted to a parallel form, and appropriately encoded by an encoder 36.
      <br/>
      Each one of the N active subchannels contains a number of bk bits allocated to that subchannel.
      <br/>
      The total number of bits in a DMT symbol is therefore:  (Equation image '2' not included in text)
    </p>
    <p num="20">
      Each of the N bit groups is mapped by the symbol into a two-dimensional signal constellation.
      <br/>
      The relation between the number of bits in each block of bits bk and the necessary number of signal points in a constellation M is given by:
      <br/>
      Mk =2bk   (4)
    </p>
    <p num="21">
      The signal points in a constellation are typically arranged in a rectangular pattern for even values of bk and a cross for odd values of bk.
      <br/>
      Provided that the same signal energy is used for all constellations, the distance between neighboring signal points is reduced with increasing constellation size resulting in increased BER with the same signal-to-noise ratio (SNR).
    </p>
    <p num="22">
      The output from the encoder is N complex numbers, one for each group of bits, which are then fed to a device that calculates the Inverse Discrete Fourier Transform (IDFT).
      <br/>
      The output is a real sequence that can be considered the superimposing of N modulated orthogonal carriers spaced  (Equation image '3' not included in text)
    </p>
    <p num="23">
      The parallel IFFT output is converted back to a serial data stream by a converter 40.
      <br/>
      The digital modulated data stream is cyclically prefixed, converted to analog form by a digital-to-analog converter (DAC) 42, low-pass filtered at 44, and passed through a splitter filter and D.C. isolating transformer 46 during pre-transmit processing to produce an analog signal transmitted over a transmission channel 34.
    </p>
    <p num="24">
      At the receiver, the received analog signal is passed through a D.C. isolating transformer and low-pass filter 48, converted to digital form by an analog-to-digital converter (ADC) 50, time domain pre-equalized by a finite impulse response (FIR) filter 52 to limit the effective memory of the channel, and stripped of the cyclic prefix during post-receive processing in converter 54.
      <br/>
      The resulting digital signals are demodulated by 2N FFT operation 56 and converted to parallel frequency domain signals.
      <br/>
      Since the amplitude vs. frequency and the delay vs. frequency responses of the channel are not necessarily constant across the entire frequency band, the received signal differs from the transmitted signal, and the parallel inputs to the frequency domain equalizer (FEQ) 58 differ from the parallel outputs from the encoder 36.
      <br/>
      It is the task of the FEQ 58 to compensate for these differences.
      <br/>
      The equalized signals can then be properly decoded and converted back to a serial form by the decoder 59.
      <br/>
      Ideally, the detected output serial data from the decoder 59 is the same as the input serial data to the encoder 36.
    </p>
    <p num="25">
      The preferred example embodiment of the present invention employs a Time Domain Equalizer (TEQ) 52 which shortens the overall channel impulse response and therefore reduces ISI.
      <br/>
      The present invention finds particular advantageous application in the training of the time domain equalizer 52.
      <br/>
      During a training mode of operation, a switch 51 is actuated (for example by a general data processor controlling the receiver) to connect the output of the analog-to-digital converter 50 to an equalizer filter coefficients processor 53 which calculates optimal TEQ coefficient values for a particular communications channel.
      <br/>
      Those optimal values are used to set the coefficients in equalizer 52.
      <br/>
      After training, the switch 51 is moved to directly connect the sampled output from the ADC to the equalizer 52 for operation in the normal equalization mode.
    </p>
    <p num="26">
      FIG. 4 illustrates the equalizer 52 in additional detail.
      <br/>
      In the training mode, the received sampled signal xn is routed to the equalizer filter coefficients processor 53 for calculation of the filter coefficients TEQ0, TEQ1, . . . TEQK-2, and TEQK-1 in accordance with calculation procedures described in detail below.
      <br/>
      The equalizer 52 is essentially a transversal filter corresponding to a delay line with z-1 symbol taps, where z-1 corresponds to a sampling interval T. The tapped signals are weighted or multiplied by a corresponding filter coefficient value TEQ in a corresponding multiplier.
      <br/>
      The multiplier products are summed and output as yn.
      <br/>
      The filter coefficients, which can be expressed as a vector TEQn, are set to minimize negative effects of interference from symbols that are adjacent in time to the desired symbol.
      <br/>
      In general, the criterion for selecting the TEQ coefficients is based on minimizing means-square error caused by such interference.

      As described above, a multicarrier transmitter serial-to-parallel converts an input data stream to sub-symbols that are distributed to modulate carriers which are orthogonal on the symbol duration (2N+v)T, where T denotes the sampling interval.
      <br/>
      Assuming N sub-symbols distributed over 2N carriers and imposing Hermitian symmetry, i.e.,  (Equation image '4' not included in text)
    </p>
    <p num="28">the transmitted sequence sn in the time domain is given by:  (Equation image '5' not included in text)</p>

    <p num="31">is introduced to normalize the overall transmission power.</p>
    <p num="32">
      The overall channel is considered to include the physical channel plus the filtering performed in the transmit and receive circuitry at both ends of the channel.
      <br/>
      The channel impulse response (CIR) is assumed to be linear.
      <br/>
      Denoting CIR by h(t), and providing cyclic extension consisting of v samples, the received analog signal is given by:  (Equation image '8' not included in text)
    </p>
    <p num="33">where  ETA (t) is the additive white gaussians noise (AWGN) with one-sided spectral density N0.</p>
    <p num="34">
      At the receiver, the cyclic prefix samples are discarded, and FFT (demodulation) is performed on the 2N real-valued samples.
      <br/>
      Inspecting equation (6), the innermost summation corresponds to the Fourier coefficient of the CIR associated with the sub-carrier k. Hence, after demodulation, each symbol only needs to be corrected by a complex coefficient associated with the channel transfer function that includes a phase shift and attenuation.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, this correction in the time domain may be seen as convolution of the demodulated sequence with the composite channel impulse response.
    </p>
    <p num="35">
      As described earlier, the channel causes ISI which may severely deteriorate system performance (e.g., poor symbol decisions).
      <br/>
      The dispersiveness of the channel may be compensated for by adding guard time.
      <br/>
      For DMT systems, each symbol is cyclically extended (the v last samples are repeated at the beginning of the block data) so that input sequence "looks" periodic.
      <br/>
      Again, the disadvantage of cyclic extension is reduced throughput efficiency which is proportional to the extension length, i.e., by a factor  (Equation image '9' not included in text)
    </p>
    <p num="36">
      For severe-ISI channels, throughput efficiency becomes intolerably low.
      <br/>
      Increasing N or v increases computational complexity, system delay, and memory requirements of the transceiver, and hence the cost of transceiver increases quite significantly.
      <br/>
      This problem is solved in the present invention using a short-length, computationally "inexpensive" equalizer.
    </p>
    <p num="37">Mathematical Principles Used to Formulate the Equalizer</p>
    <p num="38">
      The complete suppression of ISI requires that the equalized signal, yn, be identical to the transmitted sequence, sn, up to an offset n0 (defined greater detail below):
      <br/>
      yn = GAMMA  * sn-n0   (7)
    </p>
    <p num="39">
      where  GAMMA  represents an arbitrary scaling factor.
      <br/>
      If the original sequence Xk to be transmit is complex, it is reformatted as a Hermite symmetric sequence.
      <br/>
      To simplify the notation, the index "m" which represents the symbol number is dropped.
      <br/>
      Thereafter, the IDFT of the Hermite symmetric sequence is calculated, (which corresponds to modulation), producing a real signal which is transmit over the channel.
      <br/>
      The received signal is then demodulated using the DFT.
    </p>
    <p num="40">
      The equalizer in accordance with the invention is therefore designed to determine a vector TEQn such that when TEQn operates on (or filters) the sampled received signal, xn, the result, yn, is (to a great extent) a replica of the originally transmitted sequence sn, i.e.,
      <br/>
      yn =TEQn +character pullout}xn  (8)
    </p>
    <p num="41">Substituting xn using equation (6) results in:  (Equation image '10' not included in text)</p>
    <p num="42">where  ETA ' is filtered external noise, and the symbol +character pullout} depicts convolution.</p>
    <p num="43">In order for the equalizer to perfectly suppress ISI, it must satisfy the following:  (Equation image '11' not included in text)</p>
    <p num="44">where  (Equation image '12' not included in text)</p>

      represents the deviation of the overall channel impulse response (CIR) from the desirable (ideal) unit pulse  DELTA (n), i.e., the error due to imperfect equalization.

      The goal is to compensate the CIR (hn) so that  (Equation image '13' not included in text)
    </p>
    <p num="46">
      is reduced to zero.
      <br/>
      Therefore, in the absence of noise and using an infinite length TEQn, it is theoretically possible to achieve complete suppression of ISI.

    <p num="56">
      The following is a brief and basic description of krakovian algebra.
      <br/>
      A krakovian is defined as a set of elements (numbers, symbols, or other krakovians) arranged in rectangular array of m columns and n rows so that the krakovian has a dimension m * n. The elements of a krakovian are indexed according to their position, namely by column and row number.
      <br/>
      Krakovian algebra is not the same as matrix algebra.
      <br/>
      In fact, some of the different properties of krakovians, not found in regular matrix algebra, are employed in the preferred embodiment to achieve a significant reduction in data processing overhead.
    </p>
    <p num="57">In krakovian algebra, the product of two krakovian factors a and b when it consists of accumulated cross-products of the columns of krakovians a and b. The product element is written in the product column having the same column number as the first factor a and in the product row having the same number as the column of the second factor b:  (Equation image '21' not included in text)</p>
    <p num="58">
      Thus, krakovian multiplication requires the same number of rows.
      <br/>
      If the product a * b exists, then the product b * a always exists and is equal to the transpose of a * b. This definition leads to a laws of commutation and association that are different from the commonly known matrix laws.

    <p num="59">
      A special krakovian, referred to as the diagonal krakovian, includes all "1's" on the NW-SE diagonal and "0's" in every other location and is depicted by the Greek letter  TAU .
      <br/>
      When the krakovian  TAU  occurs as a second multiplicand, it plays a similar role in the krakovian algebra as does unity in the arithmetic of ordinary numbers.
      <br/>
      However, a krakovian  TAU  as the first multiplicand causes a krakovian transpose.
      <br/>
      These statements may be expressed as follows:
      <br/>
      a *  TAU =a  (14)

      TAU  * a= TAU a  (15)

    <p num="61">
      Changes in the order of multiplying krakovians follow certain rules.
      <br/>
      The krakovian association law states:

      Since determining the optimum equalizer coefficients TEQn is the end goal, the traditional "fitting" procedure is reversed in the present invention.

    <p num="111">
      Having demonstrated the underlying mathematical principles of the present invention, a routine (block 60) for determining the optimal is equalizer coefficients in accordance with an example implementation of the invention is now described in conjunction with the flowchart in FIG. 5.
      <br/>
      Switch 51 is connected to the equalizer filter coefficients processor 53 when training the equalizer 52.
      <br/>
      A unit or dirac pulse is transmitted over the channel and received in the receiver (block 62).
      <br/>
      The equalizer filter coefficients processor 53 processes the received samples xn and estimates a channel impulse response (CIR) of the communications channel (block 64).
      <br/>
      Using the channel impulse response, the equalizer filter coefficients processor 53 estimates the autocorrelation function (ACF) associated with the just-estimated channel impulse response as a krakovian ( ALPHA )2 (block 66).
      <br/>
      The autocorrelation function krakovian is then inverted taking advantage of the Toeplitz structure of the krakovian ( ALPHA )2 to generate (( ALPHA )2)-1 (block 68).
      <br/>
      Using the estimate of the CIR, the following krakovian vector is formed:  (Equation image '51' not included in text)
    </p>
    <p num="112">(block 69).</p>
    <p num="113">The next task is to calculate the cost function J as a function of the channel impulse response offset  (Equation image '52' not included in text)</p>
    <p num="114">
      using equation (38) (block 70).
      <br/>
      Various channel impulse response offset values are inserted into block 69 in order to determine that offset  (Equation image '53' not included in text)
    </p>
    <p num="115">for which the cost function  (Equation image '54' not included in text)</p>

      is the smallest, i.e., minimum mean-square error (block 72).
      <br/>
      The optimum equalizer filter coefficients TEQn are then determined using equation (36) (block 74).
      <br/>
      Once calculated, the equalizer filter coefficients processor 53 then sets the equalizer filter coefficients TEQ0, TEQ1, . . . TEQK-2, and TEQK-1 to the calculated optimal values (block 76).
      <br/>
      After the coefficients are set, switch 51 is then moved to the normal position, and the equalizer 52 processes received signal samples xn using the set TEQ filter coefficients.

      Equalizer output samples yn are then compensated for the channel-induced ISI (block 78).

    <p num="117">Performance of an Equalizer Implemented Using the Invention</p>
    <p num="118">
      FIGS. 6-9 are now described to illustrate the performance of an example implementation of the present invention by way of simulated tests.
      <br/>
      A one kilometer telephone loop was chosen as an example communications channel.
      <br/>
      A unit impulse was transmitted over that telephone loop.
      <br/>
      FIG. 6 graphs normalized amplitude on the vertical axis versus time (indicated as received sample number) on the horizontal axis.
      <br/>
      The channel impulse response (CIR) received corresponding to the transmitted unit pulse is shown as an oscillating waveform (indicated as a dashed line) having multiple "pulses" which obviously adversely interferes with adjacent symbols.
      <br/>
      In contrast, the same channel impulse response after equalization (shown as a solid line) includes only one very narrow spike shortly after the first maximum pulse of the unequalized channel impulse response.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, the equalized channel impulse response resembles very much the originally transmitted unit pulse with minimal overlap onto adjacent symbols.
    </p>
    <p num="119">
      FIG. 7 enlarges the portion of the graph in FIG. 6 around the first maximum of the CIR from a reference chosen at sample zero.
      <br/>
      It is easy to see that the channel impulse response offset  (Equation image '55' not included in text)
    </p>
    <p num="120">defined as the offset between the first maximum of the channel impulse response and the point at which the cost function  (Equation image '56' not included in text)</p>
    <p num="121">is minimized, corresponds to one sampling interval.</p>
    <p num="122">FIG. 8 illustrates this point somewhat differently by graphing the cost function  (Equation image '57' not included in text)</p>
    <p num="123">on the vertical axis as a function of the offset  (Equation image '58' not included in text)</p>
    <p num="124">
      The first maximum of the unequalized channel response is at time sample zero.
      <br/>
      By substituting different offset  (Equation image '59' not included in text)
    </p>
    <p num="125">values, e.g., -3, -2, 1, 2, 3, etc., and calculating the cost function, the graph in FIG. 8 clearly shows that the minimum cost function value is at an offset  (Equation image '60' not included in text)</p>
    <p num="126">equal to one sample time from sample zero.</p>
    <p num="127">
      FIG. 9 illustrates the overall performance of this example equalizer.
      <br/>
      The spectrum of the one kilometer telephone loop channel is illustrated as the dashed dot line.
      <br/>
      The equalizer's spectrum, is shown as the dashed line and substantially mirrors the spectrum, of the communications channel.
      <br/>
      The resulting spectrum equalized in accordance with the present invention (shown as a solid line) is for the most part flat which corresponds to optimal equalization.
    </p>
    <p num="128">
      Comparing the original channel impulse response with the equalized channel impulse response, it is clear that the present invention offers a substantially improved signal-to-noise ratio performance with respect to intersymbol interference.
      <br/>
      FIG. 10 illustrates, for this example in a DMT environment, SNR performance in the frequency domain due to the uncancelled, oscillating "tail" of the channel impulse response, (which causes intersymbol interference), for various length DMT cyclic extensions.
      <br/>
      As is evident from FIG. 10, there is no dramatic difference in SNR even though different cyclic extension length values are used (64, 32, and 16).
      <br/>
      Accordingly, using the present invention, shorter cyclic extensions may be used resulting in greater throughput efficiency.
    </p>
    <p num="129">
      Optimal equalization is achieved in the present invention using a short length, non-recursive equalizer that has a number of advantages over gradient-based, recursive equalizer algorithms.
      <br/>
      One well known drawback of gradient, recursive algorithms is their susceptibility to local minima.
      <br/>
      The present invention avoids this problem using the algebraic principle of minimizing means square error.
      <br/>
      Instead of differentiating the cost function, the cost function's value is explicitly monitored for discrete choices of the channel impulse response offset vector until a minimum is found.
      <br/>
      Thereafter, the optimum equalizer coefficients of a short length equalizer are readily calculated in non-recursive fashion and with relatively small computation cost.
