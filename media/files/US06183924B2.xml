    <heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="1">The present invention relates to a novel two-component developer suitable for use in the development of electrostatic image in electrophotographic process copying machines or printers.</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">
      The state-of-the-art electrophotographic process copying machines or printers are far inferior to lithography or silver salt system photography in image quality.
      <br/>
      In an attempt to improve the image quality of electrophotographic process copying machines or printers, various efforts have been made to improve toners and carriers constituting the developer, image-forming apparatus, etc.
    </p>
    <p num="3">For the part of toner, it has recently been necessary more and more to reduce the particle diameter of particulate toner in order to improve image quality such as resolution.</p>
    <p num="4">
      Various technical developments have been made.
      <br/>
      However, most of powder toners for development of electrostatic image commercially available at present have a volume-average particle diameter of from about 8 to 13  MU m. Powder toners having the smallest particle diameter have a volume-average particle diameter of about 7  MU m (as measured by Coulter Multisizer).
      <br/>
      Thus, the smallest allowable volume-average particle diameter of particulate toners extremely useful for the enhancement of image resolution is about 7  MU m at present.
      <br/>
      No particulate toners having far smaller particle diameters are commercially produced.
      <br/>
      Little or no developing machines using such a small particle size toner have been developed.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      A powder toner is prepared by a dry process such as pulverization process or a wet process such as polymerization process and so-called phase inversion emulsification method as described in JP-A-5-66600 (The term "JP-A" as used herein means an "unexamined published Japanese patent application") and JP-A-09-311502.
      <br/>
      It is said that the smallest allowable particle diameter of toners produced by a pulverization process using the present crushing machine on an industrial basis is about 6 to 7  MU m. Of course, small particle diameter toners having a particle diameter of about 5  MU m can be produced.
      <br/>
      However, these toners cannot hardly be considered practical because they add to cost and exhibit deteriorated triboelectricity or powder fluidity caused by the reduction of the particle diameter thereof.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      The wet process such as polymerization process and emulsification process is said to be essentially free from difficulty for the reduction of the particle diameter of powder toners.
      <br/>
      However, the prior art wet process toner is mainly intended in the stage of development or production to replace the foregoing pulverization process toner having an ordinary volume-average particle diameter range (about 7 to 13  MU m).
      <br/>
      Electrostatic image developers comprising small particle diameter toners having a volume-average particle diameter of about 6  MU m or less have been so far little studied.
      <br/>
      No practical formulations have been known.
    </p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="7">
      The inventors made extensive studies of two-component developer for use in the development of electrostatic image which can provide an printed image excellent in density, resolution, tone reproduction, etc.
      <br/>
      As a result, it was found that the use of a spherically particulate toner having a small particle diameter and a high pigment concentration as a two-component developer in combination with a carrier having a predetermined range of particle diameter makes it possible to provide an excellent image quality and drastically reduce the amount of toner to be consumed per sheet of printing paper.
      <br/>
      The inventors further found a specific emulsion or polymerization process suitable for use in the preparation of a particulate toner to be used as such a two-component developer.

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="12">
      The inventors made extensive studies of improvement of image quality in two-component development.
      <br/>
      As a result, it was found that the use of a developer comprising a spherically particulate toner containing a predetermined amount of a colorant and having a volume-average particle diameter of from 1 to 6  MU m, more preferably from 2 to 6  MU m, even more preferably from 3 to 6  MU m and a resin-coated carrier having a volume-average particle diameter of from 20 to 150  MU m, preferably from 20 to 120  MU m, more preferably from 20 to 80  MU m makes it possible to drastically reduce the amount of toner to be consumed per sheet of printing paper in addition to remarkable improvement of image quality.
    </p>
    <p num="13">
      It was found that the use of a spherically particulate toner containing as a colorant carbon black in a content of from 8 to 20% by weight makes it possible to realize image density at a high standard in addition to image resolution or tone reproduction.
      <br/>
      It was further found that as a binder resin there may be preferably used a styrene (meth)acrylate resin or polyester resin and the use of a styrene (meth)acrylate resin in particular makes it possible to provide the toner with an excellent fixability.
    </p>
    <p num="14">
      It was also found that the use of, as a cyan, magenta or yellow color developer, a spherically particulate toner containing as a colorant an organic pigment in a content of from 3 to 20% by weight makes it possible to realize an excellent image quality.
      <br/>
      It was further found that as a binder resin there may be preferably used a styrene (meth)acrylate resin or polyester resin and the use of a polyester resin in particular makes it possible to exert a remarkable effect of improving hue and gloss.
    </p>
    <p num="15">
      The inventors further found that the use of a powder toner having an average circularity (average of circularity defined by (perimeter of circle having the same area as the projected area of particle)/(perimeter of the projected image of particle)) of not less than 0.97 comprising a colorant encapsulated in a binder resin makes it possible to satisfy more easily the foregoing requirements for developer and improve image quality.
      <br/>
      This is because the use of a toner having a high sphericity and a small particle diameter makes it possible to form a uniformly thin toner layer on a photoreceptor.
    </p>
    <p num="16">The inventors further found that the use of a spherically particulate toner having a particle size distribution such that the ratio of 50%-volume particle diameter/50%-number particle diameter is not more than 1.25 and the square root of the ratio of 84%-volume particle diameter/16%-volume particle diameter is not more than 1.25 makes it possible to further improve image quality.</p>
    <p num="17">
      It was further found that the use of the foregoing spherically particulate toner comprising hydrophobic silica and hydrophobic titanium oxide externally added thereto in combination makes it possible to further improve the properties of developer.
      <br/>
      This is because the use of such a toner makes it possible to remarkably improve basic characteristics of toner such as triboelectricity and fluidity.
    </p>
    <p num="18">The inventors further found that the use of a spherically particulate toner obtained by a process which comprises mixing a mixture comprising a colorant and a water-insoluble binder resin as essential components and an aqueous medium (water or liquid medium comprising water as a major component), emulsifying the mixture to form spherical colored particles, and then withdrawing the said particles dispersed in the liquid medium in the form of dried powder or a process which comprises allowing a polymerizable monomer having a colorant dispersed therein to undergo polymerization in a liquid medium to form spherical colored particles, and then withdrawing the said particles dispersed in the liquid medium in the form of dried powder makes it possible to easily obtain a particulate toner adapted for the electrostatic image developer of the present invention.</p>
    <p num="19">
      The inventors further found that as the carrier for the developer of the present invention there may be preferably used a spherically or almost spherically particulate carrier having a small particle diameter because the toner used therewith has a small particle diameter.
      <br/>
      In particular, it was found that a carrier coated with a resin, particularly silicon, having a volume-average particle diameter of from 20 to 150  MU m, preferably from 20 to 120  MU m, more preferably from 20 to 80  MU m is desirable.
    </p>
    <p num="20">The background and detailed description of the present invention will be further described hereinafter.</p>
    <p num="21">
      It is generally said that lithographic printing process provides better image quality than electrophotographic printing process.
      <br/>
      This is because the ink layer on the printed matter provided by lithographic printing process comprises picture elements having a particle diameter on the order of submicron and thus has a thickness of about 0.5  MU m while the toner layer on the printed matter provided by electrophotographic printing process using a powder toner comprises picture elements having a particle diameter of from about 7 to 13  MU m and thus has a thickness of from about 10 to 20  MU m. From such a standpoint of view, the inventors expected that by drastically reducing the particle diameter of toner in electrostatic image developer from the conventional value and drastically reducing the thickness of the toner layer from the conventional value, the quality of image provided by electrophotographic printing process can be improved close to the level of lithographic printing process.
    </p>
    <p num="22">
      The inventors then thought that the shape of toner particles is preferably spherical to secure sufficient powder fluidity or triboelectricity even if the toner has a reduced particle diameter.
      <br/>
      The inventors then studied the composition, properties and preparation process of spherically particulate toner having a small particle diameter.
      <br/>
      As a result, the inventors found a suitable powder toner and developed a method for the stable production of such a toner.
      <br/>
      The inventors further found a developer comprising such a toner which can provide a drastic improvement in image quality.
    </p>
    <p num="23">
      The small particle diameter toner proposed by the inventors has a volume-average particle diameter of from 1 to 6  MU m, preferably from 2 to 6  MU m, more preferably from 3 to 6  MU m, and is spherical.
      <br/>
      The use of such a toner makes it possible to form a uniformly thin toner layer on the photoreceptor and thus reduce the thickness of the toner layer on the printed matter, resulting in the drastic reduction of the amount of toner to be consumed per sheet of printing paper.
    </p>
    <p num="24">
      Further, the use of a particulate toner having a roundness as high as not less than 0.97 as calculated in terms of average circularity makes it easier to form a uniformly thin toner layer on the photoreceptor and hence makes it possible to further improve image quality.
      <br/>
      Moreover, the use of such a particulate toner having a shape close to complete sphere makes it possible to prevent the deterioration of fluidity accompanying the reduction of the particle diameter of the particulate toner.
    </p>
    <p num="25">
      On the other hand, when the particle diameter of the particulate toner is reduced and the amount of the toner on the printed matter is reduced, the reduction of the image density can easily occur.
      <br/>
      Thus, it is necessary that the content of colorant in the toner be increased to secure necessary image density.
    </p>
    <p num="26">
      Thus, in order to obtain sufficient print image density with a toner having a particle diameter as small as from 1 to 6  MU m, for which the present invention is intended, it is essential to predetermine the pigment concentration in the toner with a specific range.
      <br/>
      It may be necessary to predetermine the colorant concentration higher than that of commercially available toners having an ordinary size (from about 7 to 13  MU m).
    </p>
    <p num="27">
      The powder toner having a particle diameter of from 1  MU m to 6  MU m of the present invention, if it is a black toner comprising carbon black incorporated therein as a colorant, needs to comprise carbon black incorporated therein in an amount of not less than 8% by weight, preferably not less than 9% by weight based on the sum of the weight of the binder resin and colorant used.
      <br/>
      The upper limit of carbon black content is about 20% by weight, preferably about 15% by weight, to maintain sufficient thermal properties such as fixability and good triboelectricity.
      <br/>
      Further, the color toner comprising an organic pigment incorporated therein as a colorant needs to comprise an organic pigment incorporated therein in an amount of not less than 3% by weight, preferably not less than 4% by weight, more preferably not less than 5% by weight based on the sum of the weight of the binder resin and colorant used.
      <br/>
      The upper limit of organic pigment content is about 20% by weight, preferably about 10% by weight, to maintain good hue, transparency, fixability and triboelectricity.
    </p>
    <p num="28">
      The toner binder resin to be used in the present invention is not specifically limited.
      <br/>
      In practice, however, a styrene (meth)acrylate resin or polyester resin is desirable because it can fully exert the effect of the present invention.
      <br/>
      The use of a styrene acrylate resin makes it easy to secure an excellent fixability.
      <br/>
      Further, the use of a polyester resin makes it possible to obtain an excellent color-developability or gloss.
      <br/>
      The optimum binder resin can be selected depending on the purpose of the developer.
    </p>
    <p num="29">
      If the particle diameter of powder toner obtained by pulverization process is reduced, the grinding energy cost shows a rapid rise from about 6  MU m of the volume-average particle diameter.
      <br/>
      Further, the resulting toner particles are amorphous and exhibit a deteriorated triboelectricity or powder fluidity.
      <br/>
      This is a great problem arising when a particulate toner having a particle diameter of not more than about 6  MU m is put into practical use.
    </p>
    <p num="30">
      However, the deterioration of the powder fluidity of a toner due to reduction of particle diameter can be remarkably prevented by making the toner particles spherical.
      <br/>
      The particulate toner having a particle diameter of from 1  MU m to 6  MU m, for which the present invention is intended, preferably has an average circularity of not less than 0.97. The average circularity can be determined by taking SEM (scanning type electron microscope) photograph of toner particles, measuring the size of the toner particles on the photograph, and then calculating the average circularity from the measurements.
      <br/>
      However, it can be easily measured by means of a Type FPIP-1000 flow type particle image analyzer produced by Toa Iyo Denshi K. K.
    </p>
    <p num="31">
      On the other hand, the inventors conjecture that the deterioration of triboelectricity due to the reduction of particle diameter is mainly attributed to the exposure of a part of the colorant or other additives (normally wax or charge control agent) at the surface of the toner particles.
      <br/>
      In other words, even if the content (% by weight) of colorant or the like is the same, the reduction of particle diameter causes an increase in the surface of the toner particles and hence an increase in the proportion of colorant exposed at the surface of the toner particles, resulting in a drastic change in the composition of the surface of the toner particles and hence a drastic change in the triboelectricity of the toner particles.
      <br/>
      Thus, the triboelectricity of the small size toner particles can be difficultly controlled.
    </p>
    <p num="32">In order to keep the triboelectricity of the toner particles good even if the particle diameter of the toner particles is reduced, it is effective to prevent the colorant or other additives from being exposed at the surface of the toner particles, that is, arrange the toner structure such that the colorant or other additives are encapsulated in the toner particles.</p>
    <p num="33">
      Whether or not the colorant, charge control agent, wax or the like are exposed at the surface of the toner particles can be easily judged by observing a section of the toner particle by TEM (transmission type electron microscope).
      <br/>
      In some detail, the toner particle of the present invention is embedded in a resin.
      <br/>
      The embedded toner particle is then cut by a microtome.
      <br/>
      The specimen thus prepared may be dyed with ruthenium oxide or the like if necessary.
      <br/>
      By observing the section of the particle by TEM, it can be clearly seen whether or not the colorant or other additives are encapsulated in the toner particles.
    </p>
    <p num="34">
      Theoretically speaking, the spherically particulate toner having a particle diameter of from 1 to 6  MU m comprising a colorant encapsulated in toner particles can be obtained, e.g., by subjecting amorphous particles prepared by pulverization process to surface treatment with a resin so that they are rendered spherical.
      <br/>
      In practice, however, a wet process such as polymerization process and emulsification process can be actually employed to advantage from the standpoint of ease of production and cost.
      <br/>
      In particular, emulsification process is suitable for the preparation of the particulate toner of the present invention because even if the kind of binder resin to be used is varied, spherical colored particles having a good particle size distribution can be formed and the pigment concentration can be easily raised.
    </p>
    <p num="35">
      The use of such a process makes it easier to give a sharp toner particle diameter distribution as described below.
      <br/>
      The resulting toner can exert a higher effect of improving the image quality.
    </p>
    <p num="36">
      The particle size distribution of the toner particles, too, has an effect on the triboelectricity of the toner.
      <br/>
      In particular, the small particle diameter toner to be used in the present invention preferably has a sharper particle size distribution than commercially available toners having a particle diameter of from about 7  MU m to 13  MU m. In other words, the powder toner having a volume-average particle diameter of from 1  MU m to 6  MU m, for which the present invention is intended, must satisfy the requirements that it has a particle size distribution such that, as measured by Coulter Multisizer, the ratio of 50%-volume particle diameter/50%-number particle diameter is not more than 1.25, particularly not more than 1.20 and the square root of the ratio of 84%-volume particle diameter/16%-volume particle diameter is not more than 1.25, particularly not more than 1.20, to exhibit a good triboelectricity and hence provide a high quality printed image free of fog.
    </p>
    <p num="37">
      Further, also by properly selecting the kind or amount of the inorganic oxide fine particles to be attached to the surface of the toner particles, the triboelectricity and powder fluidity of the small particle diameter toner can be further improved.
      <br/>
      Examples of the inorganic oxide fine particles employable in the present invention include silica, titanium oxide, aluminum oxide, zinc oxide, tin oxide, antimony oxide and magnesium oxide having a primary particle diameter of from 5 to 100  MU m. These inorganic oxide fine particles may be used singly or in combination.
      <br/>
      These inorganic oxide fine particles may be previously treated with an inorganic material such as particulate titanium oxide doped with tin oxide antimony to provide electrical conductivity.
    </p>
    <p num="38">
      Particularly preferred among these inorganic oxide fine particles are hydrophobicized silica and titanium oxide having a primary particle diameter of from about 5 nm to 50 nm to be used in combination for negatively polar toner.
      <br/>
      Many kinds of hydrophobic silica for toner have been commercially available.
      <br/>
      It is practically advantageous that any desirable silica are selected from these commercial products.
    </p>
    <p num="39">As hydrophobic titanium oxide there may be preferably titanium oxide surface-treated with a trifluoromethyl group-containing organic compound particularly for negatively polar toner from the standpoint of environmental stability of triboelectricity and charge rising properties (rate at which saturated triboelectricity is reached and uniformity in triboelectricity).</p>
    <p num="40">
      The trifluoromethyl group-containing organic compound is an organic compound (including polymer) containing at least --CF3 group in its molecular structure.
      <br/>
      Preferred examples of such an organic compound include perfluoroalkyl acrylate resin, and alkoxysilane compound, alkylsilane compound and chlorosilane compound containing perfluoroalkyl group.
      <br/>
      Examples of such a compound will be given below.

    <p num="42">A specific example of commercially available product is Disguard NH-15 (toluene dispersion of CF3 --(CF2)7 -group-containing acrylate resin produced by DAINIPPON INK &amp; CHEMICALS, INC.).</p>
    <p num="43">The surface treatment of titanium oxide fine particles with such a trifluoromethyl group-containing organic compound can be accomplished, e.g., by a process which comprises dissolving the organic compound in an organic solvent such as toluene and alcoholic solvent, thoroughly mixing the solution with particulate titanium oxide, removing the organic solvent from the mixture by distillation or the like, subjecting the mixture to heat treatment, and then grinding the material.</p>
    <p num="44">
      The amount of such a trifluoromethyl group-containing organic compound to be surface-treated to the metal oxide fine particles is preferably from about 5 to 30% by weight based on the weight of the metal oxide fine particles.
      <br/>
      If the externally added amount of the metal oxide fine particles remains the same, the triboelectricity of the toner tends to increase with the increase in the amount of the organic compound to be surface-treated to the metal oxide fine particles.
      <br/>
      It is preferred that the amount of the trifluoromethyl group-containing organic compound to be surface-treated be adjusted depending on the purpose.
    </p>
    <p num="45">
      The trifluoromethyl group-containing organic compound has an extremely low surface energy due to its trifluoromethyl group and thus exhibits a strong water repellency and a great electronegativity when rubbed.
      <br/>
      Thus, the trifluoromethyl group-containing organic compound can exert an effect of remarkably enhancing the negative triboelectricity of the toner.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, the toner comprising titanium oxide fine particles surface-treated with a trifluoromethyl group-containing organic compound externally added thereto exhibits drastically improved environmental stability and charge rising properties.
    </p>
    <p num="46">
      The added amount of such inorganic oxide fine particles depends on the purpose of the powder toner.
      <br/>
      In general, the smaller the toner particle diameter is, the greater is preferably the added amount of the inorganic oxide fine particles.
      <br/>
      The particulate toner of the present invention having a particle diameter of from 1 to 6  MU m preferably comprises various oxides externally added thereto in an amount of from 0.3 to 3% by weight based on the weight of the particulate toner.
    </p>
    <p num="47">
      The external addition of such inorganic oxide fine particles is not specifically limited but can be accomplished by a known conventional method using a Henschel mixer, a Hybridizer, et al.
      <br/>
      For example, a two-stage process may be employed which comprises external addition of inorganic oxide fine particles treated with a trifluoromethyl group-containing organic compound and subsequent external addition of hydrophobic silica fine particles.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, a process which comprises external addition of a mixture of the titanium oxide fine particles and the hydrophobic silica fine particles may be used.
    </p>
    <p num="48">
      The use of the foregoing developer comprising in combination a spherically particulate toner having a volume-average particle diameter of from 1 to 6  MU m and a predetermined range of colorant concentration (preferably having a predetermined range of particle size distribution and comprising a hydrophobic inorganic oxide externally added thereto) and a resin-coated carrier having a particle diameter of from 20 to 150  MU m makes it possible to exert a remarkable effect of not only improving image quality but also drastically reducing the amount of toner to be consumed per sheet of printing paper.
      <br/>
      It can exert a remarkable effect of improving image quality particularly for the development of full-color image with four color developers (cyan, magenta, yellow, black).
