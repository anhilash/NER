    <heading>INTRODUCTION</heading>
    <p num="1">The present invention relates to a vat for a deep fryer, and more particularly, to an improved vat bottom configuration for a deep fryer.</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND</heading>
    <p num="2">
      Deep fryers are commercially used by restaurants, institutional kitchens, and fast food establishments for cooking a variety of food products, such as french fries, fish, fried chicken, and the like.
      <br/>
      The food product is cooked by totally immersing it within a vat or tank that is filled with heated oil or shortening.
      <br/>
      The shortening may be heated using a flow of heated gas that is drawn through heat exchanger tubes located within the cooking vat.
      <br/>
      Food particles tend to accumulate at the bottom of the vat during use.
      <br/>
      After the vat is drained, a spray nozzle is used to project a sheet of shortening in order to rinse food particles from the bottom of the vat.
    </p>
    <p num="3">
      The vat bottom typically is formed with a crease or fold extending from the back to the front of the vat, providing a funneling effect and allowing the shortening to collect and flow to a drain centrally located in the bottom of the vat.
      <br/>
      This configuration of the vat bottom diverts the sheet of sprayed shortening, preventing shortening from reaching and cleaning all areas, e.g., the corners, of the vat bottom.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      It is an object of the present invention to provide a vat bottom configuration for a deep fryer which reduces or wholly overcomes some or all of the difficulties inherent in prior known devices.
      <br/>
      Particular objects and advantages of the invention will be apparent to those skilled in the art, that is, those who are knowledgeable or experienced in this field of technology, in view of the following disclosure of the invention and detailed description of certain preferred embodiments.
    </p>
    <heading>SUMMARY</heading>
    <p num="5">The principles of the invention may be used to advantage to provide a vat bottom configuration for a deep fryer which has improved cleaning capabilities.</p>
    <p num="6">
      In accordance with a first aspect, a vat for a fryer system has a front wall, a rear wall, first and second side walls, and a bottom.
      <br/>
      The bottom is substantially planar and slopes downwardly from the rear wall toward the front wall.
      <br/>
      A trough extends from the first side wall to the second side wall, adjacent the front wall.
      <br/>
      A drain is located in the trough.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      In accordance with another aspect, a vat for a fryer system has a front wall, a rear wall, first and second side walls, and a bottom.
      <br/>
      The bottom is substantially planar and slopes downwardly from the rear wall toward the front wall.
      <br/>
      A trough extends from the first side wall to the second side wall, adjacent the front wall.
      <br/>
      The trough slopes downwardly from the first and second side walls toward a drain located in the trough.
      <br/>
      A shutoff valve is located in the drain.
      <br/>
      A spray nozzle is operably connected to a fluid supply, the spray nozzle being oriented to direct fluid across the vat bottom into the trough.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      In accordance with yet another aspect, a fryer system has a plurality of vats, each vat having a front wall, a rear wall, first and second side walls, and a bottom.
      <br/>
      The bottom of each vat is substantially planar and slopes downwardly from the rear wall toward the front wall.
      <br/>
      A trough extends from the first side wall to the second side wall along a bottom of the front wall of each vat.
      <br/>
      A drain is located in the trough of each vat.
      <br/>
      A spray nozzle in each vat is operably connected to a fluid supply, the spray nozzle being oriented to direct fluid across the vat bottom into the trough.
      <br/>
      Each drain is operably connected to a drain pan.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      From the foregoing disclosure, it will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art, that is, those who are knowledgeable or experienced in this area of technology, that the present invention provides a significant technological advance.
      <br/>
      Preferred embodiments of the invention can provide improved cleaning capabilities for the vat of a deep fryer.

    <p num="15">
      In other preferred embodiments, drain 16 could be located in other locations in trough 14, e.g., proximate first or second side walls 8, 10.
      <br/>
      Trough 14 in such embodiments would, accordingly, be sloped downwardly from side walls 8, 10 toward drain 16.
    </p>
    <p num="16">
      A description of the operation of vat 2 of a deep fryer will now be provided.
      <br/>
      During cooking of food product, shutoff valve 20 is closed and vat 2 is filled with shortening.
      <br/>
      The shortening is then heated by warm gas in the heat exchanger tubes.
      <br/>
      Food product, e.g., fried chicken, is placed in vat 2 for cooking by the heated shortening.
      <br/>
      After cooking is completed, vat 2 can be cleaned.
      <br/>
      In order to clean vat 2, shutoff valve 20 is opened and the shortening in vat 2 is drained.
      <br/>
      As seen in FIG. 4, shortening is projected from spray nozzle 22 in a fan-shaped spray pattern across bottom 12, shown with arrows A. Since bottom 12 is substantially planar and sloped downwardly from back wall 4 toward trough 14, shortening projected from nozzle 22 is free to spray across substantially the entire surface of bottom 12, thereby rinsing away any food particles or other material which may have accumulated on bottom 12.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, the sloped, planar configuration of bottom 12 provides improved cleaning of substantially the entire surface of bottom 12.
      <br/>
      The sprayed shortening flows along sloped bottom 12 toward front wall 6 until it reaches and falls into trough 14.
      <br/>
      From trough 14 the shortening flows into drain 16 and out of vat 2.
    </p>
    <p num="17">
      In another preferred embodiment, seen in FIG. 5, a plurality of vats 2 are connected to a drain pan 28.
      <br/>
      Shortening in vats 2 is discharged through drains 16 into drain pan 28.
      <br/>
      A bottom 30 of drain pan 28 is sloped downwardly toward a drain 32 which connects to a filter tub (not shown) for filtering of the shortening.
      <br/>
      Drain 32 may be located at any suitable position along drain pan 28.
      <br/>
      In certain preferred embodiments, a shutoff valve 34 is located in drain 32.
      <br/>
      Four vats 2 are shown in FIG. 5 discharging shortening into drain pan 28, however, the actual number of vats connected to drain 32 may be larger or smaller based on a particular user's requirements.
