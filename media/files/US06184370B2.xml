      LIF is a glycoprotein that was originally purified and cloned on the basis of its ability to induce terminal macrophage differentiation of the M1 myeloid leukaemic cell line (Hilton et al. 1988a).
      <br/>
      It has since been shown to have a variety of activities on a wide range of cell types including megakaryocytes, osteoblasts, hepatocytes, adipocytes, neurons, embryonal stem cells and primordial germ cells (Metcalf, 1991).
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      It is proposed that LIF transduces its biological signal via a multi-subunit membrane-bound receptor.
      <br/>
      The receptor for LIF is a member of the haemopoietin or cytokine family of receptors, which generally have roles in cell growth and differentiation.
      <br/>
      These receptors are characterised by their extracellular domain, which contains at least one copy of an approximately 200 amino acid haemopoietin domain (Cosman, 1990).
      <br/>
      A number of primary amino acid sequence motifs distinguish this domain, including pairs of disulfide-bonded cysteine residues and the Trp-Ser-X-Trp-Ser motif (where X is any amino acid).
      <br/>
      The overall secondary and tertiary fold of the haemopoietin domain is predicted to be similar in each member of the receptor family (Bazan, 1990a).
      <br/>
      Like the extracellular domain of the growth hormone receptor (de Vos et al, 1992), the 200 amino acids of the haemopoietin domain form 14 anti-parallel  BETA -strands, folded into two barrel structures.
      <br/>
      The LIF receptor consists of two known subunits, both of which are members of the haemopoietin receptor family.
      <br/>
      The LIF receptor  ALPHA -chain binds LIF with low-affinity and contains two haemopoietin domains (Gearing et al, 1991).
      <br/>
      The  BETA -chain of the LIF receptor has been identified as gp130 (Gearing et al, 1992) which is also a component of the interleukin (IL)-6, IL-11, oncostatin M (OSM) and ciliary neurotrophic factor receptor (CNTF) complexes.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      The ligands for this family of receptors are unrelated at the primary amino acid sequence level, but secondary and tertiary structural predictions indicate that all known ligands for haemopoietin receptors have a similar overall fold, suggesting evolution from a common ancestor (Bazan, 1990b).
      <br/>
      Members of this family of ligands form an anti-parallel, four  ALPHA -helical bundle (the helices are designated A, B, C and D ordered from the N-terminus), that is characterised by one short and two long connecting loops (labelled by the helices they join).
      <br/>
      This has been shown for several ligands that are members of this family, including granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) (SEQ. ID. NO:4) (Hill et al, 1993), granulocyte-macrophage CSF (GM-CSF) (Diederichs et al, 1991), growth hormone (GH) (de Vos et al, 1992; Abdel-Meguid et al, 1987), IL-2 (Brandhuber et al, 1987), IL-4 (Powers et al, 1992) and IL-5 (Milburn et al, 1993), whose structures have been solved, either by x-ray crystallography or by NMR studies.
      <br/>
      The three-dimensional structure of LIF is predicted to be most similar to the structures of OSM, CNTF, IL-6 and G-CSF, amongst others.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      Whilst murine LIF (mLIF) is unable to bind to the human LIF (hLIF) receptor (hLIF-R), hLIF (SEQ. ID. NO:2) is able to bind to both high- and low-affinity mouse LIF receptors (mLIF-R SEQ. ID. NO:1), and is fully biologically active on mouse cells.
      <br/>
      Intriguingly, hLIF (SEQ. ID. NO:2) binds to both the naturally occurring soluble form of the mLIF-R  ALPHA -chain, mLIF-binding protein (mLBP) (Layton et al, 1992), and the high-affinity mLIF-R on PC.13 cells with a higher affinity than mLIF, due to markedly different dissociation kinetics.
      <br/>
      Competitive displacement curves showed that unlabelled mLIF (SEQ. ID. NO:1) and hLIF (SEQ. ID. NO:2) had a similar ability to complete with �125 I�mLIF, for binding to mLBP, while unlabelled hLIF was consistently 1000- to 5000-fold more effective than mLIF (SEQ. ID. NO:1) in competing with �125 I�hLIF for binding to mLBP (Layton et al, 1992).
      <br/>
      Mouse LBP is also able to act as a competitive inhibitor of LIF binding to its cellular receptor, leading to inhibition of biological responses to LIF.
      <br/>
      Again, mLBP was an approximately 1000-fold more potent inhibitor of hLIF (SEQ. ID. NO:2) than mLIF (SEQ. ID. NO:1) in this system.
      <br/>
      Thus, at least two features of hLIF (SEQ. ID. NO:2) distinguish it from mLIF (SEQ. ID. NO:1): first, its capacity to bind to the hLIF-R where mLIF (SEQ. ID. NO:1) cannot and second, its capacity to bind to the mLIF-R with higher affinity than does mLIF (SEQ. ID. NO:1).

    <p num="9">
      Understanding the way in which a cytokine interacts with its receptor at a molecular level is required for the rational design of agonists and antagonists to growth factor and cytokine action as well as the design of growth factor and cytokine analogues.
      <br/>
      In work leading up to the present invention, the inventors exploited the differences in binding characteristics of murine (SEQ. ID. NO:1) and human LIF (SEQ. ID. NO:2) to identify a major determinant responsible for the binding of human LIF (hLIF) to the  ALPHA -chain of its receptor.
      <br/>
      The present invention provides, for the first time, a rational approach to the generation of a new range of therapeutics based on LIF by providing non-naturally occurring molecules capable of binding to hLIF receptor.
      <br/>
      Such therapeutics may be both proteinaceous and non-proteinaceous molecules.
    </p>
    <p num="10">Accordingly, one aspect of the present invention contemplates a non-naturally occurring molecule comprising a tertiary structure which presents a functional binding face for the  ALPHA -chain of hLIF binding receptor.</p>
    <p num="11">More particularly, the present invention is directed to a molecule which is non-naturally occurring and which comprises a carrier portion and an active portion wherein the tertiary structure of said active portion comprises non-contiguous amino acid residues or chemical equivalents thereof selected to constitute a binding determinant for the  ALPHA -chain of human leukaemia inhibitory factor (hLIF) binding receptor.</p>
    <p num="12">
      This aspect of the present invention is predicated in part on the identification of the amino acid residues on hLIF (SEQ. ID. NO:2) which constitute the binding face for the hLIF receptor and in particular the  ALPHA -chain of the hLIF receptor.
      <br/>
      Since a major contribution to the binding face is the three dimensional arrangement of chemically interactive groups on the side chains of the amino acid residues, a preferred aspect of the present invention relates to the non-naturally occurring molecule wherein the functional binding face comprises the chemically interactive groups of the amino acid residues which constitute the binding determinant on hLIF for the  ALPHA -chain of hLIF binding receptor.
      <br/>
      The most preferred chemically interactive groups including groups selected from at least one of a methyl group, a hydroxyl group, an imino-nitrogen group, a negatively charged carboxyl group and a positively charged nitrogen group or chemical equivalents homologues or analogues thereof.
      <br/>
      These chemical groups are in spatial arrangement such that they present a binding face for the  ALPHA -chain of the LIF binding receptor.
      <br/>
      In a most preferred embodiment, the chemical groups are presented on the amino acid residues themselves, or their chemical homologues, analogues or equivalents, which amino acid residues are selected from Gln 21 to Lys 160 of hLIF (SEQ. ID. NO:2).
      <br/>
      The amino acid residues are more particularly selected from at least one of each of the following regions of hLIF (SEQ. ID. NO:2):
    </p>
    <p num="13">
      (i) a region between A and B helices;
      <br/>
      (ii) a region between the B and C helices;
      <br/>
      (iii) the C helix; and
      <br/>
      (iv) a region between the C and D helices.
    </p>
    <p num="14">
      Even more particularly, amino acids are Asp 57, Ser 107, His 112, Ser 113, Val 155 and Lys 158 of hLIF (SEQ. ID. NO:2) or chemical homologues, analogues or equivalents thereof.
      <br/>
      In this embodiment of the present invention, the critical aspect of these amino acids is the chemically interactive group(s) on the side chains of each residue which, in defined spatial arrangement, constitute the binding face of hLIF for the  ALPHA -chain of the hLIF binding receptor.
      <br/>
      It is clear, therefore, that the binding face does not need to comprise amino acid residues but the chemical interactive groups thereon.
    </p>
    <p num="15">
      The non-naturally occurring molecule may be any convenient carrier as described below including a solid support or matrix, or a non-proteinaceous molecule, or a protein, polypeptide or peptide.
      <br/>
      In a most preferred embodiment, the non-naturally occurring molecule in the form of a carrier is a mammalian cytokine such as but not limited to mLIF (SEQ. ID. NO:1) carrying the hLIF (SEQ. ID. NO:2) receptor-binding face.
    </p>
    <p num="16">The non-naturally occurring molecule may not necessarily carry the exact hLIF receptor-binding face of hLIF but will contain an amount of the hLIF receptor-binding face of hLIF to enable the non-naturally occurring molecule to exhibit at least about 35% and more preferably at least about 50% hLIF-like activity as described below.</p>
    <p num="17">
      According to a more preferred embodiment, there is provided a non-naturally occurring chemical entity such as a proteinaceous or non-proteinaceous molecule and/or a solid or non-immobilised support, said chemical entity comprising a tertiary structure which presents one or more chemically interactive groups selected from at least one of each of a methyl group, a hydroxyl group, an imino-nitrogen group, a negatively charged carboxyl group and a positively charged nitrogen group as a functional binding face for the  ALPHA -chain of hLIF binding receptor.
      <br/>
      In a preferred embodiment, the non-naturally occurring chemical entity exhibits at least about 50% hLIF-like activity determined as described below.
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      Preferably, the chemically interactive groups are presented on amino acid residues selected from one or more of Asp, Ser, His, Val and Lys or their chemical equivalents, homologues or analogues.
      <br/>
      More preferably, the chemically interactive groups correspond to those on Asp 57, Ser 107, His 112, Ser 113, Val 155 and Lys 158 of hLIF (SEQ. ID. NO:2) or chemical homologues, analogues or equivalents thereof.
    </p>
    <p num="19">Another aspect of the present invention is directed to a molecule which is non-naturally occurring and which comprises a carrier portion and an active portion wherein said active portion comprises amino acid residues or chemical equivalents thereof which constitute a binding determinant for the  ALPHA -chain of the hLIF binding receptor.</p>
    <p num="20">
      The term "molecule" is used in its broadest sense to refer to any chemical entity or compound, or a protein, polypeptide, or peptide or a non-peptide analogue and which is capable of carrying a sufficient number of amino acid residues or their chemical equivalents to constitute an effective binding determinant for the  ALPHA -chain of the hLIF binding receptor.
      <br/>
      A "sufficient number" of amino acid residues is the minimum number required to exhibit at least 35% hLIF-like activity in terms of the ability to compete for 125 I-hLIF binding to murine LIF-binding protein (mLBP) which is determined as described below.
      <br/>
      A "chemical equivalent" includes active and interactive groups present on a particular amino acid residue and, hence, extends to non-peptide or non-amino acid mimics of the amino acid residues involved in the binding face.
    </p>
    <p num="21">
      The "molecule" is considered a "carrier" of the amino acid residues or their analogues which constitute all or a functional part of a binding determinant for the  ALPHA -chain of the hLIF binding receptor.
      <br/>
      The selection of an appropriate carrier molecule is determined by its tertiary structure.
      <br/>
      The amino acid residues or their analogues are required to form a receptor binding face in the tertiary structure of the carrier molecule.
      <br/>
      The present invention provides, therefore, a carrier molecule having a tertiary structure such that a sufficient number of amino acid residues or their analogues including chemical equivalents, constituting a binding determinant for the  ALPHA -chain of the hLIF binding receptor, when introduced into said carrier molecule to form a receptor-binding face capable of at least 35% hLIF-like activity.
    </p>
    <p num="22">
      Preferably, the carrier molecule is a protein, polypeptide or peptide or a molecule substantially consisting of amino acid residues linked via peptide bonds.
      <br/>
      The molecules may also be engineered to contain non-naturally occurring amino acid residues such as some D-amino acids, non-naturally occurring substituted amino acids or chemical equivalents of amino acids which direct or otherwise influence the tertiary structure of the molecule.
      <br/>
      For example, a carrier molecule such as a protein, polypeptide or protein may be engineered to contain an amino acid, chemical derivative thereof or other chemical entity exhibiting conformational restraints on the overall molecule or a part thereof.
      <br/>
      Molecules exhibiting pre-determined tertiary conformations are particularly useful in their selection as carrier molecules in accordance with the present invention.
    </p>
    <p num="23">
      In a preferred embodiment, the carrier molecule is a mammalian cytokine such as but not limited to a non-human LIF, a colony stimulating factor (CSF) (e.g. G-CSF, GM-CSF) growth hormone, an interleukin (e.g. IL-2, IL-4, IL-6), oncostatin M (OSM), ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) or other factor (e.g. a haemopoietic growth factor, interferon).
      <br/>
      Preferred non-human LIF molecules are those from livestock animals (e.g. from sheep, cattle, donkeys, horses, deer, goats and pigs), laboratory test animals (e.g. mice, rats and guinea pigs), companion animals (e.g. dogs and cats) or captive wild animals (e.g. kangaroos, foxes, dingos, wild boar and emus).
      <br/>
      The preferred non-human LIF is murine LIF (SEQ. ID. NO:1).
      <br/>
      The preferred cytokine is G-CSF (SEQ. ID. NO:4).
    </p>
    <p num="24">
      It is not a requirement of the present invention nor is the invention so limited that every amino acid residue forming the receptor binding face for the  ALPHA -chain of hLIF-binding receptor on hLIF be existent on the carrier molecule.
      <br/>
      It is a requirement, however, that a sufficient number of the residues be present in sufficient conformational proximity such that the receptor-binding face is formed exhibiting at least about 35% hLIF-like activity.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, the amino acids present in hLIF forming the receptor-binding determinant may be substituted by one or more functionally equivalent amino acids or chemical derivatives thereof such that receptor binding activity is not completely lost.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, the present invention extends to a carrier molecule carrying amino acid residues or their chemical equivalents or derivatives or amino acid equivalents, homologues or analogues of the amino acids in hLIF which constitute the binding determinant for the  ALPHA -chain of the hLIF binding receptor, wherein the number of amino acid residues and their proximity are sufficient for the molecule to exhibit at least about 35% hLIF-like activity and more preferably at least about 50% hLIF-like activity.

      The cDNA encoding porcine LIF (SEQ. ID. NO:3) was constructed from a genomic porcine LIF clone (Willson et al. 1992) in which the second intron was removed using the above PCR-based technique.

All mutants were further purified on a 10 cm * 2 cm i.d. S-Sepharose column (Pharmacia, Uppsala) with a linear gradient of 0.2-0.45 M NaCl in 50 mM sodium phosphate pH7.0 over 45 minutes at a flow rate of 2.5 ml/min. The purity of each hybrid was confirmed by their elution as a single peak from a 100 mm * 4.6 mm i.d. C8 RP-HPLC column (Brownlee) using a 0-100% v/v acetonitrile gradient in 0.1% v/v trifluoroacetic acid over 60 minutes at a flow rate of 1 ml/min and by electrophoresis on 15% w/v SDS-polycrylamide gels (Laemmli, 1970) in a Mini-Protean II system (Bio-Rad) followed by silver staining (Butcher and Tomkins, 1985).
      <br/>
      The concentration of protein in each preparation of purified hybrid was quantified by amino acid analysis on a Beckman amino acid analyser (model 6300) (Simpson et al, 1986) with norleucine added as an internal standard in all samples.

      Secondary and tertiary structural predictions have suggested that the LIF molecule is an anti-parallel, four  ALPHA -helical bundle, a topology common to a number of growth factors and cytokines (Diedrichs et al, 1991; Parry et al, 1991; de Vos et al, 1992).
      <br/>
      The model of Bazan (1991) was used to divide the LIF amino acid sequence into a series of modules of predicted  ALPHA -helices and connecting loops.
      <br/>
      A series of plasmids was then designed to encode mouse-human chimeric LIF (m-hLIF) molecules (FIG. 1) in which regions of hLIF sequence were incorporated into a mLIF molecular framework.
      <br/>
      As the sequences of mLIF (SEQ. ID. NO:1) and hLIF (SEQ. ID. NO:2) are .about.80% identical (Gough et al, 1988) (FIG. 4), swapping even large domains of mLIF and hLIF sequence resulted in changes of relatively few amino acid residues.

    <p num="78">
      The protein concentration of each purified sample was determined by amino acid analysis, and the amount of biologically active protein in each sample was estimated by its ability to induce differentiation in mouse M1 myeloid leukaemic colonies.
      <br/>
      An internal standard of mLIF (104 U/ml) was used to normalise all M1 cell bioassays (50 U/ml of LIF is defined as the concentration of LIF required for half maximal stimulation).
      <br/>
      The specific biological activity of each hybrid on mouse cells was defined by the number of units of LIF activity per milligram of protein and was found to be within the normal range for both mLIF and hLIF (1-3 * 108 U/mg) (FIG. 1) indicating that joining structural elements of these homologous proteins did not significantly disrupt their tertiary structure, nor affect their activity on mouse cells.
    </p>

      The structural integrity of all m-hLIF chimeras was also verified by evaluating their ability to bind correctly to the mLIF-R  ALPHA -chain.

    <p num="80">
      The first feature of hLIF (SEQ. ID. NO:2) that distinguishes it from mLIF (SEQ. ID.

      <br/>
      The second feature of hLIF that distinguishes it from mLIF, i.e. its ability to bind to the mLIF-R with a higher affinity than mLIF, was evaluated by the ability of each hybrid to compete with �125 I�hLIF for binding to mLBP and by its sensitivity to biological inhibition by mLBP.
    </p>
    <p num="81">
      The 1000- to 5000-fold difference in the ability of mLIF and hLIF to compete with �125 I�hLIF for binding to mLBP provided a large window in which to measure the degree of hLIF-like specific binding of each chimeric protein.
      <br/>
      In each assay, the doses of hLIF, mLIF and m-hLIF hybrid required to inhibit 50% of �125 I�hLIF binding to mLBP (ID50) were measured, and hLIF and mLIF were defined as having 100% and 0% hLIF-like binding activity, respectively.
      <br/>
      Assays could then be normalised for inter-assay variations by using a logarithmic scale to convert the ID50 for hLIF and mLIF to a score of 100% and 0%, respectively, then converting the ID50 for each hybrid to a percentage score between these two extremes.

      When the predicted C-helix was composed of hLIF residues (MH4), the hybrid displayed 26 +- 1% hLIF-like activity in its ability to compete for �125 I�hLIF binding to mLBP (FIG. 2C).
      <br/>
      Hybrid MH5, which contained the predicted C-D loop region substituted for the equivalent hLIF residues, displayed 52 +- 1% hLIF-like activity in the same assay.
      <br/>
      The combination of hLIF residues in both the predicted C-helix and the C-D loop (MH6) resulted in a hybrid with 78 +- 2% hLIF-like activity as assessed by its ability to compete for �125 I�hLIF binding to mLBP (FIG. 2C).
      <br/>
      Hybrids MH7, MH8 and MH9 were constructed in order to test whether the D-helix co-operated with either the C-helix or the C-D loop to enhance hLIF-like binding specificity.
      <br/>
      Hybrid MH7, which contained hLIF sequences in the C-D loop and in the D-helix, behaved like hybrid MH5, which contained hLIF residues in the C-D loop only.
      <br/>
      Hybrid MH9, which contained hLIF residues in the C-helix and the D-helix, behaved like hybrid MH4, in which only the C-helix comprised hLIF sequence.
      <br/>
      Hybrid MH8, which contained hLIF residues in the C-helix, C-D loop and D-helix, behaved like hybrid MH6, in which only the C-helix and C-D loop comprised hLIF sequence (FIG. 1).
    </p>
    <p num="84">
      All chimeras were also tested for their ability to compete with �125 I�hLIF for binding to COS hLIF-R cells.
      <br/>
      A typical example of a competitive binding assay between the chimeras and �125 I�hLIF on COS hLIF-R cells is shown in FIG. 3A. When the hybrids were ranked according to the dose required to produce 50% inhibition (ID50) of �125 I�hLIF binding to either mLBP or COS hLIF-R cells, the hierarchy was the same in each assay (FIG. 1) indicating that the two features of hLIF that distinguish it from mLIF (SEQ. ID. NO:1) map to the same regions on the hLIF (SEQ. ID. NO:2) molecule.
    </p>
    <p num="85">
      Single amino acid substitutions were then used to identify the individual amino acids within the C-helix that were critical for hLIF-like binding to both mLBP and COS hLIF-R cells.
      <br/>
      Hybrid MH8, which had 77 +- 3% hLIF-like binding to mLBP, was used as a framework for these constructs.
      <br/>
      The residues most likely to contribute to hLIF-specific binding in the C-helix are those that are different in mLIF and hLIF, and are predicted on the basis of a helical wheel projection to be on the external (hydrophilic) surface of the molecule.
      <br/>
      There were therefore three amino acids in the C-helix of hLIF (H112, S113, and I121) that were candidates for investigation by site-directed mutagenesis, although residue I121 represented a conservative substitution between mLIF (A) and hLIF (I) and so was discounted.
      <br/>
      Residues H112 and S113 were mutated individually to their equivalent mLIF residue in hybrids MH11 and MH12, respectively.
      <br/>
      If either residue was important for hLIF-like binding, its substitution to the equivalent mLIF residue should reduce the hLIF-like binding of the hybrid, perhaps to a level similar to that of hybrid MH5, in which only the C-D loop contains hLIF residues.
      <br/>
      The hLIF-like binding of hybrids MH11 and MH12 to mLBP was scored as 67 +- 1% and 73 +- 3%, respectively, indicating that the substitution H112Q was the more significant of these mutations, but alone was insufficient to abrogate completely the contribution of the C-helix to hLIF-like binding to mLBP.
      <br/>
      Hybrid MH 10, which comprised an MH8 framework with a residue in the D-helix, K168, swapped to its mLIF equivalent (T168), showed that changing the least conserved residue on the external face of the D-helix did not affect hLIF-like binding.
    </p>
    <p num="86">
      In order to test whether hLIF-like binding activity of hybrid MH5, in which the C-D loop contains hLIF sequence, could be restored to the level of hybrid MH6, in which both the C-D loop and the C-helix consist of hLIF residues, mLIF amino acids Q112, V113 in the C-helix and T168 in the D-helix were substituted with their equivalent hLIF residues.
      <br/>
      Hybrid MH14, which was based on hybrid MH5 but with additional substitutions Q112H and V113S, showed 71 +- 2% hLIF-like binding to mLBP, indicating that these two residues define the contribution of the C-helix to hLIF-specific binding (FIG. 2C).
      <br/>
      Hybrid MH113, which was identical to hybrid MH14 except for an additional T168K mutation, also had 73 +- 3% hLIF-specific binding to mLBP, confirming that the mutated residues in the C-helix were sufficient to restore MH6-like mLBP binding.
      <br/>
      These chimeras were also tested for their ability to compete with �125 I�hLIF binding to both mLBP and COS hLIF-R cells and gave qualitatively the same results in both assays (FIG. 1).
      <br/>
      This strategy has, therefore, identified two residues within the C-helix, H112, and S113, as critical for hLIF-like binding to both mLBP and the hLIF receptor.

      A 1:4 to 1:8 dilution of normal mouse serum (equivalent to .about 0 (slashed zero) 5-1  MU g/ml mLBP) is required to block 50% of the M1 differentiation-inducing activity of up to 200 U/ml mLIF, whereas, due to the higher affinity of hLIF for mLBP, a 1:8192 dilution of serum (.about 0 (slashed zero) 6 ng/ml mLBP) is sufficient to block 50% of the M1 activity of up to 200 U/ml hLIF.
      <br/>
      This ability of mLBP to inhibit the differentiation-inducing activity of LIF in a species-specific manner was utilized as a second assay that distinguished hLIF from mLIF.
      <br/>
      Hybrids were also assessed for hLIF-like activity in this assay according to the dose of serum required to inhibit 50% of their M1 cell differentiation-inducing activity when they were present in the culture dish at a just maximal stimulatory concentration (.about.200 U/ml).
      <br/>
      An example of a typical serum dilution M1 assay is shown in FIG. 3B. All data from this assay were consistent with the data obtained from the competitive binding assays with mLBP and �125 I�hLIF (FIGS. 2B and 2C), thus eliminating the possibility that the higher affinity of hLIF for mLBP was an artefact of the binding assays themselves or of the use of iodinated hLIF.
    </p>
    <p num="88">
      A strategy similar to that used to define the important residues for hLIF binding to the hLIF-R in the predicted C-helix has been used for identifying single amino acid residues in the C-D loop region that are critical for hLIF-like activity.
      <br/>
      Hybrids in which the C-D loop had been subdivided were constructed.
      <br/>
      Hybrids MH16 and MH17 are based on a MH4 framework, with MH16 having the first half of the C-D loop (residues 131-153) substituted for hLIF residues and MH17 having the second half of the C-D loop (residues 154-160) swapped (see Table 1).
    </p>
    <p num="89">
      When the predicted C-helix plus residues 131-153 of the C-D loop consisted of hLIF residues (MH16), the hybrid had a greater hLIF-like character than MH4 (50% vs. 23%), indicating that there was a small contribution to hLIF-like binding to the hLIF-R  ALPHA -chain by residues 131-153.
      <br/>
      When the C-helix plus residues 154-160 of the C-D loop consisted of hLIF residues (MH17), the hybrid displayed 94% hLIF-like activity in its ability to compete for 125 I-hLIF binding to mLBP.
      <br/>
      This result defined D154-K166 as the major binding determinant within the C-D loop.
    </p>
    <p num="90">2. Hybrids MH18-MH41</p>
    <p num="91">The strategy for mutagenesis was to divide the LIF molecule into predicted secondary structural units of  ALPHA -helix and connecting loop, test the contribution of each structural unit to hLIF-specific binding, then to ascertain the individual amino acids in that region that were responsible for that contribution.</p>
    <p num="92">
      Residues in the C-D loop were initially investigated.
      <br/>
      The assays used were found to be best able to discriminate between hybrids in the middle of their range, so hybrid MH6 which had 78 +- 2% hLIF-like activity, was chosen as a basis for hybrids MH18-25 and MH31.
      <br/>
      Amino acid residues in the C-D loop that were different between mLIF and hLIF were individually swapped from the hLIF residue to the equivalent mLIF residue, and the resulting chimeras tested for a decrease in hLIF-like activity relative to MH6.
      <br/>
      Hybrids MH24 and MH25 showed a significant decrease in their % human score and their affinity for the hLIF-R  ALPHA -chain relative to hLIF, and thus defined residues Val 155 and Lys 158 as being the two residues in the C-D loop that were responsible for its contribution to the overall hLIF-like activity.
    </p>
    <p num="93">
      The residues in the B-C loop region were then investigated, as previous comparisons of hybrids MH6 and MH8 versus MH2 and MH 15 (Example 8(i)) indicated that the region between Ile 103 and Leu 109, which is predicted to form the B-C loop as well as the last two residues of the B-helix, contributed to hLIF-specific binding.
      <br/>
      Hybrid MH5 (52 +- 1% hLIF-like activity) was chosen as a basis for hybrids MH29, MH30 and MH32.
      <br/>
      Amino acid residues in the region between residues 103-109 that were different between mLIF (SEQ. ID. NO:1) and hLIF (SEQ. ID. NO:2) were individually swapped from the mLIF residue to the equivalent hLIF residue, and the resulting chimeras tested for an increase in hLIF-like activity relative to MH5.
      <br/>
      Hybrid MH29 showed an increase in hLIF-like activity in terms of binding to both the mLIF-R  ALPHA -chain and the hLIF-R  ALPHA -chain, as did hybrid MH32 to a lesser extent, thus defining residues Ser 107 as being the residue in the region between residues 103-109 that was responsible for its contribution to the overall hLIF-like activity.
    </p>
    <p num="94">
      Assuming that the contribution of each amino acid to hLIF-specific activity was additive, hybrid MH33 was constructed in order to test that the residues identified in the C-helix, the C-D loop and the B-C loop could be substituted onto a mLIF framework, and reconstitute hLIF-like activity.
      <br/>
      Hybrid MH33 was a mouse framework molecule that contained the human LIF residues His 112 and Ser 113 from the C-helix, Val 155 and Lys 158 from the C-D loop, and had 72 +- 3% hLIF-like activity (FIG. 5B) and had only an 8-fold lower affinity for the hLIF-R  ALPHA -chain compared to hLIF (FIG. 5C), indicating that only 5 residues out of 180 conferred approximately three-quarters of the binding energy of hLIF.
    </p>
    <p num="95">
      The additional 25% of the binding energy of hLIF must reside in the N-terminal half of the molecule, so hybrids MH34-36 were based on MH33, but either the N-terminal tail and the A-helix, the A-B loop or the B-helix were swapped from mLIF sequence to hLIF sequence.
      <br/>
      There was no contribution to hLIF-specific activity from the N-terminal tail, the A-helix or the B-helix, but there was a large contribution from the A-B loop (FIG. 1).
      <br/>
      The contribution was subsequently shown to be in Asp 57.

    <p num="96">EXAMPLE 9</p>
    <p num="97">
      LIF was aligned to G-CSF (SEQ. ID. NO:4) using the known hLIF (SEQ. ID. NO:2) and hG-CSF amino acid sequences and the multiple sequence alignment software of Smith (1986).
      <br/>
      The alignment is shown in FIG. 4.
      <br/>
      Modelling was performed using the Homology module of the Insight software system (Biosoft Inc, San Diego) and refined using the X-PLOR package (Brunger, 1992).
      <br/>
      LIF is most closely related to OSM, CNTF, G-CSF and IL-6 (Bazan, 1991), however, G-CSF (SEQ. ID. NO:4) was used as a basis for the model as it is the only known structure of this group.
      <br/>
      The helices of the 4  ALPHA -helical bundle were designated A, B, C and D (ordered from the N-terminus) and the loops were labelled according to the helices they join.
      <br/>
      The helical segments in G-CSF (SEQ. ID. NO:4) were treated as structurally conserved regions and their co-ordinates copied to the LIF model.
      <br/>
      The region Cys 131-Ser 135 was deemed not to be part of the C-helix so as not to constrain the disulfide bridges.
      <br/>
      Both G-CSF and GH (de Vos et al, 1992) have a 310 -helix in the A-B loop, close to the A-helix, so this structural motif was also conserved and copied to the model, while the remainder of the A-B loop was copied from a loop search of the protein data bank (Bernstein, 1977).
      <br/>
      The B-C loop and C-D loop from hG-CSF were used as models for the equivalent loops in hLIF.
      <br/>
      The N-terminal loop was built by the homology module of Insight.
    </p>
    <p num="98">
      Refinement of the model was performed in several stages.
      <br/>
      The disulfide bond pairs (Nicola et al, 1993) were defined, then the model was energy minimised with the C ALPHA  co-ordinates of all regions except for the N-terminal loop held fixed, to allow the segment joins and disulfide bridges to form.
      <br/>
      The model was then surrounded by 4 layers of water.
      <br/>
      The initial refinement used simulated-annealing starting at 600 (degree)  K, then reducing by 300 (degree)  K in steps of 50 (degree)  K over 0.5 or 1.0 pico-seconds, followed by 5 pico-seconds of molecular dynamics at 300 (degree)  K. To assist in maintaining a helical structure, the side chains and loops were allowed to relax with an i-i+4 O-H distance constraint of 2.2  Angstrom  on the helices of the 4  ALPHA -helical bundle.
      <br/>
      This was then followed by 10 pico-seconds of unrestrained molecular dynamics.
      <br/>
      The resulting model is shown in FIG. 6 as a ribbon diagram (Kraulis, 1991) with the receptor binding site amino acids shown in CPK form.

      Since mLIF (SEQ. ID. NO:1), hLIF (SEQ. ID. NO:2) and all m-hLIF chimeras had an approximately equal ability to compete with �125 I�mLIF binding to the soluble mLIF-R  ALPHA -chain, and had nearly equal biological activities in a mouse cell bioassay they must contain a common binding site for the  ALPHA -chain of the mLIF-R.
      <br/>
      This binding site on the ligand (site a) presumably comprises conserved amino acid residues in the mLIF and hLIF proteins and so is invisible in our assay system.
      <br/>
      This site, however, is not sufficient to mediate binding to the hLIF-R  ALPHA -chain, or to generate enhanced binding to the mLIF-R  ALPHA -chain, which are exclusive properties of hLIF.
      <br/>
      A second site on the hLIF molecule, which we have mapped in these studies (site b) is comprised of a small number of residues in the predicted C-D loop, C-helix and B-C loop of hLIF and is proposed to mediate the exclusive properties of hLIF (SEQ. ID. NO:2).
      <br/>
      These residues form a cluster on one face of the predicted three-dimensional structure of hLIF (FIG. 6).

      The primary interaction site on the LIF ligand for its isologous receptor  ALPHA -chain is not the same in the human and mouse systems.
      <br/>
      It is proposed that hLIF (SEQ. ID. NO:2) but not mLIF (SEQ. ID. NO:1) is able to recognise a site which is conserved in both the hLIF and mLIF receptor  ALPHA -chains (site B), while the primary binding site for mLIF on the mLIF-R  ALPHA -chain (site A), is not present on the hLIF-R  ALPHA -chain.
      <br/>
      This proposed model potentially explains the low-affinity binding of mLIF and hLIF to their isologous receptor  ALPHA -chains, the inability of mLIF to bind to the hLIF-R  ALPHA -chain, and the apparent identity of the sites on the hLIF molecule that mediate both the high-affinity binding to the mLIF-R  ALPHA -chain and binding to the hLIF-R  ALPHA -chain.
      <br/>
      This appears to be the simplest model consistent with these data.
