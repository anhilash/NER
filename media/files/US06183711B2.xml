    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="1">Field of the Invention</p>
    <p num="2">The present invention relates to making and using apatite crystals, both in vitro and in vivo, and to the mitigation of the effects of hard tissue diseases.</p>
    <p num="3">Natural Sources of Apatite</p>
    <p num="4">
      Calcium hydroxyapatites, a complex calcium phosphate (Ca5 (PO4)3 OH) in crystalline form, occur naturally as geological deposits and in normal biological tissues, principally bone, cartilage, enamel, dentin, and cementum of vertebrates and in many sites of pathological calcifications such as blood vessels and skin.
      <br/>
      Essentially none of the geological and biological apatites are "pure" hydroxyapatite since they contain a variety of other ions and cations and may have different ratios of calcium to phosphorous than the pure synthetic apatites.
      <br/>
      In general, the crystals of pure synthetic apatites, geological apatites and many impure synthetically produced apatites are larger and more crystalline than the biological crystals of bone, dentin, cementum and cartilage.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      The terms "crystal" and "crystallite" may be used interchangeably in most respects; "crystallite" simply means a small crystal.
      <br/>
      A crystal is a homogeneous, solid body of a chemical element, compound, or isomorphous mixture, having a regular repeating atomic arrangement of atoms that may or may not be outwardly expressed by planar faces.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      The calcium-phosphate crystals of the bones of essentially all vertebrates have the basic crystal structure of hydroxyapatite as determined by X-ray diffraction.
      <br/>
      Indeed, the calcium-phosphate crystals of essentially all of the normally mineralized tissues of vertebrates, including enamel, dentin, cementum, and calcified cartilage, have the same general crystal structure.
      <br/>
      For the purposes of the present invention, these tissues are called "hard tissues".
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      However, the crystals of calcium phosphate found in hard tissues such as bone also contain other atoms and ions such as acid phosphate groups (H2 PO4), and carbonate ions, which do not occur in pure, synthetic hydroxyapatite.
      <br/>
      There is also good evidence that bone crystals either do not contain hydroxyl groups, or contain only very few such groups (Rey et al. (1995) Hydroxyl groups in bone mineral, Bone 16: 583-586) and is therefore more appropriately referred to as "apatite" rather than "hydroxyapatite." Moreover, many of the carbonate and phosphate groups in bone crystals are, from the structural and physical chemical points of view, unstable and very reactive, thus providing certain physical chemical and biological functional and chemical features important in the formation and dissolution of the crystals in biological tissues.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      Recent 31 P-nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy studies have demonstrated that the short-range order or environment of the H2 PO4 groups in bone crystals are distinctly different than the H2 PO4 groups in synthetic apatites and other related calcium-phosphate crystals (Wu, Ph.D. thesis M.I.T., "Solid state NMR study of bone mineral," Aug. 1992).
      <br/>
      These differences in chemical, structural, and short range order of the bone crystals compared with pure, synthetic hydroxyapatite also reflect significant differences in their reactivity and hence in their potential function in a biological environment.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      The crystals of bone, dentin and cementum are very small, irregularly shaped, very thin plates whose rough average dimensions are approximately 10 to 50 angstroms in thickness, 30 to 150 angstroms in width, and 200 to 600 angstroms in length.
      <br/>
      This results in their having a very large surface area to present to the extracellular fluids which is critically important for the rapid exchange of ions with the extracellular fluids.
      <br/>
      This "ion-reservoir" function of the inorganic crystals is very important for a number of critical biological functions.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      For a description of the determination of the size of bone crystals, see Ziv, V., and Weiner, S. (1994) Bone Crystal Sizes: A comparison of transmission electron microscopic and X-ray diffraction line width broadening techniques.

      <br/>
      Most investigators of bone structure prefer to rely on measurements of X-ray diffraction reflection line widths.
      <br/>
      This parameter is directly related to coherence length, that is the average distance between lattice dislocations in a given direction.

      Synthetic calcium hydroxyapatite is formed in the laboratory either as pure Ca5 (PO4)3 (OH) or hydroxyapatite that is impure, containing other ions such as carbonate, fluoride, chloride for example, or crystals deficient in calcium or crystals in which calcium is partly or completely replaced by other ions such as barium, strontium and lead.
      <br/>
      Systems for forming apatite by precipitating solutes are known from the literature.
      <br/>
      In these processes, hydroxyapatite precipitates in very finely crystalline form in nearly all solutions.
    </p>
    <p num="15">
      Some examples of methods for the precipitation of hydroxyapatite, the properties of the apatite product, and possible applications are discussed below.
      <br/>
      For the purposes of this invention, the term "apatite" signifies any of the forms of apatite in which the hydroxyl groups are replaced by other anions.
    </p>
    <p num="16">
      It is known from U.S. Pat. No. 4,274,879, for example, to prepare hydroxyapatite by mixing milk of lime with at least 60% phosphoric acid in stoichiometric amounts at temperatures of 80 (degree)  C.-85 (degree)  C., and a pH of the reaction solution of about 9.0-11.0 in a continuous reaction.
      <br/>
      The products obtained are suitable for preparing bone replacement parts by sintering at temperatures of 700 (degree)  C. They are unsuitable as tooth-cleaning substances on account of their fineness.
      <br/>
      Additional examples of such methods, products, and applications are disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,324,772 and 4,849,193.
    </p>
    <p num="17">
      Apatites in which the OH.-- is replaced with simple anions, including F--, Br--, I--, or carbonate, may be prepared by modifying the process for preparing hydroxyapatite.
      <br/>
      Apatite derivatives in which calcium is replaced by metal ions, such as paramagnetic, radiopaque, or radioactive metal ions, may also be prepared and used within the scope of the present invention.
      <br/>
      Useful apatites may also be prepared by replacing phosphate with oxyanions or tetrahedral anions containing radiopaque or radioactive metal species.
      <br/>
      Stoichiometric pure hydroxyapatite has a Ca:P ratio of 1.67:1. The major impurity found in hydroxyapatite is tricalcium phosphate, Ca3 (PO4)2, known as "TCP." This impurity can be detected by deviation from the 1.67:1 Ca:P ratio (for large amounts of impurity) or by X-ray diffraction for impurity levels down to 1 percent.
      <br/>
      Stoichiometric hydroxyapatite is prepared by adding an ammonium phosphate solution to a solution of calcium/ ammonium hydroxide.
      <br/>
      To minimize the amount of TCP formed, it is important to have excess calcium throughout the addition process.
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      U.S. Pat. No 5,460,803 to Ming S. Tung issued Oct. 24, 1995 discloses two apatite-forming-systems.
      <br/>
      The first system particularly involves the use of amorphous calcium compounds such as: amorphous calcium phosphate, amorphous calcium phosphate fluoride, amorphous calcium carbonate phosphate, and amorphous calcium carbonate phosphate fluoride.
      <br/>
      The compounds have the highest solubilities, fastest formation rates and fastest conversion rates to apatite among all the calcium phosphates under physiological conditions.
      <br/>
      Moreover, in the presence of fluoride the amorphous compounds convert rapidly to fluoride containing apatite.
      <br/>
      In a unique aspect, the method takes advantage of the solvent qualities of ethanol.
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      In a second apatite-forming-system disclosed by U.S. Pat. 5,460,803, the amorphous calcium compounds are formed, in situ, as an intermediate prior to the precipitation of the apatite.
      <br/>
      The method uses carbonated solutions containing calcium ions, fluoride ions, carbonate ions and phosphate ions, maintained under a pressurized carbon dioxide atmosphere.
      <br/>
      Under the pressurized carbon dioxide atmosphere, the solutions have a lower pH and are stable.
      <br/>
      When applied under atmospheric pressure, carbon dioxide escapes, causing the pH to increase.
      <br/>
      This increase in pH results in a supersaturated solution and ultimately rapid precipitation of apatite.
    </p>
    <p num="20">Effect of Electrical Charge and Stress on In Vivo Apatite-Forming-Systems</p>
    <p num="21">
      Hydroxyapatite is piezoelectric; that is, it generates an electric charge when mechanically stressed.
      <br/>
      The electric signals generated by hydroxyapatite when bone is placed under stress ("bone talk") are detected by nearby bone cells, stimulating them to increase the production of hydroxyapatite.
      <br/>
      This increase in production of hydroxyapatite due to "bone talk" appears to be part of a feedback mechanism causing bone to be strengthened automatically at points of stress concentration.
      <br/>
      This feedback mechanism is weakened or interrupted in areas surrounding a bone fracture since stress concentrations at the fracture are typically nil.
      <br/>
      A similar feedback mechanism seems to control the mineral content of intact bone.
      <br/>
      When normal "bone talk" is no longer communicated to surrounding cells, the production of hydroxyapatite decreases and osteoporosis (meaning "brittle bones") can result.
      <br/>
      Restoration of the piezoelectric signal can slow or reverse this condition.
    </p>
    <p num="22">
      Optimum waveforms, generated by alternating current signals, can nearly double the rate of bone healing in ordinary fractures, and restart healing in nonunion fractures, i.e. those fractures in which normal healing has stopped without rejoining the pieces of the broken bone.
      <br/>
      The conventional treatment of non-union fractures involves surgical procedures which are often unsuccessful and invariably increases both the discomfort and expense incurred by the patient.
      <br/>
      The use of electronic stimulation as a method of treating fractured bones has reduced the reliance on conventional surgery.

      To protect a normal tooth, a thin layer of dental enamel forms a protective coating over the tooth.
      <br/>
      This coating consists mainly of calcium, phosphate, and other ions in a hydroxyapatite-like structure.
      <br/>
      The enamel contains 2-5 percent carbonate; this carbonate content makes the enamel susceptible to acid dissolution.

    <p num="27">Bone Formation and Renewal</p>
    <p num="28">
      Bone is a highly specialized connective tissue with unique mechanical properties derived from its extensive matrix structure.
      <br/>
      A network of fibrous bundles composed of collagen is presumed to provide the tension-resistant behavior of bone.
      <br/>
      In addition, other materials including proteoglycans, noncollagenous proteins, lipids and acidic proteins associated with a mineral phase consisting primarily of poorly crystallized hydroxyapatite are deposited in the extensive matrix architecture of bone.
      <br/>
      Bone tissue is continuously renewed, by a process referred to as remodeling, throughout the life of mammals.
      <br/>
      This physiologic process might serve to maintain the properties of a young tissue.
    </p>
    <p num="29">
      The processes of bone formation and renewal are described by Mundy in "Bone Remodeling and Its Disorders" (1995, pub. Martin Dunitz).
      <br/>
      Osteogenesis vis-a-vis morphogenesis and growth of bone is presumably carried out by "osteoblasts" (bone-forming cells).
      <br/>
      Remodeling of bone is apparently brought about by an interplay between the activities of the bone-resorbing cells called "osteoclasts" and the bone-forming osteoblasts.
      <br/>
      The bony skeleton is thus not only an architectural structure with a mechanical function but also is a living tissue capable of growth, modeling, remodeling and repair.
      <br/>
      Since these processes are carried out by specialized living cells, chemical (pharmaceutical/ hormonal), physical and physicochemical alterations can affect the quality, quantity and shaping of bone tissue.
    </p>
    <p num="30">
      The adult skeleton is composed of 80% cortical and 20% trabecular bone.
      <br/>
      Bone matrix is composed of 25% collagen, 65% inorganic material, and 10% non-cellular proteins (i.e., osteocalcin, silaoprotein, proteoglycans and osteonectin) and lipids.
      <br/>
      The term "mature bone" relates to bone that is mineralized, in contrast to non-mineralized bone such as osteoid.
      <br/>
      Osteoblasts synthesize and secrete Type 1 collagen and mucopolysaccharides to form the bone matrix which is laid down between the thin layers of osteoid.
      <br/>
      The layers are subsequently mineralized with 99% of the body's calcium found in the bone as a calcium phosphate complex with hydroxyapatite.
    </p>
    <p num="31">Conditions that Affect Bone Strength</p>
    <p num="32">
      A number of dangerous and painful disabilities are caused by the excessive resorption of bone.
      <br/>
      For example, rheumatoid arthritis and periodontitis (both associated with erosive joint disease) osteoporosis, and the failure of prostheses to remain tightly bonded to the underying bone are all characterized by the excessive resorption of existing bone.
      <br/>
      Medical research has studied such conditions for some time, but problems have not yet been resolved and treatment methods remain only partially satisfactory.
    </p>
    <p num="33">
      Osteoporosis is generally associated with a reduced trabecular bone volume leading to increased risk of bone fractures.
      <br/>
      This process is probably due to a metabolic imbalance between the rates of new bone formation and bone resorption.
      <br/>
      Osteoporosis can be divided into two dasses: (1) type I or post-menopausal, which is related to reductions in estrogen content and affects primarily trabecular bone, and (2) type II or senile, which is related to reduced calcium absorption and affects primarily cortical bone.
    </p>
    <p num="34">
      Bone resorption can be divided into two processes which are probably being carried out concurrently.
      <br/>
      Phase I involves the inorganic metabolism conducted principally by osteoclasts, macrophages, monocytes, polymorphonudeocytes (PMNs), and fibroblasts.
      <br/>
      Osteodasts are multi-nucleated cells which reabsorb calcium from bone and cartilage. his process is regulated by parathyroid hormone (PTH), Pg-E.2, and cAMP which activate lysosomal hydrolytic enzymes and causes solubilization of the minerals in the bone, releasing calcium to the blood.
      <br/>
      Phase II involves organic metabolism where there is proteolytic destruction of the bone matrix collagen, releasing hydroxyproline to the blood.
      <br/>
      This process is initiated by the release of collagenase and cathepsin D from osteoblasts at the bone surface.
      <br/>
      The cellular enzymes belong to the metalloproteinase group of proteolytic enzymes which usually function at neutral pH.
      <br/>
      PITH binds to membrane receptors on osteoblasts, pre-osteoblasts and osteocytes, which activates the release of calcium from the dense bone, probably due to the activation of lysosomal enzymes, e.g., cathepsins, CAMP, interleukin-1, or prostaglandins.
    </p>
    <p num="35">
      Estrogen, progesterone, testosterone and vitamin D3 levels decrease with age.
      <br/>
      With advanced age there is a reduction of calcitonin that severely reduces calcium absorption from the gut.
      <br/>
      There is a positive correlation between the extracellular reduction of these physiological parameters and with osteoporosis.
      <br/>
      Other factors are: smoking, lack of exercise, sunlight, and disease states like myeloma, skeletal metastasis, gastric surgery, anti-convulsant therapy, male hypogonadism, thyrotoxicosis, amenorrhea, anorexia nervosa, hyperprolactinanemia, diabetes mellitus, immobilization, osteogenic imperfecta, and homocystinuria.

      Apatite preparations have been proposed for use as bone inductors (to induce bone formation) and osteoconductors (by acting as scaffolds to facilitate continuous progression of new bone formation).
      <br/>
      These apatite preparations are mostly of synthetic origin and distinct structurally and chemically from the biological calcium-phosphate crystals in bone.
      <br/>
      All of these apatites are not only chemically and structurally distinct from the apatite crystals of bone, especially in their short range order, size and reactivity, but in some cases, they contain varying amounts of amorphous calciumphosphate, that is, calcium-phosphate solids which are not crystalline at all.
      <br/>
      In other instances, the calcium-phosphates made synthetically also contain calcium salts other than apatite crystals such as calcium oxides.

      Other uses of apatite are diverse.
      <br/>
      For example, U.S. Pat. No. 5,427,754 to Nagata et al. issued Jun. 27, 1995 describes the use of apatite as an adsorbent in chromatography.
      <br/>
      The kind of protein adsorbed on hydroxyapatite varies with the kind of crystal faces of the hydroxyapatite.

      Living organisms are also apatite-forming-systems.

      In recent years, interest has been shown in the osteoconductive properties of a physiologically formed hydroxyapatite substratum that is obtained from living organisms.
      <br/>
      Thus, U.S. Pat. No. 5,439,951 to Glimcher et al. issued Aug. 8, 1995 provides a process for isolating from the biologically, naturally formed crystals of bone a purified apatite that is substantially free of organic material.

      Another example is a porous hydroxyapatite substratum that is obtained after hydrothermal conversion of the calcium carbonate exoskeletal microstructure of the scleractinian reef-building corals, Porites and Goniopora.
      <br/>
      This hydroxyapatite is characterized by a relatively uniform network of interconnected channels and pores, similar to the mineralized inorganic supporting structure of living bone.
      <br/>
      Experimental evidence has established the osteoconductive properties of the porous substratum when it is implanted in orthotopic sites, and the material has been used experimentally in reconstructive operations, particularly craniofacial procedures, as an alternative to autogenous bone grafts.

      The present invention is directed to processes and products that satisfy the need to (1) mitigate the effects of hard tissues diseases; (2) provide apatite compositions suitable for a variety of uses.
      <br/>
      Embodiments of the present invention significantly mitigate the effects of many hard-tissue diseases by providing methods and compositions for strengthening apatite in teeth and in bones.
      <br/>
      One manifestation of the improved apatite is larger crystallite size.
      <br/>
      Larger crystallite size confers resistance to dissolution.
      <br/>
      An understanding of the inverse relationship between crystallite size and dissolution rate helps to predict the properties of apatite having a large crystallite size.
      <br/>
      The present invention is constituted, however, without limitation by a relationship between crystallite size and the dissolution rate of apatite.

      The effect of methylation at R1, R2, and R3 of formula I and of most combinations and permutations thereof have been tested by the present inventors.
      <br/>
      The inventors thus provide extensive guidance on the effect of the methyl substitutions and combinations and permutations of substitutions on the xanthine ring on apatite crystallinity.
      <br/>
      This guidance will enable one skilled in the art to identify additional alkylated xanthines with desirable effects on apatite crystallinity without undue experimentation.
      <br/>
      Nevertheless, when it is difficult to predict the exact effect of the alkylation in advance of doing so, one skilled in the art will appreciate that the effect will be evaluated by routine screening assays without undue experimentation.
      <br/>
      Such alkylated xanthines are commonly available.
      <br/>
      The Aldrich Chemical Co. catalog (Aldrich Chemical Co., Catalog handbook of fine chemicals, (1994-95), Aldrich Chemical Co., Inc. Milwaukee, WI) for example, lists many substituted xanthines that might have desirable effects on apatite crystallinity.

      The present invention provides an apatite-forming-system, comprising a solution containing solutes capable of forming apatite and an partially alkylated xanthine.
      <br/>
      An additional embodiment of the invention is a method for increasing the crystallite size of apatite by contacting an apatite-forming-system with an effective amount of an partially alkylated xanthine.
      <br/>
      An apatite-forming-system may comprise an in vitro system, such as a solution of mineral salts, or an in vivo system, such as an animal.
      <br/>
      An animal may form a steady-state in vivo system, or an in vivo system wherein the mass of the apatite increases.
      <br/>
      It is recognized that measurements of crystal or crystallite size using different techniques may produce different absolute values.
      <br/>
      For the purposes of this invention "crystallite size" refers to a relative measurement obtained by comparing matched samples of apatite, wherein one sample has been contacted with a test compound such as a xanthine, and the other has not, and everything else is equal.
    </p>

      <br/>
      Another embodiment of the present invention comprises processes for forming apatite by contacting an apatite-forming-system with an effective amount of a partially alkylated xanthine.
      <br/>
      The term "effective amount" shall mean that amount of a substance that will elicit the desired effect of an apatite-forming-system on crystals formed therefrom.

    <heading>TOXICOLOGY</heading>
    <p num="100">
      For an extensive review of the toxicology of methylxanthines see Tarka, S. M. (1982) CRC Critical Reviews in Toxicology 9: 275-312.
      <br/>
      Cocoa is a major source of theobromine, where it is present in a concentration of approximately 1.89%. Tarka's critical review of the toxicology literature of methylxanthines demonstrates that cocoa per se has no reported adverse effects that would be injurious to man.
      <br/>
      According to Tarka, Zoumas and Gans (Short-term effects of graded levels of theobromine in laboratory rodents; Toxicol. and Applied Pharmacol. 49: 127-149 (1979), a diet containing a toxic level of theobromine (0.6% theobromine) provided the mature male rat with a theobromine intake of 310 mg/kg/day.
      <br/>
      This corresponds to a daily intake of approximately 18 g of theobromine for a 65 kg human.
      <br/>
      This level intake could be attained by the daily ingestion of approximately 171 1-oz bars of milk chocolate, assuming approximately 105 mg of theobromine/bar.
      <br/>
      Estimates of theobromine content of a 1-oz milk chocolate bar range from approximately 45 to 105 mg (Zoumas, B. L., Kreiser, W. R., and Martin, R. A. Theobromine and caffeine content of chocolate products J. Food Sci. 45: 314-316 (1980); Tarka, Zoumas and Gans (Short-term effects of graded levels of theobromine in laboratory rodents; Toxicol. and Applied Pharmacol. 49: 127-149 (1979)).
      <br/>
      Plasma half-life of theobromine in humans is about six hours (Resman, B. H., Blumenthal, H. P., and Jusko, W. J. Breast Milk distribution of theobromine from chocolate. J. Pediat. 91: 477-480 (1977); Drouilard, D. D., Vesell, E. S., and Dvorchick, B. N. Studies on theobromine disposition in normal subjects.
      <br/>
      Clin. Pharmacol. Ther. 23: 296-302 (1978).
      <br/>
      In rats, the half life of theobromine in plasma is about three hours (Welch, R. M., Hsu, S. Y., and DeAngeles, R. L. Effect of araclor 1254, phenobarbitol and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons on the plasma clearance of caffeine in the rat.
      <br/>
      Clin. Pharmacol. Ther. 22: 791-798 (1977)).
      <br/>
      Thus, to attain a toxic level of theobromine, a 65 kg human would be required to eat about 86 1-oz milk chocolate bars/ day.

    <heading>NUTRITIONAL SUPPLEMENT</heading>
    <p num="102">
      Nutritional supplements for combatting conditions associated with bone-related diseases are known.
      <br/>
      Such a supplement, which for the purposes of the claims of the present application are regarded as pharmaceutical compositions, is in the form of a topically administrable composition, e.g. a cream, gel or ointment, a parenterally administrable composition, e.g. an aqueous solution, or an orally administrable composition, e.g. tablets or capsules and, particularly, orally administrable compositions in which the partially alkylated xanthine is provided with a gastric juice resistant release delaying coating.
      <br/>
      Thus in one preferred embodiment of the invention the pharmaceutical composition of the invention takes the form of a nutritional supplement.
    </p>
    <p num="103">
      Such nutritional supplements, which most preferably are sterile, may be in a form adapted for enteral, parenteral or topical administration, but most preferably will be in a form adapted for oral ingestion.
      <br/>
      The nutritional supplement may take the form of dietary supplement, such as a foodstuff.
      <br/>
      The nutritional supplement may alternatively be in a conventional pharmaceutical dosage form adapted for administration to the gastrointestinal tract.
    </p>
    <p num="104">
      In this regard, forms such as tablets, coated tablets, capsules, powders, drops, suspensions, solutions, syrups and suppositories deserve particular mention.
      <br/>
      Nevertheless as partially alkylated xanthine nutritional supplementation may be achieved by parenteral or topical administration, for example by injection or by topical application (e.g. of an ointment, lotion, cream, paste or gel or the like), or by transdermal iontophoretic delivery, the nutritional supplement may be in the form of a composition adapted for one of these administration modes.
    </p>
    <p num="105">Where the nutritional supplement is prepared in a conventional pharmaceutical dosage form it may of course also contain conventional pharmaceutical carriers or excipients.</p>
    <p num="106">
      For oral administration, the nutritional supplement may conveniently take the form of a foodstuff, for example a food or drink mix, into which a partially alkylated xanthine is incorporated.
      <br/>
      The nutritional supplement may particularly suitably be in the form of a so-called "complete" foodstuff, analogous to those which are prepared to serve as the major or sole source of nutrition for example for people wishing to loose weight, for post-operative patients, for elderly patients, for convalescents, or for individuals with specific dietary needs (e.g. patients with diabetes, coeliac disease or cystic fibrosis).
      <br/>
      For most people, however, a partially alkylated xanthine supplemented foodstuff will preferably be of a type that is ingested daily in similar quantities, and for this reason the supplement will particularly conveniently comprise the partially alkylated xanthine and a cereal or legume foodstuffs base.
      <br/>
      The nutritional supplement may take the form of a partially alkylated xanthine containing multi-vitamin/multi-mineral preparation, for example in the form of tablets, capsules, or drops, especially enteric coated tablets or capsules.
      <br/>
      In this regard, compositions are especially preferred which contain the partially alkylated xanthines together with sources of one, some or all of the vitamins and the other essential elements.
      <br/>
      In another embodiment, the partially alkylated xanthines may be incorporated into an enteral alimentation solution.
      <br/>
      The nutritional supplement may, however, contain the partially alkylated xanthines as the only active ingredients.
    </p>
    <p num="107">For topical administration, the nutritional supplement will again preferably be in a form adapted for regular application in substantially similar quantities and thus the partially alkylated xanthines may particularly conveniently be incorporated within cosmetics, such as facial creams and ointments and the like.</p>
    <p num="108">
      The partially methylated xanthine content in the nutritional supplement will be selected according to the nature of the supplement and its administration route but in general will be within the range 1 mg/ 100 g body weight.
      <br/>
      This amount is comparable to consumption of one to seven 1-oz milk chocolate bars by a 65 kg human.
      <br/>
      Any effective concentration, however, is satisfactory as long as unwanted side facts are tolerable.
    </p>
    <p num="109">Thus, for example in complete foods which might be administered in a dose of 500 g/day, a partially alkylated xanthine content of 50 to 1000 mg might be contemplated.</p>
    <p num="110">Such nutritional supplements may be used to combat a wide range of conditions associated with essential chemical deficiency, in particular conditions which appear to be associated with diseases of the hard tissue, and the uses and methods of the invention are deemed to relate to the treatment of such conditions as well as the conditions mentioned earlier herein.</p>
    <p num="111">
      The compositions of the invention may of course contain further ingredients, such as for example conventional pharmaceutical or topical disinfectant formulation aids, e.g. emulsifiers, extenders, flavours, colouring agents, surfactants, pH adjusting agents, ointment bases, geling agents, propellants, stabilizers and the like.
      <br/>
      The compositions may also contain other physiologically active agents.

    <p num="113">In the following experiments, the present inventors have demonstrated the effects of partially alkylated xanthines on 4 apatite-forming-systems, one in vitro and three in vivo.</p>
    <p num="114">The apatite-forming-systems and parameters examined include (1) crystallite size of apatite crystallized from dilute salt solution; (2) dissolution rates, crystallite size, and chemical composition of apatite formed in the first molars of suckling (22 day) rats; (3) mechanical strength, electron micrographs, and chemical composition of femurs from 29 day rats; (4) crystallite size of bone apatite formed in ovariectomized rats (69 days).</p>
    <p num="115">
      It is evident from the attached results that methylxanthines, except caffeine, enhance crystallinity of apatite grown in vitro.
      <br/>
      In vivo, our results indicate that theobromine also enhances crystallinity, mechanical strength, and dissolution resistance of apatite.
      <br/>
      Our results do not indicate a more intense mineralization of either bone or tooth material.
      <br/>
      Evidently, no additional apatite material is deposited in either bones or teeth, but the crystallite size is increased in animals exposed to theobromine, making the apatite less easily dissolved.
      <br/>
      Application of these compounds may have profound effects on the health of human bone and teeth.
    </p>
    <p num="116">
      The present unique discovery may have application in combating bone and dental disease by taking the proper amount of these methylxanthines at the appropriate time.
      <br/>
      Our present discovery of methylxanthines' role in calcification is unique and could lead to an enormous commercial advantage for various types of industry.
      <br/>
      The amount of theobromine added to the diet in the present study was minute, and this is a further advantage of these methylxanthines.
    </p>
    <p num="117">
      From these experimental results, it will be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art that many changes and modifications can be made thereto without departing from the spirit or scope of the appended claims.
      <br/>
      More specifically, it will be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art that partially alkylated xanthines may be used to modify any apatite-forming-system, including but not limited to, those described herein.

    <p num="118">
      The development and use of the ovariectomized rat model is described by Kalu, D. N. (1991) (The ovariectomized rat model of postmenopausal bone loss.
      <br/>
      Bone and Mineral, 15: 175-192).
    </p>
    <p num="119">
      The age of the animals chosen for an experiment is a significant factor in the model.
      <br/>
      In general, young animals exhibit more turnover in bone structure, and thus the effects of any drugs administered tends to be faster and higher when young animals are used.
    </p>
    <p num="120">Having now generally described the present invention, the same will be more readily understood through reference to the following examples which are provided by way of illustration, and are not intended to be limiting of the present invention.</p>
    <p num="121">EXAMPLE 1</p>
    <p num="122">In Vitro Studies</p>
    <p num="123">In vitro experiments of growing apatite from dilute solutions of CaCl2 and Na3 PO4 were performed.</p>
    <p num="124">
      All solutions contained 0.01 molar CaCl2 and NA3 PO4.
      <br/>
      Several sets of experiments were performed with the addition of each of the methylxanthines or uric acid at two concentrations, 50 mg and 200 mg/liter.
      <br/>
      The effect of the xanthine compounds was compared with a control solution containing CaCl2 and Na3 PO4 only.
    </p>
    <p num="125">
      Solutions were mixed at 25 (degree)  C. and the pH adjusted to 9-9.5 with 0.1 molar NaOH and left to crystallize for 20 days.
      <br/>
      The crystalline precipitate was washed 5 times with distilled water and prepared for X-ray diffraction which was performed on a "SCINTAG XDS 2000" (tm)  X-ray diffractometer.
      <br/>
      The instrument was operated at 40 kV potential and 20 mA current.
      <br/>
      Scans were performed using step scan mode with 0.02 step increments and 3 seconds dwell time.
      <br/>
      The (300) reflection was scanned to investigate crystallinity.
    </p>
    <p num="126">The following results in terms of FWHM (full width-half maximum peak height) divided by maximum peak height (FWHM/M) and for the (300) reflection is given in Table 1 for the control and the xanthine compounds.</p>

      From the data, it appears that the experiments run with theobromine (FIGS. 5, 6, &amp; 7) or 3-methyl xanthine (FIG. 8) show the most pronounced increases in crystallinity, compated to controls (FIGS. 3 &amp; 4).
      <br/>
      This is evident from lower values of the ratios FWHM/M compared to the control (Table 1).
      <br/>
      Lower values of this ratio indicate better crystallinity.
      <br/>
      All of the methylated xanthines, except caffeine, increased the crystallinity of the precipitating apatite.
      <br/>
      In every case, the crystallinity increased with xanthine concentration.
      <br/>
      Caffeine and uric acid decreased the cystallinity of the apatite, also in a dose-dependent manner.
    </p>
    <p num="129">In Vivo Experiments</p>
    <p num="130">The overall plan of examples 2, 3, and 4 is depicted in FIG. 1.</p>
    <p num="131">EXAMPLE 2</p>
    <p num="132">Studies of First Molars From Day 22 Rats</p>
    <p num="133">
      Timed pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats were purchased from the breeder (Holtzman strain).
      <br/>
      They were maintained on a 12 hour light/ dark cycle and fed laboratory chow and water ad lib.
      <br/>
      At term, litters delivered within an 8 h period were combined and designated as day 1; eight pups were randomly assigned to each dam.
      <br/>
      Then, the dams with the recombined litters were divided into two groups.
      <br/>
      Dams from group 1 (N=8) were fed a 20% protein diet.
      <br/>
      Those from group 2 (N=8) were fed a 20% protein diet supplemented with theobromine.
      <br/>
      The composition of the 20% protein diet is casein, 200 g; dextrose, 191 g; sucrose, 178 g; dextrin, 192 g; mazola corn oil, 150 ml; mineral mix ("Rogers-Harper Mineral Mix" (tm) ), 40 g; choline chloride 50% (w/ v), 4 ml; cellulose, 35 g; and vitamin mix ("AIN Vitamin Mixture 76" (tm) ), 10 g. The theobromine supplementation was 1 mg/100 of the dam's body weight until weaning at day 22, and 1 mg/100 g of the offspring's body weight after weaning.
      <br/>
      We adjusted the theobromine supplement in the maternal and offspring's diets based upon their weight and food intake in order to maintain a constant ratio of theobromine (1 mg/100 g body weight).
      <br/>
      Theobromine supplementation in the diet was followed in exactly the same way as caffeine supplementation in the diet in out previous studies (see Nakamoto, T. and Shaye, R. Protein-energy malnutrition in rats during pregnancy modifies the effect of caffeine on fetal bones. J. Nutr. 116:633-640, 1986).
      <br/>
      The amount of theobromine supplemented to the maternal diet corresponded to approximately 8.8 mg/100 g diet or 0.0088% for days 1-14; for days 14-22, it was 5.9 mg/100 g diet or 0.0059%. After weaning, theobromine added to the offspring's diet was 8.9 mg/100 g diet or 0.0089% for days 22-29.
      <br/>
      The theobromine intake by the dams during lactation and the growing period of the offspring per day was comparable to approximately one to seven 1-oz milk chocolate bar by a 65 kg human, after adjustment for size and pharmacokinetics (Tarka, S. M., Zoumas, B. L. and Gans, J. H. Short-term effects of graded levels of theobromine in laboratory rodents.
      <br/>
      Toxicol. Appl. Pharmcol. 49:127-149, 1979).
      <br/>
      Note that the intake of theobromine by the suckling offspring was much lower than that of the dams, since the only source of theobromine intake by the pups came from the dam's milk, at least up to day 15.
      <br/>
      From day 15 to day 22 the pups start nibbling the dam's food which contains theobromine.
    </p>
    <p num="134">
      The amount of theobromine that rats consumed in this experiment has an equivalent human consumption, in proportion to body weight and pharmacokinetic differences.
      <br/>
      For the most accurate estimate, the extrapolation should be adjusted either for the pharmacokinetics of theobromine metabolism (Resman, B. H., Blumenthal, H. P., and Jusko, W. J. Breast milk distribution of theobromine from chocolate. J. Pediat. 91: 477-480 (1977); Drouillard, D. D., Vesell, E. S., and Dvorchick, B. N. Studies on theobromine disposition in normal subjects.
      <br/>
      Clin. Pharmacol. Ther. 23: 296-302 (1978), or metabolic body size.
      <br/>
      In humans, the half life of theobromine in plasma is about 6 hours; in rats, it is about three hours (Welch, R. M., Hsu, S. Y., and DeAngeles, R. L. Effect of araclor 1254, phenobarbitol and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons on the plasma clearance of caffeine in the rat.
      <br/>
      Clin. Pharmacol. Ther. 22: 791-798).
      <br/>
      The amount of theobromine used in the current experiment (1 mg/100 g body weight) is equivalent to human dose of 650 mg/kg.
      <br/>
      Assuming that the theobromine content of a one oz. bar of milk chocolate is 45 to 105 mg as stated previously, approximate intake of theobromine becomes three to seven bars of one oz. milk chocolate, when extrapolated using pharmacokinetics of theobromine metabolism.
      <br/>
      When the conversion is based on the metabolic body weight (kg0.75), (Kleiber, M. In: The fire of life, an introduction to animal energetics.
      <br/>
      New York Wiley andsons, p. 177-216 (1961)) the present dosage (1 mg/100 g body weight) in rats is equivalent to 129 mg/65 kg0.75. This corresponds approximately to slightly more than one to three bars of one oz. milk chocolate for a 65 kg human.
    </p>
    <p num="135">
      On day 22, maternal milk and blood were collected.
      <br/>
      Then randomly selected pups were killed; their blood was collected; and first molars of the mandible and maxilla were removed.
      <br/>
      Randomly selected first molars were mounted with a sticky wax on a small plastic block in order to study the acid solubility on the enamel. surface.
      <br/>
      First molars were examined later by electron microprobe analysis and X-ray diffractometry (FIG. 2).
      <br/>
      FIGS. 9-11 show the statistical significance between control and experimental groups of the minerals dissolved from 1st molars.

    <p num="136">
      Calcium and phosphorus concentrations were determined in enamel of first molars extracted from theobromine exposed rats or control rats by an "ARL" (tm)  electron microprobe analysis.
      <br/>
      The instrument was operated at an acceleration potential of 15 kV and a beam current of 1.0 * 10-7 A. A fluorapatite from Cerro de Mercado, Mexico, was used as a standard.
      <br/>
      The results obtained are shown in Table 2.

      From the data of Table 2, the overall contents of CaO and P2 O5 appear comparable within the expected margin of error.

    <p num="141">Femurs at 29 Days</p>
    <p num="142">
      On day 29, the remaining offspring were killed, blood was collected, and the femur removed.
      <br/>
      Femurs were cleaned and dried overnight at 85 (degree)  C. Crystalline phases in the femurs were examined by scanning electron microscopy.
      <br/>
      An "AMRAY 1820" (tm)  digital scanning electron microscope was used in the study.
      <br/>
      The instrument was operated at an acceleration potential of 15 kV, a working distance of 18 mm, a 300 micron final aperture was used, and a spot size of 4.0 was employed in the study.
      <br/>
      Flat polished and etched (3 percent acetic acid, 20 seconds each time) cross sections of femur were investigated.
      <br/>
      It was noted that etching was generally more intense in the control group.
    </p>
    <p num="143">
      Remnant structures in the bone appeared coarser in the experimental group (FIG. 12) than in the control group (FIG. 13).
      <br/>
      Higher magnifications are shown (FIG. 14).
    </p>
    <p num="144">
      Femurs were removed, powdered and examined with a "SCINTAG XDS 2000" (tm)  X-ray diffractometer. X-ray diffractometry (FIG. 15) of a female femur at 29 days showed larger crystallites in the experimental group than in the control.
      <br/>
      This figure illustrates the increased crystallinity, as shown by the smaller FWHM/M, of the experimental group relative to the control group.
    </p>
    <p num="145">
      X-ray diffraction procedures can be used to obtain information on crystallite-size of a sample within a limited range.
      <br/>
      A method of measuring this is to obtain measurements of reflection width/ reflection height ratios.
      <br/>
      This is typically referred to as the "Full width-half maximum" (FWHM) value, calculated by measuring the peak breadth at half the peak height.
      <br/>
      A sample of a crystalline compound with a crystallite or particle size of about 10-3 cm will produce the sharpest peaks with smallest "FWHM" values; whereas, a sample with a particle size of 10-6 cm will produce far broader, more diffuse peaks.
      <br/>
      Thus, if crystallite size of a material is a size range of approximately 0-1000  Angstrom ngstr.o slashed.oms, it is possible to estimate or compare crystallite sizes of the material by measuring the FWHM values.
      <br/>
      The mathematical relationship is as follows:
      <br/>
      B=0.9 l/t cosq
    </p>
    <p num="146">where B is the broadening of the diffraction line measured at half its maximum intensity</p>
    <p num="147">
      t is the particle size
      <br/>
      l is the x-ray wavelength used
      <br/>
      q is the glancing angle of the X-ray beam with the crystal lattice plane in question.
    </p>
    <p num="148">
      It is relatively simple to directly compare the crystallinity of two compounds by comparing one or more reflections of the material's spectrum.
      <br/>
      For apatite, the reflection of the plane (300) is commonly used for this purpose.
      <br/>
      In many cases, the ratio of FWHM/M (M=peak intensity or peak height) is used for reporting crystallinity.
      <br/>
      Table 3 shows various parameters measured at day 22 and 29.
      <br/>
      Table 4 shows the femur's wet weight and length.
      <br/>
      There was no significant difference (Student T-test) between the control and theobromine group on any parameter measured (P&gt;0.05).
      <br/>
      This is important since there was no indication in any parameters of the theobromine group of any adverse effects.
      <br/>
      We have concentrated on the plasma levels of Cu and Zn to see if any changes between the group occurred, since our studies on caffeine show decreased Zn and Cu concentrations in the plasma.

      The femurs from 29 day old female animals in the control and experimental groups were subjected to a mechanical property study.
      <br/>
      The femurs, which were kept in air tight glass bottles in the freezer, were defrosted.
      <br/>
      Mechanical properties were measured using an "Unstring" (tm)  Universal Testing Instrument.
      <br/>
      Yield stress in megapascals (Mpa) was found to be 43653 +- 2361 (mean +- SEM), in the control group (N=10) and 48040 +- 2660 in the experimental group (N=7).
      <br/>
      The experimental group showed an approximate 10% increase.
      <br/>
      Maximum (failure) stress was 21362 +- 766 in the control (N=10) and 23577 +- 1040 in the experimental group (N=7).

      This showed about a 21% increase in the experimental group over the control.
      <br/>
      When yield stress, maximum stress and Young's modulus of elasticity are considered, one can conclude that female femurs in the experimental group were stronger and stiffer and show relatively less deformation under applied loading.
      <br/>
      Femur volume (ml) was 0.273.+- 0 (slashed zero) 019 in the control (N=11) and 0.286.+- 0 (slashed zero) 014 in the experimental group (N=7).

      Female rats were ovariectomized at day 30 and then those in the experimental group were fed a diet with the same amount of substance as previously used.
      <br/>
      The females in the control group were fed the diet without experimental substance.
      <br/>
      Both groups of animals were killed at day 69 or 70.
      <br/>
      Femurs were removed, powdered and examined with a "SCINTAG XDS 2000" (tm)  X-ray diffractometer.
      <br/>
      This X-ray diffractometry of the female femurs showed larger crystallites in the experimental group (upper tracing) than in the control (FIG. 16).

    <heading>SUMMARY OF FINDINGS</heading>
    <p num="160">
      It is evident from the attached results that partially methylated xanthines enhance crystallinity in apatite grown in vitro.
      <br/>
      Our results indicate that theobromine enhances crystallinity in vivo, as well.
      <br/>
      The results of X-ray diffraction studies of bone and teeth indicate larger crystallite size, as noted by sharpening of the (300) reflections.
      <br/>
      Microprobe results do not indicate a more intense mineralization of either bone or tooth material.
      <br/>
      Scanning electron microscopy in vitro shows coarser apatite crystallites in the theobromine and 3-methyl xanthine group than in the control group.
      <br/>
      Evidently, no additional apatite material is deposited in either bones or teeth but the crystallite size is increased in the partially methylated xanthines, making such material less easily dissolved.
      <br/>
      Application of these compounds may have profound effects on the health of human bone and teeth.
