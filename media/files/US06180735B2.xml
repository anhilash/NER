      The present invention relates to a catalyst composition and a method for making the catalyst composition of a polymerization catalyst and a carbonyl compound.
      <br/>
      The invention is also directed to the use of the catalyst composition in the polymerization of olefin(s).
      <br/>
      In particular, the polymerization catalyst system is supported on a carrier.
      <br/>
      More particularly, the polymerization catalyst comprises a bulky ligand metallocene-type catalyst system.

      Advances in polymerization and catalysis have resulted in the capability to produce many new polymers having improved physical and chemical properties useful in a wide variety of superior products and applications.
      <br/>
      With the development of new catalysts the choice of polymerization-type (solution, slurry, high pressure or gas phase) for producing a particular polymer has been greatly expanded.
      <br/>
      Also, advances in polymerization technology have provided more efficient, highly productive and economically enhanced processes.
      <br/>
      Especially illustrative of these advances is the development of technology utilizing bulky ligand metallocene-type catalyst systems.
      <br/>
      Regardless of these technological advances in the polyolefin industry, common problems, as well as new challenges associated with process operability still exist.
      <br/>
      For example, the tendency for a gas phase or slurry phase process to foul and/or sheet remains a challenge.
    </p>
    <p num="3">
      For example, in a continuous slurry process fouling on the walls of the reactor, which act as a heat transfer surface, can result in many operability problems.
      <br/>
      Poor heat transfer during polymerization can result in polymer particles adhering to the walls of the reactor.
      <br/>
      These polymer particles can continue to polymerize on the walls and can result in a premature reactor shutdown.
      <br/>
      Also, depending on the reactor conditions, some of the polymer may dissolve in the reactor diluent and redeposit on for example the metal heat exchanger surfaces.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      In a typical continuous gas phase process, a recycle system is employed for many reasons including the removal of heat generated in the process by the polymerization.
      <br/>
      Fouling, sheeting and/or static generation in a continuous gas phase process can lead to the ineffective operation of various reactor systems.
      <br/>
      For example, the cooling mechanism of the recycle system, the temperature probes utilized for process control and the distributor plate, if affected, can lead to an early reactor shutdown.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      Evidence of, and solutions to, various process operability problems have been addressed by many in the art.

    <p num="6">There are various other known methods for improving operability including coating the polymerization equipment, for example, treating the walls of a reactor using chromium compounds as described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,532,311 and 4,876,320; injecting various agents into the process, for example PCT Publication WO 97/46599 published Dec. 11, 1997 discusses feeding into a lean zone in a polymerization reactor an unsupported, soluble metallocene-type catalyst system and injecting antifoulants or antistatic agents into the reactor; controlling the polymerization rate, particularly on start-up; and reconfiguring the reactor design.</p>
    <p num="7">
      Others in the art to improve process operability have discussed modifying the catalyst system by preparing the catalyst system in different ways.
      <br/>
      For example, methods in the art include combining the catalyst system components in a particular order; manipulating the ratio of the various catalyst system components; varying the contact time and/or temperature when combining the components of a catalyst system; or simply adding various compounds to the catalyst system.
      <br/>
      These techniques or combinations thereof are discussed in the literature.
      <br/>
      Especially illustrative in the art is the preparation procedures and methods for producing bulky ligand metallocene-type catalyst systems, more particularly supported bulky ligand metallocene-type catalyst systems with reduced tendencies for fouling and better operability.
      <br/>
      Examples of these include: WO 96/11961 published Apr. 26, 1996 discusses as a component of a supported catalyst system an antistatic agent for reducing fouling and sheeting in a gas, slurry or liquid pool polymerization process; U.S. Pat.

    <p num="8">While all these possible solutions might reduce the level of fouling or sheeting somewhat, some are expensive to employ and/or may not reduce fouling and sheeting to a level sufficient to successfully operate a continuous process, particularly a commercial or large-scale process.</p>

      Thus, it would be advantageous to have a polymerization process capable of operating continuously with enhanced reactor operability and at the same time produce new and improved polymers.

    <p num="18">Introduction</p>
    <p num="19">
      The invention is directed toward a method for making a catalyst composition and to the catalyst composition itself.

    <p num="172">
      A 1-liter autoclave, equipped with a helical stirrer to permit efficient mixing of solids, was charged under nitrogen with 100 g dry, granular high-density polyethylene and purged with nitrogen by pressurizing and venting three times to 100 psig (689 kPag).
      <br/>
      To the reactor was then added 100 mmol triisobutyl-aluminum by syringe.
      <br/>
      The reactor was purged with ethylene by pressurizing and venting three times to 100 psig (689 kPag) and then heated to 80 (degree)  C. before bringing to a final ethylene pressure of 107 psig (738 kPag).

      An injection apparatus comprising a 2" ( 5.1 cm) by 1/4" (0.64 cm) piece of stainless steel tubing sealed on each end with ball valves and attached to a source of dry, pressurized nitrogen on one end was charged with 61 mg of the supported metallocene catalyst mixed with 6 mg dry benzil.
      <br/>
      The apparatus was attached to the reactor and the catalyst injected by opening both ball valves, allowing the nitrogen to sweep the dry catalyst into the reactor.
      <br/>
      After 30 minutes the reaction temperature was ramped to 100 (degree)  C. and held for another 30 minutes.
      <br/>
      The reactor was then vented and cooled and the resin recovered.
      <br/>
      A total of 26.2 g of new resin was made.
      <br/>
      After sieving through a 10 mesh screen, 3.1 g of resin was left on the screen ("rubble").

    <p num="175">The procedure was exactly the same as in Example 1 except that no benzil was mixed with the catalyst but instead 12 mg benzil was charged to the granular high-density polyethylene bed immediately before adding the triisobutyl-aluminum.</p>

      While the present invention has been described and illustrated by reference to particular embodiments, those of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that the invention lends itself to variations not necessarily illustrated herein.
      <br/>
      For example, it is contemplated that a carbonyl compound can be added to reactor in addition to being contacted with the catalyst system of the invention.
      <br/>
      It is also contemplated that the process of the invention may be used in a series reactor polymerization process.
      <br/>
      For example, a supported bulky ligand metallocene-type catalyst system free of a carbonyl compound is used in one reactor and a supported, bridged, bulky ligand metallocene-type catalyst system having been contacted with a carbonyl compound being used in another or vice-versa.
      <br/>
      It is also contemplated that a carbonyl compound may be separately supported on a carrier different from the polymerization catalyst, preferably a supported polymerization catalyst.
      <br/>
      For this reason, then, reference should be made solely to the appended claims for purposes of determining the true scope of the present invention.
