      The present invention relates to mild, rinse-off, personal cleansing compositions which provide enhanced antimicrobial effectiveness.
      <br/>
      Specifically, the personal cleansing compositions of the invention provide improved immediate germ reduction on the skin compared to prior art compositions.
      <br/>
      These rinse-off cleansing compositions are also mild to the skin.
    </p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">
      Human health is impacted by many microbial entities.
      <br/>
      Inoculation by viruses and bacteria cause a wide variety of sicknesses and ailments.
      <br/>
      Media attention to cases of food poisoning, strep infections, and the like is increasing public awareness of microbial issues.
    </p>
    <p num="3">
      It is well known that the washing of hard surfaces, food (e.g. fruit or vegetables) and skin, especially the hands, with antimicrobial or non-medicated soap, can remove many viruses and bacteria from the washed surfaces.
      <br/>
      Removal of the viruses and bacteria is due to the surfactancy of the soap and the mechanical action of the wash procedure.
      <br/>
      Therefore, it is known and recommended that the people wash frequently to reduce the spread of viruses and bacteria.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      Bacteria found on the skin can be divided into two groups: resident and transient bacteria.
      <br/>
      Resident bacteria are Gram positive bacteria which are established as permanent microcolonies on the surface and outermost layers of the skin and play an important, helpful role in preventing the colonization of other, more harmful bacteria and fungi.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      Transient bacteria are bacteria which are not part of the normal resident flora of the skin, but can be deposited when airborne contaminated material lands on the skin or when contaminated material is brought into physical contact with it.
      <br/>
      Transient bacteria are typically divided into two subclasses: Gram positive and Gram negative.
      <br/>
      Gram positive bacteria include pathogens such as Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes and Clostridium botulinum.
      <br/>
      Gram negative bacteria include pathogens such as Salmonella, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella, Haemophillus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus and Shigella dysenteriae.
      <br/>
      Gram negative bacteria are generally distinguished from Gram positive by an additional protective cell membrane which generally results in the Gram negative bacteria being less susceptible to topical antibacterial actives.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      Antimicrobial cleansing products have been marketed in a variety of forms for some time.
      <br/>
      Forms include deodorant soaps, hard surface cleaners, and surgical disinfectants.
      <br/>
      These traditional rinse-off antimicrobial products have been formulated to provide bacteria reduction during washing.
      <br/>
      For example, Dial.RTM. liquid soaps, when used in hand washing, have been found to reduce the amount of the bacteria on the skin by from about 2.0 log (97%) to about 2.5 log (99.7%) in one 30 second handwash, as measured by standard Health Care Personal Handwash Tests (HCPHWT).
      <br/>
      That is skin washed with these soaps were contaminated with only 0.3%-3% of the number of bacteria compared to before washing.
      <br/>
      Antimicrobial liquid cleansers are disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,847,072, Bissett et al., issued Jul. 11, 1989, U.S. Pat. No. 4,939,284, Degenhardt, issued Jul. 3, 1990 and U.S. Pat. No. 4,820,698, Degenhardt, issued Apr. 11, 1989, all of which are incorporated herein by reference.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      Some of these antimicrobial products, especially the hard surface cleaners and surgical disinfectants, utilize high levels of alcohol and/or harsh surfactants which have been shown to dry out and irritate skin tissues.
      <br/>
      Dial.RTM. bar soap has been found to provide from 2.5 to 3.0 log reduction in bacteria in one wash, as measured by the HCPHWT.
      <br/>
      However, Dial.RTM. can be drying to the skin with repeated use.
      <br/>
      Ideal personal cleansers should gently cleanse the skin, cause little or no irritation, and not leave the skin overly dry after frequent use and preferably should provide a moisturizing benefit to the skin.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      Previously marketed formulations of Head &amp; Shoulders.RTM. Dandruff Shampoo, marketed until 1994, comprised anionic surfactants, an antibacterial active and citric acid as a pH adjuster.
      <br/>
      Head &amp; Shoulders.RTM. controlled Pityrosorum ovale fungus, which causes dandruff.
      <br/>
      PCT application WO 92/18100, Keegan et al., published Oct. 29, 1992 ("Kegean") and PCT application WO 95/32705, Fujiwara et al., published Dec. 7, 1995 ("Fujiwara") teach liquid skin cleansers comprising mild surfactants, antibacterial agents and acidic compounds to buffer the pH, which provide improved germ hostility.
      <br/>
      However, the use of the acid compounds for only pH adjustment therein, result in compositions which do not deliver the undissociated acid required to enhance the antimicrobial actives in order to provide improved levels of immediate germ removal upon use.
      <br/>
      This situation is compounded in Keegan and Fujiwara by the preference of mild surfactants, including nonionic surfactants.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      Hibiclens.RTM. Surgical Scrub provides 2.5 to 3.0 log reduction in germs in one wash and U.S. Pat. No. 3,141,821, issued to Compeau Jul. 21, 1964; Irgasan DP 300 (Triclosan.RTM.) technical literature from Ciba-Giegy, Inc., "Basic Formulation for Hand Disinfection 89/42/01"; Bartzokas, C. A., et al, "Evaluation of the Skin Disinfecting Activity and Cumulative Effect of Chlorhexidine and Triclosan Handwash Preparations on Hands Artificially Contaminated with Serratia marcescens", Infection Control, 1987/Vol. 8, No. 4; all set forth antibacterial skin cleansers compositions which could provide improved immediate germ reduction using certain anionic surfactants, antimicrobial actives and acids.
      <br/>
      However, the selection, therein, of highly active surfactants or cationic actives with safety issues (i.e. chlorohexidine gluconate) results in personal cleansing compositions which are potentially drying and harsh to the skin, or potentially unsafe.

      Even with the reduction in bacteria seen with the referenced products, hundreds to thousands of bacteria can be left behind at a wash site.
      <br/>
      Given the health impacts of bacteria like Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Salmonella and Escherichia coli, it would be highly desirable to formulate antimicrobial cleansing compositions which provide improved immediate germ reduction and which are mild to the skin.
      <br/>
      Existing consumer products have been unable to achieve both of these benefits.
    </p>
    <p num="12">
      Applicants have found that rinse-off antimicrobial cleansing compositions which provide such mildness and such improved immediate germ reduction can be formulated by using known antimicrobial actives in combination with specific organic and/or inorganic acids as proton donating agents, and specific anionic surfactants, all of which are deposited on the skin.
      <br/>
      The deposited proton donating agent and anionic surfactant enhance the selected active, to provide a new level of hostility to bacteria contacting the skin.

    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="13">The present invention relates to a rinse-off antimicrobial cleansing composition effective against Gram positive bacteria, Gram negative bacteria, fungi, yeasts, molds and viruses comprising from about 0.001% to about 5% of an antimicrobial active; from about 1% to about 80% of an anionic surfactant; from about 0.1% to about 12% of a proton donating agent; and from about 3% to about 98.899% of water; wherein the composition is adjusted to a pH of from about 3.0 to about 6.0; wherein the rinse-off antimicrobial cleansing composition has a One-wash Immediate Germ Reduction Index of greater than about 2.5 and a Mildness Index of greater than 0.3. The invention also relates to rinse-off antimicrobial cleansing compositions which have a Ten-wash Immediate Germ Reduction Index of greater than about 2.8 and a Mildness Index of greater than 0.3.</p>
    <p num="14">The present invention also relates to methods for cleansing skin while achieving improved immediate germ reduction during cleansing. using the rinse-off antimicrobial cleansing compositions described herein.</p>
    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="15">The rinse-off antimicrobial cleansing compositions of the present invention are highly efficacious for cleansing surfaces, especially the skin, provide improved immediate germ reduction during cleansing and are mild to the skin.</p>
    <p num="16">The term "rinse-off" is used herein to mean that the compositions of the present invention are used in a context whereby the composition is ultimately rinsed or washed from the treated surface, (e.g. skin or hard surfaces) either after or during the application of the product.</p>
    <p num="17">
      The term "antimicrobial cleansing composition" as used herein means a composition suitable for application to a surface for the purpose of removing dirt, oil and the like which additionally reduces the number of germs on the surface.
      <br/>
      The compositions, herein, are effective against Gram positive bacteria, Gram negative bacteria, fungi, yeasts, molds, and viruses.
      <br/>
      Preferred embodiments of the present invention are cleansing compositions suitable for use on the human skin.
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      The compositions of the present invention can also be useful for treatment of acne.
      <br/>
      As used herein "treating acne" means preventing, retarding and/or arresting the process of acne formation in mammalian skin.
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      The compositions of the invention can also be useful for providing an essentially immediate (i.e., acute) visual improvement in skin appearance following application of the composition to the skin.
      <br/>
      More particularly, the compositions of the present invention are useful for regulating skin condition, including regulating visible and/or tactile discontinuities in skin, including but not limited to visible and/or tactile discontinuities in skin texture and/or color, more especially discontinuities associated with skin aging.
      <br/>
      Such discontinuities may be induced or caused by internal and/or external factors.
      <br/>
      Extrinsic factors include ultraviolet radiation (e.g., from sun exposure), environmental pollution, wind, heat, low humidity, harsh surfactants, abrasives, and the like.
      <br/>
      Intrinsic factors include chronological aging and other biochemical changes from within the skin.
    </p>
    <p num="20">
      Regulating skin condition includes prophylactically and/or therapeutically regulating skin condition.
      <br/>
      As used herein, prophylactically regulating skin condition includes delaying, minimizing and/or preventing visible and/or tactile discontinuities in skin.
      <br/>
      As used herein, therapeutically regulating skin condition includes ameliorating, e.g., diminishing, minimizing and/or effacing, such discontinuities.
      <br/>
      Regulating skin condition involves improving skin appearance and/or feel, e.g., providing a smoother, more even appearance and/or feel.
      <br/>
      As used herein, regulating skin condition includes regulating signs of aging. "Regulating signs of skin aging" includes prophylactically regulating and/or therapeutically regulating one or more of such signs (similarly, regulating a given sign of skin aging, e.g., lines, wrinkles or pores, includes prophylactically regulating and/or therapeutically regulating that sign).
    </p>
    <p num="21">
      "Signs of skin aging" include, but are not limited to, all outward visibly and tactilely perceptible manifestations as well as any other macro or micro effects due to skin aging.
      <br/>
      Such signs may be induced or caused by intrinsic factors or extrinsic factors, e.g., chronological aging and/or environmental damage.
      <br/>
      These signs may result from processes which include, but are not limited to, the development of textural discontinuities such as wrinkles, including both fine superficial wrinkles and coarse deep wrinkles, skin lines, crevices, bumps, large pores (e.g., associated with adnexal structures such as sweat gland ducts, sebaceous glands, or hair follicles), scaliness, flakiness and/or other forms of skin unevenness or roughness, loss of skin elasticity (loss and/or inactivation of functional skin elastin), sagging (including puffiness in the eye area and jowls), loss of skin firmness, loss of skin tightness, loss of skin recoil from deformation, discoloration (including undereye circles), blotching, sallowness, hyperpigmented skin regions such as age spots and freckles, keratoses, abnormal differentiation, hyperkeratinization, elastosis, collagen breakdown, and other histological changes in the stratum corneum, dermis, epidermis, the skin vascular system (e.g., telangiectasia or spider vessels), and underlying tissues, especially those proximate to the skin.
    </p>
    <p num="22">
      All percentages and ratios used herein, unless otherwise indicated, are by weight and all measurements made are at 25 (degree)  C., unless otherwise designated.
      <br/>
      The invention hereof can comprise, consist of, or consist essentially of, the essential as well as optional ingredients and components described therein.
    </p>
    <p num="23">I. INGREDIENTS</p>
    <p num="24">
      The rinse-off antimicrobial cleansing compositions of the present invention comprise an antimicrobial active, an anionic surfactant, and a proton donating agent.
      <br/>
      These components are selected so that the efficacy and mildness requirements hereinafter defined for the compositions herein are met.
      <br/>
      The selection of each component is necessarily dependent on the selection of each of the other components.
      <br/>
      For example, if a weak acid is selected as the proton donating agent, then in order to realize an efficacious composition, either a more biologically active (but possibly less mild) surfactant must be employed, and/or a high level of acid within the prescribed range must be used and/or a particularly efficacious active must be employed and/or a higher level of deposition within the prescribed range must be employed.
      <br/>
      Similarly, if a mild, but nonefficacious surfactant is employed, then a stronger acid and/or a high level of acid and/or a high level of deposition aid may be necessary to realize an efficacious composition.
      <br/>
      If a harsh surfactant is utilized, then a mildness agent may have to be utilized or a lipophilic skin moisturizer ingredient may have to be employed as the deposition aid.
      <br/>
      Guidelines for the selection of the individual components are provided herein.
    </p>
    <p num="25">A. ANTIMICROBIAL ACTIVE</p>
    <p num="26">
      The rinse-off antimicrobial cleansing composition of the present invention comprises from about 0.001% to about 5%, preferably from about 0.01% to about 2%, more preferably from about 0.05% to about 1.5% and more preferably from about 0.1% to about 1.0%, by weight of the antimicrobial cleansing composition, of an antimicrobial active.
      <br/>
      The exact amount of antibacterial active to be used in the compositions will depend on the particular active utilized since actives vary in potency.
      <br/>
      Non-cationic actives are required in order to avoid interaction with the anionic surfactants of the invention and to maintain mildness.

      In general, the higher the biological activity of the surfactant, the more residual effectiveness is provided by the composition comprising the surfactant.
      <br/>
      Typically, however, the biological activity of a surfactant and the mildness of a surfactant are inversely proportional; the higher the biological activity of the surfactant, the harsher the surfactant and the lower the biological activity of the surfactant, the milder the surfactant.
      <br/>
      Whether a biologically active, but harsh surfactant or a mild, but biologically inactive surfactant is desired will, of course, depend on (or influence) the selection of the other components.
    </p>
    <p num="58">
      The biological activity/mildness of a pure surfactant can measured directly via a Microtox Response Test hereinafter described in the Analytical Methods section and can be reported as a Microtox Response Index.
      <br/>
      By "pure surfactant" it is meant a chemical composition consisting essentially of a single surfactant entity, wherein the entity has essentially one chain length, head group and salt counter ion.
      <br/>
      From a standpoint of high biological activity, preferred anionic surfactants of the antimicrobial cleansing compositions of the present invention have a Microtox Response Index of less that about 150, more preferably less than about 100 and most preferably less than about 50.
      <br/>
      From a standpoint of mildness, preferred anionic surfactants of the antimicrobial cleansing compositions of the present invention have a Microtox Response Index of greater than about 25, more preferably greater than about 50 and most preferably greater than about 100.
      <br/>
      Surfactants with a Microtox Response Index ranging from about 25 to about 150 are typically moderately biologically active and moderately mild.
    </p>
    <p num="59">
      For surfactant compositions which are mixtures of surfactants rather than pure surfactants (this includes "commercial grade" surfactants which typically comprise mixtures of entities with different chain lengths and potentially have higher levels of impurities), the Microtox Response Index for any individual surfactant component is not a reliable measurement of biological activity or mildness.
      <br/>
      In the case of mixtures, the Microtox Index of each individual component can be determined and the weighted average used as the Index for the mixture if all the individual components of the mixture are known.
      <br/>
      If the individual components of a mixture are not known, then the primary head group and chain lengths of the surfactant mixture are better indicators of biological activity/mildness.
    </p>
    <p num="60">
      Anionic surfactants or mixtures of surfactants with a chain length primarily in the range of from about 8 to about 24 carbon atoms, preferably primarily from about 10 to about 18 carbon atoms and most preferably primarily from about 12 to about 16 carbon atoms are preferred from the standpoint of high biological activity.
      <br/>
      As used herein "primarily" means at least about 50%.
      <br/>
      From a standpoint of mildness, it is preferable to minimize C12.
    </p>
    <p num="61">
      From the standpoint of biological activity, it is preferred that the head group of the anionic surfactant be less than about 15 Angstroms, preferably less than about 10 Angstoms, and more preferably less than about 7 Angstoms.
      <br/>
      The "head group" is defined as the hydrophilic portion (non-hydrocarbon) of the anionic surfactant, measured from the first polar atom to the end of the molecule.
      <br/>
      The head group size is estimated from the Van der Waals radius of the atoms and the configuration of the surfactant molecule.
      <br/>
      Head groups with sizes less than about 7 Angstroms include sulfates, sulfonates, and phosphates.
      <br/>
      From the standpoint of mildness, it is preferred that the head group size is greater than about 7 Angstoms, and preferably greater than about 10 Angstoms.
      <br/>
      Head groups with sizes greater than about 10 Angstroms include ethoxylated sulfates, glyceryl ether sulfonates, and isethionates.
      <br/>
      It is believed that as the head group size increases, more stearic hindrance at the cell wall prevents disruption by the surfactant and, thus, biological activity is decreased and mildness is increased.
    </p>
    <p num="62">
      The mildness of a surfactant or mixture of surfactants can also be determined by a number of other known, conventional methods for measuring surfactant mildness.
      <br/>
      For example, the Barrier Destruction Test set forth in T. J. Franz, J. Invest. Dermatol., 1975, 64, pp. 190-195 and in U.S. Pat. No. 4,673,525 to Small et al; issued Jun. 16, 1987, both of which are herein incorporated by reference, is a way of measuring mildness of surfactants.
      <br/>
      In general, the milder the surfactant, the less skin barrier that is destroyed in the barrier destruction test.
      <br/>
      Skin barrier destruction is measured by relative amount of radiolabeled water which passes from the test solution through the skin epidermis into the physiological buffer contained in the diffusate chamber.
      <br/>
      Surfactants having a Relative Skin Barrier Penetration Value of as close to zero as possible up to about 75 are considered mild for purposes herein.
      <br/>
      Surfactants having a Relative Skin Barrier Penetration Value of greater than about 75 are considered harsh for purposes herein.
    </p>
    <p num="63">Solubility slope of Antimicrobial Active in Anionic Surfactant</p>
    <p num="64">
      Preferred anionic surfactants are also selected, in part, based on the ability of the surfactant to deposit the antimicrobial active onto the skin.
      <br/>
      Surfactants for use herein must have sufficient solubility to carry the active and yet the solubility cannot be so high that the active is held in solution during use, resulting in no active being deposited to the skin.
      <br/>
      It has been found that this balance is best measured by the slope of the curve of the solubility of the antimicrobial active versus the concentration of the surfactant in water.
      <br/>
      This slope, hereafter referred to as the solubility slope, K, is determined by the test method hereinafter described in the Analytical Methods Section.
    </p>
    <p num="65">Preferred anionic surfactants of the present invention comprise a solubility slope, K, of less than 0.60, preferably less than 0.40, more preferably less than about 0.25 and most preferably less than about 0.10.</p>
    <p num="66">The rinse-off antimicrobial cleansing compositions of the present invention preferably deposit from about 0.01  MU g/cm2 to about 100  MU g/cm2, more preferably from about 0.1  MU g/cm2 to about 50  MU g/cm2 and most preferably from about 1  MU g/cm2 to about 20  MU g/cm2 of antimicrobial active onto the skin.</p>
    <p num="67">In order for the personal cleansing compositions herein to be effective, both the biological activity of the surfactant and the solubility of the particular active employed in the surfactant must be taken into account.</p>
    <p num="68">
      For example, ammonium lauryl sulfate, ALS, is very biologically active (Microtox Index=1.0) but has a relatively high solubility slope (K=0.3).
      <br/>
      Compositions comprising ALS are capable of providing very effective residual antibacterial effectiveness due to its activity, even with lower levels of antibacterial active and proton donating agent.
      <br/>
      However, in order to deposit the active on the skin (which is required to meet the efficacy requirements described herein), higher levels of active will be required as a result of the high solubility slope.
      <br/>
      Moreover, compositions containing ALS may require the addition of cosurfactants or polymers, described herein in the Optional Ingredient Section, to achieve most preferred mildness levels for the present invention.
    </p>
    <p num="69">A selection of ammonium laureth-3 sulfate (Microtox=120 and K=0.5) as a surfactant will result in compositions which are very mild, but which would require higher levels of proton donating agent and antimicrobial active in order to achieve the residual effectiveness of the present invention.</p>
    <p num="70">
      Paraffin sulfonate, a commercial grade surfactant sold under the name Hastapur SAS.RTM. from Hoechst Celanese, with a small head group and average chain length of 15.5 (K=0.1) is a relatively active surfactant and provides very high deposition of the active.
      <br/>
      Compositions comprising lower levels of active and acid can be used with higher levels of paraffin sulfonate, where the surfactant provides a larger component of residual effectiveness.
      <br/>
      Alternately, compositions comprising lower levels of paraffin sulfonate can be combined with higher levels of active to achieve a mild and effective composition.
      <br/>
      Moderate levels of active can be used with paraffin sulfonate, since its solubility index indicates that such compositions will have very high deposition of the active.
    </p>
    <p num="71">
      Nonlimiting examples of preferred anionic surfactants useful herein include those selected from the group consisting of sodium and ammonium alkyl sulfates and ether sulfates having chain lengths of predominantly 12 and 14 carbon atoms, olefin sulfates having chain lengths of predominantly 14 and 16 carbon atoms, and paraffin sulfonates having chain lengths of from 13 to 17 carbon atoms, and mixtures thereof.
      <br/>
      Especially preferred for use herein is ammonium and sodium lauryl sulfate; ammonium and sodium myristyl sulfate; ammonium and sodium laureth-1, laureth-2, laureth-3, and laureth-4 sulfate; ammonium and sodium, C14-C16 olefin sulfonates; C13-C17 paraffin sulfonates, and mixtures thereof.
    </p>
    <p num="72">
      Non-anionic surfactants of the group consisting of nonionic surfactants, cationic surfactants, amphoteric surfactants and mixtures thereof, have been found to actually reduce residual effectiveness benefits when used with anionic surfactants at high levels.
      <br/>
      This is most evident in the case of cationic and amphoteric surfactants where it is believed that these surfactants interfere (charge-charge interaction) with the anionic surfactants ability to disrupt of the lipid in the cell membrane.
      <br/>
      The ratio of the amount of these other surfactants to the amount of anionic surfactant should be less than about 1:1, preferably less than about 1:2, and more preferably less than about 1:4.
    </p>
    <p num="73">The rinse-off antimicrobial cleansing compositions of the present invention preferably do not comprise hydrotropic sulfonates, particularly salts of terpenoids, or mono- or binuclear aromatic compounds such as sulfonates of camphor, toluene, xylene, cumene and naphthene.</p>
    <p num="74">C. PROTON DONATING AGENT</p>
    <p num="75">
      The rinse-off antimicrobial cleansing compositions of the present invention comprise from about 0.1% to about 12%, preferably from about 0.5% to about 10%, more preferably from about 1% to about 7.5%, and most preferably from about 2.5% to about 5%, based on the weight of the personal cleansing composition, of a proton donating agent.
      <br/>
      By "proton donating agent" it is meant any acid compound or mixture thereof, which results in the presence of undissociated acid on the skin after use.
      <br/>
      Proton donating agents can be organic acids, including polymeric acids, mineral acids or mixtures thereof.
    </p>
    <p num="76">Organic Acids</p>
    <p num="77">
      Proton donating agents which are organic acids remain at least partially undissociated in the neat composition and remain so when the compositions are diluted during washing and rinsing.
      <br/>
      The organic acid proton donating agent must have at least one pKa value below 5.5. These organic proton donating agents can be added directly to the composition in the acid form or can be formed by adding the conjugate base of the desired acid and a sufficient amount of a separate acid strong enough to form the undissociated acid from the base.
    </p>
    <p num="78">Biological Activity Index of Organic Acids</p>
    <p num="79">
      Preferred organic proton donating agents are selected based on their biological activity.
      <br/>
      This activity is represented by a Biological Activity Index, Z, which is defined as:
      <br/>
      Z=1+0.25 pKa1 +0.42 log P.
    </p>
    <p num="80">
      The biological activity index combines the dissociation characteristics and the hydrophobicity of the acid.
      <br/>
      It is critical that the undissociated proton donating agent of the composition be deposited on the skin to reduce the negative charge on the cell wall.
      <br/>
      The acid's dissociation constant, pKa1, is indicative of the chemical's proton donating capacity relative to the pH of the medium in which it is incorporated.
      <br/>
      Since more undissociated acid is preferable in the composition, acids with higher pKa's are generally more preferred for a given product pH.
      <br/>
      The octanol-water partition coefficient, P, represents the tendency of materials in solution to prefer either oils or water.
      <br/>
      It essentially is a measure of hydrophobic nature of a material in solution: the higher the partition coefficient, the more oil soluble, and less water soluble, the material.
      <br/>
      Since it is desired that the dissolved acids in the compositions come out of the aqueous cleanser upon application, deposit on the oil-based skin and remain during rinsing, organic acids with higher octanol-water partition coefficients are more preferred.
    </p>
    <p num="81">Preferred organic proton donating agents of the rinse-off antimicrobial cleansing compositions of the present invention have a biological activity index greater than about 0.5, preferably greater than about 1.0, more preferably greater than about 1.5 and most preferably greater than 2 0 (slashed zero)</p>
    <p num="82">Mineral Acids</p>
    <p num="83">
      Proton donating agents which are mineral acids will not remain undissociated in the neat composition or when the compositions are diluted during washing and rinsing.
      <br/>
      Despite this, it has been found that mineral acids can be effective proton donating agents for use herein.
      <br/>
      Without being limited by theory, it is believed that the strong mineral acids, protonate the carboxylic and phosphatidyl groups in proteins of the skin cells, thereby providing in-situ undissociated acid.
      <br/>
      These proton donating agents can only be added directly to the composition in the acid form.
    </p>
    <p num="84">pH</p>
    <p num="85">
      It is critical to achieving the benefits of the invention that the undissociated acid from the proton donating agent (deposited or formed in-situ) remain on the skin in the protonated form.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the pH of the rinse-off antimicrobial cleansing compositions of the present invention must be adjusted to a sufficiently low level in order to either form or deposit substantial undissociated acid on the skin.
      <br/>
      The pH of the compositions should be adjusted and preferably buffered to have a range of from about 3.0 to about 6.0, preferably from about 3.0 to about 5.0 and more preferably from about 3.5 to about 4.5.

    <p num="91">Mildness Enhancers</p>
    <p num="92">
      In order to achieve the mildness required of the present invention, optional ingredients to enhance the mildness to the skin can be added.
      <br/>
      These ingredients include cationic and nonionic polymers, co-surfactants, moisturizers and mixtures thereof.
      <br/>
      Polymers useful herein include polyethylene glycols, polypropylene glycols, hydrolyzed silk proteins, hydrolyzed milk proteins, hydrolyzed keratin proteins, guar hydroxypropyltrimonium chloride, polyquats, silicone polymers and mixtures thereof.

      When used, the mildness enhancing polymers comprise from about 0.1% to about 1%, preferably from about 0.2% to about 1.0%, and more preferably from about 0.2% to about 0.6%, by weight of the rinse-off antimicrobial cleasning composition, of the composition.
      <br/>
      Co-surfactants useful herein include nonionic surfactants such as the Genapol.RTM. 24 series of ethoxylated alcohols, POE(20) sorbitan monooleate (Tween.RTM. 80), polyethylene glycol cocoate and Pluronic.RTM. propylene oxide/ethylene oxide block polymers, and amphoteric surfactants Such as alkyl betaines, alkyl sultaines, alkyl amphoacetates, alkyl amphodiacetates, alkyl amphopropionates, and alkyl amphodipropionates.

    <p num="94">
      A deposition aid is also preferably employed in the personal cleansing compositions herein.
      <br/>
      It has been found that compositions which contain a deposition aid of the type hereinafter described have improved antibacterial efficacy compared to compositions which do not contain one.
      <br/>
      Additionally, the especially preferred lipid skin moisturizing agent provides a moisturizing benefit to the user of the personal cleansing product when the lipophilic skin moisturizing agent is deposited to the user's skin.
    </p>
    <p num="95">
      When used in the liquid, rinse-off antimicrobial personal cleansing compositions herein, the deposition aid comprises from about 0.1% to about 30%, preferably from about 1% to about 30% more preferably from about 3% to about 25%, most preferably from about 5% to about 25% of the cleansing composition.
      <br/>
      The deposition aid employed herein is one that increases the deposition of the antimicrobial active or the proton donating agent on the skin by at least about 20%, preferably by at least about 30%, more preferably at least about 50%.
    </p>
    <p num="96">
      Suitable deposition aids for use herein include, for example, lipophilic skin moisturizing agents, cationic polymers, nonionic polymers, zeolites, clays and mixtures thereof.
      <br/>
      One of the reasons why cationic polymers are believed to be effective deposition aids is that they can form coascervates with the anionic surfactant.

      Suitable cationic and nonionic polymers for use as a deposition aid herein include polyethylene glycols, polypropylene glycols, hydrolyzed silk proteins, hydrolyzed milk proteins, hydrolized keratin proteins, guar hydroxypropyltrimonium chloride, polyquats, silicone polymers and mixtures thereof.

      When lipophilic skin moisturizing agents are used as the deposition aid herein, they are employed at a level of about 1% to about 30%, preferably from about 3% to about 25%, most preferably from about 5% to about 25% by weight of the composition.
    </p>
    <p num="98">
      Two types of rheological parameters are used to define the lipophilic skin moisturizing agent used herein.
      <br/>
      The viscosity of the lipophilic skin moisturizing agent is represented by consistency (k) and shear index (n).
      <br/>
      The lipophilic skin moisturizing agents for use herein typically have a consistency (k) ranging from about 5 to about 5,000 poise, preferably from about 10 to about 3,000 poise, more preferably from about 50 to about 2,000 poise, as measured by the Consistency (k) Method hereinafter set forth in the Analytical Methods section.

      Suitable lipophilic skin moisturizing agents for use herein further have a shear index (n) ranging from about 0.01 to about 0.9, preferably from about 0.1 to about 0.5, more preferably from about 0.2 to about 0.5, as measured by the Shear Index Method hereinafter set forth in the Analytical methods section.
    </p>
    <p num="99">
      While not being bound by any theory, it is believed that lipophilic skin moisturizing agents having rheology properties other than those defined herein are either too easily emulsified and hence will not deposit, or are too "stiff" to adhere or deposit on to skin and provide a moisturization benefit.
      <br/>
      In addition, the rheological properties of the lipophilic skin moisturizing agent are also important to user perception.
      <br/>
      Some lipophilic skin moisturizing agents, on deposition to the skin, are considered too sticky and are not preferred by the user.

    <p num="100">
      In some cases, the lipophilic skin moisturizing agent can also desirably be defined in terms of its solubility parameter, as defined by Vaughan in Cosmetics and Toiletries, Vol. 103, p. 47-69, October 1988.

    <p num="110">
      The stabilizer is used to form a crystalline stabilizing network in the liquid cleansing composition that prevents the lipophilic skin moisturizer agent droplets from coalescing and phase splitting in the product.
      <br/>
      The network exhibits time dependent recovery of viscosity after shearing (e.g., thixotropy).
    </p>
    <p num="111">
      The stabilizers used herein are not surfactants.
      <br/>
      The stabilizers provide improved shelf and stress stability, but allow the liquid personal cleansing composition to separate upon lathering, and thereby provide for increased deposition of the lipophilic skin moisturizing agent onto the skin.
      <br/>
      This is particularly true when the cleansing emulsions of the present invention are used in conjunction with a polymeric diamond meshed sponge implement such as that described in Campagnoli; U.S. Pat. No. 5,144,744; Issued Sep. 8, 1992, herein incorporated by reference.

    <p num="119">
      Fumed silica, which is also known as arced silica, is produced by the vapor phase hydrolysis of silicon tetrachloride in a hydrogen oxygen flame.
      <br/>
      It is believed that the combustion process creates silicone dioxide molecules which condense to form particles.
      <br/>
      The particles collide, attach and sinter together.
      <br/>
      The result of this process is a three dimensional branched chain aggregate.
      <br/>
      Once the aggregate cools below the fusion point of silica, which is about 1710 (degree)  C., further collisions result in mechanical entanglement of the chains to form agglomerates. precipitated silicas and silica gels are generally made in aqueous solution.

      Procedure:
      <br/>
      1.
      <br/>
      Preparation of Sample Stock Solution (Standard Concentration: 1000 ppm)
      <br/>
      The stock solution of the test anionic surfactant sample is prepared and used as a stock solution from which all other dilutions are made.
      <br/>
      The standard "starting concentration", the highest concentration to be tested, is 500 ppm. (If a 500 ppm starting concentration fails to give a calculable result, e.g. an active surfactant kills all reagent at all dilutions, the starting concentration can be adjusted based on a known range of EC50 values of previously tested surfactants.) The stock solution is prepared at two times the starting concentration.
    </p>
    <p num="140">
      - a) Add 0.1 g (or adjusted amount if required) of anionic surfactant, accounting for activity of raw material, to beaker.
      <br/>
      - b) Microtox Diluent (2% NaCl, Microbics Corp.) is added to total 100 g.
      <br/>
      - c) Stir solution to make sure of adequate mixing.
      <br/>
      2. Reconstitution of Microtox Reagent and Preparation of Assay
      <br/>
      a) Turn on test unit and allow reagent well temperature to equilibrate at 5.5 (degree)  C. and incubator block and read well temperature to equilibrate at 15 (degree)  C.
      <br/>
      b) Place a clean cuvette (Microbics Corp.) in the reagent well, and fill with 1.0 ml of Microtox Reconstitution Solution (distilled water, Microbics, Corp.).
      <br/>
      Allow to cool for 15 minutes.
      <br/>
      c) Reconstitute standard vial of Microtox Acute Toxicity Reagent (Vibrio fischerio, Microbics Corp.) by quickly adding the 1.0 ml of the cooled reconstitution solution to the reagent vial.
      <br/>
      d) Swirl solution in the reagent vial for 2-3 seconds then pour reconstituted reagent back into the cooled cuvette and return the vial to the reagent well.
      <br/>
      Allow to stabilize for 15 minutes.
      <br/>
      e) Place 8 cuvettes containing 500  MU l of Microtox Diluent, as assay, into the incubator wells of the test unit.
      <br/>
      Let cool for 15 minutes.
      <br/>
      3. Test Substance Dilution
      <br/>
      Prepare 7 serial dilutions of the test substance from the sample stock solution.
      <br/>
      The final volume of all cuvettes must be 1.0 ml.
      <br/>
      - a) Place 8 empty cuvettes into a test tube rack.
      <br/>
      - b) Add 1.0 ml of Microtox Diluent solution to tubes 1-7.
      <br/>
      - c) Add 2.0 ml of the sample stock solution (1000 ppm) in cuvette 8.
      <br/>
      - d) Transfer 1.0 ml solution from cuvette 8 to cuvette 7 and mix cuvette 7.
      <br/>
      - e) Serially transfer 1.0 ml from the newly formed solution to the subsequent cuvette (7 to 6, 6 to 5 etc.).
      <br/>
      Remove 1.0 ml of solution from cuvette 2 and discard.
      <br/>
      Cuvette 1 is the blank containing only Microtox Diluent.
      <br/>
      Place the cuvettes into the test unit incubation wells keeping them in order of lowest to highest concentration.
      <br/>
      These cuvettes should correspond with the 8 cuvettes prepared in step 2 above.
      <br/>
      Allow to cool for 15 minutes.
      <br/>
      4. Assay and Sample Bioluminescence Testing
      <br/>
      a) Add 10  MU l of reconstituted reagent to the 8 precooled cuvettes of assay prepared in step 2 above (containing 500  MU l of diluent).
      <br/>
      Allow 15 minutes for reagent to stabilize.
      <br/>
      b) Start Microtox Data Capture and Reporting Software (Microbics Corp.), select START TESTING, input file name and description, correct starting concentration in ppm (500 if standard concentration is used) and number of controls (1) and dilutions (7).
      <br/>
      Time 1 should be selected as 5 minutes, time 2 is NONE.
      <br/>
      Press enter then the space bar to begin testing.
      <br/>
      c) Place the assay cuvette containing reagent which corresponds to the test blank into the read well and press SET.
      <br/>
      After the cuvette has resurfaced press READ and the value will be captured by the computer.
      <br/>
      d) Similarly read the remaining 7 cuvettes containing reagent when prompted by the computer by pressing the READ button with the correct cuvette in the READ well.
      <br/>
      e) After all 8 initial reading have been taken, transfer 500  MU l of the diluted test substance into their corresponding cuvette containing the reagent.
      <br/>
      Mix by vortexing or swirling and return to the incubation wells.
      <br/>
      The computer will count for five minutes and prompt you to begin final readings.
      <br/>
      f) Take final readings by placing the correct cuvette containing reagent and diluted test surfactant into the read well and pressing READ when prompted by the computer.
      <br/>
      5. Data Analysis
      <br/>
      The concentration of test substance, in ppm, that decreases the bioluminescence of the Microtox Acute Toxicity Reagent by 50% from the starting value (EC50 Value) can be calculated using the Run Statistics on Data File option of the Microtox Software (recommended) or by conducting a linear regression of the data (% reduction vs. log of concentration). % Reductions are calculated using the following formulas:  (Equation image '1' not included in text)

      <br/>
      a) Add 5.00 g of regular triclosan (TCS) powder to a 20 ml vial.
      <br/>
      b) Add 10  MU Ci of 14 C TCS and 1 ml of acetone.
      <br/>
      c) Stir the solution for 3 minutes or until all TCS is dissolved.
      <br/>
      d) Blow in N2 to remove most solvent until it solidifies again.
      <br/>
      e) Grind the solid to powder and dry it under N2 overnight to yield the labeled material ready for use.
      <br/>
      f) Measure activity of TCS in DPM/g to use as conversion factor for later samples.
      <br/>
      - 1.
      <br/>
      Place about 0.1 g of powdered TCS (note weight) from step e above into liquid scintillation vial.
      <br/>
      - 2.
      <br/>
      Add 10 ml of liquid scintillation fluid (Ultima Gold).
      <br/>
      - 3.
      <br/>
      Place in liquid scintillation counter and count decays per minute (DPM) of sample.
      <br/>
      - 4.
      <br/>
      Divide DPM by TCS weight from step 1-f-1 to determine conversion factor (DPM/g TCS).
      <br/>
      2. Solubility protocol
      <br/>
      a) Prepare stock solution of TCS deprived formula with anionic surfactant level of 16% in 7-9 grain tap water.
      <br/>
      b) Place 8 empty cuvettes into a test tube rack.
      <br/>
      c) Add 3 ml of the stock solution into a scintillation vial 1.
      <br/>
      d) Prepare five individual 3 ml solutions which are 1:2, 1:4, 1:8, 1:16, and 1:32 dilutions of the stock solution in five scintillation vials (ending concentrations are 8%, 4% 2%, 1%, and 0.5%).
      <br/>
      e) To each vial add about 0.05 g of the radio labeled TCS (from step 1-e above) and a magnetic stirring bar.
      <br/>
      Stir the vials as a group for at least 2 hours.
      <br/>
      If the TCS solid phase disappears, add additional TCS to ensure phase equilibrium.
      <br/>
      f) For each dilution, remove about 1.0 ml, place in 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube, and centrifuge it for 5 minutes at 1500 RPM.
      <br/>
      g) Remove about 0.1-0.4 g (note weight) from top layer of centrifuged sample and place in a clean liquid scintillation vial.
      <br/>
      h) Add 10 ml of liquid scintillation cocktail (Ultima Gold) to the vial.
      <br/>
      i) Count the vial's DPM using the liquid scintillation counter.
      <br/>
      j) Covert DPM to TCS weight using conversion factor from step 1-f above.
      <br/>
      k) Calculate percentage TCS (maximum solubility in sample) by dividing by weight from step 2-g.
      <br/>
      l) Repeat g through l for each serial dilution of anionic surfactant.
      <br/>
      3. Calculation of K
      <br/>
      The Solubility Slope, K, is calculated by conducting a linear regression of maximum TCS solubility vs. stirfactant concentration within the limits discussed below.
      <br/>
      - a) For almost all surfactants the slope of the solubility curve between 1 and 2% surfactant is representative of K.
      <br/>
      - b) For some surfactants the maximum TCS solubility curve remains linear outside the 1-2% surfactant region.
      <br/>
      K must then be calculated from this entire linear region, such as from 0-4%, 1-4%, or 0.5-2% surfactant levels.
    </p>
    <p num="143">It is important that K is calculated near the 2% surfactant range because this is an approximate concentration of surfactant in a diluted cleansing composition.</p>

      Both test and control products are tested on the same arm.
      <br/>
      The following test procedure is used.
      <br/>
      1. The subject wets the entire surface of his/her volar forearm with 95-100 (degree)  F. tap water by holding the arm briefly under running tap water.
      <br/>
      2. A clinical assistant wets one-quarter sheet (approximately 8" * 6") of Masslinn.RTM. towel with tap water, then squeezes the towel gently to remove excess water.
      <br/>
      3. A clinical assistant applies the products to the arm, beginning with the product designated for the site nearest the elbow, using the appropriate procedure as follows:
      <br/>
      Liquid Product
      <br/>
      - a. Dispense 0.10 cc of test product from a syringe into the center of the appropriate marked area.
      <br/>
      - b. Wet two finders of gloved (latex) hand under the running tap (index and middle fingers).
      <br/>
      - c. Move wetted fingers in a circular motion over the application site for 10 seconds to lather product.
      <br/>
      - d. Lather remains on the application site for 90 seconds, then is rinsed off with running tap water for 15 seconds, taking care not to wash lather off the adjacent sites.
      <br/>
      After 10 seconds of the rinse has expired, the Clinical Assistant will gently rub the site being rinsed with her two gloved fingers for the remaining 5 seconds of the rinse.
    </p>
    <p num="160">
      Bar Product
      <br/>
      - a. Wet two finders of gloved (latex) hand under the running tap (index and middle fingers).
      <br/>
      - b. Wet bar by holding bar briefly under running tap water.
      <br/>
      Test bars must be wet under a running tap at the start of each day.
      <br/>
      - c. Rub wetted fingers in a circular motion, over the surface of the bar, for 15 seconds to form lather on bar and fingers.
      <br/>
      - d. Rub the lathered fingers on the application site in a circular motion for 10 seconds to lather product on the skin.
      <br/>
      - e. Lather remains on the application site for 90 seconds, then is rinsed off with running tap water for 15 seconds, taking care not to wash lather off the adjacent sites.
      <br/>
      After 10 seconds of the rinse has expired, the Clinical Assistant will gently rub the site being rinsed with her two gloved fingers for the remaining 5 seconds of the rinse.

    <p num="161">
      Wipe Products
      <br/>
      - a. Fold wipe in half, crosswise, and gently rub the wipe in a curricular motion within the appropriate area.
      <br/>
      - b. Allow site to air dry for 90 seconds.
      <br/>
      Do not rinse site.

      - b. Move gloved fingers in a circular motion over the application site for 10 seconds.
      <br/>
      - c. Allow site to air dry for 90 seconds.
      <br/>
      Do not rinse site.
      <br/>
      4. While waiting for the 90 second residence time to expire, the above procedure will be repeated on the remaining application site on that arm, working down the arm toward the wrist.
      <br/>
      5. Steps 1-4 are repeated on the appropriate test areas so two applications of product are made to test areas.
      <br/>
      6. After all of the application areas have two applications of products, the clinical assistant gently pats the subject's arm dry with a disposable paper towel.

    <p num="168">Data</p>
    <p num="169">
      After all subjects have been evaluated at the end of the test, the following values are determined:
      <br/>
      Rco =The average rating of control product area at baseline
      <br/>
      Rcf =The average rating of control product area at test end
      <br/>
      Rto =The average rating of test product area at baseline
      <br/>
      Rtf =The average rating if test product area at test end.
    </p>
    <p num="170">
      There are many external conditions which could influence the FCAT, such as relative humidity and water softness.
      <br/>
      The test is valid only if sufficient response is observed in the skin to the control product.
      <br/>
      The control response must be greater than 1.0 (i.e., Rcf -Rco &gt;= 1.0) for the test to be valid.
    </p>
    <p num="171">Given a valid test, the Mildness Index of the test product is the difference in the skin responses to two products.</p>

    <p num="173">CONSISTENCY (k) AND SHEAR INDEX (n) OF THE LIPOPHILIC SKIN MOISTURIZING AGENT</p>
    <p num="174">
      The Carrimed CSL 100 Controlled Stress Rheometer is used to determine Shear Index, n, and Consistency, k, of the lipophilic skin moisturizing agent used herein.
      <br/>
      The determination is performed at 35 (degree)  C. with the 4 cm 2 (degree)  cone measuring system typically set with a 51 micron gap and is performed via the programmed application of a shear stress (typically from about 0.06 dynes/sq. cm to about 5,000 dynes/sq. cm) over time.
      <br/>
      If this stress results in a deformation of the sample, i.e. strain of the measuring geometry of at least 10-4 rad/sec, then this rate of strain is reported as a shear rate.
      <br/>
      These data are used to create a viscosity  MU Vs. shear rate  GAMMA ' flow curve for the material.
      <br/>
      This flow curve can then be modeled in order to provide a mathematical expression that describes the material's behavior within specific limits of shear stress and shear rate.
      <br/>
      These results were fitted with the following well accepted power law model (see for instance: Chemical Engineering, by Coulson and Richardson, Pergamon, 1982 or Transport Phenomena by Bird, Stewart and Lightfoot, Wiley, 1960):
      <br/>

    <heading>VISCOSITY OF THE RINSE-OFF ANTIMICROBIAL CLEANSING COMPOSITION</heading>
    <p num="175">
      The Wells-Brookfield Cone/Plate Model DV-II+ Viscometer is used to determine the viscosity of the rinse-off antimicrobial cleansing compositions herein.
      <br/>
      The determination is performed at 25 (degree)  C. with the 2.4 cm (degree)  cone (Spindle CP-41) measuring system with a gap of 0.013 mm between the two small pins on the respective cone and plate.
      <br/>
      The measurement is performed by injecting 0.5 ml of the sample to be analyzed between the cone and plate and rotating the cone at a set speed of 1 rpm.
      <br/>
      The resistance to the rotation of the cone produces a torque that is proportional to the shear stress of the liquid sample.
      <br/>
      The amount of torque is read and computed by the viscometer into absolute centipoise units (mPa's) based on geometric constants of the cone, the rate of rotation, and the stress related torque.

      The ingredients can be processed to form bars using conventional soap line equipment.
      <br/>
      For example, processing can be carried out as follows: First add the anionic surfactants to the crutcher.
      <br/>
      Next add the acid, and incorporate enough water such that the crutcher mixture is smooth fluid and has a manageable viscosity under agitation.
      <br/>
      Adjust the pH to target with required base (NaOH).
      <br/>
      Adjust the temperature of the mixture to 160-200 (degree)  F. range.
      <br/>
      Next, introduce the dextrin into the mixture.
