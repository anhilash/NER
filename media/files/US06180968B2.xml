      Field of the Invention
    </p>
    <p num="2">The present invention relates to a compound semiconductor device and a method of manufacturing the same and, more particularly, to a field effect transistor having a multilevel recess structure and a method of manufacturing the same.</p>
    <p num="3">2. Description of the Prior Art</p>
    <p num="4">
      When an LDD structure is to be realized with an HJFET in order to attain a higher gate breakdown voltage, a lower source resistance, and suppression of the short channel effect and the surface effect, a multilevel recess structure must be formed by performing recess etching in two stages upon two alignment processes in a conventional case.
      <br/>
      In Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 4-137737, a multilayered mask is used to selectively side-etch the mask, thereby realizing a two-level recess structure with improved controllability in the lateral direction.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      When a two-level recess is formed using two alignment processes, misalignment disadvantageously occurs, and the distance between the gate and the n+ region is difficult to control and shorten.
      <br/>
      Even if the controllability in the lateral direction is improved using a multilayered mask, as disclosed in Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 4-137737, etching also progresses along the lateral direction in recess etching, and a short gate and control of the recess width cannot be attained.
    </p>
    <p num="6">As for the direction of depth in recess etching, the recess depths at the first and second levels are controlled in terms of time, resulting in poor reproducibility, low controllability, and low uniformity.</p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="7">The present invention has been made in consideration of the above situation in the prior art, and has as its object to provide a compound semiconductor device which can be manufactured while precisely controlling the recess width and depth.</p>
    <p num="8">To achieve the above object, according to the basic aspect of the present invention, there is provided a compound semiconductor device comprising a semiconductor multilayered structure,</p>
    <p num="9">wherein the semiconductor multilayered structure consists of a first recess etching stopper formed on a conductive layer of a compound semiconductor, a first semiconductor layer formed on the first recess etching stopper layer, a second recess etching stopper layer formed on the first semiconductor layer, and a second semiconductor layer formed on the second recess etching stopper layer.</p>
    <p num="10">According to the present invention, the first and second semiconductor layers defined in the basic aspect may consist of a compound semiconductor selected from the group consisting of GaAs, InAs, Alx Ga1-x As (0 &lt;= x&lt;1), Aly In1-y As (0 &lt;= y&lt;1), InP, GaP, and compounds thereof.</p>
    <p num="11">According to the present invention, the first and second etching stopper layers defined in the basic aspect may consist of a material selected from the group consisting of AlAs, Alz Ga1-z As (0&lt;z &lt;= 1) having an Al composition higher than that of Alx Ga1-x As, and Alw In1 w As (0&lt;w &lt;= 1) having an Al composition higher than that of Aly In1-y As.</p>
    <p num="12">Further, according to the present invention, the semiconductor multilayered structure defined in the basic aspect has a gate parallel to a �011� direction.</p>
    <p num="13">To achieve the above object, according to another basic aspect of the present invention, there is provided a method of manufacturing a compound semiconductor device with a semiconductor multilayered structure, comprising the mask formation step, the patterning step, the first anisotropic etching step, and the second anisotropic etching step,</p>
    <p num="14">wherein the semiconductor multilayered structure has a first recess etching stopper layer formed on a conductive layer of a compound semiconductor, a first semiconductor layer formed on the first recess etching stopper layer, a second recess etching stopper layer formed on the first semiconductor layer, and a second semiconductor layer formed on the second recess etching stopper layer,</p>
    <p num="15">the mask formation step is the process of forming first and second mask layers having different etching rates on the semiconductor multilayered structure,</p>
    <p num="16">the patterning step is the process of patterning the second mask layer and patterning the first mask layer using the patterned second mask,</p>
    <p num="17">the first anisotropic etching step is the process of anisotropically etching the second semiconductor layer to the second recess etching stopper by using the first and second mask layers, and</p>
    <p num="18">the second anisotropic etching step is the process of removing the second recess etching stopper layer at an opening portion, selectively increasing an opening width of the first mask layer by side etching, and then anisotropically etching the second and first semiconductor layers to the second and first recess etching stopper layers, respectively.</p>
    <p num="19">The first and second semiconductor layers defined in the basic aspect of the manufacturing method are anisotropically etched by using, as an etching solution, a solution mixture of an aqueous citric acid solution and a hydrogen peroxide solution.</p>
    <p num="20">
      As is apparent from the above aspects, in the present invention, first and second mask layers having different etching rates are formed on a semiconductor multilayered structure.
      <br/>
      The second mask layer is patterned, and the first mask layer is patterned using the patterned second mask layer.
      <br/>
      The second semiconductor layer is anisotropically etched to the second recess etching stopper layer by using the first and second mask layers.
    </p>
    <p num="21">
      In anisotropic etching to the second recess etching stopper layer, a solution mixture of an aqueous citric acid solution and a hydrogen peroxide solution is used as an etching solution.
      <br/>
      The citric acid-based etching solution can selectively etch a semiconductor layer formed of, e.g., GaAs and a stopper layer formed of, e.g., AlAs, and its etching rate for a (111) B plane can be suppressed very small.
      <br/>
      If this citric acid-based etching solution is used for etching the semiconductor multilayered structure, etching can be stopped at the (111) B plane without any side etching in the lateral direction and at the second recess etching stopper layer in the direction of depth.
    </p>
    <p num="22">By using the above-described etching method, the depth and opening width at the first level are determined by the position of the second recess etching stopper layer and the opening dimension of the second mask layer almost independently of the etching time.</p>
    <p num="23">Since the opening shape is rate-determined by the (111) B plane by forming the gate parallel to the �011� direction, the opening at the second level can be made smaller than the opening dimension of the second mask layer.</p>
    <p num="24">
      The second recess etching stopper layer is removed at the opening portion.
      <br/>
      After the opening width of the first mask layer is selectively increased by side etching, the second and first semiconductor layers are anisotropically etched again to the second and first recess etching stopper layers with a citric acid-based etching solution.
    </p>
    <p num="25">
      Since the second semiconductor layer is etched only at the opening portion due to the presence of the second recess etching stopper layer, a two-level recess structure can be easily formed.
      <br/>
      The opening width at the second level is already determined by the initial recess width at the first level.
      <br/>
      By forming the gate parallel to the �011� direction, the opening width decreased upon recess etching at the first level is further decreased upon etching at the second level.
    </p>
    <p num="26">
      The carrier density of the first semiconductor layer is set lower than that of the second semiconductor layer.
      <br/>
      The gate electrode is short-circuited with the first semiconductor layer, and is spaced apart from the heavily doped second semiconductor layer.
      <br/>
      With this arrangement, a high drain breakdown voltage can be attained while surface influences such as a gate lag are avoided.
      <br/>
      This structure can be easily fabricated in self-alignment.
      <br/>
      The recess width at the second level in the lateral direction is determined by the initial mask opening width and the thicknesses of the first and second semiconductor layers.
      <br/>
      The etching depth is determined by the position of the stopper layer.
      <br/>
      The recess width at the first level can be controlled by the side etching amount of the first mask layer, and the depth is determined by the stopper layer.
      <br/>
      For this reason, the controllability, uniformity, and reproducibility of a threshold voltage Vt are improved.
      <br/>
      When the gate is formed parallel to the �011� direction, the channel (gate) can be easily made shorter than the mask opening dimension by an amount controlled by the thicknesses of the first and second semiconductor layers, resulting in an improvement in device characteristics.
    </p>
    <p num="27">
      As described above, according to the present invention, etching can be stopped at the (111) B plane defined by the mask without any side etching in the lateral direction.
      <br/>
      The etching depth is determined by the stopper layer.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the device can be fabricated almost independently of the etching time.
      <br/>
      The controllability, uniformity, and reproducibility of the threshold voltage Vt can also be improved.
      <br/>
      Further, since the wet process is employed, the process facilities are simple, and the cost can also be reduced.
    </p>
    <p num="28">As for the device characteristics, since the gate electrode and the lightly doped semiconductor layer can be short-circuited or the distance therebetween can be decreased with high controllability, surface influences such as a gate lag can be avoided in the semiconductor device.</p>
    <p num="29">
      In addition, the distance between the gate electrode and the heavily doped semiconductor layer depends on the width and thickness of the mask layer, and recesses at two levels can be easily formed with high controllability.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the source resistance can be reduced while keeping a high drain breakdown voltage.

    <p num="30">The above and many other objects, features and advantages of the present invention will become manifest to those skilled in the art upon making reference to the following detailed description and accompanying drawings in which preferred embodiments incorporating the principles of the present invention are shown by way of illustrative example.</p>

    <p num="32">A heterojunction field effect transistor according to an embodiments of the present invention will be described below with reference to the accompanying drawings (FIGS. 1A to 1L).</p>
    <p num="33">
      As shown in FIG. 1A, a 500-nm i-GaAs buffer layer 2, a 15-nm i-InGaAs layer serving as a channel layer 3, and a 33-nm n-AlGaAs layer 4 having a carrier concentration of 2 * 1018 cm-3 are formed on a semi-insulating GaAs substrate 1 by, e.g., MOCVD from the substrate side.
      <br/>

      <br/>
      A 150-nm lightly doped n-GaAs layer having a carrier concentration of 1 * 1018 cm-3 is formed as a first semiconductor layer 6 on the first recess etching stopper layer 5.
      <br/>
      A 2-nm n-AlAs layer having a carrier concentration of 2 * 1018 cm-3 is formed as a second recess etching stopper layer 7 on the n-GaAs layer 6.
      <br/>
      A 50-nm heavily doped n-GaAs layer having a carrier concentration of 4 * 1018 cm-3 is formed as a second semiconductor layer 8 on the second recess etching stopper layer 7.
      <br/>
      In this manner, the semiconductor multilayered structure of the present invention is fabricated.
    </p>
    <p num="34">
      The semiconductor device manufacturing method of the present invention will be described with reference to this compound semiconductor multilayered structure.
      <br/>
      A 50-nm SiO2 layer is formed as a first mask layer 9 having a different etching rate on the semiconductor multilayered structure, and further a photoresist is formed as a second mask layer 10 (FIG. 1B).
    </p>
    <p num="35">
      The photoresist serving as the second mask layer 10 is patterned (FIG. 1C).
      <br/>
      The first SiO2 mask layer 9 is patterned using the patterned second mask layer 10 (FIG. 1D).
    </p>
    <p num="36">
      The n-GaAs layer serving as the second semiconductor layer 8 is anisotropically etched to the second AlAs recess etching stopper layer 7 using the first and second mask layers 9 and 10.
      <br/>
      This etching is performed using, as an etching solution, a solution mixture of an aqueous citric acid solution prepared by dissolving citric acid hydrate in water of the same weight, and a 30%-hydrogen peroxide solution at 3:1 (FIG. 1E).
    </p>
    <p num="37">
      The AlAs layer serving as the second recess etching stopper layer 7 is removed at the opening portion.
      <br/>
      The opening width of the first SiO2 mask layer 9 is selectively increased by etching in the lateral direction with buffered hydrofluoric acid.
      <br/>
      The n-GaAs layer serving as the second semiconductor layer 8 and the n-GaAs layer serving as the first semiconductor layer 6 are anisotropically etched again to the second and first recess etching stopper layers 7 and 5 with a citric acid-based etching solution (FIGS. 1F, 1G, and 1H).
    </p>
    <p num="38">
      The exposed portions of the first and second recess etching stopper layers 5 and 7 are removed with diluted hydrochloric acid (FIG. 1I).
      <br/>
      Ti/Pt/At is deposited as a gate metal using the photoresist serving as the first mask layer 9 to form a gate electrode 11 by the lift-off method (FIGS. 1J and 1K).
      <br/>
      An ohmic electrode 12 with a normal size is formed on the resultant structure to complete a semiconductor device (FIG. 1L).
    </p>
    <p num="39">
      The citric acid-based etching solution enables selective etching of GaAs and AlGaAs, and its etching rate for the (111) B plane can be suppressed very small at low temperatures.
      <br/>
      More specifically, the opening width and depth of recess etching at the first level are determined by the opening dimension of the first mask layer upon side etching and the position of the stopper layer, respectively.
      <br/>
      The opening width and depth at the second level are determined by the opening dimension of the first mask layer before side etching and the position of the stopper layer, respectively.
      <br/>
      For this reason, etching can be stopped at the (111) B plane defined by the mask without any side etching in the lateral direction.
      <br/>
      The etching depth is determined by the stopper layer.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the device can be fabricated almost independently of the etching time.
    </p>
    <p num="40">Since the opening shape in the lateral direction is rate-determined by the (111) B plane, the bottom width upon recess etching becomes larger than the initial mask opening width in accordance with the film thickness by forming the gate parallel to the �011� direction.</p>
    <p num="41">In the present invention, the opening width which becomes smaller upon recess etching at the first level than the initial opening width of the second mask layer before side etching becomes still smaller at the opening portion of the AlGaAs electron supply layer upon etching at the second level.</p>
    <p num="42">
      With this arrangement, a short channel can be easily realized to improve the device characteristics.
      <br/>
      In this embodiment, when the initial opening width of the second mask layer is 0.5  MU m, a 0.22- MU m gate can be formed because the gate is shortened by an inclination amount of 0.14  MU m from each side.
    </p>
    <p num="43">
      In the semiconductor device fabricated in this manner, the gate electrode 11 and the lightly doped first semiconductor layer 6 can be short-circuited or the distance therebetween can be decreased with high controllability.
      <br/>
      Therefore, surface influences such as a gate lag can be avoided.
    </p>
    <p num="44">
      The distance between the gate electrode 11 and the heavily doped second semiconductor layer 8 depends on the opening width and thickness of the first mask layer upon selective etching, and the gate electrode 11 can be formed in self-alignment, so that the distance can be easily controlled.
      <br/>
      If the distance of the gate electrode 11 with respect to the second semiconductor layer 8 and its carrier concentration are properly set, the source resistance can be reduced while keeping a high drain breakdown voltage.
    </p>
    <p num="45">
      In the recess formation step, the formation precision in the lateral direction is increased because no side etching is performed.
      <br/>
      Since the etching depth is determined by the stopper layer, the controllability, uniformity, and reproducibility of the threshold voltage Vt are also improved.
      <br/>
      Since the wet process is employed, the process facilities are simple, and the cost is also reduced.
    </p>
    <p num="46">
      In the embodiment of the present invention, although AlAs is used for a stopper layer, the stopper layer may consist of AlGaAs with a composition within the range where etching selectivity with GaAs can be obtained.
      <br/>
      In this embodiment, the composition ratio of the etching solution is 3:1, but is not limited to this as far as the selectivity and anisotropy can be attained.
      <br/>
      The etching solution may be added with ammonium citrate or the like as a buffer solution.
      <br/>
      In addition, although a photoresist and SiO2 are used as mask layers, a mask material capable of selective etching, such as SiO2 and SiON, may be used.
      <br/>
      As for the material system, although this embodiment exemplifies the AlGaAs/InGaAs/GaAs system, the AlInAs/GaInAs system, the AlInAs/InGaAs/InGaP system, and the like can be employed.
