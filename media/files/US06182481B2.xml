    <p num="1">The within invention claims the benefit under Title 35, United States Code .sctn. 119 (e) of Provisional Application 60/105,777 entitled "Security Lock For Laptop and Notebook Computers", filed Oct. 27, 1998.</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">
      1.
      <br/>
      Field of the Invention
    </p>
    <p num="3">This present invention relates to a novel security lock for notebook or laptop computers, and more specifically to a security lock which seals shut a laptop or notebook computer, may also anchor the laptop computer to a stationary base and which may act as a transportation handle.</p>
    <p num="4">2. Background</p>
    <p num="5">
      Notebook computers are easily tampered with, data may be accessed without authorization and corrupted or stolen.
      <br/>
      A security lock is therefore needed which will secure, via a mechanical seal, a wide variety of different size notebook and laptop computers and which may also anchor and prevent the removal of the computer.
    </p>
    <p num="6">Prior art computer security locks, teach mounting anchors some easily attached to various laptop configurations others narrowly specific to the type of lap top the will engage with.</p>
    <p num="7">
      In U.S. Pat. No. 5,351,508, by Kelley, a combination handle and anchor for a cable locking system is taught, which will replace extended feet formed as part of a particular computer model and can form a mounting anchor for a cable lock.
      <br/>
      Not taught or envisioned is a lock which prevents the opening of the laptop and thereby keeps the machine turned off and data secure.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      In U.S. Pat. No. 5,787,738 issued to Brandt, a small locking plate with a catching end and a free end may be extended between the keyboard and monitor of a laptop computer and a cable lock affixed to the free end.
      <br/>
      Such a lock catches the bottom edge of the monitor and may damage the monitor and does not prevent unauthorized access to the computers data.
    </p>
    <p num="9">Prior art does not provide a simple device for securing the data within the laptop computer, by prohibiting the opening of the laptop computer, nor does prior art provide a combination security lock which seals the notebook computer shut and an anchor mount to affix the laptop in an open or sealed position to a stationary object.</p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="10">Accordingly, it is an object of the invention to provide a novel security lock for notebook computers.</p>
    <p num="11">It is yet another object of the invention to provide a novel security lock which maintains the closure of a notebook computer.</p>
    <p num="12">It is yet another object of the invention to provide a novel security lock which maintains the closure of a notebook computer and provides for a secondary anchor mount for a lock to a stationary object.</p>
    <p num="13">It is yet another object of the invention to provide a novel security lock which maintains the closure of a notebook computer and provides for a secondary anchor mount for a lock to a stationary object and a carrying handle.</p>
    <p num="14">It is yet another object of the invention to provide a novel security lock which maintains the closure of a notebook computer and provides a motion sensing alarm.</p>
    <p num="15">It is yet another object of the invention to provide a novel security lock which maintains the closure of a notebook computer and provides a motion sensing alarm and a carrying handle.</p>
    <p num="16">
      The features of the invention believed to be novel are set forth with particularity in the appended claim.
      <br/>
      The invention itself, however, both as to configuration, and method of operation, and the advantages thereof, may be best understood by reference to the following descriptions taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.
    </p>
    <heading>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading>
    <p num="17">
      FIG. 1A illustrates a perspective assembly view of the preferred embodiment of the security lock for notebook computers.
      <br/>
      FIG. 1B illustrates a perspective rear view of the alarm box for the security lock for notebook computers.
      <br/>
      FIG. 1C illustrates a perspective assembly view of the embodiment of FIG. 1A anchoring an open laptop.
    </p>
    <heading>MODES FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="18">Referring now to FIG. 1A there is illustrated a perspective assembly view of alternate embodiments of the security lock for notebook computers, generally designated 10.</p>
    <p num="19">
      The notebook computer 100 has a monitor 101 and a CPU/keyboard 102 if kept in the closed position the use of the notebook computer 100 is prevented.
      <br/>
      A body lock catch 103 formed as part of, or cut into, the CPU/keyboard 102 portion of the notebook computer case, is of a size and shape to allow insertion of a cylindrical body lock 18, such locking mechanisms are well known in the art therefore a detailed description of its construction has not been included.
      <br/>
      Such a lock generally comprises a keyed entry, a latching member and a positioning guide.
    </p>
    <p num="20">
      The cylindrical body lock 18 passes into the reversible lock catch 12 formed as part of the "T" shaped cover latch 13 and mates with the body lock catch 103 affixing the security lock 10 to the notebook computer 100.
      <br/>
      When the "T" shaped cover latch 13 is positioned over the monitor 101 it will prevent the monitor 101 from being raised from the CPU/keyboard 102.
    </p>
    <p num="21">
      For convenience one "side of T" shaped cover latch 13 has a hand guide 14 which forms a handle for carrying.
      <br/>
      To attach the "T" shaped cover latch 13 to the notebook computer 100, a user passes the cylindrical body lock 18 into through the reversible lock catch 12 to the body lock catch 103 and a key 15 is turned to actuate the locking mechanism.
    </p>
    <p num="22">
      An alarm box 16 which houses a battery operated motion sensing switch with audible alarm, which is known art therefore a detailed description of its construction is not included, may be added to, or integrated into, the device.
      <br/>
      Through the alarm box 16 an alarm lock catch 17 is formed through which the cylindrical body lock 18 may pass through and then through the reversible lock catch 12 to mate with the body lock catch 103, thereby affixing the security lock 10 and alarm box 16 to the notebook computer 100.
      <br/>
      Not shown is an "on/off" switch or access cover on the rear alarm box 16 adjacent to the reversible lock catch 12.
      <br/>
      A keyed mechanical switch is contemplated with a rotating switching arm and a pressure switch.
    </p>
    <p num="23">
      Referring now to FIG. 1B there is illustrated a perspective rear view of the alarm box for the security lock for notebook computers generally designated 16.
      <br/>
      A access window 19 formed on the rear of the alarm box 16, has a plate cover 20 with a mounting screw 21, whereby the battery supply may be changed as needed.
      <br/>
      A "on/off" pressure switch 22 extending through the back of the alarm box 16, via a switch guide 23, when closed, activates the electrical circuit and supplies power to both the alarm and a red LED 24, which is conductively connected to the alarm circuit.
      <br/>
      To disarm the alarm, the user simply removes the cylindrical body lock (not shown) and slides the alarm box 12 forward to disengage the pressure switch.
    </p>
    <p num="24">
      Referring now to FIG. 1C there is illustrated a perspective assembly view of the embodiment of FIG. 1A, generally designated 10, anchoring an open notebook computer 100.
      <br/>
      By reversing the mount of the "T" shaped cover latch 13 so that it rests under the CPU/monitor 102, the hand guide 14 may be used to anchor a cable lock 150 to both the security lock 10 and a stationary object 160.
    </p>
    <p num="25">Since certain changes may be made in the above apparatus without departing from the scope of the invention herein involved, it is intended that all matter contained in the above description, as shown in the accompanying drawing, shall be interpreted in an illustrative, and not a limiting sense.</p>
