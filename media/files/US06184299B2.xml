    <p num="1">This invention relates to a process for preparing an in situ polyethylene blend in which process improved reactor operability and/or product enhancement is achieved.</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND INFORMATION</heading>
    <p num="2">
      There has been a rapid growth in the market for linear low density polyethylene (LLDPE), particularly resin made under mild operating conditions; typically at pressures of 100 to 400 psi and reaction temperatures of less than 120 (degree)  C. This low pressure process provides a broad range of LLDPE products for blown and cast film, injection molding, rotational molding, blow molding, pipe, tubing, and wire and cable applications.
      <br/>
      LLDPE has essentially a linear backbone with only short chain branches, about 2 to 6 carbon atoms in length.
      <br/>
      In LLDPE, the length and frequency of branching, and, consequently, the density, is controlled by the type and amount of comonomer used in the polymerization.
      <br/>
      Although the majority of the LLDPE resins on the market today have a narrow molecular weight distribution, LLDPE resins with a broad molecular weight distribution are available for a number of non-film applications.
    </p>
    <p num="3">
      LLDPE resins designed for commodity type applications typically incorporate 1-butene as the comonomer.
      <br/>
      The use of a higher molecular weight alpha-olefin comonomer produces resins with significant strength advantages relative to those of ethylene/1-butene copolymers.
      <br/>
      The predominant higher alpha-olefin comonomers in commercial use are 1-hexene, 4-methyl-1-pentene, and 1-octene.
      <br/>
      The bulk of the LLDPE is used in film products where the excellent physical properties and drawdown characteristics of LLDPE film makes this film well suited for a broad spectrum of applications.
      <br/>
      Fabrication of LLDPE film is generally effected by the blown film and slot casting processes.
      <br/>
      The resulting film is characterized by excellent tensile strength, high ultimate elongation, good impact strength, and excellent puncture resistance.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      These properties together with toughness are enhanced when the polyethylene is of high molecular weight.
      <br/>
      However, as the molecular weight of the polyethylene increases, the processability of the resin usually decreases.
      <br/>
      By providing a blend of polymers, the properties characteristic of high molecular weight resins can be retained and processability, particularly the extrudability (from the lower molecular weight component) can be improved.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      The blending of these polymers is successfully achieved in a staged reactor process similar to those described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,047,468 and 5,149,738.
      <br/>
      Briefly, the process is one for the in situ blending of polymers wherein a higher density ethylene copolymer is prepared in a high melt index reactor and a lower density ethylene copolymer is prepared in a low melt index reactor.
      <br/>
      The process typically comprises continuously contacting, under polymerization conditions, a mixture of ethylene and one or more alpha-olefins with a catalyst system in two gas phase, fluidized bed reactors connected in series, said catalyst system comprising: (i) a supported magnesium/titanium based catalyst precursor; (ii) an aluminum containing activator compound; and (iii) a hydrocarbyl aluminum cocatalyst, the polymerization conditions being such that an ethylene copolymer having a melt index in the range of about 0.1 to about 1000 grams per 10 minutes is formed in the high melt index reactor and an ethylene copolymer having a melt index in the range of about 0.001 to about 1 gram per 10 minutes is formed in the low melt index reactor, each copolymer having a density of about 0.860 to about 0.965 gram per cubic centimeter and a melt flow ratio in the range of about 22 to about 70, with the provisos that:
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      (a) the mixture of ethylene copolymer matrix and active catalyst formed in the first reactor in the series is transferred to the second reactor in the series;
      <br/>
      (b) other than the active catalyst referred to in proviso (a) and the cocatalyst referred to in proviso (e), no additional catalyst is introduced into the second reactor;
      <br/>
      (c) in the high melt index reactor:
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      - (1) the alpha-olefin is present in a ratio of about 0.02 to about 3.5 moles of alpha-olefin per mole of ethylene; and
      <br/>
      - (2) hydrogen is present in a ratio of about 0.05 to about 3 moles of hydrogen per mole of combined ethylene and alpha-olefin;
      <br/>
      (d) in the low melt index reactor:
      <br/>
      - (1) the alpha-olefin is present in a ratio of about 0.02 to about 3.5 moles of alpha-olefin per mole of ethylene; and
      <br/>
      - (2) hydrogen is, optionally, present in a ratio of about 0.0001 to about 0.5 mole of hydrogen per mole of combined ethylene and alpha-olefin; and
      <br/>
      (e) additional hydrocarbyl aluminum cocatalyst is introduced into the second reactor in an amount sufficient to restore the level of activity of the catalyst transferred from the first reactor to about the initial level of activity in the first reactor.
    </p>
    <p num="8">While the in situ blends prepared as above and the films produced therefrom are found to have the advantageous characteristics heretofore mentioned, it is found that reactor operability is affected by the choice of the cocatalyst, particularly trimethylaluminum.</p>
    <heading>DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="9">
      An object of this invention, therefore, is to provide a process for preparing an in situ blend in which catalyst productivity is substantially increased over prior art in situ processes.
      <br/>
      Other objects and advantages will become apparent hereinafter.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      According to the present invention such a process has been discovered.
      <br/>
      The process comprises contacting ethylene and at least one alpha-olefin comonomer having 3 to 8 carbon atoms with a transition metal based catalyst system in two fluidized bed reactors connected in series, in the gas phase, under polymerization conditions, with the provisos that:
      <br/>
      (a) ethylene is introduced into each reactor;
      <br/>
      (b) the mixture of ethylene copolymer matrix and active catalyst formed in the first reactor in the series is transferred to the second reactor in the series;
      <br/>
      (c) other than the active catalyst referred to in proviso (b), no additional catalyst is introduced into the second reactor;
      <br/>
      (d) a hydrocarbyl aluminum cocatalyst is introduced into the first reactor and a different hydrocarbyl aluminum cocatalyst or no cocatalyst is introduced into the second reactor;
      <br/>
      (e) in the reactor in which a low melt or flow index copolymer is made:
      <br/>
      - (1) the alpha-olefin is present in a ratio of about 0.01 to about 0.8 mol of alpha-olefin per mol of ethylene; and
      <br/>
      - (2) optionally, hydrogen is present in a ratio of about 0.001 to about 0.3 mol of hydrogen per mol of ethylene; and
      <br/>
      (f) in the reactor in which a high melt or flow index polymer is made:
      <br/>
      - (1) optionally, alpha-olefin is present in a ratio of about 0.005 to about 0.6 mol of alpha-olefin per mol of ethylene; and
      <br/>
      - (2) optionally. hydrogen is present in a ratio of about 0.2 to about 3 mols of hydrogen per mol of ethylene.
    </p>
    <p num="11">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT(S)</p>
    <p num="12">As noted, the blend is produced in two staged reactors connected in series wherein a mixture of resin and active catalyst is transferred from the first reactor to the second reactor in which another polymer is prepared and blends in situ with the copolymer from the first reactor.</p>
    <p num="13">
      The gaseous materials used in the process can be introduced into the reactors via a recycle gas.
      <br/>
      The recycle gas is defined as a mixture of gases including ethylene and one or more alpha-olefins having 3 to 8 carbon atoms, preferably one or two alpha-olefins, as comonomers (alpha-olefin is required in the first reactor recycle gas and is optional in the second reactor recycle gas), and, optionally, one or more inert gases such as nitrogen (to make up the desired reactor pressure), inert hydrocarbons, and hydrogen.
      <br/>
      The alpha-olefins can be, for example, propylene, 1-butene, 1-hexene, 4-methyl-1-pentene, and 1-octene.
      <br/>
      The recycle gas can also be referred to as the inlet gas or cycle gas.
    </p>
    <p num="14">Preferred comonomer combinations are:</p>
    <p num="15">
      --
      <br/>
      --             first reactor         second reactor
      <br/>
      --             1-hexene              1-hexene
      <br/>
      --             1-butene              1-hexene
      <br/>
      --             1-butene              1-butene
      <br/>
      --             1-hexene              1-butene
    </p>
    <p num="16">
      The 1-hexene/1-hexene combination is found to give the best film properties.
      <br/>
      It is noted that an ethylene homopolymer can be made in the second reactor, if desired.
    </p>
    <p num="17">
      It will be understood that generally the in situ blend can be characterized as a bimodal resin.
      <br/>
      In some cases, however, the two components making up the blend are sufficiently close in average molecular weight that there is no discernible discontinuity in the molecular weight curve.
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      The properties of bimodal resins are strongly dependent on the proportion of the high molecular weight component, i.e., the low melt or flow index component.
      <br/>
      For a staged reactor system, the proportion of the high molecular weight component is controlled via the relative production rate in each reactor.
      <br/>
      The relative production rate in each reactor can, in turn, be controlled by a computer application program, which monitors the production rate in the reactors (measured by heat balance) and then manipulates the ethylene partial pressure in each reactor and catalyst feed rate in order to meet the production rate, the production rate split, and catalyst productivity requirements.
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      Transition metal catalyst systems can be exemplified by the magnesium/titanium catalyst system described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,302,565. In addition to the gas phase, the resins referred to in this specification can also be produced in a slurry or solution phase.
      <br/>
      The precursor can be supported or unsupported.
      <br/>
      Another catalyst system is one where the precursor is formed by spray drying and used in slurry form.
      <br/>
      Such a catalyst precursor, for example, contains titanium, magnesium, and an electron donor, and, optionally, an aluminum halide.
      <br/>
      The precursor is then introduced into a hydrocarbon medium such as mineral oil to provide the slurry form.
      <br/>
      This is described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,290,745. Further, the catalyst system can be a vanadium based catalyst system such as that described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,508,842; a chromium based catalyst system such as that described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,101,445; or other transition metal catalyst systems useful in the preparation of polyolefins such as polyethylene and polypropylene.
      <br/>
      Many of these catalyst systems are often referred to as Ziegler-Natta catalyst systems.
      <br/>
      Catalyst systems, which use chromium or molybdenum oxides on silica-alumina supports, are also useful.
      <br/>
      The preferred catalyst system is a magnesium/titanium based catalyst system.
    </p>
    <p num="20">With respect to typical magnesium/titanium based catalyst systems:</p>
    <p num="21">
      The electron donor, if used in the catalyst precursor, is an organic Lewis base, liquid at temperatures in the range of about 0 (degree)  C. to about 200 (degree)  C., in which the magnesium and titanium compounds are soluble.
      <br/>
      The electron donor can be an alkyl ester of an aliphatic or aromatic carboxylic acid, an aliphatic ketone, an aliphatic amine, an aliphatic alcohol, an alkyl or cycloalkyl ether, or mixtures thereof, each electron donor having 2 to 20 carbon atoms.
      <br/>
      Among these electron donors, the preferred are alkyl and cycloalkyl ethers having 2 to 20 carbon atoms; dialkyl, diaryl, and alkylaryl ketones having 3 to 20 carbon atoms; and alkyl, alkoxy, and alkylalkoxy esters of alkyl and aryl carboxylic acids having 2 to 20 carbon atoms.
      <br/>
      The most preferred electron donor is tetrahydrofuran.
      <br/>
      Other examples of suitable electron donors are methyl formate, ethyl acetate, butyl acetate, ethyl ether, dioxane, di-n-propyl ether, dibutyl ether, ethyl formate, methyl acetate, ethyl anisate, ethylene carbonate, tetrahydropyran, and ethyl propionate.
    </p>
    <p num="22">While an excess of electron donor is used initially to provide the reaction product of titanium compound and electron donor, the reaction product finally contains about 1 to about 20 moles of electron donor per mole of titanium compound and preferably about 1 to about 10 moles of electron donor per mole of titanium compound.</p>
    <p num="23">
      An activator compound is optional, but is often used with any of the titanium based catalyst precursors.
      <br/>
      The activator can have the formula AlRa Xb Hc wherein each X is independently chlorine, bromine, iodine, or OR'; each R and R' is independently a saturated aliphatic hydrocarbon radical having 1 to 14 carbon atoms; b is 0 to 1.5; c is 0 or 1; and a+b+c=3.
      <br/>
      Preferred activators include alkylaluminium mono- and dichlorides wherein each alkyl radical has 1 to 6 carbon atoms and the trialkylaluminums.
      <br/>
      A particularly preferred activator is a mixture of diethylaluminum chloride and tri-n-hexylaluminum.
      <br/>
      If it is desired to use an activator, about 0.10 to about 10 moles, and preferably about 0.15 to about 2.5 moles, of activator can be used per mole of electron donor.
      <br/>
      The molar ratio of activator to titanium can be in the range of about 1:1 to about 10:1 and is preferably in the range of about 2:1 to about 5:1.
    </p>
    <p num="24">
      The cocatalyst, generally a hydrocarbyl aluminum cocatalyst, can be represented by the formula R3 Al or R2 AlX wherein each R is independently alkyl, cycloalkyl, aryl, or hydrogen; at least one R is hydrocarbyl; and two or three R radicals can be joined to form a heterocyclic structure.
      <br/>
      Each R, which is a hydrocarbyl radical, can have 1 to 20 carbon atoms, and preferably has 1 to 10 carbon atoms.
      <br/>
      X is a halogen, preferably chlorine, bromine, or iodine.
      <br/>
      Examples of hydrocarbyl aluminum compounds are as follows: triisobutylaluminum, tri-n-hexylaluminum, di-isobutyl-aluminum hydride, dihexylaluminum hydride, di-isobutyl-hexylaluminum, isobutyl dihexylaluminum, trimethylaluminum, triethylaluminum, tripropylaluminum, triisopropylaluminum, tri-n-butylaluminum, trioctylaluminum, tridecylaluminum, tridodecylaluminum, tribenzylaluminum, triphenylaluminum, trinaphthylaluminum, tritolylaluminum, dibutylaluminum chloride, diethylaluminum chloride, diisobutylaluminum chloride, and ethylaluminum sesquichloride.
      <br/>
      The cocatalyst compounds can also serve as activators and modifiers.
    </p>
    <p num="25">
      It is unexpectedly found that by using different cocatalysts in each reactor, the benefits provided by both cocatalysts can be obtained.
      <br/>
      For example, trimethylaluminum (TMA) is shown to improve film strength characteristics and reduce hexane extractables, but is accompanied by continuity problems, while triethylaluminum (TEAL) solves the continuity problems, i.e., reactor breakdown.
      <br/>
      Surprisingly, the omission of a cocatalyst in the second reactor also reduces continuity problems.
      <br/>
      It is preferred that TMA be used in the first reactor and TEAL be used in the second reactor.
    </p>
    <p num="26">Preferred cocatalyst combinations are as follows:</p>
    <p num="27">
      --
      <br/>
      -- first reactor                second reactor
      <br/>
      -- trimethylaluminum (TMA)      triethylaluminum (TEAL)
      <br/>
      -- trimethylaluminum (TMA)      none
      <br/>
      -- diethylaluminum chloride (DEAC) tri-n-hexylaluminum (TnHAL)
      <br/>
      -- diisobutylaluminum chloride  triisobutylaluminum (TIBA)
      <br/>
      -- (DIBAC)
    </p>
    <p num="28">
      It is preferred not to use a support.
      <br/>
      However, in those cases where it is desired to support the precursor, silica is the preferred support.
      <br/>
      Other suitable supports are inorganic oxides such as aluminum phosphate, alumina, silica/alumina mixtures, silica modified with an organoaluminum compound such as triethylaluminum, and silica modified with diethyl zinc.
      <br/>
      A typical support is a solid, particulate, porous material essentially inert to the polymerization.
      <br/>

      Impregnation of the above mentioned catalyst precursor into a silica support can be accomplished by mixing the precursor and silica gel in the electron donor solvent or other solvent followed by solvent removal under reduced pressure.

      Where a modifier is used instead of an activator, the modifiers are usually dissolved in an organic solvent such as isopentane and, where a support is used, impregnated into the support following impregnation of the titanium compound or complex, after which the supported catalyst precursor is dried.
