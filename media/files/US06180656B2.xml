      The new and known compounds of the general formula (I) to be used according to the invention exhibit an unforeseeable, valuable spectrum of pharmacological action.

      To determine the cardiovascular action, the following investigations were carried out: in in vitro investigations on cells of vascular origin, the influence on guanylate cyclase-dependent cGMP formation was tested with and without NO donors.
      <br/>

      The hypotensive action was investigated in anaesthetized rats.

      For the investigations, the cells were passaged, inoculated into cell culture plates and subcultured until confluence was achieved.
      <br/>
      To stimulate the endothelial guanylate cyclase, the culture medium was aspirated and the cells were washed once with Ringer's solution and incubated in stimulation buffer with or without NO donor (sodium nitroprusside, SNP, 1  MU M).
      <br/>
      Following this, the test substances (final concentration 1  MU M) were then pipetted onto the cells.
      <br/>
      After the end of the incubation time of 10 minutes, the buffer solution was aspirated and the cells were lysed at -20 (degree)  C. for 16 hours.

      The intracellular cGMP was then determined radioimmunologically.
