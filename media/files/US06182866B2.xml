      <br/>
      The manually operated dispensing device comprises a friction brake acting upon a thrust rod.
      <br/>
      The friction brake consists of a brake spring comprising a loop portion having a radius, and an attached clamping portion having two legs for receiving between them a web extending on the thrust rod in lengthwise direction and normally to the toothing plane of the thrust rod.
      <br/>
      One of the legs is straight-lined whereas the other leg is curved or angularly bent from the loop portion.
      <br/>
      In this way, the brake spring is asymmetric with respect to its longitudinal axis, and the straight-lines portion acts for lining up the toothing of the thrust rod to the toothing of a drive member.
      <br/>
      Such a friction brake which consists of a spring only, can be manufactured and mounted in a simple and low-cost manner and aligns nevertheless the thrust rod in an efficient way.

    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="1">
      1.
      <br/>
      Field of the Invention
    </p>
    <p num="2">
      The present invention refers to a manually operated dispensing device for cartridges, comprising a friction brake acting upon a thrust rod, said friction brake having a brake spring which frictionally acts upon the thrust rod.
      <br/>
      The latter comprises a toothing coacting with a corresponding toothing of a drive member.
    </p>
    <p num="3">
      The first and major task of friction brakes is to allow a relief stroke of the thrust rod after each advance stroke, said relief stroke being dictated by the relief of the flexible cartridges.
      <br/>
      That is, the friction brake should not substantially hinder the thrust rod but efficiently neutralize the trailing force being created by the drive member during grip regain and acting upon the thrust rod.
      <br/>
      Whereas the thrust rod, or the thrust rods in the case of a two-component cartridge, is guided during the advance motion by being in meshing engagement with the drive member, there is a risk during grip regain that the thrust rod is pushed somewhat offset, and the precise meshing with the teeth of the drive members is no longer guaranteed.
    </p>
    <p num="4">2. Description of the Prior Art</p>
    <p num="5">
      A dispensing device such as mentioned above has already become known from U.S. Pat. No. 4,826,053 to the same Applicant.
      <br/>
      The friction brake which has been disclosed in that document is composed of many single parts which occupy a rather great space and do not allow an alignment.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      The document EP-A-0,791,404, to the same Applicant too, discloses a simplified friction brake which consists of an omega shaped spring only.
      <br/>
      It has turned out, however, that such an omega shaped spring is difficult to be adjusted to the dimensions of the thrust rod and, moreover, does not align the thrust rod.
    </p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="7">
      Starting from this prior art, it is an object of the present invention to provide a manually operated dispensing device comprising a friction brake that does not exhibit the above discussed drawbacks and that contains a low-cost friction brake which efficiently holds the thrust rod in position during grip regain and which aligns moreover the thrust rod, or double thrust rod in case of two-component cartridges, in such a way that the toothing of the drive member can perfectly mesh with the toothing of the thrust rod during grip regain.
      <br/>
      These objects are attained by a manually operated dispensing device of the above depicted kind wherein both the brake spring that acts as a friction brake and also the housing of the device comprise means for lining up the toothing of the thrust rod with the toothing of the drive member.
      <br/>
      Other advantages and features will be defined in the description of embodiments below and in the dependent claims.

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="9">
      In the present application, only those parts of the dispensing device are described that are necessary for understanding the new friction brake, its functions and its effects.
      <br/>
      As to the other parts and the functional features of the dispensing device, see the above mentioned document EP-A-0,791,404 which is incorporated by reference into the present document.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      FIGS. 1 and 2 show a portion of the housing 1 which essentially consists of the housing body 2 and the cover 3.
      <br/>
      Further, the double thrust rod 4 can be distinguished which is called in the following "thrust rod" only since it is not essential for this invention whether the thrust rod is a single or a double one.
      <br/>
      The thrust rod 4 carries thrust plates 5 and 6 which may have the same cross sectional area or, for cartridges having different volumes or cross sectional areas, respectively, different cross section areas.
      <br/>
      In the present description, the notion "front" or "frontal" refers to the thrust plate end, and "rear" or "posterior" to the other, free end of the thrust rod.
    </p>
    <p num="11">
      The thrust rod 4 which is represented has a tongue 7 at its rear end (see FIG. 6) to allow its manually operated retraction when a cartridge is to be changed.
      <br/>
      The thrust rod 4 further contains a toothing 8, see also FIG. 6, which is engaged by a catch 10 of a drive member 11 provided with a toothing 6.
      <br/>
      Further, FIG. 6 shows the fulcrum 12 of the drive member as well as the lever 13 for pivoting the drive member and disengage the teeth and to enable in this manner the retracting movement of the thrust rod.
    </p>
    <p num="12">
      A precise guidance of the thrust rods and an exact meshing of the teeth of the drive member with those of the thrust rods is important for the perfect functioning of the advance and of the relief path as well as of the regain grip.
      <br/>
      In a first approximation, this guidance is accomplished in that the thrust rods comprise webs 14 and 15 which extend lengthwise of the thrust rod and are normal to the plane 8E on which the toothing 8 is disposed, and that these webs are guided in correspondingly shaped guide portions within the housing; corresponding rear guide portions 16 and 17 as well as front guide portions 18 and 19 being shown in FIG. 1.
      <br/>
      As it will be understood from the following description and the functioning of the friction brake, it is important that at least one thrust rod comprises at least one web that is directed upward, namely towards the cover of the housing.
    </p>
    <p num="13">
      If a precise guidance should be effected with these measures alone, the guiding grooves or slots as well as the webs on the thrust rods would have to be realized in a very exact manner and with only very small tolerances.
      <br/>
      Such small tolerances are however not possible in the large scale manufacturing of these products.
      <br/>
      Now, it has been found that it is possible not only to meet all requirements an effective friction brake calls for, but also to bring about an exact guidance of the thrust rod, be it a single one or a double thrust rod.
    </p>
    <p num="14">
      FIGS. 1 to 5B show a friction brake which is shaped as a brake spring 20 and not only performs all functions of a friction brake but also precisely guides the thrust rod when the teeth of the drive member must anew be engaged.
      <br/>
      According to FIG. 3, the spring 20 essentially consists of a loop portion 21 having a radius R, and a clamp and line-up portion attached thereto and comprising the legs 22 and 23.
      <br/>
      As it can best be seen in FIGS. 1 and 5, one leg 22 is straight whereas the other leg 23 is curved or bent so that the whole spring is asymmetrical with respect to its longitudinal axis.
      <br/>
      The straight leg 22 further comprises an oblong hole 24 for safety and path limiting purposes.
    </p>
    <p num="15">
      By this special spring design, it is achieved, on one hand, that the thrust rod or its web, respectively, in the present Example web 15 (FIG. 1), is always linearly lined up and is pressed against both outer edges 25 and 26 of the rear guide 17 and the front guide 19, respectively.
      <br/>
      On the other hand, the shape of the loop portion allows a precise adjustment of the spring force by changing the value of the radius R, and by selecting the material thickness and nature.
    </p>
    <p num="16">The aligned position according to FIG. 1 corresponds to the thrust rod position of FIG. 5A where it is indicated that the web 15 of the thrust rod contacts the edges 25 and 26 of the guides 17 and 19, respectively.</p>
    <p num="17">
      In the present embodiment, the spring is fixed to the cover of the housing, the spring being disposed at the inner surface of the outer wall 27 of the cover, and is clamped between the inner face of the outer wall and a guide web 28 extending in a distance from said wall.
      <br/>
      The guide web serves for precisely aligning the straight leg 22 of the brake spring, the two guide edges 25 and 26 being in the same plane together with the stop surface 29 of the guide web 28, said surface facing the outer wall of the cover 27.
      <br/>
      The height of the guide web roughly corresponds to the height of the step 30 of the brake spring, see FIG. 3, so that the web 15 slides beneath the guide web 28.
      <br/>
      It goes without saying that the guide web 28 is somewhat thinner than the web 15 which is thus efficiently pinched by the spring.
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      Two limit stops for the brake spring are provided at the inner surface of the outer wall 27, namely a front stop 31 and a rear stop 32.
      <br/>
      The path along which the brake spring recedes and which is defined as a free relief path is referenced as B in FIG. 1.
      <br/>
      A pin (not shown) which traverses the outer wall 27 and the oblong hole 24 and which further limits the free relief path is provided for securing the brake spring so that the latter is secured but remains displaceable in lengthwise direction over a predetermined path.
    </p>
    <p num="19">In the following, the functioning of the friction brake according to the invention will be described.</p>
    <p num="20">
      Under charge, i.e. during dispensing, the thrust rod remains aligned with respect to the housing, even if different forces are applied to the thrust rod; this is in particular the case with a double thrust rod when the ratio of the cartridge volumes of the cross section ratio, respectively, deviates from a 1:1 ratio and is for example 1:4 or 1:10: the saw tooth like engagement by the drive member aligns the thrust rod to the catch of the drive member which has a small play only.
      <br/>
      During the relief path and the grip regain stroke by the catch, however, this alignment is no longer present since different forces or friction conditions may provoke a lateral displacement or an inclination of the thrust rod as it is shown in FIG. 5B.
    </p>
    <p num="21">
      After the end of the regain stroke, the somewhat tensed brake spring aligns the thrust rod again to the front and rear edges 25 and 26 of the guide portions whereas the straight leg 22 of the spring is lined up to the stop surface 29 of the guide web where it abuts.
      <br/>
      The result is that, during the regain grip and at the beginning of the dispensing stroke, the toothing of the thrust rod and the catch teeth are precisely aligned to each other, and the catch will not get caught during the engaging step by improper tooth engagement which could damage the toothing of the thrust rod and the catch and create cracking noise.
    </p>
    <p num="22">
      It follows from the above description that the alignment of the thrust rod by the brake spring of the invention is performed by the brake spring alone in a perfect manner, and the part and mounting costs can strongly be reduced which is essential with large scale manufacture.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, the thrust rod has only a very small friction with respect to the housing.
      <br/>
      This effect is favorable for the relief of the cartridge.
    </p>
    <p num="23">
      The brake spring of the invention has been described by means of an example of a double cartridge where it is of particular usefulness since the brake spring needs to act on one web of the thrust rod only for aligning the whole thrust rod, namely the double thrust rod; it is irrelevant whether the thrust plates of the thrust rod express cartridges having a cross section ratio of 1:1 or a different one until a ratio of 1:10.
      <br/>
      The brake spring of the invention may however also be used in dispensing devices having only one thrust rod.
