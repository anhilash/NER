    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">The present invention relates to office partition panel systems, and in particular to a flexible light seal for office partitions and the like.</p>
    <p num="3">
      The efficient use of building floor space is an ever growing concern, particularly as building costs continue to escalate.
      <br/>
      Open office plans have been developed to reduce overall officing costs, and generally incorporate large, open floor spaces in buildings that are equipped with modular furniture systems which are readily reconfigurable to accommodate the ever changing needs of a specific user, as well as the divergent requirements of different tenants.
      <br/>
      One arrangement commonly used for furnishing open plans includes movable or portable partition panels that are detachably interconnected to partition off the open spaces into individual workstations and/or offices.
      <br/>
      Such partition panels have sufficient structural strength to receive hang-on furniture units, such as work surfaces, overhead cabinets, shelves, etc., and are generally known in the office furniture industry as "systems furniture." In addition, such partition panels have an acoustical, sound-absorbing configuration to promote a quiet, pleasant work environment.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      Numerous partition panel systems have been developed for dividing office workspaces into smaller areas.
      <br/>
      Partition panel systems, like those disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,996,811, utilize prefabricated rectangular partition panel members that have a unitary rigid perimeter frame formed by top, bottom, and end channels that are welded to one another.
      <br/>
      Decorative cover panels are fastened to opposite sides of the perimeter frame.
      <br/>
      Each perimeter frame member has a rectangular shape, and is fabricated and shipped as a single unit, often with the decorative cover panels pre-fastened to the frame.
      <br/>
      During installation, the prefabricated perimeter frame of each panel member is fastened to the perimeter frame of an adjacent panel member along the vertical edges thereof, either directly, or by a separate fastener post.
      <br/>
      Each partition panel member includes two height adjustable feet or glides along the bottom edge of each panel member, with one glide being located adjacent each vertical panel edge.
      <br/>
      Since there are two vertical frame members at each panel joint, this type of panel construction results in structural redundancy.
      <br/>
      In addition, since each glide must be properly adjusted for height, this configuration requires adjustment of both glides at each panel joint during assembly.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, although longer panels typically have a lower cost per unit length, longer panels are difficult to handle, which places a practical limit on the size of the partition panel member that can be shipped and installed as a prefabricated unit.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      Other partition panel systems, like that disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,150,554, utilize prefabricated rectangular partition panel members having a unitary perimeter frame that attaches to a post member along each vertical panel edge.
      <br/>
      Although this type of design may have a single glide at each post, each panel-to-post connection has at least two vertical structural members.
      <br/>
      Since only a single vertical member is needed to provide support and height adjustment, this type of system has redundant structure.
      <br/>
      In addition, the rectangular partition panel members are manufactured and shipped as a unit, limiting the size of the partition panel members that can be used.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      Other office divider systems, like that disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,406,760, utilize vertical posts and horizontal beams wherein each post attaches to an adjacent post along adjacent vertical edges.
      <br/>
      Since each post is attached directly to an adjacent post, this configuration also has redundant vertical structural members and glides.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      Other office panel dividers, like that disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,287,666 and 5,219,406, have multiple posts and beams with connector members that hold a pair of beams to adjacent posts.
      <br/>
      This arrangement has two horizontal beams in a side-by-side relationship at each height location, and also has two vertical posts attached directly together in either a back-to-back or side-by-side relationship.
      <br/>
      Thus, there is redundancy in both the post and the beam structures.
      <br/>
      In addition, connector pieces are required to attach the beams to the posts.
    </p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="8">
      One aspect of the present invention is to provide a knock-down portable partition including a panel frame having a central portion.
      <br/>
      At least one cover panel covers at least a portion of the central portion of the panel frame.
      <br/>
      Connectors detachably mount the cover panel on the panel frame to facilitate assembly and removable of the cover panel on the panel frame.
      <br/>
      The panel frame includes at least two vertical posts each having an upper end, a lower end and opposite faces with at least two beam connection ports thereon positioned adjacent the upper and lower ends of the associated one of the posts.
      <br/>
      The panel frame also includes upper and lower beams extending generally horizontally between the vertical posts adjacent the upper and lower ends thereof, and interconnecting the same adjacent the connection ports.
      <br/>
      Movable lock members having a flexible extension are positioned on one of the posts and the beams adjacent the connection ports, and are movably mounted thereon for shifting between an unlocked position and a locked position.
      <br/>
      The panel frame further includes lock-engaging surfaces positioned on the other of the posts and the beams adjacent the connection ports.
      <br/>
      The lock-engaging surfaces are located thereon to engage the flexible extensions when the lock members are shifted to the locked position to rigidly yet detachably interconnect the posts and the beams for quick and complete assembly and disassembly of the knock-down portable partition.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      Yet another aspect of the present invention is a portable partition system, the improvement of a knock-down frame construction including at least two vertical posts each having at least two beam connection ports positioned in a vertically spaced-apart relationship on an associated one of the posts.
      <br/>
      Upper and lower beams extend generally horizontally between the vertical posts, and interconnect the same adjacent the connection ports.
      <br/>
      Movable lock members are positioned on one of the posts and the beams adjacent the connection ports, and are movably mounted thereon for shifting between an unlocked position and a locked position.
      <br/>
      The lock members include flexible extensions.
      <br/>
      Lock-engaging surfaces are positioned on the other of the posts and the beams adjacent the connection ports, and are located thereon to engage the flexible extensions when the lock members are shifted to the locked position to rigidly yet detachably interconnect the posts and the beams for quick and complete assembly and disassembly of the knock-down portable partition.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      Yet another aspect of the present invention is a partition including at least two vertical posts.
      <br/>
      The partition includes upper and lower beams having opposite ends thereof interconnecting the vertical posts to define when in an assembled condition, a rigid panel frame having a substantially open interior.
      <br/>
      The panel frame defines a vertical dimension.
      <br/>
      At least one cover panel is configured to enclose at least a portion of the open interior of the panel frame, and is removably mounted on the panel frame to readily access the open interior thereof.
      <br/>
      The cover panel defines an interior surface and a center portion spaced-apart from the posts.
      <br/>
      A cover panel brace is connected with the upper beam, and has an outer surface abutting the interior surface of the cover panel to support the cover panel adjacent the center portion to prevent flexing of the cover panel.
      <br/>
      The cover panel brace is longitudinally extensible to accommodate variations of the vertical dimension between the upper and lower beams.
    </p>
    <p num="11">
      Yet another aspect of the present invention is a cover panel brace including an upper member having a connector configured to detachably connect the upper member to a partition frame.
      <br/>
      The cover panel brace also includes a lower member interconnected with the upper member.
      <br/>
      The upper and lower members define a vertical length corresponding to the vertical dimension of a partition frame.
      <br/>
      The brace is adapted to extend downwardly when installed on a partition frame to support a cover panel installed over the brace and prevent flexing of a center portion thereof.
      <br/>
      The upper and lower members are longitudinally extensible to adjust the vertical length to account for variations in the vertical dimension of the partition frame.
    </p>
    <p num="12">
      Yet another aspect of the present invention is a panel frame member defining an inner surface and having a sidewall with a row of slots therethrough for receiving support hooks of hang-on accessory units.
      <br/>
      The panel frame member includes a flexible light seal having a base portion fixed to the inner surface adjacent at least one of the slots.
      <br/>
      The light seal includes a flap connected to the base portion and extending over the slot to block light passage through the slot.
      <br/>
      The flap flexes inwardly upon insertion of a support hook to permit installation of a hang-on accessory unit.

      The panel frame member includes a light seal that is fixed to the inner surface, and extends over the slots and prevents light passage through the slots.
    </p>
    <p num="14">
      The principal objects of the present invention are to provide a knock-down, portable partition system.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, the present partition provides a versatile, easily assembled and disassembled partition having reduced complexity and fewer components.
      <br/>
      The individual components are assembled at the installation site, thereby reducing shipping costs, and allowing for larger, more economical panel sizes.
      <br/>
      The partition panel is easily and quickly assembled, and does not require separate fasteners, such as conventional nuts and bolts.
      <br/>
      The partition panels have sufficient structural strength to support hang-on accessory units, such as binder bins, shelves, and work surfaces.
      <br/>
      Utility troughs may be installed at various heights between the posts to provide for electrical and communications conduits.
      <br/>
      The utility troughs may be installed or removed after the structural beams are installed between adjacent posts.
      <br/>
      Each post has a single adjustable foot, and a vertical row of slots for support of hang-on accessory units.
      <br/>
      Cover panels are installed to close off the open interior of the panel.
      <br/>
      Two adjacent cover panels are attached to a single post at each in-line panel joint.

      <br/>
      Hence, specific dimensions and other physical characteristics relating to the embodiments disclosed herein are not to be considered as limiting, unless the claims expressly state otherwise.
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      The reference numeral 1 (FIG. 1) generally designates a knock-down portable partition system embodying the present invention.
      <br/>
      The illustrated knock-down portable partition system 1 has a panel frame 2 (see also FIGS. 2, 3) with a central portion 3.
      <br/>
      At least one cover panel 4 covers at least a portion of the central portion 3 of the panel frame 2.
      <br/>
      Connectors 5 detachably mount the cover panel 4 on the panel frame 2 to facilitate assembly and removal of the cover panel 4 on the panel frame 2.
      <br/>
      The panel frame 2 includes at least two vertical posts 6 each having an upper end 7, a lower end 8, and opposite faces 9 with at least two beam connection ports 10 thereon positioned adjacent the upper and lower ends 7, 8 of the associated one of the posts 6.

      As described in more detail below, front faces 32 of each post 6 include apertures 45 that receive connectors 5 for mounting cover panels 4.
      <br/>
      Each of the posts 6 have a single, vertically adjustable foot 46 with threaded portion 47 that is received in a threaded plate 48 welded to the lower end 8 of the post 6 (FIG. 13).
      <br/>
      As also described in more detail below, front face 32 of post 6 includes apertures 49 near the lower end 8 that removably mount a base cover 50. (See also FIG. 25).
      <br/>
      Posts 6 are made from a larger U-shaped piece 51 and a smaller U-shaped piece 52, each of which is roll-formed from sheet metal.
      <br/>
      The larger and smaller U-shaped pieces 51 and 55 are welded together along overlapping edge portions 45.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, posts 6 could have a one-piece, roll-formed tubular construction.

      With reference to FIGS. 14-16, each beam 11 has a movable lock member 12 that is rotatably mounted to the lower side 55 of the beam 11 by a rivet 56.
      <br/>
      The beam 11 includes four tabs 57 and slots 54 that form downwardly extending hooks 58 at each end.
      <br/>
      Hooks 58 are formed on U-shaped end insert 74 that is spot welded to the sidewalls 70 of the beam 11 at 75.
      <br/>
      The insert 74 and hooks 58 are fabricated from a thicker sheet metal material than beam 11 to provide additional strength.
      <br/>
      Hooks 58 are received in vertical slots 41 of the beam connection port 10.
      <br/>
      Slots 59 of hooks 58 engage bottom edges 60 of vertical slots 40 (FIG. 4).
      <br/>
      Slots 59 have tapered, or angled side edges such that the width of the slot 59 is greater at the opening than at the base, or vertex 54.
      <br/>
      The taper of slot 59 ensures that beam 11 is securely and rigidly interconnected with post 6 when assembled.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, vertical slots 41 in posts 6 have tapered, or angled side edges such that top edge 71 is wider than bottom edge 60.
      <br/>
      Top edge 71 is 0.165 inches, and bottom edge 60 is 0.115 inches.
      <br/>
      Slots 41 are 1.100 inches high, and the side edges are parallel (i.e., 0.165 inches apart) along the upper 0.800 inch portion of slot 41.
      <br/>
      The side edges taper inwardly to the 0.115 inch bottom edge 60 starting at a point 0.300 inches from bottom edge 60.
      <br/>
      The taper of slots 59 further ensures that beam 11 is securely and rigidly interconnected with post 6 when assembled.
      <br/>
      Hooks 58 have a thickness that is approximately the same as the width of slot 41 at the bottom edge 60.
      <br/>
      Hooks 58 may also be slightly thicker or thinner than bottom edge 60 of slot 41.
      <br/>
      Base 54 of slot 59 is approximately the same width as the thickness of the sidewall of post 6.
      <br/>
      Base 54 can also be slightly wider or narrower than the thickness of the sidewall of post 6.
      <br/>
      The taper of slots 41 and 59 provide a snug wedging fit, ensuring that beam 11 rigidly and securely interconnects with posts 6.
      <br/>
      If hooks 58 are wider than lower edge 60 of slots 41, and/or base 54 of slot 59 is narrower than the thickness of the sidewall of posts 6, a downward force on beam 11 is required to seat hooks 58 in slots 41.
      <br/>
      A rubber mallet or other suitable tool can be used to quickly and easily seat hooks 58 in slots 41.

      Lock member 12 is formed from sheet metal, and includes a flat body portion 61 that forms a lever arm for mechanical advantage such that the lock members 12 can be grasped and manually shifted from the unlocked position to the locked position by a person without the use of tools.
      <br/>
      An upwardly turned flange 62 provides a surface for a person to push against for manually rotating the locking member 12 in the direction of the arrow "A" (FIG. 4) to shift the lock member 12 to the locked position.
      <br/>
      Each locking member 12 also includes a downwardly-extending flange 63 that provides a flat surface to push against to rotate locking member 12 to the unlocked position.
    </p>
    <p num="26">
      Each locking member 12 includes a flexible extension 13 (FIG. 14) having a curved outer edge 64.
      <br/>
      The flexible extension 13 is formed by cutting or separating the sheet metal along a line 67 to hole 65, thereby forming a base portion 66 of the flexible extension 13.
      <br/>
      Flexible extension 13 is thereby cantilevered to the body portion 61 of the locking member 12, such that flexible extension 13 is progressively flexed downwardly as extension 13 engages the lock-engaging surface 16 of post 6 during rotation of lock member 12 (see also FIG. 6).
      <br/>
      The elastic deformation of flexible extension 13 generates a force that pulls the hooks 58 downwardly into engagement with the slots 41, thereby securely locking each end of the beam 11 to the posts 6 and preventing upward movement and disengagement of hooks 58.
    </p>
    <p num="27">
      Each beam 11 may be made from an upper U-shaped piece 68 and a lower U-shaped piece 69 which are welded together along overlapping flange portion 30.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, beam 11 may have a one-piece tubular construction fabricated from sheet metal using a roll-forming process.
      <br/>
      Each beam 11 may include rectangular windows 62 and circular windows 122 through the beam 11 for vertical routing of data or power lines 23, 24 through the beams 11 within the panel frame 2.
      <br/>
      The area between hooks 58 is cut-out at 76.
      <br/>
      To remove a beam 11 from between a pair of posts 6, lock member 12 is shifted to the disengaged position, and beam 11 is shifted upwardly to disengage slots 59 from the bottom edge 60 of slots 41.
      <br/>
      A small pry bar or other suitable tool is then inserted into the opening between the posts 6 and the beam 11 created by the cut-out 76, and the posts 6 and beam 11 are pried apart, such that adjacent panel frames 2 are shifted slightly and hooks 58 disengage from the beam connection ports 10.
    </p>
    <p num="28">
      Beams 11 are installed by ensuring that locking members 12 are rotated to the disengaged, unlocked position.
      <br/>
      Hooks 58 at a first end of beam 11 are then inserted into slots 41 of a post 6 to position beam 11 at a desired vertical location.
      <br/>
      The first end of beam 11 is then shifted downwardly to engage slots 59 with bottom edges 60 of slots 41.
      <br/>
      Locking member 12 is then rotated to the locked position such that flexible extension 13 engages lock-engaging surface 16 to securely and rigidly interconnect beam 11 and post 6.
      <br/>
      A second end of beam 11 is then connected to another post 6 in the manner just described.

      Beam 11 (as well as data and power troughs 30, 31) can be installed and removed from between a pair of posts 6 along a mid point of an assembled partition without disassembly of adjacent panel frames.
      <br/>
      To install a beam 11 between assembled panel frames, beam 11 is angled upwardly (or horizontally outwardly), and hooks 58 at a first end of beam 11 are inserted into slots 41 of a post 6.
      <br/>
      A second end of beam 11 is rotated downwardly (or horizontally inwardly), and hooks 58 at the second end of beam 11 are inserted into slots 41 of another post 6.

      Two types of utility troughs may be utilized for routing of data and power lines 27, 28.
      <br/>
      A data trough 30 is illustrated in FIGS. 17-19, and a power trough 31 is illustrated in FIGS. 20-22. Either trough may be used for routing of data or power lines 27, 28 within the trough.
      <br/>
      However, as discussed below, power trough 31 includes a lock such as sliding wedge 103 that rigidly connects the ends of the power trough 76 to the posts 6.
      <br/>
      Side forces are generated when a user plugs in or disconnects electrical lines from power boxes 40.
      <br/>
      The locking arrangement of power trough 76 permits mounting of power boxes 40 and power lines 28 below the power trough 31.
    </p>
    <p num="31">
      With reference to FIG. 19, each data trough 30 has a U-shaped cross-sectional shape with a bottom wall 86 and upwardly-extending side walls 85 that include a folded-over top edge 87 for strength.
      <br/>
      Each data trough 30 includes rectangular cut-out portions 94 and clearance holes 96 in side walls 85 for mounting data receptacles 39, and rectangular apertures 95 through bottom wall 86 for vertical routing of data and power lines 27, 28 within the panel frame 2.
      <br/>
      Each data trough 30 also includes a pair of tabs 88 (FIG. 17) and a slot 89 forming a downwardly extending hook at a first end 90.
      <br/>
      At a second end 91, the data trough 30 has a pair of tabs 92 with a cut-back portion 93.
      <br/>
      Cut-back portion 93 provides clearance when the first end 90 of the data trough is tipped upward in the direction of the arrow "E" (FIG. 17) during removal and installation of the data trough 30 between a pair of posts 6 when the panel frame 2 is assembled (FIG. 3).
    </p>
    <p num="32">
      With reference to FIGS. 20-22, each power trough 31 has a generally U-shaped cross-sectional shape, and includes cut-out portions 97 along the side walls 98 for mounting data receptacles 39 (FIG. 3).
      <br/>
      Each side wall 98 of the power trough 31 includes openings 104 that receive barbed extensions 105 of a power box 40 (FIG. 3), for removably mounting power box 40 below the power trough 31.
      <br/>
      A first end 99 of power trough 31 includes an upwardly-opening U-shaped tab 100 which is received in a U-shaped slot 101 (FIG. 8) of a utility trough port 25.
      <br/>
      A second end 102 end of power trough 31 includes a movable lock member such as sliding wedge 103.
      <br/>
      Wedge 103 is moved in the direction of the arrow "D" of FIG. 20 after tabs 113 are positioned in slots 115 of utility trough port 25, thereby providing a secure connection that prevents movement of the power trough 31 when an electrical line is plugged into the power receptacle 40.
      <br/>
      Extension 106 of wedge 103 is closely received within the U-shaped slot 101, and a downwardly-extending grip or handle portion 107 that enables a user to slide the wedge 103 as required during installation or removal of the power trough 31.
      <br/>
      Power trough 31 includes a bottom wall 108 (FIG. 22), and a pair of smaller, offset lower side walls 109.
      <br/>
      Each lower side wall 109 includes a slot 110 adjacent the second end 102 of the power trough 31.
      <br/>
      Sliding wedge 103 includes support tabs 111 and 112 that are received within the slots 110 to slidably mount the wedge 103.
      <br/>
      When the sliding wedge 103 is inserted into the U-shaped slot 101, the upper surface 117 of the sliding wedge 103 contacts the upper edge 116 of the U-shaped slot 101, thereby generating a downward force on the second end 102 of the power trough 31.
      <br/>
      The downward force generated by the sliding wedge 103 insures that the slots 114 securely and rigidly engage the lower edge 118 of the tapered slots 115.
      <br/>
      Slots 114 of tabs 113 as well as slots 115 could be tapered to ensure that power trough 31 is rigidly interconnected with posts 6 when assembled.
      <br/>
      In this configuration, slots 114 have a wider opening than base portion, and slots 115 are wider at upper edge 121 than lower edge 118 (see also FIG. 8).

    <p num="46">
      Another type of flexible light seal 191 (FIG. 39) is used to cover vertical rows of slots 17 of an end-of-run post 6.
      <br/>
      Adhesive 193 is applied to the base portion 196, and flap 195 extends over the adjacent rows of slots 17.
      <br/>
      Light seal 191 may be scored at 192 such that flap 195 flexes along score line 192 upon insertion of hooks 21 or arm 138 of clips 130.
      <br/>
      After the adhesive 193 is applied to the inner surface 194 of a light seal 190 or 191, the light seal is inserted into the post with the adhesive facing upwardly.
      <br/>
      The light seal 190 or 191 is then turned over, and positioned with the flap or flaps 195 over the vertical rows of slots 17.
      <br/>
      Force is then applied to the light seal 190 or 191 to securely bond the light seal to the inner surface of the post.

      With reference to FIGS. 40 and 41, a longitudinally extensible cover panel brace 200 includes an upper member 201 and a lower member 202.
      <br/>
      Upper and lower members 201, 202 include vertically elongated main sections 203 and 204 having a U-shaped cross section with side flanges 205 and 206.
      <br/>
      Elongated section 203 of upper member 201 fits within the elongated section 204 of the lower member 202, and a tab 207 adjacent the lower end 208 of upper member 201 is received within a selected opening 209 in lower member 202.
      <br/>
      A screw or other fastener 210 fits through a selected clearance hole 211 in upper member 201, and is received within threaded opening 212 in lower member 202.
      <br/>
      Upper member 201 includes a downwardly-opening hook-shaped extension 213 that fits over a beam 11 when the cover panel brace 200 is installed on the panel frame 2.
      <br/>
      Lower hook-shaped extension 214 permits lower member 202 to hang from a beam 11 for the lowest height panel frame 2.
    </p>
    <p num="48">
      Posts 6 may have different heights, such that the height of panel frame 2 varies.
      <br/>
      To accommodate variations in panel height, the cover panel brace 200 can be adjusted by inserting the tab 207 into the selected opening 209 to change the vertical length of cover panel brace 200 to correspond to the height of the panel frame 2.
      <br/>
      After the cover panel brace 200 is adjusted to the correct length, hook-shaped extension 213 is placed over a beam 11, such that the cover panel brace 200 hangs from the beam 11.
      <br/>
      The cover panels 4 are then installed over the cover race 200, with the rear surface 215 of the cover panel brace 200 abutting the inner surface 217 of the cover panel 4.
      <br/>
      Brace 200 is installed between a pair of posts to prevent excessive flexing of a center portion 216 of a cover panel 4 if a force is applied to the outer surface of the cover panel 4.
      <br/>
      Cover panel brace 200 is useful for relatively narrow, elongated, or "segmented" cover panels 4 (FIG. 2), particularly when the posts 6 are spaced-apart for wider panels, such as 72 inch wide panels.
      <br/>
      Cover panel brace 200 maintains the alignment between cover panels 4 along the horizontal joint 159 between adjacent cover panels.
      <br/>
      Although light block 154 (FIG. 26) will prevent a gap at horizontal joint 159 if a force is applied to the upper cover panel, if a cover panel brace 200 is not used, a force applied to the lower cover panel will cause the lower cover panel to flex inwardly, creating a gap at joint 159.
      <br/>
      Cover panel brace 200 prevents this misalignment and resulting gap at horizontal joint 159.
      <br/>
      A data or power trough 30, 31 is located at a mid-panel height to provide additional stiffness.
      <br/>
      Cover panel brace 200 abuts the mid-height data or power trough, thereby preventing inward flexing of cover panel brace 200.
    </p>
    <p num="49">
      If cover panels 4 have a construction requiring a thinner brace 200, elongated sections 203 and 204 can be constructed to have a flat cross-sectional shape.
      <br/>
      Hook-shaped extensions 213 and 214 are eliminated in this embodiment, and fasteners 219 are received in clearance holes 218 to secure cover panel brace 200 to the sides of beams 11.

    <p num="50">
      The knock-down portable partition system 1 of the present invention provides a flexible, easily shipped and assembled system having capability for handling a wide range of power and communications cabling needs.
      <br/>
      Panel frame 2 is simple and quickly assembled, yet provides sufficient structural strength for support of hang-on accessories such as binder bins 19, work surfaces 20, and lower file storage units 22.
      <br/>
      Each post utilizes a single foot for support, thereby simplifying the vertical adjustment of the panel frame 2.
      <br/>
      The beams 11 and the data and power troughs 30, 31 may be removed from between a pair of vertical posts while the adjacent panel frames 2 are in an assembled condition.
      <br/>
      Cover panels 4 are easily removed and installed and provide an acoustic, sound-absorbing layer.
