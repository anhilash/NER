    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">
      Radiation-sensitive materials, including light-sensitive materials, such as photographic materials, may utilize filter dyes for a variety of purposes.
      <br/>
      Filter dyes may be used to adjust the speed of a radiation-sensitive layer; they may be used as absorber dyes to increase image sharpness of a radiation-sensitive layer; they may be used as antihalation dyes to reduce halation; they may be used to reduce the amount or intensity of radiation from reaching one or more radiation-sensitive layers, and they may also be used to prevent radiation of a specific wavelength or range of wavelengths from reaching one or more of the radiation-sensitive layers in a radiation-sensitive element.
      <br/>
      For each of these uses, the filter dye(s) may be located in any number of layers of a radiation-sensitive element, depending on the specific requirements of the element and the dye, and on the manner in which the element is to be exposed.
      <br/>
      The amount of filter dyes used varies widely, but they are preferably present in amounts sufficient to alter in some way the response of the element to radiation.
      <br/>
      Filter dyes may be located in a layer above a radiation-sensitive layer, in a radiation-sensitive layer, in a layer below a radiation-sensitive layer, or in a layer on the opposite side of the support from a radiation-sensitive layer.
    </p>
    <p num="3">
      Photographic materials often contain layers sensitized to different regions of the spectrum, such as red, blue, green, ultraviolet, infrared, X-ray, to name a few.
      <br/>
      A typical color photographic element contains a layer sensitized to each of the three primary regions of the visible spectrum, i.e., blue, green, and red.
      <br/>
      Silver halide used in these materials has an intrinsic sensitivity to blue light.
      <br/>
      Increased sensitivity to blue light, along with sensitivity to green light or red light, is imparted through the use of various sensitizing dyes adsorbed to the silver halide grains.
      <br/>
      Sensitized silver halide retains its intrinsic sensitivity to blue light.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      There are numerous applications for which filtration or absorbance of very specific regions of light are highly desirable.
      <br/>
      Some of these applications, such as yellow filter dyes and magenta trimmer dyes, require non-diffusing dyes which may be coated in a layer-specific manner to prevent specific wavelengths of light from reaching specific layers of the film during exposure.
      <br/>
      These dyes must have sharp-cutting edges on the bathochromic (long-wavelength) side of the absorbance envelope to prevent light punch through without adversely affecting the speed of the underlying emulsions.
      <br/>
      In other applications, it is desirable to allow passage of light below a certain wavelength.
      <br/>
      In these cases it is desirable to have a dye which is very sharp-cutting on the hypsochromic (short-wavelength) edge of the absorbance envelope.
      <br/>
      Depending on the location of these filter layers relative to the sensitized silver halide emulsion layers, it would also be desirable to have non-diffusing, layer-specific filter dyes with absorption spectra which are sharp-cutting on the hypsochromic edge as well as the bathochromic edge.
      <br/>
      Such dyes are sometimes known as "finger filters".
      <br/>
      Preferably these dyes should exhibit high extinction coefficients, narrow halfbandwidths and sharp cutting hypsochromic and bathochromic absorption envelopes when incorporated into imaging elements including photographic elements.
      <br/>
      Typically, to achieve these properties, isotropic solutions of dyes have been incorporated.
      <br/>
      Dyes introduced by this method, however, often wander into adjacent layers causing problems such as speed loss or stain, and cannot be coated in a layer-specific manner without the use of mordants.
      <br/>
      Solubilized dyes may be mordanted to prevent wandering through adjacent layers.
      <br/>
      While the use of polymeric mordants can prevent dye wandering, such mordants aggravate the stain problem encountered when the dye remains in the element through processing.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      Dyes with a high extinction coefficient allow maximum light absorption using a minimum amount of dye.
      <br/>
      Lower requisite dye laydown reduces the cost of light filtration and produces fewer processing by-products.
      <br/>
      Lower dye laydowns may also result in reduced dye stain in short duration processes.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      Finger filters such as described above are highly desirable for other uses such as protecting silver halide sensitized emulsions from exposure by safelights.
      <br/>
      Such dyes must have absorbance spectra with high extinction coefficients and narrow halfbandwidths, and sharp cutting absorbance envelopes to efficiently absorb light in the narrow safelight-emitting region without adversely affecting the speed of the sensitized silver halide emulsions.
      <br/>
      This affords protection for the sensitized emulsion from exposure by light in the safelight's spectral region.
      <br/>
      Useful absorbance maxima for safelight dyes include, but are not restricted to 490-510 nm and 590-610 nm.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      Similar properties are required for infrared absorbing filter dyes.
      <br/>
      Laser-exposed radiation-sensitive elements require high efficiency light absorbance at the wavelength of laser emission.
      <br/>
      Unwanted absorbance from broadly absorbing dyes reduces the efficiency of light capture at the laser emission wavelength, and requires the use of larger amounts of dye to adequately cover the desired spectral region.
      <br/>
      In photographic elements, unwanted absorbance may also cause speed losses in adjacent silver halide sensitized layers if the photographic element has multiple sensitized layers present.
      <br/>
      Useful finger filter absorbance maxima for absorbing laser and phosphor emissions include but are not restricted to 950 nm, 880 nm, 830 nm, 790 nm, 633 nm, 670 nm, 545 nm and 488 nm.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      In some radiation sensitive elements, including dry process imaging films, it is necessary to provide light filtration or antihalation at deep cyan and infrared wavelengths.
      <br/>
      Typically such protection has been achieved using water or solvent soluble dyes or milled solid particle dyes.
      <br/>
      Typically, water-soluble dyes forming isotropic solutions can provide relatively sharp, high extinction absorbance, but are prone to interlayer wandering.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      One common use for filter dyes is in silver halide light sensitive photographic elements.
      <br/>
      If, prior to processing, blue light reaches a layer containing silver halide which has been sensitized to a region of the spectrum other than blue, the silver halide grains exposed to the blue light, by virtue of their intrinsic sensitivity to blue light, would be rendered developable.
      <br/>
      This would result in a false rendition of the image information being recorded in the photographic element.
      <br/>
      It is therefore a common practice to include in the photographic element a material that filters blue light.
      <br/>
      This blue-absorbing material can be located anywhere in the element where it is desirable to filter blue light.
      <br/>
      In a color photographic element that has layers sensitized to each of the primary colors, it is common to have the blue-sensitized layer closest to the exposure source and to interpose a blue-absorbing, or yellow filter layer between the blue-sensitized layer and the green- and red-sensitized layers.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      Another common use for filter dyes is to filter or trim portions of the UV, visible or infrared spectral regions to prevent unwanted wavelengths of light from reaching sensitized emulsions.
      <br/>
      Just as yellow filter dyes prevent false color rendition from the exposure of emulsions sensitized to a region of the spectrum other than blue, filter dyes absorbing in the UV, magenta, cyan and infrared spectral regions can prevent false color rendition by shielding sensitized emulsion layers from exposure to specific wavelength regions.
      <br/>
      One application of this strategy is the use of green-absorbing magenta trimmer dyes.
      <br/>
      In one type of typical color photographic element containing a layer sensitized to each of the three primary regions of the visible spectrum, i.e., blue, green, and red, the green-sensitized layer is coated above the red-sensitized layer and below the blue-sensitized layer.
      <br/>
      Depending on the chosen spectral sensitivity maxima for the sensitized silver halide layers, there may be a region of overlap between the spectral sensitivities of the green and red emulsions.
      <br/>
      Under such circumstances, green light which is not absorbed by the green-sensitive emulsion can punch through to the red sensitive emulsion and be absorbed by the leading edge of the red spectral sensitizing dye.
      <br/>
      This crosstalk between the green and red emulsions results in false color rendition.
      <br/>
      It would, therefore, be highly desirable to find a green-absorbing filter dye which upon incorporation into a photographic element would absorb strongly around the spectral maximum of the green-sensitized emulsion, and possess a sharp cutting bathochromic absorbance such that there is no appreciable absorbance just bathochromic to its absorbance maximum.
      <br/>
      A sharp-cutting bathochromic edge on a filter or trimmer dye enables excellent color reproduction with minimum speed loss by absorbing light efficiently up to its absorbance maximum, but very little if any just past its absorbance maximum.
      <br/>
      For example, a magenta trimmer dye (green absorber) which is only moderately sharp-cutting on the bathochromic edge may function adequately as a filter dye, but its unwanted absorbance in the red region past its  LAMBDA max will rob the red-sensitive emulsion coated below it of red light and hence speed.
      <br/>
      Though the position of optimal absorption maximum for a magenta trimmer dye will vary depending on the photographic element being constructed, it is particularly desirable in one type of typical color photographic element containing a layer sensitized to each of the three primary regions of the visible spectrum, i.e., blue, green, and red, that a magenta trimmer dye absorb strongly at about 550 nm, and possess a sharp cutting bathochromic absorbance such that there is no appreciable absorbance above about 550 nm.
      <br/>
      Therefore it would be desirable to provide a filter dye for use in photographic elements that possesses high requisite absorbance in the green region of the spectrum below about 550 nm, but little or no absorbance above about 550 nm, and furthermore does not suffer from incubative or post process stain problems, and furthermore is not prone to migration in the coated film, but is fully removed upon processing.
    </p>
    <p num="11">
      One method used to incorporate solvent or water-soluble filter dyes into photographic film element layers is to add them as aqueous or alcoholic isotropic solutions.
      <br/>
      Dyes introduced by this method are generally highly mobile and rapidly diffusing and often wander into other layers of the element, usually with deleterious results.
      <br/>
      While the use of polymeric mordants can prevent dye wandering, such mordants aggravate the stain problem encountered when the dye remains in the element through processing.
    </p>
    <p num="12">
      Filter dyes have also been prepared as conventional dispersions in aqueous gelatin using standard colloid milling or homogenization methods or as loaded latices.
      <br/>
      More recently, ball-milling, sand-milling, media-milling and related methods of producing fine-particle-size slurries and suspensions of solid filter dyes have become standard tools for producing slurries and dispersions that can readily be used in photographic melt formulations.
      <br/>
      Solid particle filter dyes introduced as dispersions, when coated at sufficiently low pH, can eliminate problems associated with dye wandering.
      <br/>
      However, solvent-insoluble solid particle filter dyes (pigments) provide relatively low absorption coefficients, requiring that an excessive amount of dye be coated.
      <br/>
      In addition, it is very difficult to find classes of solid particle dispersion dyes which consistently yield useful, sharp-cutting bathochromic or hysochromic spectral features due to their microcrystalline nature.
      <br/>
      In fact the hue of a microcrystalline dye is highly unpredictable and often varies tremendously between similar analogs.
      <br/>
      In addition many solid particle dyes are not robust under keeping conditions of high heat and humidity experienced in melting and coating operations.
      <br/>
      Under such conditions, microcrystals of dye can undergo ripening, resulting in a lower optical density post incubation.
      <br/>
      In addition, the time and expense involved in preparing serviceable solid particle filter dye dispersions by milling techniques are a deterrent to their use, especially in large volume applications.
      <br/>
      It is therefore desirable to provide dye dispersions that do not necessarily require mechanical milling before use and that do not wander but that wash out easily during processing leaving little or no residual stain.
      <br/>
      It is also desirable that such filter dye dispersions provide high light absorption efficiencies with sharp-cutting absorbance peaks.
      <br/>
      One method of obtaining these desirable dye features in solid particle dispersions of oxonol filter dyes was described by Texter (U.S. Pat Nos. 5,274,109, 5,326,687 and 5,624,467).
      <br/>
      Texter describes a process by which pyrazolone oxonol dyes are microprecipitated under strictly controlled pH conditions to produce absorbance spectra which are narrow, bathochromic and sharp cutting on the long wavelength side relative to their corresponding milled solid particle dispersions.
      <br/>
      This technique, however, is impractical for large volume applications.
    </p>
    <p num="13">
      A specific class of dyes, barbituric acid oxonol dyes, have been disclosed in commonly assigned copending U.S. application Ser.

No. 5,766,834 to possess sharp-cutting spectral properties when incorporated into gelatin coatings; however no reference is made to suggest that other filter dye classes might possess these useful spectral features.
      <br/>
      Further, the spectral features of these dyes are limited to a few specific wavelength ranges, and the hue of these sharp-cutting dyes are not tunable over a large useful range.
    </p>
    <p num="14">It would be very useful if dye materials were available that were non-wandering, like solid particle dispersions, but were additionally narrowly absorbing and sharp-cutting in spectral features, like fully solvent-soluble dyes, and were additionally available at a wide variety of absorbance maxima useful in imaging elements.</p>
    <heading>PROBLEM TO BE SOLVED BY THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="15">
      It is therefore desirable to have a dye, especially a filter dye, which has a high extinction coefficient, a narrow halfbandwidth, and is sharp cutting on the bathochromic and/or hypsochromic edge, and even more preferably on both the hypsochromic and bathochromic edges.
      <br/>
      For dyes used in photographic elements, it is additionally desirable that the dye is capable of being substantially completely removed or rendered colorless on process of an exposed radiation-sensitive element comprising said dye.
      <br/>
      It is also desirable that the coated dye be robust in its spectral and physical properties and not prone to migration within the imaging element.
      <br/>
      It is also desirable to have a method for preparing a dispersion of a filter dye that is suitable for high-volume manufacture.

    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="16">
      It has now been discovered that merocyanine dyes derived from a broad range of activated methylene nuclei may be functionalized with certain substituents and solubilizing groups, and dispersed in hydrophilic colloids to form lyotropic (solvent-induced) liquid-crystalline dye phases (mesophases).
      <br/>
      These mesophase-forming dyes possess unique and useful properties superior to those of conventional water or solvent-soluble dyes or solvent-insoluble solid particle dyes with respect to hue, spectral shape, immobility, robustness and process removability.
      <br/>
      Additionally it has been discovered that for a given dye class, one skilled in the art can optimize dye analogs such that they possess an inherent propensity to form stable liquid-crystalline phases rather than microcrystalline (solid) or isotropic (e.g. solution) phases when dispersed in solvents, including hydrophilic colloids such as aqueous gelatin.
      <br/>
      Additionally it has been discovered that modifications in the properties of the hydrophilic colloid dye dispersion, such as ionic strength, temperature and pH can improve a given dye's propensity to form a stable liquid-crystalline phase.
      <br/>
      Additionally it has been discovered that the advantageous spectral and physical properties of the dye liquid crystalline phases formed in the wet hydrophilic colloid (e.g. aqueous gelatin) are largely retained in the dried-down (evaporated) gelatin coatings of an imaging element.
    </p>
    <p num="17">
      This invention relates specifically to amphiphilic dyes, especially filter dyes in photographic elements which are capable of forming practically useful lyotropic liquid-crystalline phases, particularly dyes from the merocyanine classes.
      <br/>
      However, it is anticipated that liquid crystal formation is not necessarily restricted to these particular dye classes nor specific dye structures.
      <br/>
      This technology may also be applied to any novel merocyanine dye structure with potentially useful photographic filter properties.
      <br/>
      It is understood that the degree of amphophilicity to be imparted to a particular dye chromophore by the incorporation of said solubilizing groups will vary from chromophore to chromophore and from dye class to dye class.
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      Liquid-crystalline filter dyes afford a host of benefits over conventional state-of-the-art solid particle (microcrystalline)-incorporated dyes or water-soluble (isotropic solution) filter dyes, for photographic imaging applications.
      <br/>
      Moreover, they provide a combination of spectral and physical properties that is virtually unachievable using either water-soluble or solid particle dyes.
      <br/>
      The following beneficial spectral and physical properties are inherent to the liquid-crystalline form of the dye.
      <br/>
      For example, dyes dispersed in a lyotropic liquid-crystalline form exhibit slow collective molecular diffusion (orders of magnitude slower than dye isotropic solution species) affording good layer specificity and immobility, like (microcrystalline) solid particle dyes and unlike unmordanted isotropic solution dyes.
      <br/>
      Dyes dispersed in a lyotropic liquid-crystalline form exhibit significantly higher extinction coefficients than (microcrystalline) solid particle dyes dispersed at equivalent wet laydowns (concentrations).
      <br/>
      Dyes dispersed in a lyotropic liquid-crystalline form show processing washout and bleaching rates comparable to, but usually much better than, conventional (microcrystalline) solid particle dyes.
      <br/>
      Lyotropic liquid-crystalline dye phases are more easily, rapidly and reproducibly formulated than (microcrystalline) solid particle dye phases.
      <br/>
      Dyes dispersed in a lyotropic liquid-crystalline form, (especially the smectic mesophase form), often exhibit sharper-cutting, more intense spectral absorption features than their (microcrystalline) solid particle counterparts, making them particularly useful as photographic finger filters.
      <br/>
      Dyes dispersed in a lyotropic liquid-crystalline form often exhibit characteristic bathochromically-shifted excitonic absorption J-bands (sharp, narrow and intense), possessing (long-wavelength) sharp-cutting spectral features, making them particularly useful for many photographic finger-filter applications.
      <br/>
      So-called J-band (J-aggregate) spectra are not readily afforded by (microcrystalline) solid particle dyes.
      <br/>
      Dyes dispersed in a lyotropic liquid-crystalline form may also exhibit practically useful hypsochromically-shifted H-band absorption spectra, with (short-wavelength) sharp-cutting spectral features.
      <br/>
      Dyes dispersed in a lyotropic liquid-crystalline state may also exhibit little or no spectral shift compared with the dye's isotropic solution absorbance state, yet still retain the characteristic immobility of the liquid crystalline phase.
      <br/>
      The essentially "immobile" lyotropic liquid-crystalline form (phase) of the preferred amphiphilic filter dyes, exhibiting characteristic and practically useful J-band and H-band absorption spectra, are quite distinct, easily identifiable and readily distinguishable from non-liquid-crystalline (isotropic) rapidly-diffusing dye phases which occasionally exhibit similar absorption spectra.
      <br/>
      Dyes dispersed in a lyotropic liquid-crystalline state in aqueous, or those dyes passing through a transitory mesophase upon the drying of aqueous gelatin layers, usually retain the useful spectral and physical properties associated with the mesophase in the evaporated (dried-down)state.
      <br/>
      Dyes initially dispersed as a lyotropic liquid-crystalline form often exhibit good incubation stability in evaporated gelatin layers.

    <heading>ADVANTAGEOUS EFFECTS OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="44">
      This invention provides a merocyanine dye, useful as a filter dye or light-absorbing compound in an imaging element, and especially in a radiation-sensitive element, such as a photographic element, which when dispersed in an aqueous medium, for example aqueous gelatin, dissolves then spontaneously forms a lyotropic liquid-crystalline phase which constitutes an unusually well-ordered and thermodynamically stable dye state.
      <br/>
      A dye in the liquid-crystalline state often possesses a coated  LAMBDA max which is substantially bathochromic or hypsochromic to that of its monomeric isotropic solution (non-liquid crystalline) state and exhibits exceptionally high covering power at its coating  LAMBDA max.
      <br/>
      Further, the liquid-crystalline dye phase often exhibits sharp-cutting bathochromic and/or hypsochromic spectral features absorbing strongly at its coating  LAMBDA max, while absorbing comparatively little light at wavelengths just below or just above its absorbance maximum.
      <br/>
      Further, the liquid-crystalline dye phase often possesses an unusually narrow halfbandwidth.
      <br/>
      The dyes of this invention can be formulated for incorporation into a photographic element using, for example, conventional ball-mill or media-mill procedures for producing dye dispersions (SPD's), or more simply as direct gelatin dispersions (DGD's) for incorporation in a photographic element, as discussed more fully below.
      <br/>
      In the photographic element, dyes in the spontaneously-formed liquid-crystalline state exhibit little, if any tendency to wander, and upon processing many are substantially free of post-process stain problems.

      The dyes of Formulae I-VIII can be prepared by synthetic techniques well-known in the art, as illustrated by the synthetic examples below.
      <br/>

      The liquid-crystalline dye dispersions of this invention may be prepared by well-known methods commonly employed for preparing solid particle dye dispersions.

      Here, a slurry of the dye in an aqueous medium comprising water and a surfactant or water-soluble polymer is subjected to a milling procedure such as ball-milling, sand-milling, media-milling or colloid-milling (preferably media-milling).
      <br/>
      The dye slurry can then be mixed with aqueous gelatin at an appropriate concentration (preferably  &lt;= 30% w/w) and at a temperature (preferably 20 to 90 (degree)  C.)for use in a photographic element.

    <p num="90">In another preferred embodiment, the liquid-crystalline dye dispersions of this invention may be prepared using a direct gelatin dispersion (DGD) method wherein the finely powdered dye or aqueous slurry thereof is simply mixed or agitated with water or with an aqueous medium containing gelatin (or other hydrophilic colloid) at an appropriate concentration (preferably  &lt;= 30% w/w) and at a temperature (preferably 0 to 100 (degree)  C.).</p>
    <p num="91">
      In either of the preferred methods, the dyes may be subjected to elevated temperatures before and/or after gelatin dispersion, but to obtain desirable results, this heat treatment is carried out preferably after dispersing in gelatin.
      <br/>
      The optimal temperature range for preparing gelatin-based dispersions is 20 (degree)  C.-100 (degree)  C., depending on the concentration of the gelatin, but should remain below the decomposition points of the dyes, and, preferably forth range of 5 minutes to 48 hours.
      <br/>
      A similar heat treatment may be applied, if so desired, to dyes prepared by milling methods as solid particle dispersions before and/or after dispersion in aqueous gelatin to obtain effective results.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, if so desired, pH and/or ionic strength and solvent composition adjustments, for example, may be utilized to control the solubility and liquid crystal-forming properties of dyes prepared using SPD or DGD formulation techniques.
      <br/>
      The direct gelatin dispersion method is advantageous in that it does not necessarily require the use of organic solvents, surfactants, polymer additives, electrolytes, milling processes, pH control or the like.
      <br/>
      It is generally simpler, faster, more forgiving and more flexible than milling processes.
      <br/>
      A related method described by Boettcher for preparing concentrated sensitizing dye dispersions in aqueous gelatin (PCT WO 93/23792) is equally effective when applied to the inventive dyes.

      The dyes formulated as described above possess a pronounced tendency to form liquid crystal phases spontaneously at a variety of pH's, including typical coating pH's of 6 or less (generally 4-6) such that they do not substantially wander from the layer in which they are coated.

      For most materials, it is generally accepted that only three states of matter exist; namely, solids, liquids and gases.
      <br/>
      However, some materials exhibit a fourth state of matter commonly referred to as a liquid crystal phase (or mesophase).
      <br/>
      Liquid crystal phases are neither crystalline solids nor isotropic liquids, but exhibit some of the characteristics of both.
      <br/>
      A liquid crystal phase can be described simply as being a liquid with a certain degree of molecular order.
      <br/>
      As described below, this molecular order gives rise to measurable anisotropy in the bulk properties of a material that is otherwise much like a liquid.
      <br/>
      Consequently, the physical properties of liquid-crystalline materials are unique and distinct from those of solids and liquids.
      <br/>
      These differences can be utilized to advantage in the formulation of photographic elements and also allow detection of the liquid crystal phase by a variety of optical and spectroscopic techniques.
    </p>
    <p num="96">
      Liquid crystals can be classified as thermotropic or lyotropic.
      <br/>
      The dye compositions of the current invention are of the lyotropic type, however, for puposes of comparision, we first give a brief description the thermotropic type: Some crystalline compounds do not yield an isotropic liquid immediately upon melting, instead, the newly formed "melt" is a liquid crystal phase (mesophase).
      <br/>
      In the simple cases, further heating results in the formation of an ordinary isotropic liquid.
      <br/>
      The phase that exists above the melting point of the crystalline solid but below the formation temperature for the isotropic liquid is known as a thermotropic liquid crystal phase.
      <br/>
      In some cases, heating the initally formed mesophase does not result in an isotropic liquid, but rather, to one or more intermediate liquid crystal phases, and finally, the last formed of these, upon further heating, yields the isotropic liquid.
      <br/>
      All of the mesophases formed in this way are conventionally classified as thermotropic.
      <br/>
      The term thermotropic liquid crystal is also extended to include eutectic mixtures of compounds.
      <br/>
      Thermotropic. liquid crystals are generally colorless organic materials and are typically hydrophobic (water-insoluble) in character.
      <br/>
      They are commonly employed in electro-optical display devices, for example digital watches and calculators.
    </p>
    <p num="97">
      In contrast, spontaneous formation of lyotropic liquid crystals can be achieved at a fixed temperature by simple addition of a solvent to a suitable solute (mesogen).
      <br/>
      The solvent is typically (but not necessarily) water and lyotropic mesophases are stable over finite ranges of both concentration and temperature.
      <br/>
      Typical lyotropic mesogens are amphiphilic.
      <br/>
      The term amphiphilic acknowledges that both hydrophobic groups (e.g. aliphatic, aromatic, etc.) and hydrophilic groups (e.g. CO2- M+, SO3- M+, SO4- M+, O(CH2 CH2 O)x etc.) are present on the same molecule.
      <br/>
      Examples include, surfactants, lipids, polymers, dyes, and drugs.
      <br/>
      The amphiphilic nature and the specific hydrophilic-hydrophobic balance (HHB) of these molecules influences their tendency to form lyotropic mesophases.
    </p>
    <p num="98">
      The structural type(s) and stability with respect to concentration and temperature of the liquid crystalline phase(s) formed are highly mesogen-dependent.
      <br/>
      For example, Koll et al. (U.S. Pat. No. 4,309,183, Jan. 5, 1982) teach how a lyotropic liquid-crystalline phase of a particular anionic azo reactive dyestuff can be prepared in water at room temperature and dye concentrations of 12-35%, for the specific use of dyeing and printing natural and synthetic substrates.
      <br/>
      However, no reference to such dyes for use in imaging elements has been reported.
    </p>
    <p num="99">Because of the complex interplay of short-range inter-molecular and long-range inter-aggregate forces controlling lyotropic mesophase formation, in general it is difficult to predict the likelihood or stability of liquid crystal formation for any given solute-solvent combination.</p>
    <p num="100">
      It is part of the purpose of this invention to demonstrate that a wide variety of chromophores can and do form lyotropic liquid crystals upon suitable manipulation of substituents.
      <br/>
      It is a further purpose of this work to provide some examples of substituent combinations that are effective in transforming some quite ordinary dyes classes, that is to say, dye classes for which mesophases have never been reported, into photographically useful lyotropic mesogens.
    </p>
    <p num="101">
      In the preferred embodiment, the amphiphilic filter dye will form any liquid-crystalline phase upon dispersing said dye in the hydrophilic solvent medium, typically, but not limited to, water or aqueous gelatin, at the wet laydown (dye concentration) and temperature of choice (preferably .quadrature. 30% w/w dye, more preferably  &lt;= 10% w/w dye, even more preferably  &lt;= 5% w/w dye and most preferably  &lt;= 0.5% w/w dye, between 0 (degree)  C. and 100 (degree)  C.).
      <br/>
      In the most preferred embodiment, said dye mesophase will possess a layered smectic structure, and in another preferred embodiment the dye mesophase will possess a nematic or hexagonal structure.
      <br/>
      We have discovered that the liquid-crystalline phase stability of lyotropic amphiphilic (particularly ionic) filter dyes may also be sensitive to the presence of addenda such as gelatin of different types, polymers, organic solvents (such as alcohols, acetone etc.) and surfactants.
      <br/>
      For example, low-levels of common electrolytes can stabilize ionic dye mesophase formation.
      <br/>
      Enhanced mesophase stability of ionic filter dyes (with respect to both temperature and concentration) may be realized simply by the judicious choice of photographic gelatin (e.g. so-called regular, deionized or decalcified gelatin grades) which contain different levels and types of electrolyte cations and anions (e.g. calcium, magnesium, sodium, chloride, sulphate etc.) as a by-product of gelatin manufacture.
      <br/>
      Similarly, the use of non-deionized water or the addition of low salt levels to purified (deionized or distilled) water, can afford enhanced mesophase stability for certain ionic filter dyes.
      <br/>
      The preferred dyes of this invention are chosen to exhibit stable lyotropic mesophases under the practical conditions generally employed for their formulation, dispersion, coating and drying.
      <br/>
      It is understood that someone skilled in the art of dyes could, with the guidance provided in this disclosure, systematically optimize dye structure and/or solvent conditions to enhance and control dye mesophase formation and stability for a suitable mesogen-solvent combination.
    </p>
    <p num="102">Since mesophase formation is both concentration and temperature dependent, it is understood that some of the preferred amphiphilic filter dyes may initially form an isotropic solution phase which will undergo a transition to a more concentrated and thermally-stable mesophase during the drying process (thermal stability of dye mesophases invariably increases with dye mesophase concentration).</p>
    <p num="103">
      Some of the preferred amphiphilic filter dyes initially dispersed in the wet hydrophilic colloid medium (e.g. aqueous gelatin) as a dilute liquid-crystalline dye phase, may remain wholly liquid-crystalline upon drying or undergo a (for example, concentration-dependent or ionic strength-dependent) reversible transition from the liquid-crystalline state to a crystalline, semi-cyrstalline. or amorphous solid dye state, or a mixture thereof, during the drying process.
      <br/>
      However, we have found that in such instances the preferred dyes still largely retain the useful spectral and physical properties associated with the originally dispersed dilute dye mesophase (e.g. absorption envelope providing good covering power, layer specificity, incubation stability, rapid processing elution and or bleachability).
      <br/>
      The final physical form of the gelatin-dispersed dye (liquid-crystalline, crystalline, amorphous solid) will depend on the precise phase behaviour of said dye in relation to the retained moisture (water) content of the evaporated (dried-down) gelatin film under given conditions of temperature and humidity and the presence of other solutes.
      <br/>
      However, according to the invention, dyes which remain liquid crystalline when formulated and dispersed in the photographic vehicle, or those which pass through a transitory liquid-crystalline phase at any stage during the subsequent coating and drying process, will afford the useful and unique combination of both spectral and physical properties, described herein.
      <br/>
      It should be emphasized that reference in this disclosure to "evaporated" or "dried" coatings refers to coatings of wet aqueous gelatin melts from which excess water or solvent has been allowed to evaporate or has been removed by drying processes, but which still retain an equilibrium moisture level typical of finished imaging elements especially photographic imaging elements.
    </p>
    <p num="104">
      According to the invention, the preferred dye chromophores must possess some added degree of hydrophilicity, imparted by ionic, zwitterionic or nonionic solubilizing groups, to be capable of forming lyotropic liquid-crystalline phases in aqueous-based media.
      <br/>
      Similarly, if so desired, for non-aqueous (e.g. organic) solvent applications, the dye should possess additional hydrophobic, rather than hydrophilic, solubilizing moieties, such as branched aliphatic chains.
    </p>
    <p num="105">
      Common mesophase structural types, such as layered smectic (e.g. lamellar), columnar hexagonal and nematic, which possess varying degrees of orientational &amp; translational molecular order, may be formed by many diverse and disparate lyotropic mesogens.
      <br/>
      Because of the inherent ordered nature of these anisotropic, thermodynamically stable, supramolecular structures, experimental techniques including, for example, small-angle X-ray (or neutron) scattering, polarized-light optical microscopy and quadrupole (e.g. 23 Na, 2 H, 17 O, 14 N etc.) NMR spectroscopy may be routinely applied to identifying and characterizing the structure and physico-chemical properties of lyotropic mesophases.
    </p>
    <p num="106">
      According to the invention, the preferred dyes can be readily identified using the technique of polarized-light optical microscopy (as described by N. H. Hartshorne in, "The Microscopy of Liquid Crystals", Microscope Publications Ltd., London, England, 1974).
      <br/>
      In order to ascertain the exact quantitative mesophase behavior of a given dye-solvent combination, a range of sample mixtures of known composition are prepared (typically dyes dissolved in aqueous gelatin) and viewed in polarized light as wet thin films (contained within sealed glass capillary cells of known pathlength) and slowly-evaporated thin films (hand-coated onto glass microscope slides and air-dried) to establish the precise concentration and temperature ranges of dye mesophase stability.
      <br/>
      These same thin-film preparations may also be used to elucidate and quantify the spectral absorption properties of the dye mesophase, such as absorption wavelength, bandwidth, extinction coefficient etc. using a uv-vis spectrophotometer.
    </p>
    <p num="107">
      Simple observations of the characteristic birefringent type-textures and rheology (flow behavior under shear) displayed by thin-film mesophase preparations in polarized light are usually sufficient to establish the mesophase structural type (e.g. smectic, nematic, hexagonal depending upon the specific long-range inter-aggregate ordering) as a function of solute-solvent concentration and temperature.
      <br/>
      Dyes forming lyotropic chromonic nematic mesophases may be identified from a range of fluid, viscoelastic textures including so-called Schlieren, Tiger-Skin, Reticulated, Homogeneous (Planar), Thread-like, Droplet and Homeotropic (Pseudoisotropic).
      <br/>
      Lyotropic chromonic hexagonal mesophases usually display viscous, birefringent Herringbone, Ribbon or Fan-like textures while lyotropic chromonic smectic mesophases may display Grainy-Mosaic, Frond-like (Pseudo-Schlieren), Spherulitic and Oily-Streak birefringent textures.
      <br/>
      In some cases where the liquid-crystalline nature of the sample cannot be established unequivocally using polarized-light optical microscopy other well-established experimental techniques may be utilized.
      <br/>
      For example, lyotropic mesophases exhibit characteristic quadrupole NMR spectroscopy lineshapes and quadrupole splittings, while small-angle and wide-angle X-ray (or neutron) diffraction measurements provide unique and characteristic structured diffraction patterns (refer to "Liquid Crystals and Plastic Crystals", eds. G. W. Gray &amp; P. A. Winsor, Ellis Horwood Ltd., Chichester, UK, 1974, Vols. 1 and 2).
      <br/>
      Such phase-dependent properties may be used to differentiate, for example, a liquid-crystalline filter dye dispersion from a conventional microcrystalline (i.e. solid) filter dye dispersion.
    </p>
    <p num="108">
      A particular advantage of the inventive dyes is that in the liquid crystalline state, they provide higher covering power at their coating  LAMBDA max than comparable known dyes which are insoluble and exist as microcrystalline solid particles in the photographic medium.
      <br/>
      This advantage is particularly important in modern film formats and processing conditions, as filter dyes with high covering power need not be coated at as high a coverage as dyes with lower covering power in order to achieve the same degree of light filtration.
      <br/>
      In addition to reducing manufacturing costs, lower levels of coated dyes will reduce the level of unwanted dye stain in the processed photographic element, and will reduce the level of dye residue built up in the processing solutions, and the resulting lower levels of dissolved dye residue removed from photographic elements will have reduced environmental impact.
    </p>
    <p num="109">
      A further advantage of dyes of the invention is that they generally possess absorbance envelopes that are sharper cutting on the bathochromic side than typical solid particle dyes.
      <br/>
      This feature is especially advantageous when strong light absorbance is required in a spectral region up to a specific  LAMBDA max and maximum light transmission is required past the specified  LAMBDA max.
      <br/>
      Such filter or trimmer dyes are especially useful when coated in specific layers of color photographic films to effectively prevent light of a specific wavelength region from exposing radiation-sensitive layers below the light filtration layer containing the dye, but without causing speed losses in the layer below the filter dye.
      <br/>
      A green filter dye coated directly above a red-sensitive silver halide layer is a particularly advantageous example of such absorbance features, and excellent green/red speed separation can be realized.
      <br/>
      A sharp-cutting bathochromic edge on a filter or trimmer dye enables excellent color reproduction with minimum speed loss by absorbing light efficiently up to its absorbance maximum, but very little if any just past its absorbance maximum.
      <br/>
      A magenta trimmer dye (green absorber) which is only moderately sharp-cutting on the bathochromic edge may function adequately as a filter dye, but its unwanted absorbance in the red region past its  LAMBDA max will rob the red-sensitive emulsion coated below it of red light and hence speed.
      <br/>
      In a typical color photographic element, it is desirable to have a green-absorbing filter dye which when coated absorbs strongly at wavelengths close to 550 nm, but which absorbs comparatively little at wavelengths greater than 550 nm.
      <br/>
      It should be emphasized that the exact envelope of desirable light absorbance for a filter dye, even specifically a green filter dye, varies tremendously from one photographic element to another depending on the intended purpose of the material.
      <br/>
      Some photographic elements might require a filter dye, such as a green filter dye, which absorbs strongly up to a wavelength somewhat shorter or longer than 550 nm, but is sharp cutting on the bathochromic side, mostly transmitting wavelengths of light past the desired absorbance  LAMBDA max.
      <br/>
      The feature of coated dye absorbance exhibiting a sharp cutting bathochromic and/or hypsochromic characteristic is fundamentally useful for wavelength-specific light filtration, though the exact wavelength of desired spectral shift from absorbance to transmission may be different for different photographic materials.
    </p>
    <p num="110">
      A further advantage of the dyes of the invention is that in the liquid crystalline state, many are much sharper absorbing than in their dissolved isotropic solution state, that is, they possess a much narrower halfbandwidth.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, unlike a dye in the dissolved, isotropic solution state, the dye in the liquid-crystalline state is essentially immobile and not prone to gross diffusion and thus can be coated layer specifically.
    </p>
    <p num="111">
      The dyes may be located in any layer of the element where it is desirable to absorb light, but in photographic elements it is particularly advantageous to locate them in a layer where they will be solubilized and washed out during processing.
      <br/>
      Useful amounts of dye range from 1 to 1000 mg/m2.
      <br/>
      The dye should be present in an amount sufficient to yield an optical density at the absorbance Dmax in the spectral region of interest before processing of at least 0.10 density units and preferably at least 0.50 density units.
      <br/>
      This optical density will generally be less than 5.0 density units for most photographic applications.

    <p num="112">
      The dyes of the invention can be used as interlayer dyes, trimmer dyes, antihalation dyes or light-absorbing elements.

Nos. 4,900,652 and 4,803,150 and European Patent Application Publication No. 0 391 405, to prevent unwanted light from reaching a sensitive emulsion layer of a multicolor photographic element as disclosed in U.S. Pat No. 4,988,611, and for other uses as indicated by the absorbance spectrum of the particular dye.

      The silver halide used in the photographic elements may be silver iodobromide, silver bromide, silver chloride, silver chlorobromide, silver chloroiodobromide, and the like.
      <br/>
      For example, the silver halide used in the photographic elements of the present invention may contain at least 90% silver chloride or more (for example, at least 95%, 98%, 99% or 100% silver chloride).
      <br/>
      In the case of such high chloride silver halide emulsions, some silver bromide may be present but typically substantially no silver iodide.
      <br/>
      Substantially no silver iodide means the iodide concentration would be no more than 1%, and preferably less than 0.5 or 0.1%. In particular, in such a case the possibility is also contemplated that the silver chloride could be treated with a bromide source to increase its sensitivity, although the bulk concentration of bromide in the resulting emulsion will typically be no more than about 2 to 2.5% and preferably between about 0.6 to 1.2% (the remainder being silver chloride).
      <br/>
      The foregoing % figures are mole %.
    </p>
    <p num="131">
      The type of silver halide grains preferably include polymorphic, cubic, and octahedral.
      <br/>
      The grain size of the silver halide may have any distribution known to be useful in photographic compositions, and may be either polydipersed or monodispersed.
    </p>
    <p num="132">
      Tabular grain silver halide emulsions may also be used.
      <br/>
      Tabular grains are those with two parallel major faces each clearly larger than any remaining grain face and tabular grain emulsions are those in which the tabular grains account for at least 30 percent, more typically at least 50 percent, preferably &gt;70 percent and optimally &gt;90 percent of total grain projected area.
      <br/>
      The tabular grains can account for substantially all (&gt;97 percent) of total grain projected area.
      <br/>
      The tabular grain emulsions can be high aspect ratio tabular grain emulsions--i.e., ECD/t&gt;8, where ECD is the diameter of a circle having an area equal to grain projected area and t is tabular grain thickness; intermediate aspect ratio tabular grain emulsions--i.e., ECD/t=5 to 8; or low aspect ratio tabular grain emulsions--i.e., ECD/t=2 to 5.
      <br/>
      The emulsions typically exhibit high tabularity (T), where T (i.e., ECD/t2)&gt;25 and ECD and t are both measured in micrometers (mm).
      <br/>
      The tabular grains can be of any thickness compatible with achieving an aim average aspect ratio and/or average tabularity of the tabular grain emulsion.
      <br/>
      Preferably the tabular grains satisfying projected area requirements are those having thicknesses of &lt;0.3 mm, thin (&lt;0.2 mm) tabular grains being specifically preferred and ultrathin (&lt;0.07 mm) tabular grains being contemplated for maximum tabular grain performance enhancements.
      <br/>
      When the native blue absorption of iodohalide tabular grains is relied upon for blue speed, thicker tabular grains, typically up to 0.5 mm in thickness, are contemplated.

      <br/>
      These methods generally involve mixing a water soluble silver salt with a water soluble halide salt in the presence of a protective colloid, and controlling the temperature, pAg, pH values, etc, at suitable values during formation of the silver halide by precipitation.

      The photographic elements of the present invention, as is typical, provide the silver halide in the form of an emulsion.
      <br/>
      Photographic emulsions generally include a vehicle for coating the emulsion as a layer of a photographic element.
      <br/>
      Useful vehicles include both naturally occurring substances such as proteins, protein derivatives, cellulose derivatives (e.g., cellulose esters), gelatin (e.g., alkali-treated gelatin such as cattle bone or hide gelatin, or acid treated gelatin such as pigskin gelatin), gelatin derivatives (e.g., acetylated gelatin, phthalated gelatin, and the like), and others as described in Research Disclosure I. Also useful as vehicles or vehicle extenders are hydrophilic water-permeable colloids.
      <br/>
      These include synthetic polymeric peptizers, carriers, and/or binders such as poly(vinyl alcohol), poly(vinyl lactams), acrylamide polymers, polyvinyl acetals, polymers of alkyl and sulfoalkyl acrylates and methacrylates, hydrolyzed polyvinyl acetates, polyamides, polyvinyl pyridine, methacrylamide copolymers, and the like, as described in Research Disclosure I. The vehicle can be present in the emulsion in any amount useful in photographic emulsions.
      <br/>
      The emulsion can also include any of the addenda known to be useful in photographic emulsions.
      <br/>
      These include chemical sensitizers, such as active gelatin, sulfur, selenium, tellurium, gold, platinum, palladium, iridium, osmium, rhenium, phosphorous, or combinations thereof.
      <br/>
      Chemical sensitization is generally carried out at pAg levels of from 5 to 10, pH levels of from 5 to 8, and temperatures of from 30 to 80 (degree)  C., as described in Research Disclosure I, Section IV (pages 510-511) and the references cited therein.

    <p num="138">
      The silver halide may be sensitized by sensitizing dyes by any method known in the art, such as described in Research Disclosure I. The dye may be added to an emulsion of the silver halide grains and a hydrophilic colloid at any time prior to (e.g., during or after chemical sensitization) or simultaneous with the coating of the emulsion on a photographic element.
      <br/>
      The dyes may, for example, be added as a solution in water or an alcohol.
      <br/>
      The dye/silver halide emulsion may be mixed with a dispersion of color image-forming coupler immediately before coating or in advance of coating (for example, 2 hours).

    <p num="139">
      Photographic elements of the present invention are preferably imagewise exposed using any of the known techniques, including those described in Research Disclosure I, section XVI.
      <br/>
      This typically involves exposure to light in the visible region of the spectrum, and typically such exposure is of a live image through a lens, although exposure can also be exposure to a stored image (such as a computer stored image) by means of light emitting devices (such as light emitting diodes, CRT and the like).

In the case of processing a negative working element, the element is treated with a color developer (that is one which will form the colored image dyes with the color couplers), and then with a oxidizer and a solvent to remove silver and silver halide.
      <br/>
      In the case of processing a reversal color element, the element is first treated with a black and white developer (that is, a developer which does not form colored dyes with the coupler compounds) followed by a treatment to fog silver halide (usually chemical fogging or light fogging), followed by treatment with a color developer.

      Crystalline DGD's (solid dye, non-liquid crystalline) were readily distinguishable from isotropic and liquid-crystalline DGD's due to the presence of finite-sized solid dye particles or crystals, or clumps of such solid particles or crystals, which were not readily deformable with moderate shear when pressure was applied to the cover glass.

      By maintaining the sample slide at an elevated temperature, the presence and stability of the dye mesophase(s) could be monitored during peripheral evaporation of the solvent to a more concentrated evaporated (dried-down) state.
      <br/>
      The most preferred dyes of the invention exhibited microscopic liquid-crystalline textures in the wet gelled state, the wet melt (sol) state and the evaporated (dried-down) state.
      <br/>
      These states (gelled, sol and evaporated) are denoted in Table 11, column 4 by the letters g, s and e in parenthesis.
      <br/>
      The dye and gelatin concentrations refer to the samples in the wet gelled and sol states, before evaporation.
      <br/>
      For some of the inventive dyes, aqueous dye dispersions of known composition (without gelatin) were prepared by mixing the powdered dye into water at 60 (degree)  C. for 1 hour with agitation, then cooling to room temperature before microscopic examination.

      The above results demonstrate that the direct gelatin dispersions containing the inventive dyes, dispersed in a smectic liquid-crystalline state, exhibit bathochromically or hypsochromically-shifted absorption maxima relative to their isotropic solution (i.e. monomeric) absorption maxima.
      <br/>
      Moreover, the inventive dyes, when formulated as wet liquid-crystalline DGD's, exhibit higher extinction coefficients and narrower halfbandwidths compared to their non liquid-crystalline, isotropic solution states in a solvent such as methanol.
      <br/>
      Moreover, as wet liquid-crystalline DGD's the inventive dyes are far superior in both Hbw and extinction coefficient to the comparative non liquid-crystalline dyes A and B.

      The above data clearly demonstrate that the inventive liquid crystal-forming dyes, whether nematic or smectic in nature, remain largely, and in some cases completely immobile when coated, and do not appreciably migrate from the layer in which they are coated.
      <br/>
      By contrast, the comparative dyes migrate freely from the layer in which they are coated to adjacent layers.
      <br/>
      This example demonstrates a fundamental advantage of the inventive liquid crystal-forming dyes over soluble dyes widely used in the art.

      The above results demonstrate that the direct gelatin dispersions containing some of the inventive nematic liquid crystal-forming dyes display a wider range of spectral properties than the smectic liquid crystal-forming dyes of the previous example.
      <br/>
      These properties range from clearly advantaged in terms of extinction coefficient and halfbandwidth to somewhat disadvantaged relative to the corresponding isotropic solution.
      <br/>
      However, the inventive liquid crystal-forming dyes of this example all possess the superior property of being slow or non-diffusing in coated layers as compared with the monomeric (non-liquid crystalline) comparative dyes (see Example 3), an important physical property typical of liquid crystal phases.

      The data clearly demonstrate that the inventive liquid crystal-forming dyes when coated in aqueous gelatin coatings possess absorption spectra with significantly narrower absorbance envelopes and exhibit sharper hypsochromic and bathochromic edges relative to the comparative solid particle dyes.
      <br/>
      It should also be noted that for the inventive dyes with ratios marked as "&gt;20", the O.D+20 nm value is sufficiently low that it has no measurable density relative to noise.
      <br/>
      It should also be noted that when the comparative dyes were formulated using Formulation B, the quality of the resulting coatings was very poor due to the insolubility of the dyes in the melts.
      <br/>
      The comparative dyes were therefore milled (Formulation A) prior to coating, as is the usual procedure for solid particle dyes.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the dyes of this invention not only possess spectral properties far superior to the comparative examples, but their superior properties may be obtained without requiring the more complex Formulation A procedure by instead using the simple Formulation B procedure.
    </p>
    <p num="196">
      This example demonstrates a fundamental advantage of the inventive liquid crystal-forming dyes over solid particle dyes.
      <br/>
      This example also demonstrates that the inventive liquid crystalline dyes provide sharp, narrowly absorbing spectra in coatings that are virtually unachievable using traditional solid particle dyes.
    </p>
    <p num="197">
      In summary, the above examples demonstrate that the inventive dyes successfully solve the problems inherent in the filter dyes of the prior art.
      <br/>
      Soluble dyes typically migrate in coatings unless mordanted.
      <br/>
      Solid particle dyes typically do not migrate, but their spectral envelopes are generally very broad, low in covering power, and not sharp-cutting.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, solid particle dyes require specialized milling procedures for incorporation into coated elements.
      <br/>
      Our examples demonstrate that our inventive liquid crystal-forming dyes possess the combination of superior spectral characteristics of high extinction, narrow bandwidth, and sharp-cutting edges and furthermore remain immobile and therefore allow layer-specific dyeing without the use of mordants.
      <br/>
      Moreover, many of the liquid crystal-forming dyes of this invention are readily decolorized or removed from the photographic element upon processing, leaving little or no post-process dye stain.
