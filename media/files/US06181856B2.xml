      <br/>
      A method and apparatus for providing an improved coupling between waveguides of an integrated optical waveguide circuit component and waveguides of an optical fiber array.
      <br/>
      The circuit component and optical fiber array are aligned and adjusted relative to each other while sensing the total optical power outputted from all of the optical fibers of the array.
      <br/>
      An integrating sphere is utilized to sum the individual optical power outputs of all of the optical fibers and an autoalignment system is used to adjust the relevant position of the component and the fiber array to maximize the total optical power outputted from the fibers into the integrating sphere.

    <heading>FIELD OF INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="1">
      The present invention relates to a method of aligning optical waveguide arrays.
      <br/>
      Such a method comprises monitoring the total optical power coupled from the optical waveguides of a first array into the optical waveguides of a second array.
      <br/>
      The invention is especially suited for aligning, coupling and connecting an integrated optical waveguide circuit component to an array of optical fibers held in an optical fiber array holder.
    </p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">Integrated optical waveguide circuit devices, such as planar waveguides, lightwave optical circuits, and optical devices on planar glass and semiconductor substrates are becoming increasingly important in multi-wavelength transmissions systems, fiber-to-the-home, and optical telecommunications systems.</p>
    <p num="3">
      To function, a light guiding waveguide region in the optical device must be interconnected or pigtailed with a light guiding waveguide region in an optical fiber or another optical device.
      <br/>
      The interconnection requires low loss, typically less than 0.2 db per connection, environmental reliability against heat and humidity, and cost effectiveness.
      <br/>
      Achieving a low loss connection requires extremely high precision alignment of the light guiding waveguide regions.
    </p>
    <p num="4">One way to align the waveguide region in planar optical devices with the light guiding region in an optical fiber is by active alignment, wherein the waveguide regions are butted together, the alignment is monitored with an optical monitoring tool, and the abutting waveguide regions are then secured together.</p>
    <p num="5">
      Another approach is passive alignment, which involves aligning the waveguide regions by mechanical means.
      <br/>
      For example, a planar optical device may be aligned with an array of fibers or another planar device by using a pair of MT type connector devices, fabricated by forming V-grooves on a silicon wafer which support a planar waveguide surrounded by a plastic molded MT type connector plug.
      <br/>
      The V-grooves are precisely located on the wafer, and the V-grooves support guide pins.
      <br/>
      The guide pins are positioned to be received by guide holes on an oppositely disposed MT-type connector plug which contains an array of optical fibers.
      <br/>
      Connection of the two plug ends passively aligns the planar waveguide and the array of fibers.
      <br/>
      Such prior methods do not provide an economic means to precisely align arrays of optical waveguides with optimized optical coupling.

      In practicing the invention a single mode splitter/coupler circuit component 20 was aligned, coupled and connected to an array 22 of eight single mode optical fibers held in a V-grooved precision block optical fiber array holder 36.
      <br/>
      An autoalignment system 52 was used to adjust and manipulate the relative physical position of waveguide port array 24 to optical fiber coupling ends 32. 1 * 8 splitter/coupler circuit component 20 was fixed as shown in FIG. 5 and optical fiber array 22 was translated in the x and y direction and rotated along an axis 50 normal to the x-y plane.
      <br/>
      An example 30 of such an autoalignment system 52 is the Newport AutoAlign (tm)  System available from Newport Corporation, 1791 Deere Avenue, Irvine, Calif. 92606, U.S.A. Terminal ends 34 of optical fiber array optical fiber ribbon 48 were inserted into integrating sphere 44, such as a Model 818-IS-1 available from Newport Corporation, 1791 Deere Avenue, Irvine, Calif. 92606, U.S.A. Terminal ends 34 were obtained by mass cleaving of optical fiber ribbon 48.

      The optical power coupled from circuit component 20 and into optical fiber array 22 is inversely proportional to the misalignment of each individual waveguide port 26 to its respective matching and corresponding optical fiber coupling end 32, and depends on the positioning error of waveguide port 26 and the optical fiber cores of optical fiber coupling ends 32.
      <br/>
      Such positioning error will always be present and depends on the process noise in the manufacturing processes of the circuit components and the optical fiber arrays, with variations between individual pieces.

      The invention uses the total sum of each of the individual power channels together for finding the optimal position of fiber array 22 in front of circuit component 20, instead of using the optical power of individual power channels, such as the first and last fiber in the array.
      <br/>
      The assumption is made that this sum varies as a linear combination of the misalignment error, and that a geometrical modeling can be established to quantify the gain of the inventive method in terms of alignment precision.

    <p num="42">Considering the sum square error distance for each channel as the criterion to minimize:  (Equation image '1' not included in text)</p>

    <p num="47">
      In FIG. 7, the plot of square error distance (Tm2) versus channel compares the inventive method with optimization using only the individual and separate optical power monitoring of the first and last fiber in the array (fiber 1 and fiber 8).
      <br/>
      The improvement of the inventive method is noticeable and represents a gain of about 17% in terms of alignment precision.
      <br/>
      Such a gain is very beneficial and has a direct impact on the behavior in environmental tests of a circuit component connected to a fiber array, such as specified in Bellcore GR1209 and 1221 requirements regarding thermal cycling and damp heat environmental tests.
      <br/>
      As shown in FIG. 7, there is some trade off in that some channels are worse and others are better, in that the invention focuses on the total optical power of the fiber array and not the individual optical power of a fiber in the array.

      --                           92.4  Numerical Total
    </p>
    <p num="50">
      The individually and separately measured optical power of channels 1 through 8 in Table I were each measured one at a time after fiber array 22 was aligned and optimally coupled to circuit component 20 using a first optical power sensor to monitor the first fiber in the array and a second optical power sensor to monitor the last fiber in the array.
      <br/>
      The 92.4 numerical total is just the numerical sum of the eight individually and separately measured optical power values.
    </p>
    <p num="51">
      The total optical power coupled from circuit component 20 into fiber array 22 (for the connection of the circuit component and fiber array Table I achieved by optimization using the first and last fiber of the array) was measured as 92.2 TW using the apparatus of the invention by inserting the terminal fiber ends 34 into integrating sphere 44.
      <br/>
      The method and apparatus of the invention was then used to optimize the alignment between the same particular circuit component 20 and fiber array 22 of Table I. The inventive method and apparatus optimized the alignment to provide a maximized total optical power of 99.2 TW. The inventive method provided a total optical power gain of about 7% (7 Tw greater than that achieved by alignment with monitoring the first and last fibers of the array with separate and individual optical power sensors).
    </p>
    <p num="52">
      The alignment method of the invention provides for optimization of the total optical power of the N fibers of the fiber array by putting the N terminal ends of the N fibers into the integrating sphere.
      <br/>
      The integrating sphere acquires the sum of the power of each channel and the coupling operation of the fibers in the ribbon is economic in time because one does not need to strip and cleave each fiber of the array, or individually monitor fibers in the array.
      <br/>
      The inventive method can be used with autoalignment algorithms used for positioning single optical fiber.
