      The present invention discloses a quick release hitch pin which comprises an elongated member having a handle thereon which includes a locking assembly.
      <br/>
      The elongated member has a rod disposed in a central bore spring tensioned outwardly having a plunger on its inner end positioned between a pair of balls positioned in apertures which balls are urged outwardly by the plunger.
      <br/>
      As the balls are urged outwardly they form a locking member against the underside of the tow bar thereby preventing removal of the elongated member or pin.
      <br/>
      Alternative embodiments disclose a pair of tabs communicating with the lower portion of a looped rod, with the tabs having tangs thereon which tangs contact the underside of the tow bar when in the extended position thereby preventing removal of the elongated member.

    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="1">
      1.
      <br/>
      Field of the Invention
    </p>
    <p num="2">The present invention relates generally to trailer hitch pins and, more particularly, is concerned with a quick release trailer hitch pin.</p>
    <p num="3">2. Description of the Prior Art</p>
    <p num="4">
      Trailer hitches and trailer hitch pins have been described in the prior art.
      <br/>
      However, none of the prior art devices disclose the unique features of the present invention.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      In U.S. Pat. No. 5,048,854, dated Sep. 17, 1997, Clark disclosed a winch-driven hitch system for coupling trailers to tow vehicles.
      <br/>
      The system comprises a unitary frame pivotally mounted beneath the bumper of the vehicle by a rigid pivot shaft, which projects upwardly from the center of the frame.
      <br/>
      A rigid base defines a tubular cavity and a platform for mounting a winch adjacent of the cavity.
      <br/>
      The cavity slidably receives a rigid bar coupled to the trailer.
      <br/>
      Deflectors project angularly outwardly from the cavity to define a mouth for guiding the bar into alignment as it penetrates the mouth.
      <br/>
      The frame rotates in response to pressure applied by the cable when the trailer is drawn from either side of the two vehicles.
      <br/>
      The bar comprises a tapered end, a locking orifice defined centrally through the bar, and an orificed end for receiving a trailer connector.
      <br/>
      A rigid travel-limiting stop projects upwardly between the locking orifice and the orificed end.
      <br/>
      The stop limits travel of the bar relative to the mouth to assure proper coupling.
      <br/>
      The frame pivots roughly sixty-five degrees relative to the longitudinal axis of the cavity.
      <br/>
      Rotation of the frame is limited by a rigid stop projecting upwardly from the frame.
      <br/>
      The winch cable is anchored by a hand-tied knot to facilitate repair if broken.
      <br/>
      A drop pin and a cotter pin assembly are provided to assure safe coupling and to prevent frame rotation during travel.
      <br/>
      Electrical controls for the winch are mounted remote from the hitching zone.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      In U.S. Pat. No. 4,196,919, dated Apr. 8, 1980, Tomen disclosed a hitch assembly which readily attaches itself to the bumper of an automobile and simultaneously secures the cross bar or draft bar of the hitch in a manner which requires no threading devices to obtain the securing action.
      <br/>
      In fact, the securing action is by the simple movement of a lever into an over centered position on the hitch assembly and this in cooperation with two chains thereof, one attached to the upper margin and the other attached to the lower margin of the bumper or possibly the frame of the car securingly clasps not only the hitch assembly to the bumper but the draft bar to the hitch assembly.
      <br/>
      Preferably hitch assemblies are provided one at each end of the cross or draft bar.
      <br/>
      Thus with "snaps" of each lever into over center position the bumper hitch is secured to the automobile awaiting for connection of the trailer tow bar thereof for coupling to an awaiting trailer.

    <p num="19">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT(S)</p>
    <p num="20">Turning now descriptively to the drawings, in which similar reference characters denote similar elements throughout the several views, FIGS. 1 through 5 illustrate the present invention wherein there is disclosed a quick release hitch assembly.</p>
    <p num="21">
      Turning to FIG. 1, therein is shown a cutaway view of the present invention 10 in the locked position shown inserted through a conventional trailer hitch tow bar assembly 12 as might be found on the rear of a towing vehicle having an elongated member 14 passing through an aperture 16 of the trailer hitch tow bar.
      <br/>
      Further, the tow bar 12 is sandwiched between a conventional upper 42 and lower 44 tow bar tongue disposed on the front of the implement being towed.
      <br/>
      The elongated member 14 has an upper handle member 18, suitable for receiving the hand of a user, located on its upper end having a lock means 20 communicating with a rod handle cross member 26 passing from one side 22 of the handle 18 to the second side 24 having a rod handle cross member 26 thereon.
      <br/>
      Cross member 26 has a groove 45 on each of its ends for receiving and slidably connecting with sides 22, 24.
      <br/>
      Lock means 20 serves to space apart cross member 26 from handle member 18 so that when lock means 20 is unlocked by using a key and thereafter removed, cross member 26 is free to slide on groove 45 toward handle member 18, thereby allowing rod 28 to move outwardly toward handle member 18.
      <br/>
      Lock means 20 is of standard design as would be done by one skilled in the art and, also shown is an elongated rod member 28 which passes through a smaller bore 30 of the elongated member 14 which smaller bore 30 terminates into a larger bore being an inner chamber 32 within which bores 30, 32 rod 28 and plunger 40 reciprocate.
      <br/>
      Rod 28 has a coiled spring 34 disposed in chamber 32 which surrounds and runs longitudinally along rod 28 for tensioning and urging rod 28 and plunger 40 inwardly of the elongated member 14.
      <br/>
      Also shown are a pair of locking ball bearings 36 positioned in grooves or apertures 38 on the periphery of the elongated member 14 having a tapered plunger 40 on the inner bore 32 of the elongated member 14.
      <br/>
      Grooves 38 are tapered and have a slightly greater diameter toward the center of member 14 so that the balls 36 are held in the apertures 38 in such a manner which prohibits the balls 36 from falling out of apertures 38 due to the outer diameter of aperture 38 being slightly less than the diameter of balls 36.
      <br/>
      In the locked position, plunger 40 is positioned between balls 36 so as to urge balls 36 outwardly or laterally so that the distance from the outer edge of one ball 36 to the outer edge of the second ball 36 is slightly greater than the diameter of tow bar aperture 16 so that the elongated member 14 can not be removed from aperture 16 thus locking the trailer hitch 12 in place.
      <br/>
      Lock 20 is positioned between cross member 26 and top of handle 18 so as to keep rod 28 inwardly disposed relative to handle 18 and thus keep plunger 40 between balls 36 and the member 14 in the locked position.
    </p>
    <p num="22">
      Turning to FIG. 2, therein is shown a cutaway view of the present invention shown in the unlocked position.
      <br/>
      Shown are features disclosed in FIG. 1.
      <br/>
      However, the lock is removed so that handle 26 can be slidably moved toward the top of handle 18 thereby moving plunger 40 upwardly in cavity 32 thereby allowing balls 36 to move inwardly toward the center of elongated member 14 and thereby reducing the distance between the outer edges of the balls 36 to a distance slightly less than the diameter of aperture 16 which allows the elongated member 14 to be removed from aperture 16 allowing the tow bar 12 to be separated from tow bars 42, 44.
      <br/>
      Plunger 40 has a tapered portion 46 which terminates onto a pointed tip 48 forming a ball stop having a small diameter just large enough to keep balls 36 from falling through aperture 32.
    </p>
    <p num="23">
      Turning to FIG. 3, therein is shown a cutaway view of a second embodiment of the present invention.
      <br/>
      As can be seen, this embodiment is similar to that of FIGS. 1 and 2, except that instead of rod 28 having plunger 40 on its lower end, rod 28 has eye-like loop member 60 having and aperture 62 therein (see FIG. 5 for a better view).
      <br/>
      Furthermore, a pair of tab members 50 having pivots 52 thereon and further having a tang 54 thereon for contacting the underside of tow bar member 44 so as to prevent removal of elongated member 14 from the tow bar aperture 16.
      <br/>
      Tabs 50 each have a locking groove 56 in the upper end for receiving the upper part of aperture/loop 60 of rod 28 which serves to lock the tabs 50 in an extended or operative position for locking the hitch.
    </p>
    <p num="24">
      Turning to FIG. 4, therein is shown a cutaway view of a second embodiment of the present invention shown in an unlocked position.
      <br/>
      Shown are the features of FIG. 3 with the rod 28 moved upwardly due to the removal of lock 20.
      <br/>
      It can be seen that tabs 50 pivot inwardly toward the center of elongated member 14 thereby allowing removal of member 14 from aperture 16.
    </p>
    <p num="25">Turning to FIG. 5, therein is shown an elevation view of the rod 28 of the second embodiment having an eye-like, looped member 60 located on its lower end having an aperture 62 therein having an upper part 64 and a lower part 66.</p>
    <p num="26">
      Turning to FIG. 6, therein is shown a partial section view of a third embodiment of the present invention shown in the locked position.
      <br/>
      Shown is a slightly different design from FIGS. 3 and 4, wherein the tabs 50 do not have notch 56 for locking.
      <br/>
      Instead, the upper part 64 of looped member 60 is held in a lowered position between tabs 50 by spring 34 which keeps the tangs 54 in a locked position.
      <br/>
      Tabs 50 are released to the unlocked position when spring 34 in moved outwardly by rod 28 when cross member 26 is moved outwardly by the hand of the user.
