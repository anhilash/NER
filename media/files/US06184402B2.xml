    <p num="1">The present invention relates to a process for the preparation of metallocene complexes containing cyclopentadienyl rings as a ligand which are utilizable for the polymerization of olefins or the like.</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND ART</heading>
    <p num="2">
      It is known that in the polymerization of olefins, especially propylene, any of the a tactic polypropylene, isotactic polypropylene and syndiotactic polypropylene can be produced by choosing a ligand of a metallocene complex among uniform catalysts (a metallocene complex/aluminoxane) for polymerization of olefins (Makromol. Chem. Rapid. Commun. 1983, 4, 417-421; Angew.
      <br/>
      Chem., Int. Engl. 1985, 24, 507-508; J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1988, 110, 6255-6256; etc.)
    </p>
    <p num="3">
      Depending on the positions of substituents at the time of synthesis, metallocene complexes may permit the existence of stereoisomers.
      <br/>
      In the event a mixture of complex isomers formed on synthesis is straightforwardly used for polymerization of olefins where different olefin polymers are produced according to the different nature of the isomers, the resultant polymer will become a mixture of two different polymers.
      <br/>
      In case a uniform polymer is to be produced, therefore, the mixture of polymers has to be separated.
      <br/>
      Especially, a C2 symmetrical crosslinking type metallocene complex tends to form a racemic form and a meso form of isomers in a ratio of 1:1 on its synthesis.
      <br/>
      On polymerization of propylene, the use of the racemic form permits the production of isotactic polypropylene while the use of the meso form permits the production of atactic polypropylene.
      <br/>
      Hence, the meso form has to be eliminated in case of producing isotactic polypropylene alone.
      <br/>
      Separation of the recemic form and the meso form is usually carried out by extraction with a solvent and recrystallization.
      <br/>
      For obtaining a highly pure racemic form, however, repeating of the separation operations was necessary so that efficiency of the production was extremely low.

      This method pertains to changing of the racemic/meso ratio by decomposing either one of the isomers, and more precisely, the racemic form is decomposed with ethylene-bis(4,7-dimethylindenyl)zirconium dichloride to obtain the pure meso form.

    <heading>PROBLEMS TO BE SOLVED BY THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="6">It is an object of the present invention to provide a process for preparing metallocene complexes wherein stereoisomers of metallocene complexes formed on synthesis can easily be resolved into their isomers.</p>
    <heading>DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="7">
      As a result of extensive research made to achieve the aforesaid object, it has now been found by the inventors that a reaction for replacing a substituent on the central metal of a metallocene complex by M--O bond differs in reactivity according to the isomer, and a part or all of a specific isomer can be converted into a complex having M--O bond and that the complex having M--O bond is significantly different in solubility from the original metallocene complex so that the complex having M--O bond can easily be separated according to an ordinary separation method, e.g. extraction or recrystallization while purity of unreacted isomer can efficiently be increased.
      <br/>
      The present invention has been accomplished on the basis of the above finding.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      Especially for an isomeric mixture of the racemic form and the meso form of a bridged metllocene complex, a reaction for forming a  MU -oxo-complex is carried out whereby the meso form is preferentially converted into the  MU -oxo-complex.
      <br/>
      Thus, the purity of the racemic form can easily be increased by separating the  MU -oxo-complex thereform.
      <br/>
      If the total amount of the meso form is converted into the  MU -oxo-complex, the racemic form will be obtained in a higher purity.

      The substituents X's on the zirconium may be the same or different and each stands for a halogen atom, a halogenoid atomic group or a hydrocarbon group having 1-20 carbon atoms.

      Preferable is chlorine, bromine and iodine.
      <br/>
      Examples of the halogenoid atomic group include the grouping of NCS, NCO, N3, N(CN)2, C(CN)3, C(CN)2, and (NO).
      <br/>
      Examples of the hydrocarbon group having 1-20 carbon atoms include an alkyl group, a cycloalkyl group, an aryl group, an alkylaryl and an aralkyl group.
    </p>
    <p num="22">
      The substituents R1, R2, R3, R4, R5, R6, R7, R8, R9, and R10 may be the same or different and each independently stands for hydrogen, an alkyl group having having 1-20 carbon atoms, a cycloalkyl group having 3-20 carbon atoms, an alkenyl group having a 2-20 carbon atoms, an aryl group having 6-20 carbon atoms, an alkylaryl group having 7-20 carbon atoms, an aralkyl group having 7-20 carbon atoms which may contain oxygen, sulfur and nitrogen, or a monocyclic or polycyclic heteroaryl group which may contain a hetero atom or atoms selected from the group consisting of oxygen atoms, sulfur atoms and nitrogen atoms in the 5-membered or 6-membered ring or rings thereof and which may be substituted on the ring or rings thereof by other substituents.
      <br/>
      Illustrative of these groups are for example, methyl group, ethyl group, isopropyl group, tert-butyl group, cyclopentyl group, cyclohexyl group, vinyl group, allyl group, phenyl group, naphthyl group, tolyl group, dimethylphenyl group, benzyl group, phenylethyl group, trimethylsilyl group, trimethylgermyl group, furyl group, thienyl group, pyridyl group.
    </p>
    <p num="23">
      Any adjacent substituents on the cyclopentadienyl ring or rings may form a cyclic structure having 5-8 carbon atoms and the cyclic structure may be an aromatic ring.
      <br/>
      In case R1 and R2 are fused together to form an aromatic group as a cyclic structure having 6 carbon atoms, for example, it will become an indenyl ligand.
      <br/>
      The cyclic structure may have a substituent or substituents.
    </p>
    <p num="24">In the event a metallocene complex is converted into a  MU -oxo-complex, the starting complex wherein R3 and R6 are hydrogen and R2 and R7 are substituents other than hydrogen is easily convertible into the  MU -oxo-complex and so is preferable as it is higher in selectivity of isomers.</p>
    <p num="25">The substituents R9 and R10 in a bridging portion may form a cyclic structure having 4-8 carbon atoms wherein silicon, germanium, oxygen, sulfur and nitrogen may be contained.</p>
    <p num="26">
      An isomeric mixture of a metallocene complex of the formula (1) can be prepared, for example, according to the following process: A substituted cycloalkadiene having substituents R1-R4 is anionized by the reaction with a metal salt type base to form a substituted cycloalkadiene anion which is then reacted at a molar ratio of 1:1 with a substituted cycloalkadiene compound connected through (Y)n to (Y)n --(X1)2 wherein X1 stands for a hydrogen atom or a halogen atom, to form a compound wherein two cycloalkadienes are connected each other through Y. The latter compound is then reacted with a metal salt type base to form a dianion wherein each of the cycloalkadiene ring is anionized.
      <br/>
      The dianion is then reacted with a transition metal compound (X)2 --M--(X2)2 wherein X2 stands for a hydrogen atom or a halogen atom to obtain the isomeric mixture of a metallocne complex.
    </p>
    <p num="27">Examples of the complex having M--O bond include a compound wherein one of X's on M is substituted to form M--O--R (wherein R stands for hydrogen, an alkyl group having 1-20 carbon atoms, a cycloalkyl group having 3-20 carbon atoms, an alkenyl group having 2-20 carbon atoms, an aryl group having 6-20 carbon atoms. an alkylaryl group having 7-20 carbon atoms, an aralkyl group having 7-20 carbon atoms, with the proviso that these groups may contain silicon, germanium, oxygen, sulfur and nitrogen, or a monocyclic or polycyclic heteroaromatic group which may contain a hetero atom or atoms selected from the group consisting of oxygen atoms, sulfur atoms and nitrogen atoms in the 5-membered or 6-membered ring or rings thereof and which may be substituted on the ring or rings thereof by other substituents, for example, methyl group, ethyl group, isopropyl group, tertbutyl group, cyclopentyl group, cyclohexyl group, vinyl group, allyl group, phenyl group, naphthyl group, tolyl group, dimethylphenyl group, benzyl group, phenylethyl group, trimethylsilyl group, trimethylgermyl group, furyl group, thienyl group, pyridyl group), a compound wherein a central metal M is carried on a support such as silica gel through oxygen, and a  MU -oxo-complex wherein the central metals of two molecules of a metallocene complex is crosslinked via oxygen.</p>
    <p num="28">As a means for converting a part of isomeric mixture of a metallocene complex shown by the formula (1), there can be mentioned a process wherein the isomeric mixture is reacted with ROH, ROLi, or RONa, a process wherein the isomeric mixture is reacted with a silica gel the surface of which has been modified with --OLi or --ONa, and a process wherein the isomeric mixture is reacted with water to form a  MU -oxo-complex.</p>
    <p num="29">Especially preferable is a process wherein the reaction is intended to form a  MU -oxo-complex, since it is higher in selectivity of the isomer and is easy for separation.</p>
    <p num="30">
      Selectivity of isomers depends chiefly on the reactivity of X so that an isomer having X of less steric hindrance is preferentially reacted to form a complex having M--O bond.
      <br/>
      This fact will be explained, for example, in connection with the reaction for a mixture of a racemic form and a meso form of dimethylsilylene-bis(2,3,5-trimethylcyclopentadienyl)zirconium dichloride to prepare a  MU -oxo-complex.
      <br/>
      In case of the racemic form, both chlorines are equivalent and only one 3-methyl group is present in the vicinity of each chorine.
      <br/>
      In the case of the meso form, on the other hand, two methyl groups are present in either of chlorine atoms but the other chlorine is less steric hindrance of 3-methyl group.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, when water is reacted with the mixture, water is preferentially reacted with chlorine of less steric hindrance in the meso form to afford a  MU -oxo-complex.
    </p>
    <p num="31">
      The reaction for forming a  MU -oxo-complex chiefly due to the reaction of water with a metallocene compound is well known and a  MU -oxo-complex is easily obtained.
      <br/>
      In case of a metallocene dihalide wherein a halogen is a substituent on the central metal, it is necessary in majority of the cases to react the metallocene complex with water in the presence of a base.
    </p>
    <p num="32">
      No limitation exists in the amount of water to be reacted with an isomeric mixture but it is preferable that 0.01-10 equiamount of water is preferable for an isomeric mixture to be converted into the  MU -oxo-complex.
      <br/>
      In case either one of the isomers is to be eliminated entirely, however, at least 0.5 equimolar water will be necessary for an isomeric mixture to be converted into a  MU -oxo-complex.
      <br/>
      Further, it is necessary to consider the amount of water or moisture existent in the air, reagents and solvents.
      <br/>
      In case the reaction is carried out with a small amount of a metallocene complex, the reaction proceeds with water present in the air, reagents or solvents so that it is sometimes unnecessary to add water.
    </p>
    <p num="33">
      A temperature for the reaction is such that the metallocene complex used is not decomposed.
      <br/>
      Thus, the temperature is preferably within the range of -80 (degree)  C. to 80 (degree)  C.
    </p>
    <p num="34">
      No limitation exists in the reaction solvent so far as the metallocene complex used is not decomposed.

      Examples of the solvent include chloroform, dichloromethane, hexane, toluene, diethyl ether, tetrahydrofuran (THF), etc.

      No special limitation exists in the amount of the basic substance used but 0.01-10 equiamount, preferably 0.8-1.2 equiamount of the basic substance is used for a metallocene complex to be converted into a  MU -oxo-complex.
    </p>
    <p num="39">
      After converting a part of the isomeric mixture of a metallocene complex into a complex having M--O bond, unreacted isomer is obtained by removing the complex having M--O bond.
      <br/>
      An ordinary separation method, such as extraction with a solvent or recrystallization can be used for this separation.
      <br/>
      As extraction with a solvent, the reaction liquid is dried until dryness and the residue is extracted with a solvent and the solution is stirred and filtered, or a continuous extraction using a Soxlet extractor may be mentioned.
      <br/>
      Mentioned as the recrystallization method, the reaction mixture is dissolved with a solvent and the solution is cooled or mixed with a poor solvent to precipitate crystals which are then separated.
    </p>
    <p num="40">Illustrative of the solvent are, for example, pentane, hexane, toluene. dichoromethane, THF, diethyl ether, diisopropyl ether, and a mixture of these solvents.</p>
    <p num="41">As a  MU -oxo-complex is especially inferior in solubility to the starting metallocene complex, the former can easily be removed by extraction with a solvent.</p>
    <p num="42">
      As a general property of a  MU -oxo-complex, it undergoes reaction with a proton reagent to split off the --O-bridge.
      <br/>
      In case X in the resultant  MU -oxo-complex is a halogen, therefore, the separated  MU -oxo-complex is reacted with HX to split off the --O-bridge thereby regenerating the original metallocene complex.
      <br/>
      It follows that an isomeric form of a metallocene which was once converted into the  MU -oxo-complex from the isomeric mixture can also be obtained in a high purity.

      In a 500 ml reaction vessel made of glass were placed 4.6 g (11 mmole) of an isomeric mixture of dimethylsilylene-bis(2,3,5-trimethylcyclopentadienyl)zirconium dichloride (the racemic form/the meso form=50/50) and 170 ml of toluene, and the content was cooled down to -10 (degree)  C. in a dry ice-methanol bath.
      <br/>
      To the mixture was added dropwise a solution of 0.46 g (6 mmole) of diethylamine in 20 ml of toluene, and then added 0.5 g (3 mmole) of water.
    </p>
    <p num="49">
      The dry ice-methanol bath was removed and the mixture was stirred as such for 18 hours at room temperature.

      To the mixture was added dropwise 0.73 ml (0.12 mole/l) of a solution of 0.277 mol/l) of triethylamine in toluene at room temperature, and the mixture was stirred as such for 18 hours.
    </p>
    <p num="81">
      The solvent was concentrated under reduced pressure, and 10 ml of toluene was added to the mixture which was then allowed to stand overnight and filtered.
      <br/>
      The residue on the filter was an  MU -oxo-complex and triethylamine hydrochloride.
    </p>
    <p num="82">
      The solvent of the filtrate was distilled off under reduced pressure, and toluene was added to dissolve the residue, and thereafter hexane was added, cooled down to -20 (degree)  C. and allowed to stand for one day.
      <br/>
      The precipitated crystals were collected by filtration, washed with hexane and dried to obtain 170 mg (yield: 37%) of dimethylsilylene-bis�2-(2-furyl)-3,5-dimethylcyclopentadienyl�zirconium dichloride (the recemic form/the meso form=97/3) as light yellow crystals.
      <br/>
      A result of an NMR measurement and an elementary analysis of the  MU -oxo-complex is shown in Table 1.
