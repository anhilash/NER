    <p num="8">Beta Ratio</p>
    <p num="9">
      Processing of a polysilicon load SRAM is easy and the cell is the smallest in size, which are both factors which reduce manufacturing cost.
      <br/>
      But the problem is to to produce an SRAM device which has a high enough Beta ratio ( BETA =Ipull-down /Ipass-gate) within finite dimensions in the deep-submicron regime.
      <br/>
      Using conventional approaches, the yield obtained is too marginal.
      <br/>
      The Beta ratio is generally about 3.5 to achieve better cell stability.
    </p>
    <p num="10">The pass-gate transistor of an SRAM cell is implemented by an extra implant of dopant, such as boron (B11), to form a halo structure.</p>
    <p num="11">
      This invention increases the Beta ratio in an SRAM cell to obtain high cell operation stability.
      <br/>
      It makes it possible to reduce the channel length of the pass-gate transistors without impacting the Beta ratio to obtain a smaller cell size or increase the width of pull-down transistor to obtain a wider field isolation process (such as a LOCOS) window.
      <br/>
      It also makes it possible to suppress the Ioff current of a pass-gate transistor.
      <br/>
      The present invention shows a method of implanting boron to form a halo structure in a pass-gate transistor of an SRAM cell.

    <p num="23">
      FIG. 1 is the process flow chart for the steps employed to produce a pass transistor in accordance with this invention.
      <br/>
      Referring to the SRAM schematic circuit seen in FIG. 2, the pass transistor Q4 is exemplary of type of pass transistor which is provided for an SRAM cell.
      <br/>
      FIGS. 3A-3G show cross sections of various stages of manufacture of portions of a CMOS cell 8 including an SRAM cell in accordance with this invention.
    </p>
    <p num="24">
      In particular, referring again to FIG. 1 and FIGS. 3A-3G, the processing steps are described below.
      <br/>
      The results of steps 1-4 are shown in FIG. 3A.
    </p>
    <p num="25">1. Well formation</p>
    <p num="26">
      Referring to step 60 in FIG. 1, FIG. 3A shows a device 8 in a very early stage in the process of manufacture which includes a N-doped silicon semiconductor substrate 10 in which a set of wells including a P-well 11 and an N-well 15 have been formed. P-well 11 is prepared for the manufacture of an SRAM cell 9 including the site prepared for a pull down transistor 50 and the site prepared for a pass transistor 52 to be formed in P-well 11.
      <br/>
      Device 8 as shown in FIG. 3A also includes the site prepared for a future peripheral PMOS transistor 54 which is also in an early stage of manufacture.
      <br/>
      The P-well 11 was doped with a concentration of boron dopant from about 1 E 16 atoms/cm3 to about 1 E 17 atoms/cm3 by the process of ion implantation.
      <br/>
      The N-well 15 was doped with a conventional N type dopant to a conventional level, as will be well understood by those skilled in the art.
    </p>
    <p num="27">2. Field Isolation Formation</p>
    <p num="28">In step 62, in FIG. 1 field isolation is provided in the form of field oxide (FOX) regions 12 formed on the surface of device 8 as shown in FIG. 3A by the steps of forming a silicon nitride mask (not shown) with openings for patterning the regions 12 followed by thermal oxidation through the openings to form silicon oxide field oxide (FOX) regions 12.</p>
    <p num="29">The FOX regions 12 frame the sites of pull down transistor 50, pass transistor 52 and peripheral PMOS transistor 54, with one FOX region 12 located at the interface between P-well 11 and N-well 15.</p>
    <p num="30">Then, after formation of the FOX regions 12, the silicon nitride mask is stripped.</p>
    <p num="31">3. Vt Implant</p>
    <p num="32">In step 64, in FIG. 1 there is a maskless threshold voltage adjustment made in the future channel regions of P-well 11 and N-well 15 by the steps of ion implantation of BF2 dopant from about 1 E 12 ions/cm2 to about 1 E 13 ions/cm2 at an energy from about 15 keV to about 50 keV, resulting in a concentration of boron (B) dopant from about 1 E 17 atoms/cm3 to about 1 E 18 atoms/cm3.</p>
    <p num="33">4. Gate oxidation</p>
    <p num="34">In step 66, a gate oxide (silicon oxide) layer 14 is formed over the surface of P-well 11 and N-well 15, as shown in FIG. 3A. Gate oxide (silicon oxide) layer 14 has a thickness from about 40  Angstrom  to about 200  Angstrom , and layer 14 is formed by thermal oxidation using conventional processing apparatus and parameters, as will be well understood by those skilled in the art.</p>
    <p num="35">5. Polysilicon Layer (Gate) Formation</p>
    <p num="36">Referring to FIG. 3B, in step 68, a blanket doped polysilicon layer 16 with a thickness from about 1,000  Angstrom  to about 3,000  Angstrom  was formed over the gate oxide layer 14 by the steps of in-situ deposition of doped polysilicon.</p>
    <p num="37">Then polysilicon layer 16 was patterned by photoresist mask PR1 and etched into a set of electrically conductive, gate electrode 16A for pull down transistor 50 and gate electrode 16B for pass transistor 52 respectively in P-well 11 and gate electrode 16C in N-well 15 for transistor 54 as shown in FIG. 3B. Gate electrode 16A of pull down transistor 50 and gate electrode 16B of pass transistor 52 are formed on opposite sides of a FOX region 12.</p>
    <p num="38">The photoresist mask PR1 was then stripped from the device, as seen in FIG. 3C.</p>
    <p num="39">6. Post Etching Anneal</p>
    <p num="40">Referring again to FIG. 3C, in step 70, after photoresist mask PR1 was stripped from the device 8, the device 8 was annealed at a temperature from about 800 (degree)  C. to about 900 (degree)  C. for a time from about 30 minutes to about 60 minutes for the purpose of annealing the polysilicon etching damage.</p>
    <p num="41">7. N Channel LDD Photolithography/Implant</p>
    <p num="42">
      In step 72, as shown in FIG. 3C, an N-type LDD mask PR2 (with windows 18" therethrough) has been formed over the N-well 15 and the cell 8 in P-well 11 of FIG. 3B is being being ion implanted with N type dopant 18' for all NMOS transistors such as those to be formed in P-well 11 as well as the region on the right of mask PR2.
      <br/>
      During this step, second photoresist mask PR2 protects the N-well 15 from being doped with the N-type dopant 18'. The N-LDD regions 18 in P-well 11 are ion implanted with a dose of phosphorus N type dopant from about 1 E 13 ions/cm2 to about 1 E 14 ions/cm2 at an energy from about 20 keV to about 80 keV.
      <br/>
      After annealing, the phosphorus dopant in N type LDD regions 18 had a concentration from about 1 E 18 atoms/cm3 to about 1 E 19 atoms/cm3.
      <br/>
      Aside from the FOX regions 12, the N-LDD regions are self-aligned with the gate electrodes 16A and 16B.
    </p>
    <p num="43">8. Pass-Gate Photolithography/Implant</p>
    <p num="44">
      In step 74, referring to FIG. 3D, the device of FIG. 3C is shown during performance of a gate transistor halo implant of boron B11 into regions 20 self-aligned with pass gate electrode 16A of pull-down transistor 50; and gate 16B of pass transistor 52 (which transistor 52 represents both of the transistors Q3 and Q4 in FIG. 2) to form boron doped halo implant regions 20.
      <br/>
      The regions 20 extend below the LDD regions 18 below the pass gate 16B in cell 9 of FIG. 3C as shown in FIG. 3D. Halo implant mask PR3 is formed with openings 20" only for the Q3 and Q4 pass transistors 52 in the SRAM cell.
      <br/>
      The halo regions 20 are ion implanted with a dose of boron (B11) dopant ions 20' in a range from about 1 E 13 ions/cm2 to about 1 E 14 ions/cm2 at an energy from about 20 keV to about 80 keV.
      <br/>
      After annealing, the boron (B11) dopant in halo regions 20 has a concentration of boron (B11) dopant from about 1 E 18 atoms/cm3 to about 1 E 19 atoms/cm3.
    </p>
    <p num="45">Then the mask PR3 is stripped from the device 8.</p>
    <p num="46">9. P Channel LDD Photolithography/Implant</p>
    <p num="47">
      Referring to FIG. 3E which shows the product of FIG. 3D after the halo implant has been completed and during step 76 in which a mask PR4 is formed over device 8 with a window 28" exposing the peripheral PMOS transistor 54.
      <br/>
      P type dopant 28' is being being ion implanted through window 28" to form P-type LDD regions 28 self-aligned with gate electrode 16C for all PMOS transistors to be formed in N-well 15.
      <br/>
      The conventional P-type LDD photoresist mask PR4 protects the P-type well 11 from doping with P-type dopant 28'. The P-type LDD regions 28 are ion implanted with a dose of BF2 dopant from about 1 E 13 ions/cm2 to about 1 E 14 ions/cm2 at an energy from about 10 keV to about 50 keV.
      <br/>
      After annealing, the boron dopant in the P type LDD regions has a concentration of boron dopant from about 1 E 18 atoms/cm3 to about 1 E 19 atoms/cm3.
    </p>
    <p num="48">Then the mask PR4 is stripped from the device 8.</p>
    <p num="49">10. Spacer Formation Peripheral</p>
    <p num="50">In step 78, silicon dioxide spacers 21 are formed adjacent to the sidewalls of the gate electrodes 16A, 16B and 16C. as shown in FIG. 3F of all three transistor devices 50, 52 and 54.</p>
    <p num="51">11. N+ Source/Drain Photolithography/Implant</p>
    <p num="52">
      In step 80, a mask PR5 is formed over the peripheral transistor devices 54 in N-well 15.
      <br/>
      There are windows 36" over the P-well 11 and aside from the N-well 15.
      <br/>
      N type dopant 36' is implanted into the the P-well 11 to form self-aligned source/drain regions 36 for each NMOS transistor 50 and 52.
    </p>
    <p num="53">
      The N type source/drain regions 36 are ion implanted with a dose of arsenic dopant from about 5 E 14 ions/cm2 to about 5 E 15 ions/cm2 at an energy from about 20 kev to about 60 keV.
      <br/>
      After annealing, source/drain regions 36 had a concentration of N type arsenic dopant from about 1 E 19 atoms/cm3 to about 1 E 20 atoms/cm3.
    </p>
    <p num="54">
      Then the mask PR5 is stripped from the device 8.
      <br/>
      The LDD regions 18' remain below the spacers 31 for both pull down transistor 50 and pass transistor 52, and in the case of pass transistor 52, the halo regions 20 remain below the LDD regions 18'.
    </p>
    <p num="55">12. P+Source/Drain Photolithography/Implant</p>
    <p num="56">
      In step 82 a mask PR6 is formed covering device 8 with a window over N-well 15.
      <br/>
      P type dopant 38' is implanted into the N-well 15 to form the P+ source/drain regions 38 of each PMOS device 54.
