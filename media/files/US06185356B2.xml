      <br/>
      A protective cover for protecting a lighting device from direct contact with contaminants or components which may interfere with proper operation thereof.
      <br/>
      The contaminant (e.g., blood, body tissue, dirt, oil, grease, paint, etc.) or other component (e.g., adhesive pad) can interfere with the desired internal reflection of the light propogating through a light transmitting member, by changing the angle of reflection of the propagating light.
      <br/>
      The result is that optical energy is absorbed by the contaminant or component and converted to heat, thus causing the contaminant or component to quickly rise to an undesirable temperature.
      <br/>
      The present invention protects a lighting device from such interference, while maintaining its versatility.

    <heading>FIELD OF INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">The present invention relates generally to a protective cover, and more particularly to a protective cover for protecting a lighting device from direct contact with contaminants or components which may interfere with proper operation thereof.</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="3">
      A common source of light for a light delivery system has been large stationary light generators, such as a 300 Watt Xenon light generator.
      <br/>
      A long light pipe or cable is used to connect the stationary light generator with a hand-held light delivery system.
      <br/>
      The light delivery system is suitably attached to an associated instrument or tool, or may form an integral part of the instrument or tool.
      <br/>
      However, the stationary light generators have some significant drawbacks.
      <br/>
      First, they are often costly.
      <br/>
      Institutions, such as hospitals, are reluctant to make such purchases, thus limiting the number of available light sources.
      <br/>
      Second, the stationary light generators are not portable, and thus limit the range of movement of the associated instrument or tool.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, the use of a stationary light generator prevents the associated instrument or tool from being a fully self-contained device.
      <br/>
      In this respect, it may be desirable to dispose of devices used in a surgical operation to prevent contamination.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      It has also been recognized that typical light sources are relatively high-powered (e.g., 300 Watts).
      <br/>
      These high-powered sources of electrical energy provide the light that in turn is carried by a light distributor, such as a light pipe.
      <br/>
      If a contaminant (e.g., blood, dirt, etc.) or other component (e.g., adhesive pad) is in direct contact with the light distributor, it may interfere with the desired internal reflection of the light propagating through the light distributor.
      <br/>
      The contaminant or component changes the angle of reflection of light traveling through the light distributor.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, the optical energy is absorbed by the contaminant or component, and converted to heat.
      <br/>
      Consequently, the contaminant or component may quickly heat up to an undesirable temperature.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, there is a need to protect a lighting device from such interference, while maintaining its versatility.
    </p>
    <p num="5">The present invention overcomes these and other disadvantages of prior art lighting devices.</p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="6">According to the present invention there is provided a protective cover or coating for shielding a light distributor from contact with contaminants or components associated with a lighting device.</p>
    <p num="7">An advantage of the present invention is the provision of a protective cover that prevents contaminants from interfering with the desired internal reflection of light propagating through a light distributor.</p>
    <p num="8">Another advantage of the present invention is the provision of a protective cover that prevents components for attaching accessory devices from interfering with the desired internal reflection of light propagating through a light distributor.</p>
    <p num="9">Still another advantage of the present invention is the provision of a protective cover that prevents contaminants and/or associated components from attenuating light traveling through a light distributor.</p>
    <p num="10">Yet another advantage of the present invention is the provision of a protective cover that prevents contaminants and/or associated components from heating up to an undesirable temperature level.</p>
    <p num="11">Still other advantages of the invention will become apparent to those skilled in the art upon a reading and understanding of the following detailed description, accompanying drawings and appended claims.</p>

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading>
    <p num="13">
      Referring now to the drawings wherein the showings are for the purposes of illustrating a preferred embodiment of the invention only and not for purposes of limiting same, FIGS. 4A and 4B illustrate a suction/blower device 100 having an externally mounted light delivery system 2.
      <br/>
      FIG. 4A shows a light delivery system 2 detached from suction/blower device 100, while FIG. 4B shows light delivery system 2 attached to suction/blower device 100.
      <br/>
      It should be appreciated that device 100 can take many forms including a surgical instrument or a conventional hand tool, as will be illustrated below.
    </p>
    <p num="14">
      Light delivery system 2 is generally comprised of a light emitter 10, a light distributor 60, and an attachment means 80.
      <br/>
      Light emitter 10 focuses light of varying intensity in a predetermined direction or pattern.
      <br/>
      As a result, an associated viewing field is illuminated with a predetermined light characteristic.
      <br/>
      Light distributor 60 (e.g., optic light pipe) transmits light from a light source 90 to light emitter 10.
      <br/>
      Attachment means 80 provides a support structure for coupling light delivery system 2 to device 100.
      <br/>
      In this regard, attachment means 80 may include tabs, hooks or the like.
    </p>
    <p num="15">
      Light emitter 10 is comprised of a transparent or translucent light emitting material of any suitable type, including acrylic, polycarbonate, glass, epoxy, resins or the like.
      <br/>
      Emitter 10 may be substantially flat, suitably curved, may be formed of single or multiple layers, and may have different thicknesses and shapes.
      <br/>
      Moreover, emitter 10 may be flexible, or rigid, and may be made out of a variety of compounds.
      <br/>
      It should also be appreciated that emitter 10 may be hollow, filled with liquid, air, or be solid, and may have holes or ridges formed therein.
    </p>
    <p num="16">
      Means for directing light in desired directions and patterns, and providing various light intensity levels will now be described with reference to FIGS. 1 and 2, which show a section B of light emitter 10.
      <br/>
      Light extracting formations including deformities, disruptions, coatings, patterns or lenses, may be provided on one or more selected light surface areas 20 on one or more sides 21 or edges 23 of emitter 10.
      <br/>
      As used herein, the term light extracting formation is to mean any change in the shape or geometry of the surface and/or coating or surface treatment that causes a portion of the light to be emitted.
      <br/>
      FIG. 3A schematically shows one such light surface area 20 on which a pattern of light extracting deformities or disruptions 22 is provided.
      <br/>
      The pattern of light extracting deformities or disruptions 22 shown in FIG. 3A includes a variable pattern which breaks up the light rays such that the internal angle of reflection of a portion of the light rays will be great enough to cause the light rays either to be emitted out of emitter 10 through the side or sides on which the light extracting deformities or disruptions 22 are provided or reflected back through the emitter 10 and emitted out the other side thereof.
    </p>
    <p num="17">
      Light extracting formations can be produced in a variety of manners, for example, by providing a painted pattern, an etched pattern, a machined pattern, a printed pattern, a hot stamped pattern, a molded pattern, a curved surface (i.e., lens), a diffraction grating, a prismatic surface or the like on selected light surface areas 20 of emitter 10.
      <br/>
      An ink or printed pattern may be applied for example by pad printing, silk screening, ink jet, heat transfer film process or the like.
      <br/>
      The deformities or disruptions may also be printed on a sheet or film which is used to apply the deformities or disruptions to light surface area 20.
      <br/>
      This sheet or film may become a permanent part of emitter 10 for example by attaching or otherwise positioning the sheet or film against one or both sides of the emitter light surface area similar to the sheet or film 24 shown in FIGS. 1 and 2 in order to produce a desired effect.
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      By varying the density, opaqueness or translucence, shape, depth, color, area, index of refraction, diffraction grating, or type of light extracting formations, the light output of emitter 10 can be controlled.
      <br/>
      The light extracting formations may be used to control the direction and/or percent of light emitted from any area of emitter 10.
      <br/>
      For instance, less and/or smaller size deformities 22 may be placed on emitter 10 in areas where less light output is wanted.
      <br/>
      Conversely, a greater percentage of and/or larger deformities 22 may be placed on emitter 10 in areas where greater light output is desired.
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      Varying the percentages and/or size of deformities 22 in different areas of emitter 10 is necessary in order to provide a uniform light output distribution.
      <br/>
      For example, the amount of light traveling through light emitter 10 will ordinarily be greater in areas closer to the light source than in other areas further removed from the light source.
      <br/>
      A pattern of light extracting deformities 22 may be used to adjust the light variances within the emitter, for example, by providing a denser concentration of light extracting deformities with increased distance from the light source thereby resulting in a more uniform light output distribution from light emitter 10.
      <br/>
      The deformities 22 may also be used to control the output ray angle distribution of the emitted light to suit a particular application.
    </p>
    <p num="20">
      It should be appreciated that other light extracting formations are suitably provided in addition to or in lieu of the patterns of light extracting deformities 22 shown in FIG. 3A. As indicated above, other light extracting formations include lenses, prismatic surfaces, depressions or raised surfaces of various shapes using more complex shapes in a mold pattern may be molded, etched, stamped, thermoformed, hot stamped or the like into or on one or more surface areas (e.g., sides and edges) of the light emitter.
      <br/>
      Lenses (e-g., pillow lenses) can be used to provide diffuse light (by spreading light rays) and directional light (by focusing light rays).
      <br/>
      FIGS. 3B and 3C show areas 26 on which prismatic surfaces 28 or depressions 30 are formed in the emitter surface area, whereas FIG. 3D shows prismatic or other reflective or refractive surfaces 32 formed on the exterior of the emitter surface area.
      <br/>
      The prismatic surfaces, depressions or raised surfaces will cause a portion of the light rays contacted thereby to be emitted from the light emitter.
      <br/>
      Also, the angles of the prisms, depressions or other surfaces may be varied to direct the light in different directions to produce a desired light output distribution or effect, or to project a spot image or pattern of light to a specific area or region.
      <br/>
      Moreover, the reflective or refractive surfaces may have shapes or a pattern with no specific angles to reduce moire or other interference effects.
      <br/>
      In addition, the light rays emitted from the emitter may provide generally shadowless or homogenous light.
      <br/>
      In this regard, the emitter may simultaneously illuminate a 3-D object from a plurality of sides.
    </p>
    <p num="21">
      As best seen in the cross-sectional view of FIG. 2, a back reflector 34 (including trans reflectors) may be attached or positioned against one side of the panel member 14 of FIG. 1 using a suitable adhesive 36 or other method in order to improve light output efficiency of light emitter 10 by reflecting the light emitted from that side back through the panel for emission through the opposite side.
      <br/>
      Additionally, a pattern of light extracting deformities 22, 28, 30 and/or 32 may be provided on one or both sides of the light emitter in order to change the path of the light so that the internal critical angle is exceeded and a portion of the light is emitted from one or both sides of the light emitter.
      <br/>
      Moreover, a transparent film, sheet or plate member 24 may be attached or positioned against the side or sides of the emitter from which light is emitted using a suitable adhesive 36 or other method in order to produce a desired effect.
    </p>
    <p num="22">
      Member 24 may be used to further improve the uniformity of the light output distribution.
      <br/>
      For example, member 24 may be a colored film, a diffuser, or a label or display, a portion of which may be a transparent overlay that may be colored and/or have text or an image thereon.
    </p>
    <p num="23">
      If adhesive 36 is used to adhere the back reflector 34 and/or film 24 to the emitter, the adhesive is preferably applied only along the side edges of the emitter, and if desired the end edge opposite light transition areas, but not over the entire surface area or areas of the emitter because of the difficulty in consistently applying a uniform coating of adhesive to the panel.
      <br/>
      Also, the adhesive changes the internal critical angle of the light in a less controllable manner than the air gaps 40 (see FIG. 2) which are formed between the respective surfaces of the emitter and the back reflector 34 and/or member 24 when only adhered along the peripheral edges.
      <br/>
      Additionally, longer emitters are achievable when air gaps 40 are used.
      <br/>
      If adhesive were to be used over the entire surface, the pattern of deformities could be adjusted to account for the additional attenuation in the light caused by the adhesive.
    </p>
    <p num="24">
      The light emitter disclosed herein may be used for a great many different applications including for example LCD back lighting or lighting in general, decorative and display lighting, automotive lighting, dental lighting, phototherapy, photodynamic therapy, or other medical lighting, membrane switch lighting, and sporting goods and apparel lighting or the like.
      <br/>
      Also the emitter may be formed such that the deformities are transparent without a back reflector.
      <br/>
      This allows the emitter to be used such that the application is viewed through the transparent emitter.
    </p>
    <p num="25">The light that is transmitted by light distributor 60 to light emitter 10 may be emitted along the entire length of light emitter 10 or from one or more light output areas along the length of the panel as desired to produce a desired light output distribution to fit a particular application.</p>
    <p num="26">
      Light distributor 60 is a formed light conduit adapted to propagate light therethrough via internal reflection.
      <br/>
      In the embodiment illustrated in FIGS. 4A and 4B, light distributor 60 takes the form of an optic light pipe.
      <br/>
      Light distributor 60 includes an interface 64 and a connecting member 62.
      <br/>
      Interface 64 interfaces light distributor 60 with light emitter 10.

      As indicated above, a protective outer sleeve may cover a light transmitting member (e.g., light distributor or light emitter).

      The purpose of this protective cover is to prevent (1) contaminants (such as blood, body tissue, dirt, oil, grease, paint, etc.); (2) other components (such as adhesive pads, labels, hooks, etc.); or (3) any other material or structure than can cause attenuation, from directly contacting the light transmitting member and preventing proper operation thereof.
      <br/>
      In this regard, the protective cover allows light to pass through the light transmitting member with minimal disturbance to internal reflection of light travelling therethrough.
      <br/>
      When contaminants or components are in direct contact with the light transmitting member, they interfere with the proper internal reflection within the light transmitting member.
      <br/>
      In particular, the angle of reflection of light travelling through the light transmitting member is changed.
      <br/>
      In the case where there is no air gap, or virtually no air gap between the contaminant/components and the surface of the light transmitting member, optical energy of the light propagating through the light transmitting member (e.g., originating from a 300 Watt light source) is absorbed by the contaminant.

      Thus, a lighting device may include a protective cover that allows some portions of the light transmitting member to emit light or "glow," while preventing other portions of the light transmitting member from emitting light or "glowing." For example, the protective cover may be suitably configured with an opaque section corresponding to one side of a light transmitting member, and with a transparent or translucent section corresponding to the other side of the light transmitting member.
      <br/>
      In addition, a reflective material may be used as a back-deflector to reflect light as it is traveling through the light transmitting member.
