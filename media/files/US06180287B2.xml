      A solid polymer electrolyte obtained by blending (1) a polyether copolymer having a main chain, which is derived form ethylene oxide, and a side chain having two oligooxyethylene groups, (2) an electrolyte salt compound, and, if necessary, (3) a plasticizer which is any one of an aprotic organic solvent or a derivative or metal salt of a polyalkylene glycol having a number-average molecular weight of 200 to 5,000 or a metal salt of the derivative, is superior in ionic conductivity and also superior in processability, moldability and mechanical strength to a conventional solid electrolyte.
      <br/>
      A secondary battery is constructed by using the solid polymer electrolyte in combination with a lithium metal negative electrode and a lithium cobaltate positive electrode.

    <heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="1">
      The present invention relates to a polyether copolymer and a solid polymer electrolyte.
      <br/>
      More particularly, it relates to a solid polymer electrolyte which is suitable as a material for an electrochemical device such as a battery, a capacitor and a sensor.
    </p>
    <heading>RELATED ART</heading>
    <p num="2">
      As an electrolyte constituting an electrochemical device such as a battery, a capacitor and a sensor, those in the form of a solution or a paste have hitherto been used in view of the ionic conductivity.
      <br/>
      However, the following problems are pointed out.
      <br/>
      That is, there is a fear of damage of an apparatus arising due to liquid leakage, and subminiaturization and thinning of the device are limited because a separator to be impregnated with an electrolyte solution is required.
      <br/>
      To the contrary, a solid electrolyte such as inorganic crystalline substance, inorganic glass and organic polymer substance is suggested.
      <br/>
      The organic polymer substance is generally superior in processability and moldability and the resulting solid electrolyte has good flexibility and bending processability and, furthermore, the design freedom of the device to be applied is high and, therefore, the development is expected.
      <br/>
      However, the organic polymer substance is inferior in ionic conductivity to other materials at present.
      <br/>
      For example, a trial of containing a specific alkaline metal salt in a mixture of an epichlorohydrin rubber and a low-molecular weight polyethylene glycol derivative and applying the resultant to a solid polymer electrolyte is suggested in Japanese Patent Kokai Publication No. 235957/1990 including the present applicant, but a practically sufficient conductivity value is not still obtained.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, a solid polymer electrolyte prepared by crosslinking a polymeric compound which has been described in Japanese Patent Kokai Publication Nos. 47833/1991 and 68064/1992 shows a comparatively good ionic conductivity within the practical temperature range, but those having more excellent mechanical characteristics and ionic conductivity are required.

      The polyether copolymer optionally comprises (C) a repeating unit derived from a monomer having one epoxy group and at least one reactive functional group.
      <br/>
      A crosslinked material can be derived from the polyether copolymer having the repeating unit (C) by utilizing the reactivity of the reactive functional group.
    </p>
    <p num="15">
      The copolymer used in the present invention may be crosslinked or not crosslinked.
      <br/>
      Examples of a crosslinking agent for crosslinking a binary copolymer having the repeating unit (I') and the repeating unit (II') specifically include isocyanate compounds such as 2,4-tolylene diisocyanate, 2,6-tolylene diisocyanate, 4,4-diphenylmethane diisocyanate and hexamethylene diisocyanate.
    </p>
    <p num="16">The repeating unit (C) derived from a monomer of the formula (III-1) or (III-2) is represented by the formula (III'-1) or (III'-2):  (Chemical Structure image '5' not included in text)</p>
    <p num="17">wherein R3 and R4 represent a reactive functional group-containing group.</p>
    <p num="18">The reactive functional group in the repeating unit (C) is preferably (a) a reactive silicon group, (b) an epoxy group, (c) an ethylenically unsaturated group, or (d) a halogen atom.</p>
    <p num="19">The polymerization method of the polyether copolymer, which may have a crosslinkable side chain, of the present invention is the polymerization method wherein a copolymer is obtained by a ring opening reaction of ethylene oxide portion and can be conducted in the same manner as that described in Japanese Patent Kokai Publication Nos. 154736/1988 and 169823/1987 filed by the present applicant.</p>
    <p num="20">
      The polymerization reaction can be conducted as follows.
      <br/>
      That is, the polyether copolymer can be obtained by reacting the respective monomers at the reaction temperature of 10 to 80 (degree)  C. under stirring, using a catalyst mainly containing an organoaluminum, a catalyst mainly containing an organozinc, an organotin-phosphate ester condensate catalyst and the like as a ring opening polymerization catalyst in the presence or absence of a solvent.
      <br/>
      Among of them, the organotin-phosphate ester condensate catalyst is particularly preferable in view of the polymerization degree, or properties of the resulting copolymer and the like.
      <br/>
      In the polymerization reaction, the reactive functional group does not react so that a copolymer having the reaction functional group is obtained.
      <br/>
      When an oxirane compound having an epoxy group at only the both ends is used, an only epoxy group containing no substituent such as no methyl group is used for polymerization and an epoxy group containing a methyl group remains in the polymer without any reaction.
    </p>
    <p num="21">
      In the polyether copolymer of the present invention, the content of the repeating unit (A) is from 0.5 to 99% by mol, e.g. from 3 to 99% by mol, particularly from 10 to 95% by mol, and especially from 10 to 80% by mol; the content of the repeating unit (B) is from 99.5 to 1% by mol, e.g. from 95 to 1% by mol, particularly from 90 to 5% by mol, and specifically from 80 to 5% by mol; and the content of the repeating unit (C) is from 0 to 15% by mol, e.g. 0 to 10% by mol, preferably from 0 to 5% by mol, and particularly 0.001 to 5% by mol.
      <br/>
      When the content of the repeating unit (B) exceeds 99.5% by mol, an increase in glass transition temperature and crystallization of the oxyethylene chain arise, which results in drastic deterioration of the ionic conductivity of the solid electrolyte.
      <br/>
      It is generally known that the ionic conductivity is improved by the decrease of the crystallizability of polyethylene oxide.
      <br/>
      It has been found that, in case of the polyether copolymer of the present invention, the effect for improvement of the ionic conductivity is remarkably large.
    </p>
    <p num="22">
      With respect to the molecular weight of the polyether copolymer, the weight-average molecular weight is suitable within the range from 103 to 107, and preferably from 104 to 5 * 106, so as to obtain excellent processability, moldability, mechanical strength and flexibility.
      <br/>
      More preferably it is from 5 * 104 to 5 * 106, particularly from 105 to 5 * 106.
    </p>
    <p num="23">
      A glass transition temperature and a fusion heat of the polyether copolymer are measured by a differential scanning calorimeter (DSC).
      <br/>
      In the present invention, the glass transition temperature of the polyether copolymer is preferably not more than -60 (degree)  C., more preferably not more than -63 (degree)  C., e.g. not more than -65 (degree)  C. The fusion heat of the polyether copolymer is preferably not more than 90 J/g, e.g. not more than 70 J/g, specifically not more than 60 J/g, particularly not more than 50 J/g.
    </p>
    <p num="24">
      The polyether copolymer of the present invention may be any copolymer type such as a block copolymer and a random copolymer, but the random copolymer is preferable because the effect for reduction of the crystalizability of polyethylene oxide is large.
      <br/>
      The polyether copolymer of the present invention is a polyether copolymer having a side chain with two oligooxyethylene groups and, if necessary, a side chain containing a crosslinkable reactive functional group.
      <br/>
      The polyether copolymer of the present invention is a copolymer formed from at least two monomers.

    <p num="25">
      The polymerization degrees m and n of the oxyethylene unit of the side chain portion in the monomer (I), which constitutes the repeating unit (A), are from 1 to 12, e.g. from 1 to 6, respectively.
      <br/>
      When the polymerization degree n exceeds 12, the ionic conductivity of the resulting solid polymer electrolyte is unfavorably deteriorated.
      <br/>
      When R1 or R2 represents an alkyl group, the preferable carbon number of the alkyl group is from 1 to 6, particularly from 1 to 3.

    <p num="128">
      Using the solid polymer electrolyte obtained in Example 10 as the electrolyte, a lithium metal foil as a negative electrode and lithium cobaltate (LiCoO2) as a positive electrode, a secondary battery was constructed.
      <br/>
      The size of the solid polymer electrolyte was 10 mm * 10 mm * 0.2 mm. The size of the lithium foil was 10 mm * 10 mm * 0.1 mm. Lithium cobaltate was prepared by mixing predetermined amount of lithium carbonate and cobalt carbonate powder and calcining the mixture at 900 (degree)  C. for 5 hours.
      <br/>
      The calcined mixture was ground, and then 12 parts by weight of acetylene black and 3 parts by weight of the solid polymer electrolyte obtained in Example 10 were added to 85 parts by weight of the resulting lithium cobaltate, followed by mixing by a roll and further press-molding under the pressure of 300 KgW/cm2 to form a positive electrode having the size of 10 mm * 10 mm * 2 mm.
    </p>
    <p num="129">
      The solid polymer electrolyte obtained in Example 10 was sandwiched between the lithium metal foil and the lithium cobaltate plate, and the charge/discharge characteristics of the resulting battery were examined at 25 (degree)  C. with applying the pressure of 10 KgW/cm2 so that the interfaces were brought into contact with each other.
      <br/>
      The discharge current at the initial terminal voltage of 3.8 V was 0.1 mA/cm2 and charging could be conducted at 0.1 mA/cm2. It is possible to easily reduce the thickness of the battery in this Example and, therefore, a light-weight and large-capacity battery can be obtained.

      Using the crosslinked solid polymer electrolyte obtained in Example 29 as the electrolyte, a lithium metal foil as a negative electrode and lithium cobaltate (LiCoO2) as a positive electrode, a secondary battery was constructed.
      <br/>
      The size of the crosslinked solid polymer electrolyte was 10 mm * 10 mm * 0.2 mm. The size of the lithium foil was 10 mm * 10 mm * 0.1 mm. Lithium cobaltate was prepared by mixing predetermined amount of lithium carbonate and cobalt carbonate powder and calcining the mixture at 900 (degree)  C. for 5 hours.
      <br/>
      The calcined mixture was ground, and then 12 parts by weight of acetylene black and 3 parts by weight of the crosslinked solid polymer electrolyte obtained in Example 29 were added to 85 parts by weight of the resulting lithium cobaltate, followed by mixing by a mortar and press-molding under the pressure of 300 KgW/cm2 to form a positive electrode having the size of 10 mm * 10 mm * 2 mm.

      The discharge current at the initial terminal voltage of 3.8 V was 0.1 mA/cm2 and the charging could be conducted at 0.1 mA/cm2. It is possible to easily reduce the thickness of the battery in this Example and, therefore, a light-weight and large-capacity battery can be obtained.
