    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="6">
      The broad field of water treatment systems includes two classes of equipment.
      <br/>
      A first class, referred to as point-of entry equipment, treats water before distribution through a community or a building.
      <br/>
      Point-of-entry equipment typically utilizes microfiltration, chlorination, and/or ozonation technologies to remove and/or kill various contaminants in water.
      <br/>
      A second class, referred to as point-of-use equipment, treats water at a single tap in a building or the like without regard to other taps in the building.
      <br/>
      Point-of-use equipment is typically utilized to remove health contaminants (e.g. lead) and aesthetic contaminants (e.g. sulfur) before dispensing water via the tap.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      The above-described water treatment systems have become increasingly popular as more individuals become aware of contaminants present in the water supply.
      <br/>
      However, these systems are limited to utilization at a specific location (e.g. at an individual's place of residence), and hence are not amenable to portable use.
    </p>
    <heading>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading>
    <p num="8">
      The invention is pointed out with particularity in the appended claims. However, other features of the invention may become more apparent and the invention may be best understood by referring to the following detailed description in conjunction with the accompanying drawings in which:
      <br/>

    </p>
    <p num="9">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT(S)</p>
    <p num="10">
      Embodiments of the present invention advantageously provide a portable apparatus having an ultraviolet source to kill biological contaminants in a fluid.
      <br/>
      The apparatus is amenable for storing, carrying, disinfecting, and dispensing of a fluid for consumption by an individual either at home or away from home.
      <br/>
      The embodiments thus provides a point-of-consumption fluid treatment apparatus, which can be utilized in conjunction with currently-available point-of-use and point-of-entry systems if desired, to treat a fluid before consumption by the individual.
      <br/>
      The portability of the apparatus is beneficial for use in disinfecting water obtained from sources away from home, such as from a public drinking fountain, a hotel, or a place of work.
    </p>
    <p num="11">
      FIG. 1 illustrates an embodiment of an apparatus for storing and disinfecting a fluid 10.
      <br/>
      The apparatus comprises a container 12 for containing the fluid 10.
      <br/>
      The container 12 is sized in accordance with an amount of fluid which is to be stored and disinfected.
      <br/>
      Of particular interest are embodiments of the present invention wherein the container 12 has a capacity to store and disinfect up to one to two liters of fluid.
    </p>
    <p num="12">
      The container 12 defines an opening 14 through which the fluid 10 is dispensed into and removed from the container 12.
      <br/>
      A cap member 16 removably seals the opening 14 of the container 12.
      <br/>
      To secure the cap member 16 to the container 12, the cap member 16 can include a threading 18 which engages with a mating threading 20 of the container 12.
      <br/>
      The threading 18 and the mating threading 20 allow manual securing and removing of the cap member 16 to/from the container 12.
      <br/>
      It is noted that other means for securing the cap member 16 to the container 12 can be utilized in alternative embodiments of the present invention.
    </p>
    <p num="13">
      In a preferred embodiment, the container 12 at least partially thermally insulates the fluid 10 from an exterior environment 22 when the cap member 16 is secured.
      <br/>
      The container 12 can include a vacuum bottle or the like to provide the thermal insulation.
      <br/>
      As a result, a hot fluid can be maintained at a hot temperature and a cold fluid can be maintained at a cold temperature for a given time period when stored in the container 12.

    <p num="14">
      The apparatus further comprises an ultraviolet source 24 mounted to at least one of the container 12 and the cap member 16.
      <br/>
      The ultraviolet source 24 emits ultraviolet radiation to disinfect the fluid 11 contained in the container 12.
      <br/>
      The ultraviolet light acts to destroy genetic material of various types of biological contaminants (e.g. bacteria and viruses) to inhibit their reproduction.
      <br/>
      Preferably, the ultraviolet source 24 produces germicidal ultraviolet light at a wavelength of about 254 nanometers.
      <br/>
      The ultraviolet source 24 can include a mercury vapor lamp for this purpose.
    </p>
    <p num="15">
      In the embodiment of FIG. 1, the ultraviolet source 24 is illustrated to be mounted to the cap member 16.
      <br/>
      It is noted, however, that the ultraviolet source 24 can be alternatively mounted to a portion of the container 12.
    </p>
    <p num="16">
      In preferred embodiments, the ultraviolet source 24 includes an ultraviolet lamp or an ultraviolet bulb which can be powered by batteries.
      <br/>
      For example, a four-watt ultraviolet lamp powerable by four AA batteries may be utilized.
      <br/>
      In an exemplary embodiment, the ultraviolet source 24 requires less than or equal to approximately 1 Watt of power to illuminate.
    </p>
    <p num="17">
      To enhance the disinfection process, the container 12 has an inner surface 26 which is ultraviolet-reflecting and ultraviolet-resistant.
      <br/>
      As a result, the inner surface 26 reflects the ultraviolet radiation emitted by the ultraviolet source 24, and hence, the disinfection of the fluid 10 is intensified.
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      Preferably, the container 12 and the cap member 16 are sized for carrying by an individual.
      <br/>
      As a result, an individual can carry a supply of disinfected fluid, such as water, for his/her personal consumption throughout a day.
      <br/>
      To assist the individual in carrying the apparatus, the container 12 optionally includes a handle 30 for gripping by the individual.
      <br/>
      A base member 32 is located at a bottom portion of the container 12 to allow the apparatus to rest on a flat surface, such as a table top or the like, during storage and disinfection.
    </p>
    <p num="19">It is noted that embodiments of the present invention are not limited to the form of the container 12 and the cap member 16 illustrated in FIG. 1, and that various sizes, shapes, and forms of containers and cap members can be utilized.</p>
    <p num="20">
      FIG. 2 is a block diagram of an embodiment of an apparatus for disinfecting the fluid 10 stored in the container 12.
      <br/>
      In general, each of the components illustrated in FIG. 2 can be integrated into either the container 12 or the cap member 16 of FIG. 1.
      <br/>
      As a result, numerous embodiments of the present invention can be formulated based on all possible two-set partitions of the components.
    </p>
    <p num="21">
      The apparatus includes a control circuit 40 in communication with the ultraviolet source 24.
      <br/>
      The control circuit 40 is operative to control a disinfect cycle by selectively illuminating and attenuating or extinguishing the ultraviolet source 24.
      <br/>
      It is noted that the term "illuminating" should be construed to include both continuous illumination and pulsed illumination of the ultraviolet source 24.
    </p>
    <p num="22">
      The control circuit 40 can have any of a variety of forms, including digital circuit embodiments and analog circuit embodiments.
      <br/>
      For example, the control circuit 40 can include one or more discrete transistors, integrated circuits, microprocessors, application-specific integrated circuits, programmable logic arrays, and/or other integrated circuits interconnected to provide the desired logic for controlling the disinfect cycle.
      <br/>
      Regardless of its form, the control circuit 40 is integrated within at least one of the cap member 16 and the container 12.
    </p>
    <p num="23">
      The apparatus further includes an input device 42 in communication with the control circuit 40.
      <br/>
      The input device 42 is accessible by a user to control the disinfect cycle.
      <br/>
      Using the input device 42, the user can initiate a disinfect cycle, terminate the disinfect cycle, or modify a parameter of the disinfect cycle.
    </p>
    <p num="24">
      The input device 42 can have any of a variety of forms, including but not limited to one or more switches, one or more buttons, a keypad, a knob, a dial, a touchpad, a touchscreen, or any combination thereof.
      <br/>
      Regardless of its form, the input device 42 is integrated with or mounted to either the cap member 16, the container 12, or both.
      <br/>
      A preferred location for integrating the input device 42 with the container 12 is in a portion of the handle 30.
    </p>
    <p num="25">
      Various approaches can be utilized to control and/or define a disinfect cycle.
      <br/>
      In one approach, the control circuit 40 is operative to illuminate the ultraviolet source 24 for a predetermined time duration of the disinfect cycle.
      <br/>
      The predetermined time duration can be fixed by the control circuit 40, or can be user-adjustable via the input device 42.
      <br/>
      Using this approach, a user would typically disinfect a fluid by: (i) dispensing the fluid into the container 12 through the opening 14; (ii) sealing the opening 14 with the cap member 16; (iii) optionally, setting the predetermined time duration using the input device 42; and (iv) initiating the disinfect cycle using the input device 42.
      <br/>
      The apparatus would then proceed to disinfect the fluid for the predetermined time duration.
      <br/>
      Once the disinfect cycle has completed, the fluid can be removed from the container 12, through the opening 14, for consumption by the user.
    </p>
    <p num="26">
      Another approach to controlling and/or defining a disinfect cycle utilizes a sensor 44 to sense a measure of quality of the fluid.
      <br/>
      Preferably, the sensor 44 is mounted to the inner surface 26 of the container 12, such as at the bottom of the container 12 near the base 32.
    </p>
    <p num="27">
      The sensor 44 communicates the measure of quality of the fluid to the control circuit 40.
      <br/>
      The control circuit 40 is operative to terminate the disinfect cycle when the measure of quality of the fluid satisfies a predetermined criterion, such as when the quality of the fluid attains a desired value.
      <br/>
      Here, a user would typically disinfect a fluid by: (i) dispensing the fluid into the container 12 through the opening 14; (ii) sealing the opening 14 with the cap member 16; (iii) optionally, setting a desired measure of water quality using the input device 42; and (iv) initiating the disinfect cycle using the input device 42.
      <br/>
      The apparatus would then proceed to disinfect the fluid until the quality of the fluid satisfies the predetermined criterion.
      <br/>
      Thereafter, the fluid can be removed from the container 12 for consumption by the user.
    </p>
    <p num="28">
      Regardless of the approach utilized to control the disinfect cycle, it is preferred that the apparatus include an output device 46 to provide an indication of the status of the disinfect cycle to the user.
      <br/>
      The output device 46 is integrated with or mounted to at least one of the cap member 16 and the container 12.
      <br/>
      The output device 46 can be utilized to provide an indication of an in-progress disinfect cycle, an indication of a time remaining in the disinfect cycle, an indication of the measure of quality of the fluid as sensed by the sensor 44, and/or an indication of a completed disinfect cycle.
    </p>
    <p num="29">
      Generally, the indication provided by the output device 46 can include an audible indication and/or a visual indication.
      <br/>
      To provide an audible indication, the output device 46 can comprise an audio output device such as a speaker, a piezoelectric buzzer, or a like transducer in communication with the control circuit 40.
      <br/>
      To provide a visual indication, the output device 46 can comprise a light-emitting diode (LED) display, a liquid crystal display (LCD), or a like display element in communication with the control circuit 40.
    </p>
    <p num="30">
      Preferably, the output device 46 provides a visual indication of an in-progress disinfect cycle.
      <br/>
      Here, an LED or an LCD element is activated to indicate to the user that the fluid is being disinfected.
      <br/>
      It is further preferred that the output device 46 provide a visual indication of either the time remaining in the disinfect cycle or of the sensed quality of the fluid.
      <br/>
      The time remaining or the sensed quality can be indicated numerically using LED or LCD displays, or can be indicated graphically using a bar graph type of display, for example.
      <br/>
      Once the disinfect cycle has completed, a visual indication and/or an audible indication alerts the user that the fluid is suitable for consumption.
    </p>
    <p num="31">
      An additional feature which can be provided by the control circuit 40 is to inhibit illumination of the ultraviolet source 24 when the cap member 16 is removed from the opening 14 of the container 12.
      <br/>
      Various techniques for sensing when the cap member 16 is removed from the container 12 can be utilized for this purpose.
