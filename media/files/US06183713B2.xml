      The invention relates to a method for producing nitrogen trifluoride by gas-solid reaction.
      <br/>
      This method includes the steps of (a) providing a packed-bed-type vessel filled with a particulate solid of an ammonium complex of a metal fluoride; (b) introducing a fluorine-containing gas into the vessel to allow the fluorine-containing gas to flow upwardly through the vessel such that fluorine of the fluorine-containing gas is reacted with the particulate solid in the vessel, thereby to obtain a reaction gas containing nitrogen trifluoride; and (c) separating the nitrogen trifluoride from the reaction gas.
      <br/>
      A part of the reaction gas flowing out of the vessel may be introduced into the vessel, and thereby circulated through the vessel.
      <br/>
      The yield of nitrogen trifluoride becomes substantially improved by this method.

    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="1">The present invention relates to methods for producing nitrogen trifluoride which is useful as a dry etching gas or cleaning gas.</p>
    <p num="2">
      Nitrogen trifluoride (NF3) is a colorless gas under normal conditions and has a boiling point of about -129 (degree)  C. This compound has conventionally been used as a fluorine source in the preparation of fluoroolefins and also as an oxidizer for a high-energy fuel.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, much attention has recently been devoted to the usefulness of this compound as a dry etching gas, which is able to leave no residue during the production of semiconductors, and as a cleaning gas for devices of chemical vapor deposition (CVD).
    </p>
    <p num="3">
      Nitrogen trifluoride is produced usually by direct fluorination of ammonia in vapor phase or by electrolysis of ammonium hydrogenfluoride.
      <br/>
      Vapor phase reaction between hydrogen azide and oxygen difluoride is also known. U.S. Pat. No. 3,304,248 proposes to carry out reaction between nitrogen and fluorine by forcing nitrogen gas heated to a temperature above 1,000 (degree)  C. to pass through a plasma arc and simultaneously introducing fluorine gas into a post-arc region very close to the anode.
      <br/>
      The reactions in these methods are vapor phase reactions which are relatively violent and not easy to control.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, according to these methods, the yield of nitrogen trifluoride is relatively low.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      Japanese Patent Second Provisional Publication JP-B55-8926 (1980) proposes to prepare nitrogen trifluoride by reaction between ammonium hydrogenfluoride in molten state with fluorine gas.
      <br/>
      This method, however, does not seem industrially favorable firstly because the gas-liquid reaction in this method is not so easy to control and causes significant corrosion of the apparatus and also because the yield of nitrogen trifluoride is relatively low.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      U.S. Pat. No. 4,543,242, corresponding to Japanese Patent First Provisional Application JP-A-60-71503 (1985), discloses the production of nitrogen trifluoride with good yields by reaction between fluorine gas and an ammonium complex of a metal fluoride, which is in solid phase.
      <br/>
      This reaction is easy to control.
      <br/>
      However, it is further desired to provide a method for producing nitrogen trifluoride with good yields better than those of the above-mentioned methods.
    </p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="6">It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a method for producing nitrogen trifluoride with high yields.</p>
    <p num="7">
      According to the present invention, there is provided a method for producing nitrogen trifluoride.
      <br/>
      This method comprises providing a vessel filled with a particulate solid of an ammonium complex of a metal fluoride; introducing a fluorine-containing gas into the vessel to allow the fluorine-containing gas to flow upwardly through the vessel such that fluorine of the fluorine-containing gas is reacted with the particulate solid in the vessel, thereby to obtain a reaction gas containing nitrogen trifluoride; and separating the nitrogen trifluoride from the reaction gas.

    <heading>DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
    <p num="9">With reference to FIGS. 1 and 2, first and second methods each for producing nitrogen trifluoride, which are respectively in accordance with the first and second preferred embodiments of the present invention, will be described in detail in the following.</p>
    <p num="10">
      In these methods, as shown in FIGS. 1 and 2, a packed-bed-type vertical vessel 10 is provided.
      <br/>
      This vessel 10 is filled with a particulate solid of an ammonium complex of a metal fluoride.
      <br/>
      This particulate solid is placed on a catch basin or perforated plate 12.
      <br/>
      Then, as shown in FIG. 1, a fluorine-containing gas 14 is introduced into a bottom portion of the vessel to allow the fluorine-containing gas to flow upwardly through the vessel.
      <br/>
      With this, fluorine gas thereof is reacted with the particulate solid in the vessel, thereby to obtain a reaction gas (gaseous product) 16 containing nitrogen trifluoride.
      <br/>
      This reaction is considered to be represented by a reaction formula shown in U.S. Pat. No. 4,543,242, of which disclosure is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.
      <br/>
      It is assumed that the contact between the particulate solid and fluorine gas of the fluorine-containing gas is substantially increased by the use of a vertical packed-bed-type vessel.
      <br/>
      This is able to substantially improve the yield of nitrogen trifluoride.
    </p>
    <p num="11">
      As is seen from FIG. 1, the first method is conducted by not introducing the reaction gas 16 into the vessel.
      <br/>
      In contrast, the second method is conducted, as shown in FIG. 2, by introducing a part 18 of the reaction gas 16 flowing out of the vessel through a circulation line 20 into the bottom portion of the vessel, together with the fluorine-containing gas 14.
      <br/>
      In other words, a part of the reaction gas is circulated through the vessel.
      <br/>
      As will be clarified in the after-mentioned Examples, the reaction gas 16 discharged from the vessel may be subjected to the removal of impurity gases, such as F2, HF and N2 O. It becomes possible to greatly increase the concentration of nitrogen trifluoride in the thus subjected reaction gas due to the circulation of a part of the reaction gas in the second method.
      <br/>
      After the removal of impurity gases, the reaction gas may be condensed to liquid, followed by degassing to remove unwanted substances other than nitrogen trifluoride.
      <br/>
      In the second method, it becomes possible to substantially decrease the amount of nitrogen trifluoride (gas) taken out of the system together with an inert gas (e.g., N2) during this degassing, due to the above-mentioned increased concentration of nitrogen trifluoride therein.
      <br/>
      As a result, according to the second method, it becomes possible to substantially improve the recovery of nitrogen trifluoride.
    </p>
    <p num="12">
      In the second method, as shown in FIG. 2, it is preferable to use a compression pump or a blower 22 for introducing a part of the reaction gas discharged from the vessel.
      <br/>
      In the second method, the fluorine-containing gas 14 may be introduced into any portion of the vessel, besides its bottom portion shown in FIG. 2, since a part of the reaction gas is circulated through the vessel.
      <br/>
      In the second method, the fluorine-containing gas 14 may consist essentially of fluorine gas.
      <br/>
      This is preferable, since it becomes possible to increase the NF3 concentration of the reaction gas.
      <br/>
      In this case, it is preferable to introduce a blend 24 of fluorine gas and a part of the result gas, into the vessel, as explained hereinafter.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, the fluorine-containing gas may contain an inert gas, such as nitrogen, for the dilution of fluorine gas.
    </p>
    <p num="13">
      In the first and second methods, it is preferable to agitate the particulate solid in the vessel in order to increase the contact between fluorine gas and the particulate solid.
      <br/>
      With this, it becomes possible to further improve the yield of NF3.
      <br/>
      The agitation may be conducted by using an agitating blade 26 driven by a motor 27 (see FIGS. 1 and 2).
      <br/>
      The shape of the agitating blade is not particularly limited, and it may have a shape of paddle, turbine, screw, or ribbon.
    </p>
    <p num="14">
      As shown in FIGS. 1 and 2, it is preferable that, during the introduction of the fluorine-containing gas into the vessel, the particulate solid is additionally supplied to the vessel in a continuous manner, and at the same time the particulate solid is continuously discharged from the vessel such that the particulate solid has a constant level in the vessel, thereby continuously react fluorine of the fluorine-containing gas with the particulate solid.
      <br/>
      With this, the productivity of NF3 can be enhanced.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, the continuous supply and continuous discharge of the particulate solid can easily be achieved, since the vessel is a vertical packed-bed-type one.
      <br/>
      The manner of continuously supplying the particulate solid is not particularly limited.
      <br/>
      For example, it may be supplied from a vessel 28 for receiving the particulate solid, through a screw conveyor 30 driven by a motor 32, as shown in FIGS. 1 and 2.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, the particulate solid can be supplied only by inserting, into the vessel, an end portion of a pipe filled with the particulate solid, in case that the particulate solid is agitated in the vessel or that the flow rate of the fluorine-containing gas is substantially high.
      <br/>
      The manner of continuously discharging the particulate solid from the vessel is also not particularly limited.
      <br/>
      For example, it may be conducted by using a screw conveyor or by overflow shown in FIGS. 1 and 2.
      <br/>
      The discharge by overflow is particularly preferable, because it does not require any complicated devices and is able to easily maintain the particulate solid at a constant level or height.
      <br/>
      The overflowed particulate solid may be collected in a vessel 34 through a discharge pipe 36, as shown in FIGS. 1 and 2.
    </p>
    <p num="15">
      In the invention, examples of the metal fluoride ammonium complex are (NH)3 AlF6, (NH4)3 FeF6, (NH4)2 TiF6, (NH4)3 VF6, (NH4)3 CrF6, (NH4)3 MnF6, (NH4)3 CoF6, (NH4)3 CuF6, (NH4)2 ZrF6, NH4 NbF6, NH4 WF7, (NH4)2 SiF6, (NH4)2 SnF6, (NH4) 2 PbF6, (NH4)2 SbF6, (NH4)2 GeF6, (NH4)2 NaAlF6, (NH4)2 NaFeF6, (NH4)2 KAlF6, (NH4)2 KFeF6, NH4 NaSiF6, and NH4 KSiF6.
      <br/>
      Of these, (NH4)AlF6, (NH4)2 NaAlF6, and (NH4)3 FeF6 are particularly preferable, since they are readily available and since it becomes possible to produce NF3 with good yield and to easily control the reaction.
    </p>
    <p num="16">
      In the invention, the inside of the vessel or the particulate solid is adjusted during the reaction to having a temperature preferably from 10 to 250 (degree)  C., more preferably from 50 to 200 (degree)  C. If it exceeds 250 (degree)  C., the yield of NF3 may become too low.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, it may cause some disadvantages, such as the reaction being out of control.
      <br/>
      If it is lower than 10 (degree)  C., the reaction rate may become too low.
      <br/>
      As a result, the yield of NF3 may become too low.
    </p>
    <p num="17">
      In the invention, the fluorine concentration of the fluorine-containing gas to be introduced into the vessel is preferably not greater than 5 vol %, in case that the fluorine-containing gas is singly introduced into the vessel, as shown in FIG. 1.
      <br/>
      If it is greater than 5 vol %, too much of the reaction heat may be generated in the vessel.
      <br/>
      As a result, it may become difficult to make the temperature of the inside of the vessel fall within a range of 10-250 (degree)  C. The lower limit of the fluorine concentration is not particularly limited, and it is preferably not less than 0.5 vol % in view of the productivity of NF3.
      <br/>
      A diluting gas to adjust the fluorine concentration to not greater than 5 vol % is not particularly limited, so long as the diluting gas does not have an influence on the reaction.
      <br/>
      The diluting gas may be an inert gas such as N2, Ar, He, etc.
      <br/>
      In case that a blend 24 of the fluorine-containing gas and a part of the reaction gas is introduced into the vessel, as shown in FIG. 2, the fluorine concentration of this blend is preferably not greater than 5 vol %. In this case, it is optional to omit the diluting gas.
      <br/>
      In other words, fluorine gas may be blended with a part of the reaction gas such that the fluorine concentration of the resultant blend is adjusted to not greater than 5 vol %.
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      In the invention, it is preferable to introduce the fluorine-containing gas or the above-mentioned blend to the vessel in a manner that a superficial velocity of the fluorine-containing gas or the blend to flow upwardly through the vessel is not less than 1 cm/s.
      <br/>
      This superficial velocity is defined as being Q/A, where Q is the volume of the fluorine-containing gas or the blend introduced into the vessel per unit amount of time at 25 (degree)  C. and 1 atmosphere, and A is a cross-sectional area of the vessel, perpendicular to the direction of the flow of the fluorine-containing gas or the blend in the vessel.
      <br/>
      A superficial velocity not greater than 1 cm/s does not cause particular problems.
      <br/>
      However, if the superficial velocity is not less than 1 cm/s, the fluidity of the particulate solid may become sufficiently high.
      <br/>
      As a result, it is possible to increase the contact between the particulate solid and fluorine gas, and thereby to increase the yield of NF3.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, if the superficial velocity is not less than 1 cm/s, it may become easy to maintain the temperature of the inside of the vessel constant.
      <br/>
      With this, it may become easier to control the reaction.
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      In the invention, the particulate solid has an average particle diameter of preferably not less than 100  MU m. If it is less than 100  MU m, the number of the solid particles thrown out of the vessel may become too many.
      <br/>
      With this, it may become difficult to conduct the reaction stably or may cause clogging of the discharge pipe with the solid particles.
    </p>
    <p num="20">As mentioned above, the reaction gas may contain impurity gases such as F2, HF and N2 O. Thus, the reaction gas can be subjected to the removal of these gases therefrom and then a certain purification, thereby to obtain NF3 with high purity.</p>
    <p num="21">It is needless to say that the first method can be conducted by using the vessel 10 shown in FIG. 2 under a condition that the circulation line 20 is closed.</p>
    <p num="22">
      The following nonlimitative examples are illustrative of the present invention.
      <br/>
      The following Examples 1-6 are in accordance with the first method of the first preferred embodiment of the invention, and the following Examples 7-12 are in accordance with the second method of the second preferred embodiment of the invention.
    </p>
    <p num="23">EXAMPLE 1</p>
    <p num="24">
      In this example, a vertical packed-bed-type vessel 10 shown in FIG. 1 was used in the production of NF3.
      <br/>
      In fact, a part of the reaction gas flowing out of the vessel was not introduced into the vessel.
      <br/>
      The vessel was equipped with an agitating device, a particulate solid supplying device, and a particulate solid discharge device.
      <br/>
      The agitating device had an agitating, two-blade paddle (width: 100 mm and height: 25 mm) 26 and a motor 27 for driving the paddle.
      <br/>
      The particulate solid supplying device had a particulate-solid supply vessel 28, a screw conveyor 30 for conveying the particulate solid, and a motor 32 for driving the screw conveyor.
      <br/>
      The particulate solid discharge device had a particulate solid receiving vessel 34 and a particulate discharge pipe 36.
    </p>
    <p num="25">
      At first, the vessel (inside diameter: 130 mm and height: 500 m) was charged with 3,000 g of a particulate solid of (NH4)3 AlF6 having an average particle diameter of 300  MU m. Then, while the agitating paddle was rotated at a rate of 100 rpm for agitating the particulate solid, the inside of the vessel was heated to 110 (degree)  C. by an outside heater 38 in an atmosphere of nitrogen.
      <br/>
      Then, it was started to introduce a gas mixture (fluorine-containing gas) of F2 and N2, of which fluorine concentration was 2.0 vol %, into the bottom of the vessel at a flow rate of 50 SLM, in a manner to have a superficial velocity of 6.3 cm/s and to allow the fluorine-containing gas to flow upwardly through the vessel.
      <br/>
      At the same time when the introduction of the fluorine-containing gas was started, it was also started to continuously supply the particulate solid of (NH4)3 AlF6 at a rate of 2.0 g/min from the supply vessel 28 through the screw conveyor 30.
      <br/>
      After some time, the overflowed particulate solid started to come out of the vessel, and the discharged particulate solid was received in the vessel 34 through the discharge pipe 36.
      <br/>
      The temperature of the inside of the vessel increased from 110 (degree)  C. to 145 (degree)  C. and became constant at 145 (degree)  C. by the introduction of the fluorine-containing gas.
    </p>
    <p num="26">
      In some time after confirming that the temperature of the inside of the vessel became constant, a reaction gas 16 discharged from the vessel was analyzed with a gas chromatograph.
      <br/>
      In fact, HF gas (a by-product) in the reaction gas was completely removed by passing the reaction gas through a cold trap and then treating it with NaF.
      <br/>
      By the analysis, the reaction gas was found to contain 0.59 vol % of NF3.
      <br/>
      The yield of NF3 on the basis of F2 was found to be 87% by the expression (a/b) * c where a is the NF3 concentration (vol %) of the reaction gas, b is a third of the F2 concentration (vol %) of the fluorine-containing gas, and c is �100-(the F2 concentration (vol %) of the fluorine-containing gas)-(2/3)�.
