      A faucet 40 includes a faucet spout assembly 46 which includes a spout shell 56 for supporting a cartridge 126 containing a filter media therein defining a flow path for water being filtered.
      <br/>
      The shell 56 and the cartridge 126 define a flow space 138 between the shell and the cartridge for unfiltered water.
      <br/>
      Water which flows through the flow path of the filter cartridge 126, and unfiltered water which flows through the flow space 138, is directed to a chamber 158 of a valve head 60.
      <br/>
      A spool valve 210 is located within the chamber 158 and is positionable selectively by manipulation of a knob 62 to allow the filtered water or the unfiltered water to enter the chamber, and to allow the filtered water to be dispensed from the spout assembly 46 through a nozzle 66 or, alternatively, the unfiltered water to be dispensed from an aerator 64.

    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="1">This invention relates to a faucet spout assembly, and particularly relates to a spout assembly of a faucet which contains a valve for selectively directing fluid through one of a pair of spout outlets.</p>
    <p num="2">
      Several systems have been developed in the past for filtering water prior to, or after, the passage of the water through a faucet for point-of-use dispensing.
      <br/>
      One such system includes a bulky canister type filter with a cartridge having a filtering media contained therein.
      <br/>
      Upon the demand for water at the faucet by an operator of a faucet valve, water passes through the filtering media in the canister and then through the faucet and is dispensed at the outlet of the spout.
      <br/>
      Typically, filters of this type are located in a storage cabinet beneath the sink where the faucet is located.
      <br/>
      At times, the canisters are difficult to access when it becomes necessary to change the filter cartridge.
      <br/>
      Also, filters of this type are located, in the water flow path, upstream of the faucet valve thereby necessitating the placement of a separate water shut-off valve adjacent the canister to turn the water off in order to replace the filter cartridge.
      <br/>
      Otherwise, the main water supply valve must be turned off during the replacement process.
    </p>
    <p num="3">
      Another type of water filtering unit is referred to as a counter-top unit which sets on the counter top in the vicinity of the faucet.
      <br/>
      Such units require additional plumbing lines to connect into the flow path.
      <br/>
      In addition, the counter-top units are bulky, unattractive and require considerable space in the area of the faucet and sink.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      A third type of water filtering unit is referred to as an aerator-mounted unit which is assembled with the faucet system at the free end of the spout in place of the aerator.
      <br/>
      These units are unusually large and unattractive, and tend to interfere with normal use of the sink in the vicinity of the faucet and spout.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      Therefore, there is a need for a water filtering system which accomplishes the water filtering task without affecting the aesthetics of the faucet, and which mounts the filtering facility in an easily accessible and convenient location for replacing filter cartridges.
      <br/>
      Further, there is a need for a water filtering system which is structurally designed to facilitate the replacement of the cartridges without the need for tools, and for a readily accessible valving facility for the fast and efficient selection of filtered or unfiltered water to be dispensed from the spout of the faucet.

      As shown in FIGS. 4 and 18, the knob 62 is formed with a cup-shaped body 308 having a cylindrically-shaped side wall 310 integrally formed with forward circular wall 312 having an outer face 314.
      <br/>
      The side wall 310 is formed with a series of spaced, axially-directed grooves.

      Prior to assembling the various components of the spout assembly 46, the filter cartridge 126 is essentially filled with a filter media.
      <br/>
      The filter media could primarily include, for example, granular activated carbon (GAC) which is useful for filtering the undesirable elements in the unfiltered water which are associated with chlorine, taste and odor.
      <br/>
      Other known water filtering media could be added to the GAC for effectively reducing various metals and minimizing any bacteria which may be in the water to be filtered.
      <br/>
      Also, ion exchange resins could be added to treat the water being filtered for color and taste.
      <br/>
      A pre-filter porous mesh could be used within the cartridge 126 adjacent the cover 134 to preclude sediment and suspended particulate from interfering with the filtering action.
      <br/>
      Further, a post-filter porous material such as, for example, foam could be inserted into the cartridge 126 above the filter media to retain the filter media within the cartridge during processing and handling of the cartridge prior to assembly within the spout shell 56, and for the useful life of the filter cartridge 126.
    </p>
    <p num="40">It is noted that the many known types of suitable media could be used within the filter cartridge 126 without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention.</p>
    <p num="41">
      Proceeding with the assembly of the components of the faucet spout assembly 46, the filter cartridge 126 is inserted into the threaded end 123 of the spout shell 56 until the end 130 thereof is located with the cover 134 adjacent the portal 120 formed through the wall of the hub 44.
      <br/>
      As the cartridge 126 is inserted into the spout shell 56, the tabs 135 at the first axial end 130 of the cartridge centrally locate the first axial end within the spout shell.

      A pair of coil springs 344 and 346 are placed within a pair of cup-shaped rubber seals 348 and 350, respectively.
      <br/>
      Each of the rubber seals 348 and 350 is formed with a cylindrical side wall 347 which is fully open at one axial end 349 and formed with a base or floor 351 at the opposite axial end, with a small axial opening 353 in the base thereof.
      <br/>
      The end of the spring 344, which extends from the open end of the seal 348, is placed in the first inlet passage 176 of the valve head 60, and the end of the spring 346, which extends from the open end of the seal 350, is placed in the second inlet passage 178 of the valve head.
      <br/>
      In this position, the base 351 of each of the seals 348 and 350 is located in the chamber 158 of the valve head 58 extending into the chamber from the inlet passages 176 and 178, respectively.
    </p>
    <p num="44">
      Thereafter, an O-ring 352 (FIG. 4) is positioned in the annular groove 268 of the spool valve 210, and a detent coil spring 354 and a pair of stainless steel detent balls 356 and 358 are placed in the hole 270 in the order illustrated in FIGS. 4 and 20. An O-ring 360 is placed in the annular groove 306 formed in the flange 282 of the end sleeve 278.
      <br/>
      The end sleeve 278 is then positioned so that the axes of the sleeve and the spool valve 210 are aligned as shown in FIG. 4, the steel ball 358 of the spool valve is aligned with the groove 290 of the end sleeve and the stop surfaces 296 and 298 are equally spaced about an imaginary vertical line with respect to the position of the stop surfaces as illustrated in FIG. 15. The end sleeve 278 is then slipped over the hub 266 of the spool valve 210 where the ball 358 glides into, and moves generally to the longitudinal middle of, the groove 290.
      <br/>
      The forward axial end 288 of the end sleeve 278 is moved into engagement with the common bearing surface formed by the flat surfaces 247, 260, 262 and 264.
      <br/>
      A first rubber ball 370 is inserted into the bore 224 of the spool-valve cup 222 at the second axial end 230 thereof, and a second rubber ball 372 is inserted into the bore 248 of spool-valve cup 246 at the second axial end 250 thereof.
      <br/>
      The assembled spool valve 210 and end sleeve 278 form a valve/sleeve subassembly which is now ready for assembly within the chamber 158 of the valve head 60.
    </p>
    <p num="45">
      With the disc 212 of the spool valve 210 facing the opening 160 of the valve head 60, and with the arcuate locating tab 300 of the end sleeve 278 being aligned with the arcuate slot 164 of the valve head 60, the valve/sleeve subassembly is moved such that the disc is inserted into the chamber 158 and the arcuate tab begins to enter the arcuate slot.
      <br/>
      Upon continued movement of the valve/sleeve subassembly axially further into the chamber 158, the outboard surface 238 of the disc 212 engages the outer surfaces of the bases 351 of the seals 348 and 350.
      <br/>
      In this mode of operation, the small opening 353 of the seal 348 facilitates communication between the first inlet passage 176 of the valve head 60 and the first passage 234 of the spool valve 210.
      <br/>
      When the spool valve 210 is turned to the other mode of operation, the opening 353 of the seal 350 facilitates communication between the second inlet passage 178 of the head 60 and the second passage 236 of the spool valve.
    </p>
    <p num="46">
      A retainer ring 362 is compressed and moved over the knob mount 214 of the spool valve 210 and the outer periphery of the body 280, and firmly against the common bearing surface formed by the flat surfaces 307 of the end sleeve 278.
      <br/>
      The ring 362 is then relaxed whereby the ring expands radially outward and partially into the annular groove 162 of the valve head 60.
      <br/>
      In this manner, the valve/sleeve subassembly is retained with the valve head 60, and partially within the chamber 158, as shown in FIG. 5, with the knob mount 214 extending rearward from the sleeve 278 which, in turn, is extending partially from the head.
    </p>
    <p num="47">
      Thereafter, a collar spring 364 is radially expanded by squeezing together opposite ends 366 and 368 thereof and the spring is positioned over the knob retainer 318 formed by the two spaced arcuate tabs 324 and 326, and the spaced straight tab 322.
      <br/>
      The spring 364 is then released whereby the coils of the spring collapse around the knob retainer 318.
      <br/>
      As a result of the collapsing of the spring 364, the tabs 322, 324 and 326 are urged closer together under the biasing action of the spring.
      <br/>
      The knob 62 is then manipulated to position the biased tabs 322, 324 and 326 onto the knob mount 214 of the spool valve 210 whereby the knob is retained with the assembly of the head 60, the valve and the sleeve 278.
      <br/>
      Due to the essentially half-round shape of the knob mount 214, and the complementary biased configuration of the knob retainer 318, the knob 62 can only be positioned onto the mount in one orientation.
      <br/>
      In this orientation, the groove 316 on the outer face 314 of the knob 62 will be located in a horizontal direction to the left as viewed in FIGS. 5, 19 and 20.
      <br/>
      The horizontal direction of the groove 316 represents that the spool valve 210 is in the position illustrated in FIGS. 5, 19 and 20 facilitating the dispensing of filtered water through the faucet spout assembly 46.
      <br/>
      Also, the stop surface 298 of the end sleeve 278 is located in engagement with the second limit surface 340 of the knob 62 which locates the knob, and the groove 316, when the faucet spout assembly is in the filtered water dispensing mode.
    </p>
    <p num="48">
      Thereafter, an O-ring 368 is positioned in the groove 190 of the filtered-water stem 186 which extends from the valve head 60.
      <br/>
      The left-hand threads 194 of the valve head 60 are placed in mesh with the left-hand threads 144 of the nut 58 and the head is threaded into attachment with the nut by relative rotation between the head and the nut.
      <br/>
      Eventually, the threads 194 move axially beyond the threads 144 and the threads 194 are now located out of threaded engagement with the threads 144 and are located in the unthreaded section 146.
    </p>
    <p num="49">
      Thereafter, as illustrated in FIG. 5, a flat rubber washer 342 is inserted into the open, unthreaded end 149 of the nut 58 and located on the second end 162 of the valve head 60 at the juncture of the coarse threads 142 and the unthreaded section 146.
      <br/>
      The nut 58 is then threadedly connected to the top of the spout shell 56 through the right-hand coarse threads 122 and 142 of the shell and nut, respectively.
      <br/>
      As the nut 58 and the spout shell 56 are drawn tightly together by the threaded assembly thereof, the washer 342 is compressed between the spout shell end 123 and the valve head end 152.
    </p>
    <p num="50">
      It is noted that the head 60 can be swiveled relative to the nut 58 and the spout shell 56 due to the location of the left hand threads 194 of the head being located adjacent the first unthreaded section 146.
      <br/>
      At the same time, the spout shell 56 is secured to the nut 58 by virtue of the mesh engagement of the right hand threads 122 of the spout shell and the right hand threads 142 of the nut.
      <br/>
      It is also noted that the left hand threads 144 and 194 represent a first type of fastening structure, and the right hand threads 122 and 142 represent a second type of a fastening structure.
    </p>
    <p num="51">This completes the assembly of the components of the faucet spout assembly 46.</p>
    <p num="52">
      In use of the faucet spout assembly 46, the handle 50 of the faucet 40, as shown in FIGS. 1 and 2, is manipulated to control, in a conventional manner, the volume and temperature of water to be dispensed from the faucet.
      <br/>
      This is accomplished by selective positioning of the movable plate 96 (FIG. 3) with respect to the fixed plate 94 of the cartridge valve 82.
      <br/>
      Referring to FIG. 3, the water, which is unfiltered at this location, passes from the cartridge valve 46, through the outlet passage 76 and the portal 120, and eventually into the spout shell 56.
    </p>
    <p num="53">
      Referring to FIG. 4, the unfiltered water entering the spout shell 56 through the portal 120 can flow into and through the filter cartridge 126, and/or into and through the space 38 (FIG. 5) between the exterior of the filter cartridge and the interior wall of the spout shell 56 as determined by the position of the knob 62.
      <br/>
      Referring to FIGS. 19 and 20, an operator of the faucet 40 has selectively positioned the knob 62 so that the groove 316 is in the horizontal position and the spool valve 210 is in the position to dispense filtered water that has passed through the filter cartridge 126.
    </p>
    <p num="54">
      When the knob groove 316 is in the vertical position, whereby the spool valve 210 is positioned to dispense unfiltered water, the steel ball 358 is biasingly urged into the groove 290 of the end sleeve 278 and the stop surface 298 of the sleeve is abutting the limit surface 340 of the knob 62.
      <br/>
      When the operator wishes to operate the faucet 40, and the faucet spout assembly 46, in the filtered-water-dispensing mode, the operator turns the knob 62 in a counterclockwise direction whereby the groove 316 moves to the horizontal position shown in FIGS. 5, 19 and 20.
      <br/>
      During rotation of the knob 62, the limit tab 336 of the knob moves to position the first limit surface 338 into abutting engagement with the stop surface 298 of the sleeve 278, which occurs when the knob groove 316 is in the horizontal position.
      <br/>
      Also, during rotation of the knob 62, the steel ball 358 is urged laterally out of the slot 290 of the sleeve 278 and eventually into the slot 292 of the sleeve.
      <br/>
      This action provides a tactile response to the operator regarding the desired locating of the spool valve 210 for the selected dispensing mode.
    </p>
    <p num="55">
      Referring to FIGS. 19 and 20, when the spool valve 210 is selectively placed in the filtered-water-dispensing mode as described above, the cup 246 of the valve is positioned in a vertical orientation with the second axial end 250 surrounding the valve opening 166.
      <br/>
      With the cup 246 in the vertical position, the rubber ball 372 is sealingly seated on the bevelled seat 200 to prevent the flow of water through the first outlet passage 166 of the valve head 60 and the aerator 64.
      <br/>
      In addition, the valve cup 222 is in a horizontal position whereby the second outlet passage 168 of the valve head 60 is open to allow the passage of filtered water to pass through the second outlet passage and the nozzle 66.
    </p>
    <p num="56">
      As indicated by the arrows, water is passing through the filter cartridge 126 and is being filtered therein.
      <br/>
      The filtered water exits from the cartridge 126 and travels through the passage 188 of the valve head stem 186, through the first valve head inlet passage 176, the small opening 353 of the rubber seal 348, through the first passage 234 formed in the spool valve disc 212, and into the valve head chamber 158 adjacent the exterior of the cup 222.
      <br/>
      In this context, the chamber 158 functions as a fluid-containing plenum.
      <br/>
      The filtered water fills the space of the chamber 158 and the cups 222 and 246.
      <br/>
      Since the cup 246 is vertically oriented, and the ball 370 is seated on the bevelled seat 198 of the valve head 60, the vertically downward pressure and force on the ball, from the water which flows into the cup 246, further enhances the sealing effect of the ball and the seat to preclude any filtered water from being dispensed through the aerator 64.
      <br/>
      Instead, with the second outlet passage of the valve head 60 being open, the filtered water will be dispensed from the chamber 158, and through the flow passage of the nozzle 66.
    </p>
    <p num="57">
      When the operator desires to select the dispensing of the unfiltered water, the knob 62 is turned in a clockwise direction, as indicated by the arrow in FIG. 20, to move the groove 316 to the vertically upward orientation, as illustrated in FIGS. 21 and 22. In this mode, the cup 222 is now in a vertical orientation and the cup 246 is in a horizontal orientation.
      <br/>
      The ball 370 is now seated on the bevelled seat 200 to preclude the flow of water from the chamber 158 and through the passage 204 of the nozzle 66.
      <br/>
      The unfiltered water travels within the spout shell 56 and outside of the filter cartridge 126 as noted above.
      <br/>
      The unfiltered water enters the small chamber 182 of the valve head 60 and flows through the first linking passage 184 of the head.
      <br/>
      The unfiltered water continues to flow through the second inlet passage 178, the small opening 353 of the seal 350, the disc opening 236 and into the chamber 158 through the opening 240 in the fin 216.
      <br/>
      The unfiltered water fills the chamber 158 and the cups 222 and 246 whereby the water is dispensed through the aerator 64.
      <br/>
      In addition, the water flowing into the cup 222 enhances the seal formed by the ball 370 which is seated on the bevelled seat 200 to preclude the flow of unfiltered water through the nozzle 66.
    </p>
    <p num="58">
      Referring to FIGS. 10 and 11, the first and second passages 234 and 236 of the spool valve disc 212 are spaced apart sufficiently so that the seals 348 and 350 preclude the flow of the unfiltered water into the chamber 158 when operating in the filtered-water mode and vice-versa.
      <br/>
      However, if the handle 50 (FIG. 1) has been positioned so that filtered or unfiltered water is being dispensed, and the operator chooses to switch from one mode to the other, the passages 234 and 236 are spaced sufficiently close to each other to allow water to flow through each of the passages during a transition period when shifting when the mode-shifting action is occurring.
      <br/>
      This precludes a pressure build-up within the faucet 40, including the faucet spout assembly 46, during the transition period which might otherwise have caused damage to components thereof.
    </p>
    <p num="59">
      If the operator desires to change the filter cartridge 126, the nut 58 is rotated in a direction to provide interaction between the right-hand coarse threads 122 of the spout shell 56 and the right-hand coarse threads 142 of the nut to facilitate separation of the nut from the spout shell.
      <br/>
      During the period when the nut 58 is being rotated, the left-hand threads 144 are also being rotated.
      <br/>
      However, the left-hand threads 194 of the valve head 60 are located in the unthreaded section 146 of the nut and are not meshed with the left-hand threads 144.
      <br/>
      Further, the threads 144 and 194 are left-hand threads which will not engage during rotation of the nut 58 to effect separation of the nut from the spout shell 56.

      The ultimate assembly of the valve 425, the end sleeve 426 and the ring 427 is to be inserted into a valve head of the type illustrated as the valve head 60 in FIGS. 4, 7, 8 and 9.
    </p>
    <p num="68">
      The valve 425 is formed with a large cylindrical head section 428 and a smaller stem section 430.
      <br/>
      The head section 428 is formed with a disc 432 and a reduced hub 434.
      <br/>
      The disc 432 is formed with an annular groove 436 in the periphery thereof, and a pair of openings 438 and 440 in a forward face 442 and through the disc.
      <br/>
      The opening 438 communicates with an opening 444 formed in the hub 434 and the opening 440 communicates with an elongated opening 446 formed in the stem section 430.
      <br/>
      The stem section 430 is formed with two annular grooves 448 and 450 which define a section 452 of the valve 425 including the elongated opening 446.
      <br/>
      An enlarged hub 454 of the stem section 430 is formed with an opening 455 for receipt of a spring and a pair of steel balls (not shown) for the same purpose described above, and a knob mount 457 is formed with and extends axially outward from the hub 454 for mounting the knob 62 (FIG. 4) thereon. O-rings are placed in the grooves 436, 448 and 450.
    </p>
    <p num="69">
      The end sleeve 426 is positionable over a portion of the valve 425, as shown in FIG. 30, and is formed with an extended tab 458 which is similar to the locating tab 300 (FIG. 16) for orienting the sleeve when assembled over the stem section 430 and for proper ultimate assembly with the valve head.
      <br/>
      The end sleeve 426 is formed with an internal wall 461 which covers the section 452 to form a sub-chamber 462.
      <br/>
      The wall 461 is formed with an opening 463 which communicates with an exterior section 465 of the sleeve 426.
      <br/>
      A cylindrical body 464 extends axially to the rear of the end sleeve 426 and is formed with two spaced stop surfaces 466 (one shown) which function in the same manner as stop surfaces 296 and 298 as described above.
      <br/>
      Also, the interior wall of the body 464 is formed with two spaced, axially-directed grooves 467 (one shown) which function in the same manner as the grooves 290 and 292 as described above. O-rings (not shown) are placed in a pair of peripheral grooves 469 and 471.
    </p>
    <p num="70">
      The retainer ring or bushing 427 is formed with three curved ribs 473 (one shown, one partially shown) on bottom and opposite sides of the inner wall thereof which are located to slide into complementary grooves 470 (two shown) formed on the bottom and opposite sides of the exterior of the hub 454.
      <br/>
      The ring 427 is formed with a hole 472 therethrough which allows the outer most steel ball to extend from the opening 455 and partially through the hole selectively to engage either of the two spaced axially-directed grooves 467 (one shown) formed in the inner wall of the body 464 of the end sleeve 426 at locations spaced angularly by ninety degrees.
      <br/>
      This arrangement provides the tactile response noted above with respect to the spring 354 and the steel balls 356 and 358.
    </p>
    <p num="71">
      When the subassembly of the valve 425, the end sleeve 426 and the ring 427 is placed into the chamber of the valve head, the O-ring in the valve groove 436 and the O-ring in the sleeve groove 469 combine with the O-ring in the valve groove 450 to provide a sealed sub-chamber into which filtered water can flow from the hub opening 444.
      <br/>
      The filtered water will then be dispensed through a nozzle (not shown) which is similar to the nozzle 66.
    </p>
    <p num="72">
      When the valve 425 is positioned in the unfiltered-water mode, the valve opening 446 is in communication with the sub-chamber 462.
      <br/>
      Unfiltered water will now flow into the chamber 462, through opening 463, into a sub-chamber formed by the section 462 and the interior wall of the valve head, and is dispensed through an aerator of the same type as the aerator 64 (FIG. 4).
    </p>
    <p num="73">
      As noted above, the valve 425 and the sleeve 426 are assembled within the head 60 in a manner similar to the assembly of the preferred embodiment.
      <br/>
      The sleeve 426 is keyed to the valve head 60 and does not rotate relative to the head.
      <br/>
      The ring 427 is keyed to and rotates with the spool valve 425, and facilitates retention of the steel balls and the spring within the opening 455.
    </p>
    <p num="74">
      In each of the above-described embodiments, the faucet spout assembly 46 provides for the processing of filtered or unfiltered water through a common facility by selecting one of two modes of operation of the assembly.
      <br/>
      Provisions are made for precluding the flow of unfiltered water into the common chamber 158 during the filtered-water mode, and vice-versa.
      <br/>
      Tactile response and travel limit facilities assist in the successful switching from one mode to another, which can be accomplished efficiently and easily during the continuous supply of water, in either mode, to the faucet spout assembly 46.
      <br/>
      Also, facility is provided for readily changing the filter cartridge 126 with little effort, and without disruption to the faucet spout assembly 46.
    </p>
    <p num="75">
      The faucet spout assembly 46 is formed with the first and second outlet passages 166 and 168, respectively, for dispensing the unfiltered and filtered water, respectively, therefrom.
      <br/>
      The outlet passages 166 and 168 could be replaced with a single passage which would selectively dispense the unfiltered or filtered water without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention.
    </p>
    <p num="76">
      In general, the above-identified embodiments are not to be construed as limiting the breadth of the present invention.
      <br/>
      Modifications, and other alternative constructions, will be apparent which are within the spirit and scope of the invention as defined in the appended claims.
