      Field of the Invention
    </p>
    <p num="2">The present invention relates generally to computerized weather information systems and, more particularly, to a hand-held, electronic read-only weather device.</p>
    <p num="3">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
    <p num="4">
      One source of detailed weather information is the National Weather Service (NWS), operated by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), United States Department of Commerce.
      <br/>
      NWS operates approximately 380 weather observing stations which broadcast local weather data collected at locations scattered throughout the United States and its territories.
      <br/>
      The present invention, of course, may be employed with any other source or sources of comparably detailed and continuously updated weather information such as may be provided on a regional basis by other cooperating weather observing and forecasting organizations.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      Such comprehensive weather information is extremely useful to those persons whose activities, safety or enjoyment depend in some way on real time comprehensive knowledge of local weather conditions.
      <br/>
      For example, mariners--both commercial and operators of pleasure craft--have a compelling need for reliable weather information in order to help plan for their trips, and to make them safer and more enjoyable.
      <br/>
      Those with outdoor professions, such as professional photographers, whose ability to attain proper lighting and visibility conditions is essential to complete their assignments, also depend heavily on accurate knowledge for weather conditions in remote locales.

    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="19">
      The present invention is a portable weather display device which substitutes current satellite-fed desktop weather stations, and/or desktop or laptop computer weather stations which display real-time weather information, with a rugged, indoor/outdoor, hand-held, electronic read-only device.
      <br/>
      The portable weather display device comprises an upper and a lower hollow housing connected together by a hinge activating and containing a power on/off switch.
      <br/>
      The upper and lower housings are made of rugged, durable, shockproof, waterproof plastic.
    </p>
    <p num="20">
      The upper housing contains therein a backlit approximately 6" diagonal SVGA color touch-sensitive display and a warning speaker to signal NOAA weather alerts.
      <br/>
      The upper housing also includes a rubber gasket which seals out dust and water when closed.
      <br/>
      The lower housing contains therein a central processing unit (CPU), 32 megabytes of random access memory (RAM), 64 megabytes of Flash read only memory (ROM), a display driver, a communications interface or device, an NiMH battery (and an external AC power adapter), a standard RJ11 phone jack, a plastic sliding protector to cover over these ports, an antenna, a locking clasp to keep the device closed tightly, and battery and power indicator lights.
      <br/>
      The Flash ROM is in the form of updatable read only memory such as solid state EEPROMS or the like, or a compact high density hard drive.
      <br/>
      The communications interface or device may be an on-board cellular capable modem, softmodem, chip modem, wireless modem, or a PCMCIA slot for a PCMCIA modem.
    </p>
    <p num="21">
      Software embedded in the portable weather display device includes a custom-built operating system and application programs to perform receive, read, and display functions of the weather information coming into and stored on the device.
      <br/>
      A software communications program is provided to interface with a remote server which provides weather information, via cellular and standard modem, and to download the radar loops, satellite images and all types of weather information.
      <br/>
      The portable weather display device is preferably a read-only device.
      <br/>
      Although voice quality telephone transmission is the preferred means for communicating weather data from a remote weather server to the portable weather display device, other means can be employed including cellular, short wave, wireless, radio frequency, etc.
    </p>
    <p num="22">
      When opened the portable weather display device automatically turns on and dials out to a weather provider to begin receiving and displaying weather information on the backlit touch sensitive screen via a cellular wireless and standard RJ11 phone line modem.
      <br/>
      Icons on the touch-sensitive display allow the user to choose the type of weather information they want displayed and how it is displayed.
      <br/>
      Closing the portable weather display device automatically shuts it down.
    </p>
    <p num="23">
      The software program includes a main menu from which one of a plurality of options may be selected.
      <br/>
      The options are indicated on the main menu by icons at the top of the display.
      <br/>
      The first option is `Register`. If this option is selected the user is able to register his/her serial number, to select a local dial-in site, to select a region, and to exit.
      <br/>
      The second option is `Setup Options`. If this option is selected the user is able to change display detail, to select a standby mode, to change the brightness, to select auto/manual dial, to select defaults, and to exit.
      <br/>
      The third option is `Weather Data`. If this option is selected the user is able to select radar images, to select lightening detection, to select tides, to select storm track, to select satellite images, to select short-term forecast, to select long-term forecast, to select precipitation totals, and to exit.
      <br/>
      The fourth option is `Time`. If this option is selected the user is able to observe the time of day.
      <br/>
      The fifth option is `NOAA Alerts`. If this option is selected the user is able to observe any NOAA alerts.
      <br/>
      The sixth option is `Print`. If this option is selected the user is able to print out data.
      <br/>
      The seventh option is `Battery`. If this option is selected the user is able to observe the status of the power supply.
      <br/>
      The eighth option is `Exit`. If this option is selected the user is able to exit the program.
    </p>
    <p num="24">Accordingly, it is a principal object of the invention to provide a portable weather display device which displays real-time weather information.</p>
    <p num="25">It is another object of the invention to provide a portable weather display device which does not receive data input from the user in any function.</p>
