    <heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION AND RELATED ART</heading>
    <p num="2">The present invention relates to an analyzing method and system for bubble generation phenomenon in an ink jet recording apparatus using thermal energy, more particularly, to such a method and a system in an ink jet recording method and apparatus wherein liquid is heated to form a bubble, and the rapid volume change resulting from the bubble formation is used to eject the liquid to effect the recording.</p>
    <p num="3">The ink jet recording method is particularly noted these days since it is convenient to use a reduced-size recording apparatus, since it is suitable for high resolution recording and since it is suitable for high speed recording.</p>
    <p num="4">In such an ink jet recording apparatus, the thermal energy is applied to the liquid to form a bubble therein, and the formation of the bubble causes rapid volumetric change which makes the liquid to eject onto a recording material (recording sheet) to effect the recording.</p>
    <p num="5">It is very important in making an efficient design and accomplishing stabilized ink ejection in the apparatus to know the bubble formation phenomenon.</p>
    <p num="6">
      The bubble formation (nucleation) conditions in the ink jet recording method using the thermal energy can be dealt with as a problem of the initial nucleation in the boiling mechanism in liquid.
      <br/>
      It has been analyzed, heretofore, by the following two methods:
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      (1) method on the basis of the cavity theory;
      <br/>
      (2) method on the basis of the spontaneous nucleation theory;
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      The first method (1) is based on the assumption that fine bubbles are trapped on the heating surface, and the investigation is made as to the conditions for the growth of bubbles.
      <br/>
      Typical examples of this method are disclosed in Y. Y. Hsu: Trans.
      <br/>
      ASME, J. Heat Transfer 84 (1962) pp. 207-216, for a general boiling phenomenon, and R. R. Allen, J. D. Meyer and W. R. Knight: Hewlett-Packard J. 36(1985) No. 5, pp. 21-27 for the bubble jet printer.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      The second method (2) is to investigate the conditions for spontaneous formation of vapor bubble in the liquid by the ink molecular movement by heat.
      <br/>
      Typical examples of this method are disclosed in V. P. Skripov: Metastable Liquids, John Wiley &amp; Sons, New York (1974), for a general boiling phenomenon, and Japanese Laid-open Patent Application Publication No. 206474/1984 for a jet printer.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      However, the bubble formation or the nucleation of the ink in the ink jet printer using the thermal energy involves stochastic aspects.
      <br/>
      The conventional analysis may not be enough to describe the stochastic aspects.
    </p>
    <p num="11">
      More particularly, the conventional analysis is based on the assumption that the bubble formation starts when the temperature distribution satisfies predetermined conditions.
      <br/>
      Further particularly, in the method (1), the bubble formation start is deemed as the ink temperature distribution contacting a discrimination curve corresponding to the unstable equilibrium of the bubble: in the method (2), the bubble formation start is deemed as the temperature of the ink in contact with the heating surface reaching the superheat critical temperature.
    </p>
    <p num="12">
      The inventor's investigations have revealed that the bubble generation start in an ink jet process using the thermal energy is not of such a one point value nature, but it is of the stochastic nature.
      <br/>
      Even if the same temperature distribution is given, the bubble generation sometimes occurs, and sometimes not.
      <br/>
      The bubble generation mechanism may not be understood without introduction of the stochastic aspects.
      <br/>
      In the conventional designing of the ink jet printer using the thermal energy and the evaluation thereof, the trial and error method has to be used due to the uncertainty of the bubble generation phenomenon, and in order to avoid incomplete bubble generation, the design has to include much more than enough margins.
    </p>

    <p num="24">These calculations can be carried out, using an ordinary digital calculator, an analog calculator or a combination thereof.</p>
    <p num="25">

      <br/>
      The system comprises a data input port 10 for input of the material properties such as a thermal capacity of the ink and various parameters indicative of the structures of the ink jet recording head using the thermal energy, and a CPU 20 for calculating and controlling the integrated nucleation probability in accordance with the program stored in ROM 40 and using RAM 30.

    <p num="27">Step S1</p>
    <p num="28">
      The calculation may be executed by solving an equation of heat conduction using a numerical analysis such as a finite element method or a boundary element method or using an analytic method such as the Laplace transformation method, the Fourier transformation method, the infinite series development method or the Green function method.
      <br/>
      The easiest way will be to obtain a temperature distribution T(2) when a constant heat flux q is supplied from an end surface z=0 to a semi-indefinite region z &gt;= 0 from time 0 to t1, by the following:  (Equation image '1' not included in text)

    <p num="31">
      Equation of homogeneous nucleation rate on the basis of the nucleation theory is used.
      <br/>
      The easiest way is to use the classical nucleation theory.

      According to this theory, the homogeneous nucleation rate Jho per unit time and volume due to the thermal fluctuation of ink liquid is estimated (M.

      The homogeneous nucleation rate Jho is integrated in a spatial region.

      The equation of the heterogeneous nucleation rate on the basis of the nucleation theory is used.

      The easiest way is to use the classical nucleation theory.
      <br/>
      According to this theory, the heterogeneous nucleation rate Jhe per unit time and area at the interface between the solid and the liquid due to the thermal fluctuation of ink liquid is estimated (S. van Stralen and R.

    <p num="45">An Example of Obtaining the Integrated Nucleation Probability</p>

      FIG. 3 shows by the solid line the relation between the time t and the nucleation probability P(t) calculated through the equations (1)-(7) under the conditions of the surface area of the heater of 30 microns * 150 microns and the heat flux of 2 * 108 W/m2.
      <br/>
      It is understood from this FIG. that the incipient boiling time is not a point value but a stochastic variable.
      <br/>
      Thus, the distribution of the incipient boiling times can be known quantitatively.
    </p>
    <p num="47">
      FIG. 4 illustrates the operational principle of the ink jet ejection in a bubble jet printer as an exemplary ink jet printer using the thermal energy.
      <br/>
      In this FIG., The heat flux q and the contact angle  THETA  used in the calculation described in the foregoing are shown.
    </p>
    <p num="48">The ink is supplied into a fine liquid passage. the ink is exposed to the ambient air at the orifice constituting an ink discharge outlet of the passage, and therefore, a meniscus is formed at the orifice ((1) of FIG. 4).</p>
    <p num="49">Upon electric energy supply to the heater (electro-thermal transducer) having the surface area SH the heater generates heat to heat the ink.</p>
    <p num="50">
      By the heating, a part of the ink is evaporated into a bubble ((2) of FIG. 4).
      <br/>
      The bubble expands by the rapid evaporation of the ink ((3) and (4) of FIG. 4).
      <br/>
      Then, the ink in the passage is discharged through the orifice by the expansion of the bubble.
      <br/>
      The bubble reaches its maximum volume state, and thereafter, the ink is cooled by the enclosing ink through the interface between the ink and the vapor, by which the bubble is collapsed.
      <br/>
      By the cooling, the ink ejected through the orifice is torn from the remainder in the passage, and the ejected ink travels in the form of a droplet ((5) and (6) of FIG. 4).
      <br/>
      The bubble is extinguished, by which the initial state is restored ((7) of FIG. 4).
    </p>
    <p num="51">
      In (1) of FIG. 4, the ink in the passage is exposed to the ambience.
      <br/>
      The heater on the wall (bottom wall) of the passage is supplied with electric current, so that the ink at the heater is evaporated to produce a bubble, which rapidly grows as shown in (2)-(4).
      <br/>
      The resultant force is effective to discharge the ink (5)-(7).
    </p>
    <p num="52">Comparison Between the Calculation and the Experiment Data</p>
    <p num="53">The comparison is made between the results of the calculation described in the foregoing with the data obtained by experiments carried out using a system shown in FIG. 5.</p>
    <p num="54">
      In the system of FIG. 5, a recording head 51 had a heater having the same surface area of 30 microns * 150 microns and having the resistance of 68 ohm., the heater being made of Hf B2, for the purpose of comparison with the calculation results.
      <br/>
      The heater was driven by a driver 52 with the voltage of 24.4 V providing the heat flux of approx. 2 * 108 W/m2.
      <br/>
      The voltage applied from the driver was in the form of a pulse voltage having a frequency of 0.5 Hz. The pulse width was changed.
    </p>
    <p num="55">
      The droplets ejected through the orifice of the head 51 with different pulse widths were monitored by a TV monitor 56 through a microscope 54 and a mirror 55 with illumination by a stroboscope 53 providing synchronized illumination of 0.5 Hz. The number of the ejection drives for which the ejections of the ink were monitored was 100 for each of the pulse widths.
      <br/>
      The nucleation probability was obtained as the number of the actual ink ejections in the 100 ejection drives.
    </p>
    <p num="56">
      In FIG. 3, the results of the experiments are plotted.
      <br/>
      It is proved that the present method and system are usable, without essential modification, to analysis of the bubble production in an ink jet printer using a thermal energy such as a bubble jet printer.
      <br/>
      It has also been confirmed that the results of calculations according to this method agreed with the experiment data obtained heretofore as to the effect, to the bubble generation phenomenon, of the change of the heat flux, the effect of the dissolved air in the ink, effect of the wettability of the heating surface or the like.
    </p>
    <p num="57">
      In the method described in the foregoing, the calculations for the homogeneous nucleation and for the heterogeneous nucleation are executed separately from each other, but they may be made simultaneously.
      <br/>
      For simplification, only one may be taken.
      <br/>
      However, it is preferable to obtain the nucleation probability on the basis of the separated calculations for the homogeneous and heterogeneous nucleations, and then, they are added, the separation having not been recognized heretofore.
    </p>
    <p num="58">Thus, the nucleation rate dependent on the ink temperature is integrated in the time and space regions, so that the change of the integrated nucleation probability can be known, by which the stochastic properties of the nucleation in the ink jet printer can be quantitatively obtained.</p>
    <p num="59">
      As described in the foregoing, according to the present invention, the quantitatively analysis of the stochastic aspect of the nucleation phenomenon in the ink jet printer can be accomplished.
      <br/>
      This is used for the designing and evaluation of the ink jet printer using the thermal energy such as the bubble jet printer.
