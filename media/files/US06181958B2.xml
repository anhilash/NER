      <br/>
      A system for determining a biologic constituent including hematocrit transcutaneously, noninvasively and continuously.
      <br/>
      A finger clip assembly includes including at least a pair of emitters and a photodiode in appropriate alignment to enable operation in either a transmissive mode or a reflectance mode.
      <br/>
      At least one predetermined wavelength of light is passed onto or through body tissues such as a finger, earlobe, or scalp, etc. and attenuation of light at that wavelength is detected.
      <br/>
      Likewise, the change in blood flow is determined by various techniques including optical, pressure, piezo and strain gage methods.
      <br/>
      Mathematical manipulation of the detected values compensates for the effects of body tissue and fluid and determines the hematocrit value.
      <br/>
      If an additional wavelength of light is used which attenuates light substantially differently by oxyhemoglobin and reduced hemoglobin, then the blood oxygen saturation value, independent of hematocrit may be determined.
      <br/>
      Further, if an additional wavelength of light is used which greatly attenuates light due to bilirubin (440 nm) or glucose (1060 nm), then the bilirubin or glucose value may also be determined.
      <br/>
      Also how to determine the hematocrit with a two step DC analysis technique is provided.
      <br/>
      Then a pulse wave is not required, so this method may be utilized in states of low blood pressure or low blood flow.

    <heading>BACKGROUND</heading>
    <p num="2">The present invention is related to U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,372,136 and 5,499,627 the text and drawings of which are incorporated herein by reference as if reproduced in full.</p>
    <heading>THE FIELD OF INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="3">
      The present invention relates to improvements in the systems and methods for non-invasively measuring one or more biologic constituent concentration values.
      <br/>
      More particularly, the present invention relates to non-invasive spectrophotometric systems and methods for quantitatively and continuously monitoring the hematocrit and other blood parameters.
    </p>
    <heading>THE PRIOR ART</heading>
    <p num="4">
      Modern medical practice utilizes a number of procedures and indicators to assess a patient's condition.
      <br/>
      One of these indicators is the patient's hematocrit.
      <br/>
      Hematocrit (often abbreviated as HCT) is the volume expressed as a percentage of the patient's blood which is occupied by red corpuscles, commonly referred to as red blood cells.
      <br/>
      The present invention is presented in the context of hematocrit.
      <br/>
      However, it is to be understood that the teachings of the present invention apply to any desired biologic constituent parameter.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      Medical professionals routinely desire to know the hematocrit of a patient.
      <br/>
      In order to determine hematocrit using any of the techniques available to date, it is necessary to draw a sample of blood by puncturing a vein or invading a capillary.
      <br/>
      Then, using widely accepted techniques, the sample of blood is subjected to either high-speed centrifuge, cell counting, ultrasonic, conductometric or photometric methods of evaluating the sample of blood in a fixed container.
      <br/>
      Prior U.S. Pat. No. 5,372,136 indicates a system and methodology for determining the hematocrit non-invasively, without puncturing or invading the body, spectrophotometrically and continuously in a subject.
      <br/>
      The present invention relates to improvements upon the above cited system.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      Beyond the above referenced patent, others have suggested various means of noninvasive measurement of hematocrit.
      <br/>
      Specifically, Mendelson, U.S. Pat. No. 5,277,181; Seeker, U.S. Pat. No. 5,188,108; Gonatas, U.S. Pat. No. 5,528,365; Ishikawa, U.S. Pat. No. 5,522,388; Shiga, U.S. Pat. No. 4,927,264; Tsuchiya, U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,441,054, 5,529,065, 5,517,987 and 5,477,051; and Chance, U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,353,799, 5,402,778, and 5,673,701 have attempted to define means of directly measuring desired biologic constituents such as hematocrit.
      <br/>
      Even though the various patents indicate the need to utilize multiple wavelengths measured at different detection sites and/or the need to perform differential or ratiometric operations on the detected optical signal, all fail to isolate and resolve the individual and specific scattering and absorption coefficients of the desired constituent.
      <br/>
      At best they address only bulk attenuation coefficients and/or bulk diffusion constants of the scattering media while-attempting to resolve such constraints as tissue nonhomogeneity.
      <br/>
      As an example, tissue may be considered to contain a bulk absorptive coefficient due to blood, collagen, water, fibers, bone, fingernail, etc.
      <br/>
      Hence, in order to determine the absorptive coefficient of the blood itself, the bulk value of the tissue per se must be prorated by the amounts of the above constituents.
      <br/>
      Secondly, the actual absorptive coefficient of the blood must then be decoupled or isolated from its proration factor as well.
    </p>
    <heading>OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="7">Thus, it is an object of the present invention to provide an improvement in the systems and methods for the non-invasive (transcutaneous) and continuous determination of the blood Hematocrit in living tissue.</p>
    <p num="8">It is yet another object of the present invention to provide an improvement in the systems and methods for the non-invasive (transcutaneous) and continuous determination of the blood constituents, including glucose, bilirubin, cholesterol, tissue water, etc. in living tissue.</p>
    <p num="9">It is another object of the present invention to provide a system and method and apparatus for the display of both immediate and/or continuous visual information regarding the HCT of the subject.</p>
    <p num="10">It is yet another object of the present invention to provide a repeatable and reliable method and apparatus for the non-invasive determination of hematocrit transcutaneously and in real time even under varying physiological conditions.</p>
    <p num="11">Still another object of the present invention is to provide a method and apparatus for the instantaneous determination of the bulk absorption coefficient of the scattering media.</p>

    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="13">
      In one aspect, the present invention accomplishes the transcutaneous, noninvasive, real-time and continuous measurement of the hematocrit and other blood constituents of the patient.
      <br/>
      That is, the electronic circuitry necessary is included to receive signals from a detector and to generate appropriate signals at various input sites as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,372,136. Yet another aspect of the present invention is the ability to extract the blood absorption coefficient from the bulk tissue diffusion constant or the bulk absorption coefficient of the scattering media by requiring both physical and mathematical operations.

      Introduction
    </p>
    <p num="20">
      Earlier spectrophotometric techniques have fallen short of being able to fully characterize the individual blood absorbance coefficients.
      <br/>
      The following discussion demonstrates the method of decoupling, or isolating from the bulk tissue attenuation parameters (including the convoluted absorptive and scattering parameters) the individual blood absorptive constants.
      <br/>
      This unique method identifies, isolates and compartmentalizes each of the contributing biologic elements of the tissue media.
      <br/>
      This decoupling process can either isolate the blood absorbance of interest and/or eliminate the scattering contribution from the bulk media measurement.

    <p num="25">II. Analysis</p>
    <p num="26">The light flux, or intensity, i, is given by  (Equation image '3' not included in text)</p>
    <p num="27">When evaluated at  RHO =d, one solution to equation (1) is:  (Equation image '4' not included in text)</p>
    <p num="28">
      where A is a nontrivial function of the tissue scattering coefficient, S, the distance, d (if small), and the bulk attenuation coefficient,  ALPHA .
      <br/>
      If  ALPHA  d&gt;&gt;1, then (8) becomes:
      <br/>
      i=Ae- ALPHA d   (9)
    </p>
    <p num="29">where  (Equation image '5' not included in text)</p>
    <p num="30">where n is the power that d is raised to.</p>
    <p num="31">FIG. (2) shows the actual patient data plot of ln(i) vs. d, where  ALPHA  is determined directly from the slope of the line.</p>
    <p num="32">
      The attenuation coefficient,  ALPHA , is a bulk term which encompasses the attenuation measurement sensitivity to variations in skin color, presence of bone, callous, blood and water content, etc.
      <br/>
      In addition, a expresses the optical "path lengthening" effects of both the absorption and scattering characteristics of the tissue.
      <br/>
      Therefore, since  ALPHA  is a function of HCT and the intensity of the transmitted light can be measured, the HCT can be calculated by manipulation of the preceding relationships.
    </p>
    <p num="33">
      Beginning with equation (9), the troublesome and complex tissue function, A, can be eliminated by taking the logarithm of (9) and differentiating with respect to the distance, d. Unfortunately the term Xb is not known but changes with time as a result of a patient's cardiac cycle.
      <br/>
      Therefore, by differentiating with respect to time, this parameter becomes the time rate of change of blood volume which can be obtained through several methods described below.
      <br/>
      These time and distance derivatives may be performed in either order.

      Equations (3)-(7) are now used to extract the hematocrit from  ALPHA .

    <p num="53">
      It should be reiterated that the change in received intensity with time is a result of the change in normalized blood volume resulting from the cardiac cycle itself as blood pulses through the examined tissue.
      <br/>
      As the intensity of the received light is measured, its time rate of change can be calculated.
      <br/>
      The change with distance can be determined by placing multiple emitters (such as 1-4 in FIG. 1 A) and/or multiple detectors such that multiple thicknesses of tissue and hence, lengths of tissue are penetrated.

    <p num="55">further, the following can be defined for the illuminated tissue:</p>
    <p num="56">

      <br/>
      Vw =Volume of water, and
      <br/>
      Vs =Volume of skin, tissue and other non-water or blood components.

    <p num="57">By definition,  (Equation image '23' not included in text)</p>
    <p num="58">differentiating (20) with respect to time gives:  (Equation image '24' not included in text)</p>

    <p num="61">
      It is emphasized that  ALPHA  is a function of the bulk absorption and scattering coefficients, K and S, as well as hematocrit, H. Further, that K and S are functions of the fractional volumes of each constituent, Xb, Xs, and Xw, which must be used to prorate the individual absorption and scattering coefficients, Kb, Ks, Kw, Sb and Ss.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the transducer system must be responsive not only to a change in volume ( DELTA V) due to the influx of the blood, but must also be responsive to the normalized change in volume of blood, normalized to the total volume of the finger (V.function.) or tissue being measured,  (Equation image '27' not included in text)

    <p num="62">For Reflectance (R) measurements in homogenous tissue:</p>
    <p num="63">R=Ae- ALPHA r, where A.apprxeq.(1/r2 +1/ ALPHA r), where r is the radial distance, and  (Equation image '28' not included in text)</p>
    <p num="64">
      However, for tissue, which is typically non-homogeneous with a dermal and subcutaneous layer, the reflectance will not be a trivial function but can be described as approximately:
      <br/>
      R=�(C1 +C2)exp(-C3 * r)�/rn
    </p>
    <p num="65">
      Where C1 and C2 are inter-related photon flux densities between the dermal layer 12 and the subcutaneous layer, 12a (see FIGS. 1C and 1E).
      <br/>
      Likewise, C3 is a strong function of z1, z2,  ALPHA 1, and  ALPHA 2 ; i.e., the thickness of the dermis or dermal layer 12, subcutaneous layer 12a, and their respective  ALPHA 's.
    </p>
    <p num="66">
      Since C3 ' is a function of the inter-related photon flux densities C1 and/or C2 and if Xb'1 does not equal Xb'2, then the slope C3 ' will not be nulled out by the Xb' monitors mentioned.
      <br/>
      Therefore, Xb2 ' must be greater than Xb1 '. Then the pressure or piezo monitors will compensate correctly.
      <br/>
      The circular pressure balloon is ideal for not only sensing the change in a pressure, but also providing, a pressure against the dermis causing Xb1 ' to be small.
      <br/>
      However, recognizing that the penetration depth of the 800 nm light typically extends through dermal layer 12 into the deep tissue, subcutaneous layer 12a, a different wavelength selection is appropriate.
      <br/>
      Thusly, when the photons only penetrate into the dermal layer 12, C3 ' will only be a function of z1 and  ALPHA 1.
      <br/>
      Those selected wavelengths, as mentioned in U.S. Pat. No. 5,372,136, would be the green (570-595 nm) wavelength and 1300 nm wavelength.
      <br/>
      The green wavelengths are used as the hematocrit bearing wavelength and the 1300 nm wavelength is used as the non-hematocrit bearing, or reference wavelength.
      <br/>
      That is, for reflectance measurements the green (Gr)-1300 wavelength pair would give the hematocrit information as:  (Equation image '29' not included in text)

    <p num="135">
      Since hematocrit is an example of the desired biological constituent concentration value of interest, selection criteria of the preferred wavelength must include an understanding of equation (5).
      <br/>
      That is, a wavelength whose coefficients Ks, Kw, Kp are small compared to Kb and which are also insensitive to oxygen saturation status must be selected.
      <br/>
      Such wavelengths include 805 nm, 590 nm, 569 nm and other isobestic wavelengths with negligible water absorption.
      <br/>
      While non-isobestic wavelengths, with small water absorption, could function, a second wavelength is needed to null out the oxygen saturation effects.
    </p>
    <p num="136">
      If the desired biologic constituent value of interest is the blood glucose, bilirubin, cholesterol or other parameters, then a second wavelength must be chosen.
      <br/>
      The first wavelength, 805 nm, is used to measure the hematocrit, H, after which a Kp805 (the absorbance of plasma at  LAMBDA =805 nm) can be determined.
      <br/>
      Then, knowing the H, a second wavelength, 570 nm, is chosen where Kp570 is less than Kp805.
      <br/>
      Similarly, if the first wavelength used to measure the H and the reference glucose, Kp (glucose) is 570 nm, the second wavelength, 1060 nm, is chosen where Kp570 is much less than Kp1060.
      <br/>
      In the case of bilirubin, the first wavelength used to measure the H and the reference bilirubin, Kp (bilirubin), is 570 nm, the second wavelength, 440 nm, is then chosen when Kp570 is much less than Kp440.
      <br/>
      The selection of these above mentioned wavelengths therefore assures uniqueness for the measurement of the desired biologic constituent.
    </p>
    <p num="137">
      Additionally for glucose determination, recall that the 1300 nm wavelength is not hematocrit or hemoglobin dependent but will be glucose sensitive.
      <br/>
      This is primarily due to the dependence of the scattering coefficient on the difference between the index of refraction of pure water and glucose, i.e.: recall
    </p>
    <p num="138">Sb8 =H (1-H)  SIGMA s8 (from equation 7) where:</p>
    <p num="139">SIGMA s8 =8 PI 2 ETA 02 ( ETA '8 -1)2 * bv / LAMBDA 2</p>
    <p num="140">where  ETA '8 =index of refraction of the RBC hemoglobin at 800 nm relative to plasma  ETA 0 (the plasma index of refraction), and,</p>

    <p num="144">
      Therefore, the 8 13 ratio has both hematocrit and glucose information.
      <br/>
      Whereas the  ALPHA 8 *  ALPHA '8 / DELTA P (equation 18a) ratio has only hematocrit information.

    <p num="147">
      All of the above mentioned deficiencies in pulse oximetry can be eliminated by understanding equation (13).

      <br/>
      Step Two, measure the strain gage resistance when the finger is blood filled, for example by suction.
