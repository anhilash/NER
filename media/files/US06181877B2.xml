      In a rangefinder apparatus, a clamping circuit receives a far-side signal I2 output from a first signal processing circuit and outputs a signal I2c having a greater value than a clamp signal Ic and the far-side signal I2.
      <br/>
      An arithmetic circuit receives a near-side signal I1 output from a second signal processing circuit and the signal I2c output from the clamping circuit, calculates an output ratio (I1/(I1+I2c)), and outputs an output ratio signal.
      <br/>
      An integrating circuit receives the output ratio signal and, together with an integrating capacitor, integrates the output ratio signal several times.
      <br/>
      When switching the level of the clamp signal Ic before subsequent distance measuring operations in a continuous distance measurement, a clamp level switching circuit adds a value to the clamp signal, setting a new level.

    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="1">
      1.
      <br/>
      Field of the Invention
    </p>
    <p num="2">The present invention relates to a rangefinder apparatus for measuring the distance to an object to be measured; and, in particular, to an active type rangefinder apparatus suitably used in a camera or the like.</p>
    <p num="3">2. Related Background Art</p>
    <p num="4">
      In active type rangefinder apparatus used in cameras and the like, an infrared light-emitting diode (IRED) projects a luminous flux toward an object to be measured, the reflected light of thus projected luminous flux is received by a position sensitive detector (PSD), a signal outputted from the PSD is arithmetically processed by a signal processing circuit and an arithmetic circuit and then is outputted as distance information, and the distance to the object is detected by a central processing unit (CPU).
      <br/>
      In general, since errors may occur when the distance is measured upon a single light-projecting operation, light is projected a plurality of times so as to obtain a plurality of distance information items, which are then integrated by an integrating circuit and averaged.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      As such an active type rangefinder apparatus, one shown in FIG. 1 has conventionally been known.
      <br/>
      FIG. 1 is a configurational view of a rangefinder apparatus in accordance with first prior art.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      In the rangefinder apparatus shown in this drawing, a CPU 1 controls individual elements according to a program stored in an electrically erasable and programmable read-only memory (EEPROM) 2 and, under the control of the CPU 1, a driver 3 drives an IRED 4 so as to make it output infrared light, which is then projected through a projection lens 101 to an object to be measured.
      <br/>
      The infrared light reflected by the object is collected by a PSD 5 by way of a light-receiving lens 102, and the PSD 5 outputs two signals I1 and I2 according to the position at which the reflected light of the infrared light is received.
      <br/>
      A first signal processing circuit 11 eliminates a steady-state light component contained in the signal I1 which becomes a noise, whereas a second signal processing circuit 12 eliminates a steady-state light component contained in the signal I2 which becomes a noise.

      According to the signals I1 and I2 from which the steady-state light components have been eliminated, an arithmetic circuit 14 determines an output ratio (I1 /(I1 +I2)) by an arithmetic operation, and outputs an output ratio signal corresponding to the distance to the object.
      <br/>
      An integrating circuit 15 integrates at an integrating capacitor 6 the output ratio signals thus outputted from the arithmetic circuit 14 a plurality of times, thereby improving the S/N ratio.
      <br/>
      The signal outputted from this integrating circuit 15 (hereinafter referred to as "AF signal") corresponds to the distance to the object.
      <br/>
      Then, according to the AF signal outputted from the integrating circuit 15, the CPU 1 determines a distance signal by carrying out a predetermined arithmetic operation, and controls a lens driving circuit 7 according to this distance signal, so as to move a lens 8 to an in-focus position.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      FIG. 2 is a graph showing the relationship between the AF signal outputted from the integrating circuit 15 in this first prior art and the distance to the object.
      <br/>
      In this graph, the abscissa indicates the reciprocal (1/L) of the distance L to the object, whereas the ordinate indicates the output ratio (I1 /(I1 +I2)), i.e., AF signal.
      <br/>
      As shown in this graph, the output ratio has substantially a linear relationship with respect to the reciprocal (1/L) of the distance L at a certain distance L4 or less, such that the output ratio decreases as the distance L is longer (1/L is smaller).
      <br/>
      At the distance L4 or greater, by contrast, the influence of the steady-state light component increases as the distance L is greater.
      <br/>
      Letting In (In &gt;= 0) be the steady-state light component, the output ratio is (I1 +In)/(I1 +In +I2 +In) whereby the output ratio would shift so as to increase at the distance L4 or greater.
      <br/>
      Also, since In occurs randomly, it becomes unstable depending on the distance measuring condition.
      <br/>
      It is due to the fact that, as the distance L increases, the intensity of reflected light received by the PSD 5 decreases, whereby the steady-state light component In becomes relatively greater.
      <br/>
      If such a phenomenon occurs, the distance to the object L cannot be determined uniquely from the output ratio.

      FIG. 3 is a configurational view of the rangefinder apparatus in accordance with second prior art.
      <br/>
      In the rangefinder apparatus in accordance with the second prior art, a clamping circuit 13 is disposed between the second signal processing circuit 12 and arithmetic circuit 14 in the rangefinder apparatus in accordance with the first prior art.
      <br/>
      The clamping circuit 13 inputs therein the signal I2 outputted from the second signal processing circuit 12, compares a clamp signal Ic having a certain constant level and the signal I2 with each other in terms of magnitude of their levels, and outputs the clamp signal Ic if the former is greater and outputs the signal I2 as it is if not.
      <br/>
      Namely, the arithmetic circuit 14 outputs the output ratios (I1 /(I1 +I2) and (I1 /(I1 +Ic) when the distance L to the object is shorter and longer, respectively.

    <p num="10">
      FIG. 4 is a graph showing the relationship between the AF signal outputted from the integrating circuit 15 in this second prior art and the distance to the object.

      As shown in this graph, in each of the respective ranges smaller and greater than a certain distance L4, the output ratio has substantially a linear relationship with respect to the reciprocal (1/L) of the distance L, such that the output ratio decreases as the distance L is greater(1/L is smaller).

      As a consequence, the distance L to the object can be determined uniquely from the output ratio.

    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="11">
      In the rangefinder apparatus in accordance with the second prior art (FIG. 3), however, when switching the level of the clamp signal Ic in the clamping circuit 13, if the level is once initialized and then a new level is to be set, it will take time to switch these levels.
      <br/>
      Namely, the time for initializing the level of the clamp signal Ic and the time, subsequent thereto, for setting a new level for the clamp signal Ic are necessary.
    </p>
    <p num="12">
      This problem of clamp level switching time would be serious in particular when switching the levels of clamp signal during a continuous distance measurement in which a plurality of distance measuring operations are carried out in series.
      <br/>
      Examples thereof include the cases where the levels of clamp signal in distance measuring operations are switched according to results of their preceding distance measuring operations, where errors in distance measurements are determined from individual measured distance values obtained by distance measuring operations with respective values of level of the clamp signal, and the like.
      <br/>
      In such a continuous distance measurement, if it takes time to switch the level of the clamp signal Ic upon the second or later distance measuring operation, then the time difference required for the period from the release operation until the exposure becomes longer.
      <br/>
      As a consequence, when a moving object (object to be measured) is to be photographed, for example, a photograph with a desirable composition may not be obtained.
    </p>
    <p num="13">In order to overcome the problems mentioned above, it is an object of the present invention to provide a rangefinder apparatus which takes only a short time to switch levels of a clamp signal.</p>
    <p num="14">The rangefinder apparatus in accordance with the present invention comprises: (1) light-projecting means for projecting a luminous flux toward an object to be measured; (2) light-receiving means for receiving reflected light of the luminous flux projected to the object at a light-receiving position on a position sensitive detector corresponding to a distance to the object and outputting, according to the light-receiving position, a far-side signal having a greater value as the distance is longer if the quantity of received light is constant, and a short-side signal having a greater value as the distance is shorter if the quantity of received light is constant; (3) clamping means for inputting therein the far-side signal, comparing the level of the far-side signal with the level of a clamp signal in terms of magnitude, and outputting the far-side signal as it is if the level of the far-side signal is at the level of the clamp signal or greater and outputting the clamp signal if not; (4) arithmetic means for calculating a ratio between the near-side signal and the signal outputted from the clamping means and outputting thus obtained output ratio signal; (5) integrating means for accumulating and integrating the output ratio signal and outputting an integrated signal corresponding to the result of integration; (6) detecting means for detecting a measured distance value according to the integrated signal; and (7) clamp level switching means for adding a predetermined value to an already set value so as to set a new level when switching the level of the clamp signal before the second or later distance measuring operation in a continuous distance measurement in which a plurality of distance measuring operations are carried out in series.</p>
    <p num="15">
      This rangefinder apparatus operates as follows.
      <br/>
      The luminous flux outputted from the light-projecting means toward the object to be measured is reflected by the object, this reflected light is received by the light-receiving means at the light-receiving position on the position sensitive detector corresponding to the distance to the object, and the far-side signal having a greater value as the distance is longer if the quantity of the received light is constant and the near-side signal having a greater value as the distance is shorter if the quantity of the received light is constant are outputted according to the light-receiving position.
      <br/>
      The clamping means compares the far-side signal with the clamp signal in terms of magnitude of their levels.
      <br/>
      Then, the far-side signal is outputted if the level of the far-side signal is not lower than that of the clamp signal; otherwise, the clamp signal is outputted.
      <br/>
      The arithmetic means calculates the ratio between the near-side signal and the signal outputted from the clamping means, thereby outputting the output ratio signal.
      <br/>
      The integrating means accumulates and integrates the output ratio signal, thereby outputting the integrated signal corresponding to the result of integration.
      <br/>
      According to the integrated signal outputted from the integrating means, the detecting means detects the measured distance value.
      <br/>
      Then, when switching the level of the clamp signal before the second or later distance measuring operation in a continuous distance measurement in which a plurality of distance measuring operations are carried out in series, the clamp level switching means adds a predetermined value to an already set value, so as to set a new level.

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
    <p num="19">
      In the following, an embodiment of the present invention will be explained in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings.
      <br/>
      Here, in the explanation of the drawings, constituents identical to each other will be referred to with letters or numerals identical to each other, without their overlapping descriptions being repeated.
      <br/>
      Also, the following explanation relates to a case where an active type rangefinder apparatus in accordance with this embodiment is employed as a rangefinder apparatus of an autofocus type camera.
    </p>
    <p num="20">
      First, the overall configuration of the rangefinder apparatus in accordance with this embodiment will be explained.
      <br/>
      FIG. 5 is a configurational view of the rangefinder apparatus in accordance with this embodiment.
    </p>
    <p num="21">
      A CPU 1 is used for controlling the whole camera equipped with this rangefinder apparatus, and controls the whole camera including the rangefinder apparatus according to a program and parameters prestored in an EEPROM 2.
      <br/>
      In the rangefinder apparatus shown in this drawing, the CPU 1 regulates a driver 3, so as to control the emission of infrared light from an IRED (infrared light-emitting diode) 4.
      <br/>
      Also, the CPU 1 controls actions of an autofocus IC (hereinafter referred to as "AFIC") 10, and inputs the AF signal outputted from the AFIC 10.
    </p>
    <p num="22">
      By way of a light-projecting lens 101 disposed at the front face of the IRED 4, the infrared light emitted from the IRED 4 is projected onto the object to be measured.
      <br/>
      The infrared light is partly reflected by the object, and the resulting reflected light is received, by way of a light-receiving lens 102 disposed at the front face of a PSD (position sensitive detector) 5, at a position on the light-receiving surface of the PSD 5.
      <br/>
      This light-receiving position corresponds to the distance to the object.
      <br/>
      Then, the PSD 5 outputs two signals I1 and I2 which correspond to the light-receiving position.
      <br/>
      The signal I1 is a near-side signal which has a greater value as the distance is shorter if the quantity of received light is constant, whereas the signal I2 is a far-side signal which has a greater value as the distance is longer if the quantity of received light is constant.
      <br/>
      The sum of the signals I1 and I2 represents the quantity of reflected light received by the PSD 5, whereas the output ratio (I1 /(I1 +I2)) represents the light-receiving position on the light-receiving surface of the PSD 5, i.e., the distance to the object.
      <br/>
      The near-side signal I1 is inputted to the PSDN terminal of the AFIC 10, whereas the far-side signal I2 is inputted to the PSDF terminal of the AFIC 10.
      <br/>
      In practice, however, depending on external conditions, there are cases where respective signals in which a steady-state light component I0 is added to the near-side signal I1 and far-side signal I2 are fed into the AFIC 10.
    </p>
    <p num="23">
      The AFIC 10 is an integrated circuit (IC) constituted by a first signal processing circuit 11, a second signal processing circuit 12, a clamping circuit 13, an arithmetic circuit 14, an integrating circuit 15, and a clamp level switching circuit 16.
      <br/>
      The first signal processing circuit 11 inputs therein a signal I1 +I0 outputted from the PSD 5, and eliminates the steady-state light component I0 therefrom, thereby outputting the near-side signal I1 ; whereas the second signal processing circuit 12 inputs therein a signal I2 +I0 outputted from the PSD 5, and eliminates the steady-state light component I0 therefrom, thereby outputting the far-side signal I2.
    </p>
    <p num="24">
      The clamping circuit 13 inputs therein the far-side signal I2 outputted from the second signal processing circuit 12, compares a clamp signal Ic having a certain level and the far-side signal I2 in terms of the magnitude of their levels.
      <br/>
      If the former is greater than the latter, the clamp signal Ic is outputted; otherwise, the far-side signal I2 is outputted as it is.
      <br/>
      In the following, the signal outputted from the clamping circuit 13 is represented by I2c.
      <br/>
      The clamp level switching circuit 16 switches the level of the clamp signal Ic in the clamping circuit 13 according to an instruction from the CPU 1.
    </p>
    <p num="25">
      The arithmetic circuit 14 inputs therein the near-side signal I1 outputted from the first signal processing circuit 11 and the signal I2c (the signal having a greater value in the far-side signal I2 and the clamp signal Ic) outputted from the clamping circuit 13, calculates an output ratio (I1 /(I1 +I2c)), and outputs an output ratio signal representing the result thereof.
      <br/>
      The integrating circuit 15 inputs therein the output ratio signal and, together with an integrating capacitor 6 connected to the CINT terminal of the AFIC 10, accumulates the output ratio a plurality of times, thereby improving the S/N ratio.
      <br/>
      Thus accumulated output ratio is outputted from the SOUT terminal of the AFIC 10 as the AF signal.
      <br/>
      The CPU 1 inputs therein the AF signal outputted from the AFIC 10, converts the AF signal into a distance signal by carrying out a predetermined arithmetic operation, and sends out the resulting distance signal to a lens driving circuit 7.
      <br/>
      According to this distance signal, the lens driving circuit 7 causes a taking lens 8 to effect a focusing action.

    <p num="26">
      Specific respective circuit configurations of the first signal processing circuit 11, clamping circuit 13, integrating circuit 15, and clamp level switching circuit 16 in the AFIC 10 will now be explained.

      FIG. 7 is a circuit diagram of the clamp circuit 13 in the rangefinder apparatus in accordance with this embodiment.

      <br/>
      The current (I1 +I0) outputted from the near-distance-side terminal of the PSD 5 is fed to the "-" input terminal of an operational amplifier 20 in the first signal processing circuit 11 by way of the PSDN terminal of the AFIC 10.
      <br/>
      The output terminal of the operational amplifier 20 is connected to the base terminal of a transistor 21, whereas the collector terminal of the transistor 21 is connected to the base terminal of a transistor 22.
      <br/>
      The collector terminal of the transistor 22 is connected to the "-" input terminal of an operational amplifier 23 and also to the arithmetic circuit 14.

      Further, the cathode terminal of a compression diode 24 is connected to the collector terminal of the transistor 22, whereas the cathode terminal of a compression diode 25 is connected to the "+" input terminal of the operational amplifier 23.
      <br/>
      A first reference power source 26 is connected to the respective anode terminals of the compression diodes 24 and 25.

      Also, a steady-state light eliminating capacitor 27 is externally attached to the CHF terminal of the AFIC 10, and is connected to the base terminal of a steady-state light eliminating transistor 28 within the first signal processing circuit 11.
      <br/>
      The steady-state light eliminating capacitor 27 and the operational amplifier 23 are connected to each other by way of a switch 29, whose ON/OFF is controlled by the CPU 1.
      <br/>
      The collector terminal of the steady-state light eliminating transistor 28 is connected to the "-" input terminal of the operational amplifier 20, whereas the emitter terminal of the transistor 28 is grounded by way of a resistor 30.

    <p num="29">
      The circuit diagram of the clamp circuit 13 is shown in FIG. 7.
      <br/>
      The "+" input terminal of a determination comparator 37 in the clamp circuit 13 is connected to the collector terminal of the transistor 22 in the second signal processing circuit 12, and to the input terminal of the arithmetic circuit 14 by way of a switch 38.
      <br/>
      On the other hand, the "-" input terminal of the determination comparator 37 is connected to the collector terminal of a transistor 51 as with the transistor 22 and compression diode 24 connected to the "+" input terminal thereof, and is also connected to the input terminal of the arithmetic terminal 14 by way of a switch 39.

    <p num="30">
      Also, a clamp current source 41 is connected to the base terminal of the transistor 51.

      In this clamp current source 41, a constant current source 411 and a switch 415 are connected in series, a constant current source 412 and a switch 416 are connected in series, a constant current source 413 and a switch 417 are connected in series, and a constant current source 414 and a switch 418 are connected in series, whereas these four groups are connected in parallel.
      <br/>
      The constant current sources 411, 412, 413, and 414 output constant current values of 0.125 nA, 0.25 nA, 0.5 nA, and 1.0 nA, respectively.
      <br/>
      The switches 415 to 418 open and close under the control of their corresponding signals Q1 to Q4 outputted from the clamp level switching circuit 16.

      FIG. 8 is a circuit diagram of the clamp level switching circuit 16 in the rangefinder apparatus in accordance with this embodiment.

      The clamp level switching circuit 16 is a 4-bit binary counter circuit constituted by an inverter INV and D-type flip-flops FF1 to FF4.

      The inverter INV inverts the CLALV signal outputted from the CPU 1.

    </p>
    <p num="34">
      The outline of operations of thus configured AFIC 10 will now be explained with reference to FIGS. 2 and 3.
      <br/>
      When not causing the IRED 4 to emit light, the CPU 1 keeps the switch 29 of the first signal processing circuit 11 in its ON state.
      <br/>
      The steady-state light component I0 outputted from the PSD 5 at this time is inputted to the first signal processing circuit 11, and is amplified as a current by the current amplifier constituted by the operational amplifier 20 and the transistors 21 and 22.
      <br/>
      Thus amplified signal is logarithmically compressed by the compression diode 24, so as to be converted into a voltage signal, which is then fed to the "-" input terminal of the operational amplifier 23.
      <br/>
      When the signal inputted to the operational amplifier 20 is higher, the cathode potential of the compression diode 24 becomes higher, thus increasing the signal outputted from the operational amplifier 23, whereby the capacitor 27 is charged.
      <br/>
      As a consequence, a base current is supplied to the transistor 28, so that a collector current flows into the transistor 28, whereby, of the signal I0 fed into the first signal processing circuit 11, the signal inputted to the operational amplifier 20 decreases.
      <br/>
      In the state where the operation of this closed loop is stable, all of the signal I0 inputted to the first signal processing circuit 11 flows into the transistor 28, whereby the charge corresponding to the base current at this time is stored in the capacitor 27.
    </p>
    <p num="35">
      When the CPU 1 turns OFF the switch 29 while causing the IRED 4 to emit light, of the signal I1 +I0 outputted from the PSD 5 at this time, the steady-state light component I0 flows as the collector current into the transistor 28 to which the base potential is applied by the charge stored in the capacitor 27, whereas the near-side signal I1 is amplified as a current by the current amplifier constituted by the operational amplifier 20 and the transistors 21 and 22 and then is logarithmically compressed by the compression diode 24, so as to be converted into and outputted as a voltage signal.
      <br/>
      Namely, from the first signal processing circuit 11, the near-side signal I1 is outputted alone after the steady-state light component I0 is eliminated, and thus outputted near-side signal I1 is inputted to the arithmetic circuit 14.
      <br/>
      From the second signal processing circuit 12, on the other hand, as with the first signal processing circuit 11, the far-side signal I2 is outputted alone after the steady-state light component I0 is eliminated, and thus outputted far-side signal I2 is inputted to the clamping circuit 13.

      FIG. 9 is a chart for explaining operations of the clamp level switching circuit 16 in the rangefinder apparatus in accordance with this embodiment.
      <br/>
      As shown in this chart, the clamp level switching circuit 16 increases the 4-bit output (Q4, Q3, Q2, Q1) by 1 each time a pulse of the CLALV signal is inputted from the CPU 1.
      <br/>
      Also, if 1 pulse of the CLALV signal is inputted when the 4-bit output (Q4, Q3, Q2, Q1) of the clamp level switching circuit 16 is (1, 1, 1, 1), then the 4-bit output shifts to (0, 0, 0, 0).
      <br/>
      Then, according to the value of the 4-bit output (Q4, Q3, Q2, Q1) of the clamp level switching circuit 16, the individual switches 415 to 418 in the clamp current source 41 in the clamping circuit 13 open and close, thereby setting the level of the clamp signal Ic.

      For setting the clamp signal level to 0.750 nA thereafter, the RESET signal is inputted from the CPU 1 to the clamp signal switching circuit 16 again, so as to initialize the 4-bit output (Q4, Q3, Q2, Q1) of the clamp level switching circuit 16.

      In general, however, while about several tens of milliseconds are needed for the pulse width of RESET signal, several tens of microseconds are sufficient for the period of CLALV signal.

      The rangefinder apparatus shown as the reference example in FIG. 11B operates as follows.

      <br/>
      In the example, for setting the clamp signal level to 0.75 nA before the second distance measuring operation, the RESET signal is not inputted to the clamp level switching circuit 16 again, and the 4-bit output (Q4, Q3, Q2, Q1) of the clamp level switching circuit 16 is not initialized.

      The present invention is not limited to the aforementioned embodiments and many modifications can be made thereto.
      <br/>
      For example, the invention is also applicable to a system including such an integrating circuit, in which charging and discharging of an integrating capacitor are carried out in a manner contrary to that in the aforementioned embodiments.

      That is, during the period of the first integration, the integrating capacitor 6 is charged so that the voltage level thereof ascends step by step and then discharged at a time in the second integration.

      In accordance with the present invention, as explained in detail in the foregoing, the clamp level switching means adds a predetermined level to an already set value so as to set a new level when switching the level of the clamp signal before the second or later distance measuring operation in a continuous distance measurement in which a plurality of distance measuring operations are carried out.
      <br/>
      Namely, when switching the clamp signal level, it is unnecessary to set the clamp signal level again after initializing it.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the time required for switching the clamp signal level, i.e., the time required for the continuous distance measurement, is short, whereby the time difference required for the period from the release operation until the exposure is short even in the continuous distance measurement.
