    <heading>TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
    <p num="2">The present invention relates generally to reverse-turn mimetics, including inhibitors of cell adhesion-mediated disease, as well as to a chemical library of reverse-turn mimetics.</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="3">
      Cell adhesion is critical to the viability of living organisms.
      <br/>
      Adhesion holds multicellular tissues together and directs embryonic development.
      <br/>
      It plays important roles in wound healing, eradication of infection and blood coagulation.
      <br/>
      Integrins are a family of cell surface proteins intimately involved in all of these functions.
      <br/>
      They have been found in nearly every type of human cell except red blood cells.
      <br/>
      Abnormalities in integrin function contribute to a variety of disorders including inflammatory diseases, heart attack, stroke, and cancer.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      Integrins consist of heterodimers of  ALPHA  and  BETA  subunits, non-covalently bound to each other.
      <br/>
      These cell surface receptors extend through the cell membrane into the cytoplasm.
      <br/>
      At least 15 different  ALPHA  and 9 different  BETA  subunits are known.
      <br/>
      However, because most  ALPHA  proteins associate with only a single  BETA  there are about 21 known integrin receptors.
      <br/>
      On the cell surface the heads of the two subunits contact each other to form a binding surface for extracellular protein ligands, allowing attachment to other cells or to the extracellular matrix.
      <br/>
      The affinity of these receptors may be regulated by signals from outside or within the cell.
      <br/>
      For example, recruitment of leukocytes to the site of injury or infection involves a series of adhesive interactions.
      <br/>
      Weak interaction between endothelial and leukocyte selectins and carbohydrates mediate transient adhesion and rolling of the leukocyte along the vessel wall.
      <br/>
      Various chemokines and other trigger factors released by the site of inflammation serve as signals to activate integrins from a quiescent to a high affinity state.
      <br/>
      These activated integrins then bind their cognate ligands on the surface of the endothelial cells, resulting in strong adhesion and flattening of the leukocyte.
      <br/>
      Subsequently the leukocyte migrates through the endothelium into the tissue below.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      Integrin  ALPHA 4 BETA 1 mediates cell adhesion primarily through binding to either vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) or an alternatively spliced variant of fibronectin containing the type III connecting segment (IIICS).
      <br/>
      A variety of cells involved in inflammation express  ALPHA 4 BETA 1, including lymphocytes, monocytes, basophils and eosinophils but not neutrophils.
      <br/>
      Monoclonal antibodies to the  ALPHA 4 subunit have been used to validate  ALPHA 4 -containing integrins as potential therapeutic targets in animal models of rheumatoid arthritis (Barbadillo et al.
      <br/>
      Springer Semin Immunopathol 16: 427-36, 1995; Issekutz et al.
      <br/>
      Immunology 88: 569-76, 1996), acute colitis (Podolsky et al.
      <br/>
      J Clin Invest 92: 372-80, 1993), multiple sclerosis (Yednock et al.
      <br/>
      Nature 356: 63-6, 1992), asthma (Abraham et al. J. Clin. Invest. 93: 776-87, 1994; U.S. Pat. No. 5,871,734) and diabetes (Tsukamoto et al.
      <br/>
      Cell Immunol 165: 193-201, 1995).
      <br/>
      More recently, low molecular weight peptidyl derivatives have been produced as competitive inhibitors of  ALPHA 4 BETA 1 and one has been shown to inhibit allergic airway responses in sheep (Lin et al. J Med Chem 42: 920-34, 1999).
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      It has been shown that a key sequence in IIICS involved in binding to  ALPHA 4 BETA 1 is the 25 residie peptide CS1, and within that sequence the minimally recognized motif is the tripeptide, LDV.
      <br/>
      A similar sequence, IDS, has been implicated in the binding of VCAM-1 to  ALPHA 4 BETA 1. X-ray crystal structures of an N-terminal two-domain fragment of VCAM-1 show that the IDS sequence is part of an exposed loop linking two beta-strands (Jones et al.
      <br/>
      Nature 373: 539-44, 1995; Wang et al.
      <br/>
      Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 92: 5714-8, 1995).
      <br/>
      Cyclic peptides and derivatives thereof which adopt reverse-turn conformations have proven to be inhibitors of VCAM-1 binding to  ALPHA 4 BETA 1 (WO 96/00581; WO 96/06108; Doyle et al.
      <br/>
      Int J Pept Protein Res 47: 427-36, 1996).
      <br/>
      In addition, a number of potent and selective (versus  ALPHA 5 BETA 1) cyclic peptide-based inhibitors have been discovered (Jackson et al.
      <br/>
      J Med Chem 40: 3359-68, 1997).
      <br/>
      Several non-peptidyl beta-turn mimetics have also been reported to bind  ALPHA 4 BETA 1 with IC50 s in the low micromolar range (Souers et al.
      <br/>
      Bioorg Med Chem Lett 8: 2297-302, 1998).
      <br/>
      Numerous phenylalanine and tyrosine derivatives have also been disclosed as inhibitors of  ALPHA 4 BETA 1 (WO 99/06390; WO 99/06431; WO 99/06433; WO 99/06434; WO 99/06435; WO 99/06436; WO 99/06437; WO 98/54207; WO 99/10312; WO 99/10313; WO 98/53814; WO 98/53817; WO 98/58902).
      <br/>
      However, no potent and orally available small molecule inhibitors have been disclosed.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      A related integrin,  ALPHA 4 BETA 7, is expressed on the surface of lymphocytes and binds VCAM-1, fibronectin and mucosal addressin cell adhesion molecule 1 (MAdCAM-1).
      <br/>
      Integrin  ALPHA 4 BETA 7 and MAdCAM mediate recirculation of a subset of lymphocytes between the blood, gut, and lymphoid tissue.
      <br/>
      Similar to VCAM-1 and Fibronectin CS-1 there is a tripeptide sequence, LDT, present on the CD loop of MAdCAM-1 which is important for recognition by  ALPHA 4 BETA 7.
      <br/>
      An X-ray crystal structure shows this sequence is also part of a turn structure (Tan et al. Structure 6: 793-801, 1998).
      <br/>
      Recent studies have shown that  ALPHA 4 BETA 7 may also play a part in diseases such as asthma (Lobb et al. Ann N Y Acad Sci 796: 113-23, 1996), inflammatory bowel disease (Fong et al. Immunol Res 16: 299-311, 1997), and diabetes (Yang et al. Diabetes 46: 1542-7, 1997).
      <br/>
      In addition, while  ALPHA 4 integrins appear to be down-regulated in carcinomas such as cervical and prostate, they appear to be up-regulated in metastatic melanoma (Sanders et al.
      <br/>
      Cancer Invest 16: 329-44, 1998), suggesting that inhibitors of  ALPHA 4 BETA 1 and  ALPHA 4 BETA 7 may be useful as anticancer agents.

    <p num="8">
      Reverse-turns comprise one of three classes of protein secondary structure and display three (gamma-turn), four (beta-turns), or more (loops) amino acid side chains in a fixed spatial relationship to each other.
      <br/>
      Turns have proven important in molecular recognition events (Rose et al. Advances in Protein Chemistry 37: 1-109, 1985) and have engendered a burgeoning field of research into small molecule mimetics of them (e.g. Hanessian et al.
      <br/>
      Tetrahedron 53: 12789-12854, 1997).
      <br/>
      Many mimetics have either been external turn-mimetics which do not allow for the display of all the physiologically relevant side-chains (e.g. Freidinger et al.
      <br/>
      Science 210: 656-8, 1980) or small, conformationally mobile cyclic peptide derivatives (e.g. Viles et al.
      <br/>
      Eur J Biochem 242: 352-62, 1996).
      <br/>
      However, non-peptide compounds have been developed which closely mimic the secondary structure of reverse-turns found in biologically active proteins or peptides.
      <br/>
      For example, U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,475,085, 5,670,155 and 5,672,681, to Kahn and published PCT WO94/03494 to Kahn all disclose conformationally constrained, non-peptidic compounds which mimic the three-dimensional structure of reverse-turns.
      <br/>
      More recently, published PCT WO97/15577 to Kahn and PCT WO98/49168 to Kahn et al. have disclosed additional, highly constrained bicyclic heterocycles as reverse-turn mimetics.
      <br/>
      Nevertheless, as no one template can mimic every type of turn, there remains a need in the art for additional reverse-turn templates and methods for their use.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      While significant advances have been made in the synthesis and identification of confoimationally constrained, reverse-turn mimetics, there is still a need in the art for s:nall molecules that mimic the secondary structure of peptides.
      <br/>
      In addition, there is a need in the art for techniques for synthesizing libraries of such mimetics and screening the library members against biological targets to identify bioactive library members.
      <br/>
      Further, there is a need in the art for small, orally available inhibitors of integrins, for use in treating inflammatory diseases and cardiovascular diseases, as well as some cancers.
      <br/>
      In particular there is a need for inhibitors of  ALPHA 4 BETA 1 and  ALPHA 4 BETA 7, for use in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, asthma, diabetes and inflammatory bowel disease.
      <br/>
      The present invention fulfills these needs, and provides further related advantages.

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="28">
      The present invention is directed to reverse-turn mimetics and chemical libraries containing reverse-turn mimetics.
      <br/>
      The reverse-turn mimetics of the present invention are useful as bioactive agents, including (but not limited to) use as diagnostic, prophylactic and/or therapeutic agents.
      <br/>
      The reverse-turn mimetic libraries of this invention are useful in the identification of such bioactive agents.
      <br/>
      In the practice of the present invention, the libraries may contain from tens to hundreds to thousands (or greater) of individual reverse-turn mimetics (also referred to herein as "members").
    </p>
    <p num="29">In one aspect of the present invention, a reverse-turn mimetic is disclosed having the following structure (I):  (Chemical Structure image '8' not included in text)</p>
    <p num="30">wherein Y is selected from --CH(R5)--A--N(R1)--, --A--N(R1)--CH(R')--, --A--N(R1)--C(.dbd.O)--, --A--C(.dbd.O)--N(R1)--, --A--CH(R1)--O-- and --A--CH(R1)--N(R')--; A is --(CHR')n --; B is --(CHR")m --; n=0, 1 or 2; m=1, 2 or 3; and any two adjacent CH groups or adjacent NH and CH groups on the bicyclic ring may optionally form a double bond; and wherein R', R", R1, R2, R3, R4 and R5 are as defined below.</p>
    <p num="31">
      In structures (I') through (I""") above a solid line designation for attachment of the various R groups to a carbon atom on the fused bicyclic ring indicates that these R groups may lie either above or below the plane of the page.
      <br/>
      If a reverse-turn mimetic of this invention is intended to mimic a reverse-turn of naturally occurring amino acids (i.e., "L-amino acids"), the R groups would generally lie below the plane of the page (i.e., "+character pullout}R") in Structure (I).
      <br/>
      However, if the reverse-turn mimetic of this invention is intended to mimic a reverse-turn containing one or more D-amino acids, then the corresponding R group or groups would lie above the plane of the page (i.e., "+character pullout}R") in Structure (I).
    </p>
    <p num="32">
      In one embodiment, R1 and R4 are the same or different and represent the remainder of the compound, and R', R", R2, R3, and R5 are the same or different and independently selected from an amino acid side chain moiety or derivative thereof.
      <br/>
      With regard to R' and R", it should be understood that each occurrence of R' and R" is independently selected from amino acid side chain moieties or derivatives thereof.
      <br/>
      For example, when m=2, B is a --CHR"CHR"-- moiety.
      <br/>
      In this instance, both occurrences of R" are independently selected, and may be the same or different.
      <br/>
      Thus, if the first occurrence of R" is hydrogen and the second methyl, B would have the structure --CH2 CH(CH3)--.
    </p>
    <p num="33">
      As used herein, the term "remainder of the compound" means any moiety, agent, compound, support, molecule, linker, amino acid, peptide or protein covalently attached to the reverse-turn mimetic at either the R1 and/or R4 positions.
      <br/>
      This term also includes amino acid side chain moieties and derivatives thereof.
    </p>
    <p num="34">
      As used herein, the term "amino acid side chain moiety" represents any amino acid side chain moiety present in naturally occurring proteins including (but not limited to) the naturally occurring amino acid side chain moieties identified in Table 1.
      <br/>
      Other naturally occurring amino acid side chain moieties of this invention include (but are not limited to) the side chain moieties of 3,5-dibromotyrosine, 3,5-diiodotyrosine, hydroxylysine,  GAMMA -carboxyglutamate, phosphotyrosine and phosphoserine.
      <br/>
      In addition, glycosylated amino acid side chains may also be used in the practice of this invention, including (but not limited to) glycosylated threonine, serine and asparagine.

    <p num="92">
      In another aspect of this invention, libraries containing reverse-turn mimetics of the present invention are disclosed.
      <br/>
      Once assembled, the libraries of the present invention may be screened to identify individual members having bioactivity.
      <br/>
      Such screening of the libraries for bioactive members may involve, for example, evaluating the binding activity of the members of the library or evaluating the effect the library members have on a functional assay.
      <br/>
      Screening is normally accomplished by contacting the library members (or a subset of library members) with a target of interest, such as, for example, an antibody, enzyme, receptor or cell line.
      <br/>
      Library members which are capable of interacting with the target of interest are referred to herein as "bioactive library members" or "bioactive mimetics".
      <br/>
      For example, a bioactive mimetic may be a library member which is capable of binding to an antibody or receptor, which is capable of inhibiting an enzyme, or which is capable of eliciting or antagonizing a functional response associated, for example, with a cell line.
      <br/>
      In other words, the screening of the libraries of the present invention determines which library members are capable of interacting with one or more biological targets of interest.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, when interaction does occur, the bioactive mimetic (or mimetics) may then be identified from the library members.
      <br/>
      The identification of a single (or limited number) of bioactive mimetic(s) from the library yields reverse-turn mimetics which are themselves biologically active, and thus useful as diagnostic, prophylactic or therapeutic agents, and may further be used to significantly advance identification of lead compounds in these fields.
    </p>
    <p num="93">
      Synthesis of the peptide mimetics of the library of the present invention may be accomplished using known peptide synthesis techniques, in combination with the first, second and third component pieces of this invention.) More specifically, any amino acid sequence may be added as any of the R1, R2, R3, R4 or R5 moieties of the conformationally constrained reverse-turn mimetic.
      <br/>
      Preferably the amino acid sequence may be added as the R1 or R4 moieties.
      <br/>
      To this end, the mimetics may be synthesized on a solid support (such as polystyrene utilizing 4-hydroxymethylphenoxybutyrate as a linker) by known techniques (see, e.g., John M. Stewart and Janis D. Young, Solid Phase Peptide Synthesis, 1984, Pierce Chemical Comp., Rockford, Ill.; Atherton, E., Shepard, R. C. Solid Phase Pepetide Synthesis: A Practical Approach; IRL: Oxford, 1989) or on a silyl-linked resin by alcohol attachment (see Randolph et al., J. Am Chem. Soc. 117:5712-14, 1995).
    </p>
    <p num="94">
      In addition, a combination of both solution and solid phase synthesis techniques may be utilized to synthesize the peptide mimetics of this invention.
      <br/>
      For example, a solid support may be utilized to synthesize the linear peptide sequence up to the point that the conformationally constrained reverse-turn is added to the sequence.
      <br/>
      A suitable conformationally constrained reverse-turn mimetic which has been previously synthesized by solution synthesis techniques may then be added as the next "amino acid" to the solid phase synthesis (i.e., the conformationally constrained reverse-turn mimetic, which has at least two reactive sites, may be utilized as the next residue to be added to the linear peptide).
      <br/>
      Upon incorporation of the conformationally constrained reverse-turn mimetic into the sequence, additional amino acids may then be added to complete the peptide bound to the solid support.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, the linear N-terminus and C-terminus protected peptide sequences may be synthesized on a solid support, removed from the support, and then coupled to the conformationally constrained reverse-turn mimetic in solution using known solution coupling techniques.
    </p>
    <p num="95">
      In another aspect of this invention, methods for constructing the libraries are disclosed.
      <br/>
      Traditional combinatorial chemistry and parallel synthesis techniques (see, e.g., The Combinatorial Index Bunin, Academic Press, New York, 1998; Gallop et al., J. Med. Chem. 37:1233-1251, 1994) permit a vast number of compounds to be rapidly prepared by the sequential combination of reagents to a basic molecular scaffold.
      <br/>
      For example, the above disclosed synthesis may be carried out using the directed sorting technique of Nicolaou and coworkers (Nicolaou, Xiao et al.
      <br/>
      Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 34: 2289-2291, 1995).
      <br/>
      Presently, equipment for this technique is commercially available from IRORI (La Jolla, Calif.).
      <br/>
      Alternatively, the above disclosed synthesis may be carried out by parallel synthesis using a 48- or 98-well plate format wherein each well contains a fritted outlet for draining solvents and reagents (A Practical Guide to Combinational Chemistry Czarnik and DeWitt, Eds., American Chemical Society, Washington, D.C., 1997).
      <br/>
      Robbins (Sunnyvale, Calif.), Charybdis (Carlsbad, Calif.) and Bohdan (Chicago, Ill.) presently offer suitable equipment for this technique.
    </p>
    <p num="96">
      In a further aspect of this invention, methods for screening the libraries for bioactivity and isolating bioactive library members are disclosed.
      <br/>
      The libraries of the present invention may be screened for bioactivity by a variety of techniques and methods.
      <br/>
      Generally, the screening assay may be performed by (1) contacting a library with a biological target of interest, such as a receptor, and allowing binding to occur between the mimetics of the library and the target, and (2) detecting the binding event by an appropriate assay, such as by the colorimetric assay disclosed by Lam et al. (Nature 354:82-84, 1991) or Griminski et al. (Biotechnology 12:1008-1011, 1994).
      <br/>
      In a preferred embodiment, the library members are in solution and the target is immobilized on a solid phase.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, the library may be immobilized on a solid phase and may be probed by contacting it with the target in solution.
    </p>
    <p num="97">
      As mentioned above, the reverse-turn mimetics of the present invention are useful as bioactive agents, such as diagnostic, prophylactic, and therapeutic agents.
      <br/>
      The opiate receptor binding activity of representative reverse-turn mimetics is presented in Example 9.
      <br/>
      In this example, the reverse-turn mimetics of this invention were found to effectively inhibit the binding of a radiolabeled enkephalin derivative to the  DELTA  and  MU  opiate receptors.
      <br/>
      The data demonstrates the utility of these reverse-turn mimetics as receptor antagonists and as potential analgesic agents.
      <br/>
      In a further embodiment, the integrin binding activity of representative reverse-turn mimetics is presented in Example 11.
      <br/>
      In this example, the reverse-turn mimetics were found to effectively displace CS1 peptide from Ramos cells.
      <br/>
      The data thus indicate the ability of reverse turn mimetics to antagonize  ALPHA 4 BETA 1 integrins and serve as potential anti-inflammatory agents.

      In the procedure, 5 mg (12.7  MU mol) Ia was dissolved in 3 ml of 80/20 methanol:water and cooled to 0 (degree)  C. To this solution was added 2.70 mg (12.7  MU mol, 1.0 eq) 2.4 dinitrobenzoic acid, and the resulting solution stirred until it became homogenous.
      <br/>
      Volatiles were removed under reduced pressure and the residue was dried in vacuo for 24 hrs.
      <br/>
      The residue was taken up in warm water and filtered to remove insoluble impurities.
      <br/>
      The solution was then lyophilized to give the salt, 5.

    <p num="182">Synthesis of a Representative Reverse-Turn Mimetics</p>
    <p num="183">
      This example further illustrates the syntheses of reverse-turn mimetics of this invention.
      <br/>
      Specifically, the preparation of �4.4.0� bicyclic reverse-turn mimetics was carried out in solution phase (Method A) and on solid phase (Methods B and C).
      <br/>
      Structures of representative mimetics are given in Table 2.
      <br/>
      The solid phase syntheses of these reverse-turn mimetics demonstrate that libraries containing such members may be readily prepared.
    </p>
    <p num="184">
      Method A solution phase synthesis is analogous to the solid phase synthesis of Method B and was carried out essentially as illustrated in FIG. 2.
      <br/>
      The compounds were purified as in Method C, below.
    </p>
    <p num="185">
      The solid phase synthesis of Method B is illustrated in FIG. 8.
      <br/>
      Referring to that figure, commercially available aminomethyl resin was reacted with excess 4-bromo-2-butenoic acid and DIC (diisopropylcarbdiimide) in DMF to give 4-bromo-2-butenamide resin.
      <br/>
      Substitution of the bromo group with a primary amine in DMSO gave the corresponding 4-alkylamino-2-butenamide resin.
      <br/>
      Standard peptide coupling procedures on solid phase were performed to give N-alkyloxycarbonyl- ALPHA -alkyl- BETA -alanyl- ALPHA -alkylglycyl-N'-alkylamino-2-butenamide resin.
      <br/>
      The reverse-turn mimetics were obtained by osmium tetroxide catalyzed periodate oxidation of the resin followed by the treatment of the resulting monocyclic product with a catalytic amount of TFA in dichloromethane.
      <br/>
      The crude products gave a single major peak by reverse-phase HPLC analysis.
    </p>
    <p num="186">
      The solid phase sythesis of Method C is similar to Method B and is given in Example 11 and illustrated in FIG. 9.
      <br/>
      Selected compounds were purified by flash chromatography or preparative TLC on silica gel using suitable combinations of EtOAc and MeOH.
    </p>
    <p num="187">
      The mimetics were characterized as follows: Analytical C18 reverse-phase HPLC was carried out using standard techniques (mobile phase: gradients of 0.1% in water and acetonitrile.
      <br/>
      By these methods, crude products synthesized on solid phase generally displayed purities of greater than 80%, and all purified compounds greater than 95%.
      <br/>
      Electrospray mass spectrometry was carried out using standard techniques.
      <br/>
      The observed value of the (M+H+) ion is given for each compound in Table 2. 1 H NMR was carried out on purified mimetics and spectra were assigned by a combination of COSY and ROESY experiments.
      <br/>
      All spectra were consistent with the structures indicated below, and displayed a conformation similar to a type I or type II BETA -turn.

    <p num="213">
      This example further illustrates the synthesis of reverse-turn mimetics of this invention.
      <br/>
      Specifically, the preparation of �4.4.0� bicyclic reverse-turn mimetics was carried out on solid phase by a method alternative to that of Example 8, method B. The method is outlined in FIG. 9.

    <p num="214">Synthesis of 2-Bromo-1-ethoxy-ethyl-1-oxy-linked Resin (27)  (Chemical Structure image '57' not included in text)</p>
    <p num="215">
      In general, a batch of resin (ArgogelOH or hydroxymethyl polystyrene) was refluxed in 1,2-dichloroethane (DCE) for 4 hours in the presence of 8 equivalents of bromoalkylaldehyde diethyl acetal and 2 equivalents of pyridinium p-toluenesulfonate (PPTS).
      <br/>
      In one instance, hydroxymethyl polystyrene (10.0 g, 0.7 mmol OH/g, 7 mmol) and 3.5 g of PPTS (14 mmol) were suspended in 200 ml of DCE.
      <br/>
      Then, a solution of 8.5 ml of 2-bromodicthoxyethane (ca. 56 mmol) in DCE (100 ml) was added with stirring and the reaction mixture was heated at reflux (approx. 80 (degree)  C.).
      <br/>
      After 4 hours the resin was filtered off and washed with 100 mL dimethylformamide (DMF), 50 mL dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), 100 mL DMF, 200 mL dichloromethane (DCM), 50 mL 1,4-dioxane and finally with 100 mL methanol.
      <br/>
      After drying, 11.73 g, of resin 27 was obtained.
      <br/>
      Bromine analysis indicated quantitative loading.
    </p>
    <p num="216">Synthesis of Representative Compounds of Structure (Ia')</p>
    <p num="217">
      Reactions were carried out in plastic disposable syringes of the appropriate size, each fitted with a polypropylene fist to retain the resin.
      <br/>
      After each step, resin batches were washed with DMF (3 * ) and DCM (3 * ).
      <br/>
      Typically, a 0.03 mmol sample of resin 27 e.g., 50 mg of polystyrene resin with loading of 0.6 mmol Br/g), pre-swollen in DMF, was treated with 1 mL of a 2.0 M solution of amine R4 --NH2 (2 mmol) in DMSO at 60 (degree)  C. for 16-24 hrs.
    </p>
    <p num="218">
      Next, the resin was reacted with 0.09 mmol of Fmoc amino acid (FmocNH--CHR3 --COOH) in the presence of HATU (34 mg, 0.09 mmol) and DIEA (0.032 ml, 0.18 mmol) in DMF (1 mL) until the chloranil test was negative (typically 1-2 h).
      <br/>
      Subsequently, the Fmoc protection was removed by treatment with a 25% (v/v) piperidine/DMF solution (2 mL) over 20 min.
    </p>
    <p num="219">
      The resin was then reacted with 0.09 mmol of an Fmoc beta-amino acid (FmocNH--CHR5 --CHR2 --COOH) in the presence of DIC (0.014 ml, 0.09 mmol) and HOBt (14 mg, 0.09 mmol) in DMF (1 mL) until the Kaiser test was negative (typically 1 hour).
      <br/>
      The resin was again treated with 25% (v/v) piperidine/DMF solution (2 mL) over 20 min.
    </p>
    <p num="220">
      Finally, the resin-bound sequence was terminated by reaction with sulfonyl chloride (R1 SO2 Cl, 0.3 mmol) in the presence of DIEA (0.106 mL, 0.6 mmol) in DCM (1 mL) for 1 hr (Kaiser test negative).
      <br/>
      Alternatively, chloroformate R1 OCOCl or isocyanate R1 NCO (the latter does not require presence of DIEA) was used instead of sulfonyl chloride for introduction of the R1 moiety.
    </p>
    <p num="221">
      The washed and dried resin was re-swollen in DCM, drained and treated with 1 mL of formic acid (96%) overnight at rt.
      <br/>
      In a number of cases, an elevated temperature up to 60 (degree)  C. or an extended reaction time was necessary to complete the cyclization (for conditions see Table 2 below).
      <br/>
      The supernatant was collected and combined with washes (2 * 0.5 mL of formic acid).
      <br/>
      The residue obtained after evaporation of formic acid was redissolved in acetonitrile/water 50:50 mixture, frozen and lyophilized.

      An assay measuring the ability of the compounds of Example 1 to antagonize binding of CS1 peptide to  ALPHA 4 BETA 1 integrin was performed.
      <br/>
      A modification of the procedure of Vanderslice, P. et al. (J. Immunol., 1997, 1710-1718) (incorporated herein by reference) was utilized.
    </p>
    <p num="228">
      In brief, 100  MU L/well of a solution of biotinylated CS1 peptide (1 mg/100 mL of phosphate buffered saline (PBS)) was incubated in a NeutrAvidin plate (Pierce) for 1 h at room temperature.
      <br/>
      The plate was then washed 3 *  with distilled water and treated with 200  MU L of blocking buffer (3% BSA in PBS) for at least 4 h. Blocked plates were washed as above.
      <br/>
      Harvested Ramos cells (107 /mL) were resuspended in PBS containing 10  MU L of calcein AM/mL and incubated 30 min in the dark.
      <br/>
      This suspension was diluted with 45 mL PBS and the cells harvested by centrifugation and aspiration.
      <br/>
      The cells were resuspended in binding buffer (.about.5 * 105 /mL).
      <br/>
      If cell lysis was to be monitored ethidium homodimer was added to the buffer to a final concentration of 5  MU M. A solution (10  MU L) of compound to be tested or control peptide was added to appropriate wells followed by 90  MU L of the cell suspension.
      <br/>
      The plate was incubated at 37 (degree)  C. for 1 h. When ethidium homodimer was added, fluorescence at 535/617 was measured before rinsing.
      <br/>
      Otherwise, the plate was washed 3 * , 50  MU L of lysis buffer was added to each well, the plate rocked in the dark for 10 min, and the fluorescence monitored at 485 nm excitation and 535 nm emission.
