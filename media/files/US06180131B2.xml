    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">This invention relates to a process involving the use of a pet food composition containing fermentable fibers to improve glucose metabolism, satiety, and nutrient absorption in companion animals such as, for example, dogs and cats.</p>
    <p num="3">
      Recent research has suggested that dietary fiber is important for its fermentation properties in the large intestine of dogs and cats.
      <br/>
      For example, Reinhart, U.S. Pat. No. 5,616,569, describes the addition of fermentable dietary fiber to a pet food composition for the purpose of maintaining normal gastrointestinal function and ameliorating chronic diarrhea in animals.
      <br/>
      Howard et al, FASEB J. (1996) 10:A257, teach that fermentable fiber consumption by dogs can result in the partition of waste nitrogen from the urine to the feces, increasing nitrogen excretion through the feces of the animal.
      <br/>
      Sunvold et al, J. Anim. Sci. (1995) 73:1099-1109, found that feeding moderately fermentable fibers to dogs could promote gastrointestinal tract health by optimizing short chain fatty acid (SCFA) production in the intestines of the animals.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      Certain animals, such as dogs, as well as humans, sometimes suffer from diabetes or have an impaired ability to regulate blood sugar levels.
      <br/>
      There are many causes of diabetes.
      <br/>
      Where diabetes or impaired blood glucose regulation has been diagnosed, medication and diet for the animal should be closely controlled.
      <br/>
      Currently, diets having high concentrations of nonfermentable fibers are used to treat diabetes.
      <br/>
      However, these nonfermentable fiber-containing diets often impair nutrient absorption by the animal, resulting in undesirable effects on the animal's health and well being.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      Certain animals also may have a tendency towards excess caloric intake which increases the risk of the animal developing diabetes or other chronic diseases.
      <br/>
      It would be desirable to be able to manage caloric intake through dietary means so that the animal would become sated after meals, but without excessive caloric intake.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      Other animals may have difficulty in digesting and absorbing nutrients from their diets.
      <br/>
      For example, animals which exhibit exocrine pancreatic insufficiency (EPI), a condition in which there is an insufficient secretion of enzymes by the pancreas, struggle to digest nutrients normally, especially fats, in their diets.
      <br/>
      It would be desirable to be able to improve such animals' nutrient absorption capabilities.
      <br/>
      Thus, there remains a need for additional dietary measures which will improve glucose metabolism, satiety, and nutrient absorption in companion animals without the adverse effects of diets containing nonfermentable fibers.
    </p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="7">
      The present invention meets that need by providing a process for feeding an animal a diet which alters the function and morphology of the gastrointestinal tract (GIT), a large lymphoid organ, in ways which are beneficial to the animal's health and well being.
      <br/>
      The process involves feeding a companion animal such as, for example, a dog or cat a diet of a pet food composition containing fermentable fibers which have an organic matter disappearance (OMD) of 15 to 60 percent when fermented by fecal bacteria for a 24 hour period, the fibers being present in amounts from about 1 to 11 weight percent of supplemental total dietary fiber.
      <br/>
      The animal is maintained on the diet for a sufficient period of time to allow the fermentable fibers to ferment in the GIT of the animal.
      <br/>
      This fermentation results in an upregulation in the secretion of GLP-1 which improves glucose homeostasis and promotes satiety in the animal.
      <br/>
      The diet also enhances the absorption of nutrients by the animal by increasing the transport of D-glucose and lauric acid which are indicators of carbohydrate and fat absorption, respectively.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      Preferably, the pet food composition contains from 2 to 10 weight percent of supplemental total dietary fiber of fermentable fibers.
      <br/>
      More preferably, the pet food composition contains from 3 to 9 weight percent of supplemental total dietary fiber of fermentable fibers.
      <br/>
      Most preferably, the pet food composition contains from 4 to 7 weight percent of supplemental total dietary fiber of fermentable fibers.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      Preferably, the fermentable fibers have an organic matter disappearance of 20 to 50 percent.
      <br/>
      More preferably, the fermentable fibers have an organic matter disappearance of 30 to 40 percent.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      In addition, the fermentable fibers are preferably selected from the group consisting of beet pulp, gum arabic, gum talha (a form of gum arabic), psyllium, rice bran, carob bean gum, citrus pulp, pectin, fructooligosaccharides or inulin, mannanoligosaccharides and mixtures thereof.
      <br/>
      More preferably, the fermentable fibers are selected from the group consisting of beet pulp, gum arabic and fructooligosaccharides.
      <br/>
      Most preferably, the fermentable fibers are a blend of beet pulp, gum talha, and fructooligosaccharides.
      <br/>
      A preferred weight ratio of beet pulp to fructooligosaccharides in the fermentable fiber blend is from about 3:1 to 6:1, and most preferably 4:1.
      <br/>
      A preferred weight ratio of beet pulp to gum talha to fructooligosaccharide is 6:2:1.5.
    </p>
    <p num="11">
      Accordingly, it is a feature of the present invention to provide a pet food composition and process for altering the function and morphology of the gastrointestinal tract to improve glucose metabolism and enhance glucose homeostasis, improve satiety, and enhance nutrient absorption in an animal.
      <br/>
      This, and other features and advantages of the present invention, will become apparent from the following detailed description, the accompanying drawings, and the appended claims.

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
    <p num="13">
      The present invention uses a pet food composition containing fermentable fibers to alter the function and morphology of the gastrointestinal tract of the animal.
      <br/>
      This provides a number of benefits to the animal.
      <br/>
      First, glucose metabolism is improved and glucose homeostasis is enhanced in the animal.
      <br/>
      While not wishing to be bound by any particular theory, it is believed that the improvement in glucose regulation in the animals results at least in part from the increased levels of insulinotropic gut hormones such as GLP-1 which are secreted in the gastrointestinal tract.
      <br/>
      GLP-1 is a potent insulinotropic hormone and potential antidiabetogenic agent.
      <br/>
      This upregulation of GLP-1 is believed to increase intestinal glucose transport capacity and improve glucose homeostasis in the animal.
      <br/>
      Increased levels of GLP-1 in the GIT of the animal also improve satiety in the animal and reduce the animal's tendency to overeat.
      <br/>
      These results are surprising in view of the prior art practice of using very high fiber concentration in animal diets, but using low fermentablility fibers such as cellulose to attempt to accomplish this result.
    </p>
    <p num="14">
      Further, the presence of fermentable fibers in the diet increases the transport of D-glucose and lauric acid in the jejunum (mid portion) of the small intestine. D-glucose and lauric acid are indicators of carbohydrate and fat absorption, respectively, in an animal.
      <br/>
      Thus, healthy animals will benefit from the process of the present invention which improves nutrient absorption.
      <br/>
      However, animals which are suffering from certain disease states such as exocrine pancreatic insufficiency (EPI) will benefit even more.
      <br/>
      EPI results from insufficient secretion of enzymes by the pancreas, with such enzymes being needed by the animal for normal nutrient digestion.
      <br/>
      Animals with EPI struggle to digest dietary nutrients, especially fats.
      <br/>
      Animals with EPI which are fed the pet food composition of this invention will benefit by an improved ability to absorb dietary nutrients.
    </p>
    <p num="15">
      The present invention uses a pet food composition containing fermentable fibers which display certain organic matter disappearance percentages.
      <br/>
      The fermentable fibers used in the present invention have an organic matter disappearance (OMD) of from about 15 to 60 percent when fermented by fecal bacteria in vitro for a 24 hour period.
      <br/>
      That is, from about 15 to 60 percent of the total organic matter originally present is fermented and converted by the fecal bacteria.
      <br/>
      The organic matter disappearance of the fibers is preferably 20 to 50 percent, and most preferably is 30 to 40 percent.
    </p>
    <p num="16">
      Thus, in vitro OMD percentage may be calculated as follows:
      <br/>
      +1-�(OM residue-OM blank)/OM initial�} * 100,
    </p>
    <p num="17">
      where OM residue is the organic matter recovered after 24 hours of fermentation, OM blank is the organic matter recovered in corresponding blank tubes (i.e., tubes containing medium and diluted feces, but no substrate), and OM initial is that organic matter placed into the tube prior to fermentation.
      <br/>
      Additional details of the procedure are found in Sunvold et al, J. Anim. Sci. 1995, vol. 73:1099-1109.
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      The pet food composition can be any suitable pet food formula which also provides adequate nutrition for the animal.
      <br/>
      For example, a typical canine diet for use in the present invention may contain about 30% crude protein, about 20% fat, and about 10% total dietary fiber.
      <br/>
      However, no specific ratios or percentages of these or other nutrients are required.
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      Fermentable fibers which are useful in the present invention produce short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) within a range of from about 28 to about 85 mmol SCFA per 1000 Calories (kcals) of metabolizable energy (ME), and more preferably within a range of from about 42 to about 71 mmol SCFA per 1000 ME kcals.
      <br/>
      This equates to a composition which has a total fermentable fiber content which yields from about 100 to about 350 mmol SCFA/kg of diet.
    </p>
    <p num="20">
      Millimoles of SCFAs per 1000 metabolizable energy kilocalories are calculated by first calculating the total Calories of metabolizable energy (ME) in a given diet composition per kilogram of the composition.
      <br/>
      The number of grams per 1000 kcal ME may be derived from the first calculation.
      <br/>
      Then the grams, and thus millimoles, of the fermentable fiber components of the composition may be calculated.
    </p>
    <p num="21">
      The fermentable fiber of the present invention may be any fiber source which intestinal bacteria present in the animal can ferment to produce significant quantities of SCFAs. "Significant quantities" of SCFAs, for purposes of this invention, are amounts over 0.5 mmol of total SCFAs/gram of substrate in a 24 hour period.
      <br/>
      Preferred fibers include beet pulp, gum arabic (including gum talha), psyllium, rice bran, carob bean gum, citrus pulp, pectin, fructooligosaccharides or inulin, mannanoligosaccharides and mixtures of these fibers.
      <br/>
      More preferably, the fermentable fibers are selected from the group consisting of beet pulp, gum arabic and fructooligosaccharides.
      <br/>
      Most preferably, the fermentable fibers are a blend of beet pulp, gum talha, and fructooligosaccharides.
      <br/>
      A preferred weight ratio of beet pulp to fructooligosaccharides in the fermentable fiber blend is from about 3:1 to 6:1, and most preferably 4:1.
      <br/>
      A preferred weight ratio of beet pulp to gum talha to fructooligosaccharide is 6:2:1.5.
    </p>
    <p num="22">The fermentable fibers are used in the pet food composition in amounts from 1 to 11 weight percent of supplemental total dietary fiber, preferably from 2 to 10 weight percent, and most preferably from 3 to 7 weight percent.</p>
    <p num="23">
      A definition of "supplemental total dietary fiber" first requires an explanation of "total dietary fiber". "Total dietary fiber" is defined as the residue of plant food which is resistant to hydrolysis by animal digestive enzymes.
      <br/>
      The main components of total dietary fiber are cellulose, hemicellulose, pectin, lignin and gums (as opposed to "crude fiber", which only contains some forms of cellulose and lignin). "Supplemental total dietary fiber" is that dietary fiber which is added to a food product above and beyond any dietary fiber naturally present in other components of the food product.
      <br/>
      Also, a "fiber source" is considered such when it consists predominantly of fiber.
    </p>
    <p num="24">In order that the invention may be more readily understood, reference is made to the following examples which are intended to illustrate the invention, but not limit the scope thereof.</p>
    <p num="25">EXAMPLE 1</p>
    <p num="26">
      Diets, see Table 1, were formulated to be isonitrogenous and isoenergetic and to provide approximately 19.5 MJ/kg diet with 35% of the energy from carbohydrate, 30% from fat and 35% from protein.
      <br/>
      The low fermentable fiber (LFF) diet contained wood cellulose as the fiber source and the high fermentable fiber diet (HFF) diet contained a blend of more fermentable plant fibers (beet pulp, Michigan Sugar, Saginaw, Mich.; gum arabic, TIC Gums, Belcamp, Md.; fructooligosaccharides (FOS), Golden Technologies Corporation, Golden, Colo.).
      <br/>
      The ratio of beet pulp to gum arabic to FOS was about 6:2:1.5. The ratio of beet pulp to FOS was about 4:1.

      Adult mongrel dogs (n=16) were utilized.
      <br/>
      Upon arrival, animals were acclimatized for 7 days and fed a nutritionally complete diet (Can-Pro, Beaumont, Ala.).
      <br/>
      All dogs were weighed daily and individually fed to meet energy requirements using the formula: Energy intake (MJ)=0.553 * kg (body weight)0.67. Food was offered once daily between 0900-1000 hours and water was available ad libitum.
      <br/>
      A crossover experimental design was used whereby dogs were randomly assigned to receive the HFF or LFF diet for 14 days, followed by the alternate diet for an additional 14 days.
      <br/>
      Because the 16 dogs could not be accommodated at one time, the dogs were paired throughout the experiment.

      Immediately after surgery the small intestine was removed and the associated mesenteries were severed so the intestine could be straightened on a horizontal surface and length measured in a resting state.
      <br/>
      Three segments of 25-30 cm in length were removed and immediately placed in cold (2-4 (degree)  C.) Ringers that had been aerated with a mixture of O2 and CO2 (95% and 5%).

      The first segment originated from 30 cm distal to the pylorus and was considered as proximal intestine.

      The second was taken from the mid point of the small intestine and was designated as mid intestine.

      A modification of the everted sleeve method (Karasov et al, J. Comp. Physiol. B 152:105-116 (1983)) was used to measure rates of nutrient uptake.
      <br/>
      Because adult beagles have a large diameter small intestine (&gt;1 cm), it was not practical to use entire sleeves to measure nutrient absorption.
      <br/>
      Instead, pieces of tissue of about 0.5 cm2 were secured by silk ligatures onto the sides and near the ends of 5 mm rods with the mucosa exposed.
      <br/>
      Preliminary validation studies showed that rates of uptake were comparable to those measured using intact sleeves of intestine (values differed&lt;10% between mounting techniques).

      The tissues were kept in cold, aerated Ringers before, during, and after mounting onto the rods.

      Following the protocol of Puchal and Buddington, Am. J. Physiol., 262:G895-902 (1992), the incubation solutions consisted of Ringers with either glucose or proline.
      <br/>
      Accumulation of nutrient by the tissues was quantified by adding labeled L-proline (3 H) or D-glucose (14 C).
      <br/>
      Proline was selected as a representative amino acid since it has a "private" carrier (the imino acid transporter), whereas other amino acid carriers can transport several different classes of amino acids with varying affinities.
      <br/>
      Polyethylene glycol (14 C) was added to proline solutions to correct for proline associated with the adherent fluids and not actually absorbed.
      <br/>
      For glucose solutions, the passively absorbed isomer L-glucose (3 H) was added, allowing for simultaneous correction of D-glucose present in adherent fluids and passively absorbed independent of carriers.
      <br/>
      After the tissues were exposed to the nutrient solutions, they were removed from the rods (tissues exposed to glucose were first rinsed for 20 seconds in cold Ringers), and placed in tared vials.
      <br/>
      After wet weights were recorded, the tissues were solubilized, scintillant added, and associated radioactivity was measured by liquid scintillation counting.
      <br/>
      Rates of glucose and proline uptake were calculated and expressed as functions of tissue weights.
    </p>
    <p num="60">
      The regional distribution of uptake was determined by incubating tissues from each segment in solutions containing 50 mmol/L solutions of glucose or proline.
      <br/>
      Preliminary studies showed that this concentration is sufficiently high that it saturates the carriers and yields maximal rates of absorption.
      <br/>
      The maximum capacity of the entire length of small intestine to absorb glucose and proline was estimated by summing the products of regional rates of uptake times regional wet weights.
    </p>
    <p num="61">
      Kinetics of uptake were defined in the proximal intestine for glucose and the mid intestine for proline.

      <br/>
      Resulting uptake values were examined by non-linear regression analysis to calculate maximal rates of uptake (Vmax) and apparent affinity constants (Km).

      For analysis of proline data, a passive permeation coefficient was included to account for proline absorbed passively and independent of carriers.

      However, dogs fed the diet with the blend of beet pulp and FOS as sources of fermentable fiber (Diet B) had intestines that were 22% longer than those fed the diet with non fermentable fiber (Diet A) (p=0.09; see Table 4).
      <br/>
      Circumference declined from proximal to distal (p&lt;0.05).

      Wet weight per cm declined from proximal to distal in both groups, with significant differences between all regions (p&lt;0.05).
      <br/>
      Intestines of dogs fed fermentable fiber had a higher average wet weight per cm (1.17 vs 1.04; p&lt;0.05), due mainly to the greater mass of the proximal intestine (p&lt;0.05).
      <br/>
      The wet weight per cm for mid and distal regions did not differ significantly between treatments.
      <br/>
      The higher total intestinal wet weight of dogs fed fermentable fiber is therefore due to a combination of having longer intestines with more weight per cm in the proximal intestine.
      <br/>
      Dry weight per cm also declined from proximal to distal (p&lt;0.05), but did not differ between treatments in any region, indicating the heavier proximal intestine per cm of dogs fed fermentable fiber is partly due to higher water content.

      Even so, dogs fed fermentable fiber had more total intestinal dry mass.

      Values tor glucose uptake represent carrier mediated transport.
      <br/>
      Rates of uptake at the saturating concentration of 50 mmol/L were highest in the proximal intestine (FIG. 9, p&lt;0.05 for region effects), but were not significantly higher in dogs fed the diet with fermentable fiber (p&gt;0.20 for treatment effects).
      <br/>
      Values for mid and distal intestine did not differ significantly from each other or between treatments.
    </p>
    <p num="68">Kinetic analysis of uptake by proximal intestine as a function of glucose concentration (FIG. 10) showed saturable uptake for dogs from both treatments.</p>
    <p num="69">
      Although values for uptake at 50 mmol/L did not differ significantly between treatments, the kinetic analysis showed that dogs fed the diet with fermentable fiber had higher maximum rates of uptake (1.21.+- 0 (slashed zero) 11 nmol/mg-min vs 0.60.+- 0 (slashed zero) 13, p&lt;0.05).
      <br/>
      Apparent affinity constants did not differ between treatments (6.2 +- 2.1 vs 3.9 +- 3.3) implying only one transporter type was present.

    <p num="70">
      Values for rates of proline uptake represent the sum of carrier-mediated uptake and passive, carrier-independent absorption.

      Values at 50 mmol/L did not differ between treatments or region (FIG. 9).
    </p>
    <p num="71">
      Proline uptake by dogs fed the diet with cellulose (Diet A) increased monotonically with proline concentration (FIG. 11), did not show any evidence of saturation kinetics typical of carrier-mediated processes, and were best fit by a linear relationship.
      <br/>
      As an additional indicator, ratios for the accumulation of tracer proline were calculated at 0.04 mmol/L relative to 50 mmol/L.
      <br/>
      If carriers are present in limited numbers, the labeled and unlabeled proline would have to compete for carrier sites.
      <br/>
      This would result in ratios would that would exceed 1.0 because of the reciprocal relationship between accumulation of tracer and nutrient concentration.
      <br/>
      Ratios for dogs fed the diet with cellulose averaged 0.96.+- 0 (slashed zero) 11 indicating a lack of competition.
      <br/>
      These findings, in conjunction with those from the kinetic analysis, indicate that passive influx represented nearly 100% of total proline absorption and that there were few transporters present or functioning.
    </p>
    <p num="72">
      In contrast, when dogs were fed the diet with fermentable fiber (Diet B), the relationship between rates of uptake and proline concentration deviated from linearity and was best fit by an equation that included a saturable process and passive influx.
      <br/>
      This was corroborated by tracer accumulation ratios that averaged 1.21.+- 0 (slashed zero) 15.
      <br/>
      This value does not differ significantly from 1.0 and is markedly less than ratios for glucose (9.13 +- 1.36 and 4.58.+- 0 (slashed zero) 80 tor dogs fed diets with and without fermentable fibers, respectively, p&lt;0.05 for comparisons with 1.0 and between treatments).
      <br/>
      However, it is suggestive that more carriers for proline are present in the mid intestine when dogs are fed a diet with fermentable fiber.
      <br/>
      Even so, passive influx at 50 mmol/L proline still contributes over 90% of total influx.
    </p>
    <p num="73">
      The affinity constant for proline uptake by intact tissues from other vertebrates ranges from about 1 to 5 mmol/L.
      <br/>
      If the imino transporter of dogs is similar to those known for other mammals, then all of the carriers should be saturated at the concentration of 25 mmol/L.
      <br/>
      Therefore, any increase in proline absorption between 25 and 50 mmol/L should reflect passive, carrier-independent influx.
      <br/>
      When the slopes of the lines between 25 and 50 mmol/L were compared, no difference between dogs fed diets A (0.074.+- 0 (slashed zero) 022 nmol/mg-min-mmol/L) and B (0.054.+- 0 (slashed zero) 011, p&gt;0.20) could be detected.

    <p num="74">
      When rates of uptake were integrated with regional wet weights, dogs fed the diet with fermentable fiber had higher total intestinal capacities to absorb glucose (271 +- 42  MU mol/min vs 139 +- 37; p&lt;0.05).
      <br/>
      This was mainly caused by higher values in proximal intestine; values for mid and distal intestine did differ between treatments (FIG. 12).
      <br/>
      Treatment effects were not detected for proline uptake capacities in any region (FIG. 12), or for the entire length of small intestine (Diet A=1246 +- 155, Diet B=1031 +- 124; p&gt;0.40).
    </p>
    <p num="75">
      This experiment demonstrates that the intestinal-structure and functions of dogs are altered by the types of fibers present in the diet.
      <br/>
      The results demonstrate longer, heavier intestines with more surface area and mucosa result when dogs are fed a diet with fibers that can be readily fermented by the GIT bacteria.
      <br/>
      The responses were more pronounced in the proximal intestine, as evident from the differences in proximal weight and mucosal mass between dogs fed the two diets.
      <br/>
      The lack of difference in the percent of mucosa in proximal intestine, or any other region of the intestine (p&gt;0.9) indicates there was an increase in all tissue layers.
      <br/>
      However, because of greater mass of the proximal region, dogs fed the diet with fermentable fiber had more mucosa in the proximal region as well as the entire length of small intestine.
      <br/>
      The implication is that dogs fed a diet with fermentable fibers have more intestine to hydrolyze and absorb dietary inputs.
      <br/>
      The results also indicate that including fermentable fibers in canine diets provide benefits to healthy dogs that are in addition to the increases in the beneficial GIT bacteria.
