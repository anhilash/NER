    <heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">This invention relates to a novel group of phenyl urea compounds, processes for the preparation thereof, the use thereof in treating IL-8, GRO ALPHA , GRO BETA , GRO GAMMA  and NAP-2 mediated diseases and pharmaceutical compositions for use in such therapy.</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="3">
      Many different names have been applied to Interleukin-8 (IL-8), such as neutrophil attractant/activation protein-1 (NAP-1), monocyte derived neutrophil chemotactic factor (MDNCF), neutrophil activating factor (NAF), and T-cell lymphocyte chemotactic factor.
      <br/>
      Interleukin-8 is a chemoattractant for neutrophils, basophils, and a subset of T-cells.
      <br/>
      It is produced by a majority of nucleated cells including macrophages, fibroblasts, endothelial and epithelial cells exposed to TNF, IL-1 ALPHA , IL-1 BETA  or LPS, and by neutrophils themselves when exposed to LPS or chemotactic factors such as FMLP. M. Baggiolini et al, J. Clin. Invest. 84, 1045 (1989); J. Schroder et al. J. Immunol. 139, 3474 (1987) and J. Immunol. 144, 2223 (1990); Strieter, et al, Science 243, 1467 (1989) and J. Biol. Chem. 264, 10621 (1989); Cassatella et al, J. Immunol. 148, 3216 (1992).
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      Gro ALPHA , GRO BETA , GRO GAMMA  and NAP-2 also belong to the chemokine  ALPHA  family.
      <br/>
      Like IL-8 these chemokines have also been referred to by different names.
      <br/>
      For instance GRO ALPHA ,  BETA ,  GAMMA  have been referred to as MGSA ALPHA ,  BETA  and  GAMMA  respectively (Melanoma Growth Stimulating Activity), see Richmond et al, J. Cell Physiology 129, 375 (1986) and Chang et al, J. Immunol 148, 451 (1992).
      <br/>
      All of the chemokines of the  ALPHA -family which possess the ELR motif directly preceding the CXC motif bind to the IL-8 B receptor.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      IL-8, Gro ALPHA , GRO BETA , GRO GAMMA  and NAP-2 stimulate a number of functions in vitro.
      <br/>
      They have all been shown to have chemoattractant properties for neutrophils, while IL-8 and GRO ALPHA  have demonstrated T-lymphocytes, and basophiles chemotactic activity.
      <br/>
      In addition IL-8 can induce histamine release from basophils from both normal and atopic individuals GRO- ALPHA  and IL-8 can in addition, induce lysozomal enzyme release and respiratory burst from neutrophils.
      <br/>
      IL-8 has also been shown to increase the surface expression of Mac-1 (CD11b/CD18) on neutrophils without de novo protein synthesis.
      <br/>
      This may contribute to increased adhesion of the neutrophils to vascular endothelial cells.
      <br/>
      Many known diseases are characterized by massive neutrophil infiltration.
      <br/>
      As IL-8, Gro ALPHA , GRO BETA , GRO GAMMA  and NAP-2 promote the accumulation and activation of neutrophils, these chemokines have been implicated in a wide range of acute and chronic inflammatory disorders including psoriasis and rheumatoid arthritis, Baggiolini et al, FEBS Lett. 307, 97 (1992); Miller et al, Crit.

      <br/>
      In addition the ELR chemokines (those containing the amino acids ELR motif just prior to the CXC motif) have also been implicated in angiostasis.

    </p>
    <p num="6">
      In vitro, IL-8, Gro ALPHA , GRO BETA , GRO GAMMA  and NAP-2 induce neutrophil shape change, chemotaxis, granule release, and respiratory burst, by binding to and activating receptors of the seven-transmembrane, G-protein-linked family, in particular by binding to IL-8 receptors, most notably the B-receptor.

      <br/>
      The development of non-peptide small molecule antagonists for members of this receptor family has precedent.
      <br/>

      <br/>
      Hence, the IL-8 receptor represents a promising target for the development of novel anti-inflammatory agents.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      Two high affinity human IL-8 receptors (77% homology) have been characterized: IL-8R ALPHA , which binds only IL-8 with high affinity, and IL-8R BETA , which has high affinity for IL-8 as well as for GRO- ALPHA , GRO BETA , GRO GAMMA  and NAP-2.

    <p num="8">
      There remains a need for treatment, in this field, for compounds which are capable of binding to the IL-8  ALPHA  or  BETA  receptor.
      <br/>
      Therefore, conditions associated with an increase in IL-8 production (which is responsible for chemotaxis of neutrophil and T-cells subsets into the inflammatory site) would benefit by compounds which are inhibitors of IL-8 receptor binding.

    <heading>METHOD OF TREATMENT</heading>
    <p num="823">The compounds of Formula (I), (Ia), (II) and (III), or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof can be used in the manufacture of a medicament for the prophylactic or therapeutic treatment of any disease state in a human, or other mammal, which is exacerbated or caused by excessive or unregulated IL-8 cytokine production by such mammal's cell, such as but not limited to monocytes and/or macrophages, or other chemokines which bind to the IL-8  ALPHA  or  BETA  receptor, also referred to as the type I or type II receptor.</p>
    <p num="824">For purposes herein, the compounds of Formula (I), (Ia), (Ib), (Ic), (II) and (III) all have the same dosages, and dosage formulations as that of Formula (I) are used interchangeably.</p>
    <p num="825">
      Accordingly, the present invention provides a method of treating a chemokine mediated disease, wherein the chemokine is one which binds to an IL-8  ALPHA  or  BETA  receptor and which method comprises administering an effective amount of a compound of Formula (I) or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof.
      <br/>
      In particular, the chemokines are IL-8, GRO ALPHA , GRO BETA , GRO GAMMA  or NAP-2.
    </p>
    <p num="826">
      The compounds of Formula (I) are administered in an amount sufficient to inhibit cytokine function, in particular IL-8,GRO ALPHA , GRO BETA , GRO GAMMA  or NAP-2, such that they are biologically regulated down to normal levels of physiological function, or in some case to subnormal levels, so as to ameliorate the disease state.
      <br/>
      Abnormal levels of IL-8, GRO ALPHA , GRO BETA , GRO GAMMA  or NAP-2 for instance in the context of the present invention, constitute: (i) levels of free IL-8 greater than or equal to 1 picogram per mL; (ii) any-cell associated IL-8, GRO ALPHA , GRO BETA , GRO GAMMA  or NAP-2 above normal physiological levels; or (iii)the presence of IL-8, GRO ALPHA , GRO BETA , GRO GAMMA  or NAP-2 above basal levels in cells or tissues in which IL-8, GRO ALPHA , GRO BETA , GRO GAMMA  or NAP-2 respectively, is produced.
    </p>
    <p num="827">
      There are many disease states in which excessive or unregulated IL-8 production is implicated in exacerbating and/or causing the disease.
      <br/>
      Chemokine mediated diseases include psoriasis, atopic dermatitis, arthritis, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, adult respiratory distress syndrome, inflammatory bowel disease, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, stroke, septic shock, endotoxic shock, gram negative sepsis, toxic shock syndrome, cardiac and renal reperfusion injury, glomerulonephritis, thrombosis, graft vs. host reaction, alzheimers disease, allograft rejections, malaria, restinosis, angiogenesis or undesired hematopoietic stem cells release.
    </p>
    <p num="828">
      These diseases are primarily characterized by massive neutrophil infiltration, T-cell infiltration, or neovascular growth, and are associated with increased IL-8, GRO ALPHA , GRO BETA , GRO GAMMA  or NAP-2 production which is responsible for the chemotaxis of neutrophils into the inflammatory site or the directional growth of endothelial cells.
      <br/>
      In contrast to other inflammatory cytokines (IL-1, TNF, and IL-6), IL-8, GRO ALPHA , GRO BETA , GRO GAMMA  or NAP-2 has the unique property of promoting neutrophil chemotaxis, enzyme release including but not limited to elastase release as well as superoxide production and activation.
      <br/>
      The  ALPHA -chemokines but particularly, GRO ALPHA , GRO BETA , GRO GAMMA  or NAP-2, working through the IL-8 type I or II receptor can promote the neovascularization of tumors by promoting the directional growth of endothelial cells.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the inhibition of IL-8 induced chemotaxis or activation would lead to a direct reduction in the neutrophil infiltration.
    </p>
    <p num="829">
      The compounds of Formula (I) are administered in an amount sufficient to inhibit IL-8, binding to the IL-8 alpha or beta receptors, from binding to these receptors, such as evidenced by a reduction in neutrophil chemotaxis and activation.
      <br/>
      The discovery that the compounds of Formula (I) are inhibitors of IL-8 binding is based upon the effects of the compounds of Formulas (I) in the in vitro receptor binding assays which are described herein.
      <br/>
      The compounds of Formula (I) have been shown to be dual inhibitors of both recombinant type I and type II IL-8 receptors.
      <br/>
      Preferably the compounds are inhibitors of only one receptor, preferably Type II.

    <p num="830">
      As used herein, the term "IL-8 mediated disease or disease state" refers to any and all disease states in which IL-8, GRO ALPHA , GRO BETA , GRO GAMMA  or NAP-2 plays a role, either by production of IL-8, GRO ALPHA , GRO BETA , GRO GAMMA  or NAP-2 themselves, or by IL-8, GRO ALPHA , GRO BETA , GRO GAMMA  or NAP-2 causing another monokine to be released, such as but not limited to IL-1, IL-6 or TNF.
      <br/>
      A disease state in which, for instance, IL-1 is a major component, and whose production or action, is exacerbated or secreted in response to IL-8, would therefore be considered a disease stated mediated by IL-8.

      As used herein, the term "cytoline" refers to any secreted polypeptide that affects the functions of cells and is a molecule which modulates interactions between cells in the immune, inflammatory or hematopoietic response.
      <br/>
      A cytokine includes, but is not limited to, monolines and lympholiines, regardless of which cells produce them.
      <br/>
      For instance, a monokine is generally referred to as being produced and secreted by a mononuclear cell, such as a macrophage and/or monocyte.
      <br/>
      Many other cells however also produce monokines, such as natural killer cells, fibroblasts, basophils, neutrophils, endothelial cells, brain astrocytes, bone marrow stromal cells, epideral keratinocytes and B-lymphocytes.
      <br/>
      Lymphokines are generally referred to as being produced by lymphocyte cells.
      <br/>
      Examples of cytokines include, but are not limited to, Interleukin-1 (IL-1), Interleukin-6 (IL-6), Interleukin-8 (IL-8), Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha (TNF- ALPHA ) and Tumor Necrosis Factor beta (TNF- BETA ).

      A chemokine is primarily secreted through cell transmembranes and causes chemotaxis and activation of specific white blood cells and leukocytes, neutrophils, monocytes, macrophages, T-cells, B-cells, endothelial cells and smooth muscle cells.
      <br/>
      Examples of chemokines include, but are not limited to, IL-8, GRO- ALPHA , GRO- BETA , GRO- GAMMA , NAP-2, IP-10, MIP-1 ALPHA , MIP- BETA , PF4, and MCP 1, 2, and 3.

      The compounds of Formula (I) may be administered in conventional dosage forms prepared by combining a compound of Formula (I) with standard pharmaceutical carriers according to conventional procedures.
      <br/>
      The compounds of Formula (I) may also be administered in conventional dosages in combination with a known, second therapeutically active compound.
      <br/>
      These procedures may involve mixing, granulating and compressing or dissolving the ingredients as appropriate to the desired preparation.
      <br/>
      It will be appreciated that the form and character of the pharmaceutically acceptable character or diluent is dictated by the amount of active ingredient with which it is to be combined, the route of administration and other well-known variables.
      <br/>
      The carrier(s) must be "acceptable" in the sense of being compatible with the other ingredients of the formulation and not deleterious to the recipient thereof.
    </p>
    <p num="836">
      The pharmaceutical carrier employed may be, for example, either a solid or liquid.
      <br/>
      Exemplary of solid carriers are lactose, terra alba, sucrose, talc, gelatin, agar, pectin, acacia, magnesium stearate, stearic acid and the like.
      <br/>
      Exemplary of liquid carriers are syrup, peanut oil, olive oil, water and the like.

    <p num="846">The IL-8, and Gro- ALPHA  chemokine inhibitiory effects of compounds of the present invention were determined by the following in vitro assay:</p>
    <p num="847">Receptor Binding Assays:</p>
    <p num="848">
      �125 I� IL-8 (human recombinant) was obtained from Amersham Corp., Arlington Heights, Ill., with specific activity 2000 Ci/mmol.
      <br/>
      Gro- ALPHA  was obtained from NEN-New England Nuclear.
      <br/>
      All other chemicals were of analytical grade.
      <br/>
      High levels of recombinant human IL-8 type  ALPHA  and  BETA  receptors were individually expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells as described previously (Holmes, et al., Science, 1991, 253, 1278).
      <br/>
      The Chinese hamster ovary membranes were homogenized according to a previously described protocol (Haour, et al., J Biol Chem., 249 pp 2195-2205 (1974)).
      <br/>
      Except that the homogenization buffer was changed to 10 mM Tris-HCL, 1 mM MgSO4, 0.5 mM EDTA (ethylene-diaminetetra-acetic acid), 1 mMPMSF ( ALPHA -toluenesulphonyl fluoride), 0.5 mg/L Leupeptin, pH 7.5. Membrane protein concentration was determined using Pierce Co. micro-assay kit using bovine serum albumin as a standard.
      <br/>
      All assays were performed in a 96-well micro plate format.
      <br/>
      Each reaction mixture contained 125 I IL-8 (0.25 nM) or 125 I Gro- ALPHA  and 0.5  MU g/mL of IL-8R ALPHA  or 1.0  MU g/mL of IL-8R BETA  membranes in 20 mM Bis-Trispropane and 0.4 mM Tris HCl buffers, pH 8.0, containing 1.2 mM MgSO4, 0.1 mM EDTA, 25 mM NaCl and 0.03% CHAPS. In addition, drug or compound of interest was added which had been pre-dissolved in DMSO so as to reach a final concentration of between 0.01 nM and 100 uM.
      <br/>
      The assay was initiated by addition of 125 I-IL-8.
      <br/>
      After 1 hour at room temperature the plate was harvested using a Tomtec 96-well harvester onto a glass fiber filtermat blocked with 1% polyethylenimine/0.5% BSA and washed 3 times with 25 mM NaCl, 10 mM TrisHCl, 1 mM MgSO4, 0.5 mM EDTA, 0.03% CHAPS, pH 7.4. The filter was then dried and counted on the Betaplate liquid scintillation counter.
      <br/>
      The recombinant IL-8 R ALPHA , or Type I, receptor is also referred to herein as the non-permissive receptor and the recombinant IL-8 R BETA , or Type II, receptor is referred to as the permissive receptor.

    <p num="852">Chemotaxis Assay:</p>
    <p num="853">
      The in vitro inhibitory properties of these compounds were determined in the neutrophil chemotaxis assay as described in Current Protocols in Immunology, vol I, Suppl 1, Unit 6.12.3., whose disclosure is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.
      <br/>
      Neutrophils where isolated from human blood as described in Current Protocols in Immunology Vol I, Suppl 1 Unit 7.23.1, whose disclosure is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.
      <br/>
      The chemoattractants IL-8, GRO- ALPHA , GRO- BETA , GRO- GAMMA  and NAP-2 where placed in the bottom chamber of a 48 multiwell chamber (Neuro Probe, Cabin John.
      <br/>
      Md.) at a concentration between 0.1 and 100 nM.
      <br/>
      The two chambers where separated by a 5 um polycarbonate filter.
      <br/>
      When compounds of this invention were tested, they where mixed with the cells (0.001-1000 nM) just prior to the addition of the cells to the upper chamber.
      <br/>
      Incubation was allowed to proceed for between about 45 and 90 min at about 37 (degree)  C. in a humidified incubator with 5% CO2.
      <br/>
      At the end of the incubation period, the polycarbonate membrane was removed and the top side washed, the membrane was then stained using the Diff Quick staining protocol (Baxter Products, McGaw Park, Ill., USA).
      <br/>
      Cell which had chemotaxed to the chemokine were visually counted using a microscope.
      <br/>
      Generally, four fields where counted for each sample, these number where averaged to give the average number of cells which had migrated.
      <br/>
      Each sample was tested in triplicate and each compound repeated at least four times.
      <br/>
      To certain cells (positive control cells) no compound was added, these cells represent the maximum chemotactic response of the cells.
      <br/>
      In the case where a negative control (unstimulated) was desired, no chemokine was added to the bottom chamber.
      <br/>
      The difference between the positive control and the negative control represents the chemotactic activity of the cells.

    <p num="854">Elastase Release Assay:</p>
    <p num="855">
      The compounds of this invention where tested for their ability to prevent Elastase release from human neutrophils.
      <br/>
      Neutrophils where isolated from human blood as described in Current Protocols in Immunology Vol I, Suppl 1 Unit 7.23.1. PMNs 0.88 * 106 cells suspended in Ringer's Solution (NaCl 118, KCl 4.56, NaHCO3 25, KH2PO4 1.03, Glucose 11.1, HEPES 5 mM, pH 7.4) where placed in each well of a 96 well plate in a volume of 50 ul.
      <br/>
      To this plate was added the test compound (0.001-1000 nM) in a volume of 50 ul, Cytochalasin B in a volume of 50 ul (20 ug/ml) and Ringers buffer in a volume of 50 ul.
      <br/>
      These cells where allowed to warm (37 (degree)  C., 5% CO2, 95% RH) for 5 min before IL-8, GRO ALPHA , GRO BETA , GRO GAMMA  or NAP-2 at a final concentration of 0.01-1000 nM was added.
      <br/>
      The reaction was allowed to proceed for 45 min before the 96 well plate was centrifuiged (800 * g 5 min) and 100 ul of the supernatant removed.
      <br/>
      This suppernatant was added to a second 96 well plate followed by an artificial elastas substrate (MeOSuc-Ala-Ala-Pro-Val-AMC, Nova Biochem, La Jolla, Calif.) to a final concentration of 6 ug/ml dissolved in phosphate buffered saline.
      <br/>
      Immediately, the plate was placed in a fluorescent 96 well plate reader (Cytofluor 2350, Millipore, Bedford, Mass.) and data collected at 3 min intervals according to the method of Nakajima et al J. Biol Chem 254 4027 (1979).
      <br/>
      The amount of Elastase released from the PMNs was calculated by measuring the rate of MeOSuc-Ala-Ala-Pro-Val-AMC degradation.
