      <br/>
      A D/A converter realizes an output analog signal with less ripple within a wide range and includes (a) a bit recognizer for recognizing at least one bit of a digital input signal to thereby produce a pulse width signal and a control signal; (b) a PWM signal generator for generating a PWM signal with a variable pulse width according to a value of the input signal by modulating the input signal according to a PWM process; and (c) an output circuit for outputting an output pulse voltage according to the value of the input signal.
      <br/>
      The pulse width of the PWM signal is controlled by the pulse width signal, and the output pulse voltage is controlled by the control signal.
      <br/>
      The pulse width of the PWM signal and the output pulse voltage are controlled in such a way that an area of a pulse of the PWM signal is equal to an area of every other pulse.
      <br/>
      Each pulse of the PWM signal may be divided into blocks having different values designed for forming a specific expansion characteristic.

      Field of the Invention
    </p>
    <p num="2">The present invention relates to a Digital-to-Analog (D/A) conversion and more particularly, to a D/A conversion method and a D/A converter designed for this method, in which Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) is used.</p>
    <p num="3">2. Description of the Prior Art</p>
    <p num="4">FIG. 1 schematically shows a conventional D/A converter, which is comprised of a Pulse Width Modulator (PWM) circuit 102, a latch circuit 104, and a Low-Pass Filter (LPF) circuit 105.</p>
    <p num="5">
      A digital input signal SIN is applied to the PWM circuit 102.
      <br/>
      The input signal SIN is a stream of coding pulses produced by modulating or encoding an original analog input signal according to Pulse Code Modulation (PCM).
      <br/>
      In other words, the input signal SIn is a stream of Pulse-Code-Modulated (PCM) pulses.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      The PWM circuit 102 receives the digital input signal SIN through an input terminal T1.
      <br/>
      The PWM circuit 102 modulates the PCM input signal SIN to produce a modulated output signal SPWM having a variable pulse width proportional to the amplitude of the input signal SIN.
      <br/>
      The modulated output signal SPWM is applied to the latch circuit 104.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      The latch circuit 104 is formed by a Complementary Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor (CMOS) inverter comprising p- and n-channel MOS Field_effect Transistors (MOSFETs) M1 and M2.
      <br/>

      A source of the n-channel MOSFET M2 is connected to the ground.
      <br/>
      A source of the p-channel MOSFET M1 is connected to a power supply line applied with a power supply voltage VSS.
      <br/>
      Drains of the MOSFETs M1 and M2 are coupled together to be connected to an input terminal of the LPF circuit 105.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      When the PWM output signal SPWM is in the logic high (H) level, the modulated output signal SLC of the latch circuit 104 is in the logic low (L) level.
      <br/>
      Thus, the output signal SLC is equal to zero or the ground voltage.
      <br/>
      When the PWM output signal SPWM is i the logic L level, the output signal SLC of the latch circuit 104 is in the logic H level.
      <br/>
      Thus, the output signal SLC is equal to the power supply voltage VSS.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      The LPF circuit 105 receives the output signal SLC of the latch circuit 104 and removes its high-frequency components, thereby producing a smooth continuous analog output signal SOUT at an output terminal T2.
      <br/>
      The analog output signal SOUT is a same as the original analog input signal.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      With the conventional D/A converter described above, when the maximum pulse width of each sample of the input signal SIN is WS, the sampling frequency is fS, and the pulse voltage of each sample is VP, the maximum voltage VMOUT of the analog output signal SOUT is given as
      <br/>
      VMOUT =k * WS * VP,   (1)
    </p>
    <p num="11">where k is a constant.</p>
    <p num="12">Therefore, to increase the maximum voltage VMOUT of the analog output signal SOUT, the pulse voltage VP of each sample needs to be increased.</p>
    <p num="13">
      Also, when the PCM input signal SIN is an n-bit signal (n is a natural number) and the PWM circuit 102 is formed by a counter operated at a frequency fc, the clock frequency fc of the counter is expressed as
      <br/>
      fc =fS * 2n   (2)
    </p>
    <p num="14">
      This means that the clock frequency fc of the counter needs to be 2n times as large as the sampling frequency fS .
      <br/>
      In this case, the magnitude MQS of the quantization step of each sample is given as
      <br/>
      MQS =k * WS * VP * (fS /fc)   (3)
    </p>
    <p num="15">
      Thus, if the clock frequency fc of the counter is fixed and the sampling frequency fS is unchanged, the maximum voltage VMOUT of the analog output signal SOUT increases with the increasing voltage VP.
      <br/>
      In this case, however, there arises a disadvantage that the magnitude MQS of the quantization step of each sample also becomes larger with the increasing pulse voltage VP.
    </p>
    <p num="16">
      Moreover, if the original analog signal has the highest frequency f0, the highest frequency f0 satisfies the following relationship due to the sampling theorem.
      <br/>
      2f0 &lt;= fS   (4)
    </p>
    <p num="17">
      Therefore, from the above equation (2) and the above inequality (4), the clock frequency fc of the counter satisfies the following inequality (5).
      <br/>
      2 * f0 * 2n &lt;= fc   (5)
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      It is seen from the inequality (5) that the clock frequency fc of the counter has the minimum value of (2 * f0 * 2n).
      <br/>
      Accordingly, there arises a disadvantage that the latch circuit 104 serving as an output circuit is required to have a switching speed corresponding to the clock signal with a frequency as high as (2 * f0 * 2n) or higher.
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      Additionally, the signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) for a linear- or uniform-quantized PCM signal is given by
      <br/>
      S/N=1.7+6B,   (6)
    </p>
    <p num="20">
      where B is the number of quantization bits of the PCM signal.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the S/N of the PCM signal degrades with its decreasing level due to quantization noise.
      <br/>
      If the number B of the quantization bits is increased to improve the S/N, the total amount of information to be transmitted is increased.
    </p>
    <p num="21">Thus, to improve the S/N of the PCM signal without increasing the total amount of information to be transmitted, there have been developed and practically used the logarithmic compression codes termed " MU -law" and "A-law".</p>
    <p num="22">
      The logarithmic compression code " MU -law" is a 8-bit PCM code having first to eighth bits.
      <br/>
      The full-scale amplitude of the original analog signal is divided into 15 equal segments to form 16 steps.
      <br/>
      Each of the segments thus formed is linear- or uniform-quantized to form 16 equal quantization steps.
      <br/>
      The first bit, i.e., the Most Significant Bit (MSB), of the  MU -law code is a sign bit to represent the polarity of the original analog signal.
      <br/>
      The second to fourth bits of the  MU -law code are segment bits to designate one of the 16 segments.
      <br/>
      The fifth to eighth bits of the  MU -law code are step bits to designate one of the 16 quantization steps for a corresponding one of the 16 segments.
    </p>
    <p num="23">
      The logarithmic compression code "A-law" also is a 8-bit PCM code having first to eighth bits.
      <br/>
      The full-scale amplitude of the original analog signal is divided into 13 equal segments to form 14 steps.
      <br/>
      Each of the segments thus formed is linear- or uniform-quantized to form 16 equal quantization steps.
      <br/>
      The first bit, i.e., the Most Significant Bit (MSB), of the A-law code is a sign bit to represent the polarity of the original analog signal.
      <br/>
      The second to fourth bits of the A-law code are segment bits to designate one of the 14 segments.
      <br/>
      The fifth to eighth bits of the A-law code are step bits to designate one of the 16 quantization steps for a corresponding one of the 14 segments.
    </p>
    <p num="24">With the conventional D/A converter shown in FIG. 1, however, there are the following problems.</p>
    <p num="25">
      First, the maximum pulse width of the PWM signal SPWM is determined by the sampling frequency fS.
      <br/>
      Therefore, to improve the pulse-width resolution of the PWM signal SPWM, the clock frequency fc of the counter serving as the PWM circuit 102, which determines the step number of the variable pulse width of the PWM signal SPWM, needs to be raised.
      <br/>
      In this case, however, there arises a problem that the relating hardware is required to operate at a higher speed and the power consumption is increased.
    </p>
    <p num="26">
      If the voltage or amplitude of the PWM signal SPWM is increased in order to expand the dynamic range of the analog output signal SOUT, the quantization step is increased and as a result, the minimum level of the output signal SOUT becomes higher according to the increased quantization step.
      <br/>
      Therefore, in this case also, the clock frequency fc of the counter serving as the SWM circuit 102 needs to be raised for reduction of the quantization step.
      <br/>
      Thus, there arises the same problem as above.
    </p>
    <p num="27">Second, there is a problem that the highest switching speed of the latch circuit 104, which allows the clock frequency fc of the counter having the minimum value of (2 * fo * 2n) to be inputted, limits the highest frequency fo of the applicable original analog signal.</p>
    <p num="28">
      Third, when the rotation of a motor is controlled by the use of the PWM signal SPWM, there is a problem that an uneven rotation of the motor occurs at a low duty of the signal SPWM.
      <br/>
      The uneven rotation is not completely removed, because the analog output signal SOUT contains some ripple at a low duty of the signal SPWM even after a averaging or smoothing operation by the LPF circuit 105.
    </p>
    <p num="29">
      Fourth, if the applied PCM signal SIN is linearly or uniformly quantized, the quantization noise becomes large at the low level of the signal SIN.
      <br/>
      If the bit number of the PCM signal SIN is increased to suppress the quantization noise, there arises a problem that the total amount of information or data to be transmitted is increased and at the same time, the clock frequency fc of the counter serving as the PWM circuit 102 needs to be raised.
      <br/>
      This problem is solved by the use of the above-described logarithmic compression codes termed " MU -law" and "A-law".
      <br/>
      However, in this case, there arises another problem that a conversion operation to convert the uniformly quantized PCM signal SIN to a logarithmically quantized one is required.
    </p>
    <p num="30">On the other hand, a PWM signal generator circuit applicable to speed or phase control of a motor in a Video Tape Recorder (VTR) is disclosed in the Japanese Non-Examined Patent Publication No. 4-192723 published in July 1992.</p>
    <p num="31">
      In this conventional PWM signal generator circuit, a PWM output signal with a variable pulse width according to an applied digital signal is produced.
      <br/>
      The PWM output signal has a first voltage corresponding to the logic high (H) level or a second voltage corresponding to the logic low (L) level.
      <br/>
      Each of the first and second voltages may have two or more different values.
    </p>
    <p num="32">
      With the conventional PWM signal generator circuit disclosed in the Japanese Non-Examined Patent Publication No. 4-192723, the output voltage range is expanded and the uneven rotation is suppressed due to resolution improvement of the PWM output signal.

      However, there is a problem that the uneven rotation of the motor is not satisfactorily reduced.

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
    <p num="64">Preferred embodiments of the present invention will be described below referring to the drawings attached.</p>
    <p num="65">A D/A converter according to a first embodiment of the present invention has a configuration as shown in FIG. 2.</p>
    <p num="66">
      As shown in FIG. 1, this D/A converter is comprised of an input signal processor 1, a PWM circuit 2, a voltage controller 3, a latch circuit 4 serving as a sample-and-hold (S/H) circuit, and a LPF circuit 5.
      <br/>
      Reference symbols T1 and T2 denote input and output terminals of the D/A converter, respectively.
    </p>
    <p num="67">
      A digital input signal SIN is applied to the input signal processor 1 through the input terminal T1.
      <br/>
      Here, the input signal SIN is an n-bit PCM signal, where n is a natural number.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the input signal SIN is formed by a stream of bits or coding pulses produced by modulating or encoding an original analog signal according to the PCM coding process.
      <br/>
      A part of the successive bits or coding pulses included in a sampling period T represents the amplitude of each sample of the original analog signal, where the samples of the original analog signal are produced by sampling the original analog signal at a sampling frequency fs (=1/T).
    </p>
    <p num="68">As shown in FIG. 2, the input signal processor 1 has a MSB recognizer 12 and a shift register 13.</p>
    <p num="69">
      The MSB recognizer 12 checks the MSB of the input signal SIN and recognizes whether the value of the MSB is "1" or "0".
      <br/>
      Then, the MSB recognizer 12 sends a control signal SCON1 to a controller 7 which is typically formed by a Central Processing Unit (CPU) or Digital Signal Processor (DSP).
      <br/>
      In response to the control signal SCON1, the controller 7 sends a control signal SCON2 to the voltage controller 3.
    </p>
    <p num="70">On the other hand, the MSB recognizer 12 transmits serial bit data of the input signal SIN to the shift register 13 as an output signal SMSB of the MSB recognizer 12.</p>
    <p num="71">
      The shift register 13 receives the serial bit data of the input signal SIN through the output signal SMSB of the MSB recognizer 12, and converts the serial bit data to a parallel bit data.
      <br/>
      The parallel bit data of the input signal SIN is sent to the PWM circuit 21 as an output signal SISP of the input signal processor 1.
    </p>
    <p num="72">
      The PWM circuit 2 includes a counter 21 for counting the number of an applied, pulsed clock signal SCLC with a clock frequency fc.
      <br/>
      The count of the counter 21 is reset by a pulsed sampling signal SSMP with the same sampling frequency fs as used in the formation or PCM process of the digital input signal SIN.
      <br/>
      In other words, the counter 21 repeats the same counting operation during each sampling period T.
    </p>
    <p num="73">The pulsed clock signal SCLC and the pulsed sampling signal SSMP are generated by the controller 7 and then, they are sent to the counter 21.</p>
    <p num="74">
      The counter 21 receives the parallel bit data of the input signal SIN through the output signal SISP of the input signal processor 1 as a final count value.
      <br/>
      Then, the counter 21 starts the counting operation from a specific initial value (e.g., 0) to the final count value thus received.
      <br/>
      After the count value is equal to the final value, the counting operation is stopped.
    </p>
    <p num="75">
      The counter 21 outputs a PWM output signal SPWM with a variable pulse width to the latch circuit 4.
      <br/>
      The pulse width of the PWM output signal SPWM at each quantized sample is proportional to the amplitude of the original analog signal at each sample.
    </p>
    <p num="76">
      During the counting operation of the counter 21, the output signal SPWM of the counter 21 or the PWM circuit 2 is in the logic low L level.
      <br/>
      Therefore, an output signal SLC of the latch circuit 4 is in the logic H level and has a value of VH, i.e., a power supply voltage VCC (V) applied to the latch circuit 4.
      <br/>
      After the counting operation, the output signal SPWM of the counter 21 is in the logic H level.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the output signal SLC of the latch circuit 4 is in the logic L level and has a value of VL, i.e., 0 (V).
    </p>
    <p num="77">
      The latch circuit 4, which serves as an output circuit of the D/A converter, is formed by a CMOS inverter comprising p- and n-channel MOSFETs 41 and 42.
      <br/>
      Gates of the MOSFETs 41 and 42 are coupled together to be connected to the output terminal of the PWM circuit 2 or counter 21.
      <br/>
      A source of the n-channel MOSFET 42 is connected to the ground.
      <br/>
      A source of the p-channel MOSFET 41 is connected to a power supply line applied with the power supply voltage VCC through an npn-type bipolar transistor 43.
      <br/>
      Drains of the MOSFETs 41 and 42 are coupled together to be connected to an input terminal of the LPF circuit 5.
    </p>
    <p num="78">
      The source of the p-channel MOSFET 41 is connected to an emitter of the transistor 43.
      <br/>
      A collector of the transistor 43 is connected to the power supply line of VCC.
      <br/>
      A base of the transistor 43 is connected to the output terminal of the voltage controller 3.
    </p>
    <p num="79">
      Since the output signal SPWM of the counter 21 is in the logic L level during the counting operation of the counter 21, the output signal SLC of the latch circuit 4 is equal to the power supply voltage VCC (V).
      <br/>
      After the counting operation, the output signal SPWM of the counter 21 is in the logic H level and therefore, the output signal SLC of the latch circuit 4 is equal to 0 (V).
      <br/>
      Thus, the output signal SLC has a stairstep representation of the original analog signal.
    </p>
    <p num="80">
      The LPF circuit 5 receives the stairstep output signal SLC of the latch circuit 4 and removes its high-frequency components with frequencies above one half the sampling frequency fs, thereby producing a smooth continuous analog output signal SOUT at the output terminal T2.
      <br/>
      The analog output signal SOUT thus outputted is the same as the original analog signal.
      <br/>
      The smooth continuous analog output signal SOUT is produced by integrating or averaging the stairstep output signal SLC during each sampling period T in the LPF circuit 5.

      Here, it is supposed that the applied PCM input signal SIN is a 4-bit signal of bits b3, b2, b1, and b0, as shown in FIGS. 5A and 5B. Here, the format of the signal SIN is represented as �b3, b2, b1, b0 �. The MSB is the bit b3 and the Least Significant Bit (LSB) is the bit b0.
      <br/>
      In response to this, the shift register 13 is a 4-bit register.
    </p>
    <p num="92">First, the MSB recognizer 12 of the input signal processor 1 recognizes the value of MSB (i.e., b3) of the input signal SIN.</p>
    <p num="93">When the MSB of the applied PCM input signal SIN has a value "1" (i.e., b3 =1), as shown in FIG. 5A, the serial bit data S12 of �b3, b2, b1, b0 � are sent to the 4-bit shift register 13 where no change is applied thereto.</p>
    <p num="94">
      The serial bit data S12 of �b3, b2, b1, b0 � are converted to the parallel bit data by the shift register 13.
      <br/>
      Then, the parallel bit data is applied to the counter 21 of the PWM circuit 2 as the final count value through the output signal SISP of the input signal processor 1.
    </p>
    <p num="95">
      After the count of the counter 21 is reset by the sampling signal SSMP, the counter 21 starts to count the pulses of the clock signal SCLC upward from the initial value (e.g., 0) until the count value is equal to the final value (i.e., the value represented by the parallel bit data) during each sampling period T. The duration or period of the counting operation, which is equal to the pulse width of the PWM output signal SPWM, is proportional to the amplitude value of the original analog signal of each sample.
      <br/>
      In this case, since the MSB has a value "1", the duty of the PWM output signal SPWM is greater than 50%.
    </p>
    <p num="96">During the counting operation, the PWM output signal SPWM is kept in the logic L level, thereby holding the output signal SLC of the latch circuit 4 in the logic H level (VH).</p>
    <p num="97">
      On the other hand, the fact that the MSB of the applied PCM input signal SIN has a value "1" (i.e., b3 =1) is transmitted to the controller 7 through the control signal SCON1.

      Then, the controller 7 sends the control signal SCON2 to the voltage controller 3 so that the latch circuit 4 outputs the output signal SLC equal to the logic H level voltage VH, i.e., VCC. Here, the base voltage of the bipolar transistor 43 in the latch circuit 4 is set as a specific positive value allowing the base-to-emitter voltage of the transistor 43 to be approximately equal to 0 (i.e., the transistor 43 is turned ON) for this purpose.

    <p num="98">
      Thus, when the MSB of the applied PCM input signal SIN has a value "1" (i.e., b3 =1), where the duty of the PWM pulse signal SPPWM is greater than 50%, the output signal SLC is always equal to VCC.

    <p num="99">When the MSB of the applied PCM input signal SIN has a value of "0" (i.e., b3 =0), where the duty of the PWM pulse signal SPWM is less than 50%, the operation is different from that of the conventional D/A converter shown in FIG. 1.</p>
    <p num="100">Specifically, when the MSB of the applied PCM input signal SIN has a value "0" (i.e., b3 =0), the third to first bits (excluding the MSB) b2, b1, and b0 are shifted to the left by one bit and at the same time, a "0" is inserted in the first-bit space instead of the first bit b0, as shown in FIG. 5B. As a result, a shifted serial bit data of �b2, b1, b0, 0� is obtained.</p>

      Here, the base voltage of the bipolar transistor 43 in the latch circuit 4 is set as a specific positive value allowing the emitter-collector voltage of the transistor 43 is equal to (VCC /2) for this purpose.

    <p num="107">Thus, when the MSB of the applied PCM input signal SIN has a value "0" (i.e., b3 =0), the output signal SLC is equal to (VCC /2) while the duty of the PWM signal SPWM is equal to 2T' (&lt;T), as shown in FIG. 3E.

    <p num="110">Accordingly, as shown in FIG. 3F, the resultant analog output signal SOUT includes smaller ripples than those of the conventional D/A converter shown in FIG. 3D. This means that the rotation unevenness of a motor is reduced.</p>

      Also, as seen from FIGS. 4B and 4C, the rectangular pulse in FIG. 4C has an area of �2T' * (VCC /2)�=(T' * VCC).

      On the other hand, the rectangular pulse in FIG. 4B has an area of (T' * VCC).
      <br/>
      Thus, the rectangular pulse shown in FIG. 4C has an equal area to the rectangular pulse shown in FIG. 4B and therefore, the resultant analog signal SOUT has the same waveform in both cases shown in FIGS. 4B and 4C.

      The resolution of D/A conversion is defined as the quantization step (i.e., the minimum increment or decrement) of the variable pulse width of the PWM output signal SPWM of the PWM circuit 2.

      In the conventional D/A converter shown in FIG. 1, the quantization step is one fourth (1/4) of the whole pulse width T', as shown in FIG. 4B. On the other hand, in the D/A converter according to the first embodiment shown in FIG. 2, the quantization step is one eighth (1/8) of the whole pulse width 2T', as shown in FIG. 4C.

    <p num="118">The input signal processor 1a has a bit recognizer 11 and a 4-bit shift register 13.</p>
    <p num="119">The bit recognizer 11 checks the bits of the input signal SIN from the MSB toward the LSB and recognizes the bit number of a "1"-valued one of the bits.</p>
    <p num="120">
      In detail, first, it is checked whether the tenth bit or MSB a9 of the input signal SIN has a value "1" or not.
      <br/>
      If the MSB a9 has a value "1", the checking operation is finished at that stage.
      <br/>
      Subsequently, the uppermost four (i.e., tenth, ninth, eighth, and seventh) bits a9, a8, a7, and a6 are transmitted to the 4-bit shift register 13 as a serial bit data, as shown in FIG. 7A.

      After the counting operation is finished, the output signal SPWM of the counter 21 is in a logic H level, so that the output signal SLC of the latch circuit 4 has a voltage value (VL) corresponding to the logic L level of the latch circuit 4, i.e., 0 (V).
    </p>
    <p num="147">With the D/A converter according to the second embodiment, as explained above, the 10-bit PCM-coded input signal SIN is converted by the use of the 4-bit shift register 13 in the input signal processor 1 and the 4-bit counter 21 in the PWM circuit 2 without increasing the clock frequency fC.</p>
    <p num="148">
      In other words, the 10-bit dynamic range is realized by the use of the 4-bit shift register 13 and the 4-bit counter 21.
      <br/>
      This means that the D/A conversion of the 10-bit PCM-coded input signal SIN is able to be accomplished by the counter clock signal SCLC having the clock frequency fC equal to 24 (=16) times as much as the sampling frequency fS.
    </p>
    <p num="149">On the other hand, in the conventional D/A converter shown in FIG. 1, the counter clock signal SCLC needs to have the clock frequency fC equal to 210 (=1024) times as much as the sampling frequency fS for this purpose.</p>
    <p num="150">
      In the second embodiment, the 10-bit PCM-coded input signal SIN, the 4-bit shift register 13, and the 4-bit counter 21 are used.
      <br/>
      However, it is needless to say that the present invention is not limited to this case.
    </p>
    <p num="151">
      If the PCM-coded input signal SIN is a k-bit signal and the maximum output voltage VCC of the latch circuit 4 is quantized to 2n steps, where k and n are natural numbers and k is greater than n (i.e., k&gt;n), it is sufficient that the bit number of the counter 21 is set as (k+l-n).
      <br/>
      In this case, as shown in FIG. 7D, the area of each pulse of the PWM signal SPWM is expressed as �2n * T' * (VCc /2n)�, which is always equal to the original pulse area (T' * VCC).
    </p>
    <p num="152">Unlike the first embodiment where the output signal SLC of the latch circuit 4 may have two values of VCC and (VCC /2), the output signal SLC may have (n+1) non-zero values of VCC, (VCc /2), (VCC /4), . . . , and (VCC /2n) in the second embodiment.</p>
    <p num="153">In the second embodiment, the ripples occurring in the analog output signal SOUT are smaller than those in the first embodiment.</p>
    <p num="154">FIG. 8 shows a D/A converter according to a third embodiment of the present invention, which is another variation of the first embodiment.</p>
    <p num="155">Unlike the first and second embodiments where each pulse of the PWM signal SPWM has a fixed voltage level over its whole width, each pulse of the PWM signal SPWM has a variable voltage level within its whole width.</p>
    <p num="156">
      Specifically, as shown in FIG. 9, each pulse of the PWM signal SPWM is symmetrically and equally divided into ten blocks BL1, BL2, BL3, BL4, BL5, BL6, BL7, BL8, BL9, and BL10 with respect to its vertical center line.
      <br/>
      Therefore, when the pulse of the PWM signal SPWM has a variable width W, each of the blocks BL1, BL2, BL3, BL4, BL5, BL6, BL7, BL8, BL9, and BL10 has a same width (W/10).
    </p>
    <p num="157">
      The two blocks BL1 and BL10, which are located at each end of the pulse, have a same voltage value V1.
      <br/>
      The two blocks BL2 and BL9, which are located adjacent to the corresponding blocks BL1 and BL10, have a same voltage value V2 less than V1.
      <br/>
      The two blocks BL3 and BL8, which are located adjacent to the corresponding blocks BL2 and BL9, have a same voltage value V3 less than V2.
      <br/>
      The two blocks BL4 and BL7, which are located adjacent to the corresponding block BL3 and BL8, have a same voltage value V4 less than V3.
      <br/>
      The two blocks BL5 and BL6, which are located adjacent to the corresponding blocks BL4 and BL7 at the middle of the pulse, have a same voltage value V5 less than V4.
    </p>
    <p num="158">
      If the duty of the pulse of the PWM signal SPWM is 100%, the pulse has a waveform as shown in FIG. 11B. This waveform includes the ten blocks BL1 to BL10 corresponding to ten pulses of a segment signal shown in FIG. 11A. Each of the ten blocks BL1 to BL10 is formed to be synchronized with each pulse of the segment signal.
      <br/>
      The reference symbols ts1, to ts11 denote the time at which each pulse of the segment signal is applied to the counter 21.
    </p>
    <p num="159">If the duty of the pulse of the PWM signal SPWM is less than 50%, the pulse has a waveform as shown in FIG. 11C, which includes the four blocks BL1 to BL4 and a half of the block BL5 corresponding to four pulses and a half of the segment signal.</p>
    <p num="160">The D/A converter according to the third embodiment capable of the above-identified operation has the configuration shown in FIG. 8, in which a PWM circuit 2 including a counter 21, a latch circuit 4 serving as a S/H circuit, and a low-pass filter 5 are the same as those in the first embodiment.</p>
    <p num="161">
      Unlike the first and second embodiments, in the third embodiment, the input signal SIN is a PCM signal encoded according to the logarithmic compression code " MU -law" or "A-law".
      <br/>
      Each sample of the input signal SIN has a sign bit, segment bits, and step (or quantization) bits.
    </p>
    <p num="162">An input signal processor 1b includes a bit recognizer 11a and a shift register 13.</p>
    <p num="163">The bit recognizer 11a checks the sign bit, the segment bits, and the step bits of the input signal SIN and recognizes the polarity from the sign bit, the segment number representing one of the ten segments BL1 to BL10 from the segment bits, and the voltage value from V1 to V5 from the step bits.</p>
    <p num="164">
      Then, the recognizer 11a transmits the polarity, segment, and step bit data of the signal SIN to the shift register 13 as an output signal SISP of the input signal processor 1b.
      <br/>
      Subsequently, in the same way as the first embodiment, the output signal SISP is applied to the counter 21 of the PWM circuit 2 and outputs the PWM output signal SPWM to the latch circuit 4.
      <br/>
      Thus, the PWM output signal SPWM is kept in the logic L level during a period corresponding to the pulse width of the signal SPWM.
    </p>
    <p num="165">
      On the other hand, the bit recognizer 11a transmits a control signal SCON1 advising the specified voltage values for the corresponding pulse blocks to the controller 7.
      <br/>
      In response to this control signal SCON1, the controller 7 sends a control signal SCON2 to the voltage controller 3b, thereby causing the latch circuit 4 to output one of the specified voltage values V1 to V5 synchronized with a corresponding one of the blocks BL1 to BL10.
    </p>
    <p num="166">
      The above-described segment signal, which is produced in the controller 7, is sent to the voltage controller 3b along with the control signal SCON2 and to the counter 21 through a control signal SCON3.
      <br/>
      Each of the blocks BL1 to BL10 is generated synchronized with the segment signal.
    </p>
    <p num="167">The voltage controller 3b necessitating the output of five different voltage values V1, V2, V3, V4, and V5 may be readily realized by the use of a known circuit such as a R-2R ladder circuit or the like.</p>
    <p num="168">FIG. 10 shows the transfer (or, input-output) characteristic of the PWM circuit 2, in which the ordinate is the input digital data of the input signal SIN and the abscissa is the pulse amplitude of the PWM output signal SPWM.</p>
    <p num="169">
      In FIG. 10, the ordinate is equally or linearly divided into ten steps of 5 DELTA , 4 DELTA , 3 DELTA , 2 DELTA ,  DELTA , -1 DELTA , -2 DELTA , -3 DELTA , -4 DELTA , and -5 DELTA , where  DELTA  is the quantization step of the amplitude of the original analog signal.
      <br/>
      The abscissa is unequally or logarithmically divided into ten voltage steps of V5, V4, V3, V2, V1, -V1, -V2, -V3, -V4, and -V5.
      <br/>
      These ten voltage steps are designed to logarithmically decrease from V5 to -V5.
      <br/>
      Thus, the transfer characteristic shown in FIG. 10 is a logarithmic characteristic produced by the use of the segment approximation.
    </p>
    <p num="170">Due to this logarithmic characteristic, the input digital data SIN is logarithmically expanded by the PWM circuit 2 and is outputted through the latch circuit 4 and the LPF circuit 5.</p>
    <p num="171">
      For example, when the pulse of the signal SPWM has the waveform shown in FIG. 11C, first, the block BL1 is specified.
      <br/>
      Then, the voltage value of the pulse of the output signal SLC of the latch circuit 4 is set as V1 by the voltage controller 3b through the control signals SCON1 and SCON2.
      <br/>
      The pulse width of the SWP signal SPWM is set as (W/10) by counting the number from a specific initial value to a specific final value corresponding to a width of (W/10) in the counter 21.
    </p>
    <p num="172">
      Next, the block BL2 is specified.
      <br/>
      Then, the voltage value of the pulse of the output signal SLC of the latch circuit 4 is set as V2 by the voltage controller 3b through the control signals SCON1 and SCON2.
      <br/>
      The pulse width of the SWP signal SPWM is set as (W/10) by counting the number form the specific initial value to the same specific final value corresponding to the width of (W/10) in the counter 21.
    </p>
    <p num="173">Further, in the same way as above, the blocks BL3 and BL4 are successively produced.</p>
    <p num="174">
      Finally, the block BL5 is specified.
      <br/>
      Then, the voltage value of the pulse of the output signal SLC of the latch circuit 4 is set as V5 by the voltage controller 3b through the control signals SCON1 and SCON2.
      <br/>
      The pulse width of the SWP signal SPWM is set as (W/20) by counting the number from the specific initial value to a specific final value corresponding to a width of (W/20) in the counter 21.
    </p>
    <p num="175">Thus, the pulse of the signal SPWM having the waveform shown in FIG. 11C is produced.</p>
    <p num="176">
      With the D/A converter according to the third embodiment, as explained above, the PCM input signal PIN is logarithmically compressed in an A/D conversion process.
      <br/>
      Therefore, it has the "sign bit" representing the polarity of the original analog signal at each sample, the "segments bits" representing the segment number or location of the original analog signal at each sample, and the "step bits" representing the step number or location of the original analog signal at each sample.
    </p>
    <p num="177">If the segments and voltage values in each pulse of the PWM signal SPWM are designed to satisfy the  MU -law or A-law compression code, the D/A converter according to the third embodiment is capable of expansion of the logarithmically-compressed input signal SIN according to the  MU -law or A-law compression code.</p>
    <p num="178">
      If the PCM input signal PIN is linearly quantized, the voltage value of each pulse of the PWM signal SPWM is fixed at a value by changing the operation of the voltage controller 3b and the controller 7.
      <br/>
      In this case, this D/A converter is capable of a same operation as those in the first and second embodiments.
    </p>
    <p num="179">
      The operation of switching between the linear and logarithmic expansions may be readily realized by sending a suitable control signal to the level recognizer 11 and the voltage controller 3b.
      <br/>
      The control signal is typically produced by the controller 7.
    </p>
    <p num="180">Although the width of the blocks BL1 to BL10 are equal to (W/10) in the third embodiment, they may have any other same value or different values as necessary.</p>
