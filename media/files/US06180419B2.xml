    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="1">The present invention relates to a method for manufacturing a semiconductor device, and more especially to a method for manufacturing a magnetic field transducer.</p>
    <heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">
      A Hall Effect device is frequently employed as a transducer in a circuit for sensing a magnetic field.
      <br/>
      However, the circuit layout is desired in an integrated circuit form at the present time, so the ability to incorporate the transducer as part of the integrated circuit is therefore considered in the present invention.
    </p>
    <p num="3">
      Although silicon is frequently used to manufacture the semiconductor device, the carrier mobility of silicon is relatively lower than that of the III V group such as GaAs and InP so that its sensitivity is reduced.
      <br/>
      It is quite bothersome to ask for a relatively higher gain upon designing the process of the integrated circuit layout, since a demand for higher gain leads to unavoidable trouble in achieving the after-stage amplifying circuit layout.
      <br/>
      Therefore, if the sensitivity of the transducer can be improved, it is very helpful to integrate the transducer with the integrated circuit.
    </p>

    <p num="24">
      A first photoresist (not shown) made of an AZ 6400-type photoresist is covered on an n-type silicon substrate 13, and a first mask is implemented in a photolithography etching process to form on the substrate 13 an exposed annular portion (not shown) for later being etched through to form an annular groove 12 having respectively a depth, a width and a circumferential length of 2  MU m, 100  MU m and 2000  MU m by an etching solution composed by HNO3, HF(Aq) and CH3 COOH having a ratio of 26:1:33.
      <br/>
      A first SiO2 layer 17 with a thickness of about 300 nm for forming a second photoresist (not shown) is deposited over the silicon substrate 13 and a second mask photolithography etching process is implemented to etch the second photoresist in order to define on the silicon substrate 13 an exposed region (not shown) for forming by the etching solution a diffusion opening 20 for later being processed via doping the substrate 13 by POCl3 at about 25 (degree)  C. for about 10 minutes and a drive-in process at about 900 (degree)  C. for about 20 minutes in order to form an n+ region 11 including therein a high density dopant in the substrate 13.
      <br/>
      Further formed is a third photoresist (not shown) on the substrate 13 by growing a second SiO2 layer 18 with a thickness of about 300 nm on the n+ region 11 and by using a third mask photolithography etching process to form exposed regions (not shown) on the substrate 13 for later defining the contacts on the n+ region 11 by the etching solution.
      <br/>
      Thereafter, Al layer 21 is plated having a thickness of about 500 nm on the contacts C0.about.C4, H1.about.H4 and H1'.about.H4' of the n+ region 11 over the substrate 13, and the Al layer 21 is patterned by a fourth photolithography etching process, as shown in FIG. 2.
    </p>
    <p num="25">In addition, deposit an oxide (SiO2) layer 14 having a thickness of about 500 nm on the back of the silicon substrate 13, as shown in FIGS. 1(b) &amp; 1(c), and plate a magnetic film including an Ni layer 15 and a Co layer 16 both having a thickness of about 100 nm on the oxide (SiO2) layer 14 in order to obtain a magnetic field transducing device which can be integrated with a relevant circuit.</p>
    <p num="26">FIG. 3 shows comparing results of the Hall currents respectively generated by a preferred embodiment of a magnetic field transducer according to the present invention and a conventional Hall device not being plated thereon a magnetic film, with an application of a bias current and a variety of the flux densities having different intensities along the X direction.</p>

    <p num="31">
      According to FIGS. 3.about.5, comparing results of the Hall currents respectively generated by a preferred embodiment of a magnetic field transducer according to the present invention and a conventional Hall device not being plated thereon a magnetic film, with an application of a bias current and a variety of the flux densities having different intensities along the X, Y and Z directions, it is evident that the sensitivity of the magnetic field transducer plated by a magnetic film as disclosed in the present invention is distinguishably improved from that of the conventional Hall device with applications of the flux densities respectively along the X and Y directions.
      <br/>
      Moreover, the sensitivity of the present invention is almost promoted by an order of magnitude under the application of a Z direction flux density than that of the conventional Hall device.
    </p>
    <p num="32">
      Additionally, an improved relative sensitivity is achieved by the present invention, as portrayed in FIG. 6.
      <br/>
      Also, the cross sensitivity is explicitly depressed in the magnetic field transducer according to the present invention contrary to that of the conventional Hall device, as depicted in FIG. 7.
