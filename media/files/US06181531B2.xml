      A thin film magnetic head slider has a media opposing surface which is adapted to be opposed to a recording medium, and includes a sacrificial layer, on a substratum that has a surface for forming the media opposing surface having at least one rail.
      <br/>
      A tracking mechanism or loading/unloading mechanism can be provided on the slider.
      <br/>
      An electrostatic actuator suitable for driving such a mechanism includes a stationary section having a plurality of teeth parallel to each other, a movable section having a plurality of teeth parallel to the teeth of the stationary section, a support spring for supporting the movable section so that the movable section can be moved with respect to the stationary section in the tooth width direction.
      <br/>
      A drive force generator moves the movable section to a position at which an electrostatic attraction force in the tooth width direction generated when a voltage is impresses between the teeth of the stationary section and those of the movable section, is balanced with the elastic force of the head suspension.

      Field of the Invention
    </p>
    <p num="3">The present invention relates to a thin film magnetic head slider used for a magnetic disk unit, a manufacturing method therefor and an electrostatic actuator for driving a head element thereof.</p>
    <p num="4">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
    <p num="5">
      In recent years, the magnetic disk unit has been made compact, its performance has been highly enhanced, and its cost has been reduced.
      <br/>
      In accordance with the recent tendency, it is desired to develop a thin film magnetic head of high performance and low cost.
      <br/>
      In order to meet the demand, a horizontal magnetic head (planar magnetic head) is proposed, in which a thin film pattern surface is arranged in parallel with an air bearing surface.
      <br/>
      The reason is described as follows.
      <br/>
      In the case of a horizontal magnetic head, it is easy to form floating rails having specific shapes.
      <br/>
      Therefore, it is possible to realize a magnetic head capable of flying stably close to the disc surface, and further it is easy to reduce the portion to be machined in the manufacturing process, so that the cost can be lowered.
    </p>
    <p num="6">Examples of the conventional horizontal magnetic head slider are shown in the following publications.</p>
    <p num="7">
      IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON MAGNETICS, vol 25, p.3190, 1989, "A New Thin Film Head Generation" by J. P.Lazzari and P.Deroux-Dauphin.
      <br/>
      In this conventional example, a recess is formed on the surface of a silicon substrate by means of etching, and a magnetic head element is formed in the recess.
      <br/>
      In this case, the silicon substrate surface is used as an air bearing surface opposed to a recording medium.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the terminal of the magnetic head is introduced onto the back of the slider.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, a through-hole penetrating the silicon substrate is formed so as to extend from the terminal.
      <br/>
      In this example, the slider body is manufactured by means of machining.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON MAGNETICS, vol 25, p.3686, 1989 "A New Approach to Making Thin Film Head-Slider Devices" by Daniel W. Chapman. In this conventional example, a thin film magnetic head element is formed on the substrate from the air bearing surface side, and an insulating film is made to be flat, and then a glass substrate through which a through-hole is penetrated is subjected to bonding.
      <br/>
      In this way, the slider body is made.
      <br/>
      After that, the substrate is etched for removal, and the slider body is cut by means of machining.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      In the above conventional examples, it is necessary to provide the manufacturing processes of machining the slider body, assembling a head suspension to the slider individually, forming a through-hole penetrating the substrate, embedding a conductor in the through-hole, and bonding of a glass substrate.
      <br/>
      Accordingly the manufacturing process becomes complicated.

      <br/>
      FIG. 1(a) is a perspective view of the slider 20 before it is assembled to a head suspension 30, wherein the view is seen from the back side, that is, from the side opposite to the air bearing side.
      <br/>

      <br/>
      FIG. 1(c) is a cross-sectional view taken on line I(a)--I(a) in FIG. 1(a).
    </p>
    <p num="20">
      The slider 20 includes an air bearing surface 21 made of SiO2 or Al2 O3 and a slider body 22 made of a conductor such as Ni, wherein the slider body 22 is provided on the back of the air bearing surface 21.
      <br/>
      The slider body 22 is composed of a plurality of terminal pads 23 provided at the center and an outer periphery portion 24.
      <br/>
      The plurality of terminal pads 23 are arranged in the direction parallel to the air bearing surface.
      <br/>
      A predetermined clearance 25 is formed between the pads 23 and also between each pad 23 and the outer periphery 24.
      <br/>
      There are provided 2 sets of terminals, that is, there are provided 4 terminals.
      <br/>
      Also, there are provided 2 sets of terminal pads 23, that is, there are provided 4 terminal pads 23.
      <br/>
      In this case, one set of terminals (MR elements) are used as reading head elements, and the other set of terminals (inductive head element) are used as writing head elements.
      <br/>
      It is possible to use one set of terminals, i.e., 2 terminals, when one element is used for both the reading and the writing head element.
      <br/>
      In the clearances 25, there is provided a resin 26 such as polyimide in such a manner that the back of the air bearing surface 21 is covered with the resin.
      <br/>
      In this connection, the outer periphery 24 of the slider body 22 may be used as one of the terminal pads.
    </p>
    <p num="21">
      As shown in FIG. 1(a), the back of the slider 20 is attached to the head suspension 30.
      <br/>
      As shown in FIG. 1(b), on the air bearing surface 21 of the slider 20, there are provided two side rails 27 approximately parallel with the disk rotating direction B, one central rail 28 disposed at the center on the leading side, and one thin film head 29.
      <br/>
      At the leading ends of the side rails 27 and the central rail 28, there are formed tapered portions 27a and 28a, respectively.
    </p>
    <p num="22">
      The slider 20 has a substantially rectangular shape when it is seen from a side of the media opposing surface or the air bearing surface and the substantially rectangular shape has respective corners each chamfered or rounded.
      <br/>
      The length of the slider 20 along a moving direction of the recording medium is about 0.8 mm or below 0.8 mm.
    </p>
    <p num="23">
      In FIG. 2, there is shown a variation of the thin film magnetic head slider.
      <br/>
      In the embodiment shown in FIGS. 1(a) to 1(c), the conductor of the outer periphery 24 of the slider body 22 surrounds the pads 23.
      <br/>
      On the other hand, in this variation, a framework of the main body 22 of the slider 20 is composed of a conductor, and terminal pads 23 are arranged outside the framework.
      <br/>
      As described above, it is possible to arrange the terminal pads 23 at arbitrary positions in the slider 20.
      <br/>
      In accordance with the shapes of the floating rails 27, 28 (shown in FIG. 1(b)), it is possible to arbitrarily change the shape of the slider body 22 so that the rigidity can be maintained.
    </p>
    <p num="24">
      FIG. 3 is a view showing a connection between the slider 20 and the head suspension 30.
      <br/>
      In this embodiment, there is provided a bonding metal 31 on the back of the terminal pads 23 and the outer periphery 24 of the main body of the slider 20.
      <br/>
      By means of thermo-compression bonding, ultrasonic-compression bonding (C) or bonding by conductive adhesive, the pads 23 and the outer periphery 24 of the main body are subjected to bonding with the head suspension 30 on which a terminal conductive section 32 is formed.
      <br/>
      In this case, the terminal pads 23 are electrically and mechanically connected with the head suspension 30, and the outer periphery 24 of the slider body is mechanically connected with the head suspension 30.
      <br/>
      When the outer periphery 24 of the slider body is also used as one of the terminal pads, all the connecting sections are electrically and mechanically connected.
    </p>
    <p num="25">
      FIG. 4 is a view showing another embodiment of the connecting method for connecting the slider 20 with the head suspension 30.
      <br/>
      In this embodiment, the slider 20 and the head suspension 30 are subjected to adhesion or compression bonding, and the terminal pad 23 is connected with the conductive portion 33 provided on the back face of the head suspension 30 through a wire 34 by means of bonding or soldering.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, a lead wire (not shown in the drawing) disposed along the head suspension 30 may be directly connected with the terminal pad 23.
    </p>
    <p num="26">
      FIGS. 5(a) to 5(e) are views showing the manufacturing process of the slider 20.
      <br/>
      These views correspond to sectional views taken on line I(a)--I(a) in FIG. 1(a).
    </p>
    <p num="27">
      First, on the surface of the Si substrate 46, shapes of the air bearing rails (both side rails and central rail) are formed from material of a sacrificial layer such as Al, Ti and Ta (shown in FIG. 5(a)).
      <br/>
      FIG. 6(a) is perspective view corresponding to FIG. 5(a).
      <br/>
      As shown in the drawing, portions on the Si substrate 46 except for the portions in which the air bearing rails are formed later are coated with the sacrificial layer made of Al.
      <br/>
      In this connection, a method of forming a tapered portion of the floating rail will be described later.
      <br/>
      Next, a sacrificial layer (Al) is formed on the overall upper surface (shown in FIG. 5(b)).
      <br/>
      Next, a recording and reproducing head element is formed, and a film of SiO2, diamond-like carbon (carbon) or Al2 O3 is formed on the air bearing surface (shown in FIG. 5(c)).
      <br/>
      In this connection, after the recording and reproducing head element has been formed and before the film is formed on the floating surface, the head element 41 is connected with the terminal pad forming portion 42 by a lead wire 43 as shown in FIG. 6(b).
      <br/>
      Next, a conductive film (not shown) used for plating is formed, and a mask (not shown) used for plating is formed from photo-resist.
      <br/>
      After that, the terminal pad 23 and the slider body 22 are formed by plating a metal such as Ni, NiFe, Au or Cu.
      <br/>
      After the completion of plating, a conductive film in a portion where there is no photo-resist and also a conductive film in a portion where there is no plating film are removed (shown in FIG. 5(d)).
      <br/>
      A film of a bonding metal 45 such as Au is formed on the terminal pad 23 and on the back side of the slider body 22, and then resin 26 such as polyimide is provided between the terminal pad 23 and the slider body 22 (shown in FIG. 5(e)).
      <br/>
      In this connection, an inorganic material such as diamond-like carbon or SiO2 may be provided between the terminal pad 23 and the slider body 22.
      <br/>
      After that, the slider 20 is connected with the head suspension 30 by means of bonding and the sacrificial layer or both the sacrificial layer and substrate are etched so that the slider 20 is separated from the substrate 46 made of Si.
      <br/>
      In this connection, the slider 20 may, of course, be connected with the head suspension 30 after the slider 20 has been separated from the substrate 46.
    </p>
    <p num="28">
      FIGS. 7(a) to 7(c) are views showing a method of assembling the slider 20 of the present invention and the head suspension 30.
      <br/>
      After sliders 20 have been formed on a substrate 46, this substrate 46 is cut to a block 47 including a plurality of sliders 20.
      <br/>
      Then a connection frame 48 in which a plurality of head suspensions 30 are connected in a comb-like fashion are simultaneously subjected to bonding onto the slider block 47 (shown in FIG. 7(a)).
      <br/>
      After that, the substrate 46 is separated from the slider block 47 by means of etching (shown in FIG. 7(b)).
      <br/>
      Then each head suspension 30 is cut away from the connection frame 48 (shown in FIG. 7(c)).
      <br/>
      In this way, manufacture of the slider 20 of the invention is completed.
    </p>
    <p num="29">
      FIGS. 8(a) to 8(d) are views showing a method of forming a tapered portion of the air bearing rail.
      <br/>
      According to this method, a sacrificial layer 51 (A1) is formed on a Si substrate 46.
      <br/>
      Then a photo-resist 52 is coated on the sacrificial layer 51 and exposed.
      <br/>
      In this case, exposure is made in such a manner that a quantity of exposure to the tapered portion is to be smaller than that of other portions and gradually reduced (shown in FIG. 8(a)).
      <br/>
      This method is commonly used as a method of forming a photo-resist pattern as a three-dimensional shape.
      <br/>
      For example, this method is described in Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 61-107514 or the following documents.

      As shown in the cross-sectional view of FIG. 10(c), the element drive mechanism of the second embodiment, that is, the tracking mechanism 120 of the second embodiment utilizes an electrostatic attraction force.

      A movable component includes two parallel springs 121 (only one of them is shown in the drawing) extending from the stationary portion, and two element mount portions 122 supported at the ends of the parallel springs 121.

      <br/>
      The reason why the above arrangement is adopted is to prevent dust being attracted to the head element 124 by the applied voltage between the electrodes 121 and 123, so that an air bearing force of the slider 110 is not affected by the drive portion.

      When the drive section 120 is assembled into the air bearing rail 115 as shown in this embodiment, an area of the portion where the terminal pads 118 are disposed can be increased, and further the slider can be made compact.

      The reason is described as follows.
      <br/>
      Even if the slider is deformed by the residual stress generated on each layer in the case of formation of the slider body and the air bearing surface, since there are three points at which a air bearing force is generated and therefore the drive mechanism and the head element can be arranged inside the triangle, they are seldom affected by the fluctuation of a quantity of fly, so that the flying operation can be stabilized.

      FIGS. 14(a) and 14(b) are schematic illustrations in which the principle of the electrostatic actuator used for the drive mechanism of the present invention is compared with the principle of the electrostatic actuator used for the drive mechanism in the prior art.
      <br/>
      One of the two opposed comb-shaped electrodes is a stationary section 131, and the other is a movable section 132.
      <br/>
      When a voltage is applied between the two comb-shaped electrodes, the movable section 132 is moved by a minute distance with respect to the stationary section 131.
      <br/>
      This type of electrostatic actuator is made as follows.
      <br/>
      For example, on a silicon substrate on which a thermally oxidized film is coated, there are provided a film of Si3 N4 used as an insulating layer, a PSG (phosphosilicate glass) film used as a sacrificial layer, and a film of polysilicon of 2  MU m thickness used as a comb-shaped electrode.
      <br/>
      The polysilicon film is subjected to plasma-etching, so that the polysilicon film is formed into a predetermined shape.
      <br/>
      Finally, the sacrificial layer is removed by means of wet-etching, to obtain the movable section 132.
    </p>
    <p num="46">
      In the electrostatic actuator of the prior art shown in FIG. 14(a), a tooth on the movable section 132 is disposed at an intermediate position between two adjacent teeth on the stationary section 131, and a voltage is applied between the two opposed comb-shaped electrodes, and a force is generated in a direction so that the engaging length of the comb-shaped electrodes can be increased.
      <br/>
      On the other hand, in the electrostatic actuator of the present invention shown in FIG. 14(b), a tooth on the movable section 132 side is disposed at a position deviating from the intermediate position between two adjacent teeth on the stationary section 131, so that a force is generated in a direction perpendicular to the tooth length.
      <br/>
      A difference between the electrostatic actuator of the prior art and that of the present invention will be described as follows.
    </p>
    <p num="47">
      In the electrostatic actuator of the prior art, the tooth on the movable section 132 is disposed at an intermediate position between two adjacent teeth on the stationary section 131, and a force is generated in the horizontal direction (X-direction) in the figure.
      <br/>
      The intensity Fx of the force generated in the X-direction is expressed by the equation Fx =V2 EPSILON 0 t/g, wherein g is a clearance between the tooth in the stationary section 131 and the tooth in the movable section 132, t is a thickness of the tooth, V is a voltage to be applied, and  EPSILON 0 is a dielectric constant in vacuum.
    </p>
    <p num="48">
      On the other hand, in the electrostatic actuator of the present invention, concerning a clearance formed between the tooth on the stationary section 131 and the tooth on the movable section 132, there are provided two types of clearances.
      <br/>
      One is a narrow clearance g1, and the other is a wide clearance g2.
      <br/>
      Therefore, it is possible to use a difference between a force in the Y-direction (the direction perpendicular to the tooth length) generated in clearance g1 and a force in the Y-direction generated in clearance g2.
      <br/>
      In this case, the intensity of the force Fy=(1/2)V2 EPSILON 0 tL(1/g12 -1/g22).
      <br/>
      When g1=g and 1/g22 &lt;&lt;1/g12, the representation of Fy/Fx=L/2g is satisfied.
      <br/>
      In the case of L&gt;2g, the electrostatic actuator of the present invention generates a higher force than the electrostatic actuator of the prior art.
      <br/>
      For example, when the gap is formed so as to be g=1  MU m and the tooth is formed so as to be L=200  MU m, a force, the intensity of which is 100 times as high as that of the electrostatic actuator of the prior art, can be generated.
      <br/>
      Since a force generated in g2 acts in a direction to cancel a force generated in g1 Accordingly, it is preferable that g2 is higher than g1.
      <br/>
      However, when g2 is excessively high, the number of teeth formed in a predetermined space is limited.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, there is an optimum value with respect to the value of g2/g1.
      <br/>
      In the case where L is sufficiently higher than g1, g2 and w, the relation between the force (Fy) and g2/g1 is expressed as shown in FIG. 15. Since the number of teeth is an integer, the graph is not smooth unless the value of L is sufficiently high.
      <br/>
      Even in this case, when 2&lt;g2/g1&lt;3, the force becomes a maximum.
      <br/>
      It is practical to use the range of 1.5&lt;g2/g1&lt;5 or 1.2&lt;g2/g1&lt;10.

      FIG. 16 is a view showing a variation of the electrostatic actuator of the present invention.

      The outer frame is a body of the stationary section 131 formed by means of plating of Ni.
      <br/>
      The stationary section 131 is fixed onto a substrate not shown in the figure.
      <br/>
      On the inner wall of the stationary section 131, there are provided parallel teeth 131a at regular intervals which are arranged toward the inner circumference, wherein the parallel teeth 131a are formed by means of plating of Ni simultaneously with the stationary section 131.
      <br/>
      These teeth 131a may be fixed onto the substrate, or alternatively these teeth 131a may be provided under the condition that a clearance (not shown) is formed between the substrate and the teeth.
      <br/>
      A central portion disposed inside the frame of the stationary section 131 is a movable section 132 body formed by means of plating of Ni simultaneously with the stationary section 131 body.
      <br/>
      There is a clearance between the movable section 132 body and the substrate, so that the movable section 132 can be relatively moved with respect to the stationary section 131.
      <br/>
      In the movable section 132, there are provided a plurality of teeth 132a which are arranged in parallel with the teeth 131a provided in the stationary section 131, wherein the teeth 132a are disposed at the positions which deviate from the centers of the adjacent teeth 131a.
      <br/>
      In the figure, there are provided anchors 133 fixed onto the substrate in the upper and lower portions of the movable section 132.
      <br/>
      Between the anchor 133 and the movable section 132, there is provided a support spring 134 capable of moving the movable portion 132 only in the upward and downward direction.
      <br/>
      In the right lower portion of the stationary section 131, there is provided a lead 135 to be connected with a terminal (not shown).
      <br/>
      At the lower support, there is provided a lead 136 to be connected with a terminal (not shown).
      <br/>
      These leads are formed by means of plating with Ni.
    </p>
    <p num="50">
      When a voltage is applied between the two leads 135, 136, an electrostatic attraction force is generated between the teeth 131a of the stationary section 131 and the teeth 132a of the movable section 132.
      <br/>
      Due to the above attraction force, the movable section 132 is attracted upward and moved to a position where the attraction force and an elastic restoring force of the support spring 134 are balanced.
      <br/>
      Since the electrostatic attraction force is proportional to the square of an electric potential difference, the movable portion 132 is moved in the same direction irrespective of the polarity.
      <br/>
      However, in order to prevent the influence of noise which tends to affect an object to be mounted on the movable section 132 (in the present invention, the thin film magnetic head), it is preferable that the movable section 132 is electrically grounded.
    </p>
    <p num="51">
      In this connection, in order to prevent the occurrence of a short-circuit between the teeth 131a of the stationary section 131 and the teeth 132a of the movable section 132 in the case of an excessively high voltage input, there. is provided a stopper 137 which is formed in such a manner that a clearance between a portion of the anchor 133 and the movable section 132 is reduced.
      <br/>
      The electric potential of the stopper 137, that is, the electric potential of the anchor 133 is the same as that of the movable section 132 which is electrically grounded.
      <br/>
      Therefore, no problems are caused even when the stopper 137 comes into contact with the movable section 132.

      (d) All of the surface is subjected to ion-milling, so that the portion of the seed layer not coated with platted Ni is removed.

      Difference between this embodiment and the embodiment shown in FIG. 16 is that first teeth 131a and second teeth 131b of the stationary section 131 are provided on both sides of teeth 132a of the movable section 132 at regular intervals.
      <br/>
      The first teeth 131a and the second teeth 132b of the stationary section 131 are electrically insulated from each other by the insulating layer 138 shown in the figure.
      <br/>
      Therefore, it is possible to apply different voltages upon the first teeth 131a and the second teeth 132b of the stationary section 131, respectively.
      <br/>
      When a voltage is applied upon the first teeth 131a of the stationary section 131 under the condition that the movable section 132 is electrically grounded, the movable section 132 is moved upward in the drawing.
      <br/>
      When a voltage is applied upon the second teeth 131b of the stationary section 131, the movable section 132 is moved downward in the figure.
      <br/>
      Due to the structure of this embodiment, the movable section 132 can be moved upward and downward in the figure.

      The method described above is advantageous in that the unit can be driven only by a single power source and the unit can be driven under the condition that the movable section is electrically grounded.

      Concerning a preferable example to which the electrostatic actuator of the present invention is applied, the electrostatic actuator of the present invention may be assembled into a drive section of the tracking mechanism or the loading/unloading mechanism of the head slider of the magnetic disk unit.
      <br/>
      An example of the head slider is shown in FIG. 21. This slider 110 is manufactured in such a manner that the horizontal type thin film magnetic head element 124, the air bearing surface layer 111 and the slider body 112 are made in a series of processes and bonded to the head suspension 130.
      <br/>
      In the magnetic disk unit, a seeking and positioning operation of the head suspension on which the head slider 110 is mounted is conducted by a voice coil motor.
      <br/>
      In addition to that, a minute actuator (in this embodiment, a tracking mechanism) is mounted on the head slider and the thin film magnetic head element 124 is controlled in a high frequency band range, so that the accuracy of positioning can be increased and the density of recording can be enhanced.
    </p>
    <p num="70">
      According to the present invention, in order to reduce the process of machining for the reduction of manufacturing cost, as described later, the horizontal head (planar head) 124 and the air bearing surface layer (SiO2) 111 are formed on the substrate on the sacrificial layer, and after the slider body 112 has been formed by means of plating of Ni, the sacrificial layer is removed so that the slider 110 is separated from the substrate.
      <br/>
      Further, according to the present invention, there is provided a drive mechanism 120 of the electrostatic actuator for minutely driving the element portion 124 in the tracking direction in the head slider 110.
    </p>
    <p num="71">
      FIG. 22 is a cross-sectional view showing the sectional structure of the head slider 110 of the invention.
      <br/>
      On the substrate 140, there is provided a sacrificial layer 141 made of Al, the shape of which conforms to the shape of the air bearing surface.
      <br/>
      A horizontal head element 124 is formed on the sacrificial layer 141.
      <br/>
      After that, a film of SiO2 which will become an air bearing surface layer 111 is formed.
      <br/>
      This surface works an air bearing surface to the recording medium (not shown in the drawing).
      <br/>
      In FIG. 22, the layers indicated at 142 includes: a head element, a conductive pattern layer (Au) for connecting each portion of the electrostatic actuator with each terminal, an insulating layer (SiO2), and a seed layer (Ni) of plating of Ni.
      <br/>
      A movable section 143 of the electrostatic actuator, a stationary section 144 and a support spring are formed above the layer 142 by means of plating together with the slider body 112 and the terminal 118.
      <br/>
      After that, plating may be additionally conducted to increase the rigidity of the slider body except for the movable section 143 of the actuator.
      <br/>
      Then, a bonding layer 145 of Au is formed on the uppermost layer, and it is bonded to the head suspension 130 as shown in FIG. 21. When the sacrificial layer 141 is dissolved in a solution of KOH, the head slider 110 is separated from the substrate 140.
    </p>
    <p num="72">
      The voltage of the reproducing signal of the magnetic disk device is in the order of mV.
      <br/>
      On the other hand, a voltage for driving the electrostatic actuator is several tens of volts.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, there is a possibility that the reproducing signal is affected when the actuator is driven.
      <br/>
      However, according to the present invention, the movable section 143 on which the head element 124 is mounted is electrically grounded as described before.
      <br/>
      Further, a signal conductor for transmitting a signal from the head element 124 to the terminal 118 can be arranged through the conductive pattern provided below the movable section 143 through the insulating layer and also arranged along the support spring 134 (shown in FIGS. 16 and 19) connecting the movable section 143 of the actuator with the stationary section 144.
      <br/>
      Since the support spring 134 is also grounded, the signal conductor is shielded, so that the signal is seldom affected by the noise.
    </p>
    <p num="73">
      According to the electrostatic actuator of the present invention, it is possible to obtain a force to move the movable section in the direction of tooth width.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the force generation efficiency of the electrostatic actuator of the invention is higher than the force generation efficiency of the electrostatic actuator of the prior art.
      <br/>
      When this actuator is mounted on the head slider, the head slider and the electrostatic actuator can be integrated into one body.
      <br/>
      In the process of manufacture, it is not necessary to conduct machining.
      <br/>
      It is possible to provide a precise head slider capable of positioning the head, to sub-micron accuracies over a stroke of 1  MU m.

      FIGS. 23 to 26 are views showing an embodiment of the head slider into which an electrostatic actuator capable of acting in both directions of tracking and loading/unloading is assembled.

      These views are shown enlarged in the thickness direction for convenience.
      <br/>
      FIG. 23 is a perspective view of the slider, wherein the view is seen from the air bearing surface side.

    <p num="75">In these views, reference numeral 110 is a head slider, reference numeral 111 is an air bearing surface layer (SiO2) opposed to a recording medium; 112, a slider body (Ni); 115, a side rail (pressure generating pad); 117, a central rail (pressure generating pad); 118, terminals; 151, a stationary section; 152, a movable section in which a head element is provided; 153, a stopper; 154, a support spring for supporting the movable section 152; 155, an insulating layer, 156, an electrode; 157, a protrusion provided on the side rail 115 and the central rail 117 wherein the protrusion protrudes toward the recording medium side; and 158, a surface protective layer (DLC).</p>
    <p num="76">
      In this embodiment, the movable section 152 is disposed inside a triangle composed of three pressure generating pads 115, 117.
      <br/>
      The movable section 152 is supported by the support spring 154 so that the movable section 152 can be moved in the transverse direction X (the tracking direction) with respect to the stationary section 151 and so that the movable section 152 can be moved in the upward and downward direction Z (the loading/unloading direction).
      <br/>
      In the same manner as the embodiment shown in FIG. 16, the stationary section 151 and the movable section 152 respectively include a plurality of parallel teeth 151a and 152a.
      <br/>
      The teeth 152a of the movable section are disposed at positions which deviate from the centers of the adjacent two teeth 151a of the stationary section.
      <br/>
      When a voltage is applied between the movable and the stationary section (the movable section 152 is grounded), the movable section 152 is moved with respect to the stationary section 151 in the direction of X to a position at which the electrostatic attraction force and a elastic force of the support spring 154 are balanced.
    </p>
    <p num="77">
      As shown in FIG. 24, the head element 152b provided on the movable section 152 is exposed so as to be opposed to a surface of the recording medium (not shown).
      <br/>
      On the other hand, an actuator which includes a portion of the movable section 152 other than the head element 152b, the stationary section 151 and the support spring 154 is covered by a cover portion 151b of the slider body.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the actuator is prevented from being exposed to the surface of the recording medium.
      <br/>
      Thus, the actuator is prevented from being unexpectedly contact with the recording medium.
    </p>
    <p num="78">
      When a voltage is applied upon the electrode 156 provided in the stationary section opposed to a flat portion of the movable section, the movable section 152 is moved by a minute distance in the direction of Z by an electrostatic attraction force acting on the movable section 152, resisting a force of the support spring 154.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, the head suspension 154 also supports the movable section 152 so that the movable section can be moved in the direction Z.
    </p>
    <p num="79">
      In this connection, in the embodiment shown in FIG. 25, the protrusions 157 are composed of surface lubricating material, such as, diamond-like-carbon (DLC), so that the lubricating property between the head slider 110 and the recording medium can be enhanced.
      <br/>
      In the embodiment shown in FIG. 26, the protrusions 157 are formed as portions of the floating surface layer 111 (SiO2), and the entire air bearing surface layer 111 containing these protrusions 157 is covered with the surface lubricating layer 158 (DLC).

    <p num="80">
      As shown in FIG. 23, in this embodiment, the shape of he slider body is formed into a polygonal prism which includes obtuse angle portions.
      <br/>
      The purpose is the reduction of weight by removing unnecessary portions from both sides of the central pressure generating pad provided in a rectangular parallelepiped body.
      <br/>
      When the unnecessary portions are removed from both sides of the central pressure generating pad, the possibility of collision of the head slider with the recording medium can be reduced in the case of rolling or pitching of the head slider.
      <br/>
      Further, when the outer circumferences of the slider and the pressure generating pads are chamfered, the recording medium is seldom damaged even in the case of collision of the head slider with the recording medium.
      <br/>
      In this case, the chamfered face is not limited to an R-face (rounded surface).
      <br/>
      When the chamfered face is formed into a C-face (tapered surface), similar effect can be provided.

      When the head slider of the present invention is manufactured, it is not necessary to conduct machining.
      <br/>
      The head slider of the present invention is manufactured by the process based on photolithography.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, it is possible to form the aforementioned complicated shape without increasing the time and cost necessary for fabrication.

    <p num="82">
      This is an embodiment in which the tracking actuator, the loading/unloading direction driving actuator and the read/write head (inductive head) are mounted on the head slider.
      <br/>
      Two electrostatic actuators require three terminals while the movable sections are maintained at a common electric potential, that is, the movable sections are grounded, and the head requires two terminals.
      <br/>
      In this embodiment, the electric potential of the movable section of the actuator is maintained at the same electric potential as that of the slider body, so that the slider body is used as one terminal, and the movable section is connected to the conductive pattern on the head suspension together with the 4 terminals shown in the drawing.

      In the preferred embodiment, as shown in FIG. 23, the head slider 110 has a substantially polygonal shape such that the leading end thereof is provided at the respective sides with tapered or obtuse angle portions, i.e., the width of the head slider 110 in the horizontal surface is gradually reduced toward the leading end.
      <br/>
      Thus, the head slider 110 is prevented from being contact with the recording medium (not shown).
      <br/>
      However, such obtuse angle portions can be provided at any other portions of the head slider 110 depending upon the arrangement of the protrusions 157.
      <br/>
      For instance, if a head slider 110 had two side rails 115 at the leading ends and a single central rail 117 at the trailing end, the tapered or obtuse angle portions would be provided at the respective sides of the trailing end.

      FIGS. 27(a) to 27(d) are views showing an embodiment of the head slider in which piezoelectric material is used for the drive section.

      The head drive section 120 is attached in the form of a beam so that the head 124 attached to the end (the head mount section 122) can be supported.
      <br/>
      A thin piezoelectric film made of ZnO or PZT is deposited on the beam.
      <br/>
      Therefore, when the piezoelectric film is displaced by a minute distance, the head can be moved.

      In this case, the head drive section 120 is not exposed onto the air bearing surface, that is, the head drive section 120 is disposed on an upper surface side of the air bearing section.

    <p num="86">
      Next, the drive section 120 to move the head will be explained.

      FIG. 27(d) is an enlarged cross-sectional view showing the beam of the drive section 120.

      Reference numeral 161 is a sacrificial layer (Al) to be removed in the successive process; 162, a carbon film; 163, a head wiring; 164, a shield; 165, a lower electrode of piezoelectricity; 166, a ZnO layer used for a piezoelectric thin film; 167, a SiO2 layer; 168, an upper electrode of piezoelectricity, and 169, an upper protective layer (SiO2).
    </p>
    <p num="88">
      As shown in the drawing, the upper electrode 168 is divided into two portions 168a, 168b with respect to the center.
      <br/>
      Under the condition that the lower piezoelectric electrode 165 is grounded, when voltage, the phases of which are reverse to each other, is applied upon one electrode 168a and the other electrode 168b, respectively, minute displacements, the phases of which are reverse to each other, are generated in the right and left of the beam.
      <br/>
      Due to the foregoing, the head 124 is displaced by a minute distance in the direction of an arrow in FIG. 27(b).
    </p>
    <p num="89">
      It is possible to use PZT for the piezoelectric thin film 166, although, in this embodiment, a film of ZnO is used.
      <br/>
      Advantages provided by the ZnO film are described as follows.
    </p>
    <p num="90">(1) It is possible to form a stable film of the orientation by means of sputtering.</p>
    <p num="91">
      (2) As compared with PZT, it is possible to form a film at a low temperature.
      <br/>
      In the case of PZT, the film annealing temperature is 600 (degree)  C., and in the case of ZnO, it is not necessary to anneal the film above 200 (degree)  C.;
    </p>
    <p num="92">(3) Therefore, unlike the case of PZT, it is not necessary to conduct the polarization processing; and</p>
    <p num="93">(4) A film of ZnO has been used for an SAW filter available on the market, and, therefore, the reliability is high.</p>
    <p num="94">Disadvantages of the ZnO film are described as follows.</p>
    <p num="95">(1) The piezoelectric constant of ZnO is lower than that of PZT; and</p>
    <p num="96">
      (2) ZnO is easily dissolved in acid or alkali.
      <br/>
      Since the thin film of ZnO is easily dissolved in acid or alkali, the following process is taken.
      <br/>
      In order to prevent the dissolution of the thin film of ZnO in the case of etching the sacrificial layer (Al) 161, as illustrated in FIG. 27(d), it is preferable to cover the ZnO film 166 with the electrode material 165 and 168 and SiO2 167.
    </p>
    <p num="97">
      FIG. 28 is a view showing another embodiment of the drive section in which piezoelectric material is used.
      <br/>
      In this embodiment, the piezoelectric thin film 166 is covered with the film 169 of SiO2 from the outside of the electrodes 165, 168.
      <br/>
      When minute pores exist on the piezoelectric thin film 166, there is a possibility of dielectric breakdown between the upper and lower electrode 165 and 168.
      <br/>
      Therefore, like the embodiment shown in FIG. 27(a) or the embodiment discussed here, it is preferable to provide a dielectric breakdown preventing film 167 made of SiO2, which is thinner than the piezoelectric film 166, on the upper or lower surface of the piezoelectric thin film 166 and inside of the electrodes 165 and 168.
    </p>
    <p num="98">
      The narrower the width of the beam of the drive section formed by the piezoelectric film 166 is, the more the displacement is increased.
      <br/>
      And, when the thickness of the thin film 166 of ZnO is small, an intensity of the electric field per supplied voltage is increased, so that the displacement is increased.
      <br/>
      However, from the viewpoint of prevention of dielectric breakdown, the maximum of the supplied voltage may be  +- 50 V.
    </p>
    <p num="99">
      Dimensions such as beam width and film thickness are related to the resonant frequency of the beam.
      <br/>
      In general, when the beam is made to be narrow or the film thickness is made to be small, the resonant frequency become low.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, the dimensions are restricted by the aforementioned displacement and the resonant frequency.
    </p>
    <p num="100">
      As a method of maintaining the stiffness of the beam in the flying direction while the displacement is maintained to be minimum, it is possible to provide a Prism-shaped support at the center of the width of the beam.
      <br/>
      Such an embodiment is shown in FIG. 29. Since the Prism-shaped support 170 is provided only at the center of the beam width, movement in the tracking direction (the direction of arrow X in FIG. 29) is relatively less blocked, although the stiffness in the floating direction (the direction of arrow Z in FIG. 29) is greatly improved.
    </p>
    <p num="101">
      In the drive section shown in FIGS. 27 to 29 in which the piezoelectric film is used, when voltage, the phases of which are reverse to each other, is applied upon the divided two upper electrodes 168a and 168b, respectively, can be conducted by displacing the head 124 in the tracking direction (X) by a minute distance.
      <br/>
      On the other hand, when voltages, the phases of which are the same, are impressed upon the divided upper electrodes 168a and 168b, it is also possible to move the head 124 in the flying direction (Z) by a minute distance.
    </p>
    <p num="102">
      FIGS. 30(a) and 30(b) are views showing a head which has been displaced in the tracking direction (X) by a minute distance.
      <br/>
      FIGS. 31(a) and 31(b) are views showing the operation principle for displacing the head in the flying direction (Z).
      <br/>
      In the case shown in FIGS. 31(a) and 31(b), the film thickness of the upper layer 171 and the film thickness of the lower layer 172 are different, wherein the ZnO thin film 166 is interposed between the upper layer 171 and the lower layer 172.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the neutral axis does not coincide with the center of the piezoelectric film on the section containing the piezoelectric film, but the neutral axis is shifted upward.
      <br/>
      When the piezoelectric film is expanded and contracted in the above structure, the beam is bent in the direction of Z, so that a predetermined displacement of the direction of Z (the loading and unloading direction) can be provided.
      <br/>
      Even if the film thickness of the upper layer 171 and the film thickness of the lower layer 172 are the same, when the Prism-shaped support is attached as shown in FIG. 29, it is possible to provide the effect of shifting the neutral axis upward.
      <br/>
      In the actual driving operation, it is preferable to conduct both the tracking correction and the loading/unloading clearance correction.
      <br/>
      It should be noted that in FIGS. 30(a), 30(b), 31(a) and 31(b), the displacement of the beam is greatly exaggerated for the convenience of explanation.
    </p>
    <p num="103">
      According to the present invention, it is possible to simplify the structure of the head slider and the manufacturing process.
      <br/>
      Further, it is possible to easily incorporate the head element into the tracking mechanism or the loading/unloading mechanism.
      <br/>
      Consequently, it is possible to provide a thin film magnetic head slider of high performance and low cost.
      <br/>
      It is also possible to enhance the density of a recording medium.
