      A substrate support platform has a substrate engaging surface which defines a first channel for introducing and distributing a thermal transfer gas to a first region of the engaging surface, and a second channel, nonintersecting with the first channel, for introducing and distributing a thermal transfer gas to a second region of the engaging surface.
      <br/>
      A gas delivery system is independently connected between a gas source and the first and second channels, for independently providing (via valved connections) a thermal transfer gas to the first and second channels, so that gas delivery may be limited to one of the channels, or gas may be delivered to both of the channels in case a substrate is placed over either or both of the associated regions.
      <br/>
      A pressure measuring device is independently coupled to each of the channels via measuring ports, permitting measurement and control of gas pressure from the gas source.

    <heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="1">This invention relates to the transfer of heat to and from generally flat articles in a vacuum or low pressure environment by means of a thin layer of gas.</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">
      An article in a vacuum or low pressure environment is generally thermally isolated from its surroundings.
      <br/>
      Even if placed on or clamped to a support surface, only a limited number of microscopic points of actual thermal contact exist between the article and the support surface.
      <br/>
      In order to improve both the effectiveness and uniformity of thermal contact, it is known technique to introduce a thin layer of heat conveying gas between the article and the support surface.
    </p>
    <p num="3">
      This technique is frequently used in the deposition by sputtering or etching of thin films on silicon, ceramic or glass substrates.
      <br/>
      In these processes, it is sometimes desired to maintain a substrate at a low temperature in spite of heat generated by the sputter deposition or etching processes.
      <br/>
      In such cases, the thin layer of the heat conveying gas is used to transfer heat from the substrate to the support platform.
      <br/>
      The support platform is then cooled with suitable cooling means.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      Alternatively, in sputtering processes, it is sometimes desired to maintain a substrate at a temperature higher than it would normally reach from the heat generated by the sputter deposition alone.
      <br/>
      In this case, the heat conveying gas film transfers heat from a support platform containing heating means to the substrate.
    </p>
    <p num="5">The same support platform may contain both cooling and heating means so that heat may be transferred either from or to a substrate as required.</p>
    <p num="6">The technique of thermally controlling a substrate by means of a heat conveying gas layer is disclosed in the following U.S. Pat. Nos.: 4,261,762, 4,457,359; 4,512,391; 4,542,298; 4,680,061; 4,743,570; 4,909,314 and 4,949,783.</p>
    <p num="7">A typical embodiment of this art is shown in FIG. 1. which is a section view through substrate and support platform and in FIG. 2 which is a plan view of the support platform surface.</p>
    <p num="8">
      A substrate 1 is placed on the engaging surface 2 of a support platform 3 which may contain cooling means 4 and heating means 5.
      <br/>
      Flange 6 and seal 7 connect the apparatus to processing chamber wall 8, providing for a vacuum or low pressure environment 9 around substrate 1 by sealing out an atmospheric environment 10 on the opposite side of plate 3.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      A heat conveying gas, such as argon or helium, is introduced through port 11 and is distributed by channel 12.
      <br/>
      Port 13 is used to measure the pressure of the heat conveying gas, which may be adjusted to approximately 10 Torr in order to provide effective thermal transfer between substrate 1 and support platform 3.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      Holding means 14, which may be a plurality of individual fingers or may be a continuous ring, retain substrate 1 against the force of the heat conveying gas pressure and maintain a close fit between substrate 1 and engaging surface 2.
      <br/>
      Because some heat conveying gas may escape in direction 15 at the perimeter 16 of substrate 1, thereby reducing gas pressure and thermal transfer, it is desirable that the gap between substrate 1 and engaging surface 2 is 0.003 or less.
    </p>
    <p num="11">In embodiments where heating means 5 are not used, a soft rubber seal may be placed near perimeter 16 to further reduce gas loss, but such seals are generally not used at elevated temperatures due to degradation of the seal material.</p>
    <p num="12">In order to maximize the area of thermal transfer between substrate 1 and support platform 3, the outermost portion 17 of gas distribution channel 12 is generally configured to conform closely to perimeter 16 of substrate 1, thus limiting the use of a particular support platform to substrates of a specific shape and size for which the support platform was constructed.</p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="13">
      In some applications, it may be desired to process substrates of different sizes.
      <br/>
      Unfortunately, the prior art configuration requires that the support platform 3 be replaced with each substrate size change.
    </p>
    <p num="14">Therefore, it is an object of this invention to provide a gas thermal transfer support platform which accommodates substrates of more than one size or shape avoiding the need for replacing the support platform.</p>
    <p num="15">It is a further object of this invention to provide a gas thermal transfer support platform which accommodates a plurality of substrates at one time.</p>
    <p num="16">In accordance with principles of the present invention, these objects are achieved by a substrate support platform having a substrate engaging surface which defines a first channel for introducing and distributing a thermal transfer gas to a first region of the engaging surface, and a second channel, nonintersecting with the first channel, for introducing and distributing a thermal transfer gas to a second region of the engaging surface.</p>
    <p num="17">In specific embodiments, a gas delivery system is independently connected between a gas source and the first and second channels, for independently providing (via valved connections) a thermal transfer gas to the first and second channels, whereby gas delivery may be limited to one of the channels, or gas may be delivered to both of the channels in case a substrate is placed over either or both of the associated regions.</p>
    <p num="18">In addition, a pressure measuring device, for measuring a gas pressure, is independently coupled to each of the channels via measuring ports, permitting measurement and control of gas pressure from the gas source.</p>
    <p num="19">
      The second channel may be nested within the first channel, such that the first region encompasses the second region.
      <br/>
      In this embodiment, a smaller substrate can be placed over the second channel, and gas can be delivered to the second channel only, to effect thermal transfer between the support platform and the smaller substrate.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, a larger substrate can be placed over the first channel and second channel, and gas may be delivered to the first channel and the second channel to effect thermal transfer between the support platform and the larger substrate.
    </p>
    <p num="20">
      In an alternative embodiment, the first and second channels are not nested in this manner, so that the first and second regions are nonoverlapping.
      <br/>
      In this embodiment, substrates may be selectively placed on the first channel and/or the second channel, and gas delivered only to the channel(s) which have a substrate placed thereon.
    </p>
    <p num="21">
      In any of these embodiments, the channels may be circular, square, or any other shape, in any combination.
      <br/>
      The regions served by the channels may be of similar shapes and sizes or different shapes and sizes.
    </p>
    <p num="22">In further embodiments, third or further nonintersecting channels may be formed on the substrate support platform to provide additional regions to which gas may be provided to thermally control substrates.</p>
    <p num="23">In further aspects, the invention features a semiconductor processing chamber incorporating the novel wafer support surface, and methods of using the wafer support surface.</p>
    <p num="24">The benefits and advantages of the invention over the prior art apparatus and methods will become more readily apparent from the description of the drawings and detailed description which follow.</p>

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF SPECIFIC EMBODIMENTS</heading>
    <p num="27">
      A first embodiment which addresses the accommodation of single substrates of varying sizes is shown in FIGS. 3 and 4.
      <br/>
      Support platform 30 is equipped with a gas inlet port 31 and distribution channel 32.
      <br/>
      The outermost portion 33 of channel 32 is sized to engage the peripheral surface 34 of a smaller substrate such as having an outer perimeter as shown at 35.
      <br/>
      Port 36 provides for measurement of the heat conveying gas pressure by pressure transducer 37.
      <br/>
      Heat conveying gas from a source passes through pressure control valve 44 is admitted through port 31 into channels 32, 33.
      <br/>
      Pressure control valve 44 is controlled by a pressure controller 47, which is responsive to pressure measurements from transducer 37.
    </p>
    <p num="28">
      Support platform 30 is also equipped with an independent gas inlet port 42 and gas distribution channel 38, with outermost portion 39 sized to engage the peripheral surface 40 of larger substrate 41 (FIG. 4).
      <br/>
      Channel 38 is connected to second gas inlet port 42.
      <br/>
      An independent pressure measurement port 43 may also be provided.
    </p>
    <p num="29">
      When used with smaller substrate as shown at 35, valve 45 is closed to prevent loss of gas through unused channels 38, 39.
      <br/>
      Valve 46 is also closed to isolate pressure transducer 37 from unused channels 38, 39 and the interior of the vacuum chamber.
      <br/>
      In this way, heat conveying gas is distributed only inside of the peripheral surface 34 of smaller substrate 35.
    </p>
    <p num="30">
      When used with larger substrate 41 (FIG. 4), valve 45 is opened, admitting heat conveying gas from the source through pressure control valve 44 to both inner channels 32, 33 and outer channels 38, 39.
      <br/>
      Valve 46, if provided, is also opened to permit measurement of gas pressure through port 43 if provided.
      <br/>
      Valve 46 and port 43 are not required, but permit a more accurate measurement of gas pressure behind larger substrate 41.
      <br/>
      With valve 45 open, heat conveying gas is distributed everywhere inside of the peripheral surface 40 of larger substrate 41.
      <br/>
      Both cooling means 4 and heating means 5 may be provided with support platform 30.
    </p>
    <p num="31">
      Within the scope of this invention, the number of independent gas distribution channels is not limited to two.
      <br/>
      A plurality of three or more concentric or otherwise nested channels may be included in a support platform to provide for processing of a plurality of substrate sizes.
    </p>
    <p num="32">
      Principles of the present invention are also not limited to use with circular substrates.
      <br/>
      FIG. 5 shows a support platform 48 with inner channels 50, 51 and outer channels 52, 53 configured for square substrates.
      <br/>
      FIG. 6 shows a support platform 49 of inner channels 54, 55 and outer channels 56, 57 for a combination of small circular and larger square substrates.
    </p>
    <p num="33">While FIG. 6 illustrates circular inner channels 54, 55 nested inside of square outer channels 56, 57, it will be understood that other arrangements of circular, square or otherwise shaped channels may be combined in a nested arrangement without departure from the principles of the present invention.</p>
    <p num="34">
      A further embodiment of this invention is particularly suited for use in the treatment of a plurality of substrates at one time.
      <br/>
      Referring to FIG. 7, a multi-substrate support platform 60 contains gas distribution channels 61, 64, 67, and 70 which are connected to inlet ports 62, 65, 68, and 71 in a manner similar to that shown in FIG. 4 so that any combination of channels may be independently activated by admission of gas from one or more sources.
      <br/>
      Similarly, ports 63, 66, 69, and 72 are independently valved to one or more pressure measuring devices.
    </p>
    <p num="35">
      Specifically, referring to FIG. 8, in one embodiment, each of inner ports 62, 65, 68 and 71 are connected via respective valves 81, 82, 83 and 84 to the source of heat conveying gas through pressure control valve 44.
      <br/>
      If a substrate is not placed over one of ports 62, 65, 68 and/or 71 during a given process step, the respective valve(s) 81, 82, 83 and/or 84 is (are) shut off for that process step.
      <br/>
      Similarly, ports 63, 66, 69 and 72 are connected to a common pressure transducer 37, via respective valves 86, 87, 88 and 89.
      <br/>
      Here again, if a substrate is not placed over one of the ports 62, 65, 68 and/or 71 during a given process step, the respective valve(s) 86, 87, 88 and/or 89 is (are) shut off for that process step.
    </p>
    <p num="36">It will be appreciated that while one gas source and one pressure measuring device are shown in FIG. 8, multiple sources or devices might be used, with or without common flow paths from one or more sources or devices to one or more channels.</p>
    <p num="37">It will further be appreciated that if support platform 60 will always be used with a full complement of substrates, then valving may be eliminated, with inlet ports 62, 65, 68 and 71 permanently connected together to a single gas source via a single valve, and with pressure measurement ports 63, 66, 69 and 72 permanently connected together and to a single pressure measurement device via a single valve.</p>
    <p num="38">Substrates may be retained to platform 60 by individual means associated with each substrate or by a common device which retains a plurality of substrates.</p>
    <p num="39">
      It will be appreciated that platform 60 may be constructed with channels to accommodate plural substrates of similar size and shape such as is illustrated in FIG. 7, or platform 60 may be constructed with channels to accommodate substrates of mixed sizes and shapes.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, nested sets of channels, similar to those shown in FIGS. 3-6, may be included to accommodate multiple substrate sizes in a single location.
    </p>
    <p num="40">
      In one particular embodiment of the invention, pressure controller 47, pressure control valve 44 and pressure transducer 37 may be components available from MKS Instruments, Inc. of Andover, Mass., as model nos. 250C-1-A, 0248A-00050RV and 626A12TBE, respectively.
      <br/>
      Isolation valves 45, 46, 81, 82, 83, 84, 86, 87, 88 and 89 may be obtained from NUPRO Co. of Willoughby, Ohio as model number SS-BNV51-C.
