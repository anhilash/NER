    <heading>TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
    <p num="2">
      The present invention relates to a novel olefin polymer, and a film or sheet of the olefin polymer.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, the present invention relates to a method for producing an olefin polymer using a catalyst for olefin polymerization, comprising a transition metal complex as one of the catalyst components.
      <br/>
      More particularly, the present invention relates to an olefin polymer having a good transparency and strength characteristics, a film or sheet of the olefin polymer, and a method for producing an olefin polymer with a catalyst for olefin polymerization, using a transition metal complex at high temperature under high pressure.
    </p>
    <p num="3">In the present invention, the olefin polymer includes a homopolymer of an olefin or a copolymer of two or more olefins.</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND ART</heading>
    <p num="4">
      An ionic polymerization method linear low-density polyethylene (LLDPE) as a copolymer of ethylene and an  ALPHA -olefin has widely been used as a film, a sheet, a hollow container and a raw material for injection molding because of its excellent mechanical strength such as impact strength, tensile strength, and environmental stress-crack resistance, etc.
      <br/>
      However, when the above LLDPE is produced by using a solid catalyst, there arises a problem of tackiness of the molded article and it was not necessarily satisfactory.
      <br/>
      To solve the problem, LLDPE using a vanadium catalyst has been studied.
      <br/>
      However, there arises a problem of coloring due to a large amount of the catalyst residue in the polymer and it was not necessarily satisfactory.
      <br/>
      To solve those problems, various metallocene catalysts have recently been developed as a homogeneous catalyst.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      As a method for industrially producing an olefin polymer at high temperature using a catalyst for olefin polymer, the following two methods are practiced at present.
      <br/>
      The first method is a method for polymerizing an olefin under the condition where a polymer is molten using a solvent such as cyclohexane, etc., which is generally referred to as a "high-temperature solution method", for example, a method for polymerizing an olefin under the condition of 120 to 250 (degree)  C. and 5 to 50 kg/cm2.
      <br/>
      The second method is a method for conducting polymerization in a state where the formed olefin polymer is molten in an olefin in a super critical fluid state at high temperature under high pressure in the absence of a solvent, which is generally referred to as a "high-pressure ionic polymerization method".
      <br/>
      These high-temperature solution polymerization method and high-pressure ionic polymerization method have advantages that a reactor is compact and replacement of a monomer can be easily performed.
    </p>
    <p num="6">For example, a method for obtaining an olefin polymer by using a metallocene catalyst under high pressure is disclosed in Japanese Patent Publication (Kohyo) No. Hei 1-503788, Japanese Patent Publication (Kokai) No. Hei 7-157508 and U.S. Pat. No. 5,408,017.</p>
    <p num="7">
      However, Japanese Patent Publication (Kohyo) No. Hei 1-503788 discloses a method for producing an olefin polymer by using a catalyst containing bis(n-butyl)cyclopentadienyl zirconium dichloride and methylaluminoxane in a high-pressure ionic polymerization method.
      <br/>
      Although the polymerization pressure is considerably high such as 1000 bar or more, the molecular weight of the resulting ethylene- ALPHA -olefin copolymer was insufficient.
      <br/>
      This method has an advantage such that an olefin polymer having a narrow molecular weight distribution and a composition distribution can be efficiently obtained and a film produced by using the olefin polymer has no feeling of tackiness, but the transparency of the film produced by using the resulting polymer is unsatisfactory.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      Furthermore, Japanese Patent Publication (Kokai) No. Hei 7-157508 discloses a method for producing an olefin polymer with a catalyst obtained by using diphenylmethylene(cyclopentadienyl)(fluorenyl)zirconium dichloride, triisobutylaluminum and N,N-dimethylaniliniumtetrakis(pentafluorophenyl)borate in a high-pressure ionic polymerization method, and U.S. Pat. No. 5,408,017 discloses a method for producing an olefin polymer with a catalyst obtained by using dimethylsilylbis(4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-indenyl)zirconium dimethyl and N,N-dimethylaniliniumtetrakis (pentafluorophenyl)borate in a high-pressure ionic polymerization method.
      <br/>
      In these polymerization methods, although the polymerization pressure is high as not less than 900 kg/cm2 and 1300 bar, respectively, the molecular weight of the ethylene- ALPHA -olefin copolymer obtained by any method was insufficient and the transparency of the film produced by using these polymers was unsatisfactory in the same manner as described above.
    </p>
    <p num="9">Japanese Patent No. 2571280 discloses an ethylene copolymer having a small Mw/Mn, narrow molecular weight, large MFR10 /MFR2 and excellent fluidity, but the transparency and tear strength of the film produced by using this ethylene copolymer were not necessarily satisfactory.</p>
    <p num="10">Japanese Patent Publication (Kohyo) No. Hei 7-500622 discloses an olefin polymer wherein the melt flow ratio, Mw/Mn, shear stress at which a gross melt fracture arises, and number of melting points are specified, but the transparency and tear strength of the film produced by using this polymer were not necessarily satisfactory.</p>
    <p num="11">It is one of features that an olefin polymer having narrow molecular weight distribution and composition distribution is obtained by using a metallocene complex as a catalyst component, but there is a problem that control of density and polymerization activity, particularly a polymerization activity at the reaction temperature which is efficient for industrial production, are insufficient.</p>
