    <p num="11">The Applicant has now found that 19-nor-pregnene derivatives which possess at least two substituents in position 1-, 2-, 1,2- and/or 6-, display a potent progestational activity while being devoid of residual androgenic activity.</p>
    <p num="12">A first aspect of this invention thus encompasses compounds having the structure represented by the following general formula (I):  (Chemical Structure image '5' not included in text)</p>
    <p num="13">
      wherein:
      <br/>
      R1, R2, R3, R4 and R6 each independently represent hydrogen or a (C1 -C6)alkyl,
      <br/>
      R5 is hydrogen, a (C1 -C6)alkyl or a --COR7 group where R7 is a (C1 -C6)alkyl,
      <br/>
      n is zero or one, and
      <br/>
      X is oxygen or a hydroxyimino group,
    </p>
    <p num="14">provided that when n=0, at least two of R1, R2, R3 and R4 are different from hydrogen and that when n=1, R3 and R4 are not simultaneously hydrogen.</p>
    <p num="15">As used herein, the term "alkyl" means a branched or linear saturated hydrocarbon radical, such as for example methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, butyl, isobutyl, t-butyl, pentyl and hexyl.</p>
    <p num="16">As used herein the group --COR7 wherein R7 is a (C1 -C6)alkyl includes, for example, acetyl, propionyl, butyryl, isobutyryl, t-butyryl, valeryl and hexanoyl, acetyl being preferred.</p>
    <p num="17">
      Preferred compounds of formula (I) are those wherein R1, R2 and R6 are hydrogen, R3 and R4 are a (C1 -C6)alkyl, R5 is a group --COR7 and n is zero, those where X is oxygen being especially preferred.
      <br/>
      Also preferred are the compounds of formula (I) wherein R1, R2, R4 and R6 are hydrogen, R3 is a (C1 -C6)alkyl, R5 is a group --COR7 and n is one.
      <br/>
      Further preferred are the compounds of formula (I) wherein R4 and R6 are hydrogen, R3 is a (C1 -C6)alkyl, R5 is a group --COR7 and n is zero.
      <br/>
      Among the latter, those where R1 is hydrogen and R2 is a (C1 -C6)alkyl and those where R1 is a (C1 -C6)alkyl and R2 is hydrogen are also preferred, those where X is oxygen being especially preferred.
    </p>
    <p num="18">According to another aspect, the invention relates to a method of preparing the compounds of formula (I): they can be made following the reaction scheme below in which R1, R2, R3, R4, R5, R6, n and X have the same meaning as set forth above.  (Chemical Structure image '6' not included in text)   (Chemical Structure image '7' not included in text)</p>
    <p num="19">
      Compounds 5 where R3 and R4 are a (C1 -C6)alkyl can be prepared as follows: Compounds 1 are prepared using a process similar to that described in DE-A-2 148 261.
      <br/>
      In the case where R5 =--COR7, they are saponified by sodium hydroxide in a mixture of ethanol and tetrahydrofuran.
      <br/>
      Products 1 (R5 =H) are separated by precipitation in water followed by crystallization in an alcohol, preferably methanol or ethanol.
      <br/>
      Then, they are dissolved in toluene to which is added 1 to 10 molar equivalents of ethylene glycol, preferably 5 molar equivalents, triethylorthoformate and a catalytic amount of p-toluenesulfonic acid.
      <br/>
      The reaction mixture is stirred at a temperature of about 20 (degree)  C. to 80 (degree)  C., preferably 40 (degree)  C. for about 2 to 8 hours.
      <br/>
      The reaction mixture is cooled and poured into iced water and extracted with a suitable organic solvent.
      <br/>
      The residue obtained after evaporation of the solvent can be purified by crystallization or by flash-chromatography to yield the compounds 2.
    </p>
    <p num="20">
      Treatment of compounds 2 with 3-chloroperoxybenzoic acid (MCPBA) in methylene chloride gives a mixture of 5,6-oxiranes 3 which are separated by crystallization or by flash-chromatography.
      <br/>
      Addition of an excess of R4 -magnesium-halide to the compounds 3 in tetrahydrofuran at a temperature of about 20 (degree)  C. to 60 (degree)  C. for about 8 hours, and treatment of the reaction mixture with a solution of ammonium chloride and extraction with toluene and evaporation of the solvent gives the compounds 4.
    </p>
    <p num="21">Deprotection followed by dehydration of the tertiary hydroxy group gives the compounds 5 which can be optionally esterified by known processes used for esterification in steroid chemistry or alkylated by an alkyl halide according to conventional methods of Williamson ether synthesis such as that described by B. G. Zupancic and M. Sopcic, Synthesis, 1979, 123 or by D. R. Benedict et al., Synthesis, 1979,428-9.</p>
    <p num="22">Compounds 6 where R3 is (C1 -C6)alkyl and R4 is hydrogen can be prepared as follows:</p>
    <p num="23">Compounds 6 with the 5 BETA -H configuration are obtained by hydrogenation of compounds 1 or 5 in tetrahydrofuran, acetic acid or an alcohol such as methanol, ethanol or propanol, with palladium or a palladium or platinium derivative.</p>
    <p num="24">Compounds 6 with the 5 ALPHA -H configuration can be obtained by chemical reduction of compounds 1 or 5 with sodium dithionite using a procedure described by F.

      One specific pharmacological test has been standardized in vivo for the detection and quantitation of pseudogestagenic activity since the mid-30's: it is based on the property of the uterus of estrogen-primed immature female rabbits to respond to very slight amounts of progestin by a typical endometrial transformation into a densely packed and interlaced epithelial network called "dentelle".
      <br/>
      The original test schedule, which includes 6 days of estrogen priming (total subcutaneous dose of 30  MU g/rabbit of oestradiol benzoate) followed by 5 days of progestational treatment, was designed as early as 1930 by C. Clauberg, Zentr.
      <br/>
      Gynakol. 1930, 54, 2757-2770.
      <br/>
      The semi-quantitative scale used to grade the intensity of the microscopical appearance of the dentelle was set up by M. K. McPhail, J. Physiol (London), 1934, 83, 145-156.
      <br/>
      This overall Clauberg-McPhail procedure has been extensively used to screen steroids for putative progestational activity in vivo and is still part of the basic hormonal profile of any new progestin such as norgestimate (A Phillips et al., Contraception, 1987, 36, 181-192), or desogestrel (J.
      <br/>
      Van der Vies and J. De Visser, Arzneim.
      <br/>
      Forsch/Drug Res., 1983, 33, 231-236).
      <br/>
      The progestational potency is inversely related to the dose needed to induce a half-maximal stimulation of the dentelle, i.e. to record a mean McPhail grade equal to 2.
      <br/>
      This ED50 is deduced from the dose-response curve and expressed in total dose/rabbit/5 days.
      <br/>
      All compounds were tested only following oral administration by gavage, in suspension in a carboxy-methylcellulose solution.
      <br/>
      The maximal dose administered was 1 mg, roughly corresponding to 5 times the ED50 of nomegestrol acetate, a potent orally active 19-norprogesterone-derived progestin (J.

      The residual androgenic potential is an important feature to be evaluated for any new progestin, because it is highly predictive of androgenic side-effects in women.
      <br/>
      One pharmacological model of androgenic activity has been standardized to screen steroids or related compounds in immature castrated male rats, using the hypertrophy of the vental prostate and of the seminal vesicle as the endpoint, following 10 daily administrations (R. I. Dorfman, in Methods in Hormone Research, volume 2, London, Academic Press, 1962: 275-313; A. G. Hilgar and D. J. Hummel, Androgenic and Myogenic Endocrine Bioassay Data, U.S. Department of Health, Education and Welfare, Washington D.C., 1964).
