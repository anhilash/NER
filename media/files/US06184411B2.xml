    <p num="1">This application claims the benefit under 35 USC 119(e) of U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/073,402, filed Feb. 2, 1998.</p>
    <p num="2">This invention pertains to an improved process for the removal of residual tin catalyst from substituted higher aliphatic esters of hydroxyhydrocinnamic acids made by the tin catalyzed transesterification reaction between the corresponding lower alkyl ester and higher alkanol.</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="3">
      The aliphatic esters and polyesters of substituted sterically hindered hydroxy-hydrocinnamic acid are well-known as effective antioxidants for a wide variety of organic materials protecting them from oxidative and thermal degradation.
      <br/>
      Many of these esters have gained wide commercial acceptance as phenolic antioxidants.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      An important known class of transesterification catalysts which may be used to prepare the above compounds include tin catalysts, particularly organotin catalysts.
      <br/>
      For example, U.S. Pat. No. 4,594,444 teaches a process for the preparation of sterically hindered hydroxyphenylcarboxylic acid esters by the transesterification of the corresponding methyl or ethyl ester with a higher aliphatic alcohol using an oxide or an organometallic compound of a metal of the fourth main group or subgroup of the periodic table as catalyst in an amount between 0.05 and 1.0 mol percent based on the methyl or ethyl ester.
      <br/>
      Higher dialkyltin oxides, particularly dibutyltin oxides, are taught as the preferred catalysts for this process.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      However, as recognized in the art of antioxidants, if the amount of tin residue in the product is too high, the ultimate product stability may be compromised.
      <br/>
      Care is therefore taken to remove such residues.
      <br/>
      Unfortunately, one or more of the following disadvantages are commonly associated with known methods for removing tin residue from substituted hydroxyphenylcarboxylic acid esters: product degradation and/or color formation; additional processing steps (including, for example, crystallization or adsorption techniques) which inevitably result in yield loss and increased waste generation; and increased expense due to the need for rather sophisticated equipment which may be required for the separation of product from residual tin catalyst.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      Japanese Hei 01 316389 (Takee et al.) provides for the removal of organotin compounds from general ester exchange reactions by making the organotin compounds insoluble in organic media with the use of aqueous carboxylic acid solutions.
      <br/>
      In particular, the Japanese reference requires the use of an organic solvent to make the carboxylic acid derivative of the tin compound insoluble in the ester mixture, which technique increases equipment requirements as well as waste generation.
      <br/>
      The Japanese reference further requires use of an aqueous solution of a carboxylic acid.
      <br/>
      Unfortunately, the presence of a large amount of water leads to the formation of the undesirable toxic by-product, 3-(3,5-di-tert-butyl4-hydroxy)hydrocinnamic acid (HCA), the presence of which becomes problematic for the instant hydrohydroxycinnamate esters when employed in food contact applications.
      <br/>
      The reference further teaches the added step of using auxiliary filter aids, such as cellulose or activated charcoal, which are needed in order to effectively remove the reacted tine compound.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      Clearly, need continues to exist in the industry for a simplified and improved process of removing residual tin from the substituted higher aliphatic esters of hydrohydroxycinnamic acids made by the tin catalyzed transesterification reaction between the corresponding lower alkyl ester and higher alkanol.
      <br/>
      It is the object of the present invention to satisfy this need.
    </p>
    <heading>BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="8">
      The invention is directed to an improved process for the preparation of substituted higher aliphatic esters of hydroxyhydrocinnamic acids by transesterifying the corresponding lower alkyl ester with a higher alkanol of the formula A-(OH)m in the presence of a tin catalyst.
      <br/>
      In particular, the invention provides for an improved method to remove the residual tin by reacting the tin catalyzed transesterification reaction mass with a carboxylic acid or hydrate thereof neat, in the absence of an aqueous medium, until the tin catalyst forms an insoluble derivative, and then separating the insoluble derivative from the reaction by filtration without the assistance of a filtration aid.

      wherein R is an alkyl of 1 to 4 carbon atoms, n is 0 to 2, m is 1 to 4; and when m is 1, A is a straight or branched chain alkyl of 4 to 18 carbon atoms;

    <p num="13">Preferably, the lower alkyl ester is a compound of formula (I) where m is 1 and A is methyl or ethyl, most preferably methyl.</p>
    <p num="14">Preferably, R is methyl or tert-butyl.</p>
    <p num="15">When m is 1, A is preferably alkyl of 8 to 18 carbon atoms; most preferably isooctyl, lauryl or n ocladecyl; especially nectadecyl.</p>
    <p num="16">When m is 2, A is preferably hexamethylene, --CH2 CH2 SCH2 CH2 --or --CH2 CH2 OCH2 CH2 OCH2 CH2 --.</p>
    <p num="17">When m is 3, A is preferably CH3 C(CH2 --)3, CH3 CH2 C(CH2 --)3 or glyceryl.</p>
    <p num="18">
      Both organic and inorganic tin catalysts may be employed in the transesterification reaction and removed according to the instant invention.
      <br/>
      Representative tin catalyst classes include monoalkyltin esters, dialkyltin esters, monoalkyltin oxides, dialkyltin oxides, tin tetrachlorides, monoalkyltin trichloride, dialkyltin dichloride, diaryltin dichlorides, organotin sulfides, organotin sulfates, organotin mercaptans, organotin carboxylic acid or esters thereof, and stannoxanes.
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      Preferred tin catalysts include monobutyltin tris(2-ethylhexoate), dibutyltin bis(2-ethylhexoate), stannous bis(2-ethylhexoate), dibutyltin diacetate, dibutyltin oxide, butyltin trichloride, butyltin trimethylate, dibutyltin dichloride, and diphenyltin dichloride.
      <br/>
      In particular, FASCAT.RTM. 4215A organotin catalyst, of proprietary structure belonging to the stannoxane family and containing 18.5-20.5% tin is preferred.
      <br/>
      FASCAT.RTM. 4215A organotin catalyst is available in an aromatic hydrocarbon solution from Elf Atochem, headquartered in Philadelphia, Pa.
      <br/>
      Other particularly preferred catalysts are monobutyltin tris(2-ethylhexoate) and stannous bis(2-ethylhexoate), both available from Elf Atochem under the names FASCAT (tm)  9102/4102 and FASCAT (tm)  2003, respectively.
    </p>
    <p num="20">
      The transesterification reaction may be one which is known in the literature.
      <br/>
      For example, U.S. Pat. No. 4,594,444 teaches a process for the preparation of sterically hindered hydroxyphenylcarboxylic acid esters by the transesterification of the corresponding methyl or ethyl ester with a higher aliphatic alcohol using an oxide or an organometallic compound of a metal of the fourth main group or subgroup of the periodic table as catalyst in an amount between 0.05 and 1.0 mol percent based on the methyl or ethyl ester.
      <br/>
      Higher dialkyltin oxides, particularly dibutyltin oxides, are taught as the preferred catalyst for this process.
    </p>
    <p num="21">The instant process has been found to be particularly effective under conditions where the transesterification reaction proceeds neat in the absence of solvent and where the amount of tin catalyst is minimized, i.e., on the order of about 50 to about 120 ppm tin, based on the starting lower alkyl ester, at a temperature of 150-200 (degree)  C.</p>
    <p num="22">
      In general, the carboxylic acid compounds that react with the tin transesterification catalyst to produce the insoluble derivatives include aliphatic, aromatic, heteroaromatic carboxylic acids of the mono-, di-, tri- and polycarboxylic acid type.
      <br/>
      Hydrates of these acids are also useful.
      <br/>
      Preferred carboxylic acids are those of the di-, tri- and polycarboxylic acid type (for example, ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA)); and more preferably, are those of the dicarboxylic acid type such as oxalic acid, citric aid, maleic acid, malic acid, ascorbic acid, adipic acid and the like, and hydrates thereof.
      <br/>
      Most preferably, the carboxylic acid is oxalic acid dihydrate.
      <br/>
      Hereinafter, the reaction between the tin compound and the carboxylic acid compound will be termed the "tin removal" reaction.
    </p>
    <p num="23">
      In general, about 20 moles to about 1 mole of carboxylic acid are used for each mole of tin compound.
      <br/>
      Preferably, about 10 moles to about 1 mole of carboxylic acid are used for each mole of tin compound.
      <br/>
      Most preferably, about 5 moles to about 1 mole of carboxylic acid are used for each mole of tin compound.
    </p>
    <p num="24">
      The tin removal reaction may take place at atmospheric pressure or under reduced pressure.
      <br/>
      Preferably, the reaction proceeds at a reduced pressure of between about 250 to about 1 mm of Hg, more preferably, at a reduced pressure of between about 50 to about 1 mm Hg.
      <br/>
      Most preferably, the reaction proceeds at a reduced pressure of between about 10 to about 1 mm Hg.
    </p>
    <p num="25">
      In general, the tin removal reaction takes place at a temperature above the melting point, but below the decomposition temperature, of the carboxylic acid used.
      <br/>
      Preferably, the reaction takes place between at least about 100 (degree)  C. and about 230 (degree)  C., more preferably between about 110 (degree)  C. and about 190 (degree)  C., most preferably between about 110 (degree)  C. and about 160 (degree)  C.
    </p>
    <p num="26">
      The tin removal reaction proceeds until the tin transesterification catalyst forms an insoluble derivative.
      <br/>
      In general, the reaction proceeds at a temperature of about 110 to about 130 (degree)  C. for at least about two hours, preferably about one hour.
      <br/>
      Most preferably, the reaction proceeds for at least about 0.5 hours.
    </p>
    <p num="27">
      Upon completion of the reaction, the reaction mass is filtered at a temperature of about 110 to about 130 (degree)  C. under pressure using a filter of suitable porosity.
      <br/>
      A filter on the order of about 0.5 micron porosity has been found to be particularly effective.
      <br/>
      The filtration should take place at a temperature whereby the compound of formula (I) is rendered molten or at least with a viscosity low enough to be filterable so that the insoluble tin compound is easily separated therefrom.
    </p>
    <p num="28">
      It is important to note that that tin compounds are effective catalysts in reactions that produce various compounds other than those of the instant invention.
      <br/>
      Examples include, but are not limited to, transesterification reactions resulting in 3-(2H-benzotriazol-2-yl)-5-(1,1-dimethylethyl)-4-hydroxybenzenepropanoic acid, octyl esters and 3-(2H-benzotriazol-2-yl)-5-(1,1-dimethylethyl)4-hydroxybenzenepropanoic acid, poly(ethylenedioxy) esters; transesterification of acrylates; esterification resulting in the production of plasticizers like dioctyl phthalate, synthetic lubricants, and fatty acid esters; production of polyester resins; and epoxy acid reactions.
      <br/>
      It is herein contemplated that the instant tin removal reaction may be useful in removing tin from any reaction mass or product where residual tin may be undesirable.
