      Technical Field
    </p>
    <p num="2">
      The present invention relates to data processing systems and, in particular, to electrophotographic reproduction devices.
      <br/>
      Still more particularly, the present invention relates to the adjustment of the timing of a scanning laser beam with respect to a second scanning laser beam in an electrophotographic reproduction device utilizing a plurality of scanning laser beams in order to adjust the timing of a plurality of PEL clocks.
    </p>
    <p num="3">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
    <p num="4">
      Electrophotographic reproduction devices can generally be divided into copiers or printers.
      <br/>
      The present invention relates primarily to printers.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      In an electrophotographic printer, a charged photoconductor is selectively discharged by the operation of a print or imaging station, to provide an electrostatic latent image on the photoconductor's surface.
      <br/>
      This latent image corresponds to the visual image that is to be printed, first by applying toner to the photoconductor, and then by transferring the toner image to the surface of substrate material such as a sheet of plain paper.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      Electrophotographic reproduction devices may be constructed to apply toner to either the photoconductor's discharged area, or to the photoconductor's charged area.
      <br/>
      The former type of device is called a discharged area developing device, whereas the latter device is called a charged area developing device.
    </p>
    <p num="7">The broad spirit and scope of the invention are not to be limited to a scanning light beam since, as will be appreciated by those of skill in the art, such a scanning beam generally comprises a moving point or spot of light, that can be modulated in intensity--for example, on and off, to form an electrostatic latent image on the photoconductor.</p>
    <p num="8">Thus, the term, scanning laser beam, as used herein, is intended to mean any moving point of light to which the photoconductor is sensitive, and which operates to sequentially print the small picture elements, or PELs, of one or more image rows, as the point of light sequentially scans the photoconductor, image row after image row.</p>
    <p num="9">
      In printers of this type, the image to be printed comprises an electronic image signal that may, for example, reside in the page memory of a data processing system.
      <br/>
      In this page memory, each photoconductor PEL area that is to be discharged may, again by way of example, be represented by a binary "1", in which case each PEL this is to be left in its charged state would be represented by a binary "0".
      <br/>
      As the spot of light moves across a photoconductor PEL row, the row content of the page memory signal is gated utilizing a PEL clock to control or modulate the spot of light in accurate synchronism with the position of the moving spot of light.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      The art has recognized the need to synchronize the gating of the print data signal to laser beam modulator means as a function of the beam's position prior to each photoconductor scan.
      <br/>
      For example, it is known to use a photosensor that is located on an image plane that is established by the physical location of the photoconductor.
      <br/>
      As a result of the detection of the laser beam at this start of scan position, a timing pulse, or beam detection indicator, is generated to start the flow of print data to a beam modulator.
    </p>
    <p num="11">
      Imaging stations used in electrophotographic printers often utilize more than one scanning laser beam.
      <br/>
      In systems utilizing two beams, for example, each beam scans a different PEL row approximately concurrently so that two PEL rows are simultaneously scanned.
      <br/>
      Therefore, two beam detection indicators are generated, one for each beam.
      <br/>
      A fixed time offset between a first pel of a first beam and a first pel of a second beam may be equivalent to an offset of several tens of pels on order to avoid interference between the adjacent beams.
    </p>
    <p num="12">Therefore a need exists for a method and system in an electrophotographic reproduction devices which utilizes a plurality of scanning laser beams for adjusting the timing of a first scanning laser beam with respect to a second scanning laser beam, and therefore the timing of a plurality of PEL clocks, so that the associated PELs are approximately aligned.</p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="13">It is therefore one object of the present invention to provide an improved data processing system.</p>
    <p num="14">It is another object of the present invention to provide an improved electrophotographic reproduction device.</p>
    <p num="15">It is yet another object of the present invention to provide a method and system in an electrophotographic reproduction devices which utilizes a plurality of scanning laser beams for the adjustment of the timing of a first scanning laser beam utilizing a first PEL clock with respect to a second scanning laser beam utilizing a second PEL clock.</p>
    <p num="16">
      The foregoing objects are achieved as is now described.
      <br/>
      A method and system are disclosed for the modification of the timing of one of a plurality of PEL clocks included within an electrophotographic device.
      <br/>
      A first indicator is generated which is associated with a first position on a print receiving material.
      <br/>
      A second indicator is generated which is associated with a second position on the print receiving material.
      <br/>
      A first enable signal is generated for initiating a first scan.
      <br/>
      The first scan is executed utilizing a first laser beam synchronized by a first PEL clock.
      <br/>
      A second enable signal is generated for initiating a second scan.
      <br/>
      The second scan is executed utilizing a second laser beam synchronized by a second PEL clock.
      <br/>
      The first and second scans are executed approximately concurrently.
      <br/>
      An offset of the second position from the first position is determined.
      <br/>
      The timing of a second PEL clock is modified by adjusting the second enable signal utilizing the offset so that the first and second positions are approximately aligned.

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF A PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading>
    <p num="19">A preferred embodiment of the present invention and its advantages are better understood by referring to FIGS. 1-5 of the drawings, like numerals being used for like and corresponding parts of the accompanying drawings.</p>
    <p num="20">
      This invention will be illustrated within the framework of electrophotographic devices wherein prints are produced by sequentially creating an image of the print subject on a photoconductor surface, developing the image with toner, transferring the toner image to print receiving material, and then fusing the toner image to the print receiving material.
      <br/>
      In most electrophotographic machines, the electrophotographic process is of the transfer type, wherein photoconductor material is placed around a rotating drum, or is arranged as a belt to be driven by a system of rollers.
      <br/>
      In a typical transfer process, photoconductor material is passed under a stationary charge generating station, to thereby place a relatively uniform electrostatic charge, usually several hundred volts, across the entirety of the photoconductor surface.
      <br/>
      Next, the photoconductor is moved to an imaging station where the photoconductor receives light rays from a light-generating source.
      <br/>
      These light rays discharge the photoconductor to relatively low levels when the light source is fully powered, while the photoconductor continues to carry high voltage levels when the light source is turned off, or when it is powered at intermediate levels, or for a relatively short time duration.
      <br/>
      In that manner, the photoconductor is caused to bear an electrostatic latent charge pattern which corresponds to the printing, shading, etc., which is desired to be printed on the receiving material.
    </p>
    <p num="21">
      Light-generating sources in an electrophotographic printer frequently comprise lasing means in which a laser beam is modulated by a character generator and a modulator to control the power or length of time that the beam exposes the photoconductor in each particular picture element (PEL) area.
      <br/>
      In a multiple beam lasing system, multiple modulating means modulates more than one beam at a time so that multiple lines or rows of PELs are written at a time.
    </p>
    <p num="22">
      After producing a latent image on the photoconductor, the latent image is moved to a developing station where developing material called toner is placed on the image.
      <br/>
      Toner is usually in the form of a colored powder which carries a charge designed to cause the powder to deposit on selected areas of the photoconductor.
    </p>
    <p num="23">The developed image is then moved from the developing station to a transfer station where copy receiving material, usually paper, is juxtaposed to the developed toner image, as a charge is placed on the backside of the paper, so that when the paper is thereafter stripped from the photoconductor, a toner image is held on the paper's surface as toner is concomitantly removed from the photoconductor.</p>
    <p num="24">The remaining electrophotographic process steps provide permanent bonding or fusing of the toner to the copy paper, and cleaning of residual toner from the photoconductor so that the photoconductor can be reused.</p>
    <p num="25">
      FIG. 1 depicts a electrophotographic printer incorporating this invention Photoconductor material 10 is placed on the surface of a drum 11 which is driven by motive means, not shown, to rotate at a substantially constant speed in the direction A. A charge generator 12 places a uniform charge of several hundred volts across the surface of photoconductor 10 at the location of charging station 13.
      <br/>
      The charged photoconductor is mounted in a dark enclosure, not shown, and thereafter rotates to the location of a printhead 14 which is comprised of a light-generating source, such as the laser beam generator shown in FIG. 2.
    </p>
    <p num="26">
      Printhead 14 selectively exposes the charged photoconductor to light as the photoconductor passes through imaging station 15.
      <br/>
      As a result, imaging station 15 operates to discharge photoconductor 10 in areas which are desired to be developed with toner (Discharged Area Development, DAD process), or to discharge the photoconductor in areas which are to remain free of toner (Charged Area Development, CAD process)
    </p>
    <p num="27">
      For a DAD process, the discharged areas of photoconductor 10 are developed at developing station 16 by developer apparatus 17 which operates to apply toner so that the photoconductor thereafter carries a visually perceptible image of the print data that previously operated to control printhead 14.
      <br/>
      In a CAD process, the charged areas are developed.
      <br/>
      In either case, the developed image now rotates to transfer station 18 whereat print paper, moving in the direction B, is juxtaposed with the surface of photoconductor 10.
      <br/>
      A charge opposite in polarity to the charge on the toner is placed on the backside of the print paper by transfer charge generator 19, such that when the paper is stripped from the surface of the photoconductor, toner is attracted to the paper and leaves the surface of photoconductor 10.
      <br/>
      Any remaining residual toner is cleaned from the photoconductor at cleaning station 20 by operation of cleaning apparatus 21.
    </p>
    <p num="28">
      The selective application of light rays to photoconductor 10 at imaging station 15 is accomplished through operation of printhead modulator means 22.
      <br/>
      For a semiconductor laser diode, printhead modulator 22 may be comprised of a power supply, which will either turn the light source on for longer or shorter periods of time to accomplish varying degrees of photoconductor discharge, in accordance with image pattern data, or modulator 22 will turn the light-generating source on to a greater or lesser illumination intensity in accordance with that data.
      <br/>
      In any event, modulation will occur in accordance with the data contained in buffer memory 23.
      <br/>
      Print data is first sent to a raster buffer 24, and then to printhead modulator 22, as is well known by those skilled in the art.
    </p>
    <p num="29">
      FIG. 2 illustrates an optical scanning system which can be used as printhead 14 of FIG. 1.
      <br/>
      In FIG. 2, a laser beam 25 is shown emanating from laser module 26.
      <br/>
      Beam passes through beam modulator 22 and then through cylindrical lens 27 for focusing the beam onto the facets 28 of a rotating polygon mirror 29.
      <br/>
      The beam is reflected from the moving mirror facets, and then through a negative spherical lens group 30, an anamorphic lens group 31, and a positive spherical lens group 32, to the surface of photoconductor 10.
      <br/>
      FIG. 2 also depicts a fold mirror 33, and exit window 34, and the length of the scan 35 across photoconductor 10.
    </p>
    <p num="30">
      A reflective surface 36 is provided to reflect light from the laser beam to a photo-detector means 37.
      <br/>
      Means 37 provides a start of scan, beam detection indicator.
    </p>
    <p num="31">
      As the laser beam traverses photoconductor scan line 35 while moving at a substantially constant speed during the formation of one PEL row of a print data image, the binary print image signal present on conductor 38 may operate to control modulator 22 to an on or off state for each image PEL that is to be printed.
      <br/>
      The phase at which modulator 22 is controlled during each scan line 35 must be such that the PELs of one scan row will align with the corresponding PELs of adjacent scan rows.
    </p>
    <p num="32">
      FIGS. 3A and 3B illustrate a pictorial representation of a print receiving material, such as paper, and two "printed" PEL rows of an image printed on a print receiving material 41, such as paper, in accordance with the method and system of the present invention.
      <br/>
      A first PEL row 40 is generated in response to a first beam detect indicator during a first scan where a first beam is synchronized by a first PEL clock.
      <br/>
      A second PEL row 42 is generated in response to a second beam detect indicator during a second scan where a second beam is synchronized by a second PEL clock.
      <br/>
      As shown in FIG. 3A, prior to adjusting the timing of the PEL clocks by adjusting the timing of the second beam with respect to the timing of the first beam, the positions of PELs 44 and 46 are not aligned.
    </p>
    <p num="33">
      In order to adjust the placement of the PELs of concurrent scans at the desired linear positional relationship with respect to each other, the timing of the second beam is adjusted with respect to the timing of the first beam.
      <br/>
      In this manner, the second scan can be adjusted, and therefore, the physical position of the PEL row may be adjusted with either a positive or negative delay, with respect to the first scan.
      <br/>
      As shown in FIG. 3B after adjusting the timing of the second beam with respect to the timing of the first beam utilizing an offset 48 of the position of one PEL from a second PEL, the positions of PELs 44 and 46 are aligned.
    </p>
    <p num="34">
      FIG. 4 is a block diagram of a circuit for generating a plurality of PEL clocks where the timing of one of the clocks is adjustable with respect to the timing of a second of the clocks in accordance with the method and system of the present invention.
      <br/>
      Printhead 14 generates a plurality of beam detect indicators, one for each beam utilized by the printer.
      <br/>
      These beam detect indicators may be included either as two separate timing pulses in a single signal, or each as a timing pulse in a separate signal.
      <br/>
      In the preferred embodiment, the two pulses are included in a single signal.
      <br/>
      A beam detect signal including the two beam detect pulses is received by a fixed delay line 50 which generates signals 51, 52, 90, and 91.
      <br/>
      Signal 51 is the beam detect signal which includes no delay.
      <br/>
      Signal 52 is the beam detect signal including preferably a 125 nsec delay.
      <br/>
      Those skilled in the art will recognize that by a selection of different circuitry components, a different delay may be utilized in order to produce the same result.
      <br/>
      Other signals having a different amount of delay may be generated from delay line 50 as needed.
    </p>
    <p num="35">
      The first beam detect signal 51 is input directly into logic means 53.
      <br/>
      The second beam detect signal 52 is delayed by programmable delay line 54.
      <br/>
      The amount of the programmable delay is determined utilizing an offset adjustment value entered by a user.
      <br/>
      Prior to initiating a print operation, a user selects an adjustment, or offset, value.
      <br/>
      The offset value's an amount by which a physical position for a first PEL in a second PEL row is offset from a physical position for a first PEL in a first PEL row as shown in FIG. 3A. The offset is the number of PELs by which the second row is offset from the first.
      <br/>
      The offset may include both an integer number of PELs as well as a fractional amount of a PEL.
      <br/>
      The programmable delay line 54 adds a delay equivalent to the fractional amount of the offset to second signal 52.
      <br/>
      A beam detect adjustment signal 55 is generated from programmable delay line 54 and is equal to signal 52 delayed a fractional PEL amount.
      <br/>
      In this manner, signal 55 is adjusted with respect to signal 51 and includes the fractional PEL offset.
    </p>
    <p num="36">
      Logic means 53 receives as an input signals 51 and 53.
      <br/>
      Logic means 53 and counting means 56 generate PEL clock enable signals 57 and 58, and signals 80 and 81.
      <br/>
      A between beam detect signal 59 is also generated by logic means 53.
      <br/>
      PEL clock enable signal 57 is associated with first PEL row 40.
      <br/>
      PEL row 40 is generated by a first scan which is synchronized by a first PEL clock 70.
      <br/>
      The first scan is initiated in response to PEL clock enable signal 57.
      <br/>
      PEL clock enable signal 58 is associated with second PEL row 42.
      <br/>
      PEL row 42 is generated by a second scan which is synchronized by a second PEL clock 72.
      <br/>
      The second scan is initiated in response to PEL clock enable signal 58.
    </p>
    <p num="37">
      PEL clock enable signal 57 is generated in accordance with the following logical equation: Signal 57=Signal 51+/Signal 52+/Signal 59.
      <br/>
      Signal 59 is generated utilizing signal 55.
      <br/>
      Signal 59 becomes a logical "1" at the falling edge of the first pulse of signal 55, and becomes a logical "0" at the falling edge of the second pulse of signal 55.
      <br/>
      PEL clock enable signal 58 is generated in accordance with the following logical equation: Signal 58=Signal 51+/Signal 55+Signal 59.
      <br/>
      In this manner, signal 58, which is associated with the second scan, is offset with respect to signal 57, which is associated with a first scan.
      <br/>
      The offset includes the fractional PEL amount.
    </p>
    <p num="38">
      Signals 70 and 72 are used to run two separate counters, 56A and 56B, that implement the full pel offset adjustment.
      <br/>
      In general, all scans are delayed by some integer number pels.
      <br/>
      If scan 2 is delayed less than scan 1, this amounts to a negative adjustment to scan 2.
      <br/>
      In the preferred embodiment, scan 1 is delayed a fixed amount of 8 pels and scan 2 delayed by 0 to 15 pels for a -8 to +7 pel adjustment window.
      <br/>
      This saves register space and logic in a two beam implementation, but a more general implementation would make all delays adjustable.
      <br/>
      As each counter reaches its target count, it outputs a START signal 80, 81 that is synchronous with the adjusted pel clock The START signals are reset during the first 25 nsec of signal 51.

    <p num="39">
      Signals 57 and 58 are received by phase-locked-loop means 60 and 62, respectively.
      <br/>
      Frequency oscillator 64 provides an input to both PLLs 60 and 62.
      <br/>
      Phase-locked-loops 60 and 62, then, act as programmable oscillators.
      <br/>
      PLL 60, then, generates PEL clock 70 in response to PEL clock enable signal 57.
      <br/>
      PLL 62 generates PEL clock 72 in response to PEL clock enable signal 58.
      <br/>
      PEL clock 72, therefore, is delayed with respect to PEL clock 70 in order to align the positions of the first PELs in PEL rows 40 and 42 as desired in accordance with the user input offset.

      Logic means 71 receives PEL clock 70 as well as signals 59, 90, and 91.

      Logic means 73 receives PEL clock 72 as well as signals 59, 90, and 91.
