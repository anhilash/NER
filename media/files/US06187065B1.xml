      A class of waxes improves the low temperature flow properties of oils.
    </p>
  </abstract>
  <description format="original" lang="en" id="desc_en">
    <p num="1">This invention relates to additives for improving the low temperature properties, particularly flow and/or filterability properties, of oils and to oil compositions exhibiting such improved properties.</p>
    <p num="2">
      Many oils, particularly those derived from petroleum sources or from animal or vegetable oils and fats, are susceptible to the formation of wax at low temperatures.
      <br/>
      This problem is well known in the art.
    </p>
    <p num="3">
      In particular, fuel oils, whether derived from petroleum or from animal or vegetable sources, contain components that at low temperature tend to precipitate as large crystals or spherulites of wax in such a way as to form a gel structure which causes the fuel to lose its ability to flow.
      <br/>
      The lowest temperature at which the oil will still flow is known as the pour point.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      As the temperature of fuel oils fall and approach the pour point, difficulties arise in transporting the fuel through lines and pumps.
      <br/>
      Further, the wax crystals tend to plug fuel lines, screens, and filters at temperatures above the pour point.
      <br/>
      These fuel problems are well recognised in the art, and various additives have been proposed, many of which are in commercial use, for depressing the pour point of fuel oils.
      <br/>
      Similarly, other additives have been proposed and are in commercial use for reducing the size and changing the shape of the wax crystals that do form.
      <br/>
      Smaller size crystals are desirable since they are less likely to clog a filter.
      <br/>
      The wax from a diesel fuel, which is primarily an n-alkane wax, crystallises as platelets; certain additives, usually referred to as cold flow improves, inhibit this, causing the wax to adopt an acicular habit, the resulting needles being more likely to pass through a filter than platelets.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      A further problem encountered at temperatures low enough for wax to form in a fuel is the settlement of the wax to the lower region of any storage vessel.
      <br/>
      This has two effects; one in the vessel itself where the settled layer of wax may block an outlet at the lower end, and the second in subsequent use of the fuel.
      <br/>
      The composition of the wax-rich portion of fuel will differ from that of the remainder, and will have poorer low temperature properties than that of the homogeneous fuel from which it is derived.

      A wide variety of petroleum waxes have been produced commercially and such waxes differ in the relative proportions of different hydrocarbon components, a result of differences both in petroleum source materials and in the separation and processing techniques employed to obtain a particular wax.

      Waxes have conventionally been defined by reference to their gross physical characteristics, in view of the large and varied number of hydrocarbon components which they contain, and the difficulties in separating such closely-homologous hydrocarbon molecules. "Industrial waxes" by H. Bennett and published in 1975 describes the different types of petroleum wax and indicates that the characteristics of melting point and refractive index have proved useful in classifying the variety of waxes available from different sources.
      <br/>
      According to this invention, a certain sub-class of waxes--namely those having certain defined ranges of melting point and refractive index are particularly effective for improving the low temperature flow properties of oils, and especially fuel oils such as middle distillate fuel oils.
      <br/>
      Whilst not wishing to be bound by any particular theory, it is postulated that waxes within this sub-class possess a combination of components which interact very favourably with precipitating n-alkanes present within the oil and with any further low temperature flow improver also present in the oil, such that the detrimental effects of the precipitated wax inherent in the fuel are reduced or even prevented.

    <p num="34">
      These may comprise a copolymer of ethylene with an ethylenically unsaturated ester, or derivatives thereof.
      <br/>
      An example is a copolymer of ethylene with an ester of an unsaturated carboxylic acid such as ethylene-acrylates (e.g. ethylene-2-ethylhexylacrylate), but the ester is preferably one of an unsaturated alcohol with a saturated carboxylic acid such as described in GB-A-1,263,152.

      An ethylene-vinyl ester copolymer is advantageous; an ethylene-vinyl acetate, ethylene vinyl propionate, ethylene-vinyl hexanoate, ethylene 2-ethylhexanoate, or ethylene-vinyl octanoate copolymer or terolymer is preferred.

      <br/>
      If desired, the copolymers may be derived from additional comonomers, e.g. they may be terpolymers or tetrapolymers or higher polymers, for example where the additional comonomer is isobutylene or diisobutylene or another ester giving rise to different units of the above formula and wherein the above-mentioned mole %'s of ester relate to total ester.

    <p num="35">Also, the copolymers may additionally include small proportions of chain transfer agents and/or molecular weight modifiers (e.g. acetaldehyde or propionaldehyde) that may be used in the polymerisation process to make the copolymer.</p>
    <p num="36">

      <br/>
      Such copolymers may also be made by transesterification, or by hydrolysis and re-esterification, of an ethylene unsaturated ester copolymer to give a different ethylene unsaturated ester copolymer.
      <br/>
      For example, ethylene vinyl hexanoate and ethylene vinyl octanoate copolymers may be made in this way, e.g. from an ethylene vinyl acetate copolymer.
      <br/>
      Preferred copolymers are ethylene-vinyl acetate or -vinyl propionate copolymers, or ethylene-vinyl 2-ethyl hexanoate or -octanoate co- or terpolymers, such as ethylene-vinyl acetate-vinyl 2-ethyl hexanoate terpolymers.

      The oil may be fuel oil e.g. a hydrocarbon fuel such as a petroleum-based fuel oil for example kerosene or distillate fuel oil, suitably a middle distillate fuel oil, i.e. a fuel oil obtained in refining crude oil as the fraction between the lighter kerosene and jet fuels fraction and the heavier fuel oil fraction.
      <br/>
      Such distillate fuel oils generally boil within the range of about 100 (degree)  C. to about 500 (degree)  C., e.g. 150 (degree)  to about 400 (degree)  C., for example, those having a relatively high Final Boiling Point of above 360 (degree)  C. ASTM-D86 Middle distillates contain a spread of hydrocarbons boiling over a temperature range.
      <br/>
      They are also characterised by pour, cloud and CFPP points, as well as their initial boiling point (IBP) and final boiling point (FBP).
      <br/>
      The fuel oil can comprise atmospheric distillate or vacuum distillate, or cracked gas oil or a blend in any proportion of straight run and thermally and/or catalytically cracked distillates.
      <br/>
      The most common petroleum distillate fuels are kerosene, jet fuels, diesel fuels, heating oils and heavy fuel oils, diesel fuels and heating oils being preferred.
      <br/>
      The diesel fuel or heating oil may be a straight atmospheric distillate, or may contain minor amounts, e.g. up to 35 wt %, of vacuum gas oil or cracked gas oils or both.
    </p>
    <p num="115">
      Heating oils may be made of a blend of virgin distillate, e.g. gas oil, naphtha, etc. and cracked distillates, e.g. catalytic cycle stock.
      <br/>
      A representative specification for a diesel fuel includes a minimum flash point of 38 (degree)  C. and a 90% distillation point between 282 and 380 (degree)  C. (see ASTM Designations D-396 and D-975).
    </p>
    <p num="116">Also, the fuel oil may be an animal or vegetable oil (i.e. a `biofuel`), or a mineral oil as described above in combination with one or more animal or vegetable oils.</p>
    <p num="117">
      Biofuels, being fuels from animal or vegetable sources, are obtained from a renewable source.
      <br/>
      It has been reported that on combustion less carbon dioxide is formed than is formed by the equivalent quantity of petroleum distillate fuel, e.g. diesel fuel, and very little sulphur dioxide is formed.
      <br/>
      Certain derivatives of vegetable oil, for example rapeseed oil, e.g. those obtained by saponification and re-esterification with a monohydric alcohol, may be used as a substitute for diesel fuel.
      <br/>
      It has recently been reported that mixtures of a rapeseed ester, for example, rapeseed methyl ester (RME), with petroleum distillate fuels in ratios of, for example, between 1:99 and 10:90 by volume are commercially viable.
    </p>
    <p num="118">Thus, a biofuel is a vegetable or animal oil or both or a derivative thereof.</p>
    <p num="119">Vegetable oils are mainly tricylcerides of monocarboxylic acids, e.g. acids containing 10-25 carbon atoms and listed below  (Chemical Structure image '5' not included in text)</p>
    <p num="120">where R is an aliphatic radical of 10-25 carbon atoms which may be saturated or unsaturated.</p>
    <p num="121">Gene rally, such oils contain glycerides of a number of acids, the number and kind varying with the source vegetable of the oil.</p>
    <p num="122">
      Examples of oils are rapeseed oil, coriander oil, soyabean oil, cottonseed oil, sunflower oil, castor oil, olive oil, peanut oil, maize oil, almond oil, palm kernel oil, coconut oil, mustard seed oil, beef tallow and fish oils.
      <br/>
      Rapeseed oil, which is a mixture of fatty acids partially esterified with glycerol, is preferred as it is available in large quantities and can be obtained in a simple way by pressing from rapeseed.
    </p>
    <p num="123">
      Examples of derivatives thereof are alkyl esters, such as methyl esters, of fatty acids of the vegetable or animal oils.
      <br/>
      Such esters can be made by transesterification.
    </p>
    <p num="124">
      As lower alkyl esters of fatty acids, consideration may be given to the following, for example as commercial mixtures: the ethyl, propyl, butyl and especially methyl esters of fatty acids with 12 to 22 carbon atoms, for example of lauric acid, myristic acid, margaric acid, palmitic acid, palmitoleic acid, stearic acid, oleic acid, elaidic acid, petroselic acid, ricinoleic acid, elaeostearic acid, linoleic acid, linolenic acid, eicosanoic acid, gadoleic acid, docosanoic acid or erucic acid, which have an iodine number from 50 to 150, especially 90 to 125.
      <br/>
      Mixtures with particularly advantageous properties are those which contain mainly, i.e. to at least 50 wt % methyl esters of fatty acids with 16 to 22 carbon atoms and 1, 2 or 3 double bonds.
      <br/>
      The preferred lower alkyl esters of fatty acids are the methyl esters of oleic acid, linoleic acid, linolenic acid and erucic acid.
    </p>
    <p num="125">
      Commercial mixtures of the stated kind are obtained for example by cleavage and esterification of natural fats and oils by their transesterification with lower aliphatic alcohols.
      <br/>
      For production of lower alkyl esters of fatty acids it is advantageous to start from fats and oils with high iodine number, such as, for example, sunflower oil, rapeseed oil, coriander oil, castor oil, soyabean oil, cottonseed oil, peanut oil or beef tallow.
      <br/>
      Lower alkyl esters of fatty acids based on a new variety of rapeseed oil, the fatty acid component of which is derived to more than 80 wt % from unsaturated fatty acids with 18 carbon atoms, are preferred.
    </p>
    <p num="126">The concentration of the additive in the oil may for example be in the range of 1 to 5,000 ppm of additive (active ingredient) by weight per weight of fuel, for example 10 to 5,000 ppm such as 25 to 2500 ppm (active ingredient) by weight per weight of fuel, preferably 50 to 1000 ppm, more preferably 200 to 800 ppm.</p>
