      As an object, the present invention provides a noodle product, process for production and method for cooking, which allows the noodles to be cooked easily by heating with the use of a microwave oven, and thereby, the mouthfeel and taste of fresh noodles can be reproduced.
      <br/>
      The noodle product of the present invention comprises noodles and a container or bag containing the noodles, the container and bag being made of heat-resistant resin or aluminum and suitable for use in a microwave oven.

    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="1">
      1.
      <br/>
      Field of the Invention
    </p>
    <p num="2">The present invention relates to a process for producing noodles and a method for cooking said noodles.</p>
    <p num="3">2. Prior Art</p>
    <p num="4">
      Conventional ready-to-eat noodles include the original fried ready-to-eat noodles and the latest ready-to-eat fresh-type noodles which can be stored for a long period of time (LL noodles).
      <br/>
      However, these noodles, even those called the `fresh-type` are prepared by subjecting fresh noodles to a heat process such as boiling, steaming, frying and drying after  ALPHA -modification for long-term storage and ready-to-eat abilities.
      <br/>
      Therefore, they fail to sufficiently reproduce the mouthfeel characteristics of fresh noodles.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      Recently, microwave ovens have been popularized and used not only for thawing and heating but for cooking.
      <br/>
      Since they are convenient, that is, they require shorter period of time for cooking, they are widely utilized, particularly for cooking of a small amount of materials, heating and cooking of single meals.
      <br/>
      For noodles, they have been used only for the thawing of frozen noodles and thawing and heating of frozen or chilled chow mein.
      <br/>
      As ready-to-eat fried noodles, there have been some products to be heated with hot water added to the container in a microwave oven (DENGEKI RAMEN, manufactured by Ace-Cock Co.
      <br/>
      Ltd.), which have a mouthfeel similar to those of the aforementioned heat-processed products.
      <br/>
      Therefore, development of ready-to-eat noodles having mouthfeel characteristics of ordinary fresh noodles has been expected.
    </p>
    <p num="6">Conventionally, to meet the demand to shorten the cooking time, fresh noodle products have been produced by thinning noodle strands or by adding more water, but there have not been known examples wherein such fresh noodles are contained in a container to be served, and directly cooked in a microwave oven.</p>
    <p num="7">
      Microwave ovens have been used not only for thawing and heating but for cooking.
      <br/>
      Since they are convenient, that is, they require shorter period of time for cooking, they are widely utilized, particularly for cooking of a small amount of materials, heating and cooking a plate.
      <br/>
      To provide such a use, noodles, for example, ready-to-eat fried noodles, ready-to-eat noodles, prepared by drying after applying an  ALPHA -treatment, frozen noodles are commercially available.
      <br/>
      However, all of the noodles have been subjected to heat treatment, and there have been no fresh noodles known which are prepared without heat treatment and become edible by cooking with a microwave oven.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      On the other hand, for production of noodles, the present inventor has proposed to add wheat protein comprising gliadin as a main ingredient (for example, JP-A-6-105662 and JP-A-7-289187).
      <br/>
      However, noodles prepared by adding gliadin to ordinary flour cannot easily become edible noodles by cooking with rapid heat (for 1 to 3 minutes), which is one of the characteristics of cooking using a microwave oven.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      There are many proposals to compound modified starch (for example, JP-A-3-252147).
      <br/>
      Using a large amount of modified starch (not less than 30% by weight) attains gelatinization in a short time, but the resulting noodle strands become fragile during production and storage of the fresh noodles.
      <br/>
      To prevent such problems, there are methods wherein gluten is added, or noodle strands are allowed to become partly  ALPHA -starch by heat sterilization, to improve storage stability.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      Conventionally, for the production of noodles, the addition of oils and fats or emulsifiers has often been carried out to improve the quality of the noodles.
      <br/>
      However, there have been no examples known for that of fresh noodles to be cooked in a microwave oven.
      <br/>
      The purpose of adding oils and fats and emulsifiers is mainly to improve the moldability and stretchability of the noodles and to prevent drying.
    </p>
    <p num="11">
      Conventionally, microwave ovens have been used for thawing frozen food and heating cold food, rarely for heat-cooking.
      <br/>
      In particular, microwave ovens have been rarely used for boiling food, for example, boiling noodles.
    </p>
    <p num="12">
      In general, when noodles are boiled using pans or the like, boil-over can be prevented by controlling the heating power while monitoring the boiling conditions.
      <br/>
      However, when microwave ovens are used for such cooking, the output cannot be controlled by monitoring boiling conditions, which is one of the greatest disadvantages of microwave ovens.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, boiling noodles using a microwave oven may be accompanied with boil-over or the like, causing many problems, for example, a risk of scalding and contamination due to boil-over.
    </p>
    <p num="13">
      A seasoning for cooking in a microwave oven, "RENJI-DE-ORYORI " has been marketed from Shimaya KK.
      <br/>
      This product requires relatively large amounts of water in a bag made of a resin to boil food in a microwave oven.
      <br/>
      To prevent boil-over, the product employs a bag to maintain a big space above the surface of the hot water, the top edge of the bag being folded to prevent boil-over.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, the bag cannot be served for a meal as it is, and after cooking, another operation is required, that is, the content should be transferred to another container.
      <br/>
      Thus, such a product is disadvantageously less convenient.

      As a result, the present inventor has found that fresh noodles placed in a container or a bag suitable for use in a microwave oven is heated with hot water added thereto in a microwave oven to provide noodles retaining their original mouthfeel in a very short time, and thus the boiled noodles retain their firmness for a longer period of time, because they are heated with less penetration of hot water into the noodle strands upon heating in a microwave oven in contrast with those boiled in a pan using a gas heater, electric heater or the like wherein hot water penetrates into noodle strands.
      <br/>
      In addition, fresh noodles having a higher moisture content can be boiled in a shorter period and reproduce the taste characteristics of original fresh noodles.

      The present inventor has studied intensively to attain the above objects.
      <br/>
      As a result, we have found that compounding oils and fats and/or emulsifiers into fresh noodles will improve the rate of water-absorption into noodle strands, even upon heating using a microwave oven, which is accompanied with less water-absorption, and has attained the present invention.

    <p num="23">
      The present inventor has studied intensively to overcome the above problems.
      <br/>
      As a result, the present inventor has found that by coating an antifoamer or adhering an antifoamer-containing sheet on the lid of a container suitable for use in a microwave oven, water can be prevented from boiling over when the noodles are boiled using a microwave oven, and has attained the present invention.
      <br/>
      Further, the present inventor has also found that by providing the container with an inner lid having openings and/or slits, or providing the lid with openings and/or slits, the boil-over of water can be similarly prevented.

      The present invention further provides a process for producing a noodle product to be cooked in a microwave oven which is characterized by placing noodles into a molded container for food to be cooked in a microwave oven which has a lid with openings and/or slits.
      <br/>
      For boiled noodles, which are low foaming, a container for food to be cooked in a microwave oven is used with a lid having openings and/or slits, to secure safety without coating an antifoamer on the lid or without using an inner lid.
      <br/>
      However, by providing an inner lid with openings and/or slits, boil-over can be sufficiently prevented.
    </p>
    <p num="57">
      Further, the openings and/or slits are provided both on the lid and inner lid, and an antifoamer is coated or antifoamer-containing sheet is adhered partially or entirely on the inner surface of the lid or partially or entirely on either or both surfaces of the inner lid to sufficiently attain the object of the present invention and sufficiently prevent boil-over when fresh noodles are contained therein.
      <br/>
      The openings and slits of the present invention are different from steam ports generally provided at the engagement portion of the lid of the container of the ready-to-eat noodles and the like.
    </p>
    <p num="58">
      In the present invention, the combination of the antifoamer and the lid and/or inner lid with the openings and/or slits provides a greater boil-over prevention effect compared with that obtained when they are solely employed.
      <br/>
      Such a combination is encompassed within the present invention.
    </p>
    <p num="59">
      When noodles are placed in the container of the present invention, the present invention has a greater effect on fresh noodles.
      <br/>
      For example, fresh udon noodles, fresh Chinese noodles, fresh Japanese buckwheat noodles, fresh spaghetti, fresh pasta, etc.
      <br/>
      Further, cooked noodles prepared by, for example, boiling or steaming the aforementioned noodles, ready-to-eat noodles prepared by sterilization of boiled, steamed or fried noodles which can be stored for a long period of time or dried noodles may be contained therein.
    </p>
    <p num="60">In addition, not only the aforementioned fresh noodles but cooked noodles or ready-to-eat noodles may be boiled by heating in a microwave oven rather than using a gas heater, electric heater or the like to shorten the heating time and prevent the absorption of water into the noodle strands, thereby safely providing noodles having a suitable texture in a short period of time.</p>
    <p num="61">
      For cooking according to the method of the present invention, noodles in a microwave oven, noodles, as well as cold or hot water or soup, are placed in a container and heated.
      <br/>
      The heating time is not limited and varies depending on the temperature of the liquid to be added and type of noodles.
    </p>
    <p num="62">
      Moreover, fresh noodles can be directly placed in a container or a bag without being packaged.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, noodles may be packed in another resin bag, which is then placed in a resin bag.
      <br/>
      Preferred packaging is that which contains noodles as well as an oxygen scavenger or a sustained release alcohol preparation in a resin bag or inert gas replacement packaging or vacuum packaging, which is excellent for long-term storage of fresh noodles.
      <br/>
      Of course, when fresh noodles are directly placed in a container or a bag, an oxygen scavenger and/or a sustained release alcohol preparation may be packaged in the same container.
    </p>
    <p num="63">
      The fresh noodles used in the present invention can contain modified starch in addition to flour as powdery starting materials.
      <br/>
      Such modified starch includes, for example, potato starch, tapioca starch, sago starch, corn starch, wheat starch and rice starch subjected to a chemical modification such as esterification with an organic acid, phosphoric acid cross linking, hydroxypropylation, etherification, oxidation; processed starch subjected to a physical treatment such as  ALPHA -modification by heating or partial solation by wet heating, etc.
      <br/>
      The types and means for processing are not limited.
      <br/>
      Processed starch or modified starch which begins to gelatinize at 50 to 60 (degree)  C. is preferred.
    </p>
    <p num="64">
      When the modified starch is used as one of the ingredients in the powdery starting materials, the amount is not limited depending on the replacement amount for flour, but preferably is 15 to 50% by weight.
      <br/>
      Depending on the replacement amount, protein such as gluten, gliadin, glutenin, egg albumen, milk albumin, casein or  ALPHA -starch may be added for reinforcement of bonding.
    </p>
    <p num="65">
      Modified starch means that prepared from raw starch by a treatment such as baking (baked starch), decomposition (dextrin) or chemical modification.
      <br/>
      The treatment method and starting starch are not particularly limited as long as a modified starch having a gelatinization initiation temperature of 50 to 60 (degree)  C. is subjected to the chemical modification.
      <br/>
      For example, the starting starch includes tapioca starch, corn starch, potato starch, wheat starch.
      <br/>
      Chemical modification includes esterification with an organic acid such as acetic acid; oxidation with a hypochlorite; hydroxypropylation, etherification, etc.
      <br/>
      Hydroxypropylated starch such as tapioca starch, corn starch or wheat starch is preferred because of their lower effect on solubility and smell, as well as gelatinization temperature.
    </p>
    <p num="66">
      Gliadin is a mixture of proteins extracted from wheat gluten with 70% by volume ethanol aqueous solution.
      <br/>
      Wheat protein containing gliadin as a main ingredient used in the present invention may be extracted from raw gluten or gluten powder separated from wheat flour by any extraction method, for example, by 50 to 70 vol % aqueous ethanol solution extraction, 10 to 30 vol % aqueous isopropylalcohol solution extraction, 20 to 50 vol % aqueous acetone solution extraction, or acidic aqueous ethanol solution extraction wherein an organic acid such as lactic acid, citric acid, malic acid, acetic acid or salts thereof is added to a low concentration (5 to 20 vol %) aqueous ethanol solution to adjust pH 3.5 to 5.5.
    </p>
    <p num="67">
      According to this extraction, a dry extract containing 50 to 100% by weight of gliadin can be generally obtained.
      <br/>
      In the present invention, among them, an extract obtained by acidic aqueous ethanol solution extraction is preferred, which contains not less than 70% by weight gliadin in dry powder.

      According to the present invention, in the total powdery starting materials containing flour, buckwheat flour, starch, wheat protein containing gliadin as main ingredients, and modified starch, the modified starch is added so as to be 10 to 50% by weight.
      <br/>
      When the amount of the modified starch is less than 10% by weight, the resulting noodles disadvantageously require a long time for cooking in a microwave oven.
      <br/>
      On the other hand, when the amount exceeds 50% by weight, the resulting noodle strands become fragile, may be broken during storage and suffer a remarkable degradation in mouthfeel and flavor.
      <br/>
      The preferred amount is 20 to 50% by weight.
      <br/>
      More preferably, the amount is 30 to 50% by weight for udon noodles, which require relatively longer times for boiling, 20 to 40% by weight for Japanese buckwheat noodles and Chinese noodles, which require relatively shorter times for boiling.

      In amounts less than 0.5% by weight in the powdery starting materials, the bonding effect of noodle strands may not be expected.
      <br/>
      In amounts exceeding 5% by weight, the resulting noodles have a mouthfeel different from that of the original noodles.
      <br/>
      The preferred amount of wheat protein to be added, which contains gliadin as a main ingredient, is 1 to 4% by weight.
      <br/>
      The method for addition is not particularly limited and they may be mixed as powder with other powdery starting materials.

    <p num="71">
      In the present invention, an  ALPHA -starch is compounded in the noodle dough to assist the bonding during the production of noodles, and to increase the water to be added during production of the noodles, contributing to the reduction in time for boiling and providing more suitable noodles to be cooked in a microwave oven.
      <br/>
      The  ALPHA -starch is not limited by the starch starting material and method for bringing a starch to be an  ALPHA -starch.
      <br/>
      For example, starch starting materials include tapioca starch, corn starch, potato starch, wheat starch, etc.
      <br/>
      Methods for bringing to a starch to be an  ALPHA -starch include a method comprising simultaneously bringing a starch to be an  ALPHA -starch and drying starch sludge dispersed in water using a drum dryer; a method wherein a powdery  ALPHA -starch is directly prepared from starch using an extruder; a method wherein a solution is prepared by dispersing starch in water, heating and drying an  ALPHA -starch using a spray dryer.
      <br/>
      Preferably, an  ALPHA -starch prepared from corn starch using a drum dryer is used with respect to the workability of bringing a starch to be an  ALPHA -starch and characteristics of the starch powder (adhesiveness, etc.).
    </p>
    <p num="72">
      The amount of the  ALPHA -starch to be added is preferably 1 to 10% by weight, more preferably 1 to 6% by weight of the powdery starting materials.

      For ready-to-eat fresh noodles, keeping the quality of the fresh noodles stable during commercial activities will have a good effect on the subsequent reproduction of mouthfeel.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, the fresh noodles of the present invention are preferably compounded with one or more members selected from the group consisting of natural antibacterial ingredients, such as ethanol, protamine, polylysine, hop extracts, capsicum extracts, chitin, chitosan, wasabi extracts, lysozyme, decomposition products of pectin, bacteriocin, burned oyster- or egg-shell or bone; natural antibacterial amino acids such as glycine, alanine, threonine; natural antibacterial acids and salts thereof such as acetic acid, fumaric acid, adipic acid, lactic acid, citric acid, malic acid, phosphoric acid, tartaric acid, gluconic acid, gluconodeltalactone, succinic acid, carbonic acid and their salts with sodium, potassium, calcium and magnesium; a water activity regulator having a function of reducing water activity such as glycerol, sugar-alcohol, common salt, sugar and propylene glycol, to improve the storage stability.
    </p>
    <p num="74">The amount of the above materials to be added is not particularly limited, but, for ethanol, the preferred amount is 1 to 5% by weight of the total weight of noodles; for antibacterial ingredients, 0.01 to 2% by weight based on powder; for the water activity regulator, 0.5 to 20% by weight, based on the powdery starting materials.</p>

    <p num="76">Moreover, the aforementioned oxygen scavenger, sustained release alcohol preparation, inert gas replacement packaging, vacuum packaging or a combination thereof will further improve the storage stability.</p>
    <p num="77">
      In the present invention, the moisture content of the fresh noodles may be within that of the usual fresh noodles.
      <br/>
      Fresh noodles with a low moisture content requires a relatively longer heating time in a microwave oven.
      <br/>
      For example, when the moisture content is increased to 30 to 50% by weight, the heating time can be considerably shortened, thereby preventing the loss of firmness of the noodles upon boiling and closely reproduces the mouthfeel characteristic of fresh noodles.
      <br/>
      It is more effective to use the aforementioned modified starch as one of the powdery starting materials and to add a large amount of water.
      <br/>
      The moisture content means that of fresh noodles contained in a container.
    </p>
    <p num="78">
      Further, the fresh noodles can be prepared by compounding materials or additives which may be generally compounded in noodles.

      In the present invention, as mentioned above, the process for producing fresh noodles may be conducted according to the conventional processes.
      <br/>
      Among such fresh noodles, fresh spaghetti may be prepared by either using an extruder-type pasta-making machine or using a roll-type noodle-making machine with a round blade.
      <br/>
      Other noodles can be produced using machines conventionally used for producing noodles, for example, an atmospheric pressure kneader, a vacuum kneader, a vacuum noodle sheet-making machine, a roll-type noodle-making machine and an extruder-type noodle-making machine.
      <br/>
      A preferred machine is a combination of a vacuum kneader and a roll-type noodle-making machine, which can readily produce large amounts of water-containing noodles.
    </p>
    <p num="90">
      The noodles in the present invention include, for example, udon noodles, Japanese buckwheat noodles, Chinese noodles, etc.
      <br/>
      They are suitable as fresh noodles to be cooked in a microwave oven, by placing one or two bricks of noodles in a container suitable for use in a microwave oven, pouring cold or hot water into the container and cooking in a microwave oven.
    </p>
    <p num="91">Needless to say, fresh noodles of the present invention can be cooked in a shorter time using an ordinary gas heater compared with the ordinary fresh noodles.</p>
    <p num="92">
      The cooking process of the ready-to-eat fresh noodles of the present invention is not particularly limited.
      <br/>
      Particularly, according to the following cooking method of the present invention, cooked noodles having the excellent mouthfeel and taste characteristic of the noodles can be prepared by a simple method.
      <br/>
      That is, the aforementioned ready-to-eat fresh noodles in a container or a bag having hot water added thereto are heated in a microwave oven.
      <br/>
      Using hot water, the noodles can be cooked in a shorter period of time, producing different moisture distribution on the surface and inside of the noodle strands, reproducing the mouthfeel characteristic of noodles.
      <br/>
      That is, in the cooking method of the present invention, the noodle strands and water are simultaneously heated and boiled, in contrast with the method utilizing a gas heater, electric heater or the like, wherein the noodles are heated by hot water penetrating the noodle strands.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the noodles can be boiled while controlling the water absorption of the noodle strands.
      <br/>
      Especially, for Chinese noodles, the original mouthfeel (texture) can be attained.
      <br/>
      Thus, the mouthfeel characteristic of the noodles can be sufficiently reproduced.
    </p>
    <p num="93">
      For cooking methods using a microwave oven, for example, 250 g to 300 g of hot water is poured into a portion of fresh noodles for one person, (that is, 100 to 150 g).
      <br/>
      Using a generally popularized microwave oven with an output of 500 W, for Japanese buckwheat noodles and Chinese noodles, which require shorter times for boiling, hot water (950 (degree)  C. or above) is poured into a container in which noodles have been placed, the container is covered with a lid, and heated in a microwave oven for 60 to 90 seconds, then concentrated soup was added thereto.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, hot water is removed, then fresh hot water and concentrated soup base are added.
      <br/>
      For udon noodles, which require relatively longer times for boiling, hot water is added to the container having noodles, the container is covered with a lid, then heated in a microwave oven for 60 to 90 seconds, and left to stand for 60 to 120 seconds.
      <br/>
      Subsequently concentrated soup base is added.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, hot water is once removed and fresh hot water is added with the concentrated soup base, then heated again in a microwave oven for 60 to 90 seconds.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, cold water can be used instead of hot water.
      <br/>
      In this case, the heating time becomes slightly longer.
    </p>
    <p num="94">
      As the method of cooking fresh noodles obtained by the present invention using generally popularized 500 W microwave ovens, conditions may vary whether fresh noodles are added to cold water or hot water (850 (degree)  C. or higher) before heating.

      Further, when udon noodles or spaghetti, which requires relatively longer times for boiling, are boiled using hot water, hot water is poured in the container in which noodles have been placed, the container is covered with a lid, heated in a microwave oven for about 60 seconds, left to stand for about 60 seconds, then hot water is removed and concentrated sauce is added thereto.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, concentrated soup is added without removal of hot water, or fresh hot water as well as concentrated soup are added at the same time and heated again in a microwave oven for about 60 seconds.

      Pour about 300 ml of hot water at 80 to 100 (degree)  C. into the container, put a lid on and, after heating in a microwave oven (output 500 W) for 60 seconds (when hot water of 95 (degree)  C. or higher is used), add the concentrated soup base and ingredients to the container containing said noodles.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, drain off the hot water contained in the container, then add concentrated soup base and ingredients and pour about 300 ml of hot water again to prepare the ready-to-eat product.
      <br/>
      Hot water to be poured and heated in a microwave oven should be at a high temperature, preferably not lower than 95 (degree)  C. to prevent a reduction of temperature due to the difference in temperature between the hot water and fresh noodles, resulting in a reduction of heating time.
      <br/>
      Using an aluminum container, the aforementioned heating time in a microwave oven should be about 90 seconds.

    <p num="101">
      Further, the aforementioned water to be added is partially substituted with ethanol (2 to 3% by weight) to improve the storage stability of fresh Chinese noodles (at 10 to 15 (degree)  C.) by 2 to 3 times (3 to 4 weeks) compared with that of noodles without adding ethanol.
      <br/>
      Further, the kneading of natural antibacterial ingredients such as protamine, glycine, chitin, chitosan and water activity regulator into noodles, combined with a package containing an oxygen scavenger or a sustained release alcohol preparation will extend the storage period (one month or more) at ordinary temperature (20 to 30 (degree)  C.).
