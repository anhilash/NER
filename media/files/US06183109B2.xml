    <heading>TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
    <p num="1">
      The present invention relates to decorative moldings such as those used as front edges on worktops.
      <br/>
      The present invention has further relation to removable moldings provided with integral illumination.
    </p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">
      Moldings are typically made of wood, plastic, metal or the like, and are decorative in nature.
      <br/>
      Moldings are usually made of one type of material, but specialty moldings exist that are made up of a combination of materials, such as wood and metal for example.
      <br/>
      Various types of moldings and their construction are well known to those skilled in the art.
    </p>
    <p num="3">
      Lighting is typically installed in the home, office, etc. in a way that is completely unrelated to moldings used in the same areas.
      <br/>
      Lighting usually hangs from the ceiling, is mounted to the walls, or sits on desk and tabletops.
      <br/>
      Nightlights are employed in a similar fashion, or are plugged into electrical outlets in the walls.
      <br/>
      In offices or businesses, repeating message boards, such as those that report stock market figures, are usually hung on the walls.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      There exists a need then for a molding that incorporates illumination as part of the molding, and a molding with an integral illumination member.
      <br/>
      There also exists a need for an illuminated molding that may serve as a nightlight, mood lighting, or the like.
      <br/>
      There exists a need for an illuminated worktop front edge molding to serve such purposes.
      <br/>
      There also exists a need for an easy way to install such molding that is within the realm of the skill of the average consumer.
      <br/>
      The objects of the present invention are to fill these unmet needs, and these and other objects of the invention will become apparent through the specification, claims, and drawings provided herein.
    </p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="5">
      Disclosed is a molding with a built-in illumination member.
      <br/>
      The illumination member may be an ordinary light or series of lights, or a repeating message board made of light emitting diodes, or a compound that glows under ultraviolet light, or a compound that glows in the dark, or the like.
      <br/>
      If required, the illuminating member may be energized by an alternating current power source, or by a direct current power source.
      <br/>
      The illuminating member may also include an on/off switch.
      <br/>
      The molding may be worktop front edge molding that is removably attached to a worktop.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      Also disclosed is a method of illuminating a front edge of a worktop comprising the steps of providing a front edge molding having a built-in illumination member, removably attaching the front edge molding to the worktop, and coupling the illumination member to a power source.
      <br/>
      The method may also include the step of coupling an on/off switch between the power source and the illumination member.

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading>
    <p num="8">
      A detailed embodiment of the present invention is now disclosed.
      <br/>
      It should be understood, however, that the disclosed embodiment is merely exemplary of the invention, which may be embodied in various forms.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the details disclosed herein are not to be interpreted as limiting, but merely as the basis for the claims and as a basis for teaching one skilled in the art how to make and/or use the invention.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      FIG. 1 shows a front view of an illuminated molding 10 in accordance with the present invention.
      <br/>
      As will be described in greater detail below, the illuminating member 12 is centrally inserted into the body 14 of molding 10.
      <br/>
      Illuminating member 12 may include a series of lights 16, which may be incandescent lights, light emitting diodes, or the like.
      <br/>
      The illuminating member 12 may be a repeating message board to provide not only light, but also information, to people who view the molding.
      <br/>
      Illuminating member 12 may also be a compound that glows under ultraviolet light, or a compound that glows in the dark, or the like.
      <br/>
      If required, the illuminating member 12 may be energized by an alternating current power source, or by a direct current power source.
      <br/>
      The illuminating member 12 may also include an on/off switch (not shown) coupled between the power source and the illuminating member 12, and installed at some point in the surface of molding 10 for easy access by a user.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      FIGS. 2A, 2B, and 2C show various embodiments of the present invention simply to show that various molding shapes may be employed.
      <br/>
      The present discussion will revolve around the embodiment shown in FIG. 2A. Body 14A includes hollowed-out area 18.
      <br/>
      Grooves 20 are cut into body 14A by traditional methods known in the art.
      <br/>
      Illuminating member plate 22 is sized to slide comfortably into grooves 20.
      <br/>
      Lights 16A may be attached at fixed intervals to plate 22, for example as shown in FIG. 1.
      <br/>
      Couplings 24 provide electrical contact among lights 16A within a member 10A and terminate is a connection to a power source (not shown).
      <br/>
      Alternatively, a glow in the dark or glow under ultraviolet light compound may be coated onto the front surface of plate 22 so as to provide illumination with no need for a power source.
      <br/>
      Additionally, plate 22 may be a translucent, decorative front cover strip which houses and encloses a light source mounted in area 18 behind plate 22.
    </p>
    <p num="11">
      FIG. 3 shows the typical component parts of a worktop associated with the present invention.
      <br/>
      FIG. 3 shows a backsplash 26, a surface member 28, and a front edge molding 10 in accordance with the present invention.
      <br/>
      These components are constructed of typical decorative surfacing materials known in the art, such as high pressure decorative laminate, solid surfacing, solid surfacing veneer, natural and artificial stone compositions, and the like.
      <br/>
      These materials may or may not require use of a substrate in conjunction with the decorative layer; such substrates known to the art are fiberboard, particleboard, foamed polymers, wood, and the like.
    </p>
    <p num="12">
      Each of components 11, 26, and 28 may be supplied in a variety of different colors, materials, surface textures, etc., backsplash 26 and front edge 10 may be supplied in various profile configurations, and the components may be supplied in a variety of lengths.
      <br/>
      Of course, a ten foot long molding 10 would be required for a ten foot long worktop, etc.
    </p>
    <p num="13">
      The components may then be removably attached together with any removable attachment means known to the art.
      <br/>
      The removability of attachment means allows easy installation, repair, and replacement of molding 10.
      <br/>
      An exemplary attachment means is a centric sphere connector, described in detail below, and supplied by Hafele America Co., of Archdale, N.C. Other such removable attachment means known in the art include nuts and bolts, screws, and the like.
    </p>
    <p num="14">
      Typical use of centric sphere connectors in the present invention would include fixing pins 30 into at least front edge molding 10 as shown in FIGS. 3 through 6, and providing vertical cavities 32 and horizontal cavities 34 in surface member 28.
      <br/>
      The locations of pins 30 and cavities 32 and 34, and the size of cavities 32 and 34, must be accurate per the hardware supplier's instructions to insure proper and secure attachment of the components.
      <br/>
      Referring now to FIGS. 5 and 6, pins 30 are inserted into cavities 34 such that their heads 36 are approximately centrally located within cavities 32.
      <br/>
      This allows insertion of locking cams 38 into cavities 32 over heads 36.
      <br/>
      Referring to FIG. 7A, locking cam 38 is provided with a vertical opening that allows it to slide over and encompass head 36.
      <br/>
      Cam 38 is also provided with a horizontal opening around a portion of its circumference.
      <br/>
      Referring to FIG. 7B, this horizontal opening allows cam 38, when rotated to the lock position, to grab onto pin 30 and put it into a state of tension.
      <br/>
      This causes front edge molding 10 to be tightly secured to surface member 28.
      <br/>
      The positioning of pins 30 and cavities 32 and 34 along the length of the components must be precise and frequent enough to insure accurate and quality assembly of the components.
    </p>
    <p num="15">Referring now to FIG. 8, one set of cavities 32 and 34 along the length of molding 10 and surface member 28 may be provided as a channel through which electrical connection 40 may be fed for coupling to a power source.</p>
    <p num="16">
      FIG. 9 shows finished end 42 of a worktop including molding 10.
      <br/>
      End 42 is typically covered with a piece of HPDL, or other decorative surfacing material, cut to fit the shape of end 42.
      <br/>
      Because backsplash 26 would generally not be readily removable, the piece of HPDL covering end 42 may include integral coverage for backsplash 26 and surface member 28.
      <br/>
      Front edge molding end 44, however, would need to be covered with a separate piece of HPDL, or other material, so as to facilitate any subsequent removal of molding 10.
      <br/>
      Because front edge molding 10 is removably attached to surface member 28, front edge molding 10 may be easily installed, repaired, or replaced as necessary.
    </p>
