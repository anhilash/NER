    <heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">
      The present invention relates to the improvement of seed proteins.
      <br/>
      More particularly, the invention is directed to a lysine-rich protein isolated from winged bean (WBLRP), its associated nucleic acids and their uses, for example, as expressed in transgenic plants to improve their nutritional qualities.
    </p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="3">
      Plants are the primary source of all protein consumed by humans and livestock.
      <br/>
      In 1990, the world protein supply was 150 million tons, of which 65% was obtained directly from plants and 35% through animal protein production.
      <br/>
      In comparison to meat, plant protein is much more economical to produce, store, and transport.
      <br/>
      However, when used as a source of dietary protein for human and monogastric animals, most plant proteins are nutritionally incomplete due to their deficiency in several essential amino acids.
      <br/>
      In general, cereal (e.g., corn, wheat) proteins are low in lysine (Lys) and tryptophan (Trp), while legume (e.g., soybean) and most vegetable proteins are deficient in the sulfur amino acids, methionine (Met) and cysteine (Cys).
      <br/>
      See, e.g., Sun and Larkins, in Transgenic Plants, vol. 1, King and Wu, Ed. at p. 317 (1992).
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      To overcome amino acid deficiencies, a mixed diet of cereal and legume, or supplementing plant proteins with meat products or synthetic essential amino acids, typically is employed. U.S. growers annually spend over $120 million and $70 million, respectively, on synthetic Met and Lys to supplement the corn and/or soy protein base of swine and poultry diets.
      <br/>
      In view of such economic factors, a more direct and cost-efficient means of supplying these amino acids in livestock feed would be highly desirable.
      <br/>
      See, e.g., Beach et al., in Biosynthesis and Molecular Requlation of Amino Acids in Plants, Singh et al., Eds., at p. 229 (1992).
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      Plant geneticists and breeders have made significant efforts in the past to improve the quality of seed proteins and have developed, e.g., mutant high-lysine corn and barley.
      <br/>
      However, efforts in breeding legumes containing protein with increased levels of sulfur amino acids have not met with significant success.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      Various genetic approaches to the selection or engineering of plant improvements include the selection of cultivars with high levels of desired amino acids, modification of amino acid biosynthesis, and modification of existing proteins.
      <br/>
      Unfortunately, there often are undesirable traits associated with such modified plants, such as lower yields and greater susceptibility to pests and diseases, and these traits have prevented the agronomic utilization of the plants.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      With respect to the selection of high seed protein soybean cultivars, Serretti et al., Crop Sci. 34:207-209 (1994) compared the protein and amino acid content of several soybean lines.
      <br/>
      Similarly, Zarkadas et al., J. Agric Food Chem. 41:6161-623 (1993), compared the total protein amino acids and 4-hydroxyproline-rich glycoproteins of a widely-grown soybean cultivar and a high-protein genotype.
      <br/>
      In one case, however, a high-lysine protein in barley was found to be an inhibitor of chymotrypsin, arguably not a good candidate for nutritional supplementation because chymotrypsin inhibitors can interfere with digestion.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      Similarly, U.S. Pat. No. 5,367,110 (1995) to Galili et al. describes transgenic plants that overexpress threonine and lysine.
      <br/>
      In such plants, a co-transformation process with chimeric genes introduces aspartate kinase activity as well as dihydrodipicolinate synthase activity.
      <br/>
      This process is intended to enhance the biosynthesis of aspartate-family amino acids, such as lysine, threonine, methionine and isoleucine, in particular the first two amino acids identified.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      Alternatively, U.S. Pat. No. 5,258,300 (1993) to Glassman et al. is directed to methods of inducing lysine overproduction in plants by introducing the gene for dihydrodipicolinic acid synthase (DHDPS) which is substantially resistant to feedback inhibition by endogenously-produced free L-lysine.
      <br/>
      Attached at the 5' terminus of this gene is a sequence encoding a chloroplast transit peptide, which serves to localize the DHDPS in the chloroplasts of transformed cells, where it can act to enhance the biosynthesis of free L-lysine.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      Other recent advances in agricultural biotechnology offer other molecular approaches to alter the amino acid composition of seed proteins for improved nutritional quality.
      <br/>
      The transfer and expression of heterologous genes in plant tissues and plant seeds has been considered promising.
      <br/>
      It has been demonstrated that a seed protein gene can be transferred and expressed in transgenic plants in a developmentally regulated manner, i.e., the protein product generally is synthesized, transported and properly deposited in the seeds.
      <br/>
      Moreover, the feasibility of transforming a plant with an essential amino acid-rich protein gene also has been demonstrated.
    </p>
    <p num="11">
      For example, the research group of one of the present inventors (Dr. Samuel Sun) isolated from Brazil nut a gene encoding a sulfur-rich protein (SRP), having 18% Met and 8% Cys.
      <br/>
      The SRP gene was subsequently (1989) transferred into tobacco plants to test if the expression of this transgene could enhance the Met content in the transgenic seeds.
      <br/>
      Results showed that it is feasible to increase the Met content of the transgenic tobacco seeds (by up to 30%) through this molecular approach.
      <br/>
      See, e.g., Altenbach et al., Plant Molecular Biology 13:513-522 (1989).
      <br/>
      The SRP gene was acquired by Pioneer-Hibred International, Inc., patented by Sun et al., and used for crop protein improvement.
    </p>
    <p num="12">
      However, what has been needed is method to transform plants in order to achieve overexpression of lysine without the problems and disadvantages associated with prior art approaches.
      <br/>
      With respect to the expression of heterologous genes, the development of such methods will benefit from a better understanding of how gene transcription is regulated and the structure of seed storage proteins, the development of procedures for transforming and regenerating important seed crops, and the identification and isolation of seed storage protein genes that encode proteins containing high levels of a specific essential amino acid or a combination of these amino acids.

    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="13">This invention relates to novel lysine rich proteins isolated from winged bean, and to its variants and modifications.</p>
    <p num="14">In still other aspects, the invention provides an isolated nucleic acid molecule encoding a WBLRP and to its allelic variants, labeled or unlabeled, and a nucleic acid sequence that is complementary to, or hybridizes under stringent conditions to, a nucleic acid sequence encoding a WBLRP.</p>

    <p num="16">
      FIG. 1 shows the cDNA sequence (SEQ ID NO:1) of the 18 kD seed protein from winged bean.
      <br/>
      FIG. 2 show the deduced amino acid sequence (SEQ ID NO:2) of the 18 kD seed protein from winged bean.
      <br/>
      FIGS. 3A and 3B show the cDNA (SEQ ID NO:1) and deduced amino acid (SEQ ID NO:2) sequences of the 18-KD WB seed protein.
    </p>
    <heading>MODES OF CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="17">
      We have identified and isolated a Lys-rich protein (WBLRP) from winged bean Psophocarpus tetragonolobus and a cDNA encoding the WBLRP was cloned and sequenced (FIG. 1) (SEQ ID NO:1).
      <br/>
      The deduced amino acid sequence revealed that the 18 kD WBLRP contains 10.83 mol % Lys, representing the most abundant amino acid in this protein (FIG. 2) (SEQ ID NO:2).
      <br/>
      We have further demonstrated that this gene is expressed only in the developing seeds, and therefore was a good candidate gene for the genetic engineering of seed proteins.
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      The WBLRP gene can be utilized, through transgenic technology, to enhance the Lys levels of plant proteins.
      <br/>
      It is particularly valuable in improving the nutritional quality of cereal proteins, including those of corn, wheat, rice and barley, the world's major food crops, which are deficient in Lys.
      <br/>
      The economic and human nutritional values of this enhancement would be enormous.
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      As noted above, however, notwithstanding a strong economic motivation to improve plants in this way, prior to our invention, no entirely useful products, without significant detrimental traits, have been reported.
      <br/>
      The WBLRP of the present invention also can be applied to enhance the Lys content in soybean for use as animal feed, and there are recent studies on the economic implications of this enhancement.
      <br/>
      For example, the competitive product for Lys-rich soybean meal would be crystalline lysine-HCL, which costs about $1.65/lb and contains 78% lysine.
      <br/>
      Therefore, a soybean meal contains 1% increased Lys would be worth about $55 more per ton.
      <br/>
      The estimated total additional value of increasing Lys by 1% in soybean as animal feed is $851 million/year (Economic Implications of Modified Soybean Traits--Special Report 92, Iowa State University and Iowa Soybean Promotion Board &amp; American Soybean Association cooperating, 1990).

    <p num="20">
      In addition to the specific techniques described below, the practice of the present invention will employ conventional techniques of molecular biology, microbiology, recombinant DNA technology, and plant science, all of which are within the skill of the art.
      <br/>
      Such techniques are explained fully in the literature.

    </p>
    <p num="21">In describing the present invention, the following terminology will be used in accordance with the definitions below.</p>
    <p num="22">A "replicon" is any genetic element (e.g., plasmid, cosmid, chromosome, virus, etc.) that behaves as an autonomous unit of DNA replication in vivo; i.e., capable of replication under its own control within a cell.</p>
    <p num="23">A "vector" is a replicon, such as a plasmid, cosmid, or bacteriophage, to which another DNA segment may be attached so as to bring about replication of the attached segment, or to allow its introduction into a cellular host.</p>
    <p num="24">
      A "DNA molecule" is a species of nucleic acid, as defined below, and refers to the polymeric form of deoxyribonucleotides (adenine, guanine, thymine, or cytosine) in either single- or double-stranded form.
      <br/>
      The double-stranded form may, of course, be implied by the context of the molecule's environment (e.g., a chromosome).
      <br/>
      When in the double-stranded form, the molecule will usually be in its normal, double-stranded helix.
      <br/>
      The term "DNA molecule" is not limited to any particular tertiary form of DNA.
      <br/>
      Thus, the term includes double-stranded DNA found, inter alia, in linear DNA molecules, viruses, plasmids, and chromosomes.
      <br/>
      When discussing the structure of particular double-stranded DNA molecules, sequences may be described herein according to the normal conventions.
    </p>
    <p num="25">
      A DNA "coding sequence" is a DNA sequence which is transcribed and translated into a polypeptide in vivo when placed under the control of appropriate regulatory sequences.
      <br/>
      The boundaries of the coding sequence are determined by the start codon at the 5' terminus and a translation stop codon at the 3' terminus.
      <br/>
      Examples of coding sequences include cDNA reverse transcribed from eukaryotic mRNA, genomic DNA sequences from eukaryotic cells, and synthetic DNA sequences.
    </p>
    <p num="26">
      A cell which has been "transformed" by an exogenous DNA sequence is a cell into which the exogenous DNA has been introduced.
      <br/>
      The exogenous DNA may be integrated (covalently linked) to chromosomal DNA making up the genome of the cell, or it may remain extrachromosomal. "Stably" integrated DNA sequences are those which are inherited through chromosome replication by daughter cells or organisms (accounting for loss by Mendelian segregation).
      <br/>
      This stability is exhibited by the ability to establish cell lines or clones comprised of a population containing the exogenous DNA.
    </p>
    <p num="27">A "clone" or "cell line" is a population of cells descended from a single cell or common ancestor by mitosis and is capable of stable growth in vitro for many generations.</p>
    <p num="28">
      A composition of a first type of matter (e.g., a DNA molecule containing a coding region) is "substantially free" of a second type of matter (e.g., DNA molecules which do not contain a coding region) if the composition is comprised of less than about 10% (weight/weight) of the second type of matter relative to the sum of the first and second types of matter.
      <br/>
      Preferably, the composition contains less than about 5% of the second type of matter, most preferably less than about 1%.
    </p>
    <p num="29">
      Two sequences, such as nucleic acid sequences or amino acid sequences, are "substantially homologous" when the sequences are a minimum of about 80% homologous over a selected region, preferably at least about 90% homologous, and more preferably at least about 95% homologous.
      <br/>
      Identity or homology with respect to a common sequence is defined herein as the percentage of nucleic acids or amino acid residues in the candidate sequence that are identical with the WBLRP DNA or protein disclosed herein, after aligning the sequences and introducing gaps, if necessary, to achieve the maximum percent homology, and not considering any conservative substitutions as part of the sequence identity.
      <br/>
      None of N-terminal, C-terminal or internal extensions, deletions, or insertions into the WBLRP sequence shall be construed as affecting homology.
    </p>
    <p num="30">
      WBLRP "nucleic acid" is defined as RNA or DNA that encodes a WBLRP, or is complementary to nucleic acid sequence encoding a WBLRP, or hybridizes to such nucleic acid and remains stably bound to it under stringent conditions, or encodes a polypeptide sharing at least 80% sequence identity, preferably at least 90%, and more preferably at least 95%, with the translated amino acid sequences shown in FIG. 2.
      <br/>
      Specifically contemplated are genomic DNA, cDNA, mRNA and antisense molecules, as well as nucleic acids based on alternative backbone or including alternative bases whether derived from natural sources or synthesized.
      <br/>
      Such hybridizing or complementary nucleic acid, however, is defined further as being novel and unobvious over any prior art nucleic acid including that which encodes, hybridizes under stringent conditions, or is complementary to nucleic acid encoding a WBLRP or a pathogenesis-related protein as described below.

      <br/>
      Other regulatory sequences include operators, enhancers, and the like.

      Cells transformed with sequences encoding these proteins are able to survive on media which would otherwise be toxic to the cell.

      Other types of markers, such as beta-galactosidase (lacZ) cause cells transformed therewith to change color under certain conditions, thus allowing for visual selection.
      <br/>
      The presence of the selectable marker in the expression cassette allows for the determination of whether a particular cell has been transformed stably by the expression cassette.

      It is possible to assemble the expression cassette prior to inserting it into a cloning vector as described above.

      Sequence Homology with the Pathogenesis-Related Proteins
    </p>
    <p num="103">
      A search of the sequence data in the GenBank revealed that the WBLRP share high sequence homology (50-87%) with those of the many pathogenesis-related (PR) proteins.
      <br/>
      PR proteins accumulate as a part of a defense response system in many plants exposed to viroids, viruses, fungi, bacteria and other stresses (Linthorst, H. J. M., 1991. Critical Rev.
      <br/>
      Plant Sci., 10:123-150; Fristensky, B. et al., 1988. Plant Mol. Biol. 11:713-715; and Crowell, D. N. et al., 1992. Plant Mol. Biol. 18:459-466).
      <br/>
      Upon calculating the lysine content of the available sequences of PR proteins, we found that these proteins, like WBLRP, are rich in lysine.
      <br/>
      However, in the literature on PR proteins, there was no noticeable attention paid to the high lysine content of these proteins, nor any recognition of the potential use of these proteins for nutritional quality improvement.
      <br/>
      This may be due to the scientists working in the PR protein area center their interest only in the pathogenicity aspects of these proteins, or the involvement of the PR proteins in plant diseases renders these proteins unattractive for potential use in plant nutrition improvement.
      <br/>
      Thus, the literature might reveal the utility of the PR proteins for disease resistance and not for plant nutrition improvements.
    </p>
    <p num="104">B. WBLRP: Special Biological Characteristics Favoring its use for Plant Nutrition Improvement</p>
    <p num="105">
      We have carried out further experiments to investigate the molecular biology of the WBLRP.
      <br/>
      Unlike most PR proteins that are synthesized in response to pathogen infection and wounding, chemical and other stresses, we found that the WBLRP is a relatively abundant protein (2% as total protein) in the seeds of winged bean.
      <br/>
      Northern hybridization experiments revealed that the expression of the WBLRP gene is organ specific, i.e. the WBLRP gene only expressed in the seed but not in the leaf, stem, root, or flower.
      <br/>
      The expression of the WBLRP gene is also developmentally regulated.
      <br/>
      Specifically, the expression of the WBLRP in the developing seeds starts 20 days after flowering (DAF), peaks at 35 DAF, and declines 45 DAF.
      <br/>
      Thus the WBLRP gene is under tight control for spatial and temporal expression in the normally developing winged bean seeds; in this respect, its expression is not related to pathogen activity or wounding.
      <br/>
      The synthesis and accumulation of the lysine-rich protein in abundance in the seeds makes the WBLRP gene a suitable target for plant (especially seed) nutrition improvement.

      This chimeric gene is then inserted into the Agrobacterium transformation vector, pBI121.
      <br/>
      The vector harboring the WBLRP chimeric gene will then be transferred into A. tumefaciens LBA4404, and used to transform the rapeseed explants.
    </p>
    <p num="110">
      The transformation and regeneration of several commercial cultivars of rapeseed plants are well documented and established.
      <br/>
      To summarize, there are three major procedures for rapeseed transformation: 1. stem segments as explants via A. rhizogenes (Guerche et al.
      <br/>
      Mol. Gen. Genet. 202:382-386, 1987) or A. tumefaciens (Pua et al. Bio/Tech. 5:815-817, 1987); 2.

      Hypocotyls as explants via A. tumefaciens (De Block et al., Plant Physiol. 91:694-701, 1989) or A. rhizogenes, Damgaard &amp; Rasmussen, Plant Mol.
      <br/>
      Biol. 17:1-8, 1991); and 3.
      <br/>
      Protoplasts as starting materials via electroporation (Guerche et al., Plant Sci. 52:111-116, 1987).
      <br/>
      Using these procedures, transgenic rapeseed plants with normal phenotype and full fertility can be generated in about four months.
    </p>
    <p num="111">
      The procedure using A. tumefaciens to transform the hypocotyl segments of rapeseed will be followed.
      <br/>
      In the present example, the A. tumefaciens LBA4404 carrying the WBLRP chimeric gene will be used to transform the rapeseed cultivar Westar, a spring cultivar, and the transgenic plants will be recovered, as detailed by Altenbach et al., Plant Mol.
      <br/>
      Biol. 18:235-245.
    </p>
    <p num="112">
      The integration of the WBLRP chimeric gene into the rapeseed genome will be detected by Southern blot hybridization using the WBLRP cDNA as a probe.
      <br/>
      The expression of the transgene in the transgenic seeds will be determined by: 1) Northern blot hybridization, using WBLRP cDNA as a probe, for the WBLRP transcripts (mRNA), and 2) Western blot/immunodetection, using antibody specific for the LRP, for the WBLRP protein.
      <br/>
      To quantitate the lysine content in the transgenic seeds, total protein will be extracted from the seeds and its amino acid composition determined.
      <br/>
      Comparison of the lysine contents between the transgenic and control (untransformed) seeds should reveal the enhancement of the lysine content in the transgenic seeds.
