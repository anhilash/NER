    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">The present invention relates to a MIS (metal-insulator-semiconductor) device (including MISFET (metal-insulator-semiconductor field-effect-transistor) and CCD (charge-coupled-device) structures), an analogue MISFET using MIS device, a threshold voltage correcting method using MIS device, a potential adjusting method using MIS device, a bias circuit using MIS device, a charge transfer device using MIS device, a solid-state imaging device using MIS device and a charge detecting apparatus using MIS device.</p>
    <p num="3">More particularly, this invention relates to a MIS device in which a threshold voltage or channel potential can be controlled in an analogue fashion.</p>
    <p num="4">This invention relates to a method of correcting a threshold voltage in which a fluctuation of a threshold voltage between MIS devices of a semiconductor integrated circuit composed of a plurality of MIS devices can be corrected.</p>
    <p num="5">This invention relates to a method of adjusting a channel potential in which a channel potential of a MIS device can be adjusted.</p>
    <p num="6">This invention relates to a bias circuit in which an output bias can be set in an analogue fashion.</p>
    <p num="7">This invention relates to a charge transfer device using a CCD.</p>
    <p num="8">This invention relates to a solid-state imaging device, such as a CCD solid-state imaging device and an amplifying-type solid-state imaging device.</p>
    <p num="9">This invention relates to a charge detecting device used in a solid-state imaging device.</p>
    <p num="10">CCD solid-state imaging devices have an imaging region composed of an n-type semiconductor substrate, a p-type well region formed on the n-type semiconductor substrate and a plurality of n-type photoelectric conversion portions, i.e., light-receiving portions formed on the p-type well region in a matrix fashion.</p>
    <p num="11">In the above CCD solid-state imaging device, an allowable amount of signal charges e accumulated in the light-receiving portion when light becomes incident on the light-receiving portion, i.e., an amount of signal charges treated by the light-receiving portion is determined by a height of a potential barrier  PHI a of an overflow barrier OFB composed of the p-type well region as shown in potential distribution diagrams of FIGS. 1A and 1B. Specifically, if the signal charges e accumulated in the light-receiving portion exceeds the amount of signal charges treated by the light-receiving portion, then extra charges are overflowed through the potential barrier  PHI a of the overflow barrier OFB and discharged to the n-type substrate forming an overflow drain OFD.</p>
    <p num="12">
      The amount of signal charges treated by the light-receiving portion, i.e., the height of the potential barrier  PHI a of the overflow barrier OFB is controlled by a bias voltage applied to the n-type substrate forming the overflow drain OFD, i.e., so-called substrate voltage Vsub.
      <br/>
      However, according to this device structure, since device structures are frequently fluctuated when they are manufactured, the height of the potential barrier  PHI a of the overflow barrier OFB is frequently fluctuated as shown by a dotted line height  PHI a, in FIG. 1A. Therefore, each time devices are manufactured, different substrate voltages Vsub, Vsub ' have to be set, respectively.
    </p>
    <p num="13">
      In the CCD solid-state imaging device, as shown in FIG. 2, a floating diffusion region FD for converting electric charges into voltages is formed at the succeeding stage of a horizontal transfer register 1 through a horizontal output gate portion HOG.
      <br/>
      There are provided a reset gate portion 2 and a reset drain region 3 for resetting signal charges transferred to the floating diffusion region FD at every pixel.
    </p>
    <p num="14">
      The horizontal transfer register 1 is composed of an n-type transfer channel region 5 formed on the surface of the p-type well region 4, for example, a gate insulating film and a plurality of transfer electrodes 6 �6A, 6B�. The adjacent two transfer electrodes 6A and 6B are paired.
      <br/>
      Two-phase horizontal drive pulses  PHI H1 and  PHI H2 are applied to every pair of transfer electrodes 6 �6A, 6B� and every other pair of transfer electrodes 6 �6A, 6B�. A p-type region 7, for example, is formed on the transfer channel region 5 under each second transfer electrode 6B by implantation of ions thereby to form a transfer portion including a storage electrode formed of the first transfer electrode 6A and a transfer portion formed of the second transfer electrode 6B.
    </p>
    <p num="15">
      The horizontal output gate portion HOG is composed of the gate insulating film (not shown) and a gate electrode 8 formed thereon through the gate insulating film.
      <br/>
      A ground potential is applied to the gate electrode 8.
      <br/>
      The floating diffusion region FD is formed of an n-type semiconductor region, for example, and connected to a charge detector 9 whose detected output signal is obtained at an output terminal t1.
      <br/>
      The reset drain region 3 is formed of an n-type semiconductor region, for example, and a reset voltage VRD, e.g., a power supply voltage VDD is applied to the reset drain region 3.
    </p>
    <p num="16">
      The reset gate portion 2 is composed of the gate insulating film (not shown) and a gate electrode 10 formed thereon through the gate insulating film.
      <br/>
      A reset pulse  PHI RG is applied to the gate electrode 10.
    </p>
    <p num="17">
      In recent CCD solid-state imaging devices, a driver circuit for applying the drive pulses  PHI H1,  PHI H2 is incorporated in the horizontal transfer register 1 and a driver circuit for applying the reset pulse  PHI RG is incorporated in a timing generator.
      <br/>
      Moreover, in order to reduce a power consumption, an amplitude of a pulse is lowered.
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      Since an operation point of the reset pulse  PHI RG is determined depending on the power supply voltage VDD which is the reset voltage VRD, there is then the problem that a potential under the reset gate portion 2 is fluctuated (shown by a dotted line in FIG. 2).
      <br/>
      To solve this problem, a DC bias value of the reset pulse  PHI RG has to be set to a desired value for every device.
      <br/>
      The DC bias value of the reset pulse  PHI RG is set by an external circuit (i.e., so-called bias circuit).
      <br/>
      When the driver circuit for applying the reset pulse  PHI RG is incorporated within the timing generator, the DC bias value of the reset pulse  PHI RG is digitally set in a so-called phase-cut fashion.
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      Further, an amplifying type solid-state imaging device is known as a solid-state imaging device.
      <br/>
      The amplifying type solid-state imaging device accumulates photoelectrically-converted holes (signal charges) in a p-type well region of an n-channel MOS (metal-oxide-semiconductor) transistor and outputs a change of channel current based on a potential fluctuation (i.e., potential change in the back-gate) in the p-type well region as a pixel signal.
      <br/>
      An n-type well region is formed on a p-type substrate and the p-type well region in which signal charges are accumulated.
      <br/>
      This amplifying type solid-state imaging device also has to set a substrate voltage.
    </p>
    <p num="20">
      On the other hand, there is known an ultraviolet-light-erasure ROM (read-only memory) having a gate insulating film formed of an SiN film to memorize data by controlling a potential.
      <br/>
      FIG. 3 shows an example of such ultraviolet-light-erasure ROM.
      <br/>
      As shown in FIG. 3, a p-type region 11 has an n-type source region 12 and an n-type drain region 13 formed on its surface.
      <br/>
      A gate electrode 17 made of polycrystalline silicon, for example, is formed between the n-type source region 12 and the n-type drain region 13 through a gate insulating film 16 composed of a silicon oxide film 14 and a silicon nitride film 15.
      <br/>
      Electrons or holes are accumulated in the silicon nitride film 15 to achieve a memory effect.
      <br/>
      However, this ROM can be turned on and off in a digital fashion.
      <br/>
      Therefore, when the SiN layer and the gate electrode contact with each other, injected electric charges e' tend to be leaked to the gate portion and a DC bias of this ROM cannot be controlled in an analogue fashion.
    </p>
    <p num="21">
      Although CCD solid-state imaging devices are products using a potential of a so-called MIS device, the potential of the MIS device is difficult to be controlled and hence manufactured products of the CCD solid-state imaging devices are not uniform in potential.
      <br/>
      The potential shift has heretofore been avoided by controlling a bias applied from the outside.
      <br/>
      The same assignee of this application has previously proposed a method in which a fluctuation of potential is measured and adjusted selectively forcibly.
      <br/>
      The aforesaid ROM is known as the MIS device whose operation point can be changed later.
      <br/>
      This ROM can be operated in a digital fashion and therefore a potential cannot be adjusted in an analogue fashion.

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
    <p num="36">Embodiments of the present invention will hereinafter be described with reference to the drawings.</p>
    <p num="37">
      Initially, a device having a metal (electrode)insulator-semiconductor structure, i.e., so-called MIS device according to an embodiment of the present invention will be described.
      <br/>
      The MIS device according to this embodiment can set a potential or a threshold voltage Vth under the gate in an analogue fashion by controlling an amount of signal charges, such as electrons and holes, accumulated in a gate insulating film, in particular, a nitride film in an analogue fashion.
    </p>
    <p num="38">FIG. 4 is a cross-sectional view showing an inventive MIS device applied to a MISFET by way of example.</p>
    <p num="39">
      As shown in FIG. 4, a MISFET 21 according to this embodiment has a first conductivity-type (e.g., n-type or p-type) semiconductor region (semiconductor well and semiconductor base) 22 on which major surface there are formed second conductivity-type (p-type or n-type) source region 23 and drain region 24.
      <br/>
      Then, a gate insulating film 25 having a three-layer structure is formed by laminating an oxide film, e.g., silicon oxide film (SiO2) 26, a nitride film, e.g., silicon nitride film (SiN) 27 and an oxide film, e.g., silicon oxide film (SiO2) 28, in that order.
      <br/>
      This gate insulating film 25 is formed on the semiconductor region 22 at its major surface corresponding to the semiconductor region between the source region 23 and the drain region 24.
      <br/>
      A gate electrode 30 made of a polycrystalline silicon, for example, is formed on the gate insulating film 25.
      <br/>
      A source electrode 31 and a drain electrode 32 are formed on the source region 23 and the drain region 24, respectively.
    </p>
    <p num="40">
      In the MISFET 21 having a so-called MONOS (metal oxide nitride oxide semiconductor) structure, if electrons are accumulated in the silicon nitride film 27 in the gate insulating film 25, then this becomes equivalent to the fact that an offset of a predetermined negative potential is applied to a gate voltage VG.
      <br/>
      Therefore, if the MISFET 21 is of the n-channel type, then potentials under the gate are moved in the so-called enhancement direction (direction in which potential becomes shallow).
      <br/>
      If on the other hand the MISFET 21 is of the n-channel type, then potentials under the gate are moved in the so-called depletion direction (direction in which potential become deep).
      <br/>
      Conversely, if holes are accumulated in the silicon nitride film 27 in the gate insulating film 25, then this becomes equivalent to the fact that an offset of a predetermined positive potential is applied to the gate voltage VG.
      <br/>
      Therefore, if the MISFET 21 is of the n-channel type, potentials under the gate are moved in the depletion direction.
      <br/>
      If on the other hand the MISFET 21 is of the p-channel type, then potentials under the gate are moved in the enhancement direction.
    </p>
    <p num="41">
      When the MISFET 21 is modified as an n-channel MISFET 21N having the MONOS structure as shown in FIG. 5, if a high voltage is applied to an interface between the gate electrode 30 and a channel region formed beneath the gate electrode 30, by way of example, if a source voltage VS and a drain voltage VD are both set to 0V (p-type semiconductor region 22 is, however, grounded) and a positive (+) high gate voltage (voltage higher than a normal drive voltage) is applied to the gate electrode 30 for a predetermined period of time, then electrons e of a certain constant amount are injected into the silicon nitride film 27 from the n+ layers forming the source region 23 and the drain region 24.
      <br/>
      The injected amount of electrons e depends on the voltage VG applied to the gate electrode 30 and a time during which the voltage VG is applied to the gate electrode 30.
      <br/>
      Therefore, it is possible to inject electrons e of a desired amount into the silicon nitride film 27 by controlling the voltage VG applied to the gate electrode 30 and the time during which the voltage VG is applied to the gate electrode 30.
      <br/>
      Specifically, the potentials are moved in the enhancement direction and therefore the desired potential or the threshold voltage Vth can be obtained.

    <p num="65">Specifically, the potential  PHI m ( PHI m1) under the reset gate portion 82 is detected and the detected potential  PHI m1 is compared with a reference value  PHI m2 (i.e., value of potential to be set).</p>

      As shown in FIG. 9, a protecting device 86 is formed on the same semiconductor wafer together with an imaging device body.
      <br/>
      The protecting device 86 is composed of a pair of diodes PD connected in series.
      <br/>
      One end of the protecting device 86 is connected to a power supply voltage VDD and the other end thereof is connected to the ground (GND).

      Under the wafer state, the external output terminal 87 connected to a gate electrode 85 of the reset gate portion 82 and the protecting device 86 are placed in the disconnected state.
      <br/>
      When the CCD solid-state imaging device is inspected in the wafer state, the potential  PHI m is adjusted.

      When the CCD solid-state imaging device is assembled, the external output terminal 87 and the protecting device 86 are connected by a wire bonding 88.
      <br/>
      Therefore, even when a static electricity is applied to the external output terminal 85 after the CCD solid-state imaging device was shipped, the protecting device 86 can prevent the static electricity from being applied to the reset gate portion 82.

      In that case, an adjusting circuit, i.e., a bias circuit for adjusting a potential is additionally provided.

      An output bias value from the bias circuit is adjusted by adjusting a channel potential of the MIS device.

      If the measured potential  PHI m is different from the reference value  PHI m2, then the channel potential of the drive MIS transistor 92 is adjusted by injecting electric charges of an amount sufficient enough to correct such difference of potentials into the gate insulating film of the drive MIS transistor 92 in the bias circuit 91 by the above-mentioned method.
      <br/>
      Thus, an output bias voltage of a desired value can be output from the bias circuit 91 and applied to the reset gate portion 82 as the DC bias voltage VRG, resulting in the potential  PHI m under the reset gate portion being adjusted.
    </p>
    <p num="100">The reset gate electrode 85 is applied with a reset pulse  PHI RG with a reset pulse high frequency component superimposed thereon from the reset pulse generator 100.</p>
    <p num="101">
      Inasmuch as the drive MIS transistor 92 is driven in the enhancement state after the potential  PHI m has been adjusted, if a load current i is minimized, then the bias circuit 91 becomes equivalent to a low-clamping circuit 98 formed of a diode D as seen from the terminal t3 (see FIGS. 13 and 14).
      <br/>
      FIG. 15 is a characteristic graph of voltage versus current characteristics of the equivalent circuit 98 shown in FIG. 14. If the drive MIS transistor 92 is driven in the depletion state, then the drive MIS transistor 92 does not act as the diode D and is given a resistance characteristic.
      <br/>
      As a result, the drive MIS transistor 92 become an average-value clamping circuit so that a reset gate voltage is fluctuated as the amplitude and duty ratio of the reset pulse are fluctuated.
      <br/>
      There are then the problems that the floating diffusion region FD suffers from the insufficient amount of the saturated signals and that the reset gate pulse becomes unsatisfactory.
      <br/>
      If however the low-clamping circuit 98 is used as the bias circuit 91, then even when the amplitude and duty ratio of the reset gate pulse are fluctuated, the low-level voltage of the reset gate pulse becomes constant, thereby preventing the amount of the saturated signals from becoming insufficient.
    </p>
    <p num="102">Therefore, according to the CCD solid-state imaging device 101, since the potential under the reset gate portion 82 also is shifted as the power supply voltage VDD is fluctuated, even when the power supply voltage VDD is fluctuated, a potential difference between the potential under the reset gate portion 82 and the potential in the reset drain region 81 can be prevented from being shifted.</p>

      In the bias circuit 91, if the potential shift amount is large, then VG &gt;VS.
      <br/>
      Therefore, a gate-source potential difference increases and there is the problem whether the bias circuit 91 can withstand a high voltage when the bias circuit 91 is operated in actual practice.
      <br/>
      In the bias circuit 91', in the initial stage, VG &lt;VD is satisfied and a gate-drain potential difference increases and there is then the similar problem whether the bias circuit 91' can withstand a high voltage.

      FIG. 16 shows an example of a bias circuit according to the present invention wherein the above-mentioned problem can be solved.
      <br/>
      As shown in FIG. 16, a bias circuit 102 according to this embodiment is a source-follower type bias circuit composed of a number of (three in this embodiment) the drive MIS transistors 92 having the MONOS structure connected in series and the load resistor 93 connected to the source of the drive MIS transistor 92 of the final stage.

    <p num="105">When a channel potential of each drive MIS transistor 92 is adjusted, the drain of each drive MIS transistor 92, the power supply terminal VDD and the output terminal t3 are grounded as shown by a dotted line to apply a desired high voltage to each of the gate terminals 95 �95A, 95B, 95C� thereby to adjust the channel potential of each drive MIS transistor 92.</p>
    <p num="106">
      According to the bias circuit thus arranged, a potential shift amount of the drive MIS transistor 92 per stage can be reduced, i.e., the adjustment range can be reduced with the result that a total amount of a potential shift, accordingly, the adjustment range can be expanded.
      <br/>
      Simultaneously, it is possible to avoid the drive MIS transistor 92 from being deteriorated in withstanding a high voltage among the gate-source and drain when the drive MIS transistor 92 is operated in actual practice.

    <p num="107">
      Specifically, if all drive MIS transistors 92 are set in the depletion state and turned on, then the initial output from the output terminal t3 becomes the power supply voltage VDD.

      <br/>
      If each drive MIS transistor 92 is completely turned off, the output becomes 0V.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the potential can be adjusted in a wide range from the power supply voltage VDD to 0V and the problem that the drive MIS transistor 92 cannot withstand a high voltage can be solved.

      According to the inventive MIS device, a threshold value or a channel potential can be set finely in an analogue fashion.

      Then, the gate insulating film is of the three-layer structure of an oxide film, a nitride film and an oxide film.

      When a threshold voltage is corrected, a channel potential of the MIS device is detected and the detected channel potential is compared with a reference value, whereafter a fluctuation of a threshold voltage between the MIS devices can be easily corrected with a high accuracy by injecting electric charges corresponding to the difference into the nitride film of the gate insulating film.

      A bias circuit according to the present invention has a circuit arrangement in which a load resistor and a MISFET are connected in series between first and second potentials.

      According to an inventive bias circuit, since a MISFET is operated in the enhancement mode after its channel potential has been adjusted by injecting electric charges into a gate insulating film of the MISFET, this bias circuit serves as a low-clamping circuit having a diode characteristic when a load current is reduced.

      Therefore, when a bias voltage of this bias circuit is set to a DC bias VRG of the reset gate, even if an amplitude of a reset pulse and a duty ratio are fluctuated, a low-level voltage of the reset gate can be held constant and a saturated signal can be prevented from becoming insufficient.
