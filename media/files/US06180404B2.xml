    <heading>TECHNICAL FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">
      The field of this invention is cell culture media.
      <br/>
      More particularly, the present invention pertains to a medium for neural cells or tissue that maintains viability of those cells or tissue in an atmosphere having ambient levels of carbon dioxide.
    </p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="3">
      A major problem attendant to studies of central nervous system tissue is the maintenance of cell viability of such tissues.
      <br/>
      The inability to maintain central nervous system tissue viability in culture for prolonged periods of time and under various environmental conditions has impeded the development of effective therapeutic regimens for treating central nervous system disorders.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      A nutrient balanced salt solution (medium) for maintaining central nervous system tissue viability in a high-carbon dioxide atmosphere (5% CO2) has recently been developed.
      <br/>
      That medium, Neurobasal (tm)  (Gibco/Life Technologies, Inc., Gaithersburg, Md.), is a bicarbonate buffered medium optimized for the growth of embryonic rat hippocampal neurons at a pH of 7.3 in 5% CO2.
      <br/>
      Neurobasal (tm)  is a derivative of Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium (DMEM) and was formulated to optimize embryonic rat hippocampal cell survival.
      <br/>
      When compared to DMEM, Neurobasal (tm)  has less NaCl and less NaHCO3, resulting in a lower osmolality, and lesser amounts of cysteine and glutamine, resulting in diminished glial growth.
      <br/>
      In addition, Neurobasal (tm)  contains alanine, asparagine, proline and vitamin B12, all of which are absent from DMEM.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      Although neurons can be maintained in a 5% CO2 atmosphere in this high bicarbonate medium, when supplemented with B27 (a hormone and anti-oxidant supplement available from Life Technologies, Inc.), neurons undergo rapid death when transferred to ambient CO2 (0.2%) conditions.
      <br/>
      Death is associated with a rapid rise in medium pH to a value of 8.1.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      The preparation and study of neural tissue and cells frequently requires the use of ambient CO2 levels outside of an incubator.
      <br/>
      Existing methods for controlling the pH of cells outside of incubators include the use of weak buffers (e.g., as found in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium or L 15 medium) and the use of continuous gassing with 5-10% CO2 to maintain physiological pH.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      A simple test, however, shows that ambient CO2 causes the pH of DMEM to quickly rise to a value of 8.1 outside the incubator.
      <br/>
      The common practice of buffering with HEPES slows but does not prevent this substantial alkalinization.
      <br/>
      The practice of continuously gassing tissues to maintain high CO2 levels and physiological pH is cumbersome and expensive.
      <br/>
      There continues to be a need in the art, therefore, for a medium that can maintain physiological pH and neural cell viability in ambient CO2 conditions.
    </p>
    <heading>BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="8">
      In one aspect, the present invention provides a minimal essential medium for maintaining neural cell or tissue viability in an environment containing ambient levels of CO2.

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="16">
      I.
      <br/>
      Composition of Matter
    </p>
    <p num="17">
      In one aspect, the present invention provides a medium for neural cells or tissue maintained in an environment containing ambient amounts of carbon dioxide (CO2).
      <br/>
      As is well known in the art, ambient air contains less than about 0.25% CO2 and, more typically, about 0.2% CO2. A medium of the present invention is designed and formulated to allow for prolonged survival and viability of neural cells or tissue exposed to such low CO2 levels.
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      As is well known in the art, there are a variety of preparative steps to obtain primary neural cell cultures.
      <br/>
      By way of example, specific regions of the brain are typically dissected as a tissue and placed in a suitable medium.
      <br/>
      This neural tissue is further processed to obtain cells which are typically plated in a culture container and the medium is placed over the plated tissue.
      <br/>
      In both cases, the medium is changed as needed to maintain viability.
      <br/>
      As used herein, the terms "suspended" or "cultured" are used to refer both to suspensions of tissue, or individual cells and plated individual cells.
      <br/>
      As used herein, the phrase "neural cells" means either individual cells of the same or different type whether those cells exist as isolated cells or exist in the form of aggregates or collections.
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      A medium of the present invention is a derivative of a basal medium previously described by the present inventor to provide prolonged viability of neural cells or tissue in a high-CO2 environment (e.g., 5% CO2) such as typically used in cell incubators (Brewer et al., J. Neuroscience Res., 35:567-576, 1993).
      <br/>
      The basal medium described in that publication was designated Neurobasal (tm) .
    </p>
    <p num="20">A medium of the present invention contains the same nutrients (e.g., glucose, amino acids) and vitamins as Neurobasal (tm) . Differences between Neurobasal (tm)  and a medium of the present invention are changes in the levels of bicarbonate and sodium chloride and the use of MOPS as the inert buffer (HEPES is used in Neurobasal (tm) ).</p>
    <p num="21">
      Like Neurobasal (tm) , a medium of the present invention can be used with neural cells or tissue derived from any area of the central nervous system of a mammal, including humans.
      <br/>
      The cells or tissues can be derived or obtained from embryonic, neo-natal or adult central nervous system tissue.
      <br/>
      A medium of the present invention can also be used to maintain viability of neural cells or tissue obtained after death of the donor animal (post-mortem harvesting).
      <br/>
      Post-mortem tissue harvesting is particularly important where the donor animal is killed rather than anesthetized prior to tissue extraction.

      A medium of the present invention is characterized by the presence of very low levels of a bicarbonate buffer system.
      <br/>
      The pH value of the medium is controlled predominantly by non-bicarbonate buffers.
      <br/>
      Those buffers include sodium phosphate (e.g., NaH2 PO4) and inert buffers having a pKa between a pH value of about 6.9 and about 7.7. Such inert buffers are well known to those of skill in the art and readily available from commercial sources.
      <br/>
      A preferred such inert buffer is 3-�N-morpholino� propane-sulfonic acid (MOPS) having a pKa of about 7.2. An inert buffer used in a medium of the present invention must be non-toxic toward neural cells.
      <br/>
      Thus, for example, the use of HEPES, which has been shown to be phototoxic to certain neural cells should be avoided.
      <br/>
      The inert buffer is present at a final concentration of from about 5000  MU M to about 25000  MU M and, more preferably from, about 8000  MU M to about 12000  MU M.

    <p num="31">II. Process of Maintaining Neural Cell Viability</p>
    <p num="32">A medium of the present invention has many uses, all of which are related to the ability of that medium to prolong survival of neural cells or tissues in a low CO2 environment.</p>
    <p num="33">
      In one embodiment, the medium can be used to store neural cells or tissue.
      <br/>
      The cells, once obtained from any brain region, are placed in a medium and maintained under ambient CO2 conditions.
      <br/>
      By way of example, tissue from the central nervous system can be placed in a medium of the present invention and stored at reduced temperature (e.g., 2 (degree)  C. to 15 (degree)  C.) The storage of neural cells or tissue is useful both in preparing such cells for experimental procedures and for maintaining cells prior to transplantation or implantation for therapeutic purposes.
      <br/>
      Exemplary such uses include ex vivo gene therapy, repair of damaged circuits, clonal expression and proliferating autologous or heterologous cells for transplant.
    </p>
    <p num="34">
      A medium of the present invention can also be used to maintain the viability of plated neural cells that are undergoing study or manipulation.
      <br/>
      Thus, for example, cells can be maintained under normal ambient conditions during electrophysiological examination.
      <br/>
      In a similar fashion, neural cells or tissue placed in a medium of the present invention can be transfected or transformed with expression vectors carrying gene inserts.
      <br/>
      Once transformed, those cells can be implanted into various regions of the brain as part of a gene therapy regimen.
      <br/>
      A medium of the present invention can also be used as a perfusate or irrigant for central nervous system tissue during central nervous system operations.
    </p>
    <p num="35">
      Use of a medium of the present invention has the advantage that neural cells or tissue can be studied or manipulated under normal, ambient conditions without exposing those cells or tissue to the deleterious effects of high CO2 levels and changes in pH.
      <br/>
      Still further, there is no need to continuously gas a medium of the present invention.
      <br/>
      Thus, use of a medium of the present invention results in substantial time and cost savings.
    </p>
    <p num="36">
      When used to sustain or prolong neural cell or tissue viability, a medium of the present invention is preferably supplemented with a growth-promoting supplement that contains essential fatty acids, hormones and anti-oxidants needed for growth of the particular neural cells being cultured.
      <br/>
      Such growth-promoting media are well known in the art.
      <br/>
      By way of example, the present inventor has formulated a growth-promoting media for use with embryonic rat hippocampal cells.
      <br/>
      That medium is designated B27 and is commercially available from GIBCO/Life Technologies, Inc., Gaithersburg, Md.
      <br/>
      The growth promoting supplement, B27, contains essential fatty acids, hormones and anti-oxidants in amounts that optimize embryonic hippocampal neuron growth.
      <br/>
      The fatty acids, hormones and anti-oxidants in B27 are biotin, L-carnitine, corticosterone, ethanolamine, D(+)-galactose, reduced glutathione, linoleic acid, linolenic acid, progesterone, putrescine, retinyl acetate, selenium, triodo-1-thyronine, DL- ALPHA  tocopherol, DL- ALPHA  tocopherol acetate, bovine albumin, catalase, insulin, superoxide dismutase and transferrin.
    </p>
    <p num="37">
      The present invention also provides a composition comprising neural cells or tissue placed in a medium as set forth above.
      <br/>
      The culture can further comprise a growth-promoting supplement as set forth above.
    </p>
    <p num="38">The following Example illustrates preferred embodiments of the present invention and is not limiting of the specification and claims in any way.</p>
    <p num="39">EXAMPLE 1</p>
    <p num="40">
      Two basic types of experiments were conducted.

      Culture was continued at 37 (degree)  C. in a bacteriologic incubator at ambient O2 and CO2.

      The plates were placed in a Plexiglas plastic box adjacent to open dishes of water for hydration.
      <br/>
      At various times, plates were removed for counting live cells by staining with fluorescein diacetate and dead cells with propidium iodide.
      <br/>
      Survival was calculated as the number of live cells divided by the total cells (live+dead).
    </p>
    <p num="43">
      The data in FIG. 1 show that HEPES, bicarbonate buffered Neurobasal (tm)  supplemented with B27 produced rapid loss of neuron viability in ambient CO2, with an LD50 of less than 6 hr.
      <br/>
      When this medium was more appropriately buffered and the bicarbonate concentration reduced, much better survival was obtained.
      <br/>
      This new formulation (See Table 1) extended the LD50 beyond 24 hr.
      <br/>
      Slightly inferior results were obtained with a simple balanced salt solution (Hank's, Life Technologies, Inc. -14060-016) supplemented with 0.1% glucose, 1  MU M sodium bicarbonate, 1  MU M pyruvate, 10  MU M HEPES, pH 7.3. Further improvement in viability was obtained with the use of anti-oxidants, essential fatty acids, hormones and other ingredients as in the B27 supplement.
      <br/>
      With the B27 supplement, full viability was maintained for at least 2 days in culture in ambient CO2.
      <br/>
      The LDSO was extended beyond 3 days.
      <br/>
      Developed axons and dendrites showed little evidence of neurodegeneration such as retracted or beaded neurites or swollen somae.
      <br/>
      These neurons after 3 days in ambient CO2 were comparable to neurons cultured in 5% C2.
    </p>
    <p num="44">
      Comparisons of viability and sprouting were also made for ambient and 5% CO2 conditions after one and four days in culture.
      <br/>
      After one day, viable cells in cultures started in 5% CO2 in B27-supplemented Neurobasal (tm)  were 63 +- 10% of those plated (mean +- S.D., n=12) and 54 +- 9% of these had neurite sprouts greater than one cell diameter.
      <br/>
      In ambient CO2 and the B27-supplemented medium of Table 1, viability on day 1 was reduced to 50 +- 7% (p&lt;0.05) and sprouting was reduced to 22 +- 12% (p&lt;0.001).
      <br/>
      After 4 days, all cells were dead in the B27-supplemented medium of Table 1 in ambient CO2 while normal culture in B27-supplemented Neurobasal (tm)  in 5% CO2 produced 71% viability.
      <br/>
      These data show that hippocampal neurons need a start in 5% CO2 to remain healthy.
    </p>
    <p num="45">
      In the second type of experiment, hippocampi were dissected as usual, but placed in 2 ml of the medium of Table 1 supplemented with B27 in a 15 ml centrifuge tube (Corning, Oneonta, N.Y.).
      <br/>
      The tube was placed in a refrigerator at 8 (degree)  C. At various times, the tube was removed to a laminar flow hood at room temperature.
      <br/>
      One ml of the medium was removed and saved.
      <br/>
      The hippocampus in 1 ml medium was triturated by mild suction and expulsion 10 times (or until most pieces of tissue are dispersed) through the plastic tip of a 1 ml pipettor (Gilson, Middleton, Wis.).
      <br/>
      The volume was returned to 2 ml with the original medium.
      <br/>
      After letting undispersed pieces settle for 3 min., the supernatant was transferred and centrifuged for 1 min. at 200 * G. The supernatant was discarded.
      <br/>
      To loosen the pellet, the tube was agitated by hand before resuspension in 1 ml of B27-supplemented Neurobasal (tm)  medium.
      <br/>
      After counting cells that excluded 0.2% trypan blue, cells were plated and cultured as above.
    </p>
    <p num="46">
      The data in FIG. 2 show that hippocampal tissue can be stored for at least one month in the refrigerator before losing half of the surviving cells, measured after 4 days in normal culture at 5% CO2.
      <br/>
      These results are superior to prior studies reporting good survival after one week of storage, but little, if any, survival after 4 weeks in a low sodium, low calcium medium (Kawamoto et al, Brain Res., 384:84-93, 1986).
      <br/>
      Another medium sometimes used for trituration and storage is Leibovitz's L-15, a medium with high concentrations of amino acids (Leibovitz, Amr. J. Hyg., 78:173-180, 1963).
      <br/>
      The data show that the use of a medium of the present invention is superior to L-15 for refrigerated viable storage of hippocampal tissue.
      <br/>
      The yield of viable cells after 1 week of tissue hibernation in B27-supplemented medium of Table 1 was 1.3.+- 0 (slashed zero) 3 million cells/hippocampus (mean +- S.E., n=6).
      <br/>
      This is comparable to cell yields from fresh tissue.
