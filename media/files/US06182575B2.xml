      The invention relates to adjustable stop-wagon retarders with locking function for wagons at high speed and disposal methods thereof, which are suitable for railway marshaling yards or rail lines where it is required to prevent wagons from running away, which are hydraulic equipment of no external energy source to automatically regulate wagon's speed and disposal methods of such equipment.
      <br/>
      The stop-wagon retarder is characterized in that a uni-directional return unit comprising a sealing valve plate and adjustable throttle valve, and a locking control valve composing of switch valve and positioning unit are mounted in the piston assembly, which make the returning speed and the locking speed for wagon at high speed adjustable, thus the aim of setting the retarder with different control levels and thresholds according to the wagon speed is realized.
      <br/>
      The disposal method is characterized in that the distances between every two adjacent stop-wagon retarders correspond to the distances between every two adjacent wheel axles.

    <heading>FIELD OF INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="1">The invention relates to adjustable stop-wagon retarders with locking function for wagons at high speed and disposal methods thereof, which are suitable for railway marshaling yards or rail lines where it is required to prevent wagons from running away, and more particularly, to adjustable stop-wagon retarders which are hydraulic equipment of no external energy source, mounted on the track to automatically regulate wagon's speed and disposal methods of such equipment.</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">
      A multifunctional stop-wagon retarder for railway wagon is disclosed in Chinese Pat.
      <br/>
      No. ZL92232912.5. This retarder can reduce the speed of a wagon, stop a wagon, or prevent a stalled wagon from running away.
      <br/>
      And it will do work on a wagon at low speed, and be locked by a wagon at high speed.
      <br/>
      However, the retarder has disadvantages.
      <br/>
      The structure of its uni-directional return unit makes the normal returning speed of sliding cylinder unadjustable and therefore, the retarder can not have different control levels.
      <br/>
      The term "control level" means the time necessary for the sliding cylinder of the stop-wagon retarder to return to its original position after it is deflected downwards by a wheel of the wagon.
      <br/>
      It's locking control valve can not regulate the locking speed and different thresholds for controlling the locking speed can not be set.
      <br/>
      The connection mode of the positioning unit is complicated and its components are liable to come off, which affects locking precision.
      <br/>
      And the exhaust hole located rather low in the housing harms its water prevention performance.
      <br/>
      In addition, existing disposal method for stop-wagon retarders adopts centralized method to dispose large retarder group which can not achieve good retardation on wagons.

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="21">Embodiment 1</p>
    <p num="22">
      In Embodiment 1, a sealing valve plate 12 that form part of a uni-directional returning unit, and a pressure valve seat 13 that are mounted coaxially on the top of a piston 3, leaving an adjustable gap h between the sealing valve plate 12 and the pressure valve seat 13.
      <br/>
      An adjustable throttle valve is mounted under the valve plate 12, forming a passage through the head of the piston 3 in the axial direction.
      <br/>
      The adjustable throttle valve comprise a step-shaped throttle orifice 9 having coaxially a larger diameter upper section and a smaller diameter lower section, and therefore a shoulder being formed therebetween; a steel ball 10 disposed on the shoulder in the step-shaped orifice 9; and a compression spring 11 disposed in the throttle orifice 9 between the steel ball 10 and the sealing valve plate 12, biasing the steel ball 10 towards the shoulder (FIGS. 2 and 4).
    </p>
    <p num="23">
      Between the piston head 3 and the sealing gland 2, a locking control valve is installed around the piston and can rotate around the axis.
      <br/>
      Its rotation angle is limited by a positioning unit.
      <br/>
      A switch valve 24 is of integral structure, including at least one locking oblique 16, an unlocking oblique 17, at least one flowing orifice 14 and a leaking orifice 15.
      <br/>
      And the positioning unit comprises positioning locks 25, 26 and 27 located on the switch valve and positioning recesses 28 and 29 on the piston.
      <br/>
      When the locking control valve rotates around the axis clockwise or anti-clockwise, the flowing orifice 14 on the switch valve will accordingly open to or shut off from the throttle orifice 9 of the adjustable throttle valve, that is, in the unlock or lock positions (FIG. 2, FIG. 7 FIG. 8 and FIG. 9).
      <br/>
      Each set of positioning unit has one positioning lock and two positioning recesses.
      <br/>
      The positioning lock is formed by a positioning steel ball 25, a positioning spring 26 and spring seat 27 which are mounted inside a radial positioning orifice 30 of the switch valve 24 in sequence.
      <br/>
      The spring seat 27 is fastened in the switch valve 24.
      <br/>
      The shape and location of positioning recesses 28 and 29 that are arranged on the same cycle around the piston, match with the positioning steel ball 25, and the pitch between the positioning recesses ensures that the flowing orifice 14 can fully open to or shut off from the throttle orifice 9 of the adjustable throttle valve, when the locking control valve rotates around the axis clockwise or anti-clockwise (FIG. 3 and FIG. 2).
    </p>
    <p num="24">
      The unlocking unit in this embodiment is of the basic structure in the existing technology, that is, it comprises a pusher 18, pilot sleeve 19 and a binding screw 22.
      <br/>
      In this invention, it further comprises a restoring spring 20 and a collar 21 to improve automatic restoring function of the unlocking unit (FIG. 3).
      <br/>
      An exhaust unit disposed in the upper part of the housing is comprises a sealing ring 4, a high exhaust seat 5, a positioning pin 6 and a high exhause pipe 7 (FIG. 1).
    </p>
    <p num="25">Embodiment 2</p>
    <p num="26">The structure of this embodiment is similar to that of Embodiment 1 except that the adjustable throttle valve only has a step-shaped throttle orifice 9 having coaxially a larger diameter upper section and a smaller diameter lower section, a steel ball 10 and a sealing valve plate 12 (FIG. 5).</p>
    <p num="27">Embodiment 3</p>
    <p num="28">The structure of this embodiment is similar to that of Embodiment 1 except that the adjustable throttle valve only has a step-shaped throttle orifice 9 having coaxially a larger diameter upper section and smaller diameter lower section and a sealing valve plate 12 (FIG. 6).</p>
    <p num="29">
      In this invention, the number of the adjustable throttle valves should be decided by the normal returning speed of the stop-wagon retarder, scaling up with the returning speed.
      <br/>
      And from the above Embodiments, it is known that increasing the adjustable gap h between the sealing valve plate 12 and the pressure valve seat 13, reducing the force of spring 11, and enlarging aperture of throttle orifice 9, can all enhance the normal returning speed of the cylinder; and in opposite ways the returning speed can be lowered.
      <br/>
      By regulating the above factors in a comprehensive way, the normal returning speed can be changed as required and the control levels set according to the normal returning speed.
    </p>
    <p num="30">
      The number of the positioning units in the locking control valve should be dependent on the locking speed of the stop-wagon retarder, scaling up with the locking speed.
      <br/>
      And from the above Embodiments, it is known that increasing the force of the positioning spring 26 or the depth of the positioning recesses 28 and 29 can enhance the locking speed; and in opposite ways the locking speed can be lowered.
      <br/>
      By regulating the above factors in a comprehensive way, the locking speed can be changed as required and the thresholds set according to the speed.
    </p>
    <p num="31">The following is a brief introduction to the operation of the adjustable stop-wagon retarder with lock function for wagons at high speed:</p>
    <p num="32">
      1.
      <br/>
      Retardation status: In the static condition, fluid in the upper and lower chambers of the cylinder 8 has equal pressure, the flowing orifice 14 on the switch valve 24 is open to the throttle orifice 9 of the adjustable throttle valve, and the locking control valve is in the unlocking position.
      <br/>
      When a wagon hit the retarder at a comparatively low speed, the wheel will press the cylinder head and the cylinder moves downwards.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the fluid in the upper chamber can not enter the lower chamber due to isolation of the sealing valve plate 12 and the steel ball 10.
      <br/>
      The cylinder will continue to move downwards and the upper chamber become smaller, till the compressed nitrogen forces the pressure valve open, that is, a retardation is exerted on the wheel.
      <br/>
      Then the fluid in the upper chamber will flow out through the pressure valve and a piston outlet 23.
      <br/>
      As the wagon travels at low speed, the fluid flows slowly and can not move the switch valve.
      <br/>
      The fluid in the lower chamber can flow through the flowing orifice 14 and the throttle orifice 9 to push open the steel ball 10 and quickly back to the upper chamber to restore the cylinder rapidly.
      <br/>
      And the same process is repeated for the following wheels.
    </p>
    <p num="33">
      2. Locking status for wagon at high speed: When a wagon hits the retarder at a rather high speed, the first wheel will press the cylinder and the retarder exerts retardation on the wheel.
      <br/>
      As the wagon travels fast, fluid from piston outlet 23 will rush to the locking oblique 16 on the switch valve 24.
      <br/>
      The impact is larger than the locking force between the positioning steel ball 25 and the positioning recess 28, and the switch valve is forced to rotate anti-clockwise, and the flowing orifice 14, the leaking orifice 15 and the positioning lock also move.
      <br/>
      Positioning steel ball 25 moves into the positioning recess 29.
      <br/>
      At this time, since the oblique 16 moves away from the piston outlet 23 and the fluid can no more rush to the oblique, the switch valve will stop rotation under the locking force of the positioning steel ball and the positioning recess.
      <br/>
      The flowing orifice 14 is now shut off from the throttle orifice 9, the leaking orifice 15 is open to the throttle orifice 9, and the locking control valve is in the locking position.
      <br/>
      The aperture of the leaking orifice 15 is so small that fluid from the lower chamber could only flow very slowly to the upper chamber, which means the cylinder 8 will be locked at the position lower than the top of rail and the retarder will not exert retardation against the following wheels.
    </p>
    <p num="34">
      3. Automatic unlocking: When the track is clear, under the pressure of expansion of nitrogen, fluid in the lower chamber of the cylinder flows slowly back to the upper chamber via the leaking orifice 15, the throttle orifice 9, the steel ball 10 and the sealing valve plate 12.
      <br/>
      The cylinder slowly moves upwards.
      <br/>
      And the sealing gland 2 moves up accordingly.
      <br/>
      When the gland 2 approaches the highest point, the top surface of the gland 2 will force the pusher 18 to move up.
      <br/>
      The upmost top of the pusher 18 will reach the unlocking oblique 17 on the switch valve 24 and force the switch valve 24 rotate clockwise.
      <br/>
      So the flowing orifice 14, the leaking orifice 15 and the positioning lock on the valve change their positions accordingly, and the positioning steel ball 25 moves back into the positioning recess 28.
      <br/>
      And under the action of restoring spring 20, the pusher 18 is automatically restored.
      <br/>
      The locking force between the positioning steel ball and the positioning recess make the switch valve stop rotating.
      <br/>
      The flowing orifice 14 on the switch valve is open to the throttle orifice 9 now, and the locking control valve returns to unlocking position.
      <br/>
      Thus the stop-wagon retarder is automatically unlocked.
    </p>
    <p num="35">
      4. Holding status: When a wheel stops at the retarder, the cylinder can not move upwards under the pressure of the wheel.
      <br/>
      Nitrogen in the upper chamber is compressed, which makes the pressure in the upper chamber higher than that of the lower chamber.
      <br/>
      And the sealing plate and sealing ring prevent the fluid in the upper chamber from entering the lower chamber, that is, the cylinder exerts a certain retarding force against the wheel for rather a long time, so that the wagon is prevented from running away.
    </p>
    <p num="36">Embodiment 4</p>
    <p num="37">FIG. 10 shows arrangement of the adjustable stop-wagon retarders with locking function for wagons at high speed, along a railway track so as to prevent Chinese 4-axle wagons from running away.</p>
    <p num="38">
      The retarders are symmetrically disposed on the inner sides of both rails of the track.
      <br/>
      The distance a between each pair of retarders is 1.75 m, the distance b between every two pairs of retarders 2.97 m, and the distance c between every two adjacent groups of retarders 6.9 m. In the central section of the track section where the retarders are arranged, 18 pairs of retarders are intensively disposed.
      <br/>
      The central section extends a length l of 11 m. A plurality of protective retarders are set at a distance of 23 m to the end of said track section.
      <br/>
      The above arrangement is mainly based on the fact that for the 4-axle wagons of the Chinese Railways, the distance between axles in each bogie is 1.75 m, the distance between the inner axles of two adjacent bogies 6.9 m, and the distance between the last wheel of the previous wagon and the first wheel of the following wagon 2.97 m. The number of retarders is calculated on the gradient of the track profile, the weight and quantity of stalled wagons and the traveling resistance of wagons.
      <br/>
      The purpose of the 18 pairs of retarders intensively disposed in the central section is to enhance the total braking capacity of these retarders.
      <br/>
      And for the sake of transport safety, protective retardes are set to prevent uncoupled wagons from running away when hit by the following wagons.
    </p>
    <p num="39">The disposal method according to the present invention is also applicable to other types of stop-wagon retarders or anti-runaway equipment.</p>
