    <heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="1">
      This invention relates to a connector assembly and an associated male connector assembly.
      <br/>
      The invention is particularly useful for, but not necessarily limited to, releasibly connecting flexible flat electrically conductive strips to circuit boards and the like.
    </p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND ART</heading>
    <p num="2">When releasibly connecting conductors such as wires of flat strips to a circuit board, the connector used is usually relatively expensive to manufacture.</p>
    <p num="3">
      Examples indicative of prior art connectors include U.S. Pat. No. 5,816,831. This patent describes an assembly for mounting electrical connectors on an edge of a circuit board.
      <br/>
      The assembly has a fastener that is typically a pair of molded blocks each having a rear groove and ledge.
    </p>
    <p num="4">Another example of prior art connectors is described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,846,094. In this patent a connector assembly comprising a molded elastomeric connector for connecting adjacent circuits boards is described.</p>
    <p num="5">
      In U.S. Pat. No. 5,281,166 another connector assembly is described.
      <br/>
      This connector has a locking arrangement comprising resilient fingers that engage apertures on a circuit board.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      The prior art connectors and connector assemblies are usually relatively expensive to manufacture.
      <br/>
      It would therefore be useful if an alternative connector and connector assembly was made available.

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="22">
      In the drawings, like reference numerals refer to like parts.
      <br/>
      Referring to FIGS. 1 to 3 there is illustrated a male connector assembly 1 comprising a rigid former 2 and a foldable substrate 3 in the form of a flexible support encapsulating and supporting elongate electrical conductors in the form of leads 4.
      <br/>
      The leads 4 are each electrically coupled to a respective electrical contact in the form of elongate connector pads 5 that are coated with solder and therefore slightly protrude from substrate 3.
      <br/>
      The substrate 3 is folded adjacent one end by use of weakened sections 6,7 that provide respective corner bends 8,9.
      <br/>
      The substrate 3 is folded and mounted to the former 2 by an adhesive applied to two inwardly facing surfaces 11,12 of the substrate 2 that abut former 2.
    </p>
    <p num="23">
      The folding and mounting of substrate 3 to former 2 provides a connector portion 13 of said substrate 3.
      <br/>
      Associated with an outer facing surface 14 of the connector portion 13 are mounting pads 15 with respective spherical solder deposits 16 protruding therefrom.
      <br/>
      As illustrated, the foldable substrate 3 comprises two parts 3a,3b with leads 4 sandwiched and covered therebetween.
      <br/>
      However, the leads 4 are uncovered at the connector portion 13 to provide the elongate connector pads 5 that are associated with an opposite outer facing surface to the surface associated with said mounting pads 15.
    </p>
    <p num="24">
      In FIG. 4 there is illustrated a connector assembly 20 including male connector assembly 1 in which the connector portion 13 engages a socket 21 mounted to a circuit board 22 by a solder joint 26 between respective circuit board and socket mounting pads 27,28.
      <br/>
      A wall 23 of socket 21 has recesses 24 that are complementary in shape to and engage with the solder deposits 16 to provide a relatively secure engagement of connector assembly 1 into socket 21.
      <br/>
      The socket 21 also has biased electrical contacts 25 that are electrically coupled to respective pads 29 by a solder joint 30 at an external portion 31 of the contacts 25.
      <br/>
      As will be apparent to a person skilled in the art, each pad 29 has an associated runner 32 on the circuit board 22 for electrically connecting contacts 25 with other electrical components such as transistors, microprocessors, operational amplifiers, resistors, inductors, capacitors as well as many other types of components.
    </p>
    <p num="25">
      As described, the electrical contacts 25 are biased and can move in a direction illustrated by arrow A, in a respective aperture in a socket wall 33, to allow the male connector assembly 1 to be readily inserted into socket 21.
      <br/>
      The biased contacts 25 allow for a suitable electrical contact with a respective pad 5 and also provide, in combination with the solder deposits 16 and recesses 24 secure engagement of the male connector assembly 1 in socket 21.
      <br/>
      However, a similar secure engagement and suitable electrical contact could be provided by the former 2 having resilient properties and contacts 25 being rigid.
      <br/>
      Further, a resilient former 2 made from rubber would also allow for the male connector assembly to be readily inserted into socket 21.
    </p>
    <p num="26">
      Advantageously, the present invention provides a relatively inexpensive connector assembly that can be simply released to allow maintenance or replacement of a circuit board.
      <br/>
      Further, the male connector assembly 1 can be manufactured without the need for complex injection molded components and the solder deposits 16 can be simply replaced if they are damaged.
