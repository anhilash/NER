      A method of forming a transistor includes forming a source/drain implant in the initial processing stages just after the formation of the isolation and active regions on the substrate.
      <br/>
      A dielectric layer is then formed on the surface of the substrate, portions of which are then etched to define a channel opening for the device.
      <br/>
      A uniform nitride layer is formed over the surface of the substrate.
      <br/>
      The nitride layer is then etched to create nitride sidewall spacers.
      <br/>
      Additionally, the channel region is then etched to remove the doped portions of the active region.
      <br/>
      A gate dielectric is then formed, the gate dielectric including a nitrogen bearing oxide and a high K material.
      <br/>
      A gate conductor is then formed upon the high K material.
      <br/>
      A silicidation step is then performed.
      <br/>
      In alternative embodiments, the source/drain region is not formed and the source and drain are doped after the gate is complete.
      <br/>
      In the embodiment, the gate resides upon the active region and etching into the active region is not required.
      <br/>
      In either case, with the channel opening created to be at a lower lithographic limit, the gate conductor has a width less than the lower lithographic limit.

      <br/>
      Field of the Invention
    </p>
    <p num="2">The present invention relates generally to integrated circuit manufacture; and more particularly to a method of manufacture and a structure in which a gate conductor is formed in a scaled device that has a width less than that obtainable by a minimum lithographic feature size.</p>
    <p num="3">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
    <p num="4">
      The structure and the various components, or features, of a metal oxide semiconductor (MOS) devices are generally well known.
      <br/>
      A MOS transistor typically includes a substrate material onto which a gate dielectric and a patterned gate conductor are formed.
      <br/>
      The gate conductor serves to self-align impurities forwarded into the substrate on opposite sides of the gate conductor.
      <br/>
      The impurities placed into the substrate define a junction region, also known as source and drain regions.
      <br/>
      The gate conductor is patterned from a layer of polysilicon using various lithography techniques.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      A typical n-channel MOS transistor employs N-type junctions placed into a P-type substrate.
      <br/>
      Conversely, a typical p-channel MOS transistor comprises P-type junctions placed into an N-type substrate.
      <br/>
      The substrate comprises an entire monolithic silicon wafer, of which, a portion of the substrate known as a "well" exists.
      <br/>
      The well is doped opposite the substrate so that it can accommodate junctions of an impurity type opposite the junction in the non-well areas.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, wells are often employed when both N-type and P-type transistors (i.e., Complementary MOS, "CMOS") are needed.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      A common trend in modern integrated circuit manufacture is to produce transistors having feature sizes as small as possible.
      <br/>
      To achieve a high density integrated circuit, features such as the gate conductors, source and drain junctions, and interconnects to the junctions must be made as small as possible.
      <br/>
      Many modern day processes employ features which have as small as 0.20 microns critical dimensions.
      <br/>
      As feature sizes decrease, the size of the resulting transistors as well as the interconnections between transistors also decrease.
      <br/>
      Smaller transistor size allows more transistors to be placed on a single monolithic substrate, thereby allowing relatively large circuit systems to be incorporated on a single and relatively small die area.
      <br/>
      Further, smaller transistors typically have lower turn-on threshold voltages, faster switching speeds and consume less power in their operation.
      <br/>
      These features in combination allow for higher speed integrated circuits to be constructed that have greater processing capabilities and that produce less heat.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      The benefits of high-density circuits can only be realized if advanced processing techniques are used.
      <br/>
      For example, semiconductor process engineers and researchers often study the benefits of electron beam lithography and x-ray lithography to achieve the higher resolutions needed for submicron features.
      <br/>
      To some extent, wet etch has given way to a more advanced anisotropic (dry etch) technique.
      <br/>
      Further, silicides and polycides have replaced higher resistivity contact structures mostly due to the lower resistivity needed when a smaller contact area is encountered.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      Many other techniques are often used to achieve a higher density circuit.
      <br/>
      However, these techniques must contend with problems resulting from higher density itself.
      <br/>
      Even the most advanced processing techniques cannot, in all instances, offset the problems associated with small features or features arranged extremely close to one another.
      <br/>
      For example, as the channel length decreases, short channel effects ("SCE") generally occur.
      <br/>
      SCE cause threshold voltage skews at the channel edges as well as excessive subthreshold currents (e.g., punch through and drain-induced barrier lowering).
      <br/>
      Related to SCE is the problem of hot carrier injection ("HCI").
      <br/>
      As the channel shortens and the supply voltage remains constant, the electric field across the drain-to-channel junction becomes excessive.
      <br/>
      Excessive electric fields give rise to so called hot carriers and the injection of these carriers into the gate oxide which resides between the substrate (or well) and the overlying gate conductor.
      <br/>
      Injection of hot carriers should be avoided since these carriers can become trapped and skew the turn-on threshold voltage of the ensuing transistor.
      <br/>
      In view of these considerations, certain scaling limits are being reached.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      Additional problems relate to reducing the channel length in scaled transistors.
      <br/>
      Because lithography equipment is limited to a smallest dimension, the channel length cannot be made shorter than the smallest dimension.
      <br/>
      Such channel length limitation has heretofore provided a lower limit on the shortest obtainable channel length.
      <br/>
      Thus, there exists a need in the art for a method of forming devices that have channel lengths shorter than the limits placed thereupon by lithography equipment.
    </p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="10">
      The problems outlined above are in large part solved by the transistor formation process according to the present invention in which gate conductors are formed which have widths less than the smallest dimension available using lithography.
      <br/>
      In such method of formation, a source/drain region may be first doped at a desired level.
      <br/>
      Then, a dielectric layer is blanked formed across the surface of the substrate and etched to form a channel opening above the source drain region.
      <br/>
      A nitride layer is then formed on the substrate and partially removed to leave spacers on inner sidewalls of the dielectric layer in the channel opening.
    </p>
    <p num="11">
      The source/drain region is then removed in an etching step to expose an undoped portion of the active region.
      <br/>
      Such etching step segregates the source/drain region into a source and a drain.
      <br/>
      A Vt region may then be formed in the channel region upon the active region.
      <br/>
      Thereafter, a gate dielectric is formed that includes a thin nitrogen bearing oxide layer and a high K layer.
      <br/>
      A gate conductor is then formed to create formation of the gate.
      <br/>
      The oxide layer on both sides of the gate is then partially or fully removed to expose the source and drain.
      <br/>
      Additional doping and/or annealing may be performed to create formation of the source, drain and LDD regions.
    </p>
    <p num="12">
      Creation of a transistor in this fashion allows the gate conductor to have a width less than that obtainable in a lithography step.
      <br/>
      Further, when the gate dielectric extends below a lower portion of the source and drain, short channel effects are reduced or eliminated.
    </p>
    <p num="13">These and other aspects of the present invention will become apparent with further reference to the drawings and specification which follow.</p>

      For silicon-based semiconductor circuits, the isolation regions 104 are typically formed of silicon dioxide.
      <br/>
      The isolation regions 104 may be formed using the well-known LOCOS growth process, trenching and filling steps or another isolation process.

      Continuing to refer to FIG. 1A, it may be seen that a dopant has been implanted into the active region 102 of substrate 100 so as to form a shallow source/drain region 106.

      The implantation of the dopant is performed at an energy level to only partially penetrate active region 102.
      <br/>
      Resultantly, the source/drain region 106 is shallow and does not extend to the full depth of the active region 102 or to the depth of the isolation regions 104.
      <br/>
      In order to achieve the shallow doping of the dopant, it is implanted with an energy of 2 to 10 Kev and with a dose of 8 * 10e15 ions/cm2.
      <br/>
      In the described embodiment of the invention, the dopant is arsenic and the active region 102 is formed of a P-type material.
      <br/>
      Thus, the described structure will form NMOS devices.

      The arsenic is, in the embodiment, implanted to a depth of 200 Angstroms.

      Alternatively, the doping may be performed with an dose of 2 * 10e14 to 8 * 10e14 ions/cm2 to achieve a lighter doping level.

      In such case, as will be described further herein, the dopant serves to commence formation of lightly doped drain (LDD) regions.

      Optionally, and after the active region 102 is doped, the surface of the active region 102 may be subjected to a silicidation step using standard techniques to improve the bulk conductivity of the surface of the active region 102.

      In other embodiments, however, the dielectric layer 108 may be formed of other materials as well that do not react with the source/drain region 106.

      After the dielectric layer 108 is formed, a patterned mask is formed on top of dielectric layer 108 and the dielectric layer is anisotropically etched to form a channel opening 110.

      In one embodiment, the patterned mask 132 is formed by depositing a photoresist across the exposed surface of the dielectric layer 108 and exposing the photoresist photolithography step.
      <br/>
      Then, the exposed portions of the photoresist are stripped in an ashing process.
      <br/>
      Of course, the patterned mask 132 may be formed using other techniques as well.

      Once the patterned mask is formed (not shown herein), the unprotected portion of the dielectric layer is anisotropically etched to the source/drain region 106 as may be seen in FIG. 1B. The width of the channel opening 110 after the etching process is, in the described embodiment, approximately 2000 Angstroms (which corresponds, in the present embodiment, to a minimum size obtainable in the lithography step used to pattern the patterned mask).

      Accordingly, if the doping is lighter and performed with a lower implant energy, the etched depth is less.
      <br/>
      One effect of etching the doped portion to reach the exposed undoped portion is to partition the doped source/drain region 106 into separate source 202 and drain 204.

      Next, if the source 202 and drain 204 were not previously subjected to a silicidation step, they may be subjected to such silicidation step (step 518).

      FIG. 6 is a partial cross sectional diagram of a transistor which has been formed according to the present invention and that illustrates in detail the components of the transistor and how the transistor can be connected to other transistors to form an integrated circuit.
      <br/>
      Referring now to FIG. 6, each of the components as discussed previously include the part numbers used to introduce the components.
      <br/>
      Vt region 210 is shown as formed under the nitrogen bearing oxide layer 212.
      <br/>
      Residing below the Vt region 210 is the channel 600 of the transistor.
      <br/>
      Note that the source 202 and drain 204 reside in a position above the Vt region 210, the nitrogen bearing oxide layer 212 and the channel 600.
      <br/>
      Such a construction causes the channel 600 to have enhanced protection against problems normally associated with short channels of scaled transistors.
      <br/>
      Also shown are a well 602 and a punchthrough region 604.
      <br/>
      As is evident, the transistor structure of FIG. 3C is shown in FIG. 6.
      <br/>
      Thus, no separate LDD regions are shown.

      In coupling the transistor to other transistors and other devices in an integrated circuit, an insulation layer 608 is formed in a CVD process upon the transistor and other portions of the substrate at a thickness that is required to isolate a first metallization layer 624 of the device of FIG. 6 from transistors and other devices of the integrated circuit.
      <br/>
      Typically, the insulation layer 608 is polished in a CMP process to form a planar upper surface.
      <br/>
      It is then masked and etched to form openings to the active regions of the transistors (e.g., source 202, drain 204 and gate conductor 320).
    </p>
    <p num="50">
      Once the openings are formed, a sputtering, deposition or evaporation process, by way of example, is used to fill the vias with a metal.
      <br/>
      The resulting metallized vias 610, 612 and 614 are formed.
      <br/>
      Metals that can be used in this process include Ti, TiN, W and Al.
      <br/>
      The vias 610, 612 and 614 may be deposited in a same step that forms metallization layer 624.
      <br/>
      The metallization layer 624 is then masked to form a conductor pattern and is etched back to the insulation layer 608 to form the conductors 616, 618 and 620.
      <br/>
      An insulation layer 622 may be formed to isolate conductive paths 616, 618 and 620 formed in the metallization layer 624, particularly if a subsequent metallization layer is formed upon the metallization layer 624.
      <br/>
      Subsequent metallization layers (not shown) can provide further interconnections among the devices and external to the formed integrated circuit.
