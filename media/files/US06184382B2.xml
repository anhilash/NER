      As shown in Scheme 1, the preparation of N6-substituted adenosine derivatives of formula (I), begins with the reaction of the 2,4-dihalo-3-nitropyridine compound (II) with an amine of formula H2 N--X--(Y)a -Z (III) provides the 2-halo-3-nitro-4-aminopyridine compound (IV).
      <br/>
      The reaction is carried out in the presence of a tertiary amine or aromatic amine base such as triethylamine, diisopropylethylamine, pyridine, 4-dimethylaminopyridine, 4-methylmorpholine, and the like or an inorganic carbonate base such as sodium carbonate, potassium carbonate, and the like.
      <br/>
      Preferred bases are 4-methylmorpholine, triethylamine and diisopropylethylamine.
      <br/>
      The reaction is carried out in a polar aprotic solvent such as 1-methyl-2-pyrrolidone or dimethylformamide, an aromatic solvent such as benzene or toluene, a higher-boiling ethereal solvent such as diglyme or a hindered alcohol such as isopropanol or 2-butanol at a temperature of from about ambient temperature to the reflux temperature of the solvent.
      <br/>
      A preferred solvent is 1-methyl-2-pyrrolidone, in which the reaction is carried out at about 35 (degree)  C.
    </p>
    <p num="53">The 2-halo-3-nitro-4-aminopyridine compound (IV) is then reacted with the protected dihydroxyaminocyclopentane compound (V) using the reaction conditions described above to prepare the 2,4-diamino-3-nitropyridine compound (VI).</p>
    <p num="54">
      Reduction of the 2,4-diamino-3-nitropyridine compound (VI) to the 2,3,4-triaminopyridine compound (VII) is accomplished using methods well known in the art for the reduction of aromatic nitro compounds.
      <br/>
      Preferred methods for the reduction employ metals such as zinc, iron or tin in the presence of an acidic proton source such as ammonium acetate.
      <br/>
      Solvents are generally alcohols, preferably methanol or mixtures of alcohols and aromatic solvents such as toluene or benzene.
      <br/>
      The reduction is preferably accomplished at about ambient temperature.
      <br/>
      The nitro group is also reduced by catalytic hydrogenation, with platinum catalysts such as PtO2 being preferred.
    </p>
    <p num="55">
      The groups R7 and R8 are then removed using methods well known in the art to form the 2-N-cyclpentane diol-2,3,4-triaminopyridine compound (VIII).
      <br/>
      In a preferred aspect of this process, R7 and R8 together form a dimethylacetonide, in which case the acetonide is hydrolyzed with acid using any solvent which is stable to the acid.
      <br/>
      A preferred method of acetonide hydrolysis uses HCl and methanol at about ambient temperature.
      <br/>
      The 2-N-cyclpentane diol-2,3,4-triaminopyridine compound (VIII) may be isolated as the acid solution salt, for example as the dihydrochloride salt, or the acid addition salt may be neutralized with base to form the free amine.
      <br/>
      In a preferred aspect, the 2-N-cyclpentane diol-2,3,4-triaminopyridine compound (VIII) is isolated as its crystalline acid addition salt.
      <br/>
      In many instances, the properties of the 2-N-cyclpentane diol-2,3,4-triaminopyridine acid addition salt, including ease of crystallization, are controlled by the particular acid counterion.
      <br/>
      The counterion in the isolated acid addition salt is selected by treating the free amine with the desired acid, or preferably, by employing an acid having the desired counterion in the acid hydrolysis described above.
    </p>
    <p num="56">
      The 2-N-cyclpentane diol-2,3,4-triaminopyridine compound (VIII) is then cyclized to the N6-substituted adenosine derivative (I) by reaction with formamidine acetate, formic acid or the ortho esters of formic acid as described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,364,862 and 5,561,134 and Intern.
      <br/>
      Pat. App. No. PCT/US97/21439, incorporated herein by reference.
      <br/>
      Polar aprotic solvents, higher boiling alcohols and esters and aromatic solvents such as toluene have been employed for these types of cyclizations.
      <br/>
      Esters such as n-propyl and n-butyl acetate or a combination of one of these esters with ethyl acetate are especially preferred.
      <br/>
      The N6-substituted adenosine derivative (I) is preferably purified by recrystallization from a suitable organic solvent or mixture of organic solvents.
      <br/>
      Ethyl, n-propyl and n-butyl acetate and propionate are preferred solvents.

      10.5 g of KF, 3.2 g of tetraphenylphosphonium bromide, 33 mL of 1-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone and 130 mL of toluene are added to a 250 mL round bottom flask.
      <br/>
      The bulk of the toluene is distilled off at reduced pressure (80 mbar, 60-70 (degree)  C.) to remove residual moisture (110 mL collected), after which the slurry is cooled to 24 (degree)  C. under nitrogen. 10 g (0.052 mole) of 2,4-dichloro-3-nitropyridine is added and the mixture heated to 100 (degree)  C. with stirring under a nitrogen.
      <br/>
      After approximately 10 hours, HPLC analysis shows completely conversion to 2,4-difluoro-3-nitropyridine.

      A solution of 10.6 g (0.047 mole) of (R)-1-(3-chloro-thienyl-2-yl)-2-aminobutane, hydrochloride in 15 mL of 1-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone is added dropwise to the reaction mixture while holding the temperature between 5 and 0 (degree)  C. with a salt water ice bath.
      <br/>
      By the end of the addition, HPLC analysis indicates complete conversion of 2,4-difluoro-3-pyridine to the aminated product.

      The reaction mixture is cooled to 24 (degree)  C., diluted with 80 mL of ethyl acetate and washed with 80 mL of 20% aqueous ammonium chloride solution.
      <br/>
      The aqueous phase is separated and removed.
      <br/>
      The organic phase is washed with 40 mL of water.
      <br/>
      Following the removal of the aqueous phase, 24 mL of methanol is added to the organic phase followed by the addition of 27.0 g (0.35 mole) of ammonium acetate.
      <br/>
      The mixture is cooled to 5 (degree)  C. in an ice bath. 17 g (0.26 mole) of zinc dust is added in portions while maintaining the reaction temperature below 40 (degree)  C. This addition is exothermic.
      <br/>
      Following the addition, the deep yellow color of the reaction mixture turns a light amber color and a grayish precipitate forms.
      <br/>
      TLC analysis at this point shows complete reduction.
    </p>
    <p num="119">
      The mixture is cooled to 0 (degree)  C. and filtered to remove zinc salts.
      <br/>
      The filter cake is washed three times with 40 mL of ethyl acetate and the combined filtrate and washes are washed with 80 mL of water.
      <br/>
      Some additional inorganic precipitate forms during this process and is removed by filtration.
      <br/>
      Following phase separation, 27 mL of methanol is added to the organic phase, followed by 33 mL of concentrated HCl.
      <br/>
      The temperature of the mixture raised to 40 (degree)  C. The mixture is then allowed to cool to 24 (degree)  C. over 3 hours, after which HPLC analysis shows that the acetonide deprotection is complete.

    <p num="120">
      The mixture is cooled to 0 (degree)  C. and a solid tan precipitate is isolated by filtration.
      <br/>
      The reaction flask and filter cake are washed 3 times with 30 mL of cold (5 (degree)  C.) ethyl acetate.
      <br/>
      The solid is then dried in a vacuum oven (45 (degree)  C., 27 mm Hg) to constant weight (4 hours) to provide the title compound (22.9 g, 79% based on 2,4-dichloro-3-nitropyridine) as an off white solid.
