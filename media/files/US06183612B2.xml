    <heading>INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND</heading>
    <p num="1">The present invention pertains to a sputtering cathode with a flat plate-shaped target formed from at least one part and a tub-shaped yoke arranged behind the target with a center ridge and with magnets for generating an enclosed tunnel of arc-shaped curved field lines in front of the target surface, as well as with three sheet metal cutouts or groups of partial cutouts of magnetically conductive material inserted into the plane between the target and the end faces of the tub rim of the yoke, wherein two of these sheet metal cutouts or groups of partial cutouts cover the area above the end faces of the tub rim and the center ridge and the third sheet metal cutout or the third group covers a part of the area between the end face of the center ridge and the end face of the tub rim and all the sheet metal cutouts together form two gaps extending roughly parallel to the end faces.</p>
    <p num="2">A sputtering cathode is known from U.S. Pat. No. 4,865,708, in which segments of permeable material are arranged between the target, on the one hand, and the magnet yoke, on the other, in the plane of the magnet rows, more particularly, underneath the plane of the front magnetic surfaces facing the target, in order to divert the tunnel of curved field lines forming in front of the target into a concave shape, in order to permit a wider erosion trench on the target and thus a longer target service life.</p>
    <p num="3">
      Furthermore, a sputtering cathode has been proposed in DE 196 22 606.6, with a basic cathode element with a plate-shaped target as well as with a magnet yoke arranged behind the target, with two closed rows of magnets of different polarization arranged in an oval or rectangular configuration and mutually coaxial in a plane parallel to the target.
      <br/>
      In this known device the sheet metal cutouts or appropriately configured partial cutouts of magnetically conductive material are inserted into the plane between the target and the end faces of the magnets turned towards the target, wherein two of the sheet metal cutouts or partial cutouts have a frame-shaped configuration.
      <br/>
      The two respective arc-shaped sections of the sheet metal cutouts connecting the long straight parts have an edge profile departing from the circular, for instance, elliptical, parabolic or irregularly arc-shaped, so that the respective gaps formed by two adjacent arc-shaped sections have an irregular width profile.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      In addition to that, a sputtering cathode has been proposed in DE 196 22 607.4 with a magnet yoke arranged behind the target, with two rows of magnets arranged in an oval or rectangular configuration in a plane parallel to the target, with three sheet metal cutouts or group of partial cutouts inserted into the plane between the target and the end faces of the magnets facing the target.
      <br/>
      Two of these sheet metal cutouts or groups of partial cutouts cover the area above the magnets and the third sheet metal cutout or the third partial cutout cover part of the area between the magnets.
      <br/>
      All the sheet metal cutouts together form two gaps extending essentially parallel to the rows of magnets.
    </p>
    <p num="5">Accordingly, an object of the present invention is to arrange the magnets such that, on the one hand, a flat and particularly wide erosion trench forms during the sputtering operation and as optimal a removal of material from the target as possible results and, on the other hand, the area between the magnetic tunnels extending in parallel is formed as narrowly as possible.</p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="6">The above and other objects of the invention can be achieved according to the invention by inserting the magnets into the bottom of the yoke, in such a way that the side surfaces which face towards and the surface that face away from the target run flush with the top and bottom, respectively, of the yoke bottom.</p>

    </p>
    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="8">
      The sputtering cathode according to FIGS. 1 and 2 consists of a tub-shaped basic element 2, in which a likewise tub-shaped yoke 3 is inserted.
      <br/>
      The yoke has a ridge 5 dividing the depression 4 into two parts in the longitudinal direction and whose length is such that an oval cooling channel 6 is formed.
      <br/>
      A closed plurality of prism-shaped permanent magnets 7,7' are inserted into the bottom part of the yoke 3 such that their side surfaces facing towards the target and the side surfaces facing and away from the target 8 arranged above the yoke 3 run flush, respectively, with the bottom surface of the depression 4.
      <br/>
      The back surface of the yoke 3, and of 3 sheet metal cutouts 9,10,11 are inserted between the target 8 and the yoke 3, of which the two concentrically provided sheet metal cutouts 9 and 10 are constructed as oval rings and the central one as a strip-shaped sheet metal cutout 11 enclosed by the annular sheet metal cutouts 9, 10.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      Above the magnet yoke 3 with its closed series of magnets 7, the target 8 is arranged, usually also equipped on its bottom side facing the series of magnets with a target base plate (not shown in detail).
      <br/>
      The sheet metal cutouts 9,10,11 inserted between the target base plate, on the one hand, and the magnets 7,7' on the other, can also be composed of several individual partial cutouts.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      The three sheet metal cutouts 9,10,11 enclose two gaps "a" and "b" between themselves which can be dimensioned equally over their entire length or formed to narrow or widen over their length.
      <br/>
      Depending on the gap widths "a" and "b", the field lines 15,15',15" are diverted more or less strongly, so that a closed tunnel of field lines 15,15',15" is flattened and thus the sputtering rate is equalized overall and the target utilization is likewise improved.
    </p>
    <p num="11">
      Standard magnetron cathodes, consisting of a simple magnet arrangement (two series of magnets whose polarity is opposing) generally produce a sharply pointed sputtering trench.
      <br/>
      As a rule, this becomes narrower as it becomes deeper.
      <br/>
      An advantage of the invention resides in the fact that a magnetic field is formed that is different above the target surface and inside the target.
      <br/>
      The field above the target surface corresponds to that of the standard magnetron cathode.
      <br/>
      It runs approximately parallel to the target surface and escapes and enters on both sides of the target.
      <br/>
      A so-called roof field is created.
    </p>
    <p num="12">
      In contrast to conventional cathodes without sheet metal pieces inserted between target and yoke, a field is generated with the embodiment according to the invention in the target 8 that consists of two such roof fields 16,17.
      <br/>
      Thus the plasma on the target surface is divided into several partial plasmas side-by-side, whereby not only the center area of each half of the target is eroded to an increased extent, but also its boundary area, which leads to a considerable increase of the target utilization, since the sputtering trench thus turns out to be relatively wider.
    </p>
    <p num="13">
      For a structure of a sputtering cathode of the type in question, larger magnetic excitations are needed than for conventionally constructed sputtering cathodes, since a larger proportion of the magnetic flux is guided in the yoke and the sheet metal pieces and therefore not above the target surface.
      <br/>
      The entire flux density must thus be increased.
    </p>
    <p num="14">
      If the required magnets are positioned inside and outside (i.e., at the ridge and at the tub perimeter), the available space for the magnets is limited as a rule by the outer diameter; i.e., installed size.
      <br/>
      Only a limited volume, depending on geometrical conditions, can be used for the installation of the necessary magnet mass.
      <br/>
      Since the magnetic field distribution is defined, when the principle in question is used, essentially by the field exiting at the gaps, the actual position of the magnets here is relatively unimportant, however.
      <br/>
      Thus it is possible to integrate the magnets into the bottom of the magnetic yoke 3 without sharply changing the relative course of the field.
      <br/>
      In the bottom of the yoke 3, there is a relatively large amount of space for the installation of magnets.
      <br/>
      The magnets 7,7' are therefore installed horizontally into the yoke bottom.
    </p>
    <p num="15">
      An additional increase of the magnet mass can be produced by a combination of magnets, which are integrated into the yoke both horizontally and vertically or placed on top of it (see FIG. 3).
      <br/>
      In addition to the horizontal magnets built into the bottom, magnets 18,18' are placed on top of the peripheral rim of the yoke tub.
    </p>
    <p num="16">Since, in particular, no magnets are necessary on the rim 14 of the tub-shaped yoke 3 and on the center ridge 5 for the cathode according to the present invention, these areas can be formed particularly narrow, which leads to a better utilization of the target.</p>
    <p num="17">
      In addition, water cooling of the magnets can be better implemented in a cathode of the described type, without bringing the magnets themselves into contact with water (see FIG. 4).
      <br/>
      In order to protect the magnets 7,7' from the coolant flowing in the channel 6, the magnets 7,7' are covered with a sheet metal strip 20, 20' of a corrosion-resistant material forming a closed oval, the sheet metal strip 20,20' being glued, soldered or welded to the tub bottom 3.
      <br/>
      The outside surfaces of the magnets 7,7' are also covered by a sheet metal cutout 21 in the illustrated embodiment according to FIG. 4.
    </p>
    <p num="18">Further variations and modifications of the foregoing will be apparent to those skilled in the art and are intended to be encompassed by the claims appended hereto.</p>
