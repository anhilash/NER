    <heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="1">This invention relates to sputtering, and more particularly, to a method wherein sputtering target usage is monitored.</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">
      In a typical sputtering operation (FIG. 1), a target 4 of for example titanium is provided on an aluminum support within a sputtering chamber 6, and power is supplied to the target to cause it to sputter onto an object 8 such as a semiconductor wafer within the chamber.
      <br/>
      In such a situation, if it is desired that a pure titanium film be provided on the object, the sputtering is undertaken in the presence of pure argon.
      <br/>
      If a titanium nitride film is desired, the sputtering is undertaken in the presence of argon and nitrogen.
    </p>
    <p num="3">
      Typically, a sputtering machine of this sort has a kilowatt-hour counter which indicates the work undertaken in removal of target material.
      <br/>
      In a typical machine, for example, sputtering of an entire target of titanium to exclusively produce titanium film completely consumes the titanium target in 1400 kilowatt-hours.
      <br/>
      Meanwhile, the complete titanium target is consumed in 2800 kilowatt-hours for exclusive production of titanium nitride film.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      If a sputtering process requires both such films to be deposited on an object, the target will be exhausted somewhere in between these two kilowatt-hour values.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, if two processes are being run, one depositing only titanium film and the other providing a titanium/titanium nitride sandwich layer, the end of target life will depend on the product volume through each process.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      Typically, a sputtering machine has only a kilowatt-hour counter to sum up the amount of work undertaken, and thus there is no differentiation between one process and another to aid one in understanding how much target life is left.
      <br/>
      This understanding is important because the complete burning through of the target can lead to the ruining of product and also damage to the machine.
    </p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="6">
      The present invention is a method of monitoring the consumption of a target of, for example, titanium used in providing titanium and/or titanium nitride on such object.
      <br/>
      Initially, the process work in kilowatt-hours (Y1) is determined for complete consumption of the target when providing only titanium, and the process work in kilowatt-hours (Y2) is also determined for complete consumption of the target in providing only titanium nitride.
      <br/>

    <heading>DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading>
    <p num="11">
      Referring to the graph of FIG. 2, the extreme points of the line 10 indicate, as set forth above, that the sputtering of a Ti target to produce 100% Ti film requires 1400 kilowatt-hours of work (Y1), while the sputtering of a Ti target to produce 100% TiN requires 2800 kilowatt-hours of work (Y2), to entirely consume the Ti target.
      <br/>
      A combination of the processes (i.e.; part Ti deposited and part TiN deposited) indicates a linear relationship between the two points as shown in FIG. 2.
    </p>
    <p num="12">If the proportion of  (Equation image '10' not included in text)</p>
    <p num="13">is plotted against  (Equation image '11' not included in text)</p>
    <p num="14">as shown in FIG. 3, the plot 12 takes the configuration shown, such that as, for example,  (Equation image '12' not included in text)</p>
    <p num="15">increases,  (Equation image '13' not included in text)</p>
    <p num="16">will approach 1.</p>
    <p num="17">In order to derive a generally linear relationship based on the data of FIG. 3, it will be noted that if  (Equation image '14' not included in text)</p>
    <p num="18">(in radians) is plotted against  (Equation image '15' not included in text)</p>
    <p num="19">
      the plotted relationship 14 is substantially linear (FIG. 4).
      <br/>
      It will be noted that while the ARCTAN function is used to establish this substantially linear relationship, any function which would mimic this substantially linear relationship may be chosen.
      <br/>
      Thus, all such substantial equivalents can be considered encompassed herein.
      <br/>
      Combining elements of FIG. 2 and FIG. 4, if the work in kilowatt-hours ranging from 1400 kilowatt-hours to 2800 kilowatt-hours is plotted against  (Equation image '16' not included in text)
    </p>
    <p num="20">(in radians), a substantially linear relationship 16 is established (FIG. 5).</p>
    <p num="21">From the above data, the following formula can be developed.  (Equation image '17' not included in text)</p>
    <p num="22">where:</p>
    <p num="23">
      Y2 and Y1 are defined as above;
      <br/>
      W2 =actual second material process work;
      <br/>
      W1 =actual first material process work;  (Equation image '18' not included in text)
    </p>
    <p num="24">
      Prior to processing being undertaken, the indicated target life is the work needed to completely consume the target if the target is used only for providing titanium film=1400 kilowatt-hours.

      has a value which determines "Target Life".
      <br/>
      For example, assume that the process for sputtering Ti has been run for 300 kilowatt-hours, and the process for sputtering TiN has not yet been run:  (Equation image '20' not included in text)
    </p>
    <p num="26">Then, assuming that the process for sputtering TiN is run for 200 kilowatt-hours:  (Equation image '21' not included in text)</p>
    <p num="27">Thus, the use of the Ti target for sputtering TiN, needing more work than sputtering of Ti, results in an increased indicated target life from 1400 kilowatt-hours to 1925.69 kilowatt-hours.</p>
    <p num="28">Since the ratio of  (Equation image '22' not included in text)</p>
    <p num="29">changes as the process goes on, the target life as determined by the formula changes, and is updated on an ongoing basis to provide appropriate information useful to the operator of the machine.</p>
    <p num="30">The actual process flow is shown in FIG. 6.</p>
    <p num="31">
      Initially, Y1, the work needed to completely consume the target if only titanium film is provided, is determined.
      <br/>
      Then, Y2, the work needed to completely consume the target if only titanium nitride film is provided, is determined.
    </p>
    <p num="32">
      At this point, a visual display (FIG. 7) on the screen of a computer can be initiated, indicating a bar the length of which indicates 1400 kilowatt-hours, i.e., Y1. Then, the sputter process is run, and the work undertaken at a given point in time used in sputtering titanium and titanium nitride, i.e., W1 and W2, are measured.
      <br/>
      A visual display of W1 and W2 is provided on the screen, and the above-cited formula is used to calculate target life.
      <br/>
      Then, the visual display is updated to provide target life as determined by the formula.
    </p>
    <p num="33">
      Next, the visual display of W1 and W2 are compared with the visual display of component life.
      <br/>
      If the total of W1 and W2 is less than 90% of the component life as determined by the formula, the process loops back to continue running the sputter process.
      <br/>
      Then, the updated W1 and W2 are measured, etc., until again the point is reached wherein the total of W1 and W2 is 90% of component life.
      <br/>
      At this point, the sputter process is terminated, indicating that a substantial amount of the target has been used and the target should be changed.
    </p>
    <p num="34">It will further be understood that a mechanism can be readily be included to change the color of the bar from, for example, green to red when total W1 +W2 =90% of component life and can in fact include a yellow sector when, for example, 80% is reached.</p>
    <p num="35">
      Thus, it will readily be seen that a method for monitoring the consumption of a target is provided.
      <br/>
      This method is readily practiced and lends itself to the ready avoidance of burning through a target, causing the entire process flow to break down.
      <br/>
      Such method further provides for consistent and complete use of target material so as to minimize material waste.
