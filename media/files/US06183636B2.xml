    <heading>RELATED APPLICATION</heading>
    <p num="1">This application is a division of U.S. Ser. No. 08/774,735 filed Jan. 2, 1997, now U.S. Pat. No. 5,983,938 issued Nov. 16. 1999.</p>
    <heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">This invention lies in the field of combined faucet and filter assemblies.</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="3">Assemblies for filtering tap water wherein a water filter is arranged in the input pipe to a faucet are well known, as are arrangements where, for example, a faucet (a) is exteriorly connected to a filter, (b) incorporates a four-way valve including a filter by-pass, or (c) incorporates an on-off valve for a filter that is connected in the line for the cold water supply.</p>
    <p num="4">
      Prior art arrangements of faucets and filters appear to suffer from common disadvantages such as (a) they are relatively inconvenient to install, use and maintain, or (b) they require additional space (especially countertop space) beyond that required for a faucet alone, or (c) they interfere with the generally accepted appearance and function of a faucet structure.
      <br/>
      Also, special piping configurations and sink installation procedures are commonly required.
      <br/>
      Further, to replace a filter in such an arrangement, as is periodically necessary, it is typically required to use a cumbersome procedure that commonly involves tool usage, shutting off the line water, preliminarily somehow getting under or behind the associated sink, disassembly of various components, filter installation, component reassembly, etc.
      <br/>
      The difficulties, costs and problems that are associated with prior art arrangements of faucet and filters have tended to limit their sale, use and maintenance.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      An added complication arises out of the circumstance that hot tap water and sometimes even warm tap water, cannot be subjected to filtration using conventional filter media without damaging such media and/or leaching out into the water being filtered components of the filter media, thereby injuring filtered water potability.
      <br/>
      Therefore, only cold tap water (that is, tap water from a cold tap water input line) should be employed for pre-drinking filtration.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      In many regions, the quality of tap water continues to slowly deteriorate over time so that there is a progressively increasing need to filter tap water intended for human consumption.
      <br/>
      The art needs a new, useful and practical combination of faucet and filter that is simple to use, easy to install and maintain, and reliable.
    </p>
    <p num="7">The present invention fulfills this need and overcomes the above-indicated disadvantages.</p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="8">In one aspect, the invention relates to a new and very useful functional and coacting interconnected combination of faucet assembly and filter assembly that is capable of dispensing either a mixture of cold and hot tap water or cold filtered tap water.</p>
    <p num="9">So far as now known, such a combination has not heretofore been known, particularly a combination where the same valve means that is used for adjustably mixing hot and cold tap water for dispensing through a spout means is also used to divert cold tap water for filtration before dispensing.</p>
    <p num="10">
      In another aspect, the invention relates to a new and very useful faucet assembly that is suitable for use in the combination or elsewhere.
      <br/>
      This faucet assembly incorporates valve means which functions in either one of two operating modes.
      <br/>
      In one operating mode, the valve means functions to deliver hot, cold or mixed hot and cold supplied tap water to an associated spout arm means.
      <br/>
      In a second operating mode, the valve means functions to divert only cold supplied tap water to an associated diverting conduit means.
      <br/>
      Preferably, the valve means is an integrated, composite valve structure which is actuated and controlled by a single faucet-associated valve regulator means whose position determines in the one operating mode water flow rate and temperature of the delivered tap water and whose position in the second operating mode determines cold filtered tap water flow rate.
      <br/>
      The associated spout arm means preferably incorporates two separate spout means, one for tap water and the other for diverted, processed (i.e., filtered) and returned water, each spout means being preferably located at or near the outer terminal portion of the spout arm means.
    </p>
    <p num="11">
      In another aspect, the invention relates to a new and very useful filter assembly that is suitable for use in the combination or elsewhere.
      <br/>
      The filter assembly incorporates a unitary filter housing structure having a removable cap means at one end thereof.
      <br/>
      When the cap means is removed, a filter cartridge is easily and simply installed in the housing structure.
      <br/>
      Various types of interchangeable filter cartridges can be employed in the filter housing, if desired, depending upon user preferences, use conditions, filter availability and like factors; however, a presently preferred filter cartridge structure is provided.
      <br/>
      The filter assembly includes input conduit means for connection thereof with the diverting conduit of a cooperating faucet assembly.
      <br/>
      The filter assembly is adapted to receive diverted cold water from the faucet assembly, to filter this water and to deliver the filtered water for dispensing.
      <br/>
      Preferably, the filter assembly is also associated with output conduit means adapted to deliver filtered water therefrom back to the faucet assembly for dispensing from the faucet assembly.
    </p>
    <p num="12">
      The filter assembly and the faucet assembly coact in the inventive combination and are preferably located in laterally adjacent relationship to one another.
      <br/>
      Preferably, the faucet assembly and the filter assembly in the combination are both associatable with a sink or basin back deck or the like.
      <br/>
      Preferably, the combination of the filter assembly and the faucet assembly includes a common housing structure and the whole combination is preferably locatable centrally on and/or in the back deck or the like of a sink, basin or the like.
      <br/>
      The common housing structure preferably functionally interconnects the filter assembly and the faucet assembly.
      <br/>
      Preferably, the common housing structure aids in associating the combination with a sink back deck or the like.
      <br/>
      Preferably, the common housing structure includes interconnecting conduit means that connect the filter assembly with the faucet assembly so that cold tap water that is diverted from the faucet assembly passes through the filter assembly and, preferably, is then delivered back to the faucet assembly.
      <br/>
      Preferably, filtered water delivered back to the faucet assembly exits through the faucet assembly's associated spout means.
      <br/>
      However, if desired, a separate dispensing spout, a separate faucet-type dispensing valve, or the like can be associated with the filter assembly so that filtered water can be discharged, if desired, from the vicinity of the filter assembly.
    </p>
    <p num="13">The combination including the faucet assembly, the filter assembly and the common housing structure is preferably configured and adapted for association with existing standardized apertures formed in a sink back deck, thereby permitting the combination to be used with a conventional kitchen or lavatory or other type of sink, thereby preferably avoiding or minimizing a need for alterations in an existing sink back deck or in the preformed apertures existing in a sink back deck.</p>
    <p num="14">The combination of faucet assembly and filter assembly provided by this invention is inventive and replaces and avoids any need for the cumbersome and problematic arrangements of faucets and filters that are common in the prior art.</p>
    <p num="15">
      The inventive combination of faucet assembly and filter assembly is versatile and adapted for use in a wide variety of sink-associated applications both where filtered and unfiltered tap water are needed or desired from sink-associated spout means, and also where various mixtures of hot and cold tap water are to be dispensed.
      <br/>
      Preferably both the admixed hot and cold tap water and the filtered cold tap water are dispensed from sink-associated spout arm means.
    </p>
    <p num="16">
      Various valve structures can be employed in the faucet assembly, as those skilled in the art will appreciate.
      <br/>
      Preferably, the presently provided new faucet assembly includes a faucet body means and an associated new valve structure which is capable of receiving hot and cold tap water from conventional respective supply lines.
      <br/>
      Preferably, the valve structure is in cartridge form.
      <br/>
      Also, preferably, the valve structure is capable of operating alternatively in either one of two different modes.
      <br/>
      In one mode of valve structure operation, user-selected and controlled predetermined amounts of hot water and/or cold water are admitted, admixed (if both hot and cold water are being admitted), and then delivered to an associated tap water spout means.
      <br/>
      In another mode of valve structure operation, user-selected and controlled predetermined amounts of cold water are passed in the faucet assembly to an associated diverting conduit which is adapted to deliver this water to a filter assembly (or other location).
    </p>
    <p num="17">
      After water filtration in the filter assembly, the resulting filtered water is optionally but preferably returned to the faucet assembly through another associated delivering conduit and is preferably passed to a filtered water spout means associated with the faucet assembly.
      <br/>
      A tap water spout means, if desired, can be separate from the filtered water spout means (preferred), or these respective spout means can be combined into a single spout means, if desired.
      <br/>
      If desired, the tap water spout means can be associated with a spout arm that is separate from the spout arm that is associated with the filtered water spout means.
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      Preferably, the valve structure employs two stacked, preferably ceramic disks.
      <br/>
      The disks each have respective defined perimeter and surface configurations and defined apertures.
      <br/>
      One of the disks is laterally slidably and controllably movable relative to the other in preset patterns to predetermined positions by an exterior user-actuated and controlled valve regulator means, such as an actuator arm, lever means or the like.
      <br/>
      The various relative positions achievable between the disks determine at any given time such variables as (a) whether or not hot tap water, cold tap water or a predetermined mixture thereof is admitted into, and passed through the valve structure for dispensing from spout means, and (b) whether or not cold tap water is diverted from the valve structure for passage to a filter assembly for filtering before dispensing from spout means.
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      Preferably, in the inventive combination of faucet assembly and filter assembly, the faucet assembly is provided with an elongated spout arm that is associated with the faucet body means and that is pivotable horizontally about a generally vertical axis when in the installed configuration at a sink.
      <br/>
      The spout arm includes duct means and terminal spout means.
      <br/>
      The spout arm can have various structures and configurations.
      <br/>
      Preferably, the spout arm houses a first duct means that longitudinally extends in the spout arm and that terminates at the spout arm outer or distal end in a tap water spout.
      <br/>
      This spout may be, if desired, terminally equipable with a conventional aerator.
      <br/>
      Preferably, and in addition, this spout arm also houses a second duct means that also longitudinally extends in the spout arm and that preferably terminates at a distal end-adjacent spout arm location in a filtered water spout.
      <br/>
      The filtered water spout is preferably located in longitudinally spaced but adjacent relationship to the tap water spout.
      <br/>
      For user convenience, ease of use and to enable easy filling of a container with filtered water, the filtered water spout is preferably adapted for dispensing a filtered water stream at an angle which converges with the flow path of the water stream from the tap water spout.
      <br/>
      Such a spout configuration also enables a user to determine readily that filtered water is being dispensed.
    </p>
    <p num="20">
      Preferably, the spout arm is fixed to a sleeve at its inner or proximal end, and preferably the sleeve is pivotably located about the faucet body means preferably adjacent to but below the valve structure.
      <br/>
      Passageway(s) defined preferably in the sleeve are aligned with duct means in the spout arm and are adapted for receipt of water from a manifold in the faucet body means for spout dispensing.
    </p>
    <p num="21">
      Preferably, a single faucet actuator arm means is employed in a presently preferred faucet assembly and this arm means comprises an elongated actuating lever that has a unique type of pivotable movement capability.
      <br/>
      The preferred lever has the capability for a universal type of pivotable movement, and can be positioned at various user-selected and distinct locations.
      <br/>
      One class of locations results in the dispensing of filtered water only.
      <br/>
      Another class of locations results in the dispensing of hot, cold or mixed hot and cold tap water.
      <br/>
      Thus, a user can pivotably position the lever with one hand and thereby not only regulate and select the temperature and quantity of mixed hot and cold tap water issuing from an associated spout, but also thereby regulate and select the quantity of cold filtered water produced.
    </p>
    <p num="22">
      Various filter assemblies can be employed.
      <br/>
      Preferably, the presently provided new filter assembly incorporates a new and improved filter housing structure that includes a coacting case (or housing body) and cap that is adapted for use in combination with a replaceable filter cartridge or the like.
      <br/>
      The filter housing structure can be, and preferably is, mounted through (and in) a receiving aperture defined in a sink wall portion, preferably a portion located in the back deck area of a sink, basin or the like.
      <br/>
      Preferably, lower portions of the filter housing body or case, as the housing structure is mounted, are located mainly below the sink back deck and behind the sink basin so as to be in a space that was heretofore commonly unused.
      <br/>
      Concurrently, the upper end portions of the housing case extend upwardly from the adjacent sink portions and are provided with a removably associatable cap that is accessible from the upper or outer surface of the sink.
      <br/>
      Preferably, this cap is manually operated, a present most preferred arrangement being for this cap to be threadably and sealingly engagable with a top portion of the housing case and to be a closure that covers an upper end mouth defined in the top portion.
    </p>
    <p num="23">
      When the housing case is so mounted, and the cap is removed therefrom, a filter cartridge that is matingly associatable with the interior of the housing case can be inserted into and can be removed from the housing case.
      <br/>
      Thus, the filter cartridge can be changed by a user from above the exterior or upper surface of the sink.
      <br/>
      Preferably, a filter cartridge is manually deposited into and removed from the housing case while the cap is separated from the case mouth.
      <br/>
      Thus, a filter cartridge is easily and conveniently exchangeable through the mouth of the housing structure without the need for any tools or time-consuming procedure.
      <br/>
      Various filter cartridges can be used, but the present invention provides a new and improved filter cartridge structure which is adapted to be cooperatively associated with a filter housing structure of this invention.
    </p>
    <p num="24">
      The inventive filter assembly is preferably adaptable for internal association with the inventive faucet assembly in an embodiment of a combination assembly of this invention.
      <br/>
      This combination is preferably adapted to eliminate the need for any special plumbing beyond the conventional existing hot and cold tap water supply pipes (or conduits) for a kitchen sink.
      <br/>
      Conveniently and preferably, in such a combination, the filter assembly and the faucet assembly are associated together with a common housing means which is characterized by the feature that the filter assembly and the faucet assembly are preferably preliminarily functionally interconnected (or "pre-plumbed") before installation of such combination assembly at a sink or the like.
    </p>
    <p num="25">
      Conveniently and preferably in such a combination assembly, the faucet assembly employs a valve structure such that all fluid (such as water) flow controls thereof are substantially associated in one unit, preferably a cartridge type of arrangement.
      <br/>
      Various structures and/or configurations can be employed in a valve cartridge, but the present invention provides an improved valve cartridge structure which incorporates the inventive composite valve means with two stacked disks and which is adapted to be cooperatively associated with a valve body means of this invention.
    </p>
    <p num="26">
      Conveniently and preferably, movement of a valve assembly actuator arm means or the like controls fluid flow in the whole combination.
      <br/>
      Preferably, the valve assembly actuator arm means comprises a single lever although two lever arrangements can be employed, if desired.
    </p>
    <p num="27">
      In a preferred common housing structure, conduit or channel means extend between the faucet assembly and the filter assembly.
      <br/>
      Preferably the common housing structure includes an elongated shroud that extends over exterior upper and outer surface portions thereof.
      <br/>
      Preferably the common housing structure is adapted to rest upon and be secured to the back deck of an associated sink or basin.
    </p>
    <p num="28">
      The filter assembly incorporates a housing case that is preferably elongated, and adapted to be vertically oriented, when the inventive combination of faucet assembly and filter assembly is in its installed configuration in association with a sink.
      <br/>
      The filter assembly housing case is preferably generally cylindrically configured.
      <br/>
      Preferably, the access cover or housing cap at the upper end of the housing case is, when fully associated with the filter assembly, vertically adjacent to, but above, a shroud (or other adjacent combination component) of the common housing structure.
    </p>
    <p num="29">
      Alternatively, the filter assembly can incorporate a housing case that is preferably elongated, and adapted to be horizontally oriented.
      <br/>
      Preferably the housing case located above the associated sink, but is preferably completely covered by a common housing shroud when the inventive combination of faucet assembly and filter assembly is in its installed configuration in association with a sink.
      <br/>
      In this case, preferably the access cover or housing cap of the housing case is, when fully associated with the filter assembly, horizontally adjacent to the shroud.
    </p>
    <p num="30">
      If desired, the faucet assembly, the filter assembly and the interconnecting common housing structure can each include various other components as those skilled in the art will readily appreciate.
      <br/>
      For example, and preferably at a location in the common housing structure that is opposite to that where the filter assembly is located, a sprayer connector is preferably provided that is functionally associated with the faucet assembly.
      <br/>
      This sprayer connector is conventionally connectable with a conventional retractable spray hose so that mixed hot and cold water (or, if desired by a user, all hot or all cold water) from the faucet assembly can be fed into such hose instead of being discharged from the faucet assembly spout means.
    </p>
    <p num="31">The inventive faucet assembly and the inventive filter assembly can each be employed in other combinations independently of one another; for example, in other integrated combinations of a faucet assembly and a filter assembly, if desired.</p>
    <p num="32">Various other configurations, features, objects, aims, advantages, and the like that are associated with this invention will be apparent to those skilled in the art from the present specification, accompanying drawings and appended claims.</p>

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
    <p num="34">
      Referring to FIG. 1, there is seen an embodiment 20 of a combination of a faucet assembly 21 and a filter assembly 22 of the present invention (sometimes herein referred to for convenience as the filter faucet combination 20).
      <br/>
      The combination 20 includes an interconnective common housing structure 19 that interconnects the faucet assembly 21 and the filter assembly 22, that functions in associating the combination 20 with the back deck 34 of a sink 36, and that has defined therein interconnecting channel means (as described below).
    </p>
    <p num="35">
      As shown in, for example, FIGS. 2-4, the faucet assembly 21 is preferably comprised of cast, molded, and or machined metal or plastic (the latter now preferred) components.
      <br/>
      A presently most preferred plastic is "Amodel," a trademark of The Amoco Corporation for a brand of synthetic resins containing polymers and copolymers of polyamides and their derivatives.
    </p>
    <p num="36">
      Faucet assembly 21 can be considered to incorporate a lower body portion 23 (see FIG. 3).
      <br/>
      The lower faucet body portion 23 includes cold and hot tap water input pipes 24 and 25, respectively, and a sprayer pipe 26 (see FIG. 1 or FIG. 5, for example).
      <br/>
      The lower faucet body 23 is preferably and as shown extendable through a preformed aperture 35 (see FIG. 2) in the back deck 34 of the sink 36 until abutment of bottom surface portions of the common housing structure 19 with the deck 34 occurs.
      <br/>
      A hot tap water supply line (not shown but conventional) is connected to hot tap water input pipe 25 and a cold water supply line (not shown but conventional) is connected to cold tap water input pipe 24 (by threaded fittings or the like).
    </p>
    <p num="37">
      Sprayer pipe 26 is preferably (and as shown) threaded on the outside so as to threadably engage matingly a preferably (and as shown) elongated retainer nut 28.
      <br/>
      A retainer plate 29 slidably engages over sprayer pipe 26 and is placed between the bottom side of the sink deck 34 and the retainer nut 28.
      <br/>
      Tightening of retainer nut 28 presses retainer plate 29 against the sink deck 34 and thereby clamps the common housing structure 19 and associated components against the upper surface of deck 34.
      <br/>
      Optionally, and as shown, pipe 26 can be provided with a terminal lock nut 31 that is longitudinally adjacent to and below nut 28.
      <br/>
      The filter faucet combination 20 is thus positioned firmly in place relative to sink deck 34.
      <br/>
      Various means can be employed to connect a combination 20 with a sink 36 as those skilled in the art will appreciate.
    </p>
    <p num="38">
      The faucet assembly 21 can be considered to incorporate a mid-body portion 45 (see FIG. 3) with which the lower body portion 23 integrally connects.
      <br/>
      Mid-body portion 45 includes a generally cylindrical and cross-sectionally circularly configured and preferably unitarily formed manifold 40 (see FIGS. 6-10) which is comprised preferably of cast, molded, and/or machined metal or plastic (the latter now preferred).
      <br/>
      The manifold 40 is provided on its lower face (see FIG. 6) with the openings 291 and 292 of each of a pair of internally and longitudinally extending channels 41 and 42, respectively, that sealingly interconnect (by threads, adhesive or the like) with water input pipes 24 and 25, respectively.
      <br/>
      Thus, hot and cold water entering in respective pipes 25 and 24 can pass upwardly through connected respective channels 42 and 41 into what can be considered to comprise the upper body portion 47 of the faucet assembly 21 (see FIG. 3).
      <br/>
      The upper body portion 47 integrally connects with the mid-body portion 45 and the upper body portion 47 includes a valve cartridge 300.
    </p>
    <p num="39">
      In the common housing structure 19, a pair of horizontally extending, water conveying pipes 69 and 87 are provided that extend in generally spaced, parallel relationship to one another.
      <br/>
      Pipe 69 serves to convey (or divert) water from the valve cartridge 300 to the filter assembly 22, and, for that purpose, its distal (output) end connects sealingly to a lower port 74 defined in filter cartridge housing 71 (see FIG. 23, for example), and its proximal (input) end connects sealingly to an output channel 44 via opening 294, both of which are defined in manifold 40 (see, for example, FIG. 3).
      <br/>
      Pipe 87 serves to return (or deliver) water back from a sealingly connected output port 75 in the filter assembly 22 to a sealingly interconnected input port 295 in the manifold 40.
      <br/>
      Port 295 joins channel 83 in manifold 40 (see, for example, FIGS. 4, 6 and 10).
    </p>
    <p num="40">
      Circumferentially extending channels 82 and 83 are defined in axially spaced, adjacent relationship to one another in outer cylindrical surface portions of manifold 40 and extend circumferentially around manifold 40 (see FIGS. 3-5).
      <br/>
      Channels 82 and 83 are maintained in fluid tight relationship with respect to each other.
      <br/>
      Thus, manifold 40 is circumscribed by a sleeve 81 (see FIGS. 2 and 5).
      <br/>
      The respective upper and lower side walls of channels 82 and 83 respectively are defined by flange-like portions 91, 92 and 93 (see FIG. 5) defined in adjacent outer circumferential portions of manifold 40.
      <br/>
      Each such portion 91, 92 and 93 has an O-ring receiving groove 94, 95 and 96, respectively (see FIG. 5), defined circumferentially therein into each which an O-ring 66 is positioned.
      <br/>
      These O-rings 66 each sealingly but slidably engage inside surface portions of sleeve 81.
    </p>
    <p num="41">
      Sleeve 81 is connected functionally in one portion thereof to the proximal end of a radially outwardly extending spout arm 53.
      <br/>
      Preferably, sleeve 81 and spout arm 53 are of integral one piece molded and machined construction.
      <br/>
      Thus, arm 53 is pivotable with sleeve 81 about the axis of the manifold 40.
      <br/>
      The distal end of spout arm 53 is provided with a preferably downwardly opening terminal tap water aperture or spout 56 that is conveniently, conventionally, and preferably terminally associated with a conventional aerator 57.
      <br/>
      An exterior shell 88 (see FIG. 5, for example) is preferably and as shown included.
      <br/>
      Shell 88 is adapted to extend over and around exterior outer surface portions of sleeve 81 and spout arm 53.
      <br/>
      Shell 88 can be conventionally comprised of metal or plastic and usually has the exterior appearance of polished chrome.
    </p>
    <p num="42">
      Spout arm 53 is provided with a pair of internal ducts 64 and 65 (see FIGS. 2 and 5 for example) that longitudinally extend therein.
      <br/>
      Duct 64 communicates with the spout 56 at the distal end thereof, and extends through a bore 86 in sleeve 81 to connect with channel 82 at the proximal end of spout arm 53.
      <br/>
      Duct 65 communicates at the distal end thereof with filtered water spout or aperture 67 in spout arm 53.
      <br/>
      Spout 67 is located terminally in spout arm 53 in inwardly spaced adjacent relationship to spout 56.
      <br/>
      Spout 67 is also conveniently, conventionally, and preferably terminally associated with a conventional aerator 57.
      <br/>
      The proximal end of duct 65 communicates with channel 83 through a bore 89 in sleeve 81.
      <br/>
      In the combination 20, input tap water (whether mixed hot and cold, or either hot or cold) exits through spout 56 while filtered water exits through spout 67, depending upon the position of the elongated faucet handle lever arm 51, as described herein.
    </p>
    <p num="43">
      As shown, for example, in FIGS. 11A and 11B and in FIGS. 12A-12C, the valve cartridge 300 is here oblong in transverse cross-sectional configuration.
      <br/>
      The assembled valve cartridge 300 is mounted with a pair of conventional screws 401 such that each screw 401 extends through a different respective longitudinal bolt channel 195 (pair) in an ear 194 formed integrally on opposing sides of the case 380 of valve cartridge 300 (see, for example, FIG. 12B) and threadably engages matingly one of a pair of sockets 196 on each opposite side of manifold 40 (see, for example, FIG. 7).
      <br/>
      A preformed adapter ring 85 provides a peripheral smooth connecting junction between the top of cross-sectionally circular manifold 40 and the base of cross-sectionally oblong cartridge 300 and serves to convert the circular configuration of manifold 40 into the oblong configuration of cartridge 300.
    </p>
    <p num="44">
      Valve cartridge 300 in the assembled faucet assembly 21 has its side walls and peripheral portions of its top covered by a preformed valve cover 84 (see FIG. 5) whose lower edge portions contact upper edge portions of adapter 85.
      <br/>
      On the top of the valve cartridge 300, a dome-configured cap 54 is positioned.
      <br/>
      Beneath the cap 54 and over the valve cartridge 300 and also peripheral portions of the cap 84, a head chamber 43 is defined.
      <br/>
      The head chamber 43 contains the interconnective mechanism 365 between the valve component assembly in valve cartridge 300 and the elongated faucet handle lever arm 51.
      <br/>
      The head chamber 43 is defined under the cross-sectionally generally circularly configured dome cap 54 and above top portions of the valve cartridge 300.
      <br/>
      A snap ring connection 55 is provided between a top peripheral portion of valve cover 84 and a bottom peripheral portion of dome cap 54, thereby providing a close fitting junction between cap 54 and cover 84.
    </p>
    <p num="45">
      An opening 59 is defined in a top portion of dome cap 54 which allows for a direct connection of the distal end region of valve lever 370 of the cartridge 300 with the elongated faucet handle lever arm 51 by means of a retainer bolt 52.
      <br/>
      The proximal end of the lever arm 51 is provided with a preferably integrally associated (by molding or the like) cover 58 whose down-turned circumferential rim is in adjacent but closely spaced relationship to exterior surface portions of dome cap 54.
      <br/>
      The so connected proximal end of the lever arm 51 with cover 58 preferably completely covers the opening in dome cap 54 at any position in which it can be placed through manual movement of the lever arm 51.
    </p>
    <p num="46">
      Thus, an operator (or user) of the combination 20 can manually move the outer or distal end of lever arm 51 through a pivotable and rotational (left to right or vice versa) path and through a vertical (up and down or vice versa) path.
      <br/>
      The lever arm 51 distal end position along the rotational path regulates water temperature and the vertical path regulates water flow.
      <br/>
      The limits of arm 51 movement are preset for a given faucet by mechanical barriers or stops.
      <br/>
      Thus, the rotational path has one barrier on each opposite side which is achieved through contacting of barrier keys 387 by ears 367 on outer block 360 (see, for example, FIGS. 17A and 18A).
      <br/>
      The vertical path has three barriers as described herein.
      <br/>
      In what can be considered to be the normal lever arm 51 position, which allows dispensing of hot, cold or admixed hot and cold water, the lever arm 51 can be moved arcuately between the two opposite side barriers of the rotational path, and between the two successive uppermost barriers of the vertical path.
      <br/>
      The upper one of these two vertical barriers is fixed, but the lower one of these two vertical barriers is only a so-called soft barrier, which can be overcome through user-applied additional downward pressure on lever arm 51.
      <br/>
      Once the lever arm 51 is pivotably moved downward past this soft barrier, it can not be moved sideways, but only vertically downwards, until the lever arm 51 reaches or abuts against a final fixed barrier.
      <br/>
      In this lower portion of the vertical path that extends between the soft barrier and the final barrier, cold water only is diverted by valve cartridge 300 to the filter assembly 22, filtered therein, and returned from there to the spout 67 on spout arm 53.
    </p>
    <p num="47">
      Between the opposite side barriers and the vertical barriers, various possible positions for lever arm 51 can be chosen for a given embodiment of a faucet assembly so that the lever arm 51 can be considered to be infinitely adjustable between zonal end barriers.
      <br/>
      However, in the presently preferred form of combination 20, and of faucet assembly 21, the preferred positions of faucet lever arm 51 are such that:

    <p num="48">When the lever arm 51 outer (or distal) end is placed approximately perpendicularly relative to faucet assembly 21 in about a 0 (degree)  forward orientation with regard to its rotational path (i.e. so as to extend over the associated sink 36), and so is located in its downwardmost position (see FIG. 19, position C), the faucet assembly 21 dispenses cold filtered water only.</p>
    <p num="49">When the lever arm 51 outer end is raised upward so as to rest just above its soft barrier (see FIG. 19, position A), the faucet assembly 21 is turned off.</p>
    <p num="50">
      When the lever arm 51 outer end is raised further upwards along a vertical arcuate path, the tap water flow rate through spout arm 53 increases to a maximum (or full flow capacity) where the lever arm 51 outer end reaches its uppermost position (see FIG. 19, position B), here equal amounts of hot and cold tap water are being mixed together in and dispensed from faucet assembly 21.
      <br/>
      At full flow capacity, the lever arm 51 is at its maximum vertical inclination angle with the lever arm 51 outer end being approximately at its uppermost 0 (degree)  position with regard to its rotational path.
    </p>
    <p num="51">When the faucet lever arm 51 is moved upwards to a location where water flow occurs, and the lever arm 51 outer end is pivotably turned to its maximum left extent, only hot tap water enters and exits the faucet assembly 21.</p>
    <p num="52">When, correspondingly, the lever arm 51 outer end is pivotably turned to its maximum right extent, only cold tap water enters and exits the faucet assembly 21.</p>
    <p num="53">The internal changes concurrently occurring within the faucet assembly 21 with these movements of faucet lever arm 51 are explained below.</p>
    <p num="54">
      Vertically the valve cartridge 300 in faucet assembly 21 is located between the manifold 40 and the head chamber 43.
      <br/>
      Major components of this valve cartridge 300 are individually shown in FIGS. 11A, 11B and in FIGS. 12A-12H, and their relationship to each other is shown, for example, in FIGS. 5 and 13. In general, the valve cartridge components can be regarded as being stacked in a pyramid-like fashion.
      <br/>
      A base or cap plate 310 is provided at the bottom end.
      <br/>
      Then follows a fixed disk 320, a movable disk 330, a guide plate 340, and then a lever assembly 365.
      <br/>
      A lever assembly 365 includes an inner block 350, an outer block 360, and a projecting valve lever 370.
      <br/>
      These components are cooperatively engaged and encased as a functional cartridge-type unit within the case 380, which, as above-indicated, is mounted onto the upper end of manifold 40 with two screws 401.
    </p>
    <p num="55">
      At its bottom, the cartridge case 380 is closed by the cap 310 which is nestably received within the bottom opening mouth of case 380 and which rests in contacting relationship over portions of the upper end of the manifold 40.
      <br/>
      The cap 310 has an upstanding perimeter flange 318.
      <br/>
      The cap 310 is held in a fixed position in the cartridge case 380 by four outwardly projecting keys 311 circumferentially spaced about flange 318.
      <br/>
      Each key 311 matingly fits into a different one of four individual cutouts 381 defined in the case 380.
      <br/>
      The upper (inner) side of the cap 310 has two opposed keys 312 located adjacent flange 318.
      <br/>
      Keys 312 provide for a unique fit of the fixed disk 320 relative thereto.
    </p>
    <p num="56">
      The cap 310 has a plurality of ports 313, 314, 315 and 316 which are defined transversely therethrough and which are each aligned and sealed with ports 323, 324, 325 and 326, respectively, that are defined in fixed disk 320.
      <br/>
      These respective port pairs are maintained in sealed engagement with each other by flat (that is, cross-sectionally rectangular) O-rings 393, 394, 395, and 396 which line the walls of respective ports 313, 314, 315, and 316 in cap 310.
      <br/>
      Since these O-rings are each slightly wider than the thickness of cap 310, the top edge portions of each of these O-rings also fit into respective seats defined around each of the ports 323, 324, 325, and 326 in the fixed disk 320 (see FIG. 12C).
      <br/>
      The bottom edge portions of each of these O-rings provide a seal around, and in, seats provided about each respective port 141, 142, 143 and 144 respectively, on the upper end face of manifold 40 (see FIG. 7).
      <br/>
      Thus, cold water input pipe 24 is axially aligned with input ports 314 and 324 (and also with opening 291, channel 41 and port 142), and hot water input pipe 25 is axially aligned with input ports 315 and 325 (and also with opening 292, channel 42 and port 143).
      <br/>
      Similarly, channel 44 (leading to filter assembly 22 from valve assembly 21; see FIG. 6) is axially aligned with exit ports 313 and 323 (and also with opening 294 and port 141).
      <br/>
      Exit ports 326 and 316 are axially aligned with a conventional diverter 403 (and also with opening 293, port 144 and pipe 26), which sits in tap hole 402 in manifold 40.
      <br/>
      Diverter 403 diverts the incoming water either toward the tap water spout 56 via channel 82 and duct 64, or to the conventional water spray subassembly 140 via sprayer pipe 26.
      <br/>
      Diverter 403 is well known to the prior art.

    <p num="57">
      The movable disk member 330 is slidably movable relative to the fixed disk member 320 and disk 330 is positioned above, and in direct interfacial contact with, fixed disk 320.
      <br/>
      Both disks 330 and 320 are preferably comprised of ceramic material.
      <br/>
      On the bottom side of the a disk 330 (see FIG. 120) which contacts the top side of disk 320 two cavities 333 and 334, respectively, are defined.
      <br/>
      Cavity 334 serves as a mixing and connecting chamber, and, depending upon the position of disk 330, connects exit port 326 on fixed disk 320 with either or both input ports 325 and 324 on the disk 320, for the purpose of admitting either hot, cold, or admixed hot and cold tap water to the spout 56.
      <br/>
      Cavity 333 serves to connect input port 324 with exit port 323, which serves to route (divert) cold tap water to the filter assembly 22.
      <br/>
      Thus, the cap 310, fixed disk 320, and the movable disk 330 contain all channels for water flow and are the only components of the valve cartridge 300 that are in direct contact with water.
      <br/>
      The disks 320 and 330 are sealed together by pressure which is exerted on them by other valve cartridge 300 components when the assembled valve cartridge 300 is connected to the manifold 40 by the two screws 401.
    </p>
    <p num="58">
      Movement of disk 330 by lever arm 51 is mediated by a lever assembly 365, which as above-indicated, includes the outer block 360, the inner block 350, and the lever 370.
      <br/>
      Lever 370 is connected at its top or distal end to the proximal end of lever arm 51, and at its bottom or proximal end to movable disk 330, as described below.
      <br/>
      The inner block 350 has an upstanding peripheral lip flange 351 which fits snugly but slidably into a circular downwardly extending seat flange 382 in the underside of the shelf or top face 384 of case 380.
      <br/>
      Most of the body of inner block 350 protrudes through the lever assembly hole 383 in case 380.
      <br/>
      The outer block 360 slides over the upper face of the inner block 350, and makes contact on its bottom face with the top side of shelf 384.
      <br/>
      Thus, the lever assembly 365 contacts the shelf 384 on either side thereof freely and movably, and so assembly 365 can rotate inside the hole 383.
      <br/>
      This movability permits the rotational path of lever arm 51 to be achieved.
      <br/>
      This path in the present embodiment is an arcuate path of about 150 degrees, as below described.
    </p>
    <p num="59">
      The lever 370 is mounted through the cutout 353 in the inner block 350.
      <br/>
      Lever 370 is held in position by a retainer pin 371, which also firmly connects the outer block 360 and the inner block 350 through horizontal pin cavities 372, 362, and 352 respectively.
      <br/>
      This pin connection allows for a pivoting movement of the lever 370.
      <br/>
      Thus, the vertical up and down movement of the lever arm 51 is achieved yet this movement is arrested on either side when one of the wings 368 of the lever 370 contacts the bottom of one of an opposing pair of cutouts or slots 363 in the outer block 360.
      <br/>
      These arrest positions provide the firm barriers to the limits of vertical movement of the lever arm 51.
      <br/>
      A soft arrest position is provided on one side (see FIG. 13), where one of the two opposed lever wings 368 contacts both spring biased ball plungers 373 which are mounted on opposing sides of the outer block 360.
    </p>
    <p num="60">
      The bottom end of lever 370 is attached to movable disk 330 in a manner that allows transfer of all vertical and rotational (lateral and pivotal) motions from the lever arm 51 to the movable disk 330.
      <br/>
      To achieve this attachment, the bottom end of lever 370 is spherically shaped and fits into the spherical lever cavity 335 defined on the top side of movable disk 330 (see FIG. 11).
      <br/>
      However, because the movable disk 330 is preferably comprised of ceramic material, while the lever 370, the underside of the shelf 384, and also the inner block 350 are each preferably comprised of plastic material, a direct contact between these plastic and ceramic components would tend to result in relatively rapid wear.
      <br/>
      Preferably, such a wearing is prevented by covering the ceramic movable disk 330 with the guide plate 340, which generally has a shape that is similar to that of the top side of the movable disk 330 and which is comprised of plastic material.
      <br/>
      The guide plate 340 has integrally formed therein a cup-shaped cavity 341 which engages and covers the inside surfaces of the lever cavity 335 (see FIG. 13, for example) and which permits the bottom end of lever 370 to extend thereinto and freely rotate therein.
      <br/>
      Guide plate 340 has a nose portion 342 with a peripheral down-turned flange 343 (see FIGS. 11B and 12E).
      <br/>
      A nose portion 336 is defined integrally on the upper surface of movable disk 330.
      <br/>
      The nose portion 342 is adapted to overlie the nose portion 336 and the flange 343 is adapted to extend peripherally around the sides of nose portion 336, thereby to provide a cover for nose 336.
      <br/>
      The respective dimensions of the guide plate 340, its flange 343 and its cavity 341 are such that the guide plate 340 has no movement (or slack) relative to disk 330 when the guide plate 340 is nestably engaged over the movable disk 330.
    </p>
    <p num="61">
      Nose 336, clad with cover 342, fits into a guide cavity 386 which is provided on the underside of shelf 384 of case 380 (see, for example, FIG. 13).
      <br/>
      Shelf 384 has opposed internal side walls that are defined by a pair of laterally spaced upstanding guide ribs 385, integrally formed on shelf 384 (see, for example, FIG. 12B).
      <br/>
      As shown in FIGS. 14A and 14B for example, when the faucet assembly 21 is in its valve closed position, nose 336 is positioned so that approximately 50% thereof is located in the thus defined guide cavity 386.
      <br/>
      At this position, both of the hot and the cold tap water input ports 325 and 324, respectively, in disk 320 are sealed by movable disk 330, so no water flow occurs through cartridge 300.
    </p>
    <p num="62">
      Arcuate lifting and pivoting of the distal end of lever arm 51 vertically (toward the back of the faucet assembly 21) results in sliding movement of movable disk 330, clad with guide plate 340, toward the front of the faucet assembly 21, whereby the nose 336 moves over disk 320 toward the open end of guide cavity 386, until it arrests (stops) just before it reaches the end of the cavity 386, never completely leaving it.
      <br/>
      In this position, mixing chamber or cavity 334 defined in the movable disk 330 overlaps and thereby interconnects both of the hot and the cold water input ports 325 and 324 with the exit port 326 of disk 320, thereby achieving full admixed tap water flow, while simultaneously sealing exit port 323 of disk 320 (see FIGS. 16A and 16B).
    </p>
    <p num="63">
      By moving toward the open end of guide cavity 386, the movable disk 330 achieves more and more lateral flexibility, i.e. movability toward left or right, relative to fixed disk 320 which provides for sliding movement of movable disk 330 in two directions relative to fixed disk 320.
      <br/>
      FIGS. 17A and 17B show the position of movable disk 330 for full unfiltered cold water flow only, whereby mixing chamber or cavity 334 overlaps and thereby interconnects cold tap water input port 324 with tap water exit port 326, while simultaneously sealing tap water exit port 323 and hot tap water input port 325.
    </p>
    <p num="64">FIGS. 18A and 18B show the position of movable disk 330 for full hot tap water flow only, whereby mixing chamber or cavity 334 overlaps and thereby interconnects hot tap water input port 325 tap water with exit port 326, while simultaneously sealing filtered water exit port 323 and cold tap water input port 324.</p>
    <p num="65">
      Movement of movable disk 330 toward the closed end of guide cavity 386 progressively reduces the lateral slidability of movable disk 330.
      <br/>
      Thus, by the time that the nose 336 has entered about 50% of the guide cavity 386, no lateral (left to right or vice versa) sliding movement thereof is possible (see FIGS. 14A and 14B).
      <br/>
      At this position, the valve lever 370 has reached its soft arrest position (no water flow), as indicated above.
      <br/>
      Sliding movement of movable disk 330 beyond this position is achieved through manual depression of the distal end of the lever arm 51 further downward, and this movement produces movement of nose 336 toward the closed end of guide cavity 386 (see FIGS. 15A and 15B).
      <br/>
      This movement results in the diverting of cold tap water only because lateral sliding movement of disk 330 is prohibited by the ribs 385 and such diverted tap water flows in pipe 63 from faucet assembly 21 to the filter assembly 22.
      <br/>
      The water diverting cavity 333 overlaps and thereby interconnects the cold water input port 324 with the exit port 323.
    </p>
    <p num="66">Referring to FIG. 19, there is shown position A for faucet lever arm 51 when the valve in cartridge 300 is in the valve off position, position B for faucet lever 51 when the valve in cartridge 300 is in the valve on position with full flow of hot and cold tap water to produce a mixture of unfiltered tap waters, and position C for faucet lever 51 when the valve in cartridge 300 is in the valve on position with full flow of only cold tap water for diversion in water filtration.</p>
    <p num="67">The interrelationship between the components including the lever arm 51, the spout arm 53, the head chamber 43, the manifold 40, and the components of valve cartridge 300 (specifically, the disks 330 and 320), is such that the following water flow settings through the spout arm 53 can each be independently and separately achieved by positioning the distal end portion of the lever arm 51:</p>
    <p num="68">
      (1) No water flows from the spout arm 53;
      <br/>
      (2) Only hot tap water flows from the spout arm 53;
      <br/>
      (3) only cold tap water flows from the spout arm 53;
      <br/>
      (4) Only a mixture of hot and cold tap water flows from the spout arm 53, the water flow volume and the mixture ratio of hot to cold tap water being exteriorly regulatable by the spatial position of the lever arm 51 distal end portion; and
      <br/>
      (5) Only initially cold but interveningly diverted and returned processed water flows from the spout arm 53, the water flow volume being exteriorly regulatable by the spatial position of the lever arm 51 distal end portion.
    </p>
    <p num="69">
      When, in the operation of the filter faucet combination 20, cold tap water is being filtered, cold tap water enters the valve cartridge 300 from channel 24 only.
      <br/>
      Tap water is routed from cartridge 300 through channel 44 and pipe 69 and passes to the filter assembly 22 for filtering (as is below described).
    </p>
    <p num="70">
      After filtration in filter assembly 22, filtered water flows back through pipe 87 to the manifold 40 and moves from there through channel 65 to spout 67.
      <br/>
      Although various arrangements are possible, it is now preferred to have the filter return conduit pathway always open; this arrangement is preferred because it prevents the build up of water pressure in the filter assembly 22 when water is not being processed through it.
      <br/>
      Thus, for example, water will not spurt out of the filter assembly 22 when the cover 77 is removed for filter cartridge 73 replacement.
    </p>
    <p num="71">
      Since, in a contemporary kitchen sink, a faucet-associated spray hose is commonly and conventionally located on the right side of the faucet, in the preferred practice of the present invention, the filter assembly 22 is preferably located on the left side of the faucet assembly 21 as provided in the combination 20.
      <br/>
      However, various positions and locations can be employed for a filter assembly 22 of this invention and for a spray hose, as those skilled in the art will readily appreciate.
    </p>
    <p num="72">
      Here, the filter assembly 22 incorporates a filter housing 71 that is, preferably and as shown, axially cylindrical, elongated and adapted to receive through the upper end thereof a selected filter cartridge 73 which can be conventional, if desired, but which is adapted for seating cooperatively in the housing 71 in a functional position.
      <br/>
      Thus, as is further explained below, in assembly 22, when the upper end mouth 72 of the housing 71 is sealingly closed by a removable cover or cap 77, water entering the housing 71 at the entry port 74 from the channel 69 passes between the filter cartridge 73 and the wall of the housing structure 71 to enter the filter cartridge 73 from its bottom.
      <br/>
      After passing through the filter cartridge 73, the filtered water then leaves the cartridge 73 and the housing 71 through the exit port 75 into return pipe 87.
      <br/>
      As those skilled in the art will readily appreciate, if desired, the water flow through the filter cartridge could be reversed by connecting pipe 87 to the port 74, and the pipe 69 to the port 75.
      <br/>
      The removable access cover or cap 77 is threadably and sealingly engagable with a threaded top lip portion about the mouth 72 of the housing 71 as below described.
    </p>
    <p num="73">
      In the preferred combination 20, the filter assembly 22 has its housing 71 and cap 77 preferably comprised of plastic, but these components can be formed of metal, if desired.
      <br/>
      The housing 71 is preferably perpendicularly oriented and configured to protrude downwards through, and to be directly or indirectly suspended from, the rear deck 34 of a sink such as sink 36, so as to be typically behind a sink 36 bowl or basin compartment 76 (see FIG. 1).
      <br/>
      Preferably, housing 71 extends through a preformed standard hole 37 in deck 34.
      <br/>
      Servicing and replacement of a filter cartridge 73 is conveniently accomplished by manually removing the cover 77.
      <br/>
      Conveniently, the outer circumferential portions of cover 77 are ribbed, knurled or the like to provide a convenient and hand-grippable surface for easy manual removal and tightening.
    </p>
    <p num="74">
      The upper portion of the housing 71, which is located above sink deck 34, is preferably widened relative to the lower portion of the housing 71 by means of a circumferentially extending shoulder 104 formed in housing 71.
      <br/>
      This shoulder 104 fits through and seats in a tapered opening of a shroud gasket 155 at the bottom of a shroud 18 of the common housing structure 19 (for example, see FIG. 21).
      <br/>
      The lower portion of the housing 71 preferably has a diameter which fits through a standard opening 37 commonly provided in the back deck of a sink 34.
      <br/>
      At its bottom end, the housing 71 is closed by an end wall 97.
      <br/>
      Housing 71 defines therein a filter cartridge-receiving cavity 101, with preferably a wider interior upper portion 137 existing in the upper portion of housing 71.
      <br/>
      Various configurations and structures can be employed for a housing 71 and a cap 77.
    </p>
    <p num="75">
      Here, the cap or cover 77 has an axially extending perimeter flange 102 which is interiorly circumferentially threaded for disengagable engagement with the externally circumferentially threaded lip portion 99 of mouth 72 of housing 71.
      <br/>
      Like housing 71, cap 77 is preferably comprised of one piece, molded plastic construction.
      <br/>
      Radially inset from the perimeter flange 102 a sealing flange 103 is preferably provided which is generally in spaced, parallel relationship to flange 102.
      <br/>
      This flange 103 contains a circumferential groove 110 which seats O-ring 109.
      <br/>
      The upper inside surface of the lip portion 99 is slightly tapered in a funnel-like configuration.
      <br/>
      This configuration provides for a sealing engagement between this tapered surface and the O-ring 109.
      <br/>
      Thus, sealing means is provided between the cap 77 and the lip portions 99 for sealingly associating the cap 77 with the housing 71 when the cap 77 is substantially fully engaged with the housing 71.
    </p>
    <p num="76">
      The inventive filter cartridge 73 which is here employed is cooperatively associatable with the filter assembly 22 yet is conveniently conventional in internal construction (that is, the filter medium is preferably conventional).
      <br/>
      Cartridge 73 has a housing 111 that is preferentially comprised of a molded plastic and is preferentially configured to have external surface portions that align with internal surface portions of the housing 71 and cap 77.
      <br/>
      Thus, the housing 111 has a lower body portion 112 and an upper body portion 113 which are separated from one another externally by a circumferentially outwardly extending ridge 79 around which an O-ring 80 is seated in a groove.
      <br/>
      The ridge 79 is positioned such that the O-ring 80 makes circumferentially a sealing contact with side wall 98 of housing 71 at an axial location between the entry port 74 and the exit port 75 of housing 71.
      <br/>
      This location is such that the housing 71 and the housing 111 coact to provide two separate chambers within the filter assembly 22, identified as upper chamber 136 and lower chamber 137.
    </p>
    <p num="77">
      Below the ridge 79 the housing 111 has a plurality of circumferentially spaced, radially outwardly extending spoke-like protrusions 105 which circumferentially extend about housing 111 and which make contact with interior surface portions of shoulder 104 of housing 71.
      <br/>
      Thus, when the housing 111 is fully extended into and engaged with the housing 71, the cartridge 73 is seated in place between the underside of the sealing flange 103 of cap 77 and the shoulder 104 of housing 71, with the O-ring 80 being positioned as desired between ports 74 and 75.
    </p>
    <p num="78">
      At the lower end of the housing 111 cartridge 73 is provided with a plurality of input orifices 139.

      Circumferentially spaced about the upper end of housing 111 adjacent to the housing head plate 114 are a plurality of output orifices 138.
      <br/>
      The upper face of the head plate 114 is provided with a recessed, diametrically extending crossbar 115 that is adapted for engaging a fork tine or the like that is extended into the adjacent recess (thereby to aid the user in removing a filter cartridge 73 from housing 71).
