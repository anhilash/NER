      <br/>
      The switched-current fuzzy processor includes means for decoding a feature input into a set of binary feature signals; an array of MFGs, coupled to the decoding means, for obtaining a set of current outputs whose magnitudes are proportional to the values of the feature signals respectively; weight-adjusting means, coupled to the MFG array, for applying a predetermined weight factor in binary form to the output currents from the MFG array; summing means, coupled to the weight-adjusting means, for summing up each set of currents from each column of the MFGs in the MFG array to thereby obtain a total value for the currents therefrom; and a maximum-value determination circuit, coupled to the summing means, capable of obtaining the one of the currents with the maximum magnitude from the summing means.
      <br/>
      The foregoing switched-current fuzzy processor features that the circuits in the simulation unit are all based on the switched-current mode of operation without the need to use current-to-voltage conversion means, thus allowing simplified circuit structure and high precision in signal processing with high performance; and that the provision of the weight-adjusting and summing means in the switched-current fuzzy processor in place of the MIN-MAX means in the prior art allows the switched-current fuzzy processor to be adjustable in weight with simplified operation.

      Field of the Invention
    </p>
    <p num="2">This invention relates to fuzzy processors, and more particularly, to a switched-current fuzzy processor for pattern recognition which is specifically designed to operate in current mode for high performance.</p>
    <p num="3">2. Description of Related Art</p>
    <p num="4">
      A fuzzy processor is a logic processing means which processes logic signals based on conditional rather than absolute true or false states.
      <br/>
      The results obtained from a fuzzy processor are less definite than those obtained with strict classical logic, but fuzzy logic applies to a wide range of cases, such as pattern recognition.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      Most conventional fuzzy processors are based on a MIN-MAX operation.
      <br/>
      For applications in pattern recognition, the MIN-MAX operation is considered unsatisfactory.
      <br/>
      Other fuzzy processors are based on digital circuitry which is complex in structure.
      <br/>
      A type of fuzzy processor, called switched-voltage fuzzy processor, utilizes transistor switching elements to implement the fuzzy logic for pattern recognition.
      <br/>
      This type of fuzzy processor, however, has the drawbacks of requiring a large layout area to implement, a low operating speed, and a complex circuit structure to implement.

    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="6">It is therefore an objective of the present invention to provide a switched-current fuzzy processor for pattern recognition, which is specifically designed to operate in current mode without the need to use current-to-voltage converting means for the benefits of simplified structural complexity and high precision and performance in computation.</p>
    <p num="7">It is another an objective of the present invention to provide a switched-current fuzzy processor for pattern recognition, which utilizes a weighted summing operation with a variably adjustable weight factor so the switched-current fuzzy processor can be adapatively modified for application in a wide range of cases.</p>
    <p num="8">It is still another objective of the present invention to provide a switched-current fuzzy processor for pattern recognition which is fully compliant with the standard complementary metal oxide semicondutor (CMOS) technology for modular integration with very large scale integration (VLSI) integrated circuits.</p>
    <p num="9">It is yet another objective of the present invention to provide a switched-current fuzzy processor for pattern recognition, which is designed in a module that allows it to be easily expanded in functionality.</p>
    <p num="10">
      In accordance with the foregoing and other objectives of the present invention, a switched-current fuzzy processor for pattern recognition is devised.
      <br/>
      The switched-current fuzzy processor of the invention includes the following constituent elements:
    </p>
    <p num="11">(a) means for decoding a feature input into a set of binary feature signals;</p>

      <br/>
      Moreover, the provision of the weight-adjusting and summing means in the switched-current fuzzy processor of the invention in place of the MIN-MAX means in the prior art allows the fuzzy processor of the invention can adjust weight in a simple manner.

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
    <p num="18">
      FIG. 1 is a schematic block diagram of the switched-current fuzzy processor according to the invention.
      <br/>
      As shown, the switched-current fuzzy processor of the invention includes two main units: a digital unit 100 and a simulation unit 200.
      <br/>
      The digital unit 100 further includes a feature decoder 110, a sequence control circuit 120, and a weight decoder 130.
      <br/>
      The simulation unit 200 includes an n * m array 210 of membership function generators MFGij, for i=1 to n and j=1 to m; an array 220 of weight-adjusting circuits WACi, for i=1 to n, which are coupled to the MFG array 210, an array 230 of summing circuits SCi, for i=1 to n, which are coupled to the weight-adjusting circuit array 220, and a maximum-value determination circuit 240 coupled to the summing circuit array 230.
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      The logic operations of the switched-current fuzzy processor of FIG. 1 are under control by a number of clock signals L, CL1, CL2, and enable signals �C1, C2, . . . Cm �, Cin, and Cout, with the waveforms thereof schematically illustrated in FIG. 2 for the case of m=4.
      <br/>
      The clock signal L is a periodic pulse rain with a fixed rate.
      <br/>
      The clock signals CL1, CL2 are two pulse trains with the same rate as the clock signal L but appearing in a complementary manner in that when CL1, is at a high-voltage logic state, CL2 is at a low-voltage logic state; and vice versa.
      <br/>
      The four (for m=4) enable signals �C1, C2, C3, C4 � are each a single pulse appearing in a successive manner in synchronization with the pulses in the clock signal L. Further, the enable signal Cin is switched from the low-voltage logic state to the high-voltage logic state when the first pulse in CL2 appears and thereafter maintained at the high-voltage logic state.
      <br/>
      The enable signal Cout is switched from the low-voltage logic state to the high-voltage logic state at the falling edge of the appearance of the last enable signal C4.
      <br/>
      These control and enable signals are together generated by the sequence control circuit 120 and used to control the operations of the various constituent circuit parts of the fuzzy processor of the invention.
    </p>
    <p num="20">
      The feature decoder 110 is used to receive a set of original feature signals FSi, for i=1 to m, which are then decoded by the feature decoder 110 in a time-sharing manner under the control of the clock signal L. The time-shared output of the feature decoder 110 is denoted by FS.
      <br/>
      Assume each original feature signal FSi, for i=1 to m, is a k-bit binary value and the decoded version of the feature signal, i.e., FS, is a (d+1)-bit binary value and denoted by �F0, F1, . . . , Fd �.
