    <heading>TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
    <p num="5">
      The present invention relates generally to laser texturing a magnetic recording medium.
      <br/>
      The present invention is particularly applicable to laser texturing a substrate for a high areal recording density magnetic recording medium.
    </p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND ART</heading>
    <p num="6">
      Conventional magnetic disk drive designs comprise a commonly denominated Contact Start-Stop (CSS) system commencing when the head begins to slide against the surface of the disk as the disk begins to rotate.
      <br/>
      Upon reaching a predetermined high rotational speed, the head floats in air at a predetermined distance from the surface of the disk due to dynamic pressure effects caused by air flow generated between the sliding surface of the head and the disk.
      <br/>
      During reading and recording operations, the transducer head is maintained at a controlled distance from the recording surface, supported on a bearing of air as the disk rotates, such that the head can be freely moved in both the circumferential and radial directions allowing data to be recorded on and retrieved from the surface of the disk at a desired position.
      <br/>
      Upon terminating operation of the disk drive, the rotational speed of the disk decreases and the head again begins to slide against the surface of the disk and eventually stops in contact with and pressing against the disk.
      <br/>
      Thus, the transducer head contacts the recording surface whenever the disk is stationary, accelerated from the stop and during deceleration just prior to completely stopping.
      <br/>
      Each time the head and disk assembly is driven, the sliding surface of the head repeats the cyclic operation consisting of stopping, sliding against the surface of the disk, floating in the air, sliding against the surface of the disk and stopping.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      It is considered desirable during reading and recording operations to maintain each transducer head as close to its associated recording surface as possible, i.e., to minimize the flying height of the head.
      <br/>
      Thus, a smooth recording surface is preferred, as well as a smooth opposing surface of the associated transducer head, thereby permitting the head and the disk to be positioned in close proximity with an attendant increase in predictability and consistent behavior of the air bearing supporting the head.
      <br/>
      However, if the head surface and the recording surface are too flat, the precision match of these surfaces gives rise to excessive stiction and friction during the start up and stopping phases, thereby causing wear to the head and recording surfaces eventually leading to what is referred to as a "head crash. " Thus, there are competing goals of reduced head/disk friction and minimum transducer flying height.
    </p>
    <p num="8">Conventional practices for addressing these apparent competing objectives involve providing a magnetic disk with a roughened surface to reduce the head/disk friction by techniques generally referred to as "texturing." Conventional texturing techniques involve polishing the surface of a disk substrate to provide a texture thereon prior to subsequent deposition of layers, such as an underlayer, a magnetic layer, a protective overcoat, and a lubricant topcoat, wherein the textured surface on the substrate is intended to be substantially replicated in the subsequently deposited layers.</p>
    <p num="9">
      The escalating requirements for high areal recording density impose increasingly greater requirements on thin film magnetic media in terms of coercivity, coercivity, squareness, low medium noise and narrow track recording performance.
      <br/>
      In addition, increasingly high density and large-capacity magnetic disks require increasingly smaller flying heights, i.e., the distance by which the head floats above the surface of the disk in the CSS drive.
      <br/>
      The requirement to further reduce the flying height of the head challenges the limitations of conventional technology for controlled texturing to avoid head crash.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      Conventional techniques for providing a disk substrate with a textured surface comprise a mechanical operation, such as polishing.
      <br/>
      In texturing a substrate for a magnetic recording medium, conventional practices comprise mechanically polishing the surface to provide a data zone having a substantially smooth surface and a landing zone characterized by topographical features, such as protrusions and depressions.
      <br/>
      See, for example, Nakamura et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,202,810. Conventional mechanical texturing techniques, however, are attendant with numerous disadvantages.
      <br/>
      For example, it is extremely difficult to provide a clean textured surface due to debris formed by mechanical abrasions.
      <br/>
      Moreover, the surface inevitably becomes scratched during mechanical operations, which contributes to poor glide characteristics and higher defects.
      <br/>
      Such relatively crude mechanical polishing, with attendant non-uniformities and debris, does not provide a surface with an adequately specular finish or with adequate microtexturing to induce proper crystallographic orientation of a subsequently deposited magnetic layer on which to record and read information, i.e., a data zone.
    </p>
    <p num="11">
      Data zones are conventionally provided with a smooth specular finish or with a mechanically textured surface.
      <br/>
      In mechanically texturing a substrate surface for data recordation and reading, i.e., a data zone, deep scratches are formed for inducing a desired magnetic orientation.
      <br/>
      However, mechanical texturing disadvantageously results in non-uniform scratches believed to be due to non-uniform particle sizes of abrasive material ranging from about 0.1  MU m to about 5  MU m. In addition, various desirable substrates are difficult to process by mechanical texturing.
      <br/>
      This undesirably limiting facet of mechanical texturing, virtually excludes the use of many materials for use as substrates.
    </p>
    <p num="12">
      Laser technology has been employed to texture a substrate surface to form a topography suitable for a landing zone.
      <br/>
      Such landing zone laser technology typically comprises impinging a pulsed, focused laser light beam on a non-magnetic substrate surface.
      <br/>
      Laser textured landing zones typically exhibit a topographical profile comprising a plurality of spaced apart protrusions extending above the substrate surface or a plurality of spaced apart depressions extending into the substrate surface.
      <br/>
      See, for example, Ranjan et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,062,021, wherein the disclosed method comprises polishing an NiP plated Al substrate to a specular finish, and then rotating the disk while directing pulsed laser energy over a limited portion of the radius, to provide a textured landing zone leaving a specular data zone.
      <br/>
      The landing zone comprises a plurality of individual laser spots characterized by a central depression surrounded by a substantially circular raised rim.

      As areal recording density increases the flying height must be reduced accordingly, thereby challenging the limitations of conventional laser texturing technology for uniformity and precision in forming a textured landing zone comprising a plurality of protrusions.
      <br/>
      The requirements for continuous alignment and adjustment of a laser beam are exacerbated in geographic locations with relatively unstable environmental conditions, such as temperature, vibration and shock, particularly in regions susceptible to seismological disturbances such as tremors and earthquakes.
      <br/>
      Conventional laser delivery systems for texturing a landing zone comprise a system of mirrors and lenses which must be precisely and accurately maintained, particularly as the flying height is reduced to a level of less than about 300  Angstrom , due to inherent undulations of the substrate surface.
      <br/>
      Uniform and precise texturing require continuous maintenance of alignment of a system of mirrors and lenses.
      <br/>
      It is extremely difficult to maintain the requisite precise alignment and satisfy the reduced flying height requirements for high areal recording density, particularly in geographical locations subjected to environmental changes, and seismological disturbances.

      Thus, conventional practices in texturing a substrate, e.g., a non-magnetic substrate or underlayer provided thereon, comprise decoupling the magnetic requirements (data zone on which information is recorded and read) from the mechanical requirements (landing zone), by forming a dedicated landing zone where the slider is parked and latched after the drive has been shut down.

      It is recognized that the most significant magnetic properties of thin-film media are the remanence-thickness product (Mr t), coercivity (Hc) and coercive squareness (S*) . The concept of orientation ratio (OR) has been defined for magnetic media as a means to quantify and understand the directional nature of magnetic properties of a magnetic recording medium.
      <br/>
      Thus, the most common definition of OR is the ratio of Mr t, Hc or S* in the tangential direction to values in the radial direction.
      <br/>
      Thus, in-plane anisotropies impact the OR for a particular magnetic recording medium including scratch. anisotropies.
      <br/>
      Thus, the mechanism for the OR results from a geometric effect and is based upon the preferential growth of crystallite chains due to a self-shadowing mechanism stemming from mechanical polishing.

      Circumferential polishing or texturing of rigid disk substrates provides anisotropy in thin film magnetic disks which enhances coercivity in the track direction.

      The orientation in textured or polished thin film disks can be generated by magnetostatic effects arising from effective decoupling in the cross track direction.

      Such magnetostatic anisotropy increases in strength as the polishing grooves become finer and deeper.

      As the requirements for high areal recording density increase, the need for improved substrate texturing for inducing magnetic orientation in a data zone increases.

    <p num="36">
      Conventional magnetic recording media typically comprise a non-magnetic substrate having sequentially formed on opposite surfaces thereof one or more underlayers, a magnetic layer, a protective overcoat, typically containing carbon, and a lubricant topcoat.
      <br/>
      The non-magnetic substrate or an underlayer formed thereon is typically textured to form a landing zone, as by impinging a pulsed laser light beam thereon during substrate rotation to form a plurality of uniformly spaced apart protrusions or depressions, while the data zone typically comprises a polished specular surface.
      <br/>
      For example, a conventional aluminum alloy substrate, such as aluminum-magnesium substrate having an amorphous nickel-phosphorous (NiP) plating thereon is commercially available with a specular surface.
      <br/>
      The specular surface is textured to form the landing zone while the remaining polished specular surface functions as the data zone.
      <br/>
      The data zone can also comprise a plurality of scratches formed by mechanical polishing during substrate rotation for inducing magnetic orientation in the subsequently deposited magnetic layer.
      <br/>
      The minute polishing scratches in the data zone imparted by circumferential polishing produces in-plane isotropy enhancing coercivity (Hc) and impacting (Mr t) and S*. These properties must be optimized for high areal recording density, thereby requiring formation of data zone microtexture with greater precision and uniformity.
    </p>
    <p num="37">
      In accordance with the present invention, a data zone having high precision and uniformity is achieved by laser texturing.
      <br/>
      In an embodiment of the present invention, a continuous wave laser light beam is impinged on a rotating substrate surface, the substrate constituting either the non-magnetic substrate or the non-magnetic substrate having one or more underlayers thereon.
      <br/>
      The continuous wave laser light beam can be derived from a yttrium-aluminum-garnet (YAG), yttrium-lithium-fluoride (YLF) or yttrium-vanadium-oxide (YVO4) laser light beam source.
      <br/>
      The continuous wave laser light beam is passed through a microfocusing lens system and impinged on a rotating substrate surface to laser texture a data zone to provide a suitable microtopography for orientation of a subsequently deposited magnetic layer, such as a microtopography comprising a plurality of substantially uniform concentric microgrooves, with high precision.
    </p>
    <p num="38">
      In another embodiment of the present invention, a pulsed laser light beam is impinged on a rotating substrate surface or underlayer thereon, at a sufficiently high repetition rate to form a microtopography comprising a plurality of substantially uniform concentric microgrooves with substantially high precision, as in the embodiment employing a continuous wave laser light beam.
      <br/>
      For example, a pulsed laser light beam having a repetition rate of about 300 KHz to about 500 KHz provides substantially uniform concentric microgrooves.
      <br/>
      The use of such a high repetition rate provides a pulse laser width of about 100 nanoseconds to about 300 nanoseconds.
    </p>
    <p num="39">
      The microgrooves formed in accordance with the present invention employing a continuous wave laser light beam are uniform and precise and can be formed in fine patterns for improved areal recording density.
      <br/>
      In embodiments of the present invention, the microgrooves are spaced apart by a distance less than about 1.0  MU m, e.g., less than about 0.5  MU m. Typically, the spacings and dimensions of the microgrooves do not vary more than 10% among microgrooves.
      <br/>
      In embodiments of the present invention, microgrooves are formed having a width of about 0.2  MU m to about 0.8  MU m and a depth extending into the substrate surface a distance of about 10  Angstrom  to about 50  Angstrom .
      <br/>
      The uniformity and precision of the laser textured data zones of the present invention provides optimum in-plane isotropies and OR, thereby achieving an Mr t of about 0.5 to about 1.2 and Hc of about 2,500 to about 5,000.
    </p>
    <p num="40">
      Embodiments of the present invention comprise passing a continuous wave laser light beam through a fiber optic cable, e.g., a single mode fiber optic cable, and then through the microfocusing lens system to impinge on the rotating substrate surface to form a laser textured data zone comprising a plurality of substantially uniform concentric microgrooves.
      <br/>

      No. 08/955,448 filed on Oct. 21, 1997, which apparatus and methodology comprises fiber optic probes and a data processing and a control system for detecting variations in surface planarity and controlling a laser texturing parameter in response to the detected surface variation to maintain uniform precision during laser texturing.
    </p>
    <p num="44">
      Embodiments of the present invention comprise providing an optical probe, e.g., a fiber optic probe, in proximity to the surface of a rotating substrate surface during laser texturing, as disclosed in copending application Ser.
      <br/>
      No. 08/955,448 filed on Oct. 21, 1997. In such embodiments, the fiber optic probe detects surface variations, including subtle variations in planarity, e.g., inherent surface waviness or runout.
      <br/>
      Light signals indicative of any such surface variations are fed back to an optical feedback data processing and control system wherein the light signals are converted into electrical signals in an associated interface module housed therein, the data analyzed and a laser parameter and/or the distance between a microfocusing lens or a microfocusing lens array and the substrate surface adjusted.
      <br/>
      The optical feedback data processing and control system contains an associated computer and a laser controller linked to a continuous wave laser light beam source and a pulsed laser light beam source.
      <br/>
      The laser optic systems comprise an automatic attenuator for appropriate adjustment of the power of the laser light beam in response to sensed surface variations to ensure uniform laser texturing.
      <br/>
      The distance between the microfocusing lens for laser texturing the landing zone and the substrate surface, and the distance between the microfocusing lens array for laser texturing the data zone and the substrate surface can also be adjusted in response to a detected surface variation, in lieu of or in addition to adjusting a laser parameter, to insure uniform laser texturing of the data zone and landing zone.
      <br/>
      The distance between the microfocusing lens array or microfocusing lens and substrate surface can be varied using conventional means, such as a through-the-lens autofocus optical system, a capacitance probe distance detector or other proximate control device.
    </p>
    <p num="45">
      Thus, embodiments of the present invention include positioning a microfocusing lens and a microfocusing lens array at a distance of about 500  MU m to about 1,500  MU m from opposite surfaces of a substrate on a rotating spindle.
      <br/>
      Optical probes, such as fiber optic probes, are positioned proximate opposite surfaces of the substrate during data and landing zone laser texturing to detect surface variations, such as surface planarity variations stemming from inherent waviness or surface runout.
      <br/>
      The fiber optic probes are linked to an optical feedback data processing and control system comprising a fiber optic probe-interface module, a processor with associated conventional peripheral equipment and laser controller for adjusting a relevant data or landing zone laser texturing parameter in response to a detected surface variation.
      <br/>
      The optical feedback data processing and control system can also comprise a mechanism controller linked to the microfocusing lenses and microfocusing lens arrays for adjusting the distance between each microfocusing lens and microfocusing lens array and opposite substrate surfaces and, hence, the focus to maintain uniform precision during texturing.
      <br/>
      Upon detecting an elevation, the laser power can be reduced or discontinued in response thereto or the distance between the microfocusing lens array and substrate surface increased in laser texturing the data zone.
      <br/>
      The pulse duration and repetition rate can be adjusted in response to a detected surface variation in combination with the power and/or distance between the microfocusing lens and substrate surface in laser texturing the landing zone.
      <br/>
      For example, upon detecting a surface elevation, the pulse duration can be reduced, the repetition rate reduced and/or the distance between the substrate and a microfocusing lens increased.
