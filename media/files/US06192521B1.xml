      <br/>
      The present invention relates to a continuous process for the manufacture of a shorts garment from four single layer webs of fabric, each web having two side edges.
      <br/>
      Two of the four webs are aligned in a side by side orientation.
      <br/>
      The side edges of the two webs are bonded together, defining a first composite web.
      <br/>
      The remaining two webs are aligned in a side by side orientation.
      <br/>
      The side edges of the two remaining webs are bonded together, defining a second composite web.
      <br/>
      The first and second composite webs are aligned together in a face to face orientation, defining an arrangement having two layers of fabric and two top side edges and two bottom side edges.
      <br/>
      The composite webs are intermittently bonded in an alternating orientation near the center of the webs.
      <br/>
      The interior portion of fabric is removed, defining a cavity.
      <br/>
      One pair of side edges are folded and bonded together.
      <br/>
      The other pair of side edges are folded and bonded together.
      <br/>
      The web of fabric is cut into discrete garment-sized pieces of fabric, each piece having at least two side seams, an inseam, two tubular leg structures and a waist opening.

    <p num="1">This invention pertains to a process for manufacturing garments, and more particularly to a cost effective, high speed method for manufacturing shorts or trousers.</p>
    <p num="2">
      Typically, the construction of trousers or shorts employs a multi-step process using multiple pieces of fabric, such as cloth or woven materials.
      <br/>
      The pieces of fabric are cut from a larger bolt of fabric into specified shapes.
      <br/>
      The pieces are sewn together, forming a finished garment.
      <br/>
      This process is labor and time intensive.
    </p>
    <p num="3">
      In the area of disposable garments, such as children bibs, coveralls, or examinations gowns, a more continuous process is used.
      <br/>
      Material, such as paper or plastic, is unwound from a roll.
      <br/>
      Strategically placed cuts are made in the material, forming head, arms, or legs openings.
      <br/>
      However, these disposable garments have several limitations, both in the design and durability necessary for active wear garments.
    </p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="4">
      Thus, there is a need to provide an improved process for manufacturing garments, including washable and disposable garments.
      <br/>
      There is also a need to provide comfortable and inexpensive active or swim wear garments.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      In addition, the garments need to be easy to put on and durable during wear.
      <br/>
      In response to this need, an improved cost effective, high speed process for manufacturing shorts and trousers has been discovered.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      One embodiment of the present invention is a continuous process for the manufacture of shorts or trousers to be worn about the lower body comprising an outer surface and an opposing inner surface, defining a waist opening and two leg openings.
      <br/>
      The present invention combines at least one web of fabric in a single continuous process to create shorts or trousers.
      <br/>
      Seaming can be accomplished by use of ultrasonics, heat sealing, adhesives, tape, or sewing, each offering a unique modification to the process.
    </p>

      Definitions
      <br/>
      Within the context of this specification, each term or phrase below will include the following meaning or meanings:
      <br/>
      (a) "Bonded" refers to the joining, adhering, connecting, attaching, or the like, of two elements. Two elements will be considered to be bonded together when they are bonded directly to one another or indirectly to one another, such as when each is directly bonded to intermediate elements.
      <br/>
      (b) "Bonded Carded Fabric or Web" refers to fabric or webs made from staple fibers which are sent through a combing or carding unit, which breaks apart and aligns the staple fibers in the machine direction to form a generally machine direction-oriented fibrous nonwoven web. Such fibers are usually purchased in bales which are placed in a picker which separates the fibers prior to the carding unit. Once the web or fabric is formed, it is then bonded by one or more of several known bonding methods. Once such bonding method is powder bonding, wherein a powdered adhesive is distributed through the web or fabric and then activated, usually by heating the fabric and adhesive with hot air. Another suitable bonding method is pattern boding, wherein heated calendar rolls or ultrasonic bonding equipment are used to bond the fibers together, usually in a localized bond pattern, though the fabric can be bonded across its entire surface if so desired.
      <br/>
      Another suitable and well-known bonding method, particularly when using bi-component staple fibers, is through-air bonding.
      <br/>
      (c) "Cross Machine Direction" means a direction generally perpendicular to the machine direction.
      <br/>
      (d) "Disposable" includes being disposed of after use, and not intended to be washed and reused.
      <br/>
      (e) "Disposed", "disposed on", "disposed with", "disposed at", "disposed near", and variations thereof are intended to mean that one element can be integral or unitary with another element, or that one element can be a separate structure joined to or connected to or placed with or placed near another element.
      <br/>
      (f) "Elasticity" and "elastic" include that property of a material by virtue of which it tends to substantially recover to its original size and shape after removal of a force causing deformation of the material.
      <br/>
      (g) "Elastically connected" and "elastically connecting" refer to two elements being separated by and bonded to an elastic member, where the relative position of the two elements may change due to extension of the elastic member.
      <br/>
      (h) "Elongation" includes the ratio of the extension of a material to the length of a material prior to the extension. Elongation is expressed in percent.
      <br/>
      (i) "Extension", "extend", and "extended" include the change in length of a material due to stretching.
      <br/>
      Extension is expressed in units of length.
      <br/>
      (j) "Fabric" is used to refer to all of the woven, knitted, and nonwoven webs.
      <br/>
      (k) "Flexible" refers to materials or fabrics that are compliant and readily conform to the general shape and contours of an individual's body.
      <br/>
      (l) "Force" includes a physical influence exerted by one body on another which produces acceleration of bodies that are free to move and deformation of bodies that are not free to move. Force is expressed in grams-force.
      <br/>
      (m) "Foreshortened" and "foreshortening" include to shorten beforehand, that is, before a subsequent step.
      <br/>
      (n) "Front" and "back" are used to designate relationships relative to the garment itself, rather than to suggest any position the garment assumes when it is positioned on a wearer.
      <br/>
      (o) "Gatherable" material is one which, when bonded to the reticular web with the latter under tension, will gather, with the formation of puckers or gathers, to accommodate contraction of the reticulated web upon release of the tensioning forces.
      <br/>
      (p) "Machine Direction" means the direction in which it is produced or the length of fabric moving in the direction of the machine operations.
      <br/>
      (q) "Meltblown Fibers" means fibers formed by extruding a molten thermoplastic material through a plurality of fine, usually circular, die capillaries as molten threads or filaments into converging high velocity, usually hot gas (e.g. air) streams which attenuate the filaments of molten thermoplastic material to reduce their diameter, which may be to microfiber diameter.
      <br/>
      Thereafter, the meltblown fibers are carried by the high velocity gas stream and are deposited on a collecting surface to form a web of randomly disbursed meltblown fibers. Such a process is disclosed, for example in U.S. Pat. No. 3,849,241 to Butin, et al. Meltblown fibers are microfibers which may be continuous or discontinuous, are generally smaller than 10 microns in average diameter, and are generally tacky when deposited onto a collecting surface.
      <br/>
      (r) "Member" when used in the singular can have the dual meaning of a single element or a plurality of elements.
      <br/>
      (s) "Multi-layer Laminate" means a laminate wherein some of the layers are spunbond and some are meltblown such as a spunbond/meltblown/spunbond (SMS) laminate and other as disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,041,203 to Brock et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,169,706 to Collier et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,145,727 to Potts et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,178,931 to Perkins, et al., and U.S. Pat. No. 5,188,885 to Timmons et al. Such a laminate may be made by sequentially depositing onto a moving forming belt first a spunbond fabric layer, then a meltblown fabric layer and last another spunbond layer and then bonding the laminate in a manner described below. Alternatively, the fabric layers may be made individually, collected in rolls, and combined in a separate bonding step. Such fabrics usually have a basis weight of from about 0.1 to 12 osy (6 to 400 gsm), or more particularly from about 0.75 to about 3 osy.
      <br/>
      Multi-layer laminates may also have various numbers of meltblown layers or multiple spunbond layers in may different configurations and may include other materials like films or coform materials.
      <br/>
      (t) "Nockable Material" means any material which can be necked.
      <br/>
      (u) "Necked Material" refers to any material which has been constricted in at least one dimension by processes such as, for example, drawing or gathering.
      <br/>
      (v) "Non-elastic" or "Inelastic" refers to any material that does not fall within the definition of "elastic".
      <br/>
      (w) "Nonwoven fabric or web" means a web having a structure of individual fibers or threads which are interlaid, but not in an identifiable manner as in a knitted fabric. Nonwoven fabrics or webs have been formed from many processes such as, for example, meltblowing processes, spunbonding processes, and bonded carded web processes. The basis weight of nonwoven fabrics is usually expressed in ounces of material per square yard (osy) or grams per square meter (gsm) and the fiber diameters are usually expressed in microns.
      <br/>
      (x) "Operatively joined" with reference to the attachment of an elastic member to another element means that the elastic member when attached to or connected to or treated with heat with the element gives that element elastic properties. With reference to the attachment of a non-elastic member to another element, it means that the member and element can be attached in any suitable manner that permits or allows them to perform the intended or described function of the joinder.
      <br/>
      The joining, attaching, connecting or the like can be either directly, such as joining either member directly to an element, or can be indirectly by means of another member or element disposed between the first member and the first element.
      <br/>
      (y) "Pattern" includes any geometric or non-geometric form that can include, among others, a series of connected or unconnected lines or curves, a series of parallel or nonparallel or intersecting lines or curves, a series of linear or curvilinear lines, and the like, or any combinations thereof. The pattern can include a repeating form and/or non-repeating form.
      <br/>
      (z) "Rupture" includes the breaking or tearing apart of a material. In tensile testing, rupture refers to the total separation of a material into two parts, either all at once or in stages, or the development of a hole in some materials.
      <br/>
      (aa) "Stretch bonded" refers to an elastomeric strand being bonded to another member while the elastomeric strand is elongated at least about 25 percent of its relaxed length. Desirably, the term "stretch bonded" refers to the situation wherein the elastomeric strand is elongated at least about 50 percent, more desirably at least about 300 percent, of its relaxed length when it is bonded to the other member.
      <br/>
      (bb) "Stretch bonded laminate" ("SBL") refers to a composite material having at least two layers in which one layer is a gatherable layer and the other layer is a stretchable, that is, elastic, layer.
      <br/>
      The layers are joined together when the stretchable layer is in a stretched condition so that upon relaxing the layers, the gatherable layer is gathered.
      <br/>
      (cc) "Spunbonded fibers" refers to small diameter fibers which are formed by extruding molten thermoplastic material as filaments from a plurality of fine, usually circular capillaries or spinneret with the diameter of the extruded filaments then being rapidly reduced as by, for example, in U.S. Pat. No. 4,340,563 to Appel et al., and U.S. Pat. No. 3,692,618 to Dorschner et al., U.S. Pat. No. 3,802,817 to Matsuki et al., U.S. Pat. No. 3,338,992 and U.S. Pat. No. 3,341,394 to Kinney, U.S. Pat. No. 3,502,763 to Hartman, and U.S. Pat. No. 3,542,615 to Dobo et al. Spunbond fibers are generally not tacky when they are deposited onto a collecting surface. Spunbond fibers are generally continuous and have average diameters (from a sample of at least 10) larger than 7 microns, more particularly, between about 10 and 20 microns.
      <br/>
      (dd) "Tension" includes a uni-axial force tending to cause the extension of a body or the balancing force within that body resisting the extension.
      <br/>
      (ee) "Two-dimensional" refers to a garment, such as a diaper, that can be opened and laid in a flat condition without destructively tearing any structure.
      <br/>
      This type of garment does not have continuous leg and waist openings when opened and laid flat, and requires a fastening device, such as adhesive tapes, to attach the garment about the wearer.
      <br/>
      (ff) "Three-dimensional" refers to a finished garment similar to shorts or pants in that they have continuous leg and waist openings that are bounded by the material of which the garment is made. This type of garment can be opened and laid flat only by destructively tearing it. This type of garment may or may not have manually tearable seams.
      <br/>
      (gg) "Ultimate elongation" includes the elongation at the point of rupture.
      <br/>
      These definitions are not intended to be limiting and these terms may be defined with additional language in the remaining portion of the specification.

      With reference to FIG. 2, the waste containment structure 42 as illustrated includes a backsheet 58, a substantially liquid permeable bodyside liner 56, and an absorbent core 60 sandwiched between the backsheet 58 and the bodyside liner 56.
      <br/>
      The backsheet 58 and bodyside liner 56 are desirably longer and wider than the absorbent core 60, so that the peripheries of the backsheet 58 and liner 56 form margins which may be sealed together using ultrasonic bonds, thermal bonds, adhesives, tape, or other suitable means.
      <br/>
      The absorbent core 60 may be attached to the backsheet 58 and/or the bodyside liner 56 using ultrasonic bonds, adhesives, tape, sewing, or other suitable means.
    </p>
    <p num="41">
      The waste containment structure 42 may also include additional components to assist in the acquisition, distribution and storage of waste material.
      <br/>
      For example, the waste containment structure 42 may include a transport layer, such as described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,798,603 issued Jan. 17, 1989, to Meyer et al., or a surge management layer, such as described in European Patent Application EP 0 539 703 A1, published May 5, 1993, which patent and application are incorporated herein by reference.
    </p>
    <p num="42">
      The waste containment structure 42 can be constructed by supplying bodyside liner and backsheet materials and sandwiching an individual absorbent core 60 between the backsheet 58 and bodyside liner 56.
      <br/>
      The side peripheries of the backsheet 58 and bodyside liner 56 outward of the absorbent core 60 can be joined with side panel material and sealed together.
      <br/>
      Individual waste containment structure 42 can then be cut from the continuous supply of backsheet and bodyside liner materials.
      <br/>
      The waste containment structure 42 may optionally be T-shaped, I-shaped, hourglassshaped, or irregularly-shaped.
    </p>
    <p num="43">
      The absorbent core 60 can comprise a coform material composed of a mixture of cellulosic fibers and synthetic polymer fibers.
      <br/>
      For example, the coform material may comprise an airlaid blend of cellulosic wood fibers and meltblown polyolefin fibers, such as polyethylene or polypropylene fibers.
      <br/>
      Absorbent core 60 can comprise only coform, or a combination of superabsorbent materials and coform, with other absorbent or non-absorbent materials.
    </p>
    <p num="44">
      The coform material may comprise an airlaid blend of cellulosic wood fibers and meltblown polyolefin fibers, such as polyethylene or polypropylene fibers, or may comprise an air-formed batt of cellulosic fibers (i.e., wood pulp fluff).
      <br/>
      Optionally, the absorbent core 60 may be treated with a surfactant to aid in liquid acquisition when in a dry environment.
      <br/>
      In particular embodiments of the invention, the absorbent core 60 has a bulk thickness of not more than about 1.25 cm when dry.
      <br/>
      The hydrophilic fibers and polymer strands may be provided in a fiber-topolymer ratio which is less than 80:20, for example between about 30:70 and about 80:20 and, desirably between about 60:40 and about 70:30.
    </p>
    <p num="45">
      For absorbent core 60, compounds to increase the core absorbency, are included in an effective amount and may consist of organic or inorganic high-absorbency materials.
      <br/>
      For example, the absorbent core 60 can include 0-5 weight percent high-absorbency material, desirably less than 1%.
      <br/>
      Suitable inorganic high-absorbency materials include, for example, absorbent clays and silica gels.
    </p>
    <p num="46">
      Organic high-absorbency materials can include natural materials, such as pectin, guar gum and peat moss, as well as synthetic materials, such as synthetic hydrogel polymers.
      <br/>
      Such hydrogel polymers may include, for example, carboxymethylcellulose, alkali metal salts of polyacrylic acids, polyacrylamides, polyvinyl alcohol, ethylene maleic anhydride copolymers, polyvinyl ethers, hydroxypropyl cellulose, polyvinyl morpholinone, polymers and copolymers of vinyl sulfonic acid, polyacrylates, polyacrylamides, polyvinyl pyridine or the like.
      <br/>
      Other suitable polymers can include hydrolyzed acrylonitrile grafted starch, acrylic acid grafted starch, and isobutylene maleic anhydride copolymers, and mixtures thereof.
    </p>
    <p num="47">
      The hydrogel polymers are desirably sufficiently cross-linked to render the materials substantially water-insoluble.
      <br/>
      Cross-linking may, for example, be by irradiation or by covalent, ionic, van der Waals or hydrogen bonding.
      <br/>
      Suitable materials are available from various commercial vendors, such as Dow Chemical Company, Hoechst-Celanese Corporation and Allied-Colloid.
      <br/>
      Typically, the high-absorbency material is capable of absorbing at least about 15 times its weight in water, and desirably is capable of absorbing more than about 25 times its weight in water.
    </p>
    <p num="48">
      The high-absorbency material can be distributed or otherwise incorporated into the absorbent core 60 employing various techniques.
      <br/>
      For example, the high-absorbency material can be substantially uniformly distributed among the fibers comprising the absorbent core 60.
      <br/>
      The materials can also be non-uniformly distributed within the absorbent core 60 fibers to form a generally continuous gradient with either an increasing or decreasing concentration of high-absorbency material, as determined by observing the concentration moving inward from the backsheet 58.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, the high-absorbency material can comprise a discrete layer separate from the fibrous material of the absorbent core 60, or can comprise a discrete layer integral with the absorbent core 60.
    </p>
    <p num="49">
      The absorbent core 60 may also include a wrap layer (not shown) to help maintain the integrity of the fibrous core.
      <br/>
      This wrap may comprise a hydrophilic spunbond, meltblown or bonded-carded web material composed of synthetic polymer filaments, such as polypropylene, polyethylene, polyesters or the like or natural polymer filaments such as rayon or cotton.
      <br/>
      It may also be a creped tissue paper comprised of wood pulp and a wet-strength resin, such as Kymene, a product of Hercules, Inc. of Wilmington, Del.

    <p num="50">
      The waste containment structure 42 most desirably incorporates a backsheet 58 which is vapor pervious and liquid pervious but only to a small degree liquid pervious.
      <br/>
      It is desirably associated with a cover structure (not shown) which is liquid impervious and which covers or separates the inner 45 waste containment structure from contact with outside surfaces or people.
    </p>
    <p num="51">The crotch area 24 of the waste containment structure 42 could be rendered liquid-impervious by appropriate means such as plastic film, while the upper portion and the waist opening 34 of the waste containment structure 42 could be covered by a liquid-pervious material, to aid in breathability.</p>
    <p num="52">
      The backsheet 58 may comprise a thin, liquid impermeable web or sheet of plastic film such as polyethylene, polypropylene, polyvinyl chloride or similar material.
      <br/>
      Alternately, the backsheet 58 may comprise a nonwoven, fibrous web which has been suitably constructed and arranged to have low liquid perviousness.
      <br/>
      Still alternately, the backsheet 58 may comprise a layered or laminated material, such as a thermally bonded plastic film and nonwoven web composite.
      <br/>
      Since the garment 10 is typically intended for active wear, an exposed backsheet or portions thereof, can be made of materials or of a basis weight which is abrasion resistant.
    </p>
    <p num="53">
      The backsheet 58 may be constructed of a single spunbonded polypropylene nonwoven web having a basis weight of about 0.5 oz/yd2 (17 gsm) to about 2.0 oz/yd2 (68 gsm).

      The shorts 14 desirably comprises a material having a basis weight of from about 0.5 oz/yd2 (17 gsm) to about 2.0 oz/yd2 (68 gsm), desirably 1.0 oz./yd2 to 2.0 oz./yd2 at least in the crotch and buttocks regions of the backsheet 58.
      <br/>
      Lesser basis weights may be used in other regions of the garment 10.
    </p>
    <p num="54">
      In the waste containment structure 42, the backsheet 58 can also be liquid-pervious, and the cover liquid-impervious, for the same reasons as above (See FIGS. 2 and 3).
      <br/>
      However, wherein the garment 10 has shorts 14, the crotch area 24 of the waste containment structure 42 could be rendered liquid-impervious by appropriate means such as a plastic film, while the upper portion of the waste containment structure 42 could be covered by a liquid-pervious material, to aid in breathability.
      <br/>
      In addition, however, the backsheet 58 of the waste containment structure 42 can be made with a vapor pervious material, to allow for some breathability of the structure, while the cover (not shown) is impervious, allowing for fast-drying and containment of any fluid passing through the structure.

      The bodyside liner 56 may be any soft, flexible, porous sheet which passes fluids therethrough.
      <br/>
      Again, the bodyside liner 56 must permit submersion in fresh water, salt water, or treated water and still retain its integrity.
      <br/>
      The bodyside liner 56 may comprise, for example, a nonwoven web or sheet of a spunbonded, meltblown or bonded-carded web composed of synthetic polymer filaments, such as polypropylene, polyethylene, polyesters or the like, or a web of natural polymer filaments such as rayon or cotton.
      <br/>
      The bodyside liner 56 has a pore size that readily allows the passage therethrough of liquids, such as urine and other body exudates.
      <br/>
      The bodyside liner 56 may be selectively embossed or perforated with discrete slits or holes extending therethrough.
