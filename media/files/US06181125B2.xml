      A combination apparatus of distribution transformer and switch includes a distribution transformer with three-phase and five-column, wherein the arrangement of the low-voltage winding in WYEo-form, the high voltage winding of each phase is connected in series with a high voltage fuse to constitute respectively one of the three high voltage phase arms, and the arrangement in high voltage side is DELTA form which is formed with one high voltage phase arm as one unit.
      <br/>
      The apparatus can be used in the system in which the neutral is not connected to the ground, or the neutral is connected to the ground through extinguishing-arc coil or through small resistance, and in the system in which the neutral is connected to the ground directly as well.
      <br/>
      It is possible that the fault phase does not disturb the normal operation of the other phases.

    <heading>TECHNICAL FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="1">The present invention relates to a power distribution equipment, and more particularly to a combination apparatus of a distribution transformer and switches.</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">
      At present, in China, the majority of power distribution cabinet are provided with a  DELTA /Y0 connected three-phase three-leg distribution transformer, while high voltage load switches, tapping switches, high voltage fuses (or circuit breakers) etc. are installed outside the sealed enclosure of the distribution transformer.
      <br/>
      As a result, the power distribution cabinet used in China has a larger volume, occupies more land and needs more maintenance.
      <br/>
      In the United States, an integrated power distribution cabinet, in which a Y0 /Y0 connected three-phase five-leg distribution transformer is mounted, is popularly used, wherein the main bodies of high voltage load switches, tapping switches, and high voltage fuses are installed inside the sealed enclosure of the distribution transformer.
      <br/>
      Hence, the power distribution cabinet used in the United States has a smaller volume, occupies less land and needs less maintenance.
      <br/>
      However, the integrated power distribution cabinet has a disadvantage that it can not be used in a neutral non-grounded power system.
      <br/>
      Because in a neutral non-grounded power system, whether the transformer is connected in a Y0 Y0 connection mode or in a  DELTA /Y0 connection mode, interrupting of one phase of high voltage fuse will cause the other two phases to have supply voltages far higher or far lower than the rated voltages thereof.
      <br/>
      It not only impairs the quality of power supply, but also probably causes damages of the user's electric apparatus as operating under such a higher voltage or lower voltage.
      <br/>
      For the time being, in China, a solution is to trip simultaneously all three phases artificially when an one-phase fault occurs.
      <br/>
      Obviously it is not very reasonable.

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
    <p num="7">
      FIG. 1 shows schematically the structure of the combination apparatus of a distribution transformer and switches according to the invention.
      <br/>
      As shown in FIG. 1, the combination apparatus of a distribution transformer and switches according to the invention comprises an enclosure 2 provided with low voltage bushings 10 and high voltage bushings 20, and a three-phase five-leg distribution transformer 2 disposed within the enclosure 2.
      <br/>
      The terminals of the low voltage windings WA2, WB2, WC2 thereof are respectively indicated by reference numeral x, a; y, b; z, c, wherein the terminals x, y, z are directly connected together each other to form a terminal n as a ground terminal.
      <br/>
      In this way, the low voltage windings WA2, WB2, WC2 are connected together in Y0 connection mode.
      <br/>
      Through the low voltage bushings 10, low voltage output terminals of the combination apparatus are led out from the terminals a, b, c and n. The incoming terminals of the high voltage windings WA1, WB1, WC1 of the three-phase five-leg distribution transformer 3 are respectively connected to the first terminals of a set of tapping switches K2A K2B, K2C, while the second terminals of the set of tapping switches K2A, K2B K2C are respectively connected to the first terminals of a set of high voltage fuses RA, RB RC.
      <br/>
      The second terminals A', B', C' of the set of high voltage fuses R1, RB, RC are respectively connected to the outcoming terminals Z, X and Y of the high voltage windings WC1, WA1, WB1.
      <br/>
      Further, the terminals A', B', C' are respectively connected to the fist terminals of the high voltage load switches K1A, K1B, K1C, while the second terminals A, B, C of the high voltage load switches K1A,K1B, K1C are respectively led out the enclosure 2 through the high voltage bushings 20 serving as the high voltage input terminals of the combination apparatus.
      <br/>
      The above connecting mode is so-called  DELTA /Y0 connection mode, wherein  DELTA / Y0 -11 connection mode is preferably.
      <br/>
      The high voltage windings WA1, WB1, WC1, the tapping switches K2A, K2B, K2C and the high voltage fuses RA, RB, RC connected respectively in serial form three phases of high voltage phase-arms A'X, B'Y, C'Z.
      <br/>
      In fact, in the three-phase five-leg distribution transformer 3, the  DELTA  connection mode is formed by connecting in sequence the high voltage phase-arms A'X, B'Y, C'Z.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, the enclosure 2 is filled with insulation media 4 so as to ensure sufficient insulation strength.
    </p>
    <p num="8">The high voltage fuses R1, RB, RC of the combination apparatus of a distribution transformer and switches according to the invention are preferably overload fuses.</p>
    <p num="9">Further, the manual operating mechanisms of the tapping switches K2A, K2B, K2C and the high voltage load switches K1A, K2B, K2C as well as the fuse element 5 of the high voltage fuses RA, RB, RC are disposed outside the enclosure 2 of the combination apparatus of a distribution transformer and switches so as to the operated and maintained conveniently.</p>
    <p num="10">
      The following discusses are focused on the operations of the combination apparatus of a distribution transformer and switches according to the invention when a fault occurs.
      <br/>
      First of all, a single phase fault is discussed.
      <br/>
      When a phase-to-ground fault occurs at the high voltage winding WA1 of the three-phase five-leg distribution transformer 3, the A-phase of high voltage fuse RA is interrupted, and thus the high voltage winding WA1 loses its exciting current, while the high voltage windings WB1, WC1 of the sound phases B and C are still fed with normal rated voltages from the three-phase power supply, wherein the corresponding fluxes  PHI b and  PHI c form a loop respectively through the two side legs.
      <br/>
      Since the low voltage winding WA2 of the phase A is connected with a load impedance, the synthetic flux of the fluxes  PHI b and  PHI c can hardly flow back through the leg of phase A, and hence the induction voltage on the low voltage winding WA2 is very small.
      <br/>
      Therefore, under the condition of the fuse RA being interrupted, the phase A-to-ground voltage Ua0 output from the low voltage side of the three-phase four-line power system is approximately zero, while the sound phases B and C can still output rated voltages.
    </p>
    <p num="11">
      Hereinafter, a two-phase fault is discussed.
      <br/>
      When a fault occurs on the high voltage windings WA1 and WB1 of the three-phase five-leg distribution transformer, the high voltage fuses RA and RB of the phases A and B are interrupted, and thus the high voltage windings WA1 and WB1 lose the exciting current thereof, while the high voltage winding WC1 of the sound phase C is still fed with normal rated voltages from the three-phase power supply, wherein the corresponding flux  PHI c forms a loop through the two side legs.
      <br/>
      Since the low voltage windings WA2 and WB2 of the phases A and B are connected with load impedance, the flux  PHI c cna hardly flow back through the legs of phases A and B, and hence the induction voltage on the low voltage windings WA2 and WB2 of the faulty phases are very small.
      <br/>
      Therefore, under the condition of the fuses RA and RB of the phases A and B being interrupted, the phase A-to-ground voltage Ua0 and the phase B-to-ground voltage Ub0 output from the low voltage side of the three-phase four-line power system are approximately zero, while the sound phase C can still output a rated voltage.
    </p>
    <p num="12">
      Of course, if necessary, two or more sets of high voltage fuses can be connected in series in the high voltage phase-arms of the combination apparatus of a distribution transformer and switches according to the invention.
      <br/>
      FIG. 2a and FIG. 2b schematically show two different connections between three phases of high voltage phase-arms of the combination apparatus of a distribution transformer and switches according to the invention, in which two sets of high voltage fuses are connected in series.
      <br/>
      In FIG. 2a, in the high voltage phase-arm of phase A, two high voltage fuses RA1 and RA2 in serial are connected at the incoming terminal of the high voltage winding WA1.
      <br/>
      Similarly, in the high voltage phase-arms of phases B and C, two high voltage fuses in serial RB1, RB2 and RC1, RC2 are connected respectively at the incoming terminals of the high voltage windings WB1 and WC1.
      <br/>
      The two high voltage fuses connected in series in each high voltage phase-arm may be the same or different.
      <br/>
      Preferably, the high voltage fuses RA1 RB1, RC1 are current-limiting fuses and the high voltage fuses RA2, RB2, RC2 are overload fuses having better inverse time-current characteristics.
    </p>
    <p num="13">The connection relations of the three phases of high voltage phase-arms of the combination apparatus of a distribution transformer and switches as shown in FIG. 2b are similar to those in FIG. 2a. The difference only lies in that the set of high voltage fuses RA1, RB1, RC1 are respectively connected in serial at the incoming terminals of the high voltage windings WA1, WB1, WC1, while the other set of high voltage fuses RA2, Rb2, RC2 are respectively connected in serial at the outcoming terminals of the high voltage windings WA1, WB1, WC1.</p>
    <p num="14">
      The combination apparatuses of a distribution transformer and switches provided with the high voltage phase-arms as shown in FIG. 2a and FIG. 2b have operation states similar to the above.
      <br/>
      Further descriptions are omitted.
    </p>
    <heading>INDUSTRIAL APPLICABILITY</heading>
    <p num="15">
      The combination apparatus of a distribution transformer and switches according to the invention can be utilized in either a neutral non-grounded power system or a power system whose neutral is grounded through arc-suppression coils or little resistors, and futher it can be utilized in a power system whose neutral is directly grounded.
      <br/>
      Because the high voltage fuses are serially connected in the three phase of high voltage phase-arms connected in a  DELTA  connection mode, it can be ensured that the normal power supply of the sound phases are not interfered by faulty phases so that the reliability of the power supply can be improved.
