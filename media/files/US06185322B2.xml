    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">The present invention concerns with visual inspection for a product or a part being manufactured and more particularly to an inspection data analyzing system which is capable of inspecting defects or particles on a surface of the product or part and analyzing the inspection data.</p>
    <p num="3">
      In the manufacture of a semiconductor device or the like, product defects often result from particles or defects existing on a surface of a work piece.
      <br/>
      It is, therefore, necessary to quantitatively inspect particles or defects for normally monitoring if a problem occurs in the manufacturing machine or the circumstance around it.
      <br/>
      And, it is necessary to grasp how the particles or defects have an adverse effect on a yield and take effective measures for the particles or defects for improving the yield.
      <br/>
      Hereinafter, the terms "particles or defects" will be generally referred to as "defects".
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      As an example, the use of an automatic visual inspection machine for data analysis in the manufacture of semiconductors has been disclosed in an article entitled "How does the automatic wafer inspection improve a yield?", Solid State Technology (Japanese Version), July 1988, pages 44 to 48.
      <br/>
      The visual inspection is carried out for wafers in more than one manufacturing process.
      <br/>
      Hence, the inspection data includes data for managing the inspection data itself.
      <br/>
      The managing data contains a product name of a inspected wafer, a lot number, a wafer number, and an inspected process, data, and time, for example.
      <br/>
      It is necessary to analyze not only the inspection data but also the managing data.
      <br/>
      The conventional visual inspection machine includes a function of measuring sizes of defects and where the defects are located on a wafer coordinate, a function of measuring the number of defects existing on a wafer, and a means for allowing an operator to determine a category of defects, and the like.
      <br/>
      The machine inspects the change of the number of defects on each wafer, the distribution of a defects frequency on a wafer-size basis, and the like.
      <br/>
      Further, the machine serves to analyze the correlation between the number of defects on each wafer (defects density) and the yield of the wafer as well.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      And, each wafer has to be identified in more than one visual inspection process in the data analysis.
      <br/>
      Conventionally, the operator has visually recognized a wafer number.
      <br/>
      To reduce the burden of this operation, an automatic particle inspection machine having a means for automatic recognition of a wafer number has been disclosed in JP-A-63-213352.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      The known automatic visual inspection machine has been categorized into two groups.
      <br/>
      One is referred to as an automatic particle inspection machine which is an inspection machine employing a light-scattering system.
      <br/>
      This machine serves to inspect particles existing on a wafer.
      <br/>
      It is thus unable to always inspect defects.
      <br/>
      The other group is an inspection machine employing a pattern recognition system.
      <br/>
      It is referred to as an automatic visual inspection machine or an automatic defect inspection machine, which has a function of recognizing defects in addition to particles.
      <br/>
      The automatic visual inspection machine needs about 1000 times as long an inspection time as the automatic defect inspection machine.
      <br/>
      The former machine can thus inspect a far smaller number of wafers than the latter.
      <br/>
      For monitoring how defects are caused in a mass production line, the two methods are provided.
      <br/>
      The first method is to restrict the processes to be visually inspected to a specific process (Solid State Technology (Japanese Version), July 1988, pages 44 to 48).
      <br/>
      The second method is to take the steps of matching the particle inspection data to the visual inspection data over all the processes and machines, checking the correlation between particles and defects, and presuming how defects are caused on the particle inspection data (Semiconductor World, May 1989, pages 118 to 125).
      <br/>
      Further, in analyzing data, these methods require an operator who serves to analyze data, because there exist lot of data and various kinds of data analysis methods in analyzing data.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      The conventional methods is uncapable of grasping how defects are caused on each chip.
      <br/>
      Hence, they can merely perform correlation analysis between the number of defects per wafer and a yield.
      <br/>
      That is, these methods have a disadvantage that they cannot grasp the relation between defects per wafer and a product character.
      <br/>
      In addition, one semiconductor for one wafer is provided at this time, while two or more semicondcutors for one wafer will be provided in future.
      <br/>
      It is necessary to enhance the data processing unit from a wafer unit to a chip-unit basis.
      <br/>
      The new data analysis technique is expected accordingly.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      And, for inspecting how many defects are caused in a mass production line, the foregoing first method is designed to determine the process to be visually inspected on the basis of the knowledge of an operator and the result of a probing test.
      <br/>
      The foregoing second method requires large labor for matching the particle inspection data to the visual inspection data over all the processes and machines.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      Moreover, an operator who is mainly in charge of maintaining and managing the manufacturing machine does not have a spare time to analyze the inspection data of a wafer given by his or her machine.
      <br/>
      Hence, the operator requests the data analysis of another operator who is mainly in charge of it.
      <br/>
      However, novel data analysis method and means are expected which anyone can operate easily and quickly and which serve to output the analyzed data.
    </p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="10">It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide an inspection data analysis system which is capable of analyzing data per chip for the purpose of grasping the relation between the occurrence condition of defects per chip and the product character of each chip.</p>
    <p num="11">And, it is a further object of the present invention to provide an inspection data analyzing system which is capable of easily determining a manufacturing process which causes problems and the contents of the problems.</p>
    <p num="12">It is another object of the present invention to provide an inspection data analyzing system which is capable of monitoring the overall production line and efficiently inspecting the quantity of caused defects in a mass production line.</p>
    <p num="13">
      To achieve the foregoing objects, the present invention offers a probing tester, an automatic particle inspection machine, and an automatic visual inspection machine respectively having data analysis stations.
      <br/>
      Each data analysis station has chip arrangement information for each product and serves to describe the locations of defects on the coordinate system on which the chip disposition is described.
      <br/>
      And, the station provides a function for determining which chip each defect is caused.
      <br/>
      These data analysis stations are linked with a communication line.
    </p>
    <p num="14">Further, for inspecting the quantity of caused defects in the mass production line, the particle inspection machine operated at a higher inspection speed employs the step of monitoring the overall manufacturing line, inspecting the portions around caused defects, and monitoring the quantity of caused defects.</p>
    <p num="15">And, in order for anyone to use the machine, the data analysis station is designed to offer a routine data retrieval method, a routine operation method, and a routine analysis result output format.</p>
    <p num="16">
      As mentioned above, each data analysis station provides chip disposition information, a function of describing the locations of caused defects on the coordinate system on which the chip disposition is described, and a function of determining which chip each defect is caused.
      <br/>
      It is thus possible to grasp how particles are attached and defects are caused on each chip.
      <br/>
      By linking these data analysis stations with a communication line, therefore, the data analysis station for probing test data sends the probing data to the station for particles and defects data so that the latter station can inspect the relation between the condition of caused defects on each chip and the probing test result (product character).
      <br/>
      As will be understood from the above description, the present invention is designed so that the particle inspection machine operating at a higher inspection speed serves to monitor the overall manufacturing line and the visual inspection machine serves to inspect portions around caused particles for inspecting the quantity of caused defects.
      <br/>
      Hence, this invention is capable of efficiently inspecting the quantity of caused defects in a mass production line.
    </p>
    <p num="17">Further, in analyzing data, as mentioned above, this invention has a routine data retrieval method, a routine operating method, and a routine output format, so that anyone can analyze the data and obtain clear outputs.</p>

      For carrying out the particle or visual inspection, it is possible to employ a method for determining a subject process on the basis of the operator's knowledge or a method for determining a process to be viaually inspected on the basis of the particle-inspecting result as mentioned below.
      <br/>
      In the particle or visual inspection, data is supplied to each inspection machine.
      <br/>
      The data contains a lot number of a wafer, a wafer number, an inspection day and time, a process located immediately before the inspection, and the like.
      <br/>
      The process-completed wafers are carried to the probing tester 7 at each lot, in which tester 7 all the wafers contained in the lot are subject to a probing test.
      <br/>
      Herein, the lot number of a wafer, the wafer number, and the inspection day and time are supplied to the probing tester 7.
      <br/>
      The particle data analysis station 2 and the defects data analysis station 5 contain information about how chips are disposed on a wafer for each product.
      <br/>
      Based on the information, these stations serve to determine which chip the inspected defects belong to on the basis of the locations of the inspected defects placed on the chip coordinate system and count how many defects are brought about on each chip.
      <br/>
      Based on the number of defects existing on a wafer, the location coordinates of the defects, and the number of defects on a chip, the particle inspection data analysis station 2 and the visual inspection data analysis station 5 serve to carry out the analysis described in each of the embodiments 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, and 25.

      The particle database 1010 includes three databases referred to as a lot unit data table (see FIG. 5A), a wafer unit data table (see FIG. 5B), and a particle unit data table (see FIG. 5C).
      <br/>
      The lot unit data table serves to save particle management data 5001, 5002, 5003, 5005, 5006 and a wafer size 5004.
      <br/>
      The wafer unit data table serves to save a lot number 5008, a wafer number 5009, and the number of particles 5010 existing on the inspected wafer contained in the particle inspection data.

      <br/>
      When the particle management data and the particle inspection data for one lot are rejected in the particle database 1010 (step 10003), the particle data processing unit 1009 increments by one the lot number for each product in the lot number management file for each product (step 10004).
      <br/>
      Then, the data deletion procedure is illustrated in FIG. 10. An analysis operator routinely maintains the particle database 1010 and deletes the data about the lot he or she determines unncessary (step 10005).
      <br/>
      When the one-lot data is deleted from the particle database 1010, the particle data processing unit 1009 decrements by one the lot number for each product in the lot number management file for each product (step 10006).
      <br/>
      Then, in the product unit lot number management file, it is determined if the product unit lot nubmer is zero (step 10007).
      <br/>
      If yes, the map information file about the product is deleted and then the file about the product in the product unit lot number management file is deleted (step 10008).

      By the specification, it is possible to save the particle location coordinates 5014, 5015 on the specified wafer, the inspection date 5005, and the inspection time 5006 as shown in FIG. 5 in the memory 1016 from the particle database 1010.

    <p num="71">
      In the particle data processing unit 1009, the particle trace algorithm to be described later clearly indicates how the particles are attached or removed in each process.
      <br/>
      The particle trace algorithm will be described in FIG. 33. At first, the algorithm sorts the specified process names in earlier order by referencing the inspection date 5005 and the inspection time 5006 (step 10018).
      <br/>
      Then, it creates a sensed particle list for each process (step 10019) and then makes the caused particle list in the initial process identical to the sensed particle list therein (step 10020).
      <br/>
      The format of the sensed particle list is equal to that of the caused particle list, which is shown in FIG. 34. Next, the algorithm calculates a distance between the particle location coordinates on the wafer in the initial process and the particle location coordinates on the same wafer in the next process in the recording order of the coordinate data.
      <br/>
      If a calculated distance is smaller than a predetermined constant value R, these two particles about the distance are specified as the same.
      <br/>
      Then, the similar calculation is done about the next particle.
      <br/>
      If no particles in the second process are found to be equal to the particles sensed in the initial process, it is determined that the particles are removed.
      <br/>
      If no particles sensed in a process are found to be equal to the particles sensed in the previous process, it is determined that the particles are newly attached in the process.
      <br/>
      The particles to be newly attached in the new process are registered in the particle occurrence list in the new process (step 10021).
      <br/>
      The similar calculation is done in the order of the earlier processes.
