      Field of the Invention
    </p>
    <p num="2">The present invention relates to a radiation sensitive resin composition, and more specifically, to a radiation sensitive resin composition suitable for use as a chemically amplified resist.</p>
    <p num="3">2. Description of Background Art</p>
    <p num="4">In the field of microfabrication, as exemplified by the manufacturing of an integrated circuit device, development of a lithographic process capable of performing microfabrication with a 0.2  MU m or less line-width precision has been vigorously pursued in recent years to achieve higher integration.</p>
    <p num="5">
      To ensure microfabrication in the order of 0.2  MU m or less, the use of short wavelength radioactive rays is being studied.
      <br/>
      As such short wavelength radioactive rays, far ultraviolet rays, X-rays, and electron beams, typified by a bright-line spectrum of mercury-vapor light and an excimer laser, can be given.
      <br/>
      Of these, a KrF excimer laser (wavelength: 248 nm) and an ArF excimer laser (wavelength: 193 nm) are regarded as promising.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      A number of compositions utilizing a chemical amplification effect of a component which has an acid-decomposable functional group and a component which generates an acid when irradiated with radioactive rays have been proposed as radiation-sensitive resin compositions applicable to irradiation by such excimer lasers.
      <br/>
      Such a composition is hereinafter called "a chemically amplified radiation sensitive composition" and such a component which generates an acid when irradiated with radioactive rays is hereinafter called "an acid generator".
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      For example, Japanese Patent Publication No. 27660/1990 discloses a chemically amplified radiation sensitive composition comprising a polymer having a t-butyl ester group of carboxylic acid or a t-butyl carbonate group of phenol and an acid generator.
      <br/>
      The t-butyl ester group or t-butyl carbonate group in the polymer dissociates by the action of the acid which is generated by irradiation of radioactive rays.
      <br/>
      As a consequence, the polymer has an acidic group consisting of a carboxyl group or phenolic hydroxyl group, which makes the irradiatied areas on the resist film easily soluble in an alkaline developer.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      Most conventional chemically amplified radiation sensitive compositions contain a phenol-type base resin.
      <br/>
      When deep ultraviolet rays are used with such a resin, part of the deep ultraviolet rays is absorbed by the aromatic ring in the resin, so that a sufficient amount of the deep ultraviolet rays cannot reach the deepest part of the resist film.
      <br/>
      The irradiation dose is larger at the resist film surface than the resist film.
      <br/>
      As a consequence, in the case of positive working resists, the resist pattern after development which is smaller around the surface parts increases progressively toward the bottom.
      <br/>
      No sufficient resolution can be obtained.
      <br/>
      In addition, if a resist pattern after development provides a trapezoid section, no desired dimensional precision can be obtained in the subsequent etching and ion implantation steps.
      <br/>
      Unless the sectional configuration of the resist pattern is rectangular in the upper layer, the resist dissipates so fast by dry etching that it is difficult to control the etching conditions.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      The configuration of resist pattern can be improved by increasing the transmittance of radioactive rays of the resist film.
      <br/>
      For example, a (meth)acrylate-type resin represented by poly (methyl methacrylate) exhibits a high transparency to deep ultraviolet rays.
      <br/>
      This type of resin is therefore ideal from the viewpoint of radioactive ray transmittance.
      <br/>
      Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No. 226461/1992, for example, discloses a chemically amplified radiation-sensitive resin composition comprising a methacrylate-based resin.
      <br/>
      This composition is excellent inasmuch as its performance of microfabrication is concerned.
      <br/>
      However, the composition has a drawback of a low dry etching resistance due to absence of an aromatic ring.
      <br/>
      It is difficult to perform etching with high-resolution.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      In addition, a number of three or higher multi-component compositions in which high or low molecular weight additives are incorporated have been proposed as a means for improving performance of the resist comprising a chemically amplified radiation sensitive composition.
      <br/>
      However, the relationship between the radiation transmittance of resist films and the function of the additives in these compositions has not been completely clarified.
      <br/>
      In addition, these compositions do not necessarily satisfy an overall balance of important characteristics as a resist, such as dry etching resistance, pattern configuration, sensitivity, resolution, and the like.
      <br/>
      For instance, a resist composition disclosed in Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No. 15865/1997, which comprises a copolymer containing (meth)acrylate and (meth)acrylic acid as essential components, and acid generator, and androstane-17-alkyl carboxylate, has a difficulty in adequately controlling diffusion of acid in the resist film during formation of resist patterns, in spite of its high transparency to radioactive rays.
      <br/>
      The difficulty in controlling diffusion of acid not only results in unsatisfactory pattern configuration, sensitivity, and resolution, but also in poor dry etching resistance, insufficient developability, and impaired adhesive properties to substrates.
    </p>
    <p num="11">
      Adequate control of acid diffusion in resist films is very important for obtaining an excellent resist profile, particularly in the area where the fabricated pattern size is 0.20  MU m or less.
      <br/>
      Development of a radiation-sensitive resin composition which can effectively control acid diffusion has been desired from such a point of view.
    </p>
    <p num="12">An object of the present invention is therefore to provide a radiation-sensitive resin composition useful as a chemically amplified resist which is sensitive to reactive radioactive rays such as deep ultraviolet rays, typified by a KrF excimer laser or an ArF excimer laser, for example, exhibiting high transparency to radiation, superior dry-etching resistance, high resolution, and an excellent property balance such as pattern configuration and sensitivity.</p>

    <p num="37">The recurring units (I) may be present either individually or in combinations of two or more in the copolymer (A).</p>
    <p num="38">
      In addition to the above-described recurring unit (I), the copolymer (A) may contain the recurring unit (II) of the above formula (2).
      <br/>
      The recurring unit (II) in the copolymer (A) not only increases affinity of the resin composition to a developer, but also improves adhesion to substrates.
      <br/>
      In addition, incorporation of the recurring unit (II) accelerates the polymerization reaction for producing the copolymer (A) and increases the polymerization capability of the recurring unit (I).
    </p>
    <p num="39">
      The recurring unit (III) has a function of reducing movement of the polymer molecule chains by introducing moderate branched structures in the copolymer (A), thereby suppressing the heat distortion and improving the heat resistance of the copolymer (A).
      <br/>
      Another function of the recurring unit (III) is to decrease the molecular weight of the copolymer (A) through decomposition with an acid.
      <br/>
      In addition, introduction of branched structures in the copolymer (A) by the recurring unit (III) lowers the viscosity of the polymer solution as compared with polymers with a straight chain structure.
      <br/>
      This increases the molecular weight of the copolymer (A), resulting in further improvement in the heat resistance and resolution as a resist.
      <br/>
      Moreover, inclusion of a specific group which decomposes in the presence of an acid (acid-decomposable group) in the recurring unit (III) causes the branched structure in the copolymer (A) to destroy, thereby decreasing the molecular weight of the copolymer.
      <br/>
      Thus, the solubility of copolymer (A) in the presence of an acid increases, which remarkably improves resolution as a resist.

      <br/>
      (b) A method of partially hydrolyzing and/or solvolyzing the copolymer obtained in the method (a).
      <br/>
      (c) A method of at least partially esterifying the carboxyl group in the copolymer obtained by the method (a) or (b) to convert the carboxyl group into the group --COOR' and/or the group --COOCH2 COOR".
    </p>
    <p num="75">In the above-mentioned method (a), the copolymer (A) is prepared in a suitable solvent in the presence of a radical polymerization initiator such as a hydroperoxide compound, dialkyl peroxide compound, diacyl peroxide compound, or azo compound.</p>
    <p num="76">Given as examples of the solvent used in the polymerization are alkanes such as n-pentane, n-hexane, n-heptane, n-octane, n-nonane, and n-decane; cycloalkanes such as cyclohexane, cycloheptane, cyclooctane, decalin, and norbornane; aromatic hydrocarbons such as benzene, toluene, xylene, ethylbenzene, and cumene; halogenated hydrocarbons such as chlorobutane, bromohexane, dichloroethane, hexamethylene dibromide, and chlorobenzene; saturated carboxylic acid esters such as ethyl acetate, n-butyl acetate, i-butyl acetate, and methyl propionate; and ethers such as tetrahydrofuran, dimethoxyethane, and diethoxyethane.</p>
    <p num="77">These solvents can be used either individually or in combinations of two or more.</p>

      If Mw is less than 5,000, the heat resistance of the copolymer (A) as a resist tends to be impaired; if more than 300,000, on the other hand, developability of a resist tends to be impaired.

    <p num="132">Method of Forming Resist Patterns</p>
    <p num="133">The radiation sensitive resin compositions of the first and second inventions are especially useful as chemically amplified positive tone resists.</p>
    <p num="134">
      In the chemically amplified positive tone resists, the acid-decomposable organic group (i) or (ii) in the copolymer (A) or alicyclic compound (C) decompose by the action of an acid which is produced from the acid generator (B) by exposure to radiation, thereby producing a carboxyl group, for example.
      <br/>
      This increases solubility of the exposed areas of the resist in an alkaline developer.
      <br/>
      The exposed areas are thus removed by being dissolved in the alkaline developer, leaving a positive tone resist pattern.
    </p>
    <p num="135">
      To prepare a resist pattern from the radiation sensitive resin composition of the first invention, the resin composition is applied on a substrate such as a silicone wafer, a wafer coated with aluminum, or the like by an appropriate coating means such as revolutionary application, cast coating, or roller coating.
      <br/>
      The resist film thus prepared is optionally subjected to a prebaking treatment (hereinafter called "PB treatment"), then exposed to radiation to form a prescribed resist pattern.
      <br/>
      An ArF excimer laser (wavelegth: 193 nm) or a KrF excimer laser (wavelegth: 248 nm) is preferable radioactive rays used in this step.
    </p>
    <p num="136">
      In the first invention, it is desirable to subject the exposed resist film to a post-exposure baking treatment (hereinafter called"PEB").
      <br/>
      The PEB treatment ensures a smooth reaction for decomposition of the acid-decomposable organic group (i) or (ii).
      <br/>
      Although the PEB conditions differ depending on the proportion of the components in the radiation sensitive resin composition, heating in the PEB treatment is carried out at a temperature usually from 30 to 200 (degree)  C., and preferably from 50 to 170 (degree)  C.
    </p>
    <p num="137">
      To make the best use of potentiality of the radiation sensitive resin composition in the first invention an organic or inorganic anti-reflection film may be formed on the substrate prior to exposure to radiation, as disclosed in Japanese Patent Publication No. 12452/1994, for example.
      <br/>
      It is also possible to provide a protective overcoating over the resist film, as disclosed in Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No. 188598/1993, for example, to protect the resist film from the effect of basic impurities in the environmental atmosphere.
      <br/>
      These two techniques may be employed in combination.
      <br/>
      A desired resist pattern is then formed by developing the exposed areas on the resist film.

    <p num="146">Component(A')</p>
    <p num="147">The component (A') in the second invention is a polymer having the same recurring unit (I) shown by the formula (1) which is used as part of the essential recurring units for the component (A) in the first invention, and further having an alicyclic skeleton on the main chain (hereinafter called "polymer (A')").</p>
    <p num="148">Possession of the alicyclic skeleton in the main chain of the polymer (A') enables the radiation sensitive resin composition of the second invention to exhibit superior transparency, especially to radioactive rays, and superb dry etching resistance.</p>
    <p num="149">The polymer (A') can possess the acid-decomposable group (i) as the substitution groups A and/or B in the recurring unit (I) in the same way as in the first invention and may also contain one or more "other recurring unit".</p>
    <p num="150">
      In addition, in the same way as in the first invention, the polymer (A') may contain at least one recurring unit selected from a recurring unit obtained by the cleavage of a polymerizable carbon--carbon double bond of norbornene (bicyclo�2.2.1�hept-2-ene) or norbornene derivative having no acid-decomposable groups (hereinafter called "norbornene derivative ( GAMMA )"), or a recurring unit obtained by the cleavage of a polymerizable carbon--carbon double bond of a compound other than the norbornene or norbornene derivative ( GAMMA ) (hereinafter called "monomer ( DELTA )").
      <br/>
      These recurring units are hereinafter collectively referred to as "other recurring units".
    </p>
    <p num="151">
      When the other recurring units originating from polymerizable unsaturated compounds in the polymer (A') contains the recurring units derived from norbornene or norbornene derivative ( GAMMA ), the total amount of the recurring unit (I) and the recurring units originating from norbornene or norbornene derivative ( GAMMA ) is usually 20 mol % or more, preferably 30 mol % or more, and more preferably 40 mol % or more.
      <br/>
      When the other recurring units originating from polymerizable unsaturated compounds in the polymer (A') are the recurring units derived from only norbornene derivative ( DELTA ), the amount of the recurring unit (I) is usually 20 mol % or more, preferably 30 mol % or more, and more preferably 40 mol % or more.
      <br/>
      In either case, if this amount is less than 20mol %, dry etching resistance as a resist tends to be insufficient.
    </p>
    <p num="152">In the former case, the percentage of the recurring unit (I) in the total amount of the recurring unit (I) and the recurring units originating from norbornene or norbornene derivative ( GAMMA ) is usually 30 mol % or more, preferably 40 mol % or more, and more preferably 50 mol % or more.</p>
    <p num="153">The polymer (A') is prepared, for example, by the polymerization of at least one norbornene derivative ( ALPHA ) and at least one other polymerizable unsaturated compound using a radical polymerization initiator such as a hydroperoxide compound, dialkyl peroxide compound, diacyl peroxide compound, or azo compound in the presence of a suitable solvent.</p>
    <p num="154">As examples of the solvent used for the polymerization, alkanes such as n-pentane, n-hexane, n-heptane, n-octane, n-nonane, and n-decane; cycloalkanes such as cyclohexane, cycloheptane, cyclooctane, decalin, and norbornane; aromatic hydrocarbons such as benzene, toluene, xylene, ethylbenzene, and cumene; halogenated hydrocarbons such as chlorobutane, bromohexane, dichloroethane, hexamethylene dibromide, and chlorobenzene; saturated carboxylic acid esters such as ethyl acetate, n-butyl acetate, i-butyl acetate, and methyl propionate; and ethers such as tetrahydrofuran, dimethoxyethane, and diethoxyethane can be given.</p>
    <p num="155">These solvents can be used either individually or in combinations of two or more.</p>
    <p num="156">
      The polystyrene-standardized weight average molecular weight (Mw) of the polymer (A') determined by the gel permeation chromatography (GPC) is usually from 3,000 to 300,000, preferably from 4,000 to 200,000, and more preferably from 5,000 to 100,000.
      <br/>
      If Mw of the polymer (A') is less than 3,000, heat resistance as a resist tends to decrease; if more than 300,000, on the other hand, developability as a resist tends to be insufficient.
    </p>
    <p num="157">In the present invention polymer (A') can be used either individually or in combinations of two or more.</p>
    <p num="158">
      The smaller the content of impurities such as halogen and metals in the polymer (A') used in the second invention, the better is the performance of the radiation sensitive resin composition, such as sensitivity and resolution as a resist, a process stability, and pattern configuration, and the like.
      <br/>
      As the method for purifying of the polymer (A'), chemical purification methods such as washing and liquid-liquid extraction, for example, and combinations of a chemical purification method with a physical method such as ultrafiltration, centrifugation, or the like, can be given.
    </p>
    <p num="159">Component (B')</p>
    <p num="160">The same compounds as the photoacid generator (B) which generate an acid by exposure to radiation used in the first invention can be used as the component (B') in the second invention.</p>
    <p num="161">
      Specifically, the component (B') (hereinafter referred to as "acid generator (B')") can liberate the acid-decomposable organic group in the polymer (A) or the organic group (Z) in the later-described androstane compound (C') by the action of an acid produced by exposure to radiation.
      <br/>
      As a result, the exposed area in the resist film is rendered easily soluble in an alkali developer, whereby a positive tone resist pattern is formed.
    </p>
    <p num="162">In the second invention, the acid generator (B') can be used either individually or in combinations of two or more.</p>

      To optimize and balance sensitivity and developability as a resist, the amount of the acid generator (B') used in the composition of the second invention is usually from 0.1 to 10 parts by weight, and preferably from 0 5 to 7 parts by weight, for 100 parts by weight of the amount of the polymer (A').
      <br/>
      If less than 0.1 part by weight, sensitivity and developability tends to be insufficient; if more than 10 parts by weight, on the other hand, the transparency of the resist against radiation tends to be impaired so that it is difficult to obtain a rectangular resist pattern.
    </p>
    <p num="164">Component (C')</p>
    <p num="165">
      The component (C') in the second invention is an androstane-17-carboxylic acid ester compound which is shown by the above-mentioned formula (5) (hereinafter called "androstane compound (C')").
      <br/>
      When this compound reacts with the acid which is generated by exposure to radiation, the group Z in the formula (5) decomposes to produce a carboxyl group or an acid-decomposable group in the group Z dissociates to produce a polar group, whereby the androstane compound (C') loses its capability of suppressing alkali solubility of the polymer (A') and rather acts to accelerate the alkali solubility of the polymer (A').
