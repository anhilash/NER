    <heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="1">This invention relates to a silver halide photographic element containing a phenolic cyan dye-forming coupler bearing a carbonamido group substituted with a carbocyclic group in the 2-position and a carbonamido group bearing a sulfonyl group having a heterocyclic substituent in the 5-position.</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">
      In silver halide based color photography, a typical photographic element contains multiple layers of light-sensitive photographic silver halide emulsions coated on a support with one or more of these layers being spectrally sensitized to each of blue light, green light and red light.
      <br/>
      The blue, green, and red light-sensitive layers typically contain yellow, magenta, and cyan dye-forming couplers, respectively.
      <br/>
      After exposure to light, color development is accomplished by immersing the exposed material in an aqueous alkali solution containing an aromatic primary amine color-developing agent.
      <br/>
      The dye-forming couplers are selected so as to react with the oxidized color developing agent to provide yellow, magenta and cyan dyes in the so called subtractive color process to reproduce their complementary colors, blue, green and red as in the original image.
    </p>
    <p num="3">The important features for selecting the dye-forming coupler include, efficient reaction with oxidized color developing agent, thus minimizing the necessary amounts of coupler and silver halide in the photographic element; the formation of dyes with hues appropriate for the photographic use of interest, for color photographic paper applications this requires that dyes have low unwanted side absorption leading to good color reproduction in the photographic print; minimization of image dye loss contributing to improved image permanence under both ambient illumination and conventional storage conditions; and in addition the selected dye-forming coupler must exhibit good solubility in coupler solvents, provide good dispersibility in gelatin and remain stable during handling and manipulation for maximum efficiency in manufacturing processes.</p>
    <p num="4">
      In recent years, a great deal of study has been conducted to improve dye-forming couplers for silver halide photosensitive materials in terms of improved color reproducibility and image dye stability.
      <br/>
      However, further improvements are needed, particularly in the area of cyan couplers.
      <br/>
      In general, cyan dyes are formed from naphthols and phenols as described, for example, in U.S. Pat. Nos. 2,367,351, 2,423,730, 2,474,293, 2,772,161, 2,772,162, 2,895,826, 2,920,961, 3,002,836, 3,466,622, 3,476,563, 3,552,962, 3,758,308, 3,779,763, 3,839,044, 3,880,661, 3,998,642, 4,333,999, 4,990,436, 4,960,685, and 5,476,757; in French patents 1,478,188 and 1,479,043; and in British patent 2,070,000.
      <br/>
      These types of couplers can be used either by being incorporated in the photographic silver halide emulsion layers or externally in the processing baths.
      <br/>
      In the former case the couplers must have ballast substituents built into the molecule to prevent the couplers from migrating from one layer into another.
      <br/>
      Although these couplers have been used extensively in color photographic film and paper products, the dyes derived from them still suffer from poor stability to heat, humidity or light, low coupling efficiency or optical density, and in particular from undesirable blue and green absorptions which cause considerable reduction in color reproduction and color saturation.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      Cyan couplers which have been recently proposed to overcome some of these problems are 2,5-diacylaminophenols containing a sulfone, sulfonamido or sulfate moiety in the ballasts at the 5-position, as disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,609,619, 4,775,616, 4,849,328, 5,008,180, 5,045,442, and 5,183,729; and Japanese patent applications JP02035450 A2, JP01253742 A2, JP04163448 A2, JP04212152 A2, and JP052041 10 A2.
      <br/>
      Even though cyan image dyes formed from these couplers allege in various instances improved stability to heat and humidity, enhanced optical density and resistance to reduction by ferrous ions in the bleach bath, the dye absorption maxima ( LAMBDA max) are too hypsochromically shifted (that is, shifted to the blue end of the visible spectrum) and the absorption spectra are too broad with considerable amounts of undesirable blue and green absorptions and often lack sufficient stability toward light fading.
      <br/>
      Thus, these couplers are not acceptable for direct view materials such as reversal transparencies or color paper and print applications.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      The hue of a dye is a function of both the shape and the position of its spectral absorption band.
      <br/>
      Traditionally, the cyan dyes used in color photographic papers have had nearly symmetrical absorption bands centered in the region of 620 to 680 nm, typically 630 to 660 nm.
      <br/>
      Such dyes have rather large amounts of unwanted absorption in the green and blue regions of the spectrum.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      More desirable would be a dye whose absorption band is asymmetrical in nature and biased towards the green region, that is, with a steep slope on the short wavelength side.
      <br/>
      The half-bandwidth on the short side of the curve, also called the left half-bandwidth or LBW, is desirably narrowed.
      <br/>
      Such a dye would suitably peak at a shorter wavelength than a dye with symmetrical absorption band, but the exact position of the desired peak depends on several factors including the degree of asymmetry and the shapes and positions of the absorption bands of the magenta and yellow dyes with which it is associated.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      Recently, Lau et al., in U.S. Pat. No. 5,686,235, describe a particular class of cyan dye-forming coupler that has been shown to improve thermal stability and hue, particularly, with decreased absorption in side bands and an absorption band that is asymmetrical in nature.
      <br/>
      The couplers disclosed as suitable contain a sulfone group bonded to the 2-position of an acetamido group at the 5-position of the phenolic ring and contain a phenylcarbonamido group in the 2-position of the phenolic ring.
      <br/>
      Other related patents are U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,047,314, 5,047,315, 5,057,408, and 5,162,197.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      Although the coupler of Lau et al. provides an advantageous spectra, it is desirable to discover alternative phenolic structures that will accomplish the same result and that may provide other desirable features.
      <br/>
      Chemical variations may enable advances in the ability to better select the desired curve shape and wavelength of maximum absorption and other properties such as coupler and dye light and dark stability, reactivity etc.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      Japanese published application 59-111,645 suggests certain phenolic couplers having an  ALPHA -sulfonyl substituent in a 5-carbonamido substituent that forms a dye having a maximum absorption at "about 660 nm" with examples of 657-660 nm.
      <br/>
      It appears that the spectral curve of the disclosed dyes exhibit the usual broad absorption band but that the curve has been shifted to the long wavelength side in order to reduce the unwanted absorption on the short wavelength side.
      <br/>
      The disclosed compounds do not provide the desired narrow LBW and shorter wavelength of maximum absorption.

      The invention also provides a coupler of formula (I) and an imaging process employing the element.
      <br/>
      The cyan dye formed in the element of the invention exhibits an advantageous dye hue in having a reduced level of unwanted absorption on the short wavelength side of the spectrum.
    </p>
    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="21">
      The invention may be generally described as summarized above.
      <br/>
      The coupler is an "NB coupler" which is a narrow bandwidth coupler of formula (I) having substituents so that there is a reduction in left bandwidth in spin-coating form vs. solution form of at least 5 nm.
      <br/>
      In accordance with the procedure, a dye is formed by combining the coupler and the developer 4-amino-3-methyl-N-ethyl-N-(2-methanesulfonamidoethyl) aniline sesquisulfate hydrate.
      <br/>
      If the left bandwidth (LBW) of its absorption spectra upon "spin coating" of a 3% w/v solution of the dye in di-n-butyl sebacate solvent is at least 5 nm. less than the LBW for a solution of the same dye in acetonitrile, then the coupler is an "NB Coupler".
      <br/>
      The LBW of the spectral curve for a dye is the distance between the left side of the spectral curve and the wavelength of maximum absorption measured at a density of half the maximum.
    </p>
    <p num="22">
      The "spin coating" sample is prepared by first preparing a solution of the dye in di-n-butyl sebacate solvent (3% w/v).
      <br/>
      If the dye is insoluble, dissolution is achieved by the addition of methylene chloride.
      <br/>
      The solution is filtered and 0.1-0.2 ml is applied to a clear polyethylene terephthalate support (approximately 4 cm * 4 cm) and spun at 4,000 RPM using the Spin Coating equipment, Model No. EC101, available from Headway Research Inc., Garland Tex.
      <br/>
      The transmission spectra of the so prepared dye samples are then recorded.
    </p>
    <p num="23">Preferred "NB couplers" form a dye which has a LBW of the absorption spectra upon "spin coating" a sample of the dye in di-n-butyl sebacate which is at least 15 nm, preferably at least 25 nm, less than that of the same dye in acetonitrile solution.</p>

      The photographic elements can be single color elements or multicolor elements.
      <br/>
      Multicolor elements contain image dye-forming units sensitive to each of the three primary regions of the spectrum.

      Coupling-off groups are well known in the art.
      <br/>
      Such groups can determine the chemical equivalency of a coupler, i.e., whether it is a 2-equivalent or a 4-equivalent coupler, or modify the reactivity of the coupler.
      <br/>
      Such groups can advantageously affect the layer in which the coupler is coated, or other layers in the photographic recording material, by performing, after release from the coupler, functions such as dye formation, dye hue adjustment, development acceleration or inhibition, bleach acceleration or inhibition, electron transfer facilitation, and color correction.
    </p>
    <p num="59">
      The presence of hydrogen at the coupling site provides a 4-equivalent coupler, and the presence of another coupling-off group usually provides a 2-equivalent coupler.
      <br/>
      Representative classes of such coupling-off groups include, for example, chloro, alkoxy, aryloxy, hetero-oxy, sulfonyloxy, acyloxy, acyl, heterocyclyl, sulfonamido, mercaptotetrazole, benzothiazole, mercaptopropionic acid, phosphonyloxy, arylthio, and arylazo.
      <br/>
      These coupling-off groups are described in the art, for example, in U.S. Pat. Nos. 2,455,169, 3,227,551, 3,432,521, 3,476,563, 3,617,291, 3,880,661, 4,052,212 and 4,134,766; and in UK.

      In a preferred embodiment, the inhibitor moiety or group is selected from the following formulas:  (Chemical Structure image '13' not included in text)

    <p num="72">wherein RI is selected from the group consisting of straight and branched alkyls of from 1 to about 8 carbon atoms, benzyl, phenyl, and alkoxy groups and such groups containing none, one or more than one such substituent; RII is selected from RI and --SRI ; RIII is a straight or branched alkyl group of from 1 to about 5 carbon atoms and m is from 1 to 3; and RIV is selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, halogens and alkoxy, phenyl and carbonamido groups, --COORV and --NHCOORV wherein RV is selected from substituted and unsubstituted alkyl and aryl groups.</p>
    <p num="73">
      Although it is typical that the coupler moiety included in the developer inhibitor-releasing coupler forms an image dye corresponding to the layer in which it is located, it may also form a different color as one associated with a different film layer.
      <br/>
      It may also be useful that the coupler moiety included in the developer inhibitor-releasing coupler forms colorless products and/or products that wash out of the photographic material during processing (so-called "universal" couplers).

      A compound such as a coupler may release a PUG directly upon reaction of the compound during processing, or indirectly through a timing or linking group.
      <br/>
      A timing group produces the time-delayed release of the PUG such groups using an intramolecular nucleophilic substitution reaction (U.S. Pat. No. 4,248,962); groups utilizing an electron transfer reaction along a conjugated system (U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,409,323; 4,421,845; 4,861,701, Japanese Applications 57-188035; 58-98728; 58-209736; 58-209738); groups that function as a coupler or reducing agent after the coupler reaction (U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,438,193; 4,618,571) and groups that combine the features describe above.
      <br/>
      It is typical that the timing group is of one of the formulas:  (Chemical Structure image '14' not included in text)

      <br/>
      The oxygen atom of each timing group is bonded to the coupling-off position of the respective coupler moiety of the DIAR.
    </p>
    <p num="76">
      The timing or linking groups may also function by electron transfer down an unconjugated chain.
      <br/>
      Linking groups are known in the art under various names.
      <br/>
      Often they have been referred to as groups capable of utilizing a hemiacetal or iminoketal cleavage reaction or as groups capable of utilizing a cleavage reaction due to ester hydrolysis such as U.S. Pat. No. 4,546,073. This electron transfer down an unconjugated chain typically results in a relatively fast decomposition and the production of carbon dioxide, formaldehyde, or other low molecular weight by-products.

      <br/>
      Tabular grains are those having two parallel major crystal faces and having an aspect ratio of at least 2.
      <br/>
      The term "aspect ratio" is the ratio of the equivalent circular diameter (ECD) of a grain major face divided by its thickness (t).
      <br/>
      Tabular grain emulsions are those in which the tabular grains account for at least 50 percent (preferably at least 70 percent and optimally at least 90 percent) of the total grain projected area.
      <br/>
      Preferred tabular grain emulsions are those in which the average thickness of the tabular grains is less than 0.3 micrometer (preferably thin--that is, less than 0.2 micrometer and most preferably ultrathin--that is, less than 0.07 micrometer).
      <br/>
      The major faces of the tabular grains can lie in either +111} or +100} crystal planes.
      <br/>
      The mean ECD of tabular grain emulsions rarely exceeds 10 micrometers and more typically is less than 5 micrometers.

    <p num="86">
      The emulsions can be surface-sensitive emulsions, i.e., emulsions that form latent images primarily on the surfaces of the silver halide grains, or the emulsions can form internal latent images predominantly in the interior of the silver halide grains.
      <br/>
      The emulsions can be negative-working emulsions, such as surface-sensitive emulsions or unfogged internal latent image-forming emulsions, or direct-positive emulsions of the unfogged, internal latent image-forming type, which are positive-working when development is conducted with uniform light exposure or in the presence of a nucleating agent.
      <br/>
      Tabular grain emulsions of the latter type are illustrated by Evans et al. U.S. Pat. No. 4,504,570.
    </p>
    <p num="87">
      Photographic elements can be exposed to actinic radiation, typically in the visible region of the spectrum, to form a latent image and can then be processed to form a visible dye image.
      <br/>
      Processing to form a visible dye image includes the step of contacting the element with a color developing agent to reduce developable silver halide and oxidize the color developing agent.
      <br/>
      Oxidized color developing agent in turn reacts with the coupler to yield a dye.
      <br/>
      If desired "Redox Amplification" as described in Research Disclosure XVIIIB(5) may be used.
    </p>
    <p num="88">
      With negative-working silver halide, the processing step described above provides a negative image.
      <br/>
      One type of such element, referred to as a color negative film, is designed for image capture.
      <br/>
      Speed (the sensitivity of the element to low light conditions) is usually critical to obtaining sufficient image in such elements.
      <br/>
      Such elements are typically silver bromoiodide emulsions coated on a transparent support and are sold packaged with instructions to process in known color negative processes such as the Kodak C-41 process as described in The British Journal of Photography Annual of 1988, pages 191-198.
      <br/>
      If a color negative film element is to be subsequently employed to generate a viewable projection print as for a motion picture, a process such as the Kodak ECN-2 process described in the H-24 Manual available from Eastman Kodak Co. may be employed to provide the color negative image on a transparent support.
      <br/>
      Color negative development times are typically 3'15" or less and desirably 90 or even 60 seconds or less.
    </p>
    <p num="89">The photographic element of the invention can be incorporated into exposure structures intended for repeated use or exposure structures intended for limited use, variously referred to by names such as "single use cameras", "lens with film", or "photosensitive material package units".</p>
    <p num="90">
      Another type of color negative element is a color print.
      <br/>
      Such an element is designed to receive an image optically printed from an image capture color negative element.
      <br/>
      A color print element may be provided on a reflective support for reflective viewing (e.g. a snap shot) or on a transparent support for projection viewing as in a motion picture.
      <br/>
      Elements destined for color reflection prints are provided on a reflective support, typically paper, employ silver chloride emulsions, and may be optically printed using the so-called negative-positive process where the element is exposed to light through a color negative film which has been processed as described above.
      <br/>
      The element is sold packaged with instructions to process using a color negative optical printing process, for example the Kodak RA-4 process, as generally described in PCT WO 87/04534 or U.S. Pat. No. 4,975,357, to form a positive image.
      <br/>
      Color projection prints may be processed, for example, in accordance with the Kodak ECP-2 process as described in the H-24 Manual.
      <br/>
      Color print development times are typically 90 seconds or less and desirably 45 or even 30 seconds or less.
    </p>
    <p num="91">
      A reversal element is capable of forming a positive image without optical printing.
      <br/>
      To provide a positive (or reversal) image, the color development step is preceded by development with a non-chromogenic developing agent to develop exposed silver halide, but not form dye, and followed by uniformly fogging the element to render unexposed silver halide developable.
      <br/>
      Such reversal elements are typically sold packaged with instructions to process using a color reversal process such as the Kodak E-6 process as described in The British Journal of Photography Annual of 1988, page 194.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, a direct positive emulsion can be employed to obtain a positive image.
    </p>
    <p num="92">The above elements are typically sold with instructions to process using the appropriate method such as the mentioned color negative (Kodak C-41), color print (Kodak RA-4), or reversal (Kodak E-6) process.</p>

      A direct-view photographic element is defined as one which yields a color image that is designed to be viewed directly (1) by reflected light, such as a photographic paper print, (2) by transmitted light, such as a display transparency, or (3) by projection, such as a color slide or a motion picture print.
      <br/>
      These direct-view elements may be exposed and processed in a variety of ways.
      <br/>
      For example, paper prints, display transparencies, and motion picture prints are typically produced by optically printing an image from a color negative onto the direct-viewing element and processing though an appropriate negative-working photographic process to give a positive color image.
      <br/>
      Color slides may be produced in a similar manner but are more typically produced by exposing the film directly in a camera and processing through a reversal color process or a direct positive process to give a positive color image.
      <br/>
      The image may also be produced by alternative processes such as digital printing.
    </p>
    <p num="97">
      Each of these types of photographic elements has its own particular requirements for dye hue, but in general they all require cyan dyes that whose absorption bands are less deeply absorbing (that is, shifted away from the red end of the spectrum) than color negative films.
      <br/>
      This is because dyes in direct viewing elements are selected to have the best appearance when viewed by human eyes, whereas the dyes in color negative materials designed for optical printing are designed to best match the spectral sensitivities of the print materials.
    </p>
    <p num="98">
      The compound of the invention is a coupler compound as described in the foregoing description of the photographic element.
      <br/>
      The process of the invention includes a method of forming an image in the described silver halide element after the same has been exposed to light comprising contacting the exposed element with a color developing compound such as a para phenylene diamine.

Bailey, JCS Perkin 1, 1977, 2047, the dyes of the couplers in Table 1 below were prepared by coupling with 4-amino-3-methyl-N-ethyl-N-(2-methane-sulfonamidoethyl) aniline sesquisulfate hydrate, then purified by either crystallization or chromatographic techniques.</p>
    <p num="113">
      A 3% w/v solution of di-n-butyl sebacate was made with ethyl acetate and from this solution a 3% solution of the dye was prepared.
      <br/>
      If the dye was insoluble, dissolution was achieved by the addition of some methylene chloride.
      <br/>
      The solution was filtered and 0.1-0.2 mL was applied to a clear polyethylene-terephthalate support (approximately 4 cm * 4 cm) and spun at 4,000 RPM using the Spin-Coating equipment, Model No. EC101, available from Headway Research Inc., Garland Tex.
      <br/>
      The transmission spectra of the so-prepared dye samples were then recorded.
      <br/>
      The transmission spectra of the same dye in acetonitrile was also measured.
    </p>
    <p num="114">
      The  LAMBDA max values, "half bandwidth" (HBW), and "left bandwidth" (LBW) values for each spectra are reported in Table 1 below.
      <br/>
      The wavelength of maximum absorption was recorded as the  LAMBDA max.
      <br/>
      The half bandwidth (HBW) was obtained by subtracting the wavelength at the point where the density is half the value of the maximum density on the left side (short wavelength) of the absorption band from the wavelength at the point on the right side (long wavelength) of the absorption band where the density is half the value of the maximum density.
      <br/>
      The left bandwidth (LBW) was obtained by subtracting the wavelength at the point on the left side (short wavelength) of the absorption band where the density is half the value of the maximum density from the wavelength of maximum density.
    </p>
    <p num="115">
      In solution, all of the dyes (invention and comparison) have similar LBW values ranging from 63-66 nm.
      <br/>
      Upon spin-coating, the LBW values of the dyes of the invention are 27-33 nm less than the LBW values of the same dyes in solution.
      <br/>
      These couplers thus meet the criterion defined for "NB couplers".
      <br/>
      The spin-coating LBW values for the dyes from the comparison couplers are different from the solution LBW values by no more than 1 nm, and thus the comparison couplers are not "NB couplers".

      The spectra of the resulting dyes were measured and normalized to a maximum absorption of 1.00. The wavelength of maximum absorption was recorded as the " LAMBDA max." As a measure of the sharpness of the curve on the left (short wavelength) side of the absorption band the "left bandwidth" (LBW) was obtained by subtracting the wavelength at the point on the left side of the absorption band where the normalized density is 0.50 from the  LAMBDA max.
      <br/>
      A lower value of LBW indicates a reduction in the unwanted green absorption and is thus desirable.
      <br/>

      The data in Tables 1, 2, 3 and 4 show that all of the cyan image couplers of the present invention form image dyes that are shifted hypsochromically and at the same time have spectra that are very sharp cutting on the short wavelength side of their absorption bands.
      <br/>
      These sharp-cutting absorption dye curves are indicated by the unusually smaller values for the left bandwidth (LBW) than those of the dyes from the comparison couplers.
      <br/>
      Thus the dyes from the couplers of the invention have less unwanted green and blue absorption than the dyes from the comparison couplers, resulting in superior color reproduction and high color saturation.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, this advantage is realized even when the couplers are dispersed in a wide variety of coupler solvents, indicating that the couplers of the present invention have great robustness.
