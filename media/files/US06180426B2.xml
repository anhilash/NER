    <p num="2">
      This invention relates to structures and methods of assembly of integrated circuit chips into interconnected multiple chip circuits.
      <br/>
      More particularly, this invention relates to "chip-on-chip" structures connected physically and electrically.

    <p num="4">
      The manufacture of embedded Dynamic Random Access Memory (DRAM) requires that process parameters that enhance the performance of the logic or the DRAM, if separately formed on semiconductor chips, be compromised when DRAM is embedded into an array of logic gates on the same semiconductor chip.
      <br/>
      This compromise has limited the application of embedded DRAM.
      <br/>
      If there is no compromise in the process parameters to enhance the performance of logic or the DRAM embedded DRAM, the manufacture process becomes very complicated and costly.
      <br/>
      Moreover, because of the structure of the embedded DRAM and the logic, burn-in of the embedded DRAM is not possible and embedding of DRAM with logic is not a reliable design solution.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      A "chip-on-chip" structure is a viable alternative to embedded DRAM.
      <br/>
      With multiple chips connected in intimate contact, the process parameters that maximize the performance of the DRAM chip and the logic gates can be applied during manufacture.
      <br/>
      Refer to FIG. 1 for a description of a "chip-on-chip" structure 100.
      <br/>
      Such a "chip-on-chip" structure is described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,534,465 (Frye et al.).
      <br/>
      A first integrated circuit chip 105 is attached physically and electrically to a second integrated circuit chip 110 by means of an area array of solder bumps 115.
      <br/>
      The process of forming an area array of solder bumps 115 is well known in the art and is discussed in Frye et al. 465. The second chip 110 is then secured physically to a substrate 120.
      <br/>
      Electrical connections 125 between the second integrated circuit chip 110 and external circuitry (not shown) are created as either wire bonds or tape automated bonds.
      <br/>
      The module further has a ball grid array 130 to secure the structure to a next level of packaging containing the external circuitry.
      <br/>
      Generally, an encasing material 135 is placed over the "chip-on-chip" structure 100 to provide environmental protection for the "chip-on-chip" 100.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      U.S. Pat. No. 5,481,205 (Frye et al.) teaches a structure for making temporary connections to integrated circuit chips having "solder bumps" or connection structures such as ball grid arrays.
      <br/>
      The temporary connections allow temporary contacting of the integrated circuit chip during testing of the integrated circuit chip.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      The handling of wafers from which the integrated circuit chips are formed and the handling of the integrated circuit chip themselves causes the integrated circuit chips to be subjected to electrostatic discharge (ESD) voltages.
      <br/>
      Even though connections between the first integrated circuit chip 105 and the second integrated circuit chip 110 are relatively short and under normal operation would not be subjected to ESD voltages, require ESD protection circuitry to be formed within the interchip interface circuit to provide protection or necessary driving capacity for the first integrated circuit chip 105 and the second integrated circuit chip 110 during burn-in and other manufacturing monitoring processes.

      U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,731,945 and 5,807,791 (Bertin et al.) teach a method for fabricating programmable ESD protection circuits for multichip semiconductor structures.
      <br/>
      The interchip interface circuit on each integrated circuit chip is formed with an ESD protection circuit and a switch to selectively connect the ESD protection circuit to an input/output pad.
      <br/>
      This allows multiple identical chips to be interconnected and redundant ESD protection removed.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      The circuits at the periphery of integrated circuit chips generally are specialized to meet the requirements standardized specifications.
      <br/>
      These include relatively high current and voltage drivers and receivers for communicating on relatively long transmission line media.
      <br/>
      Alternately, as shown in U.S. Pat. No. 5,461,333 (Condon et al.) the interface may be differential to allow lower voltages on the transmission line media.
      <br/>
      This requires two input/output pads for transfer of signals.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      U.S. Pat. No. 5,818,748 (Bertin et al.) illustrates a separation of chip function onto separate integrated circuits chips.
      <br/>
      This allows the optimization of the circuits.
      <br/>
      In this case, EEPROM is on one integrated circuits chip and drivers and decoders are on another.
      <br/>
      The chips are placed face to face and secured with force responsive self-interlocking micro-connectors.

      Not shown is the forming of the first integrated circuit chip on a silicon wafer.
      <br/>
      The first integrated circuit chip is tested on the wafer and nonfunctioning chips are identified.
      <br/>
      The wafer is separated into the individual chips.
      <br/>
      The functioning first integrated circuit chips 105 then are "flip-chip" mounted on the second integrated circuit chip 110 on the wafer 200.
      <br/>
      The wafer 200 is then separated into the "chip-on-chip" structures 100.

      The "chip-on-chip" structures 100 are then mounted on the modules as above described.

    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="12">
      An object of this invention is to provide a multiple integrated circuit chip structure where the interchip communication between integrated circuit chips of the structure have no ESD protection circuits and no input/output circuitry.
      <br/>
      The interchip communication is between internal circuits with a minimal electrical load.
    </p>
    <p num="13">Another object of this invention is to provide a circuit to selectively connect internal circuits of the integrated circuits to test interface circuits having ESD protection circuits and input/output circuitry designed to communicate with test systems during assembly and test.</p>
    <p num="14">
      To accomplish these and other objects, a multiple interconnected integrated circuit chip structure has a first integrated circuit chip mounted a second integrated circuit chip to physically and electrically connect the first integrated circuit chip to the second integrated circuit chip.
      <br/>
      The first integrated circuit chip may be mounted to the second integrated circuit chip by means of an area array of solder bumps.
      <br/>
      The first integrated circuit chip has interchip interface circuits connected to the second integrated circuit chip to communicate between internal circuits of the first and second integrated circuit chips and test circuits.
      <br/>
      The test circuits are connected to the internal circuits of the first integrated circuit chip to provide stimulus and response to the internal circuits during testing procedures.
    </p>
    <p num="15">
      The second integrated circuit chip has input/output interface circuitry to communicate with external circuitry connected to the second integrated circuit chip and to protect the second integrated circuit chip from electrostatic discharge voltages.
      <br/>
      Further, the second integrated circuit has interchip interface circuits connected to the first integrated circuit chip to communicate between the internal circuits of the first and second integrated circuit chips, and with test circuits.
      <br/>
      The test circuits are connected to the internal circuits of the second integrated circuit chip to provide stimulus to and response from the internal circuits during testing and burn-in procedures.
    </p>
    <p num="16">
      The interchip interface circuitry has an internal interface circuit for transferring electrical signals between the internal circuits of the second integrated circuit chip to the first integrated circuit chip.
      <br/>
      The interchip interface circuitry further has a mode select switch to selectively connect between the internal circuits of the first integrated circuits chip and the second integrated circuits chip or to the test interface circuits.
      <br/>
      The mode switch has three terminals and a control terminal.
      <br/>
      The first terminal is connected to an output of the internal interface circuit, a second terminal connected to the internal circuitry, and the third terminal connected to test circuits.
      <br/>
      A mode selector is connected to the control terminal.
      <br/>
      The state of the mode selector determines the connection between the first terminal and thus the output of the internal interface circuit, the second terminal and thus the internal circuitry, and the third terminal and thus the test interface.
      <br/>
      During normal operation, the first terminal is connected to the second terminal such that the internal circuits of the first and second integrated circuits are connected through their respective internal interfaces.
      <br/>
      During test and burn-in, the internal circuits are connected to the test circuits.
    </p>
    <p num="17">
      The test circuits are formed of a test interface circuit and an ESD protection device.
      <br/>
      The test interface circuit connected to communicate test signals from external test circuitry to the first and second integrated circuit chips.
      <br/>
      The ESD protection device protects the first and second integrated circuit chips from electrostatic discharge voltages.
      <br/>

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="20">
      A "chip-on-chip" structure 300 is shown in FIG. 3.
      <br/>
      A first integrated circuit chip 305 is attached to a second integrated circuit chip 310 by means of an area array of solder bumps 315 as described above.
      <br/>
      The second integrated circuit chip 310 is secured physically to the module 320.
      <br/>
      The electrical connections 325 are either wire bonds or TAB bonds.
      <br/>
      The module 320 has a ball grid array 330 to attach the "chip-on-chip" structure within the module to a next level of electronic package.
    </p>
    <p num="21">
      The first integrated circuit chip 305 has internal circuits 335, which are the functional electronic components of the first integrated circuit chip 305.
      <br/>
      The internal circuits 335 may be DRAM, logic, or other integrated circuits.
      <br/>
      Likewise, the second integrated circuit chip 310 has the internal circuits 365.
      <br/>
      The internal circuits 365 are the functional electronic components of the second integrated circuit chips 310.
      <br/>
      These internal circuits also may be DRAM, logic, or other integrated circuits.
      <br/>
      To transfer signals between the internal circuits 335 of the first integrated circuit chip 305 and the internal circuits 365 of the second chip 310 or to an external test system, the internal circuits 335 are connected to the interchip interface circuits 340.
      <br/>
      The interchip interface circuits 340 are connected through the input/output pads 345 to the area array of solder bumps 315 and thus to the second chip 310.
      <br/>
      This connection is functional during normal operation, when the first integrated circuit chip 305 is mounted to the second integrated circuit chip 310.
    </p>
    <p num="22">
      The interchip interface circuit 340 also is connected to the test interface 350.
      <br/>
      The test interface circuit 350 is connected to the test input/output pads 355.
      <br/>
      The test interface circuit 350 is functionally active during testing procedures, when test system probes are brought in contact with the test input/output pads 355.
      <br/>
      The test system probes provide test stimuli and receive response from the internal circuits 335.
    </p>
    <p num="23">
      The mode select 390 for the first integrated circuit chip 305 is accomplished by placing an appropriate logic level on the mode select input/output pads 391 and 392.
      <br/>
      When the first integrated circuit chip 305 is in contact with a test system during wafer testing or die testing during burn-in, the mode select input/output pad 391 is brought to a first logic level (0) to cause the interchip interface circuit 340 to transfer signals between the internal circuits 335 and the test interface 350.
      <br/>
      The test signals are then transferred between the test interface 350 and the test input/output pad 355 as described above.
    </p>
    <p num="24">
      When the first integrated circuit chip 305 is mounted to the second integrated circuit chip 310, the mode select line 390 is brought to a second logic level (1) through the mode select input/output pad 392.
      <br/>
      The second logic level (1) is a voltage equal to the power supply voltage source VDD and is achieved by connecting the mode select input output pad 392 to the mode select input/output pad 393 on the second integrated circuit chip 310 through the solder ball 394.
      <br/>
      The mode select input/output pad 393 is connected directly to the power supply voltage source VDD to achieve the second logic level (1).
      <br/>
      When the mode select line 390 is at the second logic level (1), the interchip interface 340 transfers signals of the internal circuits 335 to the input/output pads 345 to the second integrated circuit chip 310 as described above.
    </p>
    <p num="25">
      The internal circuits 365 of the second integrated circuit chip 310 likewise are connected to the interchip interface circuit 360.
      <br/>
      The interchip interface circuits 360 are connected to the input/output pads 370 and thus to the first integrated circuit chip 310 through the area array of solder bumps 315.
      <br/>
      The interchip interface circuits 360 are connected to the test interface circuits 375.
    </p>
    <p num="26">
      The internal circuits 365 of the second integrated circuit chip 310 are connected to the input/output interface 385.
      <br/>
      The input/output interface is connected to the input/output pad 395, which is connected to the module 320 through the bondwire 325.
      <br/>
      The input/output interface provides the circuitry to transfer signals between the internal circuits 365 and the external circuits attached through the next packaging level to the ball grid array 330 and thus to the wirebond 325.
    </p>
    <p num="27">
      The second integrated circuit chip 310 is tested prior to separation of a wafer containing the second integrated circuit chip 310, by bringing test probes or needles of the test system in contact with the input/output pads 395 and the test input/output pads 377.
      <br/>
      Subsequent to dicing of the wafer into individual second integrated circuit chips 310, the individual second integrated circuit chips 310 are mounted in a burn-in apparatus.
      <br/>
      The burn-in apparatus again is brought in contact with the input/output pads 395 and the test input/output pads 377 to provide stressing signals to the circuits of the second integrated circuit chip 310.
      <br/>
      Then, when the first integrated circuit chip 305 is mounted to the second integrated circuit chip 310, operation of the whole "chip-on-chip" assembly 300 is verified by attaching testing probes or contacts to the ball grid array 330.
      <br/>
      Signals from the testing probes are transferred between the circuits of the whole "chip-on-chip" assembly 300 through the bond wires 325 to the input/output pads 395.
    </p>
    <p num="28">
      The mode select 380 for the second integrated circuit chip 310 is accomplished by placing an appropriate logic level on the mode select input/output pads 381 and 382.
      <br/>
      When the second integrated circuit chip 310 is in contact with a test system during wafer testing or die testing during burn-in, the mode select input/output pad 381 is brought to a first logic level (0) to cause the interchip interface circuit 360 to transfer signals between the internal circuits 365 and the test interface 375.

    <p num="29">
      When the first integrated circuit chip 305 is mounted to the second integrated circuit chip 310, the mode select line 380 is brought to a second logic level (1) through the mode select input/output pad 382.

      The second logic level (1) is achieved by connecting the mode select input output pad 382 to the mode select input/output pad 383 on the first integrated circuit chip 305 through the solder ball 384.
      <br/>
      The mode select input/output pad 383 is connected directly to the power supply voltage source VDD to achieve the second logic level (1).
      <br/>
      When the mode select line 380 is at the second logic level (1), the interchip interface 360 transfers signals of the internal circuits 365 to the input/output pads 370 to the first integrated circuit chip 305 as described above.
    </p>
    <p num="30">
      The input/output interface circuit 385 has an input/output buffer 389 connected to the internal circuits 365.
      <br/>
      The input/output buffer 389 is either a driver or receiver necessary to translate the signal levels of the internal circuits 365 to the signal levels of the external circuits and the signal levels of the external circuits to the signal levels of the internal circuit 365.
      <br/>
      The input/output buffer is connected to the input/output pad 395 and to the ESD protection circuit 387.
      <br/>
      The ESD protection circuit 387 clamps excess ESD voltages to prevent damage to the input/output buffer 389 and the internal circuits 365 from ESD voltages brought in contact with the input/output pad 395 from the external environment.
