    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="1">(a) Field of the Invention</p>
    <p num="2">This invention relates to detection of Helicobacter pylori (hereinafter called H. pylori), source bacterium of gastrointestinal disorders, and in particular relates to an H. pylori detecting composition produced by applying a phenate method for ammonium ion's quantitative determination to a conventional urease enzyme test and relates to a detecting kit and method using this composition.</p>
    <p num="3">(b) Description of the Related Art</p>
    <p num="4">
      H. pylori is noted as a source bacterium causing gastrointestinal disorders including gastric cancer and gastroduodenal ulcers, and the WHO has prescribed H. pylori as a typed carcinogen.
      <br/>
      Precise diagnosis, i.e., accurate detection of H. pylori, should be promoted to cure gastrointestinal disorders caused by this H. pylori. H. pylori detecting methods being used up to now can be divided mainly into two types, i.e., non-invasive tests not using an endoscope and invasive tests using an endoscope to get biopsy tissue for detection purposes.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      Non-invasive tests include serology tests and 13 C or 14 C Breath tests.
      <br/>
      Serology tests measuring H. pylori antibodies have a problem in that the existence of the antibody does not necessarily mean that diseases are developing because it takes more than 6 months for antibody levels to drop after the cure of diseases.
      <br/>
      The 13 C or 14 C Breath test uses the principle that if urea marked with 13 C or 14 C is ingested, it is transformed into marked CO2 in the stomach if H. pylori exists and detected in exhaled air.
      <br/>
      However, the method is not usually used because it involves high cost equipment.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      On the other hand, invasive tests are more commonly used to detect H. pylori.
      <br/>
      Invasive tests detecting methods using biopsy tissues samples collected during an endoscoping includes histology, the PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction) method, culturing, and the urease enzyme test.
      <br/>
      Histology is a method confirming the existence of H. pylori through general tissue research, the PCR method is a method confirming the existence of H. pylori by using chain reaction of polymerization enzyme, and culturing is a method of directly cultivating H. pylori from biopsy tissue.
      <br/>
      However, there is a problem in that all these methods are difficult and take much time, so they can not be used commercially.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      The urease enzyme test, which can be used easily in the endoscope chamber and is the most efficient method, uses the fact that H. pylori produces urease enzyme which has a much higher degree of activity compared to other microorganisms.
      <br/>
      That is, if urease exists urea added in the detecting kit decomposes and ammonia is produced to cause pH to be increased making a pH indicator react and change color.
      <br/>
      A H. pylori detecting method measures the activity degree of urease like this.
      <br/>
      Commercialized kits using the urease enzyme test now are "CLOtest" (U.S. Pat. No. 4,748,113), "Hpfast" (U.S. Pat. No. 5,439,801) and "Pyloritek" (U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,314,804 and 5,420,016).
      <br/>
      Compositions used in "CLOtest" include 10.about.40 g/l of urea, 1.about.5 g/l of bactericide, an available quantity of pKa 6.5.about.8.5 indicator (phenol red) and the remainder being water, having a 5 0 (slashed zero) about.6.5 pH. However, the CLOtest has problems in that the positive rate vary with the readers because the reaction speed of urease that the above compositions and H. pylori produce is slow.
      <br/>
      Therefore, diagnosis is possible only after about 24 hours and it is not possible to obtain diagnostic results on the endoscope examination date which requires that the patient inconveniently visit the hospital once more.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, the various colors appearing after more than 24 hours makes accurate diagnosis difficult.
      <br/>
      Hpfast is fundamentally similar to the CLOtest, but different in that cell wall detergent is added and uses as an indicator mixture of phenol red, methyl red, and bromothymol blue.
      <br/>
      With Hpfast, an H. pylori positive is determined from a dark green color of pH 6.2 and a light green color of pH 6.0 is determined as an H. pylori negative.
      <br/>
      However, the accurate reading of this dark green and light green colors is difficult.
      <br/>
      Pyloritek uses a multilayer test device differently from the above mentioned CLOtest and Hpfast, the main characteristics of this is that the urease reacting part and reacted product as an ammonia detecting part are on different layers and the pHs of each layers are different.
      <br/>
      Although Pyloritek can produce diagnosis results within one hour, the false positive rate increases if the determination time exceeds one hour.
      <br/>
      Therefore, there is an increasing possibility of false positives if an accurate reaction time is not adhered to during the endoscope examination.
    </p>
    <p num="8">Moreover, the above mentioned urease enzyme methods including the CLOtest, Pyloritek, etc. could also react with the small amounts of low activity urease which bacilli such as Staphylococcus hominis, Streptococcus salivarius, E. aerofaciens, L. fermentum, etc. have and false positive rates could be increased in cases of long decision times.</p>

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
    <p num="14">
      In the following detailed description, only the preferred embodiment of the invention has been shown and described, simply by way of illustration of the best mode contemplated by the inventors of carrying out the invention.
      <br/>
      As will be realized, the invention is capable of modification in various obvious respects, all without departing from the invention.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, the drawings and description are to be regarded as illustrative in nature, and not restrictive.
    </p>
    <p num="15">Hereinafter, further details of this invention are explained as follows:</p>
    <p num="16">
      In detecting H. pylori, the inventors tried to substantially lower false positive rates due to the subjectivity of the readers by transforming the existing urease enzyme tests from the methods conventionally used to a composition that uses a speedy change of colors that enables an accurate determination to be made rapidly by comparing the test results simultaneously with positive and negative controls.
      <br/>
      Namely, since test kits using existing urease enzyme tests detect the pH increase caused by OH- ions produced from the reaction of water with the ammonia generated by simply decomposing urea, the inventors tried to eliminate the ammonium ions themselves in order to increase the rate of pH change.
      <br/>
      To do this, the inventors applied the phenate method (Standard Methods for the Examination of Water and Wastewater 19th ed. 1995, American Public Health Association, pp 4-80.about.4-82.) used in quantification of ammonium ions.
    </p>
    <p num="17">The Urea decomposition process by urease is presented as following reaction formula:</p>
    <p num="18">
      �reaction formula 1�
      <br/>
      (NH2)2 CO+2H2 O --&gt; 2NH3 +H2 CO3 (irreversible reaction)
    </p>
    <p num="19">

      <br/>
      H2 CO3 +character pullout}H+ +HCO3- (reversible reaction)
      <br/>
      2NH3 +2H2 O+character pullout}2NH4+ +2OH- (reversible reaction)
      <br/>
      Total reaction: (NH2)2 CO+4H2 O --&gt; 2NH430 +20H- +H+ +HCO3-
    </p>
    <p num="20">
      The constituents of this present invention increase pH promptly by transforming the products of the above described urea decomposition process, i.e., ammonium ions, into indophenol blue to continue urea decomposition.
      <br/>
      In order to achieve the above described purpose, the phenate method, a remarkably effective method of measuring ammonia concentration in the aqueous solution, is applied.
      <br/>
      The phenate method, using the principle that ammonia under a manganic catalyst reacts with hypochlorite base and phenol to change into indophenol blue, can be described as the following reaction formula:
      <br/>
      �reaction formula 2 �
      <br/>
      2NH4+ +OCl- +2C6 H5 OH --&gt; O.dbd.C6 H4.dbd.N--C6 H4 --NH2
    </p>
    <p num="21">That is, the constituents of this invention make the reaction speed faster in order to increase pH rapidly by adding phenate reagent solution to constituents used in the conventional urease enzyme test and transforming ammonium ion generated in the urea decomposition process by the above described urease into indophenol blue.</p>
    <p num="22">
      Additionally, NaOCl is among the constituents that acts to reduce false positives that follow increased concentrations due to urease from bacilli as it has an inhibiting effect on weak urease activity.
      <br/>
      This also allows test results to be obtained after longer testing time periods.
    </p>
    <p num="23">
      In this invention, the added quantity of phenate reagent solution is adjusted within a range so that H. pylori urease activity is not inhibited and color change of the pH indicator is not affected.
      <br/>
      This invention's constituents and the possible content range of each components is as below:
      <br/>
      urea from 0.5 to 4 vol %,
      <br/>
      KH2 PO4 from 0.05 to 0.2 vol %,
      <br/>
      phenate reagent solution from 0.8 to 1.7 vol %,
      <br/>
      0.002.about 0 (slashed zero) 005 vol % of an indicator having pKa from 6.5 to 8.5 and a balance of water
    </p>
    <p num="24">
      From the above described composition, urea acts as a urease substrate which H. pylori produces, about 0.5.about.4 vol % of content is an appropriate level to measure activity of urease which H. pylori produces.
      <br/>
      KH2 PO4 acting as a buffer solution should include 0.05.about 0 (slashed zero) 2 vol %, i.e., it can not obtain desired the pH range at lower than 0.05 vol % and tends to inhibit pH change at higher than 0.2 vol %. The phenate reagent solution, acting to transform ammonium ions into indophenol blue and to inhibit urease activities of other microorganisms should be included at 0.8.about.1.7 vol %, i.e, at lower than 0.8 vol % the effect of increasing the pH change speed by eliminating ammonium ions and the inhibiting effect of urease activity of other microorganisms are insufficient, while at higher than 1.7 vol % pH is increased much too high and the urease activities of other microorganisms as well as H. pylori tend to be inhibited.
      <br/>
      An indicator having a pKa from 6.5.about.8.5 acts to sense pH change, with phenol red being the most appropriate in this invention, preferably between 0.002.about 0 (slashed zero) 005 vol % for the precise determination.
      <br/>
      Phenol red has characteristics of showing yellow in an acid solution and a purplish-red color in a basic solution.
    </p>
    <p num="25">
      The above described phenate reagent solution containing in detail a manganous sulfate solution acting as a catalyst, hypochlorite reagent acting as a reactant reacted with ammonium ions and phenate reagent, and is especially desirably composed of 1 vol % manganous sulfate solution, 0.5 vol % hypochlorite reagent and 0.2 vol % phenate reagent.
      <br/>
      Moreover, it is further desirable that this constituent contains 0.5.about.2 vol % of a gelling agent, e.g., agar, as it can then be used conveniently in the form of a soft gel.
      <br/>
      It is preferable that constituent is controlled in the range of pH 6 0 (slashed zero) about.7.8 because it aides precise determination when the pH is kept in this range.
    </p>
    <p num="26">Further desirable components and contents range of this invention's constituents are as follows:</p>
    <p num="27">2 vol % urea, 0.05 vol % KH2 PO4, 1 vol % manganous sulfate solution, 0.5 vol % hypochlorite reagent, 0.2 vol % phenate reagent, 0.0025 vol % phenol red, 1 vol % agar, and a balance of water.</p>
    <p num="28">On the other hand, desirable components and contents of stock solution of phenate reagent solution used in this invention are as follows:</p>
    <p num="29">Manganous sulfate solution; 0.05 vol % MnSO4 H2 O, and a balance of distilled water,</p>
    <p num="30">Hypochlorite reagent; 1 vol % NaOCl, and a balance of distilled water,</p>
    <p num="31">Phenate reagent; 2.5 vol % NaOH, 8 vol % phenol, and a balance of distilled water.</p>
    <p num="32">
      This invention is to react with the above described constituents by placing biopsy tissue obtained through an endoscope on the gell made of the above described constituents and observe color change.
      <br/>
      The gell is made of he above described constituents and a positive control gell is produced by adding to the above described constituents a minimum quantity of NaOH that can show positive results, i.e., 10.about.20  MU l 0.1 N NaOH solution.
      <br/>
      A determination can be made as to whether or not there is an H. pylori infection comparing the color of the negative control gell in which NaOH is not added at all.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, a test device with positive and negative controls placed side by side for comparison at a glance with colors indicating positive or negative results will decrease erroneous test results due to the subjectivity of the reader.
    </p>
    <p num="33">
      A perspective view of a detecting kit according to this invention is presented in FIG. 1 and side view in FIG. 2, respectively.
      <br/>
      An application example of a detecting kit according to this invention is also presented in FIG. 3.
      <br/>
      Referring to the above described FIGS. 1 to 3, 1 is a cover, 2 is a container, most desirably a transparent container made of an acrylic material, 3 is detecting composition according to this invention, 4 is a test device, 5 is the biopsy specimen area, desirably opaquely treated such that biopsy specimen is not seen from the side, 6 is the negative control, 7 is the positive control and 8 is the biopsy sample.

      A desirable practical example and comparative example of this invention are described.
      <br/>
      However, the below described practical example is only one of practical examples of this invention and this invention is not limited to the below described practical example.
    </p>
    <p num="35">�Practical Example 1�</p>
    <p num="36">Making H. pylori detecting compositions</p>
    <p num="37">First the below described composition of stock solution was prepared;</p>
    <p num="38">20 vol % urea, 2 vol % KH2 PO4, 0.01 vol % phenol red, and 2 vol % agar.</p>
    <p num="39">
      As stock solution of phenate reagent, 100 ml of manganous sulfate solution was made by adding distilled water to MnSO4 H2O 50 mg, 100 ml of hypochlorite reagent was made by adding distilled water to 10 ml of 10% NaOCl and the pH was adjusted to 6.8 with concentrated hypochloric acid. 100 ml of phenate reagent was prepared by adding distilled water to 2.5 g of NaOH and 8 ml of phenol.
      <br/>
      After the above described agar solution was autoclaved (121 (degree)  C., 1.5 atm) for 15 minutes, it was left alone until it is used in the water tank at 55 (degree)  C. and the below described 2 X reagent were produced.
    </p>
    <p num="40">
      A 50 ml mixture was made by mixing the above described 10 ml urea stock solution, 2.5 ml KH2 PO4 stock solution, 25 ml phenol red stock solution, 1 ml manganous sulfate solution, 0.5 ml hypochlorite reagent and 0.2 ml phenate reagent and adding distilled water.
      <br/>
      After bacilli of the above described produced 2 X reagent were filtered out by 0.2  MU m filters, the same amount as 2% agar solution was mixed.
      <br/>
      As a result of that, the final concentration of the constituents was as below and the final pH was 7.5 at this time:
    </p>
    <p num="41">2% urea, 0.05% KH2 PO4, 0.0005% manganous sulfate, 0.005% NaOCl, 0.2% phenate reagent (0.005% NaOH, 0.016% phenol), 0.0025% phenol red and 1% agar.</p>

      The composition manufactured from example 1 was injected into one wall of a multiwall plate, test device with biopsy tissue obtained from an endoscope, a positive control was made by injecting into another wall the composition manufactured and by further adding 10  MU l of 0.1 N NaOH to the above described composition, a negative control was made by injecting the above described composition into another wall, thereby making an H. pylori detecting kit.

      The above described detecting kit is called "PET (Pylori Easy Test) kit".

    <p num="48">
      As a result, PET could confirm 76.9% of total positives within one hour and 100% after 3 hours.
      <br/>
      On the other hand, CLOtest could confirm only 17.6.about.30% of the positives and 100% only after 24 hours.
      <br/>
      However, uncertain color which could not be distinguished distinctly appeared after 24 hours and the positive rate was varied from 38.4% (10/26) to 65.3% (17/26) depending on the observers.
      <br/>
      Therefore, we can see that rapid dtermination is possible in the case where PET is used according to this invention.
    </p>
    <p num="49">
      After that, we observed the degree of consistency of PET results with the PCR method.
      <br/>
      Here, the PCR method used an amplifying method of 26 kDa protein gene, a method known as the most unique and sensitive in H. pylori detection (Ho, S, et al. 1991, Direct Polymerase Chain Reaction Test for detection of H. pylori in Human and Animals, J. Clin. Microbiol, 29 pp 2543.about.2549).

      From table 3 and table 4, if PET according to this invention is used, it is notable that precise judgement is possible on biopsy tissue in which urease activity of H. pylori was decreased to certain degree. +p This invention could provide H. pylori detecting compositions which tell promptly and precisely whether or not an H. pylori infection (the source bacterium causing gastrointestinal disorders) exists, and the same results can be obtained even after time has elapsed and the compositions are easily used in an endoscope chamber.
