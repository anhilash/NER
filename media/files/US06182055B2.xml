      <br/>
      In a negotiation performed among a plurality of inferring units that are mutually connected through a network, at any time of which a consistent inferred state is obtained, the inferred state is accepted by the units as a settled inferred state.
      <br/>
      Since each inferring unit can perform an inference based on the settled inferred state, the inference can be effectively performed.
      <br/>
      Particularly, when a negotiation is hierarchically performed (hierarchical negotiation) or when a plurality of negotiations are performed in parallel (multi-negotiation), each negotiation can be consistently effected.
      <br/>
      In addition, in a negotiating process, each inferring unit negotiates with other inferring units using negotiation strategies having a standpoint of priority (role) and tolerance (transaction) of a request in the negotiation.
      <br/>
      In addition, each inferring unit autonomously changes the negotiation strategies for use corresponding to the negotiation history, the current internal state, and the current external state.
      <br/>
      Thus, proper negotiation strategies can be used for a complicated problem.
      <br/>
      Consequently, a negotiation can be easily effected.

    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="1">
      1.
      <br/>
      Field of the Invention
    </p>
    <p num="2">The present invention relates to a cooperative inferring apparatus for causing a plurality of agents or a plurality of inferring agents to perform an inference in cooperation or in parallel so as to solve a problem, a cooperative inferring method thereof, a record medium recording a program thereof, and a cooperative inferring system thereof.</p>
    <p num="3">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
    <p num="4">As computer network technologies have advanced, computer systems have been changed from centralized systems of which host computers perform all processes thereof to distributed systems of which a plurality of computers that are connected through a network perform respective processes.</p>
    <p num="5">In a problem solving method using an artificial intelligence technology of which a problem is solved by causing a computer to imitate a problem solving process of humans, a distributed problem solving method that uses a plurality of inferring units rather than a centralized problem solving method for causing one inferring unit to perform all processes has been proposed.</p>
    <p num="6">
      In the distributed problem solving method, each inferring unit assigns an individual problem solving criterion and infers a process thereof.
      <br/>
      However, since inferred results of individual inferring units may contradict each other or a problem cannot be solved without a cooperation of other inferring units, it is preferred to cause information to be exchanged among inferring units so that the respective processes are corrected and consistently performed.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      The process for exchanging information is referred to as negotiation.
      <br/>
      So far, a variety of negotiation protocols such as contract net protocol and integrated negotiation protocol have been proposed.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      The contract net protocol imitates the principles of a market and proposes the process for exchanging information for assigning a task.
      <br/>
      In this case, a problem that takes place in a problem solving process and that cannot be solved by one inferring unit and a problem that can be effectively solved by another inferring are referred to as task.
      <br/>
      When an inferring unit that has a task publicizes it (this inferring unit is referred to as manager), the other inferring units (they are referred to as contractors) infer whether or not to contract with the manager to execute the task depending on their situations.
      <br/>
      When a contractor is in a situation of which it can contact with the manager for the task, it tenders for the task.
      <br/>
      Any inferring unit becomes a manager when it publicizes a task.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      When a contractor tenders for a publicized task, it attaches the cost thereof.
      <br/>
      In reality, the cost is for example the current load of the contractor and the amount of time to perform the task.
      <br/>
      The publicized inferring unit compares conditions of individual contractors and accepts the bid of an inferring unit that has tendered for the task with the optimum condition.
      <br/>
      For example, when several inferring units cooperatively schedule jobs, they can transfer jobs that they cannot assign them in their time tables as tasks to other inferring units.
    </p>
    <p num="10">For details of the contract net protocol, refer to "The Contract Net Protocol: High-Level Communication and Control in a Distributed Problem Solver", by R. G. Smith, IEEE Transactions on Computers, Vol. 29, No. 12, pp. 1104-1113, 1980.</p>
    <p num="11">
      Next, the integrated negotiation protocol will be described.
      <br/>
      In the integrated negotiation protocol, each inferring unit operates so that the effect (profit) of each inferring unit becomes maximum (namely, economical rationality), thereby obtaining inconsistent states of inferring units and an agreement of the possibility of cooperation thereof.
    </p>
    <p num="12">
      In the integrated negotiation protocol, individual inferring units make plans (compromise plans) corresponding to their circumstances.
      <br/>
      Thus, a joint plan of which each plan is combined is obtained.
      <br/>
      In addition, the cost of each plan of the joint plan is calculated.
      <br/>
      A set of compromise plans (a set of negotiations) of which the effect is maximum for each inferring unit is obtained.
    </p>
    <p num="13">
      In this case, an example of a compromise plan is an alternative of a schedule adjustment of a meeting (such as "day 3", "day 4", and "day 7").
      <br/>
      A set of negotiations is a set of compromise plans.
      <br/>
      Examples of set of negotiations are "days 3 and 4" and "days 4 and 7".
    </p>
    <p num="14">
      A compromise plan is designated "effect" as an evaluated value.
      <br/>
      When "day 3" is more convenient than "day 7", the relation of �effect of "day 3"�&gt;�effect of "day 7"� is satisfied.
    </p>
    <p num="15">
      With the set of negotiations, a conflicting state, a compromising state, and a cooperating state are defined.
      <br/>
      Each unit adopts the most profitable compromise plan as a plan.
      <br/>
      In other words, the "cooperating state" represents that there is of a compromise plan that both units can profitably accept.
      <br/>
      For example, a negotiation between a selling party and a buying party is effected at the initially presented price.
      <br/>
      The "compromising state" represents that there is a compromise plan that is not the best, but better than the current state.
      <br/>
      For example, in the case that the selling party slightly reduces the price of a sales item from the initially presented price, the effect is larger than the case that it is stocked.
      <br/>
      In this case, the action of which the selling party sells the sales item at a reduced price is a "compromise plan".
    </p>
    <p num="16">
      The "conflicting" state represents the case that there is no compromise plan and thereby a negotiation is not effected.
      <br/>
      In the case of the "conflicting state", a probability selecting means such as a dice or a lot is used to determine which of the parties is lost (mixed joint plan) and thereby rationally perform the negotiation.
      <br/>
      This is because when an agreement is not obtained, the problem is not solved and thereby the entire problem of the inference cannot be solved.
      <br/>
      Since the negotiation is probabilistically effected, one party is not continuously lost.
      <br/>
      Thus, a better result than the state that the negotiation is not effected is obtained.
      <br/>
      Consequently, negotiations in all the cooperating state, the compromising state, and the conflicting state can be performed.

    <p num="17">In such a precondition, a local inferring unit publicizes compromise plans in the order of higher effect and agrees with the negotiating unit when a compromise plan of the negotiating unit has higher effect than one of compromise plans of the local inferring unit.</p>
    <p num="18">For details of the integrated negotiation protocol, refer to "Cooperation and Conflict Resolution via Negotiation Among Autonomous Agents in Non-Cooperative Domain", by G. Zlotkin and J. S. Rosenschein, IEEE Transaction on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Vol. 21, No. 6, pp. 1317-1324, 1991.</p>
    <p num="19">
      In the above-described related art references, it is expected that various proposals made between units allow them to be consistent.
      <br/>
      In addition, each unit performs an inference with an unspoken agreement that the latest inferred state that has been obtained through negotiations is the best way.
    </p>
    <p num="20">
      However, since each unit does not know the inside of other units, if a negotiation has reached a deadlock with a particular compromise plan, the content of the existing negotiation as the precondition for inferring the compromise plan may be overruled.
      <br/>
      In this case, since each unit loses the basis of the inference, each unit should retry the inference.
      <br/>
      Thus, the inference cannot be effectively performed.
      <br/>
      Particularly, in the conventional inference, assuming that various selectable options in the inferring process are branches of a tree chart, depth priority searching is performed.
      <br/>
      However, whenever a branch close to the root is overruled, the inference should be retried.
    </p>
    <p num="21">
      In addition, when an inference is performed with a precondition of the latest negotiating state, the range of the solution becomes narrow and thereby the probability of which the precondition is overruled becomes high.
      <br/>
      Thus, with the content of a negotiation that just precedes the latest negotiation, a better solution may be obtained.
      <br/>
      However, it is difficult to assign a criterion that represents which content of the negotiation is proper.
      <br/>
      Moreover, when an inference is retried because the preceding inference has reached a deadlock, it is not clear to distinguish substantial proposals and processes from settled agreements.
      <br/>
      Thus, since it is not clear to backtrack for the inference, the process was troublesome.
    </p>
    <p num="22">
      Furthermore, in the conventional negotiation protocol, since information exchange necessary for a negotiating process is mixed with information exchange used for a real negotiation, when the negotiation protocol is applied to a real problem, it is difficult to install the conventional negotiation protocol to an inferring unit.
      <br/>
      In other words, when the conventional negotiation protocol is installed to an inferring unit, a procedural process with respect to a negotiation framework such as "'start/end of a negotiation and an identification of an item to be negotiated" and a substantial process such as practical conditions of quantity and amount of money for example "quantity is 20/amount of money is 1500 yen".

    <heading>DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
    <p num="52">Next, with reference to the accompanying drawings, embodiments of the present invention will be described.</p>
    <p num="53">(1) Structure of First Embodiment</p>
    <p num="54">(1-1) Outline of First Embodiment</p>
    <p num="55">The first embodiment of the present invention is a scheduling system that makes a production schedule.</p>
    <p num="56">
      The scheduling system is a system that assigns given jobs to resources corresponding to resource information that has been input.
      <br/>
      The resource information is information of various resources used for processing the jobs.
      <br/>
      For example, the resource information is data such as "there are two milling machines and one drilling machine" or "Two workers can be prepared".
      <br/>
      A job is data of a production step such as "first step for producing a product A: Abrade the surface. (amount of work: two hours)" or "second step for producing a product A: Make a hole with the drilling machine (amount of work: one hour)".
      <br/>
      The scheduling system considers idle states of resources and, determines what product to produce with what resource in what time, and finally assigns the resources to all jobs so as to solve a problem.
    </p>
    <p num="57">
      A collection of resources is referred to as a shop.
      <br/>
      A production schedule is not completed with each job.
      <br/>
      Thus, a plurality of shops should be used in a predetermined sequence depending on a job.
      <br/>
      In other words, each production schedule has various restrictions such as the order of shops or jobs.
      <br/>
      Thus, considering the deadline of a shop that is in charge of the preceding step, the current step should be scheduled.
      <br/>
      Among inferring units that are in charge of a plurality of shops, a schedule is made corresponding to the mutual relation thereof.
      <br/>
      In the above-described example, the "milling machine" and "drilling machine" are shops.
    </p>
    <p num="58">
      In the distributed cooperative scheduling system according to the first embodiment, a plurality of inferring units that make a production schedule of a single shop are used.
      <br/>
      By mutually connecting these inferring units, considering the mutual relations, a consistent production schedule is made.
    </p>
    <p num="59">(1-2) Overall Structure</p>
    <p num="60">
      FIG. 1 is a functional block diagram showing the overall structure of the scheduling system.
      <br/>
      Referring to FIG. 1, in the scheduling system, a plurality of inferring units A, B, and C that mutually negotiate with each other and solve a problem are mutually connected through a network N. Each of the inferring units A, B, and C has an input/output unit I. Examples of the input/output unit I are input units such as a keyboard and a mouse and an output unit such as a video display.
      <br/>
      However, the input/output unit I is not limited to such units.
      <br/>
      In other words, another unit can be used as long as it can input/output particular data.
      <br/>
      In the inferring units A, B, and C, when resource information and jobs are input as a problem from the input unit, a production schedule is inferred and made.
      <br/>
      The inferred schedule is supplied from the output unit.
    </p>
    <p num="61">In the embodiment, the inferring unit A, the inferring unit B, and the inferring unit C are in charge of production schedules of the shop of one lathe machine, the shop of one milling machine, and the shop of one balling machine, respectively.</p>
    <p num="62">(1-3) Inferring Units</p>
    <p num="63">FIG. 2 is a functional block diagram showing the structure of each of the inferring units A, B, and C. Referring to FIG. 2, in the embodiment, each inferring unit is mainly composed of an inferring means 1, a negotiating means 5, and a communicating means 8.</p>
    <p num="64">(1-3-1) Inferring Means</p>
    <p num="65">
      1t Each of the inferring units A, B, and C has the inferring means 1.
      <br/>
      The inferring means 1 infers a problem of each shop, the problem being input from the input/output unit I connected to each unit corresponding to inference knowledge that has been stored in an inference knowledge storing means 2 and then obtains a particular solution.
      <br/>
      The inference knowledge is a rule for the assignment of jobs to resources, an assumption generating rule for the change of restrictions of jobs and resources that are input, a rule for the depth of an inference in the case that selectable options are represented by a tree chart, and the priority in the case that there are a plurality of solutions that satisfy a problem.
    </p>
    <p num="66">
      The inferring means 1 comprises an inference driving portion (inference engine) 11, a negotiation requesting portion 12, and a proposal content evaluating portion 13.
      <br/>
      The inference driving portion 11 infers a problem that is received from the input/output unit I and another inferring unit corresponding to the inference knowledge.
      <br/>
      When the local inferring unit cannot solve the problem as the inferred result of the inference driving portion 11, the negotiation requesting portion 12 requests a negotiating means 5 (that will be described later) to negotiate with another inferring unit.
      <br/>
      When an inference is performed corresponding to the content of a proposal received from another unit through the negotiating means 5, the proposal content evaluating portion 13 determines whether or not a solution that satisfies the content of the proposal has been obtained and informs the negotiating means 5 of the determined result.
    </p>
    <p num="67">
      A solution obtained in the inferring process by the inferring means 1 (and a solution obtained as the inferred result) is supplied as an inferred state from the input/output unit I. In addition, the solution is stored in an inferred state storing means 3.
      <br/>
      The inferred state storing means 3 stores the following solutions as an inferred state.
    </p>
    <p num="68">
      (a) A solution of each inferring unit obtained by inferring a problem received from the input/output unit I. This solution is a solution before a negotiation is started.
      <br/>
      The solution is solved in the local inferring unit.
    </p>
    <p num="69">
      (b) A solution obtained in a negotiating process with another inferring unit.
      <br/>
      This solution is for example a solution inferred by the local unit corresponding to a proposal to another unit or a solution inferred corresponding to a proposal of another unit.
    </p>
    <p num="70">(c) A solution of a settled inferred state obtained as a result of a negotiation with another inferring unit.</p>
    <p num="71">
      A plurality of solutions may be obtained at a time.
      <br/>
      For example, in a negotiating process of a problem to each shop, a plurality of solutions that satisfy a problem and a negotiation condition may exist.
      <br/>
      In this case, a plurality of solutions are stored.
      <br/>
      At this point, the priority of the solutions is assigned corresponding to the above-described inference knowledge.
    </p>
    <p num="72">
      Each inferred state (solution) stored in the inferred state storing means 3 is managed by a state (context) managing means 4.
      <br/>
      The state managing means 4 manages the writing/reading operations of each inferred state to the inferred state storing means 3 corresponding to a command received from the inferring means 1 and the negotiating means 5 (that will be described later in detail).
      <br/>
      The state managing means 4 determines what inferred state the inferring means 1 uses in the inferring process and the negotiating process.
    </p>
    <p num="73">(1-3-2) Negotiating Means</p>
    <p num="74">Each of the inferring units A, B, and C has the above-mentioned negotiating means 5 that negotiates with other inferring units and obtains a solution that is consistent among each unit.</p>
    <p num="75">
      The negotiating means 5 is connected to a negotiation strategy storing means 6 that stores negotiation strategies for negotiations.
      <br/>
      Examples of negotiation strategies stored in the negotiation strategy storing means 6 are as follows.
      <br/>
      In the case of a lathe, "a job that has been assigned should not be unnecessarily moved".
      <br/>
      In the case of a milling machine, "a problem should be solved by the local unit as much as possible rather than requesting another unit".
      <br/>
      In the case of a drilling machine, "a request should be accepted as much as possible".
      <br/>
      The lathe, milling machine, and drilling machine may have a common strategy such as "a negotiation should be performed so that the other jobs are not adversely affected".
      <br/>
      The inferring means 1 uses the negotiation strategies along with the above-described inference knowledge to perform an inference when it creates a proposal or a reply to a proposal of another unit.
    </p>
    <p num="76">
      The negotiating means 5 performs a negotiation while exchanging data necessary to create a proposal and a reply with the inferring means 1.
      <br/>
      The negotiating means 5 comprises an object selecting means 51, a proposal creating means 52, and a reply managing means 53.
      <br/>

      The reply managing means 53 causes the inferring means 1 to evaluate a proposal received from another unit and infer whether the proposal is adequate.

      The reply managing means 53 receives a reply against a proposal from an inferring unit as the negotiating party.

      The negotiating means 5 further comprises an agreement requesting means 54, an agreement determining means 55, and a settlement processing means 56.

      The agreement requesting means 54 asks another unit to agree with a proposal corresponding to the content of a reply received by the reply managing means 53.

      FIG. 3 is a schematic diagram showing examples of jobs that are input.

      Referring to FIG. 3, in JOB 1, the resource to be used is a "lathe".
      <br/>
      The amount of work necessary for installing JOB 1 is "4".

    <p num="85">In the first embodiment, since the inferring unit A is in charge of a shop of a lathe, information of JOB 1 and JOB 3 is input to the inferring unit A. Likewise, information of JOB 2 and JOB 4 is input to the inferring unit B. Information of JOB 5 is input to the inferring unit C. The input information is stored as data files of hard disks of the inferring units A, B, and C.</p>
    <p num="86">Data of jobs may have been created as files of hard disks and/or floppy disks and they may be read by the input/output unit I of each of the inferring units A, B, and C.</p>
    <p num="87">(2-2) Scheduling in Each Unit</p>
    <p num="88">
      In each of the inferring units A, B, and C, the inference driving portion 11 of the inferring means 1 extracts jobs one after the other and performs an inference for assigning the jobs to relevant resources.
      <br/>
      For example, as shown in FIG. 4, in the inferring unit B, a resource is secured for JOB 2 in a time range from "5" to "10" with a length of "3".
      <br/>
      In FIG. 4, an alternative of a time period in which each job can be assigned is denoted by an arrow with a broken line.
      <br/>
      The alternative represents a time range between the latest end time of the preceding step of the current job and the earliest start time of the following step of the current job.
    </p>
    <p num="89">
      In FIG. 4, jobs to be assigned are not limited to JOB 2.
      <br/>
      Thus, a proper position for JOB 2 should be found for the remaining jobs.
      <br/>
      In this example, to allows JOB 2 to have a tolerance against the deadline, JOB 2 is assigned from the earliest position in the time range from "5" to "8" denoted by an arrow with a solid line.
      <br/>
      Likewise, JOB 4 is assigned in the time range from "2" to "3" denoted by an arrow with a solid line.
      <br/>
      Rules necessary for inferences such as an assignment from the earliest position have been stored in the inference knowledge storing means 2.
      <br/>
      The inferring means 1 performs an inference corresponding to such inference knowledge.
    </p>
    <p num="90">
      A solution obtained as an inferred result is stored in the inferred state storing means 3.
      <br/>
      In this case, depending on a condition applied to the inference knowledge, the number of solutions that satisfy a problem that has been input is not limited to one.
      <br/>
      When there are a plurality of solutions, they are stored in the inferred state storing means 3.
      <br/>
      In the case that knowledge "if there are a plurality of solutions, the priority thereof is assigned corresponding to a predetermined criterion" has been stored in the inference knowledge storing means 2, if there are a plurality of solutions, corresponding to the priority thereof, a proper solution can be obtained when an inferred result is used or a negotiation is performed.
      <br/>
      In addition to the above-described solution that is stored to the inferred state storing means 3, what solution has been stored to the inferred state storing means 3 is written to the state managing means 4.
    </p>
    <p num="91">(2-3) Determination of Necessity of Negotiation</p>
    <p num="92">
      When a problem that has been input cannot be solved by a single inferring unit as an inferred result, negotiations with other units A, B, and C are required.
      <br/>
      In the first embodiment, while the inferring units A, B, and C are being operated in parallel, when given jobs are successively assigned, a state as shown in FIG. 5 takes place.
      <br/>
      In FIG. 5, a time range in which each job is assigned is denoted by an arrow with a solid line.
      <br/>
      A tolerance up to the latest end time of each job is denoted by an arrow with a dotted line.
    </p>
    <p num="93">
      In other words, in the inferring units B and C, jobs that have been input are assigned as arrows with solid lines.
      <br/>
      However, in the inferring unit A, since JOB 1 has been assigned, JOB 3 with latest end time="2" cannot be assigned.
      <br/>
      In addition, since the latest end time of JOB 1 is "5", even if JOB 1 is moved to the latest time position, a resource for JOB 3 with amount of work="2" cannot be secured.
    </p>
    <p num="94">
      In this case, the inferring unit A negotiates with the inferring unit B or C for an alleviation of the deadlines of jobs thereof.
      <br/>
      In reality, when the inference driving portion 11 of the inferring unit A has inferred that it cannot obtain a solution of the input problem as an inferred result thereof, the negotiation requesting portion 12 of the inferring means 1 requests the negotiating means 5 to negotiate with another inferring unit.
      <br/>
      The negotiating means 5 evaluates with what proposal to the other unit the problem of the local inferring unit can be solved.
      <br/>
      In other words, the object selecting means 51 of the negotiating means 5 selects a job and an operation time as a negotiation object corresponding to the negotiation strategies stored in the negotiation strategy storing means 6 and informs the inferring means 1 of the selected job and operation time as a negotiation object.
      <br/>
      The inference driving portion 11 of the inferring means 1 performs an inference corresponding to the proposal creation data so as to evaluate whether or not the problem of the local unit can be solved when a particular assumption of other inferring unit is satisfied.
    </p>
    <p num="95">
      When no assumption that allows the problem of the local inferring unit to be solved is not obtained at all, there is not room for a negotiation.
      <br/>
      Thus, the inferring means 1 outputs the result to the input/output unit I. In contrast, when the problem can be solved with the assumption satisfied, the inferring means 1 informs the proposal creating means 52 in the negotiating means 5 of the content of the assumption.
      <br/>
      Thus, the proposal creating means 52 creates the content of a proposal corresponding to the content of the assumption received from the inferring means 1.
    </p>
    <p num="96">For example, as shown in FIG. 6, in the inferring unit A, to assign JOB 3 in the time range from "4" to "6" that follows JOB 1, it is necessary to satisfy an assumption of which JOB 4 that follows JOB 3 is assigned in the time range from "6" to "7", in the inferring unit B. In other words, to change the latest end time of JOB 3 to "6", it is necessary for the inferring unit A to negotiate with the inferring unit B in charge of JOB 4 that follows JOB 3 for the change of the earliest start time of JOB 4 to "6".</p>
    <p num="97">
      Since the number of assumptions that solve a problem is not limited to one, when there are a plurality of solutions that include the assumption inferred by the inference driving portion 11, these solutions are stored in the inferred state storing means 3.
      <br/>
      The state managing means 4 selects the solution with the highest priority as a negotiation object.
      <br/>
      An assumption that satisfies the solution becomes the first proposal of the negotiation.
      <br/>
      The selected solution (inferred state) is stored in the negotiating state storing means 7 in the negotiating stage.

    <p num="99">
      After the content of a proposal is created by the proposal creating means 52, the negotiating means 5 start a negotiation corresponding to the content of the proposal with another unit.
      <br/>
      In other words, as shown in FIG. 9, the message sending/receiving means 81 of the communicating means 8 sends a negotiation start message to the inferring unit B. When the inferring unit B acknowledges the reception of the negotiation start message, the negotiation is started.

    <p num="102">A negotiation phase is started when the data sending/receiving means 82 of the communicating means 8 sends the content of a proposal created by the proposal creating means 52 to the inferring unit B.</p>
    <p num="103">(2-5-2) Evaluation of Content of Proposal</p>
    <p num="104">
      When the data sending/receiving means 82 of the communicating means 8 in the inferring unit B receives the content of the proposal, the inferring unit B determines whether or not to accept the content of the proposal and sends a reply thereof to the inferring unit A. In other words, when the inferring unit B has received the proposal, as shown in FIG. 5, JOB 4 has been assigned in the time range from "2" to "3" and JOB 2 has been assigned in the time range from "5" to "8".
      <br/>
      To accept the proposal of which the earliest start time of JOB 4 is changed to "6", the latest end time of JOB 4 should be changed to "7".
      <br/>
      When the latest end time of JOB 4 can be changed to "7", since the latest end time of JOB 2 is "10", by moving the time range of JOB 2 to "7" to "10", the time range from "6" to "7" becomes blank.
      <br/>
      By assigning JOB 4 in the time range from "6" to "7", the proposal can be accepted.
    </p>
    <p num="105">
      In reality, a proposal received by the negotiating means 5 in the inferring unit B is sent to the proposal content evaluating portion 13 of the inferring means 1 along with the negotiation strategies stored in the negotiation strategy storing means 6.
      <br/>
      The proposal content evaluating portion 13 performs an inference with a precondition of the inferred state of the local inferring unit that has been stored and the content of the proposal received from the inferring unit A and evaluates whether there is a solution that satisfies the content of the proposal.
    </p>
    <p num="106">(2-5-3) Reply of Acceptance</p>
    <p num="107">
      When a solution that satisfies the content of a proposal has been inferred as an evaluated result, the proposal content evaluating portion 13 informs the reply managing means 53 in the negotiating means 5 of the result.

      The reply managing means 53 creates a reply message and sends the reply message to the inferring unit A through the message sending/receiving means 81 of the communicating means 8.

    <p num="108">(2-5-4) Negotiation to Another Unit</p>
    <p num="109">
      A solution may not be obtained by the inferring unit B as an inferred result of the proposal content evaluating portion 13 corresponding to the content of the proposal.
      <br/>
      In this case, while the reply to the inferring unit A is being stored in the negotiating state storing means 7, the inferring unit B negotiates with another inferring unit.
      <br/>
      In other words, as shown in FIG. 5, in the inferring unit B, to change the latest end time of JOB 4 to "7", the earliest start time of JOB 5 that follows JOB 4 should be changed to "7".
      <br/>
      Thus, the inferring unit B negotiates with the inferring unit C that is in charge of JOB 5 for such a change.
    </p>
    <p num="110">
      As with the case that the inferring unit B receives a proposal from the inferring unit A, the inferring unit C with which the inferring unit B has negotiated performs an inference with a precondition of the proposal of the inferring unit B, evaluates whether or not there is a solution that satisfies the proposal, and sends a reply to the inferring unit B. In the example shown in FIG. 5, even if the earliest start time of JOB 5 is changed to "5", JOB 5 can be assigned, the inferring unit C accepts the proposal.
      <br/>
      Thus, the inferring unit B can assign JOB 4 in the time range from "6" to "7".
      <br/>
      Consequently, the inferring unit B can accept the proposal received from the inferring unit A.

    <p num="111">
      A party with which the inferring unit B negotiates while a reply of a proposal received from the inferring unit A is deferred is not always a third party.

      In other words, a proposal as an exchange condition can be sent from the inferring unit B to the inferring unit A that is a proposer.

      In this case, the inferring unit A that has received a proposal as an exchange condition evaluates the content of the proposal and sends a reply to the inferring unit B.

      In this case, the inferred state that has been rejected by the inferring unit B and stored in the negotiating state storing means 7 is discarded.
      <br/>
      Instead, an inferred state that has been newly selected by the state managing means 4 is stored as an inferred state in a negotiating process to the negotiating state storing means 7.
      <br/>
      Likewise, when all proposals have been rejected as negotiation results of all alternatives stored in the inferred state storing means 3, since the problem cannot be solved in the local inferring unit and by a negotiation with other inferring units, the inferring unit A sends a negotiation completion message and terminates the negotiation with the other inferring units.

      <br/>
      In the agreement phase, it is confirmed that an assumption proposed by an inferring unit as a proposer in the last negotiation stage becomes a precondition of the subsequent inference performed by each inferring unit.
    </p>
    <p num="120">
      In other words, from a view point of an inferring unit that has sent a reply that represents the acceptance of a proposal, the inferring unit cannot know whether or not the inferring unit as the proposer has used the accepted proposal.

      For example, it is assumed that the inferring unit A sends proposals to both the inferring units B and C and that only when both the proposals have been accepted, the inferring unit A uses an assumption of the proposals.
      <br/>
      Even if the inferring unit B has accepted the relevant proposal, when the inferring unit C has rejected the relevant proposal, the inferring unit A does not use the assumption.

      Likewise, after the inferring unit B has sent a reply that represents the acceptance of a proposal to the inferring unit A, when the inferring unit A receives another proposal from another inferring unit and send a reply that represents the acceptance of the proposal, the inferring unit may not accept the relevant proposal.
      <br/>
      In this case, since the inferring unit A considers that a received reply is a proposal in the final stage and the proposal is used as a precondition of the subsequent inference, the inferring unit A may incorrectly perform the subsequent inference.

      In the negotiation phase, it is not necessary to include "start" and "end" as independent messages.
      <br/>
      In other words, messages for proposals and agreements function as messages of "start" and "end".

    <p num="141">(3) Explanation of Flow Chart</p>

      FIGS. 7 and 8 are flow charts showing the operation of the embodiment.
      <br/>
      FIG. 7 is a flow chart of processes for negotiations and agreements viewed from the requesting side (on the inferring unit A side).
      <br/>
      FIG. 8 is a flow chart of processes for negotiations and agreements viewed from the requested side (on the inferring unit B side).

      FIG. 9 is a schematic diagram showing a part of information exchanged between the units A and B.

    <p num="143">(3-1) Start of Negotiation</p>
    <p num="144">While the inferring unit A is performing an inference for solving a problem (at step 41), if the inferring unit A requires to negotiate with another unit for solving the problem (at step 42), the inferring unit A creates the content of a proposal (at step 44) and sends the proposal to the inferring unit B as the negotiating party (at step 45).</p>
    <p num="145">(3-2) Reception of Proposal and Reply thereof</p>
    <p num="146">
      When the inferring unit B receives a proposal from the inferring unit A (at step 61 in FIG. 8), the inferring unit B progressively infers the content (at step 62) and determines whether or not to accept the content of the proposal (at step 63).
      <br/>
      When the inferring unit B cannot satisfy the content of the proposal received from the inferring unit A and thereby needs to negotiate with another unit, the inferring unit B negotiates with the other unit (at step 64).
      <br/>
      As a result of the negotiation with the other unit or when the inferring unit B can accept the proposal received from the inferring unit A (at step 65), the inferring unit B sends a reply that represents the acceptance of the reply to the inferring unit A (at step 66).
    </p>
    <p num="147">
      When the inferring unit B has inferred a alternative plan instead of the proposal received from the inferring unit A (at step 67) and thereby has obtained an alternative plan (at step 68), the inferring unit B sends the alternative plan to the inferring unit A (at step 70).
      <br/>
      In other words, when it is necessary for the inferring unit A to accept the alternative plan received from the inferring unit B so as to allow the inferring unit B to accept the proposal received from the inferring unit A, the inferring unit B sends the alternative plan to the inferring unit A, waits for a reply that represents whether or not the inferring unit A accepts the alternative plan, and sends a reply that represents whether or not to accept the proposal received from the inferring unit A. When the inferring unit A has received the alternative plan, it evaluates the alternative plan, and sends a reply that represents whether or not to accept the alternative plan to the inferring unit B corresponding to the flow chart (at step 61 and later) shown in FIG. 8.
      <br/>
      The evaluation of whether or not the inferring unit accepts the alternative plan is performed in the same manner as the case that the inferring unit B that has received the proposal cannot solve the problem and negotiates with another inferring unit for the problem.
      <br/>
      When the inferring unit A has accepted the alternative plan (at step 71), it sends a reply that represents the acceptance of the proposal to the inferring unit A (at step 66).
    </p>
    <p num="148">When the inferring unit B cannot accept the proposal received from the inferring unit A, the other inferring unit has refused the proposal at step 64, and there is no alternative plan, the inferring unit B sends a reply that represents the rejection of the proposal to the inferring unit A (at step 72).</p>
    <p num="149">(3-3) Reception of Reply</p>
    <p num="150">
      The inferring unit A that has sent the proposal receives a reply from the inferring unit B (at step 47 in FIG. 7).
      <br/>
      When the reply represents the rejection of the proposal (at step 48), the flow returns to step 44.
      <br/>
      At step 44, the inferring unit A sends a new proposal to the inferring unit B. When the reply represents the acceptance of the proposal, the agreement phase takes place (see FIG. 9).
    </p>
    <p num="151">(3-4) Agreement</p>
    <p num="152">(3-4-1) Request for Agreement</p>
    <p num="153">
      In the agreement phase, the inferring unit A, B, and C agree that the inferred state that is consistent in the inferring units A, B, and C is treated as a settled inferred state for a precondition of the subsequent inference.
      <br/>
      In other words, the inferring unit A that has received a reply that represents the acceptance of the proposal (at step 48) requests the inferring unit B whether or not to accept the inferred state corresponding to the content of the proposal as a settled inferred state (at step 49).
    </p>
    <p num="154">(3-4-2) Evaluation for Acceptance</p>
    <p num="155">
      The inferring unit B that has received an acceptance request at step 74 in FIG. 8 evaluates whether or not to accept the acceptance request (at step 75).
      <br/>
      When the inferring unit B can accept the acceptance request, it sends a reply to the inferring unit A (at step 76).
      <br/>
      In addition, the inferring unit B stores the inferred state corresponding to the proposal received from the inferring unit A as the settled inferred state (at step 77).
      <br/>
      Thereafter, in the inferring unit B, the settled inferred state becomes a basis of the subsequent inference.
      <br/>
      As described above, the settling process may be performed after the inferring unit B sends a reply that represents the acceptance of the agreement request and waits for the settling process message from the inferring unit A.
    </p>
    <p num="156">
      When the inferring unit B cannot accept the acceptance request (at step 78), it sends a reply that represents the rejection of the acceptance request to the inferring unit A (at step 79).
      <br/>
      In other words, after the inferring unit B has sent a reply that represents the acceptance of the proposal to the inferring unit A, if an inferred state that is different from the proposal received from the inferring unit A takes place in the inferring unit B (for example, the inferring unit B sends a different proposal to another inferring unit or receives another proposal from another inferring unit), since the inferred state corresponding to the proposal received from the inferring unit A is not consistent with the later inferred state, the inferring unit B cannot accept the proposal.
      <br/>
      Thus, the inferring unit B sends a reply to the inferring unit A.
    </p>
    <p num="157">(3-4-3) Settling Process</p>
    <p num="158">
      When the inferring unit A has received a reply of the agreement request from the inferring unit B (at step 50), the inferring unit A performs a different process depending on the content of the reply (at step 54).
      <br/>
      If the reply represents the acceptance of the agreement request, the inferring unit A performs a process for changing the inferred state of the proposal sent to the inferring unit B to a settled inferred state (at step 52).
      <br/>
      In contrast, if the reply to the agreement request is a rejection of the agreement, the inferring unit A discards the inferred state of the content of the proposal and restores the inferred state that has been stored (or a settled inferred state that has been obtained through a negotiation) (at step 53) and evaluates another proposal (at step 45).
    </p>
    <p num="159">(3) Completion of Negotiation</p>
    <p num="160">
      When a settled inferred state is obtained, the end message is exchanged among the inferring units.
      <br/>
      In addition, a settled inferred state that had been stored before the negotiation has been performed is discarded.
      <br/>
      Thus, the negotiation is completed (completion phase).
      <br/>
      When the negotiation has not been effected, a settled inferred state that has been stored is restored and the inferred state is canceled.
      <br/>
      When the inferring unit A cannot receive a reply that represents the acceptance of a proposal from anther inferring unit, the end message is exchanged without entering the agreement phase.
      <br/>
      Thus, the negotiation is completed.
    </p>
    <p num="161">(4) Effect of First Embodiment</p>
    <p num="162">
      In the first embodiment, since a settled inferred state is explicitly agreed among the inferring units A, B, and C, a basis of an inference can be obtained.
      <br/>
      Thus, an inference can be effectively performed.
      <br/>
      Particularly, before a negotiation is performed, production schedules of the inferring unit A are consistent with a production schedule of the inferring unit B. When the inferring unit A negotiates with another inferring unit, because of the occurrence of an assumption "if the latest end time of JOB 4 can be changed to "7"", it is unclear whether or not the assumption is valid as a basis of the subsequent inference.
      <br/>
      In contrast, according to the first embodiment, the state of which the inferring units A, B, and C are consistent is agreed as a settled inferred state.
      <br/>
      In the subsequent negotiation, an inference is performed on the basis of the latest settled inferred state.
      <br/>
      Thus, the basis of the inference is clear.
    </p>
    <p num="163">
      In addition, according to the first embodiment, when an inconsistent state takes place as a result of an inferred result and an agreement cannot be successfully made, a stored inferred state can be used.
      <br/>
      Thus, the updating of the inferred state can be canceled and the consistent state can be easily restored.
      <br/>
      Moreover, according to the first embodiment, in the initial inferred state, the settled inferred state is blank.
      <br/>
      However, when the settled inferred state takes place because of an agreement, the subsequent inference is performed on the basis of the settled inferred state.
      <br/>
      Since the agreements are successively accumulated, a complicated problem can be effectively inferred through negotiations.
    </p>
    <p num="164">As described above, according to the cooperative inferring apparatus of the first embodiment, while a restriction that cannot be solved by a single inferring unit is changed through negotiations, a consistent production schedule can be created.</p>
    <p num="165">(5) Second Embodiment</p>
    <p num="166">(5-1) Necessity of Multiple-Negotiations</p>
    <p num="167">
      According to the first embodiment, when a plurality of solutions based on different assumptions are obtained, negotiations are performed for the solutions in the order of the priority.
      <br/>
      In other words, when a negotiation for one solution has not been effected, a proposal based on the next solution is sent to another unit.
      <br/>
      However, such negotiations take a long time.
      <br/>
      A solution with higher priority is not always a solution that is accepted through a negotiation.
      <br/>
      In addition, such a solution is not always a solution that is advantageous for other inferring units and the entire cooperative inferring apparatus.
    </p>
    <p num="168">To solve such a problem, according to the second embodiment of the present invention, when a plurality of proposals corresponding to a plurality of solutions (inferred states) based on different assumptions are obtained, negotiations are performed for these solutions with the other inferring units relating to the proposals.</p>
    <p num="169">(5-2) Structure of Second Embodiment</p>
    <p num="170">
      The structure of the second embodiment is basically the same as the structure of the first embodiment.
      <br/>
      However, an inferring means 1, a negotiating means 5, and a communicating means 8 are structured so that a plurality of negotiations can be performed in parallel.
      <br/>
      In addition, a state managing means 4 and a negotiating state storing means 7 are structured so that a plurality of negotiating states can be managed and stored at the same time.
    </p>
    <p num="171">(5-3) Operation of Second Embodiment</p>
    <p num="172">In the second embodiment having the above-described structure, an example of which a plurality of negotiations are performed at the same time will be described.</p>
    <p num="173">
      In the state shown in FIG. 5, as an inferred result of the inferring means 1, in addition to a solution of which the latest end time of JOB 3 is changed, there is another solution of which the latest end time of JOB 1 is changed to "6".
      <br/>
      In the first embodiment, the state managing means 4 selected one of two solutions.
      <br/>
      However, there is another strategy of which negotiations are performed for two solutions at the same time and then a solution that can be agreed is used.
    </p>
    <p num="174">
      Thus, in the second embodiment, the inferring unit A negotiates with another unit for two solutions at the same time.
      <br/>
      In this case, the state managing means 4 extract two inferred states as negotiation objects and stores them in the negotiating state storing means 7.
      <br/>
      As the first selectable option, the inferring unit A negotiates with the inferring unit B for the change of the latest end time of JOB 3 to "6".
      <br/>
      This negotiation is the same as the negotiation in the first embodiment.
      <br/>
      As the second selectable option, the inferring unit A negotiates with the inferring unit B for the change of the latest end time of JOB 1 to "6".
      <br/>
      In this negotiation, even if the inferring unit B changes the earliest start time of JOB 2 that follows JOB 1 to "6", when the time range of the milling machine is secured from "6" to "9", the inferring unit B can perform the jobs.
      <br/>
      Thus, the inferring unit B can accept the proposal.
      <br/>
      FIG. 10 shows the last negotiating state.
    </p>
    <p num="175">
      In this case, the inferring unit A selects the second selectable option of which the result has been obtained earlier than the result of the first selectable option.
      <br/>
      Thus, the inferring unit A cancels the first negotiation, accepts the second negotiation, and secures a settled inferred state.
      <br/>
      The cancellation of the negotiation and the agreement thereof are performed by exchanging messages between inferring units as with the first embodiment.
      <br/>
      In other words, in the case that the negotiating means 5 of the second embodiment perform a plurality of negotiations with other units in parallel, when the negotiating means 5 obtains a first reply that represents the acceptance of a proposal, the negotiating means 5 sends an agreement message to the inferring unit that has sent the reply.
      <br/>
      In addition, the negotiating means 5 sends a negotiation end message to the other unit.
    </p>
    <p num="176">(5-4) Effect of Second Embodiment</p>
    <p num="177">
      According to the second embodiment, two negotiations can be performed at the same time.
      <br/>
      An inferred state of which a negotiation has been effected at first can be used as a solution of the problem.
      <br/>
      Thus, the efficiency of the inference can be much more improved than that of the first embodiment.
      <br/>
      In addition, in negotiations, proposals and replies that have not been accepted are discarded as they are not agreed by other inferring units.
      <br/>
      The subsequent inference can be performed on the basis of the original settled inferred state.
      <br/>
      Even if negotiations are not effected, the consistence among the inferring units is not lost.
      <br/>
      In the example shown in FIG. 10, even if a negotiation is not effected, since the inferred state shown in FIG. 5 is agreed among all the inferring units A, B, and C as a settled inferred state.
      <br/>
      Thus, since an inferring unit of which a negotiation is not effected can be restored to the settled inferred state, the consistency can be assured.
    </p>
    <p num="178">(6) Third Embodiment</p>
    <p num="179">
      The first embodiment is very effective to perform negotiations.
      <br/>
      However, when protocol messages such as a negotiation start message and an agreement start message are mixed with real negotiation messages such as an earliest start time change request, they are difficult to install or reuse in another system.
      <br/>
      To solve such a problem, according to a third embodiment of the present invention, each element of negotiations is hierarchically structured.
    </p>
    <p num="180">
      It should be noted that modules of the third embodiment do not just correspond to the individual means of the first embodiment.
      <br/>
      In other words, each means is structured with a plurality of modules and these modules are hierarchically categorized corresponding to functions of inferences and negotiations.
    </p>
    <p num="181">(6-1) Structure of Third Embodiment</p>
    <p num="182">
      FIG. 11 is a functional block diagram showing the structure of the third embodiment.
      <br/>
      Referring to FIG. 3, functions of inferring units A, B, and C that a cooperative inferring apparatus has are structured with three layers that are a framework layer W (lower layer), a methodology layer H (intermediate layer), and a strategy layer S (upper layer).
      <br/>
      The framework layer W defines a process in common with each unit.
      <br/>
      The methodology layer H defines a process for each problem of the cooperative inferring apparatus.
      <br/>
      The strategy layer S defines processes of individual inferring units A, B, and C.
    </p>
    <p num="183">
      The strategy layer S uses the function of the methodology layer H. The methodology layer H uses the function of the framework layer W. Thus, negotiations and agreements are performed.
      <br/>
      In the third embodiment, since the negotiating process is hierarchically structured, when the upper layer is structured, it is not necessary to consider the content of the process of the lower layer.
      <br/>
      Thus, the cooperative inferring unit and the cooperative inferring method can be easily structured.
      <br/>
      In addition, inferences can be easily reused and modified.
    </p>
    <p num="184">
      The framework layer W defines the order of the format of negotiations.
      <br/>
      The framework layer W corresponds to the function for obtaining a settled inferred state through negotiations and agreements in the cooperative inferring apparatus according to the present invention.
      <br/>
      The framework layer W is common in all the inferring units A, B, and C that negotiate with each other.
      <br/>
      When a new inferring unit is provided, the framework layer W can be used.
      <br/>
      In this embodiment, an agreeing means that settles an inferred state is structured as the framework layer W in the lower layer.
      <br/>
      The upper methodology layer H and the strategy layer S can be used to easily settle the inferred state through the framework layer W. Thus, the methodology layer H and the strategy layer S can be easily structured.
      <br/>
      In reality, the framework layer W has a message communicating module (start/end module) W1, a data sending/receiving module W2, and an agreement request processing module W3, and a settlement processing module W4.
      <br/>
      The message communicating module W1 creates and interprets negotiation start/end messages.
      <br/>
      The data sending/receiving module W2 creates and interprets messages that represent proposals and replies in the negotiation phase.
      <br/>
      The agreement request processing module W3 creates and interprets an agreement request message.
      <br/>
      The settlement processing module W4 obtains a settled inferred state when the other inferring units A, B, and C agree with a consistent inferred state.
    </p>
    <p num="185">
      The methodology layer H defines a process depending on a problem to be applied.
      <br/>
      The methodology layer H is common in inferring units that solve the same problem.
      <br/>
      For example, in this embodiment, "to designate a proper operation time for each unit", it is necessary "to advance or delay the operation time of a job".
      <br/>
      The methodology layer H has an object selecting module H1 and a proposal creating module H2.
      <br/>
      The object selecting module H1 designates the operation time (earliest start time or latest end time) of a job as a negotiation object.
      <br/>
      The proposal creating module H2 designates a valid operation time of the local unit to be moved.
      <br/>
      As a function of the methodology layer H, there is a reply creating module H3.
      <br/>
      When the local unit receives a request message, the reply creating module H3 receives a determination whether or not the content of the proposal can be agreed from the strategy layer S and sends a reply that represents the acceptance or rejection of the proposal.
      <br/>
      In addition, as another module of the methodology layer H, there is an encrypting module H4 that encrypts a confidential message such as amount of money.
    </p>
    <p num="186">
      The strategy layer S defines negotiation strategies of the individual inferring units A, B, and C. Examples of the negotiations are as follows.
      <br/>
      Examples of negotiation strategies stored in the negotiation strategy storing means 6 are as follows.
      <br/>
      In the case of a lathe, "a job that has been assigned should not be unnecessarily moved".
      <br/>
      In the case of a milling machine, "a problem should be solved by the local unit as much as possible rather than requesting another unit".
      <br/>
      In the case of a drilling machine, "a request should be accepted as much as possible".
      <br/>
      The lathe, milling machine, and drilling machine may have a common strategy such as "a negotiation should be performed so that the other jobs are not adversely affected".
      <br/>
      In the first embodiment, when the inferring unit A cannot assign a job, it immediately asks another unit for cooperation.
      <br/>
      However, even if a problem cannot be solved, when it is left for a while, the problem may be solved through negotiations from other inferring units.
      <br/>
      When the local unit cannot solve a problem, it asks another unit for cooperation or leaves it for a while depending on negotiation strategies of the local inferring unit.
      <br/>
      These negotiation strategies are installed in the strategy layer S. The strategy layer S has a problem solving module S1 that solves a problem corresponding to individual strategies.
    </p>
    <p num="187">(6-2) Operation of Third Embodiment</p>
    <p num="188">In the third embodiment that has the above-described structure, the strategy layer S uses the function of the methodology layer H. The methodology layer H uses the function of the framework function W. For example, the strategy layer S commands the methodology layer H for an action (how to move a particular object) and data (what amount to move) for solving a problem.</p>
    <p num="189">
      Next, an example of an inference according to the third embodiment will be described.
      <br/>
      In this example, it is assumed that jobs shown in FIG. 12 have been assigned.
      <br/>
      The inferring unit B that is in charge of a milling machine assigns JOB 3, JOB 4, and JOB 5 in the order (see FIG. 13).
      <br/>
      At this point, the inferring unit B assigns JOB 3 in the time range from "2" to "5"; JOB 5 in the time range from "5" to "7"; and JOB 5 in the time range from "7" to "10".
      <br/>
      The inferring unit C that is in charge of a drilling machine assigns JOB 6 in the time range from "10" to "12".
    </p>
    <p num="190">
      The inferring unit A that is in charge of a lathe assigns JOB 1 in the time range from "0" to "4".
      <br/>
      However, the inferring unit A cannot assign JOB 2 because the latest end time "5" of JOB 2 cannot be satisfied.
      <br/>
      Thus, the strategy layer S of the inferring unit A infers a solution of the problem.
    </p>
    <p num="191">
      The strategy layer S can find two solutions.
      <br/>
      As the first solution, the latest end time of JOB 2 is delayed.
      <br/>
      As the second solution, JOB 1 is restored in the non-assigned state.
      <br/>
      After JOB 2 is assigned, JOB 1 is reassigned at the latest end time that is later than that of the original latest end time.
      <br/>
      The strategy layer S selects one from the two solutions.
      <br/>
      In reality, since the inferring unit A that is in charge of the lathe has a strategy of which "a job that has been assigned should not be unnecessarily moved", the strategy layer S selects the first solution.
      <br/>
      In addition, the strategy layer S selects "1" as a tolerance for "a negotiation should be performed so that the other jobs are not adversely affected".
      <br/>
      The selected solution is sent in a predetermined format such as "latest end time of JOB 2+1" to the methodology layer H.
    </p>
    <p num="192">
      When the methodology layer H receives the selected solution, it selects "latest end time of JOB 2=earliest start time of JOB 4=(present) 5" as a negotiation object.
      <br/>
      In addition, the methodology layer H selects "6" as data of the content of the request in the negotiation.
      <br/>
      Moreover, the methodology layer H selects the inferring unit B that in charge of the milling machine corresponding to JOB 4 as a negotiating party.
      <br/>
      These selected data is sent to the framework layer W as the lower layer.
    </p>
    <p num="193">When the message communicating module (start/end module) W1 and the data sending/receiving module W2 of the framework layer W in the inferring unit A sends a negotiation start message and a proposal content message to the inferring unit B that is in charge of the milling machine, the request content message is sent from the framework layer W to the methodology layer H in the inferring unit B that has received these messages.</p>
    <p num="194">
      In the methodology layer H, the reply creating module H3 analyzes the received request message and knows that the negotiation object is "earliest start time of JOB 4" and data as the content of the request is "6".
      <br/>
      Next, the methodology layer H determines whether or not the content of the proposal is valid.
      <br/>
      In reality, to cause the earliest start time of JOB 4 to become "6", the reply creating module H3 determines that JOB 5 should be moved and sends the determined result to the strategy layer S. The strategy layer S determines that JOB 5 and JOB 4 should be moved to the time range from "5" to "8" and the time range from "8" to "10" corresponding to the strategy "a problem should be solved by the local unit as much as possible rather than requesting another unit".
      <br/>
      Thus, the inferring unit B accepts the proposal received from the inferring unit A.
    </p>
    <p num="195">When the reply creating module H3 of the methodology layer H receives the determined result, the framework layer W sends a reply that represents OK to the inferring unit A. When the inferring unit A that is in charge of the lathe has received the reply that represents OK from the inferring unit B, the inferring unit A knows that the negotiation has been successfully effected, the framework layer W thereof agrees with the negotiation, generates a newly settled inferred state, and completes the negotiation.</p>

      It should be noted that the present invention is not limited to the above-described embodiments.

      In other words, the present invention has other embodiments that follow.

    <p num="199">
      For example, the present invention is not limited to the scheduling system.

      Instead, the present invention can be applied to an inferring system for solving another type of problems.

    <p num="200">
      Each inferring unit is not limited to an independent hardware unit.
      <br/>
      For example, each inferring unit can be accomplished as a process of each computer connected through a network.
    </p>
    <p num="201">
      In addition, each inferring unit can be accomplished by a dedicated hardware unit or a dedicated software application accomplished on hardware.
      <br/>
      Particularly, in the first embodiment, to distinguish the inferring means from the negotiating means, the negotiating means manages the sending/receiving of messages and data and the inferring means performs inferences.
      <br/>
      However, it is not necessary to structure the inferring means and negotiating means in such a manner.
      <br/>
      For example, when the negotiating means has a dedicated inferring means, the inferring means performs inferences corresponding to commands received from the input/output unit.
      <br/>
      The dedicated inferring means in the negotiating means creates and evaluates proposals necessary in the negotiation stage and performs inferences necessary therefor.
    </p>
    <p num="202">
      It is not necessary to cause negotiations and agreements to be explicit in the formats of a start phase, a negotiation phase, an agreement phase, and an end phase.
      <br/>
      The start phase and end phase may be omitted.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, the start phase and the end phase can be substituted with messages of a negotiation and an agreement.
      <br/>
      An agreement may be confirmed by exchanging a message.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, an agreement may be confirmed by writing agreed data in a memory or a file shared by units.

    <p num="203">
      In the third embodiment, it is not necessary to structure three layers that are the framework layer, the methodology layer, and the strategy layer.
      <br/>
      Instead, two layers or four layers that are convenient may be used.

      The cooperative inferring apparatus and the cooperative inferring method according to the present invention are mainly accomplished by a computer program.

      Thus, a record medium that records such a program is also an embodiment of the present invention.
    </p>
    <p num="205">
      As described above, according to the first to third embodiments, each inferring unit can perform an inference corresponding to a settled inferred state agreed among each inferring unit through negotiations.

      According to the fourth embodiment, each problem solving means has a negotiation strategy group with two standpoints.

      The first standpoint is the priority of the individual problem solving means.

    </p>
    <p num="253">
      Next, with a real example, the above-described process will be described.

      In other words, in the schedule tables shown in FIG. 18, although the problem solving means 151a and 151c have assigned all the given jobs, the problem solving means 151b cannot assign the product A and the product B at the same time.

      First of all, the problem solving means 151b sends an operation time change request to the problem solving means 151a.
      <br/>
      In reality, the strategy selecting portion 166 of the problem solving means 151b obtains negotiation strategies of which "role"=equal and "transaction"=tolerance from the strategy database 165 in the initial state and sends the obtained negotiation strategies to the inferring portion 162.
      <br/>
      Thus, the inferring portion 162 creates an operation change request that causes the job of the product B to be assigned to the time range from "7" to "10", the earliest start time of the job of the product A to be changed to "4", the tolerance of "1" to be added to the earliest start time of the job of the product A so that the earliest start time of the job of the product becomes "3".
      <br/>
      Thereafter, the inferring portion 162 sends the created operation time change request to the problem solving means 151a through the communicating portion 161 (at step Rl shown in FIG. 21).

    <p num="255">
      The strategy selecting portion 166 of the problem solving means 151a obtains negotiation strategies of which "role"=equal and "transaction"=tolerance from the strategy database 165 in the initial state and sends the obtained negotiation strategies to the inferring unit 162.
      <br/>
      The inferring unit 162 infers whether or not the latest end time of the job of the product A can be assigned to "3".
      <br/>
      The problem solving means 151a determines that the latest end time of the job of the product A can be changed to "3" because the job of the product A has been assigned to the time range from "0" to "3".
      <br/>
      However, when the latest end time of the job of the product A is assigned to "3", the amount of work for "3" is assigned to the time range from the earliest start time "0" to the latest end time "3".
      <br/>
      Thus, there is no tolerance.
      <br/>
      Consequently, the problem solving means 151a sends a reply that represents the rejection against the request to the problem solving means 151b through the communicating portion 161 (see FIG. 20A and step A1 in FIG. 21).

    <p num="256">
      Next, the problem solving means 151b sends an operation time change request to the problem solving means 151c.

      The problem solving means 151c assigns the job (amount of work ="2") of the product B to the time range from "12" to "15" with a tolerance.

      Thus, since the problem solving means 151c accepts the request, the negotiation between the problem solving means 151b and the problem solving means 151c is effected (see FIG. 20B and step A2 in FIG. 21).
      <br/>
      Consequently, the jobs of the products A and B have been completely assigned (see FIG. 20C).

      However, depending on a given scheduling problem, even with negotiation strategies of which "role"=equal and "transaction"=tolerance, a negotiation may not be well effected.

      In this case, it is necessary to change the existing negotiation strategies to more proper negotiation strategies.

      Next, the case that the problem solving means 151a, 151b, and 151c that are in charge of a lathe, a milling machine, and a drilling machine solve production schedules of a product C and a product D will be described.

      In this example, it is assumed that scheduling information has been input to the ;problem solving means 151a, 151b, and 151c.

    <p num="260">The problem solving means 151a, 151b, and 151c secure required amounts of time (amounts of work) in the individual schedule tables corresponding to the scheduling information of the products C and D.</p>
    <p num="261">
      FIG. 22 is a schematic diagram showing an example of schedule tables on which the inferring portions 162 of the program solving means 151a, 151b, and 151c have assigned given jobs.
      <br/>
      In FIG. 22, although the problem solving means 151b and the problem solving means 151c have assigned all the given jobs, the problem solving means 151a has not assigned the jobs of the products C and D. Thus, the problem solving means 151a negotiates with another problem solving means so as to assign these jobs.
    </p>
    <p num="262">
      FIGS. 23A, 23E, and 24 are schematic diagrams for explaining a negotiating process performed among each problem solving means.
      <br/>
      The problem solving means 151a sends an operation time change request to the problem solving means 151b (at step R1 in FIG. 24).
      <br/>
      In other words, the strategy selecting portion 166 of the problem solving means 151a obtains negotiation strategies of which "role"=equal and "transaction"=tolerance from the strategy database 165 in the initial state and sends the obtained negotiation strategies to the inferring portion 162.
      <br/>
      Thus, the inferring portion 162 creates an operation time change request that causes the job of the product C to be assigned to the time range from "0" to "3", the latest end time of the job of the product D to be changed to "9", and a tolerance of 1 to be added thereto so as to assign the latest end time of the job of the product D to "10".
      <br/>
      Thereafter, the inferring unit 162 sends the created operation time change request to the problem solving means 151b through the communicating portion 161.
    </p>
    <p num="263">
      The problem solving means 151b obtains negotiation strategies of which "role"=equal and "transaction"=tolerance from the strategy database 165 in the initial state and sends the obtained negotiation strategies to the inferring portion 162.
      <br/>
      The inferring portion 162 determines whether or not the earliest start time of the job of the product D can be assigned to "10" with a tolerance.
      <br/>
      Since the latest end time of the job of the product D has been assigned to "10", the problem solving means 151b determines that the earliest start time of the job of the product D cannot be assigned to "10".
      <br/>
      Thus, the problem solving means 151b sends a reply that represents the rejection against the request to the problem solving means 151a through the communicating portion 161 (see FIG. 23A and step A1 in FIG. 24).
    </p>
    <p num="264">
      Next, the problem solving means 151a sends an operation time change request to the problem solving means 151b (at step R2 in FIG. 24).
      <br/>
      In other words, with the same negotiation strategies, the problem solving means 151a sends an operation time change request that causes the job of the product D to be assigned to the time range from "0" to "6", the latest end time of the job of the product C to be changed to "9", and a tolerance of "1" to be added thereto so as to assign the latest end time of the job of the product C to "10".
      <br/>
      The problem solving means 151b has the similar negotiation strategies.
      <br/>
      Thus, the problem solving means 151b determines whether or not the earliest start time of the job of the product C can be assigned to "10" with a tolerance.
      <br/>
      Since the latest end time of the job of the product C has been assigned to "10", the problem solving means 151b determines that the earliest start time of the job of the product C cannot be assigned to "10".
      <br/>
      Thus, the problem solving means 151b sends a reply that represents the rejection against the request to the problem solving means 151a through the communicating portion 161 (see FIG. 23B and step A2 in FIG. 24).
    </p>
    <p num="265">
      When negotiation strategies are fixed as with the conventional negotiation models, at this point, the problem solving means 151a determines that the operation time cannot be changed and thereby the product C or D cannot be scheduled.
      <br/>
      However, the problem solving means 151a according to the present invention causes the strategy selecting portion 166 to change the existing negotiation strategies into more proper negotiation strategies.
    </p>
    <p num="266">
      In other words, the state storing portion 164 of the problem solving means 151a counts the number of the operation time change requests that have been rejected.
      <br/>
      The strategy selecting portion 166 of the problem solving means 151a receives such information from the state storing portion 164, obtains negotiation strategies of which "role"=upper and "transaction"=minimum as more proper negotiation strategies from the strategy database 165, and sends the obtained negotiation strategies to the inferring portion 162.
      <br/>
      In this condition, the problem solving means 151a sends an operation time change request to the problem solving means 151b.
      <br/>
      Thus, the problem solving means 151a creates an operation time change request that causes the job of the product C to be assigned to the time range from "0" to "3" and the least end time of the job of the product D to be changed to "9" as the minimum change.
      <br/>
      The problem solving means 151a sends the created operation time change request to the problem solving means 151b through the communicating portion 161 (at step R3 in FIG. 24).
    </p>
    <p num="267">
      The state storing portion 164 of the problem solving means 151b counts the number of operation time change requests that have been rejected.
      <br/>
      The strategy selecting portion 166 of the problem solving means 151b receives such information from the state storing portion 164, obtains negotiation strategies of which "role"=low and "transaction"=minimum from the strategy data base 165, and sends the obtained negotiation strategies to the inferring portion 162.
      <br/>
      The inferring portion 162 determines whether or not the earliest start time of the job of the product D can be assigned to "9".
      <br/>
      Since the latest end time of the job (amount of work="2") of the product D has been assigned to "10", the problem solving means 151b determines that the earliest start time of the job of the product D cannot be assigned to "9".
      <br/>
      Thus, the problem solving means 151b issues a new operation time change request so as to allow it to accept the original request.
      <br/>
      In other words, the problem solving means 151b creates an operation time change request that causes the latest end time of the job of the product D to be changed to "11" so as to assign the earliest start time of the job of the product D to "9" and sends the created operation time change request to the problem solving means 151c (at step R4 in FIG. 24).
    </p>
    <p num="268">
      The problem solving means 151c has negotiation strategies of which "role"=equal and "transaction"=tolerance in the initial state.
      <br/>
      Thus, the problem solving means 151c determines whether or not the earliest start time of the job of the product D can be assigned to "11" with a tolerance.
      <br/>
      The problem solving means 151c determines that the job (amount of work=2) of the product D can be assigned to the time range from "11" to "15" with a tolerance.
      <br/>
      Thus, the problem solving means 151c accepts the request and sends a reply that represents the acceptance against the request to the problem solving means 151b.
      <br/>
      Thus, a negotiation between the problem solving means 151b and the problem solving means 151c is effected (see FIG. 23D and step A3 in FIG. 24).
      <br/>
      In addition, the problem solving means 151b can accept the request received from the problem solving means 151a and sends a reply that represent the acceptance against the request to the problem solving means 151a.
      <br/>
      Thus, a negotiation between the problem solving means 151a and the problem solving means 151b is also effected (see FIG. 23E and step A4 in FIG. 24).
      <br/>
      Thus, the jobs of the products C and D have been completely assigned.

    <p num="269">
      When the existing negotiation strategies are changed to more proper negotiation strategies corresponding to a give problem, a negotiation can be effected.

      As a result, the efficiency for solving a problem by the cooperative inferring apparatus can be improved.

      It should be noted that the present invention is not limited to the above-described embodiments.
      <br/>
      In other words, the field and content of an inference problem, the number of problem solving means that cooperatively operate, the categorizing method of negotiation strategies to which the present invention is applied are not limited.

      For example, the present invention can be applied to a trouble diagnosis and a plant control.
