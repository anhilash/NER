    <heading>FIELD OF INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">This invention relates to compounds which are useful as in the prophylactic and affirmative treatment of endotoxin exposure including sepsis, septicemia, endotoxemia and various forms of septic shock.</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="3">The invention relates to analogs of Lipid A which are useful as inhibitors of endotoxemia.</p>
    <p num="4">
      The incidence of gram negative bacteremia in the United States has been estimated to be approximately 100,000 to 300,000 cases per year, with a mortality rate of 30-60%.
      <br/>
      Antibiotics are commonly used as the primary chemotherapy for this disease; however, their bactericidal action can result in disruption of the bacterium and concomitant release of endotoxin, i.e., the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) moiety of the bacterial outer membrane.
      <br/>
      The liberated LPS induces a number of pathophysiological events in mammals (collectively referred to as gram-negative endotoxemia or sepsis syndrome).
      <br/>
      These include fever, generalized inflammation, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), hypotension, acute renal failure, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), hepatocelluiar destruction and cardiac failure.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      Although endotoxin initiates septic shock, it has little or no direct toxic effect on tissues; instead, it triggers an immunobiological response leading to a cascade of release of cytokines such as tumor-necrosis factor (TNF), interleukin-1, interieukin-6 and interieukin-8, and other biological mediators such as nitric oxide, as well as an array of secondary mediators (e.g., prostaglandins, leukotrienes, interferons, platelet-activating factor, endorphins and colony-stimulating factors).
      <br/>
      Generation of pathophysiological concentrations of these cytokines and inflammatory mediators influence vasomotor tone, microvascular permeability and the aggregation of leukocytes and platelets causing a syndrome termed systemic inflammatory response syndrome (or SIRS) and septic shock.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      The bacterial lipopolysaccharide molecule has three main regions: a long chain polysaccharide (O Antigen), a core region and a Lipid A region.
      <br/>
      The entire lipopolysaccharide molecule, as well as some of its individual components possess toxic effects described above.
      <br/>
      Most of these toxic effects, however, are believed to be attributable to the Lipid A portion.
      <br/>
      Structurally, Lipid A is composed of a diphosphorylated disaccharide acylated by long chain fatty acids.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      Therapies for endotoxin-related diseases have generally been directed towards controlling the inflammatory response.
      <br/>
      Such therapies include corticosteriod treatment, suggested to ameliorate endotoxin-mediated cell membrane injury and to reduce production of certain biological mediators; administration of antibodies designed to neutralize bacterial LPS; treatment with agents to suppress hypotension or with naloxone which apparently blocks the hypotensive effects associated with sepsis syndrome; and treatment with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, purported to block cyclooxygenanses and thereby decrease the production of certain secondary mediators such as prostaglandins and thromboxane.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      However, none of these therapies to date has resulted in significant reduction in the morbidity and mortality resulting from sepsis and septic shock syndrome.
      <br/>
      Thus there is a long felt need for agents to affirmatively treat this disorder.
    </p>

No. 07/935,050, filed Aug. 25, 1992, the contents of which are included by reference, disclose certain disaccharide compounds, such as B531 shown below, useful for the treatment of endotoxemia.

    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="11">
      The present invention is directed to the treatment of sepsis, septic shock, endotoxemia and related disorders using novel liposaccharide analogs.
      <br/>
      The compounds of the present invention possess advantages for pharmaceutical use such as enhanced pharmacological selectivity, efficacy, and in particular increased persistence of action.
      <br/>
      A representative compound of this invention, compound 1, is shown below:  (Chemical Structure image '2' not included in text)
    </p>
    <p num="12">
      Further, the present invention is directed to the prophylactic and affirmative treatment of any LPS-mediated disorder.
      <br/>
      These disorders include, but are not limited to, sepsis, septicemia (including but not limited to endotoxemia), endotoxemia resulting from gram negative bacteremia (with its accompanying symptoms of fever, generalized inflammation, disseminated intravascular coagulation, hypotension, acute renal failure, acute respiratory distress syndrome, adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), hepatocellular destruction and/or cardiac failure) and various forms of septic shock (including but not limited to endotoxic shock).
      <br/>
      Also, compounds of this invention will be useful in the prophylactic or affirmative treatment of localized or systemic inflammatory response to infection by different types of organisms, including gram negative bacteria, and in diseases related to translocation of gram negative bacteria or endotoxin from the gut.

    <p num="13">Together these disorders are termed systemic inflammatory response syndrome or SIRS (For a discussion of these terms, see Bone, et al., Chest 1992; 101: 1644-55).</p>
    <p num="14">Definitions</p>
    <p num="15">In accordance with the present invention and as used herein, the following terms, are defined with the following meanings, unless explicitly stated otherwise.</p>
    <p num="16">
      The term "alkyl" refers to aliphatic organic groups which may be branched or straight and which may be optionally substituted with one or more halogen atoms at any position along the alkyl chain.
      <br/>
      Alkyl groups include both groups which are have a single unoccupied valence, for example, --CH2 --CH3 and alkylene groups which have two unoccupied valences, for example --CH2 --CH2 --. As is obvious to those skilled in the art, the single or double unoccupied valence will be used as appropriate to describe compounds which are chemically stable.
    </p>
    <p num="17">
      The term "prodrug" as used herein refers to any compound that has less intrinsic activity than the "drug" but when administered to a biological system generates the "drug" substance either as a result of spontaneous chemical reaction or by enzyme catalyzed or metabolic reaction.
      <br/>
      Reference is made to various prodrugs such as acyl esters, carbonates, phosphates and urethanes, included herein as examples.
      <br/>
      The groups illustrated are exemplary, not exhaustive and one skilled in the art could prepare other known varieties of prodrugs.
      <br/>
      Such prodrugs of the compounds of Formula I fall within the scope of the present invention.
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      The term "pharmaceutically acceptable salt" includes salts of compounds of Formula I derived from the combination of a compound of this invention and an organic or inorganic acid or base.
      <br/>
      The compounds of Formula I are useful in both non-ionized and salt form.
      <br/>
      In practice the use of salt form amounts to use of base form; both forms are within the scope of the invention.
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      The term "geometric isomers" refers to "trans" or "cis" (or "entgegen" or "zusammen") isomers as generally understood by those skilled in the art.
      <br/>
      All geometric isomers are within the scope of the invention.
    </p>
    <p num="20">
      Further, compounds of the present invention may contain asymmetric carbon atoms and hence can exist as stereoisomers, both enantiomers and diastereomers.
      <br/>
      All stereoisomers and mixtures thereof are considered to fall within the scope of the present invention.
      <br/>
      The synthetic examples cited herein provide the most preferred isomer.
      <br/>
      It is evident that in addition to the sugar moiety, additional asymmetric carbons may be present in compounds of Formula I, for example being present in the side chains.
      <br/>
      In this event, all of the resulting diastereomers are considered to fall within the scope of the present invention.

    <p num="38">
      This invention is also directed to processes for preparing compounds of Formula I. Disclosed herein are general synthetic routes for preparing variously substituted compounds of this invention.
      <br/>
      The synthesis for a compound of this invention, compound 1, is shown below.
    </p>
    <p num="39">
      Most of the reagents and starting materials are well known to those skilled in the art.
      <br/>
      Certain reagents and starting materials for this preparation are described in detail by Christ, et al., in U.S. application Ser.
      <br/>
      No. 07/935,050 which will issue as U.S. Pat. No. 5,530,113, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference.
    </p>
    <p num="40">
      One synthesis of the compounds of this invention is outlined below.
      <br/>
      Although this example describes the preparation of compound 1, use of alternate starting materials will yield other analogs of this invention.
      <br/>
      Thus the synthesis is indeed general in nature.
    </p>
    <p num="41">For example, use of alternative alkylating agents in synthetic step 22 will provide analogs with structurally differing substituents at R1.</p>
    <p num="42">The substitution pattern at R2 is controlled by the use of the proper alkylating agent in step 15.</p>
    <p num="43">Further, substitution of suitable alternative compounds in step 25 in the synthesis will produce analogs which differ with respect to R3.</p>
    <p num="44">
      Analogs without the oxygenated side chain at RA may be prepared by using slight variations in the synthetic scheme shown below as is will known to those skilled in the art.
      <br/>
      For the compound in which RA is methyl, for example, the product of synthetic step 8, the tosylate, could have this leaving group replaced by iodine in the Finklestein reaction.
      <br/>
      The iodo compound could be dehalogenated by treatment with zinc metal to give a methyl group at position RA.
    </p>
    <p num="45">
      A representative synthesis of the R4 side chain is outlined below.
      <br/>
      The preparation of variations of this side chain may be achieved by replacing the starting material with other suitable starting materials.
      <br/>
      For example, the length or branching of this side chain may be prepared by starting with the appropriate starting material.
      <br/>
      Thus the use of alternative tosylates in step 6 will produce variation in R4.  (Chemical Structure image '33' not included in text)

      Generation of pathophysiological quantities of these cytokines has been found to play an important part in the initiation of the systemic inflammatory response syndrome and septic shock.

      Louis, Mo.) at 10 ng/mL or lipid A (Daiichi Chemicals, Tokyo, Japan) were added as 10-fold concentrated solutions in Ca++, Mg++ free Hank's balanced salt solution (CMF-HBSS; Gibco).
      <br/>
      In experiments involving analogs of the present invention, the analog was added immediately before addition of LPS or lipid A in CMF-HBSS (e.g., between 0 and 100  MU M as a 10 *  concentrated aliquot).
      <br/>
      Following incubation of three hours, plasma was prepared from whole blood,or culture supernatant was removed and assayed for the presence of the indicated cytokine using an ELISA assay kit from Genzyme (Cambridge, Mass.) following the instructions of the manufacturer, however, any other standard ELISA kits may be utilized.

      The results of this test are as shown in FIG. 1.

      Compound 1 inhibits LPS-induced production of TNF, exhibiting an IC50 of approximately 1.5 nM. Other analogs found to inhibit LPS-induced TNF production included compound 2, compound 3, compound 4, compound 5, compound 6, compound 7, compound 8, compound 9, and compound 10.

      Compounds of this invention similarly inhibited the LPS-induced production of other cytokines in human whole blood,even though some of these cytokines were generated several hours after addition of LPS.

      <br/>
      The study of this deactivation has led to the development of an assay to measure in vitro deactivation of drugs in human whole blood.
      <br/>
      This is done by preincubating lipid A antagonists with blood for various periods of time followed by addition of the LPS "challenge" as described above, incubation for three hours,and assay for released cytokines.

      Such disorders include without limitation: endotoxemia (or sepsis syndrome) resulting from a gram negative bacteremia (with its accompanying symptoms of fever, generalized inflammation, disseminated intravascular coagulation, hypotension, acute renal failure, acute respiratory distress syndrome, hepatocellular destruction. and/or cardiac failure); and LPS-mediated exacerbation of latent or active viral infections (e.g., infection with HIV-1, cytomegaloviruses,herpes simplex, and influenza virus).
    </p>
    <p num="199">
      The lipid A analog is typically administered in a pharmaceutically acceptable formulation, e.g., dissolved in physiological saline (which may include 5% glucose).
      <br/>
      When the lipid A analog is provided for the treatment of a viral infection, it may be administered in conjunction with appropriate viricidal agents.
      <br/>
      The Lipid A analog may be stored as a freeze-dried formulation.
    </p>
    <p num="200">Lipid A analogs are administered in dosages which provide suitable inhibition of LPS activation of target cells; generally, these dosages are, preferably, between 0.01-50 mg/patient/day, more preferably, between 0.05-25 mg/patient/day, and most preferably, between 1 and 12 mg/patient/day.</p>
    <p num="201">
      The drug should be injected or infused as soon as possible when SIRS can be diagnosed using clinical predictors such as the APACHE score (Knaus,et al., 1991 Chest 100: 1619-36 and Knaus,et al., 1993 JAMA: 1233-41) or other clinical predictors.
      <br/>
      In addition, injection or infusion should commence as soon as possible after exposure to endotoxin or diagnosis of systemic gram negative bacterial infection, especially if a more rapid or early diagnostic indicator of systematic gram negative infection becomes available.
    </p>
    <p num="202">
      Prophylactic indications for use of these drugs may include their use when exposure to endotoxin can be anticipated.
      <br/>
      This can occur when:
      <br/>
      1) there is an increased probability of elevation of systemic (blood-borne) endotoxin from systemic or localized gram negative bacterial infection (such as during surgery);
      <br/>
      2) there is an increased probability that blood levels of endotoxin may increase.
      <br/>
      In the normal physiological state, endotoxin only minimally translocates across the gut endothelium into splanchnic circulation.
      <br/>
      This translocated endotoxin is usually then cleared by the liver (and possibly other cells and organs).
      <br/>
      Increases in blood endotoxin levels can occur when the rate of endotoxin clearance by the liver (or other endotoxin sequestering cells or organs) decreases.
      <br/>
      Augmentation of gut translocation can occur after gut ischemia, hypoxia, trauma, or other injury to the integrity of the gut lining (or by drug or alcohol toxicity).
      <br/>
      Blood levels of endotoxin increase when liver function is compromised by disease (cirrhosis), damage (surgery or trauma), or temporary removal (as during liver transplantation);
      <br/>
      3) there is an acute or chronic exposure to externally-derived endotoxin resulting in inflammatory response; this exposure can be caused by inhalation or other means of uptake of endotoxin.
      <br/>
      One example of SIRS-inducing endotoxin uptake is corn dust fever (Schwartz, et al., 1994 Am J Physiol. 267: L609-17), which affects workers in the grain industry, for example, in the American mid-vest.
      <br/>
      Such workers can be prophylactically treated, e.g., daily, by inhaling an aerosolized formulation of the drug prior to beginning work in, e.g., fields or grain elevators.
    </p>
    <p num="203">
      For most other prophylactic and therapeutic applications, IV infusion or bolus injection will be used.
      <br/>
      Injection is most preferable, but infusion may be warranted in some cases by pharmacokinetic requirements.
    </p>
    <p num="204">The treatment should be initiated as soon as possible after diagnosis of SIRS, and should continue for at least three days,or when assessment of risk of mortality is reduced an acceptable level.</p>
