    <heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">This invention relates to glucagon-related peptides having intestinal tissue growth promoting properties, and to their use therapeutically to treat various medical conditions resulting from the impaired growth or loss of such tissue.</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND TO THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="3">
      Expression of the glucagon gene yields a tissue-determined variety of peptide products that are processed from the 160 residue proglucagon product.
      <br/>
      The organization of these peptides within the proglucagon precursor was elucidated by the molecular cloning of preproglucagon cDNAs from the rat, hamster and bovine pancreas.
      <br/>
      These analyses revealed that preproglucagon contains not only the sequence of glucagon and glicentin, but also two additional glucagon-like peptides (GLP-1 and GLP-2) separated from glucagon and each other by two spacer or intervening peptides (IP-I and IP-II).
      <br/>
      These peptides are flanked by pairs of basic amino acids, characteristic of classic prohormone cleavage sites, suggesting they might be liberated after posttranslational processing of proglucagon (Drucker, Pancreas, V1990, 5(4):484).
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      Analysis of the peptides liberated from proglucagon in the pancreatic islets of Langerhans, for instance, suggests the primary pancreatic peptide liberated is the 29-mer glucagon, whereas glicentin, oxyntomodulin, IP-II and the glucagon-like peptides are more prevalent in the small and large intestines.
      <br/>
      This demonstration that the glucagon-like peptides are found in the bowel has prompted research into the precise structure and putative function(s) of these newly discovered gut peptides.
      <br/>
      Most studies have focussed on GLP-1, because several lines of evidence suggested that GLP-1 may be an important new regulatory peptide.
      <br/>
      Indeed, it has been determined that GLP-1 is one of the most potent known peptidergic stimulus for insulin release, an action mediated in a glucose-dependent manner through interaction with receptors on pancreatic  BETA  cells.
      <br/>
      GLP-1 and its derivatives are in development for use in the treatment of diabetics.
    </p>
    <p num="5">The physiological roles of glicentin and oxyntomodulin, the so-called "enteroglucagons", are also under investigation, particularly with respect to regulation of acid secretion and the growth of intestinal cells.</p>
    <p num="6">
      Oxyntomodulin is capable of inhibiting pentagastrin-stimulated gastric acid secretion in a dose-dependent manner.
      <br/>
      The role of glicentin in mediating the changes of intestinal adaptation and growth of the intestinal mucosa has been investigated, and the intestinotrophic effect of glicentin and its therapeutic use have recently been reported by Matsuno et al in EP 612,531 published Aug. 31, 1994.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      In contrast to GLP-1 and other glucagon-related peptides, the physiological role of glucagon-like peptide GLP-2 remains poorly understood despite the isolation and sequencing of various GLP-2 homologues including human, rat, bovine, porcine, guinea pig and hamster.
      <br/>
      Using GLP-2 antisera raised against synthetic versions of GLP-2, various groups have determined that GLP-2 is present primarily in intestinal rather than pancreatic extracts (see Mojsov et al, J. Biol. Chem., 1986, 261(25):11880; Orskov et al in Endocrinology, 1986, 119(4):1467 and in Diabetologia, 1987, 30:874 and in FEBS Letters, 1989, 247(2):193; George et al, FEBS Letters, 1985, 192(2):275).
      <br/>
      With respect to its biological role, Hoosein et al report (FEBS Letters, 1984, 178(l):83) that GLP-2 neither competes with glucagon for binding to rat liver and brain tissues, nor stimulates adenylate cyclase production in liver plasma membranes, but, enigmatically, can stimulate adenylate cyclase in both rat hyopthalamic and pituitary tissue, at 30-50 pM concentrations.
      <br/>
      An elucidation of the physiological role of GLP-2 would clearly be desirable.
    </p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="8">
      There have now been discovered analogs of GLP-2 which promote growth of small bowel tissue.
      <br/>
      It is accordingly a general object of the present invention to provide such GLP-2 analogs and to provide for their use therapeutically and for related purposes.
    </p>
    <p num="9">In one aspect of the invention, the GLP-2-analogs exhibit intestinotrophic activity and conform to the structural Formula 1 (SEQ ID NO: 1)</p>

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="22">
      The invention relates to therapeutic and related uses of GLP-2 analogs, particularly for promoting growth of tissue of the small bowel.
      <br/>
      The effect on growth elicited by the present GLP-2 analogs manifests as an increase in small bowel weight, relative to a mock-treated control.
      <br/>
      In particular, GLP-2 analogs are considered to have "intestinotrophic" activity if, when assessed in the murine model exemplified herein, the analog mediates an increase in small bowel weight of at least 10% relative to a control animal receiving vehicle alone.
      <br/>
      Particularly suitable for therapeutic use are those analogs which mediate an increase of at least 20% in small bowel weight; preferred for therapeutic use are those which mediate an increase in small bowel weight of 50% or more.
      <br/>
      Intestinotrophic activity is noted most significantly in relation to the jejunum, including the distal jejunum and particularly the proximal jejunum, and is also noted in the ileum.
    </p>
    <p num="23">
      In addition to exhibiting intestinotrophic activity as just defined, the GLP-2 analogs of the present invention incorporate an amino acid substitution at one or more sites within a GLP-2 peptide "background", which is either a mammalian GLP-2 species per se, or is a variant of a mammalian GLP-2 species in which the C-terminus and/or the N-terminus has been altered by addition of one or two basic residues, or has been modified to incorporate a blocking group of the type used conventionally in the art of peptide chemistry to protect peptide termini from undesired biochemical attack and degradation in vivo.
      <br/>
      Thus, the present peptides incorporate an amino acid substitution in the context of any mammalian GLP-2 species, including but not limited to human GLP-2, bovine GLP-2, rat GLP-2, degu GLP-2, ox GLP-2, porcine GLP-2, guinea pig GLP-2 and hamster GLP-2, the sequences of which have been reported by many authors, including Buhl et al, J.

      Such analogs include, for example, those mammalian GLP-2 analogs and particularly the human GLP-2 analogs in which Xl is Tyr; X3 is Glu; X4 is Ala; P1 is Tyr-Ser-Lys-Tyr-(desIle); P2 is Ile-Ala or Val-Gln; and P3 is a covalent bond, or is Ile or Ile-Thr.
    </p>
    <p num="49">
      Still other GLP-2 analogs of the invention incorporate alterations of the N- or C-terminus by the addition of amino acids, by blocking groups, or by substituted amino acids.
      <br/>
      There are also provided intestinotrophic analogs of mammalian GLP-2, preferably human GLP-2, in which positions X1, X5, X7, X16-X18, X25, X30, or X33 incorporate a replacement amino acid other than that found in naturally occurring mammalian GLP-2's.
      <br/>
      Optionally, the invention provides intestinotrophic analogs in which from 4 to 8 residues are deleted from the C-terminus.
      <br/>
      Specific embodiments of such intestinotrophic analogs include: Ac-ratGLP-2(1-33); ratGLP-2(1-30); ratGLP-2(1-25); ratGLP-2(1-33)amide; �Arg-2, Arg-1 �ratGLP-2(2-33) �Pro1 �hGLP-2(1-33); �Gln20 �hGLP-2(1-33); �Asp1 �hGLP-2(1-33) �Tyr34 �hGLP-2(1-34); �desNH2Tyr1 �hGLP-2(1-33); �Thr5 �hGLP-2(1-33); �Ser16, Arg17, Arg18 �hGLP-2(1-33); �Agm34 �hGLP-2(1-34); �Arg30 �hGLP-2(1-33); �Ala5, Ala7 �hGLP-2(1-33); �Glu33 �hGLP-2(1-33); �Phe25 �hGLP-2(1-33); and �Tyr25 �hGLP-2(1-33).
    </p>
    <p num="50">
      The present GLP-2 analogs can be synthesized using standard techniques of peptide chemistry and can be assessed for intestinotrophic activity, all according to the guidance provided herein.
      <br/>
      With respect to synthesis, the selected GLP-2 analog can be prepared by a variety of techniques well known for generating peptide products.
      <br/>
      Those GLP-2 analogs that incorporate only L-amino acids can be produced in commercial quantities by application of recombinant DNA technology.
      <br/>
      For this purpose, DNA coding for the desired GLP-2 analog is incorporated into an expression vector and transformed into a microbial, e.g., yeast, or other cellular host, which is then cultured under conditions appropriate for GLP-2 expression.
      <br/>
      A variety of gene expression systems have been adapted for this purpose, and typically drive expression of the desired gene from expression regulatory elements used naturally by the chosen host.
      <br/>
      Because GLP-2 does not require post translational glycosylation for its activity, its production may most conveniently be achieved in bacterial hosts such as E. coli.
      <br/>
      For such production, DNA coding for the selected GLP-2 peptide may usefully be placed under expression controls of the lac, trp or PL genes of E. coli.
      <br/>
      As an alternative to expression of DNA coding for the GLP-2 per se, the host can be adapted to express GLP-2 peptide as a fusion protein in which the GLP-2 is linked releasably to a carrier protein that facilitates isolation and stability of the expression product.
    </p>
    <p num="51">In an approach universally applicable to the production of a selected GLP-2 analog, and one used necessarily to produce GLP-2 analogs that incorporate non-genetically encoded amino acids and N- and C-terminally derivatized forms, the well established techniques of automated peptide synthesis are employed, general descriptions of which appear, for example, in J. M. Stewart and J. D. Young, Solid Phase Peptide Synthesis, 2nd Edition, 1984, Pierce Chemical Company, Rockford, Ill.; and in M. Bodanszky and A.</p>
    <p num="52">
      Bodanszky, The Practice of Peptide Synthesis, 1984, Springer-Verlag, New York; Applied Biosystems 430A Users Manual, 1987, ABI Inc., Foster City, Calif.
      <br/>
      In these techniques, GLP-2 analog is grown from its C-terminal, resin-conjugated residue by the sequential addition of appropriately protected amino acids, using either the Fmoc or tBoc protocols, as described for instance by Orskov et al, 1989, supra.
    </p>
    <p num="53">
      For the incorporation of N- and/or C- blocking groups, protocols conventional to solid phase peptide synthesis methods can also be applied.
      <br/>
      For incorporation of C-terminal blocking groups, for example, synthesis of the desired peptide is typically performed using, as solid phase, a supporting resin that has been chemically modified so that cleavage from the resin results in a GLP-2 peptide having the desired C-terminal blocking group.
      <br/>
      To provide peptides in which the C-terminus bears a primary amino blocking group, for instance, synthesis is performed using a p-methylbenzhydrylamine (MBHA) resin so that, when peptide synthesis is completed, treatment with hydrofluoric acid releases the desired C-terminally amidated peptide.
      <br/>
      Similarly, incorporation of an N-methylamine blocking group at the C-terminus is achieved using N-methylaminoethyl-derivatized DVB resin, which upon HF treatment releases peptide bearing an N-methylamidated C-terminus.
      <br/>
      Protection of the C-terminus by esterification can also be achieved using conventional procedures.
      <br/>
      This entails use of resin/blocking group combination that permits release of side-chain protected peptide from the resin, to allow for subsequent reaction with the desired alcohol, to form the ester function.
      <br/>
      FMOC protecting groups, in combination with DVB resin derivatized with methoxyalkoxybenzyl alcohol or equivalent linker, can be used for this purpose, with cleavage from the support being effected by TFA in dichloromethane.
      <br/>
      Esterification of the suitably activated carboxyl function, e.g., with DCC, can then proceed by addition of the desired alcohol, followed by deprotection and isolation of the esterified GLP-2 peptide.
    </p>
    <p num="54">
      Incorporation of N-terminal blocking groups can be achieved while the synthesized GLP-2 peptide is still attached to the resin, for instance by treatment with suitable anhydride and nitrile.
      <br/>
      To incorporate an acetyl blocking group at the N-terminus, for instance, the resin-coupled peptide can be treated with 20% acetic anhydride in acetonitrile.
      <br/>
      The N-blocked GLP-2 analog can then be cleaved from the resin, deprotected and subsequently isolated.
    </p>
    <p num="55">
      Once the desired GLP-2 analog has been synthesized, cleaved from the resin and fully deprotected, the peptide is then purified to ensure the recovery of a single oligopeptide having the selected amino acid sequence.
      <br/>
      Purification can be achieved using any of the standard approaches, which include reversed-phase high-pressure liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) on alkylated silica columns, e.g., C4 -, C8 -, or C18 - silica.
      <br/>
      Such column fractionation is generally accomplished by running linear gradients, e.g., 10-90%, of increasing % organic solvent, e.g., acetonitrile, in aqueous buffer, usually containing a small amount (e.g., 0.1%) of pairing agent such as TFA or TEA.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, ion-exchange HPLC can be employed to separate peptide species on the basis of their charge characteristics.
      <br/>
      Column fractions are collected, and those containing peptide of the desired/required purity are optionally pooled.
      <br/>
      In one embodiment of the invention, the GLP-2 analog is then treated in the established manner to exchange the cleavage acid (e.g., TFA) with a pharmaceutically acceptable acid, such as acetic, hydrochloric, phosphoric, maleic, tartaric, succinic and the like, to generate a pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salt of the peptide.
    </p>
    <p num="56">
      For administration to patients, the GLP-2 analog or its salt is desirably provided in pharmaceutically acceptable form, e.g., as a preparation that is sterile-filtered, e.g., through a 0.22 MU  filter, and substantially pyrogen-free.
      <br/>
      Desirably, the GLP-2 analog to be formulated migrates as a single or individualized peak on HPLC, exhibits uniform and authentic amino acid composition and sequence upon analysis thereof, and otherwise meets standards set by the various national authorities which regulate quality of pharmaceutical products.
    </p>
    <p num="57">
      For therapeutic use, the chosen GLP-2 analog is formulated with a carrier that is pharmaceutically acceptable and is appropriate for delivering the peptide by the chosen route of administration.
      <br/>
      Suitable pharmaceutically acceptable carriers are those used conventionally with peptide-based drugs, such as diluents, excipients and the like.
      <br/>
      Reference may be made to "Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences", 17th Ed., Mack Publishing Company, Easton, Pa., 1985, for guidance on drug formulations generally.
      <br/>
      In one embodiment of the invention, the compounds are formulated for administration by infusion, e.g., when used as liquid nutritional supplements for patients on total parenteral nutrition therapy, or by injection, e.g., sub-cutaneously, intramuscularly or intravenously, and are accordingly utilized as aqueous solutions in sterile and pyrogen-free form and optionally buffered to physiologically tolerable pH, e.g., a slightly acidic or physiological pH.
      <br/>
      Thus, the compounds may be administered in a vehicle such as distilled water or, more desirably, in saline, phosphate buffered saline or 5% dextrose solution.
      <br/>
      Water solubility of the GLP-2 analog may be enhanced, if desired, by incorporating a solubility enhancer, such as acetic acid.
    </p>
    <p num="58">
      The aqueous carrier or vehicle can be supplemented for use as injectables with an amount of gelatin that serves to depot the GLP-2 analog at or near the site of injection, for its slow release to the desired site of action.
      <br/>
      Concentrations of gelatin effective to achieve the depot effect are expected to lie in the range from 10-20%.
      <br/>
      Alternative gelling agents, such as hyaluronic acid, may also be useful as depoting agents.

      The GLP-2 analogs of the invention may also be formulated as a slow release implantation device for extended and sustained administration of GLP-2 analog.

      Examples of such sustained release formulations include composites of biocompatible polymers, such as poly(lactic acid), poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid), methylcellulose, hyaluronic acid, collagen, and the like.

      The structure, selection and use of degradable polymers in drug delivery vehicles have been reviewed in several publications, including, A. Domb et al., Polymers for Advanced Technologies 3:279-292 (1992).

      The GLP-2 analog can be utilized in the form of a sterile-filled vial or ampoule, that contains an intestinotrophic amount of the peptide, in either unit dose or multi-dose amounts.

      <br/>
      Alternatively, the vial or ampoule may contain the GLP-2 peptide in a form, such as a lyophilized form, suitable for reconstitution in a suitable carrier, such as phosphate-buffered saline.

      As an alternative to injectable formulations, the GLP-2 analog may be formulated for administration by other routes.

      <br/>
      According to the present invention, the GLP-2 analog is administered to treat patients that would benefit from growth of small bowel tissue.
      <br/>
      The effects of GLP-2 analog on this tissue, as evidenced by the results exemplified herein, is dramatic and would clearly benefit those patients suffering from diseases or conditions marked by abnormalities in the small intestinal tract mucosa, which include ulcers and inflammatory disorders; congenital or acquired digestion and absorption disorders including malabsorption syndromes; and diseases and conditions caused by loss of small bowel mucosal function particularly in patients undergoing extended parenteral feeding or who, as a result of surgery, have undergone resection of the small bowel and suffer from short-gut syndrome and cul-de-sac syndrome.
      <br/>
      Therapeutic treatment with GLP-2 analog is administered so as to reduce or eliminate the disease symptoms and/or improve the nutritional status in these patients associated with their reduced intestinal tract mucosal function.
      <br/>
      For example, GLP-2 analog is administrated to a patient with an inflammatory bowel condition in an amount sufficient to ameliorate the intestinal discomfort and diarrhea caused by the condition.
      <br/>
      Additionally, GLP-2 analog may be administered to patients with malabsorption disorders so as to enhance the nutritional absorption and thereby improve the nutritional status of such patients.
    </p>
    <p num="62">
      In general, patients who would benefit from increased small intestinal mass and consequent increased small bowel mucosal function are candidates for treatment with GLP-2 analog.
      <br/>
      Particular conditions that may be treated with GLP-2 analog include the various forms of sprue including celiac sprue which results from a toxic reaction to  ALPHA -gliadin from wheat, and is marked by a tremendous loss of villae of the small bowel; tropical sprue which results from infection and is marked by partial flattening of the villae; hypogammaglobulinemic sprue which is observed commonly in patients with common variable immunodeficiency or hypogammaglobulinemia and is marked by significant decrease in villus height.
      <br/>
      The therapeutic efficacy of the GLP-2 analog treatment may be monitored by enteric biopsy to examine the villus morphology, by biochemical assessment of nutrient absorption, by patient weight gain, or by amelioration of the symptoms associated with these conditions.
      <br/>
      Other conditions that may be treated with GLP-2 analog, or for which GLP-2 analog may be useful prophylactically, include radiation enteritis, infectious or post-infectious enteritis, regional enteritis (Crohn's disease), small intestinal damage due to toxic or other chemotherapeutic agents, and patients with short bowel syndrome.
    </p>
    <p num="63">
      The therapeutic dosing and regimen most appropriate for patient treatment will of course vary with the disease or condition to be treated, and according to the patient's weight and other parameters.
      <br/>
      The results presented hereinbelow demonstrate that a dose of GLP-2 peptide equivalent to about 100 MU g/kg (or less) administered twice daily over 10 days can generate very significant increases in small bowel mass.
      <br/>
      It is expected that much smaller doses, e.g., in the  MU g/kg range, and shorter or longer duration or frequency of treatment, will also produce therapeutically useful results, i.e., a statistically significant increase particularly in small bowel mass.
      <br/>
      Also, it is anticipated that the therapeutic regimen will include the administration of maintenance doses appropriate for reversing tissue regression that occurs following cessation of initial treatment.
      <br/>
      The dosage sizes and dosing regimen most appropriate for human use are guided by the results herein presented, and can be confirmed in properly designed clinical trials.
    </p>
    <p num="64">
      An effective dosage and treatment protocol may be determined by conventional means, starting with a low dose in laboratory animals and then increasing the dosage while monitoring the effects, and systematically varying the dosage regimen as well.
      <br/>
      Numerous factors may be taken into consideration by a clinician when determining an optimal dosage for a given subject.
      <br/>
      Primary among these is the amount of GLP-2 normally circulating in the plasma, which is on the order of 151 pmol/ml in the resting state, rising to 225 pmol/ml after nutrient ingestion for healthy adult humans.
      <br/>
      Orskow, C. and Helst, J. J., 1987, Scand. J. Clin. Lav. Invest. 47:165. Additional factors include the size of the patient, the age of the patient, the general condition of the patient, the particular disease being treated, the severity of the disease, the presence of other drugs in the patient, the in vivo activity of the GLP-2 analog and the like.
      <br/>
      The trial dosages would be chosen after consideration of the results of animal studies and the clinical literature.
      <br/>
      It will be appreciated by the person of ordinary skill in the art that information such as binding constants and Ki derived from in vitro GLP-2 binding competition assays may also be used in calculating dosages, as well as the calculated half-life of the GLP-2 analog in vivo.
    </p>
    <p num="65">
      A typical human dose of a GLP-2 peptide would be from about 10  MU g/kg body weight/day to about 10 mg/kg/day, preferably from about 50  MU g/kg/day to about 5 mg/kg/day, and most preferably about 100  MU g/kg/day to 1 mg/kg/day.
      <br/>
      As the GLP-2 analogs of the invention can be up to 10 to even 100 times more potent than GLP-2, a typical dose of such a GLP-2 analog may be lower, for example, from about 100 ng/kg body weight/day to 1 mg/kg/day, preferably 1  MU g/kg/day to 500 MU g/kg/day, and even more preferably 1  MU g/kg/day to 100 MU g/kg/day.

      The cleavage product of the control peptide, rGLP-2(1-33), which should be rGLP-2(3-33), was confirmed to have result from cleavage between residues Ala2 and Asp3 by comparison of the retention time of this component to that of a synthetic peptide standard, rGLP-2(3-33), and by collection of the product from the HPLC and analysis by mass spectrometry.

      It can be readily seen from the above table that analogs of malian GLP-2 molecules can have enhanced intestinotrophic activity.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, it is clear that depending on the substitution made, various levels of intestinotrophic activity are manifest.
      <br/>
      For example, �Gly2 �rGLP-2 has a greatly enhanced intestinotrphic activity compared to the naturally occuring molecule; �Gly2 �hGLP-2 has a substantially increased intestinotrophic activity compared with rGLP-2 and �Leu10 �rGLP-2 has less than a 50% increase in intestinotrophic activity.

      The following experiments were conducted to confirm that the increase in bowel weight seen in experimental animals treated with DPP-IV resistant analogs of GLP-2, compared with animals treated with wild-type GLP-2, was attributable in part to the DPP-IV resistant nature of the molecules.
      <br/>
      This experiment took advantage of the availability of a DPP-IV deficient rat strain, Fisher 334 DPP-IV- rats.
      <br/>
      The effect of rGLP-2 injections on small bowel weight in the Fisher DPP-IV deficient rats was compared to that in normal Sprague-Dawley rats.
    </p>
    <p num="93">
      In the following experiments the Sprague-Dawley rats were injected s.c. twice daily with rGLP-2 in the Gelatin formulation.
      <br/>
      The Fisher rats were injected s.c. twice daily with GLP-2 peptides (both rGLP-2, and rGLP-2 analogs) in PBS.
    </p>
    <p num="94">
      Normal Sprague-Dawley rats treated with rGLP-2, 2.5  MU g b.i.d. or 25  MU g b.i.d., showed no % change in small bowel weight compared to control animals given vehicle alone.
      <br/>
      However, Fisher 334 DPP-IV-rats (DPP-IV deficient animals) demonstrated approximately a 40-50% increase in % change in small bowel weight when treated with 20  MU g b.i.d. rGLP-2 compared to animals treated with vehicle only.
      <br/>
      Moreover, DPP-IV deficient animals treated with 20  MU g �Gly2 �rGLP-2 showed a 50-60% increase in % change in small bowel weight compared with animals given vector alone.
      <br/>
      Further, Fisher 344 wild-type rats showed 75-85% increase in small bowel weight, over control animals given vehicle alone, when treated with 20  MU g b.i.d. of �Gly2 �rGLP-2.
    </p>
    <p num="95">
      The above results strongly indicate that GLP-2 is inactivated in vivo in normal rats by cleavage of the two N-terminal residues by a DPP-IV-like enzyme.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, these results demonstrate that a GLP-2 analog modified so as to be resistant to cleavage by DPP-IV caused a substantial increase in bowel weight in normal rats, presumably as a result of increased GPL-2 half-life in vivo.
    </p>
    <p num="96">
      As the DPP-IV cleavage site is conserved in all known naturally occurring forms of GLP-2 it seems likely that in mammals DPP-IV cleavage is an important, and probably the primary mechanism whereby GLP-2 is inactivated in vivo.
      <br/>
      Importantly, GLP-2 analogs resistant to DPP-IV cleavage have enhanced intestinotrophic activity compared to native form.
