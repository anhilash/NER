    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="12">
      The alumina used in making the inventive compositions can be any alumina which when contacted with a feedstock containing n-butane under suitable operating conditions is not detrimental to the conversion of n-butane to butenes.
      <br/>
      The alumina can be alpha-alumina, beta-alumina, gamma-alumina, eta-alumina, delta-alumina, or combinations of any two or more thereof.
      <br/>
      The presently preferred alumina is gamma-alumina having a surface area in the range of about 40 m2 /g to about 300 m2 /g, a total pore volume in the range of about 0.1 ml/g to about 1 ml/g.
      <br/>
      These aluminas are commercially available as extrudate pellets.
    </p>
    <p num="13">
      According to the present invention any tin-containing compound which when combined with alumina is effective in producing butenes from the conversion of n-butane can be employed.
      <br/>
      Examples of preferred compounds are organic tin compounds that can be dissolved in organic solvents, these include, but are not limited to, tributyl tin acetate, trimethyltin, tetra-n-propyltin, tributyl tin hydride, trimethyl tin hydroxide, tri-n-propyltin hydroxide, tri-n-propyltin acetate, and mixtures of two or more thereof.
      <br/>
      Tributyl tin acetate is most preferred.
    </p>
    <p num="14">
      The amount of tin incorporated or impregnated into the alumina should provide a concentration effective to assure predetermined butene conversion yields employing the catalyst composition in the selective dehydrogenation of feedstock that contains n-butane.
      <br/>
      Generally, the weight percent of tin present in the impregnated alumina is in a range of about 0.001 to about 10 weight percent of the impregnated alumina composition.
      <br/>
      The preferred concentration of tin in the impregnated zeolite is in the range of about 0.01 to about 5 weight percent and, more preferably, from about 0.1 to about 2 weight percent of the impregnated zeolite composition.
    </p>
    <p num="15">
      It is essential to this invention that the alumina impregnated with tin be treated in the presence of steam at an elevated temperature.
      <br/>
      In the preferred embodiment of the invention the alumina impregnated with tin is a tin-aluminate.
    </p>
    <p num="16">
      Generally, this steam treatment can be conducted at a pressure in a range from below atmospheric pressure to about 1000 pounds per square inch absolute (psia).
      <br/>
      More typically, however, the pressure range is from about atmospheric to about 100 psia.
      <br/>
      The temperature of this steam treatment is generally in the range of about 400 (degree)  C. to about 1000 (degree)  C. Preferably, this temperature range is from about 500 (degree)  C. to about 850 (degree)  C. and, most preferably, the temperature of this heat treatment is in a range of about 550 (degree)  C. to about 750 (degree)  C.
    </p>
    <p num="17">
      The steam treated tin-aluminate is then impregnated with a platinum compound.
      <br/>
      Generally, any platinum-containing compound can be employed in the process of this invention.
      <br/>
      Examples of suitable platinum compounds include, but are not limited to, chloroplatinic acid, platinic chloride, platinum bromide, platinum iodide, tetramine platinum chloride, tetramine platinum nitrate, tetramine platinum hydroxide, tetrachlorodiamine platinum and combinations of any two or more thereof.
      <br/>
      Chloroplatinic acid is preferred.
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      The impregnating solution is an aqueous solution to which can be added a small amount of acid to aid in stabilizing the impregnating solution.
      <br/>
      Presently, when chloroplatinic acid, the preferred platinum compound, is used, hydrochloric acid (HCl) is added to the impregnating solution in an amount up to about 2 weight percent of the total aqueous impregnating solution.
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      The amount of platinum incorporated or impregnated into the tin-containing composition should provide a concentration effective to assure predetermined butene conversion yields employing the catalyst composition in the selective dehydrogenation of feedstock that contains n-butane.
      <br/>
      Generally, the weight percent of platinum present in the impregnated alumina is in a range of about 0.001 to about 10 weight percent of the impregnated zeolite composition.
      <br/>
      The preferred concentration of platinum in the impregnated zeolite is in the range of about 0.01 to about 5 weight percent and, more preferably, from about 0.1 to about 2 weight percent of the impregnated zeolite composition.
    </p>
    <p num="20">
      The platinum-impregnated tin-containing catalyst composition is treated at an elevated temperature in the presence of an oxygen containing atmosphere, preferably air.
      <br/>
      Generally, this calcination can be conducted at a pressure in a range from below atmospheric pressure to about 1000 pounds per square inch absolute (psia).
      <br/>
      More typically, however, the pressure range is from about atmospheric to about 100 psia.
      <br/>
      The temperature of this heat treatment is generally in the range of about 400 (degree)  C. to about 800 (degree)  C. Preferably, this temperature range is from about 450 (degree)  C. to about 700 (degree)  C. and, most preferably, the temperature of this heat treatment is in a range of about 500 (degree)  C. to about 600 (degree)  C.
    </p>
    <p num="21">
      The chlorination of the calcined tin-aluminate containing platinum can be carried out by heating with a gas containing hydrogen an at least one chlorine-containing compound which can be HCl, a chloroalkane or mixture of these chlorination agents.
      <br/>
      Suitable chloroalkanes, which generally contain 1-4 carbon atoms per molecule and 1-6 chlorine atoms per molecule, can be, but are not limited to, chloromethane, dichloromethane, trichloromethane, carbon tetrachloride, chloroethane, 1,1-dichloroethane, 1,2-dichloroethane, trichloroethanes, tetrachloroethanes, hexachloroethanes, 1-chloropropane, 2-chloropropane, 1,2-dichloropropane, 1,3-dichloropropane, 2,2-dichloropropane, trichloropropanes, tetrachloropropanes, chlorobutanes, dichlorobutanes, trichlorobutanes, tetrachlorobutanes, and the like, and mixtures thereof.
      <br/>
      HCl is the preferred chlorination agent for this invention.
    </p>
    <p num="22">
      The molar ratio of hydrogen to the chlorinating agent is generally about 0.01:1 to about 100:1, preferably from about 0.05:1 to about 50:1, and more preferably from about 0.2:1 to about 20:1.
      <br/>
      It is also within the scope of this invention to have an inert diluent such as nitrogen, helium, neon or argon present in the chlorination gas mixture.
    </p>
    <p num="23">The chlorination is carried out at a temperature in the range of about 50 (degree)  C. to about 700 (degree)  C., preferably from about 150 (degree)  C. to about 600 (degree)  C., more preferably from about 300 (degree)  C. to about 500 (degree)  C. After the material is chlorinated it is cooled to room temperature, preferably in an inert atmosphere.</p>
    <p num="24">
      The processes of this invention applies most specifically to the conversion of n-butane to butenes and BTX.
      <br/>
      The feedstock can be any feedstock that contains n-butane.
      <br/>
      The higher the content of n-butane the more preferred is a feedstock for this invention.
      <br/>
      Among the feedstocks for which this invention is useful are those having a content of cracked hydrocarbon feedstocks from the catalytic cracking (e.g., fluidized catalytic cracking and hydrocracking) of gas oils and the thermal cracking of light hydrocarbons, naphthas, gas oils, reformates and straight-run gasoline.
      <br/>
      The cracked gasoline feedstock generally comprises hydrocarbons containing 2-16 carbon atoms per molecule chosen from among paraffins (alkanes) and/or olefins (alkenes) and/or naphthenes (cycloalkanes).
      <br/>
      A more preferred feedstock for the process of this invention is a cracked gasoline derived from the fluidized catalytic cracking of gas oil, suitable for use as at least a gasoline blend stock generally having a boiling range of from about 80 (degree)  F. to about 430 (degree)  F. The boiling range of the cracked hydrocarbon feedstock is determined by the standard ASTM method for measuring the initial boiling point and the end-point temperatures.
      <br/>
      Generally the content of paraffins exceeds the combined content of olefins, naphthenes, and aromatics (if present).
    </p>
    <p num="25">
      Feedstock containing n-butane and the catalyst compositions can be contacted within a reaction zone in any suitable manner.
      <br/>
      The contacting can be operated with a catalyst bed in a reactor vessel as a batch process or, preferably, as a continuous process.
      <br/>
      In either a batch or a continuous process a solid catalyst bed can be employed.
      <br/>
      Both the batch and continuous modes of operation have known advantages and disadvantages so that one skilled in the art can select the mode most suitable for a particular feedstock to be contacted with the inventive catalyst arrangement.
    </p>
    <p num="26">
      Contacting the feedstock containing n-butane and the catalyst composition is carried out in a reaction zone containing the catalyst compositions while employing reaction conditions that promote the conversion of n-butane with the formation of butenes and, with the chlorinated catalyst, the formation of BTX.
      <br/>
      The reaction temperature employed in the contacting is in the range of from about 300 (degree)  C. to about 800 (degree)  C., preferably, from about 400 (degree)  C. to about 700 (degree)  C. and, more preferably, from 500 (degree)  C. to about 600 (degree)  C. The pressure employed in the contacting can range from subatmospheric up to about 500 psia and, preferably, from about atmospheric to about 400 psia.
    </p>
    <p num="27">
      The flow rate at which the feedstock is charged to the conversion reaction zone for contact with the catalyst composition is selected to provide a weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) in a range having an upward limit of about 1000 hour-1.
      <br/>
      The term "weight hourly space velocity", as used herein, shall mean the numerical ratio of the rate at which a cracked hydrocarbon feedstock is charged to the conversion reaction zone in pounds per hour divided by the pounds of catalyst contained in the conversion reaction zone to which the hydrocarbon is charged.
      <br/>
      The preferred WHSV of the feed to the conversion reaction zone, or contacting zone, can be in the range of from about 0.25 hour-1 to about 250 hour-1 and, more preferably, from about 0.5 hour-1 to about 100 hour-1.

    <heading>EXAMPLE II</heading>
    <p num="49">This example illustrates the use of the Zeolite materials described in Example I as catalysts in the conversion of n-butane to butenes.</p>
    <p num="50">
      For each of the test runs, a sample of about 2.8 g of the catalyst materials described in Example I was placed into a stainless steel tube reactor (length: about 18 inches; inner diameter: about 0.5 inch).
      <br/>
      An n-butane feedstock was passed through the reactor at a flow rate of about 5 WHSV, at a temperature of about 550 (degree)  C. and at atmospheric pressure (about 0 psig).
      <br/>
      Hydrogen, at a rate of 1.2 L/hr and a mol ratio of hydrogen to hydrocarbon of about 2.2, was used a carrier gas for all catalysts.
      <br/>
      The formed reaction product exited the reactor tube and passed through several ice-cooled traps.
      <br/>
      The liquid portion remained in these traps and was weighed.
      <br/>
      The volume of the gaseous portion which exited the traps was measured in a "wet test meter".
      <br/>
      Liquid and gaseous product samples (collected at hourly intervals) were analyzed by means of a gas chromatograph.

      A comparison of the products of the n-butane conversions shows that Catalysts E-G impregnated sequentially and treated sequentially with steam and air provide both better activity and better selectivity toward butene production than either the co-impregnated Catalysts A-D or the sequentially impregnated catalyst treated only by air calcination (Catalysts A-D and H).
      <br/>
      A direct comparison between the sequential steam/air treatment and a sequential air/air treatment can be made noting the conversion of n-butane, butenes produced and the selectivity to butenes and isobutylene using Catalyst F as compared to using Catalyst H. In the comparison the much higher conversion of n-butane to C4 is an economic compensation for the slightly lower selectivity to isobutylene.
