    <p num="1">The claimed invention concerns new pentacyclic rhodamine derivatives whose fluorescence emission maxima are in the range of ca. 520 to 720 nm, biomolecules labelled with these derivatives and their use in diagnostic systems.</p>

      Numerous rhodamine derivatives are known which can be used as markers (labelled substances) in the form of hydrophilic derivatives with appropriate reactive groups.
      <br/>
      Such compounds are for example obtained by reacting NHS esters of tetramethylcarboxyrhodamine or carboxy-rhodamine 101 (RHODOS) with proteins containing amino groups, which are used in diagnostic systems.
      <br/>
      Examples of hapten-fluorescent conjugates are described in EP-A-285179 but the described compounds have absorption maxima at wavelengths of less than 600 nm.

      EP 0 543 333 discloses long wavelength rhodamine-like derivatives which have an absorption maximum above 600 nm.

    <p num="4">
      EP 0 567 622 also discloses the preparation of long wavelength rhodamine derivatives with absorption maxima above 600 nm.
      <br/>
      However, the synthesis of corresponding nucleic acid conjugates and the use of the described compounds as a component of fluorescence resonance energy transfer systems like those that have become established in nucleic acid analysis (Bio Techniques Vol. 22, No.1, p. 130-138, 1997) has not been previously described.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      The fluorescent dye fluorescein is widely used because of its spectral properties and its general availability and it is used for a wide variety of applications.
      <br/>
      In so-called FRET systems fluorescein usually acts as a fluorescence resonance energy donor in which various fluorescence resonance energy acceptors can be potentially used depending on the analytical test procedure.
      <br/>
      However, the use of FRET systems in nucleic acid analysis has previously been limited to the use of cyanine derivatives such as Cy5 (PCR Methods Appl. 4, 357-362, 1995) and the rhodamine derivatives TAMRA and ROX (Anal.Biochem. 252, 78-88, 1997).
    </p>
    <p num="6">The object of the present invention is therefore to provide new rhodamine derivatives with improved spectral properties in the long wavelength range which are especially suitable for forming a fluorescence resonance electron transfer pair together with other dyes to enable the use of biomolecules labelled with the rhodamine derivatives for analytical or diagnostic purposes.</p>
    <p num="7">Hence the invention concerns compounds of the general formulae  (Chemical Structure image '2' not included in text)</p>
    <p num="8">

      <br/>
      R1 and R2 are either identical or different and denote either hydrogen, alkyl with 1-20 C atoms, polyoxyhydrocarbyl units, phenyl or phenylalkyl with 1-3 carbon atoms in the alkyl chain in which the alkyl and/or phenyl residues can be substituted by one or several hydroxy, halogen, sulfonic acid, amino, carboxy or alkoxycarbonyl groups where alkoxy can have 1-4 carbon atoms.
      <br/>
      R1 contains at least one activatable group.
      <br/>
      R2 and X4 can be optionally linked together by a bridge composed of 0-2 C atoms.
      <br/>
      In contrast to the previously known state of the art, these compounds are characterized in that A1, A2 and A3 can independently of one another denote halogen, cyano, hydrogen, carboxylic acid, phosphoric acid or sulfonic acid; B1 denotes either halogen, cyano or hydrogen; and B2 is selected from a group comprising hydrogen, amide, halogen and an alkyl residue with 1-20 C atoms.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      It has turned out to be advantageous when at least one residue of the group A1, A2, A3 and B1 represents a halogen and in particular fluorine or chlorine.
      <br/>
      Preferably all residues A1, A2, A3 and B1 are halogens and in particular fluorine or chlorine.
      <br/>
      The preparation of such compounds is relatively simple when all residues A1, A2, A3 and B1 are either only fluorine or only chlorine.
      <br/>
      Compounds are also preferred in which B2 is identical with a hydrogen atom.
      <br/>
      However, B2 can alternatively also denote fluorine or chlorine, such compounds being particularly simple to synthesize when all the residues A1, A2, A3, B1 and B2 are either only fluorine or only chlorine.

    <p num="10">
      The residues X1, X2, X3, X4, X7, X10, X14 and X15 are preferably hydrogen.

      The residues X5, X6, X8, X9, X11, X12, X13 and X16 are preferably methyl residues.
      <br/>
      Those compounds are particularly preferred in which all residues X1, X2, X2, X4, X7 and X10 represent hydrogen residues and all residues X5, X6, X8, X9, X11 and X12 represent methyl residues.

    <p num="11">
      The residues R1 and R2 can either be identical or different but at least R1 contains an activatable group such as amino, hydroxyl or carboxyl.
      <br/>
      R1 preferably contains exactly one activatable group.
      <br/>
      In a particularly preferred embodiment R1 is a hydroxyethyl residue or a carboxypropyl residue.
    </p>
    <p num="12">
      If R2 is different from R1, R2 is preferably hydrogen or an alkyl with 1 to 20 C atoms.
      <br/>
      It is then particularly preferably hydrogen or an ethyl residue.

    <p num="13">
      The compounds according to the invention provide molecules which, due to their spectral properties (absorption maxima in the range of ca. 500 nm and above and emission maxima in the range between ca. 520 and 720 nm), are very suitable as dyes and in particular as fluorescent dyes.
      <br/>
      In this connection the spectral properties of the molecules can be changed by modifying the identity, number and position of the halogen residues with regard to A1, A2, A3 and B1.
      <br/>
      In this manner it is possible to produce fluorescent dyes with almost any absorption and emission maxima in the range between ca. 520 nm and 720 nm.
      <br/>
      Hence a subject matter of the invention is also the use of the rhodamine derivatives according to the invention as fluorescent dyes.
    </p>
    <p num="14">
      In order to prepare conjugates which contain the rhodamine derivatives according to the invention, activated derivatives can be synthesized which are for example suitable for labelling biomolecules or other analytical reagents.
      <br/>
      The activated derivatives are prepared by utilizing at least one of the activatable groups on the residues R1 and R2 and the activation can be carried out by known standard protocols that are known to a person skilled in the art.
      <br/>
      Usually the activation is achieved by means of at least one hydroxyl group, amino or carboxyl group of R1 and R2.
    </p>
    <p num="15">
      Various reactive groups can be introduced depending on the later application.
      <br/>
      Phosphoramidites and H phosphonates can for example be derived from a hydroxyl group.
      <br/>
      Hence rhodamine phosphoramidites or H-phosphonates are usually prepared by previously known protocols (Methods in Mol.Biol.Vol 20, "Protocols for Oligonucleotides and Analogs, Synthesis and Properties", S. Agrawal publisher Humana Press Totowa, N.J.).
    </p>
    <p num="16">
      In contrast, N-hydroxy-succinimide (NHS) esters and maleinimide alkylamides are usually derived from a carboxyl group.
      <br/>
      NHS esters are preferably prepared by the process described in EP 0 543 333 in which the free carboxylic acid is reacted with NHS in the presence of a condensation reagent such as DCC or MEI.
      <br/>
      Rhodamine isothiocyanates are preferably prepared by reacting amino groups with thiophosgene (Advanced Organic Chemistry, McGraw Hill, 2nd edition, p. 383, 1997).
    </p>
    <p num="17">
      Hence the invention also concerns activated derivatives of the rhodamines according to the invention.
      <br/>
      The reactive groups of the activated derivatives are preferably phosphoramidite, N-hydroxy-succinimide (NHS) ester, maleinimide alkylamide, H-phosphonate or isothiocyanate.
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      The invention additionally concerns conjugates which are obtainable by binding rhodamine compounds according to the invention or their activated derivatives.
      <br/>
      Consequently such conjugates are composed of at least two components, of which one component represents a rhodamine derivative according to the invention.
      <br/>
      The conjugates are prepared by standard protocols starting from the activated derivatives.
      <br/>
      The conjugation methods that are suitable in each case are known to a person skilled in the art.
    </p>
    <p num="19">The conjugates according to the invention can be used for analytical purposes as soon as a second component of the conjugate can bind to a binding partner to be determined and, after excitation with light of a suitable absorption wavelength, the complex that is formed is detected by means of the emitted fluorescence of the formed complex.</p>
    <p num="20">
      The conjugates according to the invention are particularly suitable for analyses for diagnostic purposes or for analyses of medical or biological material.
      <br/>
      Hence a subject matter of the invention are especially those conjugates which can interact with a biomolecule.
      <br/>
      These are usually conjugates that usually themselves contain one or several biomolecules as an additional component.
    </p>
    <p num="21">
      These biomolecules contained in the conjugates can for example be single-stranded or double-stranded nucleic acids such as DNA, RNA, oligonucleotides and oligonucleotide derivatives and modified nucleic acid analogues such as e.g. PNA, but also individual nucleotides, nucleotide derivatives, nucleotide analogues or nucleoside triphosphates.
      <br/>
      Such molecules are labelled at the 5' position preferably by means of an NHS ester or a phosphoramidite or, in contrast, they are labelled at the 3' position preferably by means of a dye-substituted carrier material such as CPG.
      <br/>
      Labelling at other sites such as the nucleic acid bases is also preferably carried out by means of an NHS ester.
    </p>
    <p num="22">
      When labelling proteins, protein complexes, antibodies or amino acids it is preferable to carry out the conjugation via isothiocyanate.
      <br/>
      Examples of other conjugate components are vitamins, steroid hormones, lipid molecules and haptens.
      <br/>
      Furthermore it is also possible to correspondingly label more complex biological structures such as membrane fractions or whole cells.
    </p>
    <p num="23">
      Oligonucleotides that are conjugated with a rhodamine derivative according to the invention represent a special embodiment of the conjugates according to the invention.
      <br/>
      Oligonucleotides labelled in this manner can be used in previously known methods to detect and analyse nucleic acids such as by in situ hybridization (Meyne and Myzis, Methods Mol.Biol. 33, 63-74, 1994) or also as primers in various sequencing methods (Sheealy et al., Anal.Chem. 67, 247-251, 1995).
    </p>
    <p num="24">
      In addition to nucleic acid labelling by chemical synthesis, substrates for nucleic acid polymerases labelled with rhodamine dyes according to the invention such as ribonucleoside triphosphates or deoxyribo-nucleoside triphosphates can be incorporated into nucleic acids by various enzymatic reactions.
      <br/>
      This is achieved for DNA with the aid of DNA polymerases for example using the method of nick translation (Rigby et al., J.Mol.Biol. 113, p. 237, 1977) or by random primed labelling (Feinberg and Vogelstein, Anal.Biochem. 137, p. 266, 1984).
      <br/>
      In the case of RNA this is achieved for example by T3, T7 or SP6 RNA polymerases in the sense of a transcription.
      <br/>
      An additional method for labelling nucleic acids is via a so-called "3' tailing reaction" with the aid of terminal transferase.
    </p>
    <p num="25">Hence a subject matter of the invention is also the use of conjugates according to the invention to label nucleic acids by chemical or enzymatic methods and the use of hybridization probes labelled according to the invention for the detection and analysis of nucleic acids.</p>
    <p num="26">
      For an analytical test the rhodamine derivative according to the invention is firstly excited with light of a suitable wavelength using for example lasers, laser diodes or LEDs as a light source.
      <br/>
      The fluorescence is detected by measuring methods that are known to a person skilled in the art depending on the analyte.
      <br/>
      Examples are fluorescence microscopy for in situ methods or the detection of the emitted radiation by suitable photodiodes.
    </p>
    <p num="27">
      As an alternative to the direct excitation of the dye according to the invention with radiation energy of a suitable wavelength, the excitation can also be achieved by a so-called fluorescence resonance energy transfer.
      <br/>
      In this technique a second fluorescent dye such as fluorescein is excited with light of a suitable wavelength.
      <br/>
      Subsequently a so-called non-radiative i.e. radiationless energy transfer onto the rhodamine derivative according to the invention occurs due to the spatial proximity of the two dyes (Van der Meer et al., Resonance Energy Transfer, VCH, 1994).
      <br/>
      Detection of the light emitted from this molecule at a particular wavelength can be preferably used to quantitatively determine the analyte.
      <br/>
      Hence the invention also concerns the use of a rhodamine derivative according to the invention or of a corresponding conjugate as a component of a fluorescence resonance energy transfer system.
    </p>
    <p num="28">In this method the compounds according to the invention preferably serve as resonance energy acceptors in which case compounds with the following structural formulae have proven to be particularly suitable:  (Chemical Structure image '3' not included in text)</p>
    <p num="29">
      Preferred resonance energy donors for all compounds according to the invention, especially JA 270 and JF9, are fluorescein or fluorescein conjugates.
      <br/>
      Hence the invention also concerns the use of rhodamine derivatives according to the invention or of corresponding conjugates together with fluorescein or corresponding conjugates as a fluorescence resonance energy acceptor in a fluorescence resonance energy transfer system.
    </p>
    <p num="30">
      Hybridization probes such as oligonucleotides labelled with fluorescent dyes that can be detected using the principle of fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) are suitable for the quantitative detection of nucleic acids.
      <br/>
      For example in the case of oligonucleotides the 5' end can be labelled with a dye component of the FRET system and the 3' end can be labelled with the other dye component of the FRET system.
      <br/>
      In alternative embodiments the oligonucleotides can also be internally labelled.
    </p>
    <p num="31">
      In a certain embodiment such an oligonucleotide labelled with two dyes is used during a nucleic acid amplification to detect the products that are formed by determining the emission of the fluorescence resonance energy donor.
      <br/>
      If the oligonucleotide is not bound to the target, no fluorescence of the donor resulting from radiation-free energy transfer is measurable.
      <br/>
      However, if the oligonucleotide binds to the target DNA, the two dye components are spatially separated from one another as a result of exonuclease activities of the DNA polymerase that is used so that it is possible to measure a fluorescence of the FRET donor (U.S. Pat. No. 5,210,015).
    </p>
    <p num="32">
      In preferred embodiments the different dyes are located on two different hybridization probes which can hybridize in spatial proximity to the target nucleic acid.
      <br/>
      These can for example be two oligonucleotide probes which hybridize to the same strand of the target nucleic acid in which case one dye is located on the 3'-terminal nucleotide of the first probe and the other dye is located on the 5'-terminal nucleotide of the second probe so that the distance between the two is only a low number of nucleotides and this number can be between 0 and 30.
      <br/>
      When using fluorescein in combination with a rhodamine derivative according to the invention such as JA 270 or JF9, distances of 0-15 and in particular of 1-5 nucleotides and in many cases of 1 nucleotide have proven to be advantageous.
      <br/>
      If the nucleotide distances between the dye components are adhered to, it is also possible to use probes that are not terminally but rather internally conjugated with one of the dyes.
      <br/>
      In the case of double-stranded target nucleic acids it is also possible to use probes that bind to different strands of the target provided a certain nucleotide spacing of 0 to 30 nucleotides between the two dye components is adhered to.
    </p>
    <p num="33">
      Hence a further subject matter of the invention is the use of a conjugate according to the invention composed of an oligonucleotide and a rhodamine derivative according to the invention such as JA 270 or JF9 to analyse nucleic acids wherein an additional conjugate composed of a second oligonucleotide and another fluorescent dye, preferably fluorescein, is used and after exciting a dye which is preferably coupled to the second oligonucleotide, a fluorescence resonance energy transfer can take place.
      <br/>
      Correspondingly labelled oligonucleotide combinations are named FRET pairs in the following.
    </p>
    <p num="34">
      The use of such FRET pairs has proven to be particularly advantageous for the detection of amplification products during or after a polymerase chain reaction.
      <br/>
      Hence the invention additionally concerns the use of a conjugate according to the invention as a component of a FRET pair to detect reaction products of a nucleic acid amplification reaction.
      <br/>
      In a particular embodiment one of the two amplification primers can at the same time be labelled with one of the two dyes that are used and thus contributes one of the two components of the FRET.
    </p>
    <p num="35">
      The use of suitable FRET pairs to detect the amplification products enables a so-called real time monitoring of PCR reactions in which data on the generation of the amplification product can be determined in relation to the number of reaction cycles that have occurred.
      <br/>
      This is usually achieved by the fact that the oligonucleotides of the FRET pair also hybridize to the target nucleic acid as a result of the reaction and temperature conditions during the necessary annealing of the amplification primers and when suitably excited, a corresponding measurable fluorescence signal is emitted.
      <br/>
      Hence the data obtained allow the amount of the originally used target nucleic acid to be determined quantitatively.
      <br/>
      Hence such embodiments are particularly significant for quantitative RT-PCR experiments in which RNA concentrations of a biological sample are quantified.
      <br/>
      Hence the invention also concerns the use of conjugates according to the invention as a component of a FRET pair to detect reaction products of a nucleic acid amplification reaction in which the reaction product is detected in each cycle.
      <br/>
      A further subject matter of the invention is the use of conjugates according to the invention as a component of a FRET pair to carry out a quantitative determination of the nucleic acid to be amplified.
    </p>
    <p num="36">
      In another embodiment the amplification product is detected after completion of the amplification reaction in which, after hybridization of the FRET pair to the target nucleic acid to be detected, the temperature is in turn continuously increased as part of a melting curve analysis.
      <br/>
      At the same time the emitted fluorescence is determined in relation to the temperature.
      <br/>
      In this manner sequences are detected which hybridize less stringently to the FRET pair due to certain mismatches.
      <br/>
      The melting points determined in this manner thus serve to detect point mutations or other polymorphisms.
      <br/>
      Hence the invention also concerns the use of conjugates according to the invention as a component of a FRET pair to determine melting curves especially when identifying polymorphisms and point mutations.

      <br/>
      Afterwards the cDNA was denatured for 30 sec at 95 (degree)  C. (temperature ramp 20 (degree)  C./s, no measurement).
      <br/>
      Then the cDNA was amplified for 45 cycles with the aid of a polymerase chain reaction (PCR).
      <br/>
      In the first step of the PCR the template was denatured for 1 sec at 99 (degree)  C. (temperature ramp 20 (degree)  C./s, no measurement).
      <br/>
      In the second step of the PCR the specific forward and reverse primers as well as the two TNF-alpha(wt)-specific hybridization probes hybridized to the template within 15 sec. at 50 (degree)  C. so that a FRET effect was detectable.
      <br/>
      The resulting fluorescence was measured at the end of the annealing time in each capillary according to the manufacturer's instructions (temperature ramp 20 (degree)  C./s, single measurement).
      <br/>
      In the third step the polymerization was carried out within 18 sec at 72 (degree)  C. (temperature ramp 20 (degree)  C./s, no measurement).
      <br/>
      After 45 cycles of the PCR reaction, the capillaries were cooled for 45 sec. to 40 (degree)  C.

    <p num="106">
      An oligonucleotide labelled at the 5' end by the method described in example 3 was used as part of a FRET pair for the detection of the point mutation G to A at nucleotide position 1691 in exon 10 of the human factor V gene (Bertina et al., Nature 369, p. 64, 1994).
      <br/>
      For this a specific genomic factor V fragment was amplified with the aid of a PCR amplification reaction in a LightCycler (Nittwer et al., BioTechniques 12, 176-181, 1997).
      <br/>
      The PCR mixture (20  MU l) contained 50 mM Tris, pH 8.3, 3 mM MgCl2, 250  MU g/ml BSA, 200  MU M dATP, 200  MU M dGTP, 200  MU M dCTP, 600  MU M dUTP, 0.2  MU M forward primer (nucleotide position 1626-1647 from exon 10), 0.2  MU M reverse primer (nucleotide position 127-146 from intron 10), 0.1  MU M 3'-fluorescein-labelled hybridization probe (nucleotide position 1684-1701 from exon 10+1-5 from intron 10), 0.5  MU M hybridization probe 5' labelled according to the invention with JA270 (nucleotide position 1647-1682, exon 10) and 1.6 U Taq polymerase.
      <br/>
      In addition either 1 ng factor V wild-type plasmid DNA, 1 ng heterozygote plasmid DNA or 1 ng homozygote mutant plasmid DNA was present in the three mixtures.
      <br/>
      The 3' labelled probe hybridizing to the mutation site was completely complementary to the wild-type DNA sequence.
    </p>
    <p num="107">
      The second 5' labelled probe according to the invention hybridizes upstream of the 3' labelled probe so that both labels were only separated by one base and a resonance energy transfer could take place.
      <br/>
      During the melting curve that was carried out after the amplification reaction the shorter 3' labelled probe melted at first so that a resonance energy transfer was no longer possible.

      Denaturation, amplification and subsequent melting curve were carried out in the LightCycler under the following conditions:

      In the case of the factor V wild-type plasmid DNA the melting point was 68 (degree)  C., it was 60 (degree)  C. for homozygous mutant factor V plasmid DNA and 60 (degree)  C. and 68 (degree)  C. for heterozygous factor V plasmid DNA.
