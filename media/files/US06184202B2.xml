    <p num="4">Description of the Related Art</p>
    <p num="5">
      Cell death is an important aspect during the embryonic or post-natal development of major organ systems.
      <br/>
      Apoptosis, or programmed cell demise, also plays a critical role in maintaining homeostasis in many adult tissues.
      <br/>
      Within vertebrates, bcl-2 is the best understood gene in a cell death pathway and functions as a cell death repressor.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      Apoptosis is a term used to refer to the process(es) of programmed cell death and has been described in several cell types (Waring et al. (1991) Med. Res. Rev. 11: 219; Williams G T (1991) Cell 65: 1097; Williams G T (1992) Trends Cell Biol. 2: 263; Yonisch-Rouach et al. (1991) Nature 352: 345).
      <br/>
      Apoptosis is likely involved in controlling the amount and distribution of certain differentiated cell types, such as lymphocytes and other cells of the hematopoietic lineage.
      <br/>
      The mechanism(s) by which apoptosis is produced in cells is incompletely understood, as are the regulatory pathways by which the induction of apoptosis occurs.
    </p>
    <p num="7">Apoptosis Mechanism(s)</p>
    <p num="8">
      Apoptosis was first described as a morphologic pattern of cell death characterized by cell shrinkage, membrane blebbing and chromatin condensation culminating in cell fragmentation (Kerr et al., 1972).
      <br/>
      One hallmark pattern early in the process of cell death is internucleosomal DNA cleavage (Wyllie, 1980).
      <br/>
      The death-sparing effecte; of interrupting RNA and protein synthesis and the stereotyped patterns of cell death during development were consistent with a cell autonomous genetic program for cell death (Wyllie et al. (1980) Int. Rev. Cytol. 68: 251; Sulston, J. and Horvitz, H. (1977) Develop.
      <br/>
      Biol. 56: 110; Abrams et al. (1993) Development 117: 29).
      <br/>
      The isolation of mutants defective for developmental cell death in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans supported this view (Ellis, H. and Horvitz, H. (1986) Cell 44: 817; Hengartner et al. (1992) Nature 356: 494).
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      The consistency of the morphologic and biochemical patterns defined as apoptosis within different cell types and species, during normal development and as a response to external stimuli are consistent with a common cause of cellular mortality.
      <br/>
      This thesis is supported by the concept of an endogenous program responsible for cell death and the presence of gene products which are positive and negative regulators of apoptosis.
      <br/>
      The best studied negative regulator of apoptosis is the bcl-2 proto-oncogene product.
      <br/>
      It provides the strongest evidence for a shared mammalian pathway of death by its ability to block a wide variety of cell death models.
    </p>
    <p num="10">bcl-2</p>
    <p num="11">
      The protein encoded by the bcl-2 proto-oncogene has been reported to be capable of inhibiting apoptosis in many hematopoietic cell systems;. The proto-oncogene bcl-2 was isolated and characterized as a result of its frequent translocation adjacent to the immunoglobulin heavy chain enhancer in the t(14;18) chromosome translocation present in more than 80% of human follicular lymphomas (Tsugimoto et al. (1985) Science; Chen-Levy et al. (1989) Mol. Cell. Biol. 9: 701; Cleary et al. (1986) Cell 47: 19).
      <br/>
      These neoplasias are characterized by an accumulation of mature resting B cells presumed to result from a block of apoptosis which would normally cause turnover of these cells.
      <br/>
      Transgenic mice expressing bcl-2 under the control of the E MU  enhancer similarly develop follicular lymphomas which have a high incidence of developing into malignant lymphomas (Hockenbery et al. (1990) Nature 348: 334; McDonnell T J and Korsmeyer S J (1991) Nature 349: 254; Strasser et al. (1991) Cell 67: 889).
    </p>
    <p num="12">
      The bcl-2 protein is a 25 kD membrane-associated cytoplasmic protein (Tsujimoto et al. (1987) Oncogene 2: 3; U.S Pat. Nos. 5,202,429 and 5,015,568; Chen-Levy (1989) op.cit; Hockenbery (1990) op.cit).
      <br/>
      Unlike many other proto-oncogene products, the bcl-2 protein apparently functions, at least in part, by enhancing the survival of hematopoietic cells of T and B origins rather than by directly promoting proliferation of these cell types (Vaux et al. (1988) Nature 335: 440; Tsujimoto Y (1989) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. (U.S.A.) 86: 1958; Tsujimoto Y (1989) Oncogene 4: 1331; Reed et al. (1989) Oncogene 4: 1123; Nunez et al. (1989) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. (U.S.A.) 86: 4589; Nunez et al. (1990) J. Immunol. 144: 3602; Reed et al. (1990) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. (U.S.A.) 87: 3660; Alnemri et al. (1992) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. (U.S.A.) 89: 7295).
      <br/>
      The capacity of bcl-2 to enhance cell survival is related to its ability to inhibit apoptosis initiated by several factors, such as cytokine deprivation, radiation exposure, glucocorticoid treatment, and administration of anti-CD-3 antibody (Nunez et al. (1990) op.cit; Hockenbery et al. (1990) op.cit; Vaux et al. (1988) op.cit; Alnemri et al. (1992) Cancer Res. 52: 491; Sentman et al. (1991) Cell 67: 879; Strasser et al. (1991) op.cit).
      <br/>
      Upregulation of bcl-2 expression also inhibits apoptosis of EBV-infected B-cell lines (Henderson et al. (1991) Cell 65: 1107).
      <br/>
      The expression of bcl-2 has also been shown to block apoptosis resulting from expression of the positive cell growth regulatory proto-oncogene, c-myc, in the absence of serum or growth factors (Wagner et al (1993) Mol. Cell. Biol. 13: 2432).
      <br/>
      However, the precise mechanism(s) by which bcl-2 is able to inhibit apoptosis is not yet fully defined.
    </p>
    <p num="13">
      The bcl-2 proto-oncogene is rather unique among cellular genes in its ability to block apoptotic deaths in multiple contexts (Korsmeyer, S. (1992) Blood 80: 879).
      <br/>
      Overexpression of bcl-2 in transgenic models leads to accumulation of cells due to evasion of normal cell death mechanisms (McDonnell et al. (1989) Cell 57: 79).
      <br/>
      Induction of apoptosis by diverse. stimuli, such as radiation, hyperthermia, growth factor withdrawal, glucocorticoids and multiple classes of chemotherapeutic agents is inhibited by bcl-2 in in vitro models (Vaux et al. (1988) Nature 335: 440; Tsujimoto, Y. (1989) Oncogene 4: 1331; Nunez et al. (1990) J.Immunol. 144: 3602; Hockenbery et al. (1990) Nature 348: 334; Sentman et al. (1991) Cell 67: 879; Walton et al. (1993) Cancer Res. 53: 1853; Miyashita T and Reed J (1993) Blood 81: 151).
      <br/>
      These effects are proportional to the level of bcl-2 expression.
      <br/>
      Additionally, the endogenous pattern of bcl-2 expression is highly suggestive of a role in the regulation of cell survival in vivo (Hockenbery et al. (1991) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 88: 6961; LeBrun et al. (1993) Am. J. Pathol. 142: 743).
      <br/>
      The bcl-2 protein seems likely to function as an antagonist of a central mechanism operative in cell death.
    </p>
    <p num="14">
      bcl-2 is unique among protooncogenes by being localized to the mitochondrial membrane as defined by Hockenbery, D. M., Nunez, G., Milliman, C., Schreiber, R. D. and Korsmeyer, S. J. "bcl-2 is an inner mitochondrial membrane protein that blocks programmed cell death." Nature 378, 334-336, 1990. bcl-2 has been shown to have the onclogenic function of blocking programmed cell death whereas a deregulated bcl-2 extends the survival of certain hematopoietic cell lines following growth factor deprivation.
      <br/>
      When pro-B-cell or promyelocyte cell lines are deprived of interleukin 3 they normally succumb to a programmed demise entitled apoptosis.
      <br/>
      This pattern of morphologic cell death is characterized by a dramatic plasma membrane blebbing, cell volume contraction, nuclear pyknosis, and internucleosomal DNA degradation following the activation of an endonuclease.
      <br/>
      Over expression of mitochondrial bcl-2 appears to function as an antidote to this process and has the unique function of blocking programmed cell death independent of promoting proliferation.
    </p>
    <p num="15">
      The bcl-2 protooncogene was discovered at the chromosomal breakpoint of the t(14;18) (q32;q21) which is the cytogenetic hallmark of human follicular lymphoma.
      <br/>
      Approximately 85% of follicular and 20% of diffuse B-cell lymphomas possess this translocation.
      <br/>
      Follicular lymphoma is often present as a low-grade malignancy composed of small resting IgM/IgD B cells.
      <br/>
      Over time, conversion to a more aggressive high-grade lymphoma with a diffuse large-cell architecture frequently occurs.
    </p>
    <p num="16">
      Studies of bcl-2 emphasizes the existence of multiple pathways in the generation of neoplasia.
      <br/>
      The increased cell number in neoplastic tissue can be viewed as a violation of normal homeostasis.
      <br/>
      The maintenance of homeostasis in normal tissue, in many respects, reflects a simple balanced equation of input (cellular proliferation and renewal) versus output (cell death).
      <br/>
      This is most easily envisioned for encapsulated organs, such as the prostate, but is also true of the recirculating hematopoietic lineages.
      <br/>
      The maintenance of remarkably invariant cell numbers reflects tightly regulated death pathways as well as controlled proliferation.
      <br/>

      Programmed cell death represents a cell autonomous suicide pathway that helps restrict cell numbers.
      <br/>
      The well-defined loss of specific cells is crucial during embryonic development as part of organogenesis.

      In mature tissues, genetically programmed demise regulates the volume of cells.
      <br/>
      A morphologically distinct and temporally regulated cell death entitled apoptosis has been identified by Wyllie A H: "Apoptosis; Cell death in tissue regulation". (1987) J. Pathol 153: 313.

      Cells dying by apoptosis display marked plasma membrane blebbing, volume contraction, nuclear condensation, and the activation of an endonuclease that cleaves DNA into nucleosomal length fragments.

      A molecular consequence of the translation is the movement of the bcl-2 gene to the der(14) chromosome placing bcl-2 in the same transcriptional orientation as the Ig heavy chain locus giving rise to chimeric RNAs.
      <br/>
      However, translocation does not interrupt the protein encoding region so that normal and translocated alleles produce the same sized, 25-Kd protein.

      Such lines were examined to determine if bcl-2 would spare the need for a specific ligand/receptor interaction.

      However, no long-term growth factor-independent cell lines emerged after overexpression of bcl-2 in IL-2, IL-3, IL-4, or IL-6 requiring lines.

      However, bcl-2 conferred a death-sparing effect to certain hematopoietic cell lines after growth factor withdrawal in the IL-3-dependent early hematopoietic cell lines FDCP1, FL5.12, and 32D.
      <br/>
      This effect was not restricted to the IL-3/IL-3 receptor signal transduction pathway in that granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and IL-4 deprived cells displayed a similar response.
      <br/>
      Yet, bcl-2 enhanced cell survival was not universal, as neither IL-2-dependent T-cell lines nor an IL-6-dependent myeloma line showed a consistent effect upon factor withdrawal.

    <p num="24">
      Many pathological conditions result, at least in part, from aberrant control of cell proliferation, differentiation, and/or apoptosis.
      <br/>
      For example, neoplasia is characterized by a clonally derived cell population which has a diminished capacity for responding to normal cell proliferation control signals.
      <br/>
      Oncogenic transformation of cells leads to a number of changes in cellular metabolism, physiology, and morphology.
      <br/>
      One characteristic alteration of oncogenically transformed cells is a loss of responsiveness to constraints on cell proliferation and differentiation normally imposed by the appropriate expression of cell growth regulatory genes.
      <br/>
      Neurodegenerative diseases (e.g., amyotrophic lateral sclerosis) and HIV-1 pathogenesis have been associated with free radical formation and toxicity, and apoptotic events may be involved in their disease etiologies (Meyaard et al. (1992) Science 257: 217).
    </p>
    <p num="25">
      The precise molecular pathways and secondary changes leading to malignant transformation for many cell types are not clear.
      <br/>
      However, the characteristic translocation of the apoptosis-associated bcl-2 gene to the immunoglobulin heavy chain locus t(14;18) in more than 80 percent of human follicular B cell lymphomas and 20 percent of diffuse lymphomas and the neoplastic follicular lymphoproliferation present in transgenic mice expressing high levels of bcl-2 indicates that the bcl-2 gene likely is causally involved in neoplastic diseases and other pathological conditions resulting from abnormal cell proliferation, differentiatiLon, and/or apoptosis.
      <br/>
      Thus, it would be desirable to identify agents which can modify the activity(ies) of the bcl-2 protein so as to modulate cell proliferation, differentiation, and/or apoptosis for therapeutic or prophylactic benefit.
      <br/>
      Further, such agents can serve as commercial research reagents for control of cell proliferation, differentiation, and/or apoptosis in experimental applications, and/or for controlled proliferation and differentiation of predetermined hematopoiet,ic stem cell or neuronal cell populations in vitro, in ex vivo therapy, or in vivo.

      Despite progress in developing a more defined model of the molecular mechanisms underlying the transformed phenotype and apoptosis, few significant therapeutic methods applicable to treating cancer beyond conventional chemotherapy have resulted.

    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="27">
      The present invention relates to the unexpected discovery that bcl-2 interacts with other proteins and in particular with an associated 21 kD protein called Bax.
      <br/>
      Bax shares extensive amino acid homology with bcl-2 focused within highly conserved domains I and II.
      <br/>
      It has been unexpectedly discovered that Bax homodimerizes and forms heterodimers with bcl-2 in vivo.
      <br/>
      It has also been discovered that overexpressed Bax accelerates apoptotic death induced by cytokine deprivation in an IL-3 dependent cell line and that overexpressed Bax also counters the death repressor activity of bcl-2.
      <br/>
      This discovery provides a model in which the ratio of bcl-2/Bax determines cell survival or death following an apoptotic stimulus.
    </p>
    <p num="28">Accordingly, one embodiment of the invention involves the formation of a purified and isolated bcl-2 associated protein (Bax) and fragments thereof having the amino acid sequence of Domain I or II of FIG. 7 �SEQ ID NOS:8-11�.</p>
    <p num="29">Another embodiment involves the formation of bcl-2 and Bax mutants wherein the native protein or fragment has at least one amino acid deleted or replaced by another amino acid and the mutants exhibits altered biological activity from the native protein or fragment.</p>
    <p num="30">Another embodiment involves an associated protein, which comprises Bax protein coupled with bcl-2 associated protein or fragments thereof.</p>
    <p num="31">A further embodiment involves a polynucleotide (e.g., a DNA isolate) consisting essentially of a genomic DNA sequence encoding human Bax and more particularly a composition consisting of cDNA molecules which encode the Bax protein.</p>
    <p num="32">
      In one aspect of the invention, Bax polypeptides and compositions thereof are provided.
      <br/>
      Bax polypeptides comprise polypeptide sequences which are substantially identical to a sequence shown in FIGS. 3 �SEQ ID NOS:2-3�, 5 �SEQ ID NO:5� or 6 �SEQ ID NO:7�. In one embodiment, the Bax polypeptide comprises domain I and/or domain II of the Bax polypeptide sequence, and preferably comprises the amino acid sequence(s) -W-G-R- and/or -Q-D-Q, and may be a cyclic polypeptide in some embodiments.
    </p>
    <p num="33">A further aspect involves a composition of  ALPHA RNA,  BETA RNA and/or  GAMMA RNA which encode a 21 kD, 24 kD or 4 kD Bax protein as well as cell lines producing such RNA species.</p>
    <p num="34">Another aspect of the invention involves Bax pharmaceutical compositions, which contain pharmaceutically effective amounts of a Bax polypeptide and a suitable pharmaceutical carrier.</p>
    <p num="35">
      Polynucleotide sequences encoding Bax polypeptides are also provided.

      FIG. 29C shows that the BH1 domain of bcl-xL is required for heterodimerization with Bax. Cell lysates were prepared from (35 S) labeled FL5.12 stably transfected clones expressing bcl-xL wt or a hemagglutinin tagged mutant with the WAR sequence (HA-bcl-xL mI-3). Immunoprecipitations were performed with the anti-Bax 4D2 mAb, an anti-bcl-x hetero-Ab ( ALPHA  bcl-x) or the anti-HA epitope specific mAb, 12CA5 (Kolodziej et al. (1991) Meth. Enzymol. 194: 508).

      FIG. 29D shows that the BH1 domain of bcl-xL is required for heterodimerization with Bax. Cell lysates were prepared from (35 S) labeled FL5.12 (Parent) cells or stably transfected clones expressing human bcl-2 (hbcl-2), bcl-xL wt or the bcl-xL mI-3 mutant. Immunoprecipitation utilized the anti-Bax 4D2 mAb or the human bcl-2-specific 6C8 mAb. Immunoprecipitations were as described. Briefly, equal amounts of cells per sample (5-10 * 106 cells) were labeled overnight with 100  MU Ci of (35 S) methionine, (35 S) cysteine (Translabel, ICN). Cell lysates were generated with 0.25% NP-40 buffer or in indicated lanes with RIPA buffer (Harlow E and Lane D, Antibodies: A Laboratorv Manual; Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press) which disrupts bcl-2/Bax and bcl-xL /Bax interactions. Immunoprecipitations were conducted using the indicated antibodies followed by Protein-A Sepharose bead capture. Immunoprecipitates were electrophoresed through 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and processed for fluorography.

      Unless defined otherwise, all technical and scientific terms used herein have the same meaning as commonly understood by one of ordinary skill in the art to which this invention belongs.
      <br/>
      Although any methods and materials similar or equivalent to those described herein can be used in the practice or testing of the present invention, the preferred methods and materials are described.
      <br/>
      For purposes of the present invention, the following terms are defined below.
    </p>
    <p num="62">
      As used herein, the twenty conventional amino acids and their abbreviations follow conventional usage (Immunology--A Synthesis, 2nd Edition, E. S. Golub and D. R. Gren, Eds., Sinauer Associates, Sunderland, Mass. (1991), which is incorporated herein by reference).
      <br/>
      Stereoisomers (e.g., D-amino acids) of the twenty conventional amino acids, unnatural amino acids such as  ALPHA , ALPHA -disubstituted amino acids, N-alkyl amino acids, lactic acid, and other unconventional amino acids may also be suitable components for polypeptides of the present invention.
      <br/>
      Examples of unconventional amino acids include: 4-hydroxyproline,  GAMMA -carboxyglutamate,  EPSILON -N,N,N-trimethyllysine,  EPSILON -N-acetyllysine, O-phosphoserine, N-acetylserine, N-formylmethionine, 3-methylhistidine, 5-hydroxylysine,  OMEGA -N-methylarginine, and other similar amino acids and imino acids (e.g., 4-hydroxyproline).
      <br/>
      In the polypeptide notation used herein, the lefthand direction is the amino terminal direction and the righthand direction is the carboxy-terminal direction, in accordance with standard usage and convention.
      <br/>
      Similarly, unless specified otherwise, the lefthand end of single-stranded polynucleotide sequences is the 5' end; the lefthand direction of double-stranded polynucleotide sequences is referred to as the 5' direction.
      <br/>
      The direction of 5' to 3' addition of nascent RNA transcripts is referred to as the transcription direction; sequence regions on the DNA strand having the same sequence as the RNA and which are 5' to the 5' end of the RNA transcript are referred to as "upstream sequences"; sequence regions on the DNA strand having the same sequence as the RNA and which are 3' to the 3' end of the RNA transcript are referred to as "downstream sequences".
    </p>
    <p num="63">
      The term "naturally-occurring" as used herein as applied to an object refers to the fact that an object can be found in nature.
      <br/>
      For example, a polypeptide or polynucleotide sequence that is present in an organism (including viruses) that can be isolated from a source in nature and which has not been intentionally modified by man in the laboratory is naturally-occurring.
      <br/>
      Generally, the term naturally-occurring refers to an object as present in a non-pathological (undiseased) individual, such as would be typical for the species.
    </p>
    <p num="64">As used herein, the term "Bax" refers to the mammalian Bax gene and mammalian Bax proteins, including the  ALPHA ,  BETA , and  GAMMA  isoforms, unless otherwise identified; human and murine Bax proteins and genes are preferred exemplifications of mammalian Bax, and in its narrowest usage Bax refers to human Bax polynucleotide and polypeptide sequences.</p>
    <p num="65">
      The term "corresponds to" is used herein to mean that a polynucleotide sequence is homologous (i.e., is identical, not strictly evolutionarily related) to all or a portion of a reference polynucleotide sequence, or that a polypeptide sequence is identical to a reference polypeptide sequence.
      <br/>
      In contradistinction, the term "complementary to" is used herein to mean that the complementary sequence is homologous to all or a portion of a reference polynucleotide sequence.
      <br/>
      For illustration, the nucleotide sequence "TATAC" corresponds to a reference sequence "TATAC" and is complementary to a reference sequence "GTATA".
    </p>
    <p num="66">
      The following terms are used to describe the sequence relationships between two or more polynucleotides: "reference sequence", "comparison window", "sequence identity", "percentage of sequence identity", and "substantial identity".
      <br/>
      A "reference sequence" is a defined sequence used as a basis for a sequence comparison; a reference sequence may be a subset of a larger sequence, for example, as a segment of a full-length cDNA or gene sequence given in a sequence listing, such as a polynucleotide sequence of FIG. 3 or FIGS. 5 and 6, or may comprise a complete cDNA or gene sequence.
      <br/>
      Generally, a reference sequence is at least 20 nucleotides in length, frequently at least 25 nucleotides in length, and often at least 50 nucleotides in length.
      <br/>
      Since two polynucleotides may each (1) comprise a sequence (i.e., a portion of the complete polynucleotide sequence) that is similar between the two polynucleotides, and (2) may further comprise a sequence that is divergent between the two polynucleotides, sequence comparisons between two (or more) polynucleotides are typically performed by comparing sequences of the two polynucleotides over a "comparison window" to identify and compare local regions of sequence similarity.
    </p>
    <p num="67">
      A "comparison window", as used herein, refers to a conceptual segment of at least 20 contiguous nucleotide positions wherein a polynucleotide sequence may be compared to a reference sequence of at least 20 contiguous nucleotides and wherein the portion of the polynucleotide sequence in the comparison window may comprise additions or deletions (i.e., gaps) of 20 percent or less as compared to the reference sequence (which does not comprise additions or deletions) for optimal alignment of the two sequences.
      <br/>
      Optimal alignment of sequences for aligning a comparison window may be conducted by the local homology algorithm of Smith and Waterman (1981) Adv. Appl. Math. 2: 482, by the homology alignment algorithm of Needleman and Wunsch (1970) J. Mol. Biol. 48: 443, by the search for similarity method of Pearson and Lipman (1988) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. (U.S.A.) 85: 2444, by computerized implementations of these algorithms (GAP, BESTFIT, FASTA, and TFASTA in the Wisconsin Genetics Software Package Release 7.0, Genetics Computer Group, 575 Science Dr., Madison, Wis.), or by inspection, and the best alignment (i.e., resulting in the highest percentage of homology over the comparison window) generated by the various methods is selected.
    </p>
    <p num="68">
      The term "sequence identity" means that two polynucleotide sequences are identical (i.e., on a nucleotide-by-nucleotide basis) over the window of comparison.
      <br/>
      The term "percentage of sequence identity" is calculated by comparing two optimally aligned sequences over the window of comparison, determining the number of positions at which the identical nucleic acid base (e.g., A, T, C, G, U, or I) occurs in both sequences to yield the number of matched positions, dividing the number of matched positions by the total number of positions in the window of comparison (i.e., the window size), and multiplying the result by 100 to yield the percentage of sequence identity.
      <br/>
      The terms "substantial identity" as used herein denotes a characteristic of a polynucleotide sequence, wherein the polynucleotide comprises a sequence that has at least 85 percent sequence identity, preferably at least 90 to 95 percent sequence identity, more usually at least 99 percent sequence identity as compared to a reference sequence over a comparison window of at least 20 nucleotide positions, frequently over a window of at least 25-50 nucleotides, wherein the percentage of sequence identity is calculated by comparing the reference sequence to the polynucleotide sequence which may include deletions or additions which total 20 percent or less of the reference sequence over the window of comparison.
      <br/>
      The reference sequence may be a subset of a larger sequence, for example, as a segment of the full-length human Bax polynucleotide sequence shown in FIG. 3 �SEQ ID NO:1� or FIGS. 5 �SEQ ID NO:4� and 6 �SEQ ID NO:6� or a segment of a human bcl-2 protein, such as a fragment spanning residues 136-155 (BH1) and/or 187-202 (BH2) �SEQ ID NO:10�.
    </p>
    <p num="69">
      As applied to polypeptides, the term "substantial identity" means that two peptide sequences, when optimally aligned, such as by the programs GAP or BESTFIT using default gap weights, share at least 80 percent sequence identity, preferably at least 90 percent sequence identity, more preferably at least 95 percent sequence identity or more (e.g., 99 percent sequence identity).
      <br/>
      Preferably, residue positions which are not identical differ by conservative amino acid substitutions.
    </p>
    <p num="70">
      Conservative amino acid substitutions refer to the interchangeability of residues having similar side chains.
      <br/>
      For example, a group of amino acids having aliphatic side chains is glycine, alanine, valine, leucine, and isoleucine; a group of amino acids having aliphatic-hydroxyl side chains is serine and threonine; a group of amino acids having amide-containing side chains is asparagine and glutamine; a group of amino acids having aromatic side chains is phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan; a group of amino acids having basic side chains is lysine, arginine, and histidine; and a group of amino acids having sulfur-containing side chains is cysteine and methionine.
      <br/>
      Preferred conservative amino acids substitution groups are: valine-leucine-isoleucine, phenylalanine-tyrosine, lysine-arginine, alanine-valine, and asparagine-glutamine.
    </p>
    <p num="71">
      The term "Bax native protein" and "full-length Bax protein" as used herein refers to a full-length Bax  ALPHA ,  BETA , or  GAMMA  isoform of 192 amino acids, 218 amino acids, or 41 amino acids as shown herein (see, FIG. 4).
      <br/>
      A preferred Bax native protein is the polypeptide corresponding to the deduced amino acid sequence shown in FIG. 3 �SEQ ID NO:5� or corresponding to the deduced amino acid sequence of a cognate full-length cDNA of another species.
      <br/>
      Also for example, a native Bax protein present in naturally-occurring lymphocytes which express the Bax gene are considered full-length Bax proteins.
    </p>
    <p num="72">
      The term "fragment" as used herein refers to a polypeptide that has an amino-terminal and/or carboxy-terminal deletion, but where the remaining amino acid sequence is identical to the corresponding positions in the sequence deduced from a full-length cDNA sequence (e.g., the cDNA sequence shown in FIG. 3 �SEQ ID NO:1�).
      <br/>
      Fragments typically are at least 14 amino acids long, preferably at least 20 amino acids long, usually at least 50 amino acids long or longer.
    </p>
    <p num="73">
      The term "analog", "mutein" or "mutant" as used herein refers to polypeptides which are comprised of a segment of at least 10 amino acids that has substantial identity to a portion of the naturally occurring protein.
      <br/>
      For example, a Bax analog comprises a segment of at least 10 amino acids that has substantial identity to a Bax protein, such as the human  ALPHA ,  BETA , or  GAMMA  isoforms; preferably the deduced amino acid sequence shown in FIG. 3 �SEQ ID NO:2� or deduced amino acid sequences shown in FIGS. 5 �SEQ ID NO:2� and 6 �SEQ ID NO:7�, and which has at least one of the following properties: binding to bcl-2 or native Bax protein under suitable binding conditions.
      <br/>
      Typically, analog polypeptides comprise a conservative amino acid substitution (or addition or deletion) with respect to the naturally-occurring sequence.
      <br/>
      Analogs typically are at least 20 amino acids long, preferably at least 50 amino acids long or longer, most usually being as long as full-length naturally-occurring protein (e.g., 192, 218, or 41 amino acid residues for human Bax  ALPHA ,  BETA , and  GAMMA , respectively).
      <br/>
      Some analogs may lack biological activity (e.g., bcl-2 binding) but may still be employed for various uses, such as for raising antibodies to Bax epitopes, as an immunological reagent to detect and/or purify  ALPHA -Bax antibodies by affinity chromatography, or as a competitive or noncompetitive agonist, antagonist, or partial agonist of native Bax protein function.
    </p>
    <p num="74">
      The term "Bax polypeptide" is used herein as a generic term to refer to native protein, fragments, or analogs of Bax.
      <br/>
      Hence, native Bax, fragments of Bax, and analogs of Bax are species of the Bax polypeptide genus.
      <br/>
      Preferred Bax polypeptides include: a murine full-length Bax protein comprising the murine polypeptide sequence shown in FIG. 3 �SEQ ID NO:3�, a full-length human Bax protein comprising the polypeptide sequence shown in FIG. 3 �SEQ ID NO:2�, polypeptides consisting essentially of the sequence of human Bax domain I or domain II, and the naturally-occurring human Bax  ALPHA ,  BETA , and  GAMMA  isoforms.
    </p>
    <p num="75">The term "bcl-2 polypeptide" is used herein as a generic term to refer to native protein, fragments, or analogs of bcl-2, preferably human or murine bcl-2, usually human bcl-2.</p>
    <p num="76">The term "bcl-xL polypeptide" is used herein as a generic term to refer to native protein, fragments, or analogs of bcl-xL, preferably human or murine bcl-xL, usually human bcl-xL.</p>
    <p num="77">
      The term "cognate" as used herein refers to a gene sequence that is evolutionarily and functionally related between species.
      <br/>
      For example but not limitation, in the human genome, the human CD4 gene is the cognate gene to the mouse CD4 gene, since the sequences and structures of these two genes indicate that they are highly homologous and both genes encode a protein which functions in signaling T cell activation through MHC class II-restricted antigen recognition.
      <br/>
      Thus, the cognate human gene to the murine Bax gene is the human gene which encodes an expressed protein which has the greatest degree of sequence identity to the murine Bax protein and which exhibits an expression pattern similar to that of the murine Bax (e.g., expressed in lymphocytes).
      <br/>
      Preferred cognate Bax genes are: rat Bax, rabbit Bax, canine Bax, nonhuman primate Bax, porcine Bax, bovine Bax, and hamster Bax.
    </p>
    <p num="78">
      The term "agent" is used herein to denote a chemical compound, a mixture of chemical compounds, a biological macromolecule, or an extract made from biological materials such as bacteria, plants, fungi, or animal (particularly mammalian) cells or tissues.
      <br/>
      Agents are evaluated for potential activity as antineoplastics or apoptosis modulators by inclusion in screening assays described hereinbelow.
      <br/>
      Agents are evaluated for potential activity as specific protein interaction inhibitors (i.e., an agent which selectively inhibits a binding interaction between two predetermined polypeptides but which does not substantially interfere with cell viability) by inclusion in screening assays described hereinbelow.
    </p>
    <p num="79">
      The term "protein interaction inhibitor" is used herein to refer to an agent which is identified by one or more screening method(s) of the invention as an agent which selectively inhibits protein--protein binding between a first interacting polypeptide and a second interacting polypeptide.
      <br/>
      Some protein interaction inhibitors may have therapeutic potential as drugs for human use and/or may serve as commercial reagents for laboratory research or bioprocess control.
      <br/>
      Protein interaction inhibitors which are candidate drugs are then tested further for activity in assays which are routinely used to predict suitability for use as human and veterinary drugs, including in vivo administration to non-human animals and often including administration to human in approved clinical trials.
    </p>
    <p num="80">The term "antineoplastic agent" is used herein to refer to agents that have the functional property of inhibiting a development or progression of a neoplasm in a human, particularly a lymphocytic leukemia, lymphoma or pre-leukemic condition.</p>
    <p num="81">
      As used herein, the terms "label" or "labeled" refers to incorporation of a detectable marker, e.g., by incorporation of a radiolabeled amino acid or attachment to a polypeptide of biotinyl moieties that can be detected by marked avidin (e.g., streptavidin containing a fluorescent marker or enzymatic activity that can be detected by optical or calorimetric methods).
      <br/>
      Various methods of labeling polypeptides and glycoproteins are known in the art and may be used.
      <br/>
      Examples of labels for polypeptides include, but are not limited to, the following: radioisotopes (e.g., 3 H, 14 C, 35 S, 125 I, 131 I), fluorescent labels (e.g., FITC, rhodamine, lanthanide phosphors), enzymatic labels (e.g., horseradish peroxidase,  BETA -galactosidase, luciferase, alkaline phosphatase), biotinyl groups, predetermined polypeptide epitopes recognized by a secondary reporter (e.g., leucine zipper pair sequences, binding sites for secondary antibodies, metal binding domains, epitope tags).
      <br/>
      In some embodiments, labels are attached by spacer arms of various lengths to reduce potential steric hindrance.
    </p>
    <p num="82">
      As used herein, "substantially pure" means an object species is the predominant species present (i.e., on a molar basis it is more abundant than any other individual macromolecular species in the composition), and preferably a substantially purified fraction is a composition wherein the object species comprises at least about 50 percent (on a molar basis) of all macromolecular species present.
      <br/>
      Generally, a substantially pure composition will comprise more than about 80 to 90 percent of all macromolecular species present in the composition.
      <br/>
      Most preferably, the object species is purified to essential homogeneity (contaminant species cannot be detected in the composition by conventional detection methods) wherein the composition consists essentially of a single macromolecular species.
      <br/>
      Solvent species, small molecules (&lt;500 Daltons), and elemental ion species are not considered macromolecular species.
    </p>
    <p num="83">
      As used herein "normal blood" or "normal human blood" refers to blood from a healthy human individual who does not have an active neoplastic disease or other disorder of lymphocytic proliferation, or an identified predisposition for developing a neoplastic disease.
      <br/>
      Similarly, "normal cells", "normal cellular sample", "normal tissue", and "normal lymph node" refers to the respective sample obtained from a healthy human individual who does not have an active neoplastic disease or other lymphoproliferative disorder.
    </p>
    <p num="84">
      As used herein the terms "pathognomonic concentration", "pathognomonic amount", and "pathognomonic staining pattern" refer to a concentration, amount, or localization pattern, respectively, of a Bax protein or mRNA in a sample, that indicates the presence of a pathological (e.g., neoplastic) condition or a predisposition to developing a neoplastic disease, such as lymphocytic leukemia.
      <br/>
      A pathognomonic amount is an amount of a Bax protein or Bax mRNA in a cell or cellular sample that falls outside the range of normal clinical values that is established by prospective and/or retrospective statistical clinical studies.
      <br/>
      Generally, an individual having a neoplastic disease (e.g., lymphocytic leukemia) will exhibit an amount of Bax protein or MRNA in a cell or tissue sample that is outside the range of concentrations that characterize normal, undiseased individuals; typically the pathognomonic concentration is at least about one standard deviation outside the mean normal value, more usually it is at least about two standard deviations or more above the mean normal value.
      <br/>
      However, essentially all clinical diagnostic tests produce some percentage of false positives and false negatives.
      <br/>
      The sensitivity and selectivity of the diagnostic assay must be sufficient to satisfy the diagnostic objective and any relevant regulatory requirements.
      <br/>
      In general, the diagnostic methods of the invention are used to identify individuals as disease candidates, providing an additional parameter in a differential diagnosis of disease made by a competent health professional.
    </p>
    <p num="85">
      As used herein the term "physiological conditions" refers to temperature, pH, ionic strength, viscosity, and like biochemical parameters which are compatible with a viable organism, and/or which typically exist intracellularly in a viable cultured yeast cell or mammalian cell.
      <br/>
      For example, the intracellular conditions in a yeast cell grown under typical laboratory culture conditions are physiological conditions.
      <br/>
      Suitable in vitro reaction conditions for in vitro transcription cocktails are generally physiological conditions.
      <br/>
      In general, in vitro physiological conditions comprise 50-200 mM NaCl or KCl, pH 6.5-8.5, 20-45 (degree)  C. and 0.01-10 mM divalent cation (e.g., Mg++, Ca++); preferably about 150 mM NaCl or KCl, pH 7.2-7.6, 5 mM divalent cation, and often include 0.01-1.0 percent nonspecific protein (e.g., BSA).
      <br/>
      Particular aqueous conditions may be selected by the practitioner according to conventional methods.
      <br/>
      For general guidance, the following buffered aqueous conditions may be applicable: 10-250 mM NaCl, 5-50 mM Tris HCl, pH 5-8, with optional addition of divalent cation(s) and/or metal chelators and/or nonionic detergents and/or membrane fractions.

    <p num="86">
      As used herein, the terms "interacting polypeptide segment" and "interacting polypeptide sequence" refer to a portion of a hybrid protein which can form a specific binding interaction with a portion of a second hybrid protein under suitable binding conditions.
      <br/>
      Generally, a portion of the first hybrid protein preferentially binds to a portion of the second hybrid protein forming a heterodimer or higher order heteromultimer comprising the first and second hybrid proteins; the binding portions of each hybrid protein are termed interacting polypeptide segments.
      <br/>
      Generally, interacting polypeptides can form heterodimers with a dissociation constant (KD) of at least about 1 * 103 M-1, usually at least 1 * 104 M-1, typically at least 1 * 105 M-1, preferably at least 1 * 106 M-1 to 1 * 107 M-1 or more, under suitable physiological conditions.

      A survey of adult tissues indicates that bcl-2 has played several roles in numerous cell lineages.
      <br/>
      Glandular epithelium that undergoes hyperplasia or involution in response to hormonal stimuli or growth factors express bcl-2.
      <br/>
      In complex epithelium, such as the skin and gut, bcl-2 is restricted to stem cells and proliferation zones.
      <br/>
      Within the adult nervous system bcl-2 is more prominent in the peripheral nervous system rather than the central nervous system.

      Bax is encoded by 6 exons and demonstrates a complex pattern of alternative RNA splicing that predicts a 21 Kd membrane ( ALPHA ) and two forms ( BETA  and  GAMMA ) of cytosolic protein.
      <br/>
      When Bax predominates, programmed cell death is accelerated and the death repressor activity of bcl-2 is countered.
    </p>
    <p num="94">
      According to the present invention a co-immunoprecipitation procedure was used to identify Bax, the novel protein associated with bcl-2.
      <br/>
      It was completely unexpected to find that Bax shared extensive homology with bcl-2, especially within two highly conserved domains.
      <br/>
      These domains are also the most highly conserved regions of human, mouse and chicken bcl-2.
      <br/>
      These domains are also conserved in an open reading frame BHRF-1 within Epstein-Barr virus and Mcl-1, a gene recently isolated from a myeloid leukemia cell line following induction with phorbol ester (Kozopas et al., 1993).
      <br/>
      Thus, a clear family of bcl-2-like genes is appearing and are likely to be sequential numbers of a single death pathway or regulators of parallel death pathways.
    </p>
    <p num="95">
      As discussed above, Bax homodimerizes or heterodimerizes with bcl-2 in vivo.
      <br/>
      While the precise multiplicity of these interactions is not fully known, conserved domains I and II are areas of dimerization motifs.
      <br/>
      Bax ALPHA  possesses a COOH-terminal hydrophobic segment predicted to be membrane spanning and has a similar secondary structure to bcl-2.
      <br/>
      Thus, the two proteins are likely to be inserted into the same membrane with an identical orientation.
      <br/>
      However, coinsertion is not required for association in that the  DELTA C22 cytosolic form of bcl-2 still coprecipitates Bax ALPHA , provided it has been solubilized from membranes.
      <br/>
      Since bcl-2  DELTA C22 partially protects cells from death, this further strengthens the importance of the bcl-2/Bax interaction.
      <br/>
      Moreover, results using FL5.12 cells indicate that Bax homodimerization is favored over heterodimerization with bcl-2.
      <br/>
      It has been found that the majority of introduced HA-Bax ALPHA  dimerizes with endogenous Bax ALPHA  rather than with the modest amounts of endogenous bcl-2 in FL5.12 cells.
      <br/>
      Overexpression of bcl-2 in these cells thus competes for Bax homodimerization and forms heterodimers with HA-Bax ALPHA  and endogenous Bax ALPHA .
    </p>
    <p num="96">
      The complexity of the RNA splicing therein proves to be an important differential regulator of Bax activity and localization.
      <br/>
      The predicted membrane a and cytosolic  BETA  forms of Bax are parallel to the  ALPHA  integral membrane form of bcl-2 and predicted  BETA  cytosolic form.
      <br/>
      The exon/intron juncture responsible for the  ALPHA  and  BETA  RNAs are evolutionarily conserved and thus the existence of 24 kD Bax BETA  protein.
      <br/>
      Consistent with this, RL-7 cells display a 24 kD protein associated with bcl-2 and possess the 1.5 kb  BETA RNA, while FL5.12 cells lack both.
      <br/>
      A cytosolic Bax BETA  could provide an additional level of regulation by homodimerizing or heterodimerizing with the integral membrane forms of Bax and bcl-2.
      <br/>
      The  GAMMA  form of Bax RNA might result in a truncated  GAMMA  protein or could represent a splicing strategy to avoid making the full length product.
    </p>
    <p num="97">
      It has been discovered that the ratio of bcl-2/Bax determines a cells susceptibility to death following an apoptotic stimulus.
      <br/>
      In the presence of IL-3 overexpressed Bax does not noticeably alter normal cell division or viability.
      <br/>
      Bax is present and associated with bcl-2 prior to growth factor deprivation.
      <br/>
      Moreover, the ratio of bcl-2/Bax within FL5.12 cells is not substantially altered 12 hrs after deprivation of IL-3.
      <br/>
      Bax RNA is expressed in normal tissues and in a variety of cell lines prior to a death induction signal.
      <br/>
      Thus, the synthesis of Bax does not appear to be a de novo response that follows a death stimulus, and Bax in itself accelerates apoptotic cell death only following a death signal, such as IL-3 deprivation.
      <br/>
      Excess Bax also counters the death repressor activity of bcl-2.
      <br/>
      When bcl-2 is in excess cells are protected.
      <br/>
      However, when Bax is in excess and Bax homodimers dominate, cells are susceptible to apoptosis.
    </p>
    <p num="98">
      It has also been discovered that a single amino acid substitution in bcl-2 eliminates bcl-2/Bax heterodimers but not bcl-2 homodimers and abolishes death repressor activity.
      <br/>
      As discussed herein, the bcl-2 proto-oncogene inhibits apoptosis induced by a variety of signals within multiple cell types.
      <br/>
      Protein mutations with as minor as a single amino acid substitution within one conserved region, domain I, of the bcl-2 molecule also eliminates its death repressor activity.
      <br/>
      Mutated bcl-2 no longer blocks cell death induced by factor deprivation, glucocorticoid treatment or gamma irradiation. bcl-2 mutations that no longer function, no longer heterodimerize with Bax, and when overexpressed accelerate programmed cell death.
      <br/>
      Mutations within domain II of bcl-2 partially disrupt its death repressor activity and correspondingly partially inhibit its heterodimerization with Bax.
      <br/>
      However, mutant bcl-2 as well as wild-type bcl-2 still effectively forms homodimers.
      <br/>
      These results document the importance of the conserved sequences especially domain I and their role in heterodimerization for bcl-2 and Bax.
      <br/>
      Such domains are also likely to be instrumental in dictating homo and heterodimerization formation in other bcl-2 family members including bcl-x, MCL-1, LMW5-HL, and BHRF1.
      <br/>
      The current data support a model in which bcl-2 functions by neutralizing a death accelerating protein Bax through heterodimerization.
      <br/>
      Therapeutic modalities which disrupt bcl-2/Bax heterodimers prove profoundly effective in promoting cell death.
    </p>
    <p num="99">
      Without wishing to be bound by any particular model, several mechanistic possibilities are believed to account for the regulatory role of this protein--protein interaction.
      <br/>
      Bax might function as a death effector molecule that is neutralized by bcl-2.
      <br/>
      In this scenario, bcl-2 might simply be an inert handcuff that disrupts the formation of Bax homodimers.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, bcl-2 could possess a biochemical function that is diametrically opposed to Bax.
      <br/>
      In contrast bcl-2 might function as a death repressor molecule that is neutralized by competition with an inert Bax molecule.
      <br/>
      Either way, the capacity of Bax and bcl-2 to compete for one another via heterodimers indicates a reciprocal relationship in which bcl-2 monomers or homodimers favor survival, and Bax homodimers favor death.
    </p>
    <p num="100">
      Mammalian cells are often dependent upon an extracellular milieu including growth and survival factors or cell--cell contact molecules.
      <br/>
      The dependence of the early hematopoietic cell line, FL5.12, upon IL-3 for its survival as well as proliferation is a typical example.
      <br/>
      However, a number of biologic systems indicate that cells within the same lineage have an inherent sensitivity or resistance to a given death stimulus.
      <br/>
      For example, CD4+ 8+ cortical thymocytes are sensitive to glucocorticoid induced apoptosis while the more mature medullary thymocytes are resistant.
      <br/>
      This differential sensitivity correlates with the presence of bcl-2 protein.
      <br/>
      The bcl-2/Bax interaction represents one such endogenous regulator of susceptibility to apoptosis.
      <br/>
      These discoveries suggest a model in which the response of a cell to a death signal is determined by a preset mechanism, such as the ratio of bcl-2/Bax.
    </p>
    <p num="101">
      Because of this interaction it is possible to use this invention for the detection and determination of Bax or bcl-2, for example in a fraction from a tissue or organ separation operation, or immunochemical technique in view of the proteins antigenic properties.

      The detection or determination of proteins favoring death repressor molecules will be beneficial in immunodeficiency disease, including HIV-I, II and III, and in neurodegenerative and ischemic cell death.

      More particularly, the protein Bax may be used for performing immunochemical methods for the detection and determination of the protein or its associated protein bcl-2, in order to monitor cell growth or to detect or monitor the course of diseases.

      It can also be used as a method for the treatment of a neurodegenerative disease, or immunodeficiency, or an ischemia induced injury such as myocardial infarction and neurologic stroke, which comprises; administering an effective amount of a compound to a patient to regulate the ratio of bcl-2 to Bax to promote the survival of cells by generating an excess of bcl-2.

      It will be understood that the precise chemical structure of Bax and bcl-2 will depend upon a number of factors.

      Referring to the Sequence Description of Bax, it should be noted that the peptide includes several potential glycosylation sites.

      Glycosylation is a process of forming a protein derivative, wherein a portion of the protein's amino acid sequence is augmented by a sugar moiety.
      <br/>
      It will therefore be understood that therapeutically useful derivatives of Bax may be prepared by addition of one or more sugar residues to the protein, or alternatively by removal of some or all of the sugar residues from the sites of glycosylation on the Bax molecule.

      For example, at least one glycine residue of Bax or bcl-2 in Domain I may be replaced with an amino acid such as alanine or glutamic acid.

      Such analogs may include one or more deletions or additions of amino acid sequence, either at the amino- or carboxy-termini, or internally, or both; analogs may further include sequence transpositions.
      <br/>
      Analogs may also comprise amino acid substitutions, preferably conservative substitutions.
      <br/>
      Additionally, analogs may include heterologous sequences generally linked at the amino- or carboxy-terminus, wherein the heterologous sequence(s) confer a functional property to the resultant analog which is not indigenous to the native Bax protein.
      <br/>
      However, Bax analogs must comprise a segment of 25 amino acids that has substantial similarity to a portion of the amino acid sequences shown in FIG. 3 �SEQ ID NO:2� or FIGS. 5 �SEQ ID NO:5� and 6 �SEQ ID NO:7� or other mammalian Bax proteins, respectively, and which has at least one of the requisite functional properties (i.e., forms heterodimers with bcl-2 and/or forms homodimers with Bax.
      <br/>
      Preferred amino acid substitutions are those which: (1) reduce susceptibility to proteolysis, (2) reduce susceptibility to oxidation, (3) alter post-translational modification of the analog, possibly including phosphorylation, and (4) confer or modify other physicochemical or functional properties of such analogs.
      <br/>
      Bax analogs include various muteins of a Bax sequence other than the naturally-occurring peptide sequence.
      <br/>
      For example, single or multiple amino acid substitutions (preferably conservative amino acid substitutions) may be made in the naturally-occurring Bax sequence (preferably in the portion of the polypeptide outside domains I and II).
    </p>
    <p num="134">
      Conservative amino acid substitution is a substitution of an amino acid by a replacement amino acid which has similar characteristics (e.g., those with acidic properties: Asp and Glu).
      <br/>
      A conservative (or synonymous) amino acid substitution should not substantially change the structural characteristics of the parent sequence (e.g., a replacement amino acid should not tend to break a helix that occurs in the parent sequence, or disrupt other types of secondary structure that characterizes the parent sequence).

      Examples of art-recognized polypeptide secondary and tertiary structures are described in Proteins, Structures and Molecular Principles, (1984) Creighton (ed.), W. H.

    <p num="136">
      Native Bax proteins, fragments thereof, or analogs thereof can be used as reagents in binding assays to detect binding to bcl-2 and or binding to Bax for identifying agents that interfere with Bax function, said agents are thereby identified as candidate drugs which may be used, for example, to block apoptosis, to induce apoptosis (e.g., to treat lymphocytic leukemias), and the like.
      <br/>
      Typically, in vitro binding assays that measure binding of Bax to bcl-2 employ native Bax ( ALPHA  or  BETA  isoform) that contains domain I and domain II.
      <br/>
      The bcl-2 (or Bax) polypeptide is typically linked to a solid substrate by any of various means known to those of skill in the art; such linkage may be noncovalent (e.g., binding to a highly charged surface such as Nylon 66) or may be by covalent bonding (e.g., typically by chemical linkage).
      <br/>
      Bax polypeptides are typically labeled by incorporation of a radiolabeled amino acid or fluorescent label.
      <br/>
      The labeled Bax polypeptide is contacted with the immobilized bcl-2 (or Bax) polypeptide under aqueous conditions that permit specific binding in control binding reactions with a binding affinity of about 1 * 105 M-1 or greater (e.g., 10-250 mM NaCl or KCl and 5-100 mM Tris HCl pH 5-9, usually pH 6-8), generally including Zn+2 and/or Mn+2 and/or Mg+2 in the nanomolar to micromolar range (1 nM to 999  MU M).
      <br/>
      Specificity of binding is typically established by adding unlabeled competitor at various concentrations selected at the discretion of the practitioner.
      <br/>
      Examples of unlabeled protein competitors include, but are not limited to, the following: unlabeled Bax polypeptide, bovine serum albumin, and cellular protein extracts.

      Binding reactions wherein one or more agents are added are performed in parallel with a control binding reaction that does not include an agent.

    <p num="142">
      In addition to Bax or bcl-2 polypeptides consisting only of naturally-occurring amino acids, Bax or bcl-2 peptidomimetics are also provided.
      <br/>
      For example, peptidomimetics of the BH1 and/or BH2 domain of bcl-2 can be suitable as drugs for inhibition of bcl-2 cell death repressor activity (i.e., to block bcl-2 function).
    </p>
    <p num="143">
      Peptide analogs are commonly used in the pharmaceutical industry as non-peptide drugs with properties analogous to those of the template peptide.
      <br/>
      These types of non-peptide compound are termed "peptide mimetics" or "peptidomimetics" (Fauchere, J. (1986) Adv. Drug Res. 15: 29; Veber and Freidinger (1985) TINS p.392; and Evans et al. (1987) J. Med. Chem 30: 1229, which are incorporated herein by reference) and are usually developed with the aid of computerized molecular modeling.
      <br/>
      Peptide mimetics that are structurally similar to therapeutically useful peptides may be used to produce an equivalent therapeutic or prophylactic effect.
      <br/>
      Generally, peptidomimetics are structurally similar to a paradigm polypeptide (i.e., a polypeptide that has a biological or pharmacological activity), such as human Bax, but have one or more peptide linkages optionally replaced by a linkage selected from the group consisting of: --CH2 NH--, --CH2 S--, --CH2 --CH2 --, --CH.dbd.CH-- (cis and trans), --COCH2 --, --CH(OH)CH2 --, and --CH2 SO--, by methods known in the art and further described in the following references: Spatola, A.

      <br/>
      A particularly preferred non-peptide linkage is --CH2 NH--. Such peptide mimetics may have significant advantages over polypeptide embodiments, including, for example: more economical production, greater chemical stability, enhanced pharmacological properties (half-life, absorption, potency, efficacy, etc.), altered specificity (e.g., a broad-spectrum of biological activities), reduced antigenicity, and others.
      <br/>
      Labeling of peptidomimetics usually involves covalent attachment of one or more labels, directly or through a spacer (e.g., an amide group), to non-interfering position(s) on the peptidomimetic that are predicted by quantitative structure-activity data and/or molecular modeling.
      <br/>
      Such non-interfering positions generally are positions that do not form direct contacts with the macromolecules(s) to which the peptidomimetic binds to produce the therapeutic effect.
      <br/>
      Derivitization (e.g., labelling) of peptidomimetics should not substantially interfere with the desired biological or pharmacological activity of the peptidomimetic.

      Systematic substitution of one or more amino acids of a consensus sequence with a D-amino acid of the same type (e.g., D-lysine in place of L-lysine) may be used to generate more stable peptides.

      For example but not for limitation, a recombinantly produced fragment of human Bax can be injected into a mouse along with an adjuvant following immunization protocols known to those of skill in the art so as to generate an immune response.
      <br/>
      Typically, approximately at least 1-50  MU g of a Bax fragment or analog is used for the initial immunization, depending upon the length of the polypeptide.
      <br/>
      Alternatively or in combination with a recombinantly produced Bax polypeptide, a chemically synthesized peptide having a Bax sequence may be used as an immunogen to raise antibodies which bind a Bax protein, such as the native human Bax polypeptide having the sequence shown essentially in FIG. 3 �SEQ ID NO:2� or the native human Bax polypeptide having the sequence shown essentially in FIGS. 5 �SEQ ID NO:5� and 6 �SEQ ID NO:7�. Immunoglobulins which bind the recombinant fragment with a binding affinity of at least 1 * 107 M-1 can be harvested from the immunized animal as an antiserum, and may be further purified by immunoaffinity chromatography or other means.
      <br/>
      Additionally, spleen cells are harvested from the immunized animal (typically rat or mouse) and fused to myeloma cells to produce a bank of antibody-secreting hybridoma cells.
      <br/>
      The bank of hybridomas can be screened for clones that secrete immunoglobulins which bind the recombinantly produced Bax polypeptide (or chemically synthesized Bax polypeptide) with an affinity of at least 1 * 106 M-1.

      Animals other than mice and rats may be used to raise antibodies; for example, goats, rabbits, sheep, and chickens may also be employed to raise antibodies reactive with a Bax protein.

      Generally such Bax peptides and the fusion protein portions consisting of bax sequences for screening antibody libraries comprise about at least 3 to 5 contiguous amino acids of Bax, frequently at least 7 contiguous amino acids of Bax, usually comprise at least 10 contiguous amino acids of Bax, and most usually comprise a Bax sequence of at least 14 contiguous amino acids as shown in FIG. 3 �SEQ ID NO:2� or FIGS. 5 �SEQ ID NO:5� and 6 �SEQ ID NO:7�. Combinatorial libraries of antibodies have been generated in bacteriophage lambda expression systems which may be screened as bacteriophage plaques or as colonies of lysogens (Huse et al.

      Bax polypeptides which are useful as immunogens, for diagnostic detection of  ALPHA -Bax antibodies in a sample, for diagnostic detection and quantitation of Bax protein in a sample (e.g., by standardized competitive ELISA), or for screening a bacteriophage antibody display library, are suitably obtained in substantially pure form, that is, typically about 50 percent (w/w) or more purity, substantially free of interfering proteins and contaminants.
      <br/>
      Preferably, these polypeptides are isolated or synthesized in a purity of at least 80 percent (w/w) and, more preferably, in at least about 95 percent (w/w) purity, being substantially free of other proteins of humans, mice, or other contaminants.

      <br/>
      More specifically, where the object is to identify immunocrossreactive polypeptides that comprise a particular structural moiety, such as a bcl-2 binding domain, it is preferable to use as an antigen a fragment corresponding to part or all of a commensurate structural domain in the Bax protein.

      The anti-Bax and anti-bcl-2 antibodies can be used to measure the corresponding protein levels (Bax or bcl-2, respectively) by various methods, including but not limited to: (1) standardized ELISA on cell extracts, (2) immunoprecipitation of cell extracts followed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the immunoprecipitated products and quantitative detection of the band(s) corresponding to Bax and/or bcl-2, and (3) in situ detection by immunohistochemical straining with the anti-Bax and/or anti-bcl-2 antibodies and detection with a labeled second antibody.
      <br/>
      The measurement of the Bax:bcl-2 ratio in a cell or cell population is informative regarding the apoptosis status of the cell or cell population.

    <p num="161">
      Disclosure of the full coding sequences for murine and human Bax shown in FIG. 3 �SEQ ID NO:1� and FIGS. 5 �SEQ ID NO:4� and 6 �SEQ ID NO:6� makes possible the construction of isolated polynucleotides that can direct the expression of Bax, fragments thereof, or analogs thereof.
      <br/>
      Further, the sequences in FIG. 3 �SEQ ID NO:1� and FIGS. 5 �SEQ ID NO:4� and 6 �SEQ ID NO:6� make possible the construction of nucleic acid hybridization probes and PCR primers that can be used to detect RNA and DNA sequences encoding Bax.

      Polynucleotides encoding full-length Bax or fragments or analogs thereof, may include sequences that facilitate transcription (expression sequences) and translation of the coding sequences, such that the encoded polypeptide product is produced.
      <br/>
      Construction of such polynucleotides is well known in the art and is described further in Maniatis et al., Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, 2nd Ed. (1989), Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y. For example, but not for limitation, such polynucleotides can include a promoter, a transcription termination site (polyadenylation site in eukaryotic expression hosts), a ribosome binding site, and, optionally, an enhancer for use in eukaryotic expression hosts, and, optionally, sequences necessary for replication of a vector.
      <br/>
      A typical eukaryotic expression cassette will include a polynucleotide sequence encoding a Bax polypeptide linked downstream (i.e., in translational reading frame orientation; polynucleotide linkage) of a promoter such as the HSV tk promoter or the pgk (phosphoglycerate kinase) promoter, optionally linked to an enhancer and a downstream polyadenylation site (e.g., an SV40 large T Ag poly A addition site).

      Preferably, these amino acid sequences occur in the given order (in the amino-terminal to carboxyterminal orientation) and may comprise other intervening and/or terminal sequences; generally such polypeptides are less than 1000 amino acids in length, more usually less than about 500 amino acids in lengths, and frequently approximately 41 to 218 amino acids in length (e.g., 192 amino acids or 218 amino acids;  ALPHA  or  BETA  human isoforms).
      <br/>
      The degeneracy of the genetic code gives a finite set of polynucleotide sequences encoding these amino acid sequences; this set of degenerate sequences may be readily generated by hand or by computer using commercially available software (Wisconsin Genetics Software Package Relaes 7.0).
      <br/>
      Isolated Bax polynucleotides generally, are less than about 100 kilobases, and typically are less than approximately 10,000 nucleotides in length.

      Additionally, where expression of a polypeptide is not desired, polynucleotides of this invention need not encode a functional protein.

      Specific hybridization is defined hereinbefore, and can be roughly summarized as the formation of hybrids between a polynucleotide of the invention (which may include substitutions, deletions, and/or additions) and a specific target polynucleotide such as murine or human Bax MRNA so that a single band corresponding to each isoform present is identified on a Northern blot of RNA prepared from Bax-expressing cells (i.e., hybridization and washing conditions can be established that permit detection of discrete Bax mRNA band(s)).

      Generally, human genomic DNA or mRNA from Bax expressing human cells (e.g., Jurkat cell line) is used as the template DNA sample for the PCR reaction.

    <p num="186">Yeast Two-Hybrid Screening Assays</p>
    <p num="187">
      An approach to identifying polypeptide sequences which bind to a predetermined polypeptide sequence has been to use a so-called "two-hybrid" system wherein the predetermined polypeptide sequence is present in a fusion protein (Chien et al. (1991) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. (USA) 88: 9578).
      <br/>
      This approach identifies protein--protein interactions in vivo through reconstitution of a transcriptional activator (Fields S and Song O (1989) Nature 340: 245), the yeast Gal4 transcription protein.
      <br/>
      Typically, the method is based on the properties of the yeast Gal4 protein, which consists of separable domains responsible for DNA-binding and transcriptional activation.
      <br/>
      Polynucleotides encoding two hybrid proteins, one consisting of the yeast Gal4 DNA-binding domain fused to a polypeptide sequence of a known protein and the other consisting of the Gal4 activation domain fused to a polypeptide sequence of a second protein, are constructed and introduced into a yeast host cell.
      <br/>
      Intermolecular binding between the two fusion proteins reconstitutes the Gal4 DNA-binding domain with the Gal4 activation domain, which leads to the transcriptional activation of a reporter gene (e.g., lacZ, HIS3) which is operably linked to a Gal4 binding site.
      <br/>
      Typically, the two-hybrid method is used to identify novel polypeptide sequences which interact with a known protein (Silver S C and Hunt S W (1993) Mol. Biol. Rep. 17: 155; Durfee et al. (1993) Genes Devel. 7; 555; Yang et al. (1992) Science 257: 680; Luban et al. (1993) Cell 73: 1067; Hardy et al. (1992) Genes Devel. 6; 801; Bartel et al. (1993) Biotechniques 14: 920; and Vojtek et al. (1993) Cell 74: 205).
      <br/>
      However, variations of the two-hybrid method have been used to identify mutations of a known protein that affect its binding to a second known protein (Li B and Fields S (1993) FASEB J. 7: 957; Lalo et al. (1993) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. (USA) 90: 5524; Jackson et al. (1993) Mol. Cell. Biol. 13; 2899; and Madura et al. (1993) J. Biol. Chem. 268: 12046).
      <br/>
      Two-hybrid systems have also been used to identify interacting structural domains of two known proteins (Bardwell et al. (1993) med. Microbiol. 8: 1177; Chakraborty et al. (1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267: 17498; Staudinger et al. (1993) J. Biol. Chem. 268: 4608; and Milne G T and Weaver D T (1993) Genes Devel. 7; 1755) or domains responsible for oligomerization of a single protein (Iwabuchi et al. (1993) Oncogene 8; 1693; Bogerd et al. (1993) J. Virol. 67: 5030).
      <br/>
      Variations of two-hybrid systems have been used to study the in vivo activity of a proteolytic enzyme (Dasmahapatra et al. (1992) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. (USA) 89: 4159).
      <br/>
      Alternatively, an E. coli/BCCP interactive screening system (Germino et al. (1993) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. (U.S.A.) 90: 933; Guarente L (1993) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. (U.S.A.) 90: 1639) can be used to identify interacting protein sequences (i.e., protein sequences which heterodimerize or form higher order heteromultimers).
    </p>
    <p num="188">
      Each of these two-hybrid methods rely upon a positive association between two Gal4 fusion proteins thereby reconstituting a functional Gal4 transcriptional activator which then induces transcription of a reporter gene operably linked to a Gal4 binding site.
      <br/>
      Transcription of the reporter gene produces a positive readout, typically manifested either (1) as an enzyme activity (e.g.,  BETA -galactosidase) that can be identified by a calorimetric enzyme assay or (2) as enhanced cell growth on a defined medium (e.g., HIS3).
      <br/>
      A positive readout condition is generally identified as one or more of the following detectable conditions: (1) an increased transcription rate of a predetermined reporter gene, (2) an increased concentration or abundance of a polypeptide product encoded by a predetermined reporter gene, typically such as an enzyme which can be readily assayed in vivo, and/or (3) a selectable or otherwise identifiable phenotypic change in an organism (e.g., yeast) harboring the reverse two-hybrid system.
      <br/>
      Generally, a selectable or otherwise identifiable phenotypic change that characterizes a positive readout condition confers upon the organism either: a selective growth advantage on a defined medium, a mating phenotype, a characteristic morphology or developmental stage, drug resistance, or a detectable enzymatic activity (e.g.,  BETA -galactosidase, luciferase, alkaline phosphatase, and the like).
    </p>
    <p num="189">
      Transcriptional activators are proteins that positively regulate the expression of specific genes.
      <br/>
      They can be functionally dissected into two structural domains: one region that binds to specific DNA sequences and thereby confers specificity, and another region termed the activation domain that binds to protein components of the basal gene expression machinery (Ma and Ptashne (1988) Cell 55: 443).
      <br/>
      These two domains need to be physically connected in order to function as a transcriptional activator.
      <br/>
      Two-hybrid systems exploit this finding by hooking up an isolated DNA binding domain to one protein (protein X), while hooking up the isolated activation domain to another protein (protein Y).
      <br/>
      When X and Y interact to a significant extent, the DNA binding and activation domains will now be connected and the transcriptional activator function reconstituted (Fields and Song (1989) Nature 340: 245).
      <br/>
      The yeast host strain is engineered so that the reconstituted transcriptional activator drives the expression of a specific reporter gene such as HIS3 or lacZ, which provides the read-out for the protein--protein interaction (Field and Song (1989) op.cit.; Chien et al. (1991) op.cit.).
      <br/>
      One advantage of two-hybrid systems for monitoring protein--protein interactions is their sensitivity in detection of physically weak, but physiologically important, protein--protein interactions.
      <br/>
      As such it offers a significant advantage over other methods for detecting protein--protein interactions (e.g., ELISA assay).
    </p>
    <p num="190">
      The invention also provides host organisms (typically unicellular organisms) which harbor a bcl-2-related protein two-hybrid system, typically in the form of polynucleotides encoding a first hybrid protein, a second hybrid protein, and a reporter gene, wherein said polynucleotide(s) are either stably replicated or introduced for transient expression.
      <br/>

      <br/>
      Such yeast are incubated with a test agent and expression of the reporter gene (e.g.,  BETA -galactosidase) is determined; the capacity of the agent to inhibit expression of the reporter gene as compared to a control culture identifies the agent as a candidate bcl-2-modulatory agent or Bax modulatory agent.

      <br/>
      Such a yeast two-hybrid system can screen for cDNAs that encode proteins which bind to Bax or bcl-2 sequences.

      Further, polypeptides that bind Bax or bcl-2 can be identified by screening a peptide library (e.g., a bacteriophage peptide display library, a spatially defined VLSIPS peptide array, and the like) with a Bax or bcl-2 polypeptide.
    </p>
    <p num="193">
      The invention also provides a kit comprising a two-hybrid system having (1) a first hybrid protein comprising a first bcl-2-related polypeptide and a transcriptional activator activation domain, (2) a second hybrid protein comprising a second bcl-2-related polypeptide and a transcriptional activator DNA-binding domain, a host cell, and an instruction manual.

    <p num="194">Antisense Polynucleotides</p>
    <p num="195">
      Additional embodiments directed to modulation of neoplasia or apoptosis include methods that employ specific antisense polynucleotides complementary to all or part of the sequences shown in FIG. 3 �SEQ ID NO:1� or FIGS. 5 �SEQ ID NO:4� and 6 �SEQ ID NO:6�. Such complementary antisense polynucleotides may include nucleotide substitutions, additions, deletions, or transpositions, so long as specific hybridization to the relevant target sequence corresponding to FIG. 3 �SEQ ID NO:1� or FIGS. 5 �SEQ ID NO:4� and 6 �SEQ ID NO:6� is retained as a functional property of the polynucleotide.
      <br/>
      Complementary antisense polynucleotides include soluble antisense RNA or DNA oligonucleotides which can hybridize specifically to Bax mRNA species and prevent transcription of the MRNA species and/or translation of the encoded polypeptide (Ching et al. (1989) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 86: 10006; Broder et al. (1990) Ann. Int. Med. 113: 604; Loreau et al. (1990) FEBS Letters 274: 53; Holcenberg et al., WO91/11535; U.S. Ser. No. 07/530,165; WO91/09865; WO91/04753; WO90/13641; and EP 386563, each of which is incorporated herein by reference).
      <br/>
      The antisense polynucleotides therefore inhibit production of Bax polypeptides.
      <br/>
      Antisense polynucleotides that prevent transcription and/or translation of mRNA corresponding to Bax polypeptides may inhibit apoptosis, senescence, AIDS, and the like, and/or reverse the transformed phenotype of cells.
      <br/>
      Antisense polynucleotides of various lengths may be produced, although such antisense polynucleotides typically comprise a sequence of about at least 25 consecutive nucleotides which are substantially identical to a naturally-occurring Bax polynucleotide sequence, and typically which are identical to a sequence shown in FIG. 3 �SEQ ID NO:1� or FIGS. 5 �SEQ ID NO:4� or 6 �SEQ ID NO:6�.
    </p>
    <p num="196">
      Antisense polynucleotides may be produced from a heterologous expression cassette in a transfectant cell or transgenic cell, such as a transgenic pluripotent hematopoietic stem cell used to reconstitute all or part of the hematopoietic stem cell population of an individual.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, the antisense polynucleotides may comprise soluble oligonucleotides that are administered to the external milieu, either in the culture medium in vitro or in the circulatory system or interstitial fluid in vivo.
      <br/>
      Soluble antisense polynucleotides present in the external milieu have been shown to gain access to the cytoplasm and inhibit translation of specific mRNA species.
      <br/>
      In some embodiments the antisense polynucleotides comprise methylphosphonate moieties.

      <br/>
      Homologous targeting can be used to generate so-called "knockout" mice, which are heterozygous or homozygous for an inactivated Bax allele.

      Additionally, a Bax cDNA or genomic gene copy (or minigene) may be used to construct transgenes for expressing Bax polypeptides at high levels and/or under the transcriptional control of transcription control sequences which do not naturally occur adjacent to the Bax gene.

      For example but not limitation, a constitutive promoter (e.g., a CMV or pgk promoter) or a cell-lineage specific transcriptional regulatory sequence (e.g., an LCK or immunoglobulin gene promoter/enhancer) have been operably linked to a Bax-encoding polynucleotide sequence to form a transgene.
      <br/>
      Such transgenes can be introduced into cells (e.g., fertilized eggs, ES cells, hematopoietic stem cells) and transgenic cells and transgenic nonhuman animals may be obtained according to conventional methods.

    <p num="201">Identification and Isolation of Proteins that Bind Bax</p>
    <p num="202">
      Proteins that bind to Bax and/or a Bax/bcl-2 complex are potentially important regulatory proteins.
      <br/>
      Such proteins may be targets for novel antineoplastic agents and other novel drugs.
      <br/>
      These proteins are referred to herein as accessory proteins.
      <br/>
      Accessory proteins may be isolated by various methods known in the art.
    </p>
    <p num="203">
      One preferred method of isolating accessory proteins is by contacting a Bax polypeptide in a cell extract to an antibody that binds the Bax polypeptide, and isolating resultant immune complexes.
      <br/>
      These immune complexes may contain accessory proteins bound to the Bax polypeptide.
      <br/>
      The accessory proteins may be identified and isolated by denaturing the immune complexes with a denaturing agent and, preferably, a reducing agent.
      <br/>
      The denatured, and preferably reduced, proteins can be electrophoresed on a polyacrylamide gel.
      <br/>
      Putative accessory proteins can be identified on the polyacrylamide gel by one or more of various well known methods (e.g., coomassie staining, Western blotting, silver staining, etc.), and isolated by resection of a portion of the polyacrylamide gel containing the relevant identified polypeptide and elution of the polypeptide from the gel portion.
    </p>
    <p num="204">Another method is to employ bcl-2 polypeptides comprising a BH1 and/or BH2 domain.</p>
    <p num="205">
      Yeast two-hybrid systems wherein on GAL4 fusion protein comprises a Bax polypeptide sequence, typically a full-length of near full-length Bax polypeptide sequence (e.g., the sequence of FIG. 3 �SEQ ID NO:1�), and the other GAL4 fusion protein comprises a cDNA library member can be used to identify cDNAs encoding Bax-interacting proteins, according to the general method of Chien et al. (1991) on.cit. Alternatively, an E. coli/BCCP interactive screening system (Germino et al. (1993) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. (U.S.A.) 90: 1639, incorporated herein by reference) can be used to identify Bax-interacting protein sequences.
      <br/>
      Also, an expression library, such as  LAMBDA gt11 cDNA expression library (Dunn et al. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264: 13057), can be screened with a labelled Bax polypeptide to identify cDNAs encoding polypeptides which specifically bind Bax.
      <br/>
      For these procedures, cDNA libraries usually comprise mammalian cDNA populations, typically human, mouse, or rat, and may represent cDNA produced from RNA and one cell type, tissue, or organ and one or more developmental stage.
      <br/>
      Specific binding for screening cDNA expression libraries is usually provided by including one or more blocking agent (e.g., albumin, nonfat dry milk solids, etc.) prior to and/or concomitant with contacting the labeled Bax polypeptide (and/or labeled anti-Bax antibody).
    </p>
    <p num="206">
      A putative accessory protein may be identified as an accessory protein by demonstration that the protein binds to Bax and/or a Bax/bcl-2 complex.
      <br/>
      Such binding may be shown in vitro by various means, including, but not limited to, binding assays employing a putative accessory protein that has been renatured subsequent to isolation by a polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis method.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, binding assays employing recombinant or chemically synthesized putative accessory protein may be used.
      <br/>
      For example, a putative accessory protein may be isolated and all or part of its amino acid sequence determined by chemical sequencing, such as Edman degradation.
      <br/>
      The amino acid sequence information may be used to chemically synthesize the putative accessory protein.
      <br/>
      The amino acid sequence may also be used to produce a recombinant putative accessory protein by: (1) isolating a cDNA clone encoding the putative accessory protein by screening a cDNA library with degenerate oligonucleotide probes according to the amino acid sequence data, (2) expressing the cDNA in a host cell, and (3) isolating the putative accessory protein.
    </p>
    <p num="207">
      Putative accessory proteins that bind Bax and/or Bax/bcl-2 complex in vitro are identified as accessory proteins.
      <br/>
      Accessory proteins may also be identified by crosslinking in vivo with bifunctional crosslinking reagents (e.g., dimethylsuberimidate, glutaraldehyde, etc.) and subsequent isolation of crosslinked products that include a Bax polypeptide.
      <br/>
      For a general discussion of cross-linking, see Kunkel et al. (1981) Mol. Cell. Biochem. 34:3. Preferably, the bifunctional crosslinking reagent will produce crosslinks which may be reversed under specific conditions after isolation of the crosslinked complex so as to facilitate isolation of the accessory protein from the Bax polypeptide.
      <br/>
      Isolation of crosslinked complexes that include a Bax polypeptide is preferably accomplished by binding an antibody that binds a Bax polypeptide with an affinity of at least 1 * 107 M-1 to a population of crosslinked complexes and recovering only those complexes that bind to the antibody with an affinity of at least 1 * 107 M-1.

      In one embodiment, human genomic DNA samples from a population of individuals (typically at least 50 persons from various racial origins) are individually aliquoted into reaction vessels (e.g., a well on a microtitre plate).

      <br/>
      The substantially purified Bax/bcl-2 heterodimers and the identification of Bax as a docking partner for bcl-2 as provided herein permits production of substantially pure Bax/bcl-2 polypeptide complexes and computational models which can be used for protein X-ray crystallography or other structure analysis methods, such as the DOCK program (Kuntz et al (1982) J.

      Standard techniques of molecular cloning were used as described, unless indicated otherwise.
      <br/>
      Restriction enzymes were from Boehringer Mannheim Biochemicals and New England Biolabs.
      <br/>
      The 712 bp PCR cDNA (FIG. 3 �SEQ ID NO:1�, bps 142-212) was radiolabeled by PCR and used to screen an Epstein-Barr virus transformed human mature B cell (Namalwa) cDNA library (Ambrus et al., 1993) in lambda-ZAI II (supplied by Stratagene) by standard hybridization and washing at 2 * SSC/0.1% SDS, 50 (degree)  C. Three independent positive clones were in vivo excised and sequenced.
      <br/>
      The longest of the sequenced inserts (820 bp) served as a probe to further screen the Namalwa human cDNA library, a human t(17;19) ALL early B cell (UOC-B1) cDNA library in lambda-ZAP II (Inaba et al., 1992) or an oligo(T) primed, size selected murine 70Z/3 pre- BETA  cell cDNA library in lambda gt11 (Ben-Neriah, 1986).
      <br/>
      Several additional human and murine cDNA clones were obtained, subcloned, and sequenced.
      <br/>
      The final Bax sequences were determined on both strands.
    </p>
    <p num="236">
      For genomic screenings, a 129 SV murine genomic library in lambda FIX II (obtained from Stratagene), was screened with a full length murine Bax cDNA clone.
      <br/>
      The plaque purified genomic clones, that reacted with probes for the 5' and 3' end of the cDNA, were selected.
      <br/>
      The insert of phage clone F1, that possesses the entire 5' through 3' ends of the cDNA sequence, was subcloned into Bluescript.
      <br/>
      Exon positions were placed by restriction analysis and DNA sequencing defined the exon/intron boundaries.

    <p num="238">
      Poly (A+) RNA from RL-7 and FL5.12 cells was prepared, electrophoresed in a denaturing 1.2% agarose-formaldehyde gel, and transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane.

      Filters were hybridized with various probes, and washed by standard protocol.
      <br/>
      However, for the exon 2 specific probe, the high stringency wash was in 2 * SSC/0.1% SDS at 50 (degree)  C.

    <p num="239">H) Epitope Tagging and Expression Vector Construction</p>
    <p num="240">
      An eleven amino acid tag, that contained a well characterized epitope of the influenza virus hemagglutinin (HA) protein was attached to the N-terminus of murine Bax ALPHA  (HA-Bax ALPHA ) by a three step PCR approach (Kolodziej and Young, 1991).
      <br/>
      In the first, second and third rounds of PCR, the ends of the Bax ALPHA  ORF was stepwise extended by using 24-26 bp primers in which the N-terminus possessed the epitope and the consensus translation start site (Kozak, 1986), while the C-terminus had a stop codon.
      <br/>
      In addition, an EcoRI site was also incorporated into each primer used in the third round of amplification.
      <br/>
      The PCR mixture contained 20 pmol of each primer, 50 ng of cDNA, 2 mM of each dNTP, 10 mM Tris.HCL (pH:8.3), 50 mM KCl, 1.5 mM MgCl2, and 2.5 units of Thermus aquatics (Taq) DNA polymerase.
      <br/>
      Amplification of the target DNAs through 38 cycles were: denaturation, 94 (degree)  C. for 1'. (first cycle 4'.); annealing, 60 (degree)  C., 1'. (first cycle 52 (degree)  C.); extension, 72 (degree)  C., 1'. (last cycle 10') PCR products were purified and either used as template for the next round of amplification or directly ligated into a PCR cloning vector (TA cloning system by InVitrogen).
      <br/>
      The authenticity of the PCR reactions were confirmed by sequencing.
      <br/>
      The inserts were excised by EcoRI digestion, cloned into the EcoRI cloning site of SFFV-LTR-Neo expression vector (Fuhlbrigge et al, 1988) and transformed into competent XL-1 Blue cells (Strategene).
      <br/>
      Doubly CsCl purified and linearized sense-orientation plasmid constructs were transfected into FL5.12 cells by electroporation (200V, 900 mF) with a BTX 300 transfector.
      <br/>
      Cells were recovered in nonselective media for 24-48 hours, after which stably transfected cells were selected for neomycin resistance in 2 mg/ml G418 (supplied by Gibco), or for hygromycin resistance with 2 mg/ml hygromycin (supplied by Calbiochem), by plating 4-12 * 104 cells into 0.2 ml wells.
      <br/>
      Surviving clones were expanded and screened for the expression level of HA-Bax ALPHA  and endogenous murine or transfected human bcl-2 protein, by solubilization and immunoblotting of equal amount of total protein.
      <br/>
      High or low HA-Bax ALPHA  and/or human bcl-2 expressing clones were selected for subsequent analysis.

    <p num="241">I) Growth Factor Deprivation Studies</p>
    <p num="242">
      To assess the effect of Bax ALPHA  on cell survival, stably transfected cells were seeded at a concentration of 2 * 105 cells/ml in the presence of IL-3 for 24 hrs.

      Cells were washed thoroughly 3 *  in the serum free medium to remove the growth factor, and cultured at 5 * 105 cells/ml in triplicate.

      Viabilities were determined at various time points by trypan blue exclusion counting at least 100 cells from each individual culture.

    <p num="244">This Example demonstrates the co-precipitation of bcl-2 with a 21 kD protein.</p>
    <p num="245">
      Co-immunoprecipitation experiments were performed utilizing the 6C8 monoclonal antibody (moAb) that is specific for human bcl-2, and RL-7, a human B cell line which bears the t(14;18) translocation and expresses high levels of bcl-2.
      <br/>
      A variety of detergent conditions were tested to identify bcl-2 associated proteins.
      <br/>
      When RL-7 cells were metabolically labeled with 35 S-methionine, lysed and solubilized with 0.2% NP-40, an abundant 21 kD protein (p21) co-precipitated with bcl-2.
      <br/>
      A lesser amount of a 24 kD species was also detected (FIG. 1).
    </p>
    <p num="246">
      In FIG. 1 cell lysates of (35 S)methionine-labeled RL-7 cells were immunoprecipitated with an anti human bcl-2 moAb in the presence (+) or absence (-) of competitor cold lysate and washed as indicated above each lane.
      <br/>
      When immunoprecipitates were washed in isotonic lysis solution the association remained intact.
      <br/>
      However, the addition of 0.1% SDS to the wash eliminated p21, indicating that p21 was a non-covalently associated protein rather than a bcl-2 degradation product.
    </p>
    <p num="247">In the presence of excess cold RL-7 cell lysate radiolabeled p21 still co-precipitated with bcl-2 indicating that this was not a non-physiological association following cell lysis.</p>
    <p num="248">
      To confirm a specific interaction between bcl-2 and p21, an interleukin-3 (IL-3) dependent murine cell line, FL5.12 was examined.
      <br/>
      In the absence of IL-3, FL5.12 dies by apoptosis, but overexpression of bcl-2 extends it survival.
    </p>
    <p num="249">
      Stable transfectants of FL5.12 expressing wild type human bcl-2 (FL5.12 hbcl-2) or a human bcl-2 construct that lacks the COOH-terminal signal-anchor sequence ( DELTA  C-22) were generated.
      <br/>
      The bcl-2  DELTA  C-22 protein is no longer an integral membrane protein, yet it still provides partial protection from cell death.
      <br/>
      Immunoprecipitation of human bcl-2 with the species specific 6C8 moAb revealed an associated murine p21 protein in FL5.12 hbcl-2 cells (FIG. 2).
      <br/>
      In FIG. 2 cell lysates of (35 S)methionine-labeled FL5.12 clones transfected with vector only (Neor), with wild type human bcl-2 (bcl-2), or a deletion mutant lacking the signal-anchor sequence of human bcl-2 ( DELTA  C-22), were immunoprecipitated with an anti-human bcl-2 moAb (6C8) or control antibody (NS).
      <br/>
      The immunoprecipitates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE.
      <br/>
      The p21 molecule was not detected when FL5.12 cells transfected with only a NeoR vector were immunoprecipitated with 6C8.
      <br/>
      Similarly, an isotype matched control antibody, TN3 19.12 (NS) did not recognize the p21 molecule in FL5.12-hbcl-2 cells.
      <br/>
      The A C-22 cytosolic form of bcl-2 also co-precipitated mouse p21 from 0.2% NP-40 lysates, even though somewhat less efficiently.
      <br/>
      These findings demonstrate the specificity and the conservation of the interaction between p21 and bcl-2 across species.
      <br/>
      For this reason we refer to p21 as Bax (ie. bcl-2 Associated X protein).

      Consequently internal peptide fragments were generated by V8 protease, cyanogen bromide (CNBr), or CNBr followed by O-phthaldehyde in situ digestions.
      <br/>
      Peptide fragments were sequenced by Edman degradation and 2 overlapping internal fragments provided 29 amino acids of human or murine sequences (FIG. 3 �SEQ ID NOS:2 and 3�).

      Hygromycin resistant clones were selected and assessed for the expression of hbcl-2 with the 6C8 moAb and for levels of HA-Bax ALPHA  with the 12CA5 moAb (FIGS. 9B, C).

      Densitometry estimates of the relative amounts of the two proteins within these cells revealed a relative ratio of hbcl-2/HA-Bax ALPHA  of 2.04 for CL 16-5, 1.65 for CL 23-5, and 0.55 for Clone 16-8.
      <br/>
      The time course of apoptotic death following IL-3 deprivation was compared in these clones and in FL5.12 cells possessing only NeoR control vector or only hbcl-2 (FIG. 9A).
      <br/>
      The addition of hbcl-2 partially countered the Bax accelerated cell death.
      <br/>
      In multiple experiments the rate of cell death paralleled the ratios of hbcl-2/HA-Bax ALPHA .
      <br/>
      Clones 16-5 and 23-5 of the double transfected clones demonstrated no death at 24 hrs whereas the NeoR control line was only 43% viable by this time.
      <br/>
      Clone 16-8 with the lowest hbcl-2/HABax ALPHA  ratio was 73% viable at 24 hours but lost all viability by day 7.
      <br/>
      Clones 16-5 and 23-5 with high hbcl-2/HA-Bax ALPHA  ratios possessed viable cells over two weeks following IL-3 deprivation.
      <br/>
      Despite comparable levels of bcl-2, Clone 16-5 and Clone 23-5 never approached the viability observed for the clone which only expressed hbcl-2 (FIG. 9a).
      <br/>
      Thus the presence of Bax also counters the death-repressor activity of bcl-2.

      The site-specific mutagenesis work of bcl-2 and its implications for protein--protein interaction and definitively regulating a decisional step in the commitment to death has also been unexpectedly discovered.
      <br/>
      This is more particularly described in the following figures.
    </p>
    <p num="291">
      In FIG. 14, the cloning of the Bax cDNA established a family of bcl-2 closely related genes which were most highly conserved within segments known as domain I �SEQ ID NOS:32-36� and domain II �SEQ ID NOS:37-41�. It is now clear that this is an even wider family of molecules that includes Bcl-x, MCL-1 and two DNA virus proteins, LMW5-HL as well as BHRF-1 of the Epstein Barr Virus.
      <br/>
      As can be seen the homologies within these sets of proteins are focused within domain I and II.
      <br/>
      Particularly dramatic is the middle segment of domain I of FIG. 7 �SEQ ID NOS:32-36�, NWGR which is conserved all the way to the Epstein Barr virus protein retaining the GR motif.
      <br/>
      The demonstration of the capacity of Bax and bcl-2 to interact both in vivo and in vitro strongly indicates that these other bcl-2 related proteins will also be involved in homodimerization and heterodimerization with different members of this family.
      <br/>
      Thus, all manipulations of domain I and domain II which are shown to affect the bcl-2/Bax interaction and physiologic functions are equally applicable to all of the family members denoted.

      As indicated the levels of the mutation products are comparable to that of the wild-type bcl-2 clones.

      FIG. 16 is an IL-3 deprivation time course of the stable transfects of FL5.12. It demonstrates that wild-type bcl-2 saves FL5.12 cells from programmed cell death when compared to a control that has received a neomycin resistance expression vector only.
      <br/>
      Importantly, mutations in domain I that eliminate either the FRDG sequence or the WGR sequence essentially eliminate the capacity of the bcl-2 product to repress death.
      <br/>
      The rate of death returns to the same time course of the Neo control clone.
      <br/>
      Also noted is that a single amino acid alteration through the WGR sequence with a substitution of either an alanine in mI-3 or a glutamic acid within mI-4 for the glycine in the WGR sequence completely eliminates the capacity of bcl-2 to repress cell death.
      <br/>
      In fact those clones show an acceleration of death compared to the control.

      The M3 and M5 mutations had no effects upon the cell death pattern of either FL5.12 or 2B4. Thus, not all conserved amino acids within domain II mediate any functional difference in the bcl-2 molecule.
      <br/>
      However, mutations of the QDN in the M2 set of mutants do disturb bcl-2 function.
      <br/>
      However, the whole QDN has to be eliminated in that the single substitution of M4 is not sufficient for an effect.

      Panels B and D are the primary immunoprecipitants of these mutated molecules.

      They prove that the M2 mutations which partially destroy bcl-2 function have a reduced association with Bax.

      However the M4 mutations which function normally has a full association with Bax.

      Both the wild-type human bcl-2 as well as the two mutants mI 3-4 and mI 4-7 both associate with the wild-type mouse bcl-2.

      Moreover, cross linking experiments indicate the capacity of bcl-2 to homodimerize as well as heterodimerize.

      In one variation, the host cell is a yeast cell and the Bax and/or bcl-2 polypeptide is expressed as a fusion protein; one embodiment of this variation employs a yeast two-hybrid expression system.

    <p num="314">The invention provides antibodies, both monoclonal antibodies and polyclonal antisera, which specifically bind to a Bax polypeptide with an affinity of about at least 1 * 107 M-1, typically at least 1 * 108 M-1 or more.</p>

      It may also be used in any therapy which disrupts the bcl-2/Bax heterodimerization which would lead to the death of cells by the elimination of bcl-2 death repressor activity.

      This would include random screens of chemicals, compounds that would be able to do that, as well as peptides which would lead through molecular modeling to organic chemicals that would also disrupt this association.

    <p num="316">
      In this regard, the invention provides screening assays for identifying agents which modulate (e.g., inhibit) binding of a Bax polypeptide to a bcl-2 polypeptide and/or which modulate (e.g., inhibit) binding of a Bax polypeptide to a Bax polypeptide.
      <br/>
      The compositions of such screening assays generally comprise a Bax polypeptide and a bcl-2 polypeptide in a suitable aqueous binding solution or in a cell (e.g., a yeast or mammalian cell, a bacterium, a plant cell); the Bax and bcl-2 polypeptides generally comprise a domain I sequence and/or a domain II sequence.
      <br/>
      An agent is added to such a screening assay and the formation of Bax/bcl-2 heteromultimers (heterodimers) is determined; agents which reduce or argument the formation of Bax/bcl-2 heteromultimers as compared to a parallel control Bax/bcl-2 binding reaction lacking the agent are thereby identified as Bax/bcl-2 modulators. optionally, or alternatively, the capacity of an agent to inhibit or argument formation of bcl-2/bcl-2 homomultimers (homodimers) and/or Bax/Bax homomultimers (homodimers) can be measured relative to a control binding reaction lacking the agent; such assays identify bcl-2 modulators and/or Bax modulators.
      <br/>
      Agents which selectively or preferentially inhibit Bax/bcl-2 heteromultimer (homodimer) formation as compared to Bax/Bax or bcl-2/bcl-2 homomultimer (homodimer) formation can be identified by the assays.
    </p>
    <p num="317">
      In another aspect, candidate agents are identified by their ability to block the binding of a Bax polypeptide to a bcl-2 polypeptide.
      <br/>
      The Bax polypeptide includes one or more bcl-2 binding sites at which a bcl-2 protein specifically binds.
      <br/>
      One means for detecting binding of a Bax polypeptide to a bcl-2 polypeptide is to immobilize one of the polypeptide species, such as by covalent or noncovalent chemical linkage to a solid support, and to contact the immobilized Bax (or bcl-2) polypeptide with a bcl-2 (or Bax) polypeptide that has been labeled with a detectable marker (e.g., by incorporation of radiolabeled amino acid).
      <br/>
      Such contacting is typically performed in aqueous conditions which permit binding of a Bax (or bcl-2) polypeptide to a bcl-2 (or Bax) polypeptide containing a binding sequence, such as domain I or domain II.
      <br/>
      Binding of the labeled Bax (or bcl-2) to the immobilized bcl-2 (or Bax) is measured by determining the extent to which the labeled polypeptide is immobilized as a result of a specific binding interaction.
      <br/>
      Such specific binding may be reversible, or may be optionally irreversible if a cross-linking agent is added in appropriate experimental conditions.

    <p num="318">In a variation of the invention, polynucleotides of the invention are employed for diagnosis of pathological conditions or genetic disease that involve neoplasia or abnormal apoptosis, and more specifically conditions and diseases that involve alterations in the structure or abundance of Bax.</p>
    <p num="319">
      The invention also provides Bax polynucleotide probes for diagnosis of pathological conditions (e.g., neoplasia, AIDS, hyperplasia, congenital genetic diseases) by detection of Bax mRNA or rearrangements or amplification of the Bax gene in cells explanted from a patient, or detection of a pathognomonic Bax allele (e.g., by RFLP or allele-specific PCR analysis), Typically, the detection will be by in situ hybridization using a labeled (e.g., 32 P, 35 S, 14 C, 3 H, fluorescent, biotinylated, digoxigeninylated) Bax polynucleotide, although Northern blotting, dot blotting, or solution hybridization on bulk RNA or poly A+ RNA isolated from a cell sample may be used, as may PCR amplification using Bax-specific primers.
      <br/>
      Cells which contain an increased or decreased amount or altered structure of Bax mRNA as compared to cells of the same cell type(s) obtained from a normal undiseased control source will be identified as candidate pathological cells.
      <br/>
      Similarly, the detection of pathognomonic rearrangements or amplification of the Bax locus or closely linked loci in a cell sample will identify the presence of a pathological condition or a predisposition to developing a pathological condition (e.g., cancer, genetic disease) and may be used for forensic identification of individual identity and paternity.

      The characteristics of the cloned sequences are given, including the nucleotide and predicted amino acid sequence in FIGS. 3, 5 and 6.
      <br/>
      Polynucleotides comprising sequences encoding these amino acid sequences can serve as templates for the recombinant expression of quantities of Bax polypeptides, such as human Bax and murine Bax.
      <br/>
      Polynucleotides comprising such sequences can also serve as probes for nucleic acid hybridization to detect the transcription and mRNA abundance of Bax mRNA in individual lymphocytes (or other cell types) by in situ hybridization, and in specific lymphocyte populations by Northern blot analysis and/or by in situ hybridization (Alwine et al. (1977) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 74: 5350) and/or PCR amplification and/or LCR detection.
      <br/>
      Such recombinant polypeptides and nucleic acid hybridization probes can be used in conjunction with in vitro screening methods for pharmaceutical agents (e.g., antineoplastic agents, immunomodulators) and for diagnosis and treatment of neoplastic or preneoplastic pathological conditions, genetic diseases, and other pathological conditions.

      bcl-2 was isolated from the t(14;18) chromosomal breakpoint in follicular B cell lymphoma (Tsujimoto et al. (1985) Science 229:1390-1393; Bakhski et al. (1985) Cell 41:899-906; Cleary &amp; Sklar (1985) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 82:7439-7443). bcl-2 has the novel oncogenic role of extending cell survival by inhibiting a variety of apoptotic deaths (Vaux et al. (1988) Nature 335:440-442; McDonnell et al. (1989) Cell 57:79-88; Hockenbery et al. (1990) Nature 348:334-336; Nunez et al. (1990) J. Immunol. 144:3602-3610; Sentman et al. (1991) J. Cell 67:879-888; Strasser et al.

      <br/>
      An emerging family of bcl-2 related proteins share two highly conserved regions (Oltvai et al. (1993) Cell 74:609-619; Boise et al. (1993) Cell 74:597-608; Kozopas et al. (1993) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 90:3516-3520; Lin et al. (1993) J. Immunol. 151:1979-1988; Neilan et al. (1993) J. Virol. 67:4391-4394; Baer et al. (1984) Nature 310:207-211; Williams and Smith (1993) Cell 74:777-779) referred to here as bcl-2 homology 1 and 2 (BH1 and BH2) domains (FIG. 1).
      <br/>
      This includes Bax which heterodimerizes with bcl-2 and when overexpressed counteracts bcl-2 (Oltvai et al. (1993) Cell 74:609-619).
      <br/>
      Therefore, BH1 and BH2 might represent domains which participate in function or protein interactions.
      <br/>
      We performed site specific mutagenesis of bcl-2 which established the two domains as novel dimerization motifs.
      <br/>
      Substitution of gly145 in BH1 domain or trp188 in BH2 domain completely abrogated bcl-2's death repressor activity in IL-3 deprivation,  GAMMA -irradiation, and glucocorticoid induced apoptosis.
      <br/>
      Mutations that affected bcl-2's function also disrupted its heterodimerization with Bax, yet still permitted bcl-2 homodimerization.
      <br/>
      These results establish a functional role for the BH1 and BH2 domains and indicate bcl-2 exerts its action through heterodimerization with Bax.
    </p>
    <p num="326">
      The most highly conserved domains in the bcl-2 family, BH1 and BH2 are separated by approximately 30 amino acids (FIGS. 22a-c�SEQ ID NO:52-59, SEQ ID NO:65-72�).
      <br/>
      Mutagenesis of the most conserved amino acids in both domains was undertaken (FIGS. 22b,c) �residued 3-15 of SEQ ID NOS:42-46, and SEQ ID NOS:73-78, respectively�. Mutant bcl-2 proteins were expressed in a murine IL-3 dependent cell line, FL5.12 and the glucocorticoid sensitive murine T cell hybridoma, 2B4 (Nunez et al. (1990) J. Immunol. 144:3602-3610; Ucker et al. (1989) J. Immunol. 143:3461-3469).
      <br/>
      Clones stably expressing comparable levels of bcl-2 mutant (mI, mII) or wild-type (wt) protein were selected by flow cytometry (FIG. 22d) and Western blot analysis (FIG. 22e).
    </p>
    <p num="327">
      FL5.12 clones possessing wt or mutant bcl-2 were assessed in a cell death assay following IL-3 deprivation.
      <br/>
      Within BH1 domain, alanine replacement of FRDG (mI-1) or WGR (mI-2) markedly decreased the death repressor activity of bcl-2 in each of 3 clones tested (FIG. 23a).
      <br/>
      Clones bearing mutant proteins revealed a morphologic death of apoptosis with oligosomal-length DNA fragmentation and DNA release (FIG. 23b) (Wyllie et al. (1980) Rev. Cytol. 68:251-307).
    </p>
    <p num="328">
      The frequent structural importance of glycine residues (Creighton (1984) in Proteins, Structures and Molecular Principles, Chap. 1, 5, &amp; 6. (W. H. Freeman and Comp., New York)) prompted the single amino acid substitution of gly145 with alanine (mI-3).
      <br/>
      All five mI-3 clones tested lacked death repressor activity (FIGS. 23a,b). of note this same glycine position was found to be changed to a glutamic acid in the gain of function mutation in ced-9 (Hengartner and Horovitz (1994) submitted). ced-9 is the bcl-2 homolog (cognate gene) in C. elegans (Hengartner and Horvitz (1994) Cell).
      <br/>
      Consequently, the same glutamic acid substitution was created in bcl-2 (mI-4), but proved to be loss of function when assessed in mammalian cells (FIGS. 23a,b).
      <br/>
      To assess whether these subtle modifications would eliminate bcl-2 activity in other death pathways, constructs were introduced into 2B4 cells.
      <br/>
      Neither mI-3 or mI-4 bcl-2 proteins could block glucocorticoid induced (FIG. 23c) or  GAMMA -irradiation induced cell death.
      <br/>
      All clones of each series of mutants died with similar kinetics, and mI-4 mutants displayed somewhat increased death compared to control cells (Neo) (FIG. 23).
    </p>
    <p num="329">
      Within the BH2 domain the trp residue (trp188 in bcl-2) is universally present in all family members (FIG. 22c).
      <br/>
      Replacement of this amino acid with alanine (mII-1) abrogated bcl-2's ability to protect FL5.12 cells when IL-3 was withdrawn (FIG. 23d).
      <br/>
      The QDN190-192 motif and glu200 are conserved in many family members. clones expressing Bcl-2 with substitutions at these positions (mII-2 and mII-5, respectively) displayed approximately half of the death-repressor activity of wild-type bcl-2.
      <br/>
      However, a single amino acid substitution of alanine for asn192 (mII-4) had no effect on bcl-2's death repressor activity (FIG. 23d).
      <br/>
      A bcl-2 mutant (mII-3) which deleted the conserved GWDA194-197 motif also completely eliminated bcl-2's ability to block apoptosis.
      <br/>
      However, the level of mII-3 protein was consistently lower than that of bcl-2 wt, suggesting that this mutation may also have affected protein stability.
      <br/>
      Consistent with the results in FL5.12 cells, the mII-1 bcl-2 protein also failed to protect 2B4 cells from dexamethasone or  GAMMA -irradiation induced death, while the mII-2 protein again displayed approximately half the activity of wild-type bcl-2.
    </p>
    <p num="330">
      Since Bax counters bcl-2 activity and forms heterodimers with bcl-2 (Oltvai et al. (1993) Cell 74:609-619) we examined each bcl-2 mutant for association with Bax.
      <br/>
      Immunoprecipitation of human bcl-2 wt protein with the 6C8 MAb (Hockenbery et al. (1990) Nature 348:334-336) co-precipitated murine Bax from FL5.12 cells (FIG. 24).
      <br/>
      However, all mutants which eliminated bcl-2's death repressor activity failed to interact with Bax.
      <br/>
      This includes the single substitutions of gly145 or trp188 (FIGS. 24a,b).
      <br/>
      In addition, mII-3 bcl-2 protein which eliminated the GWDA motif, while present in lower amounts, also failed to associate with Bax.
      <br/>
      The relationship of heterodimerization and function was further strengthened by examination of the mII-2 and mII-5 bcl-2 proteins.
      <br/>
      They displayed decreased death repressor activity and also demonstrated a diminished interaction with Bax.
      <br/>
      In contrast, mII-4 protein which fully protected cells from death interacted with Bax to a similar extent as bcl-2 wt (FIG. 24b).
      <br/>
      This series of bcl-2 mutants expressed in 2B4 cells showed the same pattern of heterodimerization.
      <br/>
      Thus, the same amino acids required for bcl-2 function were also needed for heterodimerization with Bax.
    </p>
    <p num="331">
      To determine whether bcl-2 could form homodimers and if the same mutations would affect its homodimerization, three approaches were taken.
      <br/>
      First, lysates from cells expressing human bcl-2 wt were treated with the crosslinking agent, DSP (Lomant and Fairbanks (1976) J. Mol. Biol. 104:243-261).
      <br/>
      Following polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis Western blots were immunostained with the 6C8 MAb revealing 25 Kd monomeric bcl-2 as well as complexes at 46 Kd and 50 Kd, the predicted size of bcl-2/Bax heterodimers and bcl-2 homodimers, respectively (FIG. 24a).
      <br/>
      Second, wild-type human bcl-2 bearing an epitope of the influenza virus hemagglutinin (Oltvai et al. (1993) Cell 74:609-619) (HA-Bcl-2) was introduced into FL5.12 cells expressing human Bcl-2 wt, or mutant proteins.
      <br/>
      The HA-specific MAb (12CA5) co-precipitated the 25 Kd bcl-2 wt and 21 Kd Bax along with the 27 Kd HA-Bcl-2 molecule, indicating the presence of bcl-2 homodimers (FIGS. 25b and 25c).
      <br/>
      Moreover, BH1 mutants (mI-3 and mI-4) and BH2 mutants (mII-1 and mII-2) which affected heterodimerization still demonstrated association with HA-Bcl-2 indicating that these mutations had not disrupted bcl-2 homodimerization.
      <br/>
      Western blots of these immunoprecipitates immunostained with biotinylated anti-human bcl-2 mAb (6C8) confirmed that equivalent amounts of human origin bcl-2 wt or mutant protein were co-precipitated (FIG. 25d).
      <br/>
      Finally, murine bcl-2 normally minimal in amount, was overexpressed in FL5.12 cells possessing either human bcl-2 wt or mutant proteins (FIGS. 25e,f).
      <br/>
      Radiolabeled human bcl-2 was immunoprecipitated with the 6C8 MAb which does not recognize murine bcl-2 (FIG. 25e).
      <br/>
      A Western blot of these immunoprecipitates was immunostained with a biotinylated anti-mouse bcl-2 MAb (3Fll) that does not recognize human bcl-2 (FIG. 25f) (Veis et al. (1993) J. Immunol. 151:2546-2554).
      <br/>
      The mutant as well as wild type human bcl-2 proteins dimerized with mouse bcl-2 (FIG. 25f).
      <br/>
      Taken together, these results indicate that bcl-2 is able to form homodimers and this property is left intact by the selected mutations which abrogated function and heterodimerization.
    </p>
    <p num="332">
      The reciprocal ability of bcl-2 and Bax to repress or promote death, prompted analysis of bcl-2 mutants for function and dimerization.
      <br/>
      The BH1 and BH2 domains proved critical for bcl-2's function and the formation of bcl-2/Bax heterodimers.
      <br/>
      Select mutations in BH1 or BH2 domains still enabled bcl-2 homodimerization, yet the bcl-2 homodimers were insufficient to protect cells from death.
      <br/>
      We can not exclude that conserved bcl-2 residues such as gly145 or trp188 might have additional roles, but each amino acid is clearly required for heterodimerization with Bax.
      <br/>
      In addition, bcl-2 appears to have further partners, such as R-ras (Fernandez-Sarabia and Bischoff (1993) Nature 366:274-275), and could prove to have additional functional domains.
      <br/>
      However, the striking correlation between the ability of bcl-2 to repress cell death and its ability to heterodimerize with Bax suggests that bcl-2 represses cell death by complexing with Bax.
    </p>
    <p num="333">
      The conservation of the novel BH1 and BH2 dimerization motifs in an expanding bcl-2 family suggests other members may also participate in competing dimerizations through these domains.
      <br/>
      The fact that the same BH1 glycine residue is altered in a ced-9 gain-of-function mutation emphasizes the importance of this protein interface in the regulation of a cell death pathway that appears to be universal to multicellular organisms.
      <br/>
      However, the finding that the gly145 to glu substitution in bcl-2 results in loss-of-function coupled with the fact that bcl-2 wt does not completely compensate for ced-9 in C. elegans (vaux et al. (1992) Science 258:1955-1957; Hengartner and Horvitz (1994) Cell) may indicate a difference in their protein interactions.
      <br/>
      Computational predictions (Methods of GGBSM or Garnier) indicate that both BH1 and BH2 domains of all bcl-2 family members are primarily  BETA -sheet or coil in structure.
      <br/>
      The two domains could prove to be binding interfaces presented as a loop structure.
      <br/>
      While both BH1 and BH2 domains are required for bcl-2 to bind with Bax, their importance to other family members is under investigation.
      <br/>
      Overall, the current data favor a model in which bcl-2 must bind Bax to exert its death-repressor activity and suggest that strategies which disrupt bcl-2/Bax heterodimers would be expected to promote cell death.

      The HA-bcl-2 construct was human bcl-2 wt tagged with a hemagglutinin epitope (Oltvai et al. (1993) Cell 74:609-619) and cloned into an RSV promoter-driven expression vector.
      <br/>
      For secondary transfections, constructs were co-transfected with the LAP267 vector (Oltvai et al. (1993) Cell 74:609-619) carrying a hygromycin resistant gene and clones were selected with 2 mg/ml hygromycin.
      <br/>
      Clones were metabolically labeled with 35 S-Met overnight and immunoprecipitated with the anti-HA MAb, 12CA5, for HA-bcl-2/bcl-2 double transfectants (b,c), or 6C8 for the mouse/human bcl-2 double transfectants (e).
      <br/>
      For panel (d) and (f), immunoprecipitates were size-fractionated by SDS-PAGE and Western analysis was performed with a biotinylated anti-human bcl-2 (6C8) MAb (d) or a biotinylated anti-mouse bcl-2 (3Fll) MAb (f) and developed with enhanced chemiluminescence, ECL (Amersham).
      <br/>
      The short period of exposure used for ECL development was not sufficient for a 35 S signal to be detected.
      <br/>
      After Western results were obtained, the blot was washed with PBS containing 0.05% Tween-20 to strip the ECL substrate.
      <br/>
      A repeat autoradiogram confirmed that no ECL substrate remained.
      <br/>
      The blot was then exposed at room temperature to reveal immunoprecipitated,35 S-Met-labeled proteins (c and e).

    <p num="338">EXAMPLE 12</p>
    <p num="339">
      This example demonstrates that a yeast two-hybrid system ("Y-2-H") reveals: (1) binding interactions between members of the bcl-2 family of related binding proteins (i.e., bcl-2, bcl-2 homologues, and proteins which exhibit binding to bcl-2 and bcl-2 homologues), (2) a hierarchy of binding interactions between members (in heterodimer combinations and permutations), wherein members exhibit different relative binding affinities and/or binding interaction surfaces for heterodimeric or multimeric interaction with other members, (3) relative affinities for each bcl-2 family member to form homodimers (or other homomultimers) as compared to forming heterodimers (or other heteromultimers) with other bcl-2 family members, and (4) related interactions, functional consequences, and biological properties of these proteins and polypeptide sequence motifs and domains therein.
      <br/>
      This example also demonstrates that antibodies to a specific epitope (or epitopes) on a bcl-2 family member protein can identify binding interaction interfaces (e.g., protein interaction binding surfaces, moieties which become relatively solvent inaccessible and/or sterically hindered as a consequence of a binding interaction), and that binding interaction interface(s) in a bcl-2 member protein can vary depending upon the specific binding partner.
      <br/>
      The example also demonstrates orientation dependence of yeast two hybrid systems; the strength of binding interactions between two polypeptide sequences, such as a first sequence (X) and a second sequence (Y), can vary depending on whether the first sequence is fused with the activation domain or the DNA-binding domain of the transcriptional activator of the two-hybrid system, and the second sequence is fused, respectively, to the DNA-binding domain or activation domain of the transcriptional activator.
      <br/>
      The example demonstrates other aspects of the bcl-2 protein family as well.
    </p>
    <p num="340">Overview</p>
    <p num="341">
      A family of bcl-2 related proteins regulate cell death and share highly conserved BH1 and BH2 domains.
      <br/>
      BH1 and BH2 domains of bcl-2 are required for it to heterodimerize with Bax and to repress apoptosis.
      <br/>
      A yeast-two-hybrid assay accurately reproduced this interaction and defined a selectivity and hierarchy of further dimerizations.
      <br/>
      Bax also heterodimerizes with bcl-xL (Boise et al. (1993) Cell 74: 597), Mcl-1 (Kozopas et al. (1993) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. (USA) 90: 3516), and A1 (Lin et al. (1993) J. Immunol. 151: 179).
      <br/>
      A glyl59ala substitution in BH1 of bcl-xL disrupted its heterodimerization with Bax and abrogated its inhibition of apoptosis in mammalian cells.
      <br/>
      This indicates that the susceptibility to apoptosis is determined by multiple, competing dimerizations in which Bax plays a central role.
    </p>
    <p num="342">Background</p>
    <p num="343">
      An expanding family of bcl-2-related molecules is most highly conserved in two regions entitled bcl-2 homology 1 and 2 (BH1 and BH2) domains.
      <br/>
      This includes Bax, a homolog that dimerizes with bcl-2 and promotes apoptosis (Oltvai et al. (1993) Cell 74: 609, and supra).
      <br/>
      Mutagenesis of bcl-2 indicated that BH1 and BH2 were required for heterodimerization with Bax and demonstrated that bcl-2 heterodimerizes with Bax to repress cell death (Yin et al. (1994) Nature 369: 321, and supra).
      <br/>
      The ratio of bcl-2 to Bax dictates a cell's susceptibility to an apoptotic stimulus.
      <br/>
      In another system, the ratio of bcl-2 to Bax appeared to decrease following a death stimulus (Selvakumaran et al. (1994) Oncogene 9: 1791; Miyashita et al. (1994) Oncofene 9: 1799).
      <br/>
      The conservation of BH1 and BH2 within other family members is consistent with a model wherein they can also regulate cell death through competing dimerizations.
    </p>
    <p num="344">Yeast Two-Hybrid Binding Interactions</p>
    <p num="345">
      To explore whether a selectivity and rank order of dimerizations existed amongst bcl-2 family members we established a yeast-two-hybrid (Y-2-H) assay (Fields S and Song O (1989) Nature 340: 245).
      <br/>
      Signal-anchor sequences (Nguyen et al. (1993) J. Biol. Chem. 268) were removed from bcl-2 and Bax to insure their translocation to the nucleus as fusion proteins with the GAL4 DNA binding domain (DB) or the GAL4 activation domain (AD) (FIG. 26A).
      <br/>
      Bax heterodimerized with bcl-2 to activate transcription of LacZ (FIG. 26B, bottom).
      <br/>
      Moreover, a Bax/Bax interaction was even stronger reflecting the relative strengths noted in mammalian cells.
      <br/>
      To further validate this assay, the WGR (aa144-146) within BH1 of bcl-2 was altered to AAA (mI-2), WAR (MI-3), or WER (mI-4).
      <br/>
      These bcl-2 mutants failed to heterodimerize with Bax in Y-2-H, correctly reflecting the disrupted bcl-2/Bax interactions seen in mammalian cells (FIG. 26B, bottom).
    </p>
    <p num="346">
      To test for dimerization between other bcl-2 family members, each was cloned into the GAL4 DB and GAL4 AD vectors.
      <br/>
      Each GAL4 DB construct was tested with an empty GAL4 AD vector to detect any endogenous activation capacity within that construct.
      <br/>
      The bcl-xS (Boise et al. (1993) op. cit) and A1 (Lin et al. (1993) op. cit) inserts were limited by spurious activation (FIG. 27).
      <br/>
      An assessment of the various combinations of family members revealed a specificity of interactions (FIG. 27).
      <br/>
      Moveover, a quantitative ONPG assay (Rose et al. (1983) Meth. Enzymol. 101: 167) performed on standardized lysates assessed the strength of these protein dimerizations in Y-2-H (FIG. 28A).
      <br/>
      While this is not intended as a direct reflection of actual affinities within mammalian cells, it indicates a hierarchy of dimerizations.
      <br/>
      Schematic representation of the binding relationships is presented in FIG. 28B. A salient feature was the capacity of Bax to dimerize with multiple partners. bcl-xL, but not bcl-xS, interacted weakly with Bax, while the known dimerizations with bcl-2 and Bax were more avid.
      <br/>
      The Mcl-1 (Kozopas et al. (1993) op. cit) and A1 proteins scored the strongest with Bax in Y-2-H.
      <br/>
      However, specificity exists in that many of the potential interactions between family members do not occur (see, FIG. 28B).
      <br/>
      For example, Mcl-1 displays marked selectivity only heterodimerizing with Bax.
      <br/>
      A1 appears to also heterodimerize with bcl-2, albeit less strongly than with Bax (FIG. 28A). bcl-xS which lacks BH1 and BH2 only scored with bcl-xL which is identical outside these domains.
      <br/>
      Most family members bearing BH1 and BH2 also homodimerize although heterodimers can be stronger.
      <br/>
      Of note, Mcl-1 homodimers were not detected.
      <br/>
      The overall pattern of interactions indicates that Bax has the widest capacity to dimerize with other family members (FIG. 28B).
    </p>
    <p num="347">
      To demonstrate that interactions noted in the Y-2-H system predict meaningful dimerizations that would regulate apoptosis in mammalian cells, we selected the bcl-xL /Bax interaction for further study. bcl-xL is a known inhibitor of apoptosis (Boise et al. (1993) op. cit).
      <br/>
      We generated a hamster anti-Bax monoclonal antibody (4D2 mAb) that recognized mouse Bax.
      <br/>
      The 4D2 mAb was produced in Armenian hamsters using murine Bax DELTA C19 protein as an immunogen; Bax was expressed in E. coli strain XL1-Blue (Stratagene) using expression vector plasmid pGex-KG (Guan et al. (1991) Anal. Biochem. 192: 262).
      <br/>
      The GST-Bax fusion protein was captured on GST-agarose beads, cleaved by thrombin, and released Bax protein was concentrated prior to injection.
      <br/>
      The 4D2 mAb recognized mouse Bax (FIG. 29A, Lane 2) The 4D2 mAb also recognized a hemagglutinin epitope tagged p23 HA-Bax molecule (FIG. 29A, lane 5).
      <br/>
      Peptide sequence of the 21kd immunoprecipitated protein confirmed it was Bax. of note, the 4D2 mAb also cross reacts with a p28 molecule that is not bcl-xL as determined by peptide sequence (FIG. 29A, arrows).
      <br/>
      This was observed in RIPA buffer, which disrupts dimers of this family.
    </p>
    <p num="348">
      This IL-3 dependent murine hematopoietic cell line, FL5.12, has no substantial bcl-xL when assessed with a rabbit anti-bcl-x heteroantibody (FIG. 29B, lane 1).
      <br/>
      For production of rabbit polyclonal antibodies, 1 mg of recombinant bcl-xS protein was used as the immunogen and injected subcutaneously and animals were boosted with 200  MU g of protein; sera were screened by western blot against recombinant protein and immunoprecipitation against in vitro translated protein.
      <br/>
      When stably transfected clones of FL5.12 which overexpressed wild type (wt) bcl-xL were immunoprecipitated with this Ab, a p21 species was co-precipitated in 0.2% NP-40 buffer.
      <br/>
      A western blot of this immunoprecipitate developed with the 4D2 mAb confirmed that the P21 molecule was Bax (Fib. 29B, Lane 2).
    </p>
    <p num="349">
      We next examined if the same sites that had dictated bcl-2/Bax interaction were required for bcl-xL /Bax dimers.
      <br/>
      The WAR (mI-3) substitution that eliminated Bcl-2's heterodimerization with Bax (Yin et al. (1994) Nature op. cit) was introduced as gly159ala within BH1 of bcl-xL.
      <br/>
      The single amino acid, WAR substitution, mI-3, was placed in bcl-xL by PCR-mediated site-directed mutagenesis.
      <br/>
      An EcoRI fragment containing the full-length human bcl-xL cDNA (for sequence see, Boise et al. (1993) Cell op. cit) was used as a template in two separate PCR reactions incorporating a unique HpaI site.
      <br/>
      The two PCR inserts were cloned into a BLuescript vector and ligated utilizing the unique HpaI site in each insert.
      <br/>
      Both constructs were sequenced to insure that only the desired positions were changed.
      <br/>
      The mutated and wildtype bcl-xL molecules were cloned into the pSFFV-neo vector (Fuhlbrigge et al. (1988) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. (USA) 85: 5649) and transfected as previously described (Oltvai et al. (1993) Cell 74: 609).
      <br/>
      Neomycin resistant clones were picked at random and examined for expression of human bcl-xL by western immunostaining.
      <br/>
      Staining procedures were performed in PBS with 0.05% Tween-20 (PBS-Tween) at room temperature.
      <br/>
      Filters were incubated with the rabbit anti-bcl-x polyclonal Ab (1:500), followed by biotinylated goat anti-rabbit antibody (1:330). both for 2 hours.
      <br/>
      Immunoblots were reacted with HRP-streptavidin (1:1000) for 1 hour and developed with nickel chloride (0.03%).
      <br/>
      For Bax immunostaining, filters were incubated with the 4D2 mAb (1:250), followed by biotinylated goat anti-hamster antibody (1:2000), both for 2 hours.
      <br/>
      Immunoblots were reacted with HRP-streptavidin (1:20000) for 1 hour and developed with ECL (Amersham).
    </p>
    <p num="350">
      Immunoprecipitation of bcl-xL mI-3 within FL5.12 cells revealed that the amount of co-precipitated Bax was drastically reduced (FIG. 29B, lane 3).
      <br/>
      To confirm this, an epitope tagged HA-bcl-xL mI-3 was immunoprecipitated with the 12CA5 anti-hemagglutinin mAb.
      <br/>
      This mutant, when identified by the separate HA epitope, also failed to heterodimerize with Bax (FIG. 29C, lane 3).
      <br/>
      Following immunodepletion of bcl-xL, the remaining supernatant from FL5.12 bcl-xL mI-3 cells displayed abundant Bax compared to the supernatant from bcl-xL wt containing cells (not shown).
      <br/>
      Thus, when bcl-xL fails to dimerize with Bax, more Bax/Bax homodimers exist.
    </p>
    <p num="351">
      Of interest, the Bax epitope recognized by the 4D2 mAb is present on Bax/Bax homodimers and bcl-2/Bax heterodimers but not bcl-xL /Bax heterodimers.
      <br/>
      The 4D2 mAb co-precipitates the minimal amounts of bcl-2 present in F5.12 and substantially more bcl-2 in FL5.12 cells overexpressing bcl-2 (FIG. 29D, lanes 1, 2).
      <br/>
      However, only a minimal amount of Bax homodimer was recognized by the 4D2 mAb in FL5.12 cells which overexpressed bcl-xL wt (FIG. 29D, lane 4).
      <br/>
      In contract, the 4D2 Bax epitope was available in cells bearing the non-dimerizing bcl-xL mI-3 or HA-bcl-xL mI-3 (FIG. 29D, lane 5; 29C, lane 2).
      <br/>
      This indicates that the protein/protein interface varies between certain Bax dimers.
    </p>
    <p num="352">
      To assess the functional significance of bcl-xL 's interaction with Bax, a series of stably transfected FL5.12 clones were generated expressing either bcl-xL wt or bcl-xL mI-3 protein (FIG. 30, panel B).
      <br/>
      When assessed for apoptosis following IL-3 deprivation all bcl-xL wt clones displayed extended cell survival.
      <br/>
      In contrast, bcl-xL mI-3 which failed to heterodimerize with Bax had also lost its death repressor activity (FIG. 30, panel A).
    </p>
    <p num="353">
      A Y-2-H system recapitulated the specificity of bcl-2/Bax dimerizations known to be of functional significance in mammalian cells.
      <br/>
      Newly observed dimerizations are consistent with Bax playing a central role in regulating the function of other family members (FIG. 28B). bcl-xL represses apoptosis and scored as a comparatively weak interaction with DB-Bax, but a strong interaction in the DB-bcl-xL /AD-Bax orientation (FIG. 27).
      <br/>
      The assessment of bcl-xL /Bax in mammalian cells argues that other Y-2-H predicted dimerizations may also prove to be functionally significant.
      <br/>
      A single amino acid substitution in BH1 disrupted bcl-xL 's heterodimerization with Bax and abolished its inhibition of apoptosis, exactly as it had for bcl-2.
      <br/>
      This emphasizes the importance of BH1 in both survival function and the ability of family members to heterodimerize with Bax.
      <br/>
      The demonstration that both bcl-2 and bcl-xL heterodimerize with Bax indicates their role and capacity to disrupt Bax/Bax homodimers, providing a connection between death repressor and effector pathways.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, each Bax heterodimer can represent a distinct, active moiety.
      <br/>
      The loss of the 4D2 epitope in the bcl-xL /Bax heterodimer indicates that each dimer may be unique.
      <br/>
      Multiple family members would enable select interactions with other cytosolic proteins linking cell death to other processes.
      <br/>
      In another system, a switch from Myc/Max to Mad/Max heterodimers coincides with a switch from cell proliferation to differentiation (Ayer et al. (1993) Genes Devel. 7: 555).
      <br/>
      We have noted tissue specificity in the distribution of bcl-2 family members; however, certain cells express multiple members.
      <br/>
      In such instances the susceptibility to death as proposed in FIG. 28B, reflects a set point determined by competing dimers of varying affinity.
