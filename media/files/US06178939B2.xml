    <heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">
      The present invention relates generally to abating engine noise and providing an air purification unit associated with the engine of a motor vehicle.
      <br/>
      In particular, the present invention relates to a housing system configured to substantially reduce the noise generated by an automobile engine and provide a housing configured to receive an air filter.
    </p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="3">
      It is well known to purify raw air before routing the air and fuel through a manifold and supplying the air and fuel to a cylinder head of an internal combustion engine.
      <br/>
      Such known air cleaners typically include a filter disposed in a container.
      <br/>
      In operation, such known air cleaners provide for the intake of raw air, the purification of the raw air and the routing of purified air to the manifold.
      <br/>
      Such known manifolds provide for the routing of the purified air and the fuel to the cylinder head of the engine.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      It is also well known to reduce the amount of noise generated by an automobile and its associated components.
      <br/>
      For example, a muffler may be connected to an engine exhaust to reduce the noise generated by the ignition of the fuel and the air in the engine.
      <br/>
      In addition, it is known to provide sound absorbing materials under the hood of an automobile and in the driver compartment of the automobile to reduce the amount of engine and ambient noise perceptible to the driver.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      A problem with such known air cleaners and their containers is that they are not typically configured to reduce engine noise or noise generated by belt driven engine accessories.
      <br/>
      Further, such containers typically have a single purpose (i.e., containing the air cleaner) and are not easily accessible for servicing of the air cleaner.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      What is needed, therefore, is a housing system configured to receive an air cleaner and reduce the amount of noise generated by an engine and its associated belt driven accessories.
      <br/>
      It would also be advantageous to have a housing system onto which cavity accessories and mechanical accessories may be secured.
      <br/>
      It would further be advantageous to have a housing system that is capable of cooling such accessories.
      <br/>
      It would also be advantageous to provide a housing system of simple structure that occupies the unused underhood space of an automobile.
    </p>

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
    <p num="13">
      FIG. 1 shows a housing system 10 for reducing engine noise and receiving a filter assembly 40 according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention.
      <br/>
      System 10 includes a housing 20 mounted to an engine block 182 of a vehicular internal combustion engine 98.
      <br/>
      Housing 20 includes an air reservoir (shown as a cavity 24) and an external cavity (shown as a recess 34).
      <br/>
      Filter assembly 40 is disposed between an air intake 66 of housing 20 and a throttle assembly 130.
      <br/>
      In operation, raw air 62 (e.g., atmospheric, ambient, unpurified, dirty air, etc.) enters intake 66 and is directed through cavity 24.
      <br/>
      Raw air 62 is then filtered by filter assembly 40 and exits cavity 24 through a discharge (e.g., outlet, vent, exhaust, etc. shown as an aperture 128) of housing 20.
      <br/>
      Purified air 48 is then regulated or throttled by throttle assembly 130 and is directed to a valve cover 186 of engine 98.
    </p>
    <p num="14">
      Referring to FIG. 3, an exterior wall 22 defines cavity 24 of housing 20.
      <br/>
      Cavity 24 includes a dirty air chamber 26 and an air filtering chamber 28.
      <br/>
      A raw air inlet 68 is integral with wall 22 and projects outwardly from the front housing 20.
      <br/>
      As best shown in FIG. 1, inlet 68 is positioned off center from the front of housing 20.
      <br/>
      A fastener (shown as a capture clamp 72) connects an extension tube 70 to inlet 68.
      <br/>
      Extension tube 70 provides raw air 62 from a raw air source (not shown) such as the atmosphere.
      <br/>
      Raw air 62 that is induced into dirty air chamber 26 is directed toward filtering chamber 28 for purification or filtering by filter assembly 40.
    </p>
    <p num="15">
      Referring to FIG. 2, the exterior of housing 20 includes recess 34 surrounding belt driven accessories 150 mounted to the front of engine block 182.
      <br/>
      Recess 34 is defined by a peripheral wall 36 of a shroud 38.
      <br/>
      Wall 36 partially circumscribes and surrounds belt driven accessories 150 to partially enclose a belt system 148 and belt driven accessories 150 within recess 34.
      <br/>
      Recess 34 is in close proximity to belt system 148 and belt driven accessories 150.
      <br/>
      Each belt driven accessory 150 includes a pulley or wheel 168 connected by a rod 170 to a base 174, such that wheel 168 is rotated when rod 170 is rotated.
      <br/>
      Belt system 148 interconnects belt driven accessories 150.
      <br/>
      A serpentine or drive belt 152 interconnects wheel 168 of a crank 160 driven by a crankshaft (not shown) to wheel 168 of a water pump 162 and wheel 168 of an alternator 164.
      <br/>
      As wheel 168 of crank 160 is rotated, drive belt 156 causes wheel 168 of water pump 162 and alternator 164 to likewise rotate.
      <br/>
      A tensioning belt 158 for removing slack in drive belt 156 interconnects wheel 168 of a tensioning device (shown as an idler 166) to wheel 168 of crank 160.
    </p>
    <p num="16">
      A cavity or resonator 30 for holding raw air 62 and a resonator 32 are provided within the interior of housing 20.
      <br/>
      Referring to FIG. 4, resonators 30 and 32 are positioned adjacent to cavity 24.
      <br/>
      An intake or inlet (shown as an aperture 74 of resonator 30 and an aperture 76 of resonator 32) provide a passage for the ingress and egress of raw air 62 between cavity 24 and resonator 30 and cavity 24 and resonator 30 (see FIG. 5).
      <br/>
      Without wishing to be limited by theory, it is believed that noise (such as vibrations) generated from the engine and the induction of raw air into the air reservoir may be substantially reduced, dampened or muffled by bouncing or ricocheting against the boundaries of the resonators.
      <br/>
      According to an alternative embodiment, the intake of the resonator may be or horn-shaped (e.g., crimped, trumpet-shaped portion, curved, etc.).
      <br/>
      Not wishing to be limited by theory, it is believed that the horn shape of the intake of the resonator may provide an overall noise reduction by partially matching the natural frequency of the raw air and the engine to the natural frequency of the resonator.
      <br/>
      According to other alternative embodiments, the resonators may include a number of molded baffles or maze-like structures (which may be lined with a sound absorbent material as is known in the office furnishings art) into which the raw air is directed (i.e., the baffles may further serve to reduce the overall noise level of the engine and the induction of air into the air cavity).
    </p>
    <p num="17">
      A variety of accessories may be mounted to the interior or the exterior of housing 20.
      <br/>
      Referring to FIG. 4, cavity accessories 100 providing a reservoir or storage area for an item (such as a liquid) are shown mounted to the exterior of housing 20.
      <br/>
      A coolant reservoir (shown as a radiator overflow bottle 102) having a storage area 106 may be molded to or integral with housing 20.
      <br/>
      A cover 110 is provided on the top of bottle 102 to reduce the likelihood of items escaping from storage area 106 of bottle 102.
      <br/>
      A fastener 116 (e.g., threaded screw top, snap-on top, lid, etc.) may provide bottle 102 with a generally airtight seal.
      <br/>
      A solvent reservoir (shown as a windshield wiper fluid bottle 104) having a storage area 108 may be molded to or integral with housing 20.
      <br/>
      A cover 112 is provided on the top of bottle 104 to reduce the likelihood of items (such as windshield wiper fluid) from escaping storage area 108 of bottle 104.
      <br/>
      A fastener 114 (e.g., threaded screw top, snap top, lid, etc.) may provide a generally watertight seal to bottle 104.
      <br/>
      According to an alternative embodiment, a variety of mechanical accessories (e.g., radiator fan, windshield pump, air induction fan, etc.) may be mounted to the interior or the exterior of the housing.
      <br/>
      According to other alternative embodiments as shown in FIG. 4, any number of internal cavities may be provided within housing 20 such as a side cavity 176, a closure cavity 178, or a front cavity 148 to provide additional space or surface area for mounting accessories.
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      Referring to FIG. 3, a filter assembly 40 is disposed within filtering chamber 28 of cavity 24 and may be supported by a support structure such as a flange (not shown).
      <br/>
      Filter assembly 40 includes a generally circular-shaped air filter element (shown as a canister 42).
      <br/>
      A projection tube 118 of housing 20 fits within an aperture 128 of an upper end 52 of canister 42 to support filter assembly 40. (Projection tube 118 has a diameter less than the diameter of aperture 128 of canister 42.) Canister 42 includes an air receiving surface (shown as an outer wall 44) and an air-emitting surface (shown as an inner wall 46).
      <br/>
      Raw air 62 stored or induced in cavity 24 enters canister 42 through outer wall 44 and is directed through a filter media (not shown) such as a pretreated or pleated corrugated paper.
      <br/>
      During the purification or filtering of raw air 62 by canister 42, impurities (e.g., debris, particulates, gasses, dirt, pollution, etc.) may be entrapped within the filter media.
      <br/>
      Purified air 48 exits the filter media through inner wall 46 of canister 42.
      <br/>
      A covering (shown as an end cap 58) circumscribes and surrounds a lower end 50 of canister 42.
      <br/>
      End cap 58 promotes the entry of raw air 62 through outer wall 44 by covering or blocking lower end 58 of canister 42.
      <br/>
      A generally flexible, compressible seal 56 is mounted to upper end 52 of canister 42.
      <br/>
      Seal 56 extends radially around canister 42 beyond the periphery of aperture 128.
      <br/>
      A fastener (not shown), such as an adhesive or glue, may secure seal 56 to canister 42.
      <br/>
      Such fastener may also secure a left end of the filter media to a right end of the filter media to form a generally circular-shaped filter media.
      <br/>
      According to an alternative embodiment, the seal may be integrally molded to the filter element and/or the seal may be removably coupled to the filter element.
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      A twist lock system 120 (such as a bayonet mount) secures air filter assembly 40 in housing 20 such that canister 42 may be readily installed or removed from air filtering chamber 28.
      <br/>
      To secure or remove canister 42, a grip 124 of a cap 122 having molded projections or ears (shown as fingers 126) is rotated about 120 degrees relative to housing 20.
      <br/>
      Fingers 126 are spaced generally evenly about the periphery of cap 122.
      <br/>
      Cap 122 urges seal 56 of canister 42 against wall 22.
      <br/>
      Upon rotation of grip 124, fingers 126 of cap 122 are interconnected with wall 22 of housing 20.
      <br/>
      Such interconnection of fingers 126 and wall 22 maintain a compressive force between seal 56 and projection tube 118 to prevent raw air 62 from leading around seal 56.
      <br/>
      According to an alternative embodiment, an indexing system may be provided with the twist lock system to inhibit further rotation of the cap relative to the housing (i.e., such rotation may cause a disconnection between the fingers of the cap and the wall of the housing).
