    <heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="1">
      The present invention is directed to a continuously variable transmission and, more particularly, to a control arrangement thereof and a method for preventing belt slippage in the transmission.
      <br/>
      In a disclosed preferred embodiment, the transmission is used as a constant speed drive for an aircraft electrical power generator.
    </p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND AND SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">
      The variable pulley transmission, or continuously variable transmission (CVT) as it is commonly called, has been under development for over two decades, but its use as a power transmission is mainly for automotive applications.
      <br/>
      Its control is rather complicated and is very sensitive to operating conditions.
      <br/>
      For example, in a control arrangement for a variable pulley transmission disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,458,318, a variable line pressure is controlled and applied to the sheave of the secondary or driven pulley of the transmission, and also serves as the hydraulic power supply to a ratio control valve in a speed control loop of the transmission.
    </p>
    <p num="3">
      It has found that due to the variable supply pressure in the continuously variable transmission of U.S. Pat. No. 4,458,318, both the pressure control valve (a pressure relief type valve) and the ratio control valve gains change with the supply pressure, and the control is therefore very sensitive to system operating conditions.
      <br/>
      There is a need for an improved continuously variable transmission with a control arrangement and method which overcome these drawbacks and disadvantages of this known continuously variable transmission.
      <br/>
      More particularly, there is a need for an improved continuously variable transmission with a control arrangement and method which are simpler and more robust than those disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,458,318. It is an object of the present invention to provide a continuously variable transmission with a control arrangement and method which meet this need.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      The commonly owned U.S. Pat. No. 6,099,424 for CONTINUOUSLY VARIABLE TRANSMISSION WITH CONTROL ARRANGEMENT AND METHOD FOR CONTROL ARRANGEMENT AND METHOD FOR REDUCING TRANSMISSION BELT SLIPPAGE, filed concurrently with this application and hereby incorporated by reference.
      <br/>
      However in the application of a CVT as a constant speed drive for an electrical power generator, if a large load is suddenly applied, the belt speed may start to slip.
      <br/>
      If this happens too often, damage of the belt and pulley may occur.
      <br/>
      One way to entirely avoid belt slippage would be to apply very large forces to the sheaves at all times so that even the largest possible load can be accomodated.
      <br/>
      This would definitely shorten the life of the belt.
      <br/>
      The present invention aims to provide an improved continuously variable transmission having a control arrangement and method whereby just enough forces need be applied to the sheaves to prevent the belt from slipping under all possible load conditions.

      <br/>
      In the disclosed form of the invention, the source of constant hydraulic pressure comprises a hydraulic pump and a pressure relief valve in communication with the output of the hydraulic pump to maintain a constant predetermined hydraulic output pressure of the pump.
      <br/>
      The single source of constant hydraulic pressure is operatively connected to the actuator of the primary pulley by way of a ratio control valve and to the actuator of the secondary pulley by way of a pressure control valve.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      According to further features of the invention, the continuously variable transmission includes a hydraulic pressure control loop for controlling the hydraulic pressure applied to the actuator of the secondary pulley as a function of the sensed load of the device to be driven on the transmission and the pitch radius of the secondary pulley.
      <br/>
      An output speed control loop is also provided for controlling the output speed of the transmission driving the device to be driven.
      <br/>
      In the disclosed embodiment the output speed control loop may be set to control the output speed at a constant value for driving an aircraft electric generator.

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DISCLOSED EMBODIMENT</heading>
    <p num="10">
      Referring now to the drawings, FIG. 1 depicts a continuously variable transmission 1 as disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,099,424 for transferring drive from an engine 2 to a device 3 to be driven.
      <br/>
      The transmission 1 comprises a primary pulley 4, shown schematically in FIG. 2, receiving drive from the engine, a belt 5 and a secondary pulley 6 which is coupled over the belt to the primary pulley 4 for transferring drive to the device 3.
      <br/>
      The primary and secondary pulleys each have a fixed sheave, 22 and 22' respectively, and an axially movable sheave, 23 and 23' respectively.
      <br/>
      The positions of the axially movable sheaves are adjustable by respective hydraulically operated actuators 7 and 8 to effect ratio change in the transmission and to maintain belt tension.
      <br/>
      A single source 9 of constant hydraulic pressure is operatively connected for driving each of the actuators 7 and 8.
    </p>
    <p num="11">
      In the transmission 1, as illustrated in FIG. 2, the source of constant hydraulic pressure 9 comprises a hydraulic pump 10 and a pressure relief valve 11 in communication with the output of the hydraulic pump to maintain a constant predetermined hydraulic output pressure Ps of the pump as denoted in FIGS. 1 and 2.
      <br/>
      The single source of constant hydraulic pressure is operatively connected to the primary sheave actuator 7 by way of a ratio control valve 12.
      <br/>
      The ratio control valve may be a two-stage three-way servovalve of the type disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,458,318, for example.
      <br/>
      The constant supply pressure 9 is operatively connected to the secondary sheave actuator 8 by way of a pressure control valve 13.
      <br/>
      The valve 13 is a pressure reducing type valve, preferably an electrohydraulic pressure reducing valve such as an electrically driven proportioning solenoid valve.
      <br/>
      Reference is made to the co-pending, commonly assigned U.S. Pat. No. 6,126,138 for PRESSURE REDUCING VALVE AND CONTINUOUSLY VARIABLE TRANSMISSION WITH CONTROL ARRANGEMENT USING SAME filed concurrently with this application and hereby incorporated by reference, for a detailed disclosure of a preferred form of the pressure reducing valve although other pressure reducing valves may be used.
    </p>
    <p num="12">
      For a continuously variable transmission to work properly, it has to be controlled such that, firstly, enough force is applied to the secondary sheave, the driven sheave, to keep the belt from slipping, and secondly, a variable force must be applied to the primary sheave, the driver sheave, to change the transmission ratio according to the requirement of system operation.
      <br/>
      In the disclosed embodiment, the requirement of system operation is for constant speed drive application for driving device 3, which is an aircraft electrical generator, whereby the transmission output speed must be maintained constant.
      <br/>
      The electronic-hydraulic control system of the continuously variable transmission 1 is used to control the above-mentioned two functions.
    </p>
    <p num="13">
      The control system consists of two main control loops: a pressure control loop 14 to control the force applied to the secondary sheave by actuator 8 for controlling belt tension, and an output speed control loop 15 for controlling the transmission ratio to maintain the transmission output speed, namely the output shaft speed of the secondary pulley 6, at a constant value under varying engine speed and generator load conditions.
      <br/>
      This control arrangement of the transmission 1 is simpler and more robust than the previous arrangement in U.S. Pat. No. 4,458,318. Without the constant supply pressure source 9, a complicated gain scheduling scheme will be required to compensate for changes in supply pressure that cause belt slippage in the conventional continuously variable transmission.
    </p>
    <p num="14">
      The force required to be applied to the axially movable sheave of the secondary pulley by actuator 8 to keep the belt 3 from slipping is a function of load torque and the pulley pitch radius.
      <br/>
      A method for reducing belt slippage in the continuously variable transmission comprises determining the hydraulic pressure to be applied to the actuator 8 of the secondary pulley to keep the belt from slipping.
      <br/>
      This determining step includes determining the load torque TQo transmitted from the device to be driven to the secondary pulley of the transmission and the pitch radius r2 of the secondary pulley, and calculating a value for the set pressure Pset of the hydraulic pressure control loop to be applied to the actuator 8 of the secondary pulley 6 in accordance with the relationship.  (Equation image '1' not included in text)
    </p>
    <p num="15">where:</p>
    <p num="16">
      TQo is the torque on the secondary pulley from the device to be driven
      <br/>
      r2 is the secondary pulley pitch radius,
      <br/>
      ALPHA  is the pulley groove angle,
      <br/>
      MU  is the coefficient of friction between the belt and the secondary pulley, and
      <br/>
      As is the area of the actuator for the sheave of the secondary pulley.
    </p>
    <p num="17">
      The step of determining the load torque transmitted from the generator 3 to the secondary pulley of the continuously variable pulley transmission 1 includes measuring the generator load current IL with current detector 20, the generator speed NG with speed sensor 18 and the linear displacement Y1 of the primary sheave actuator 7 using detector 21.
      <br/>
      From the geometry of the primary pulley 4, its pitch radius of r1 is calculated from the measured sheave actuator displacement Y1.
      <br/>
      The generator torque TQG is calculated given the measurements of IL, NG, and Y1 as set forth below.
      <br/>
      From the constraint of constant belt length of belt 5 and constant distance between the centers of the two pulleys 4 and 6, the pitch radius r2 of the driven pulley 6 is then calculated using the now known pitch radius r1.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, the pitch radius r2 could be directly measured using a proximity sensor, for example.
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      The torque TQo at the output shaft of the secondary pulley 6 of the transmission 1 is then calculated as set forth below using the previously calculated generator torque TQG and the generator side gear ratio RGo of the gear and shaft unit 16 drivingly connected between the output shaft of the transmission and the generator 3 as depicted in FIG. 1.
      <br/>
      Using these values, the hydraulic pressure required, Pset, which serves as the command signal from calculating unit or microprocessor 19 to the pressure control loop 14, is obtained from the calculated force divided by the secondary sheave actuator area As.
      <br/>
      The procedure for calculating the set pressure Pset for control loop 14 is set forth in the flow diagram of FIG. 3 and described in more detail below.
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      For sensing the load of the generator on the transmission, in addition to or instead of measuring the generator load current IL, a torque sensor 17 mounted on the output shaft of the secondary pulley of the transmission can also be used.
      <br/>
      This provides an even more direct measurement of the load.
      <br/>
      Further, instead of measuring the linear displacement of the primary sheave, the displacement of the actuator of the secondary sheave can be measured for determining the pitch radius r2, but there is no need to measure the displacement of both sheaves.
      <br/>
      To provide some safety margin, the calculated pressure Pset is preferably multiplied by a factor of, for example, 1.2 to guard against belt slippage while avoiding undue force on the belt which would shorten the life of the belt and the pulleys.
      <br/>
      Calculation of the set pressure Pset is accomplished by the suitably programmed microprocessor 19, given the measurements of IL, NG and Y1 and proceeds as follows:  (Equation image '2' not included in text)

      In the speed control loop 15, the set speed command signal is a constant, depending on the number of poles of the generator used and, for example, is selected to give a 400 cps revolution at the generator shaft in the case of a two pole generator, or a 200 cps revolution in the case of four pole machine.
      <br/>
      The generator speed is measured by a sensor 18, FIG. 1, and compared with the set output speed command.
      <br/>
      The sensor 18 also provides a generator speed signal to calculating unit 19.
      <br/>
      The unbalanced forces applied on the primary and secondary sheaves causes the continuously variable transmission ratio to change.
      <br/>
      Given a force applied on the secondary sheave, the speed control loop 15 will automatically adjust the force applied on the primary sheave to change the transmission ratio by way of ratio control valve 12 to match the generator speed to the speed command.
    </p>
    <p num="22">
      The continuously variable transmission 1' of FIGS. 4-6 employs the basic control arrangement described above in connection with the CVT 1 of FIGS. 1-3 as a constant speed drive for generating electricity.
      <br/>
      When driving an electric generator with the continuously variable transmission, if a large electrical load is suddenly applied to the generator, the torque generated at the generator would be transmitted almost immediately to the sheaves of the CVT, and if the pressures applied of the sheaves are not large enough, the belt will start to slip.
      <br/>
      It will take a little while for the pressure control loop 14 and the output speed control loop 15 to respond to the load change.
      <br/>
      The CVT 1' of FIGS. 4-6 includes two additional control aspects that are used in combination for preventing belt slippage in the transmission.
      <br/>
      The two control aspects to prevent the belt from slipping includes speeding up the response of the two control loops by feeding forward the load signal, and delaying the transmission of the load torque from the generator to the sheaves by installing a torque lagging apparatus in the transmission between the secondary pulley and the generator to insert a lag in the transmission.
    </p>
    <p num="23">
      More particularly, the CVT 1' FIGS. 4-6 includes a load feed-forward control loop 25 for feeding back a load signal, proportional to the load torque of the generator 3 on the transmission, to each of the hydraulic pressure control loop 14 and the output speed control loop 15 to speed up the responses thereof with a sudden increase in the load torque for preventing transmission belt slippage.
      <br/>
      The load feed-forward control loop 25 comprises a lead-lag network 26 through which the load signal is passed before being applied to the hydraulic pressure control loop and the output speed of the control loop.
      <br/>
      Adjustable gain elements 27 and 28 are provided for adjusting the gain of the load signal fed back to respective ones of the hydraulic pressure control loop and the output speed control loop as depicted in FIG. 4.
      <br/>
      This feed-forward control speeds up the response of both the control loops to the load change.
    </p>
    <p num="24">
      In the continuously variable transmission 1 of the embodiment of FIGS. 4-6 further includes a torque lagging apparatus 29 in the transmission between the secondary pulley 6 and the generator 3 to insert a lag in the transmission to allow the control loops 14 and 15 time to respond to a sudden increase in load torque of the generator on the transmission for preventing transmission belt slippage.
      <br/>
      In the disclosed form of the invention, the torque lagging apparatus 29 is in the form of an electrohydraulically controlled (or electro-magnetically controlled) clutch.
      <br/>
      A hydraulic pressure control loop 30 of the transmission 1' applies a hydraulic pressure to the clutch to allow clutch slippage upon a sudden increase in load torque for providing lag and load torque transmission.
    </p>
    <p num="25">
      The hydraulic clutch 29 comprises a plurality of driving and driven disks 31 and 32, respectively which are axially clamped adjacent one another by clutch actuactor 33 with a force control by a pressure control valve 34 of the hydraulic clutch pressure control loop 30.
      <br/>
      The pressure control valve 34 is preferably and electrically hydraulic pressure reducing valve as disclosed in the commonly owned, concurrently filed U.S. Pat. No. 6,126,138, although other pressure control valves could be employed.
      <br/>
      The pressure control valve 34 can be operated either open-loop or closed-loop.
      <br/>
      For closed-loop control as in the disclosed embodiment, a pressure sensor 35 is required for closing the loop.
      <br/>
      The pressure reference signal consists of two parts: one part (set clutch pressure) is proportional to the load signal, and the other proportional to the difference of the clutch input speed and output or generator speed detected by speed sensors 36 and 37, respectively.
      <br/>
      This latter part of the pressure reference signal is reduced to zero when the clutch is locked up.
      <br/>
      During constant load operation, only enough pressure is applied to the disks for the clutch 29 to transmit the load torque.
      <br/>
      For a sudden load increase, the clutch will start to slip until the clutch pressure control 30 catches up and the clutch locks up again.
      <br/>
      This action provides a lag in load torque transmission to the secondary pulley 6 of the CVT 1', which allows the CVT pressure control loop 14 to respond to the load torque change without allowing the belt to slip.
    </p>
    <p num="26">
      The hydraulic clutch pressure control loop 30 is shown schematically in FIG. 6.
      <br/>
      The clutch pressure is negatively fed back and substracted from the commanded or set clutch pressure and the difference between the clutch input speed and the generator speed is added to the set clutch pressure command.
    </p>
    <p num="27">
      A method of the invention for calculating the set clutch pressure command comprises measuring the load current and generator speed and, if necessary, the load voltage, and calculating a load torque using these load measurements.
      <br/>
      The set clutch pressure required to lock the clutch is then calculated.
      <br/>
      The calculation of set clutch pressure given the mesurements of load current and generator speed is carried out as follows.

      In a sense, the clutch 29 has a variable torque capacity depending on the pressure applied.

      During constant load operation, just enough pressure is applied for the clutch to transmit the load torque.
      <br/>

      <br/>
      This clutch slipping provides a lag in the transmission of the load torque to the CVT secondary pulley 6, thus allowing the CVT pressure control to catch up with the load so that the slipping of the belt 5 in the CVT can be prevented.
      <br/>
      Studies have shown that the combination of the aforementioned features of the present invention are effective for preventing slipping, even in the case of a sudden increase of load torque of the generator on the transmission.

      While only a preferred embodiment of the invention has been disclosed herein it is apparent that various modifications and alterations of the invention may be made.
      <br/>
      For example, the aforementioned two control aspects of the invention can be used independently, as well as in combination as in the disclosed embodiment.
      <br/>
      It is therefor the intention in the appended claims to cover all such modifications and alterations as may fall within the spirit and scope of the invention.
