    <heading>TECHNICAL FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="1">The present invention relates to a polyester resin composition having excellent flame-retardance and heat shock property, and it also relates to an insert molded article having excellent flame-retardance and heat shock property, obtained by an insert-molding of the polyester resin composition with a metal or an inorganic solid.</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">
      The insert molding method is a molding method in which a metal or inorganic solid (hereinafter, abbreviated as metals) is embedded in a resin for utilizing the property of the resin and the material property of the metals.
      <br/>
      It is applied in wide fields such as automobile parts and electric and electronic parts, and presently one of general molding methods.
      <br/>
      However, since expansion and shrinkage coefficient (so-called liner expansion coefficient) are extremely different between a resin and metals, molded articles having thin resin portions, portions with large variation in thickness or sharp corners composed of metals, suffer from a lot of troubles such as cracking just after molding and cracking by temperature change in use.
      <br/>
      Particularly in the case of electric and electronic parts, since high flame-retardance is also required, thermosetting resins such as phenol resins and epoxy resins are widely used for an insert molding.
    </p>
    <p num="3">However, thermosetting resins have disadvantages such as lower productivity due to a long molding cycle and low recycling property, so that substitution with thermoplastic resins is required eagerly.</p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="4">
      The present inventors have intensively studied, in view of the above-described problems, to obtain a thermoplastic resin for insert molding, having excellent flame-retardance, not cracking by temperature change and having excellent heat shock property, and which can be suitably used for electric and electronic parts in particular.
      <br/>
      As a result, it has been found that a composition, mainly comprising a thermoplastic polyester resin and containing an impact resistance giving agent, inorganic filler, flame-retardant and aromatic ester compound compounded therein, is excellent in flame-retardance and heat shock property, and that an insert molded article prepared by using this composition has sufficient flame-retardance as electric and electronic parts and simultaneously sufficient heat shock resistance causing no crack by common temperature change, whereby completing the present invention.

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="8">
      The present invention will be described in detail below.
      <br/>
      First, the thermoplastic polyester resin (A), which is a base resin in the present invention, is a polyester obtained by, for example, polycondensation of a dicarboxylic acid compound with a dihydroxy compound, polycondensation of an oxycarboxylic acid compound, and polycondensation of ternary compounds thereof, and may be any of homopolyesters and copolyesters.
      <br/>
      Examples of the dicarboxylic acid compound constituting the thermoplastic polyester resin (A) herein used include known dicarboxylic acids such as terephthalic acid, isophthalic acid, naphthalene dicarboxylic acid, diphenyl dicarboxylic acid, diphenyl ether dicarboxylic acid, diphenylethane dicarboxylic acid, cyclohexane dicarboxylic acid, adipic acid and sebacic acid, and alkyl-, alkoxy- or halogen-substituted compounds thereof.
      <br/>
      These dicarboxylic acid compounds can also be used for polymerization in the form of ester-formable derivatives, for example, lower alcohol esters such as a dimethyl ester.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      Then, examples of the dihydroxy compound constituting the thermoplastic polyester resin (A) of the present invention include hydroxy compounds such as ethylene glycol, propylene glycol, butane diol, neopentyl glycol, hydroquinone, resorcin, dihydroxyphenyl, naphthalene diol, dihydroxyphenyl ether, cyclohexane diol, 2,2-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)propane and diethoxylated bisphenol A, polyoxyalkylene glycol and alkyl-, alkoxy- or halogen-substituted compounds thereof, and one or more of them can be added.
      <br/>
      Examples of the oxycarboxylic acid compound include oxycarboxylic acids such as oxybenzoic acid, oxynaphthoic acid and diphenyleneoxycarboxylic acid, and alkyl-, alkoxy- or halogen-substituted compounds thereof.
      <br/>
      Further, ester-formable derivatives of these compounds can also be used.
      <br/>
      In the present invention, one or more of these compounds are used.
      <br/>
      In addition to the above-described compounds, polyesters having a branched or cross-linked structure obtained by using a small amount of a trifunctional monomer, such as, trimellitic acid, trimesic acid, pyromellitic acid, pentaerythritol and trimethylolpropane, may be used.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      In the present invention, any of thermoplastic polyesters produced by polycondensation using the above-described compounds as monomer components, can be used as the component (A) of the present invention, and they are used alone or in combination of two or more.
      <br/>
      Preferably, is used a polyalkylene terephthalate, further preferably a polybutylene terephthalate and copolymers including such terephthalate as the main component.
      <br/>
      In the present invention, thermoplastic polyesters may be modified according to a known method such as cross-linking and graft polymerization.
    </p>
    <p num="11">
      Representative examples of the impact resistance giving agent (B) used in the present invention, thermoplastic elastomers and core-shell polymers are cited.
      <br/>
      These thermoplastic elastomers are a generic name of the polymer substances which can be melt-mixed with thermoplastic polyester resins because they are solids having rubber-like elasticity at normal temperature, but heating them decreases the viscosity thereof.
    </p>
    <p num="12">The kind of the thermoplastic elastomer is not particularly restricted, and olefin-, styrene-, polyester-, polyamide- and urethane-based elastomers are listed, for example.</p>
    <p num="13">
      Preferable as the olefin-based elastomer are copolymers mainly comprising ethylene and/or propylene, and specific examples thereof include, but are not limited to, an ethylene-propylene copolymer, ethylene-butene copolymer, ethylene-octene copolymer, ethylene-propylene-butene copolymer, ethylene-propylene-diene copolymer, ethylene-ethyl acrylate copolymer, ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer and ethylene-glycidyl methacrylate copolymer.
      <br/>
      Among the olefin-based elastomers, preferably used are graft copolymers obtained by chemically bonding, either in branched or cross-linked structure, (a-1) an ethylene-unsaturated alkyl carboxylate copolymer or (a-2) an olefin-based copolymer composed of an  ALPHA -olefin and a glycidyl ester of an  ALPHA ,  BETA -unsaturated acid with one or more of (b) a polymer or copolymer mainly comprising a repeating unit represented by the following general formula (1):  (Chemical Structure image '1' not included in text)
    </p>
    <p num="14">(wherein, R represents hydrogen or a lower alkyl group, X represents one or more groups selected from --COOH, --COOCH3, --COOC2 H5, --COOC4 H9, --COOCH2 CH(C2 H5)C4 H9,  (Chemical Structure image '2' not included in text)</p>
    <p num="15">and --CN.)</p>
    <p num="16">
      Such graft copolymer particularly has an effect for improving heat shock property, and is particularly suitable as the impact resistance giving agent.
      <br/>
      Specific examples of the ethylene-unsaturated alkyl carboxylate copolymer (a-1) include random copolymers such as an ethylene-acrylic acid copolymer, ethylene-methacrylic acid copolymer, ethylene-acrylic acid-ethyl acrylate copolymer, ethylene-ethyl acrylate copolymer, ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer and ethylene-vinyl acetate-ethyl acrylate copolymer, and further, these copolymer can also be mixed for use.
      <br/>
      As  ALPHA -olefin which is one monomer constituting the olefin-based copolymer (a-2), ethylene, propylene and butene-1 are listed, and ethylene is preferably used.
      <br/>
      The glycidyl ester of an  ALPHA ,  BETA -unsaturated acid which is another monomer constituting the component (a-2) is a compound represented by the following general formula (2) and examples thereof include glycidyl acrylate, glycidyl methacrylate and glycidyl ethacrylate, and particularly glycidyl methacrylate is preferably used.  (Chemical Structure image '3' not included in text)
    </p>
    <p num="17">(wherein, R1 represents hydrogen or a lower alkyl group.)</p>
    <p num="18">
      An  ALPHA -olefin (for example, ethylene) and a glycidyl ester of an  ALPHA ,  BETA -unsaturated acid can be copolymerized usually by a well-known radical polymerization reaction to obtain a copolymer (a-2).
      <br/>
      The segment (a-2) is suitably constituted of 70 to 99% by weight of  ALPHA -olefin and 30 to 1% by weight of a glycidyl ester of an  ALPHA ,  BETA -unsaturated acid.
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      Then, the polymer or copolymer (b) to be graft-polymerized with the olefin-based copolymer (a-1) or (a-2) is a homopolymer constituted of one of the repeating unit represented by the general formula (1) or a copolymer constituted of two or more repeating units represented by the general formula (1).
      <br/>
      Examples thereof include polymethyl methacrylate, polyethyl acrylate, polybutyl acrylate, poly2-ethylhexyl acrylate, polystyrene, polyacrylonitrile, acrylonitrile-styrene copolymer, butyl acrylate-methyl methacrylate copolymer and butyl acrylate-styrene copolymer, and a butyl acrylate-methyl methacrylate copolymer is particularly preferable.
      <br/>
      These polymers or copolymers (b) are also prepared by radical polymerization of corresponding vinyl-based monomers.
    </p>
    <p num="20">
      The graft copolymer used in the present invention has its feature that the above-described olefin-based copolymer (a-1) or (a-2) or the (co)polymer (b) is not used alone but it is a graft copolymer having a branched or cross-linked structure in which the copolymer (a-1) or (a-2) is chemically bonded with the (co)polymer (b) at least via one point, and, by forming a graft structure, a remarkable effect can be obtained as describe later which is not obtained simply by compounding the component (a-1), (a-2) or (b) alone.
      <br/>
      Here, it is suitable that the ratio of the component (a-1) or (a-2) to (b) for constituting a graft copolymer is from 95:5 to 5:95 (by weight), preferably from 80:20 to 20:80.
    </p>
    <p num="21">
      The production of the graft copolymer used in the present invention may be conducted by any generally well-known method such as a chain transfer method and an ionizing radiation irradiating method.
      <br/>
      However, most preferable is a grafting reaction of polymers each other, in which a grafted precursor, prepared by copolymerizing a monomer of the component (b) with a radical (co)polymerizable organic peroxide is melt kneaded in a main chain component particle.
      <br/>
      The reason for this is that grafting efficiency is high and secondary coagulation by heat does not occur, leading more effective manifestation of abilities.
    </p>
    <p num="22">
      As the styrene-based elastomer, block copolymers composed of a polymer block mainly comprising a vinyl aromatic compound such as styrene and a polymer block mainly comprising a conjugated diene compound not hydrogenated and/or hydrogenated are listed.
      <br/>
      The vinyl aromatic compound constituting such block copolymer is at least one member selected from the group consisting of styrene,  ALPHA -methylstyrene, vinyltoluene, p-tert butylstyrene, divinylenzene, p-methylstyrene and 1,1-diphenylstyrene, and among them, styrene is preferable.
      <br/>
      The conjugated diene compound is at least one member selected from the group consisting of butadiene, isoprene, 1,3-pentadiene, 2,3-dimethyl-1,3-butadiene, pyrelyrene, 3-butyl-1,3-octadiene, phenyl-1,3-butadiene, and among them, butadiene, isoprene and combinations thereof are preferable.
      <br/>
      The block copolymer herein referred to is a block copolymer composed of a polymer block A mainly comprising a vinyl aromatic compound and a polymer block B mainly comprising a conjugated diene compound, and the copolymerization ratio of the vinyl aromatic compound to the conjugated diene compound is from 5/95 to 70/30, particularly preferably from 10/90 to 60/40.
    </p>
    <p num="23">
      The number-average molecular weight of the block copolymer used in the present invention is in the range from 5000 to 600000, preferably from 10000 to 500000, and the molecular weight distribution �ratio of weight-average molecular weight (Mw) to number-average molecular weight (Mn)� is 10 or less.
      <br/>
      The molecular structure of the block copolymer may be any of linear, branched, radial, or combinations thereof.
      <br/>
      Examples thereof include vinyl aromatic compound-conjugated diene compound block copolymers having a structure such as A-B-A, B-A-B-A, (A-B-)4 Si and A-B-A-B-A.
      <br/>
      Further, the unsaturated bond of the conjugated diene compound of the block copolymer may be partially hydrogenated.
    </p>
    <p num="24">
      As the method for producing the block copolymer used in the present invention, any can be adopted providing a copolymer having the above-described structure is obtained.
      <br/>
      For example, according to methods described in JP-B Nos. 40-23798, 43-17979 and 56-28925, vinyl aromatic compound-conjugated diene compound block copolymers can be synthesized in an inert solvent using a lithium catalyst and the like.
      <br/>
      Further, according to methods described in JP-B Nos. 42-8704, 43-6636 and 59-133203, hydrogenation can be conducted in the presence of a hydrogenation catalyst in an inert solvent to obtain partially hydrogenated block copolymers to be used in the present invention.
    </p>
    <p num="25">
      The above-described block copolymer can be epoxidized to obtain an epoxy-modified block copolymer usable in the present invention.
      <br/>
      The epoxy-modified block copolymer in the present invention can be obtained by reacting the above-described block copolymer with an epoxydizing agent such as hydroperoxides and peracids, in an inert solvent.
      <br/>
      The hydroperoxides include hydrogen peroxide, tertiary butyl hydroperoxide and cumene peroxide.
      <br/>
      The peracids include performic acid, peracetic acid, perbenzoic acid and pertrifluoroacetic acid.
      <br/>
      Among them, peracetic acid is a preferable epoxidizing agent because it is produced industrially in large amount, available cheaply, and highly stable.
    </p>
    <p num="26">
      A catalyst can be used if necessary in the epoxidation.
      <br/>
      For example, in the case of a peracid, an alkali such as sodium carbonate and an acid such as sulfuric acid can be used as the catalyst.
      <br/>
      Further, in the case of hydroperoxides, a mixture of tungstic acid with sodium hydroxide can be used together with hydrogen peroxide, or molybdenum hexacarbonyl can be used together with tertiary butyl hydroperoxide to obtain catalytic effect.
      <br/>
      The amount of the epoxidizing agent is not regulated strictly, and the optimum amount in each case is determined by a variable factor such as each epoxidizing agent used, degree of epoxidation desired and each block copolymer used.
    </p>
    <p num="27">
      The inert solvent can be used for the purpose of reducing the viscosity of a raw material, stabilizing an epoxidizing agent by dilution, and the like.
      <br/>
      In the case of a peracetic acid, aromatic compounds such as ethers and esters can be used.
      <br/>
      Particularly preferable solvents are hexane, cyclohexane, toluene, benzene, ethyl acetate, carbon tetrachloride and chloroform.
      <br/>
      The epoxidation reaction condition is not strictly regulated.
      <br/>
      The reaction temperature range which can be used is determined by the reactivity of an epoxidizing agent used.
      <br/>
      For example, in the case of a peracetic acid, the reaction temperature is preferably from 0 to 70 (degree)  C. At 0 (degree)  C. or lower, the reaction is slow, and at 70 (degree)  C. or higher, decomposition of the peracetic acid occurs.
      <br/>
      In the tertiary butyl hydroperoxide/molybdenum dioxide diacetyl acetate system which is one example of hydroperoxide, a preferable temperature range is from 20 to 150 (degree)  C. due to the same reason.
      <br/>
      Specific treatment of the reaction mixture is not required, and for example, the mixture may advantageously be stirred for 2 to 10 hours.
      <br/>
      Isolation of the resulted epoxy-modified copolymer can be conducted by a suitable method, for example, a method in which precipitation is effected from a poor solvent, a method in which a polymer is put into hot water with stirring and the solvent is removed by distillation and a method in which a solvent is removed directly.
    </p>
    <p num="28">
      The epoxy equivalent of the above-described epoxy-modified block copolymer is preferably from 140 to 2700 g/mol, and particularly preferably from 200 to 2000 g/mol.
      <br/>
      When the epoxy equivalent is over 2700 g/mol, compatibility is not sufficient, and phase separation tends to occur.
      <br/>
      On the other hand, when less than 140 g/mol, particularly a side reaction of a gelled substance and the like tends to occur in isolation of a polymer, undesirably.
    </p>
    <p num="29">Examples of the polyester-based elastomer include, but are not limited to, block copolymers comprising a hard segment composed of an aromatic polyester such as polyethylene terephthalate and polybutylene terephthalate, and a soft segment composed of a polyether such as polyethylene glycol and polytetramethylene glycol or of an aliphatic polyester such as polyethylene adipate, polybutylene adipate and polycaprolactone.</p>
    <p num="30">Examples of the polyamide-based elastomer include, but are not limited to, block copolymers composed of a hard segment comprising nylon 6, nylon 66, nylon 11 or nylon 12 and a soft segment comprising a polyether or an aliphatic polyester.</p>
    <p num="31">Examples of the urethane-based elastomer include, but are not limited to, block copolymers comprising a hard segment composed of a polyurethane obtained by reacting a diisocyanate such as 4,4'-diphenylmethane diisocyanate, 4,4'-dicyclohexylmethane diisocyanate, tolylene diisocyanate and hexamethylene diisocyanate with a glycol such as ethylene glycol and tetramethylene glycol, and a soft segment composed of a polyether such as polyethylene glycol, polypropylene glycol and polytetramethylene glycol or of an aliphatic polyester such as polyethylene adipate, polybutylene adipate and polycaprolactone.</p>
    <p num="32">
      On the other hand, the core shell polymer is a core shell type graft copolymer having a multi-layer structure and preferably in which a rubber layer having an average particle size of 1.0  MU m or less is wrapped with a vitreous resin.
      <br/>
      The rubber layer of the core shell type copolymer has an average particle size of 1.0  MU m or less, and preferable range is from 0.2 to 0.6  MU m. If the average particle size of the rubber layer is over 1.0  MU m, the effect for improving impact resistance property may be insufficient.
      <br/>
      As the rubber layer of this core shell type copolymer, those obtained by copolymerization/graft copolymerization of a silicon-based, diene-based or acrylic elastomer singly or two or more elastomer components selected from them can be used.
    </p>
    <p num="33">
      The silicon-based elastomer is produced by polymerizing an organosiloxane monomer, and examples of the organosiloxane used include hexamethyltricyclosiloxane, octamethylcyclosiloxane, decamethylpentacyclosioxane, decamethylhexacyclosiloxane, trimethyltriphenylsiloxane, tetramethylphenylcyclotetrasiloxane and octaphenylcyclotetrasiloxane.
      <br/>
      The acrylic rubber is obtained by polymerizing an acrylate such as butyl acrylate and a small amount of cross-linkable monomer such as butylene diacrylate.

      <br/>
      An example of the diene-based rubber includes a polybutadiene obtained by polymerizing a butadiene monomer.

      For the shell layer formed with a vitreous resin of the core shell type copolymer, a vinyl-based copolymer is used.
      <br/>
      The vinyl-based polymer is obtained by polymerizing or copolymerizing at least one monomer selected from the group aromatic vinyl monomers, vinyl cyanide monomer, methacrylate monomers and acrylate monomers.
      <br/>
      The rubber and shell layers of such a core shell type copolymer are usually bonded by graft copolymerization.
      <br/>
      This graft copolymerization is accomplished by, if necessary, adding a graft crossing agent, which reacts with the shell layer in polymerizing the rubber layer, to impart a reactive group to the rubber layer, then, by forming the shell layer.
      <br/>
      As the graft crossing agent, in the case of the silicone-based rubber, an organosiloxane having a vinyl bond or an organosiloxane having a thiol is used.
      <br/>
      Preferably, acryloxysiloxane, methacryloxysiloxane and vinylsiloxane are used.

      Further, for enhancing the effect of a flame-retardant if necessary, generally known flame-retardant aids can be added.
      <br/>
      For example, metal oxides and hydroxides such as antimony trioxide, antimony tetraoxide, antimony pentaoxide, sodium antimonate, tin dioxide, aluminum hydroxide and magnesium hydroxide, may be used.
      <br/>
      Particularly, when a bromine-based flame-retardant is used, antimony compounds such as antimony trioxide, antimony tetraoxide, antimony pentaoxide and sodium antimonate are suitable as the flame-retardant aid.
      <br/>
      The flame-retardant aid can be used alone or in combination of two or more.

      The amount compounded of the flame-retardant of the component (D) in the present invention is from 1 to 25% by weight in the composition, and preferably from 5 to 20% by weight, more preferably from 10 to 20% by weight.
      <br/>
      When the amount is too small, sufficient flame-retardance cannot be obtained, and when too large, heat shock resistance is deficient.
      <br/>
      Also, when a flame-retardant aid is used together, the total amount of both components is preferably in the above-described range.
    </p>
    <p num="43">
      Depending on use of a molded article, "V-0" of flame-retardance section in UL standard 94 may be required.
      <br/>
      In this case, it is preferable to use, for example, asbestos and fluorine-based resins together with a flame-retardant.
      <br/>
      The fluorine-based resin includes homo or copolymers of fluorine-containing monomers such as tetrafluoroethylene, chlorotrifluoroethylene, vinylidene fluoride, hexafluoropropylene and perfluoroalkyl vinyl ether; and copolymers of the above-described fluorine-containing monomers with copolymerizable monomers such as ethylene, propylene and (meth)acrylate.
      <br/>
      Examples of such fluorine-based resin include homopolymers such as polytetrafluoroethylene, polychlorotrifluoroethylene and polyvinylidene fluoride; and copolymers such as tetrafluoroethylene-hexafluopropylene copolymer, tetrafluoroethylene-perfluoroalkyl vinyl ether copolymer, ethylene-tetrafluoroethylene copolymer and ethylene-chlorotrifluoroethylene copolymer.
      <br/>
      These fluorine-based resins can be used alone or in combination of two or more.
      <br/>
      Further, these fluorine-based resins can be used in the form of sizing condition.
      <br/>
      The addition amount of the fluorine-based resin is, for example, from about 0.1 to 10 parts by weight, preferably from 0.1 to 5 parts by weight, further preferably from 0.2 to 1 part by weight, to 100 parts by weight of the thermoplastic polyester resin.

    <p num="46">
      Particularly when n is 3 or more, heat resistance is high, more preferably.
      <br/>
      As the component (E), for example, trimellitate and pyromellitate are listed as preferable examples.
      <br/>
      As the alkyl group constituting this alkyl ester, trioctyl group, triisodecyl group, tris(2-ethylhexyl) group and tributyl group are listed, and the above-described alkyl ester is constituted of at least one of these alkyl groups.
      <br/>
      These aromatic polyvalent carboxylates can be used alone or in combination.

      The amount compounded of the aromatic polyvalent carboxylate (E) in the present invention is from 0.1 to 10% by weight in the composition, and preferably from 0.5 to 7% by weight, particularly preferably from 1 to 5% by weight.
      <br/>
      When the amount is too low, heat shock property is not sufficient, and when too high, problems occur non-preferably such as deterioration of physical properties, e.g., rigidity, and bleeding of an aromatic ester onto the surface of a molded article.

      In the present invention, other thermoplastic resin components can also be used accessorily in a small amount, in addition to the above-described components, depending on the object.
      <br/>
      The other thermoplastic resin herein used may be any resin providing it is stable at higher temperatures.
      <br/>
      For example, polyamides, polycarbonates, polyphenylene sulfide, polyphenylene oxide, polyacetal, acrylonitrile-styrene resin, acrylonitrile-butadien-styrene resin, polysulfone, polyether sulfone, polyether imide, and polyether ketone.

    <p num="54">The following examples further illustrate the present invention in detail but do no limit the scope thereof.</p>
    <p num="55">The measuring methods for evaluating physical properties shown in the following examples are as described below.</p>
    <p num="56">Oxygen Index</p>
    <p num="57">
      This was measured according to JIS K 7201.
      <br/>
      The oxygen index indicates the oxygen concentration necessary for continuous burning of a specimen for 3 minutes or longer or for burning 50 mm or more of the specimen.
      <br/>
      Higher value thereof means higher flame-retardance.
    </p>
    <p num="58">Heat Shock Resistance</p>
    <p num="59">
      Pellets of a resin composition were insert-injection-molded into a mold for specimen (a mold having a prism of length 22 mm, width 22 mm and height 51 mm into which an iron core of length 18 mm, width 18 mm and height 30 mm is inserted) at a cylinder temperature of 250 (degree)  C., a mold temperature of 70 (degree)  C., an injection time of 20 seconds and a cooling time of 10 seconds, so that the minimum thickness of some resin portions was 1 mm, to produce an insert molded article (test piece).
      <br/>
      After molding, the test piece was heated at 140 (degree)  C. for 1.5 hours using a heat shock chamber, then, cooled down to -40 (degree)  C. and kept for 1.5 hours, then, heated to 140 (degree)  C. again.
      <br/>
      The heat shock test was conducted in which the above-mentioned heat, cool and heat steps were effected as one cycle.
      <br/>
      The numbers of the cycle until cracking occurred in 10 test pieces were measured, and the average was regarded as heat shock life, and heat shock property was evaluated.
      <br/>
      Higher value of the heat shock life indicates higher heat shock property.

      If either one of an impact resistance giving agent or an aromatic polyvalent carboxylate is added, heat shock resistance is somewhat improved, but is not sufficient (Comparative Examples 3 to 11).
