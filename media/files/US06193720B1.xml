    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="6">
      The present invention is an apparatus for retaining first and second vertebrae of a spinal column in a desired spatial relationship.
      <br/>
      The apparatus comprises a pair of longitudinal members positionable along the spinal column.
      <br/>
      A first plate is connectable to the first vertebra and interconnects the pair of longitudinal members.
      <br/>
      First fastener means is engageable with the first plate for connecting the first plate to the first vertebra.
      <br/>
      The first fastener means has a threaded end portion for engaging the first vertebra.
      <br/>
      A second plate is connectable to the second vertebra and interconnects the longitudinal members.
      <br/>
      Second fastener means is engageable with the second plate for connecting the second plate to the second vertebra.
      <br/>
      The second fastener means has a threaded end portion for engaging the second vertebra.
      <br/>
      The apparatus is implantable in the body so that, after implantation, the apparatus is entirely within the body.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      In accordance with one feature of the present invention, the first and second vertebrae are cervical vertebrae.
      <br/>
      The first plate has an inner side surface for facing an anterior surface of the first cervical vertebra.
      <br/>
      The second plate has an inner side surface for facing an anterior surface of the second cervical vertebra.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      In accordance with another feature of the present invention, the apparatus includes means for blocking movement of the first plate, which is the lower plate, relative to the longitudinal members.
      <br/>
      The second plate, which is higher on the spine than the first plate, is movable relative to the longitudinal members along longitudinal axes of the longitudinal members.
      <br/>
      Since the second plate is movable relative to the longitudinal members, the second vertebra to which the plate is connected is movable relative to the longitudinal members.
      <br/>
      Thus, bone graft located adjacent the second vertebra carries a load as the bone and bone graft grow together.
    </p>
    <p num="9">In accordance with another feature of the present invention, the apparatus includes means for blocking movement of both the first plate and the second plate relative to the longitudinal members.</p>
    <p num="10">
      The present invention is also a method of retaining first and second vertebrae of a spinal column in a desired spatial relationship.
      <br/>
      The method comprises the steps of providing a pair of longitudinal members; interconnecting the longitudinal members with a first plate and a second plate; positioning the first plate on the first vertebra with an inner side surface of the first plate facing an anterior surface of the first vertebra while the first plate interconnects the pair of longitudinal members; and positioning the second plate on the second vertebra with an inner side surface of the second plate facing an anterior surface of the second vertebra while the first plate interconnects the pair of longitudinal members.
      <br/>
      The method also includes the steps of connecting the first plate to the first vertebra by engaging the first plate with a first fastener and threading an end portion of the first fastener into the first vertebra, and connecting the second plate to the second vertebra by engaging the second plate with a second fastener and threading an end portion of the second fastener into the second vertebra.

      The method comprises the steps of positioning a first plate on a first vertebra with an inner side surface of the first plate facing a surface of the first vertebra; positioning a second plate on the second vertebra with an inner side surface of the second plate facing a surface of the second vertebra; and providing a pair of longitudinal members extending between the first and second plates and extending along the spinal column.
      <br/>
      The method also includes the steps of connecting the first plate to the first vertebra by engaging the first plate with first fastener means and threading an end portion of the first fastener means into the first vertebra; connecting the second plate to the second vertebra by engaging the second plate with second fastener means and threading an end portion of the second fastener means into the second vertebra; and enabling one of the first and second plates to move along the spinal column relative to the pair of longitudinal members and relative to the other one of the first and second plates.

    <heading>DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
    <p num="13">
      The present invention relates to an apparatus and method for retaining vertebrae of a spinal column in a desired spatial relationship.
      <br/>
      The apparatus includes a pair of longitudinal members in the form of rods which are positionable along the spinal column.
      <br/>
      The apparatus also includes at least a pair of members in the form of plates for interconnecting the rods.
      <br/>
      Each plate is secured to a respective vertebra by either two or three screws.
      <br/>
      One of the plates may be a dynamic plate--that is, a plate which is movable relative to the rods when the plate is connected with its associated vertebra.
      <br/>
      An apparatus which includes a dynamic plate can allow relative movement between vertebrae which are connected by the apparatus.
    </p>
    <p num="14">
      The present invention is illustrated in association with cervical vertebrae of a human spinal column.
      <br/>
      It should be understood that vertebrae other than cervical vertebrae of a human spinal column may be retained with the apparatus and method of the present invention.
    </p>
    <p num="15">
      As representative of the present invention, FIGS. 1-11 illustrate apparatus which includes rods interconnected by a pair of plates each secured to a respective vertebra by three screws.
      <br/>
      Specifically, FIG. 1 illustrates an apparatus 10 for use in retaining bone portions such as cervical vertebrae V1 and V2 of a human spinal column C in a desired stabilized spatial relationship.
      <br/>
      The spinal column C has an axis A which is a vertical axis of the human body.
    </p>
    <p num="16">
      The apparatus 10 includes a pair of surgically implantable rods 12 and 14 (FIGS. 1 and 2).
      <br/>
      The apparatus 10 also includes first and second members or plates 30 and 32 which engage the rods 12 and 14; three fasteners 38, 40, and 42 for connecting the first plate with the first vertebra V1; and three fasteners 44, 46, and 48 for connecting the second plate with the second vertebra V2.
    </p>
    <p num="17">
      The first rod 12 (FIG. 1) is made of a suitable biocompatible material, such as titanium or stainless steel.
      <br/>
      The first rod 12 has an elongate cylindrical configuration and has a circular cross-section taken in a plane extending perpendicular to the longitudinal central axis of the first rod.
      <br/>
      The first rod 12 has a smooth outer surface.
      <br/>
      A first end portion of the first rod 12 is formed as a cap 50.
      <br/>
      The first rod 12 also has a second end portion 52 opposite from the first end portion 50.
      <br/>
      The rod 12 has a uniform diameter of about three (3) millimeters throughout its extent except at the cap 50.
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      The second rod 14 is identical to the first rod 12.
      <br/>
      The second rod 14 has a first end portion which is formed as a cap 54.
      <br/>
      The second rod 14 also has a second end portion 56 opposite from the first end portion 54.
      <br/>
      The rods 12 and 14 are bendable to a desired configuration to conform to a desired curvature of the spinal column C. The rods 12 and 14 together have sufficient strength and rigidity to maintain the vertebrae V1 and V2 in a desired spatial relationship.
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      The rods 12 and 14 have a length which is sufficient to enable the rods to span at least the two vertebrae V1 and V2.
      <br/>
      The length of the rods 12 and 14 will depend upon the condition to be corrected and the number of vertebrae to be held in a desired spatial relationship relative to each other by the apparatus 10.
      <br/>
      If more than two vertebrae are to be held in a desired spatial relationship relative to each other by the apparatus 10, the rods 12 and 14 would be longer and more than two plates, such as the plates 30 and 32, may be used.
    </p>
    <p num="20">
      The first plate 30 (FIGS. 5 and 6) is made of a suitable biocompatible material, such as titanium or stainless steel.
      <br/>
      The first plate 30 includes a main body portion 60.
      <br/>
      The main body portion 60 of the first plate 30 has a planar outer side surface 62 for facing anteriorly or away from the first vertebra V1.
      <br/>
      The first plate 30 has an arcuate inner side surface 64 for facing posteriorly or toward the first vertebra V1.
      <br/>
      The inner side surface 64 of the first plate 30 may engage the anterior surface of the first vertebra V1 when the first plate is connected with the first vertebra as described below.
    </p>
    <p num="21">
      The main body portion 60 of the first plate 30 has a central portion 66 which extends laterally between a first side portion 68 and a second side portion 70 of the first plate.
      <br/>
      Because the inner side surface 64 of the first plate 30 has an arcuate configuration, the central portion 66 of the first plate is relatively thin (as viewed in a direction from left to right in FIG. 3) as compared to the first side portion 68 and to the second side portion 70.
    </p>
    <p num="22">
      The main body portion 60 of the first plate 30 also has first and second end portions 72 and 74.
      <br/>
      The first end portion 72 of the first plate 30 includes a planar first end surface 76 of the first plate 30.
      <br/>
      The second end portion 74 includes a planar second end surface 78 of the first plate 30.
      <br/>
      The second end surface 78 extends parallel to the first end surface 76.
    </p>
    <p num="23">
      A first rod passage 80 is formed in the first side portion 68 of the first plate 30.
      <br/>
      The first rod passage 80 is an opening which extends between the first and second end surfaces 76 and 78 of the first plate 30 in a direction parallel to the planar outer side surface 62 of the first plate.
      <br/>
      The first rod passage 80 is defined by a cylindrical surface 81 and tapered pilot surfaces 83 and 84 at opposite ends of the cylindrical surface 81.
      <br/>
      The diameter of the cylindrical surface 81 is slightly greater than the diameter of the first rod 12, so that the first rod and the first plate 30 can be relatively movable.
    </p>
    <p num="24">
      The second side portion 70 of the first plate 30 is a mirror image of the first side portion 68.
      <br/>
      A second rod passage 82 is formed in the second side portion 70 of the first plate 30.
      <br/>
      The second rod passage 82 is an opening which extends between the first and second end surfaces 76 and 78 of the first plate 30 in a direction parallel to the planar outer side surface 62 of the first plate.
      <br/>
      The second rod passage 82 extends parallel to the first rod passage 80.
      <br/>
      The second rod passage 82 is defined by a cylindrical surface 85 and tapered pilot surfaces 86 and 87 at opposite ends of the cylindrical surface 85.
      <br/>
      The diameter of the second rod passage 82 is the same as the diameter of the first rod passage 80.
      <br/>
      The diameter of the cylindrical surface 85 is slightly greater than the diameter of the second rod 14, so that the second rod and the first plate 30 can be relatively movable.

      The sleeve 300 of the fastener 40 is threaded into the drilled opening in the vertebra V1 in a known manner (not shown) to fix the sleeve in position in the vertebra V1.

      <br/>
      When the expander 310 is fully screwed into the sleeve 300, the inner end portion 344 of the expander 310 causes the shank portion 302 of the sleeve to expand radially outward, helping to lock the sleeve in place in the vertebra V1.
      <br/>
      When the expander 310 is fully screwed into the sleeve 300, the head portion 340 of the expander 310 engages the head portion 314 of the sleeve 300.
      <br/>
      The head portion 340 of the expander 310 wedges the locking segments 326 on the sleeve 300 radially outward into engagement with the first plate 30 to rigidly lock the fastener 40 in position relative to the first plate.

      As can be seen in FIG. 2, the fastener 40 (as well as the fastener 42, not shown in FIG. 2) extends at an angle (upward as viewed in FIG. 2) to the lip 150.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, when the fasteners 40 and 42 are tightened into the first vertebra V1, the fasteners tend to draw the lip 150 of the first plate 30 tightly against the surface 360 of the vertebra, that is, in an upward direction as viewed in FIG. 2.
      <br/>
      At the same time, the fasteners 40 and 42, as well as the fastener 38, tend to draw the main body portion 60 of the first plate 30 tightly against the anterior surface of the first vertebra V1, that is, in a direction to the left as viewed in FIG. 2.

      The fact that there are three screws which secure each one of the plates 30 and 32 to the spinal column C also helps to maintain proper placement of the plates.
      <br/>
      These features help the apparatus 10 maintain the vertebrae V1 and V2 in place when the cervical spine is subjected to various degrees of motion of the human head.
    </p>
    <p num="87">
      When the second plate 32 is being connected with the second vertebra V2, the outer fasteners 46 and 48 secure the second plate and the second vertebra.
      <br/>
      The fasteners 46 and 48 also serve to interlock the second plate 32 with the rods 12 and 14.
      <br/>
      This is because the locking segments 326 on the sleeves 300 of the fasteners 46 and 48 (FIG. 4) move radially outward into engagement with the rods 12 and 14, respectively, when each fastener's expander is fully screwed into the fastener's sleeve.
      <br/>
      The engagement between the fasteners 46 and 48 and the rods 12 and 14 blocks movement of the fasteners 46 and 48 relative to the rods.
      <br/>
      The radial movement of the locking segments 326 of the fasteners also causes the rods to be clamped against the cylindrical surfaces 181 and 185 which define the rod passages 180 and 182, respectively in the second plate 32.
      <br/>
      As a result, the expanded fasteners 46 and 48 block movement of the second plate relative to the rods 12 and 14.
    </p>
    <p num="88">
      The first plate 30, in contrast, is movable relative to the rods 12 and 14, because the second and third fastener openings 110 and 130 are spaced apart from the rod passages 80 and 82.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the first plate 30 is movable relative to the second plate 32.
    </p>
    <p num="89">
      Accordingly, the first vertebra V1 is movable vertically downward relative to the second vertebra V2.
      <br/>
      This relative movement allows for the maintaining of a load on bone graft placed between the vertebrae V1 and V2.
      <br/>
      If the first plate 30 were not movable vertically downward relative to the second plate 32, then the distance between the vertebrae V1 and V2 would be fixed.
      <br/>
      If bone graft were placed between the vertebrae V1 and V2 and the bone graft resorbed sufficiently, the bone graft could possibly shrink out of engagement with one or both of the vertebrae V1 and V2.
      <br/>
      Allowing relative movement of the plates 30 and 32 can help to maintain a load on bone graft placed between the vertebrae V1 and V2 and maintains the vertebrae in contact with the bone graft to facilitate bone growth.
      <br/>
      The lips 150 and 250 on the plates 30 and 32 are, preferably, configured so that the lips do not contact bone graft placed between the vertebrae.
    </p>
    <p num="90">
      The caps 50 and 54 on the rods 12 and 14, respectively, limit movement of the first vertebra V1 in a direction away from the second vertebra V2.

      It may not be necessary or desirable, in some circumstances, to use a dynamic (movable) plate such as the plate 30.
      <br/>
      In such circumstances, two locking plates identical to the plate 32 can be used in the same apparatus 10.
      <br/>
      Such a system is illustrated in FIG. 9.
      <br/>
      The upper plate 32 (FIG. 9) is fixed in position relative to the vertebra V1 and to the rods 12 and 14.
      <br/>
      The lower plate 32 (FIG. 9) is fixed in position relative to the vertebra V2 and to the rods 12 and 14.

      Accordingly, the apparatus 10 (FIG. 9) blocks relative movement between the vertebrae V1 and V2.

    <p num="92">
      Since the rods 12 and 14 are located at the opposite sides of the plates 30, 32 where the plates curve around the vertebra, the rods 12 and 14 may have a relatively larger diameter, than if the rods 12 and 14 were otherwise located, without creating an excessively high profile for the apparatus 10.
      <br/>
      This minimizes the chance of contact between the apparatus 10 and parts of the body such as the esophagus.
      <br/>
      Also, since the fasteners are located between the rods, the fasteners are more easily installed than if the fasteners were otherwise located, for example, if the rods were located between the fasteners.

      As a result, the set screws 370, the rods 12 and 14, and the plate 30a are interlocked.

      The plate 30a is not movable relative to (along the length of) the rods 12 and 14.
      <br/>
      Because the plate 30a is fixed to its associated bone portion, then the bone portion also is not movable relative to the rods 12 and 14.

      Each of the fasteners 422 (FIGS. 16 and 17) which secure the plate 414 to a vertebra V includes a sleeve 490 and an expander 492 located within the sleeve.
      <br/>
      Each fastener 422 has a longitudinal central axis 493.
      <br/>
      The sleeve 490 has an axially extending central opening 494 for receiving the expander 492.
      <br/>
      The sleeve 490 includes a coarse external helical thread convolution 496 for engaging a vertebra V.
    </p>
    <p num="113">
      The sleeve 490 (FIG. 17) has a head end portion 498 with a part spherical outer side surface 500.
      <br/>
      The head end portion 498 of the sleeve 490 is radially and axially slotted to define four segments 504 (FIG. 12) of the head end portion 498.
      <br/>
      The four segments 504 are movable radially inward and outward relative to each other so that the head end portion 498 is expandable and collapsible.
      <br/>
      The radially and axially extending slots in the head end portion 498 receive a driving tool for threading the sleeve 490 into a vertebra V. An end portion 508 (FIG. 17) of the sleeve 490 opposite from the head end portion 498 is radially and axially slotted to permit radially outward expansion of the end portion 508.
      <br/>
      The head end portion 498 of the fastener 422 has a surface 548 facing away from the end portion 508.
    </p>
    <p num="114">
      The opening 494 of the sleeve 490 has a first diameter located along a central portion 510 of the sleeve 490 and a second diameter smaller than the first diameter located adjacent the end portion 508.
      <br/>
      The sleeve 490 has an internally threaded portion 512 between the central portion 450 and the head end portion 498.
      <br/>
      The head end portion 498 has a conical-shaped surface 514 that tapers from a larger diameter to a smaller diameter adjacent another conical-shaped surface 516.
      <br/>
      The surface 516 interconnects the surface 514 and the threaded portion 512.
      <br/>
      The surface 516 tapers from the larger diameter adjacent the surface 514 to the smaller diameter of the threaded portion 512.
    </p>
    <p num="115">
      The expander 492 has a rod-shaped portion 520 for extending into the opening 494.
      <br/>
      The rod portion 520 has a diameter which is approximately equal to the diameter of the opening 494 in the central portion 510 of the sleeve 490.
      <br/>
      The rod portion 520 engages the interior of the end portion 508 of the sleeve 490 and causes the end portion 508 to expand and help retain the fastener 422 in the vertebra V.
    </p>
    <p num="116">
      The expander 492 has a head end portion 521 with an x-shaped driver slot for receiving a driving tool for rotating the expander relative to the sleeve 490.
      <br/>
      The head end portion 522 has a tapering surface 524 for engaging the tapering surface 514 of the sleeve 490.
      <br/>
      The expander 492 includes a threaded portion 526 for threadably engaging the threaded portion 512 of the expander 490.
      <br/>
      The tapering surface 524 of the expander 492 engages the tapering surface 514 of the sleeve 490 to move the four segments 504 radially outward.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the head end portion 498 of the sleeve 490 expands.
    </p>
    <p num="117">
      The member or plate 414 (FIGS. 16-18) is made of a suitable biocompatible material, such as titanium or stainless steel.
      <br/>
      The plate 414 includes a surface 530 for engaging an anterior surface of the vertebra V and a surface 532 opposite from the surface 530 for facing away from the vertebra V. The plate 414 has generally parallel rod openings 534 for receiving the rods 410.
      <br/>
      The plate 414 has a pair of fastener openings 538 for receiving the fasteners 422 located adjacent side surfaces 536 of the plate 414.
      <br/>
      The openings 538 have axes 539 extending at an angle to each other.
    </p>
    <p num="118">
      Each fastener opening 538 is partially defined by a part spherical surface 540 (FIGS. 17-21) centered on the axis 539.
      <br/>
      The part spherical surface 540 defines a seat or recess in the opening 538 against which the part spherical surface 500 of the sleeve 490 engages.
    </p>
    <p num="119">
      The part spherical recess 540 has a major diameter 542.
      <br/>
      A first portion 544 of the recess 540 is located on one side of the major diameter 542 and adjacent the surface 532 of the plate 414.
      <br/>
      A second portion 546 of the recess 540 is located on the other side of the major diameter 542 and adjacent the surface 530 of the plate 414.
    </p>
    <p num="120">
      When the plate 414 is to be connected to a vertebra V, the plate 414 is placed on the vertebra V with the surface 530 engaging the anterior portion of the vertebra V and the rods 410 extending through the openings 534.
      <br/>
      The sleeves 490 are threaded into the vertebra V through the openings 538 in the plate 414.
      <br/>
      As the head end portion 498 of the sleeve 490 enters the opening 538 in the plate 414 the segments 504 are compressed radially inward then expand radially outward.
      <br/>
      The surfaces 548 on the head end portions 498 are located in the first portions 544 of the recesses 540 when the head end portions 498 are received in the recesses.
      <br/>
      Because the major diameter 542 of each recess 540 is spaced inward from the outer surface 532 of the plate 414, the expanded fasteners 422 resist movement out of the recesses in the plate.
    </p>
    <p num="121">
      The expander 492 is threaded into the sleeve 490 and causes the head end portion 498 to expand into engagement with the opening 538 and prevent relative movement between the plate 414 and the fastener 422.
      <br/>
      The engagement of the part spherical surfaces 500 of the sleeves 490 with the part spherical surfaces 540 of the openings 538, enables the fasteners 422 to have a plurality of positions in which the axis 493 of each fastener 422 extends at an angle to the axis 539 of its associated opening 538 in any direction.
      <br/>
      Preferably, the axis 493 of each fastener 422 can be positioned at a maximum of approximately 10 (degree)  in any direction relative to the axis 539 of its associated opening 538.
      <br/>
      Three alternative positions are shown in FIGS. 19-21.
    </p>
    <p num="122">
      The fasteners 422 secure the plate 414 to the vertebra V. However, the plate 414 is movable relative to the rods 410.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, the vertebra V connected to the plate 414 is movable relative to the rods 410 along the longitudinal axes of the rods.
    </p>
    <p num="123">
      Accordingly, the vertebra V corrected to the plate 414 is movable vertically downward toward the vertebra that the plate 412 is connected to.
      <br/>
      This relative movement allows for the maintaining of a load on bone graft placed between the vertebrae V. If the plate 414 was not movable relative to the plate 412, then the distance between the vertebrae V would be fixed.
      <br/>
      If a bone graft is placed between the vertebrae V and the bone graft resorbed sufficiently, the bone graft could possibly shrink out of engagement with one or both of the vertebrae V. Allowing relative movement of the plates 412 and 414 can help to maintain a desired load on bone graft placed between the vertebrae V and maintain the vertebrae in contact with the bone graft to facilitate bone growth.
    </p>
    <p num="124">
      It may not be necessary, in some circumstances, to use a dynamic (movable) plate such as the plate 414.
      <br/>
      In such circumstances, two plates identical to the plate 412 can be used in the same apparatus.
      <br/>
      Such a system is illustrated in FIG. 22.
    </p>
    <p num="125">
      In FIG. 22 a pair of surgically implantable rods 560 are connected to anterior portions of cervical vertebrae V of a spinal column C by a pair of identical plates or members 562.
      <br/>
      The plates 562 are identical to the plates 412 illustrated in FIGS. 12-14 and will not be described in detail.
      <br/>
      The plates 562 are connected to the vertebrae V by fasteners 564.
      <br/>
      The fasteners 564 are identical to the fasteners 420 illustrated in FIGS. 12-14 and will not be described in detail.
      <br/>
      The fasteners 564 also fix the rods 560 relative to the plates 562 to prevent relative movement between the rods and the plates.
      <br/>
      The apparatus illustrated in FIG. 22 prevents relative movement between the vertebrae V since the plates 562 and rods 560 are prevented from moving relative to each other by the fasteners 564.
    </p>
    <p num="126">
      FIG. 23-26 illustrate several embodiments which include one plate secured to one vertebra by two screws and another plate secured to another vertebra by three screws.
      <br/>
      Specifically, FIG. 23 illustrates an apparatus 600 which includes a 2-screw plate 412 which is the same as the plate 412 described in detail with reference to FIGS. 12-22. The plate 412 is fastened to the vertebra V1 with a pair of fasteners 40.
      <br/>
      The fasteners 40 (FIG. 23) are the same as the fasteners which are described in detail with reference to FIGS. 1-11. The fasteners 40 (FIG. 23) have head end portions which are expanded into engagement with the rods 12 and 14.
      <br/>
      As a result, the plate 412 is blocked from movement relative to the rods 12 and 14, when the plate is secured to the vertebra V1.
    </p>
    <p num="127">
      The apparatus 600 also includes a plate 32 which is the same plate which is described in detail with reference to FIGS. 1-8. The plate 32 is fastened to the vertebra V2 with three fasteners 40.
      <br/>
      The fasteners 40 are the same as the fasteners which are described in detail with reference to FIGS. 1-11. The fasteners 40 (FIG. 23) have head end portions which are expanded into engagement with the rods 12 and 14.
      <br/>
      As a result, the plate 32 is blocked from movement relative to the rods 12 and 14, when the plate is secured to the vertebra V2.
    </p>
    <p num="128">
      Therefore, when the apparatus 600 is installed on the spinal column C, both plates 32 and 412 are fixed in position relative to the rods.
      <br/>
      Both vertebrae V1 and V2 are thus fixed in position relative to the rods 12 and 14.
      <br/>
      This blocks relative movement between the vertebrae V1 and V2.

    <p num="129">
      FIG. 24 illustrates an apparatus 610 in which the relative positions of the plates 412 and 32 are reversed as compared to the positions of the plates in FIG. 20. The apparatus 610 (FIG. 24) is, otherwise, identical to the apparatus 600 (FIG. 23).
      <br/>
      As a result, the apparatus 610 blocks relative movement between the vertebrae V1 and V2.

    <p num="130">
      FIG. 25 illustrates an apparatus 620 which includes a plate 414 which is the same as the plate 414 described in detail with reference to FIGS. 12-22. The plate 414 is fastened to the vertebra V1 with a pair of fasteners 422.
      <br/>
      The fasteners 422 (FIG. 25) are the same as the fasteners 422 which are described in detail with reference to FIGS. 12-22. The fasteners 422 have head end portions which do not engage the rods 12 and 14.
      <br/>
      As a result, the plate 414 is movable relative to the rods 12 and 14, when the plate is secured to the vertebra V1.
    </p>
    <p num="131">
      The apparatus 620 also includes a plate 32 which is the same plate which is described in detail with reference to FIGS. 1-8. The plate 32 is fastened to the vertebra V2 with three fasteners 40.

      Therefore, when the apparatus 620 is installed on the spinal column C, the plate 414 is movable relative to the plate 32.

      This allows relative movement between the vertebrae V1 and V2.
