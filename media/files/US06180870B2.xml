      Field of the Invention
    </p>
    <p num="2">This invention relates to a photovoltaic device such as a solar cell or a sensor, having a plurality of pin structures superposingly formed.</p>
    <p num="3">2. Related Background Art</p>
    <p num="4">Thin-film photovoltaic devices making use of amorphous semiconductors in photovoltaic layers have advantages such that large-area films can be produced as compared with single-crystal photovoltaic devices, films can be formed in a smaller thickness and the films can be deposited on any substrate materials, and are considered to be promising.</p>
    <p num="5">As a means for improving photoelectric conversion efficiency of the photovoltaic devices making use of amorphous semiconductors, it is attempted, e.g., to incorporate germanium to thereby narrow the band gap to make the sensitivity to long-wavelength light higher.</p>
    <p num="6">
      However, semiconductor materials called amorphous silicon germanium have commonly often caused a decrease in photoconductivity with an increase in the content of germanium.
      <br/>
      In particular, amorphous silicon germanium containing 35 atm % or more of germanium has often caused a remarkable decrease in photoconductivity.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, for photovoltaic devices making use of largely germanium-containing amorphous silicon germanium in i-type semiconductor layers, it has been difficult to attain a high photoelectric conversion efficiency.
    </p>
    <p num="7">This is considered due to the fact that localized levels in the band gap increase with an increase in the content of germanium to cause an increase in tail-state levels at the conduction band ends and valence electron band ends, resulting in a short diffusion length of electrons and holes.</p>
    <p num="8">
      As another method for improving photoelectric conversion efficiency of the photovoltaic devices, U.S. Pat. No. 2,949,498 discloses use of what is called a stacked cell in which a plurality of photovoltaic devices having a unit device structure are superposed.
      <br/>
      The stacked cell is a cell in which devices having different band gaps are superposed to absorb every part of spectra of sunlight in a good efficiency so that the photoelectric conversion efficiency can be improved, and is so designed that the band gap in what is called the bottom layer, which is positioned beneath what is called the top layer, positioned on the light-incident side of the superposed devices, is narrower than the band gap in the top layer.
      <br/>
      This enables good absorption of spectra of sunlight to bring about an improvement in photoelectric conversion efficiency; see K. Miyachi et al., Proc. 11th, E.C. Photovoltaic Solar Energy Conf., Montreux, Switzerland, 88, 1992, or K. Nomoto et. al., "a-Si Alloy Three-Stacked Solar Cells with High Stabilized Efficiency", 7th Photovoltaic Science and Engineering Conf., Nagoya, 275, 1993.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      However, amorphous silicon and amorphous silicon germanium have the problem of a lowering of film quality as a result of irradiation with light, i.e., what is called the Stebler-Ronskie effect.
      <br/>
      This is a phenomenon peculiar to amorphous semiconductors, which is not seen in crystal systems.
      <br/>
      Hence, under existing circumstances, they have a poor reliability when used for electric-power purpose, which is an obstacle to their practical application.
    </p>
    <p num="10">Meanwhile, in recent years, studies are made on not only stacked cells of an amorphous/amorphous system but also those of an amorphous/crystalline system, and improvements in photoelectric conversion efficiency of photovoltaic devices are reported; see Hamakawa, Y et al.

L. et al., "The DOE/SERI Polycrystalline Thin-film Subcontract Program", Proceedings of 20th IEEE Photovoltaic Specialists Conference, pp. 1469-1476, September 1988.</p>
    <p num="11">However, taking account of the balance of electric currents generated by light in the stacked cells, the cell on the light-incident side (having a broad band gap) must be made to have a larger thickness, causing a problem that photo-deterioration may greatly occur when films have a large thickness.</p>

    <heading>DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
    <p num="16">(1) The photovoltaic device of the present invention has a plurality of pin structures, comprised of a first pin structure, a second pin structure and a third pin structure in the order from the light-incident side, each having an i-type semiconductor layer, and is characterized in that the i-type semiconductor layer of the first pin structure comprises amorphous silicon, the i-type semiconductor layer of the second pin structure comprises microcrystalline silicon and the i-type semiconductor layer of the third pin structure comprises amorphous silicon germanium or microcrystalline silicon germanium.</p>
    <p num="17">
      This is based on a finding that a triple type photovoltaic device having pin structures superposed in three sets may less cause photo-deterioration than a double type photovoltaic device having pin structures superposed in two sets.
      <br/>
      When semiconductor materials of the same type are used, the triple type device is considered to cause less electric currents generated by light per each pin structure than the double type device, resulting in a decrease in the recombination of holes and electrons that causes the photo-deterioration of amorphous semiconductors.
    </p>
    <p num="18">In the following description, the first, second and third pin structures in the order from the light-incident side are often called a top cell, a middle cell and a bottom cell, respectively.</p>
    <p num="19">The microcrystalline silicon is more sensitive to light with a long wavelength than amorphous silicon, and hence the device has a construction wherein the i-type semiconductor layer of the top cell has amorphous silicon and the i-type semiconductor layer of the middle cell has microcrystalline silicon so that the top cell absorbs light with a relatively short wavelength and the middle cell absorbs light with a relatively long wavelength.</p>
    <p num="20">
      The i-type semiconductor layer of the bottom cell has amorphous silicon germanium, whereby the bottom cell can be made more sensitive to light with a long wavelength than the middle cell.
      <br/>
      Also, the i-type semiconductor layer of the bottom cell may have microcrystalline silicon germanium, whereby the bottom cell can be made sensitive to light with a much longer wavelength and can be made to less cause photo-deterioration.
    </p>
    <p num="21">
      Since the middle cell i-type semiconductor layer has microcrystalline silicon, the middle cell also can be made to less cause photo-deterioration.
      <br/>
      In the case where amorphous silicon germanium is used in the bottom cell, it has been found that the middle cell i-type semiconductor layer may preferably have a layer thickness of from 300 nm to 2,200 nm, and more preferably from 500 nm to 2,000 nm.
      <br/>
      In the case where microcrystalline silicon germanium is used in the bottom cell, it has been also found that the middle cell i-type semiconductor layer may preferably have a layer thickness of from 500 nm to 2,500 nm, and more preferably from 600 nm to 2,200 nm.
    </p>
    <p num="22">
      If the layer thickness is smaller than the above lower limit, the electric current generated by light may be so little that the photoelectric conversion efficiency required as the triple cell may lower.
      <br/>
      If it is larger than the above upper limit, the electric current generated in the middle cell can be sufficient but the amount of the light entering the bottom cell may decrease, so that the electric current generated in the bottom cell may become too little to make adjustment of electric current values of the respective cells, resulting in a low photoelectric conversion efficiency.
    </p>
    <p num="23">
      The top cell i-type semiconductor layer may preferably have a layer thickness of from 50 nm to 250 nm, and more preferably from 70 nm to 150 nm.
      <br/>
      In the case where amorphous silicon germanium is used in the bottom cell, it has been found that the bottom cell i-type semiconductor layer may preferably have a layer thickness of from 60 nm to 250 nm, and more preferably from 80 nm to 180 nm.
      <br/>
      In the case where microcrystalline silicon germanium is used in the bottom cell, it has been found that the bottom cell i-type semiconductor layer may preferably have a layer thickness of from 200 nm to 2,000 nm.
    </p>
    <p num="24">
      (2) The i-type semiconductor layer microcrystalline silicon in the middle cell may be incorporated with a trace amount of boron.
      <br/>
      Thus, the hole mobility at the time of generation of electric current by light can be improved to thereby maintain a high photoelectric conversion efficiency while preventing photo-deterioration.
      <br/>
      The boron may be incorporated in an amount of not more than 8 ppm.
      <br/>
      Thus, the growth of microcrystals of the microcrystalline silicon is not inhibited and the film quality can be prevented from lowering because of any excess inert boron.
    </p>
    <p num="25">
      (3) An n-type semiconductor layer of the middle cell may have microcrystalline silicon or a laminated structure formed of microcrystalline silicon and amorphous silicon.
      <br/>
      This has been found to be effective for the following:
    </p>
    <p num="26">1) The microcrystalline silicon of the i-type semiconductor layer formed on the n-type layer can be formed at a high deposition rate, so that inclusion of any impurities can be prevented as far as possible and good-quality microcrystalline silicon can be formed.</p>
    <p num="27">2) The microcrystalline silicon of the i-type semiconductor layer formed on the n-type layer can be formed in a state of little amorphous components from the initial stage of deposition, and hence good-quality microcrystalline silicon can be formed.</p>
    <p num="28">3) The microcrystalline silicon of the i-type semiconductor layer formed on the n-type layer can be deposited at a much higher temperature than the deposition substrate temperature having been hitherto studied, and hence further good-quality microcrystalline silicon can be formed.</p>
    <p num="29">4) At the initial stage for depositing the microcrystalline silicon of the i-type semiconductor layer formed on the n-type layer, the n-type semiconductor layer can be made to be less damaged by hydrogen ions and so forth, so that a high photoelectric conversion efficiency with less photo-deterioration can be maintained.</p>
    <p num="30">
      (4) The amorphous silicon germanium of the i-type semiconductor layer of the bottom cell may preferably have a germanium content of from 45 atom % to 90 atom %, and more preferably from 48 atom % to 75 atom %. This makes smaller the band gap of the amorphous silicon germanium and makes it possible to utilize light with longer wavelengths.
      <br/>
      Hence, the values of electric current generated can be maintained even when the bottom cell has a small layer thickness.
    </p>
    <p num="31">
      In the case where the i-type semiconductor layer of the bottom cell is microcrystalline silicon germanium, the microcrystalline silicon germanium may preferably have a germanium content of from 40 atom % to 90 atom %, and more preferably from 45 atom % to 75 atom %, and may preferably have a light absorption coefficient at 800 nm, of 10,000 cm-1 or above.
      <br/>
      This enables utilization of light with much longer wavelengths.
    </p>
    <p num="32">
      (5) A buffer layer comprised of an amorphous silicon layer or amorphous silicon carbon layer may be provided between p-type layer and i-type layer of the bottom cell.
      <br/>
      This makes diffusion potential of the pin structure larger to bring about an improvement in the open current voltage (Voc) of the photovoltaic device.
      <br/>
      The buffer layer may be further provided between n-type layer and i-type amorphous silicon germanium layer, whereby the photoelectric conversion efficiency can be more improved.
    </p>
    <p num="33">
      The buffer layer may preferably have a layer thickness of from 30 angstroms to 450 angstroms, and more preferably from 50 angstroms to 350 angstroms.
      <br/>
      Even when the buffer layer having such a measure of layer thickness is provided, there is almost no increase in the rate of photo-deterioration of the photovoltaic device.
    </p>
    <p num="34">
      (6) The germanium content in the amorphous silicon germanium layer may be changed in the layer thickness direction in such a manner that the germanium content is set maximum at a position not deeper than 1/4 of the layer thickness of the whole amorphous silicon germanium layer as measured from the interface of the buffer layer on the p-type layer side.
      <br/>
      This brings about an improvement in open current voltage (Voc) and fill factor (FF).
    </p>
    <p num="35">
      In amorphous semiconductors, in respect of electrons and holes produced by light, the holes are considered to have a shorter diffusion length than the electrons and rate-determine the whole characteristics, so that photocarriers are largely distributed in the vicinity of the p-type layer when the band gap of the amorphous silicon germanium is changed in the layer thickness direction so that the position at which the band gap is minimum is set in the vicinity of the p-type layer, than when the band gap is present uniformly in the layer thickness direction.
      <br/>
      With regard to the holes in the photocarriers, the distance of their movement in the i-type semiconductor layer becomes shorter.
      <br/>
      Thus, these are considered to bring about an improvement in the fill factor (FF).
    </p>
    <p num="36">It is also considered that the band gap of amorphous silicon germanium may be continuously changed so that the valence electron band has a gradation, whereby the diffusion of holes in the photocarriers can be promoted to improve the open current voltage (Voc) and fill factor (FF) of the photovoltaic device.</p>
    <p num="37">The present invention will be described in greater detail with reference to the accompanying drawings.</p>

      FIG. 1 diagrammatically illustrates a cross section of a stack type photovoltaic device according to the present invention.
      <br/>
      The stack type photovoltaic device shown in FIG. 1 has a structure wherein three pin structures are superposed in layers.
      <br/>
      Reference numeral 150 denotes a first pin structure (top cell); 140, a second pin structure (middle cell); and 130, a third pin structure (bottom cell); which are in the order from the light-incident side.
      <br/>
      These three pin structures are superposed on a back electrode 101 formed on a substrate 100 and a transparent electrode 115 and a collector electrode 116 are formed at the uppermost part of the three pin structures to form the stack type photovoltaic device.
    </p>
    <p num="39">These pin structures are respectively comprised of n-type semiconductor layers 103, 109 and 112, i-type semiconductor layers 104(a buffer layer), 105, 106 (a buffer layer), 110 and 113 and p-type semiconductor layers 107, 111 and 114.</p>
    <p num="40">In the present invention, amorphous silicon is used as the i-type semiconductor layer 113 of the first pin structure, microcrystalline silicon is used as the i-type semiconductor layer 110 of the second pin structure and amorphous silicon germanium or microcrystalline silicon germanium is used as the i-type semiconductor layer 105 of the third pin structure.</p>
    <p num="41">
      FIG. 2 illustrates a photovoltaic device having the same construction as the one shown in FIG. 1, except that the n-type semiconductor layer of a second pin structure 240 has a laminated structure formed of an n-type amorphous semiconductor 208 and an n-type microcrystalline semiconductor 209.
      <br/>
      More specifically, reference numeral 250 denotes a first pin structure, and 230, a third pin structure; and reference numeral 200 denotes a substrate; 201, a back electrode; 202, a diffusion preventive layer; 203, 209 and 212, n-type semiconductor layers; 204, 205, 206, 210 and 213, i-type semiconductor layers (204 and 206, buffer layers); and 207, 211 and 214, p-type semiconductor layers.

      Also, only one layer is provided as a buffer layer 306 of an i-type semiconductor layer 305.
      <br/>
      Others are constructed in the same manner as those shown in FIG. 1.
      <br/>
      More specifically, reference numeral 350 denotes a first pin structure, and 340, a second pin structure; and reference numeral 300 denotes a substrate; 301, a back electrode; 302, a diffusion preventive layer; 308 and 312, n-type semiconductor layers; 310 and 313, i-type semiconductor layers; and 307, 311 and 314, p-type semiconductor layers.
    </p>
    <p num="43">These devices may also have layer configurations wherein the n-type semiconductor layers and p-type semiconductor layers in the pin structures are replaced with one another.</p>
    <p num="44">The construction of the stack type photovoltaic device of the present invention will be further detailed below.</p>
    <p num="45">Substrate</p>
    <p num="46">
      Since the semiconductor layers 103 to 114 are thin films of about 3  MU m at most in total thickness, they are deposited on a suitable substrate.
      <br/>
      Such a substrate 100 may be either single-crystal or amorphous, and also may be either electrically conductive or electrically insulating.
      <br/>
      It may further be either light-transmitting or non-light-transmitting, but may preferably be free from deformation or strain and have a desired strength.
      <br/>
      It may specifically include thin sheets of metals such as Fe, Ni, Cr, Al, Mo, Au, Nb, Ta, V, Ti, Pt and Pb and alloys thereof as exemplified by bronze and stainless steel, and composites of these; films or sheets of heat-resistant resins such as polyester, polyethylene, polycarbonate, cellulose acetate, polypropylene, polyvinyl chloride, polyvinylidene chloride, polystyrene, polyamide, polyimide and epoxy, or composites of any of these with glass fiber, carbon fiber, boron fiber, metal fiber or the like; any of these materials subjected to surface coating by sputtering, vacuum deposition, plating or the like to cover their surfaces with a metal thin film formed of a different kind of material or an insulating thin film formed of SiO2, Si3 N4, Al2 O3, AlN3 or the like; and glasses, ceramics and so forth.
    </p>
    <p num="47">
      When the above substrate is used as a substrate for the photovoltaic device and when the substrate is made of an electrically conductive material such as a metal, it may serve as an electrode for directly collecting electric currents.
      <br/>
      When it is made of an electrically insulating material such as a synthetic resin, its surface on the side where deposited films are formed may preferably be previously surface-treated by plating, vacuum deposition or sputtering of a single metal, an alloy or a transparent conductive oxide (TCO), such as Al, Ag, Pt, Au, Ni, Ti, Mo, W, Fe, V, Cr, Cu, stainless steel, bronze, nichrome, SnO2, In2 O3, ZnO and ITO to form an electrode for collecting electric currents.
    </p>
    <p num="48">
      Of course, also when the substrate is made of the electrically conductive material such as a metal, a different kind of metal layer may be provided on the substrate on its side where the deposited films are formed, in order to, e.g., improve reflectance of long-wavelength light on the surface of the substrate and to prevent constituent elements from mutual diffusion between the substrate material and the deposited films.
      <br/>
      When the substrate is relatively transparent and the photovoltaic device has a layer configuration wherein the light is made incident on the side of the substrate, a conductive thin film such as the above transparent conductive oxide or metal thin film may preferably be previously formed by deposition.
    </p>
    <p num="49">
      With regard to the surface properties of the substrate, it may have a smooth surface, or may have a finely irregular surface.
      <br/>
      When the substrate has a finely irregular surface, it may have spherical, conical or pyramidical irregularities with their maximum height (Rmax) of preferably from 0.05  MU m to 2  MU m. This makes the reflection of light from the surface irregular to bring about an increase in optical path length of the reflected light.
      <br/>
      The substrate may have the shape of, e.g., a plate, a continuous-sheet belt or a cylinder.
      <br/>
      It may have a thickness as small as possible so long as the function as the substrate can be well exhibited, when the photovoltaic device is required to have a flexibility or when light is made incident on the side of the substrate.
      <br/>
      However, taking account of the production and handling of the substrate and in view of mechanical strength, it may usually have a thickness of at least 10  MU m.
    </p>
    <p num="50">Back Electrode or Light-Reflecting Layer</p>
    <p num="51">
      The back electrode (a metal layer) used in the present invention is an electrode provided on the back of the semiconductor layers against the light-incident direction.
      <br/>
      Hence, it is provided at the position of 101 in FIG. 1 or, in the case where the substrate 100 is transparent and the light is made incident on the side of the substrate, it is provided at the position of 115.
      <br/>
      Materials for the back electrode may include metals such as gold, silver, copper, aluminum, nickel, iron, chromium, molybdenum, tungsten, titanium, cobalt, tantalum, niobium and zirconium, or alloys such as stainless steel.
      <br/>
      In particular, metals having a high reflectance, such as aluminum, copper, silver and gold are particularly preferred.
      <br/>
      When the metals having a high reflectance are used, the back electrode can be made to serve also as a light-reflecting layer that reflects the light having not been completely absorbed in the semiconductor layers, to return to the semiconductor layers.
    </p>
    <p num="52">
      The back electrode may have a flat shape, and may more preferably have an irregular shape to cause the light to scatter.
      <br/>
      In the case of the back electrode having such light-scattering irregular shape, any long-wavelength light having not been completely absorbed in the semiconductor layers can be scattered to elongate optical paths in the semiconductor layers, so that the photovoltaic device can be improved in its sensitivity to long-wavelength light to increase short-circuit currents and can be improved in photoelectric conversion efficiency.
      <br/>
      As to the light-scattering irregular shape, the difference in height (Rmax) between hills and valleys of the irregularities may preferably be from 0.2  MU m to 2.0  MU m. When, however, the substrate serves also as the back electrode, it is unnecessary in some cases to form the back electrode.
    </p>
    <p num="53">
      The back electrode may be formed by vacuum deposition, sputtering, plating or printing.
      <br/>
      When the back electrode is formed to have the light-scattering irregular shape, the metal or alloy film thus formed may be dry-etched or wet-etched, or sand-blasted or heated, to form the irregularities.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, the above metal or alloy may be vacuum-deposited on the substrate while heating it to provide the light-scattering irregular shape.
    </p>
    <p num="54">
      A diffusion preventive layer (a transparent conductive layer) 102 formed of conductive zinc oxide or the like may also be provided between the back electrode 101 and the n-type semiconductor layer 103.
      <br/>
      The diffusion preventive layer 102 has the effect of not only preventing the metal elements constituting the back electrode 101 from their diffusion into the n-type semiconductor layer, but also, when endowed with a little resistance, preventing short from being caused by imperfections such as pinholes between the back electrode 101 and the transparent electrode 115 which are provided so as to hold the semiconductor layers between them, and also entrapping in the photovoltaic device the light made incident after multiple interference is caused by thin films.
      <br/>
      Its surface may preferably have an irregular shape.
    </p>
    <p num="55">i-Type semiconductor layer</p>
    <p num="56">
      In the photovoltaic device of the present invention, amorphous silicon is used as the semiconductor material constituting the i-type semiconductor layer 113 of the first pin structure, microcrystalline silicon is used as the semiconductor material constituting the i-type semiconductor layer 110 of the second pin structure, and amorphous silicon germanium or microcrystalline silicon germanium is used as the semiconductor material constituting the i-type semiconductor layer 105 of the third pin structure.

      In Example 9, to form the MW i-type layer 105 of the third pin structure, SiH4 gas flow rate and H2 gas flow rate were controlled by means of the corresponding mass flow controllers 456 and 458 so as to be 50 sccm and 1,500 sccm, respectively, and GeH4 gas flow rate was changed so as to range from 20 atom % to 60 atom %. Thus, a photovoltaic device was produced.
      <br/>
      The germanium content in the MW i-type layer 105 of the third pin structure was measured using IMF-4F (Trade name), manufactured by CAMECA Co.

      Results obtained are shown in Tables 16 and 17.

    <p num="298">When the germanium content in microcrystalline silicon germanium of the i-type semiconductor layer is in a content of 40 atom % or more, without regard to whether the GeH4 gas flow rate was constant or gradient, the i-type layer of the third pin structure had a band gap suited for absorbing long-wavelength light in the photovoltaic device of the present invention and sufficient electric currents were obtained in the third pin structure, thus improvements in efficiency were seen as a whole.</p>

      In the formation of the MW i-type layer 105, the microcrystalline silicon germanium layer, of the third pin structure, the flow rates of the film-forming gases SiH4 gas, GeH4 gas and H2 gas were changed to produce photovoltaic devices having different light absorption coefficients.
      <br/>
      The layer thickness was uniformed in 0.3  MU m in making measurement.

    <p num="304">
      As the substrate, a sheet-like substrate of 300 m long, 30 cm wide and 0.2 mm thick, having light-reflecting layers (a metal layer and a transparent conductive layer) was used.

      Then, under conditions shown in Table 8 for the other deposited layers, the triple type photovoltaic device was produced in the following way.
    </p>
    <p num="305">
      The sheet-like substrate having the light-reflecting layers was set in the load chamber 5010 for feeding the substrate.
      <br/>
      This sheet-like substrate was passed through all the deposition chambers and all the gas gates and connected to the sheet wind-up jig in the unload chamber 5150.

    </p>
    <p num="306">
      The substrate was heated by means of the substrate heater in each deposition system, and the degree of vacuum was controlled by adjusting the opening of the exhaust valve of each exhaust system.

      After the substrate temperature and degree of vacuum became stable, the substrate was started to be transported, and RF power or MW (frequency: 0.5 GHz, 2.45 GHz) power for generating plasma was supplied to each deposition chamber.
      <br/>
      In this way, the triple type photovoltaic device having the three pin structures superposed as shown in FIG. 1, was formed on the sheet-like substrate over a length of 100 m. In the formation of the i-type semiconductor layer of the second pin structure, microwave power (0.5 GHz) was applied.
