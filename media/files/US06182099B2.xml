      A multiple language input system of this invention includes input systems corresponding to a plurality of languages.
      <br/>
      This multiple language input system recognizes a target language in accordance with various pieces of information from an application or information set by an environment setting function in the multiple language input system.
      <br/>
      When the target language is Japanese, the system causes a Japanese processing section to perform Japanese input processing.
      <br/>
      When the target language is English, the system causes an English processing section to perform English input processing.
      <br/>
      When the target language is Chinese, the system causes a Chinese processing section to perform Chinese input processing.

    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="1">The present invention relates to a multiple language input system which can be applied to a document preparation apparatus using a personal computer and the like and, more particularly, to a multiple language input system capable of inputting a plurality of different languages.</p>
    <p num="2">This application is based on Japanese Patent Application No. 9-153582, filed on Jun. 11, 1997, the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.</p>
    <p num="3">
      In a document preparation apparatus implemented by electronic equipment such as a personal computer, a document is created by using a language input system.
      <br/>
      The language input system is software having functions required for language input processing and used together with a document preparation application (wordprocessor software).
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      Conventionally, such a language input system is provided for each language.
      <br/>
      For example, a Japanese input system is provided for the input of Japanese characters; an English input system, for the input of English characters; and a Chinese input system, for the input of Chinese characters.
      <br/>
      That is, a dedicated input system for each language is provided.
      <br/>
      When, therefore, a plurality of different languages are to be input, a plurality of types of language input systems must be prepared (installed in a hard disk unit) and properly switched and used every time each language is input.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      Such language input systems may have functions unique to the respective languages.
      <br/>
      For example, the Japanese input system has a kana/kanji conversion function of converting kana characters into kanji characters.
      <br/>
      The English input system has a spelling check function of checking whether input words are correctly spelled.
      <br/>
      The Chinese input system has a pin yin conversion function.
      <br/>
      Pin yin conversion corresponds to Japanese kana/kanji conversion.
      <br/>
      In pin yin conversion, Chinese characters are input phonetically with the English alphabet.
      <br/>
      Such functions unique to the respective languages may be required occasionally or essentially.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      Conventionally, therefore, when a plurality of different languages are to be input, a plurality of types of language input systems respectively having unique functions are required, and must be switched and used to input each language.
      <br/>
      A heavy load is therefore imposed on an unskilled user.
      <br/>
      When a document is to be created using a plurality of languages, in particular, the input systems for the respective languages must be frequently switched, resulting in difficulty in efficiently writing a document.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      The above spelling check function has been implemented as a function of an English document preparation application (European Language wordprocessor).
      <br/>
      For this reason, when the application is changed (from, e.g., the European Language wordprocessor to the Japanese wordprocessor), spelling check cannot be performed even though English words can be input on the changed application in the alphanumeric shift mode.

    <p num="29">The communication unit 17 controls data exchange with an external unit through a LAN (Local Area Network), a communication network, or the like.</p>
    <p num="30">The functions of the document preparation apparatus will be described next.</p>
    <p num="31">
      FIG. 2 is a block diagram showing the functional arrangement of the document preparation apparatus in FIG. 1.
      <br/>
      As shown in FIG. 2, the functions of the document preparation apparatus of this embodiment are roughly classified into a set of applications 20 and a multiple language input system 21.
    </p>
    <p num="32">
      The set of applications 20 implements a wordprocessor in the computer and includes three types, i.e., Japanese, English, and Chinese, of applications in this embodiment.
      <br/>
      Each application 20 slots a font, a format (vertical/horizontal writing), and the like in accordance with each language.
    </p>
    <p num="33">
      The multiple language input system 21 performs input processing for each language.
      <br/>
      As described above, to perform input processing for a plurality of languages, dedicated input systems for the respective languages, e.g., a Japanese input system, an English input system, and a Chinese input system, have been used.
      <br/>
      In contrast to this, according to the present invention, the multiple language input system 21 incorporates input systems for a plurality of languages, and internally switches and uses them.
      <br/>
      In this case, the multiple language input system 21 incorporates three types, i.e., Japanese, English, and Chinese, of input systems.
    </p>
    <p num="34">
      Note that the applications 20 and the multiple language input system 21 can be implemented by software.
      <br/>
      In this embodiment, the applications 20 and the multiple language input system 21 are installed in the external storage unit 15 in FIG. 1 and stored in the program area 12a of the memory 12 when the wordprocessor is activated.
      <br/>
      The CPU 11 loads the applications 20 and the multiple language input system 21 stored in the program area 12a and executes document preparation processing.
    </p>
    <p num="35">The functional arrangement of the multiple language input system 21 will be described below.</p>
    <p num="36">The multiple language input system 21 includes an input section 22, a control section 23, an automatic language recognition section 24, a Japanese processing section 25, a kana/kanji conversion dictionary 26, an English processing section 27, an English dictionary 28, a Chinese processing section 29, a Chinese dictionary 30, an output section 31, and an English spelling check section 32.</p>
    <p num="37">The input section 22 loads the data input in accordance with the operation of the input unit 13 which is performed by an operator, and sends it to the control section 23.</p>
    <p num="38">
      The control section 23 controls each processing section in accordance with the input data from the input section 22.
      <br/>
      In this case, the control section 23 performs switching control of the language modes in accordance with the language to be used for input (input target language).
      <br/>
      The language modes include three modes, namely a Japanese mode, an English mode, and a Chinese mode.
      <br/>
      That is, the control section 23 performs switching control to perform Japanese input processing using the Japanese processing section 25 in the Japanese mode; English input processing using the English processing section 27 in the English mode; and Chinese input processing using the Chinese processing section 29 in the Chinese mode.
      <br/>
      In addition, the control section 23 receives application information (setting information such as a font and format corresponding to each language and information indicating the application type) from the application 20, or sends information such as processing results to the application 20.
    </p>
    <p num="39">The automatic language recognition section 24 recognizes an input target language on the basis of information (setting information such as a font and format corresponding to each language and information indicating the application type) from the application 20 or the information set by an environment setting function on the multiple language input system 21 side (information about conditions and priority set for each language).</p>
    <p num="40">
      The Japanese processing section 25 corresponds to the Japanese input system.
      <br/>
      When Japanese characters are input, the Japanese processing section 25 performs kana/kanji conversion processing by referring to the kana/kanji conversion dictionary 26.
      <br/>
      When letters are input in the alphanumeric shift mode, the Japanese processing section 25 accesses the English spelling check section 32.
      <br/>
      This spelling check section 32 detects a spelling error by referring to the English dictionary 28.
      <br/>
      Word information required for kana/kanji conversion processing is stored in the kana/kanji conversion dictionary 26.
    </p>
    <p num="41">
      The English processing section 27 corresponds to the English input system, and performs English input processing (spelling check) by searching the English dictionary 28.
      <br/>
      English word information is stored in the English dictionary 28.
    </p>
    <p num="42">
      The Chinese processing section 29 corresponds to the Chinese input system.
      <br/>
      When Chinese characters are input, the Chinese processing section 29 performs pin yin conversion processing by referring to the Chinese dictionary 30.
      <br/>
      When letters are input in the alphanumeric shift mode, the Chinese processing section 29 accesses the English spelling check section 32.
      <br/>
      This spelling check section 32 detects a spelling error by referring to the English dictionary 28.
      <br/>
      Word information required for pin yin conversion processing is stored in the Chinese dictionary 30.
      <br/>
      Pin yin conversion processing corresponds to Japanese kana/kanji conversion processing.
    </p>
    <p num="43">The output section 31 displays the information managed on the multiple language input system 21 on the display unit 14.</p>
    <p num="44">Various windows displayed on the display unit 14 of this document preparation apparatus will be described next.</p>
    <p num="45">The English spelling check section 32 is a check section for checking whether English words are spelled correctly in the input mode for each language.</p>
    <p num="46">
      FIG. 3 shows an example of the window displayed when a Japanese sentence is input by using a Japanese font.
      <br/>
      In the Japanese mode, a Japanese input window 41 like the one shown in FIG. 3 is displayed.
      <br/>
      This Japanese input window 41 has a font type display portion 42 indicating the type of font currently set on the application 20 side, and an input mode display portion 43 indicating the input mode managed on the multiple language input system 21 side.

    <p num="50">
      FIG. 5 shows an example of the window displayed when an English sentence is input by using a European Language font.
      <br/>
      In the English mode, an English input window 61 like the one shown in FIG. 5 is displayed.
      <br/>
      This English input window 61 has a font type display portion 62 indicating the type of font currently set on the application 20 side, and an input mode display portion 63 indicating the input mode managed on the multiple language input system 21 side.
    </p>
    <p num="51">The window shown in FIG. 5 indicates "Century" as a font type, and "English input state" as an input mode.</p>
    <p num="52">
      FIGS. 6A and 6B show sample windows displayed before and after the format is changed to vertical writing.
      <br/>
      As shown in FIG. 6A, when the format on the application 20 side in the English mode is set to vertical writing, it is recognized that the input target language is Japanese.
      <br/>
      As a result, the English mode is switched to the Japanese mode, and the Japanese input window 41 like the one shown in FIG. 6B is displayed.
    </p>
    <p num="53">
      In this case, a vertical writing text box 71 is displayed in the Japanese input window 41, and the font type is switched to a Japanese font.
      <br/>
      That is, even in the window in which English characters are input in the English mode, the English mode is switched to the Japanese mode at the same time when the format is set to vertical writing.
    </p>
    <p num="54">
      FIGS. 7A and 7B show sample windows displayed before and after the application 20 for Japanese is switched to the application 20 for English.
      <br/>
      As described above, the set of applications 20 includes the applications 20 for Japanese, English, and Chinese.
      <br/>
      Assume that the application 20 for Japanese is used, and the Japanese input window 41 like the one shown in FIG. 7A is displayed.
      <br/>
      When the user switches the application 20 for Japanese to the application 20 for English, it is recognized that the input target language is English.
      <br/>
      As a result, the Japanese mode is switched to the English mode, and the displayed window is switched to the English input window 61 like the one shown in FIG. 7B.
    </p>
    <p num="55">
      FIGS. 8A to 8C show conditions for the recognition of target languages.
      <br/>
      In this document preparation apparatus, the user can arbitrarily set conditions for the recognition of target languages in advance by using the environment setting function on the multiple language input system 21 side.
      <br/>
      FIG. 8A shows the conditions for switching to the Japanese input mode.
      <br/>
      FIG. 8B shows the conditions for switching to the Chinese input mode.
      <br/>
      FIG. 8C shows the conditions for switching to the English input mode.
    </p>
    <p num="56">
      These set conditions are set in the automatic language recognition section 24.
      <br/>
      The automatic language recognition section 24 recognizes an input target language on the basis of these set conditions.
      <br/>
      If, for example, the Japanese Ming-Cho font is set, the input target language is recognized as Japanese.
      <br/>
      If the Chinese Ming-Cho font is set, the input target language is recognized as Chinese.
      <br/>
      If a European Language font (Century, Times New Roman, or the like) is set, the target language is recognized as English.
    </p>
    <p num="57">
      FIG. 9 shows the order of priority of the respective languages for a case in which an input target language cannot be determined.
      <br/>
      The user can arbitrarily set priorities for the respective languages by using the environment setting function on the multiple language input system 21 side.
      <br/>
      In the case shown in FIG. 9, the priories given to Japanese, English, and Chinese decrease in this order.
    </p>
    <p num="58">
      This priority information is set in the automatic language recognition section 24 like the above set conditions.
      <br/>
      When any specific target language cannot be determined, the automatic language recognition section 24 recognizes an input target language in accordance with the priority information.
      <br/>
      For example, this technique is effective when the conditions for switching to the Japanese input mode in FIG. 8A are the same as those set for switching to the English input mode in FIG. 8C.

      For example, in the default state, "Japanese Ming-Cho" is as a font type; and "horizontal writing", as a format.
    </p>
    <p num="69">
      When the default values of these pieces of information are notified to the multiple language input system 21 side, together with the application notification, the multiple language input system 21 receives these pieces of information, and sets them in the internal buffer mounted in the control section 23 (step S14).
      <br/>
      This buffer is implemented as the application information buffer of the memory 12, as shown in FIG. 1.
    </p>
    <p num="70">In this manner, when the application 20 is activated, the application identifier and the default values of various pieces of information are notified to the multiple language input system 21.</p>
    <p num="71">
      As described with reference to FIGS. 6A to 7B, every time the font or format is changed on the application 20 side, the application 20 notifies the multiple language input system 21 of the pieces of information set after the change.
      <br/>
      The multiple language input system 21 executes language recognition processing (to be described later) on the basis of these pieces of information.
    </p>
    <p num="72">
      Such notification is performed not only from the application 20 to the multiple language input system 21 but also from the multiple language input system 21 to the application 20.
      <br/>
      In this embodiment, when the format setting information obtained from the application 20 indicates vertical writing, the input target language is recognized as Japanese.
      <br/>
      In this case, if a font other than Japanese fonts is set on the application 20 side, the multiple language input system 21 notifies the application 20 of a message for switching to a Japanese font.
    </p>
    <p num="73">The above language recognition processing and automatic switching of target languages upon this processing will be described by describing first language recognition processing with reference to the flow chart of FIG. 15; and second language recognition processing with reference to the flow chart of FIG. 16.</p>
    <p num="74">
      As described above, language recognition processing is executed very time the application 20 is activated or the format or font is changed on the application 20.
      <br/>
      When the application 20 is activated, the multiple language input system 21 receives application information (pieces of font and format setting information corresponding to each language and an identifier indicating the application type) from the application 20.
      <br/>
      When the format or font is changed on the application 20, the resultant information is notified as application information.
    </p>
    <p num="75">The first language recognition processing in FIG. 15 will be described first.</p>
    <p num="76">
      The multiple language input system 21 checks on the basis of this application information whether a Japanese font is set (step S21).
      <br/>
      If the set font is the Japanese font (YES in step S21), the input target language is recognized as Japanese, and the corresponding information is set in the automatic language recognition section 24 (step S22).
      <br/>
      With this operation, the multiple language input system 21 executes input processing for an input character string by using the Japanese processing section 25.
    </p>
    <p num="77">
      If the set font is not the Japanese font (NO in step S21), the multiple language input system 21 checks in accordance with the application information whether a Chinese font is set (step S23).
      <br/>
      If the set font is the Chinese font (YES in step S23), the input target language is recognized as Chinese, and the corresponding information is set in the automatic language recognition section 24 (step S24).
      <br/>
      With this operation, the multiple language input system 21 executes input processing for an input character string by using the Chinese processing section 29.
    </p>
    <p num="78">
      If the set font is not the Chinese font (NO in step S23), the multiple language input system 21 recognizes the input target language as English, and sets the corresponding information in the automatic language recognition section 24 (step S25).
      <br/>
      With this operation, the multiple language input system 21 executes input processing for an input character string by using the English processing section 27.
    </p>
    <p num="79">
      With the above processing, the input system recognizes the input target language in accordance with the activation of the application or change of the font.
      <br/>
      Since the respective language input systems are automatically switched in accordance with the input target language, input processing can be performed in accordance with each language without requiring the user to perform any switching operation for an input operation in each language.
      <br/>
      In this case, since the respective language input systems can be automatically switched without requiring any complicated processing such as searching each language dictionary, the input system corresponding to the input target language can be quickly driven.
    </p>
    <p num="80">The second language recognition processing will be described next with reference to FIG. 16. In the second language recognition processing, language recognition and switching of the input systems are performed in accordance with various conditions other than fonts, unlike the first language recognition processing.</p>
    <p num="81">
      First of all, the multiple language input system 21 determines the type of the application 20 on the basis of this application information.
      <br/>
      This determination processing is performed by using the identifier unique to each application in the application information.
      <br/>
      If the application is for English (YES in step S31), the input target language is recognized as English, and the corresponding information is set in the automatic language recognition section 24 (step S32).
    </p>
    <p num="82">
      FIGS. 7A and 7B show the sample windows in this processing.
      <br/>
      Assume that the application 20 for Japanese is switched to the application 20 for English.
      <br/>
      In this case, the application 20 sends, to the multiple language input system 21, an identifier indicating that the application is for English.
      <br/>
      With this operation, the multiple language input system 21 recognizes the input target language as English, and sets the corresponding information in the automatic language recognition section 24, thereby switching the Japanese mode to the English mode.
      <br/>
      In the English mode, English input processing is performed by using the English processing section 27.
    </p>
    <p num="83">
      In this case, the applications 20 include the applications for Japanese and Chinese as well as the application for English.
      <br/>
      The document preparation apparatus is designed such that when the application 20 for English is activated, i.e., the document preparation apparatus is driven as an European Language wordprocessor, only an European Language font can be generally used.
      <br/>
      In this case, therefore, it can be uniquely determined that the input target language is English.
      <br/>
      When the application 20 other than that for English is activated, i.e., the document preparation apparatus is driven as a Japanese or Chinese wordprocessor, fonts for other languages can be generally used.
      <br/>
      In this case, therefore, the input target language cannot be specified from the type of the application 20.
    </p>
    <p num="84">
      If the application 20 for English is not activated (NO in step S31), the multiple language input system 21 determines the type of format in accordance with the application information.
      <br/>
      If vertical writing is determined (YES in step S33), the set font is determined (step S34).
      <br/>
      If the font is the Japanese font (YES in step S34), the multiple language input system 21 recognizes the input target language as Japanese, and sets the corresponding information in the automatic language recognition section 24 (step S36).
      <br/>
      With this operation, the current mode is switched to the Japanese mode, and input words are processed through the Japanese processing section 25.
    </p>
    <p num="85">
      Note that a vertical writing format is used only for writing in Japanese, and only a horizontal writing format is used for writing in English and Chinese.
      <br/>
      If a font other than the Japanese font is set on the application 20 side (NO in step S34) upon recognition of the vertical writing format, the multiple language input system 21 notifies the application 20 of a message for switching the font to the Japanese font (step S36).
      <br/>
      After the notification of the message, the Japanese mode is set.
    </p>
    <p num="86">
      FIGS. 6A and 6B show the sample windows in this processing.
      <br/>
      When the vertical writing format is set, the current mode is switched to the Japanese mode.
      <br/>
      In this case, the multiple language input system 21 notifies the application 20 of the corresponding message to switch the current font to the Japanese font.
    </p>
    <p num="87">If the type of the application cannot be determined even from the format, the input target language is determined in accordance with the set conditions ((1) font, (2) format, and (3) priority order designated by application information).</p>
    <p num="88">
      If it is determined in step S33 that the format is not the vertical writing format, the multiple language input system 21 checks whether any conditions are set for language recognition (step S37).
      <br/>
      Note that these conditions are set by using the environment setting function on the multiple language input system 21 side, and the corresponding information is set in the automatic language recognition section 24.
    </p>
    <p num="89">If some conditions are set (YES in step S37), the multiple language input system 21 collates the set conditions with information (e.g., font information) from the application 20 to recognize the input target language (step S38), and sets the corresponding information in the automatic language recognition section 24 (step S39).</p>
    <p num="90">
      Assume that the conditions, i.e., the fonts, shown in FIGS. 8A to 8C are set as the above set conditions.
      <br/>
      In this case, if the set font is the Japanese Ming-Cho font, the multiple language input system 21 recognizes the input target language as Japanese in accordance with the condition shown in FIG. 8A. If the set font is the Chinese Ming-Cho font, the multiple language input system 21 recognizes the input target language as Chinese in accordance with the condition shown in FIG. 8B. If the set font is the Japanese Gothic font, the multiple language input system 21 recognizes the input target language as English.
    </p>
    <p num="91">
      If the same condition is set for the respective languages, and an input target language cannot be specified, the input target language is recognized in accordance with the priority information of the respective languages in FIG. 9.
      <br/>
      The priorities are set by using the environment setting function on the multiple language input system 21 side.
      <br/>
      The corresponding information is set in the automatic language recognition section 24.
      <br/>
      In this case, the priories given to Japanese, English, and Chinese decrease in this order.
      <br/>
      If, for example, the same condition is set for Japanese and English, Japanese is recognized preferentially.
    </p>
    <p num="92">
      If such conditions are not set (NO in step S37), the input target language is determined in accordance with the default rule.
      <br/>
      More specifically, if the font used by the application 20 is a Japanese font (YES in step S40), the multiple language input system 21 recognizes the input target language as Japanese, and sets the corresponding information in the automatic language recognition section 24 (step S41).
      <br/>
      If the font used by the application 20 is a Chinese font (YES in step S42), the multiple language input system 21 recognizes the input target language as Chinese, and sets the corresponding information in the automatic language recognition section 24 (step S43).
    </p>
    <p num="93">If the font is neither a Japanese font nor a Chinese font (NO in step S40 and NO in step S42), the multiple language input system 21 recognizes the input target language as English, and sets the corresponding information in the automatic language recognition section 24 (step S44).</p>
    <p num="94">When the input target language is recognized, and the corresponding information is set in the automatic language recognition section 24 in this manner, the multiple language input system 21 switches the language modes on the basis of the information set in the automatic language recognition section 24.</p>
    <p num="95">
      If, for example, the input target language is Japanese, the current mode is switched to the Japanese mode (the Japanese mode is set), and input processing unique to Japanese (kana/kanji conversion processing) is executed through the Japanese processing section 25.
      <br/>
      The processing result is returned to the application 20.
      <br/>
      If the input target language is English, input processing unique to English (spelling check) is executed through the English processing section 27.
      <br/>
      The processing result is returned to the application 20.
      <br/>
      If the input target language is Chinese, input processing unique to Chinese (pin yin conversion processing) is performed through the Chinese processing section 29.
      <br/>
      The processing result is returned to the application 20.
    </p>
    <p num="96">
      With the above processing, the input target language is recognized in the input system in accordance with the activation of the application or changes in various settings such as the font.
      <br/>
      Since the respective language input systems are automatically switched in accordance with the input target language, input processing can be performed in accordance with each language without requiring the user to perform any switching operation for an input operation in each language.
      <br/>
      In this case, since the respective language input systems can be automatically switched without requiring any complicated processing such as searching each language dictionary, the input system corresponding to the input target language can be quickly driven.
    </p>
    <p num="97">The spelling check function in the English mode will be described next with reference to FIG. 16.</p>
    <p num="98">
      FIG. 16 is a flow chart showing spelling check in the multiple language input system 21.
      <br/>
      The multiple language input system 21 receives characters, function key information, or the like from a keyboard or the like through the input section 22 (step S51).
      <br/>
      If the information is input from character keys (step S52), the multiple language input system 21 stores the input character string in the input buffer 12b (step S53), and displays it on the display unit 14 through the output section 31 (step S54).
    </p>
    <p num="99">If the type of the key from which the information is input is a conversion designation key (the "space" key in the English mode) or a confirmation key (step S52), the multiple language input system 21 checks whether English spelling check is required.</p>
    <p num="100">If the language mode determined by the automatic language recognition section 24 is the English mode (YES in step S55), or the alphanumeric shift mode other than the English mode is determined (YES in step S56), the multiple language input system 21 determines that spelling check is required, and executes spelling check (step S57).</p>
    <p num="101">
      If the determined language mode is the English mode, the multiple language input system 21 causes the English processing section 27 to search the English dictionary 28 on the basis of an input word (English word) to check whether the word is misspelled.
      <br/>
      If the alphanumeric shift mode, other than the English mode, is set, the multiple language input system 21 causes the Japanese processing section 25 or the Chinese processing section 29 to search the English dictionary 28 on the basis of the input word (English word) to check whether the word is misspelled.
      <br/>
      If a spelling mistake is detected (YES in step S58), the processing section which has executed the above search further refers to the English dictionary 28 to generate a correct word candidate for this word (step S59).
    </p>
    <p num="102">
      The multiple language input system 21 displays the generated correct word candidate through the output section 31 (step S60).
      <br/>
      In this case, two display methods are available, i.e., a method of displaying the misspelled word with a warning mark (e.g., an underline), as shown in FIG. 10, and a method of displaying the correct word candidate in another window (correct word candidate display portion 64), as shown in FIGS. 11 to 13. It is preferable that these methods be arbitrarily selected by the user using the environment setting function on the multiple language input system 21 side.
    </p>
    <p num="103">
      If the alphanumeric shift mode is not set (NO in step S56), and the Japanese mode is set (YES in step S61), the multiple language input system 21 performs kana/kanji conversion processing through the Japanese processing section 25 (step S62), and displays the processing result (step S60).
      <br/>
      If the Chinese mode is set (NO in step S61), the multiple language input system 21 performs pin yin conversion processing through the Chinese processing section 29 (step S63), and displays the processing result.
    </p>
    <p num="104">
      In this manner, the multiple language input system 21 determines the necessity of English spelling check, and performs spelling check by using the processing section corresponding to the currently set mode if it is determined that spelling check is required.
      <br/>
      In a prior art, a spelling check function exits as a function of the application 20.
      <br/>
      When, therefore, the application 20 is complete, the spelling check function cannot be used in some case.
      <br/>
      According to the present invention, however, since the spelling check function (English input system) is incorporated in the multiple language input system 21, the spelling check function can be used regardless of the type of the application 20.
    </p>
    <p num="105">
      In the above embodiment, the three types of languages, i.e., Japanese, English, and Chinese, are input.
      <br/>
      However, the present invention is not limited to this, and other types of languages can be input.
    </p>
    <p num="106">The techniques described in the above embodiment can be written as computer-executable programs in a recording medium such as a magnetic floppy (a floppy disk, a hard disk, or the like), an optical disk (CD-ROM (compact Disk Read-Only Memory), a DVD (Digital Video Disk), or the like), or a semiconductor memory to be applied to various apparatuses, or can be transmitted through a communication medium to be applied to various apparatuses.</p>
    <p num="107">
      FIG. 18 shows a document preparation apparatus implemented in this manner.
      <br/>
      This document preparation apparatus is implemented by a computer having a display 71, a main body 72, and a keyboard 73.
      <br/>
      A CD-ROM driver is incorporated in the main body 72.
    </p>
    <p num="108">
      The multiple language input system of the present invention is stored in a CD-ROM 74 as programs which can be read out by the computer 70.
      <br/>
      The computer 70 can execute the same processing as that in the above embodiment by reading out the programs from the CD-ROM 74 through the CD-ROM drive.
    </p>
    <p num="109">
      As described above, according to the present invention, input systems for a plurality of languages are prepared to be switched and used.
      <br/>
      A document using a plurality of languages can be efficiently created without preparing dedicated input systems for the respective languages as in the prior art.
    </p>
    <p num="110">
      In addition, according to the present invention, an input target language is recognized on the basis of, for example, the font or format information or the like set on the application side or the switching information set on the input system side, and the respective language input systems are automatically switched in accordance with the input target language.
      <br/>
      Input processing corresponding to each language can therefore be performed without requiring the user to perform a switching operation for input processing in each language.
      <br/>
      In this case, since the respective language input systems can be automatically switched without requiring any complicated processing such as searching each language dictionary, the input system corresponding to the input target language can be quickly driven.
    </p>
    <p num="111">
      Furthermore, according to the present invention, when the format setting information obtained from an application indicates vertical writing, the input target language is recognized as Japanese.
      <br/>
      In this case, if the font setting information obtained from the application indicates a font other than the Japanese font, a message for switching the font to the Japanese font is notified to the application.
      <br/>
      The font setting can be corrected on the application side in accordance with the current target language.
    </p>
    <p num="112">Moreover, according to the present invention, since the spelling check function is implemented as a function of the input system, the spelling check function can be used regardless of the type of application currently used.</p>
    <p num="113">
      Additional advantages and modifications will readily occur to those skilled in the art.
