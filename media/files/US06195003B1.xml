      A fire alarming system includes a plurality of terminal devices including fire sensors, transmitters, manual boxes, and/or other devices to be controlled; and a receiving device to which the plurality of terminal devices are connected.
      <br/>
      A great number of terminal devices with a manual box are connected to the receiving device.
      <br/>
      When a plurality of manual boxes are activated at the same time, the terminal devices corresponding to the activated manual boxes can be called at the same time without encountering a collision among returning-back signals transmitted from these terminal devices.
      <br/>
      That is, when a plurality of manual boxes are activated at the same time, the signal of only one of the plurality of activated manual boxes can arrive at the receiving device.

    <p num="3">The present invention relates to a fire alarming system.</p>
    <p num="4">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
    <p num="5">
      In a conventional fire detection system, a plurality of terminal devices such as a fire sensor, a transmitter, a manual box, or other devices to be controlled are connected to a fire alarming signal receiving device, and each terminal device is assigned its own address.
      <br/>
      The fire alarming signal receiving device calls terminal devices one after another according to the addresses.
      <br/>
      At a time, only the called terminal device can transmit information about itself (for example a fire alarming signal) to the fire alarming signal receiving device.
      <br/>
      This technique is known as polling.
      <br/>
      In this technique, a plurality of alarm signal lines are connected to the fire alarming signal receiver wherein a plurality of terminal devices are connected to each alarm signal line, and thus a great number of terminal devices are connected to the fire alarming signal receiver.
      <br/>
      The fire alarming signal receiving device calls these terminal devices one after another via a data processor provided in the fire alarming signal receiving device and acquires information about for example an event of a fire from each terminal device.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      In the polling technique, however, any terminal device cannot send information to the fire alarming signal receiving device until it is called by the fire alarming signal receiving device.
      <br/>
      The calling period increases with the increase in the number of terminal devices connected to the alarm signal lines.
      <br/>
      If the terminal devices include such a device which should transmit information to the fire alarming signal receiving device in a predetermined time period after the event of information at that device, the maximum number of terminal devices which are allowed to be connected to the signal lines is limited by the above predetermined time period.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      A specific example of a terminal device which should transmit information in a limited time period is a manual box.
      <br/>
      When a fire occurs, if one presses a button or the like of a manual box, the manual box transmits an alarm signal to the fire alarming signal receiving device.
      <br/>
      The fire alarming signal receiving device transmits a response signal to the manual box thereby indicating that the fire alarming signal receiving device has received the alarm signal.
      <br/>
      If the manual box receives the response signal, the manual box turns on a response lamp or the like provided on the manual box thereby indicating that the alarm signal was generated by that manual box.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      In the worst case, the time required for the response lamp of the manual box to be turned on after the manual box was activated becomes as long as one polling period.
      <br/>
      If the waiting time from the activation of the manual box to the turning-on of the response lamp is so long, the person, who activated the manual box, will wonder if the fire alarming system is in correct operation.
      <br/>
      To reduce the waiting time to a desirable level, it is required that the number of terminal devices connected to one signal line be limited to a not large value.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      One known technique to ease the above limitation is as follows.
      <br/>
      A fire alarming signal receiving device sequentially calls a plurality of terminal devices connected to signal lines extending from the fire alarming signal receiving device and acquires information about the status of each terminal device wherein a higher transmission priority is given to the particular information of terminal devices having a manual box and the information of these terminal devices is transmitted before other information.
      <br/>
      If the fire alarming signal receiving device receives the particular kind of information from a manual box, fire alarming signal receiving device preferentially calls those terminal devices having a manual box before calling other terminal devices and determines which manual box has been activated.

      In the conventional technique, as described above, when the fire alarming signal receiving device receives the particular kind of information from a terminal device having a manual box, the fire alarming signal receiving device calls the terminal devices having a manual box one by one to determine which manual box has been activated.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the fire alarming signal receiving device still requires a long time to determine which terminal device having a manual box has been activated, and thus the terminal device still requires a long time to turn on a lamp for indicating that the fire alarm signal has arrived at the fire alarming signal receiving device, in particular when there are a great number of terminal devices having a manual box.
    </p>
    <p num="11">
      One possible technique to solve the above problem is to call at the same time all terminal devices having a manual box instead of calling them one by one when the fire alarming signal receiving device receives the particular kind of information from a terminal device having a manual box.
      <br/>
      In response to the call from the fire alarming signal receiving device, the terminal device whose manual box is in an activated state transmits the signal to the fire alarming signal receiving device.
      <br/>
      Thus, it is possible to reduce the time from when the manual box is activated until the terminal device turns on the lamp to indicate that the fire alarm signal has arrived at the fire alarming signal receiving device.
    </p>
    <p num="12">
      However, the above modification leads to another problem.
      <br/>
      That is, if a plurality of manual boxs are activated at substantially the same time, the terminal devices having these manual boxs respond at the same time.
      <br/>
      As a result, signals collide with each other, and the fire alarming signal receiving device cannot determine correctly which manual box have been activated.
    </p>
    <p num="13">
      Furthermore, in the conventional polling technique, the data transmission rate over the alarm signal line should be high enough to acquire the information from a large number of terminal devices in a limited time period as short as for example 5 sec.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the transmission line is required to have a large number of parallel bit lines, which result in an increase in cost.
    </p>
    <p num="14">
      In a known technique proposed to solve the above problem, the plurality of terminal devices are divided into groups and an idle period is provided between signals calling the adjacent groups so that in the idle period a terminal device can transmit an interrupt signal to the fire alarming signal receiving device wherein it is possible to determine which group the terminal device belongs to from the interrupt signal.
      <br/>
      If the fire alarming signal receiving device receives an interrupt signal, the fire alarming signal receiving device calls, one by one, preferentially the terminal devices belonging to the group determined from the interrupt signal.
    </p>
    <p num="15">However, in this polling technique in which if a terminal device detects an event of a fire, it transmits in an idle period to the fire alarming signal receiving device an interrupt signal with information (such as a group number) indicating which group the terminal device belongs to, and the fire alarming signal receiving device calls the terminal devices in that group one by one, still a long time is required to determine which terminal device has detected the event of the fire, in particular when each group includes a large number of terminal devices.</p>
    <p num="16">
      A fire alarm/security system is also known in which a fire alarming signal receiving device polls terminal devices such as a fire sensor, a smoke exhausting system, a fire extinguishing system, and a burglar alarm system, or transmitters connected to these terminal devices, and the called terminal devices transmit the information representing the status to the fire alarming signal receiving device whereby the fire alarming signal receiving device acquires the monitored information.
      <br/>
      In this fire alarm/security system, control information is transmitted to the terminal devices called by the fire alarming signal receiving device.
    </p>
    <p num="17">
      In this type of fire alarm/security system, there is a possibility that an error occurs during the transmission between the fire alarming signal receiving device and the terminal devices.
      <br/>
      For example, there is a possibility that an area where no fire occurs is regarded as having a fire in error.
      <br/>
      Another possibility is that a terminal device concludes in error that it has received a control command from the fire alarming signal receiving device and the terminal device activates a smoke exhausting system or a fire extinguishing system.
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      In the conventional fire alarm/security system, to avoid the above problem arising from the error in the transmission between the fire alarming signal receiving device and the terminal devices, the fire alarming signal receiving device generates a primary sum code by adding together an address code and a command code, and transmits the resultant primary sum code to the terminal devices.
      <br/>
      The terminal devices produce a first sum code by adding the address code and the command code received from the fire alarming signal receiving device.
      <br/>
      If the obtained first sum code is equal to the received primary sum code, the terminal device regards the signal received from the fire alarming signal receiving device as valid.
      <br/>
      On the other hand, each terminal device calculates the sum of the returning-back data, the address code, the command code, and the primary sum code thereby producing a secondary sum code, and transmits the resultant secondary sum code together with the returning-back data, address code, and command code to the fire alarming signal receiving device.
      <br/>
      The fire alarming signal receiving device calculates the sum of the returning-back data, the address code, and the command code received from the terminal device as well as the primary sum code produced by the fire alarming signal receiving device thereby producing a second sum code.
      <br/>
      If the obtained second sum code is equal to the received secondary sum code, the fire alarming signal receiving device concludes that the terminal device has correctly received the address code and the command code transmitted by the fire alarming signal receiving device.
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      In the above conventional system, each terminal device has a signal transmission/reception circuit (including a parallel-to-serial converter).
      <br/>
      If an active bit is input to the signal transmission/reception circuit, it is converted by the circuit into a low-level signal and output over the transmission line.
      <br/>
      On the other hand, if an inactive bit is input to the signal transmission/reception circuit, it is converted by the circuit into a high-level signal and output over the transmission line.
      <br/>
      If a collision occurs between a low-level signal and a high-level signal on the transmission line, the result is a high-level signal.
    </p>
    <p num="20">
      If the fire alarming signal receiving device receives a low-level signal via the transmission line, the received low-level signal is converted into an active bit by a signal transmission/reception circuit (including a parallel-to-serial converter) provided in the fire alarming signal receiving device.
      <br/>
      On the other hand, if the fire alarming signal receiving device receives a high-level signal via the transmission line, the received high-level signal is converted into an inactive bit by the signal transmission/reception circuit in the fire alarming signal receiving device.
      <br/>
      Therefore, if a collision occurs between a low-level signal and a high-level signal on the transmission line, the fire alarming signal receiving device receives the high-level signal.
      <br/>
      The received high-level signal is converted into an inactive bit by the signal transmission/reception circuit provided in the fire alarming signal receiving device and acquired into the fire alarming signal receiving device.
      <br/>
      In the above conventional system, as described above, if an active bit and an inactive bit are transmitted at the same time over the transmission line from different terminal devices such as fire sensors, the inactive bit is acquired into the fire alarming signal receiving device.
    </p>
    <p num="21">
      In such the fire alarm/security system according to the conventional technique, if an equal address is assigned by mistake to two different fire sensors, and if one of the two fire sensors transmits a fire alarm signal as the returning-back data while the other fire sensor having the same address transmits information (non-fire signal) indicating that the fire sensor is in a normal status, the above fire alarm signal cannot arrive at the fire alarming signal receiving device.
      <br/>
      Another possible problem is that when an equal address is assigned by mistake to two different fire sensors, the second sum code can be equal to the secondary sum code, and thus it is impossible to detect the event of the above transmission error.
    </p>
    <p num="22">
      For example, when the address AD and the commands CM1 and CM2 are FFh, 01h, and 00h, respectively, in hexadecimal form (11111111, 00000001, and 00000000 in the form of 8-bit binary numbers; each hexadecimal number is represented with an "h" at its end), if one of the two fire sensors having the same address transmits returning-back data D1 having a value of 01h (00000001 in the form of an 8-bit binary number) indicating that a fire occurs while the other fire sensor having the same address transmits returning-back data D2 having a value of 00h (00000000 in the form of an 8-bit binary number) indicating the normal status, then the result will be as follows.
      <br/>
      The primary sum code PS is given as 00h as a result of the calculation described above.
      <br/>
      The secondary sum code SS1 for the returning-back data D1 indicating the event of a fire becomes 01h.
      <br/>
      The secondary sum code SS2 for the returning-back data D2 indicating the normal status becomes 00h.
      <br/>
      Because the same address is assigned to the two terminal devices, the returning-back data D1 and D2 are transmitted at the same time, and the secondary sum codes SS1 and SS2 are also transmitted at the same time.
    </p>
    <p num="23">
      As a result, collision occurs on the signal line L between the returning-back data D1 and D2.
      <br/>
      Similarly, the secondary codes SS1 and SS2 collide with each other on the signal line.
      <br/>
      When a collision occurs between 01h and 00h, only the signal corresponding to 00h can propagate along the signal line for the following reason.
      <br/>
      Bits having a value of 0 become high on the transmission line while those bits having a value of 1 become low on the transmission line.
      <br/>
      If a low-level signal and a high-level signal are applied to the signal line at the same time, the resultant signal level on the signal line becomes high.
      <br/>
      Therefore if 01h and 00h, which can be represented as 00000001 and 00000000, respectively, in the form of 8-bit binary numbers, are applied to the signal line at the same time, the collision between a "0"-bit and a "1"-bit results in a "0"-bit on the signal line, and thus only the 00h signal can exist on the signal line.
      <br/>
      As a result it seems that 00h is transmitted for both the returning-back data and the secondary sum code.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the fire alarming signal receiving device regards the received returning-back data as 00h, and calculates the second sum code as 00h according to the calculation rule described above.
      <br/>
      Thus the calculated second sum code becomes equal to the received apparent secondary sum code.
      <br/>
      Thus the fire alarm signal cannot arrive at the fire alarming signal receiving device.
      <br/>
      This is a serious problem in the conventional system.
      <br/>
      Besides, the fact that such the error has occurred during the transmission cannot be detected.
    </p>
    <p num="24">
      Furthermore, in the polling operation according to the conventional technique, if the fire alarming signal receiving device detects a transmission error for a terminal device or a group containing that terminal device, the fire alarming signal receiving device stops polling other terminal devices or groups including other terminal devices, and polls again the terminal device which has encountered the transmission error or the group including that terminal device.
      <br/>
      If a transmission error is detected again in that polling operation, the fire alarming signal receiving device concludes that a transmission error has really occurred and makes an indication of the event of the transmission error.
    </p>
    <p num="25">
      In the above conventional technique, however, the repetition of the polling operation required for confirming a transmission error causes a delay in the operation of acquiring status information from other terminal devices or the group including that terminal device.
      <br/>
      This causes an increase in the total time required to poll the terminal devices in the fire alarm/security system.

    <heading>DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
    <p num="41">FIG. 1 is a schematic representation of an embodiment of a fire alarm/security system 100 according to the present invention.</p>
    <p num="42">The fire alarm/security system 100 includes a fire alarming signal receiving device RE, a signal line L consisting of a pair of wires also serving as a power supply line, and various types of terminal devices, wherein the terminal devices are connected to the fire alarming signal receiving device RE via the signal line L.</p>
    <p num="43">
      The fire alarming system 100 includes as many as for example 255 terminal devices connected to the fire alarming signal receiving device RE.
      <br/>
      The terminal devices include analog fire sensors S, manual boxs P, and transmitters RP.
      <br/>
      The analog fire sensors S detect smoke, heat, light of a flame, gas, a smell or the like arising from a fire and generate an output signal corresponding to the detected physical quantity Several types of analog fire sensors are available.
      <br/>
      They include: smoke sensing type fire detectors such as a photoelectric smoke sensor, a light attenuation sensor, and an ion sensor; a heat sensor; a flame sensor; a gas sensor; and a smell sensor.
      <br/>
      On-off type fire sensors F, which generate a fire alarm signal when they detect a fire phenomenon at a level greater than a predetermined value, are also connected to the signal line L via the corresponding transmitters RP.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, fire doors D, local bells B, gas leakage detectors G are also connected to the signal line L via the transmitters RP.
    </p>
    <p num="44">
      Each terminal device is assigned an address represented by a 2-digit hexadecimal number in such a manner that the address increases one by one in the order of the distance from the fire alarming signal receiving device RE.
      <br/>
      More specifically, terminal devices are assigned addresses 00h, 01h, 02h, . . . , FEh in the order of the distance from the fire alarming signal receiving device RE.
      <br/>
      For an easier understanding, the addresses will be represented in decimal form in most cases.
    </p>
    <p num="45">
      The terminal devices hating addresses 00h to FEh are divided into 16 groups G0 to G15 in the order of the distance of the terminal devices from the fire alarming signal receiving device RE.
      <br/>
      As shown in FIG. 1, each of groups G0 to G14 includes 16 terminal devices, and group G15 includes 15 terminal devices.
      <br/>
      Each of these 255 terminal devices is assigned its own 8-bit address different from each other in the range from 00h to FEh.
    </p>
    <p num="46">FIG. 2 is a schematic representation of 8-bit address codes for two terminal devices in the system of the present embodiment wherein FIG. 2(1) illustrates an 8-bit binary address code for a 10th (in decimal) terminal, and FIG. 2(2) illustrates an 8-bit binary address code for a 255th terminal.</p>
    <p num="47">
      As shown in FIG. 2, the binary address code for each terminal can be divided into higher 4-bits (hereafter referred to simply as higher bits) and lower 4-bits (hereafter referred to simply as lower bits).
      <br/>
      The higher bits represent the group number and the lower bits represent the terminal number in the group.
      <br/>
      In the case of the 10th (in decimal) terminal device, its binary address code is "00001001", and thus the higher bits of the address code are "0000" (0h) which indicate that the terminal device belongs to the 0th group.
      <br/>
      The lower bits are "1001" (9h) and thus it is indicated that the terminal device is the 10th one in the group.
      <br/>
      The address "09h" represented by the combination of the higher bits and the lower bits indicates that the terminal device is the 10th one of all the devices in the fire alarming system 100.
    </p>
    <p num="48">
      In the case of the 255th (in decimal) terminal device, its binary address code is "11111110", and thus its higher bits are "1111" (Fh) which indicate that the terminal device belongs to the 15th group.
      <br/>
      The lower bits are "1110" (Eh) and thus it is indicated that the terminal device is the 15th one in that group.
      <br/>
      The address "FEh" represented by the combination of the higher and lower bits indicates that the terminal device is the 255th one of all the devices in the fire alarming system 100.

      In the present embodiment, as described above, the entire 8-bit code represents the address in the total fire alarming system 100.

      Since each of terminal devices is assigned its own address represented by a plurality of bits wherein the group number is represented by particular bits of the address, it is possible to call at the same time a plurality of terminal devices having an equal group number in a "group information acquisition frame" in "point polling".
      <br/>
      Furthermore, because the called terminal devices having the equal group number are assigned different intra-group terminal device numbers, it is possible to specify the response timing so that the called terminal devices having the equal group number can response to the call at different times.

      The "group information acquisition frame" is used by the fire alarming signal receiving device RE to poll the terminal devices in such a manner that the 255 terminal devices, which are divided into groups, for example 16 groups, are called group by group rather than device by device.
      <br/>
      The terminal devices belonging to the called group transmit in a device-by-device fashion requested data such as status information or terminal type indicating information ID to the fire alarming signal receiving device RE at response times assigned to the respective terminal devices.

    <p num="56">In the present embodiment of the fire alarming system in which a plurality of terminal devices such as fire sensors, transmitters, manual boxs, or other devices to be controlled are connected to a receiving device of the system, the terminal devices are divided into a plurality of groups and the receiving device polls these terminal devices group by group wherein the receiving device acquires, in a time-division fashion, information from a plurality of terminal devices belonging to a particular group of the above plurality of groups in a time period between the completion of transmission of a polling signal to the above group and the start of transmission of a polling signal to the next group.</p>
    <p num="57">With the arrangement of the present embodiment, it is possible to quickly determine which terminal device has detected an event of an abnormal state even if there are a great number of terminal devices in one group.</p>

      When analog fire sensors are used as the terminal devices, the "status information" refers to such data representing physical quantity corresponding to a detected fire phenomenon.
      <br/>
      In the case of a transmitter RP connected to an on-off fire sensor F or a gas leakage detector G, the "status information" refers to data indicating an event of a fire or leakage of gas.
      <br/>
      For a transmitter RP connected to a device to be controlled such as a fire retarding door D or a local bell B, the "status information" refers to such data indicating whether the device is in an open state or a closed state, or data indicating whether the device is in operation or not, or otherwise data indicating whether the bell is ringing or not.
      <br/>
      In the case of an manual box, the "status information" refers to such data indicating whether or not its push button switch is pressed and thus it is in an on-state.
    </p>
    <p num="60">The information acquired in a "group information acquisition frame" in the point polling is referred to as "group information".</p>
    <p num="61">
      Because the manual boxs P are activated by persons, the information given by manual boxs P is highly reliable.
      <br/>
      Taking this fact into consideration, "manual box detection frames" are provided in the point polling thereby making it possible to quickly acquire the status information.
      <br/>
      As shown in FIG. 3, each time a "group information acquisition frame" is executed for each group, all manual boxs of the fire alarming system are called at the same time in a manual box detection frame.
      <br/>
      If there is an activated manual box, the activated manual box transmits, in response to the call, its address to the fire alarming signal receiving device RE in a time slot assigned to that manual box, of a plurality of time slots assigned to the respective manual boxs.

    <p num="62">
      "Activated manual box address information" refers to the address acquired in the "manual box detection frame".

      In the present embodiment, when a plurality of manual boxs P are activated, only the one manual box having the lowest address can transmit its address and the other activated manual boxs having higher addresses cannot transmit their address.
      <br/>
      This operation will be described in further detail later.
    </p>
    <p num="63">
      The "system polling" refers to an operation in which the fire alarming signal receiving device RE transmits control commands to all terminal devices thereby controlling them.
      <br/>
      The control commands issued by the fire alarming signal receiving device RE to the terminal devices in the system polling include a fire reset command (used to reset to a normal monitoring state a terminal device such as an analog fire sensor S or a transmitter which has transmitted a fire alarm signal or other terminal devices such as a transmitter having a local bell B ringing), storage reset command (used to reset a terminal device such as a fire sensor or a transmitter which have transmitted a fire alarming signal to perform a storage operation thereby determining whether a fire is continuously detected), and a local sound stop command (used to inactivate a local bell B).

    <p num="64">The "selecting" refers to an operation in which the fire alarming signal receiving device transmits a particular control command to a desired terminal device designated by a particular address so as to control that terminal device, or transmits a particular command such as a status information request command to a particular terminal device thereby acquiring the status information from the particular terminal device.</p>
    <p num="65">
      In FIG. 3, the operation process starts from the top and left and proceeds to right.
      <br/>
      At the right end in FIG. 3, the process goes down by one line and proceeds to left, and so on.
      <br/>
      In FIG. 3, the signals shown above the horizontal lines are transmitted by the fire alarming signal receiving device RE while the signal shown below the horizontal lines are transmitted by terminal devices.
    </p>
    <p num="66">
      The signals (codes) transmitted from the fire alarming signal receiving device RE to terminal devices include an address AD, commands CM1 and CM2, and a primary checksum code PS.
      <br/>
      The signals (codes) transmitted from terminal devices to the fire alarming signal receiving device RE include returning-back data D1, a secondary checksum code SS, a device address DA, and returning-back data D2.
      <br/>
      These signals (codes) are described in greater detail below.
    </p>
    <p num="67">
      The codes AD, CM1, CM2, PS, D1, SS, DA, and Da each consist of a start bit SB, an 8-bit data area, and a stop bit EB.
      <br/>
      That is, each code consists of 10 bits in total.
      <br/>
      When these codes are transmitted from the fire alarming signal receiving device RE to a terminal device or from a terminal device to the fire alarming signal receiving device RE, each 10-bit binary-code is transmitted bit by bit starting from the most significant bit.
      <br/>
      For simplicity, hereinafter in the following description, the 8-bit data area representing the contents of each code AD, CM1, CM2, PS, D1, DA, Da, and SS is expressed by a 2-digit hexadecimal number.
    </p>
    <p num="68">
      First, an address AD, commands CM1 and CM2, a primary checksum code PS are transmitted from the fire alarming signal receiving device RE to terminal devices.
      <br/>
      The address AD can take any of 2-digit hexadecimal numbers from 00h to FFh.
      <br/>
      When the address AD has a value within the range from 00h to FEh (in other words, AD not equal to FFh), the address designates a particular terminal device in the fire alarming system 100 to be selected in the selecting operation (hereinafter the address will be referred to as the "selecting address code").
      <br/>
      On the other hand, when the address AD has a value equal to FFh, it indicates that the operation should be performed in a point polling or system polling mode (hereinafter referred to as a polling command).
    </p>
    <p num="69">
      The command CM1 is also a 2-digit hexadecimal number.
      <br/>
      When the operation is performed in the selecting mode (that is, AD not equal to FFh), a specific command is designated by a particular 2-digit hexadecimal number of the command CM1.
      <br/>
      For example, when the command CM1 is equal to 82h, it designates a fire test command. 83h designates a lamp turning-off command used to turn off an indication lamp of a fire sensor in the selecting mode.
    </p>
    <p num="70">
      On the other hand, when the operation is performed in the polling mode (AD=FFh), the command CM1 designates a specific operation to be performed.
      <br/>
      That is, when the command CM1 is equal to 0Xh, it designates that point processing should be performed (point processing command), and FXh designates system processing (system processing command).
    </p>
    <p num="71">
      In the above expression, X is a hexadecimal number from 0h to Fh which designates the polling operation more specifically.
      <br/>
      For example, when the command CM1 is equal to 00h, it designates a request for returning back terminal type indicating information (ID) in the point polling operation.
      <br/>
      Similarly, 01h designates a request for a state information in the point polling operation, F0h is a fire reset command in the system polling operation, F1h is a storage reset command in the system polling operation, F2h is a local sound stop command in the system polling operation, and F3h is a voice-alarm stop command in the system polling operation.
    </p>
    <p num="72">
      The command CM2 also takes a 2-digit hexadecimal number.
      <br/>
      However, the command CM2 is not used in the selecting and system polling operations.
    </p>
    <p num="73">
      In the case of point polling, the lower digit of the command CM2 designates the group which should transmit specific information in the polling operation to the fire alarming signal receiving device (thus the lower digit is referred to as a point-polling group designation code).
      <br/>
      For example, the command CM2 is represented in the form of 0Xh where X is a hexadecimal number from 0h to Fh designating the group number that should transmit specific information back to the fire alarming signal receiving device.
    </p>
    <p num="74">
      The primary checksum code PS is a code used by terminal devices to judge whether a message received from the fire alarming signal receiving device RE includes no error.
      <br/>
      The primary checksum code PS is calculated from the codes AD, CM1, and CM2 according to a predetermined rule as will be described later.
    </p>
    <p num="75">When the operation is performed in the point polling mode, each terminal device transmits status information or terminal type indicating information ID as the returning-back data D1 and also a secondary checksum code SS to the fire alarming signal receiving device RE.</p>
    <p num="76">
      In the case of the selecting operation, each terminal device transmits a device address DA, a returning data Da, and a secondary checksum code SS to the fire alarming signal receiving device RE.
      <br/>
      On the other hand, terminal devices transmit nothing in the system polling operation.
      <br/>
      The "returning-back data Da" refers to data which is returned back when a terminal device receives a control command such as a device status information request command, a terminal type indicating information request command, thereby notifying the fire alarming signal receiving device that the terminal device has correctly operated according to the received command.
    </p>
    <p num="77">
      The secondary checksum code SS is used by the fire alarming signal receiving device RE to confirm that a message received from a terminal device includes no error.
      <br/>
      In the case of the point polling operation, the secondary checksum code SS is calculated from AD, CM1, CM2, PS, and D1, while it is calculated from AD, CM1, CM2, PS, DA, and Da in the setting operation, according to the calculation rule described later.
    </p>
    <p num="78">The operation of the system according to the present embodiment of the invention will be described in greater detail below with reference to FIG. 3.</p>
    <p num="79">
      The point polling process includes a "group information acquisition frame" and a "manual box detection frame".
      <br/>
      The "group information acquisition frame" consists of a "receiver field" in which a receiver calls a terminal device, a "first waiting field WF1" in which no transmission is performed between the receiving device and the terminal device, and a "terminal device field" in which the called terminal device transmits a signal to the receiving device.
      <br/>
      The "manual box detection frame" consists of a "manual box field" in which transmission is performed between the receiving device and a manual box, and a "second waiting field WF2" in which no transmission is performed between the receiving device and the terminal device.
    </p>
    <p num="80">First at time P0, as shown in FIG. 3, a point polling operation starts with a "receiving device field" in a "group information acquisition frame." In this receiving device field, the fire alarming signal receiving device RE transmits FFh as an address AD, 01h as a command CM1, 00h as a command CM2, and a primary checksum code PS.</p>
    <p num="81">In a terminal device field, if terminal devices receive any of the above commands, the terminal devices of each group check whether the group number received from the fire alarming signal receiving device RE is equal to the group number represented by the higher digit of the device address. if the result of the above checking is positive, the terminal device transmits a returning-back data D1 and a secondary checksum code SS to the fire alarming signal receiving device RE after the end of a first waiting field WF1.</p>
    <p num="82">In the above operation in which each terminal device transmits requested data, the 16 terminal devices belonging to the called group transmit the requested data at response times assigned to the respective terminal devices in the order of increasing terminal numbers.</p>
    <p num="83">
      On the other hand, after the first waiting field WF1, the fire alarming signal receiving device RE enters the terminal device field.
      <br/>
      The terminal device field includes 16 slots in which the fire alarming signal receiving device RE receives status information from the corresponding terminal devices.
      <br/>
      In the terminal device fields, the respective terminal devices having their own terminal number from 0 to 15 transmit returning-back data D1 and a secondary checksum code SS in the corresponding time slots assigned to the respective terminal devices, while the fire alarming signal receiving device RE acquires the data transmitted from the respective terminal devices.
    </p>
    <p num="84">
      After the completion of the terminal device field, a "manual box detection frame" is started.
      <br/>
      The "manual box detection frame" is one of operations performed in the point polling.
      <br/>
      At time CP in the "manual box detection frame", as shown in FIG. 3, the fire alarming signal receiving device RE transmits a fire-alerting-device calling pulse PC thereby calling only manual boxs P. If the push button of a particular manual box P is pressed and thus it is in an active state, the manual box P transmits its device address ADp immediately after receiving the fire-alerting-device calling pulse PC.
      <br/>
      In the above operation, the fire-alerting-device calling pulse PC also serves as a start bit for the data transmission from the manual box P. That is, the 8-bit device address ADp is transmitted at a right time synchronized relative to the fire-alerting-device calling pulse PC.
      <br/>
      In this way, the fire alarming signal receiving device RE can acquire the address information ADp of the manual box P in the activated state.
    </p>
    <p num="85">
      After completion of the manual box field in the "manual box detection field", the fire alarming signal receiving device RE enters a second waiting field WF2.
      <br/>
      After the second waiting field WF2, the point polling operation (G0) for the group having a group number of 0 is completed.
    </p>
    <p num="86">
      Then the command CM2 designating the group is incremented by 1.
      <br/>
      At time P1, a point polling operation (G1) for a group having a group number of 1 is started and the operation is performed in a manner similar to the point polling operation (G0).
      <br/>
      Although not shown in FIG. 3, at points P2, P3, . . . , P14, groups having group numbers 2h to Fh are designated, and the point polling operation is performed for these groups in a manner similar to the point polling operation (G0).
    </p>
    <p num="87">
      After completion of the point polling operation for the group having a group number of Fh, the point polling operation for acquiring the terminal type indicating information ID is performed although not shown in FIG. 3.
      <br/>
      In this operation, the fire alarming signal receiving device RE transmits FFh as the address data AD, 00h as the command CM1, 01h as the command CM2, and the primary checksum code PS.
      <br/>
      In a terminal device field, the respective terminal devices transmit their own terminal type indicating information ID as the returning-back data D1 as opposed to the above terminal device field in which the status information is transmitted from the respective terminal devices.
    </p>
    <p num="88">
      The point polling operation is performed for the group having a group number of 0h in a manner similar to the point polling operation for acquiring the status information except for the returning-back data D1.
      <br/>
      Similarly, groups having group numbers 0h to Fh are designated one by one, and the point polling operation is performed for the designated group.
      <br/>
      In this way, the fire alarming signal receiving device RE acquires the terminal type indicating information ID from the respective terminal devices.
      <br/>
      After completion of the polling operation for the group having a group number of Fh, another point polling operation is started to acquire the status information.
    </p>
    <p num="89">The system polling operation according to the embodiment of the invention will be described below.</p>
    <p num="90">If, at time P16 in FIG. 3, a human operator operates the control panel OP of the fire alarming signal receiving device RE thereby issuing a command telling it that it should perform a fire resetting operation in the system polling mode, the fire alarming signal receiving device transmits a polling command (AD=FFh), a fire resetting command (CM1=F0h), and a primary checksum code PS one by one thereby performing the fire resetting operation.</p>
    <p num="91">Although in the system polling operation according to the above specific embodiment, no signal is transmitted from the terminal devices to the fire alarming signal receiving device RE, terminal devices may also transmit a signal indicating that they have correctly received the command from the fire alarming signal receiving device RE.</p>
    <p num="92">
      In the case where a storage reset command, a local sound stop command, or a voice-alarm stop command is executed in the system polling mode, a storage reset command (CM1=F1h), a local sound stop command (CM1=F2h), or a voice-alarm stop command (CM1=F3h) is transmitted instead of the fire reset command (CM1 F0h) in the above-described operation.
      <br/>
      Except for the above, the operation is performed in a manner similar to the fire reset operation in the system polling mode.
    </p>
    <p num="93">Now the selecting operation according to the present embodiment of the invention will be described below.</p>
    <p num="94">If, at time P17 in FIG. 3, a human operator operates the control panel OP of the fire alarming signal receiving device RE thereby issuing a command telling it that it should perform a selecting operation for turning off an indication lamp of a terminal device having an address AD of 12h, the fire alarming signal receiving device RE sequentially transmits commands including an address (AD=12h) designating a terminal device to be selected, an indication lamp turn-off command (CM1=83h), and a primary checksum code PS.</p>
    <p num="95">
      Of the terminal devices which have received the above signals, the one having an address AD of 12h transmits its device address DA, a returning-back data Da, and a secondary checksum code SS to the fire alarming signal receiving device RE wherein the returning-back data Da indicates that the indication lamp has been turned off successfully.
      <br/>
      In addition to the indication lamp turn-off command (CM1=83h), the commands transmitted by the fire alarming signal receiving device RE in the selecting mode include a fire test command (CM1=82h), an indication lamp turn-on command (CM1=84h), a CL interval control command (CM1=85h), a smoke shut-off transmitter reset command (CM1=86h), an interlocking ringing command (CM1=87h), a manual ringing command (CM1=88h), an SCI shut-off command (CM=89h), a fire reset command (CM1=F0h), storage reset command (CM1=F1h), a local bell stop command (CM1=F2h), a voice-alarm stop command (CM1=F3h), a terminal type indicating information request (CM1=00h), and a status information request (CM1=01h).
      <br/>
      In the selecting operation, a proper command of the above is transmitted from the fire alarming signal receiving device, and the command is executed in a manner similar to the above-described operation of turning off the indication lamp of a terminal device except for the difference in the specific command.

    <p num="96">In the present embodiment, if a plurality of manual boxs are activated at the same time during a manual box detection frame in the point polling mode, the address of only one manual box of those is transmitted to the fire alarming signal receiving device RE as described in detail below.</p>

      Therefore, no collision among the address data occurs on the transmission line.

      FIGS. 4(2), 4(3), and 4(4) illustrate address signals transmitted from the manual boxs PA, PB, and PC, respectively.
    </p>
    <p num="100">
      In FIG. 4, for convenience of description, the addresses AD of the respective manual boxs PA, PB, and PC are represented in decimal form, while the address data are represented in binary form in the timing chart.
      <br/>
      That is, the manual box PA has an address of "62" in decimal form ("00111110" in binary form), the manual box PB has an address of "64" in decimal form ("01000000" in binary form), and the manual box PC has an address of "160" in decimal form ("10100000" in binary form).
    </p>
    <p num="101">
      It is assumed herein that the manual boxs PA, PB, and PC are in activated states when they receive a manual box calling pulse PC from the fire alarming signal receiving device RE at time CP shown in FIG. 4(1).
      <br/>
      In response to the manual box calling pulse from the fire alarming signal receiving device RE at time CP, the manual boxs PA, PB, and PC transmit their own device address AD bit by bit starting from the most significant bit.
    </p>
    <p num="102">
      Since the manual box PB has an address AD of "01000000" (in binary form), its most significant bit is "0".
      <br/>
      The manual box PA has an address AD of "00111110" (in binary form), and its most significant bit is also "0".
      <br/>
      On the other hand, the manual box PC has an address AD of "10100000" (in binary form), and thus its most significant bit is also "1".
    </p>
    <p num="103">
      That is, the most significant bits of the respective addresses AD are "0" (inactive level) for the manual boxs PA and PB and "1" (active level) for the manual boxs PC.
      <br/>
      In this case, since signals at 0-level and a signal at 1-level are transmitted over the signal line at the same time, the resulting signal on the signal line L becomes "0" (inactive level).
    </p>
    <p num="104">
      Judging from the fact that when the manual box PC tries to transmit the "1"-level signal (active level signal), the signal line L is at the "0" level (inactive level), the manual box PC concludes that another manual box having an address AD lower than the address AD of the manual box PC is transmitting a signal over the signal line L, and the manual box PC gives up transmitting the following bits of its own address AD.
      <br/>
      On the other hand, because the signal line L is at the "0" level (inactive level) when the manual boxs PA and PB try to transmit the "0"-level signal (inactive level signal), they conclude, at the time when the most significant bits of the addresses AD are transmitted, that no other manual boxs having an address lower than those of the manual boxs PA and PB are trying to transmit a signal over the signal line, and thus they continue to transmit the following bits of their own addresses AD.
    </p>
    <p num="105">
      As for the bit following the most significant bit of the address AD, the manual box PA transmits a "0"-level signal (inactive level signal) while the manual box PB transmits a "1"-level signal (active level signal).

      As a result, the signal on the signal line L becomes "0" (inactive).
    </p>
    <p num="106">Judging from the fact that when the manual box PB tries to transmit the "1"-level signal (active level signal), the signal line L is at the "0" level (inactive level), the manual box PB concludes that another manual box having an address AD lower than the address AD of the manual box PB is transmitting a signal over the signal line L, and the manual box PB give up transmitting the following bits of its own address AD.</p>
    <p num="107">On the other hand, because the signal line L is at the "0" level (inactive level) when the manual boxs PA tries to transmit the "0"-level signal (inactive level signal), it concludes, at the time when the bit following the most significant bit of the address AD is transmitted, that no other manual boxs having an address lower than that of the manual box PA are trying to transmit a signal over the signal line, and thus it continues to transmit the following bits of its own address AD.</p>
    <p num="108">
      As for the further following bit of the address AD, the manual box PA transmit a "1"-level signal (active level signal) and the signal line is at a "1" level (active level).

      As a result, at this stage, the manual box PA concludes that no other manual boxs having an address lower than that of the manual box PA are trying to transmit a signal over the signal line, and thus it continues to transmit the following bits of its own address AD.

      Thus a collision among device addresses can be prevented when a plurality of manual boxs try to transmit their device address to notify that they are activated.
      <br/>

    <p num="179">
      Now, the operation in a "manual box detection frame" (performed substantially in steps S427 to S433) will be described below.
      <br/>
      First, the microprocessor MPU1 judges whether the control timer Tslt indicates that the manual box slot start time Tp has come (step S427).
      <br/>
      If it is concluded in step S427 that the control timer Tslt indicates that the manual box slot start time Tp has come, a manual box detection frame is started, and the receiving operation is enabled in step S428.
      <br/>
      A manual box calling pulse PC is transmitted from the signal transmitter/receiver TRX1 (step S429).

    <p num="180">
      The manual box calling pulse PC also serves as a start bit for the data transmission from a manual box P to the fire alarming signal receiving device RE.
      <br/>
      By the fire-alerting-device calling pulse PC, not only the manual boxs in one group but the manual boxs of all groups are called.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the fire alarming signal receiving device RE can acquire the address ADp of a manual box P in an activated state for all groups.
    </p>
    <p num="181">
      If the address ADp of a manual box P in an activated state is received within a third time period T3 (S430, S439), the obtained address ADp is stored in the RAM 15 (S431), and the display on the fire alarming signal receiving device RE indicates that the manual box P has detected an event of a fire and also indicates the address of that manual box P (S432).
      <br/>
      The command (group designation code) CM2 is then incremented by 1, and the result is stored in the RAM 143 (S433).
      <br/>
      In this case, the previous content of the group designation code CM2 is deleted.
      <br/>
      Herein the "third time period" T3 refers to a period from a manual box slot start time Tp to a manual box slot end time Tep.
      <br/>
      The control timer Tslt monitors the elapse of time and determines whether the third time period T3 has elapsed.
    </p>
    <p num="182">If the control timer Tslt concludes that the elapsed time has not reached the manual box slot end time Tep (S439), the control timer Tslt waits until the elapsed time has reached the manual box slot end time Tep (S430).</p>

      If the address ADp of a manual box P in an activated state does not arrive at the fire alarming signal receiving device RE within the third time period T3 (S430, S439), the group designation code CM2 is incremented by 1 and the result is stored in the RAM 143 (S433).

      Also in this case, the previous content of the group designation code CM2 is deleted.

    <p num="184">If in the above step S433, the group designation code becomes equal to the last group number, it is reset to the first group number.</p>
    <p num="185">
      In this way, the addresses ADp of all manual boxs P in all groups are returned as the activated manual box address information to the fire alarming signal receiving device RE in the manual box slot and thus the fire alarming signal receiving device RE acquires the information.
      <br/>
      Then the group designation code (command) CM2 is incremented by 1 (S433), and the process enters a second waiting field WF2 (not shown) in which the fire alarming signal receiving device RE does nothing to terminal devices.
      <br/>
      After the second waiting field WF2, the microprocessor MPU1 returns the process to step S2.
      <br/>
      If neither a selecting command nor a system polling command is issued (S2, S3), the point polling operation including the group information acquisition frame is performed for the group having the next group number, that is group number 1 in this case.

      The variations in the transmission timing of the returning-back data D1 and the secondary checksum code SS returned back from the respective terminal devices are absorbed in the above-described second waiting field WF2.

      This point polling operation is performed in substantially the same manner as the above-described point polling operation including the "group information acquisition frame" for acquiring the status information except that instead of the status information, the terminal type indicating information ID is transmitted as the returning-back data D1.
      <br/>
      After completion of the above point polling operation, the point polling operation including the "group information acquisition frame" and the "manual box detection frame" for acquiring the status information and the point polling operation including the "group information acquisition frame" and the "manual box detection frame" for acquiring the terminal type indicating information ID are performed alternately.

      Alternatively, the fire alarming signal receiving device RE may further include a transmission frame length control timer Tf and the transmission frame length control timer Tf may be started before step S2 so that the processes from step S2 to step S433 is performed before an overflow occurs in the transmission frame length control timer Tf.
      <br/>
      In the case where the second waiting field WF2 is not completed within the above time period, the point polling which is in process for a particular group is forcibly stopped, and the group designation code CM2 is incremented by 1 and the point polling operation for the next group is started.

    <p num="190">
      Via the above operation, the status information of the terminal devices of the groups G0 to G15 is acquired from a group to another.

      Furthermore, in the above operation, it is possible to acquire the addresses of all manual boxs in activated states of all groups only by executing the point polling once.

      For example, if an equal address is assigned to two different terminal devices, the checksum can be equal for these two terminal devices.
    </p>
    <p num="217">
      In the case where an equal address is assigned to different terminal devices, these terminal devices transmit their data to the receiving device at the same time.
      <br/>
      If the data D1 transmitted from these different terminal devices are equal to each other, no problem occurs.
      <br/>
      However the data D1 are different from each other, a problem occurs as described below.
    </p>
    <p num="218">
      Assume that the 0th bit of the returning-back data D1 is assigned to a fire alarming bit, and the 0th bit is set to "1" when a fire occurs while the 0th bit is set to "0" when there is no fire.
      <br/>
      If a collision occurs between fire alarming bits of "1" and "0", then the result on the signal line L becomes "0".

      Thus, a collision occurs between the "1" and "0", and the result on the signal line L becomes "0".
      <br/>
      As a result, the fire alarming signal receiving device receives the data having "0" at the 0th bit, and concludes that no fire is detected at the terminal devices assigned the same address.

      The operation in steps U104 to U113 is performed in a manner similar to the previous case except that instead of the status information the terminal type indicating information ID of the terminal device is transmitted as the returning-back data D1 to the fire alarming signal receiving device RE.

    <p num="232">
      Although in the above specific example, the transmitter is taken as an example of a terminal device and the point processing operation thereof is described, the point processing operation may also be performed in a similar manner for other types of terminal devices such as a photoelectric fire sensor or a heat-sensing fire detector.
      <br/>
      For example, when a photoelectric fire sensor S is employed as a terminal device, the point processing operation is the same except that the status information is acquired in such a manner that a light emitting diode LD connected to a light emitting diode driving circuit LDC periodically emits light in response to clock pulses generated by a clock generator, and a photodiode PD connected to a photo detecting circuit PDC detects the light scattered by smoke thereby detecting the smoke density.

      <br/>
      If the push button switch SW is pressed in the predetermined time period T1a and the manual box P is activated (U203, U217), it is judged whether a manual box slot generated by the fire alarming signal receiving device has been detected by the terminal device P within a predetermined time period T2a (step U204).

      Herein the b-th bit, measured from the least significant bit, of the address of the manual box P is denoted by the "address AD.b" For example, when b=0, the address AD.b represents the least significant bit, and when b=7 the address AD.b represents the most significant bit.

      <br/>
      If the judgement result is positive, the process exits from the routine.
      <br/>
      This allows the fire alarming signal receiving device RE to detect all manual boxs in activated states by performing the point polling operation repeatedly, wherein one manual box in an activated state is detected in each execution of the point polling operation and thus all activated manual boxs are detected one by one in the order of increasing addresses with the progress of the point polling operation.

      This means that the manual box P monitors the signal line over the predetermined time period to determine whether the b-th bit, measured from the least significant bit, of the address transmitted over the signal line from another manual box is 0 or 1.

      If the microprocessor concludes in step U404 that the received signal is not a status information transmission request, then the microprocessor judges in step U406 whether the received signal is a fire reset command.
      <br/>
      If the received signal is a fire reset command (U406), the fire alarming signal receiving circuit FSR and the local-area audible-alarm controller LAC are reset (step U407).
      <br/>
      If the command CM1 is not a fire reset command but a storage reset command (step U408), the fire alarming signal receiving circuit FSR is reset (step U409).
      <br/>
      If the command CM1 is not a storage reset command but a local sound stop command (step U410), the local-area audible-alarm controller LAC is turned off (step U411).
      <br/>
      If the command CM1 is not a local sound stop command but a voice-alarm stop command (step U412), the voice alarm control circuit BAC is turned off (step U413).
      <br/>
      If it is concluded in step U412 that the command CM1 is not a voice-alarm stop command, the process exits from the routine.
    </p>
    <p num="260">
      In the point polling operation according to the above specific embodiment, the command CM1 designates whether the status information or the terminal type indicating information ID should be transmitted, and the command CM2 designates a specific group.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, however, the command CM2 may be used to designate whether the status information or the terminal type indicating information ID should be transmitted, and the command CM1 may be used to designate a specific group.
    </p>
    <p num="261">
      On the other hand, in the system polling operation and also in the selecting operation according to the above specific embodiment, the command CM2 is not used.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, when the fire alarming signal receiving device RE transmits to a terminal device an indication lamp turn-off command telling that the indication lamp of the fire sensor should be turned off, the fire alarming signal receiving device RE may transmit the command CM1 to indicate that the command is concerned with the control of the indication lamp, and may transmit the command CM2 to indicate that the lamp should be turned off, as well as the address AD and the primary checksum code PS.
    </p>
    <p num="262">
      Although in the above embodiment, the selecting operation is described for the transmitter RP, the selecting operation for a fire sensor such as a photoelectric fire sensor S may also be performed in a similar manner except that neither the local sound stop command nor the voice-alarm stop command is used in the operation.
      <br/>
      The selecting operation for a manual box P may also be performed in a similar manner except that the storage reset command, the local sound stop command, and the voice-alarm stop command are not used in the operation.
    </p>
    <p num="263">In the point polling operation according to the above embodiment, the width of time slots used by the fire alarming signal receiving device to receive the status information or the terminal type indicating information as well as the turning-back data D1 and the secondary checksum code SS from the respective terminal devices of one group is set such that the width increases with the intragroup terminal device number m.</p>
    <p num="264">
      By way of example, FIG. 23 illustrates the time slots for group number 1.
      <br/>
      As can be seen, the slot with increases as the intragroup terminal device number m increases from m=0h to m=10h.
      <br/>
      The clock frequencies of the MPU1, MPU2, MPU3, and MPU4 used in the fire alarming signal receiving device RE or the terminal devices have variations of the order of 1% relative to the specified values.
      <br/>
      The increasing expansion in the slot width can absorb the deviations in the timing arising from the above variations and thus ensuring that the returning-back data D1 and the secondary checksum code SS can be transmitted from the terminal device to the fire alarming signal receiving device without a failure due to the deviation in the transmission timing.
    </p>
    <p num="265">Furthermore, in the above embodiment, the address AD, the command CM1, and the primary checksum code PS stored in the RAM 341, RAM 342, and RAM 344 are transferred to other RAM s. Instead, the address AD, the command CM1, and the primary checksum code PS may be kept in the RAM 341, RAM 342, and RAM 344 without being transferred, and they may be used in the system processing operation or the selecting operation.</p>
    <p num="266">
      In the above embodiment, it is checked whether an error occurs during the point polling operation.
      <br/>
      The error checking may also be performed not only in the point polling operation but also in the system polling operation or the selecting operation.
    </p>
    <p num="267">
      In the above embodiment, the secondary checksum code and the secondary calculation code are calculated using the primary checksum code PS.

    <p num="269">FIG. 24 is a block diagram illustrating a photoelectric fire sensor Sa according to another embodiment of the invention.</p>
    <p num="270">
      FIG. 25 is a block diagram illustrating a fire alarming signal receiving device REa according to still another embodiment of the invention.
      <br/>
      The photoelectric fire sensor Sa includes a signal inverting circuit SIC1 serving as signal inverting means disposed between an interface IF23 and a signal transmitter/receiver TRX2 wherein the signal inverting circuit SIC1 operates only when a returning-back data or a secondary checksum code is transmitted.
      <br/>
      On the other hand, the fire alarming signal receiving device REa includes a signal inverting circuit SIC2 serving as signal inverting means disposed between an interface IF13 and a signal transmitter/receiver TRX1 wherein the signal inverting circuit SIC2 operates only in a terminal device field.
      <br/>
      The signal inverting circuit SIC2 converts an active bit into an inactive bit and converts an inactive bit into an active bit.
    </p>
    <p num="271">
      Except for the above, other parts are similar to those employed in the previous embodiments.
      <br/>
      With the above arrangement, an active bit becomes a low-level signal when transmitted from the signal transmitter/receiver TRX1 over the signal line L, and an inactive bit becomes a high-level signal when transmitted from the signal transmitter/receiver TRX1 over the signal line L. On the other hand, a low-level signal on the signal line L is converted to an active bit by the signal inverting circuit SIC2 after output from the signal transmitter/receiver TRX1, and a high-level signal on the signal line L is converted to an inactive bit by the signal inverting circuit SIC2 after output from the signal transmitter/receiver TRX1.
      <br/>
      If a low-level signal and a high-level signal collide with each other on the signal line L, the results is a high-level signal.
    </p>
    <p num="272">In the fire alarming signal receiving device REa with the above signal inverting circuit SIC2 according to the present embodiment, when an active bit and an inactive bit are transmitted from a plurality of terminal devices at the same time, only the active bit can arrive at the fire alarming signal receiving device.</p>
    <p num="273">The point polling operation according to the above embodiment will be described in greater detail below with reference to specific values of various parameters (mainly, S401 to S426, U4 to U12, U101 to U113).</p>
    <p num="274">It is assumed here that when the fire sensor Sa detects an event of a fire, the MPU2 of the fire sensor Sa transmits status information D1 having a value of 01h, while the MPU2 of the fire sensor Sa transmits status information D1 having a value of 00h when no fire is detected.</p>
    <p num="275">
      It is further assumed that there are provided fire sensors D11 and D22 of the same type as the above fire sensor Sa wherein an equal address 1 is assigned to both fire sensors D11 and D22.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, the fire sensor D11 is assumed to have detected an event of a fire while the fire sensor D22 is assumed to be in a normal state in which no fire is detected.
    </p>
    <p num="276">The fire alarming signal receiving device REa transmits codes including an address AD, a command CM1, a command CM2, a primary checksum code PS having 2-digit hexadecimal numbers FFh, 01h, 00h, and 00h (11111111, 00000001, 00000000, 00000000 in the form of 8-bit binary numbers), respectively.</p>
    <p num="277">The MPU2a of the fire sensor D11 transmits a returning-back data D1a having a value of 01h (00000001 in the form of an 8-bit binary number) indicating that a fire has been detected, and also transmits 01h as the secondary checksum code SS1a.</p>
    <p num="278">On the other hand, the MPU2b of the fire sensor D22 transmits a returning-back data D1b having a value of 00h (00000000 in the form of an 8-bit binary number) indicating that no fire is detected, and also transmits 00h as the secondary checksum code SS1b.</p>
    <p num="279">
      In this embodiment, as described above, when an active bit and an inactive bit are transmitted over the signal line L at the same time (that is, a collision occurs between signals on the signal line L), only the active bit can arrive at the fire alarming signal receiving device REa.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the fire alarming signal receiving device REa receives 01h as the returning-back data and 01h as the secondary checksum code.
      <br/>
      Thus, the fire alarming signal receiving device REa concludes that a fire is detected by a fire sensor having an address of 1.
    </p>
    <p num="280">FIG. 26 is a schematic illustration of the signals generated by the two fire sensors D11 and D22 as well as the signal on the signal line L.</p>
    <p num="281">To avoid the problems in the conventional technique, the checksum may be calculated as follows.</p>
    <p num="282">
      The number of active bits of all codes transmitted over the signal line L is counted, and resultant value is inverted.
      <br/>
      The most significant bit of the inverted value is removed.
      <br/>
      The value obtained in this way is employed as the checksum value.
      <br/>
      In the case of the selecting operation, the maximum possible number of active bits is 8 * 4+8 * 3=56.
    </p>
    <p num="283">
      For example, when the address AD=FFh, the command CM1=01h, the command CM2=03h, and the returning-back data D1=07h, the address AD=FFh can be represented as "11111111" in binary form, and thus the number of active bits is 8 which can be represented as 8h in hexadecimal form.
      <br/>
      Similarly, the command CM1=01h can be represented as "00000001" in binary form, and thus the number of active bits is 1 which can be represented as 1h in hexadecimal form.
      <br/>
      The command CM2=03h can be represented as "00000011" in binary form, and thus the number of active bits is 2 which can be represented as 2h in hexadecimal form.
    </p>
    <p num="284">
      Adding the numbers of active bits of the address AD, the command CM1, and the command CM2 results in 8h+1h+2h=0Bh which can be represented as "00001011" in binary form.
      <br/>
      If this value is inverted, then the result is "11110100" which can be represented as F4h in hexadecimal form.
      <br/>
      If the most significant bit of "11110100", which is a binary representation of F4h, is removed, the result is "01110100" which can be represented as 74h in hexadecimal form.
      <br/>
      Thus, 74h is employed as the secondary checksum code SS.
    </p>
    <p num="285">The removal of the most significant bit of "11110100" (F4h in hexadecimal form) can be accomplished by performing an AND operation between "11110100" (F4h) and "01111111" (7Fh).</p>
    <p num="286">Since the primary checksum code PS having a value of 74h obtained in the above-described manner can be represented as "01110100", the number of active bits is 4 which can be represented as 4h in hexadecimal form.</p>
    <p num="287">On the other hand, the returning-back data D1=07h can be represented as "00000111" in binary form, and thus the number of active bits is 3 which can be represented as 3h in hexadecimal form.</p>
    <p num="288">
      If the numbers of active bits of the address AD, the command CM1, the command CM2, and the primary checksum code PS1, and the returning-back data D1, then the result is 8h+1h+2h+4h+3h=12h, which can be represented as "00010010" in binary form.
      <br/>
      Thus, "11101101" is obtained as an inverted form.
      <br/>
      This can be represented as EDh in hexadecimal form.
      <br/>
      If the most significant bit of "11101101" (EDh) is removed, then the result is "01101101" which can be represented as 6Dh in hexadecimal form.
      <br/>
      Thus, 6Dh is employed as the secondary checksum code SS.

    <p num="292">Furthermore, in the above embodiment, said third active bit counting means also counts the number of active bits contained in the primary sum code; and said fourth active bit counting means also counts the number of active bits contained in the primary sum code.</p>
    <p num="293">
      In the above embodiment of the invention, the terminal devices can transmit a fire alarm signal to the fire alarming signal receiving device without encountering an error even when an equal address is assigned to different terminal devices.
