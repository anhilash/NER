      The present invention relates to cleansing wipes comprising absorbent sheets impregnated with antimicrobial cleansing compositions.
      <br/>
      These cleansing wipes provide enhanced antimicrobial effectiveness compared to prior art compositions.
      <br/>
      Specifically, the cleansing wipe personal cleansing compositions of the invention provide previously unseen immediate germ reduction.
    </p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">
      Human health is impacted by many microbial entities.
      <br/>
      Inoculation by viruses and bacteria cause a wide variety of sicknesses and ailments.
      <br/>
      Media attention to cases of food poisoning, strep infections, and the like is increasing public awareness of microbial issues.
    </p>
    <p num="3">
      It is well known that the washing of hard surfaces, food (e.g. fruit or vegetables) and skin, especially the hands, with antimicrobial or non-medicated soap, can remove many viruses and bacteria from the washed surfaces.
      <br/>
      Removal of the viruses and bacteria is due to the surfactancy of the soap and the mechanical action of the wash procedure.
      <br/>
      Therefore, it is known and recommended that the people wash frequently to reduce the spread of viruses and bacteria.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      Bacteria found on the skin can be divided into two groups: resident and transient bacteria.
      <br/>
      Resident bacteria are Gram positive bacteria which are established as permanent microcolonies on the surface and outermost layers of the skin and play an important, helpful role in preventing the colonization of other, more harmful bacteria and fungi.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      Transient bacteria are bacteria which are not part of the normal resident flora of the skin, but can be deposited when airborne contaminated material lands on the skin or when contaminated material is brought into physical contact with it.
      <br/>
      Transient bacteria are typically divided into two subclasses: Gram positive and Gram negative.
      <br/>
      Gram positive bacteria include pathogens such as Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes and Clostridium botulinum.
      <br/>
      Gram negative bacteria include pathogens such as Salmonella, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella, Haemophilus.
      <br/>
      Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus and Shigella dysenteriae.
      <br/>
      Gram negative bacteria are generally distinguished from Gram positive by an additional protective cell membrane which generally results in the Gram negative bacteria being less susceptible to topical antibacterial actives.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      Antimicrobial cleansing products have been marketed in a variety of forms for some time.
      <br/>
      Forms include deodorant soaps, hard surface cleaners, and surgical disinfectants.
      <br/>
      These traditional rinse-off antimicrobial products have been formulated to provide bacteria reduction during washing.
      <br/>
      For example, Dial.RTM. liquid soaps, when used in hand washing, have been found to reduce the amount of the bacteria on the skin by from about 2.0 log (97%) to about 2.5 log (99.7%) in one 30 second handwash, as measured by standard Health Care Personal Handwash Tests (HCPHWT).
      <br/>
      That is skin washed with these soaps were contaminated with only 0.3%-3% of the number of bacteria compared to before washing.
      <br/>
      Antimicrobial liquid cleansers are disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,847,072, Bissett et al., issued Jul. 11, 1989, U.S. Pat. No. 4,939,284, Degenhardt, issued Jul. 3, 1990 and U.S. Pat. No. 4,820,698, Degenhardt, issued Apr. 11, 1989, all of which are incorporated herein by reference.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      Some of these antimicrobial products, especially the hard surface cleaners and surgical disinfectants, utilize high levels of alcohol and/or harsh surfactants which have been shown to dry out and irritate skin tissues.
      <br/>
      Dial.RTM. bar soap has been found to provide from 2.5 to 3.0 log reduction in bacteria in one wash, as measured by the HCPHWT.
      <br/>
      However, Dial.RTM. can be drying to the skin with repeated use.
      <br/>
      Hibiclens.RTM. Surgical Scrub provides 2.5 to 3.0 log reduction in germs in one wash, however it utilizes a potent cationic antibacterial agent, chlorohexidine, which has product safety concerns.
      <br/>
      Ideal personal cleansers should gently cleanse the skin, cause little or no irritation, and not leave the skin overly dry after frequent use and preferably should provide a moisturizing benefit to the skin.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      Finally, these traditional antimicrobial compositions have been developed for use in a washing process with water.
      <br/>
      This limits their use to locations with available water.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      Cleansing wipes have been used, in the past, to wash hands and face while traveling or in public or anytime water is not available.
      <br/>
      In fact, consumers have used absorbent sheets impregnated with topical compositions for a variety of purposes. U.S. Pat. No. 4,045,364, Richter, et al., issued Aug. 30, 1977 teaches a dry disposable paper impregnated with a germicidal composition comprising an anionic surfactant, an elemental iodine or iodophor active ingredient and a weak acid for pH adjustment.
      <br/>
      The compositions utilize iodine actives which are not stable in the presence of substantial amounts of water and insufficient acid levels to provide the improved immediate germ reduction of the present invention.
      <br/>
      European Patent Application, EP 0 619 074, Touchet et al., published Oct. 12, 1994, teaches the use of sorbic or benzoic acids as antimicrobial agents in a wipe, however does not teach the anionic surfactant and separate antimicrobial active necessary to achieve the residual effectiveness of the present invention. U.S. Pat. No. 4,975,217, Brown-Skrobot et al., issued Dec. 4, 1990 teaches the use of anionic surfactants and organic acids on a wipe, however does not teach the use of the active required to provide the improved residual effectiveness benefits.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      Currently marketed Nice'n Clean.RTM., Wash'n Dry.RTM. and No More Germies.RTM. are all antibacterial wipes which utilize harsh cationic surfactants with no additional antibacterial active.
      <br/>
      These products do not provide the improved immediate germ reduction and are harsh to the skin.
      <br/>
      Current wipes have been found to give about 1.0 log reduction of germs in One-wash tests.
    </p>
    <p num="11">
      PCT application WO 92/18100, Keegan et al., published Oct. 29, 1992 and PCT application WO 95/32705, Fujiwara et al., published Dec. 7, 1995 teach non-wipe liquid skin cleansers comprising mild surfactants, antibacterial agents and acidic compounds to buffer the pH which provide improved germ hostility.
      <br/>
      However, the use of the acid compounds for only pH adjustment therein, results in compositions which do not deliver the undissociated acid required to provide the improved immediate germ reduction of the present invention.
      <br/>
      This situation is compounded in Keegan and Fujiwara by the preference of mild surfactants, including nonionic surfactants.
      <br/>
      Neither Keegan nor Fujiwara teach the use of their compositions in a form which can be used without available water, e.g. a wipe.
    </p>
    <p num="12">
      Hibiclens.RTM. Surgical Scrub provides 2.5 to 3.0 log reduction in germs in one wash, and U.S. Pat. No. 3,141,821, issued to Compeau Jul. 21, 1964; Irgasan DP 300 (Triclosan) .RTM.) technical literature from Ciba-Giegy, Inc., "Basic Formulation for Hand Disinfection 89/42/01"; Bartzokas, C. A., et al, "Evaluation of the Skin Disinfecting Activity and Cumulative Effect of Chlorhexidine and Triclosan Handwash Preparations on Hands Artificially Contaminated with Serratia marcescens", Infection Control, 1987/Vol. 8, No. 4; all set forth antibacterial skin cleansers compositions which could provide improved immediate germ reduction using certain anionic surfactants, antimicrobial actives and acids.
      <br/>
      However, the selection, therein, of highly active surfactants or cationic actives with safety issues (i.e. chlorohexidine gluconate) results in personal cleansing compositions which are drying and harsh, or potentially unsafe to use.
    </p>
    <p num="13">
      Given the health impacts of bacteria like Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes and Clostridium botulinum, it would be highly desirable to formulate antimicrobial cleansing products which provides improved immediate germ reduction on the skin, which are mild to the skin and which can be used without water.
      <br/>
      Existing products have been unable to deliver all of these benefits.
    </p>
    <p num="14">
      Applicants have found that antimicrobial wipes which provide such mildness and a new level of immediate germ reduction can be formulated by using known porous or absorbent sheets which are impregnated with improved antimicrobial cleansing compositions.
      <br/>
      These improved antimicrobial cleansing compositions contain antibacterial actives in combination with specific organic and/or inorganic acids as proton donating agents, and specific anionic surfactants, all of which are deposited on the skin.
      <br/>
      The deposited proton donating agent and anionic surfactant enhance the selected active, to provide a new level of hostility to bacteria contacting the skin.

      "Signs of skin aging" include, but are not limited to, all outward visibly and tactilely perceptible manifestations as well as any other macro or micro effects due to skin aging.
      <br/>
      Such signs may be induced or caused by intrinsic factors or extrinsic factors, e.g., chronological aging and/or environmental damage.
      <br/>
      These signs may result from processes which include, but are not limited to, the development of textural discontinuities such as wrinkles, including both fine superficial wrinkles and coarse deep wrinkles, skin lines, crevices, bumps, large pores (e.g., associated with adnexal structures such as sweat gland ducts, sebaceous glands, or hair follicles), scaliness, flakiness and/or other forms of skin unevenness or roughness, loss of skin elasticity (loss and/or inactivation of functional skin elastin), sagging (including puffiness in the eve area and jowls), loss of skin firmness, loss of skin tightness, loss of skin recoil from deformation, discoloration (including undereye circles), blotching, sallowness, hyperpigmented skin regions such as age spots and freckles, keratoses, abnormal differentiation, hyperkeratinization, elastosis, collagen breakdown, and other histological changes in the stratum corneum, dermis, epidermis, the skin vascular system (e.g., telangiectasia or spider vessels), and underlying tissues, especially those proximate to the skin.

      The invention hereof can comprise, consist of, or consist essentially of, the essential as well as optional ingredients and components described therein.
    </p>
    <p num="23">The antimicrobial wipes of the present invention comprise the following essential components.</p>
    <p num="24">A. THE POROUS OR ABSORBENT SHEET</p>
    <p num="25">
      The antimicrobial cleansing composition is impregnated at the desired weight onto one or both sides of an absorbent sheet (hereinafter sometimes referred to as "substrate") which may be formed from any woven or nonwoven fiber, fiber mixture or foam of sufficient wet strength and absorbency to hold an effective amount of the antimicrobial cleansing composition.
      <br/>
      It is preferred from the standpoint of antimicrobial effectiveness and mildness to employ substrates with a high absorbent capacity (e.g., from about 5 to about 20 grams/gram, preferably from about 9 to about 20 grams/gram).
      <br/>
      The absorbent capacity of a substrate is the ability of the substrate, while supported horizontally, to hold liquid.
      <br/>
      The absorbent capacity of a substrate is measured according to the Absorbent Capacity Method set forth hereinafter in the Analytical Methods section.
    </p>
    <p num="26">
      In particular, woven or nonwoven fabrics derived from "oriented" or carded fibrous webs composed of textile-length fibers, the major proportion of which are oriented predominantly in one direction are suitable for use herein.
      <br/>
      These fabrics can be in the form of, for example, wipes or towelettes, including baby wipes and the like.
    </p>
    <p num="27">
      Methods of making woven and nonwoven cloths are not a part of this invention and, being well known in the art, are not described in detail herein.
      <br/>
      Generally, however, such cloths are made by air- or water-laying processes in which the fibers or filaments are first cut to desired lengths from long strands, passed into a water or air stream, and then deposited onto a screen through which the fiber-laden air or water is passed.
      <br/>
      The deposited fibers or filaments are then adhesively bonded together, and otherwise treated as desired to form the woven, nonwoven, or cellulose cloth.
    </p>
    <p num="28">Thermocarded nonwoven cloths (whether or not resin-containing) are made of polyesters, polyamides, or other thermoplastic fibers which can be spand bonded, i.e., the fibers are spun out onto a flat surface and bonded (melted) together by heat or chemical reactions.</p>
    <p num="29">
      The nonwoven cloth substrates used in the invention herein are generally adhesively bonded fibers or filamentous products having a web or carded fiber structure (when the fiber strength is suitable to allow carding) or comprising fibrous mats in which the fibers or filaments are distributed haphazardly or in random array (i.e., an array of fibers in a carded web where partial orientation of the fibers is frequently present, as well as a completely haphazard distributional orientation), or substantially aligned.
      <br/>
      The fibers or filaments can be natural (e.g., wool, silk, jute, hemp, cotton, linen, sisal, or ramie) or synthetic (e.g., rayon, cellulose ester, polyvinyl derivatives, polyolethins, polyamides, or polyesters) as have been described hereinabove.
      <br/>
      These nonwoven materials are generally described in Riedel "Nonwoven Bonding Methods and Materials", Nonwoven World, (1987).
    </p>
    <p num="30">
      The absorbent properties preferred herein are particularly easy to obtain with nonwoven cloths and are provided merely by building up the thickness of the cloth, i.e., by superimposing a plurality of carded webs or mats to a thickness adequate to obtain the necessary absorbent properties, or by allowing a sufficient thickness of the fibers to deposit on the screen.
      <br/>
      Any denier of the fiber (generally up to about 15 denier) can be used, inasmuch as it is the free space between each fiber that makes the thickness of the cloth directly related to the absorbent capacity of the cloth.
      <br/>
      Thus, any thickness necessary to obtain the required absorbent capacity can be used.
    </p>
    <p num="31">B. THE ANTIMICROBIAL CLEANSING COMPOSITION</p>
    <p num="32">
      The absorbent sheets used in the present invention are impregnated with an antimicrobial cleansing composition.
      <br/>
      The term "antimicrobial cleansing composition" as used herein means a composition suitable for application to a surface for the purpose of removing dirt, oil and the like which additionally reduces the number of germs on the surface.
      <br/>
      The compositions, herein, are effective against Gram positive bacteria, Gram negative bacteria, fungi, yeasts, molds, and viruses.
      <br/>
      Preferred embodiments of the present invention are cleansing compositions suitable for use on the human skin.
    </p>
    <p num="33">I. INGREDIENTS</p>
    <p num="34">
      The antimicrobial cleansing compositions of the wipes of the present invention comprise an antimicrobial active, an anionic surfactant, and a proton donating agent.
      <br/>
      These components are selected so that the efficacy and optional mildness requirements hereinafter defined for the compositions herein are met.
      <br/>
      The selection of each component is necessarily dependent on the selection of each of the other components.
      <br/>
      For example, if a weak acid is selected as the proton donating agent, then in order to realize an efficacious composition, either a more biologically active (but possibly less mild) surfactant must be employed, and/or a high level of acid within the prescribed range must be used and/or a particularly efficacious active must be employed.
      <br/>
      Similarly, if a mild, but nonefficacious surfactant is employed, then a stronger acid and/or a high level of acid may be necessary to realize an efficacious composition.
      <br/>
      If a harsh surfactant is utilized, then a mildness agent may have to be utilized.
      <br/>
      Guidelines for the selection of the individual components are provided herein.
    </p>
    <p num="35">The Antimicrobial Active</p>
    <p num="36">
      The antimicrobial cleansing composition of the antimicrobial wipes of the present invention comprises from about 0.001% to about 5%, preferably from about 0.05% to about 1%, more preferably from about 0.05% to about 0.5% and more preferably from about 0.1% to about 0.25%, by weight of the antimicrobial cleansing composition, of an antimicrobial active.
      <br/>
      The exact amount of antibacterial active to be used in the compositions will depend on the particular active utilized since actives vary in potency.
      <br/>
      Non-cationic actives are required in order to avoid interaction with the anionic surfactants of the invention.

      Another class of antibacterial agents, which are useful in the present invention, are the so-called "natural" antibacterial actives, referred to as natural essential oils.
      <br/>
      These actives derive their names from their natural occurrence in plants.
      <br/>
      Typical natural essential oil antibacterial actives include oils of anise, lemon, orange, rosemary, wintergreen, thyme, lavender, cloves, hops, tea tree, citronella, wheat, barley, lemongrass, cedar leaf, cedarwood, cinnamon, fleagrass, geranium, sandalwood, violet, cranberry, eucalyptus, vervain, peppermint, gum benzoin, basil, fennel, fir, balsam, menthol, ocmea origanum, Hydastis carradensis, Berberidaceae daceae, Ratanhiae and Curcunia longa.
      <br/>
      Also included in this class of natural essential oils are the key chemical components of the plant oils which have been found to provide the antimicrobial benefit.
      <br/>
      These chemicals include, but are not limited to anethol, catechole, camphene, carvacol, eugenol, eucalyptol, ferulic acid, farnesol, hinokitiol, tropolone, limonene, menthol, methyl salicylate, thymol, terpineol, verbenone, berberine, ratanhiae extract, caryophellene oxide, citronellic acid, curcumin, nerolidol and geraniol.

    <p num="42">
      Additional active agents are antibacterial metal salts.
      <br/>
      This class generally includes salts of metals in groups 3b-7b, 8 and 3a-5a.
      <br/>
      Specifically are the salts of aluminum, zirconium, zinc, silver, gold, copper, lanthanum, tin, mercury, bismuth, selenium, strontium, scandium, yttrium, cerium, praseodymiun, neodymium, promethum, samarium, europium, gadolinium, terbium, dysprosium, holmium, erbium, thulium, ytterbium, lutetium and mixtures thereof.

    <p num="45">
      The antimicrobial cleansing compositions of the present invention comprise from about 0.05% to about 10%, preferably from about 0.1% to about 2%, and more preferably from about 0.2% to about 1%, by weight of the cleansing composition, of an anionic surfactant.
      <br/>
      Without being limited by theory, it is believed that the anionic surfactant disrupts the lipid in the cell membrane of the bacteria.
      <br/>
      The particular acid used herein reduces the negative charges on the cell wall of the bacteria, crosses through the cell membrane, weakened by the surfactant, and acidifies the cytoplasm of the bacteria.
      <br/>
      The antimicrobial active can then pass more easily through the weakened cell wall, and more efficiently poison the bacteria.

      Anionic surfactants for use in the cleansing compositions include alkyl and alkyl ether sulfates.
      <br/>
      These materials have the respective formulae R1 O--SO3 M and R1 (CH2 H4 O)x --O--SO3 M, wherein R1 is a saturated or unsaturated, branched or unbranched alkyl group from about 8 to about 24 carbon atoms, x is 1 to 10, and M is a water-soluble cation such as ammonium, sodium, potassium, magnesium, triethanolamine, diethanolamine and monoethanolamine.
      <br/>
      The alkyl sulfates are typically made by the sulfation of monohydric alcohols (having from about 8 to about 24 carbon atoms) using sulfur trioxide or other known sulfation technique.
      <br/>
      The alkyl ether sulfates are typically made as condensation products of ethylene oxide and monohydric alcohols (having from about 8 to about 24 carbon atoms) and then sulfated.

    <p num="65">Two factors must be taken into account when selecting the surfactant or surfactants to be employed in the antibacterial cleansing compositions of the antimicrobial wipes herein: 1) the activity of the surfactant molecule at the cell membrane of the bacteria; and 2) the mildness of the surfactant insofar as it affects the Mildness Index (hereinafter described) for the antibacterial composition.</p>
    <p num="66">Biological Activity/Mildness of Surfactant</p>
    <p num="67">
      In general, the higher the biological activity of the surfactant, the more residual effectiveness is provided by the composition comprising the surfactant.
      <br/>
      Typically, however, the biological activity of a surfactant and the mildness of a surfactant are inversely proportional; the higher the biological activity of the surfactant, the harsher the surfactant and the lower the biological activity of the surfactant, the milder the surfactant.
      <br/>
      Whether a biologically active, but harsh surfactant or a mild, but biologically inactive surfactant is desired will, of course, depend on (or influence) the selection of the other components.
    </p>
    <p num="68">
      The biological activity/mildness of a pure surfactant can measured directly via a Microtox Response Test hereinafter described in the Analytical Methods section and can be reported as a Microtox Response Index.
      <br/>
      By "pure surfactant" it is meant a chemical composition consisting essentially of a singale surfactant entity, wherein the entity has essentially one chain length, head group and salt counter ion.
      <br/>
      From a standpoint of high biological activity, preferred anionic surfactants of the antimicrobial cleansing compositions of the present invention have a Microtox Response Index of less that about 150, more preferably less than about 100 and most preferably less than about 50.
      <br/>
      From a standpoint of mildness, preferred anionic surfactants of the antimicrobial cleansing compositions of the present invention have a Microtox Response Index of greater than about 25, more preferably greater than about 50 and most preferably greater than about 100.
      <br/>
      Surfactants with a Microtox Response Index ranging from about 25 to about 150 are typically moderately biologically active and moderately mild.
    </p>
    <p num="69">
      For surfactant compositions which are mixtures of surfactants rather than pure surfactants (this includes "commercial grade" surfactants which typically comprise mixtures of entities with different chain lengths and potentially have higher levels of impurities), the Microtox Response Index for any individual surfactant component is not a reliable measurement of biological activity or mildness.
      <br/>
      In the case of mixtures, the Microtox Index of each individual component can be determined and the weighted average used as the Index for the mixture if all the individual components of the mixture are known.
      <br/>
      If the individual components of a mixture are not known, then the primary head group and chain lengths of the surfactant mixture are better indicators of biological activity/mildness.
    </p>
    <p num="70">
      Anionic surfactants or mixtures of surfactants with a chain length primarily in the range of from about 8 to about 24 carbon atoms, preferably primarily from about 10 to about 18 carbon atoms and most preferably primarily from about 12 to about 16 carbon atoms are preferred from the standpoint of high biological activity.
      <br/>
      As used herein "primarily" means at least about 50%.
      <br/>
      From a standpoint of mildness, it is preferable to minimize C12.
    </p>
    <p num="71">
      From the standpoint of biological activity, it is preferred that the head group of the anionic surfactant be less than about 15 Angstroms, preferably less than about 10 Angstroms, and more preferably less than about 7 Angstroms.
      <br/>
      The "head group" is defined as the hydrophilic portion (non-hydrocarbon) of the anionic surfactant, measured from the first polar atom to the end of the molecule.
      <br/>
      The head group size is estimated from the Van der Waals radius of the atoms and the configuration of the surfactant molecule.
      <br/>
      Head groups with sizes less than about 7 Angstroms include sulfates, sulfonates, and phosphates.
      <br/>
      From the standpoint of mildness, it is preferred that the head group size is greater than about 7 Angstroms, and preferably greater than about 10 Angstroms.
      <br/>
      Head groups with sizes greater than about 10 Angstroms include ethoxylated sulfates, glyceryl ether sulfonates, and isethionates.
      <br/>
      It is believed that as the head group size increases, more stearic hindrance at the cell wall prevents disruption by the surfactant and, thus, biological activity is decreased and mildness is increased.
    </p>
    <p num="72">
      The mildness of a surfactant or mixture of surfactants can also be determined by a number of other known, conventional methods for measuring surfactant mildness.
      <br/>
      For example, the Barrier Destruction Test set forth in T. J. Franz, J. Invest. Dermatol., 1975, 64, pp. 190-195 and in U.S. Pat. No. 4,673,525 to Small et al; issued Jun. 16, 1987, both of which are herein incorporated by reference, is a way of measuring mildness of surfactants.
      <br/>
      In general, the milder the surfactant, the less skin barrier that is destroyed in the barrier destruction test.
      <br/>
      Skin barrier destruction is measured by relative amount of radiolabeled water which passes from the test solution through the skin epidermis into the physiological buffer contained in the diffusate chamber.
      <br/>
      Surfactants having a Relative Skin Barrier Penetration Value of as close to zero as possible up to about 75 are considered mild for purposes herein.
      <br/>
      Surfactants having a Relative Skin Barrier Penetration Value of greater than about 75 are considered harsh for purposes herein.
    </p>
    <p num="73">In order for the antimicrobial composition of the antimicrobial wipes herein to be effective, both the biological activity of the surfactant and the mildness of the surfactant and acid employed in the composition must be taken into account.</p>
    <p num="74">
      For example, ammonium lauryl sulfate, ALS, is very biologically active (Microtox Index=1.0).
      <br/>
      Compositions comprising ALS are capable of providing very effective residual antibacterial effectiveness due to its activity, even with lower levels of antibacterial active and proton donating agent.
      <br/>
      However, compositions containing ALS may require the addition of co-surfactants or polymers, described herein in the Optional Ingredient Section, to achieve most preferred mildness levels for the present invention.
    </p>
    <p num="75">A selection of ammonium laureth-3 sulfate (Microtox=120) as a surfactant will result in compositions which are very mild, but which would require higher levels of proton donating agent and antimicrobial active in order to achieve the residual effectiveness of the present invention.</p>
    <p num="76">
      Paraffin sulfonate, a commercial grade surfactant sold under the name Hastapur SAS.RTM. from Hoechst Celanese, with a small head group and average chain length of 15.5 is a relatively active surfactant.
      <br/>
      Compositions comprising lower levels of active and acid can be used with higher levels of paraffin sulfonate, where the surfactant provides a larger component of residual effectiveness.
      <br/>
      Alternately, compositions comprising lower levels of paraffin sulfonate can be combined with even higher levels of active to achieve a mild and effective composition.

      Another class of stabilizer which can be employed in the antimicrobial cleansing compositions of the present invention comprises dispersed amorphous silica selected from the group consisting of fumed silica and precipitated silica and mixtures thereof.
      <br/>
      As used herein the term "dispersed amorphous silica" refers to small, finely divided non-crystalline silica having a mean agglomerate particle size of less than about 100 microns.
    </p>
    <p num="113">
      Fumed silica, which is also known as arced silica, is produced by the vapor phase hydrolysis of silicon tetrachloride in a hydrogen oxygen flame.
      <br/>
      It is believed that the combustion process creates silicone dioxide molecules which condense to form particles.
      <br/>
      The particles collide, attach and sinter together.
      <br/>
      The result of this process is a three dimensional branched chain aggregate.
      <br/>
      Once the aggregate cools below the fusion point of silica, which is about 1710 (degree)  C., further collisions result in mechanical entanglement of the chains to form agglomerates.
      <br/>
      Precipitated silicas and silica gels are generally made in aqueous solution.
      <br/>

    <p num="138">
      The stock solution of the test anionic surfactant sample is prepared and used as a stock solution from which all other dilutions are made.
      <br/>
      The standard "starting concentration", the highest concentration to be tested, is 500 ppm. (If a 500 ppm starting concentration fails to give a calculable result, e.g. an active surfactant kills all reagent at all dilutions, the starting concentration can be adjusted based on a known range of EC50 values of previously tested surfactants.) The stock solution is prepared at two times the starting concentration.
      <br/>
      a) Add 0.1 g (or adjusted amount if required) of anionic surfactant, accounting for activity of raw material, to beaker.
      <br/>
      b) Microtox Diluent (2% NaCl, Microbics Corp.) is added to total 100 g.

    <p num="163">
      Both test and control products are tested on the same arm.
      <br/>
      The following test procedure is used.
      <br/>
      1. The subject wets the entire surface of his/her volar forearm with 95-100 (degree)  F. tap water by holding the arm briefly under running tap water.
      <br/>
      2. A clinical assistant wets one-quarter sheet (approximately 8" * 6") of Masslinn.RTM. towel with tap water, then squeezes the towel gently to remove excess water.
      <br/>
      3. A clinical assistant applies the products to the arm, beginning with the product designated for the site nearest the elbow, using the appropriate procedure as follows:
    </p>
    <p num="164">
      Liquid Product
      <br/>
      a.
      <br/>
      Dispense 0.10 cc of test product from a syringe into the center of the appropriate marked area.
      <br/>
      b. Wet two finders of gloved (latex) hand under the running tap (index and middle fingers).
      <br/>
      c. Move wetted fingers in a circular motion over the application site for 10 seconds to lather product.
      <br/>
      d. Lather remains on the application site for 90 seconds, then is rinsed off with running tap water for 15 seconds, taking care not to wash lather off the adjacent sites.
      <br/>
      After 10 seconds of the rinse has expired, the Clinical Assistant will gently rub the site being rinsed with her two gloved fingers for the remaining 5 seconds of the rinse.

      <br/>
      b. Wet bar by holding bar briefly under running tap water.
      <br/>
      Test bars must be wet under a running tap at the start of each day.
      <br/>
      c. Rub wetted fingers in a circular motion, over the surface of the bar, for 15 seconds to form lather on bar and fingers.
      <br/>
      d. Rub the lathered fingers on the application site in a circular motion for 10seconds to lather product on the skin.
      <br/>
      e. Lather remains on the application site for 90 seconds, then is rinsed off with running tap water for 15 seconds, taking care not to wash lather off the adjacent sites.
      <br/>
      After 10 seconds of the rinse has expired, the Clinical Assistant will gently rub the site being rinsed with her two gloved fingers for the remaining 5 seconds of the rinse.

    <p num="172">The FCAT generally produces only mild to moderate skin irritation; however, if a treated site reaches a rating of 5.0 or greater, at any time during the study, treatment of all sites on that subject should be discontinued.</p>
    <p num="173">Data</p>
    <p num="174">
      After all subjects have been evaluated at the end of the test, the following values are determined:
      <br/>
      Rco =The average rating of control product area at baseline
      <br/>
      Rcf =The average rating of control product area at test end
      <br/>

      <br/>
      Rtf =The average rating if test product area at test end.
    </p>
    <p num="175">
      There are many external conditions which could influence the FCAT, such as relative humidity and water softness.
      <br/>
      The test is valid only if sufficient response is observed in the skin to the control product.
      <br/>
      The control response must be greater than 1.0 (i.e., Rcf -Rco &gt;= 1.0) for the test to be valid.
    </p>
    <p num="176">Given a valid test, the Mildness Index of the test product is the difference in the skin responses to two products.</p>

    <p num="178">CONSISTENCY (k) AND SHEAR INDEX (n) OF THE LIPOPHILIC SKIN MOISTURIZING AGENT</p>
    <p num="179">
      The Carrimed CSL 100 Controlled Stress Rheometer is used to determine Shear Index, n, and Consistency, k, of the lipophilic skin moisturizing agent used herein.
      <br/>
      The determination is performed at 35 (degree)  C. with the 4 cm 2 (degree)  cone measuring system typically set with a 51 micron gap and is performed via the programmed application of a shear stress (typically from about 0.06 dynes/sq. cm to about 5,000 dynes/sq. cm) over time.
      <br/>
      If this stress results in a deformation of the sample, i.e. strain of the measuring geometry of at least 10-4 rad/sec, then this rate of strain is reported as a shear rate.
      <br/>
      These data are used to create a viscosity  MU  Vs. shear rate  GAMMA ' flow curve for the material.
      <br/>
      This flow curve can then be modeled in order to provide a mathematical expression that describes the material's behavior within specific limits of shear stress and shear rate.
      <br/>
      These results were fitted with the following well accepted power law model (see for instance: Chemical Engineering, by Coulson and Richardson, Pergamon, 1982 or Transport Phenomena by Bird, Stewart and Lightfoot, Wiley, 1960):
      <br/>

    <heading>VISCOSITY OF THE ANTIMICROBIAL CLEANSING COMPOSITION</heading>
    <p num="180">
      The Wells-Brookfield Cone/Plate Model DV-II+Viscometer is used to determine the viscosity of the antimicrobial cleansing compositions herein.
      <br/>
      The determination is performed at 25 (degree)  C. with the 2.4 cm (degree)  cone (Spindle CP-41) measuring system with a gap of 0.013 mm between the two small pins on the respective cone and plate.
      <br/>
      The measurement is performed by injecting 0.5 ml of the sample to be analyzed between the cone and plate and rotating the cone at a set speed of 1 rpm.
      <br/>
      The resistance to the rotation of the cone produces a torque that is proportional to the shear stress of the liquid sample.
      <br/>
      The amount of torque is read and computed by the viscometer into absolute centipoise units (mPa's) based on geometric constants of the cone, the rate of rotation, and the stress related torque.

      A full size substrate sheet is supported horizontally in a tared filament lined basket and weighed to provide the weight of the dry sheet.
      <br/>
      The filament lined basket has crossed filaments which serve to support the sheet horizontally.
      <br/>
      The crossed filaments permit unrestricted movement of water into and out of the substrate sheet.
    </p>
    <p num="183">
      The substrate sheet, still supported in the basket, is lowered into a distilled water bath having a temperature of 73 (degree)  F. +- 2 (degree)  F. for one minute.
      <br/>
      The basket is then raised from the bath and the substrate sheet is allowed to drain for 1 minute.
      <br/>
      The basket and sheet are then re-weighed to obtain the weight of the water absorbed by the substrate sheet.
    </p>
    <p num="184">The Absorbent Capacity, in grams/gram, is calculated by dividing the weight of the water absorbed by the sheet by the weight of the dry sheet. the Absorbent Capacity is reported as an average of at least 8 measurements.</p>
