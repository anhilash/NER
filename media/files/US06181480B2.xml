      Field of the Invention
    </p>
    <p num="2">The present invention relates to a microscope objective, and more particularly relates to a microscope objective that uses visible light and ultraviolet light.</p>
    <p num="3">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
    <p num="4">In recent years, specimens have not only been observed by illumination with visible light in the wavelength region of approximately 400 to 750 nm, but they have also been observed and processed by illumination with light of short wavelengths, such as ultraviolet light.</p>
    <p num="5">
      In viewing specimens through a microscope it is important to correct chromatic aberration simultaneously for both visible light and ultraviolet light in an objective of a microscope that observes a specimen using visible light and ultraviolet light in combination.
      <br/>
      This correction is called achromatism.
      <br/>
      However, there is a limited number of glass materials available that satisfy the achromatism condition for visible light and ultraviolet light.
      <br/>
      Consequently, even though a so-called parfocal length is increased to achieve achromatism, there is a problem in that chromatic aberration cannot be sufficiently corrected.
    </p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="6">It is an object of this invention to overcome the above problems, and an object to provide a microscope objective that is achromatic, so that deviations in focus do not arise with visible light and ultraviolet light (particularly light in the vicinity of wavelength 266 nm), and which can satisfactorily observe a specimen.</p>

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
    <p num="8">
      Reference will now be made in detail to the preferred embodiments of the present invention, examples of which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings, wherein like reference numerals refer to like elements throughout.
      <br/>
      In accordance with the preferred embodiments of the invention there is provided a microscope objective solving the above mentioned problems by providing a microscope objective made of at least three types of glass materials, of which one type is barium fluoride.
    </p>
    <p num="9">Furthermore, the present invention is preferably a microscope objective, includes, objectwise to imagewise: first lens group G1 having a cemented lens and having positive refractive power; second lens group G2 having a cemented lens and having positive refractive power; third lens group G3 having a cemented lens group and having negative refractive power; fourth lens group G4 having positive refractive power; and fifth lens group G5 having negative refractive power.</p>
    <p num="10">In addition, the present invention is preferably a microscope objective that satisfies each of the following conditions: (1) 1.5&lt;.vertline.f1/F.vertline.&lt;5; (2) 5&lt;.vertline.f3/F.vertline.&lt;15; (3) 3&lt;.vertline.f4/F.vertline.&lt;45; (4) 1&lt;.vertline.f5/F.vertline.&lt;10; and (5) (W * h)/(l * F)&gt;0.015), wherein, F is the focal length of the entire microscope objective system, f1 is the focal length of the first lens group, f3 is the focal length of the third lens group, f4 is the focal length of the fourth lens group, f5 is the focal length of the fifth lens group, W is the working distance of the microscope objective, h is the maximum height of the principal ray that enters the lens most objectwise, and l is the parfocal length.</p>
    <p num="11">
      The microscope objective according to preferred embodiments of the present invention uses glass materials having a high transmittance with respect to a visible light wavelength of approximately 400 to 750 nm, and ultraviolet light wavelength of approximately 266 nm.
      <br/>
      In addition, at least three types of glass materials are used in order to achieve achromatism with respect to both lights, one type of glass material among these being barium fluoride (BaF2).
      <br/>
      Furthermore, since barium fluoride is highly deliquescent, it is preferable to use a lens that does not contact air inside the cemented lens.
      <br/>
      Examples of preferred glass materials besides barium fluoride include quartz, fluorite and lithium fluoride.
    </p>
    <p num="12">
      The aforementioned condition (1) specifies the condition for reducing secondary dispersion while maintaining an appropriate relationship between the numerical aperture and the working distance.
      <br/>
      If .vertline.f1/F.vertline. exceeds the upper limit in condition (1), it adversely degrades the balance of secondary dispersion over the entire microscope objective system.
      <br/>
      Conversely, if .vertline.f1/F.vertline. falls below the lower limit in condition (1), first lens group G1 exceeds the limit in which chromatic aberration can be corrected; consequently, the shape of the other lens groups G2 to G5 changes, and chromatic aberration cannot be satisfactorily corrected.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, even better results maybe obtained by setting the upper limit to 3.2.
    </p>
    <p num="13">
      Condition (2) specifies an appropriate range for the focal length of third lens group G3.
      <br/>
      If .vertline.f3/F.vertline. exceeds the upper limit in condition (2), secondary dispersion increases, the effect of using a glass material having a high refractive index in third lens group G3 is lost, and chromatic aberration cannot be sufficiently corrected.
      <br/>
      Conversely, if .vertline.f3/F.vertline. falls below the lower limit in condition (2), aberrations can no longer be corrected by fifth lens group G5 as one group, since the secondary dispersion, which includes the refractive index differential of third lens group G3, adversely increases in a reverse direction compared to when .vertline.f3/F.vertline. exceeds the upper limit.
    </p>
    <p num="14">
      Condition (3) specifies an appropriate range for the focal length of fourth lens group G4.
      <br/>
      If .vertline.f4/F.vertline. exceeds the upper limit in condition (3), secondary dispersion increases, the effect of using a glass material having a high refractive index in fourth lens group G4 is lost and chromatic aberration cannot be sufficiently corrected.
      <br/>
      Conversely, if .vertline.f4/F.vertline. falls below the lower limit in condition (3), secondary dispersion, including the refractive index differential of fourth lens group G4, exceeds the capability to be reduced, and therefore aberrations cannot be corrected by the subsequent lens group.
    </p>
    <p num="15">
      Condition (4) specifies an appropriate range for the focal length of fifth lens group G5, and is a condition for arranging the balance of achromatism of the entire microscope objective system.
      <br/>
      If .vertline.f5/F.vertline. exceeds the upper limit in condition (4), chromatic aberration is undercorrected.
      <br/>
      Conversely, if .vertline.f5/F.vertline. falls below the lower limit in condition (4), chromatic aberration is overcorrected.
    </p>
    <p num="16">
      Condition (5) describes the relationship between the parfocal length, N.A. and the working distance.
      <br/>
      The interchangeability of an objective with other objectives in a microscope is improved by being parfocal.
      <br/>
      By increasing the parfocal length, the working distance can also be lengthened.
      <br/>
      If (W * h)/(l * F) falls below the lower limit in condition (5), the working distance or N.A. is reduced.
    </p>
    <p num="17">In addition, embodiments of the present invention are preferably directed toward a microscope objective, wherein at least one cemented lens in third lens group G3 and in fourth lens group G4 is a cemented lens that has, objectwise to imagewise, a first lens element, second lens element L31 or L41, and a third lens element.</p>
    <p num="18">In addition, the present invention preferably satisfies each of the following conditions: (6) 1.45&lt;n; and (7) 70&lt;v&lt;90, wherein, n is the refractive index with respect to the d-line (X=587.56 nm) of the second lens element L31 or L41, and v is the Abbe number.</p>

      Condition (6) specifies an appropriate range for the refractive index of second lens element L31 or L41, for reducing secondary dispersion.

    <p num="20">
      Condition (7) specifies an appropriate range for the Abbe number of second lens element L31 or L41, also for reducing secondary dispersion.
      <br/>
      If v falls below the lower limit or if v exceeds the upper limit in condition (7), chromatic aberration cannot be sufficiently corrected.
