    <heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="1">The present invention relates to a method and/or architecture for threshold voltage mismatch compensation in the sense transistors of a sense amplifier generally and, more particularly, to threshold voltage mismatch compensation for a first sense stage of an SRAM sense amplifier.</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">An example of a dynamic random access memory voltage mismatch compensated sense amplifier can be found in IEEE JSSC, Vol. 25, No. 7, July 1993 "A High Speed, Small-Area-Threshold Voltage Mismatch Compensation Sense Amplifier for Gigabit-Scale DRAM Arrays", which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.</p>
    <p num="3">
      Such a conventional approach is suitable for Dynamic Random Access Memory (DRAM) arrays, but not as desirable for Static Random Access Memory (SRAM) arrays.
      <br/>
      Another example of a dynamic random access memory voltage mismatch compensated sense amplifier can be found in "Threshold Difference Compensated Sense Amplifier", Shunichi Suzuki and Masaki Hirata, JSSC, Vol.
      <br/>
      SC-14, No. 6, December 1979 is also incorporated by reference in its entirety.

      FIG. 1 shows a conventional uncompensated static random access memory sense amplifier circuit 10.
      <br/>
      Such an approach has one or more of the following disadvantages: (i) no mismatch compensation; (ii) the bitline delta (i.e., differential) required for sensing is 5*94( DELTA Vt)=60 mV for many current SRAM designs; and/or (iii) 60 mV corresponds to a 0.5 ns to 1 ns longer access time for many SRAM designs.

    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="7">
      The present invention concerns a circuit comprising a first and a second sense transistor, a bitline and a complementary bitline, one or more first switches and one or more second switches.

      The first switches may be configured to couple the first sense transistor to the bitline and the second sense transistor to the complementary bitline.
      <br/>
      The second switches may be configured to couple the first sense transistor to the complementary bitline and the second sense transistor to the bitline.
      <br/>
      The first and second switches may be configured to provide voltage threshold matching between the first and second transistors.

    <p num="8">The objects, features and advantages of the present invention include providing an architecture and/or method for voltage mismatch compensation that may (i) allow for an absence of a 60 mV (or more or less) bitline delta (e.g., the voltage needed to overcome a mismatch), (ii) improve the operational speed of a sense amplifier, (iii) provide a sense amplifier suitable for synchronous devices, and/or (iv) may be used for asynchronous devices which use "ATD" (Address Transition Detection) circuitry.</p>

      During a voltage threshold adjust phase, the signal L2 is generally "on" (e.g., a digital HIGH, or 1) and the signal L1 and the signal STROBE are generally "off" (e.g., a digital LOW, or 0).
      <br/>
      However, the particular polarities of the on (e.g., asserted) and off (e.g., de-asserted) states of the control signals L1, L2 and STROBE may be adjusted (e.g., reversed) accordingly to meet the design criteria of a particular implementation.
      <br/>
      The voltages on the nodes Vsl (e.g., the gate to source voltage Vgs of the transistor 110) and Vs2 (e.g., the gate to source voltage Vgs of the transistor 112) are set to the threshold voltages (e.g., Vtg1 and Vtg2) of the transistors 110 and 112, respectively.
      <br/>
      Due to small differences in fabrication, the threshold voltages Vt of the transistor 110 and the transistor 112 will normally be slightly different.
      <br/>
      With the signal L2 on and the signal L1 and the signal STROBE off, the transistors 110 and 112 are generally connected as diodes (e.g., saturated n-channel MOS transistors, in one example).
    </p>
    <p num="12">
      During an evaluation phase, the signal L2 is generally off and the signal L1 is generally on.
      <br/>
      In such a state, the transistors 110 and 112 may be configured as a cross coupled latch.
      <br/>
      The voltages on the bitlines BL and BLB may be passed on to the internal latch nodes.
      <br/>
      The circuit 100 may be fully zero adjusted to compensate for a threshold voltage Vt mismatch between the transistors 110 and 112.
      <br/>
      Fully zero adjusted generally means that the voltages "Vgs1" and "Vgs2" in FIG. 2 compensate for the intrinsically different threshold voltages of the devices 110 and 112.
      <br/>
      The voltage thresholds Vts of the transistor 110 and the transistor 112 are physical manufacturing limits and cannot be changed by circuit techniques.
      <br/>
      The circuit 100 generally sets the sources of 110 and 112 (e.g., "Vgs1" and "Vgs2" in FIG. 2) to slightly different voltages which will compensate for the different voltage thresholds of transistors 110 and 112.
      <br/>
      When the evaluation phase begins, the small bitline differential is amplified exponentially by the latch stage.
    </p>
    <p num="13">
      The circuit 100 may be enabled by the signal STROBE transitioning from low to high.
      <br/>
      The circuit 100 may reduce access time by up to 1 ns when implemented in synchronous/asynchronous (ATD) parts (e.g., 200 MHz-&gt;250 MHz parts).
      <br/>
      The circuit 100 generally combines a cross-coupled sense amplifier with a source biased threshold Vt adjustment.
      <br/>
      The circuit 100 may be implemented, in one example, in an SRAM device.
      <br/>
      However, the circuit 100 may be implemented in other devices, such as DRAMS, SDRAMS, etc.
    </p>
    <p num="14">The circuit 100 may provide a threshold voltage Vt mismatch compensated latched sense amplifier scheme where the compensation Vt bias may be applied to each of the sources of the cross-coupled devices 110 and 112.</p>
    <p num="15">
      One advantage of the circuit 100 over the conventional approach described in FIG. 1 is that 60 mV of bitline delta is no longer required to overcome a threshold voltage mismatch.
      <br/>
      While the bitline delta has been described generally as 60 mV, other bitline delta ranges, such as 70 mV-90 mV, 60 mV-100 mV, 40 mV-120 mV, 30 mV-150 mV, etc., may be implemented accordingly to meet the design criteria of a particular implementation.
      <br/>
      In any event, the circuit 100 generally allows for a lower bitline delta than the conventional approach described in FIG. 1.
      <br/>
      A lower bitline delta may improve speed (e.g., MHz, tcyc, tco, etc.) and current consumption (e.g., tids) for synchronous parts by reducing the wordline "on" time (e.g., the signal "STROBE" may be applied earlier than in the case of uncompensated amplifier which may increase the access speed).
      <br/>
      The circuit 100 may provide faster sensing and may be suitable for SRAM sensing.
    </p>
    <p num="16">
      The transistors may be implemented, in one example, as NMOS/PMOS devices, CMOS devices, BJT devices or other appropriate devices necessary to meet the design criteria of a particular implementation.
      <br/>
      The devices 110 and 112 may be implemented, in one example, as n-channel devices.
      <br/>
      The devices 122 and 124 may be optional load devices for the cross-coupled devices 110 and 112 and may restore CMOS full-rail output levels, if needed to meet the design criteria of a particular implementation.
    </p>
    <p num="17">
      The circuit 100 may implement SRAM compatibility with latch style operation and p-channel devices to restore (MOS) levels in the latch.
      <br/>
      The circuit 100 may be useful to increase speed (e.g., MHz) for future fast SRAMs, especially as parts continue to shrink and threshold voltage Vt mismatch becomes worse.
      <br/>
      The circuit 100 may implement a threshold voltage Vt mismatch compensated latched sense amplifier scheme where the compensation for threshold voltage Vt bias is generally applied to the sources of the n-channel cross-coupled devices.

    <p num="18">
      Referring to FIG. 3, a timing diagram of the operation of the circuit 100 is shown.
      <br/>
      The signal L1 generally has a positive transition 200 and a negative transition 202.
      <br/>
      The signal L2 generally has a positive transition 204 and a negative transition 206.
      <br/>
      The signal STROBE generally has a positive transition 208 and a negative transition 210.
      <br/>
      The signal BL generally has a negative transition 211 as the small read current from the memory cell develops a small voltage different between the signals BL and BLB according to, in one example, the following expression:  (Equation image '2' not included in text)
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      where i=icell, c=bitline capacitance, and dt=sense time.
      <br/>
      The signal BLB is shown without transitions.
      <br/>
      In general, the positive transition 212 of the signal BL generally responds to the positive transition of the signal STROBE.
      <br/>
      The negative transition 211 on the signal BL generally corresponds to the signal L1 and the memory cell wordline turning on.
      <br/>
      The signal L1, the signal L2 and the signal STROBE generally respond to a master clock (e.g., in the case of synchronous device) and respond to a derived clock pulse (e.g., ATD pulse) for asynchronous devices.
    </p>
    <p num="20">
      Referring to FIG. 4, an example of the present invention implemented in the context of an SRAM is shown.
      <br/>
      The signal L1 and the signal L2 are generally timed from the master clock in a synchronous device.
      <br/>
      The relative timings of the signal L1 and the signal L2 are generally set by the designer.
      <br/>
      For an asynchronous part with ATD, the signal L1 and the signal L2 are generally derived from the ATD signal (e.g., the ATD signal responds to a transition detached on an address or control pin).
      <br/>
      Elements related to the SRAM circuit are shown external to the circuit 100.
