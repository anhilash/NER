    <p num="1">This application is the national phase of international application PCT/GB97/00365 filed Feb. 10,1997 which designated the U.S.</p>
    <p num="2">The present invention relates to quinazoline derivatives, processes for their preparation, pharmaceutical compositions containing them as active ingredient, methods for the treatment of disease states associated with angiogenesis and/or increased vascular permeability, to their use as medicaments and to their use in the manufacture of medicaments for use in the production of antiangiogenic and/or vascular permeability reducing effects in warm-blooded animals such as humans.</p>
    <p num="3">
      Normal angiogenesis plays an important role in a variety of processes including embryonic development, wound healing and several components of female reproductive function.
      <br/>
      Undesirable or pathological angiogenesis has been associated with disease states including diabetic retinopathy, psoriasis, cancer, rheumatoid arthritis, atheroma, Kaposi's sarcoma and haemangioma (Fan et al, 1995, Trends Pharmacol.
      <br/>
      Sci. 16: 57-66; Folkman, 1995, Nature Medicine 1: 27-31).
      <br/>
      Alteration of vascular permeability is thought to play a role in both normal and pathological physiological processes (Cullinan-Bove et al, 1993) Endocrinology 133: 829-837; Senger et al, 1993, Cancer and Metastasis Reviews. 12: 303-324).
      <br/>
      Several polypeptides with in vitro endothelial cell growth promoting activity have been identified including, acidic and basic fibroblast growth factors (aFGF &amp; bFGF) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF).
      <br/>
      By virtue of the restricted expression of its receptors, the growth factor activity of VEGF, in contrast to that of the FGFs, is relatively specific towards endothelial cells.
      <br/>
      Recent evidence indicates that VEGF is an important stimulator of both normal and pathological angiogenesis (Jakeman et al, 1993, Endocrinology, 133: 848-859; Kolch et al, 1995, Breast Cancer Research and Treatment, 36:139-155) and vascular permeability (Connolly et al, 1989, J. Biol. Chem. 264: 20017-20024).
      <br/>
      Antagonism of VEGF action by sequestration of VEGF with antibody can result in inhibition of tumour growth (Kim et al, 1993, Nature 362: 841-844).
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      Receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) are important in the transmission of biochemical signals across the plasma membrane of cells.
      <br/>
      These transmembrane molecules characteristically consist of an extracellular ligand-binding domain connected through a segment in the plasma membrane to an intracellular tyrosine kinase domain.
      <br/>
      Binding of ligand to the receptor results in stimulation of the receptor-associated tyrosine kinase activity which leads to phosphorylation of tyrosine residues on both the receptor and other intracellular molecules.
      <br/>
      These changes in tyrosine phosphorylation initiate a signalling cascade leading to a variety of cellular responses.
      <br/>
      To date, at least nineteen distinct RTK subfamilies, defined by amino acid sequence homology, have been identified.
      <br/>
      One of these subfamilies is presently comprised by the fms-like tyrosine kinase receptor, Flt or Flt1, the kinase insert domain-containing receptor, KDR (also referred to as Flk-1), and another fms-like tyrosine kinase receptor, Flt4.
      <br/>
      Two of these related RTKs, Flt and KDR, have been shown to bind VEGF with high affinity (De Vries et al, 1992, Science 255: 989-991; Terman et al, 1992, Biochem.
      <br/>
      Biophys. Res. Comm. 1992, 187: 1579-1586).
      <br/>
      Binding of VEGF to these receptors expressed in heterologous cells has been associated with changes in the tyrosine phosphorylation status of cellular proteins and calcium fluxes.

      Compounds which have good activity against epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor tyrosine kinase are disclosed in the European Patent Publication No 0566226, but there is no disclosure or suggestion that the compounds inhibit the effects of VEGF.
      <br/>
      European Patent Publication No. 0326330 discloses certain quinoline, quinazoline and cinnoline plant fungicides.
      <br/>
      Certain of these plant fungicides are also stated to possess insecticidal and miticidal activity.
      <br/>
      There is however no disclosure or any suggestion that any of the compounds disclosed may be used for any purpose in animals such as humans.
      <br/>
      In particular, the European Patent Publication contains no teaching whatsoever concerning angiogenesis and/or increased vascular permeability mediated by growth factors such as VEGF.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      The present invention is based on the discovery of compounds that surprisingly inhibit the effects of VEGF, a property of value in the treatment of disease states associated with angiogenesis and/or increased vascular permeability such as cancer, diabetes, psoriasis. rheumatoid arthritis, Kaposi's sarcoma, haemangioma, acute and chronic nephropathies, atheroma, arterial restenosis, autoimmune diseases, acute inflammation and ocular diseases with retinal vessel proliferation.
      <br/>
      Compounds of the present invention possess higher potency against VEGF receptor tyrosine kinase whilst possessing some activity against EGF receptor tyrosine kinase.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, compounds of the present invention, possess substantially higher potency against VEGF receptor tyrosine kinase than against EGF receptor tyrosine kinase or FGF R1 receptor tyrosine kinase.
      <br/>
      Thus compounds of the invention which have been tested possess activity against VEGF receptor tyrosine kinase such that they may be used in an amount sufficient to inhibit VEGF receptor tyrosine kinase whilst demonstrating no significant activity against EGF receptor tyrosine kinase or FGF R1 receptor tyrosine kinase.

      The identification of compounds which potently inhibit the tyrosine kinase activity associated with the VEGF receptors such as Fit and/or KDR and which inhibit angiogenesis and/or increased vascular permeability is desirable and is the subject of the present invention.
      <br/>
      These properties may be assessed, for example, using one or more of the procedures set out below:
    </p>
    <p num="120">(a) In Vitro Receptor Tyrosine Kinase Inhibition Test</p>
    <p num="121">
      This assay determines the ability of a test compound to inhibit tyrosine kinase activity.
      <br/>
      DNA encoding VEGF or epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor cytoplasmic domains may be obtained by total gene synthesis (Edwards M, International Biotechnology Lab 5(3), 19-25, 1987) or by cloning.
      <br/>
      These may then be expressed in a suitable expression system to obtain polypeptide with tyrosine kinase activity.
      <br/>
      For example VEGF and EGF receptor cytoplasmic domains, which were obtained by expression of recombinant protein in insect cells, were found to display intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity.
      <br/>
      In the case of the VEGF receptor Flt (Genbank accession number X51602), a 1.7 kb DNA fragment encoding most of the cytoplasmic domain, commencing with methionine 783 and including the termination codon, described by Shibuya et al (Oncogene, 1990, 5: 519-524), was isolated from cDNA and cloned into a baculovirus transplacement vector (for example pAcYM1 (see The Baculovirus Expression System: A Laboratory Guide, L. A. King and R. D. Possee, Chapman and Hall, 1992) or pAc360 or pBlueBacHis (available from Invitrogen Corporation)).
      <br/>
      This recombinant construct was co-transfected into insect cells (for example Spodoptera frugiperda 21(Sf21)) with viral DNA (eg Pharmingen BaculoGold) to prepare recombinant baculovirus. (Details of the methods for the assembly of recombinant DNA molecules and the preparation and use of recombinant baculovirus can be found in standard texts for example Sambrook et al, 1989, Molecular cloning--A Laboratory Manual, 2nd edition, Cold Spring Harbour Laboratory Press and O'Reilly et al, 1992, Baculovirus Expression Vectors--A Laboratory Manual, W.H. Freeman and Co, New York).
      <br/>
      For other tyrosine kinases for use in assays, cytoplasmic fragments starting from methionine 806 (KDR, Genbank accession number L04947) and methionine 668 (EGF receptor, Genbank accession number X00588) may be cloned and expressed in a similar manner.

      This test measures the capacity of compounds to reduce the acute increase in uterine weight in rats which occurs in the first 4-6 hours following oestrogen stimulation.

      <br/>
      In medical oncology the other component(s) of such conjoint treatment in addition to the antiangiogenic and/or vascular permeability reducing treatment defined hereinbefore may be: surgery, radiotherapy or chemotherapy.
      <br/>
      Such chemotherapy may cover three main categories of therapeutic agent:
      <br/>
      (i) other antiangiogenic agents that work by different mechanisms from those defined hereinbefore (for example linomide, inhibitors of integrin  ALPHA v BETA 3 function, angiostatin, razoxin. thalidomide);
      <br/>
      (ii) cytostatic agents such as antioestrogens (for example tamoxifen, toremifene, raloxifene, droloxifene, iodoxyfene), progestogens (for example megestrol acetate), aromatase inhibitors (for example anastrozole, letrazole, vorazole, exemestane), antiprogestogens, antiandrogens (for example flutamide, nilutamide, bicalutamide, cyproterone acetate), LHRH agonists and antagonists (for example goserelin acetate, luprolide), inhibitors of testosterone 5 ALPHA -dihydroreductase (for example finasteride), anti-invasion agents (for example metalloproteinase inhibitors like marimastat and inhibitors of urokinase plasminogen activator receptor fluction) and inhibitors of growth factor function, (such growth factors include for example EGF, FGFs, platelet derived growth factor and hepatocyte growth factor such inhibitors include growth factor antibodies, growth factor receptor antibodies, tyrosine kinase inhibitors and serine/threonine kinase inhibitors); and
      <br/>
      (iii) antiproliferative/antineoplastic drugs and combinations thereof, as used in medical oncology, such as antimetabolites (for example antifolates like methotrexate, fluoropyrimidines like 5-fluorouracil, purine and adenosine analogues, cytosine arabinoside); antitumour antibiotics (for example anthracyclines like doxorubicin, daunomycin, epirubicin and idarubicin, mitomycin-C, dactinomycin, mithramycin); platinum derivatives (for example cisplatin, carboplatin); alkylating agents (for example nitrogen mustard, melphalan, chlorambucil, busulphan, cyclophosphamide, ifosfamide, nitrosoureas, thiotepa); antimitotic agents (for example vinca alkaloids like vincrisitine and taxoids like taxol, taxotere); topoisomerase inhibitors (for example epipodophyllotoxins like etoposide and teniposide, amsacrine, topotecan).
    </p>
    <p num="143">
      As stated above the compounds defined in the present invention are of interest for their antiangiogenic and/or vascular permeability reducing effects.
      <br/>
      Such compounds of the invention are expected to be useful in a wide range of disease states including cancer, diabetes, psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis, Kaposi's sarcoma, haemangioma, acute and chronic nephropathies, atheroma, arterial restenosis, autoimmune diseases, acute inflammation and ocular diseases with retinal vessel proliferation.
      <br/>
      In particular such compounds of the invention are expected to slow advantageously the growth of primary and recurrent solid tumours of, for example, the colon, breast, prostate, lungs and skin.
      <br/>
      More particularly such compounds of the invention are expected to inhibit the growth of those primary and recurrent solid tumours which are associated with VEGF, especially those tumours which are significantly dependent on VEGF for their growth and spread, including for example, certain tumours of the colon, breast, prostate, lung, vulva and skin.
    </p>
    <p num="144">In addition to their use in therapeutic medicine, the compounds of formula I and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts are also useful as pharmacological tools in the development and standardisation of in vitro and in vivo test systems for the evaluation of the effects of inhibitors of VEGF receptor tyrosine kinase activity in laboratory animals such as cats, dogs, rabbits, monkeys, rats and mice, as part of the search for new therapeutic agents.</p>
    <p num="145">It is to be understood that where the term "ether" is used anywhere in this specification it refers to diethyl ether.</p>
    <p num="146">
      The invention will now be illustrated in the following non-limiting Examples in which, unless otherwise stated:
      <br/>
      �(i) evaporations were carried out by rotary evaporation in vacuo and work-up procedures were carried out after removal of residual solids such as drying agents by filtration;
      <br/>
      (ii) operations were carried out at ambient temperature, that is in the range 18-25 (degree)  C. and under an atmosphere of an inert gas such as argon;
      <br/>
      (iii) column chromatography (by the flash procedure) and medium pressure liquid chromatography (MPLC) were performed on Merck Kieselgel silica (Art. 9385) or Merck Lichroprep RP-18 (Art. 9303) reversed-phase silica obtained from E. Merck, Darmstadt, Germany;
      <br/>
      (iv) yields are given for illustration only and are not necessarily the maximum attainable;
      <br/>
      (v) melting points are uncorrected and were determined using a Mettler SP62 automatic melting point apparatus, an oil-bath apparatus or a Koffler hot plate apparatus.
      <br/>
      (vi) the structures of the end-products of the formula I were confirmed by nuclear (generally proton) magnetic resonance (NMR) and mass spectral techniques; proton magnetic resonance chemical shift values were measured on the delta scale and peak multiplicities are shown as follows: s, singlet; d, doublet; t, triplet; m, multiplet; br, broad; q, quartet;
      <br/>
      (vii) intermediates were not generally fully characterised and purity was assessed by thin layer chromatography (TLC), high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), infra-red (IR) or NMR analysis;
