      Projection-microlithography masks and methods are disclosed for aligning a mask in a pattern-transfer apparatus and transferring a pattern image as defined by the mask onto a sensitive substrate using a charged-particle beam or other suitable microlithography energy source.
      <br/>
      A mask of the present invention can include a pattern defined on a plurality of thin mask reticles or films.
      <br/>
      The mask reticles are secured to a single retention member.
      <br/>
      The mask further includes fiducial marks defined on the retention member, and fine alignment marks defined on each of the mask reticles, to facilitate alignment of the mask and correction of pattern-image errors resulting from distortion or movement of the mask reticles prior to exposing the substrate to the pattern image.

    <heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="1">The invention pertains to charged particle-beam projection-microlithography masks and methods for transferring a pattern, as defined by the mask, onto a sensitized substrate.</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">
      In charged-particle-beam (CPB) projection microlithography as used in the fabrication of integrated circuits, a circuit pattern defined by a reticle or mask is irradiated with a charged-particle beam to transfer the pattern defined by the reticle or mask to a sensitized substrate (e.g., a semiconductor wafer).
      <br/>
      In recent years, CPB projection-microlithography apparatus ("pattern-transfer apparatus") have been developed that exhibit improved resolution of the transferred pattern and improved product throughput (i.e., the number of semiconductor wafers that can be exposed with a pattern per unit time).
      <br/>
      With certain conventional CPB pattern-transfer apparatus, one or more entire die patterns defined on a mask are transferred onto the wafer in a single exposure.
      <br/>
      A "die" is a pattern coextensive with the bounds of an integrated circuit or other device to be transferred onto the wafer (usually multiple dies are exposed at respective locations on the wafer).
    </p>
    <p num="3">
      It is difficult to produce a mask for a CPB pattern-transfer apparatus that transfers multiple dies or even an entire die in a single exposure while also providing the high resolution and circuit densities demanded in recent years.
      <br/>
      In addition, conventional CPB pattern-transfer apparatus that transfer multiple dies or an entire die pattern per exposure cannot satisfactorily control aberrations arising in the CPB optical system through which the charged-particle beam passes, especially over a large optical field covering one or more dies.
      <br/>
      To solve this problem, CPB pattern-transfer apparatus have been proposed in which a pattern to be transferred is divided into multiple field segments ("mask subfields") that are individually and separately exposed.
      <br/>
      Such a pattern is typically transferred using a "step-and-repeat" transfer scheme in which the individual mask subfields are sequentially transferred to corresponding "substrate subfields" on a wafer or other sensitized substrate.
      <br/>
      The substrate subfields are produced on the wafer surface in locations relative to each other such that the substrate subfields are "stitched" together in the correct order and alignment to reproduce the entire die pattern on the wafer surface (e.g., see U.S. Pat. No. 5,260,151).
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      A demagnifying ("reduction") pattern-transfer apparatus irradiates a charged-particle beam onto a portion of a mask defining a circuit pattern of an entire die.
      <br/>
      An image of the die pattern is then demagnified and formed on the wafer (e.g., see Japanese Laid Open Patent Document No. HEI5-160012).
      <br/>
      Because a die pattern image cannot be transferred to the wafer with sufficiently high resolution when irradiating the entire die pattern in a single exposure, a step-and-repeat transfer scheme is used to transfer the die pattern to the wafer subfield-by-subfield.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      A mask for use with a "partial-batch" pattern-transfer method defines a repeating pattern portion of an integrated circuit, such as a DRAM, and non-repeating patterns.
      <br/>
      The mask is irradiated and the pattern portion to be repeatedly transferred to the wafer is reduced and transferred thereto the desired number of times.
      <br/>
      The non-repeating pattern portions of the mask undergo direct writing to the wafer (i.e., the patterns are not reduced), typically using a conventional variable-shaped-beam method.
      <br/>
      The partial-batch pattern transfer method improves wafer throughput in comparison to a variable-shaped-beam method.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      By providing a mask defining the circuit pattern of an entire integrated-circuit chip and forming a reduced pattern image of the integrated circuit pattern on a sensitive substrate, it is possible to eliminate all need for direct writing of non-repeating pattern portions of a mask.
      <br/>
      By eliminating direct writing, wafer throughput is increased.
      <br/>
      However, to provide reduction transfer of all of the die patterns on a mask at a demagnification ratio of 1/20 to 1/50 and ensure the required pattern resolution, the dimensions of the mask pattern must be 20 to 50 times, respectively, the size of the complete wafer integrated-circuit pattern.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, currently, pattern-transfer demagnification ratios are only in the order of 1/2 to 1/4, to avoid having to use a mask having an unreasonable size.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      Additionally, masks used for such reduction pattern-transfer methods typically are made by using a self-supporting, thin film of silicon, having a thickness of about 1  MU m to about 30  MU m. As masks used for reduction-pattern transfer necessarily increase in size, it is exceedingly difficult to form a self-supporting thin film to form the mask.
      <br/>
      Additionally, as the mask increases in size, deformations of such thin-film masks increase, making it difficult to ensure accuracy and precision in the formation of mask pattern images on a wafer.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      Moreover, semiconductor wafers for producing a mask of the size required for a higher demagnification ratio are not presently available.
      <br/>
      For example, for a 15 mm * 30 mm integrated circuit having a demagnification ratio of about 1/8, the size of the mask pattern region must be 120 mm * 240 mm.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, the diagonal dimensions of the resulting mask would be approximately 268 mm.
      <br/>
      To produce a mask of such dimensions, a semiconductor wafer having a diameter of about 300 mm would be required; such semiconductor wafers currently are not available commercially.
    </p>
    <p num="9">Further, if a mask is comprised of a self-supporting thin film of silicon rather than comprising a patterned thin film of chrome on a quartz substrate (as is typically used in optical lithographic processes), positional distortion of the mask typically occurs.</p>
    <p num="10">
      The present invention makes it possible to produce a mask having a sufficiently large surface area for reduction-pattern transfer without the need for direct writing, while controlling cost increases in mask production and providing relatively high wafer throughput.
      <br/>
      In addition to providing the masks of the present invention, the present invention further provides mask-alignment and pattern-transfer methods that substantially eliminate degradation in mask pattern-transfer accuracy typically associated with use of relatively large masks.
    </p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="11">
      In light of the foregoing deficiencies in the prior art, the present invention provides projection-microlithography masks and methods for aligning a mask in a pattern-transfer apparatus and transferring a pattern image, as defined by the mask, onto a sensitized substrate using a charged-particle beam or other suitable microlithography energy source.
      <br/>
      The pattern-transfer masks and methods of the present invention provide masks for reduction-pattern transfer at relatively high demagnification ratios, provide methods for mask alignment, and provide transfer of corrected mask-pattern images onto a substrate with high accuracy and throughput.
    </p>
    <p num="12">
      An embodiment of a mask according to the present invention comprises a pattern defined on a plurality of thin mask reticles.
      <br/>
      The plurality of mask reticles are secured to a single mask-reticle-retention member.
      <br/>
      The mask-reticle patterns are divided into multiple mask subfields.
      <br/>
      Each mask subfield comprises a respective portion of the overall pattern to be transferred from the mask to the substrate.
      <br/>
      The mask further comprises initial alignment marks or fiducial marks formed on the retention member and fine alignment marks formed on each of the mask reticles.
      <br/>
      The alignment marks facilitate alignment of the mask and correction of pattern-image errors resulting from mechanically or thermally induced distortion of the mask reticles.
      <br/>
      Such alignment/correction is performed prior to exposing a sensitive substrate to the mask-reticle patterns.
    </p>
    <p num="13">
      In an embodiment of the alignment method of the present invention, before the mask is mounted in a pattern-transfer apparatus, the positional relationships between each of the mask reticles and the retention member are determined and stored in a memory device.
      <br/>
      The mask is then mounted in the pattern-transfer device, preferably on a mask stage.
      <br/>
      The positions of the fiducial marks on the retention member are detected and data indicative of the positional coordinates of the retention member fiducial marks are stored in the memory device.
      <br/>
      The positional coordinates of the reference mark on the sensitive substrate stage are then detected and the data indicative of the substrate stage positional coordinates (hence, the substrate position) are stored in the memory device.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, rather than detecting the reference mark on the substrate stage, the charged-particle beam is irradiated on each of the fine alignment marks on the mask to form images of the alignment marks on the sensitive substrate.
      <br/>
      The positions of the alignment-mark images on the sensitive substrate are then detected, and data indicative of such positional coordinates of the sensitive substrate are stored in the memory device.
      <br/>
      From such stored data, the positional relationship between the retention member and the substrate is determined.
    </p>
    <p num="14">
      Based on the positional relationships between the retention member and the individual mask reticles and on the positional relationship between the retention member and the sensitive substrate, positional relationships between each of the mask reticles and the sensitive substrate are determined.
      <br/>
      Thereafter, deflection of the charged-particle beam and movement of the mask and substrate stages are made for each of the mask reticles based on such positional relationships and exposure of the sensitive substrate to each of the mask-reticle patterns, on a subfield-by-subfield basis, is then performed.
    </p>
    <p num="15">
      The foregoing and other objects, features, and advantages of the invention will become more apparent from the following detailed description of preferred embodiments which proceeds with reference to the accompanying drawings.

    <p num="16">DETAILED DESCRIPTION 0F THE INVENTION</p>
    <p num="17">
      Referring to FIG. 1(c), a first embodiment of the mask 1 according to the present invention comprises two or more divided mask reticles 11a, 11b ("mask reticles") mounted on a reticle-retention member 12 ("retention member").
      <br/>
      The mask reticles 11a, 11b selectively transmit, absorb, and/or scatter charged particles irradiated thereon, depending upon the mask-reticle material.
      <br/>
      The mask 1 further comprises initial alignment marks (or "fiducial marks") M3 formed on the retention member 12 and fine alignment marks M1, M2 formed on the mask reticles 11a, 11b.
      <br/>
      The alignment marks may be formed using a variety of techniques as known to those persons skilled in the art (e.g., heavy-metal deposition, etching, etc.).
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      Referring to FIG. 1(b), mask reticles 11a, 11b define respective integrated circuit patterns that are to be transferred to a sensitive substrate, such as a semiconductor wafer.
      <br/>
      Mask reticles 11a, 11b are formed from separate mask substrates S1, S2.
      <br/>
      Mask substrates S1, S2 comprise conventional mask-substrate materials, such as semiconductor wafers, amorphous materials, or metals.
      <br/>
      Mask reticles 11a, 11b are preferably comprised of silicon thin films each having a thickness of about 1  MU m to about 30  MU m. The mask reticles 11a, 11b are formed on substrate regions C1, C2 of the mask substrates S1, S2, respectively.
      <br/>
      The substrate regions C1, C2, and, hence, the mask reticles 11a, 11b, include respective mask-pattern regions P1, P2 and non-pattern regions or border regions E1, E2, respectively, located along the periphery of the pattern regions P1, P2.
      <br/>
      Border regions E1, E2 do not define any portion of the patterns of the respective mask reticles 11a, 11b.
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      Both mask reticles 11a, 11b are preferably secured to a single retention member 12 (FIG. 1(c)).
      <br/>
      The retention member 12 is preferably formed of a sufficiently rigid material, such as silicon or ceramic.
      <br/>
      The retention member 12 material is chosen to have sufficient strength such that mechanical or thermal effects do not result in significant deformations of the retention member as the mask is loaded into and/or used in a pattern-transfer apparatus.
      <br/>
      The retention member 12 includes retention-member apertures 12a, 12b, upon which retention-member apertures the pattern regions P1, P2 of the mask reticles 11a, 11b, respectively, are coextensive.
      <br/>
      The border regions E1, E2 of the mask reticles 11a, 11b, are mounted on or secured to the retention member 12 to be coextensive with the portion of the retention member 12 bordering the periphery of the apertures 12a, 12b.
      <br/>
      The resulting mask 1, comprising two or more mask reticles 11a, 11b, may then be handled as a single mask in the same manner as a conventional microlithography mask.
    </p>
    <p num="20">
      Mask reticles of the masks of the present invention (e.g., mask reticles 11a, 11b) may be mounted on or secured to a retention member by means of adhesion, electrostatic attraction, or a mechanical securing mechanism.
      <br/>
      For example, referring to FIG. 5, mask reticles 11a, 11b are secured to a mask-retention member 82 by means of electrostatic force generated when a suitable voltage is applied to electrodes, such as electrodes 83a to 83h, on the retention member 82.
    </p>
    <p num="21">
      FIG. 6 illustrates one of a variety of manners that the mask reticles of the present invention, such as mask reticles 11a, 11b, may be mechanically secured to a retention member.
      <br/>
      Mask reticles 11a, 11b are secured to a retention member 92 by means of gripping the mask reticles 11a, 11b between the retention member 92 and a pressure plate 93.
      <br/>
      The pressure plate 93 is secured to the retention member 92 using fasteners, such as screws 94.
      <br/>
      Apertures 92a, 92b, 93a, and 93b are defined by the retention member 92 to accommodate the pattern regions of the mask reticles 11a, 11b.
    </p>
    <p num="22">
      If a demagnification ratio of about 1/8 is desired using substrates C1, C2 individually having dimensions of about 120 mm * 120 mm and diagonal dimensions of each substrate region of about 170 mm, then the mask reticles 11a, 11b may be produced from conventional wafers having diameters of about 200 mm.
      <br/>
      A 200-mm wafer may be used for forming a mask that will undergo such a demagnification, even when border regions E1, E2 of the mask reticles are included.
      <br/>
      As discussed above, prior to the present invention, a wafer having a diameter of about 300 mm was necessary to produce a similar mask for use in a pattern-transfer apparatus employing a similar demagnification ratio.
      <br/>
      Moreover, at such demagnification ratios, when using a substrate with a size identical to a conventional substrate, the substrate can accommodate a chip larger than conventionally possible.
    </p>
    <p num="23">
      FIG. 1(a) illustrates portions of a sensitive substrate on which images of a mask pattern are to be formed.
      <br/>
      Referring to FIG. 1(a) and FIG. 3, a single exposure unit D on the sensitive substrate 38 is equivalent to, for example, one die or integrated-circuit chip.
      <br/>
      For ease of description, assume that the dimensions of one exposure unit D on the silicon wafer or sensitive substrate 38 are about 15 mm * 30 mm and the demagnification ratio of the exposure is to be about 1/8.
      <br/>
      Assume further that a reduction step-and-repeat transfer scheme is followed wherein, for each step, the pattern within an exposure unit D is formed on the sensitive substrate.
      <br/>
      By forming pattern images on each exposure unit D, of multiple integrated circuits are formed on the sensitive substrate 38.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, each exposure unit D may be further divided into smaller units, such as two exposure units d1, d2 (each exposure unit d1, d2 being about 15 mm * 15 mm in area) (FIG. 1(a)).
      <br/>
      Smaller exposure units typically provide higher pattern resolution.
    </p>
    <p num="24">For convenience in describing the transfer of patterns from the mask reticles 11a, 11b to the sensitive substrate 38, orthogonal coordinate axes are used as shown in FIG. 3 such that a Z-axis is parallel to an optical axis of a charged-particle beam 31, and an X-axis and a Y-axis are parallel to the mask 1 and sensitive substrate 38 surfaces.</p>
    <p num="25">
      Exposure of the sensitive substrate 38 to the patterns of mask reticles 11a, 11b is described with reference to FIGS. 2-4. As shown in FIGS. 3 and 4(a), the exposure unit D on the sensitive substrate 38 (preferably the pattern of one entire die) is divided into a plurality of primary regions, such as primary regions f1, f2 shown in FIG. 3.
      <br/>
      Each primary region f1, f2 is further divided into a plurality of substrate subfields g1(1,1)-g1(m,n), g2(1,1)-g2(m,n).
      <br/>
      The substrate subfields g1(1,1)-g1(m,n), g2(1,1)-g2(m,n) are positioned adjacent to one another in a grid pattern.
    </p>
    <p num="26">
      Referring to FIG. 3, the patterns defined by the mask reticles include primary regions (or "continuous-exposure regions") F1, F2.
      <br/>
      Each primary region F1, F2 is further divided into a plurality of mask subfields G1(1,1)-G1(m,n), G2(1,1)-G2(m,n) respectively, that correspond to the primary regions and substrate subfields of the sensitive substrate 38, respectively.
      <br/>
      The mask subfields G1(1,1)-G1(m,n), G2(1,1)-G2(m,n) may be separated from one another by a non-pattern region H. The non-pattern region H preferably includes a thin-film reinforcement member (not shown) to augment the strength of the mask.
      <br/>
      During exposure of the sensitive substrate 38 to the mask 1 patterns, the pattern of a single subfield (e.g., G1(m,n)) of a mask reticle is transferred to the corresponding substrate subfield (i.e., g1(m,n)) on the sensitive substrate 38.
      <br/>
      More particularly, during exposure of the sensitive substrate 38, the mask 1 and the sensitive substrate are moved in a pattern-transfer apparatus (e.g., the first embodiment of the pattern-transfer apparatus shown in FIG. 2) in directions opposite to one another.
      <br/>
      As shown in FIG. 3, while mask 1 is continuously moved in the -Y-axis direction Vm, the sensitive substrate 38 is continuously moved in the +Y-axis direction Vw.
      <br/>
      A charged-particle beam 31, incident to the mask 1, scans the mask parallel to the X-axis in scan directions R1 and then R2.
      <br/>
      The charged-particle beam is scanned in the +X-axis to irradiate the patterns of all of the mask subfields G1(1,1)-G1(1,n) of row Al and transfer the patterns of the subfields one-by-one onto the corresponding substrate subfields g1(1,1)-g1(1,n).
      <br/>
      Following completion of exposure of all of the mask subfields in row A1, the charged-particle beam 31 is scanned in the opposite direction, the -X-axis direction.
      <br/>
      The mask subfields G1(2,1)-G1(2,n) in row A2 are then irradiated and transferred onto the corresponding substrate subfields g1(2,n)-g1(2,1) until all of the subfield patterns of primary region F1 are transferred.
      <br/>
      That is, as the mask 1 and the sensitive substrate 38 are continuously moved as discussed above, the exposure process is repeated for each row of the mask subfields, i.e., through row Am.
    </p>
    <p num="27">
      Following completion of the irradiation of the patterns of primary region F1, the mask 1 is incrementally moved in the -X-axis direction an amount equal to the X-axis direction pitch of the mask primary regions F1, F2.
      <br/>
      At the same time, the sensitive substrate 38 is incrementally moved in the +X-axis direction an amount equal to the X-axis direction pitch of the substrate primary regions f1, f2.
      <br/>
      Thereafter, while the mask 1 is continuously moved in the +Y-axis direction and the sensitive substrate 38 is continuously moved in the -Y-axis direction, the patterns of the mask subfields G2(1,1)-G2(m,n) in mask primary region F2 are irradiated with the charged-particle beam 31.
      <br/>
      Images of the patterns of the mask subfields G2(1,1)-G2(m,n) are formed on the corresponding substrate subfields g2(1,1)-g2(m,n).

      In this way, a single exposure unit D, preferably the pattern of an entire die, is formed on the sensitive substrate 38.

      That is, the positional coordinates of mask-reticle fine alignment marks M1, M2 in relation to the fiducial marks M3 on the retention member 12 (i.e., "design" positions) are determined and stored in the memory device 50, prior to mounting the mask in the pattern-transfer apparatus.

      Thereafter, the charged-particle beam 31 is detected by the first and second deflectors and the mask and substrate stages are moved based on such positional relationships for each mask reticle and exposure of the mask-reticle patterns on a subfield-by-subfield basis.

      The positional relationship between the mask reticles 11a, 11b and the sensitive substrate 38 is calculated by the master controller 36 based on a comparison of the "design" position data and the "actual" position data of the mask reticles 11a, 11b and the retention member 12, and the actual positions of the sensitive substrate 38.

      A third embodiment of the mask-alignment/mask-pattern transfer method of the present invention is illustrated in the flow chart of FIG. 9.

      Referring to FIGS. 7 and 9, a mask 51 is mounted on a mask stage of a pattern-transfer apparatus, such as the pattern-transfer apparatus illustrated in FIG. 8 (step S101).

      Using one of the detection systems mentioned above, the positional coordinates of the alignment marks of the mask-retention member and of the mask reticles are determined.
      <br/>
      Specifically, the position of the mask-retention member 53 (FIG. 7) is determined by detecting the positional coordinates of the fiducial marks 57-1, 57-2 (step S102).
      <br/>
      Initial alignment of the mask and substrate is performed based on the positional coordinates of the retention-member-alignment marks.

      Next, the position of the first mask reticle 55-1 is determined by detecting the positional coordinates of the fine alignment marks 59-11, 59-12 on the mask reticle 55-1 (step S103).
      <br/>
      This sequence is repeated for each of the mask reticles 55-2 to 55-4 to determine the positional coordinates of each of the fine alignment marks of each of the mask reticles (steps S104, S105, S106).
      <br/>
      A calculation method, such as the least-squares method, is used to determine the appropriate correction amounts.

      An initial alignment of the mask and substrate is made based on the detected position of the retention-member-alignment marks.

      The measurement sequence is the same as described above in relation to the third embodiment of the method.

      Accordingly, the fourth embodiment of the method of the present invention requires a number of shifts between alignment of the mask and exposure of the substrate to the mask-reticle patterns.

      To illustrate application of the method of the present invention to masks other than those masks of the present invention, a typical or conventional mask having a reticle is illustrated in FIG. 11. The mask 261 comprises a pattern divided into a plurality of mask subfields 263 positioned adjacent one another in a grid pattern.

      The mask subfield 263 is irradiated with a charged-particle beam or other suitable energy source so that a resulting image is reduced and formed on the sensitive substrate.

      To illustrate application of the methods of the present invention to masks having two or more reticles, a mask 271 as shown in FIG. 12 is described herein.
      <br/>
      The mask 271 comprises a pattern divided into at least two mask reticles 275-1, 275-2 positioned adjacent one another and mounted on a retention member 273.
      <br/>
      The retention member 273 and mask reticles 275-1, 275-2, are preferably comprised of the respective materials discussed above in relation to the first embodiment of the mask of the present invention.
      <br/>
      The mask reticles define a pattern divided into a plurality of subfields (as with mask 261 shown in FIG. 11) positioned adjacent one another in a grid pattern.
      <br/>
      At least eight alignment marks 277 are formed on each of the mask reticles 275-1, 275-2.
    </p>
    <p num="79">
      The method of the present invention is also applicable to the mask embodiment shown in FIG. 13. A mask 281 comprises a pattern divided into at least three mask reticles 285-1, 285-2, 285-3 positioned adjacent one another and mounted on a retention member 283.
      <br/>
      The retention member 283 and mask reticles 285-1, 285-2, 285-3 may comprise the respective materials discussed above in relation to the first embodiment of the mask of the present invention.
      <br/>
      Each of the mask reticles 285-1, 285-2, 285-3 further comprises respective patterns divided into a plurality of subfields.
      <br/>
      The subfields are positioned adjacent one another in a grid pattern (as with mask 261 shown in FIG. 11).
      <br/>
      At least eight alignment marks 287 are formed on each of the mask reticles of the mask 281.
    </p>
    <p num="80">
      By determining the positions of the mask-alignment marks and making appropriate corrections during transfer of the subfield patterns to the sensitive substrate, mechanically or thermally induced distortion errors of each mask reticle are corrected, providing a superior accuracy of pattern transfer.
      <br/>
      Further, because the correctable range is wider, the accuracy required for the mask is less.
      <br/>
      For example, if the mask reticles are not formed on or adhered accurately to the retention member (e.g., there is positional error in reticle placement) the methods of the present invention can correct such errors before the pattern image is formed on the wafer.
    </p>
    <p num="81">
      The path of the arrow Mv in FIG. 13 illustrates the preferred path of mask-stage movement during the positional coordinate measurement of the mask 281.
      <br/>
      With such movement of the mask stage during pattern transfer of pattern images to a sensitive substrate, the mask positional coordinate measurement may be performed while the mask-pattern transfer takes place.
      <br/>
      That is, the positional coordinate measurement may be made, and then the transfer of each subfield performed while correcting for positional error as determined based upon the positional coordinate measurement.
      <br/>
      The mask may be moved along the path Mv while continuing to make such error measurements, to make corrections based on such measurements, and to perform the pattern-image transfer for the selected subfield.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, positional coordinate measurement results are obtained that reflect the necessary mask-stage movement and charged-particle-beam deflection needed to provide accurate transfer of mask patterns.
    </p>
    <p num="82">
      By performing mask alignment for each mask reticle of the masks of the present invention, the position accuracy of the pattern transfer remains constant or improves even when the mask is divided into a plurality of subfields.
      <br/>
      Moreover, because the portion of the mask reticle in which mask alignment is performed is smaller than the entire mask-reticle surface or the entire mask surface, the requirement of absolute positional accuracy of each pattern as formed on the mask is not nearly as strict as with conventional masks and methods.
    </p>
    <p num="83">
      Because the masks of the present invention are comprised of a plurality of mask reticles on a single retention member, it is possible to produce a mask having a larger pattern surface area using semiconductor wafers of conventional, available size.
      <br/>
      Further, the wafer from which mask reticles are formed may be minimally supported, while still providing the advantages of a thin-film mask.
      <br/>
      In addition, reductions in mask-pattern image precision, and increases in the cost of mask production are limited.
      <br/>
      Further, if an irreparable pattern defect occurs, the single defective mask reticle may be replaced, avoiding the cost of replacing an entire mask, as is required with conventional masks.
    </p>
    <p num="84">
      When using a scanning pattern-transfer apparatus, even though the mask reticle is divided into multiple mask subfields, by forming a continuous exposure region of the subfields, each region can be continuously scanned.
      <br/>
      The scan of the divided mask pattern is still performed on a subfield-by-subfield basis, but the motion between the subfields is continuous rather than being a start-and-stop motion.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, the wafer throughput is relatively high.
    </p>
    <p num="85">
      In addition, because the mask reticles of the masks of the present invention are not individually mounted on the mask stage of a pattern-transfer apparatus, but instead are mounted to a single retention member, the positions of the mask reticles are less likely to change significantly as the mask is loaded and/or used in a pattern-transfer apparatus.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, the time period necessary for alignment of the individual mask reticles is relatively short when compared to multiple, relatively small masks.
    </p>
    <p num="86">
      Having illustrated and demonstrated the principles of the invention in multiple example embodiments, it should be apparent to those skilled in the art that the preferred embodiment can be modified in arrangement and detail without departing from such principles.
      <br/>
      We claim as the invention all that comes within the scope of these claims.
