      <br/>
      Field of the Invention
    </p>
    <p num="3">The present invention relates to a diamond-metal junction product in which a diamond semiconductor and a metal are integrated through an ohmic junction.</p>
    <p num="4">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
    <p num="5">
      In general, diamond has a large band gap of about 5.5 eV and a large carrier mobility (1800 cm2 /V * S for electrons and 1600 cm2 /V * S for holes), as well as a large thermal conductivity of about 20 W/cm * k. In addition, diamond exhibits a very high level of hardness and, hence, superior wear resistance.
      <br/>
      Thus, diamond possesses various advantageous properties which can never be offered by other materials.
    </p>
    <p num="6">In recent years, remarkable progress has been achieved in the technique for synthesizing diamond from gaseous phases, and it is now possible to form a diamond film by chemical vapor deposition (CVD).</p>
    <p num="7">
      Studies also have been made to develop a technique for producing semiconductors by doping diamond crystals with impurities.
      <br/>
      Shiomi et al. reported that a field effect transistor can be produced by forming, on an artificial diamond substrate, a diamond film containing boron as an impurity by a vapor synthesis technique and then forming Schottky junction metal and ohmic junction metal.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      Hitherto, however, it has been difficult to form metal electrodes on diamond crystal by diamond-metal junction with a high degree of reproducibility of the characteristics of the product.
      <br/>
      Namely, characteristics of a diamond-metal junction material largely vary according to factors such as the conditions for forming the diamond, the conditions of processing after formation of the diamond and the methods of forming the electrodes.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      For instance, whether the type of junction formed is an ohmic junction or a Schottky junction depends on whether a methane-hydrogen type gas or a carbon monoxide-hydrogen type gas is used as the material gas in forming the diamond.
      <br/>
      It is also known that a metal junction which has exhibited an ohmic nature is changed into a metal junction exhibiting a Schottky nature when diamond crystal is scrubbed with a chromic acid mixed solution.
      <br/>
      Characteristics also vary largely depending on whether the metal electrode is formed to make a point conduct or evaporation-deposited on the diamond layer.
    </p>
    <p num="10">Thus, it has been difficult to obtain a product having metal electrodes by a diamond-metal junction with a high degree of reproducibility.</p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="11">Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide a diamond-metal junction product which exhibits excellent ohmic characteristics.</p>
    <p num="12">A second object of the present invention is to provide ohmic junction electrodes which can be formed with high degree of reproducibility.</p>
    <p num="13">A third object of the present invention is to provide a diamond-metal junction product in which an ohmic junction is formed between a semiconductor diamond layer and a metal layer through the intermediary of a graphite layer having a thickness of at least 12  Angstrom .</p>
    <p num="14">A fourth object of the present invention is to provide a diamond product comprising a stabilized outer surface of graphite formed on a diamond layer, wherein said outer surface of graphite has a thickness of at least 12  Angstrom .</p>
    <p num="15">A fifth object of the present invention is to provide a diamond product comprising a semiconductor diamond layer having an outer surface region of graphite in contact with a metal electrode to form an ohmic junction with the electrode, wherein the outer surface region has a thickness of at least about 12  Angstrom .</p>

    <heading>DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
    <p num="17">In a preferred form of the diamond-metal junction product of the present invention, an ohmic junction is formed between a semiconductor diamond layer and a metal layer through the intermediary of a graphite layer having a thickness of at least about 12  Angstrom .</p>
    <p num="18">According to the invention, it is possible to obtain a diamond-metal junction product which exhibits excellent ohmic characteristics.</p>
    <p num="19">According to the invention, it is also possible to form, with a high degree of reproducibility, metal electrodes on a semiconductor diamond layer, by forming a graphite layer having a thickness of at least about 12  Angstrom  on the semiconductor diamond layer, before forming the metal electrodes.</p>
    <p num="20">
      Through an intense study, the present inventors have found that the metal junction characteristics are largely governed by the state of the surface of the diamond layer, e.g., the molecular nucleus adsorbed on the diamond surface.
      <br/>
      The inventors have found that the production of a diamond-metal junction product is best achieved with the stabilization of the state of the diamond surface.
      <br/>
      With this knowledge, the inventors have conducted experiments to discover conditions for stabilizing the diamond surface and found that superior ohmic junction characteristics can be obtained with a high degree of reproducibility when a graphite region is formed on the surface of the diamond layer.
    </p>
    <p num="21">
      By forming a graphite layer of about 12  Angstrom  or thicker, it is possible to reduce the influence of nucleus adsorbed on the diamond surface, thus stabilizing the state of the diamond layer surface.
      <br/>
      The reason why such stabilization is attained has not yet been theoretically determined.
      <br/>
      It is, however, considered that this advantageous effect owes to the fact that the graphite layer having metallic characteristics can be directly formed on the diamond layer surface without any intermediary because both graphite and diamond contain carbon atoms.
      <br/>
      Amorphous carbon which has comparatively high resistivity is not suitable for use as the junction layer in the diamond-metal junction product of the present invention, and graphite layer having low resistivity is preferably used as the junction layer.
      <br/>
      Discrimination between diamond crystals, graphite crystals and amorphous carbon is possible by various methods such as observation of lattice image through an electron microscope or electron bean diffraction.
      <br/>
      It is also possible to discriminate by spectral analysis of valence band such as by using XPS (X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy) or ELS (energy loss spectroscopy).
    </p>
    <p num="22">
      The thickness of the graphite layer is about 12  Angstrom  or greater, preferably about 15 to 500  Angstrom , and more preferably about 20 to 100  Angstrom .
      <br/>
      It is not always necessary that the graphite layer is formed uniformly over the entire area of the diamond layer.
      <br/>
      When the thickness of the graphite layer varies according to position, it is preferred that the mean thickness falls within the range stated above.
      <br/>
      Thus, the graphite layer may be formed only on an area where a metal electrode is to be formed.
      <br/>
      The above-described effect of graphite layer for stabilizing the state of the diamond layer surface is not appreciable when the thickness of the graphite layer is about 10  Angstrom  or less, and is saturated when the graphite layer thickness is increased beyond 500  Angstrom .
    </p>
    <p num="23">
      There is no restriction in regard to the method of forming the graphite layer.
      <br/>
      For instance, the graphite layer can be formed by annealing the diamond layer in an inert gas atmosphere at a temperature not lower than 800 (degree)  C., preferably not lower than 1000 (degree)  C., so as to graphitize the diamond layer surface.
      <br/>
      It is also possible to form the graphite layer by increasing the concentration carbon source and substrate temperature in the final stage of synthesis of the diamond.
      <br/>
      When the graphite layer is formed by elevating the carbon source concentration and substrate temperature in the final stage of the diamond synthesis, the elevated carbon source concentration is, for example, 1.2% or higher in terms of carbon-containing gas, e.g., methane, and the elevated substrate temperature is, for example, 1000 (degree)  C. or higher.
    </p>
    <p num="24">
      The graphite layer is a region of graphite forming the outer surface of the diamond layer.
      <br/>
      The graphite layer can be a region of graphite as formed above.
      <br/>
      Further, a discrete graphite layer can be formed by conventional methods on the diamond layer such as by chemically vapor depositing a graphite layer onto the diamond layer or by bonding or laminating a graphite layer to the diamond layer to form a graphite surface on the diamond layer.
    </p>
    <p num="25">
      In this specification, the term "metal" is used to generally cover metals and alloys usable as the material of the ohmic electrode, unless otherwise specified.
      <br/>
      More specifically, such metal includes Pt, Au, Ag, Cu, Ti, Zr, Hf, V, Nb, Cr, Mo, Mn, W, Sn, Zn, Ta, Al, Si, Fe, Co, Ni and other metals, alloys of such metals, as well as carbides, sulfides and borides thereof.
    </p>
    <p num="26">The electrode may be formed by a known technique such as vacuum evaporation, sputtering and so forth.</p>

      FIG. 1A shows a diamond layer 12 having an outer surface region or layer of graphite 16.
      <br/>
      FIG. 1B shows the diamond layer 12 having an outer surface region or layer of graphite 16 in contact with a metal electrode 14.
      <br/>

    <p num="28">
      The vapor phase synthesis of diamond is conducted preferably but not exclusively by CVD (chemical vapor deposition).
      <br/>
      FIG. 2 shows a CVD apparatus suitably employed in the production of diamond.
      <br/>
      The apparatus has a quartz reaction tube 1, a heater 2 and a tungsten filament 3.
      <br/>
      Numeral 4 designates a silicon substrate.
      <br/>
      The quartz reaction tube 1 has a gas inlet port 5 and a discharge port 6 which is connected to an evacuating device and a pressure regulating valve which are not shown.
      <br/>
      The material gas for forming diamond crystal may be a hydrocarbon gas such as methane or ethane or a gas obtained by heating a liquid organic compound such as alcohol and acetone.
      <br/>
      The material gas, when introduced into the reaction tube, may be diluted by hydrogen or oxygen as required.
      <br/>
      In order to form a semiconductor diamond, a compound containing boron, phosphor, nitrogen or lithium is added to the material gas.
      <br/>
      The material gas containing such compound is decomposed by the heat from the filament 3 which is heated to about 2000 (degree)  C., so that diamond crystals are formed on the substrate.
      <br/>
      The described method of forming diamond, however, is not exclusive and various other methods can be employed such as microwave plasma CVD, radio-frequency plasma CVD, D.C. plasma CVD, field microwave plasma CVD and burning flame method.

    <heading>EXAMPLES</heading>
    <p num="29">Examples of production of diamond-metal junction product of the present invention are shown below.</p>
    <p num="30">Example 1</p>
    <p num="31">A semiconductor diamond was formed by using the apparatus shown in FIG. 2.</p>
    <p num="32">
      A single-crystal silicon substrate was placed as the substrate 4 within the quartz reaction tube 1.
      <br/>
      The single-crystal silicon substrate had a diameter of 25 mm, thickness of 0.5 mm and specific resistivity of 1  OMEGA  * cm and was a p-type semiconductor.
      <br/>
      The evacuation device (not shown) was activated to reduce the pressure in the reaction tube down to 10-6 Torr and then the heater 2 was energized to heat the silicon substrate to 800 (degree)  C. Subsequently, methane gas, hydrogen gas and diborane gas (concentration 1000 ppm diluted with hydrogen) were introduced into the reaction tube 1 from respective cylinders.
      <br/>
      The rates of supply of the methane gas, hydrogen gas and diborane gas were controlled to 1 SCCM, 200 SCCM and 1 SCCM, respectively, by using flowmeters and flow rate controllers.
      <br/>
      Then, the pressure regulating valve (not shown) was opened to set the pressure in the reaction tube to 50 Torr, and electrical power was supplied to the filament 3 from a power supply (not shown) so as to red-heat the filament to about 2000 (degree)  C. The material was decomposed by the heated filament, whereby diamond was formed on the substrate 4.
    </p>
    <p num="33">
      A diamond crystal layer of about 4  MU m thick was formed on the substrate after 5-hour reaction.
      <br/>
      The diamond crystal layer was then annealed in the reaction tube 1 so that the surface was graphitized.
      <br/>
      More specifically, the graphitizing annealing was conducted in a nitrogen atmosphere at a pressure of 500 Torr and a temperature of 950 (degree)  C. for 10 minutes.
    </p>
    <p num="34">
      Then, Ti was evaporation-deposited by vacuum evaporation method on the thus graphitized surface of the diamond crystal layer, and I-V characteristics were measured by a method illustrated in FIG. 3.
      <br/>
      In FIG. 3, numeral 11 designates a silicon substrate, 12 denotes a diamond layer, 13 denotes a silver paste (electrode with ohmic junction with silicon), 14 denotes the evaporation-deposited Ti film and 15 denotes a D.C. source and an ammeter.
    </p>
    <p num="35">
      The line A in FIG. 4 shows the I-V characteristics as measured by the method shown in FIG. 3.
      <br/>
      It will be seen that good ohmic junction characteristics has been obtained.
    </p>
    <p num="36">Diamond crystal after graphitization conducted under the same conditions as above was observed through an electron microscope to confirm that a graphite layer of 15  Angstrom  thick was formed on the surface of the diamond.</p>
    <p num="37">Comparative Example 1</p>
    <p num="38">
      Diamond layer was formed under the same conditions as Example 1 except that the graphite layer was not formed, and the I-V characteristics of a sample thus obtained were measured.
      <br/>
      The characteristics as measured were shown by the curve B in FIG. 4.
      <br/>
      It will be seen that ohmic junction characteristics are inferior in this case.
    </p>
    <p num="39">Example 2</p>
    <p num="40">After forming a diamond crystal layer by the same method as Example 1, a graphite layer was formed by treating the diamond crystal layer for 10 seconds in the same apparatus at a pressure of 10 Torr and oven temperature of 900 (degree)  C. under the supply of CH4 and H2 at rates of 8 SCCM and 100 SCCM, respectively, while heating the filament to 2000 (degree)  C.</p>
    <p num="41">
      The diamond crystal layer with the graphite layer thus formed was subjected to measurement of I-V characteristic conducted under the same conditions as Example 1.
      <br/>
      Superior ohmic junction characteristics well comparing with that of Example 1 was confirmed.
    </p>
    <p num="42">Diamond crystal after a graphitization conducted under the same conditions as above was observed through an electron microscope to confirm that a graphite layer of 30  Angstrom  thick was formed on the surface of the diamond.</p>

      Diamonds were formed on Si substrates by microwave plasma CVD method, by supplying methane, hydrogen and diborane (concentration 100 ppm, diluted with hydrogen) at rates of 1.5 SCCM, 200 SCCM and 0.8 SCCM, respectively, while setting the microwave power to 400 W. The substrate temperature and the pressure in the quartz reaction tube were maintained at 830 (degree)  C. and 50 Torr, respectively.
      <br/>
      After 6-hour synthesis operation, semiconductor diamond films of abut 5  MU m were formed on the substrates.

      A graphite layer was formed on each of the thus-formed diamond crystal layer by using the same apparatus as that used in Example 1.
      <br/>
      The graphitization was conducted while setting the microwave output to 500 W, at a pressure of 100 Torr and substrate temperature of 980 (degree)  C., under supply of CH4 and H2 at 10 SCCM and 150 SCCM, respectively.
      <br/>
      The graphitization time was varied according to the samples.
      <br/>
      The samples thus obtained were subjected to measurement of ohmic junction characteristic to obtain results as shown in Table 1 below.
      <br/>
      The graphite layer thickness values were determined through electron microscopic observation.
