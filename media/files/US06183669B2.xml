      <br/>
      Field of the Invention
    </p>
    <p num="2">The present invention relates to a paste composition having various characteristics, and a circuit board using the same.</p>
    <p num="3">Further, the present invention relates to a ceramic green sheet having insulating, dielectric and magnetic properties and a ceramic substrate using the ceramic green sheet, and a method for manufacturing a ceramic multilayer substrate.</p>
    <p num="4">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
    <p num="5">
      In order to allow the circuit board integrated into electronic appliances such as mobile terminal devices and computers to exhibit its function, conductor patterns and via-holes should be formed through the substrates.
      <br/>
      The conductor patterns and via-holes in the circuit board mounted in these electronic appliances should be fine and highly precise, especially in order to comply with the recent requirements for making high frequency electronic devices to be highly integrated and to respond to high speed signals.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      The via-holes have been usually formed by printing an insulating paste composition prepared by mixing an insulating inorganic powder such as a glass with an organic vehicle through a given screen mask on the substrate, and filling a conductive paste composition into the holes intended to become the via-holes, followed by firing the substrate.
      <br/>
      However, a via-hole having a diameter of at best approximately 200  MU m can be formed due to blotting and blurring during the screen printing.
    </p>
    <p num="7">Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 6-283846 discloses, on the other hand, a method for forming the fine via-holes by a photolithographic method using a photosensitive paste composition prepared by additionally mixing photosensitive organic components in the insulating paste composition.</p>
    <p num="8">
      Recently, it has been desired that the photosensitive paste composition used in the photolithographic method be able to be developed with water or an aqueous alkaline solution in consideration of the effect on the environment.
      <br/>
      Therefore, acidic functional groups such as carboxyl groups are introduced into the photosensitive organic binder.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      However, when multivalent metal compounds (especially multivalent metal oxides) having a valence of two or more are used as the insulating inorganic powder in the photosensitive organic binder, the multivalent inorganic ions dissolved into the soluble fraction of the photosensitive paste composition react with anions of the photosensitive organic binder, forming three dimensional network of ionic cross-links to develop gelation.
      <br/>
      Coating of the paste becomes difficult when the photosensitive paste composition is gelled or, even if coating be possible, the development process becomes so unstable that the paste composition is hardly applicable.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      For preventing gelation, Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 9-218509, 9-218508 and 9-222723 have disclosed photolithographic methods using photosensitive paste compositions comprising phosphorous containing compounds such as phosphoric acid, compounds having azole structures such as benzotriazole, and organic compounds having carboxyl groups, respectively.
      <br/>
      However, the time interval before forming a gel of the photosensitive paste composition is merely extended for a while by these methods, and using the photosensitive paste composition comprising an inorganic powder containing multivalent metal compounds such as a glass powder and ceramic powder have been practically difficult.
    </p>
    <p num="11">
      Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 10-171107 discloses a method for preventing gelation, thus improving preservation stability, by including 3-methyl-3-methoxybutanol in the photosensitive paste composition.
      <br/>
      However, since 3-methyl-3-methoxybutanol has a boiling point as low as 174 (degree)  C., the compound is completely evaporated from coating films that have been dried after coating, often decreasing the effect for preventing gelation.
      <br/>
      It is also a problem that the portions not exposed to the light are hardly dissolved into the development solvent when the photosensitive paste composition using the compound is subjected to a development treatment.
    </p>
    <p num="12">
      Further, it is effective for making ceramic multilayer substrates represented by substrates for use in high frequency modules and hybrid ICs to be more multifunctional and highly integrated, and to have higher performance, to form a high density wiring while packaging high precision passive members in the ceramic multilayer substrate.
      <br/>
      For example, Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 9-92983 discloses a method for manufacturing a ceramic multilayer substrate integrating passive members such as inductors and capacitors, wherein the inductors and capacitors are partially formed on the ceramic multilayer substrate using a ceramic green sheet having various characteristics such as an insulating property, a dielectric property and a magnetic property.
    </p>
    <p num="13">
      Fine via-holes should be formed through the ceramic green sheet having the insulating property, dielectric property and magnetic property, in order to make the ceramic multilayer capacitor to be multifunctional and highly integrated, and to have higher performance.
      <br/>
      Via-holes have been formed through the ceramic green sheet by punching with a press mold.
      <br/>
      However, since the ceramic green sheet is processed by impressing a mechanical load, a via-hole having a diameter of at most approximately 100  MU m can be formed.
    </p>
    <p num="14">
      Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 10-279364 discloses, for example, a method for forming finer via-holes using a photolithographic method.
      <br/>
      This method comprises preparing a photosensitive ceramic green sheet by forming a sheet of a slurry by mixing a photosensitive resin and ceramic powder, and exposing the green sheet with an activation light beam such as UV light through a photo-mask followed by development for forming fine via-holes.
    </p>
    <p num="15">
      However, the organic polymer compound in organic binders, especially in photosensitive organic binders, has an acidic functional group that liberates protons such as a carboxylic group and hydroxyl group as its side chain.
      <br/>
      When a powder containing multivalent metals or their oxides such as a glass powder and ceramic powder is mixed with an organic polymer compound having acidic functional groups, ionic cross links among the multivalent metal ions dissolved out of the powder and organic polymer compounds are formed to cause gelation by forming a three dimensional network.
    </p>
    <p num="16">
      A nonuniform slurry in which gels are formed has a low processing performance, making it difficult to form a sheet as well as via-holes and conductor patterns.
      <br/>
      Forming a ceramic green sheet using a nonuniform slurry results in a mechanically fragile ceramic substrate due to, for example, cracks generated during firing.
    </p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="17">To overcome the above described problems, preferred embodiments of the present invention provide a paste composition that is able to form various fine and highly precise patterns, including the via-holes, by suppressing gelation caused when an organic binder having acidic functional groups and a multivalent metal compound having a valence of two or more are mixed, and a circuit board using the same.</p>
    <p num="18">Further, preferred embodiments of the present invention provide a ceramic green sheet having good dispersing property and processing performance by suppressing gel formation of the slurry prepared by mixing an organic polymer compound having acidic functional groups with a ceramic powder and glass powder containing multivalent metals or their oxides.</p>
    <p num="19">Further, preferred embodiments of the present invention provide a mechanically tough ceramic substrate using a ceramic green sheet having a good dispersion ability, or provide a method for manufacturing a highly reliable ceramic multilayer substrate having a highly integrated and fine conductor pattern.</p>
    <p num="20">The inventors of the present invention have found, through intensive studies for solving the foregoing problems, that gelation is sufficiently suppressed in the paste or slurry before coating, and in the coated film after coating and drying, by including a mono-ol compound having a boiling point of about 178 (degree)  C. or more in the paste composition or slurry prepared by mixing an organic binder having acidic functional groups and a multivalent metal compound having a valence of two or more.</p>
    <p num="21">One preferred embodiment of the present invention provides a paste composition prepared by mixing: (A) an organic binder comprising acidic functional groups; (B) an inorganic powder containing multivalent metal compounds; and (C) a mono-ol compound having a boiling point of about 178 (degree)  C. or more.</p>
    <p num="22">The above described paste composition may comprise a glass powder and/or ceramic powder.</p>
    <p num="23">Preferably, the paste composition according to the present invention contains about 30% or more and less than about 90% by volume of the inorganic powder.</p>
    <p num="24">Preferably, the paste composition according to the present invention additionally contains a photosensitive organic component.</p>
    <p num="25">Preferably, the mean particle size of the inorganic powder in the paste composition has a mean particle size in the range of about 0.1 to 10  MU m.</p>
    <p num="26">The above described paste composition may additionally contain a UV absorbing agent.</p>
    <p num="27">Preferably, the organic binder in the paste composition according to the present invention is an acrylic copolymer having carboxylic groups on its side chain.</p>
    <p num="28">The paste composition according to the present invention preferably contains at least twice as many moles of the mono-ol compound as the moles of the multivalent metal ions that are dissolved into the soluble fraction of the paste.</p>
    <p num="29">Preferably, the paste composition according to the present invention additionally contains organic solvents, the mono-ol compound accounting for about 10 to 92% by weight of the combined content of the mono-ol compound and organic solvents.</p>
    <p num="30">Further, there is provided a circuit board comprising a layer formed by firing the above described paste composition.</p>
    <p num="31">
      The paste composition according to the present invention is produced by adding a mono-ol compound having a boiling point of about 178 (degree)  C. or more into the paste composition prepared by mixing the organic binder having acidic functional groups and inorganic powder containing multivalent metal compounds with a valence of two or more.
      <br/>
      Therefore, gelation is sufficiently suppressed in the paste before coating, and in the coated film after coating and drying, besides enabling fine and highly precise patterns such as via-holes to be formed.
    </p>
    <p num="32">The circuit board according to the present invention is provided with layers (insulating layer, dielectric layer and the like) formed by firing the paste composition according to the present invention in order to form fine and highly precise patterns, thereby enabling a highly integrated circuit board that complies with the recent requirements of high signal speed to be obtained.</p>
    <p num="33">
      The hydroxyl group (--OH) in the mono-ol compound has a markedly strong binding force with the multivalent metal ions as compared with the acidic functional groups (especially carboxyl groups) in the organic binder.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the multivalent metal ions dissolved into the soluble fraction of the paste composition preferentially react with the mono-ol compound to prevent ionic cross-links between the anions of the organic binder and multivalent metal ions from forming three dimensional networks.
      <br/>
      Since the mono-ol compound has only one hydroxyl group, three dimensional networks by the ionic cross links are not formed when the mono-ol compound has reacted with the multivalent metal ions.
      <br/>
      Moreover, since the mono-ol compound has a boiling point of about 178 (degree)  C. or more, it remains in the coating film even when the film is dried after coating, thus sufficiently exhibiting gelation preventive function.
    </p>
    <p num="34">The photosensitive paste composition prepared by further adding a photosensitive organic component in the paste composition according to the present invention allows gelation to be sufficiently suppressed in the paste prior to coating as well as in the coating film after drying, enabling a stable development process by the photolithographic method to be applied.</p>
    <p num="35">Another preferred embodiment of the present invention provides a ceramic green sheet manufactured by forming a sheet of slurry prepared by mixing: (A) an organic binder comprising acidic functional groups; (B) an inorganic powder containing multivalent metal compounds; and (C) a mono-ol compound having a boiling point of about 178 (degree)  C. or more.</p>
    <p num="36">The ceramic green sheet may contain twice as many moles, or more, of the mono-ol compound as the moles of the multivalent metal ions that are dissolved into the solvent fraction of the slurry.</p>
    <p num="37">The content of the mono-ol compound may be about 5 to 95% by weight relative to the total solvent fraction of the slurry.</p>
    <p num="38">The ceramic powder and/or glass powder preferably contains at least one of the multivalent ions selected from a group comprising boron, barium, magnesium, aluminum, calcium, lead, bismuth, copper, zinc, zirconium, niobium, chromium, strontium and titanium.</p>
    <p num="39">The slurry may further contains a photosensitive organic component.</p>
    <p num="40">The ceramic substrate preferably comprises a ceramic layer prepared by firing the ceramic green sheet.</p>
    <p num="41">Further, there is provided a method for manufacturing a ceramic multilayer substrate comprising the steps of: forming a via-hole through the above described ceramic green sheet; laminating plural green sheets containing the ceramic green sheet after forming conductor patterns being in electrical continuity with the via-holes; and firing the laminated green sheet.</p>
    <p num="42">According to the above arrangement, a ceramic green sheet having good dispersing property and processing performance can be obtained by suppressing gelation of the slurry.</p>
    <p num="43">
      The hydroxyl group in the mono-ol compound has a remarkable binding force to multivalent ions dissolved out of the ceramic powder and glass powder as compared with acidic groups (especially carboxylic groups) of the organic polymer compound in the organic binder.
      <br/>
      Therefore, a priority is given to the reaction of the mono-ol compound with multivalent metal ions to prevent formation of ionic cross-links and three dimensional networks among the organic polymer compounds and multivalent metal ions.
      <br/>
      Since the mono-ol compound possesses only one hydroxyl group, the three dimensional network of ionic cross-links is not formed when the mono-ol compound is bound to the multivalent metal ions.
    </p>
    <p num="44">Fine and highly precise via-holes can be formed through the photosensitive ceramic green sheet containing a photosensitive organic component, enabling a ceramic green sheet, being possible to comply with the requirement of making semiconductor patterns to be super-fine, to be obtained.</p>
    <p num="45">The above described ceramic substrate is provided with ceramic layers formed by firing the uniform ceramic green sheet according to the present invention having a good processing performance, thereby making it possible to obtain a dense ceramic substrate with high strength.</p>
    <p num="46">The above described method for manufacturing the ceramic multilayer substrate using the ceramic green sheet having a good processing performance and dispersing ability allows via-holes and conductor patterns to be finely formed with a high density.</p>

    <p num="50">
      The inorganic powder may be a glass powder and/or ceramic powder in the paste composition according to the present invention.
      <br/>
      Glass powders known in the art such as a borosilicate glass powder may be used for the glass powder while a crystalline glass, composite glass and non-glass powders may be used for the ceramic powder.

    <p num="53">
      It is desirable that the volume ratio of the inorganic powders in the paste composition according to the present invention is in the range of about 30 to 90% for improving sintering property of the paste composition.
      <br/>
      When the volume ratio is less than about 30%, the volume vigorously contracts by firing, often causing breakdown of wiring after forming a wiring pattern.
    </p>
    <p num="54">
      When the volume ratio exceeds about 90%, on the other hand, structural strength of the composition becomes so weak that the structure is often collapses during firing.

    <p num="55">
      An photosensitive organic component is preferably contained in the paste composition according to the present invention.

      In other words, the photosensitive paste composition is formulated by including the photosensitive organic component in the paste composition.
    </p>
    <p num="56">Gelation of the paste composition is sufficiently suppressed in either the paste before coating or in the coating film after coating and drying, since the photosensitive paste composition according to the present invention contains a mono-ol compound having a boiling point of about 178 (degree)  C. or more, thereby improving its stability while stabilizing the development process in the photolithographic method.</p>

      To the contrary, patterns could not be formed when the mono-ol compounds has a boiling point of less than about 178 (degree)  C. because non-exposed portions were not dissolved into the development solution.

      This is probably because the mono-ol compounds had evaporated off from the coating films during the drying step after coating the photosensitive paste compositions, thereby deteriorating gelation preventing ability with time lapse.

    <p num="419">
      On the contrary, the ceramic green sheet according to the comparative examples had low bending strength or low substrate density after sintering because they did not contain any mono-ol compounds such as dipropyleneglycol monomethyl ether.

      As hitherto described, including the mono-ol compound having a boiling point of 178 (degree)  C. or more in the slurry for the ceramic green sheet prevents gelation from advancing and enables a uniform slurry to be obtained.
