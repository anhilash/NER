    <heading>INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND</heading>
    <p num="2">The present invention describes a new method for synthesis of an amino-deoxy-disaccharide or an amino-deoxy-oligosaccharide and N-containing saccharides.</p>
    <p num="3">
      It has been found that the oligosaccharide part of various glycoconjugates (especially glycolipids and glycoproteins) have a number of important functions in vivo (Biology of Carbohydrates, vol. 2, Ginsburg et al., Wiley, New York, 1984; The Glycoconjugates, vol. I-V, Academic Press, New York; S. Hakomori, Ann.
      <br/>
      Rev. Biochem., vol 50, pp. 733-64; Feizi, Nature, pp 314, 1985; S. Hakomori, Chemistry and Physics of Lipids, vol. 42, pages 209-33).
      <br/>
      Among other thing it was found that
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      the carbohydrate structures are important for the stability, activity, localization, immunogenicity and degradation of glycoproteins;
      <br/>
      carbohydrates are antigenic determinants (for example blood group antigens);
      <br/>
      carbohydrates function as receptors when bound to cell surfaces for pathogens, proteins, hormones, toxins and during cell-cell interactions;
      <br/>
      carbohydrates are important for oncogenesis, since specific oligosaccharides have been found to be cancer-associated antigenic determinants;
      <br/>
      frequently, only a smaller sequence (di- or trisaccharide) of the carbohydrate part of the glycoconjugate is required for full biological activity (e.g. receptor activity).
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      Universities and industry are at present working intensely on developing the use of biologically active oligosaccharides within a number of different fields, such as
      <br/>
      novel diagnostics and blood typing reagents;
      <br/>
      highly specific materials for affinity chromatography;
      <br/>
      cell specific agglutination reagents;
      <br/>
      targetting of drugs;
      <br/>
      monoclonal antibodies, specific against e.g. cancer-associated reagents;
      <br/>
      therapy;
      <br/>
      development of a new type of therapy, as an alternative to antibiotics, based on the inhibition of the attachement of bacteria and virus on cell surfaces with specific oligosaccharides;
      <br/>
      stimulation of the growth of plants and protection against pathogens.
    </p>
    <p num="6">Besides the above mentioned areas, a considerable future market is envisaged for fine chemicals based on biologically active carbohydrates.</p>
    <p num="7">
      Amino-saccharides, where an --OH group in the saccharide is exchanged for an --NH2 group, in several cases have a higher (or modified) biological activity than the corresponding hydroxyl- or N-acetylamino-deoxy-saccharides, e.g. in the binding to selectins important for the initiation of inflammation processes (binding of leucocytes to epithelial cells in blood vessels).
      <br/>
      The opportunity to use such saccharides therapeutically, e.g. in acute or chronic inflammatory conditions (e.g. reperfusion, injury, and septic shock) is investigated.
      <br/>
      An important component in this and in other cases is the selective synthesis of di- and oligosaccharides in sufficient quantities.
      <br/>
      The present invention describes novel techniques for synthesis of amino-saccharides and novel techniquies for synthesis N-containing saccharides from such amino-saccharides.
    </p>
    <p num="8">Amino-deoxy-di-, tri- or higher oligosaccharides which contain one or more amino --NH2 groups are of high interest for food, agricultural, pharmaceutical or diagnostic applications of carbohydrates, to modify the metabolism of the substance and/or to increase the biological effect of the natural substance.</p>
    <p num="9">
      About ten different monosaccharides are included in the carbohydrate part of the glycoconjugates: D-glucose (Glc), D-galactose (Gal), N-acetyl-D-glucosamine (GlcNAc), N-acetyl-D-neuraminic acid (Neu5Ac), D-mannose (Man), L-fucose (Fuc), N-acetyl-D-galactosamine (GalNAc), xylose (xyl), and arabinose (Ara) (the abbreviations in brackets are according to IUPAC-IUB's abridged terminology for monosaccharides, J.Biol.Chem. (1982), vol. 257, pages 3347-3354, in which publication one also can find the nomenclature used in this text to describe oligosaccharide sequences).
      <br/>
      The number of possible structures will be almost infinitely great because both the anomeric configuration and the position of the O-glycosidic bond can be varied.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      The organic chemical techniques used today for synthesis of these oligosaccharide structures require an extensive protective group chemistry with many steps of synthesis and expensive catalysts (see e.g. Binkley: Modern Carbohydrate Chemistry, Marcel Dekker, New York, 1988, with references).
      <br/>
      Low total yields are obtained in these complicated reaction schemes and the technique is not favorable, especially for larger scale work.
    </p>
    <p num="11">
      Selective chemical synthesis of amino group containing carbohydrates and derivatives require advanced protection group chemistry with many synthetic steps. (see e.g. Binkley: Modern Carbohydrate Chemistry, Marcel Dekker, New York, 1988, with references).
      <br/>
      Efficient techniques for preparation of such carbohydrates and derivatives thereof are thus desired.
    </p>
    <p num="12">
      The present invention describes a process which makes possible a drastically simplified synthesis of derivatised or unmodified di-, tri-, and higher oligosaccharides which contain at least one --NH2 (amino) group, and a process for the synthesis of N-containing saccharides from such derivatised or unmodified di-, tri-, and higher oligosaccharides which contain at least one --NH2 (amino) group.
      <br/>
      Carbohydrate amino derivatives which required several reaction steps to synthesis with previous methods, can, with the method according to the present invention, now be obtained with only one reaction step and with absolute stereospecificity.
    </p>
    <p num="13">
      Enzymes are nature's own catalysts with many attractive characteristics, such as higher stereo-, regio-, and substrate selectivity as well as high catalytic activity under mild conditions.
      <br/>
      Today, great hopes are therefore placed in being able to utilize enzymes for large-scale selective synthesis of oligosaccharides with fewer reaction steps and consequently higher total yields than by organic chemical methodology.
    </p>
    <p num="14">
      Both hydrolases (glycosidases, EC 3.2) and glycosyltranferases (EC 2.4) can be used for synthesis (glycosidases: see Nisizawa et al, in "The Carbohydrates, Chemistry and Biochemistry", 2nd Ed., vol. IIA, pages 242-290, Academic Press, New York, 1970).
      <br/>
      With glycosidases, reversed hydrolysis (equilibrium reaction) or tranglycosylation (kinetic reaction) are often used to obtain synthesis (see e.g. K. G. I. Nilsson, Carbohydr.
      <br/>
      Res. (1987), vol. 167, pages 95-103; Trends in Biochemistry (1988), vol. 6, pages 256-264).  (Chemical Structure image '1' not included in text)

    <p num="16">
      With transferases, a nucleotide sugar (non-limiting examples are UDP-Gal, CMP-Sia, UDP-GalNAc, GDP-Fuc, etc), which is relatively expensive, is used as donor.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, glycosidases are abundant and can often be used directly without purification.
    </p>
    <p num="17">The synthetic method according to the invention includes at least one process characterized by that a glycosidase (EC 3.2) is used to catalyze an equilibrium or a transglycosylation reaction between an acceptor substance, which consists of a mono-, di-, tri- or higher oligosaccharide which contains at least one amino-deoxy group  (Chemical Structure image '2' not included in text)</p>
    <p num="18">and which is modified or unmodified, and a glycosyl donor, which is a monsaccharide, disaccharide, oligosaccharide or a glycoside or derivative thereof, and that the product is used for continued synthesis and/or is isolated from the product mixture.</p>
    <p num="19">In this way one obtains, according to the invention, stereospecific synthesis of di-, tri-, or higher amino-deoxyoligosaccharides or derivatives thereof, which can be used directly, or after further synthesis, for a number of various applications, e.g. for pharmaceutical/medical/diagnostical studies, for applications in therapy or diagnostics, as additives in cosmetics or in food, for modification of separation material, affinity chromatography, modification of amino acids, peptides, proteins, fatty acids, lipids, enzymes, or recombinant proteins.</p>

    <p num="21">
      The reaction according to the invention can be carried out according to two principles, either with equilibrium controlled synthesis (R=H), or with transglycosylation reaction (R=F, or an organic group; kinetically controlled reaction).
      <br/>
      These general types of reactions are well know to the expert and their carrying out, as well as the choice of glycosyl donor and glycosidase, do not restrict the scope of the invention.

      The substrates are selected with regard to the oligosaccharide which is to be synthesized, and are often commercially available or can by synthesized by organic or enzymatic methods and therefore do not restrict the use of the invention.

      The amino acid and peptide glycosides can be protected on their amino and/or carboxyl groups with the common protecting groups used in peptide synthesis (FMOC, CBZ, BOC, etc).

      Enzyme immobilized to an insoluble polymer comprising, for example, agarose, cellulose, hydroxyethyl acrylate, glass, silica, polyacrylic amide, polyacrylate-based plastics, etc., is readily separated from the product mixture, and the enzyme may thus be reused.

      If a modified 2-amino galactoside of glucoside is used as acceptor, the choice of aglycon is made with regard to the application of the product.

      Product obtained with modified alkyl glycosides (e.g. modified methyl-, octyl-, docecyl glycosides) as acceptor substances, may be used as inhibitors in affinity chromatography or in agglutination tests, inhibition-based therapy or for drug-targeting, as structural units for further enzymatic synthesis.
      <br/>
      Nitrophenyl glycosides can be reduced to aminophenyl glycosides.
      <br/>
      Glycosides with a polymerisable aglycon, as for example 2-hydroxyethylemethacrylate, can be used.
      <br/>
      As an example of a N-glucosidically bonded aglycon, --NHCO (CH2)5 NH2, may be mentioned.
      <br/>
      Other types of aglycons which can be used are those used e.g. in the synthesis of glycolipids/analogs for conversion to ceramides/analogs, e.g. aglycons of the type described by Magnusson et al in J. Org. Chem., 1990. Thioglycosides (e.g. SEt or SPh) can be used with the method according to the invention to produce products which are suitable for further chemical synthesis.

      The choice of protection group/derivative, aglycon, position of derivatized hydroxyl groups, can be used to influence the yield and regioselectivity of the reactions with the method according to the invention.
      <br/>
      Thus, for example, the use of more hydrophobic aglycons (e.g. p-metoxy-benzyl-, benzyl-, compared with e.g. allyl-) can result in a higher yield at the same acceptor concentration.

      The enzymes are selected with regard to the final oligosaccharide which is to be synthesized.
      <br/>
      The enzyme can be used in situ (especially several glycosidases) or after partial or complete purification from their natural environment.

      The enzyme may be used in soluble form or immobilized to a solid phase by e.g. adsorption, encapsulation, chelation, precipitation or covalent binding.
      <br/>
      Simultaneous use of glycosidase and glycosyltransferase in soluble form or immobilized to a solid phase (eventually co-immobilized) may be advantageous according to the invention in facilitating the conversion of the intermediate oligosaccharide product to the final product oligosaccharide.
      <br/>
      In this way the method according to the invention gives important advantages compared to previous methods: purification of intermediary product is not necessary, secondary hydrolysis is minimized (i.e. higher yield), and trisaccharides or higher oligosaccharides can be synthesized in a minimum of "pots" (in some cases one-pot reactions).
      <br/>
      This is facilitated by the high acceptor specificity of most glycosyltransferases: the transferase does not react with the wrong isomer.

      The synthetic procedure according to the invention can be carried out under highly diverse conditions as regards, for example, pH, type of buffer, temperature and concentration of the reactants.
      <br/>
      Various cosolvents (N,N-dimethyl formamide, acetonitrile, dimethyl sulfoxide, dioxane, pyridine, methanol, ethanol, ethylene glycol, etc) may be used and in varying concentrations together with water (0-99%).
      <br/>
      Moreover, the reactions can be carried out in two-phase systems: water-organic solvent.
      <br/>
      THe use of acceptor aminosaccharides modified with organic groups facilitates recovery of the product in the organic phase.

    <p num="55">
      The reaction conditions are not critical but are selected primarily on the basis of the properties of the reactants employed in the synthesis concerned, and also on the basis of practicality.
      <br/>
      For example, it may be mentioned that it is usually convenient to use room temperature with enzymes and, in the case of water-rich medium, the pH is usually in the range 4-11.
      <br/>
      The solubility of amino-saccharides in water is increased/decreased by decreased/increased pH, and in some cases a pH below 8 and above 4 is preferably used to increase the solubility of the acceptor amino-saccharide.

      Organic cosolvents may be used to minimize the hydrolytic side-reaction.
      <br/>
      For the same reason, two-phase systems may be used.

      Examples of cosolvents are tetrahydrofurane, acetonitrile, DMF.
      <br/>
      The choice of solvent and of the concentration or organic solvent can easily be made by the expert and does not limit the scope of the invention.
      <br/>
      Use of high concentrations of organic solvent (up to almost 100% of the total volume solvent) can be especially advantageous when acceptor derivatives with hydrophobic groups which have good solubility in organic solvents are used, e.g. acceptors modified with ester groups (e.g. acetyl-, bensoly-, butanoyl-, pivaloyl-, octanoyl-grupper, etc.) and/or with for example allyl, bensyl, trityl- or other groups.
      <br/>
      In this way relatively high concentration of the acceptor can be achieved in organic solvents and the hydrolytic side-reaction can be decreased due to the low water content.
      <br/>
      The method according to the invention allows synthesis in organic solvent of e.g. amino deoxy trisaccharde derivatives and higher oligosaccharide derivatives with exoglycosidases by using hydrophobic protected derivatives of amino deoxy di-, tri- or oligosaccharides, which has only one or a few free dydroxyl groups, as acceptors.
    </p>
    <p num="57">To increase the solubility/availability in organic solvent and facilitate the reaction with the donor substance, one can use for example phenyl boronate, which forms a complex with saccharides with vicinal diols and the resulting donor-boronate complex has, because of the phenyl group, a higher solubility in organic solvent.</p>
    <p num="58">
      The reaction temperature may also be varied to influence product yield and the stability of the enzyme and does not restrict the scope of the invention.
      <br/>
      The temperatures most frequently used lie in the range 4 (degree) -55 (degree)  C., but lower temperatures and temperatures below 0 (degree)  C. can be used which can be facilitated if organic cosolvent is used.
      <br/>
      Higher temperatures can be used with thermostable glycosidases and substrates, and also with enzymes stabilized against thermal denaturation by employing, for example, high substrate concentrations (Johansson et al, Biotechnol.
      <br/>
      Lett. (1986), vol. 8, pages 421-424).
      <br/>
      An advantage with high temperatures is, for example, that high substrate concentrations may be used, which reduces the water activity and thus increases the yield of product.
      <br/>
      Another advantage is that the activity of the enzyme increases, which means shorter reaction times at increased temperatures.
      <br/>
      One additional advantage is that glycosides, e.g. methyl or ethyl glycosides, which are hydrolyzed slowly at room temperature can be used as suitable glycosyl donors at increased temperatures (50 (degree) -60 (degree)  C.).
      <br/>
      The upper temperature limit is determined by the thermostability of the enzyme in the reaction medium.
      <br/>
      For some transglycosidations, a lower temperature was found to give a higher yield of product glycoside.

    <p num="59">
      The concentration of the acceptor is a parameter which can be used to influence the yield of the reactions according to invention.
      <br/>
      High concentrations are preferrable in both equilibrium and transglycosylation reactions to mimimize hydrolytic side-reactions, which usually means that depending on the solubility of the acceptor, ca 0.05-7 M concentration of acceptor is used.
      <br/>
      A high concentration of donor is often used and especially in equilibrium reactions.
      <br/>
      In general, high concentrations of substrates are obtained by heating the reaction mixture to near the boiling point for a few minutes, allowing the solution to cool to the reaction temperature (usually 4 (degree) -75 (degree)  C., depending on the temperature for optimum yield and thermostability of the enzyme/substrate and then add the enzyme.

      Cosolvents can be used to increase the solubility of substrates with hydrophobic groups.

      The reaction can be monitored by means of TLC, HPLC, or by spectrophotometric measurement of liberated aglycon (e.g. p-nitrophenol, 400 nm).

      Charring of TLC-plates with ninhydrin may be used for detection of NH2 -groups.
      <br/>
      When a desirable yield of the product has been obtained, the reaction is terminated by denaturation of the enzyme by changing the pH, increasing the temperature and/or adding organic cosolvent (such as ethanol).
      <br/>
      Heating to 60 (degree) -85 (degree)  C. for 3-5 min (eventually followed by addition of ethanol to a concentration of about 80%) is usually sufficient.

      Various techniques may be used for isolation of the product.
      <br/>
      Precipitation from the water-phase or from an organic solvent (such as e.g. ethanol, methanol, ethyl acetate) is useful, especially when an excess of one of the reactants is used or when the donor, acceptor or products have different solubilities.
      <br/>
      After the equilibrium controlled synthesis or the transglycosylation reaction and after e.g. heat treatment as above and dilution of the reaction mixture, it can be useful to add a second glycosidase, which has a different regioselectivity than the glycosidase used in the synthesis.
      <br/>
      In this way, any unwanted regioisomers (for example with 1-6 linkages) may be more or less selectively hydrolyzed, which facilitates isolation of the desired product.

      The reaction is usually stopped when the maximum yield of amino-saccharide product has been obtained and the product is isolated with, for example, one or more of column chromatography (adsorbent for example ion-exchange material, Sephadex or silica), extraction, precipitation, crystallization and/or filtration techniques.

    <p num="68">As a non-limiting specific example one can mention the production of thioetyl  BETA -D-galactopyranosyl-(6-bensyl-2-amino-2-deoxy)- BETA -D-glucopyranoside produced via reaction between nitrophenyl  BETA -D-galactopyranoside and thioetyl (6-bensyl-2-amino-2-deoxy)- BETA -D-glucopyranoside in e.g. sodium acetate buffer, pH 5, catalyzed by  BETA -galactosidase.</p>
    <p num="69">The product can be used either directly e.g. in biological/medical applications or can be used as a synthetic intermediate for further synthesis of higher oligosaccharides or other derivatives.</p>
    <p num="70">Synthesis of derivatives of Gal BETA 1-3GlcNH2 and Gal BETA 1-4GlcNH2 respectively (constituents of Lewis-blood group substances, such as Lewis-a, Lewis-x and sialylated structures): By using for example derivatised glycoside of glucosamine, such as e.g. structures XIII or XIV, as acceptor dissolved in for example (1/1 V/V) tetrahydrofurane:sodium acetate buffer (pH 5.5, 0.05 M), Gal BETA -OPpNO2 -0 as donor, and  BETA -galactosidase as catalyst, structures of the types below can be obtained:  (Chemical Structure image '10' not included in text)</p>
    <p num="71">
      Such structures can be used directly in various applications, or can be used for further chemical or enzymatic synthesis.
      <br/>
      The galactosyl moiety can for example be modified with chemical or enzymatic methods (lipase or galactose oxidase, followed by chemical modification) leaving one free hydroxyl group in the glucosaminyl-moiety, which can be modified with for example a fucosyl group.
    </p>
    <p num="72">Similarly, by using an acceptor of the type below, the corresponding  BETA -bound 3-O-protected Gal-GlcNH2 -derivative can be obtained.</p>
    <p num="73">
      After protection of the free hydroxyl groups and the amino group in the product and deprotection of the 3-O-position can, for example, an  ALPHA -bound L-focosyl group can be introduced, which gives the modified Lewis-x structure, which can be, for example, sialylated to give e.g. NeuAc ALPHA 2-3Gal BETA 1-4(Fuc ALPHA 1-3)GlcNR2 -R.
      <br/>
      In an analogous way, one can produce regioisomers, such as Gal BETA 1-3(Fuc ALPHA 1-4)GlcNR2 -R, and analogs/derivatives of Lewis-x, Lewis-a, and of sialylated Lewis-substances.

    <p num="74">Example 1</p>
    <p num="75">A non-limiting example of the application of the method according to the invention is the synthesis of Gal BETA 1-3(6-O-Bn)GlcNH2 BETA SEt employing thioethyl (6-O-bensyl-2-amino-2-deoxy)- BETA -D-glucopyranosid, abbreviated (6-O-Bn)GlcNH2 BETA SEt, as acceptor and galactose or lactose or a galactoside, e.g. nitrophenyl  ALPHA -D-galactopyranoside as glycosyl donor and  BETA -galactosidase from ox testes as catalyst.</p>

      The reaction was carried out at room temperature with initial concentration of substrates typically in the range of 0.06 M to 0.3 M. The donor was used in excess over the acceptor.
      <br/>
      A crude ammonium sulfate precipitate of the enzyme was used in the reaction, which was carried out at pH 5 in 0.05 M sodium acetate buffer.
      <br/>
      The reaction was terminated by heat treatment for ca 5 minutes in a boiling water bath.
      <br/>
      The product was isolated by e.g. adjusting the pH ot ca 10.5 (minimizing the charge on the amino group), extraction of the water phase with ethyl acetate, followed by butanol extraction, the butanol phase was evaporated and the residue dissolved in water and applied to an ion-exchanger (in this example a sulphopropyl group containing fast-flow ion-exchanger from Pharmacia).
      <br/>
      The fractions containing the product was evaporated and the product dried and analyzed by NMR.
    </p>
    <p num="77">Similarly, another 6-O-substituted product than the bensyl-substituted product and/or another type of 1-substituted derivative than the 1-thioethyl substituted product, can be obtained by instead of (6-O-Bn)GlcNH2 BETA SEt employing another 6-O- and/or 1-substituted acceptor as exemplified in the description.</p>
    <p num="78">Another non-limiting example is the synthesis of Fuc ALPHA 1-4 (6-O-Bn)GlcNH2 BETA SEt using thioethyl (6-O-bensyl-2-amino-2-deoxy)- BETA -D-glucopyranoside, abbreviated (6-O-Bn)GlcNH2 BETA SEt, as acceptor and focose or a fucopyranoside, e.g. nitrophenyl  ALPHA -L-fucopyranoside as glycosyl donor and  ALPHA -L-fucosidase from ox kidney as catalyst.</p>
    <p num="79">The reactions above can for example be carried out with ca 0.1 M concentrations of substrate and the isolation can be carried out by the use of an ion changer (e.g. sulphopropyl-containing material) and extraction of the water phase with a suitable solvent, e.g. butanol or ethylacetate.</p>
    <p num="80">The two substances above are of interest for example as inhibitors/modifiers of selectin-carbohydrate interactions in vivo such as in different inflammatory reactions e.g. septic chock, rheumatism and asthma, but also as inhibitors/modifiers of the up-regulation of IgE-synthesis in vivo (for example inhibition, modification of the FceRll-CR interaction, see e.g. Nature (1993), volume 366, page 41-48, and references therein, for an overview).</p>
    <p num="81">
      One of the advantages with the method according to the invention, is that the amino-disaccharide- or the amino-oligosaccharide product and derivatives thereof can be synthesized directly, and thus no modification of the amino-group is required after the glycosidase-catalysed reaction.
      <br/>
      Another advantage is that partially modified amino-sugar derivatives can be produced stereospecifically and under reaction specific conditions.
      <br/>
      Such derivatives can be used directly in various applications or an synthetic intermediates for further synthesis of higher oligosaccharides or other derivatives.
