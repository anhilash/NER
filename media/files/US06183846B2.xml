      The coated hard metal includes a hard coating layer on a surface of a base material of cemented carbide or cermet.
      <br/>
      The hard coating layer includes an inner layer (2) on the base material (1), an intermediate layer (3) on the inner layer (2) and an outer layer (4) on the intermediate layer (3).
      <br/>
      The inner layer (2) consists of a carbide, a nitride, a carbo-nitride, a carbo-oxide, a carbonitrogen oxide or a boronitride of Ti.
      <br/>
      The intermediate layer (3) consists of Al2O3 or ZrO2.
      <br/>
      The outer layer (4) consists of a carbide, a nitride, a carbo-nitride, a carbo-oxide, a carbonitrogen oxide or a boronitride of Ti.
      <br/>
      The thickness of the inner layer (2) is 0.1 to 5 mum, the thickness of the intermediate layer (3) is 5 to 50 mum in the case of it being an Al2O3 layer and 0.5 to 20 mum in the case of it being a ZrO2 layer, and the thickness of the outer layer (4) is 5 to 100 mum.

    <heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">
      The present invention relates to a coated hard metal material prepared by coating cemented carbide or cermet with a hard material, and more particularly, it relates to a coated hard metal material which is employed for a cutting tool.
      <br/>
      The present invention provides a cutting tool material which is excellent in wear resistance and chipping resistance, and can withstand a high-speed or high-efficiency cutting condition, in particular.
    </p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND INFORMATION</heading>
    <p num="3">
      It is known that a cutting edge temperature of a cutting tool during cutting exceeds about 800 (degree)  C. at the maximum even under an ordinary cutting condition with a cutting rate of about 100 to 300 m/min.
      <br/>
      Further, in recent years, manufacturers who use machining operations, such as especially a car manufacturer, have increased the demand for development of a tool which can be used for cutting under a condition of a higher speed or a higher feed rate than the conventional one, such as a high speed of at least 300 m/min., for example, in order to improve productivity per unit time, in consideration of the speed of NC machine tools, to reduce the production cost and to achieve shorter working hours.

      However, the cutting edge temperature of the cutting tool exceeds 1000 (degree)  C. in such a cutting condition, and this is an extremely severe condition for the tool material.
      <br/>
      If the cutting edge temperature is increased, the cutting edge is plastically deformed by heat, to cause regression of the cutting edge position.
      <br/>
      At a temperature exceeding 1000 (degree)  C., further, the base material such as cemented carbide forming the tool is oxidized and wear abruptly progresses.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      In order to avoid such damage of the tool caused by cutting, tools are used that have been prepared by forming various types of hard coating layers on surfaces of hard metals by chemical vapor deposition or physical vapor deposition.
      <br/>
      Historically, a tool coated with a Ti compound first appeared, and improvement of the cutting speed was attained since the same is superior in stability under a high temperature as compared to cemented carbide.
      <br/>
      Thereafter a tool prepared by further coating a Ti compound with an Al2 O3 layer of 1 to 2  MU m thickness was developed to make it possible to further improve the cutting speed, and hence this forms the mainstream of the current coated cutting tool.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      Al2 O3 has a small standard formation free energy, and is chemically more stable than the Ti compound.
      <br/>
      Thus, it is said that an Al2 O3 film brings a great effect for suppression of crater wear in a cutting face portion that is heated to the highest temperature in the cutting edge, and is suitable for high-speed cutting.
      <br/>
      Further it is said that propagation of cutting heat is suppressed and a hard metal material of the tool base can be kept at a low temperature since heat conductivity of Al2 O3 is small.
      <br/>
      In order to develop a tool which is capable of higher speed cutting, therefore, it is expected that the Al2 O3 layer may be further thickened.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      When the Al2 O3 layer is thickened, however, hardness is reduced since bulking of crystal grains forming the coating layers progresses, and a reduction of wear resistance on the flank comes into question.
      <br/>
      It has been recognized that, if such a tool is used in practice, the dimensions of the workpiece being cut are changed by regression of the cutting edge position since the progress of wear is quick, and the life of the tool is extremely short.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      On the other hand, a method of preventing bulking of crystal grains by dividing an Al2 O3 layer into plural layers is proposed in Japanese Patent Publication No. 5-49750. According to this method, the grain size of Al2 O3 can certainly be reduced and wear resistance can be improved.
      <br/>
      On the other hand, boundaries between Al2 O3 and other materials are increased, and hence separation at the interfaces easily takes place.
      <br/>
      In using such a tool for cutting with a large impact such as intermittent cutting, it has generally occurred that damage is abruptly increased due to layer separation in the flank and the cutting face, which abruptly reaches the end of or terminates the tool life.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      Japanese Patent Publication No. 6-15714, on the other hand, proposes a coated sintered alloy prepared by coating with an Al2 O3 layer while dividing the same into an inner layer of 1 to 3  MU m thickness and an outer layer of 0.4 to 20  MU m thickness.
      <br/>
      Both heat insulation and wear resistance are expected as the roles of the Al2 O3 film of the outer layer.
      <br/>
      However, the function of the outer layer as an adiabatic layer is reduced by wear in an early stage, while no specific advice or consideration is given as to wear resistance of the outer layer either.
      <br/>
      Thus, progress of wear is quick, and the life of the tool was extremely short.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      A technique of employing a ZrO2 film whose standard formation free energy is small similarly to Al2 O3 with smaller heat conductivity than Al2 O3 is also proposed in Japanese Patent Publication No. 52-43188 or Japanese Patent Publication No. 54-34182. However, no tool employing ZrO2 as a coating layer has been put into practice up to now.
      <br/>
      This is because a ZrO2 layer is inferior in wear resistance since the hardness of ZrO2 is low as compared with Al2 O3.

      Japanese Patent Publication No. 56-52109 discloses a technique of successively coating a cutting tip of cemented carbide with three layers of a lower layer, an intermediate layer and an upper layer.

      This publication describes that the thickness of the intermediate layer must not exceed 5.0  MU m since toughness is reduced if the intermediate layer exceeds 5  MU m. Further, the publication describes that the thickness of the upper layer must not exceed 3.0  MU m since crystal grains forming the coating layers are bulked when the thickness of the upper layer exceeds 3.0  MU m and this is not preferable.

      In its concrete example, the thickness of the innermost layer is 3  MU m, the thickness of the intermediate layer is 1  MU m, and the thickness of the outermost layer is 2  MU m. The thickness of the outermost layer is not more than the thickness of the innermost layer.

    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="14">An object of the present invention is to solve the aforementioned problems, and provide a coated hard metal material, especially for a cutting tool, which is excellent in wear resistance and chipping resistance.</p>
    <p num="15">Another object of the present invention is to provide a coated hard metal material for a cutting tool which can sufficiently withstand usage not only in an ordinary cutting condition but under such a severe cutting condition of a high speed or high efficiency that the cutting edge temperature exceeds 1000 (degree)  C.</p>
    <p num="16">
      The present invention provides a coated hard metal material in which hard coating layers are provided on a surface of a base material selected from the group consisting of cemented carbide and cermet.
      <br/>
      In the present invention, the hard coating layers comprise the following three layers:
    </p>
    <p num="17">
      (a) an inner layer which is formed on the base material, and consists essentially of at least one layer of a material selected from the group consisting of a carbide, a nitride, a carbo-nitride, a carbo-oxide, a carbo-nitrogen oxide and a boronitride of Ti,
      <br/>
      (b) an intermediate layer which is formed on the inner layer, and is mainly composed of an oxide selected from the group consisting of Al2 O3, ZrO2 and a mixture or a solid solution thereof, whereby the Al2 O3 is especially predominantly or mainly composed of  ALPHA -Al2 O3, and
      <br/>
      (c) an outer layer which is formed on the intermediate layer, and consists essentially of at least one layer of a material selected from the group consisting of a carbide, a nitride, a carbo-nitride, a carbo-oxide, a carbo-nitrogen oxide and a boro-nitride of Ti, and especially at least one layer of TiCN having a molar C:N ratio in the range of 5:5 to 7:3 and being composed of columnar crystals having an aspect ratio in the range from 5 to 80.
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      In the present invention, the thickness of the intermediate layer is at least 5  MU m when the same is mainly composed of Al2 O3, and at least 0.5  MU m when the same is mainly composed of ZrO2.
      <br/>
      The thickness of the outer layer is at least 5  MU m, and exceeds the thickness of the inner layer.
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      In the present invention, the thickness of the inner layer is preferably in the range of 0.1 to 5  MU m. The thickness of the intermediate layer is preferably in the range of 5 to 50  MU m when the same is mainly composed of Al2 O3, and preferably in the range of 0.5 to 20  MU m when the same is mainly composed of ZrO2.
      <br/>
      The thickness of the outer layer is preferably in the range of 5 to 100  MU m, and is especially in the range from 5 to 10  MU m.
    </p>
    <p num="20">
      In the present invention, the outer layer is made thicker than the inner layer, and the thickness of the outer layer is especially set to be at least 5  MU m. Thus, the present invention can maintain good wear resistance for a longer time in cutting conditions from a low speed up to a high speed.
      <br/>
      Further, the present invention employs Al2 O3 or ZrO2 which is excellent in heat insulation for the intermediate layer.
      <br/>
      Particularly the intermediate layer suppresses propagation of heat which is generated in the cutting edge to the base material during cutting work, and suppresses plastic deformation of the base material caused by heat.
      <br/>
      When deformation of the base material in cutting work is suppressed, separation of the coating is also suppressed.
      <br/>
      In the present invention, the intermediate layer which is mainly composed of Al2 O3 is at least 5  MU m thick, and the intermediate layer which is mainly composed of ZrO2 is at least 0.5  MU m thick, as the thickness of the intermediate layer providing sufficient heat insulation.
      <br/>
      In the present invention, the inner layer particularly contributes to adhesion of the hard coating layers. onto the base material.
      <br/>
      On the other hand, the intermediate layer and the outer layer particularly contribute to heat insulation and wear resistance respectively.
      <br/>
      Thus, the present invention makes the three layers provide or carry out different functions respectively, for obtaining a coated hard metal material which can exhibit excellent performance in wide-ranging cutting conditions.
      <br/>
      Further, a superior result can be obtained by setting the thicknesses of the respective layers in proper ranges and/or improving adhesion between the respective layers, as described later.
    </p>
    <p num="21">
      The hard coating layer may further include a thin film that has a thickness of from 0.1 to 2  MU m, and that is arranged between the intermediate layer and the outer layer in contact with the intermediate layer.
      <br/>
      The thin film may consist essentially of at least one of TiBN, TiCo, TiCNO, TiBNO, TiNO, and TiO2, or of at least one of a nitride and an oxy-nitride of Al when the intermediate layer is mainly composed of Al2 O3, or at least one of a carbide, a nitride, a carbo-nitride, a carbo-oxide, an oxy-nitride and a carbonitrogen oxide of Zr when the intermediate layer is mainly composed of ZrO2.
      <br/>
      Another thin film consisting essentially of at least one of Al2 O3, ZrO2, and HfO2 and having a thickness of from 0.5 to 5  MU m can be provided on the outer layer.

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="23">
      In the aforementioned conventional coated hard metal tool, the tool metal base material was coated with a Ti compound, and Al2 O3 Of 1 to 2  MU m in thickness was coated thereon.
      <br/>
      In the prior art, further, a thin TiN or TiCN layer of not more than 3  MU m was formed on Al2 O3.
      <br/>
      The total thickness of the coating layers was about 10  MU m in the prior art.
      <br/>
      In the prior art, further, it is conceivable that the principal role of the outermost layer consisting of TiN or TiCN is identification of a used or worn corner by exhibiting a difference in coloring, and hence the outermost layer is thinner than the film thickness of the inner Ti compound as a matter of course, so that the same is readily worn.
      <br/>
      In the conventional coated hard metal having films of a three-layer structure, therefore, the outer TiN or TiCN film is worn in an early stage, and does not contribute to wear resistance.
      <br/>
      In the prior art, those layers contributing to wear resistance are the inner Ti compound layer and the Al2 O3 layer.
    </p>
    <p num="24">
      In an environment where a coated hard metal tool is used in practice, a thermocouple was embedded in a tool and the temperature of a tool portion was examined.
      <br/>
      Consequently, it has been recognized, in relation to sectional temperature distribution of the tool cutting edge, that the temperature of the flank was lower by about 300 (degree)  C. as compared with the maximum temperature of the cutting face, and the maximum temperature of the flank did not reach 1000 (degree)  C. even in high-speed cutting with a cutting rate of 500 m/min.
      <br/>
      Further, wear resistance properties of a Ti compound, Al2 O3 and ZrO2 were compared with each other at respective cutting temperatures.
      <br/>
      Consequently, it has been recognized that Al2 O3 or ZrO2 is superior in wear resistance when the cutting temperature is at least 1000 (degree)  C. on the flank while the Ti compound is superior in wear resistance under such a condition in which the cutting temperature of the flank is lower than 1000 (degree)  C. Further, it has been proved that Al2 O3 and ZrO2 are more effective in suppression of crater wear than the Ti compound on the cutting face at a temperature of at least 600 (degree)  C.
    </p>
    <p num="25">
      From these facts, it has been determined that the substance which is most excellent in wear resistance under a cutting condition, in which the maximum temperature of the cutting face reaches about at least 600 (degree)  C. and not more than 1300 (degree)  C., i.e., from a low speed cutting condition with a cutting rate of about 100 m/min. to a high-speed cutting condition with a cutting rate of about 500 m/min. is Al2 O3 or ZrO2 on the cutting face, and the Ti compound on the flank.
      <br/>
      As a coating structure in the coated hard metal, therefore, it has been determined that it is preferable that only the Ti compound is coated on the flank and only Al2 O3 or ZrO2 is coated on the cutting face.
      <br/>
      However, it is difficult to vary the deposition material on the different surfaces in case of forming hard coating layers by vapor deposition.
    </p>
    <p num="26">
      In the present invention, therefore, Al2 O3 or ZrO2 was coated on the inner side and a Ti compound was more thickly coated on the outer side, thereby improving wear resistance on the flank, to obtain a coated hard metal which can suppress cutting edge wear and deformation and accordingly also suppress dimensional change of a workpiece.
      <br/>
      As described above, the film thicknesses of the intermediate layer and the outer layer were set to be larger in the coated hard metal having the inner layer consisting essentially of a Ti compound, the intermediate layer consisting essentially of Al2 O3 and/or ZrO2 and the outer layer consisting essentially of a Ti compound, to obtain a tool material which is excellent in wear resistance and chipping resistance.
      <br/>
      When a thick Ti compound is coated on the outer side, a hard film having relatively low wear resistance can be formed inside the same.
      <br/>
      In relation to crater wear resistance, on the other hand, the oxide layer provided inside plays a role of reinforcing the outer Ti compound layer.
    </p>
    <p num="27">
      In high-speed cutting, particularly at such a cutting speed that the cutting edge temperature exceeds 800 (degree)  C., most problematic is plastic deformation of the base material alloy.
      <br/>
      If such plastic deformation occurs, a hard coating layer consisting of ceramics having smaller deformability than the base material cannot follow the deformation, cracks are caused in the coating layer, the cracks become larger due to cutting stress, and a workpiece material becomes deposited thereon to readily cause separation of the layer.
      <br/>
      The prior art has not discovered a sufficient solution for this problem caused by plastic deformation.
    </p>
    <p num="28">
      As hereinabove described, further, the thickness of the outer layer is small at about 2  MU m in the prior art, and hence the inner layer is readily exposed by wear of the outer layer.
      <br/>
      Thus, it has been difficult to suppress dimensional change of the workpiece caused by dimension change of the flank.
      <br/>
      Although the outer layer in the prior art is directed to a function of lubricity with respect to the workpiece such as steel, for example, particularly reactivity with steel on the cutting face, it has not aimed at improvement of wear resistance on the flank.
    </p>
    <p num="29">
      According to the present invention, on the other hand, plastic deformation of the base material during cutting can be suppressed as compared with the prior art, by employing Al2 O3 or ZrO2 which is excellent in heat insulation as the intermediate layer.
      <br/>
      Therefore, separation of the coating layers is hardly caused in a cutting tool comprising the inventive coated hard metal.
      <br/>
      Further, the same is excellent in wear resistance on the flank by making the film thickness of the outer layer of a Ti compound thicker than the inner layer and coating or applying the same in a layer thickness in excess of 5  MU m. According to the present invention, therefore, it is possible to provide a coated hard metal cutting tool which does not cause dimensional change of the workpiece due to wear or deformation of the tool, and which can suppress crater wear on the cutting face at the same time.
      <br/>
      These characteristics are achieved by the intermediate layer consisting essentially of Al2 O3, ZrO2 or a mixture thereof having a proper thickness, and the outer layer consisting essentially of a Ti compound which is thickly formed thereon.
    </p>
    <p num="30">
      In the coated hard metal of the present invention, the base material is cemented carbide or cermet, i.e., a hard metal consisting essentially of an iron family metal and carbides, nitrides and carbo-nitrides of the elements of the groups IVa, Va and VIa of the periodic table.
      <br/>
      Among the hard coated layers provided on this base material, the inner layer of a Ti compound acts as a layer bonding the base material with the intermediate layer of Al2 O3 or ZrO2, the intermediate layer of Al2 O3 or ZrO2 improves crater wear resistance and plastic deformation resistance on the cutting face, and the outer layer of a Ti compound which is coated more thickly than the inner layer contributes to improvement of wear resistance on the flank.
    </p>
    <p num="31">
      Therefore, a cutting tool comprising the coated hard metal of the present invention is excellent in wear resistance on the flank due to superior wear resistance of the Ti compound at temperatures of not more than 1000 (degree)  C., reduces undesired dimensional change of the workpiece, and lengthens the tool life.
      <br/>
      On the cutting face portion which is heated to a higher temperature than the flank portion during cutting, further, excellent crater wear resistance can be expected even if the outer layer of the Ti compound is worn, since the intermediate layer of Al2 O3 or ZrO2 is present under the same.
      <br/>
      For the tool, wear on the cutting face is not so problematic unless the base material is exposed, and wear of the outer layer of the Ti compound in an initial stage causes no significant obstacle.
      <br/>
      Consequently, the cutting tool according to the present invention can exhibit excellent wear resistance in wide-ranging cutting conditions from a low speed up to a high speed.
    </p>
    <p num="32">
      Among the hard coating layers, the inner layer which is formed on the base material consists essentially of at least one layer of a material selected from the group consisting of a carbide, a nitride, a carbo-nitride, a carbo-oxide, a carbo-nitrogen oxide and a boronitride of Ti.
      <br/>
      The reason why these Ti compounds are employed as the inner layer resides in that the same are excellent in adhesion to the hard metal which is the base material, and also excellent in adhesive property with Al2 O3 and ZrO2 being the intermediate layer.
      <br/>
      Further, its film thickness is preferably in the range of 0.1 to 5  MU m, and more preferably in the range of 0.5 to 3  MU m, since its effect is not attained if the thickness is less than 0.1  MU m in total, while the same is too thick as an adhesion layer if the thickness exceeds 5  MU m.
    </p>
    <p num="33">
      The intermediate layer which is formed on the inner layer is mainly composed of Al2 O3, ZrO2, or a mixture or a solid solution thereof.
      <br/>
      When the mixture is employed, either of both is contained in a large quantity as a main component.
      <br/>
      In case of an intermediate layer mainly composed of Al2 O3, another substance, such as ZrO2, HfO2, TiO2, TiC or TiN may be contained in a ratio of not more than 50%, or Ti, Zr or Cl or N may be solidly dissolved in the intermediate layer in a ratio of not more than 50%.
      <br/>
      Further, the intermediate layer mainly composed of Al2 O3 may be divided by another film, such as a thin film of a Ti compound such as TiC, TiCN, TiN, TiBN, TiCO or TiCNO, an Al compound such as AlN or AlNO, or an oxide such as ZrO2, HfO2 or TiO2, for example.
    </p>
    <p num="34">
      The intermediate layer mainly composed of Al2 O3 has a large effect of suppressing plastic deformation of the base material and improving crater wear resistance on the cutting face.
      <br/>
      In particular, an important effect is the suppression of film separation resulting from thermal deformation of the base material, which has been achieved by a heat insulation effect of this intermediate layer.
      <br/>
      However, the effect is small if its film thickness is less than 5  MU m while strength is reduced if the thickness exceeds 50  MU m, and hence the range of 5 to 50  MU m is preferable, and more preferable is the range of 10 to 40  MU m.
    </p>
    <p num="35">
      On the other hand, ZrO2 has previously not been put into practice since the same is low in hardness and low in wear resistance, while its heat conductivity is extremely small as compared with Al2 O3.
      <br/>
      Al2 O3 has heat conductivity of 0.054 cal/cm * sec *  (degree)  C. and ZrO2 has heat conductivity of 0.005 cal/cm * sec *  (degree)  C. at 20 (degree)  C., while Al2 O3 has heat conductivity of 0.015 cal/cm * sec *  (degree)  C. and ZrO2 has heat conductivity of 0.005 cal/cm * sec *  (degree)  C. at 1000 (degree)  C. Therefore, ZrO2 is excellent in effect of suppressing plastic deformation of the base material, and a heat insulation effect substantially identical to that of Al2 O3 is attained in a layer which is thinner than Al2 O3.
    </p>
    <p num="36">
      Based on such recognition, a tool prepared by providing an intermediate layer of ZrO2 on the thin inner layer of a Ti compound which was formed on a base material, and coating a thick outer layer of a Ti compound thereon was produced as a test sample, and a high-speed cutting test was executed.
      <br/>
      Consequently, it has been recognized that the tool having the coating structure of the present invention is superior in plastic deformation and superior in wear resistance on the flank as compared with a tool having the conventional coating structure.
    </p>
    <p num="37">It has been proved that undesired dimensional change of a workpiece is hardly caused and crater wear on the cutting face can also be suppressed at the same time when cutting is performed by employing the tool according to the present invention.</p>
    <p num="38">
      Further, it has also been proved, even in comparison to the case of employing Al2 O3 for the intermediate layer, that the ZrO2 intermediate layer cannot only attain excellent plastic deformation resistance with a thinner film but the film thickness can be reduced, whereby smoothness of the coating surface is improved and separation resistance is improved.
      <br/>
      To the inventor's surprise, further, an unexpected effect has been attained whereby boundary wear, which ordinarily comes into question in cutting of a readily work-hardened workpiece such as stainless steel, is reduced and chipping resistance is improved.
      <br/>
      Although the reason therefor is not clear, this is conceivably because the Young's modulus of ZrO2 is small and its hardness is low and hence its deformability is large.
    </p>
    <p num="39">
      In case of employing the intermediate layer mainly composed of ZrO2, another oxide such as Al2 O3, HfO2 or TiO2, for example, TiC or TiN may be contained in a ratio of not more than 50%, or Al, Ti, Cl or N may be solidly dissolved in the intermediate layer in a ratio of not more than 50%.
      <br/>
      Further, the intermediate layer mainly composed of ZrO2 may be divided by another film, such as a thin film of a Ti compound such as TiC, TiCN, TiN, TiBN, TiCO or TiCNO, a Zr compound such as ZrN or ZrC, or an oxide such as Al2 O3, HfO2 or TiO2, for example.
      <br/>
      The intermediate layer mainly composed of ZrO2 has a large effect of suppressing plastic deformation of the base material and improving crater wear resistance on the cutting face.
      <br/>
      In particular, an important effect has been achieved, whereby suppression of film separation resulting from deformation of the base material has been enabled by this intermediate layer.
      <br/>
      However, the effect is small if its film thickness is less than 0.5  MU m while strength is reduced if the thickness exceeds 20  MU m, and hence the range of 0.5 to 20  MU m is preferable, and more preferable is the range of 3 to 15  MU m.
    </p>
    <p num="40">
      The outer layer which is formed on the intermediate layer consists essentially of at least one layer of a material selected from the group consisting of a carbide, a nitride, a carbo-nitride, a carbo-oxide, a carbonitrogen oxide and a boronitride of Ti, and effectively improves wear resistance on the flank.
      <br/>
      The reason why the film thickness of the outer layer is set to be at least 5  MU m is now described.
      <br/>
      When the inventors collected used tools in a steel part machining line of a car manufacturer and investigated damaged states of the tools, they confirmed that almost all the tools exhibited flank wear of at least 0.05  MU mm. A cutting tool is used at a clearance angle  THETA  of 5 to 6 (degree)  as shown in FIG. 2A, and hence the abrasion wear VB of 0.05 mm corresponds to a film thickness of about 5  MU m (0.05 mm * tan 6 (degree) ) that is worn at the maximum, as shown in FIG. 2B. Therefore, the lower layer or the base material which is inferior in wear resistance will be exposed and the tool will tend to have a short life unless a film of at least 5  MU m thickness which is excellent in wear resistance is provided on the tool surface.
      <br/>
      Therefore, it is necessary to employ a Ti compound film exhibiting excellent wear resistance at cutting speeds of 100 m/min. to 500 m/min. as the outer layer and to coat the same in excess of 5  MU m thickness.
      <br/>
      However, strength is reduced if 100  MU m thickness is exceeded, and hence the film thickness is preferably in the range of 5 to 100  MU m. In such a cutting condition that the cutting speed exceeds 300 m/min., a film thickness of at least 10  MU m is particularly preferable, and the range of 15 to 50  MU m is more preferable.
    </p>
    <p num="41">
      In case of employing the intermediate layer mainly composed of Al2 O3, the total of the film thicknesses of the hard coating layers is preferably in the range of 25 to 60  MU m. in this range, it is possible to more effectively protect the base material, and to attain further excellent chipping resistance.
      <br/>
      In case of the intermediate layer mainly composed of ZrO2, on the other hand, the total of the film thicknesses of the hard coating layers is preferably in the range of 20 to 60  MU m. In this range, the base material is more effectively protected, and more excellent chipping resistance is attained.
    </p>
    <p num="42">
      It has been proved that, in case of directly coating a Ti compound on the intermediate layer of Al2 O3, it is difficult to make the film thickness of the outer Ti compound larger since adhesion between both is low.
      <br/>
      In the present invention, it is preferable to further provide a thin film between the intermediate layer of Al2 O3 and the outer layer.
      <br/>
      This film is formed in direct contact with the intermediate layer, and a film thickness of 0.1 to 2  MU m is preferable.
      <br/>
      This thin film can be an Al-containing thin film consisting essentially of a material which is selected from the group consisting of a nitride and an oxy-nitride of Al.
      <br/>
      In case of employing such an Al-containing thin film, it is more preferable that the nitrogen content in the thin film is reduced as the film approaches the intermediate layer, and the oxygen content is increased as the film approaches the intermediate layer.
      <br/>
      This thin film improves the adhesion between the Al2 O3 intermediate layer and the outer layer of the Ti compound.
      <br/>
      Due to this thin film, separation between the layers hardly takes place, and excellent wear resistance is attained.
      <br/>
      In particular, the adhesion between the intermediate layer and the outer layer is further increased by continuously changing the composition of the thin film between Al2 O3 and AlN or AlON as described above, so that separation is even less likely to take place.
    </p>
    <p num="43">
      In case of the intermediate layer mainly composed of ZrO2 on the other hand, it is preferable to further form a Zr-containing thin film consisting essentially of a material which is selected from the group consisting of a carbide, a nitride, a carbo-nitride, a carbo-oxide, an oxy-nitride and a carbonitrogen oxide of Zr between the intermediate layer and the outer layer.
      <br/>
      The thickness of this thin film is preferably 0.1 to 2  MU m. Due to this thin film, adhesion between the intermediate layer and the outer layer is increased, and a thicker outer layer can be formed.
      <br/>
      Due to excellent adhesion, further, separation between the layers hardly takes place, and excellent wear resistance can be attained.
      <br/>
      Also in this Zr-containing film, it is preferable that the nitrogen content and/or the carbon content is reduced as the film approaches the intermediate layer and the oxygen content is increased as the film approaches the intermediate layer.
      <br/>
      Thus, more excellent adhesion is attained and separation of the layers can be more effectively suppressed, by continuously changing the composition between ZrO2 and the Zr compound.

      On the other hand, a thin film consisting essentially of a material which is selected from the group consisting of TiBN, TiCO and TiCNO can be employed in place of the Al- or Zr-containing layer, in order to improve adhesion between the intermediate layer and the outer layer.
      <br/>

      The thin film 16 can be a thin film of TiBNO, TiNO, or TiO2.

    <p num="48">
      Further, it has been proved that chipping resistance is improved when the outer layer is mainly composed of columnar crystals, and hence this is preferable.
      <br/>
      When hard coating layers are deposited on the base material by chemical vapor deposition or the like, tensile residual stress is caused on the coating layers due to the difference between the thermal expansion coefficients of the base material and the coating layers and hence chipping resistance of the tool is generally reduced.
      <br/>
      However, it has been presumed that, when the outer layer 4 is mainly composed of columnar crystals 5 as shown in FIG. 7, tensile residual stress is readily released in that cracks 6 are caused in grain boundaries of the columnar crystals 5, which thereby avoids the formation of large cracks or chipping reaching the other deeper layers and thus affecting the tool life.
    </p>
    <p num="49">Therefore, it is possible to increase the film thickness of the outer layer 4 by making the outer layer 4 of the columnar crystals 5 in the inventive coated hard metal, providing an inner layer 2 of a Ti compound on a base material 1, providing the intermediate layer 3 mainly composed of Al2 O3 or ZrO2 thereon, and providing the outer layer 4 of a Ti compound further thereon as shown in FIG. 7, so that further excellent wear resistance can be exhibited over a long period.</p>
    <p num="50">
      When the aspect ratio of the columnar crystals 5 is in the range of 5 to 80, improvement of wear resistance and chipping resistance is particularly remarkable.
      <br/>
      Here, the aspect ratio is the ratio 1/d of the length 1 of the columnar crystals 5 to the crystal grain diameter d, as shown in FIG. 7.
      <br/>
      Its measurement was performed by photographing a section of the hard coating layer by TEM, and obtaining an average value of three arbitrary visual fields.
    </p>
    <p num="51">
      Particularly when the outer layer consists essentially of TiCN in the form of columnar crystals, wear resistance on the flank and chipping resistance are more excellent.
      <br/>
      Above all, particularly excellent wear resistance is attained when the C:N molar ratio of the TiCN is in the range of 5:5 to 7:3.
      <br/>
      This is because hardness and toughness of the coating layer is well-balanced to exhibit excellent wear resistance and chipping resistance when the C:N ratio of TiCN is in this range.
      <br/>
      The molar C:N ratio can be measured by obtaining the lattice constant of the TiCN outer layer by analysis through ESCA (ELECTRON SPECTROSCOPY FOR CHEMICAL ANALYSIS) or EPMA (ELECTRON PROBE MICRO ANALYSIS), or X-ray analysis.
    </p>
    <p num="52">
      According to a result obtained by the inventors through X-ray analysis, the lattice constant of TiCN having a molar C:N ratio within the range of 5:5 to 7:3 was in the range of 4.275 to 4.295, and particularly excellent wear resistance and chipping resistance were exhibited at this time.
      <br/>
      While this result includes deviation in consideration of or in comparison to TiCN of a stoichiometric composition, it seems that such deviation has been caused since the particular TiCN may have a nonstoichiometric composition such as Ti(CN)0.9, for example.
      <br/>
      Further, TiCN of the outer layer preferably has maximum peak strength of X-ray diffraction, as to a crystal plane selected from the group consisting of (111), (422) and (311).
      <br/>
      A TiCN film of the outer layer exhibiting such characteristics is excellent in adhesion with the lower layer.
    </p>
    <p num="53">
      Among the hard coating layers, the thickest layer which is included in the inner layer preferably consists essentially of a layer mainly composed of columnar crystals having an aspect ratio in the range of 5 to 30.
      <br/>
      Such an inner layer can have high strength.
      <br/>
      When the aspect ratio is set in this range in case of thickening the inner layer, strength reduction of the inner layer can be suppressed.
    </p>
    <p num="54">
      On the other hand, the intermediate layer preferably includes a layer mainly composed of columnar crystals having an aspect ratio in the range of 3 to 20.
      <br/>
      The strength and toughness of the intermediate layer do not depend on the grain size alone, but also depend on the aspect ratio of the crystal grains.
      <br/>
      The inventors have discovered that the strength and toughness can be improved by making the aspect ratio of the crystal grains in the intermediate layer fall within the range of 3 to 20.
      <br/>
      Further, the inventors have discovered that the degree of bulking of the crystal grains is small and the aspect ratio of the crystal grains can be increased even if the film of Al2 O3 or ZrO2 is thickened.
      <br/>
      Also, it has been proved that a film which is excellent in strength and toughness can rather be obtained by thickening the film.
    </p>
    <p num="55">
      It is more preferable that the Al2 O3 of the intermediate layer is mainly composed of  ALPHA -Al2 O3.
      <br/>
      A crystal grain having an aspect ratio in the range of 3 to 20 can be readily formed by making the crystal system of Al2 O3 an a type, and a film which is excellent in strength and toughness can be obtained.
      <br/>
      Further, the  ALPHA -Al2 O3 film preferably has the maximum peak strength of X-ray diffraction as to a crystal plane which is selected from the group consisting of (104) and (116).
      <br/>
      Thus, adhesion between the outer layer and the Al2 O3 film can he improved.
    </p>
    <p num="56">
      On the other hand, the crystal system of Al2 O3 in the intermediate layer can be mainly composed of  KAPPA -Al2 O3, in and near a portion thereof, which is in contact with the inner layer and in and near a portion thereof which is in contact with the outer layer.
      <br/>
      The adhesion between the inner and outer layers and the intermediate layer can be improved by providing  KAPPA -Al2 O3 in the portions which are in contact with the outer layer and the inner layer respectively.
      <br/>
      Further, an intermediate layer which is excellent in strength and toughness and excellent in adhesion can be obtained by forming an intermediate layer having  ALPHA -Al2 O3 portions between  KAPPA -Al2 O3 portions.
    </p>
    <p num="57">
      The inventors have discovered that particularly excellent separation resistance and chipping resistance can be provided by controlling the distances between cracks which are formed on the hard coating layers at proper values.
      <br/>
      Namely, the average of the distances between adjacent cracks is preferably 20 to 40  MU m, in relation to a plurality of cracks which are formed on the hard coating layers.
      <br/>
      Further, the distances between cracks in the inner layer and in the outer layer are preferably smaller than those between cracks in the intermediate layer.
      <br/>
      Excellent chipping resistance and wear resistance can be attained by thus controlling the distribution state of the cracks.
      <br/>
      Particularly in a coating having a thickness of at least 25  MU m, the effect of controlling the distances between the cracks in this range is remarkable.
      <br/>
      Due to such control of the distances between the cracks, it has now been made possible to employ a coated hard metal having thicker films that were previously generally regarded as unemployable.

    <p num="58">
      The inner layer, the intermediate layer and the outer layer according to the present invention can be formed by ordinary chemical vapor deposition or physical vapor deposition.
      <br/>
      In case of forming the outer layer of TiCN on the intermediate layer of Al2 O3 or ZrO2 by chemical vapor deposition, TiCN can be coated at a temperature of 700 to 1100 (degree)  C. with a pressure of not more than 500 Torr while employing TiCl4 as a raw material gas to provide a source of Ti, an organic carbo-nitride as a carbon and nitrogen source, and hydrogen gas as a carrier gas.
      <br/>
      According to such a step, homogeneous and fine nucleation of TiCN is performed on Al2 O3 or ZrO2, whereby a hard coating layer can be obtained which is excellent in adhesion with the intermediate layer, hardly causes interlayer separation, and exhibits excellent wear resistance.
    </p>
    <p num="59">When an organic carbo-nitride such as CH3 CN, for example, is employed as a carbon and nitrogen source in the aforementioned method, in particular, the crystal grains of the TiCN outer layer can be readily brought into the state of columnar crystals, it is easy to increase the aspect ratio of the columnar crystals, and the TiCN outer layer having a molar C:N ratio within the range of 5:5 to 7:3 can be readily formed.</p>
    <p num="60">
      In the coated hard metal of the present invention, further, a film of an oxide which is selected from the group consisting of Al2 O3, ZrO2 and HfO2 can be coated on the outer layer in a thickness of 0.5 to 5  MU m in total.
      <br/>
      Boundary wear and deterioration of the Ti compound film in portions other than a worn portion can be prevented by covering the outer layer with such a film.
      <br/>
      Particularly an effect of suppressing boundary wear was remarkable in cutting of a generally uncuttable material such as stainless steel.
      <br/>
      The effect is small if the thickness of this film is smaller than 0.5  MU m, and wear resistance on the flank is reduced if the same is larger than 5  MU m. In particular, the range of the thickness is preferably 1 to 3  MU m. Further, this film is preferably thinner than the intermediate layer.
      <br/>
      A thin film of TiN or ZrN exhibiting a golden color may be coated on the outermost surface of the coated hard metal of the present invention.

      <br/>
      In the cutting edge of a cutting tool which is formed by the coated hard metal of the present invention, it is more preferable that parts of the hard coating layers are removed, and a surface whose average value of surface roughness Ra is not more than 0.05  MU m is formed.

      From comparison of the samples 1 and 6, it is understood that the improved effect is small if the film thickness of the Al2 O3 intermediate layer is 2  MU m, while it is understood by comparison of the samples 1 and 7 that Al2 O3 is superior in wear resistance when the same is employed as an intermediate layer rather than being coated as an outer layer.
      <br/>
      By comparison of the samples 1 and 8, it is understood that the Ti compound is superior in wear resistance to Al2 O3 as an outer layer.

      From the above results, it is understood that the tips of the samples 1' to 4' of inventive Example exhibit excellent cutting performance not only in high-speed cutting (cutting condition 1) but also in low-speed cutting (cutting condition 2).

      <br/>
      From comparison of the samples 1' and 6', it is understood that the improved effect is small if the film thickness of the ZrO2 intermediate layer is 0.3  MU m, while it is understood from comparison of the samples 1' and 7' that ZrO2 is superior in wear resistance when the same is employed as an intermediate layer rather than being coated as an outer layer.
