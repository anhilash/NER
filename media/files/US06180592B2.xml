      A hydrophobic and particulate soil removal composition is provided.
      <br/>
      The composition can be used for removing organic hydrophobic soils, such as oily or greasy soils, from a laundry item and/or from a hard surface such as an engine part and/or from skin.
      <br/>
      The composition can be used in a liquid or solid form and can be applied to individual laundry items in the form of a solid stick or liquid spray prior to introduction to the laundry machine.
      <br/>
      Laundry items can also be contacted in the laundry machine with the pre-spot or pre-treatment composition in the form of an aqueous presoak, preflush, prewash, or other step prior to the cleaning step.
      <br/>
      The treatment composition can be used as a recirculating liquid stream or bath for the cleaning of hard surfaces.

    <heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="1">
      The invention relates to a hydrophobic and particulate soil removal composition and method for removal of hydrophobic and particulate soil from an article.
      <br/>
      Stubborn hydrophobic greasy or oily soils, including associated organic particulate soils, such as finely divided elemental carbon, are frequently encountered on fabrics including textiles and on hard surfaces including engine parts.
      <br/>
      The composition is selected to provide enhanced soil removal, preferably in institutional laundry applications and in industrial parts cleaning applications.
    </p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">
      Detergent pre-treatment or pre-spotting compositions, solids or sticks are known in the art and are known to commonly use solvent materials and typically nonionic surfactants.
      <br/>
      For example, see DiSalvo, U.S. Pat. No. 3,417,023; Kelly, et al., U.S. Pat. No. 3,664,962; Steinhauer et. al., U.S. Pat. No. 4,289,644; and Sabol, Jr. et al., U.S. Pat. No. 4,842,762. These patents describe pre-treatment or pre-spotting compositions containing a small amount of water and a substantial proportion of solvent, nonionic surfactant and a solidification or gelling agent.
      <br/>
      Wilsberg, et al., U.S. Pat. No. 4,877,556, and Clark, U.S. Pat. No. 4,909,962 describe compositions which include hydrocarbon solvent.
      <br/>
      Borrello, U.S. Pat. No. 4,396,521 teaches liquid aqueous pre-spot or pre-treatment compositions containing about 35 wt % water and substantial water soluble solvent compositions to create a use solution.
      <br/>
      Such aqueous and solvent based materials are typically less effective on oily hydrophobic soils due to the nature of the soil and its hydrophobicity with respect to the aqueous formulated materials.
      <br/>
      A solvent based laundry pre-treatment stick is disclosed in Steinhauer et al., U.S. Pat. No. 4,289,644, and includes a minor amount of water but relatively large percent of immiscible solvent in separate but combined phases.
      <br/>
      Klier et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,538,662 and Yang, U.S. Pat. No. 3,635,829, describe pre-spot or pre-treatment compositions.
      <br/>
      One liquid detergent composition having a specialized phosphate ester solubilizer is disclosed in Klajnscek, U.S. Pat. No. 4,836,949. The patent discloses preferred formulations for use in a liquid stabilized laundry detergent.
    </p>
    <p num="3">
      While these prior art pre-spot or pre-treatment compositions have some utility in pre-spotting common household laundry, commercial laundry having large quantities of hydrophobic soils, particularly oily or greasy soils containing substantial quantities of particulate matter, can resist conventional pre-spotting pre-treatments and also resist the effects of conventional laundry detergents even in industrial or commercial laundry machines such as commercial 450 pound wash wheels or tunnel washers.
      <br/>
      A substantial need exists for improved pre-spotting or pre-treating laundry compositions.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      The invention relates to a parts cleaning composition and can promote the removal of hydrophobic and particulate soil from parts or hard surfaces, particularly those parts encountered in the engine cleaning industry.
      <br/>
      Parts cleaning compositions commonly used include hydrocarbon solvent.
      <br/>
      These types of compositions generally provide a high level of volatile organic compounds, are flammable and corrosive, and are tough on a worker's hands.
    </p>
    <heading>BRIEF DISCUSSION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="5">
      A hydrophobic and particulate soil removal composition is provided by the invention.
      <br/>
      The hydrophobic and particulate soil removal composition includes an effective soil treating amount of an ethoxylate component and an effective soil treating amount of a fatty acid ester component.
      <br/>
      The ethoxylate component has the formula:
      <br/>
      R1 --(OC2 H4)m --OH
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      wherein R1 contains about 6 to about 26 carbon atoms and m is about 2 or less.
      <br/>
      Preferably, R1 is an alkyl group containing from about 10 to about 16 carbon atoms or an aralkyl group containing from about 14 to about 20 carbon atoms, and m is between about 1 and about 2.
      <br/>
      The ethoxylate component is preferably an alcohol ethoxylate or an alkyl phenol ethoxylate.
      <br/>
      The fatty acid ester component has the formula:
      <br/>
      R3 --CO2 --R4
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      wherein R3 is an alkyl group having about 6 to about 24 carbon atoms and R4 is an alkyl group having about 1 to about 6 carbon atoms.
      <br/>
      Preferably, R3 is an alkyl group containing from about 14 to about 20 carbon atoms, and R4 is an alkyl group containing from about 1 to about 3 carbon atoms.
      <br/>
      The soil removal composition is preferably substantially free of hydrocarbon solvent.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      The weight ratio of ethoxylate component to fatty acid ester component is preferably between about 1:4 and about 4:1, and more preferably between about 3:1 and about 1:3.
      <br/>
      It should be appreciated that the ethoxylate component can include mixtures of different ethoxylates, and the fatty acid ester component can include mixtures of different fatty acid esters.
      <br/>
      In addition, the soil removal composition can include a processing aid for providing freeze stability, and other components which are conventional in the detergent industry.
      <br/>
      The concentration of ethoxylate component and fatty acid ester component in the soil removal composition depends on the desired use of the composition.
      <br/>
      When applied as a pre-treatment or pre-spotting composition, the composition can be relatively concentrated and may be provided in the form of a solid or stick.
      <br/>
      In addition, the composition can be provided as a fluid which will flow through a dispenser.
      <br/>
      When used as a hard surface cleaning composition, the use concentration of ethoxylate component and fatty acid ester component is preferably relatively dilute.
      <br/>
      Of course, the composition can be provided as a concentrate, and then diluted to provide the use concentration.
      <br/>
      When used to wash skin, such as hands, the composition can be provided in the form of a solid bar, a viscous gel, or a flowable fluid which can be dispensed through a liquid dispenser.
      <br/>
      The soil removal composition can then be rubbed on the skin and wiped away or washed off.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      A method for removing hydrophobic and particulate soil from an article is provided by the invention.
      <br/>
      The method includes the step of contacting a soiled article with a hydrophobic and particulate soil removal composition.
      <br/>
      The hydrophobic and particulate soil removal composition is allowed to penetrate into the soil in order to break apart the soil.
      <br/>
      The soil removal composition of the invention is particularly suited for breaking apart caked soil.
      <br/>
      Caked soil can generally be characterized as having an average thickness of between about 0.1 mm and about 10 mm.
      <br/>
      The soil can be removed from textiles, including natural and synthetic fiber-containing textiles, hard surfaces such as those encountered in the automotive industry, and skin.
      <br/>
      In the case of using the soil removal composition of the invention to remove soil from textiles, the composition is preferably used as a pre-treatment composition which is then followed by a wash treatment with a detergent composition such as a conventional detergent composition.
      <br/>
      Preferably, the textiles are treated with the pre-treatment composition for a length of time sufficient to break up the soil.
      <br/>
      The pre-treatment composition is then preferably allowed to drain from the textiles prior to treatment of the textiles with a detergent composition.
      <br/>
      When the soil removal composition of the invention is used to remove soil from hard surfaces, it is preferably used as a relatively dilute fluid such as a recirculation fluid.
      <br/>
      That is, it can be diluted with water and then recirculated over a hard surface to remove the soil from the hard surface.
      <br/>
      In the case of treating skin, the soil removal composition can be rubbed onto the skin and washed off with water or wiped off.
    </p>
    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="10">
      The invention relates to a hydrophobic and particulate soil removal composition, and to a method for removing hydrophobic and particulate soil from an article.
      <br/>
      It should be understood that hydrophobic and particulate soils refer to oily or greasy soils containing particulate matter.
      <br/>
      In general, this type of soil can often be characterized by a caked appearance.
      <br/>
      Exemplary hydrophobic soils include hydrocarbons, tars, bitumens, asphalts, etc.
      <br/>
      Exemplary particulates which can be found in the hydrophobic soil include mineral clays, sand, dirt, clays, natural mineral matter, carbon black, graphite, graphitic materials, caolin, environmental dust, etc.
      <br/>
      In general, soils which are of particular concern include clean and dirty motor oils, asphaltenes, hydrocarbon, and coal tars, petroleum greases, fatty body soils, transmission fluids, hydraulic oils and greases, and the like.
      <br/>
      These soils are typical of the soils often found in truck or auto repair shops, gasoline and/or filling stations, industrial maintenance shops, petroleum refining and processing plants, machine repair shops, and food preparation facilities, and are fairly resistant to removal by washing with conventional detergents.
      <br/>
      Exemplary articles which can be subjected to cleaning for the removal of these soils include worker's clothing, machine parts, grill parts, and oil pans.
      <br/>
      The soil found on these articles is often characterized by a caked on appearance.
      <br/>
      In addition, animal skin, such as human skin, is often contaminated with these soils, and is difficult to clean with convention detergents.
    </p>
    <p num="11">
      The hydrophobic and particulate soil removal composition can be referred to more simply as the soil removal composition.
      <br/>
      It should be appreciated that there is no requirement that the soil which is to be removed contain a certain level of particulate matter.
      <br/>
      Rather, the soil can contain essentially no particulate matter.
      <br/>
      It is expected that the hydrophobic soil encountered in the environments identified above will typically contain particulates.
      <br/>
      In addition, it is understood that the particulate matter is generally considered at least partly responsible for providing "caked soil" for which the composition of the invention is particularly suited for removing or breaking apart.
      <br/>
      Caked soil can generally be characterized as having a thickness of between about 0.1 mm and about 10 mm.
      <br/>
      In general, caked soil will exhibit an average thickness of greater than about 0.25 mm. Most common caked soils have an average thickness of about 1 mm.
      <br/>
      In addition, caked soils generally exhibit a viscosity of greater than about 1,000 cps.
    </p>
    <p num="12">
      The soil removal composition includes an effective soil treating amount of ethoxylate component, and an effective soil treating amount of fatty acid ester component.
      <br/>
      Applicants found that the combination of the ethoxylate component and the fatty acid ester component provides enhanced hydrophobic and particulate soil removal properties compared with use of either ethoxylate component or fatty acid ester component, individually.
      <br/>
      In addition, the soil removal composition preferably includes a processing aid to provide the composition with freeze stability.
    </p>
    <p num="13">
      The ethoxylate component includes an ethoxylate or a mixture of ethoxylates.
      <br/>
      The ethoxylate component is preferably a nonionic ethoxylate.
      <br/>
      Preferred ethoxylates which can be used according to the present invention preferably have the formula:
      <br/>
      R1 --(OC2 H4)m --OH
    </p>
    <p num="14">
      wherein R1 contains from about 6 to about 26 carbon atoms, and m is about 2 or less.
      <br/>
      R1 can be a group which is considered branched or unbranched, saturated or unsaturated, substituted or unsubstituted, aliphatic or aromatic or aliphatic and aromatic.
      <br/>
      R1 is preferably an alkyl group containing from about 10 to about 16 carbon atoms or an aralkyl group containing from about 14 to about 20 carbon atoms, and m is preferably from about 1 to about 2.
      <br/>
      It should be appreciated m reflects an average value, and a particularly preferred alcohol ethoxylate has an m value of about 1.3. Preferred ethoxylates include alkyl phenol ethoxylates and alcohol ethoxylates.
      <br/>
      The alkyl phenol ethoxylate preferably has the formula:
      <br/>
      Ar--(OC2 H4)M --OH; wherein Ar is:
    </p>
    <p num="15">(Chemical Structure image '1' not included in text)</p>
    <p num="16">
      wherein R' is a straight or branched alkyl group of about 1 to 9 carbon atoms.
      <br/>
      The Ar group can include two or more R' groups.
      <br/>
      The alcohol ethoxylate which can be used in the present invention has the formula:
      <br/>
      R2 --(OC2 H4)m --OH *
    </p>
    <p num="17">wherein R2 is a straight or branched fatty alkyl group containing from about 6 to 24 carbon atoms, preferably about 10 to 18 carbon atoms and most preferably about 12 to 18 carbon atoms, m is an integer of less than about 2.</p>
    <p num="18">
      The fatty acid ester component includes a fatty acid ester or a mixture of fatty acid esters which, when combined with the ethoxylate, provides penetration into hydrophobic and particulate soil.

      Soil penetration tests were performed using commercially purchased automotive oil pans containing heavy dirty motor oil/grease soilings (3-10 mm thick).
      <br/>
      The pans were cut into 2" * 4" coupons and subjected to soil modification by measuring compositional droplet wick times into the soil layer (0.1 ml of the aqueous test solution per cm2); with complete absorption-time being visually determined.
      <br/>
      The test solutions were prepared by mixing 0.5 wt % of each composition with 0.5 wt % sodium meta silicate/EDTA (builder) and the remainder water.

      Table 1 demonstrates the usefulness of the present invention as a hydrophobic/particulate soil penetrant and modifying agent for enhancing hard surface cleaning processes and as a soil modifier for subsequent chemical cleaning steps from textiles and hard surfaces.
      <br/>
      Attention is directed to the results presented in column 3 of Table 1 comparing soil modification penetration rates for compositions 1-10 where compositions 1-5 are prior art compositions.
      <br/>
      The data demonstrates the ability of the invention to impart a modification to the soil by penetrating the soil cake at an appreciably faster relative rate compared with the control (ILF- 15 is a dirty motor oil pre-treatment product with &gt;2-EO nonionic blends and mineral spirits), and substantially better than other prior art compositions.
      <br/>
      It is noticed in the experiments (examples 2-5) that nonionics with &gt;2-EO nonionics have substantially reduced soil modification rates, relative to the control, while the compositions of the invention provide yields up to a 50% improvement in soil penetration over even the high performing commercial control detergent, i.e., the novel use of an ethoxylated nonionic with less than 2-ethoxylate units along with a fatty ester as a soil modifier.
      <br/>
      The ethoxylate is an alcohol ethoxylate wherein the alkyl group has between about 12 and about 14 carbon atoms and the degree of polymerization is about 1.
    </p>
    <p num="42">
      The lack of emulsification capacity (normally employed as evidencing detersive effectiveness) of the compositions of the invention compared with the prior art is shown in column 4 of Table 1.
      <br/>
      In contrast to the prior art, the compositions of the invention are very poor emulsifiers and this mode of soil removal is minimized versus conventional emulsification mechanisms.
      <br/>
      Subsequent examples show that emulsification surfactants tend to impart a negative effect on soil removal according to the invention.
    </p>
    <p num="43">The data also demonstrates that soil modification for the tested soil is improved using a weight ratio of the &lt;2-mole ethoxylate nonionic-to-alkyl alkylate component (wt:wt) of between 4:0 and 0:4, with a preferred ratio of between 3:1 and 1:3, and a most preferred ratio of about 1:1.</p>
    <p num="44">
      This example demonstrates the effectiveness of the soil removal composition of the invention for removing caked on soil.
      <br/>
      It is believed that the effectiveness of the soil removal composition will be observed for caked on soil present on hard surfaces as well as textiles.
