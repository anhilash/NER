    <heading>TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
    <p num="1">
      This invention relates, in general, to tissue paper products.
      <br/>
      More specifically, it relates to tissue paper products containing surface-deposited chemical softening agents.
    </p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">
      Sanitary paper tissue products are widely used.
      <br/>
      Such items are commercially offered in formats tailored for a variety of uses such as facial tissues, toilet tissues and absorbent towels.
    </p>
    <p num="3">
      All of these sanitary products share a common need, specifically to be soft to the touch.
      <br/>
      Softness is a complex tactile impression evoked by a product when it is stroked against the skin.
      <br/>
      The purpose of being soft is so that these products can be used to cleanse the skin without being irritating.
      <br/>
      Effectively cleansing the skin is a persistent personal hygiene problem for many people.
      <br/>
      Objectionable discharges of urine, menses, and fecal matter from the perineal area or otorhinolaryngogical mucus discharges do not always occur at a time convenient for one to perform a thorough cleansing, as with soap and copious amounts of water for example.
      <br/>
      As a substitute for thorough cleansing, a wide variety of tissue and toweling products are offered to aid in the task of removing from the skin and retaining such discharges for disposal in a sanitary fashion.
      <br/>
      Not surprisingly, the use of these products does not approach the level of cleanliness that can be achieved by more thorough cleansing methods, and producers of tissue and toweling products are constantly striving to make their products compete more favorably with thorough cleansing methods.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      Shortcomings in tissue products for example cause many to stop cleaning before the skin is completely cleansed.
      <br/>
      Such behavior is prompted by the harshness of the tissue, as continued rubbing with a harsh implement can abrade the sensitive skin and cause severe pain.
      <br/>
      The alternative, leaving the skin partially cleansed, is chosen even though this often causes malodors to emanate and can cause staining of undergarments, and over time can cause skin irritations as well.
    </p>
    <p num="5">Disorders of the anus, for example hemorrhoids, render the perineal area extremely sensitive and cause those who suffer such disorders to be particularly frustrated by the need to clean their anus without prompting irritation.</p>
    <p num="6">
      Another notable case which prompts frustration is the repeated nose blowing necessary when one has a cold.
      <br/>
      Repeated cycles of blowing and wiping can culminate in a sore nose even when the softest tissues available today are employed.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      Accordingly, making soft tissue and toweling products which promote comfortable cleaning without performance impairing sacrifices has long been the goal of the engineers and scientists who are devoted to research into improving tissue paper.
      <br/>
      There have been numerous attempts to reduce the abrasive effect, i.e., improve the softness of tissue products.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      One area that has been exploited in this regard has been to select and modify cellulose fiber morphologies and engineer paper structures to take optimum advantages of the various available morphologies.
      <br/>
      Applicable art in this area includes: Vinson et. al. in U.S. Pat. No. 5,228,954, issued Jul. 20, 1993, Vinson in U.S. Pat. No. 5,405,499, issued Apr. 11, 1995, Cochrane et al. in U.S. Pat. No. 4,874,465 issued Oct. 17, 1989, and Hermans, et. al. in U.S. Statutory Invention Registration H1672, published on Aug. 5, 1997, all of which disclose methods for selecting or upgrading fiber sources to tissue and toweling of superior properties.
      <br/>
      Applicable art is further illustrated by Carstens in U.S. Pat. No. 4,300,981, issued Nov. 17, 1981, which discusses how fibers can be incorporated to be compliant to paper structures so that they have maximum softness potential.
      <br/>
      While such techniques as illustrated by these prior art examples are recognized broadly, they can only offer some limited potential to make tissues truly effective comfortable cleaning implements.
    </p>
    <p num="9">Another area which has received a considerable amount of attention is the addition of chemical softening agents (also referred to herein as "chemical softeners") to tissue and toweling products.</p>
    <p num="10">
      As used herein, the term "chemical softening agent" refers to any chemical ingredient which improves the tactile sensation perceived by the consumer who holds a particular paper product and rubs it across the skin.
      <br/>
      Although somewhat desirable for towel products, softness is a particularly important property for facial and toilet tissues.
      <br/>
      Such tactile perceivable softness can be characterized by, but is not limited to, friction, flexibility, and smoothness, as well as subjective descriptors, such as a feeling like lubricious, velvet, silk or flannel which imparts a lubricious feel to tissue.
      <br/>
      This includes, for exemplary purposes only, basic waxes such as paraffin and beeswax and oils such as mineral oil and silicone oil as well as petrolatum and more complex lubricants and emollients such as quaternary ammonium compounds with long alkyl chains, functional silicones, fatty acids, fatty alcohols and fatty esters.
    </p>
    <p num="11">
      The field of work in the prior art pertaining to chemical softeners has taken two paths.
      <br/>
      The first path is characterized by the addition of softeners to the tissue paper web during its formation either by adding an attractive ingredient to the vats of pulp which will ultimately be formed into a tissue paper web, to the pulp slurry as it approaches a paper making machine, or to the wet web as it resides on a Fourdrinier cloth or dryer cloth on a paper making machine.
    </p>
    <p num="12">
      The second path is categorized by the addition of chemical softeners to tissue paper web after the web is dried.
      <br/>
      Applicable processes can be incorporated into the paper making operation as, for example, by spraying onto the dry web before it is wound into a roll of paper.
    </p>
    <p num="13">
      Exemplary art related to the former path categorized by adding chemical softeners to the tissue paper prior to its assembly into a web includes U.S. Pat. No. 5,264,082, issued to Phan and Trokhan on Nov. 23, 1993, incorporated herein by reference.
      <br/>
      Such methods have found broad use in the industry especially when it is desired to reduce the strength which would otherwise be present in the paper and when the papermaking process, particularly the creeping operation, is robust enough to tolerate incorporation of the bond inhibiting agents.
      <br/>
      However, there are problems associated with these methods, well known to those skilled in the art.
      <br/>
      First, the location of the chemical softener is not controlled; it is spread as broadly through the paper structure as the fiber furnish to which it is applied.
      <br/>
      In addition, there is a loss of paper strength accompanying use of these additives.
      <br/>
      While not being bound by theory, it is widely believed that the additives tend to inhibit the formation of fiber to fiber hydrogen bonds.
      <br/>
      There also can be a loss of control of the sheet as it is creped from the Yankee dryer.
      <br/>
      Again, a widely believed theory is that the additives interfere with the coating on the Yankee dryer so that the bond between the wet web and the dryer is weakened.
      <br/>
      Prior art such as U.S. Pat. No. 5,487,813, issued to Vinson, et. al., Jan. 30, 1996, incorporated herein by reference, discloses a chemical combination to mitigate the before mentioned effects on strength and adhesion to the creping cylinder; however, there still remains a need to incorporate a chemical softener into a paper web in a targeted fashion with minimal effect on web strength and interference with the production process.
    </p>
    <p num="14">
      Further exemplary art related to the addition of chemical softeners to the tissue paper web during its formation includes U.S. Pat. No. 5,059,282, issued to Ampulski, et. al. on Oct. 22, 1991 incorporated herein by reference.
      <br/>
      The Ampulski patent discloses a process for adding a polysiloxane compound to a wet tissue web (preferably at a fiber consistency between about 20% and about 35%).
      <br/>
      Such a method represents an advance in some respects over the addition of chemicals into the slurry vats supplying the papermaking machine.
      <br/>
      For example, such means target the application to one of the web surfaces as opposed to distributing the additive onto all of the fibers of the furnish.
      <br/>
      However, such methods fail to overcome the primary disadvantages of the addition of chemical softeners to the wet end of the papermaking machine, namely the strength effects and the effects on the coating of the Yankee dryer, should such a dryer be employed.
    </p>
    <p num="15">
      Because of the above mentioned effects on strength and disruption of the papermaking process, considerable art has been devised to apply chemical softeners to already-dried paper webs either at the so-called dry end of the papermaking machine or in a separate converting operation subsequent to the papermaking step.
      <br/>
      Exemplary art from this field includes U.S. Pat. No. 5,215,626, issued to Ampulski, et. al. on Jun. 1, 1993; U.S. Pat. No. 5,246,545, issued to Ampulski, et. al. on Sep. 21, 1993; and U.S. Pat. No. 5,525,345, issued to Warner, et. al. on Jun. 11, 1996, all incorporated herein by reference.
      <br/>
      The U.S. Pat. No. 5,215,626 Patent discloses a method for preparing soft tissue paper by applying a polysiloxane to a dry web.
      <br/>
      The U.S. Pat. No.5,246,545 Patent discloses a similar method utilizing a heated transfer surface.
      <br/>
      Finally, the Warner Patent discloses methods of application including roll coating and extrusion for applying particular compositions to the surface of a dry tissue web.
      <br/>
      While each of these references represent advances over the previous so-called wet end methods particularly with regard to eliminating the degrading effects on the papermaking process, none are able to completely address the absorbency effects and loss of tensile strength which accompanies application to the dry paper web due to migration of the chemical softener.
    </p>
    <p num="16">
      Thus there is a need for continual improvements in chemical softening technology to reduce the migration of chemical softeners that are applied to an already dried web in order to mitigate the effects of such migration.
      <br/>
      Achieving a high softening potential without unduly affecting other web properties, such as absorbency and strength, has long been an object of workers in the field of the present application.
    </p>
    <p num="17">Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide a soft tissue paper without performance impairing sacrifices such as in absorbency or in the strength of the paper.</p>
    <p num="18">This and other objects are obtained using the present invention as will be taught in the following disclosure.</p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="19">The invention is a strong, soft tissue paper product comprised of one or more plies of tissue paper, wherein at least one outer surface of the product has a surface deposit of a substantively affixed chemical softening mixture, comprising a quartenary ammonium compound, an emollient, and a coupling agent.</p>
    <p num="20">
      The preferred embodiment of the present invention employs for the quaternary ammonium compound a dialkyldimethylammonium salts (e.g. ditallowdimethylammonium chloride, ditallowdimethylammonium methyl sulfate, di(hydrogenated tallow)dimethyl ammonium chloride, etc.).
      <br/>
      Particularly preferred variants of these compounds are what are considered to be mono or diester variations of the before mentioned dialkyldimethylammonium salts.
      <br/>
      These include so-called diester ditallow dimethyl ammonium chloride, diester distearyl dimethyl ammonium chloride, monoester ditallow dimethyl ammonium chloride, diester di(hydrogenated)tallow dimethyl ammonium methyl sulfate, diester di(hydrogenated)tallow dimethyl ammonium chloride, monoester di(hydrogenated)tallow dimethyl ammonium chloride, and mixtures thereof, with the diester variations of di(non hydrogenated)tallow dimethyl ammonium chloride, Di(Touch Hydrogenated)Tallow DiMethyl Ammonium Chloride (DEDTHTDMAC) and Di(Hydrogenated)Tallow DiMethyl Ammonium Chloride (DEDHIDMAC), and mixtures thereof being especially preferred.
      <br/>
      Depending upon the product characteristic requirements, the saturation level of the ditallow can be tailored from non hydrogenated (soft), to partially hydrogenated (touch), or completely hydrogenated (hard).
    </p>
    <p num="21">Preferred emollients include mineral oil, petrolatum, and silicones, with petrolatum being particularly preferred.</p>
    <p num="22">
      Preferred coupling agent have low HLB values.
      <br/>
      Particularly preferred coupling agents are the sorbitan esters of a fatty acid, e.g. sorbitan monostearate, as well as blends of the monoester with ethyloxylated forms thereof Most preferably, both sorbitan monostearate and ethoxylated sorbitan monostearate are present with a ratio of sorbitan monostearate to the ethoxylated sorbitan monostearate being preferably in the range of about 2:1 to about 4:1.
    </p>
    <p num="23">
      The preferred embodiment of the present invention is characterized by having uniform surface deposits of the softening mixture spaced apart at a frequency between about 1 deposit per lineal inch and about 100 deposits per lineal inch.
      <br/>
      Most preferably, the uniform surface deposits are spaced apart at a frequency between about 5 and about 25 deposits per lineal inch.
    </p>
    <p num="24">
      The term "frequency" in reference to the spacing of the deposits of chemical softener, as used herein, is defined as the number of deposits per lineal inch as measured in the direction of closest spacing.
      <br/>
      It is recognized that many patterns or arrangements of deposits qualify as being uniform and discrete and the spacing can be measured in several directions.
      <br/>
      For example, a rectilinear arrangement of deposits would be measured as having fewer deposits per inch in a diagonal line than on the horizontal and the vertical.
      <br/>
      Inventors believe that the direction of minimal spacing is the most significant and therefore define the frequency in that direction.
      <br/>
      A common engraving pattern is the so-called "hexagonal" pattern in which the recessed areas are engraved on centers residing on the corners of a equilateral hexagon with an additional recessed area in the center of the hexagonal figure.
      <br/>
      It is recognized that the closest spacing for this arrangement lies along a pair of lines intersecting each other at 60 (degree)  and each intersecting a horizontal line at 60 (degree) . The number of cells per square area in a hexagonal arrangement is thus 1.15 times the square of the frequency.
    </p>
    <p num="25">Preferred embodiments of the present invention are further characterized by having the uniform surface deposits of the chemical softening agent predominantly residing on one or both of the two outer surfaces of the soft tissue paper product.</p>
    <p num="26">Finally, the invention is characterized by having less than about 50%, more preferably less than about 25%, and most preferably less than about 5% of the tissue surface covered by the chemical softener.</p>
    <p num="27">While not wishing to be bound by theory, inventors believe that the combination of the chemical softeners and the geometric parameters recited herein cause the softened tissue to illicit a surprising maximum in human tactile response resulting from the spacing of nerve sensors in human skin.</p>
    <p num="28">
      Preferred substantively affixed chemical softening agents comprise quaternary ammonium compounds including, but not limited to, the well-known dialkyldimethylammonium salts (e.g. ditallowdimethylammonium chloride, ditallowdimethylammonium methyl sulfate, di(hydrogenated tallow)dimethyl ammonium chloride, etc.).
      <br/>
      Particularly preferred variants of these softening agents are what are considered to be mono or diester variations of the before mentioned dialkyldimethylammonium salts.
      <br/>
      These include so-called diester ditallow dimethyl ammonium chloride, diester distearyl dimethyl ammonium chloride, monoester ditallow dimethyl ammonium chloride, diester di(hydrogenated)tallow dimethyl ammonium methyl sulfate, diester di(hydrogenated)tallow dimethyl ammonium chloride, monoester di(hydrogenated)tallow dimethyl ammonium chloride, and mixtures thereof, with the diester variations of di(non hydrogenated)tallow dimethyl ammonium chloride, Di(Touch Hydrogenated)Tallow DiMethyl Ammonium Chloride (DEDTHTDMAC) and Di(Hydrogenated)Tallow DiMethyl Ammonium Chloride (DEDHTDMAC), and mixtures thereof being especially preferred.
      <br/>
      Depending upon the product characteristic requirements, the saturation level of the ditallow can be tailored from non hydrogenated (soft), to partially hydrogenated (touch), or completely hydrogenated (hard).
    </p>
    <p num="29">
      The soft tissue paper of the present invention preferably has a basis weight between about 10 g/m2 and about 100 g/m2 and, more preferably, between about 10 g/m2 and about 50 g/m2.
      <br/>
      It has a density between about 0.03 g/cm3 and about 0.6 g/cm3 and, more preferably, between about 0.05 g/cm3 and 0.2 g/cm3.
    </p>
    <p num="30">
      The soft tissue paper of the present invention further comprises papermaking fibers of both hardwood and softwood types wherein at least about 50% of the papermaking fibers are hardwood and at least about 10% are softwood.
      <br/>
      The hardwood and softwood fibers are most preferably isolated by relegating each to separate layers wherein the tissue comprises an inner layer and at least one outer layer.
    </p>
    <p num="31">The tissue paper product of the present invention is preferably creped, i.e, produced on a papermaking machine culminating with a Yankee dryer to which a partially dried papermaking web is adhered and upon which it is dried and from which it is removed by the action of a flexible creping blade.</p>
    <p num="32">
      While the characteristics of the creped paper webs, particularly when the creping process is preceded by methods of pattern densification, are preferred for practicing the present invention, uncreped tissue paper is also a satisfactory substitute and the practice of the present invention using uncreped tissue paper is specifically incorporated within the scope of the present invention.
      <br/>
      Uncreped tissue paper, a term as used herein, refers to tissue paper which is non-compressively dried, most preferably by throughdrying.
      <br/>
      Resultant through air dried webs are pattern densified such that zones of relatively high density are dispersed within a high bulk field, including pattern densified tissue wherein zones of relatively high density are continuous and the high bulk field is discrete.
    </p>
    <p num="33">
      To produce uncreped tissue paper webs, an embryonic web is transferred from the formations forming carrier upon which it is laid, to a slower moving, high fiber support transfer fabric carrier.
      <br/>
      The web is then transferred to a drying fabric upon which it is dried to a final dryness.
      <br/>
      Such webs can offer some advantages in surface smoothness compared to creped paper webs.
    </p>
    <p num="34">
      The techniques to produce uncreped tissue in this manner are taught in the prior art.
      <br/>
      For example, Wendt, et. al. in European Patent Application 0 677 612A2, published Oct. 18, 1995 and incorporated herein by reference, teach a method of making soft tissue products without creping.
      <br/>
      In another case, Hyland, et. al. in European Patent Application 0 617 164 A1, published Sep. 28, 1994 and incorporated herein by reference, teach a method of making smooth uncreped through air dried sheets.
      <br/>
      Finally, Farrington, et. al. in U.S. Pat. No. 5,656,132 published Aug. 12, 1997 and incorporated herein by reference, describes the use of a machine to make soft through air dried tissues without the use of a Yankee.
    </p>
    <p num="35">
      Tissue paper webs are generally comprised essentially of papermaking fibers.
      <br/>
      Small amounts of chemical functional agents such as wet strength or dry strength binders, retention aids, surfactants, size, chemical softeners, crepe facilitating compositions are frequently included but these are typically only used in minor amounts.
      <br/>
      The papermaking fibers most frequently used in tissue papers are virgin chemical wood pulps.
    </p>
    <p num="36">Filler materials may also be incorporated into the tissue papers of the present invention. U.S. Pat. No. 5,611,890, issued to Vinson et al. on Mar. 18, 1997, the: disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference, discloses filled tissue paper products acceptable as substrates for the present invention.</p>

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="38">While this specification concludes with claims particularly pointing out and distinctly claiming the subject matter regarded as the invention, it is believed that the invention can be better understood from a reading of the following detailed description and of the appended examples.</p>
    <p num="39">
      As used herein, the term "comprising" means that the various components, ingredients, or steps, can be conjointly employed in practicing the present invention.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, the term "comprising" encompasses the more restrictive terms "consisting essentially of" and "consisting of."
    </p>
    <p num="40">As used herein, the term "water soluble" refers to materials that are soluble in water to at least 3%, by weight, at 25 (degree)  C.</p>
    <p num="41">
      As used herein, the terms "tissue paper web, paper web, web, paper sheet and paper product" all refer to sheets of paper made by a process comprising the steps of forming an aqueous papermaking furnish, depositing this furnish on a formations forming surface, such as a Fourdrinier wire, and removing the water from the furnish as by gravity or vacuum-assisted drainage, forming an embryonic web, transferring the embryonic web from the forming surface to a transfer surface or fabric upon which it is further dried using means known to the art, such as through air drying.
      <br/>
      The web may be still further dried to a final dryness using additional means, such as a Yankee dryer, after which it is wound upon a reel.
    </p>
    <p num="42">
      The terms "multi-layered tissue paper web, multi-layered paper web, multi-layered web, multi-layered paper sheet and multi-layered paper product" are all used interchangeably in the art to refer to sheets of paper prepared from two or more layers of aqueous paper making furnish which are preferably comprised of different fiber types, the fibers typically being relatively long softwood and relatively short hardwood fibers as used in tissue paper making.
      <br/>
      The layers are preferably formed from the deposition of separate streams of dilute fiber slurries upon one or more endless formations surfaces.
      <br/>
      If the individual layers are initially formed on separate formations surfaces, the layers can be subsequently combined when wet to form a multi-layered tissue paper web.
    </p>
    <p num="43">
      As used herein, the term "single-ply tissue product" means that it is comprised of one ply of tissue; the ply can be substantially homogeneous in nature or it can be a multi-layered tissue paper web.
      <br/>
      As used herein, the term "multi-ply tissue product" means that it is comprised of more than one ply of tissue.
      <br/>
      The plies of a multi-ply tissue product can be substantially homogeneous in nature or they can be multi-layered tissue paper webs.
    </p>
    <p num="44">Other terms are defined in the specification where initially discussed.</p>
    <p num="45">All percentages, ratios and proportions used herein are by weight unless otherwise specified.</p>
    <p num="46">General Description of the Soft Tissue Paper</p>
    <p num="47">The invention in its most general form, is a strong, soft tissue paper product comprised of one or more plies of tissue paper, wherein at least one outer surface of the product has surface deposits of a substantively affixed chemical softening mixture, comprising a quartenary ammonium compound, an emollient, and a coupling agent.</p>
    <p num="48">
      The preferred embodiment of the present invention is characterized by surface deposits which are uniform, discrete, and spaced apart at a frequency between about 1 deposit per lineal inch and about 100 deposits per lineal inch.
      <br/>
      Most preferably, the uniform surface deposits are spaced apart at a frequency between about 5 and about 25 deposits per line inch.
    </p>
    <p num="49">The uniform surface deposits of the chemical softening agent are preferably less than about 2700 microns in diameter, more preferably less than about 800 microns in diameter, and most preferably less than about 240 microns in diameter.</p>
    <p num="50">The present invention is further characterized by having the uniform surface deposits predominantly residing on at least one, and more preferably both, of the two outer surfaces of the tissue paper product.</p>
    <p num="51">General Description of the Chemical Softening Mixture</p>
    <p num="52">
      The chemical: softening mixture of the present invention has been found to impart desirable softness and lubricity to tissue substrates to which it is applied while, at the same time, minimizing the detrimental effects on absorbency and strength of chemical softening,compositions of the prior art.
      <br/>
      As used herein, the term "substantively affixed chemical softening mixture" is defined as a mixture which imparts lubricity or emolliency to tissue paper products and also possesses permanence with regard to maintaining the fidelity of its deposits without substantial migration when exposed to the environmental conditions to which products of this type are ordinarily exposed during their typical life cycle.
      <br/>
      Waxes and oils alone, for example, are capable of imparting lubricity or emolliency to tissue paper, but they suffer from a tendency to migrate because they have little affinity for the cellulose pulps which comprise the tissue papers of the present invention.
      <br/>
      While not wishing to be bound by theory, the Applicants believe that the components of the substantively affixed chemical mixture of the present invention interact with each other by Van der Waals forces, covalent bonding, ionic bonding, or hydrogen bonding or some combination thereof to minimize migration.
    </p>
    <p num="53">
      The Applicants have identified particularly desirable compositions comprising a mixture of a quaternary ammonium compound, an emollient and a coupling agent that provide such desirable lubricity and softness without substantial migration when such mixtures are applied to a tissue substrate at the levels described above.
      <br/>
      Suitable embodiments of such mixtures comprise between about 40% and about 80% of a quaternary ammonium compound; between about 10% and about 30% of an emollient; and between about 10% and about 20% of a coupling agent.
      <br/>
      Preferred embodiments comprise between about 50% and about 70% of a quaternary ammonium compound; between about 15% and about 25% of an emollient; and between about 12% and about 20% of a coupling agent.
      <br/>
      A particularly preferred mixture has the composition shown in Table 1.

      Furthermore the ester-functional quaternary ammonium compounds can optionally contain up to about 10% of the mono(long chain alkyl) derivatives, e.g., (R1)2 --N+ --((CH2)2 OH) ((CH2)2 OC(O)R3) X- as minor ingredients.
      <br/>
      These minor ingredients can act as emulsifiers and are useful in the present invention.

      Parenthetically, while not wishing to be bound by theory, it is believed that the ester moiety(ies) of the before mentioned quaternary compounds lends to them a measure of biodegradability.
      <br/>
      Importantly, the ester-functional quaternary ammonium compounds used herein biodegrade more rapidly than do conventional dialkyl dimethyl ammonium chemical softeners.
    </p>
    <p num="74">
      While such quaternary ammonium compounds provide desirable softening to tissue webs, use of such compounds also results in a reduction in the tensile properties of such webs.
      <br/>
      As noted above, such reduction in tensile properties is believed to be caused by an inhibition in the formation of fiber-to fiber hydrogen bonds due to the migration of the quaternary ammonium compound.

    <p num="75">Emollient</p>
    <p num="76">
      The present invention is further characterized by the presence of an emollient.
      <br/>
      As used herein, an "emollient" is a material that softens, soothes, supples, coats, lubricates, or moisturizes the skin.
      <br/>
      An emollient typically accomplishes several of these objectives such as soothing, moisturizing, and lubricating the skin.
      <br/>
      Preferred emollients will have either a plastic or liquid consistency at ambient temperatures, i.e., 20 (degree)  C. This particular emollient consistency allows the composition to impart a soft, lubricious, lotion-like feel.
    </p>
    <p num="77">
      Suitable emollients include petroleum based linear and branched alkanes and alkenes that are liquid or solid at a temperature of 20 (degree)  C. and atmospheric pressure.
      <br/>
      Suitable petroleum-based emollients include those hydrocarbons, or mixtures of hydrocarbons, having chain lengths of from 16 to 32 carbon atoms.
      <br/>
      Petroleum based hydrocarbons having these chain lengths include mineral oil (also known as "liquid petrolatum") and petrolatum (also known as "mineral wax," "petroleum jelly" and "mineral jelly").
      <br/>
      Mineral oil usually refers to less viscous mixtures of hydrocarbons having from 16 to 20 carbon atoms.
      <br/>
      Petrolatum usually refers to more viscous mixtures of hydrocarbons having from 16 to 32 carbon atoms.
      <br/>
      Petrolatum and mineral oil are particularly preferred emollients for compositions of the present invention.
      <br/>
      Petrolatum is a particularly preferred emollient because it imparts a highly desirable emolliency to tissue paper.
      <br/>
      A suitable material is available from Witco, Corp., Greenwich, Conn. as White Protopet.RTM. IS.
    </p>
    <p num="78">
      Other suitable types of emollients for use herein include polysiloxane compounds.

      In general, suitable polysiloxane materials for use in the present invention include those having monomeric siloxane units of the following structure:  (Chemical Structure image '2' not included in text)
    </p>
    <p num="79">
      wherein, R1 and R2, for each independent siloxane monomeric unit can each independently be hydrogen or any alkyl, aryl, alkenyl, alkaryl, arakyl, cycloalkyl, halogenated hydrocarbon, or other radical.
      <br/>
      Any of such radicals can be substituted or unsubstituted.
      <br/>
      R1 and R2 radicals of any particular monomeric unit may differ from the corresponding functionalities of the next adjoining monomeric unit.
      <br/>
      Additionally, the polysiloxane can be either a straight chain, a branched chain or have a cyclic structure.
      <br/>
      The radicals R1 and R2 can additionally independently be other silaceous functionalities such as, but not limited to siloxanes, polysiloxanes, silanes, and polysilanes.
      <br/>
      The radicals R1 and R2 may contain any of a variety of organic functionalities including, for example, alcohol, carboxylic acid, phenyl, and amine functionalities.
    </p>
    <p num="80">
      Exemplary alkyl radicals are methyl, ethyl, propyl, butyl, pentyl, hexyl, octyl, decyl, octadecyl, and the like.

      Exemplary alkenyl radicals are vinyl, allyl, and the like.
      <br/>
      Exemplary aryl radicals are phenyl, diphenyl, naphthyl, and the like.
      <br/>
      Exemplary alkaryl radicals are toyl, xylyl, ethylphenyl, and the like.

      Exemplary aralkyl radicals are benzyl, alpha-phenylethyl, beta-phenylethyl, alpha-phenylbutyl, and the like.
      <br/>
      Exemplary cycloalkyl radicals are cyclobutyl, cyclopentyl, cyclohexyl, and the like.
      <br/>
      Exemplary halogenated hydrocarbon radicals are chloromethyl, bromoethyl, tetrafluorethyl, fluorethyl, trifluorethyl, trifluorotloyl, hexafluoroxylyl, and the like.

    <p num="81">Preferred polysiloxanes include straight chain organopolysiloxane materials of the following general formula:  (Chemical Structure image '3' not included in text)</p>
    <p num="82">
      wherein each R1 -R9 radical can independently be any C1 -C10 unsubstituted alkyl or aryl radical, and R10 of any substituted C1 -C10 alkyl or aryl radical.
      <br/>
      Preferably each R1 -R9 radical is independently any C1 -C4 unsubstituted alkyl group. those skilled in the art will recognize that technically there is no difference whether, for example, R9 or R10 is the substituted radical.
      <br/>
      Preferably the mole ratio of b to (a+b) is between 0 and about 20%, more preferably between 0 and about 10%, and most preferably between about 1% and about 5%.
    </p>
    <p num="83">
      In one particularly preferred embodiment, R1 -R9 are methyl groups and R10 is a substituted or unsubstituted alkyl, aryl, or alkenyl group.
      <br/>
      Such material shall be generally described herein as polydimethylsiloxane which has a particular functionality as may be appropriate in that particular case.
      <br/>
      Exemplary polydimethylsiloxane include, for example, polydimethylsiloxane having an alkyl hydrocarbon R10 radical and polydimethylsiloxane having one or more amino, carboxyl, hydroxyl, ether, polyether, aldehyde, ketone, amide, ester, thiol, and/or other functionalities including alkyl and alkenyl analogs of such functionalities.
      <br/>
      For example, an amino functional alkyl group as R10 could be an amino functional or an aminoalkyl-functional polydimethylsiloxane.
      <br/>
      The exemplary listing of these polydimethylsiloxanes is not meant to thereby exclude others not specifically listed.
    </p>
    <p num="84">
      Viscosity of polysiloxanes useful for this invention may vary as widely as the viscosity of polysiloxanes in general vary, so long as the polysiloxane can be rendered into a form which can be applied to the tissue paper product herein.
      <br/>
      This includes, but is not limited to, viscosity as low as about 25 centistokes to about 20,000,000 centistokes or even higher.
    </p>
    <p num="85">
      While not wishing to be bound by theory, it is believed that the tactile benefit efficacy is related to average molecular weight and that viscosity is also related to average molecular weight.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, due to the difficulty of measuring molecular weight directly, viscosity is used herein as the apparent operative parameter with respect to imparting softness to tissue paper.

    <p num="88">
      While it provides desirable emolliency to tissue paper, when used alone, petrolatum can have a deleterious effect on absorbency.
      <br/>
      Also, as noted above, migration of quaternary ammonium compounds can result in a loss in tensile properties.
      <br/>
      Further, it tends to migrate easily over time.
      <br/>
      As noted above, the softening mixture is preferably provided in spaced apart surface deposits.
      <br/>
      Such spaced apart surface deposits address the absorbency effects of hydrophobic emollients, such as petrolatum, as long as the emollient does not migrate.
      <br/>
      Strength resins can also be used to mitigate the loss in tensile properties due to migration of a quaternary ammonium compound.
    </p>
    <p num="89">
      The Applicants have found that, by providing a coupling agent that associates with both the quaternary ammonium compound and the emollient of the present invention, migration of the quaternary ammonium compound and the emollient can be substantially reduced.
      <br/>
      The Applicants believe that a synergism results from the relationship of the quaternary ammonium compound, the emollient, and the coupling agent.
      <br/>
      The total composition has the desirable properties of each component, while minimizing any negative properties of the components.
      <br/>
      While not wishing to be bound by theory, the Applicants believe that polar head group of a suitable coupling agent can align with the polar nitrogen center of a quaternary ammonium compound producing a non-migratory mixture itself (so as to reduce loss of tensile properties) and concentrating their respective alkyl chains in a configuration which can entrap the emollient, preventing it from migrating while preserving its lubricating ability.

    <p num="108">The tissue paper product of the present invention is preferably creped, i.e., produced on a papermaking machine culminating with a Yankee dryer to which a partially dried papermaking web is adhered and upon which it is dried and from which it is removed by the action of a flexible creping blade.</p>
    <p num="109">
      Creping is a means of mechanically compacting paper in the machine direction.
      <br/>
      The result is an increase in basis weight (mass per unit area) as well as dramatic changes in many physical properties, particularly when measured in the machine direction.
      <br/>
      Creping is generally accomplished with a flexible blade, a so-called doctor blade, against a Yankee dryer in an on machine operation.
    </p>
    <p num="110">
      A Yankee dryer is a large cylinder, generally 8-20 feet in diameter, which is designed to be pressurized with steam to provide a hot surface for completing the drying of papermaking webs at the end of the papermaking process.
      <br/>
      The paper web which is first formed on a formations forming carrier, such as a Fourdrinier wire, where it is freed of the copious water needed to disperse the fibrous slurry, is generally transferred to a felt or fabric in a so-called press section where de-watering is continued either by mechanically compacting the paper or by some other de-watering method such as through-drying with hot air, before finally being transferred in a semi-dry condition to the surface of the Yankee for the drying to be completed.
    </p>
    <p num="111">
      While the characteristics of the creped paper webs, particularly when the creping process is preceded by methods of pattern densification, are preferred for practicing the present invention, uncreped tissue paper is also a satisfactory substitute and the practice of the present invention using uncreped tissue paper is specifically incorporated within the scope of the present invention.
      <br/>
      Uncreped tissue paper, a term as used herein, refers to tissue paper which is non-compressively dried, most preferably by throughdrying.
      <br/>
      Resultant through air dried webs are pattern densified such that zones of relatively high density are dispersed within a high bulk field, including pattern densified tissue wherein zones of relatively high density are continuous and the high bulk field is discrete.
    </p>
    <p num="112">
      To produce uncreped tissue paper webs, an embryonic web is transferred from the formations forming carrier upon which it is laid, to a slower moving, high fiber support transfer fabric carrier.
      <br/>
      The web is then transferred to a drying fabric upon which it is dried to a final dryness.
      <br/>
      Such webs can offer some advantages in surface smoothness compared to creped paper webs.
    </p>
    <p num="113">
      The techniques to produce uncreped tissue in this manner are taught in the prior art.
      <br/>
      For example, Wendt, et. al. in European Patent Application 0 677 612A2, published Oct. 18, 1995 and incorporated herein by reference, teach a method of making soft tissue products without creping.

      In another case, Hyland, et. al. in European Patent Application 0 617 164 A1, published Sep. 28, 1994 and incorporated herein by reference, teach a method of making smooth uncreped through air dried sheets.
      <br/>
      Finally, Farrington, et. al. in U.S. Pat. No. 5,656,132 published Aug. 12, 1997 and incorporated herein by reference, describes the use of a machine to make soft through air dried tissues without the use of a Yankee.

      FIGS. 1-4 are provided as an aid in describing the present invention.
      <br/>
      FIG. 1 is a side elevational view of a printing arrangement illustrating a preferred method of forming the uniform the surface deposits of substantively affixed chemical softening agent of the present invention.
      <br/>
      The process illustrated in FIG. 1 applies the softening agent to one surface of the tissue paper product by an offset printing method.

    <p num="121">
      In FIG. 1, liquid chemical softener 6, preferably heated by means not shown, is contained in a pan 5, such that rotating gravure cylinder 4, also preferably heated by means not shown, is partially immersed in the liquid chemical softener 6.
      <br/>
      The gravure cylinder 4 has a plurality of recessed areas which are substantially void of contents when they enter pan 5, but fill with chemical softener 6 as the gravure cylinder 4 becomes partially immersed in the fluid in pan 5 during cylinder rotation.
      <br/>
      The gravure cylinder 4 and its pattern of recessed areas are illustrated hereinafter in FIG. 4 so a detailed description is delayed until it is provided in reference to that figure.
    </p>
    <p num="122">
      Still referring to FIG. 1, excess chemical softener 6 that is picked up from the pan 5 but is not held in the recessed areas is removed by a flexible doctor blade 7, which contacts gravure cylinder 4 on its outer surface, but is unable to significantly deform into the recessed areas.
      <br/>
      Hence, the remaining chemical softener on gravure cylinder 4 resides almost exclusively in the recessed areas of the gravure cylinder 4.
      <br/>
      This remaining chemical softener is transferred in the form of uniform discrete deposits to an applicator cylinder 3.
      <br/>
      Applicator cylinder 3 can have any of a variety of surface coverings provided they suit the purpose of the process.
      <br/>
      Most commonly, the cylinder will have a metallic covering.
      <br/>
      The gravure cylinder 4 and the applicator cylinder 3 normally will operate with interference since having a loading pressure will aid in extraction of the liquid chemical softener from the recessed areas of gravure cylinder 4 as they successively pass through the area 8 formed by the juxtaposition of the gravure cylinder 4 and the applicator cylinder 3.
      <br/>
      An interference or actual contact between the cylinder surfaces in area 8 is usually preferred, but it is envisioned that certain combinations of size and shape of recessed areas and chemical softener fluid characteristics might permit satisfactory transfer by merely having the two cylinders pass within close proximity.
      <br/>
      The chemical softener extracted in area 8 from the gravure cylinder 4 to the applicator cylinder 3 takes the form of surface deposits corresponding in size and spacing to the pattern of recessed areas of the gravure cylinder 4.
      <br/>
      The deposits of chemical softener on the applicator cylinder 3 transfer to tissue paper web 1, which is directed towards area 9, a area defined by the point at which the applicator cylinder 3, tissue paper web 1, and impression cylinder 2 are in the vicinity of one another.
      <br/>
      Impression cylinder 2 can have any of a variety of surface coverings provided they suit the purpose of the process.
      <br/>
      Most commonly, the cylinder will be covered with a compressible covering such as an elastomeric polymer such as a natural or synthetic rubber.
      <br/>
      The impression cylinder 2 and the applicator cylinder 3 normally will operate without interfering.
      <br/>
      It is only necessary to have the cylinders pass sufficiently close to one another such that when the tissue web is present in area 9, the tissue web contacts with the proud deposits of chemical softener on applicator cylinder 3 sufficiently to cause them to at least partially be transferred from the applicator cylinder 3 to the tissue web 1.
      <br/>
      Since loading pressure between applicator cylinder 3 and impression cylinder 2 will tend to compress tissue web 1, excessively small gaps between the two cylinders should be avoided in order to preserve the thickness or bulk of tissue web 1.
      <br/>
      An interference between the cylinder surfaces (through tissue paper web 1) in area 9 is usually not necessary, but it is envisioned that certain combinations of patterns and chemical softener fluid characteristics might require that the two cylinders be operated so as to be in interference.

      Referring again to FIG. 2, excess chemical softener 15 that is picked up from the pan 14 but not held in the recessed areas, is removed by a flexible doctor blade 16, which contacts gravure cylinder 13 on its outer surface, but is unable to significantly deform into the recessed areas.

      Hence, the remaining chemical softener on gravure cylinder 13 resides almost exclusively in the recessed areas of the gravure cylinder 13.

      This remaining chemical softener is transferred in the form of uniform discrete deposits to a tissue paper web 1, which is directed towards area 17.
      <br/>
      The transfer occurs because the tissue web 1 is brought into the vicinity of the chemical softener present in the recessed areas due to the constraint of impression cylinder 12 relative to gravure cylinder 13 in area 17.
      <br/>
      Impression cylinder 12 can have any of a variety of surface coverings provided they suit the purpose of the process.
      <br/>
      Most commonly, the cylinder will be covered with a compressible covering such as an elastomeric polymer such as a natural or synthetic rubber.

      An interference transmitted through tissue paper web 1 in area 17 is usually preferred, but it is envisioned that certain combinations of size and shape of recessed areas and chemical softener fluid characteristics might permit satisfactory transfer by merely having the two cylinders and confined tissue web pass within close proximity.

      FIG. 3 is a side elevational view of a printing arrangement illustrating another alternate method of forming the uniform surface deposits of substantively affixed chemical softening agent of the present invention.

      In FIG. 3, liquid chemical softener 26, preferably heated by means not shown, is contained in pans 27, such that the rotating gravure cylinders 25, also preferably heated by means not shown, are partially immersed in chemical softener 26.
      <br/>
      The gravure cylinders 25 have a plurality of recessed areas which are substantially void of contents when they enter their respective pans 27, but fill with chemical softener 26 while immersed in pans 27 as the gravure cylinders 25 become partially immersed in them with their rotation.
      <br/>
      The gravure cylinders 25 and their pattern of recessed areas are illustrated hereinafter in FIG. 4 so a detailed description is deferred until it is provided in reference to that Figure.
      <br/>
      The gravure cylinders 25 of FIG. 3 will ordinarily be similar in design, but they can also be deliberately varied especially in regards to the pattern of recessed areas.
      <br/>
      Differences can be used to tailor the characteristics of the product from side to side.

    <p num="128">
      Still referring to FIG. 3, excess chemical softener 26 that is picked up from the pans 27 but not held in the recessed areas is removed by a flexible doctor blades 28, which contact gravure cylinders 25 on their outer surfaces, but are unable to significantly deform into the recessed areas.
      <br/>
      Hence, the remaining chemical softener on gravure cylinder 25 resides almost exclusively in the recessed areas of the gravure cylinders 25.

      This remaining chemical softener is transferred in the form of uniform discrete deposits to applicator cylinders 23.

      Usually, the cylinders 23 will be similar in nature, but they can differ as well to create different characteristics of the product from side to side.
      <br/>
      Each pair of gravure cylinders 25 with its respective applicator cylinders 23 normally will operate in interference since having a loading pressure between the cylinder pairs will aid in extraction of the liquid chemical softener from the recessed areas of gravure cylinders 25 as they successively pass through their respective interference areas 24 formed by the interference of the gravure cylinders 25 with their respective applicator cylinders 23.
      <br/>
      Interference or actual contact between the cylinder surfaces in one or both of the areas 24 is usually preferred, but it is envisioned that certain combinations of size and shape of recessed areas and chemical softener fluid characteristics might permit satisfactory transfer by merely having the one or more of the cylinder pairs pass within close proximity.

      The chemical softener extracted in the areas 24 from the gravure cylinders 25 to the applicator cylinders 23 takes the form of surface deposits corresponding in size and spacing to the pattern of recessed areas of the gravure cylinders 25.

      The deposits of chemical softener on the applicator cylinders 23 transfer to tissue paper web 1, which is directed towards area 22, as the deposits of chemical softener passes through the area 22.
      <br/>
      Area 22 is formed by the applicator cylinders 23 at their most proximate point with tissue paper web 1 passing between the applicator cylinders 23.

      The applicator cylinders 23 normally will operate without interfering, i.e. touching, one another.

      Since loading pressure between applicator cylinders 23 will tend to compress tissue web 1, excessively small gaps between the two cylinders should be avoided in order to preserve the thickness or bulk of tissue web 1.

      FIG. 4 is a schematic representation illustrating the detail of the recessed areas for use on the printing cylinders illustrated in FIGS. 1,2, and 3, i.e. gravure cylinder 4 of FIG. 1, gravure cylinder 13 of FIG. 2, and gravure cylinders 25 of FIG. 3.
      <br/>
      Referring to FIG. 4, the gravure cylinder 31 possesses a plurality of recessed areas sometimes referred to as cells.
      <br/>
      The recessed areas 33 exist on an otherwise smooth cylindrical surface 32.
    </p>
    <p num="130">
      The cylinder 31 may be comprised of a variety of materials.
      <br/>
      In general, it will be relatively non-compressible in nature such as a metallic or ceramic roll, but elastomeric roll coverings are possible as well.
      <br/>
      Most preferably, the surface of the cylinder 31 is ceramic such as aluminum oxide.
      <br/>
      This permits the creation of the plurality of recessed areas by engraving them by directing an intense laser beam at the surface as is well known in the process printing industry.
    </p>
    <p num="131">
      An alternate means of creating the recessed areas on cylinder 31 is to electromechanically engrave them using an electronically controlled oscillation of a diamond tipped cutting tool.
      <br/>
      When this method is selected, it is most convenient to surface the roll with copper until it is engraved and then to plate a thin chrome finish to protect the soft copper layer.
    </p>
    <p num="132">
      Another alternate means of creating the recessed areas on cylinder 31 is to chemically etch them using a labile roll surface protected by a chemically resistant mask secured on the rolls surface to prevent etching in the areas not intended to become recessed areas 33.
      <br/>
      When this method is selected, it is again most convenient to surface the roll with copper until it is etched and then to plate a thin chrome finish to protect the soft copper layer.
    </p>
    <p num="133">
      Finally, yet another alternate means of creating the recessed areas on cylinder 31 is to mechanically engrave them using a knurled cutting tool.

      This method permits the widest variety of materials of construction for the cylinder but suffers from little possible variation in the achievable patterns.

      The separation distance 34 of the recessed cells 33 on the cylindrical surface 32 ranges from five recessed areas per inch to 100 recessed areas per inch.

      It is common to add a cationic charge biasing species to the papermaking process to control the zeta potential of the aqueous papermaking furnish as it is delivered to the papermaking process.
      <br/>
      These materials are used because most of the solids in nature have negative surface charges, including the surfaces of cellulosic fibers and fines and most inorganic fillers.
      <br/>
      One traditionally used cationic charge biasing species is alum.
      <br/>
      More recently in the art, charge biasing is done by use of relatively low molecular weight cationic synthetic polymers preferably having a molecular weight of no more than about 500,000 and more preferably no more than about 200,000, or even about 100,000.
      <br/>
      The charge densities of such low molecular weight cationic synthetic polymers are relatively high.
      <br/>
      These charge densities range from about 4 to about 8 equivalents of cationic nitrogen per kilogram of polymer.

      <br/>
      The papermaking fibers are preferably comprised of different fiber types, the fibers typically being relatively long softwood and relatively short hardwood fibers.
      <br/>
      More preferably, the hardwood fibers comprise at least about 50% and said softwood fibers comprise at least about 10% of said papermaking fibers.

      The term "strength" as used herein refers to the specific total tensile strength, the determination method for this measure is included in a later section of this specification.
      <br/>
      The tissue paper webs according to the present invention are strong.
      <br/>
      This generally means that their specific total tensile strength is at least about 200 grams per inch, more preferably more than about 300 grams per inch.
    </p>
    <p num="154">
      The terms "lint" and "dust" are used interchangeably herein and refer to the tendency of a tissue paper web to release fibers or particulate fillers as measured in a controlled abrasion test, the methodology for which is detailed in a later section of this specification.
      <br/>
      Lint and dust are related to strength since the tendency to release fibers or particles is directly related to the degree to which such fibers or particles are anchored into the structure.
      <br/>
      As the overall level of anchoring is increased, the strength will be increased.
      <br/>
      However, it is possible to have a level of strength which is regarded as acceptable but have an unacceptable level of linting or dusting.
      <br/>
      This is because linting or dusting can be localized.
      <br/>
      For example, the surface of a tissue paper web can be prone to linting or dusting, while the degree of bonding beneath the surface can be sufficient to raise the overall level of strength to quite acceptable levels.
      <br/>
      In another case, the strength can be derived from a skeleton of relatively long papermaking fibers, while fiber fines or the particulate filler can be insufficiently bound within the structure.
      <br/>
      The tissue paper webs of the present invention are relatively low in lint.
      <br/>
      Levels of lint below about 12 are preferable, and below about 10 are more preferable.
    </p>
    <p num="155">
      The multi-layered tissue paper webs of to the present invention can be used in any application where soft, absorbent multi-layered tissue paper webs are required.
      <br/>
      Particularly advantageous uses of the multi-layered tissue paper web of this invention are in toilet tissue and facial tissue products.
      <br/>
      Both single-ply and multi-ply tissue paper products can be produced from the webs of the present invention.

    <p num="158">Measurement of Tissue Paper Lint</p>
    <p num="159">
      The amount of lint generated from a tissue product is determined with a Sutherland Rub Tester.
      <br/>
      This tester uses a motor to rub a weighted felt 5 times over the stationary toilet tissue.
      <br/>
      The Hunter Color L value is measured before and after the rub test.
      <br/>
      The difference between these two Hunter Color L values is calculated as lint.
    </p>
    <p num="160">Sample Preparation</p>
    <p num="161">
      Prior to the lint rub testing, the paper samples to be tested should be conditioned according to TAPPI Method -T402OM-88.
      <br/>
      Here, samples are preconditioned for 24 hours at a relative humidity level of 10 to 35% and within a temperature range of 22 to 40 (degree)  C. After this preconditioning step, samples should be conditioned for 24 hours at a relative humidity of 48 to 52% and within a temperature range of 22 to 24 (degree)  C. This rub testing should also take place within the confines of the constant temperature and humidity room.

    <p num="162">
      The Sutherland Rub Tester may be obtained from Testing Machines, Inc. (Amityville, N.Y.).
      <br/>
      The tissue is first prepared by removing and discarding any product which might have been abraded in handling, e.g. on the outside of the roll.
      <br/>
      For multi-ply finished product, three sections with each containing two sheets of multi-ply product are removed and set on the bench-top.
      <br/>
      For single-ply product, six sections with each containing two sheets of single-ply product are removed and set on the bench-top.
      <br/>
      Each sample is then folded in half such that the crease is running along the cross direction (CD) of the tissue sample.
      <br/>
      For the multi-ply product, make sure one of the sides facing out is the same side facing out after the sample is folded.
      <br/>
      In other words, do not tear the plies apart from one another and rub test the sides facing one another on the inside of the product.
      <br/>
      For the single-ply product, make up 3 samples with the wire side out and 3 with the non-wire side out.
      <br/>
      Keep track of which samples are wire side out and which are non-wire side out.

    <p num="206">
      Ideally, prior to softness testing, the paper samples to be tested should be conditioned according to TAPPI Method -T402OM-88.
      <br/>
      Here, samples are preconditioned for 24 hours at a relative humidity level of 10 to 35% and within a temperature range of 22 to 40 (degree)  C. After this preconditioning step, samples should be conditioned for 24 hours at a relative humidity of 48 to 52% and within a temperature range of 22 to 24 (degree)  C.
    </p>
    <p num="207">
      Ideally, the softness panel testing should take place within the confines of a constant temperature and humidity room.
      <br/>
      If this is not feasible, all samples, including the controls, should experience identical environmental exposure conditions.
    </p>
    <p num="208">
      Softness testing is performed as a paired comparison in a form similar to that described in "Manual on Sensory Testing Methods", ASTM Special Technical Publication 434, published by the American Society For Testing and Materials 1968 and is incorporated herein by reference.
      <br/>
      Softness is evaluated by subjective testing using what is referred to as a Paired Difference Test.
      <br/>
      The method employs a standard external to the test material itself.
      <br/>
      For tactile perceived softness two samples are presented such that the subject cannot see the samples, and the subject is required to choose one of them on the basis of tactile softness.
      <br/>
      The result of the test is reported in what is referred to as Panel Score Unit (PSU).
      <br/>
      With respect to softness testing to obtain the softness data reported herein in PSU, a number of softness panel tests are preformed.
      <br/>
      In each test ten practiced softness judges are asked to rate the relative softness of three sets of paired samples.
      <br/>
      The pairs of samples are judged one pair at a time by each judge: one sample of each pair being designated X and the other Y. Briefly, each X sample is graded against its paired Y sample as follows:
      <br/>
      1. a grade of plus one is given if X is judged to may be a little softer than Y, and a grade of minus one is given if Y is judged to may be a little softer than X;
      <br/>
      2. a grade of plus two is given if X is judged to surely be a little softer than Y, and a grade of minus two is given if Y is judged to surely be a little softer than X;
      <br/>
      3. a grade of plus three is given to X if it is judged to be a lot softer than Y, and a grade of minus three is given if Y is judged to be a lot softer than X; and, lastly:
      <br/>
      4. a grade of plus four is given to X if it is judged to be a whole lot softer than Y, and a grade of minus 4 is given if Y is judged to be a whole lot softer than X.
    </p>
    <p num="209">
      The grades are averaged and the resultant value is in units of PSU.
      <br/>
      The resulting data are considered the results of one panel test.
      <br/>
      If more than one sample pair is evaluated then all sample pairs are rank ordered according to their grades by paired statistical analysis.
      <br/>
      Then, the rank is shifted up or down in value as required to give a zero PSU value to which ever sample is chosen to be the zero-base standard.
      <br/>
      The other samples then have plus or minus values as determined by their relative grades with respect to the zero base standard.
      <br/>
      The number of panel tests performed and averaged is such that about 0.2 PSU represents a significant difference in subjectively perceived softness.

    <p num="213">Sample Conditioning and Preparation</p>
    <p num="214">
      Prior to tensile testing, the paper samples to be tested should be conditioned according to TAPPI Method -T402OM-88.
      <br/>
      All plastic and paper board packaging materials must be carefully removed from the paper samples prior to testing.
      <br/>
      The paper samples should be conditioned for at least 2 hours at a relative humidity of 48 to 52% and within a temperature range of 22 to 24 (degree)  C. Sample preparation and all aspects of the tensile testing should also take place within the confines of the constant temperature and humidity room.

      Identify sheets 1 and 3 for machine direction tensile measurements and sheets 2 and 4 for cross direction tensile measurements.
      <br/>
      Next, cut through the perforation line using a paper cutter (JDC-1-10 or JDC-1-12 with safety shield available from Thwing-Albert Instrument Co. of Philadelphia, Pa.) to make 4 separate stocks.

    <p num="220">Operation of Tensile Tester</p>
    <p num="221">
      For the actual measurement of the tensile strength, use a Thwing-Albert Intelect II Standard Tensile Tester (Thwing-Albert Instrument Co. of Philadelphia, Pa.).
      <br/>
      Insert the flat face clamps into the unit and calibrate the tester according to the instructions given in the operation manual of the Thwing-Albert Intelect II.
      <br/>
      Set the instrument crosshead speed to 4.00 in/min and the 1st and 2nd gauge lengths to 2.00 inches.
      <br/>
      The break sensitivity should be set to 20.0 grams and the sample width should be set to 1.00" and the sample thickness at 0.025".
    </p>
    <p num="222">
      A load cell is selected such that the predicted tensile result for the sample to be tested lies between 25% and 75% of the range in use.
      <br/>
      For example, a 5000 gram load cell may be used for samples with a predicted tensile range of 1250 grams (25% of 5000 grams) and 3750 grams (75% of 5000 grams).
      <br/>
      The tensile tester can also be set up in the 10% range with the 5000 gram load cell such that samples with predicted tensiles of 125 grams to 375 grams could be tested.
    </p>
    <p num="223">
      Take one of the tensile strips and place one end of it in one clamp of the tensile tester.
      <br/>
      Place the other end of the paper strip in the other clamp.
      <br/>
      Make sure the long dimension of the strip is running parallel to the sides of the tensile tester.
      <br/>
      Also make sure the strips are not overhanging to the either side of the two clamps.
      <br/>
      In addition, the pressure of each of the clamps must be in full contact with the paper sample.
    </p>
    <p num="224">
      After inserting the paper test strip into the two clamps, the instrument tension can be monitored.
      <br/>
      If it shows a value of 5 grams or more, the sample is too taut.
      <br/>
      Conversely, if a period of 2-3 seconds passes after starting the test before any value is recorded, the tensile strip is too slack.
    </p>
    <p num="225">
      Start the tensile tester as described in the tensile tester instrument manual.
      <br/>
      The test is complete after the crosshead automatically returns to its initial starting position.
      <br/>
      Read and record the tensile load in units of grams from the instrument scale or the digital panel meter to the nearest unit.
    </p>
    <p num="226">
      If the reset condition is not performed automatically by the instrument, perform the necessary adjustment to set the instrument clamps to their initial starting positions.
      <br/>
      Insert the next paper strip into the two clamps as described above and obtain a tensile reading in units of grams.
      <br/>
      Obtain tensile readings from all the paper test strips.
      <br/>
      It should be noted that readings should be rejected if the strip slips or breaks in or at the edge of the clamps while performing the test.
