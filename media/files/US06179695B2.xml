      Field of the Invention
    </p>
    <p num="2">This invention relates to a chemical mechanical polishing apparatus and method for precisely and efficiently polishing a substrate, such as a wafer or the like.</p>
    <p num="3">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
    <p num="4">
      Recently, as semiconductor devices are going to have ultrafine patterns and high steps, it is requested to very precisely flatten the surface of a substrate, such as an SOI (silicon on insulator) substrate, a semiconductor wafer of Si, GaAs, InP or the like.
      <br/>
      Chemical mechanical polishing (CMP) apparatuses, such as one to be described below, are known as processing means for very precisely flattening the surface of a substrate, such as the above-described one or the like.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      As shown in FIG. 13, a conventional chemical mechanical polishing apparatus includes a table 3 for rotating an object to be processed which can detachably hold a substrate 4, such as a wafer or the like, on a lower surface thereof, a polishing-tool rotating table 1 having an integrally-provided polishing pad 2, having a diameter larger than the diameter of the substrate 4, disposed below the rotating table 3 so as to face it, and a supply nozzle 6 for supplying the upper surface of the polishing pad 2 with an abrasive (polishing slurry) 7.
      <br/>
      The substrate 4 is polished by providing the rotating table 3, holding the substrate 4, with a rotating movement indicated by an arrow B and a swinging movement indicated by a two-headed arrow C in a state of pressing the substrate 4 against the polishing pad 2.
      <br/>
      A shaft 5 rotates the rotating table 3 with a processing pressure in an axial direction indicated by a block arrow while rotating the upper surface of the polishing pad 2, provided as one body with the polishing-tool rotating table 1, in the direction of an arrow A with the abrasive (polishing slurry) 7.
    </p>
    <p num="6">In the above-described conventional approach, however, since the diameter of the polishing-tool rotating table having the polishing pad provided as one body therewith is larger than the diameter of the substrate, the following unsolved problems are present.</p>
    <p num="7">
      (1) The size of the polishing apparatus including the polishing-tool rotating table becomes large, and vibration occurs if the polishing-tool rotating table is rotated at too high a speed and hinders the very precise polishing of the surface to be polished of the substrate, serving as the object to be processed.
      <br/>
      Hence, the polishing-tool rotating table cannot be rotated at a high speed.
      <br/>
      As a result, the polishing speed (the amount of removal per unit time) cannot be increased, thereby increasing the processing cost.
      <br/>
      (2) Since the substrate, serving as the object to be processed, is polished in a state in which the entire surface to be polished of the substrate contacts the polishing surface of the polishing pad, it is difficult to efficiently remove a local defect on the surface to be polished of the substrate if such a defect is present.
    </p>

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
    <p num="23">A description will now be provided of preferred embodiments of the present invention with reference to the drawings.</p>
    <p num="24">First Embodiment</p>
    <p num="25">As shown in FIG. 1, a chemical mechanical polishing apparatus according to a first embodiment of the present invention includes a polishing station E1 for causing a substrate W to be processed, such as a wafer or the like, to rotate and to horizontally move in a radial direction while detachably holding it, and a polishing head E2 for causing respective polishing pads of a plurality of polishing-tool units 110 disposed with an equal interval in a circumferential direction above the polishing station E1 to revolve and rotate while supporting the polishing-tool units 110.</p>
    <p num="26">As shown in FIG. 1, the polishing station E1 includes a slider 104 for moving a rotating table 105 in a radial direction while supporting it on the upper surface of a guide table 103 integrally provided on a base 101, a linear driving mechanism (not shown) for moving the slider 104, the rotating table 105 whose rotation shaft 106 is rotatably supported on the slider 104 via a radial bearing and a thrust bearing, and a rotation driving mechanism (not shown) for rotating the rotating table 105, so as to cause the substrate W to rotate and to move in a radial direction while detachably holding it on the upper surface of the rotating table 105.</p>
    <p num="27">
      The polishing head E2 includes a revolution table 108 rotatably supported on a lower yoke 102a, extended above the polishing station E1, of a supporting member 102, planted on the base 101, via a radial bearing and a thrust bearing, and the three small-diameter polishing-tool units 110 which are disposed with an equal interval in a circumferential direction on the revolution table 108 and whose shafts 113 are supported so as to be rotatable and to be movable in a radial direction via bearings.
      <br/>
      The revolution table 108 is fixed on an output shaft of a revolution-table rotation driving mechanism 107 supported on an upper yoke 102b of the supporting member 102, and is revolved at a predetermined revolution speed to cause the polishing-tool units 110 to revolve.
    </p>
    <p num="28">
      The three polishing-tool units 110 have the same configuration, which will be described with reference to FIGS. 2 through 4.
      <br/>
      The polishing-tool unit 110 includes a ring-shaped polishing pad 111 and a shaft 113.
      <br/>
      An outer cylindrical shaft 113a of the shaft 113 is disposed so as to be rotatable and to be movable in a radial direction with respect to a lower supporting member 108a formed as one body with the revolution table 108 via bearings.
      <br/>
      An inner cylindrical shaft 113b of the shaft 113 is coaxially disposed within the outer cylindrical shaft 113a so as to be rotable and to be movable in a radial direction with respect to the outer cylindrical shaft 113a via bearings 115b.
      <br/>
      Polishing-pad holding members 112a and 112b having desired diameters are formed at lower portions of the cylindrical shafts 113a and 113b, respectively, and ring-shaped polishing pads 111a and 111b are integrally mounted on the lower surfaces of the polishing-pad holding members 112a and 112b, respectively.
      <br/>
      As shown in FIGS. 2 and 3, the ring-shaped polishing pads 111a and 111b have different diameters and are coaxially arranged.
    </p>
    <p num="29">
      Rotation driving mechanisms/linear driving mechanisms 114a and 114b (or rotation/linear driving mechanisms) mounted on the revolution table 108 are connected to the upper ends of the cylindrical shafts 113a and 113b, respectively.
      <br/>
      Thus, the ring-shaped polishing pads 111a and 111b can be independently rotated at high speeds and linearly moved in radial directions by the rotation driving mechanisms/linear driving mechanisms 114a and 114b, respectively, and can be brought in contact with the surface to be polished of the substrate W with a predetermined pressure or can be separated from the surface to be polished of the substrate W.
    </p>
    <p num="30">
      The number of rotations of the two ring-shaped polishing pads 111a and 111b having different diameters can be set so as to provide the same rotational circumferential speed.
      <br/>
      That is, if the radii of the ring-shaped polishing pads 111a and 111b are represented by r1 and r2, respectively, the number of rotations of the outer rotation driving mechanism/linear driving mechanism 114a and the polishing pad 111a is represented by n1, and the number of rotations of the inner rotation driving mechanism/linear driving mechanism 114b and the polishing pad 11b is represented by n2, the numbers of rotation of the respective components are set so as to satisfy the relationship of r1 * n1 =r2 n2.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, the number of rotation of the polishing pad increases as the radius of the polishing pad decreases.
    </p>
    <p num="31">
      Next, the operation of the first embodiment will be described.
      <br/>
      When performing chemical mechanical polishing using the inner and outer ring-shaped polishing pads 111a and 111b, the substrate W is detachably held on the upper surface of the rotating table 105.
      <br/>
      Then, the slider 104 is moved in a radial direction to a position where the polishing pads 111 of the polishing-tool units 110 contact the substrate W.
    </p>
    <p num="32">
      Then, by operating the rotation driving mechanisms/linear driving mechanisms 114a, 114b the respective inner and outer ring-shaped polishing pads 111a and 111b of the polishing-tool units 110 are integrally moved downward in the axial direction toward the substrate W, and the polishing pads 111a, 111b are brought in contact with the surface to be polished of the substrate W so as to provide a predetermined processing pressure.
      <br/>
      While supplying an abrasive (polishing slurry) from abrasive (polishing slurry) supply means (not shown) between the substrate W and the polishing pads 111a, 111b, the inner and outer ring-shaped polishing pads 111a, 111b are revolved by the revolution-table rotation driving mechanism 107, and the ring-shaped polishing pads 111a and 111b are rotated at high speeds by the rotation driving mechanisms/linear driving mechanisms 114a and 114b, respectively.
      <br/>
      At the same time, the rotating table 105 is rotated and is swung in radial directions with a short stroke to perform chemical mechanical polishing.

      As described above, when polishing the substrate W by simultaneously operating the inner and outer ring-shaped polishing pads 111a and 111b of each of the polishing-tool units 110, the inner and outer ring-shaped polishing pads 111a and 111b rotate at the same circumferential speed.
      <br/>
      Hence, it is possible to increase the effective contact surface and the effective surface being polished, and to efficiently perform high-precision polishing.
    </p>
    <p num="34">In the polishing-tool unit 110 of the first embodiment, since the inner and outer ring-shaped polishing pads 111a and 111b can move with respect to each other in an axial direction, it is possible to adjust the relative heights of the polishing pads 111a and 111b, to independently adjust and set the pressures of the inner and outer ring-shaped polishing pads 111a and 111b against the surface to be polished, and therefore to set optimum processing pressures for the respective polishing pads in accordance with the state of the surface to be polished of the substrate.</p>
    <p num="35">Since the surface to be polished of the substrate is polished by partially contacting the multiplex ring-shaped polishing pads having a small diameter thereto, it is possible to rotate the polishing pads at high speeds, and to very precisely polish the surface to be polished at a high speed irrespective of the presence of a local defect on the surface to be polished.</p>
    <p num="36">Although in the foregoing description, both of the inner and outer ring-shaped polishing pads 111a and 111b are used for polishing, only one of the ring-shaped polishing pads having different diameters may be selected and brought in contact with the surface to be polished of the object to be processed to perform polishing, because the polishing pads can be relatively moved in an axial direction.</p>
    <p num="37">
      Although in the first embodiment, a duplex ring-shaped polishing pad has been illustrated as ring-shaped polishing pads, the structure of the ring-shaped polishing pads is not limited to the duplex type, but any other multiplex ring-shaped polishing pad besides the duplex-type pad may also be used.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, the number of polishing tools is not limited to 3, but any other appropriate number may be selected.
    </p>
    <p num="38">Furthermore, instead of the ring-shaped pad which is continuous along the circumference as shown in FIGS. 2 and 3, a discontinuous ring-shaped pad in which a plurality of segments are arranged along the circumference with an interval may also be used.</p>
    <p num="39">For example, a semiconductor wafer of Si, Ge, GaAs, InP or the like, or a quartz or glass substrate on the surface of which a plurality of island-like semiconductor regions are formed is suitable as an object to be processed according to the polishing method of the first embodiment.</p>
    <p num="40">
      All of the above-described substrates require a flat surface in order to form interconnections and insulating regions patterned using photolithography.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, the surface to be polished comprises an insulating film, a metal film or a surface in which an insulating film and a metal film are mixed.
    </p>
    <p num="41">It is desirable to utilize the surface of a pad made of a nonwoven fabric, foamed polyurethane or the like as the polishing surface of the polishing tool of the first embodiment.</p>
    <p num="42">
      A liquid containing fine particles is desirable as an abrasive used in the first embodiment.
      <br/>
      More specifically, it is desirable to use silica (SiO2), alumina (Al2 O3), manganese oxide (MnO2), cerium oxide (CeO) or the like for the fine particles, and to use a liquid containing NaOH, KOH, H2 O2 or the like as the liquid.
    </p>
    <p num="43">
      The diameter of the fine particles is preferably 8 nm-50 nm.

      The degree of agglomeration of the particles can be controlled, for example, by changing the value of pH of KOH.

    <p num="44">
      When polishing the surface of a semiconductor, a sodium hydroxide solution in which silica particles are dispersed is preferable.
      <br/>
      When polishing an insulating film, a potassium hydroxide solution in which silica particles are dispersed is preferable.
      <br/>
      When polishing a metal film of tungsten or the like, an aqueous solution of hydrogen peroxide in which alumina or manganese oxide particles are dispersed is preferable.
    </p>
    <p num="45">
      For example, when polishing the surface of a semiconductor, if an aqueous solution of NaOH in which silica particles are dispersed is used as the abrasive, the surface of silicon reacts on NaOH to form a Na2 SiO3 layer.
      <br/>
      The reaction proceeds by removing the formed layer by mechanical polishing by the silica particles and a polishing cloth to expose a new silicon surface.
