    <p num="14">
      A co-pending U.S. patent application was filed on Oct. 27, 1999, with the Ser.
      <br/>
      No. 09/432,065, and is taken as a reference to the present invention.
    </p>
    <p num="15">
      Referring to the drawings, and initially to FIGS. 1-3, a punching aid in accordance with the present invention comprises a base 10 including a chamber 11 formed therein for receiving fluids and including a mouth 12 formed in the upper middle portion thereof (FIGS. 1, 3, 5) and communicating with the chamber 11 of the base 10 for receiving the fluids, such as the water, any suitable liquid, or other particulate materials, such as sand, gravel, coated or uncoated metallic shot and the like, to give the punching aid stability.
      <br/>
      A cap 13 is detachably secured onto the mouth 12 of the base 10 for enclosing the chamber 11 of the base 10 and for confining the fluids within the base 10.
      <br/>
      The mouth and the cap 13 may also be formed in the upper side portion of the base 10 for filing the weight materials into the chamber 11 of the base 10.
      <br/>

      The most important characteristic for the punching aid is that the flexible device 40 has the upper and the lower portions coupled to the column 20 and the base 10 respectively.
      <br/>
      None of the arts may provide a flexible device 40 directly coupled to the base 10 and the column 20.
      <br/>
      Although the flexible device 40 is shown to be coupled to the base 10 and the column 20 with the engagement between the stud and the coupler, the flexible device 40 may also be directly coupled to the base and the column with fasteners without the studs and the couplers.
      <br/>
      The column 20 and the pad 30 and/or the flexible device 40 may be detached or disengaged from the base 10 such that the column of the punching aid may be greatly decreased for facilitating the storing and the transportation thereof.
