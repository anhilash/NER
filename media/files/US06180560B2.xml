      An aromatic carboxylic acid compound serving as the above-mentioned compound (A) and the producing method thereof are also disclosed.

  <description format="original" lang="en" id="desc_en">
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="1">
      1.
      <br/>
      Field of the Invention
    </p>
    <p num="2">
      The present invention relates to a thermosensitive recording material comprising as the main components a leuco dye serving as a coloring agent and a color developer capable of inducing color formation in the leuco dye upon application of heat thereto.
      <br/>
      In addition, the present invention also relates to an aromatic carboxylic acid compound useful as the color developer for use in the thermosensitive recording material, and the production method of the above-mentioned compound.
    </p>
    <p num="3">2. Discussion of Background</p>
    <p num="4">
      Generally, a thermosensitive recording material comprises a support and a thermosensitive coloring layer formed thereon, which comprises as the main components a colorless or light colored electron-donating dye precursor, and an electron-accepting color developer.
      <br/>
      These dye precursor and color developer are caused to react instantaneously upon the application of heat thereto to produce recorded images, for instance, using a thermal head, heat pen or laser beam, as disclosed in Japanese Patent Publications 43-4160 and 45-14039.
    </p>
    <p num="5">A thermosensitive recording material is used in a wide variety of fields, for example, as the recording material for an electronic computer, facsimile apparatus, ticket vending apparatus, label printer, and recorder because it has the advantages that recording can be achieved using a relatively simple apparatus, maintenance is simple, and there is no noise development.</p>
    <p num="6">
      The above-mentioned thermosensitive recording material employing such an electron-donating dye precursor and an electron-accepting color developer has excellent characteristics such as good appearance and nice touch and is capable of producing images with high coloring density, but also has the disadvantage that the image preservability thereof is poor.
      <br/>
      To be more specific, when image areas formed in the thermosensitive recording material come in contact with plastics such as polyvinyl chloride, images are decolorized by plasticizers and additives contained in such plastics, or when the image areas come in contact with chemicals contained in foods or cosmetics, such image areas are easily decolorized or the background is easily colored.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      To improve the preservation stability of the image recorded in the thermosensitive recording material, it is proposed to use color developers with high reliability.
      <br/>
      For instance, the use of a phenolsulfone compound as the color developer is disclosed in Japanese Laid-Open Patent Applications 58-82788 and 60-13852; a metallic salt of benzoic acid, disclosed in Japanese Laid-Open Patent Application 61-47292; and a substituted salicylic acid compound, disclosed in Japanese Laid-Open Patent Application 62-169681.
      <br/>
      However, even though the aforementioned compounds are used as the color developers, the fastness to plasticizers of the image areas formed in the thermosensitive recording material is not sufficient.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      Furthermore, the use of a monoester of nitrophthalic acid is proposed in Japanese Laid-Open Patent Application 62-80089, but this compound is unsatisfactory in terms of the fastness to plasticizers of the image areas formed in the thermosensitive recording material.
      <br/>
      In addition, a sulfonylurea-group-containing compound is used as the color developer in Japanese Laid-Open Patent Application 6-255262.
      <br/>
      When this type of compound is used as the color developer, the coloring sensitivity extremely deteriorates although the fastness to plasticizers of the image area is improved.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      In Japanese Laid-Open Patent Application 9-267566, it is proposed to use as the color developer a compound excluded in the present invention, that is, a compound (B) as will be described in detail later, and metallic salts thereof.
      <br/>
      However, these compounds have the shortcomings that the image area formed in the thermosensitive recording material is readily decolorized under the circumstances of high temperature.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      By the way, it is believed that synthesis of a nitrophthalamide dimer, in particular, a 3-nitrophthalamide dimer can be achieved by amidation reaction of 3-nitrophthalic acid by use of an amine compound.
      <br/>
      A reaction between 3-nitrophthalic anhydride and an amine compound is reported, for example, in IDDIAN J. CHEM., VOL. 7, 634-635 (1969) and J. Am. Chem. Soc., Vol. 57, 1064-1065 (1935).
      <br/>
      According to those references, as shown in the following reaction schemes (1) and (2), the amidation reaction of 3-nitrophthalic anhydride takes place at the 1-position of 3-nitrophthalic acid due to steric hindrance when an aromatic primary amine such as aniline is used as the amine compound; while the amidation reaction is carried out at the 2-position thereof when ammonium is used as the amine compound because this reaction is less subjected to steric hindrance.
    </p>
    <p num="11">�Reaction Schemes�  (Chemical Structure image '1' not included in text)</p>
    <p num="12">It is considered that the difference in reactivity as shown in the reaction schemes (1) and (2) results from the steric hindrance caused when carbonyl group in 3-nitrophthalic anhydride is attacked by an amine compound.</p>
    <p num="13">When 3-nitrophthalamide dimers of the following formulas (V) and (VI) were separately synthesized by allowing 3-nitrophthalic anhydride to react with a diamine compound under the same conditions as stated in the aforementioned references, there was obtained a mixture of the isomers of formulas (V) and (VI).  (Chemical Structure image '2' not included in text)</p>
    <p num="14">wherein Y represents, for example, an alkylene group having 2 to 12 carbon atoms, a xylylene group,  (Chemical Structure image '3' not included in text)</p>
    <p num="15">In this case, although those two 3-nitrophthalamide dimers (V) and (VI) can be isolated from each other, each compound cannot be efficiently obtained as a pure product because the separation is very difficult.</p>
    <p num="16">Further, the aforementioned 3-nitrophthalamide dimers (V) and (VI) can be independently synthesized in accordance with the following reaction schemes (3) and (4):</p>
    <p num="17">�Reaction Schemes�  (Chemical Structure image '4' not included in text)</p>
    <p num="18">
      However, the above-mentioned reaction schemes (3) and (4) are very long and include complicated reaction steps, so that they are not practical.
      <br/>
      There is increasing a demand for the establishment of efficient synthesis method.
    </p>

      The aromatic carboxylic acid compounds represented by formula (I) according to the present invention are novel compounds.
      <br/>
      When the compounds of formula (I) are used as the color developers in the thermosensitive recording material, the oil resistance, the plasticizer resistance and the heat resistance of an image area formed in the recording material are improved.
      <br/>
      The reason for this improvement has not been clarified, but it is considered that the following factors (1) to (4) contribute to the improvement of the preservation stability of the recorded image area:
      <br/>
      (1) The affinity of the color developer for a leuco dye is increased when an electron-donating group is present in the above-mentioned compound of formula (I).
      <br/>
      (2) When the compound of formula (I) has a substituent such as an electron-attracting group, the compound becomes a strong acid, and the color development performance of the compound is improved.
      <br/>
      (3) Since two or more aromatic carboxylic acid moieties are contained in one molecule of the color developer compound, the molecular weight is increased, and therefore, the solubility of the color developer in plasticizers is decreased.
      <br/>
      (4) Since two or more aromatic carboxylic acid moieties are contained in one molecule of the color developer compound, the molecule of the color developer becomes so bulky as to surround a molecule of a leuco dye compound.
    </p>
    <p num="59">The aromatic carboxylic acid compound of formula (I) can be produced in accordance with the following reaction scheme:  (Chemical Structure image '803' not included in text)</p>
    <p num="60">wherein R1, R2 and X are the same as those previously defined.</p>
    <p num="61">In the present invention, an aromatic carboxylic acid compound of formula (I') can be produced by allowing a nitrophthalic anhydride of formula (II) to react with a compound of formula (III):  (Chemical Structure image '804' not included in text)</p>
    <p num="62">wherein Y is an alkylene group having 2 to 12 carbon atoms, a xylylene group,  (Chemical Structure image '805' not included in text)   (Chemical Structure image '806' not included in text)</p>
    <p num="63">wherein X is --NHYHN-- group in which Y is the same as that previously defined.</p>
    <p num="64">Further, there is provided a method of producing an aromatic carboxylic acid compound of formula (V):  (Chemical Structure image '807' not included in text)</p>
    <p num="65">
      wherein Y is the same as that previously defined, comprising the step of allowing 3-nitrophthalic anhydride to react with a diamine compound of formula (IV) using a reaction solvent selected from the group consisting of acetic acid, tetrahydrofuran and nitrobenzene:
      <br/>
      H2 N--Y--NH2  (IV)
    </p>
    <p num="66">wherein Y is the same as that previously defined.</p>
    <p num="67">By the above-mentioned synthesis method, the aromatic carboxylic acid compound of formula (V), that is, a 3-nitrophthalamide dimer, can be efficiently produced as a pure product.</p>
    <p num="68">In addition, there is also provided a method of producing an aromatic carboxylic acid compound of formula (VI), which method comprises the steps of dissolving 3-nitrophthalic anhydride in acetic anhydride to prepare an acetic anhydride solution of 3-nitrophthalic anhydride, and adding a diamine compound (H2 N--Y--NH2) in small portions to the acetic anhydride solution so as to dissolve the diamine compound therein:  (Chemical Structure image '808' not included in text)</p>
    <p num="69">wherein Y is the same as that previously defined.</p>
    <p num="70">In this case, although the aromatic carboxylic acid compound of formula (VI) can be efficiently produced in relatively high yields, a trace amount of the compound represented by formula (V) is simultaneously generated as the by-product.</p>
    <p num="71">
      To obtain the compound of formula (VI) in a pure product, the following separating and purification step is effective.
      <br/>
      Namely, the compound of formula (VI) can be preferentially extracted from a mixture of the reaction products, namely, the aromatic carboxylic acid compounds of formulas (V) and (VI) with a mixed solvent of water and an alcohol.
      <br/>
      In the present invention, ethyl alcohol is preferably used for the preparation of the mixed solvent.
      <br/>
      In such a case, it is preferable that the ratio by volume of water to ethyl alcohol for use in the mixed solvent be in the range of 60:40 to 70:30.
    </p>
    <p num="72">Thus, the aromatic carboxylic acid compounds of formulas (V) and (VI) can be selectively and efficiently synthesized from the reaction between 3-nitrophthalic anhydride and a diamine compound.</p>
    <p num="73">
      As the leuco dye for use in the present invention, which may be employed alone or in combination, any conventional dyes for use in the conventional leuco-dye-containing recording materials can be employed.

    <p num="85">Examples of the lubricant for use in the present invention include higher fatty acids and amides, esters and metallic salts thereof; and a variety of waxes such as an animal wax, a vegetable wax, a mineral wax, and a petroleum wax.</p>
    <p num="86">When the thermosensitive coloring layer coating liquid comprising the compound (A) is coated and dried to provide the thermosensitive coloring layer, it is proper that the content of compound (A) serving as the color developer, for example, the aromatic carboxylic acid compound of formula (I), be in the range of 1 to 5 g/m2, preferably 1 to 2 g/m2 on a dry basis.</p>

      It is preferable that the thermosensitive recording material of the present invention further comprise an intermediate layer comprising as the main component plastic void particles in the form of sphere, which is provided between the support and the thermosensitive coloring layer.
      <br/>
      This intermediate layer serves as a heat-insulating layer.
      <br/>
      Owing to the intermediate layer, therefore, thermal energy supplied by a thermal head can efficiently be utilized, thereby improving the thermosensitivity of the recording material.
    </p>
    <p num="88">
      In particular, when the average particle diameter of the plastic void particles for use in the intermediate layer is in the range of 0.2 to 20  MU m and the voidage thereof is 40% or more, the flexibility of the intermediate layer is increased.
      <br/>
      As a result, the adhesion between the thermosensitive recording material and the thermal head is improved, and therefore, dot reproduction performance becomes excellent.
    </p>
    <p num="89">
      The void particles for use in the intermediate layer comprise a thermoplastic resin for forming a shell of each void particle.
      <br/>
      Air or other gasses are contained in the void particles in the expanded state.

    <p num="90">
      It is preferable that the average particle diameter of the void particles be in the range of about 0.2 to 20  MU m, as mentioned above.
      <br/>
      When the particle size of the void particles is within the above range, there is no problem in the production of the intermediate layer because the voidage of the void particles can freely be determined.
      <br/>
      In addition, the surface smoothness of the intermediate layer is not decreased after coating and drying the liquid comprising the void particles, so that the adhesion of the thermosensitive coloring layer to the thermal head does not lower, and consequently, deterioration of the thermosensitivity of the recording material can be avoided.
      <br/>
      Further, it is preferable that the void particles classified in a narrow distribution be employed in the intermediate layer.
    </p>
    <p num="91">
      It is preferable that the voidage of the void particles for use in the intermediate layer be 40% or more, and more preferably 90% or more, from the viewpoint of the heat insulating effect.
      <br/>
      In the present invention, the voidage of the void particles for use in the intermediate layer is expressed by the following formula:  (Equation image '1' not included in text)
    </p>
    <p num="92">
      When the voidage is within the above range, sufficient heat insulating effect of the intermediate layer can be obtained, so that the thermal energy supplied by the thermal head can be inhibited from escaping through the support of the thermosensitive recording material.
      <br/>
      As a result, the thermosensitivity-improving effect can be increased.
    </p>
    <p num="93">
      Specific examples of the thermoplastic resin for forming a shell of the void particle are polystyrene, polyvinyl chloride, polyvinylidene chloride, polyvinyl acetate, polyacrylate, polyacrylonitrile, polybutadiene, and copolymer resin thereof.
      <br/>
      Of those thermoplastic resins, a copolymer resin comprising as the main component vinylidene chloride or acrylonitrile is preferably employed in the present invention.

    <p num="94">A binder resin for the formation of the above-mentioned intermediate layer may be appropriately selected from the conventional water-soluble polymers and aqueous polymeric emulsions.</p>
    <p num="95">Specific examples of the binder agent for use in the intermediate layer include water-soluble polymers such as polyvinyl alcohol, starch and starch derivatives, cellulose derivatives such as methoxy cellulose, hydroxyethyl cellulose, carboxymethyl cellulose, methyl cellulose and ethyl cellulose, sodium polyacrylate, polyvinyl pyrrolidone, acrylamide-acrylic ester copolymer, acrylamide-acrylic ester-methacrylic acid terpolymer, alkali salts of styrene-maleic anhydride copolymer, alkali salts of isobutylene-maleic anhydride copolymer, polyacrylamide, sodium alginate, gelatin, and casein; and aqueous polymeric emulsions, for example, latexes such as styrene-butadiene copolymer and styrene-butadiene-acryl copolymer and emulsions such as vinyl acetate resin, vinyl acetate-acrylic acid copolymer, styrene-acrylic ester copolymer, acrylate resin, and polyurethane resin.</p>
    <p num="96">
      In the intermediate layer for use in the present invention, the previously mentioned minute void particles and binder resin may be used in combination with auxiliary additive components such as a filler, a thermofusible material and a surface active agent, which are used in the conventional thermosensitive recording materials.
      <br/>
      Specific examples of the filler and the thermofusible material are the same as those mentioned in the description of the thermosensitive coloring layer.
    </p>
    <p num="97">Furthermore, in the present invention, an additional layer comprising a pigment, a binder agent and a thermofusible material may be interposed between the intermediate layer and the thermosensitive coloring layer when necessary.</p>
    <p num="98">
      In addition, the thermosensitive recording material may further comprise a protective layer which is formed on the thermosensitive coloring layer in order to improve the head-matching properties of the thermosensitive recording material with the thermal head, improve the preservation stability of the recorded images and improve the writing and printing quality of the recording material.
      <br/>
      In this case, the protective layer comprises the previously mentioned filler, binder resin and thermofusible material.

    <p num="99">
      The thermosensitive recording material of the present invention is usable in any fields that employ the conventional thermosensitive recording materials.

      For instance, the thermosensitive recording material can be used as a paper for facsimile apparatus, a point-of-sales (POS) label for food, a bar code label for industrial applications, a thermosensitive recording adhesive label of liner-less type, a ticket paper, a magnetic ticket paper, a paper for CAD, and a transparent thermosensitive film.
