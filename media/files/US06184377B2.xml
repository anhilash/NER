    <p num="3">2. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</p>
    <p num="4">
      There is a great interest in synthetic methods directed toward the creation of large collections of small organic compounds, or libraries, which could be screened for pharmacological, biological or other activity.
      <br/>
      Often referred to as combinatorial chemistry, the synthetic methods applied to create vast combinatorial libraries are performed in solution or in the solid phase, i.e., on a solid support.
      <br/>
      Further, solid-phase synthesis makes it easier to conduct multi-step reactions and to drive reactions to completion with high yields because excess reagents can be easily added and washed away after each reaction step.
      <br/>
      Solid-phase combinatorial synthesis also tends to improve isolation, purification and screening.
      <br/>
      However, the more traditional solution phase chemistry supports a wider variety of organic reactions than solid-phase chemistry.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      Typically, combinatorial methods involve the addition of various structural components sequentially, either in a controlled or random manner to a core chemical structure in order to produce all or a substantial portion of the possible combinations that can result from the different possible reactions at each stage.
      <br/>
      The efficient use of this technique can create thousands of compounds for pharmacological screening in a rapid fashion.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      Methods for screening libraries of compounds for binding properties to a receptor include methods wherein each member of the library is tagged with a unique identifier to facilitate identification of compounds having binding properties, or where the library comprises a plurality of compounds synthesized at particular locations on the surface of a solid substrate.
      <br/>
      The receptor may be appropriately labelled with a radioactive or fluorescent label that enables one to ascertain whether binding to the receptor of interest has occurred.
      <br/>
      Correlation of the labelled receptor bound to the substrate, which has its location on the substrate, identifies the binding ligand as disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,143,854.
    </p>
    <p num="7">In contrast to the standard combinatorial chemistry approach which results in libraries with maximum diversity, there is a trend toward the design of more targeted libraries, particularly of small compounds, which minimize redundancy and improve screening efficiency.</p>
    <p num="8">
      One particular class of compounds that would be useful for inclusion in targeted libraries is quinazolinone compounds such as N-hydroxy-quinazolinones and derivatives thereof.
      <br/>
      Quinazolinone compounds possess a diverse array of beneficial pharmaceutical and chemical properties.
      <br/>
      For example, certain quinazolinones are known to possess antipyretic, hypotensive, antibacterial, antifungal or central nervous system (CNS) activity, as well as the ability to inhibit enzymes of biological importance, such as metalloenzymes.
    </p>
    <p num="9">C. Schapira and S. Lamdan (J. Heterocyclic Chem., 9:569-576 (1972)) disclose the action of various simple acylating agents on 2-aminobenzohydroxamic acid, which afforded 3-hydroxy-4(3H)-quinazolinones (hydroxamic acids), as well as several ethers and esters derived therefrom.</p>

      H. Kohl and E. Wolf (Liebigs Ann.

      M. Ghelardoni and V. Pestellini (Annali di Chimica, 64:445-453 (1974)) disclose the synthesis of fused-ring systems containing the 4-quinazolone nucleus.
      <br/>
      These compounds are obtained by condensation of o-aminobenzoylhydrazine or o-aminobenzohydroxamic acid with compounds containing both carbonyl and carboxyl groups, such as phthalaldehydic acid or levulinic acid, or with cyclic anhydrides, such as phthalic anhydride or succinic anhydride.

      K. Tanaka et al. (Chem. Pharm. Bull., 36(7):2323-2330 (1988)) disclose the synthesis of 3-Hydroxy-4-oxo-3,4 dihydroquinazolinones, which exhibited metal chelating abilities, analgesic activities, and inhibition of the growth of microorganisms.
      <br/>
      The 3-hydroxy-4-oxo-3,4-dihydroquinazolinones were prepared, for example, by reacting a 2-aminobenzohydroxamic acid with acetic anhydride or formic acid.
    </p>
    <p num="13">
      Although, a variety of syntheses of quinazolinones using solution-phase techniques have been reported, there is a need for a general method of synthesis of such compounds, especially in the solid phase.
      <br/>
      In other words, there is a need for a solid-phase synthesis that allows one to synthesize a multiplicity of quinazolinones on a variety of solid supports, as well as a need for preparing and screening a library of quinazolinones for pharmacological or biological activities.
    </p>
    <p num="14">Accordingly, there is a need in the art for an efficient method for obtaining a library of N-hydroxy- and N-amino quinazolinones, particularly 3-hydroxy-quinazolinones and 3-amino-quinazolinones, wherein the starting materials are amenable to large scale synthesis.</p>

    <p num="16">3. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</p>
    <p num="17">
      The present invention is directed to synthesis of N-amino and N-hydroxy-quinazolinone compounds on solid supports.
      <br/>
      The use of solid support in the present invention both allows for protection of the N-moiety and facilitates purification and/or isolation.
      <br/>
      The synthesis of the instant invention is particularly useful since mild conditions are involved.
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      In general terms, the invention involves the coupling of a substituted or unsubstituted isatoic anhydride to a solid support, preferably a solid support containing a hydrazino or hydroxylamine moiety that is available for reaction.
      <br/>
      This coupling reaction forms a 2-aminobenzamide which is bound to the solid support via the amide-nitrogen, thereby both protecting and anchoring the 2-aminobenzamide.
      <br/>
      The bound 2-aminobenzamide is subsequently reacted with a compound of the formula
      <br/>
      R2 --CHY--CO--X
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      or
      <br/>
      W--CO--X
    </p>
    <p num="20">
      wherein X is OH, Cl, F, Br or a carboxylic acid activating group; Y is NR3 R4 where NR3 R4 is an N-protected-amino acid, or Cl, Br, or F and R2 is a substituted or unsubstituted alkyl, aryl, alkylaryl group and W is a heterocyclic group to form a cyclized compound, i.e., a quinazolinone.
      <br/>
      It should be recognized that a variety of quinazolinone can be prepared depending upon the compound chosen for coupling.
      <br/>
      Further, the resulting solid-phase bound product can either be further modified or simply cleaved, or both.
      <br/>
      Thus, a vast number of quinazolinone compounds can be prepared and screened for potential biological activity.
      <br/>
      In certain embodiments, the resin-bound 2-aminobenzamide is reacted with a carboxylic acid or activated form thereof which is represented by the formula:
      <br/>
      R2 --CHY--CO--X

      <br/>
      FIG. 1 illustrates the synthesis of an N-hydroxy-quinazolinone of the present invention by preparing a 2-aminobenzamide on a solid support by reacting a hydroxylamine O-protected resin with an isatoic anhydride in the presence of an basic catalyst, and reacting the 2-aminobenzamide with an Fmoc-protected amino acid and removing the Fmoc protecting group to afford an amino-quinazolinone bound to the resin. The amino group can then either be (i) acylated with an acyl chloride in the presence of diisopropylethylamine or (ii) converted to a sulfonamide with a sulfonyl chloride in the presence of a diisopropylethylamine or (iii) reacted with an Fmoc or t-Boc protected amino acid in the presence of a coupling agent to yield an amide or (iv) alkylated with an alkyl halide or (v) reacted with an isocyanate to form a urea. The products of (i), (ii), or (iii) above may be cleaved from the solid support under acidic conditions to yield an amino-substituted N-hydroxy-4(1H)-quinazolinone.
      <br/>
      FIG. 2 illustrates the synthesis of 2-substituted N-hydroxy-quinazolinones of the present invention by preparing a 2-amino-benzamide on a solid support by reacting a hydroxylamine O-protected resin with an isatoic anhydride in the presence of a basic catalyst and reacting the 2-aminobenzamide with an alpha-halo acid chloride or an alpha-halo carboxylic acid. The corresponding alpha-halo-quinazolinone is (i) reacted with an appropriate nucleophile to displace the halide, such as an amine or sulfur nucleophile, yielding the substituted derivative or (ii) reacted with triphenylphosphine to form the corresponding Wittig salt. The Wittig salt can then be reacted with an aldehyde or ketone to form a 2-alkenyl-quinazolinone. The products of (i) or (ii) above may be cleaved from the solid support under acidic conditions to yield the desired products.
      <br/>
      FIG. 3 illustrates the synthesis of 2-substituted N-amino-quinazolinones of the present invention by preparing a 1,2 disubstituted anthraniloylhydrazine on a solid support by reacting (1) the Wang resin with 1,1'-carbonyldiimidazole and (2) reacting the corresponding immidazolide with hydrazine to yield the carbazate and (3) reacting the carbazate with an isatoic anhydride in the presence of a basic catalyst such as dimethylaminopyridine. The 1,2 disubstituted anthraniloylhydrazine bound to the solid support is then reacted with the appropriate carboxylic acid in the presence of an appropriate coupling reagent such as bromo-tris-pyrrolidinophosphonium hexafluorophosphate (PyBrOP) to yield the corresponding 2-substituted-hydrazido-quinazolinones bound to the solid support. Cleavage from the solid support can be effected under acidic conditions to yield the corresponding N-amino-quinazolinones of the present invention.
      <br/>
      FIGS. 4 and 5 illustrate the preparation of a 5760-member library of 3-hydroxyquinazolinones by reacting a N-hydroxylamine on a Wang resin with fifteen isatoic anhydrides, followed by hydrolysis to the corresponding N-hydroxybenzamide. The fifteen N-hydroxybenzamides are divided into five groups and reacted with sixteen Fmoc-aminoacids, followed by cleavage of the Fmoc group to give eighty groups of free aminoquinazlinones on resins. Each of the 80 groups of resins are then evenly distributed into 24 wells of a reactor block. To each well is added eight chloroformates, eight sulfonyl chlorides and eight isocyanates yielding 1,920 wells of quinazolinones (3 compounds per well) as resins. The 1,920 wells of quinozolinanes were then treated with trifluoroacetic acid to remove the resin, yielding a library of 5,760 N-hydroxy quinazolinones.

    <p num="29">5. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</p>
    <p num="30">
      The present invention provides a reliable, high yielding synthetic method to prepare a large number of N-amino and hydroxy-4(1H)-quinazolinones via the base catalyzed cyclization of the appropriate 2-aminobenzamide with acyl halides or carboxylic acids under mild conditions.
      <br/>
      This reaction design facilitates purification, has high reliability and has high yield, which are achieved by use of a solid support as a protecting group.
      <br/>
      This solid-phase synthetic method also facilitates the assembly of combinatorial libraries of the N-amino- and N-hydroxy-4(1H)-quinazolinone pharmacophore, which permit rapid and efficient screening of tens, hundreds, and up to thousands of N-amino- and N-hydroxy-4(1H)-quinazolinones for pharmacological activity.
      <br/>
      The solid-phase or resin bound molecules can also be further substituted or simply isolated and screened.
    </p>
    <p num="31">
      Generally, the compounds of this invention are organic compounds where the serial synthesis involves the addition or removal of chemical units, reactions involving the modification or introduction of one or more functionalities, ring openings, ring closings, etc.
      <br/>
      Chemical units can take many forms, both naturally-occurring and synthetic, such as nucleophiles, electrophiles, dienes, alkylating or acylating agents, diamines, nucleotides, amino acids, sugars, lipids, or derivatives thereof, organic monomers, and combinations thereof.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, reactions may be involved that result in alkylation, acylation, nitration, halogenation, oxidation, reduction, hydrolysis, substitution, elimination, addition, and the like.
    </p>
    <p num="32">
      In some instances, one may wish to have the same or different blocks introduced at the same or different stages.
      <br/>
      For example, one may wish to have a common functional unit, e.g., a 2-aminobenzamide introduced during the synthesis.
      <br/>
      In this manner one may achieve a molecular context into which the variation is introduced.
      <br/>
      These situations may involve only a few stages having a plurality of choices, where a large number of products are produced in relation to a particular functional entity.
      <br/>
      This could have particular application where one is interested in a large number of derivatives related to a core molecule or unit known to have a characteristic of interest, and advantageously permits formation of an array, or library, of compounds.
    </p>
    <p num="33">
      In developing synthetic strategies, one can provide for batch synthesis of a few compounds to be prepared during the course of the combinatorial synthesis.
      <br/>
      For example, such as syntheses involving steric hindrance, charge and/or dipole interactions, alternative reaction pathways, or the like, one can optimize conditions to provide for enhanced yields of compounds that might not otherwise be formed or be formed only in low yield.
      <br/>
      In this manner, one may allow for a variety of reaction conditions during the combinatorial synthesis, involving differences in solvent, temperatures, times, concentrations, and the like.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, one may use batch synthesis, which will provide much higher concentrations of particular products than combinatorial synthesis, to develop assays to characterize the activity of the compounds.
    </p>
    <p num="34">The invention further relates to a combinatorial library of compounds comprising q different compounds, wherein each of the compounds is prepared according to the methods discussed above having the Formula (II) comprising:  (Chemical Structure image '2' not included in text)</p>
    <p num="35">
      wherein q is an integer greater than 1 which represents the total number of molecules in the library.

      In a preferred embodiment, each compound in the library is novel.

    <p num="36">The invention also relates to an "m times p" array of molecules comprising q compounds having the Formula (II).</p>

      wherein R1 is an independently selected mono-, di-, tri-, or quad-substituent on the phenyl ring, and where R1 is independently hydrogen, halogen, C1 -C6 alkyl, C1 -C6 alkenyl, hydroxy, C1 -C6 alkoxy, NO2, SO2 Ph, phenyl, SO2 NR3 R4, OCOR5, SR5, CO2 R5 ; NHCOR5 ; or R1, when disubstituted, can be taken together to form a 5, 6 or 7 membered carbocyclic aromatic group or heterocyclic aromatic group wherein the heterocyclic aromatic group is selected from the group consisting of furo, thieno, pyrido, pyrrolo, oxazolo, thiazolo, imidazolo, pyrazolo, isoxazolo, isothiazolo, pyridazino, pyrimidino, pyrazino, and indolo;
      <br/>
      R2 is branched or straight chain C1 -C6 alkyl, C1 -C6 alkoxy, a nitrogen-protected amino acid, phenyl, benzyl, C1 -C6 alkenyl, hydroxy, SO2 Ph, SO2 NR3 R4, NR3 R4, OCOR5, SR5, CO2 R5, NHCOR5, or a heterocyclic aromatic group, whereby R2 is unsubstituted or substituted.

      <br/>
      R5 is C1 -C6 alkyl, benzyl, phenyl, or, substituted phenyl with 1-3 substituents independently selected from the group consisting of C1 -C6 alkoxy, NO2, CF3, or CN; and

    <p num="39">Preferably, the array is such that m and p are each an integer between 1 and 25, and q is equal to m multiplied by p. The invention also relates to an m times p array of compartments containing these molecules.</p>
    <p num="40">
      The invention also includes pharmaceutical compositions including these compounds, and methods of administering a therapeutically effective amount of the pharmaceutical compositions, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof.
      <br/>
      Such pharmaceutical compositions and methods of administering the same are discussed further herein.
      <br/>
      These pharmaceutical compositions include the compounds discussed herein in a pharmaceutically acceptable format.
      <br/>
      Typically, this includes a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and a therapeutically effective amount of the N-hydroxy-quinazolinone compound, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof.
    </p>
    <p num="41">The present invention also relates to a solid phase reaction component comprising a solid support substantially insoluble in aqueous or organic reaction media, carrying a plurality of covalently bound hydroxylamines available for reaction with the substrate.</p>
    <p num="42">
      Suitable solid supports include those known in the art of solid phase synthesis.
      <br/>
      Some known supports, for example, are described in J. Stewart and J. Young (Solid Phase Peptide Synthesis, 2nd Ed., Pierce Chemical Company; Rockford, Ill., 1984), which is incorporated herein by reference thereto.
      <br/>
      They include inorganic substrates, for example, kieselguhr, silica gel and controlled pore glass, and polymeric organic substrates, for example, polystyrene, polypropylene, polethyleneglycol, polyacrylamide, cellulose, as well as composite inorganic/polymeric substrates, such as polyacrylamide supported within a matrix of kieselguhr particles.
      <br/>
      Such known solid supports include carboxy and acyl halide functionalized solid supports, such as those which are chemically modified by introduction of carboxylic acid or acyl halide groups, to serve as convenient points for further chemical manipulation.
    </p>
    <p num="43">The solid phase reaction components of the present invention include a solid support, as described above, and a clearable linker or linker arm which presents the carboxylic acid or acyl halide moiety of the hydroxamate group for reaction with the first reactive entity in the proposed synthesis.</p>
    <p num="44">
      As used in this application, the term "linker" means a chemical moiety which may possess a variety of properties.
      <br/>
      First, it is attachable to a solid support.
      <br/>
      Second, it is cleavable from the solid support such that when it is cleaved, the desired compound may be released from the solid support.
      <br/>
      These properties may be embodied by a single chemical structure.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, these properties may be embodied in multiple chemical structures which are linked together by covalent bonds or by other means.
    </p>
    <p num="45">
      When detachment of the product from the solid support is desired, there are numerous functionalities and reactants which may be used.
      <br/>
      Conveniently, ethers may be used, where substituted benzyl ether or derivatives thereof, e.g., benzhydryl ether and indanyl ether, may be cleaved by acidic or mild reductive conditions.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, one may employ  BETA -elimination, where a mild base may serve to release the product.
      <br/>
      Acetals, including the thio analogs thereof, may be employed, where mild acid, particularly in the presence of a capturing carbonyl compound, is preferred.
      <br/>
      By combining formaldehyde, HCl, and an alcohol moiety, an  ALPHA -chloroether is formed.
      <br/>
      This chloroether may then be coupled with an hydroxy functionality on the solid support to form the acetal.
      <br/>
      Various photolabile linkages may be employed, such as o-nitrobenzyl, 7-nitroindanyl, 2-nitrobenzhydryl ethers or esters, for example.
      <br/>
      Esters and amides may serve as linkers, where half-acid esters or amides are formed, particularly with cyclic anhydrides, followed by reaction with hydroxyl or amino functionalities on the solid support, using a coupling agent such as a carbodiimide.
      <br/>
      Peptides may be used as linkers, where the sequence is subject to enzymatic hydrolysis, particularly where the coenzyme recognizes a specific sequence.
      <br/>
      Carbonates and carbamates may be prepared using carbonic acid, base or a strong reductant, e.g., LiAlH4, particularly for the carbonate esters.
      <br/>

    <p num="50">
      In this embodiment, precursor compounds of the Formula (I) are linked to the solid support via a cleavable linker, i.e., the oxygen.
      <br/>
      It will be apparent that the cleavable linker may be incorporated during synthesis of the solid phase reaction component of the invention by starting with a preferred solid support, such as hydroxymethyl polystyrene, 4-(Hydroxymethyl)phenoxymethyl-copoly(styrene-1% divinylbenzene)-resin (100-200 mesh, "WANG" resin), hydroxymethyl copoly(styrene-1% divinylbenzene), benzhydrylaminepolystyrene, benzyhydrylamine copoly(styrene-1% divinylbenzene (commercially available as "BHA Resin"), methyl benzhydryl aminepolystyrene, methyl benzhydrylamine copoly(styrene-1% divinylbenzene (commercially available as "MBHA Resin"); polyethylene glycol polystyrene ("PEG-PS"); poly(dimethylacrylamide)polystyrene composite (commercially available as "POLYHIPE"); polyacrylamide Kieselguhr composite (commercially available as "MACROSORB"); or functionalized controlled pore glass.
      <br/>
      The preferred solid supports are Wang Resin and the BHA resin.
      <br/>
      A more preferred solid phase reaction component of the present invention uses 4-(hydroxymethyl)-phenoxymethylcopoly(styrene-1divinylbenzene)-resin (100-200 mesh, "WANG" resin) as the solid support.
    </p>
    <p num="51">The solid-phase reaction components of the invention will generally be accessible (i) by displacement of the hydroxyl group on the solid support by N-hydroxyphthalimide in the presence of triphenyl phosphine and diethyl azodicarboxylate or by displacement of a leaving group (e.g. mesylate or triflate) with N-hydroxyphthalimide in the presence of a strong base (e.g. sodium hydride) followed by (ii) removal of the phthalimide protecting group with hydrazine hydrate affording an O-solid supported N-hydroxylamine.</p>
    <p num="52">
      The amine moiety of the O-solid supported N-hydroxyl amine is then reacted with a diverse array of isatoic anhydrides to produce the corresponding 2-amino-hydroxybenzamides bound to the solid support.
      <br/>
      The isatoic anhydrides are either commercially available from, for example, Aldrich Chemical Co. or may be generally synthesized from the reaction of a diverse array of anthranilic acids with triphosgene in tetrahydrofuran at room temperature followed by cooling to 0 (degree)  C. to precipitate the desired isatoic anhydride.
      <br/>
      For example, treatment of the isatoic anhydride with the O-solid supported N-hydroxyl amine in the presence of a basic catalyst such as dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP) in dry dimethylformamide at about 60-70 (degree)  C. for about 24-60 hours afforded the corresponding 2-amino-N-alkoxybenzamide on the solid support.

    <p num="53">
      The invention further relates to methods for preparing derivatives of the N-hydroxy-4(1H)-quinazolinones on a solid phase reaction component, including a solid support that is substantially insoluble in aqueous or organic reaction media.
      <br/>
      This method is the preferred synthetic route, and in one embodiment (Scheme I) involves the following steps:  (Chemical Structure image '4' not included in text)
    </p>
    <p num="54">wherein R1 and R2 are as described above for the compounds of Formula (I).</p>
    <p num="55">
      In Scheme I, a 2-aminobenzamide bound to a solid support is reacted with a carboxylic acid (R2 CO2 H) in the presence of a coupling agent, base, and solvent to yield a N-alkoxy-4(1H)-quinazolinone bound to the solid support.
      <br/>
      The 2-aminobenzamide is produced via the reaction of the amino group of hydroxylamine bound to the solid support through an ether linkage with an isatoic anhydride.
      <br/>
      The desired N-hydroxy-4(1H)-quinazolinone can be cleaved from the solid support under acidic conditions.
    </p>
    <p num="56">
      In a further embodiment, when the 2-aminobenzamide is reacted with an N-protected amino acid in the presence of a basic catalyst and a coupling agent, a N-alkoxyquinazolinone bearing an amino acid substituent is formed.
      <br/>
      The coupling reaction and subsequent cyclization can be conveniently performed in an aprotic organic solvent such as dimethylformamide or dimethylacetamide in the presence of a basic catalyst such as dimethylaminopyridine.
      <br/>
      An appropriate coupling agent is bromo-tris-pyrrolidino-phosphonium hexafluorophosphate (PyBrOP).
      <br/>
      Another suitable coupling agent is Tris-pyrrolidino-phosphonium hexafluorophosphate (PyBOP).
    </p>
    <p num="57">
      The quinazolinone bearing the N-protected amino acid bound to the solid support can be deprotected under standard conditions depending upon the protecting group employed.

      Appropriate protecting groups for amino acids and conditions for their removal can be formed in Greene and Wuts, Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, 2nd Ed.

      Wiley, 1991.
      <br/>
      The amino-quinazolinone can the be derivatized to give amides, sulfonamides, ureas or peptides.
      <br/>
      Treatment of the amino-quinazolinone with an acid chloride or a chloroformate in the presence of a base, such as diisopropylethylamine, yields an amide or carbamate derivative of a quinazolinone bound to the solid support.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, treatment of the aminoquinazolinone with an isocyanate provides the urea derivative of a quinazolinone bound to the solid support.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, treatment of the amino-quinazolinone with a sulfonyl chloride in the presence of diisopropylethylamine yields a sulfonamide derivative of a quinazolinone bound to a solid support.
      <br/>
      Other bases that are suitable for effecting this transformation include, but are not limited to, diisopropylethylamine, dimethylaminopyridine, triethylamine, or pyridine.
      <br/>
      In a further embodiment, the amino-quinazolinone may be further reacted with another N-protected amino acid to yield a peptidyl derivatized of a quinazolinone bound to a solid support.
      <br/>
      The derivated compounds can then be removed from the solid support under acidic conditions.
      <br/>
      Aqueous trifluoroacetic acid (TFA), or a mixture of trifluoroaectic acid and an organic solvent, will generally be suitable for the acid hydrolysis of the covalent bond between the derivatized quinazolinones and the solid support.
    </p>
    <p num="58">
      Alternatively, an R2 acyl halide may be used in place of the R2 carboxylic acid.
      <br/>
      In a further embodiment, reaction of a 2-aminobenzamide bound to a solid support with an alpha-halo acid chloride or alpha-halo carboxylic acid yields the corresponding 2-alpha-halo quinazolinone.
      <br/>
      The halo derivative is (i) reacted with an appropriate nucleophile, such as an amine or sulfur nucleophile, to displace the halide or (ii) reacted with triphenylphosphine to form the corresponding Wittig salt.
      <br/>
      The Wittig salt can then be reacted with an aldehyde or ketone under standard Wittig conditions to form a 2-alkenyl quinazolinone.
      <br/>
      The products of (i) and (ii) above may be cleaved from the solid support under acidic conditions to yield the desired products.
