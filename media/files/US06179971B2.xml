    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="1">The present invention is drawn to a process and apparatus for purifying a contaminated gas stream containing contaminants by the conversion of the contaminants into less harmful products.</p>
    <p num="2">
      In spite of decades of effort, a significant need remains for an advanced technology to control stationary source emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) as for example benzene, chlorinated volatile organic compounds (CVOCs) as for example trichloroethylene, and toxic air pollutants (TAPs) as for example acrylonitrile.
      <br/>
      A particular need exists for technology which controls emissions from industrial processes and other applications where low concentrations of VOCs and TAPs are present in high flow rate air streams.
    </p>
    <p num="3">
      Dilute air stream pollution control is becoming recognized as a major environmental control issue for the United States industrial community at large.
      <br/>
      For example, the control of indoor air pollution associated with solvent degreasing operations is necessary, including the dilute emissions associated with exhaust ventilation fans.
      <br/>
      Also, air stripping of contaminated groundwater produces dilute air emissions for which current technology provides no satisfactory solution.
      <br/>
      Catalytic combustors are available, but require processing tremendous volumes of air and result in uneconomic performance.
      <br/>
      Thermal incinerators require excessive supplemental fuel for dilute mixtures, and exhibit uncertain selectivity when CVOCs are involved.
      <br/>
      Gas membrane processes are only now emerging for gas separation, and are ill-suited for dilute mixtures.
      <br/>
      Pressure swing adsorption using zeolites or resins is not applicable to dilute mixtures, and rotating wheel adsorbers are uneconomic for such dilute concentrations of organics.
      <br/>
      Packed bed activated carbon adsorption is widely practiced, but creates a hazardous solid waste which is increasingly difficult to manage.
      <br/>
      Carbon regeneration by steam is costly, and is generally economic only for very large scale operations.
      <br/>
      Landfill options for spent carbon will become more limited, as it involves transportation and disposal of hazardous wastes, particularly for CVOC applications.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      Control of indoor air pollution is also of growing importance, with the objective of enhancing workplace environmental health and safety protection.
      <br/>
      The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) is promulgating new regulations to reduce workplace exposure to indoor air contaminants such as CVOCs.
      <br/>
      Many CVOCs are particularly toxic.
      <br/>
      Certain CVOCs are suspected carcinogens, others are linked to possible birth defects, and still others are suspected active precursors in the destruction of the stratospheric ozone layer.
      <br/>
      Of the 189 targeted air toxics in the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, about one-third of the compounds are chlorinated.
      <br/>
      By the standards of conventional air pollution control technology, indoor air pollution is at exceedingly dilute concentrations.
      <br/>
      An effective and economic pollution control technology in dilute air systems is the objective of this invention.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      In spite of considerable efforts of researchers in the field, most UV photolytic and photocatalytic systems exhibit shortcomings in performance which limit their commercial utility for air pollution control.
      <br/>
      One shortcoming of note is the propensity of such processes to produce undesirable byproducts of incomplete oxidation, both by the photolytic treatment of contaminated air and by the photocatalytic treatment of contaminated air.
      <br/>
      Indeed, some such byproducts can be more harmful than the original contaminant being removed, such as the formation of phosgene byproduct through both photolytic and photocatalytic oxidation of trichloroethylene.
      <br/>
      As used herein, photolytic oxidative destruction is defined as the reaction of contaminants in an oxygen-containing gas stream as a result of the action of the ultraviolet radiation, by oxidation reactions, decomposition reactions, bond-scission reactions, and the like.
      <br/>
      Photocatalytic oxidative destruction is defined as the reaction of contaminants from an oxygen-containing gas stream as a result of the action of the ultraviolet radiation on the surface of a photocatalyst, by oxidation reactions, decomposition reactions, bond-scission reactions, and the like.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      Photolysis could appear to be an efficient and effective means to control emissions of air-borne contaminants.
      <br/>
      It has been known for decades that contaminants in an air stream can be treated by passing the air through vessels simply containing UV lamps.
      <br/>
      Legan, in U.S. Pat. No. 4,045,316 has disclosed such a process, augmented by ozone addition.
      <br/>
      Knoevenagel and Himmelreich, in U.S. Pat. No. 3,977,952 have disclosed such a process without the augmentation by ozone.
      <br/>
      Such methods would appear to be simple and cost-effective, but they have not been used commercially.
      <br/>
      Their primary deficiency is that the methods also produce partially oxygenated byproducts, and there has been no way to control this undesirable byproduct formation.
      <br/>
      Such byproducts were recognized Kitchens, in U.S. Pat. No. 4,144,152. More recent studies have confirmed the byproduct formation with more sophisticated analytical techniques (see Haag, W. R. and M. D. Johnson, "Direct Photolysis of Trichloroethene in Air: Effect of Co-contaminants, Toxicity of Products, and Hydrothermal Treatment of Products", Environmental Science and Technology, 30, No. 2, 414-421, 1996; Spaeder, T. A., "Experimental Studies of an Ethanol-Air Flow Subjected to UV Light", Air &amp; Waste Management Association, 87th Annual Meeting, Cincinnati, Ohio, 1994; and Bolton, J. R. et al., "Homogeneous Photodegradation of Pollutants in Air", Air &amp; Waste Management Association, 87th Annual Meeting, Cincinnati, Ohio, 1994).
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      Photocatalysis using UV radiation has also been tested for decades as a means to destroy air pollutants.
      <br/>
      Juillet, et al., in U.S. Pat. No. 3,781,194 disclosed the use of titania for the oxidation of gaseous hydrocarbons, and found primarily aldehydes and ketones in the reaction products.
      <br/>
      More recently, extensive amounts of byproducts from the photocatalytic oxidation of air-borne contaminants have been found by current analytical techniques (see Nimlos, M. R., et al., "Direct Mass Spectrometric Studies of the Destruction of Hazardous Wastes, 2.
      <br/>

N. and S. O. Hay, "The Augmentation of L TV Photocatalytic Oxidation with Trace Quantities of Ozone", Third International Conference on TiO2 Photocatalytic Purification and Treatment of Water and Air, Orlando, Fla., Sep. 23-26, 1997).

    <p num="8">Naturally, it would be highly desirable to provide a process and apparatus for purifying a contaminated gas stream containing contaminants by the conversion of the contaminants into less harmful byproducts while avoiding the shortcomings associated with known processes and apparatus described above.</p>
    <p num="9">
      Surprisingly, it is found that the combination of a photolytic step with a photocatalytic step as taught the present invention, each of which produce undesirable byproducts individually, results in a more efficient process which eliminates or reduces the production of said undesirable byproducts from the combined stages.
      <br/>
      Without being bound by theory, it appears that the pretreatment of gas-phase contaminants in said photolytic stage efficiently produces partially oxygenated species which, in turn, are much more efficiently converted in the photocatalytic stage to less harmful products.
      <br/>
      Because the photolytic stage produces byproducts which are particularly easy to destroy in the photocatalytic stage, the combined two-stage process of the present invention produces little or no byproducts.
    </p>
    <p num="10">Accordingly, it is the principle object of the present invention to provide a process and apparatus for purifying a contaminated gas stream by conversion of the contaminants into less harmful products.</p>
    <p num="11">It is a further object of the present invention to provide a process and apparatus as mentioned above which combines photolytic and photocatalytic stages wherein the process results in a synergistic effect.</p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="12">The foregoing objects and advantages are achieved by way of the present invention which provides a process and apparatus for the oxidation of gaseous contaminants in a contaminated gas stream.</p>
    <p num="13">
      The present invention comprises the oxidation of gaseous contaminants for the control of air pollution, by means of a two stage process comprising a photolytic stage followed by a photocatalytic stage.
      <br/>
      In view of the results of the prior art described above that (a) photolytic reactions produce extensive byproducts and (b) photocatlytic reactions produce extensive byproducts, it is particularly surprising that the present invention provides a process which oxidizes air pollutants without extensive production of partially oxygenated byproducts.
      <br/>
      Without being bound by theory, it is believed that the partially oxygenated byproducts from the photolytic reactor are particularly easily oxidized in the photocatalytic reactor.
      <br/>
      For example, the photolytic reactor may convert hydrocarbons to aldehydes and ketones, and these aldehydes and ketones are much more reactive in the photocatalytic stage than were the original hydrocarbon contaminants.
      <br/>
      However, that would only account for a complete photocatalytic destruction of those hydrocarbons which had already been converted to partially oxygenated species in the photolytic stage.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, not only are these partially oxygenated species converted in the photocatalytic stage, but also they appear to facilitate the oxidation of other unconverted contaminants from the photolytic stage.
      <br/>
      It appears that the presence of these partially oxygenated species entering the photocatalytic stage facilitate surface reactions on the photocatalyst, such as chain reactions, which also effect the destruction of other contaminants on the photocatalyst which are not themselves partially oxidized in the photolytic stage.
      <br/>
      Thus, a synergistic effect is obtained by the process.
    </p>
    <p num="14">Further objects and advantages of the present invention will appear from the detailed description.</p>
    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
    <p num="15">The present invention is drawn to a process and apparatus for purifying contaminated gas streams by the conversion and oxidation of the contaminants into less harmful products.</p>
    <p num="16">
      The process of this invention comprises first passing the contaminated gas through a photolytic stage, in which the action of the UV radiation causes reactions of the contaminants, at least partially forming oxygenated species other than carbon dioxide.
      <br/>
      The photolytic stage contains no solid catalyst.
      <br/>
      It consists of a reactor vessel containing ultraviolet lamps, through which the contaminated gas passes while being exposed to the action of the ultraviolet radiation.
      <br/>
      The photolytic stage is operated such that it converts at least 10% (molar) of the entering contaminant of said contaminated gas to partially oxidized products.
      <br/>
      Excluded from this 10% yield of partially oxygenated byproducts are such fully oxidized products as carbon dioxide, water, hydrogen chloride and halogens such as chlorine or fluorine.
      <br/>
      Preferably, the photolytic stage converts at least 20% (molar) of the entering contaminants to partially oxidized species, and still more preferably the photolytic stage converts at least 40% (molar of the entering contaminants to partially oxidized species.
      <br/>
      Methods for control of photolytic stage operating conditions to accomplish these objectives include adjustment of temperature, residence time, and amount and intensity of ultraviolet radiation, as set forth herein below.
      <br/>
      If desired, alternating photolytic and photocatalytic stages can be employed in a repeating sequence, to accomplish these objectives.
    </p>
    <p num="17">
      In the photolytic stage of the process, the contaminated gas is exposed to ultraviolet radiation of wavelength shorter than or equal to about 400 nanometers (nm), preferably about 185 nanometers to about 375 nanometers.
      <br/>
      The photolytic stage may be operated at temperatures from about 0 (degree)  F. to about 1000 (degree)  F., preferably from 50 (degree)  F. to about 200 (degree)  F., and still more preferably from about 70 (degree)  F. to about 150 (degree)  F. The reactor may be operated at pressures from 0.2 atm to 10 atm, preferably 0.8 to 1.5 atm. The residence time of the gas in the photolytic stage may be between 0.01 and 300 seconds, preferably 0.1 to 50 seconds, where residence time is defined as the ratio of the volume of the photolytic stage reactor to the total volumetric flow rate of gas passing through the reactor at the temperature and pressure of the gas entering the reactor.
      <br/>
      Generally, the use of medium pressure, high intensity ultraviolet lamps will permit the operation of the process at lower residence time, whereas the use of low pressure, lower intensity ultraviolet lamps will require the operation of the process at higher residence times.
      <br/>
      Selection of the preferred conditions within these ranges will be a matter of economic optimization for any specific application, using routine experimentation and methods well known to those skilled in the art.
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      Additionally, the photolytic reactor operation may be augmented by the addition of ozone, hydrogen peroxide, and/or water droplets, to the reactor inlet gas or to the reactor itself.
      <br/>
      Selection of the amounts of these optional constituents is selected from the range from about 10% of the molar amount of the contaminant entering the reactor, up to about 100 times the molar amount of the entering contaminant.
      <br/>
      It should be emphasized, however, that excess amounts of these optional constituents are not harmful to the efficiency of the process, but are limited only by economic considerations for any specific application.
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      In the photocatalytic stage, the photocatalyst is comprised of one or more members of the following group: titanium oxide, silicon oxide, zirconium oxide, tungsten oxide, antimony oxide, zinc oxide, stannic oxide, ferric oxide, rare earth oxides, and noble metals.
      <br/>
      Preferably, the catalyst is comprised primarily of silica, titanium in an amount from about 0% to about 5%, zirconium in an amount from about 0% to about 5%, and oxygen in an amount consistent with the chemical composition of the oxides of silicon, titanium and ziroconium.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, the catalyst may be comprised principally of titania.
      <br/>
      A further alternative is to employ a catalyst comprised of silicon oxide, in an amount from about 0.1% by weight to about 70% by weight; titanium dioxide, in an amount from about 30% by weight to about 90% by weight; tungsten oxide, in an amount from 10% by weight to about 50% by weight, preferably 20 to 30%; and platinum or palladium, singly or in combination, from about 0.01% to about 10% by total weight, preferably about 0.1 to 5%.
    </p>
    <p num="20">
      In the photocatalytic stage of the process of this invention, the contaminated air from the photolytic stage is passed over the photocatalyst of the present invention, wherein the photocatalyst is exposed to ultraviolet radiation of wavelength shorter than about 400 nanometers (nm), preferably about 185 nanometers to 375 nanometers.
      <br/>
      The photocatalyst may be operated at temperatures from about 0 (degree)  F. to about 1000 (degree)  F., preferably from 50 (degree)  F. to about 200 (degree)  F., and still more preferably from about 70 (degree)  F. to about 150 (degree)  F. The reactor may be operated at pressure from about 0.2 atm to 10.0 atm, preferably about 0.8 atm to 1.5 atm. The residence time of the gas over the catalyst may be between 0.001 and 10 seconds, preferably 0.01 to 5 seconds, where residence time is defined as the ratio of the volume of the photocatalyst to the total volumetric flow rate of gas passing through the reactor at the temperature and pressure of the gas entering the reactor.
      <br/>
      The use of medium pressure, high intensity ultraviolet lamps will permit the operation of the process at lower residence time, whereas the use of low pressure, lower intensity ultraviolet lamps will require the operation of the process at higher residence times.
      <br/>
      Selection of the preferred conditions within these ranges will be a matter of economic optimization for any specific application, using routine experimentation and methods well known to those skilled in the art.
    </p>
    <p num="21">
      The contaminated gas may be contacted with the photocatalyst in any fashion known to those skilled in the art, preferably by passing the gas over a packed bed of the photocatalyst which is illuminated with an ultraviolet radiation.
      <br/>
      The ultraviolet radiation can be caused to illuminate the photocatalyst in any fashion known to those skilled in the art, preferably by imbedding the light bulbs in the packed bed of the photocatalyst.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, the photocatalyst may be arranged in beds of photocatalyst, with rows of light bulbs between the beds, providing alternating rows of catalyst beds and light bulbs.
      <br/>
      The wavelength of the ultraviolet radiation illuminating the photocatalyst is any wavelength customarily defined to be in the ultraviolet range, of about 10 to 400 nanometers, and preferably in the range of 150 to 400 nanometers, and more preferably 185 to 375 nanometers.
    </p>
    <p num="22">
      A preferred catalyst for use in the process and apparatus of the present invention is a silica-titania-zirconia catalyst comprising, from about 0.001% to about 2.0% by weight titanium, from about 0.001% to about 2% by weight zirconium, and balance essentially silicon.
      <br/>
      The catalyst may ideally include platinum and/or palladium in a total combined weight of from about 0.01% to about 10% by weight, preferably 0.1% to 5% by weight.
      <br/>
      The intensity of the ultraviolet light on the instant exterior surface of the photocatalyst in the process of the present invention is at least 0.1 mw/cm2, preferably between about 5 mw/cm2 to 500 mw/cm2.

    <p num="23">Optional scrubbing of products of the reaction may be performed between the photolytic and photocatalytic stages, or following the photocatalytic stage, by using water, alkaline materials, and the like.</p>
    <p num="24">Advantages of the present invention will be made clear from the following examples.</p>
    <p num="25">EXAMPLE 1</p>
    <p num="26">
      A vessel was constructed which allowed operation as a photolytic reactor.
      <br/>
      The reactor was rectangular, of dimensions 18 inches by 16 inches by 25 inches, into which were placed eight 16 watt UV lamps, producing radiation at 254 nm.
      <br/>
      Air was supplied to the reactor system by a Cincinnati Fan direct drive blower.
      <br/>
      Flow was measured by utilizing a size 4 Dwyer pilot tube flow sensor, coupled with a Magnahelic flow gauge.
      <br/>
      The main air stream from this blower was mixed with a contaminated air stream saturated with trichloroethylene (TCE), to obtain the desired contaminated air stream containing trichloroethylene (TCE), to obtain the desired reactor inlet conditions.
      <br/>
      The saturator was a jacketed glass vessel containing TCE, through which a small stream of cylinder air was bubbled.
      <br/>
      The temperature of the jacketed saturator was controlled by a Lauda Refrigerating Circulator Bath.
      <br/>
      The air to this saturator was drawn from a regulated gas cylinder, through a micro-metering control valve.
      <br/>
      By control of the saturator air flow rate and the saturator temperature, any desired concentration of contaminant could be achieved in the main air stream to the reactor.
    </p>
    <p num="27">
      Operating the reactor as a photolytic reactor, an inlet flow rate of TCE contaminated air entered the reactor, operating at 25 (degree)  C. The entering flow rate was 249 liters/min, the inlet TCE concentration was 193 ppm, and the entering relative humidity was about 50%.
      <br/>
      Under these conditions, the residence time of the gas in the photolytic reactor was calculated from the ratio of the interior reactor volume to the entering volumetric flow rate.
      <br/>
      The residence time of the contaminated gas in the photolytic reactor was calculated to be 28.4 seconds.
      <br/>
      The overall removal of TCE was determined to exceed 98%, based on a comparison of the TCE concentrations in the gas stream entering and leaving the reactor.
      <br/>
      However, upon analysis of the reaction products by gas chromatography, several large peaks were observed on the chromatogram which were consistent with the byproducts observed by others (see above).
      <br/>
      The chromatographic peak area for the 193 ppm of TCE in the reactor inlet gas was 1,509,460 area units.
      <br/>
      The combined peak area for the dominant byproduct peaks was 359,716.
      <br/>
      Assuming the chromatographic responses for these species are similar, this is equivalent to a concentration of byproducts in the reactor effluent of 46 ppm.
      <br/>
      That is, about 24% of the inlet TCE was converted to partially oxygenated byproducts.
      <br/>
      This byproduct yield is too high to allow commercial use of photolytic reactors for control air emissions of contaminants.
      <br/>
      Indeed, the nature of the specific byproducts is such that they can be more toxic than the original air contaminants from which they are derived (see Haag, W. R. and M. D. Johnson, "Direct Photolysis of Trichloroethene in Air: Effect of Co-contaminants, Toxicity of Products, and Hydrothermal Treatment of Products", Environmental Science and Technology, 30, No. 2, 414-421, 1996).
    </p>
    <p num="28">EXAMPLE 2</p>
    <p num="29">
      The same reactor was modified to add a photocatalyst bed in the bottom section of the photolytic reactor, through which the photolytically oxidized gases passed before they left the reactor.
      <br/>
      The same 8 UV lamps were again placed in the reactor, located about 3 inches above the catalyst bed.
      <br/>
      This allowed UV radiation from the UV lamps to illuminate both the photolytic top section of the reactor, as well as providing radiation on the layer of the photocatalyst bed. 5000 cc of titania was added as a layer of photocatalyst on a supporting screen near the bottom of the reactor.
      <br/>
      This catalyst bed volume was spread over the 18 inch by 25 inch dimension of the reactor, to a depth of approximately one inch.
      <br/>
      An entering flow rate of TCE-contaminated air was established, as described above, with an inlet TCE concentration of 206 ppm.
      <br/>
      In these tests, the entering flow rate of contaminated air was 183 liters per minute, chosen so that the residence time in the photolytic portion of the reactor was similar to that disclosed above for the first experiment.
      <br/>
      In particular, since the photocatalyst section now occupied part of the total reactor volume, the volume of the photolytic stage was smaller, so the entering flow rate was proportionately reduced to maintain a constant residence time.
      <br/>
      In this second experiment, the residence time in the photolytic stage of the reactor was 30.7 seconds and the residence time in the photocatalytic stage of the reactor was 1.6 seconds.
      <br/>
      In this latter calculation of photocatalytic gas residence time, the total volume of photocatalyst charged to the reactor was divided by the volumetric flow rate of gas to the reactor.
      <br/>
      Upon measuring the performance of the reactor as described above, it was found that the overall destruction efficiency of TCE was 97%.
      <br/>
      The amount of total byproducts leaving the reactor was extremely low, at 1.5 ppm. This is surprising, because the prior art discussed above would suggest that the titania photocatalyst should form additional byproducts, not remove them (see Nimlos, M. R., et al., "Direct Mass Spectrometric Studies of the Destruction of Hazardous Wastes, 2.
      <br/>
      Gas-Phase Photocatalytic Oxidation of Trichloroethylene of TiO2 : Products and Mechanisms", Environmental Sciences and Technology, 27, No. 4, 731-740, 1993).
    </p>
    <p num="30">EXAMPLE 3</p>
    <p num="31">
      In a third experiment, the same reactor configuration was used, except the preferred silica-titania-zirconia catalyst was employed comprising 0.012% titania, 0.01% zirconia, balance silica.
      <br/>
      The quantity of catalyst and the reactor configuration are identical to that of Example 2.
      <br/>
      In this third experiment, the inlet concentration of TCE was 203 ppm and the inlet gas flow rate was 170 liters/min.
      <br/>
      This provided a residence time in the photolytic section of the reactor of 33 seconds, and a residence time in the photocatalyst of 1.8 seconds, both substantially the same as in Example 2.
      <br/>
      Upon analysis of the reactor effluent, the TCE destruction efficiency had risen to 98.7% and the total byproducts concentration in the effluent was non-detectable, below the point of analytical resolution.
      <br/>
      Using the analytical detection limit as the highest possible level of byproduct formation, the byproduct concentration was determined to be no higher than 0.8 ppm, and it was probably substantially lower.
    </p>
    <p num="32">
      Surprisingly, the examples demonstrate that the combined photolytic-photocatalytic system of the present invention permits operation of a very simple and inexpensive reactor with very high destruction efficiency and without formation of significant amounts of byproducts.
      <br/>
      It is further surprising that this can be achieved by combination of two stages which separately are well-known to form byproducts but which in combination act in synergism and do not form undesirable byproducts.
