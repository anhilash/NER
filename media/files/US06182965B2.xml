    <heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">
      The present invention relates to games involving chance selection of colors, numbers and the like.
      <br/>
      More specifically, the present invention relates to games utilizing a plurality of circular disks or rings, each disk or ring having a different color, number or other indicia affixed, printed or otherwise incorporated onto each of its two flat sides and which disks or rings may be spun by hand to fall with one or the other of their two flat sides facing upward and showing the color, number or other indicia from which to determine score or playing action.

    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="3">
      A number of spinning toys are known in the prior art, such as tops, where the object is to keep the top rotating around its axis, and hula hoops, which spin concentrically around a person's body.
      <br/>
      Games of chance are also known where rolling or throwing dice and spinning wheels or pointers are used.
    </p>

      Monson, U.S. Pat. Nos. 1,571,901, 1,587,127, 1,595,611, and 1,610,530, issued Feb. 2, 1926, Jun. 1, 1926, Aug. 10, 1926, and Dec. 14, 1926, respectively, each describe a game of chance involving a disk which is held perpendicular to the base on which it rests and is spun by hand.
      <br/>
      This disk is thickest at its center with thinner edges, these edges being segmented into areas which provide resting places.
      <br/>
      As the disk drops, it comes to rest on a section of the disk which is marked with particular indicia.
      <br/>
      This disk depends on its own shape for a random selection of indicia.

    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="6">
      The present invention utilizes a ring or rings which have flat sides displaying differing indicia on their fronts and backs.
      <br/>
      The ring or rings may be spun until they fall on one side or the other, with the upward side of each ring or rings indicating chance outcomes.
      <br/>
      The chance outcome of the spinning rings may be connected with playing cards or other sets of colors, numbers, and the like, thus offering both changeable ranges of difficulty and the increased complication and play value provided by such external indicia.
      <br/>
      When a plurality of spinning rings is used, additional combinations of chance outcomes may be produced, which combinations themselves may call into play external indicia and may also denote playing action.
    </p>
    <p num="7">It is an object of the present invention to provide games in which the players take turns spinning by hand a plurality of disks or rings on a surface, which disks or rings each have two flat sides, (i.e., a front and a back).</p>
    <p num="8">It is a further object of the present invention to provide games of chance in which the players spin disks or rings which have differing indicia on their two flat sides, so that there exists a 50/50 chance of either front or back indicia facing upward as the rings fall.</p>
    <p num="9">It is a still further object of the present invention to provide competitive ring-spinning games through keeping score from upward-facing colors, numbers or other indicia on the fallen disks or rings.</p>
    <p num="10">It is yet a further object of the present invention to provide ring-spinning games in which playing cards, playing boards or other sets of indicia may be brought into play by particular indicia displayed on the fallen disks or rings, these other sets of indicia providing pre-game opportunities to select range of difficulty and providing enhanced entertainment value.</p>
    <p num="11">It is a still further object of the present invention to provide ring-spinning games in which a plurality of the spinning rings may provide combinations of indicia among the fallen rings, combinations which may bring into play external indicia or which may denote playing action.</p>

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="13">
      The games of the present invention utilize disks or rings, such as illustrated as FIG. 1.
      <br/>
      The disks or rings of FIG. 1 may be made of plastic, wood, cardboard or other material and may be shaped with two flat sides 14 and 16 as illustrated in FIG. 2.
      <br/>
      The disks or rings of FIG. 1 may also have a predetermined thickness, as illustrated in FIG. 2, and may be shaped with a convex outer edge 10 to facilitate prolonged spinning.
      <br/>
      Inside edge 12 may also have a convex shape, for aesthetics and for providing a pleasant hand grip.
    </p>
    <p num="14">
      The rings may have color, as indicated in FIG. 1 by shading.
      <br/>
      The rings FIG. 1 may, in addition to color, or as an alternative thereof, have numbers, letters, symbols, pictures or other indicia 18 and 18' printed or affixed on their flat sides 14 and 16.
      <br/>
      In the example of FIG. 1, such indicia 18 and 18'0 are placed at opposite points across the circle.
    </p>
    <p num="15">
      In the preferred embodiment, rings, such as illustrated in FIG. 1, may be used.
      <br/>
      However, a disc or other generally round device may be used in place of a ring.
      <br/>
      In addition, disc or ring need not be round in its entirety, but only at a point where spun.
      <br/>
      Moreover, other shapes may be utilized, without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention, so long as they comprise two alternate sides and may be readily spun on a smooth, flat surface.
    </p>
    <p num="16">
      The games of the present invention may involve each player taking turns at spinning one or more disks or rings on to a preferably flat, level surface, such as concrete, linoleum or low-pile carpet.
      <br/>
      Spinning is performed by holding each disk or ring of FIG. 1 perpendicular to the surface on which it rests and twirling it between thumb and fingers.
      <br/>
      Rings may be spun individually, or may be spun together by placing multiple rings flat together and spinning them as a group.
      <br/>
      To count as a spin, each ring of FIG. 1 must rotate several times before dropping.
      <br/>
      After spinning, the rings FIG. 1 are left lying until all have fallen.
      <br/>
      Score or playing activity is denoted by indicia revealed on the upward-facing sides of the rings.
    </p>
    <p num="17">
      In a preferred embodiment, three rings of FIG. 1 are used, with each ring of FIG. 1 having a color and number on its back side 14 differing from the color and number on its front side 16.
      <br/>
      The arrangement of colors and numbers applied to the rings is as follows.
      <br/>
      A first ring may be colored and numbered red/1 on its front and yellow/2 on its back.
      <br/>
      A second ring may be colored and number yellow/2 on the front and blue/3 on the back.
      <br/>
      A third ring may be colored/numbered blue/3 on the front and red/1 on the back.
      <br/>
      Thus, a combination of three colors and three numbers is provided, with two colors/numbers per ring.
    </p>
    <p num="18">Spinning the three rings of FIG. 1 in the preferred embodiment may produce any one of seven different color combinations among the fallen rings as follows:</p>
    <p num="19">
      --
      <br/>
      -- -            Ring 1        Ring 2         Ring 3
      <br/>
      -- 1                red           red            yellow
      <br/>
      -- 2                red           red            blue
      <br/>
      -- 3                yellow        yellow         red
      <br/>
      -- 4                yellow        yellow         blue
      <br/>
      -- 5                blue          blue           red
      <br/>
      -- 6                blue          blue           yellow
      <br/>
      -- 7                red           yellow         blue
    </p>
    <p num="20">
      Of course, other combinations of colors, numbers, and other indica may be used without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention.
      <br/>
      By altering the number of rings, colors, and the like, different numbers of combinations may be produced, with different probabilities of outcomes, depending upon the arrangement of colors (or other indicia) and rings.
    </p>
    <p num="21">
      If playing a game in which colors are the scoring indicia, players may record their scores on any paper or on a scorecard such as illustrated in FIG. 3.
      <br/>
      Such a scorecard may contain columns of boxes 20a, 20b and 20c, each column marked with one of the ring colors.
      <br/>
      Players may make a mark, such a line or a dot, in boxes 20a, 20b, and 20c, for each corresponding color revealed on the rings after they have been spun during a player's turn.
      <br/>
      The first player to fill one color column 20a, 20b or 20c would win; or, for a longer game, the first player to fill the entire scorecard of FIG. 3 would be the winner.
    </p>
    <p num="22">
      To heighten player interest and provide further complication to the colors game, playing cards such as illustrated in FIG. 4 may be used.
      <br/>
      The playing cards may each show indicia such as, but not limited to, that illustrated on FIG. 4.
      <br/>
      The indicia on each playing card may show scoring information or further instructions for play.
    </p>
    <p num="23">
      Cards may be brought into play by a particular unique combination of colors revealed on the fallen rings.
      <br/>
      For example, in the preferred embodiment, the colors combination may be red, yellow and blue.
      <br/>
      As noted above, this unique combination is one of seven possible outcomes in the preferred embodiment.
      <br/>
      Thus, if a player spins any of the other six combinations of colors, the player scores the colors as before.
      <br/>
      However, if the player spins a combination of red, yellow, and blue (combination number 7, above), the player may then draw a card.
    </p>
    <p num="24">
      The player spinning one of each color would take a playing card such as in FIG. 4 and follow its instructions.
      <br/>
      For example, if the player took the particular card of FIG. 4, the player would mark on the scorecard of FIG. 3 three boxes in the red column 20a.
      <br/>
      The playing card FIG. 4 would then be placed on the bottom of the card stack, and ensuing players would resume keeping score from the colors on the fallen rings.
      <br/>
      Alternately, the player may mark the scorecard for each of the three colors in the combination and follow the instructions in the card of FIG. 4.
    </p>
    <p num="25">
      Note that other instructions than that shown in FIG. 4 may be used.
      <br/>
      Moreover, instructions may be penalizing as well as rewarding a player.
      <br/>
      Thus, instructions such as "skip a turn", "reverse direction of play", or even "jump back" (i.e., lose a point in a particular column) may be used.
      <br/>
      Alternately, instructions may allow a player adjacent to the playing player to score (i.e., "player to the left jumps RED three steps").
      <br/>
      Many other combinations of such instructions may be used within the spirit and scope of the present invention.
    </p>
    <p num="26">
      In another embodiment of a game employing numbers, players may record their numerical scores on any paper or on scorecards such as that depicted in FIG. 5.
      <br/>
      The scorecard of FIG. 5 shows the scoring area divided into rounds 30, a round consisting of all players having had a turn at spinning.
      <br/>
      In each round 30, the player may record the score of each of the three fallen rings of FIG. 1, and total these three scores in the total square 32.
      <br/>
      Total squares starting with the second row, 34, are divided in half horizontally, affording the top half for that round's total and the bottom half for the sum of that round's total with the previous total in square 32 (or preceding total square 34), thus keeping a running score.
      <br/>
      The first player to reach a predetermined score, or the player with the highest score after a predetermined number of rounds may be declared the winner.
    </p>
    <p num="27">
      To increase complication and play value in such a numbers game, playing cards such as illustrated in FIG. 6 may be used.
      <br/>
      Such cards may be brought into play by the player having spun a particular combination of numbers on the fallen rings of FIG. 1, such as one of each number, in the example illustrated, numbers 1, 2 and 3 (and, correspondingly, one of each color, red, yellow and blue).
      <br/>
      In this instance, the player would take the top playing card, such as illustrated in the example of FIG. 6, from the stack.
      <br/>
      This card, FIG. 6, shows three numbers, one red, one yellow, and one blue.
      <br/>
      Each number on the playing card changes the numerical score value of the corresponding ring of the matching color.
    </p>
    <p num="28">
      In the example illustrated in FIG. 6, the red ring would now have a score value of 2, the yellow ring a score value of 13, and the blue ring a score value of 7.
      <br/>
      The player, having just spun one red, one yellow and one blue, would record the scores 2, 13 and 7, for a total score of 22.
      <br/>
      The new numerical values for the rings FIG. 1 would apply for all ensuing players, until a player again spun one ring of each color, and took another playing card, thereby changing the numerical values of the rings again.
      <br/>
      Thus, in this embodiment, the rings FIG. 1 would have constantly changing numerical values.
    </p>
    <p num="29">
      Other rules may be applied using the playing card of FIG. 6.
      <br/>
      For example, the card values may be applied to only the player drawing the card, and not other players.
      <br/>
      Further, as in the color game, the card values may be punitive as well as rewarding to the player.
      <br/>
      For example, values lower than the ring face values may be displayed on the card, or even negative values.
      <br/>
      Similarly, other instructions, such a "change direction of play", "lose turn", "skip next player", and the like, may be used.
      <br/>
      Moreover, score values may be assigned to an adjacent player, as indicated by instructions on the face of the card.
      <br/>
      All such variations, as well as other types of instructions, fall within the spirit and scope of the present invention.
    </p>
    <p num="30">
      The use of indicia external to that on the rings FIG. 1, such as playing cards, charts, or other sets of indicia, and linking such external indicia to a particular combination of fallen rings, provides opportunities to change the level of difficulty of educational games by selecting certain external indicia for play.
      <br/>
      For example, in the numbers game described herein, a parent or teacher could select playing cards having only single digit numbers, or double or triple digit numbers, or fractions, decimals, or mixed numbers, for educational purposes and the like.
    </p>
    <p num="31">
      Another embodiment of the present invention involves animals.
      <br/>
      In this embodiment playing boards may be used, such as but not limited to the individual player's board FIG. 7.
      <br/>
      An arrangement of such playing boards is shown as a perspective view in FIG. 11, illustrating game in play.
      <br/>
      In such a game, animal cards, such as illustrated in the example of FIG. 9, may be collected, paired, and placed in a slot in each player's animal Shelter 40 and from there gradually moved to the player's Released in the Wild area 42, where they may be counted for score.
      <br/>
      The Appendix, attached hereto, contains an exemplary set of rules for such an animal game.
    </p>
    <p num="32">
      In the animal game embodiment, the animal cards exemplified by FIG. 9 may also be taken by other players, or relegated to Extinction.
      <br/>
      Protection pawns may be used which, laid on animal pairs in a shelter 40, protect the pair from Extinction and from being taken by other players.
      <br/>
      Particular moves may be required by special action cards, exemplified by the card of FIG. 10, which may affect only the card holder or other players as well.
      <br/>
      All playing action in this game is determined by spinning three two-sided, colored rings as in FIG. 1 and thus producing the seven aforementioned color combinations.
    </p>
    <p num="33">
      In the animal game embodiment, each color combination may denote a particular play action, as illustrated in FIG. 8, which is a detail of each player's individual playing board FIG. 7.
      <br/>
      For each of the seven color combinations (or, in the alternative, a sum or combination of numbers, or combination of indicia), one or more actions may be prescribed.
      <br/>
      For example, as illustrated in FIG. 8, combination 3 may include the instructions to take another player's unprotected pair and release into your own wild section, or draw another animal card.
      <br/>
      Combination 4 may instruct the player to take a special action card (as exemplified in FIG. 10) and follow the instructions thereon.
      <br/>
      Combination 5 may instruct the player to place an unprotected pair of animal cards in the extinction section, or, if no unprotected pairs are available, take an animal card.
    </p>
    <p num="34">
      Other instructions may be provided within the spirit and scope of the present invention.
      <br/>
      In the preferred embodiment, as illustrated in FIG. 1, the instructions may be as follows:

    <p num="35">- Instruction</p>
    <p num="36">
      1 Take an animal card

      The above illustrations are intended to explain the use of the previously-described spinning disks or rings and the linking of ring indicia such as but not limited to colors, numbers, and combinations of these with other indicia such as but not limited to playing cards, playing boards, pawns and scorecards.
      <br/>
      Two particular ring-spinning games have been herein described, the first involving colors and/or numbers, the second game involving animals.
    </p>
    <p num="38">
      It should be recognized that these games have in common the chance selection of and play activity denoted by indicia or combinations of indicia achieved by spinning a plurality of two-sided disks or rings.
      <br/>
      Similar chance selections or combinations may be obtained by shaking or throwing disks, rings or dice, by spinning wheels or pointers, or by other chance selection devices.
    </p>
    <p num="39">
      For example, disks or rings FIG. 1 may be of varying sizes and made of various materials.
      <br/>
      More rings may be provided in a game, such as six, with players choosing how many and which rings to use.
      <br/>
      Indicia on these rings may change, as may sets of external indicia tied to the rings by a particular combination of fallen rings.
      <br/>
      Sets of external indicia may include maps, charts or sets of indicia other than or in addition to playing cards, playing boards and scorecards.
    </p>
    <p num="40">
      Much variety in the rules may exist with regard to scoring, for example.
      <br/>
      In certain rounds of play, the totals may be subtracted from the previous total, creating the possibility of negative scores.
      <br/>
      Numbers on playing cards could be multiplied by the numbers on the rings.
      <br/>
      In addition, math functions of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division could be involved by altering the ring indicia and the associated external indicia.
    </p>
    <p num="41">
      Other board games are foreseen employing spinning disks or rings which display differing indicia on their fronts and backs and which rings are associated with external indicia.
      <br/>
      Also foreseen are comparable computer games, where spinning of rings may be simulated or even animated (e.g., using 2-D or 3-D graphics).
    </p>
    <p num="42">
      In the animal game, scoring may be modified by providing different scores for different types of animals, depending upon rarity.
      <br/>
      Thus, for example, white tiger may score 50 points as a matched pair in the wild, while tree squirrel scores 1 point for a matched pair in the wild.
    </p>
    <p num="43">While the preferred embodiment and various alternative embodiments of the invention have been disclosed and described in detail herein, it may be apparent to those skilled in the art that various changes in form and detail may be made therein without departing from the spirit and scope thereof.</p>

    <p num="44">
      Instructions for Play
      <br/>
      1.
      <br/>
      Two to four persons can play.
      <br/>
      Place an "Animal Shelter" board before each player.
      <br/>
      Shuffle the Animal Cards and Special Action Cards and place face-down in their boxes.
      <br/>
      Place Protection Pawns in their box.
      <br/>
      Place the game box lid in the center of the table, and the four small boxes, including "Extinction," outside the box lid corners.
      <br/>
      2. Players each take 4 Animal Cards from the top of the stack and place them in their Animal Shelters, in the delineated areas.
      <br/>
      All cards collected are kept face-up.
      <br/>
      3. Players spin all 3 rings by twirling them between thumb and fingers inside the box lid, letting the rings lie until all have fallen. (To count as a spin, each ring must rotate several times.) The first person to spin one of each color plays first.
      <br/>
      4. Each player notes the colors on his fallen rings, locates his set of colors in the Color Codes printed across the bottom of his Animal Shelter, and takes the stated action.
      <br/>
      5. Players collect animal Cards in their Shelters, gradually forming pairs.
      <br/>
      Each pair is stacked staggered for clear visibility to all players.
      <br/>
      The goal for all players is to move pairs from their Animal Shelters up into the area marked Released in the Wild.
      <br/>
      6. When Special Action Cards are take, Code 4, they can be used at once or kept until they become most useful. (However, if they are kept until the game ends, they count against the holder.) After use, they are placed face-down at the bottom of the stack.
      <br/>
      Later use of a Special Action card constitutes the player's turn.
      <br/>
      7. Players spinning Code 6 take a Protection Pawn.
      <br/>
      Two Pawns, laid on an animal pair in a player's Shelter, protect the pair from being taken by another player.
      <br/>
      They also protect the pair from Extinction.
      <br/>
      A pair with fewer than two pawns is considered unprotected.
      <br/>
      When a player forms a new pair, he may place pawns after taking the Color Code action on his next turn.
      <br/>
      Thereafter, he may place pawns at any time or may switch pawns between pairs.
      <br/>
      8. As Animal pairs are moved into the Wild, into Extinction, or onto another player's board, any pawns on them are returned to the Pawn Bank.
      <br/>
      9. Players may trade single animal cards and protection pawns with any other willing player: card for pawn, pawn for card, or card for card.
      <br/>
      For the player requesting the trade, the trade constitutes his turn.
      <br/>
      10. The game ends when all the Animal Cards have been used up.
      <br/>
      For an optional longer game, at this point collect all player's unpaired animals, shuffle them to form a new stack, and continue playing until all animals have been paired. (Players' single animals may have to be collected and restacked more than once.)
      <br/>
      11. Highest score wins� Pairs in the Wild count 10 points each pair; Matching Pairs in the Wild, (i.e., two pairs of Pandas,) 20 points each pair; Protected Pairs in Shelters, 3 points; Unprotected Pairs, 2 points; unused Special Action Cards, minus 15 points.
      <br/>
      Ties: take turns spinning the rings; the first to spin a Code 7 wins.
      <br/>
      Note--high scores can be attained by strategic trading and use of Special Action Cards.
