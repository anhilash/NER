    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="1">The present invention relates to a fuel injection control apparatus of an internal combustion engine and a fuel injection method of an internal combustion engine.</p>
    <p num="2">
      Up to now, by carrying out a fuel control in which a desirable injection characteristic of a fuel injector can be obtained, a fuel injection control apparatus having a wide range linear characteristic area has been proposed.
      <br/>
      For example, Japanese patent application laid-open No. Hei 9-209803 discloses, in a fuel injection control apparatus constituted by including an operation condition detection means for defecting an engine operation condition, a fuel injection amount establishment means for establishing a fuel injection mount to the engine according to the detected engine operation condition, and a fuel injection control means for carrying out a fuel injection control according to the established fuel injection amount through a fuel injector.
      <br/>
      A fuel injection control apparatus for use in an internal combustion engine is characterized in that the fuel control apparatus is constituted including a correction amount establishment means for establishing a correction amount to have a desirable injection characteristic of the fuel injection amount from the fuel injector, and a fuel injection amount correction means for correcting the fuel injection mount is established by the fuel injection amount establishment means according to the established correction amount.
    </p>
    <p num="3">The above stated desirable injection characteristic is a relationship between a drive signal to the fuel injector and the fuel injection amount having the linear characteristic in which a substantially constant inclination extending over at substantially whole area.</p>
    <p num="4">
      In an engine such a lean burn engine and a cylinder-in injection gasoline engine, at a small area of the fuel injection amount, an actual fuel injection amount against a control value becomes small, namely there happens that a direction of a fuel pulse width disagrees with a direction of an increase area of the fuel amount.
      <br/>
      With the above stated reasons, an unstable use area exists in the small area of the fuel injection amount, there is a concern about inviting aggravation of the operability and the exhaust gas property.
      <br/>
      With these reasons, in the conventional example stated above, it has been proposed that the correction amount is determined to obtain that the relationship between the drive signal to the fuel injector and the fuel injection amount has the linear characteristic having a substantially constant inclination extending substantially over the whole area.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      However, when the above stated linear characteristic control is carried out or not carried out, in the area where the fuel injection amount becomes further small, it is impossible to carry out the correspondence between the fuel injection amount and the fuel injection pulse width.
      <br/>
      This area is positioned as the use impossible area and the pulse width limitation is carried out.
    </p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="6">An object according to the present invention to provide a fuel injection control apparatus and a fuel injection method wherein when the above stated pulse width limitation control is carried out, the fuel injection control can be carried out suitably, and by excepting the factors for giving the affects to the pulse width control limitation, and when it moves to other operation conditions, the operability is not damaged according to the excess operational conditions such as an over lean condition.</p>
    <p num="7">
      According to the present invention, the control where the fuel pulse width limitation is carried out, an air-fuel ratio feedback correction used in the execution of fuel pulse width or A/F (air-fuel ratio) learning correction are carried out, namely it has a characteristic when the limitation is carried out.
      <br/>
      As the means for limitation, it can employ an open control.
      <br/>
      As the fuel width limitation, there are a fuel width lower limitation and a fuel width upper limitation, however in the present invention, it is effective when the fuel width lower limitation is employed.

      FIG. 2 shows a block diagram relating to the fuel injection control apparatus of one embodiment according to the present invention.
      <br/>
      The fuel injection control apparatus of this embodiment comprises a detection means 50 for detecting the operation conditions such as the engine revolution number and the engine inhale air amount etc., a basic fuel injection amount establishment means 51, an O2 feedback correction means 52 being as one of the air-fuel ratio feedback, an A/F learning correction means 53, an addition means 55 for adding a correction coefficient according to these correction means to the basic fuel injection amount, a fuel injection amount establishment means 56 for establishing the fuel injection amount and for establishing the fuel pulse width, and a fuel injection control means 57 for carrying out the correction limitation control to control to not carry out O2 feedback correction and A/F learning correction, when the fuel injection control according to the pulse width, the fuel pulse width limitation control, and the fuel pulse width control are carried out.
      <br/>
      Other control means will be added suitably and will be permitted naturally.
    </p>
    <p num="27">
      FIG. 3 shows a relationship between the fuel injection amount Qf and the pulse width in a case where the fuel injection amount is small.
      <br/>
      In an area where the fuel injection amount is large, the fuel injection amount and the pulse width have a linear shape characteristic; however in a case where the fuel injection amount becomes small, it has a non-linear shape characteristic.
      <br/>
      In common, the specifying of the non-linear shape is defined, as shown in figure, the actual minimum pulse width is converted to a supposition point under the linear shape relationship, at TIMIN the pulse width is calculated.
      <br/>
      Namely, the pulse width on the linear shape characteristic of the same flow amount with TISMIN is requested and it is made TIMIN.
      <br/>
      In less than TISMIN, since it is impossible to carry out the fuel supply according to the minimum pulse performance, accordingly the limitation of the pulse width is carried out.
    </p>
    <p num="28">
      FIG. 4 shows the concept of the fuel injection control apparatus and the fuel injection method of the present invention.
      <br/>
      The injection pulse width limitation is established (a step 101) and it is judged that whether the injection pulse width limitation operates or not (a step 102) and in a case of "YES", the injection pulse width narrow direction correction prohibition is carried out (a step 103).
    </p>
    <p num="29">
      FIG. 5 shows the flow chart for carrying out the conventional O2 feedback correction and A/F learning correction.
      <br/>
      The operation conditions such as the engine revolution number and the engine inhale air amount etc. are detected and according to the condition amounts the basic injection pulse width calculation is carried out (a step 201).
      <br/>
      According to O2 sensor output, O2 feedback correction coefficient execution is carried out (a step 202) and according to this result O2 feedback correction is carried out (a step 203).
      <br/>
      Using A/F learning value reference value, A/F learning correction is carried out (a step 204).
      <br/>
      Accordingly, the basic injection pulse width is corrected and the injection pulse width is calculated.
      <br/>
      This injection pulse width is compared with the advanced established minimum injection pulse width and it is judged that whether the minimum pulse width is larger than the injection pulse width or not (a step 205).
      <br/>
      In a case of "YES", the injection pulse width is limited to the minimum injection pulse width (a step 206).
      <br/>
      Including this minimum injection pulse, the injection pulse having the establishment of the limitation value is called as the limitation injection pulse, and further the lower thereof is called as the lower limitation and the upper thereof is called as the upper limitation.
    </p>
    <p num="30">
      The flow chart of the fuel injection control apparatus of the embodiment according to the present invention is shown in FIG. 6.
      <br/>
      The elements which are the same as in FIG. 5 are denoted by the same reference numerals.
      <br/>
      In a step 206, when the limitation control for limiting to the minimum injection pulse width, the flag reset under the pulse width limitation is carried out (a step 213).
      <br/>
      Further, in a step 205, it is judged that whether the minimum injection pulse width is larger than the injection pulse width or not, and in a case of "NO", the flag reset under the pulse width limitation is carried out (a step 212).
    </p>
    <p num="31">
      When the flag reset under the pulse width limitation is carried out, with respect to O2 feedback, during under the pulse limitation, the execution renewal prohibition at the lean side is carried out (a step 214).
      <br/>
      The above stated step 202 and the step 214 relate to the correction coefficient executions and it is called as the correction coefficient execution step 211.
      <br/>
      Herein, the execution renewal prohibition can limit and/or prohibit literally the execution renewal or can be attained by making O2 feedback control from the close control to the open control.
    </p>
    <p num="32">
      FIG. 7A and FIG. 7B shows the time charts showing the relationship between the injection pulse, O2 (sensor) output, and the pulse width limitation.
      <br/>
      FIG. 7A shows a case where at the high rotation idling condition, the injection fuel pulse width reduces and moves toward the lean side, and the pulse width limitation (TISMIN) operates, the injection fuel slow increase increases toward the rich side, and it separates TIMIN limitation.
      <br/>
      O2 feedback correction value in which the correction is not performed according to O2 feedback is expressed by "ALPHA", and the chart before the addition of ALPHA is expressed by "before addition ALPHA", and the established fuel injection pulse width is expressed by "TIESETH".
      <br/>
      The slice level of O2 output is expressed by "SL".
      <br/>
      As shown in figure, when the pulse width is limited according to the pulse width limitation TISMIN, O2 feedback correction is prohibited, namely is limited.
      <br/>
      The limitation is not carried out to the increase direction toward ALPHA rich side.
      <br/>
      In this case, ALPHA is limited, however according to the delay in response in a short time it reverses toward the rich side.
    </p>
    <p num="33">
      To sum up, when TISMIN limitation operates, in accordance with a next ALPHA calculation timing the reduction of ALPHA is prohibited and the fuel injection pulse is calculated and as a result the move of ALPHA is limited.
      <br/>
      The limitation toward the reduction direction of ALPHA is limited only to the motion according to the close loop; however, the limitation is not limited the behavior of the open loop time.
    </p>
    <p num="34">FIG. 7B shows that by the rapid fuel injection pulse width increase, ALPHA lean side correction becomes the limitation relief at TIMIN.</p>
    <p num="35">
      FIG. 8 shows the flow chart of the ordinary A/F learning value execution.
      <br/>
      According to O2 sensor output, O2 sensor output reversal judgment is carried out (a step 301) and O2 feedback correction coefficient execution is carried out (a step 302).
      <br/>
      Next, it is judged that whether O2 sensor output is normal or not, and in a case of "YES", O2 feedback correction coefficient average value execution is carried out (a step 304) and it is judged that whether O2 sensor output is reversed with a predetermined number or not (a step 305), and in a case of "YES", O2 feedback correction coefficient average value is renewed to A/F leaning value (a step 306).
    </p>
    <p num="36">
      FIG. 9 shows the fuel injection control apparatus of another embodiment according to the present invention.
      <br/>
      The elements same to in FIG. 8 are denoted the same reference numerals.
      <br/>
      In FIG. 9, the flag of the pulse value limitation is risen, it is judged that whether the output pulse is during the limitation or not (a step 307) and in a case of "YES", it returns END and a step 306 in which A/F leaning value renewal is carried is skipped.
      <br/>
      FIG. 10 shows the relationship between the injection pulse, O2 (sensor) output, and A/F learning correction.
    </p>
    <p num="37">
      Relating to the learning prohibition means under the minimum pulse width limitation, in A/F learning control the deviation is learned during the standard conditions requested under the condition of O2 feedback, and this is learning stored as an error of the air-fuel ratio of the individual.
      <br/>
      The stored value is reflected in the fuel injection amount which is the operational parameter of the air-fuel ratio.
      <br/>
      By repeating this operation, the learning value becomes the value for correcting the air-fuel ratio control error of the individual and as a result the control accuracy in the air-fuel ratio can be heightened.
    </p>
    <p num="38">
      Accordingly, to reflect exactly the air-fuel ratio control error of the individual by the learning value, it is necessary to carry out sound O2 feedback.
      <br/>
      Herein, in general the renewal of the learning value is carried out, when the parameter used in O2 feedback control is monitored and after that it is judged that the parameter is the sound condition.
    </p>
    <p num="39">
      For example, O2 sensor detects the air-fuel ratio by the oxygen temperature in the components of the exhaust gas which is the input signal of O2 feedback control and in O2 sensor when the activation is insufficient, the output voltage against the rich condition and the lean condition is smaller than that of after the activation.
      <br/>
      Further, the responsibility against the oxygen concentration change in the exhaust gas is slower than that of the after activation.
      <br/>
      Utilizing this phenomenon, in O2 feedback condition, when the change-over of the rich condition and the lean condition is slower dominantly than that of the after activation, the processing for prohibiting not to carry out the learning value renewal according to the result of O2 feedback condition is carried out.
    </p>
    <p num="40">
      On the other hand, when the limitation of the minimum injection pulse width operates, since O2 feedback control does not function normally, the prohibition of the learning value renewal is the desirable condition.
      <br/>
      Herein, as to the prohibition of the learning value renewal, following method for prohibiting using the already known learning value renewal prohibition.
    </p>
    <p num="41">The judgment for judging the above stated change-over of the rich condition and the lean condition being slow with the predetermined time is carried out as following, namely the time in which between the output of O2 sensor transits from the high condition of the predetermined voltage to the low condition or from the low condition to the high condition is measured by a timer counter and using the measurement result the judgment is carried out.</p>
    <p num="42">Herein, when the limitation of the minimum injection pulse width operates, it established the value for judging whether the timer counter does not carry out the learning value renewal and, in the learning allowance condition judgment at a point where the output of O2 sensor transits from the high condition of the predetermined voltage to the low condition or from the low condition to the high condition, since the non-allowance judgment is done, as a result it is possible to carry out without the renewal of the learning value.</p>
    <p num="43">
      Further, according to this fuel injection method according to the present invention, under the conditions where the operation condition of the engine exists at the vicinity of the minimum injection pulse limitation and repeats the operation and the non-operation of the minimum injection pulse width limitation, the learning value renewal can be prohibited.
      <br/>
      To consist with the renewal of the learning value, it is necessary to experience the plural times of the change-over of the rich condition and the lean condition, in general it requires several seconds, under the operation history of the minimum injection pulse limitation, it is desirable to prohibit the learning value renewal.
      <br/>
      And according to the above stated methods, using the timer counter it is effective as the control method to express the history.
    </p>
    <p num="44">In figures, MVPP expresses MAX-MIN output difference of one period of O2 sensor and more than the predetermined value the learning allowance (OK) becomes.</p>
    <p num="45">
      According to the present invention, when the pulse width limitation control is carried out, since the air-fuel feedback correction control such as O2 feedback or A/F learning correction control can be prohibited or limited, when it moves other operation conditions, it invites the excess operation condition such as the over-lean, as a result there is no afraid that the operability is damaged.
      <br/>
      Further, in company with this the suitable fuel injection can be carried out.
