      Alkylation, aralkylation, acylation or aroylation of aromatic compound involves electrophilic substitution of H from the aromatic nucleus of the aromatic compound.

      It is well known in the prior art that the electrophilic substitution is favoured by the presence of electron donating groups, such as OH, alkyl, alkoxy, phenoxy, amine, alkyl amine, SH etc., in the aromatic compound.
      <br/>
      Whereas the electrophilic substitution is inhibited by the presence of electron withdrawing groups such as halo, nitro, cyano, carboxy, aldehyde, etc, in the aromatic compound, �ref, G. A. Olah, in Friedel-Crafts and related reactions, Wiley-Interscience Publ., New York, 1963�.

      (ii) heating the catalyst mass obtained from the step-i to dryness at a temperature of about 25 (degree)  C. to about 250 (degree)  C. under vacuum or in presence of air or inert gas, calcining the dried mass obtained from step-ii at a temperature of about, 100 (degree)  C. to about 700 (degree)  C. under vacuum or in presence of air or inert gas for about 0.1 h to about 100 h;
    </p>
    <p num="46">In the catalyst preparation process of this invention, the porous catalyst carrier or support, S, is selected from micro- and/or meso porous zeolites and zeolite-like materials, synthetic and natural clays, silica gel, alumina and meso and/or macroporous catalyst carriers containing SiO2, Al2 O3, SiC, ZrO2, HfO2 or a mixture thereof, and more preferably, S is selected from mesoporous zeolites such as high silica MCM-41 and the like, silica gel, cation exchange clays such as montmorillonite clay and the like, and chemically inert or sintered low surface area macroporous catalyst carriers or supports containing SiO2, Al2 O3, SiC, ZrO2, HfO2 1or a mixture thereof.</p>

    <p num="49">In the catalyst preparation process of this invention, said mixed metal oxides or halides (Aa MZb) are responsible for the catalytic activity and the main roles played by the porous catalyst carrier or support (S) are (i) to disperse the active catalyst components (said metal oxides or halides) uniformly and thereby increasing their surface area, (ii) to avoid sintering of said active catalyst components during the catalyst calcination, (iii) to provide high mechanical strength against crushing and/or abrasion to the catalyst during its use in the reaction and (iv) to ease the filtration of the catalyst from the reaction mixtures The said catalyst without catalyst carrier or support may be used for the Friedel-Crafts reactions but said catalyst with catalyst carrier or support is certainly more preferable.</p>
    <p num="50">In the catalyst preparation process of this invention, the presence of more than one metallic element in said active catalyst mass (Aa MZb) is essential for obtaining a synergetic effect, and thereby increasing the catalytic activity of said catalyst.</p>
    <p num="51">In the catalyst preparation process of this invention, said mixed metal compounds (Aa MEe) are catalyst precursors which are converted to mixed metal oxides directly by thermal decomposition or by hydrolysis or co-precipitation followed by calcination or decomposition at said calcination conditions.</p>

      1.
      <br/>
      The supported catalysts of this invention has a number of advantages over the earlier homogeneous catalysts used for the Friedel-Crafts reactions, as follows:
    </p>
    <p num="142">According to this invention</p>
    <p num="143">
      i) the catalyst used for the Friedel-Crafts reaction is heterogeneous solid catalyst and hence it can be separated from the reaction products simply by filtration, and moreover since the catalysts are supported ones, their filtration is easier,
      <br/>
      ii) the separated catalysts can be reused in the process for a number of times, and
      <br/>
      iii) also the catalysts are non corrosive, therefore most of the serious problems associated with homogeneous catalyst used in the earlier homogeneous catalysed Friedel-Crafts reactions are overcome by the supported solid catalysts of this invention.

    <p num="144">
      2, The catalysts of this invention have also number of advantages over the prior art solid catalysts used for the Friedel-Crafts reactions, as follows:
      <br/>
      i) The activity of the catalysts of this invention in the Friedel-Crafts reactions is higher.
      <br/>
      ii) The catalysts of the present invention can be used for the Friedel-Crafts reactions involving reactants of any molecular size i.e. for both small and big reactant molucules.
      <br/>
      iii) By using the catalysts of this invention, the Friedel-Crafts reactions can be carried out at mild reaction conditions even though when the aromatic compound does not contain any aromatic nucleus activating group or electron donating group, for example when aromatic compound is benzene, or also when the aromatic compound contains electron withdrawing group, such as halide, which has highly deactivating effect on the aromatic nucleus for the alkylation, aralkylation, acylation or aroylation reaction.

    <p num="145">The main advantages of the catalytic process of this invention over the prior art processes for the aralkylation of aromatic compound are as follows:</p>
    <p num="146">1) The process of this invention has a number of advantages over the earlier homogeneous catalyzed processes for the preparation of aralkylated aromatic compounds, as follows:</p>
    <p num="147">
      In the process of this invention,
      <br/>
      i) the catalyst used is heterogeneous solid catalyst and hence it can be separated from the reaction products simply by filtration,
      <br/>
      ii) the separated catalysts can be reused in the process for a number of times, and
      <br/>
      iii) also the catalyst is non corrosive, therefore most of the serious problems associated with homogeneous catalyst used in the earlier homogeneous catalyzed processes for the preparation of aralkylated aromatic compounds are overcome in the process of this invention.
    </p>
    <p num="148">
      2) The process of this invention has also number of advantages over the prior art processes based on the use of solid catalyst for the aralkylation of aromatic compounds, as follows:
      <br/>
      i) The activity of the said catalyst used in the process of present invention is much higher and hence the reaction is much faster and thereby the time required for completing the reaction is much shorter,
      <br/>
      ii) The process of the present invention can be used for aralkyating both small and large size aromatic compounds with both small and large size aralkylating agents to produce the corresponding aralkylated compounds, using said supported solid catalyst containing meso- or macroporous catalyst carrier.
      <br/>
      iii) In the process of this invention, since moisture-free inert gas is bubbled through the reaction mixture continuously, said by-product formed in the reaction is removed continuously and thereby the reverse aralkylation reaction is avoided or minimised, thus requiring shorter time for completing the reaction.
      <br/>
      iv) In the process of this invention, by using pressure higher than 1 atm, it is possible to carry out the aralkylation reaction at a temperature higher than the normal boiling point of either of the reactants and the solvent, and thereby the reaction period for completing the reaction is shortened and/or the inhibition of the reaction due to strong adsorption of the reactants, products or solvent on the catalyst is avoided or minimised,
      <br/>
      v) By the process of this invention, even the aralkylation of benzene, naphthalene or anthracene, which does not contain any aromatic ring activating electron donating group such as alkyl, alkoxy, hydroxy etc. group, at mild reaction conditions is rapid and hence accomplished at shorter reaction periods.
      <br/>
      vi) Moreover, using the supported solid catalyst of this invention, a rapid aralkylation of aromatic compound is possible even when the reaction mixture contains moisture; the catalyst is not deactivated by the presence of moisture in the reaction mixture.
