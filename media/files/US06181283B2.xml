    <heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">The present invention relates to radio communication devices such as cellular telephones and PCS devices and, more particularly, to a selectively removable combined battery pack and antenna assembly for use with such devices.</p>
    <heading>DESCRIPTION OF THE PRIOR ART</heading>
    <p num="3">
      Radio transmission from a portable wireless devices, such as a cellular telephone or PCS device, is accomplished through an antenna or antenna structure.
      <br/>
      A variety of antenna structures are known, and include dipole, helical, patch, and other variants.
      <br/>
      Antenna structures have been disposed on the handset body and have not typically been designed for selective removal from the handset.
      <br/>
      Typically, antenna structures are disposed on a handset of the portable wireless device and are not intended to be removed or released away from the handset body.
      <br/>
      As a result, in the normal course of user operation the antenna structure remains attached to a handset of the wireless device.
      <br/>
      Wireless communications devices also include a battery assembly for cord-free operation.
      <br/>
      Rechargeable battery packs which are releasable away from the handset are also known, and permit battery recharging apart from the communication device.
      <br/>
      In the past, the rechargeable battery pack and antenna structure have been separately and discretely disposed on or relative to the handset.
      <br/>
      For example, selective release of the battery pack away from a typical handset would not disrupt the positional relationship between the antenna structure and the handset.
    </p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="4">
      One aspect of the present invention provides an antenna structure which is disposed within or upon a selectively removable or detachable assembly of the communication device.
      <br/>
      The selectively releasable portion may be a rechargeable battery assembly of the communication device.
      <br/>
      A coupling device operatively couples the battery assembly and the antenna assembly to the communication device.
      <br/>
      The coupling device may include a separate coax coupler and one or more dc coupling contact structures.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, the coupling device may include a combined rf and dc coupling structure, for instance a coax line with a dc blocking componentry.
      <br/>
      The inventive antenna assembly can be used for hand-held communication devices, such as cellular telephones, PCS devices, or any other radio communication system.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      Another aspect of the present invention provides a particular antenna structure which is disposed upon a removable battery assembly of an associated radio communication device.
      <br/>
      The antenna structure may include a displaceable active element, which may be supported by a movable support element and which may be pivoted into its operational orientation relative to the removable battery assembly.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      Another aspect of the present invention provides a patch antenna structure which is disposed upon a removable battery assembly of an associated radio communication device.
      <br/>
      The patch antenna may be disposed at an upper portion of the removable battery assembly and away from a user's hand during intended operation of the radio communication device.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      Another aspect of the present invention provides a slot antenna structure which is disposed upon a removable battery assembly of an associated radio communication device.
      <br/>
      The slot antenna may be disposed at an upper portion of the removable battery assembly and away from a user's hand during intended operation of the radio communication device.
    </p>
    <p num="8">Yet another aspect of the present invention provides a combined antenna and battery assembly, housed within a structure for releasable securement to the phoneset of the wireless device, wherein the antenna assembly is positioned near an upper portion of the releasable securement structure and the battery assembly is positioned near a lower portion of the releaseable securement structure.</p>

      <br/>
      Similarly, the ground plane element 74 may be a discrete conductive panel, a portion of the ground plane of the transceiver electronics, or a metallic portion of the battery pack.
      <br/>
      To reduce the size of the antenna assembly 70, one or more dielectric layers 76 may be disposed between the ground plane 74 and the dipole element 72.
    </p>
    <p num="17">
      As shown in FIGS. 1 and 2, the dipole element 72 of the antenna structure 70 is disposed upon a movable support member 78.
