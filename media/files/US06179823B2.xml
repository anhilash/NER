      Multiple use universal connector designed for use in various containers having a fluid port for accessing to the content of the container or for transferring fluid into the container.
      <br/>
      The multiple use universal connector incorporates a diaphragm capable of being penetrated repeatedly by an access means such as a luer connector or a syringe having a sharp or blunt cannula for fluid communication between the content of the container and the access means.
      <br/>
      The multiple use universal connector re-seals itself after being penetrated and the access means removed therefrom.

      Parenteral fluids, such as therapeutic drugs, diagnostic contrast media and nutrients are conventionally administered to a patient from a container, such as a collapsible bag or bottle having a fluid exit port.
      <br/>
      The fluid exit port may include means, such as a tube, spike or cannula, the distal end of which is in communication with the fluid content of the container and the proximal end of which is connected to the desired site on the patient.
      <br/>
      Conventionally, the proximal end of said means includes a needle that can puncture the patient.
      <br/>
      The fluid exit port is sealed by a membrane which is punctured by inserting a spike into the exit port when fluid delivery is desired.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      One approach used by the prior art to penetrate the membrane covering the fluid exit port comprises the use of syringes or spikes which carry the danger of accidental injuries caused by the sharp points of the needles and spikes.
      <br/>
      Such injuries accidentally inflicted on the health practitioner carry the further risk of getting infected with diseases such as AIDS.
      <br/>
      In order to reduce the danger of accidental injuries, spikes having relatively blunt tips were used.
      <br/>
      However, such spikes puncture a large area of the membrane and once the spikes are removed the membrane no longer seals the fluid exit port.
    </p>
    <p num="7">Another approach used by the prior art is the provision of a tubular member which is more blunt than a spike so that it is unlikely to penetrate the skin yet capable of penetrating the latex diaphragm type seals.</p>
    <p num="8">Still another approach used by the prior art is a valve positioned in the fluid exit port, the valve being operable by engagement with a spikeless or needleless IV component and contains a resilient valve disc positioned in the fluid passageway and blocks fluid flow when the disc is in the closed position, and allows fluid flow when the disc is in the open position.</p>
    <p num="9">
      Still another needleless connector of the prior art uses a resilient conical valve head in a housing.
      <br/>
      The conical valve head is positioned against the valve seat to form a seal.
      <br/>
      When the male fitting of a syringe, or some other device, is inserted into the inlet of the housing, it pushes the tip portion of the resilient valve head inwardly so that the valve head is deformed away from the valve seat thereby allowing fluid communication.
      <br/>
      In still other embodiments of the prior art, a needleless connector includes an elastomeric conical valve head biased against a conical valve seat by a helical spring to form a seal.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      The above generally described devices have greatly reduced the needle-stick injuries associated with the use of syringes.
      <br/>
      The devices also advanced the prior art by providing convenient connectors which can be easily connected to the containers of medical fluids.
    </p>
    <p num="11">
      However, there still exists the need to provide a universal connector which may be used with a wide variety of connection sites.
      <br/>
      A seal or diaphragm is a main component of the herein-described invention which does not require penetration by any sharp or even blunt object in order to establish fluid communication between the content of the container and the site of delivery.
      <br/>
      The seal or diaphragm serves as access means and provides for hermetic sealing, safe handling, sterilization and storing.
      <br/>
      The seal or diaphragm is designed for multiple use so that the medical fluid can be accessed repeatedly.
      <br/>
      After each withdrawal of the desired amount of the medical fluid, the seal or diaphragm self-seals itself thereby preventing contamination of the medical fluid by air-born particles such as dust and bacteria.
    </p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="12">
      In accordance with the present invention there is provided a multiple use universal connector which can be used to repeatedly access the fluid content of a container or to repeatedly transfer a fluid into the container.
      <br/>
      The multiple use universal connector can be used in collapsible and non-collapsible bags, bottles and vials made of glass or polymeric material which contain a fluid exit port into which the universal connector is inserted sealing the fluid exit port.
      <br/>
      The fluid contained in the container may be a therapeutic liquid, diagnostic media or a nutritional formula which can be sterilized in bulk and then aseptically transferred into the container or it can be sterilized in the container stoppered with the universal connector.
      <br/>
      The multiple use universal connector is made of rigid or semi-rigid polymeric materials such as polyvinyl chloride, polyethylene and polypropylene.
    </p>
    <p num="13">
      The fluid in a container stoppered by the multiple use universal connector can be accessed by means well-known in the art, such as syringes having sharp or blunt needle cannulas.
      <br/>
      Preferably, the access means comprises a luer connector in order to prevent accidental injuries to health care workers and patients caused by the use of syringes.
    </p>
    <p num="14">The multiple use universal connector comprises:</p>
    <p num="15">
      (1) a connector body of tube-like configuration the distal end of which is designed to be slideably insertable into the fluid exit port, and the proximal end of which is designed to seal the content of the container by an elastomeric membrane and also to receive a removable cap; and
      <br/>
      (2) a removable cap threaded onto the proximal end of the connector which, prior to use, is removed so that the content of the container could be accessed by the use of a luer connector having a configuration that is similar to the configuration of the cap or by other access means, such as sharp or blunt needle cannulas.
    </p>
    <p num="16">
      The elastomeric membrane sealing the proximal end of the universal connector is of an inert, gas-impermeable polymeric material capable of flexing under internal or external pressures such as exerted thereon during steam sterilization.
      <br/>
      It preferably has a thickness of from about 0.001 mm to about 1.00 mm and a durometer of from about 25 to about 80 Shore A. It is capable of being ruptured by the twisting motion of a blunt luer connector or syringes having sharp or blunt needle cannula.
      <br/>
      The configuration of the elastomeric membrane is M-shaped having vertical leg portions and a top surface resembling a cup shape.
    </p>
    <p num="17">The tube-like body of the universal connector further comprises: first cap-locking ring on the proximal end of the body which serves as a male thread to receive the removable cap; and second cap-locking ring spaced from the first cap-locking ring towards the distal end of the tube-like body, which serves as stopping means for the cap when the cap is threaded onto the tube-like body of the universal connector.</p>

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="33">
      Referring to FIGS. 1, 2A, 2B, 2C and 2D, there is shown an intravenous bag 10 of conventional generally rectangular configuration made of inert, flexible, polymeric material, such as polyvinylchloride.
      <br/>
      The multiple use universal connector of the present invention will be described in reference to such flexible, polymeric bags, however, the multiple use universal connector can be used with other fluid containers such as bottles and vials of various configurations made of rigid or semi-rigid materials.
      <br/>
      Such containers will have fluid exit ports into which the universal connector can slideably be attached or it can be an integral part thereof.
      <br/>
      The IV bag 10 contains a medical fluid 12 therein, such as a therapeutic, diagnostic or nutritional preparation.
      <br/>
      The medical fluid 12 may be pre-sterilized in bulk prior to its transfer to the IV bag, or it may be sterilized in the IV bag using sterilizing equipment and techniques known in the art.
      <br/>
      The IV bag further comprises a fluid exit port or tube 14 the distal end 16 of which is in communication with medical fluid 12 and the proximal end 18 of which is to slideably receive distal end 32 of multiple use universal connector 30.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, multiple use universal connector 30 may be integral with fluid exit port or tube 14 of IV bag 10.
      <br/>
      In both cases, fluid exit port or tube 14 is sealed into IV bag 10 by bottom seam 20 of IV bag 10.
      <br/>
      On the proximal end 34 of multiple use universal connector 30, cap 60 is mounted having internal thread means thereon for enclosing said proximal end 34.
      <br/>
      Prior to use, cap 60 is removed from multiple use universal connector 30 for engagement with a luer connector.
    </p>
    <p num="34">FIG. 2A shows the multiple use universal connector without the cap; FIG. 2B shows the multiple use universal connector with the cap; and FIG. 2D shows the cap, all views being shown in perspective.</p>

      <br/>
      First cap-locking ring serves as a male thread to receive cap 60 and to engage its internal threads 66 and 66'. Second cap-locking ring 42 having proximal end 41 has a larger external diameter than the distance defined by a line connecting internal threads 66-66' located at the proximal end 68 of cap 60.
      <br/>
      Second cap locking-ring 42 serves as stopping means for cap 60 when cap 60 is threaded onto the multiple use universal connector 30.
    </p>
    <p num="40">
      Inside wall 36 of multiple use universal connector 30 comprises: a distal end 50 and proximal end 52.
      <br/>
      Distal end 50 is designed to slideably and sealingly engage fluid exit port or tube 14 to slide into the fluid exit port through its proximal end 18.
    </p>
    <p num="41">
      At the proximal end 52 of multiple use universal connector 30 a cylindrical opening is defined by side wall 54 and bottom wall 56.

      Bottom wall 56 and side wall 54 of cylindrical opening in multiple use universal connector 30, as best seen in FIG. 3B and FIG. 4A, contain an elastomeric diaphragm 90 bonded to the universal connector.
      <br/>
      The elastomeric diaphragm is of an M-shaped configuration and seals the fluid channel defined by the proximal end of inside wall 52 of universal connector 30.
      <br/>
      The diaphragm is of inert gas-impermeable polymeric material capable of flexing under internal or external pressures such as exerted during steam sterilization.
      <br/>
      The diaphragm has a durometer of from about 25 to about 80 Shore A. Suitable elastomeric materials for constructing the diaphragm include:

    </p>
    <p num="45">a horizontal bottom portion 96; and</p>
    <p num="46">
      side portion 98 which enclose an obtuse angle between them.

      However, the slit does not penetrate the bottom surface.
      <br/>
      The unpenetrated membrane, denoted by the numeral 106, is typically of from about 0.001 mm to about 2.0 mm. The unpenetrated membrane maintains the content of the container, in which the multiple use universal connector is used, in sealed condition.
      <br/>
      In use, when this membrane is ruptured by an external access means, such as a needle cannula, luer connector or spike, fluid communication is established between the content of the container and the external access means.
      <br/>
      Upon disengaging the external access means for the multiple use universal connector, the cup-shaped portion of the diaphragm reseals itself for the reason that the membrane is resilient and springs back to its original configuration.

    <p num="111">Materials of Construction</p>
    <p num="112">
      The materials of construction is essentially the same as for the first embodiment of the present invention.
      <br/>
      The flexible container of the present invention is made of known polymeric materials having properties which make them suitable for sterile delivery of parenteral liquids.
      <br/>
      The sheets for forming the walls of the container are preferably multilayer sheets and characterized by heat resistance, gloss, strength, flexibility, and chemical inertness.
      <br/>
      Preferably the sheets are transparent or at least translucent enabling visual inspection of the contents at all times during delivery of content form the container to the patient.
      <br/>
      The container must be sterilizable, preferably by heat, along with its content.
      <br/>
      At least one layer of the sheet must be impervious to atmospheric gases and to steam.
      <br/>
      Preferably, the internal surface of the pouch in contact with the parenteral solution therein should be impervious to gas and steam.
      <br/>
      The interior layer in contact with the parenteral solution must not contain any toxic agents or even plasticizers which could leach out and contaminate the solution.
      <br/>
      The sheet may be made, for example, from polyvinylidene chloride sandwiched between two polyethylene or polyvinylacetate layers.
      <br/>
      The polyvinylidene chloride constitutes the impervious barrier.
      <br/>
      Further layers may be added to the face or back of the sheet, if desired, such as a polyolefin, preferably, polyethylene.
      <br/>
      Polyvinyl chloride is also suitable for the construction of the sheet and is well-accepted by the prior art for use in containers for medical fluid collection and delivery.
      <br/>
      Typical properties of polyvinyl chloride films include: a thickness of about 380 micron; a tensile strength of about 240 kg/cm2 ; a moisture vapor transmission rate of about 14-20 (g/m2 /day at 38 (degree)  C., 100% RH); and an oxygen barrier of 650 (cc/m2 /day at 23 (degree)  C., 0% RH, bar.
      <br/>
      CRYOVAC.RTM. sterlizable medical films (W. R. Grace and Co.) are especially suitable to construct the sheets used in the present invention.
      <br/>
      The films comprise a polyethylene layer sandwiched between polyester outer layers sealed together by a modified propylene copolymer.
      <br/>
      Typical properties of the film include: a thickness of about 190 micron; a tensile strength of about 250 kg/cm2 ; a moisture vapor transmission rate of 5 (g/m2 /day at 38 (degree)  C., 100% RH); and an oxygen barrier of about 1500 (cc/m2 /day at 23 (degree)  C., 0% RH, bar).
    </p>
    <p num="113">
      Other polymeric films or sheets constructing the universal, flexible container of the present invention include: copolyester ether monolayer films, such as polycyclohexanedimethylcyclohexane, dicarboxylate elastomer made by Eastman Kodak Co.; and ethyl vinyl acetate made by Stedim, Inc.
      <br/>
      It is important that the fluid contacting layer of the multilayer sheet contain no plasticizer which may contaminate the fluid content of the container.
      <br/>
      Preferably, no plasticizer should be used at all on any of the multilayers to form the universal, flexible container of the present invention.
    </p>
    <p num="114">
      The sheets used in the present invention may be embossed with the described configuration by techniques known in the art.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, the layer constituting the internal liquid contacting layer of the sheet may be embossed prior to forming the multilayer sheets.
    </p>
    <p num="115">
      Access ports and tubing used in the present invention may be made of polyvinyl chloride which are sold commercially for use in medical devices.
      <br/>
      Other port and tubing materials may also be used, such as CRYOVAC.RTM. Port Tubing (W. R. Grace &amp; Co.) which comprise three concentric layers of polymeric materials: a polyolefin layer is sandwiched between an outer layer of modified propylene copolymer and an inner layer of ethylene vinyl acetate or polyvinyl chloride.
    </p>
    <p num="116">Process of Making the Container</p>
    <p num="117">
      The flexible plastic container in the form of a bag, pouch or bottle is made of two rectangular sheets of polymeric materials one of which is embossed and flat welded together on four sides so as to define between the two sheets and the four welded sides a reservoir.
      <br/>
      The volume of the container is zero before it is filled and typically has an internal volume capacity of from about 50 to about 5,000 ml when it is filled with a medical fluid, such as a parenteral solution.
      <br/>
      Access ports 330 or 330', 402 or 402', and 422 or 422' are sealed by the same welding process used to seal the two superimposed layers of sheets together at the center C or C' of the container 310 or 310'. Upon completion of the welding process the container is suspended via holes 321 or 321', followed by filling the container through the IV access port equipped with the multiple use universal connector with the desired medical fluid.
    </p>
    <p num="118">
      In the process of delivering the medical fluid to a patient using the IV access port equipped with the multiple use universal connector, the container 310 or 310' is suspended via hole 317 or 317', cap 60 or 60' is removed and a luer connector or similar means is engaged with the IV access port.
      <br/>
      If fluid delivery is desired using the needle or spike access ports, the container is suspended via hole 17 or 17', crimp seal 106 or 126 is severed and needle or spike is inserted into the respective ports to enable delivery of the medical fluid to the desired site on the patient.
