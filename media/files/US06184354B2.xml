    <heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="3">The present invention relates in general to crystalline compositions of macrophage colony stimulating factor "M-CSF" and in particular to methods for the use of structural information (including X-ray diffraction patterns) of crystalline M-CSF for agonist and antagonist production, as well as assays for detection of same.</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="4">
      Monocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor is produced by a variety of cells, including macrophages, endothelial cells and fibroblasts (see, Ralph et al., "The Molecular and Biological Properties of the Human and Murine Members of the CSF-1 Family" in Molecular Basis of Lymphokine Action, Humana Press, Inc., (1987), which is incorporated herein by reference). M-CSF is composed of two "monomer" polypeptides, which form a biologically active dimeric M-CSF protein (hereinafter referred to as "M-CSF dimer"). M-CSF belongs to a group of biological agonists that promote the production of blood cells.
      <br/>
      Specifically, it acts as a growth and differentiation factor for bone marrow progenitor cells of the mononuclear phagocyte lineage.
      <br/>
      Further, M-CSF stimulates the proliferation and function of mature macrophages via specific receptors on responding cells.
      <br/>
      In clinical trials M-CSF has shown promise as a pharmaceutical agent in the correction of blood cell deficiencies arising as a side-effect of chemotherapy or radiation therapy for cancer and may be beneficial in treating fungal infections associated with bone marrow transplants. M-CSF may also play significant biological roles in pregnancy, uveitis, and atherosclerosis.
      <br/>
      Development of M-CSF agonists or antagonists may prove to be of value in modifying the biological events involved in these conditions.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      M-CSF exists in at least three mature forms: short (M-CSF ALPHA ), intermediate (M-CSF GAMMA ), and long (M-CSF BETA ).
      <br/>
      Mature M-CSF is defined as including polypeptide sequences contained within secreted M-CSF following amino terminus processing to remove leader sequences and carboxyl terminus processing to remove domains including a putative transmembrane region.
      <br/>
      The variations in the three mature forms are due to alternative mRNA splicing (see, Cerretti et al.
      <br/>
      Molecular Immunology, 25:761 (1988)).
      <br/>
      The three forms of M-CSF are translated from different mRNA precursors, which encode polypeptide monomers of 256 to 554 amino acids, having a 32 amino acid signal sequence at the amino terminal and a putative transmembrane region of approximately 23 amino acids near the carboxyl terminal.
      <br/>
      The precursor peptides are subsequently processed by amino terminal and carboxyl terminal proteolytic cleavages to release mature M-CSF.
      <br/>
      Residues 1-149 of all three mature forms of M-CSF are identical and are believed to contain sequences essential for biological activity of M-CSF.
      <br/>
      In vivo M-CSF monomers are dimerized via disulfide-linkage and are glycosylated.
      <br/>
      Some, if not all, forms of M-CSF can be recovered in membrane-associated form.
      <br/>
      Such membrane-bound M-CSF may be cleaved to release secreted M-CSF.
      <br/>
      Membrane associated M-CSF is believed to have biological activity similar to M-CSF, but may have other activities including cell--cell association or activation.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      Polypeptides, including the M-CSFs, have a three-dimensional structure determined by the primary amino acid sequence and the environment surrounding the polypeptide.
      <br/>
      This three-dimensional structure establishes the polypeptide's activity, stability, binding affinity, binding specificity, and other biochemical attributes.
      <br/>
      Thus, a knowledge of a protein's three-dimensional structure can provide much guidance in designing agents that mimic, inhibit, or improve its biological activity in soluble or membrane bound forms.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      The three-dimensional structure of a polypeptide may be determined in a number of ways.
      <br/>
      Many of the most precise methods employ X-ray crystallography (for a general review, see, Van Holde, Physical Biochemistry, Prentice-Hall, N.J. pp. 221-239, (1971), which is incorporated herein by reference).
      <br/>
      This technique relies on the ability of crystalline lattices to diffract X-rays or other forms of radiation.
      <br/>
      Diffraction experiments suitable for determining the three dimensional structure of macromolecules typically require high-quality crystals.
      <br/>
      Unfortunately, such crystals have been unavailable for M-CSF as well as many other proteins of interest.
      <br/>
      Thus, high-quality, diffracting crystals of M-CSF would assist the determination of its three-dimensional structure.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      Various methods for preparing crystalline proteins and polypeptides are known in the art (see, for example, McPherson, et al. "Preparation and Analysis of Protein Crystals", A. McPherson, Robert E. Krieger Publishing Company, Malabar, Fla. (1989); Weber, Advances in Protein Chemistry 41:1-36 (1991); U.S. Pat. No. 4,672,108; and U.S. Pat. No. 4,833,233; all of which are incorporated herein by reference for all purposes).
      <br/>
      Although there are multiple approaches to crystallizing polypeptides, no single set of conditions provides a reasonable expectation of success, especially when the crystals must be suitable for X-ray diffraction studies.
      <br/>
      Thus, in spite of significant research, many proteins remain uncrystallized.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      In addition to providing structural information, crystalline polypeptides provide other advantages.
      <br/>
      For example, the crystallization process itself further purifies the polypeptide, and satisfies one of the classical criteria for homogeneity.
      <br/>
      In fact, crystallization frequently provides unparalleled purification quality, removing impurities that are not removed by other purification methods such as HPLC, dialysis, conventional column chromatography, etc.
      <br/>
      Moreover, crystalline polypeptides are often stable at ambient temperatures and free of protease contamination and other degradation associated with solution storage.
      <br/>
      Crystalline polypeptides may also be useful as pharmaceutical preparations.
      <br/>
      Finally, crystallization techniques in general are largely free of problems such as denaturation associated with other stabilization methods (e.g. lyophilization).
      <br/>
      Thus, there exists a significant need for preparing M-CSF compositions in crystalline form and determining their three-dimensional structure.
      <br/>
      The present invention fulfills this and other needs.
      <br/>
      Once crystallization has been accomplished, crystallographic data provides useful structural information which may assist the design of peptides that may serve as agonists or antagonists.
      <br/>
      In addition, the crystal structure provides information useful to map, the receptor binding domain which could then be mimicked by a small non-peptide molecule which may serve as an antagonist or agonist.
    </p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="10">
      The present invention provides crystalline forms of M-CSF dimers.
      <br/>
      Preferably, the dimers are formed from polypeptides containing between 146 to 162 amino acids residues at or near the N-terminus of mature M-CSF (e.g. glu1 glu2 val3 . . . ).
      <br/>
      In a specific embodiment, the polypeptide includes residues 4 to 158 of mature M-CSF ALPHA  polypeptide, preferably in the non-glycosylated form.
    </p>
    <p num="11">
      Another aspect of the invention provides a method of crystallizing an M-CSF.
      <br/>
      A preferred crystallization method according to the present invention includes the following steps: mixing a preselected, substantially pure M-CSF dimer and a precipitant to form an M-CSF mixture; precipitating crystalline M-CSF from the mixture; and isolating the M-CSF in crystalline form.
      <br/>
      In some specific embodiments, the precipitant contains polyethylene glycol.
      <br/>
      Other components such as ammonium sulfate and/or other ionic compounds may be added to the solution.
      <br/>
      It has been found by x-ray crystallography that M-CSF produced by the method of the present invention can crystallize into the P21 21 21 space groups for example.
    </p>
    <p num="12">
      Variations of the crystallization method are also provided.
      <br/>
      For example, the step of precipitating crystals from the M-CSF mixture may involve equilibrating the M-CSF mixture with a second mixture.
      <br/>
      The second mixture is typically a solution that consists of a higher concentration of precipitant than the first M-CSF mixture.
      <br/>
      The step of equilibrating preferably consists of applying the M-CSF mixture to a surface and allowing the applied M-CSF mixture to come into equilibrium with a reservoir of the second mixture.
      <br/>
      In other embodiments, the step of precipitating M-CSF crystals is initiated by seeding the M-CSF mixture with seed crystals or altering the temperature of the M-CSF mixture.
      <br/>
      Another aspect of the invention involves identifying compounds that have structures that mimic a receptor binding region of the three-dimensional structure of M-CSF to varying degrees and can in many instances function as M-CSF agonists or antagonists.
      <br/>
      Compounds that interact with the receptor-binding region of M-CSF may be antagonists.
      <br/>
      The three-dimensional alpha-carbon coordinates of a truncated M-CSF dimer is presented in Appendix 1.
      <br/>
      In one embodiment of the present invention, the three-dimensional structure of M-CSF is obtained by first crystallizing an M-CSF dimer (having M-CSF receptor-binding residues) to form at least one M-CSF crystal.
      <br/>
      Next, a source of radiation is used for irradiating an M-CSF crystal to obtain a diffraction pattern of the M-CSF crystal.
      <br/>
      Finally, a three-dimensional structure of M-CSF is obtained from the diffraction pattern.
      <br/>
      In most embodiments, the three-dimensional structure includes an M-CSF receptor-binding region.
    </p>

      The present invention is also directed to a method for selecting, candidate amino acid substitutions in a protein, based on structural information, and more particularly M-CSF, comprising determining the three-dimensional structure of M-CSF by the methods of the present invention; followed by determining the solvent accessible amino acid residues of the protein, determining which residues are not involved in dimer formation.
      <br/>
      Applying these criteria, amino acids in M-CSF which are solvent accessible and which are not involved in dimer formation are selected for substitution with non-conservative amino acids.
      <br/>
      Since M-CSF BETA  has intrachain disulfide bonds involving cysteines 157 and/or 159, we believe the C-terminal region of M-CSF extends from the "rear" of the structure we have solved, providing a variable-length "tether" for membrane-bound forms of M-CSF.
      <br/>
      Thus, the "front" or receptor-binding region of M-CSF is on the opposite side of the molecules, consisting of solvent-accessible residues in or near helices A, C, and D, including residues from about 6 to 26, 71 to 90, and 110 to 130, respectively, of native M-CSF.
      <br/>
      Preferred amino acids for substitution and preferred substituting amino acids include but are not limited to: H15 --&gt; A or L; Q79 --&gt; A or D; R86 --&gt; E or D; E115 --&gt; A; E41 --&gt; K or R; K93 --&gt; A or E; D99 --&gt; K or R; L55 --&gt; Q or N; S18 --&gt; A or K; Q20 --&gt; A or D; 175 --&gt; K or E; V78 --&gt; K or R; L85 --&gt; E or N; D69 --&gt; K or R; N70 --&gt; A or E: H9 --&gt; A or D; N63 --&gt; K or R; and T34 --&gt; Q or K. Most preferred are those substitutions give rise to novel M-CSF agonists and M-CSF antagonists.
      <br/>
      Additionally, the present invention is also directed to a method for producing antagonists and agonists by substituting at least one and preferably fewer than 5 solvent accessible residues per M-CSF monomer.

    <p num="14">
      The invention is also directed to heterodimeric M-CSF in which only one subunit contains substituted solvent accessible amino acids involved in signal transduction and to heterodimeric M-CSF in which each subunit contains different substituted solvent accessible amino acids involved in signal transduction.

      The present invention is also directed to M-CSF having amino acid substitutions which do not impair binding to the M-CSF receptor.

    <heading>DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS DEFINITIONS</heading>
    <p num="18">
      As used herein "M-CSF polypeptide" refers to a human polypeptide having substantially the same amino acid sequence as the mature human M-CSF ALPHA , M-CSF BETA , or M-CSF GAMMA  polypeptides described in Kawasaki et al., Science 230:291 (1985), Cerretti et al., Molecular Immunology, 25:761 (1988), or Ladner et al., EMBO Journal 6:2693 (1987), each of which are incorporated herein by reference.
      <br/>
      Such terminology reflects the understanding that the three mature M-CSFs have different amino acid sequences, as described above.
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      Certain modifications to the primary sequence of M-CSF can be made by deletion, addition, or alteration of the amino acids encoded by the DNA sequence without destroying the desired structure (e.g., the receptor binding ability of M-CSF) in accordance with well-known recombinant DNA techniques.
      <br/>
      Further, a skilled artisan will appreciate that individual amino acids may be substituted or modified by oxidation, reduction or other derivitization, and the polypeptide may be cleaved to obtain fragments that retain the active binding site and structural information.
      <br/>
      Such substitutions and alterations result in polypeptides having an amino acid sequence which falls within the definition of polypeptide "having substantially the same amino acid sequence as the mature M-CSF ALPHA , M-CSF BETA , and M-CSF GAMMA  polypeptides."
    </p>
    <p num="20">
      For purposes of crystallization, preferred lengths of the M-CSF ALPHA ,  BETA  or  GAMMA  monomers are between about 145 and 180 amino acids (counting from the mature amino terminus), and more preferably between about 145 and 162 amino acids long.
      <br/>
      A specific monomer that may be present in a crystallizable dimer is M-CSF ALPHA  and is N DELTA 3 M-CSF ALPHA  C DELTA 158 (3 amino acids are deleted from the amino terminus and the total length is 155 amino acids).
      <br/>
      All lengths are inclusive.
      <br/>
      As used herein the term "M-CSF ALPHA  (4-158)" denotes an M-CSF having amino acid residues 4 to 158 of the mature, processed M-CSF ALPHA  polypeptide.
      <br/>
      Other nomenclature designations for C-terminal and N-terminal truncations of native M-CSF are set forth in U.S. Pat. No. 4,929,700 which is incorporated herein by reference.
    </p>
    <p num="21">
      Crystallizable glycosylation variants of the M-CSF polypeptides are included within the scope of this invention.
      <br/>
      These variants include polypeptides; completely lacking in glycosylation and variants having at least one fewer glycosylated site than the mature forms, as well as variants in which the glycosylation pattern has been changed from the native forms.
      <br/>
      Also included are deglycosylated and unglycosylated amino acid sequence variants, as well as deglycosylated and unglycosylated M-CSF subunits having the mature amino acid sequence (see, U.S. Pat. No. 5,032,626).
    </p>
    <p num="22">
      "M-CSF" dimer refers to two M-CSF polypeptide monomers that have dimerized. M-CSF dimers may include two identical polypeptide monomers (homodimers) or two different polypeptide monomers (heterodimers such as an M-CSF ALPHA -M-CSF BETA  dimer, an M-CSF long clone and short clone dimer). M-CSF monomers may be converted to M-CSF dimers in vitro as described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,929,700, which is incorporated herein by reference.
      <br/>
      Recombinantly expressed M-CSFs may also be variably glycosylated as they exist in vivo, partially glycosylated, or completely lacking in glycosylation (unglycosylated).
      <br/>
      Glycosylated M-CSFs may be produced in vivo with carbohydrate chains which may later be enzymatically deglycosylated in vitro.
    </p>
    <p num="23">
      Biologically active M-CSF exhibits a spectrum of activity understood in the art.
      <br/>
      For instance, M-CSF stimulates the proliferation and function of mature macrophages via specific receptors on responding cells.
      <br/>
      Further, M-CSF acts as a mononuclear phagocyte progenitor growth factor.
      <br/>
      The standard in vitro colony stimulating assay of Metcalf, J. Cell Physiol. 76:89 (1970) (which is incorporated herein by reference) results primarily in the formation of macrophage colonies when M-CSF is applied to stem cells.
      <br/>
      Other biological assays are based on M-CSF induced proliferation of M-CSF dependent cells such as the NFS-60 cell line.
      <br/>
      As used herein "M-CSF having biological activity" refers to M-CSF, including fragments and sequence variants thereof as described herein; that exhibit an art-recognized spectrum of activity with respect to biological systems.
      <br/>
      Such M-CSF having biological activity will typically have certain structural attributes in common with those of the mature M-CSF forms such as receptor binding site tertiary structure.
    </p>
    <p num="24">
      Agonists are substances that exhibit greater activity per se than the native ligand while antagonists are substances that suppress, inhibit, or interfere with the biological activity of a native ligand.
      <br/>
      Agonists and antagonists may be produced by the methods of the present invention for use in the treatment of diseases in which M-CSF has been implicated either as a potential treatment (e.g., for treating blood cell deficiencies arising as a side effect of chemotherapy treating fungal infection associated with bone marrow transplants and others) or as having a role in the pathogenesis of the disease (e.g., ovarian cancer, uveitis, atherosclerosis).
    </p>
    <p num="25">Crystallization of M-CSF species in accordance with the present invention includes four general steps: expression, purification, crystallization and isolation.</p>
    <p num="26">Expression of Recombinant M-CSF</p>
    <p num="27">
      M-CSF crystallization requires an abundant source of M-CSF that may be isolated in a relatively homogeneous form.
      <br/>
      A variety of expression systems and hosts are suitable for the expression of M-CSF and will be readily apparent to one of skill in the art.
      <br/>
      Because of the variability of glycosylation and other post-transnational modifications present in M-CSF produced in certain eukaryotic hosts, expression in E. coli may provide M-CSF with advantageous properties with regard to crystallization.
      <br/>
      Typical in vitro M-CSF expression systems are described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,929,700, for example.
    </p>
    <p num="28">
      For use in the present invention, a variety of M-CSF polypeptides can also be readily designed and manufactured utilizing recombinant DNA techniques well known to those skilled in the art.
      <br/>
      For example, the M-CSF amino acid sequence can vary from the naturally occurring sequence at the primary structure level by amino acid substitutions, insertions, deletions, and the like.
      <br/>
      These modifications can be used in a number of combinations to produce the final modified polypeptide chain.
      <br/>
      The present invention is useful for crystallizing such polypeptides and dimers thereof.
    </p>
    <p num="29">
      In general, modifications of the genes encoding the M-CSF polypeptide are readily accomplished by a variety of well-known techniques, such as site-directed mutagenesis (see, Gillman and Smith, Gene 8:81-97 (1979) and Roberts, S. et al., Nature 328:731-734 (1987) and U.S. Pat. No. 5,032,676, all of which are incorporated herein by reference).
      <br/>
      Most modifications are evaluated by screening in a suitable assay for the desired characteristic.
      <br/>
      For instance, a change in the M-CSF receptor-binding character of the polypeptide can be detected by competitive assays with an appropriate reference polypeptides or by the bioassays described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,847,201, which is incorporated herein by reference.
    </p>
    <p num="30">
      Insertional variants of the present invention are those in which one or more amino acid residues are introduced into a predetermined site in the M-CSF.
      <br/>
      For instance, insertional variants can be fusions of heterologous proteins or polypeptides to the amino or carboxyl terminus of the subunits.
      <br/>
      Substitutional variants are those in which at least one residue has been removed and a different residue inserted in its place.
      <br/>
      Nonnatural amino acids (i.e., amino acids not normally found in native proteins), as well as isosteric analogs (amino acid or otherwise) are also suitable for use in this invention.
      <br/>
      Examples of suitable substitutions are well known in the art, such as the Glu --&gt; Asp, Ser --&gt; Cys, and Cys --&gt; Ser, His --&gt; alanine for example.
      <br/>
      Another class of variants are deletional variants, which are characterized by the removal of one or more amino acid residues from the M-CSF.
    </p>
    <p num="31">
      Other variants of the present invention may be produced by chemically modifying amino acids of the native protein (e.g., diethylpyrocarbonate treatment which modifies histidine residues).
      <br/>
      Preferred or chemical modifications which are specific for certain amino acid side chains.
      <br/>
      Specificity may also be achieved by blocking other side chains with antibodies directed to the side chains to be protected Chemical modification includes such reactions as oxidation, reduction, amidation, deamidation, or substitution of bulky groups such as polysaccharides or polyethylene glycol (see e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 4,179,337 and WO91/21029 both of which are incorporated herein by reference).
    </p>
    <p num="32">
      Exemplary modifications include the modification of lysinyl and amino terminal residues by reaction with succinic or other carboxylic acid anhydrides.
      <br/>
      Modification with these agents has the effect of reversing the charge of the lysinyl residues.
      <br/>
      Other suitable reagents for modifying amino-containing residues include imidoesters such as methyl picolinimidate; pyridoxal phosphate; pyridoxal chloroborohydride; trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid; O-methylisourea; 2,4-pentanedione; and transaminase-catalyzed reaction with glyoxylate, and N-hydroxysuccinamide esters of polyethylenene glycol or other bully substitutions.
    </p>
    <p num="33">
      Arginyl residues may be modified by reaction with a number of reagents, including phenylglyoxal, 2,3-butanedione, 1,2-cyclohexanedione, and ninhydrin.
      <br/>
      Modification of arginine residues requires that the reaction be performed in alkaline conditions because of the high pKa of the guanidine functional group.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, these reagents may react with the groups of lysine as well as the arginine epsilon-amino group.
    </p>
    <p num="34">
      Tyrosyl residues may also be modified with particular interest in, introducing spectral labels into tyrosyl residues by reaction with aromatic diazonium compounds or tetranitromethane are used to form O-acetyl tyrosyl species and 3-nitro derivatives, respectively.
      <br/>
      Tyrosyl residues may also be iodinated using 125 I or 131 I prepare labeled proteins for use in radioimmunoassay.
    </p>
    <p num="35">
      Carboxyl side groups (aspartyl or glutamyl) may be selectively modified by reaction with carbodiimides (R--N.dbd.C.dbd.N--R1), where R and R1 are different alkyl groups, such as 1-cyclohexyl-3-(2-morpholinyl-4-ethyl) carbodiimide or 1-ethyl-3-(4-azonia-4,4-dimethylpentyl)carbodiimide.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, aspartyl and glutamyl residues are converted to asparaginyl and glutaminyl residues by reaction with ammonium ions.
    </p>
    <p num="36">
      Conversely, glutaminyl and asparaginyl residues may be deamidated to the corresponding glutamyl and aspartyl residues, respectively, under mildly acidic conditions.
      <br/>
      Either form of these residues falls within the scope of this invention.
    </p>
    <p num="37">Other modifications include hydroxylation of proline and lysine, phosphorylation of hydroxyl groups of seryl or threonyl residues, methylation of the  ALPHA -amino groups of lysine, arginine, and histidine side chains (T. E. Creighton, Proteins: Structure and Molecular Properties, W. H. Freeman &amp; Co., San Francisco, pp. 79-86 �1983�), acetylation of the N-terminal amine, and amidation of any C-terminal carboxyl group.</p>
    <p num="38">
      The availability of a DNA sequence encoding M-CSF permits the use of various expression systems to produce the desired polypeptides.
      <br/>
      Construction of expression vectors and recombinant production from the appropriate DNA sequences are performed by methods well known in the art.
      <br/>
      These techniques and various other techniques are generally performed according to Sambrook et al., Molecular Cloning--A Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y. (1989), and Kriegler, M., Gene Transfer and Expression, A Laboratory Manual, Stockton Press, New York (1990), both of which are incorporated herein by reference.
    </p>
    <p num="39">Purification of M-CSF</p>
    <p num="40">
      Purification steps are employed to ensure that the M-CSF is isolated, prior to crystallization, in a relatively homogeneous state.
      <br/>
      In general, a higher purity solution increases the likelihood of success of subsequent crystallization steps.
      <br/>
      Typical purification methods include the use of centrifugation, partial fractionation using salt or organic compounds, dialysis, conventional column chromatography (such as ion-exchange, molecular sizing chromatography etc.), high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), and gel electrophoresis methods (see, e.g., Deutcher. "Guide to Protein Purification" in Methods in Enzymology (1990), Academic Press, Berkely, Calif., which is incorporated herein by reference for all purposes).
      <br/>
      Preferred purification conditions for generating unusually homogeneous M-CSF species as well as purification of these species are disclosed, for example, in U.S. Pat. No. 4,929,700 which is incorporated herein by reference.
      <br/>
      Other purification methods are known and will be apparent to one of skill in the art.
    </p>
    <p num="41">Crystallization of M-CSF</p>
    <p num="42">
      Although many of the same physical principles govern crystallization of polypeptides (including M-CSF dimers) and small molecules, the actual crystallization mechanisms differ significantly.
      <br/>
      For example, the lattice of small-molecule crystals effectively excludes solvent while that of polypeptide crystals includes substantial numbers of solvent molecules.
      <br/>
      Thus, special techniques must typically be applied to crystallize polypeptides.
    </p>
    <p num="43">
      Polypeptide crystallization occurs in solutions where the polypeptide concentration exceeds its solubility maximum (i.e., the polypeptide solution is supersaturated).
      <br/>
      Such "thermodynamically metastable" solutions may be restored to equilibrium by reducing the polypeptide concentration, preferably through precipitation of the polypeptide crystals.
      <br/>
      Often polypeptides may be induced to crystallize from supersaturated solutions by adding agents that alter the polypeptide surface charges or perturb the interactions between the polypeptide and bulk water to promote associations that lead to crystallization.
    </p>
    <p num="44">
      Compounds known as "precipitants" are often used to decrease the solubility of the polypeptide in a concentrated solution.
      <br/>
      Precipitants induce crystallization by forming an energetically unfavorable precipitant depleted layer around the polypeptide molecules.
      <br/>
      To minimize the relative amount of this depletion layer, the polypeptides form associations and ultimately crystals as explained in Weber, Advances in Protein Chemistry 41:1-36 (1991) which was previously incorporated by reference, In addition to precipitants, other materials are sometimes added to the polypeptide crystallization solution.
      <br/>
      These include buffers to adjust the pH of the solution (and hence surface charge on the peptide) and salts to reduce the solubility of the polypeptide.
      <br/>
      Various precipitants are known in the art and include the following: ethanol, 3-ethyl-2,4-pentanediol; and many of the polyglycols, such as polyethylene glycol.
      <br/>
      A suitable precipitant for crystallizing M-CSF is polyethylene glycol (PEG), which combines some of the characteristics of the salts and other organic precipitants (see, for example, Ward et al., J. Mol. Biol. 98:161 �1975� which is incorporated herein by reference for all purposes and McPherson J. Biol. Chem. 251:6300 �1976�, which was previously incorporated by reference).
    </p>
    <p num="45">
      Commonly used polypeptide crystallization methods include the following techniques: batch, hanging drop, seed initiation, and dialysis.
      <br/>
      In each of these methods, it is important to promote continued crystallization after nucleation by maintaining a supersaturated solution.
      <br/>
      In the batch method, polypeptide is mixed with precipitants to achieve supersaturation, the vessel is sealed and set aside until crystals appear.
      <br/>
      In the dialysis method, polypeptide is retained in a sealed dialysis membrane which is placed into a solution containing precipitant.
      <br/>
      Equilibration across the membrane increases the polypeptide and precipitant concentrations thereby causing the polypeptide to reach supersaturation levels.
    </p>
    <p num="46">
      In the hanging drop technique, an initial polypeptide mixture is created by adding a precipitant to concentrated polypeptide solution.
      <br/>
      The concentrations of the polypeptide and precipitants are such that in this initial form, the polypeptide does not crystallize.
      <br/>
      A small drop of this mixture is placed on a glass slide which is inverted and suspended over a reservoir of a second solution.
      <br/>
      The system is then sealed.
      <br/>
      Typically the second solution contains a higher concentration of precipitant or other dehydrating agent.
      <br/>
      The difference in the precipitant concentrations causes the protein solution to have a higher vapor pressure than the solution.
      <br/>
      Since the system containing the two solutions is sealed, an equilibrium is established, and water from the polypeptide mixture transfers to the second solution.
      <br/>
      This equilibration increases the polypeptide and precipitant concentration in the polypeptide solution.
      <br/>
      At the critical concentration of polypeptide and precipitant, a crystal of the polypeptide will form.
      <br/>
      The hanging drop method is well known in the art (see, McPherson J. Biol. Chem. 251:6300 �1976�, which was previously incorporated herein by reference).
    </p>
    <p num="47">
      Another method of crystallization introduces a nucleation site into a concentrated polypeptide solution.
      <br/>
      Generally, a concentrated polypeptide solution is prepared and a seed crystal of the polypeptide is introduced into this solution.
      <br/>
      If the concentrations of the polypeptide and any precipitants are correct, the seed crystal will provide a nucleation site around which a larger crystal forms.
    </p>
    <p num="48">
      In preferred embodiments, the crystals of the present invention will be formed from a dimer of M-CSF polypeptides.
      <br/>
      Preferred crystals are typically at least about 0.2 * 0.2 * 0.05 mm, more preferably larger than 0.4 * 0.4 * 0.4 mm, and most preferably larger than 0.5 * 0.5 * 0.5 mm. After crystallization, the protein may be separated from the crystallization mixture by standard techniques.
    </p>
    <p num="49">
      The crystals so produced have a wide range of uses.
      <br/>
      For example, high quality crystals are suitable for X-ray or neutron diffraction analysis to determine the three-dimensional structure of the M-CSF and, in particular, to assist in the identification of its receptor binding site.
      <br/>
      Knowledge of the binding site region and solvent-accessible residues available for contact with the M-CSF receptor allows rational design and construction of agonists and antagonist for M-CSFs.
      <br/>
      Crystallization and structural determination of M-CSF muteins having altered receptor binding ability or bioactivity allows the evaluation of whether such changes are caused by general structural deformation or by side chain alteration at the substitution site:.
    </p>
    <p num="50">
      In addition, crystallization itself can be used as purification method.
      <br/>
      In some instances, a polypeptide or protein will crystallize from a heterogeneous mixture into crystals.
      <br/>
      Isolation of such crystals by filtration, centrifugation, etc. followed by redissolving the polypeptide affords a purified solution suitable for use in growing the high-quality crystals necessary for diffraction studies.
      <br/>
      These high-quality crystals may also be dissolved in water and then formulated to provide an aqueous M-CSF solution having various uses known in the art including pharmaceutical purposes.
    </p>
    <p num="51">
      Of course, amino acid sequence variants of M-CSF may also be crystallized and used.
      <br/>
      These mutants can be used for, among other purposes, obtaining structural information useful for directing modification of the binding affinity for M-CSF receptors.
      <br/>
      As with the naturally occurring forms, the modified M-CSF forms may be useful as pharmaceutical agents for stimulating bone marrow proliferation, overcoming immune suppression and fungal diseases induced by chemotherapy, improving therapeutic efficacy, and lessening the severity or occurrence of side effects during therapeutic use of the present invention.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, modified M-CSFs may be useful for treatment of disease in which soluble or membrane-bound M-CSF causes or exacerbates the disease state.

      After purification, crystallization and isolation, the subject crystals may be analyzed by techniques known in the art.
      <br/>
      Typical analysis yield structural, physical, and mechanistic information about the peptides.
      <br/>
      As discussed above, X-ray crystallography provides detailed structural information which may be used in conjunction with widely available molecular modeling programs to arrive at the three-dimensional arrangement of atoms in the peptide.
      <br/>
      Exemplary modeling programs include "Homology" by Biosym (San Diego, Calif.), "Biograf" by BioDesign, "Nemesis" by Oxford Molecular, "SYBYL" and "Composer" by Tripos Associates, "CHARM" by Polygen (Waltham, Mass.), "AMBER" by University of California, San Francisco, and "MM2" and "MMP2" by Molecular Design, Ltd.

      Peptide modeling can be used to design a variety of agents capable of modifying the activity of the subject peptide.
      <br/>
      For example, using the three-dimensional structure of the active site, agonists and antagonists having complementary structures can be designed to enhance the therapeutic utility of M-CSF treatment or to block the biological activity of M-CSF.
      <br/>
      Further, M-CSF structural information is useful for directing design of proteinaceous or non-proteinaceous M-CSF agonists and antagonists, based on knowledge of the contact residues between the M-CSF ligand and its receptor.
      <br/>
      Such residues are identified by the M-CSF crystal structure as those which are solvent-accessible, distal to the carboxyl terminal membrane anchoring region not involved in dimer interface stabilizations, and possibly including residues not conserved between human and mouse M-CSF (which does not recognize the human M-CSF receptor).

    <p num="74">Testing of M-CSF Receptor Binding Ability Using Soluble M-CSF Receptor</p>
    <p num="75">
      An essential step in the biological function of M-CSF in vivo is the binding to the M-CSF receptor, also referred to as the c-fms gene product.
      <br/>
      Recombinant human soluble M-CSF receptor (rhsM-CSFR), representing amino acids; 20 to 511 SEQ ID NO:11 (Coussens, L et al., Nature, 320:277 (1986)) was used as an in vitro assay reagent to test the receptor-binding ability of M-CSF proteins.
      <br/>
      To generate a soluble form of the transmembrane receptor, only the extracellular domain of the human M-CSF receptor was expressed in a baculovirus/insect cell recombinant expression system.
      <br/>
      In order to purify the soluble receptor without adversely effecting tertiary or quaternary structure, non-denaturing chromatographic methods were chosen, as described below.
      <br/>
      Other choices exist for the purification of the recombinant receptor.
      <br/>
      Affinity chromatography may be employed when either a suitable antibody to or ligand for the receptor are available.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, "tags" may be added to the C-terminus of the recombinant receptor, i.e., KT3 antibody recognition sequence, and purified by an anti-tag antibody, i.e., KT3, column, for use in affinity chromatography.
      <br/>
      In expression systems in which the rhsM-CSFR is glycosylated, lectin chromatography can be used to enrich for specific glycoproteins.
    </p>
    <p num="76">
      The rhsM-CSFR can be used to study ligand/receptor interactions as well as ligand-induced receptor dimerization.
      <br/>
      The assay used to detect ligand/receptor binding employed the use of size exclusion-HPLC, essentially as described in European Patent Application WO92/21029, C. Cunningham, et al., with the following modifications: the column used was a Superose 6 (Pharmacia LKB Biotechnology, Inc.) and the mobile phase was PBS at 0.5 ml/min and a M-CSF to rhsM-CSFR ratio of 1:2.
      <br/>
      At this ratio, the M-CSF/rhsM-CSFR complex chromatographed with an apparent hydrodynamic radius of 190,000 molecular weight, the molecular weight expected for a M-CSF(rhsM-CSFR)2 complex.
      <br/>
      Other assays may be employed to measure ligand/receptor binding or receptor dimerization such as chemical crosslinking and SDS-PAGE or immunoprecipitation and SDS-PAGE.
      <br/>
      Molecules that inhibit receptor dimerization but not ligand binding provide another method to antagonize M-CSF actions.

      After solvent flattening, B. C. Wang, Methods Enzymol, 115:90 (1985), two bundles of four alpha helices related by an approximate two-fold axis could be seen in the electron density map.
      <br/>
      Rotation and translation parameters of this non-crystallographic axis were refined by a density correlation method, J. M. Cox, J. Mol. Biol. 28:151 (1967).
      <br/>
      Phases were then iteratively refined by molecular averaging and solvent flattening, G. Bricogne, Acta Cryst., 32:832 (1976), using an envelope calculated by putting 5  Angstrom  spheres around all the atoms in the four helical bundle.
      <br/>
      Chain racing and model building were done in the resulting map, (using the program FRODO), T. A. Jones, Methods Enzymol. 115:157 (1985), keeping the original MIR map as a reference.
    </p>
    <p num="86">
      The starting partial model for refinement contained only a polyalanine backbone for eight helices making up the two bundles.
      <br/>
      Positional refinement using the program XPLOR, A. T. Brunger, J. Mol. Biol. 203:803 (1985), gave an R-factor of 0.49 to 3.0  Angstrom .
      <br/>
      Phase combination with the refined MIR phases resulted in a map of sufficient quality to allow the tracing of two long loops traversing the four helical bundle and a short loop connecting two of the helices.
      <br/>
      Two strong peaks in the density, one at the top of the first helix, and the second lying directly on the molecular two fold axis, were assigned as disulfide bonded cysteines.
      <br/>
      The number of residues between these two peaks uniquely identified the position in the sequence of these cysteines and consequently the sequence of the intervening residues.
      <br/>
      This initial registration was confirmed by the presence of a number of regions of strong density corresponding to aromatic side chains in the sequence.
      <br/>
      Partial model phase combination using the added loops and those side chains that were visible allowed the remaining residues to be registered, thus determining the overall topology of the molecule.
      <br/>
      The presence of seven disulfide bonds in the dimer served as important "tether points" to confirm the correctness of the tracing.
    </p>
    <p num="87">
      As shown in FIG. 2, the overall topology of this form of M-CSF is that of an antiparallel four  ALPHA -helical bundle, in which the helices run up-up-down-down, unlike the more commonly observed up-down-up-down connectivity of most four helical bundles.
      <br/>
      A long crossover connection links helix A to helix B and a similar connection is found between helices C and D.
    </p>
    <p num="88">
      A striking difference from other cytokines and other four helix bundle structures is that the truncated M-CSF ALPHA  forms a disulfide-linked dimer, in which the bundles are linked end-to-end, forming an extremely flat, elongated structure (approximate dimensions 85 * 35 * 25  Angstrom ) as shown in FIGS. 3 and 4A and 4B.
      <br/>
      There are three intramolecular disulfide bonds in each monomer (Cys7-Cys90, Cys8-Cys139, Cys102-Cys146) all of which are at the distal end of the molecule.
      <br/>
      One interchain disulfide bond (Cys31--Cys31) is located at the dimer interface with the noncrystallographic two-fold symmetry axis passing through it as shown in FIGS. 3 and 4.
      <br/>
      Mutation experiments indicate that all of the cysteine residues in this form of M-CSF may be necessary for full biological activity.

      Specific residues in helices A, C, and D appear to be involved in the specificity of the interaction.
      <br/>
      Altering solvent accessible residues in these regions by site directed mutagenesis to increase or decrease side-chain interactions with the receptor may be useful to generate M-CSF agonists or antagonists.
      <br/>
      For example, changing one or more histidines to non-hydrogen-donor amino acids of similar size may create an M-CSF with altered receptor binding ability.

      After incubation at 37 (degree)  C. for 30 min., the solubilized M-CSF was clarified by centrifugation and filtration, and then loaded onto a Bio-Gel TSK-DEAE-5-PW column (7.5 * 75 mm) (BioRad Laboratories, Richmond, Calif.) equilibrated in 8 M urea in 10 mM Tris (pH 8.5), 5 mM DTT, 0.5 mM EDTA. The monomeric M-CSF was eluted with a 45-min, 0-0.6 M NaCl gradient.

The heterodimer was refolded by diluting 158 and 221F monomer pools to 1 mg/ml in the same buffer.
      <br/>
      To monitor the refolding, size exclusion high pressure liquid chromatography (SE-HPLC) analysis was performed by immediately injecting reaction samples onto a G3000SW Ultropack (Pharmacia LKB Biotechnology, Inc., Piscataway, N.J.) column size-exclusion (7.5 * 600 mm) equilibrated in PBS (pH 6.8).

      Biological activity was determined using the M-CSF dependent NFS-60 bioassay (See Example 10 below).

      Antibody neutralization experiments were carried out by pre-incubating approximately 5,000 units of M-CSF dimer with varying dilutions of the neutralizing M-CSF 5H410 Mab (made to refolded E. coli C DELTA 150 M-CSF ALPHA  dimer) prior to bioassay. (Halenbeck et al, Bio/Technology 7:710 (1989)

      The heterodimeric M-CSF product was designed to consist of one chain of short clone (from amino acid 4 to 158) and one chain of long clone (from amino acid 4 to 221).
      <br/>
      The long-clone chain (221F) also contained substitutions of serine for the two non-essential cysteines (at 157 and 159) to minimize the possibility of higher-order oligomer formation.

      Only one major protein peak eluted in each case, and the peak fractions were pooled, based on an analysis of purity by non-reducing SDS-PAGE and Coomassie staining (data not shown).
      <br/>
      The resulting monomer was over 90% pure in each case.

      To compare the rates of dimerization of shorn- and long-clone M-CSF, 20  MU l of each refolding reaction was injected on a SE-HPLC column at 0, 2. 18 and 72 hr.
      <br/>
      The amount of dimeric M-CSF formed was determined from the peak area at the molecular weight expected for dimer.
      <br/>
      In both refolding reactions the M-CSF was mostly equilibrated to monomer at t=0 and had become about 40% dimeric by 2 hr and nearly 75% dimeric by 18 hr.
      <br/>
      The similarity of the ratio of dimer to monomer between the refolded 158 and 221F strongly suggests that the rate of dimer formation is the same for long- and short-clone M-CSF.
      <br/>
      Thus, when equal moles of 158 and 221F are present in a refolding reaction, the final relative ratios of 158 homodimer to 221F homodimer to 158/221F heterodimer are predicted to be 1:1:2 (Similar distributions have been observed in vivo for isozymes of lactate dehydrogenase.)

      The biological activity of the refolded homodimers and heterodimers described above, was examined using the in vitro M-CSF-dependent NFS-60 bioassay (See Example 10 below).
      <br/>
      FIGS. 5A-5C show the result of these studies.
      <br/>
      These SE-HPLC and biological activity profiles analyzed after 72 hr of refolding, show that the heterodimer, FIG. 5C, displays activity very similar to that of the two homodimers, (FIGS. 5A and 5B).
      <br/>
      Given that the separation of the heterodimer from the homodimers was nearly complete, it can be concluded that the heterodimer is fully biologically active in vitro.
    </p>
    <p num="103">
      To verify that the M-CSF protein eluting from these columns at the predicted heterodimeric position (between the two homodimers) actually did consist of equal moles of short- and long-clone monomers, analysis of a preparative purification of the 158/221F heterodimer was carried out.
      <br/>
      Phenyl-HPLC was performed as described above and was shown to completely resolve the heterodimer from the 158 and 221F homodimers, as seen in FIG. 6A.

      <br/>
      The gel analysis also showed that the heterodimer was purified to approximately 95% homogeneity and that it consisted of equivalent amounts of 158 and 221F monomers.
      <br/>
      Recovery of purified 158/221F heterodimer from refractile body paste to final product, was greater than 15%.

      The specific activity of the 158/221F heterodimer, calculated using the peak fraction, was 8.0 * 107 units/mg, compared to 9.0 * 107 and 6.8 * 107 units/mg for 158 and 221F homodimers, respectively.

      This antibody also neutralizes "naturally refolded" Chinese hamster ovary cell (CHO)-expressed M-CSF in a similar fashion.
      <br/>
      This result further suggests that the refolded conformation of the new M-CSF heterodimer is essentially native-like, at least with regard to the region within the first 150 amino acids that is responsible for in vitro activity.

    <p num="110">Selection of Amino Acid Substitutions in M-CSF Based on Crystallographic Data</p>
    <p num="111">
      The X-ray crystallographic data described above provided sufficient structural information regarding M-CSF to be able to identify a limited subset of the amino acids in the protein that are likely to be crucial for M-CSF receptor binding and biological activity and thus which represented likely candidates for mutagenesis with the ultimate goal of providing M-CSF muteins having altered biological activity (i.e., agonists or antagonists).
      <br/>
      Based on this information, several criteria were used to generate a list of possible target amino acids for substitution.
    </p>
    <p num="112">
      The first criterion was solvent exposure or solvent accessibility, which refers to amino acids residues at the surface of the protein.
      <br/>
      Residues having a solvent accessible surface area of greater than about 0.25 and preferably greater than about 0.4 are preferred based on normalization of the surface area of the amino acid accessible when in the trypeptide gly-x-gly (Kabsch, W. et al., Biopolymers 22:2577 (1983)).
      <br/>
      Residues were chosen which do not interact with other parts of the protein such as the dimer interface in order to maintain the relative orientation of monomers and to avoid disturbing the process of protein folding.
      <br/>
      Still another criterion used in certain instances in selecting candidate amino acid substitutions is the relationship of the residues to corresponding residues in mouse M-CSF.
      <br/>
      Another important selection criterion was that the substitutions be non-conservative so as to attempt to disrupt possible hydrogen bonding or hydrophobic interactions with M-CSF receptor residues.
    </p>
    <p num="113">
      Table 1 lists exemplary amino acid residues and exemplary substitutions.

      It is not expected that every candidate substitution listed will result in the production of M-CSF agonists or antagonists (see Example 12 below).

      The N-terminal sequence of the purified mutein was determined through 20 cycles, using a standard automated Edman degradation method, and shown to be identical to that of the parental N DELTA 3C DELTA 158 M-CSF ALPHA  reference protein except that His 9 and His 15 had been altered to Ala.

      The purified mutein dimers were subjected to bioassay using NFS-60 cells which is an M-CSF dependent cell line which forms colonies in the presence of active M-CSF.
      <br/>
      Standards and purified mutein samples were serially diluted 1:2 in RPMI media (10% fetal bovine serum) in a 50 microliter volume in 96-well microtiter plates. 50 microliters NFS-60 cells (ATCC NO. CRL 1838), maintained in 4000 U/ml M-CSF, washed 2 * , and diluted to a concentration of 1 * 105 cell/ml, were added to each sample well.
      <br/>
      Plates were incubated at 37 (degree)  C., 5% CO2 for 44 h. 5 mg/ml MTT dye was added to each sample and incubation continued for 4h. 20% SDS was added to each sample.
      <br/>
      The plates were wrapped in foil and left overnight.
      <br/>
      The absorbance of each sample was read at 570 nm and compared to a standard of known M-CSF concentration.
      <br/>
      The H9A, H15A mutein showed a specific activity of 7.6 * 103 U/mg compared to 6.9 * 107 U/mg for the parental M-CSF N DELTA 3C DELTA 158 reference in the same assay.
      <br/>
      This represents a nearly 10,000 fold reduction in biological activity for the mutein.
      <br/>
      The same M-CSF mutein preparation was shown to have greatly decreased M-CSF receptor-binding ability using the NFS-60 receptor competition assay described in this example.
      <br/>
      Because the H9A, H15A M-CSF mutein was otherwise not significantly different from the parental M-CSF ALPHA , including crystallizability and space group (see Example 12) we believe the decrease in, biological activity is not due to gross deformation of structure but reflects an alteration in important M-CSF receptor contacts.
    </p>
    <p num="136">
      Using essentially the same methodology, two M-CSF muteins contacting singly substituted histidines at residues 9 and 15 were generated (e.g. H9AL and H15A).
      <br/>
      The H9A construct utilized LF80:

    </p>
    <p num="137">
      and LF73 (described in this example) as the PCR primers.
      <br/>
      The H15A construct utilized LP81:
      <br/>
      5'-CAGGAGAAAGCTTATGTCTGAATATTGTAGCCACATGATTGGGAGTGGAGCCCTGCAG-3'  (SEQ ID NO. 4);
    </p>
    <p num="138">
      and LF 73 (described in this example) as PCR primers.
      <br/>
      Biological assay of the purified muteins immediately following the refolding step described above showed approximate biological specific activities as follows: 4 * 106 U/mg for H9A and less than 3 * 103 U/mg for H15A, in an assay which the parental ML-CSF construct displayed 8 * 107 U/mg.
      <br/>
      This information, combined with that described above, suggests that H15A as well as possible H9A represents contacts that are important for M-CSF receptor binding.
      <br/>
      Nearby solvent accessible residues such as Y6 and S13 (see also Table 1) may also represent M-CSF receptor contact residues.
      <br/>
      Non-proteinaceous mimics of the side chains of H9, H15, and nearby solvent accessible side chains may represent M-CSF agonists or antagonists.
      <br/>
      Such residues should be left unchanged in M-CSF mutein constructs designed to retain full M-CSF receptor binding but to have M-CSF antagonist properties because they lack significant M-CSF bioactivity.
      <br/>
      Homodimers of muteins that retain full receptor-binding ability and display significantly reduced bioactivity should represent M-CSF antagonists. M-CSF muteins that are greatly decreased in both M-CSF bioactivity and receptor binding ability (such as H15A) may generally be useful in M-CSF immunoassay applications and might represent useful therapeutic agents for patients having auto-antibodies to M-CSF.

      Both of these constructs changed side chain properties of solvent-accessible amino) acids in the areas of interest but did not affect biological specific activity, compared to the parental reference molecule.
      <br/>
      These results indicate that residues Q17, R21, E115, and N119 do not need to be altered in muteins designed to have M-CSF agonist or antagonist activity.
      <br/>
      In fact, to minimize the likelihood of antibody formation to potentially administered M-CSF-based proteinaceous drugs, it is desirable to retain the solvent-accessible parental M-CSF residues (to resemble the native molecule) whenever possible.
    </p>
    <p num="152">
      The retained activity of the muteins including changes at Q17, R21, E115, and N119 does not rule out large affects on activity contributed by nearby residues (such as H15).
      <br/>
      In fact, the regions we have altered are predicted by the crystal structure to be important for receptor binding and/or signaling.
      <br/>
      Antagonistic M-CSF muteins may require use of multiple residue changes per mutein or use of heterodimeric molecules containing one or more mutations in each polypeptide chain, since M-CSF residues important in receptor signaling are believed to be composed of discontinuous regions of M-CSF.
    </p>
    <p num="153">EXAMPLE 12</p>
    <p num="154">Formation of M-CSF Heterodimers Having Decreased Receptor-Binding Ability and/or Decreased Biological Specific Activity</p>
    <p num="155">
      M-CSF can be folded in vitro to generate fully active heterodimers, as shown in Example 8.
      <br/>
      By making heterodimers of M-CSF which incorporate M-CSF muteins with altered M-CSF signaling ability, it should be possible to generate antagonists of M-CSF useful for treatment of patients with M-CSF mediated diseases.
      <br/>
      To generate a heterodimer containing one subunit of M-CSF ALPHA  N DELTA 3C DELTA 158 H9A, H15A and one subunit of M-CSF BETA  N DELTA 3C DELTA 221 C157S, C159S, each mutein was expressed in E. coli and purified separately by DEAE Sepharose under denaturing and reducing conditions as described in Example 8.
      <br/>
      The two muteins subunits were mixed together prior to refolding to generate a solution containing a final mutein molar ratio of 1:1, then this solution was diluted to 0.2 mg/ml with refolding buffer as described in Example 8.
      <br/>
      Following refolding, the heterodimeric molecule was separated from the homodimers by two consecutive passes over a Phenyl TSK-5-PW HPLC column as described in Example 8.
      <br/>
      No contaminants were detected when the purified heterodimer preparation was examined by non-reduced SDS-PAGE or size exclusion HPLC using a BioSil SEC250 column (BioRad).
    </p>
    <p num="156">
      The purified heterodimer was submitted to the NFS60 cell based bioassay described in Example 8.
      <br/>
      The calculated specific activity was 2.9 * 106 U/mg which correlated to a 35-fold reduction as compared to the activity of the parental M-CSF heterodimer described in Example 10.
      <br/>
      The relative binding affinity to cell surface M-CSF receptor was measured by radioligand displacement in which the displacement of 125 I-M-CSF from an M-CSF receptor by an M-CSF mutein was measured using methods well known in the art.
      <br/>
      In brief, the following were added in a final volume of 100  MU l in each well of a 96-well cell culture plate: approximately 80,000 cpm of purified recombinant human M-CSF labeled with 125 I (using Iodobeads as described by the manufacturer, Pierce, Rockford, Ill.), 300,000 NFS-60 cells that had been washed and then grown for 18 hours in growth medium minus the normal maintenance level of M-CSF, plus unlabeled M-CSF that had been serially diluted in the same medium.
      <br/>
      The plates were incubated at 4 (degree)  C. for 20 hours and the cells were collected on glass-fiber filters.
      <br/>
      Maximum binding was measured in the absence of unlabeled M-CSF and non-specific binding was measured in the presence of 1000-fold greater concentration of unlabeled M-CSF (compared to labeled M-CSF).
      <br/>
      The concentration of M-CSF required to inhibit 50% of the labeled M-CSF binding to the cells (IC50) was used to determine differences in affinity.
      <br/>
      Results are expressed as percent displacement of radioactive M-CSF versus mutein concentration (FIG. 7).
      <br/>
      The IC50 of the heterodimer (FIG. 7 closed squares) was reduced 30-fold to about 500 pM as compared to an IC50 of about 17 pM for M-CSF ALPHA  N DELTA 3C DELTA 158 (158) (FIG. 7 closed circles).
      <br/>
      The similarity between the reduction in specific activity and receptor affinity of the heterodimer indicates that the reduction in bioactivity was due to decreased receptor-binding ability.
      <br/>
      Similarly, the binding affinities of the Q20A, V78KF (FIG. 7 open circles) and -H9A, H15A (open squares) muteins were also measured in this radioligand displacement assay.
      <br/>
      The Q20A, V78K mutein had an IC50 of about 100 pM and the -H9A, H15A mutein has an IC50 of about 1  MU M, correlating to decreased binding affinities of 5-fold and 50,000-fold, respectively.
      <br/>
      For each mutein, the reduction in receptor affinity was similar to the reduction in specific activity, again indicating that the reduction in bioactivity was due to reduced receptor-binding ability.
    </p>
    <p num="157">EXAMPLE 13</p>
    <p num="158">Crystallization and Characterization Of M-CSF H9A, H15A Muteins</p>
    <p num="159">
      The H9A, H15A mutein described in Example 10 was crystallized using the hanging drop method described in Examples 1 and 2 using the following buffer conditions: 30% polyethylene glycol 4000; 100 mM Li2 SO4 ; and 100 mM Tris pH 8.5. The crystals produced under these conditions were rhombohedral prisms having dimensions of 0.7 mm * 0.2 mm * 0.2 mm. X-ray crystallographic analysis using precession photographs showed crystals in the P21 21 21 space group with cell dimensions of a=33.99, b=65.37, c=159.90, d=90, e=90, and f=90 angstroms and diffract to a nominal resolution of 3 angstroms.
      <br/>
      These physical properties are essentially the same as those observed for the parental N DELTA 3C DELTA 158 M-CSF ALPHA  molecule and suggests that the biological effects of the H9A, H15A alterations are not the consequence of gross global alterations in M-CSF structure, but rather are the result of altered side chains that are important in interacting with the M-CSF receptor.
      <br/>
      Alteration of those histidine side chains may have affected receptor binding by changing atoms that interact with, stabilize or facilitate receptor binding or changes in receptor conformation.
      <br/>
      Changes such as H15A may also have affected these functions by altering the position of the nearby side chain in M-CSF, most likely in the A and/or C helix regions.
