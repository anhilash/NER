    <p num="1">This application claims the benefits of provisional application Serial No. 60/097,390 filed on Aug. 21, 1998.</p>
    <heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">
      This invention pertains to a controlled-release dosage form.
      <br/>
      More particularly, the invention relates to a dosage form comprising a wall encapsulating a space for holding and storing a capsule.
      <br/>
      The invention concerns also (1) a process for providing a controlled-release dosage form comprising a wall that defines a space for housing an internal capsule, and (2) a process for converting a non-controlled drug releasing capsule into a controlled-release dosage form.
    </p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="3">
      Capsules are dosage form in which a composition comprising a drug is enclosed within a wall.
      <br/>
      Capsules are a popular method for administering a drug in both prescription practice and in over-the-counter practice.
      <br/>
      Capsules are used widely in hospitals, nursing homes, retirement centers, homes, and in other environments, such as the military and naval environments.
      <br/>
      Capsules enjoy this popularity because they are tasteless, essentially innocuous, easily administered, easily filled extemporaneously, and they can be manufactured in large numbers.
      <br/>
      Additionally, some capsule users find it easier to swallow capsules than other dosage forms, such as a solid tablet.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      While the above advantages and patient preference contribute to the continuing acceptance of capsules, there are certain shortcomings associated with capsules.
      <br/>
      For example, after oral administration, capsules give up all their useful drug immediately.
      <br/>
      That is, capsules are dose-dumping dosage forms.
      <br/>
      The therapeutic consequence of this dose-dumping is non-controlled therapy consisting of an initially high dose of drug, followed by a total absence of drug between later administered capsules.
      <br/>
      For many drugs, this form of administration can have undesirable therapeutic effects, especially if the drug has a low therapeutic index and is not suited to time-varying rates of administration.
      <br/>
      Another shortcoming associated with capsules is they are poorly suited for administering drugs with short biological half-lives, and this results in exclusion of large drugs including mammalian biochemicals, natural hormones, humoral factors, and the like.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      Yet another shortcoming associated with capsules is their instant delivery and its accompanying detrimental effects.
      <br/>
      Because of this inherency, capsules require a high frequency of use, and this can lead to a failure of patient compliance for a prescribed dosage schedule.
      <br/>
      Such failures are reflected in a lack of therapeutic effectiveness, and in possible toxic effects.
      <br/>
      The latter effects can occur when patients double or triple their dosage to compensate for their prior omissions.
      <br/>

      <br/>
      The membrane forming composition can comprise optional membrane-forming ingredients such as polyethylene glycol, talcum, polyvinylalcohol, lactose, or polyvinyl pyrrolidone.
      <br/>
      The compositions for forming an injection-molding polymer composition can comprise 100% thermoplastic polymer.
      <br/>
      The composition in another embodiment comprises 10% to 99% of a thermoplastic polymer and 1 % to 70% of a different polymer with the total equal to 100%.
      <br/>
      The invention provides also a thermoplastic polymer composition comprising 1% to 98% of a first thermoplastic polymer, 1% to 90% of a different, second polymer and 1% to 90% of a different, third polymer with all polymers equal to 100%.

    </p>
    <p num="24">
      Dosage form 10, as seen in drawing FIG. 2, comprises in internal space 14 and a capsule 16.
      <br/>
      Capsule 16 is composed of two parts, a cap 17 and a receiving body 18, which are fitted together after the larger body 18 is filled with a preselected appropriate drug formulation.
      <br/>
      This is done by slipping or telescoping the cap section 17 over the body section 18, thus completely surrounding the therapeutic agent formulation.
      <br/>
      Two-piece capsules are made by dipping stainless steel molds into a bath containing a solution of a capsule lamina-forming material to coat the mold with the material.
      <br/>
      Then, the molds are withdrawn, cooled, and dried in a current of room temperature air 22.50 (degree)  C. The capsule is stripped from the mold and trimmed to yield a lamina with an internal member.
      <br/>
      The engaging cap 17 that telescopically caps the drug formulation receiving body member 18 is made in a similar manner.
      <br/>
      Then, the closed and filled capsule is placed inside dosage form 10 in internal space.
      <br/>
      In another embodiment, the capsule 16 can be made with each part 17 and 18 having matched locking rings near their opened ends that permit joining and locking together the overlapping cap 17 and receiving body 18, after filling 18 with a drug formulation.
      <br/>
      In this embodiment, a pair of matched locking rings are formed into cap portion 17 and body portion 18, and these rings provide the locking means for securely holding together the capsule.
      <br/>
      The capsule can be filled manually with a drug formulation, or capsule 16 can be machine-filled with the drug formulation.
      <br/>
      The word "capsule" as used herein denotes its art-accepted meaning of a wall, lamina, or a membrane enclosing a drug formulation.
    </p>
    <p num="25">
      Dosage form 10 houses an expandable composition 19 distant from mouth 15 and initially separate and in contact with end 20 of capsule 16.
      <br/>
      Composition 19 is a driving force that acts in cooperation with dosage form 10 and capsule 16 for delivering a drug formulation from dosage form 10.
      <br/>
      Composition 19 exhibits fluid absorbing and/or fluid imbibing properties.
      <br/>
      Composition 19 comprises a hydrophilic polymer that can interact with water and aqueous biological fluids imbibed into dosage form 10 and then swell or expand.
      <br/>
      The hydrophilic polymers 21 are known also as osmopolymers, hydrogels and osmogels as they exhibit a concentration gradient across wall 12, and thereby absorb or imbibe fluid into dosage form 10.
      <br/>
      Representative of osmopolymers 21 are poly(ethylene oxide) having a 750,000 to 10,000,000 weight average molecular weight, and, an alkali carboxymethylcellulose of 10,000 to 6,000,000 weight average molecular weight such as sodium carboxymethylcellulose.
      <br/>
      Composition 19 comprises 10 mg to 475 mg of hydrophilic polymer 21.
      <br/>
      Composition 19 can comprise additionally 1 mg to 75 mg of poly(cellulose) 22, a member selected from the group consisting of hydroxyethylcellulose, hydroxypropylcellulose, hydroxypropylmethylcellulose, and hydroxypropylbutylcellulose.
      <br/>
      Driving force composition 19 comprises 0.5 mg to 175 mg of an osmotically effective solute 23, known also as osmagents, that imbibe fluid through wall 12 into dosage form 10.
      <br/>
      The osmotically effective solutes are selected from the group consisting of salt, acid, amine, ester and carbohydrate as represented by a member selected from the group consisting of magnesium sulfate, magnesium chloride, potassium sulfate, sodium sulfate, lithium sulfate, potassium acid phosphate, mannitol, urea, inositol, magnesium succinate, tartaric acid, sodium chloride, potassium chloride, and carbohydrates such as raffinose, sucrose, glucose, lactose, and sorbitol.
      <br/>
      Composition 19 optionally comprises 0 wt % to 3.5 wt % of a colorant such as ferric oxide.
      <br/>
      The total weight of all components in composition 19 is equal to 100 wt %.
    </p>
    <p num="26">
      Dosage form 10, when in operation in a fluid environment of use, such as the gastrointestinal tract of a human, imbibes fluid through wall 12 into dosage form 10, thereby causing capsule wall 16 to open and release its drug formulation into compartment 14.
      <br/>
      Also, when dosage form 10 is in operation, fluid is imbibed into composition 19 thereby causing composition 19 to absorb the imbibed fluid and expand to produce a driving force that pushes against drug formulation in compartment 14.
      <br/>
      These chemical/physical actions cause the displacement of drug formulation from dosage form 10.
    </p>
    <p num="27">
      In drawing FIG. 3, dosage form 10 is seen in opened view.
      <br/>
      Dosage form 10 in FIG. 3 comprises an exterior wall 12 that surrounds and forms an internal compartment 14.
      <br/>
      Dosage form 10 comprises a closed end 9 distant from a mouth 15 or an opened end.
      <br/>
      Wall 12 comprises an injection-molded composition as described in FIG. 2.
      <br/>
      Dosage form 10 in FIG. 3 contains a one-piece capsule 16.
      <br/>
      The one-piece capsule 16 is of sealed construction that encapsulates a drug formulation thereon.
      <br/>
      The one-piece capsule 16 is made by various processes, including the plate process, the rotary die process, the reciprocating die process, and the continuous process.
      <br/>
      The plate process uses a set of molds.
      <br/>
      A warm sheet of a prepared capsule lamina-forming material is laid over the lower mold and the agent formulation poured on it.
      <br/>
      A second sheet of the lamina-forming material is placed over the agent formulation followed by the top mold.
      <br/>
      The mold set is placed under a press and a pressure applied, with or without heat to form a unit, soft capsule.
      <br/>
      The capsules are washed with a solvent for removing excess agent formulation from the exterior of the capsule, and the capsule is then air-dried at room temperature, about 22.50 (degree)  C.
    </p>
    <p num="28">
      The rotary die process uses two continuous films of capsule lamina-forming material that are brought into convergence between a pair of revolving dies and an injector wedge.
      <br/>
      The process fills and seals the capsule in dual and coincident operations.
      <br/>
      In this process, the sheets of capsule lamina-forming material are fed over guide rolls, and then down between the wedge injector and the die rolls.
      <br/>
      The agent formulation to be capsuled flows by gravity into a positive displacement pump.
      <br/>
      The pump meters the agent formulation through the wedge injector and into the sheets between the die rolls.
      <br/>
      The bottom of the wedge contains small orifices lined up with the die pockets of the die rolls.
      <br/>
      The capsule is about half-sealed when the pressure of pumped agent formulation forces the sheets into the die pockets, wherein is the soft capsules are simultaneously filled, shaped, hermetically sealed and cut from the sheets of lamina-forming materials.
      <br/>
      The sealing of the soft capsule is achieved by mechanical pressure on the die rolls and by heating of the sheets of lamina-forming materials by the wedge.
      <br/>
      After manufacture, the agent formulation-filled capsules are dried in the presence of forced air, and placed into the dosage form.
    </p>
    <p num="29">
      The reciprocating die process produces soft capsules by leading two films of capsule lamina-forming material between a set of vertical dies.
      <br/>
      The dies as they close, open, and close perform as a continuous vertical plate forming row after row of pockets across the film.
      <br/>
      The pockets are filled with drug formulation, and as the pockets move through the dies, they are sealed, shaped, and cut from the moving film as capsules filled with agent formulation.
      <br/>
      The filled capsules 16 next are positioned in dosage form 10.
      <br/>
      The continuous process is a manufacturing system that also uses rotary dies, with the added feature that the process can successfully fill drug formulation in dry powder form into capsule 16, in addition to encapsulating liquids.
      <br/>
      Next, the capsule is placed into dosage form 10, free of lamination to the internal surface of wall 12.
      <br/>
      Procedures for manufacturing capsules are disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,627,850, issued to inventors Deters, Theeuwes, Mullins and Eckenhoff.
    </p>
    <p num="30">
      In accordance with the practice of this invention, capsules 16 are made of tasteless materials that are filled easily, and they can have a variety of sizes from triple zero to five.
      <br/>
      The capsules used for the purpose of this invention can be transparent, colorless, or colored capsules can be used to give a special product a distinctive appearance.
      <br/>
      The capsules can be filled manually or by machine-filling methods.
      <br/>
      The capsule can be made from capsule forming materials comprising gelatin.
      <br/>
      Various gelatins can be used for this purpose, including gelatin having a viscosity of 15 to 30 millipoises and a bloom strength up to 150 grams; gelatin having a bloom value of 160 to 250; a composition comprising gelatin, glycerine, water and titanium dioxide; a composition comprising gelatin, erythrosin, iron oxide and titanium dioxide; a composition comprising gelatin, glycerine, sorbitol, potassium sorbate and titanium dixide; and a composition comprising gelatin, acacia, glycerine, and water.

      In drawing FIG. 5, dosage form 10 comprises a snap-in cap 25 that comprises an orifice 26 therethrough.
      <br/>
      The snap-in cap 25 engages the internal surface of wall 12 while sealingly engaging the internal surface to close the initial mouth by friction.
      <br/>
      The friction concomitantly applies resistance to motion between the internal surface of wall 12 and snap-in cap 25.
