    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">The invention relates to novel cascade polymer complexing compounds and complexes, agents containing these compounds, the use of the complexes in diagnostics and therapy, as well as processes for the production of these compounds and agents.</p>
    <p num="3">
      "Magnevist" (GdDTPA/dimeglumine) is the first recorded contrast medium for nuclear spin tomography (MRI=magnetic resonance imaging).
      <br/>
      It is particularly well suited for the diagnosis of pathological areas (e.g., inflammations, tumors, etc.).
      <br/>
      The compound is eliminated, upon intravenous injection, by way of the kidneys; extrarenal elimination is practically not at all observed.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      One disadvantage of "Magnevist" resides in that it is distributed after intravenous administration uniformly between the vasal and interstitial spaces.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, contrasting of the vessels with respect to the surrounding interstitial space is impossible with the use of "Magnevist".
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      Especially for the imaging of vessels, a contrast medium would be desirable which is distributed exclusively in the vasal space (vascular space).
      <br/>
      Such a blood pool agent is to make it possible, with the aid of nuclear spin tomography, to demarcate tissue with good circulation from tissue with poor circulation, and thus to diagnose an ischemia.
      <br/>
      Also infarcted tissue could be distinguished, on account of its anemia, from surrounding healthy or ischemic tissue with the use of a vasal contrast medium.
      <br/>
      This is of special importance in case the objective is, for example, to distinguish a cardiac infarction from an ischemia.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      Heretofore, most of those patients suspected of harboring a cardiovascular disease (this disease being the most frequent cause of death in Western industrial countries) had to undergo invasive diagnostic tests.
      <br/>
      In angiography, X-ray diagnostics is presently used, above all, with the aid of iodine-containing contrast media.
      <br/>
      These tests are burdened by various drawbacks: they bring the risk of radiation stress, as well as discomfort and strain stemming, above all, from the fact that the iodine-containing contrast media must be utilized in a very much higher concentration as compared with NMR contrast media.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      Therefore, there is a need for NMR contrast media which can mark the vasal space (blood pool agent).
      <br/>
      These compounds are to be distinguished by good compatibility and by high efficacy (great increase in signal intensity during MRI).
    </p>
    <p num="8">The premise of solving at least part of these problems by the use of complexing agents bound to macro- or biomolecules has thus far been successful to only a very limited extent.</p>
    <p num="9">Thus, for example, the number of paramagnetic centers in the complexes described in European Patent Applications No. 88,695 and No. 150,884 is inadequate for satisfactory imaging.</p>
    <p num="10">
      When increasing the number of required metal ions by repeated introduction of complexing units into a macromolecule, the result is an intolerable impairment of the affinity and/or specificity of this macromolecule �J.
      <br/>
      Nucli. Med. 24: 1158 (1983)�.
    </p>
    <p num="11">
      Macromolecules are generally suited as contrast media for angiography.
      <br/>
      Albumin-GdDTPA (Radiology 1987; 162: 205), for example, shows, however, an accumulation in liver tissue to an extent of almost 30% of the dose 24 hours after intravenous injection in rats.
      <br/>
      Besides, only 20% of the dose is eliminated within 24 hours.
    </p>
    <p num="12">
      The macromolecule polylysine-GdDTPA (European Patent Application, Publication No. 0,233,619) likewise proved to be suitable as a blood pool agent.
      <br/>
      However, this compound, on account of its production, consists of a mixture of molecules of various sizes.
      <br/>
      In elimination tests on rats, it could be demonstrated that this macromolecule is eliminated unchanged by glomerular filtration via the kidneys.
      <br/>
      Due to its synthesis, however, polylysine-GdDTPA can also contain macromolecules which are so large that they cannot pass through the renal capillaries during glomerular filtration and therefore remain in the body.
    </p>
    <p num="13">
      Macromolecular contrast media based on carbohydrates, for example dextran, have also been described (European Patent Application, Publication No. 0,326,226).
      <br/>
      The disadvantage of these compounds resides in that they carry normally only 4.6% of the signal-intensifying paramagnetic cation.
    </p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="14">
      An object, therefore, resides in making available novel diagnostic aids, above all for the recognition and localization of vascular diseases, which aids do not exhibit the aforedescribed disadvantages.
      <br/>
      This and other objects have been attained by the present invention.
    </p>
    <p num="15">It has been found that complexes comprising nitrogen-containing cascade polymers provided with complexing ligands, ions of an element of atomic numbers 21-29, 39, 42, 44 or 57-83, as well as optionally cations of inorganic and/or organic bases, amino acids or amino acid amides, are surprisingly excellently suitable for the production of NMR and X-ray diagnostic media without exhibiting the afore-mentioned drawbacks.</p>

      They are distributed (if V' does not contain a bio- or macromolecule) only in the vasal space and thus can map this space with the aid of nuclear spin tomography.

    <p num="51">The compatibility of the compounds according to this invention is improved by at least a factor of 3 over "Magnevist" (LD50 i.v. mice of Example 8: 30 mmol/kg; "Magnevist":  &lt;= 10).</p>
    <p num="52">The value of osmolality, responsible for side effects, such as pain, damage to the blood vessels and cardiovascular disturbances, is reduced as compared with "Magnevist" (Example 8: 0.46 �osmol/kg� as compared with "Magnevist" 1.96 �osmol/kg�, 0.5 mol/l at 37 (degree)  C.).</p>
    <p num="53">The value for the magnitude of relaxation, representing a measure for imaging in MRI, is surprisingly high; signal intensification could be increased over "Magnevist", for example in case of the compound of Example 8, fourfold.</p>
    <p num="54">
      As compared with the macromolecular contrast media based on carbohydrates, e.g. dextran (European Patent Application, Publication No. 0,326,226) which carry--as mentioned--normally only 4.6% of the signal-intensifying paramagnetic cation, the polymer complexes of this invention contain more than 15% of the paramagnetic cation.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, the macromolecules of this invention bring about, per molecule, a very much higher signal intensification which has the result, at the same time, that the dose required for nuclear spin tomography is considerably smaller as compared with that for macromolecular contrast media based on carbohydrates.
    </p>
    <p num="55">
      It has been made possible with the polymer complexes according to this invention to construct and produce macromolecules in such a way that they exhibit a uniformly defined molecular weight.
      <br/>
      Such macromolecular contrast media, exactly definable in their molecular size, have not been accessible heretofore.
      <br/>
      It is thus surprisingly possible for the first time to regulate the size of the macromolecules so that these are large enough to be able to leave the vasal space only gradually but, at the same time, small enough to still pass through the kidney capillaries which have a size of 300--800  Angstrom .
      <br/>
      It has thus been accomplished for the first time to produce macromolecular contrast media tailored to the body.
    </p>
    <p num="56">
      The complexes of this invention serve as contrast media for imaging the vessels by means of nuclear spin tomography.
      <br/>
      It is thus possible to differentiate between ischemic tissue and normal tissue.
      <br/>
      However, also other damage to the blood-tissue barrier can be recognized by means of these compounds.
      <br/>
      In case of inflammations and tumors in the brain, the blood-brain barrier is damaged to such an extent that the contrast medium can infiltrate the diseased tissue and thus the diseased tissue becomes visible in nuclear spin tomography.
      <br/>
      On account of the impermeability of the intact blood-brain barrier, even to small, but hydrophilic molecules, inflammations and tumors have also been recognizable even with the low-molecular compound "Magnevist".
      <br/>
      However, when using the complexes of this invention in these cases, the dosage can be reduced sixteenfold, for two reasons: (1) they exhibit a signal intensification which is four times higher, and (2) they are distributed in a space that is four times smaller, namely only in the vasal space, i.e. in order to reach the same concentrations in the blood, one-fourth of the dose is sufficient.
    </p>
    <p num="57">
      Another advantage of the present invention resides in that complexes with hydrophilic or lipophilic, macrocyclic or open-chain, low-molecular or high-molecular ligands have now become accessible.

      However, this type of linkage is burdened by the drawback of lack in complex stability of the conjugates and/or lack of specificity (for instance, Diagnostic Imaging 84: 56; Science 220: 613, 1983; Cancer Drug Delivery 1: 125, 1984).

      The conjugate formation according to the present invention takes place, in contrast thereto, via the functional groups present in V'. It is possible herein to bind up to more than one-hundred metal ions via one binding site in the macromolecule.

      In case of the antibody conjugates, binding of the antibody to the complex or ligand must not lead to loss or reduction of binding affinity and binding specificity of the antibody to the antigen.
      <br/>
      This can be accomplished either by binding to the carbohydrate portion in the Fc part of the glycoprotein and/or in the Fab or F(ab')2 fragments, or by binding to sulfur atoms of the antibody and/or antibody fragments.

      This oxidation can be carried out by chemical methods with oxidizing agents such as, for example, periodic acid, sodium metaperiodate, or potassium metaperiodate in accordance with methods known from the literature (e.g., J. Histochem. and Cytochem. 22: 1084, 1974) in an aqueous solution in concentrations of 1-100 mg/ml, preferably 1-20 mg/ml, and with a concentration of the oxidizing agent of between 0.001 to 10 millimoles, preferably 1 to 10 millimoles, in a pH range of about 4 to 8 at a temperature of between 0 (degree)  and 37 (degree)  C. and with a reaction period of between 15 minutes and 24 hours.
      <br/>
      The oxidation can also be performed by enzymatic methods, for example with the aid of galactose oxidase in an enzyme concentration of 10-100 units/ml, a substrate concentration of 1-20 mg/ml, at a pH of 5 to 8, a reaction period of 1-8 hours, and a temperature of between 20 (degree)  and 40 (degree)  C.

      Complexes or ligands with suitable functional groups, such as, for example hydrazine, hydrazide, hydroxylamine, phenylhydrazine, semicarbazide and thiosemicarbazide, are bound to the aldehydes generated by oxidation; this is done by reacting between 0 (degree)  and 37 (degree)  C. with a reaction period of 1-65 hours, a pH of between about 5.5 and 8, an antibody concentration of 0.5-20 mg/ml, and a molar ratio of the complexing compound to the antibody aldehyde of 1:1 to 1000:1.
      <br/>
      The subsequent stabilization of the conjugate takes place by reduction of the double bond, for example with sodium borohydride or sodium cyanoborohydride; the reducing agent is utilized herein with a 10- to 100-fold excess (e.g., J. Biol. Chem. 254: 4359, 1979).

      The second possibility of forming antibody conjugates starts with a gentle reduction of the disulfide bridges of the immunoglobulin molecule; in this process, the more sensitive disulfide bridges between the H chains of the antibody molecule are cleaved whereas the S--S bonds of the antigen-binding region remain intact so that there is practically no reduction in binding affinity and specificity of the antibody (Biochem. 18: 2226, 1979; Handbook of Experimental Immunology, vol. 1, 2nd ed., Blackwell Scientific Publications, London 1973, chapter 10).
      <br/>
      These free sulfhydryl groups of the inter-H-chain regions are then reacted with suitable functional groups of complexing compounds or metal complexes at 0-37 (degree)  C., a pH of about 4-7, and a reaction period of 3-72 hours with the formation of a covalent bond which does not affect the antigen binding region of the antibody.

      Suitable reactive groups are, for example: haloalkyl, haloacetyl, p-mercuribenzoate, isothiocyanate, thiol, epoxy groups, as well as groups to be subjected to a Michael addition reaction, such as, for example, maleinimides, methacrylo groups (e.g. J. Amer. Chem. Soc. 101: 3097, 1979).

      The coupling principle resides in first producing a bifunctional macromolecule by either fusing an antibody hybridoma directed against a tumor antigen with a second antibody hybridoma directed against a complex according to this invention, or linking the two antibodies chemically via a linker (e.g. in the way set forth in J. Amer. Chem. Soc. 101: 3097, 1979) or binding the antibody directed against the tumor antigen to avidin (or biotin, respectively), optionally via a linker �D. J. Hnatowich et al., J. Nucl. Med. 28: 1294 (1987)�. In place of the antibodies, it is also possible to employ their corresponding F(ab) or F(ab')2 fragments.
      <br/>
      For pharmaceutical usage, first the bifunctional macromolecule is injected which is accumulated at the target site, and then, at a time interval, the complex compound of this invention is injected �optionally bound to biotin (or avidin)� which is coupled on at the target site in vivo and there can deploy its diagnostic or therapeutic activity.

      A particularly simple method for the production of antibody conjugates or antibody fragment conjugates is available in the form of the so-called solid phase coupling procedure: The antibody is coupled to a stationary phase (e.g. an ion exchanger) located, for example, in a glass column.
      <br/>
      By successive flushing of the column with a solution suitable for generation of aldehyde groups, washing, rinsing with a solution of the functionalized complex (or ligand), washing (in case the ligand is used, rinsing is furthermore performed with a solution containing the metal salt, followed by another rinsing step) and, finally, elution of the conjugate, very high conjugate yields are obtained.
    </p>
    <p num="123">This procedure permits the automatic and continuous production of any desired quantities of conjugates.</p>
    <p num="124">Also other coupling steps can be performed in this way.</p>
    <p num="125">Thus, for example, fragment conjugates can be prepared by the sequence of papain reduction/bifunctional linker/functionalized complex or ligand.</p>
    <p num="126">The thus-formed compounds are subsequently purified preferably by chromatography by way of ion exchangers on a fast protein liquid chromatography unit.</p>
    <p num="127">The metal complexes of this invention are produced as disclosed in German Laid-Open Application 3,401,052 by dissolving or suspending the metal oxide or a metallic salt (e.g. the nitrate, acetate, carbonate, chloride or sulfate) of the element of atomic numbers 21-29, 42, 44, 57-83 in water and/or in a lower alcohol (such as methanol, ethanol or isopropanol), and reacting with a solution or suspension of the equivalent amount of the complexing ligand and subsequently, if desired, substituting any acidic hydrogen atoms present in the acid or phenol groups by cations of inorganic and/or organic bases or amino acids.</p>
    <p num="128">Introduction of the desired metal ions can take place at the stage of the complexing compounds I'A, I'B or I'C, i.e. prior to coupling to the cascade polymers, as well as after the coupling of the unmetalated ligands I'A, I'B or I'C.</p>
    <p num="129">Neutralization takes place herein with the aid of inorganic bases (e.g. hydroxides, carbonates or bicarbonates) of, for example, sodium, potassium, lithium, magnesium or calcium and/or organic bases, such as, inter alia, primary, secondary and tertiary amines, e.g. ethanolamine, morpholine, glucamine, N-methyl- and N,N-dimethylglucamine, as well as basic amino acids, such as, for example, lysine, arginine and ornithine, or of amides from originally neutral or acidic amino acids.</p>
    <p num="130">
      In order to prepare the neutral complex compounds, it is possible, for example, to add to the acidic complex salts in an aqueous solution or suspension such an amount of the desired bases that the neutral point is obtained.
      <br/>
      The resultant solution can then be concentrated to dryness under vacuum.
      <br/>
      It is frequently advantageous to precipitate the thus-formed neutral salts by adding water-miscible solvents, e.g. lower alcohols (methanol, ethanol, isopropanol and others), lower ketones (acetone and others), polar ethers (tetrahydrofuran, dioxane, 1,2-dimethoxyethane and others) and to obtain in this way crystallized products which can be easily isolated and readily purified.
      <br/>
      It proved to be especially advantageous to add the desired base as early as during the complex formation to the reaction mixture and thereby to save a process step.
    </p>
    <p num="131">In case the acidic complex compounds contain several free acidic groups, it is frequently expedient to produce neutral mixed salts containing inorganic as well as organic cations as the counterions.</p>
    <p num="132">
      This can be done, for example, by reacting the complex forming ligand in an aqueous suspension or solution with the oxide or salt of the element yielding the central ion, and with half the amount of an organic base required for neutralization; isolating the thus-formed complex salt; purifying same if desired; and then combining, for complete neutralization, with the needed amount of inorganic base.
      <br/>
      The sequence of addition of the bases can also be reversed.
    </p>
    <p num="133">
      Another possibility of obtaining neutral complex compounds resides in converting the remaining acid groups in the complex entirely or partially into esters or amides, for example.
      <br/>
      This can be done by subsequent reaction at the finished polymer complex (e.g. by exhaustive reaction of the free carboxy groups with dimethyl sulfate), as well as also by the use of a suitably derivatized substrate for introducing the complexing units of general Formulae I'A, I'B and I'C (e.g. N3 -(2,6-dioxomorpholinoethyl)-N6- (ethoxycarbonylmethyl)-3,6-diazaoctanedioic acid).

    <p num="134">The conjugates of antibody and complex are dialyzed, prior to in vivo use, after incubation with a weak complexing agent, such as, for example, sodium citrate, sodium ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, in order to remove weakly bound metal atoms.</p>

      The pharmaceutical agents of this invention are likewise produced in a manner known per se by suspending or dissolving the complex compounds of this invention--optionally combined with the additives customary in galenic pharmacy--in an aqueous medium and then optionally sterilizing the suspension or solution.
      <br/>
      Suitable additives are, for example, physiologically acceptable buffers (such as, for instance, tromethamine), additions of complexing agents (e.g. diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid) or--if required--electrolytes, e.g. sodium chloride or--if necessary--antioxidants, such as ascorbic acid, for example.
    </p>
    <p num="136">If suspensions or solutions of the compounds of this invention in water or physiological saline solution are desirable for enteral administration or other purposes, they are mixed with one or several of the auxiliary agents (e.g. methylcellulose, lactose, mannitol) and/or tensides (e.g. lecithins, "Tween", "Myrj" ) and/or flavoring agents to improve taste (e.g. ethereal oils), as customary in galenic pharmacy.</p>
    <p num="137">
      In principle, it is also possible to produce the pharmaceutical agents of this invention without isolating the complex salts.
      <br/>
      In any event, special care must be taken to effect chelate formation so that the salts and salt solutions according to this invention are practically devoid of uncomplexed, toxically active metal ions.

    <p num="138">
      This can be ensured, for example, with the aid of dye indicators, such as xylenol orange, by control titrations during the manufacturing process.

      The good water solubility and low osmolality of the compounds of this invention make it possible to prepare highly concentrated solutions, thus maintaining the volume load on the circulation within tolerable limits and compensating for dilution by body fluid, i.e. NMR diagnostic aids must exhibit 100-1,000 times the water solubility of agents for NIR spectroscopy.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, the agents of this invention exhibit not only a high in vitro stability but also a surprisingly high stability in vivo so that release or exchange of the ions--actually toxic--not bound in a covalent fashion in the complexes takes place only extremely gradually within the time period during which the novel contrast media are again completely eliminated.
