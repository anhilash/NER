    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">This invention relates to the field of compositions and methods for inhibiting the enzyme 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate (ACC) synthase in rose thereby prolonging the shelf-life of cut flowers as well as reducing leaf yellowing and petal abscission during shipping and storage.</p>
    <p num="3">
      A variety of factors cause wilting and natural abscission in flowers, particularly after a cutting of the plant or when flowers have been removed from the plant.
      <br/>
      Such factors include increased oxygen levels, wounding, chemical stress, and the plant's own production of ethylene.
      <br/>
      Of these factors, the plant's production of ethylene, has been shown to play a key role in natural senescence, the degenerative process which generally leads to controlled cell death in plants, but also in the degradation of flowers after they have been cut.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      Ethylene, in all higher plants, is important to plant growth and development from seed germination, seedling growth to flowering and senescence (Abeles, F. B. et al. (1992), In: Ethylene in Plant Biology.
      <br/>
      Eds. Abeles, F. B. et al., Academic Press, New York, pp 285-291 and 1-13; Yang, S. F. et al. (1984), Annu.
      <br/>
      Rev Plant Physiol:35, 155-189).
      <br/>
      Ethylene production in plants can also be associated with trauma induced by mechanical wounding, chemicals, stress (such as produced by temperature and water amount variations), and by disease.
      <br/>
      Hormones can also stimulate ethylene production.
      <br/>
      Such ethylene, also sometimes called "stress ethylene", can be an important factor in storage effectiveness for plants.
      <br/>
      Moreover, exposure of plant tissue to a small amount of ethylene often may be associated with increased production of ethylene by other adjacent plants.
      <br/>
      This autocatalytic effect may be often associated with losses in marketability of plant material during storage and transportation (Abeles et al., supra; Yang et al., supra).
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      The ethylene biosynthetic pathway in plants was established by Adams and Yang (Adams D. O., et al., (1979) Proc. Nat'l Acad Sci USA 76: 170-174)).
      <br/>
      The first step involves the formation of S-adenosyl-L-methionine (AdoMet) from methionine by S-adenosyl-L-methionine synthetase.
      <br/>
      AdoMet is then converted into 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate (ACC), the direct precursor of ethylene in higher plants.
      <br/>
      This conversion is catalyzed by ACC synthase (S-adenosyl-L-methionine methyl thioadenosine-lyase, EC4.4.1.14), the rate limiting step in the ethylene biosynthetic pathway. (See also Kionka C., et al., (1984) Planta 162:226-235; Amrhein N. et al., (1981) Naturwissenschaften 68: 619-620; Hoffman N. E., et al., (1982) Biochem Biophys Res Commun 104:765-770).
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      Knowledge of the biosynthetic pathway for ethylene formation has been fundamental in developing strategies for inhibiting ethylene production in plants.
      <br/>
      One approach has been to use chemical inhibitors to inhibit the synthesis or activity of ethylene, two of the most common being aminoethoxyvinylglycine and aminooxyacetic acid (Rando, R. R., 1974, Science, 185, 320-324 and in Ethylene in Plant Biology, (Abeles, F. B., et al., eds. Academic Press, p. 285)).
      <br/>
      However, chemical methods find limited use because such methods are expensive and the beneficial effect they provide is generally only short-lived.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      A second approach has been to over express ACC deaminase, an enzyme which metabolizes ACC, thereby eliminating an intermediate in the biosynthesis of ethylene (Klee, et al., (1991) Cell 3: 1187-1193) (See also Theologis, A., et al. (1993), Cellular and Molecular Aspects of the Plant Hormone Ethylene, p. 19-23).
      <br/>
      Because ACC deaminase is a bacterial enzyme, it is heterologous, and thus, external to the plant.
      <br/>
      Thus, it is unlikely that this approach will yield a modification that will be stable from generation to generation.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      Yet another approach involves attempts to genetically inhibit the production of the enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of ethylene or to inhibit the biosynthesis of the enzymes directly.
      <br/>
      This approach has the advantage of not only altering the way the plant itself functions irrespective of external factors but also of presenting a system which reproduces itself, that is, the altered plant's progeny will have the same altered properties for generations to come.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      Initial efforts to better understand the enzymes which catalyze the reactions in the biosynthesis of ethylene have involved the identification and characterization of the genes encoding for AdoMet synthetase, ACC synthase, and ACC oxidase (See also Kende H., 1993, Annu Rev Plant Physiol Mol Biol 44:283-307).
      <br/>
      Some of the genes encoding for ACC synthase have been identified for a number of plants.
      <br/>
      For instance, ACC synthase sequences have been identified for zucchini (Sato T., et al., (1989) Proc. Natl Acad Sci USA 86:6621-6625), winter squash (Nakajima, N., et al., (1990) Plant Cell Physiol 31:1021-1029), tomato (Van Der Straeten, D., et al., (1990) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 87:4859-4863); (Rottmann, W. H., et al., (1991) J Mol Biol 222:937-961), apple (Dong, J. G., et al., (1991) Planta 185:38-45), mung bean (Botella, J. R., et al., (1992a) Plant Mol Biol 20:425-436; Botella, J. R., et al., (1993) Gene 123: 249-253; Botella, J. R., et al., (1992b) Plant Mol Biol 18: 793-797); Kim, W. T., et al., (1992) Plant Physiol 98:465-471), carnation (Park, K. Y., et al., (1992) Plant Mol.
      <br/>
      Biol., 18, 377-386), Arabidopsis thaliana (Liang, X., et al., (1992) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 89:11046-11050; Van Der Staeten, D., et al., (1992) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 89:9969-9973), tobacco (Bailey, B. A., et al., (1992) Plant Physiol 100: 1615-1616), rice (Zarembinski, T. I., et al., (1993) Mol Biol Cell 4: 363-373), mustard (Wen, C. M., et al., (1993) Plant Physiol 103:1019-1020), orchid (O'Neill, S. D., et al., (1993) Plant Cell 5: 419-432), broccoli (Pogson, B. J., et al., (1995) Plant Physiol 108:651-657), and potato (Schlagnhaufer, C. D., et al.. (1995) Plant Mol.
      <br/>
      Biol. 28:93-103).
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      That ACC synthase is involved in the ethylene pathway is confirmed by the fact that increased levels of ACC synthase mRNA correlate with an increased activity of ACC synthase in plants during fruit ripening and flower senescence.
      <br/>
      Similar correlation is also observed in response to exogenous signals caused either by wounding or due to treatment with hormones such as auxin, cytokinin and ethylene.
      <br/>
      Interestingly, the expression of different classes of ACC synthase occurs from a variety of signals in many plants, e.g. four different ACC synthase genes have been shown to be differentially expressed in tomato fruit, cell cultures, and hypocotyls during ripening, wounding, and auxin treatment (Olson, D. C., et al (1991) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 88:5340-5344; and Yip, W. K., (1992) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 89:2475-2479).
      <br/>
      Differential expression of two ACC synthase genes has also been observed in winter squash during wounding or by auxin (Nakajima, et al. (1990) Plant Cell Physiol, 31; 1021-29 and (1991) Plant Cell Physiol, 32; 1153-63).
      <br/>
      Similar differential regulation of expression ACC synthase genes takes place in carnation flowers by wounding or during senescence (Park, K. Y., et al., (1992) Plant Mol.
      <br/>
      Biol., 18, 377-386).
      <br/>
      The evolution of ACC synthase genes into a multigene family that responds differentially during plant development or in response to stimuli external to the plant (Rottmann, W. H., et al., (1991) J Mol Biol 222:937-961) may be a reflection of the importance of ethylene in plants. (See also Slater, A., et al., (1985) Plant Mol Biol 5:137-147). (Smith, C. J. S., et al., (1986) Planta 168; 94-100 and Smith, C. J. S., et al. (1988) Nature 334;724-26). (Hamilton, A. J., et al., (1990) Nature 346:284-286; Kock, M., et al., (1991) Plant Mol Biol 17:141-142).
    </p>
    <p num="11">
      The discovery of the foregoing and of other properties has lead to an understanding that it may be desirable to attempt to genetically alter the production of ethylene in plants.
      <br/>
      This approach, however, may be considered in some ways delicate.
      <br/>
      Elimination of ethylene is not a desired result as in many instances it will kill the plant.
      <br/>
      Modulation of ethylene--at the appropriate times--is the critical goal, not elimination of it entirely.
      <br/>
      This has been attempted at least two points in the pathway: the production of ACC by ACC synthase, and the oxidation of ACC by a different enzyme, ACC oxidase.
      <br/>
      Because the ACC synthase approach can permit stable modulation and not only total elimination of ethylene, it is a preferred technique.
      <br/>
      To date, however, successful reduction of the production of ethylene through an alteration at the ACC synthase step in the pathway has only been accomplished in one plant, tomato (Oeller, et al. (1991) Science 254:437-39).
      <br/>
      In spite of the seemingly simple conceptual nature of this goal, the actual accomplishment of an alteration of the ethylene biosynthetic pathway through the ACC synthase technique has remained elusive.
      <br/>
      This is particularly true for the rose plant, perhaps due to the fact that the identification of full length genes can be difficult for plants.
      <br/>
      As discussed later, this may, in part, be due to the fact that isolation of full length or high quality RNA has been deemed "notoriously difficult" for plants. (John, M. E., Nucleic Acids Research 20:2381, 1992, and Logemann, J. et al, Anal Biochem 163, 16-20, 1987).
    </p>
    <p num="12">
      Efforts by others highlight some of the difficulty involved.
      <br/>
      Recently, Arteca's laboratory (Wang, T. W. et al., (1995) Plant Physiol. 109:627-636) studied two cDNA molecules encoding ACC synthase from a white flower variety of a flowering geranium plant (Pelargonium x hortorum cv Snow Mass Leaves).
      <br/>
      As their publication explained (perhaps after the fact), these researchers tried to identify and characterize two clones, GAC-1 and GAC-2.
      <br/>
      In spite of their efforts, they were only able to completely identify one of those cDNA gene sequences, GAC-1.
      <br/>
      Their study examined the expression of these ACC synthase genes in different plant parts of the geranium and in response to stress induced by osmotic changes (sorbitol) or metal ions (CuCl2).
      <br/>
      It also evaluated the effects of ethylene on auxin 2,4-D induction in geranium leaves.
      <br/>
      The study indicated that GAC-1 expression was induced only by stress, whereas expression of GAC-2 appeared to be developmentally regulated.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, these authors speculated about possible future "transfer of antisense GAC-1, GAC-2 . . . into Pelargonium tissues through the Agrobacterium transformation or particle bombardment." This confirms a desire in the art for an ACC synthase approach to altering ethylene production in such plants.
      <br/>
      In spite of this desire, however, the isolation and identification of some, if not all, the ACC synthase gene sequences--for geranium remained elusive.
      <br/>
      In similar fashion, rose as well has remained elusive.
    </p>
    <p num="13">
      Although several plant ACC synthase genes have been identified and sequenced, the current invention describes ACC synthase gene sequences which were previously unknown and which are not believed to have been easily discoverable.
      <br/>
      As mentioned, one factor which may have militated against an expectation of successfully cloning a plant gene is the particular difficulty in obtaining high-quality and full-length RNA from plants.
      <br/>
      Indeed, this process has been characterized as "notoriously difficult" by at least more than one practitioner of the art (John, M. E., Nucleic Acids Res. 20:2381, 1992 and Logemann, J., et al, Anal Biochem 163, 16-20, 1987)).
      <br/>
      While this proved to be true for the present inventor, these difficulties were overcome by assessing a new approach to the RNA isolation process.
      <br/>
      The current inventor, after finding traditional RNA isolation methods to be ineffective, was forced to develop a non-traditional approach described herein.
      <br/>
      Basically, even though those of ordinary skill in the art had long desired to identify some gene to manipulate to alter the production of ethylene in some plants, in this case, they failed to realize that the problem lay in the need for a better isolation process.
      <br/>
      Even though the implementing technology for this process had long been available, those in the art apparently failed to realize how to use that technology to achieve the results now described.
      <br/>
      To some extent they simply may not have defined the problem, preventing the achievement the goals sought.
      <br/>
      Their efforts may properly be characterized as having taught away from the direction taken by the present inventor and, thus, the results achieved here should be considered unexpected.
    </p>
    <p num="14">
      Difficulties in isolating full-length mRNA in the specific case of geranium and rose are also further reflected by the fact that one of the sequences encoding ACC synthase in a geranium isolated by the current inventor (clone pPHSacc49), though it may bear some similarity to portions of the clone termed GAC-2 by Wang et al., supra, (which, in any case, may have been discovered after the making of the present invention) is actually considerably longer than GAC-2.
      <br/>
      This highlights the difficulty in successfully isolating a full-length mRNA molecule using standard RNA isolation procedures in certain plant materials including roses.
      <br/>
      However, the high quality RNA (as defined below) isolated by the current inventor is evidenced by the fact that full length cDNA clones were obtained in a different plant, and all of them could be successfully expressed in an in vitro expression system.
      <br/>
      In each case, full length ACC synthase (enzyme) protein is synthesized in vitro.
      <br/>
      In contrast, even later publications by Arteca's group do not describe the actual in vitro expression of any of the isolated DNA clones.
      <br/>
      In fact the cDNA for the GAC-2 gene was never isolated.
      <br/>
      Rather, only a partial sequence was merely deduced from the sequence of genomic clones.
    </p>
    <p num="15">
      This is significant because it highlights the difficulty in isolating and thereby identifying full length ACC synthase genes.
      <br/>
      Those of ordinary skill in the art had faced the same challenge.
      <br/>
      Derivation of DNA encoding ACC synthase from a genomic clone rarely is successful, and therefore, simply would not necessarily provide a reasonable expectation of success to one of ordinary skill.
      <br/>
      Only by utilizing a new and different approach did the present invention successfully identify not only one but several full length ACC synthase gene sequences from the geranium plant.
      <br/>
      The same technique applies to the identification of the ACC synthase gene sequence from the rose plant.
      <br/>
      Basically, it was this high quality library containing full length cDNA clones which allowed the present inventor to successfully achieve direct cloning of ACC synthase cDNA.
      <br/>
      The prior art did not discover these sequences because the genes did not exist in the available libraries.
      <br/>
      It was this new approach which overcame the problems faced, but not solved, by others and resulted in the extraordinary successes described herein.
      <br/>
      The extraordinary success of the present invention--a nearly one hundred fold increase in positive identifications is a consequence of the new technique for RNA isolation and cDNA identification, and not the result of analogous knowledge gained from the efforts of others.
      <br/>
      Mere comparison to other genes in the same or different plants did not and could not have yielded the successes described here.
      <br/>
      The existence of the cDNAs of interest in the library was the governing factor.
      <br/>
      Thus, even with a viable identification process, successful identification of the rose ACC synthase gene, let alone the actual alteration of the plants themselves by means of this knowledge, would not have been likely.
    </p>
    <p num="16">
      Additionally, it should be understood that knowledge of the full length sequence of a gene from other plants simply does not necessarily lead one to the sequences of the homologous genes in the rose plants.
      <br/>
      First, as mentioned earlier, the genes encoding ACC synthase have evolved into a multigene system in some cases.
      <br/>
      There appears to be no single gene, but rather a family of genes in most cases.
      <br/>
      Thus, knowledge of one gene in one plant species is not certain to lead to one (or several) homologous or analogous genes in another plant species.
      <br/>
      Second, because known ACC synthase genes are typically so diverse in their nucleotide sequences, knowledge of one would not lead a person of ordinary skill in the art to an expectation of success in isolating the ACC synthase gene from rose.

      Antisense technology is a well known approach to create a plant that produces less of a selected protein.
      <br/>
      Through this technology, a plant is altered by introducing a foreign DNA sequence that encodes an mRNA product complementary to part or all of the plant's "sense" mRNA encoding the protein.
      <br/>
      The presence of antisense RNA inhibits RNA function within a cell (and whole organism).
      <br/>
      Antisense RNA can bind in a highly specific manner to its complementary sense RNA resulting in blockade in processing and/or translation of the sense mRNA.
      <br/>
      Antisense RNA may also disrupt interactions between sense mRNA and sequence-specific RNA binding proteins.
      <br/>
      Antisense technology may be employed to inhibit the synthesis of an enzyme involved in ethylene biosynthesis.
      <br/>
      The genes identified by the current inventor and disclosed herein have been used for the conception and implementation of antisense sequences specific for ACC synthase mRNA.
      <br/>
      Introduction of DNA encoding such antisense RNA sequences into a rose plant is highly probable to result in a plant which stably produces less ethylene.
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      The incorporation of antisense RNA in plants as a means to inhibit the synthesis of enzymes has been described by various investigators.
      <br/>
      Rothstein, et al. (1987) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 84: 8439, found that antisense RNA inhibited nopaline synthase (nos) in tobacco.
      <br/>
      Smith, C. J. S., et al. (1988) Nature 334: 724, reported that antisense RNA inhibited polygalacturonase in tomato.
      <br/>
      Others have used antisense RNA to inhibit the synthesis of enzymes involved in ethylene formation.
      <br/>
      Oeller, P. W., et al., (1991) Science 254: 437-439, expressed RNA antisense to ACC synthase in tomato plants.
      <br/>
      Others have expressed antisense RNA to a different ethylene forming enzyme (EFE), ACC oxidase, in carnation and tomato (Michael, M. Z., et al., 1993, In: Pech, J. C., et al., eds., Cellular and Molecular Aspects of the Plant Hormone Ethylene (Kluwer Academic Publishers, pp. 298-302); Hamilton, A. J., et al. (1990) Nature 346: 284-287; Gray, et al. (1993), in Pech, J. C., et al., supra, pp. 82-89; Murray, A. J., et al. (1993) in Pech, J. C., et a., supra,, pp. 327-328).
      <br/>
      The above work with antisense RNA may also be applicable to efforts to stably incorporate the sequences identified by the current inventor and their antisense sequences into a rose plant.
      <br/>
      Similarly, the success in expressing antisense RNA for ACC synthase in tomato plants may also be applicable (Oeller, et al., supra).
      <br/>
      It is noteworthy, and perhaps surprising, that neither of the foregoing disclosures have led to the long sought goal of stably altering ethylene production in rose plants.
      <br/>
      Hence, no altered rose plants expressing reduced levels of ethylene has been described.
      <br/>
      The incorporation of ACC synthase antisense DNA into a rose plant has remained elusive because the complete ACC gene sequences were not available prior to the present invention.
      <br/>
      The discoveries disclosed herein enable the production of an appropriately altered rose plant which will express ACC synthase antisense sequences and stably produce reduced levels of ethylene.

    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="19">
      This invention is based on the discovery and cloning of multiple 1-amino cyclopropane-1-carboxylate (ACC) synthase cDNA molecules.
      <br/>
      In a rose, there is one molecule which represents the ACC synthase gene from Rosa (actually the cardinal red rose cultivar of the rosa genus).
      <br/>
      The nucleotide sequence and corresponding amino acid sequence for this gene is disclosed herein.
      <br/>
      Importantly, this is believed the first report of the full-length sequence for this gene, evidenced by the ability of the cDNAs to be expressed in an expression system.

      The invention provides a method for genetic modification of rose plants to control their levels of ethylene.
      <br/>
      The newly discovered DNA sequences, fragments thereof, or combinations of such sequences or fragments, is introduced into a plant cell in reverse orientation to inhibit expression of ACC synthase, thereby reducing the levels of endogenous ethylene.
    </p>
    <p num="21">
      Using the above methods or plant-specific variants of them, transgenic plants are to be developed and monitored for growth and development.
      <br/>
      Those plants exhibiting prolonged shelf-life with respect to plant growth, flowering, and/or reduced yellowing of leaves due to reduction in levels of ethylene are to be selected and propagated as premier products with improved properties including reduced leaf yellowing and petal abscission during shipping and storage.

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
    <p num="48">
      The present inventor has isolated, cloned and identified a cDNA sequence encoding the enzyme ACC synthase in a rose plant (specifically from Rosa).
      <br/>
      This cDNA sequence corresponds to a gene which is important in the control of ethylene production.
      <br/>
      The DNA is expressed in any of a number of expression systems, including an in vitro expression system to yield a polypeptide product which preferably has ACC synthase enzymatic activity.
    </p>
    <p num="49">
      The cloned ACC synthase gene or fragments thereof, when introduced in reverse orientation (antisense) under control of a strong promoter (discussed below in detail), such as the cauliflower mosaic virus promoter CaMV35S, can be used to genetically modify a rose plant.
      <br/>
      Selected antisense sequences sharing sufficient homology to ACC synthase genes in other plants can be used to achieve similar genetic modification.
      <br/>
      One result of this modification is a reduction in the amount of translatable ACC synthase-encoding mRNA.
      <br/>
      As a consequence, the amount of ACC synthase produced in the plant cells is reduced, thereby reducing the rate of conversion of ACC to ethylene.
      <br/>
      This genetic modification can effect a permanent change in ethylene levels in the modified plant and be propagated in offspring plants by selfing or other reproductive schemes.
      <br/>
      Hence, the invention provides a plant modified as described herein as well as plants which, although modified in a different manner achieve similar results or utilize similar concepts as disclosed herein.
      <br/>
      The genetically altered plant is used to produce a new variety or line of plants wherein the alteration is stably transmitted from generation to generation.
    </p>
    <p num="50">
      The rose plant is an ethylene-sensitive flowering plant.
      <br/>
      A change in ethylene level may thus have a great impact on its commercial desirability.
      <br/>
      The present invention provides isolated ACC synthase genes obtained specifically from a rose for use in genetic modification preferably of rose plants.
      <br/>
      The full length DNA molecules described herein are unique to roses and vary significantly in sequence from ACC synthase DNA in any other unrelated plant species.
    </p>
    <p num="51">
      Because of such interspecies variation, to achieve stable genetic modification, it may be important that an ACC synthase gene or gene fragment (a) be obtained from the same species or (b) be a functional derivative of the DNA sequence native to the species.
      <br/>
      However, it is possible that a selected sequence from one plant genus or species may be employed using antisense technology in a different genus or species to achieve a useful effect such as that described here.
      <br/>
      The present invention thus provides for the first time the appropriate DNA sequences which may be used to achieve a stable genetic modification primarily of rose plants (and of other plants as well).
    </p>
    <p num="52">
      For the identification, in general, preparation of plasmid DNA, restriction enzyme digestion, agarose gel electrophoresis of DNA, Southern blots, Northern blots after separation of the RNA on a formaldehyde agarose gel, DNA ligation and bacterial transformation were carried out using conventional methods well-known in the art.

      As used herein, the term "plant" refers to either a whole plant, a plant part, a plant cell, or a group of plant cells.
      <br/>
      The types of plants which can be used in the method of the invention generally includes the genus Rosa (roses) which can take up and express the DNA molecules of the present invention.
      <br/>
      It may include plants of a variety of ploidy levels, including haploid, diploid, tetraploid, and polyploid.
    </p>
    <p num="54">
      A "transgenic plant" is defined as a plant which is genetically modified in some way, including but not limited to a plant which has incorporated heterologous DNA or modified DNA or some portion of heterologous or homologous DNA into its genome.
      <br/>
      The altered genetic material may encode a protein, comprise a regulatory or control sequence, or may comprise an antisense sequence or encode an antisense RNA which is antisense to an endogenous DNA or mRNA sequence of the plant.
      <br/>
      A "transgene" or a "transgenic sequence" is defined as a foreign or atypical gene or partial sequence which has been incorporated into a transgenic plant.
    </p>
    <p num="55">
      As used in the present application, the term "substantial sequence homology" or "substantially homologous" is used to indicate that a nucleotide sequence (in the case of DNA or RNA) or an amino acid sequence (in the case of a protein or polypeptide) exhibits substantial functional or structural equivalence with another nucleotide or amino acid sequence.
      <br/>
      Any functional or structural differences between sequences having substantial sequence homology will be de minimis; that is, they will not affect the ability of the sequence to function as indicated in the desired application.
      <br/>
      Differences may also be simply due to inherent variations in codon usage among different species.
      <br/>
      Sequences that have substantial sequence homology with the sequences disclosed herein are usually "variants" of the disclosed sequence, such as mutations, but may also be synthetic sequences.
      <br/>
      Structural differences are considered de minimis if there is a significant amount of sequence overlap or similarity between two or more different sequences or if the different sequences exhibit similar physical characteristics even if the sequences differ in length or structure.
      <br/>
      Such characteristics include, for example, ability to hybridize under defined conditions, or, in the case of proteins, immunological crossreactivity, similar enzymatic activity, etc.
    </p>
    <p num="56">
      Additionally, two nucleotide sequences are substantially homologous if the sequences have at least 70 percent, more preferably 80 percent and most preferably 90 percent sequence similarity between them.
      <br/>
      Two amino acid sequences are substantially homologous if they have at least 50 percent, preferably 70 percent, and most preferably 90 percent similarity between the active portions of the polypeptides.
      <br/>
      Further the term "substantial sequence homology" should be understood to comprise any similarity which meets at least any default criteria of any model (as now readily ascertainable to those of ordinary skill in the art), or any permutation of the following criteria, each of which may also be separately specified as well to narrow the scope at any time.

    <p num="61">
      The term "hybridization" as used herein is generally understood to mean hybridization at appropriate conditions of stringency as would be readily evident to those skilled in the art depending upon the nature of the probe sequence and target sequences.
      <br/>
      Conditions of hybridization and washing are well-known in the art, and the adjustment of conditions depending upon the desired stringency by varying incubation time and temperature and ionic strength of the solution are readily accomplished.
      <br/>
      See, for example, Sambrook, J., et al., Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, Second Edition, Cold Spring Harbor Press, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y. (1989).
      <br/>
      The choice of conditions is dictated by the length of the sequences being hybridized, in particular the length of the probe sequence, the relative G-C content of the nucleic acid and the amount of mismatches to be permitted.
      <br/>
      Low stringency conditions are preferred when partial hybridization between strands that have lesser degrees of complementarity is desired.
      <br/>
      When perfect or near-perfect complementarity is desired, high stringency conditions are preferred.
      <br/>
      For typical high stringency conditions, the hybridization solution contains 6 *  SSC, 0.01M EDTA, 5 *  Denhardt's solution and 0.5% SDS. Hybridization is carried out at about 68 (degree)  C. for 3-4 hours for fragments of cloned DNA and 12-16 hours for total eukaryotic DNA.
      <br/>
      For lower stringency, the temperature is reduced to about 12 (degree)  C. below the melting temperature (Tm) of the duplex.
      <br/>
      The Tm is known to be a function of G-C content and duplex length as well as the ionic strength of the solution.

    <p num="62">
      By "functional derivative" of a nucleic acid (or poly- or oligonucleotide) is meant a "fragment," "variant," "homologue" or "analogue" of the gene or DNA sequence encoding ACC synthase, or in some way related to the production or use of ACC synthase, especially rose ACC synthase.
      <br/>
      A functional derivative may retain at least a portion of the function of the ACC synthase-encoding DNA which permits its utility in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention.
      <br/>
      Such function may include the ability to hybridize with native rose or homologous DNA from another plant which encodes ACC synthase or with an mRNA transcript thereof, or, in antisense orientation, to inhibit the transcription and/or translation of rose ACC synthase mRNA or the like.
    </p>

      A "fragment" of the gene or DNA sequence refers to any subset of the molecule, that is, a shorter polynucleotide- or oligonucleotide.

      A "variant" refers to a molecule substantially similar to either the entire gene or a fragment thereof, such as a nucleotide substitution variant having one or more substituted nucleotides but which maintains the ability to hybridize with the particular gene or to encode a mRNA transcript which hybridizes with the native DNA.

      "Altered" expression" or an "alteration" of expression of a gene (most particularly of ACC synthase), as used herein, refers to any process or result whereby the normal expression of the gene, for example that occurring in an "unmodified" rose plant, defined as a known, conventional, naturally-occurring rose plant, is changed in some fashion.
      <br/>
      As intended herein, an alteration is a complete or preferably a partial reduction in the expression of ACC synthase, but may also include a change in the timing of expression, or another state wherein the expression of ACC synthase differs from that which would be most likely to occur naturally in an unmodified rose plant, variety or cultivar.
      <br/>
      A preferred alteration is one which results in a decrease in ethylene production by the plant compared to ethylene production in an unmodified plant.

      In producing a genetically altered plant according to this invention, it is preferred to select individual plantlets or plants by the desired trait, generally reduced ACC synthesis expression and reduced ethylene production.

      Expression of ACC synthase can be measured by quantitating the amount of ACC synthase mRNA using conventional hybridization techniques.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, the amount of ACC synthase protein can be quantitated, for example in a conventional immunoassay method using a specific antibody such as those described herein.

      In order for a newly inserted gene or DNA sequence to be expressed, resulting in production of the protein which it encodes (or, in the case of antisense DNA, to be transcribed, resulting in an antisense RNA molecule), the proper regulatory signals should be present in the proper location with respect to the coding or antisense sequence.
      <br/>
      These regulatory signals may include a promoter region, a 5' non-translated leader sequence and a 3' polyadenylation sequence as well as enhancers and other known regulatory sequence.
      <br/>
      The promoter is a DNA sequence that directs the cellular machinery to transcribe the DNA to produce RNA.
      <br/>
      The promoter region influences the rate at which the mRNA product and, if the DNA encodes a protein, the resultant protein product, are made.
      <br/>
      The 3'-polyadenylation signal is a non-translated region that functions in plant cells to cause the addition of a polyadenylate stretch to the 3' end of the mRNA to stabilize it in the cytoplasm for subsequent translation.

    <p num="67">
      A promoter DNA sequence is operably linked to a second DNA sequence and regulates its transcription.
      <br/>
      If the second DNA sequence encodes a protein, the promoter DNA sequence is said to be "operably linked" if it affects the transcription of the mRNA encoding the protein product from the second DNA sequence.
      <br/>
      A DNA sequence comprising a promoter is generally physically near the coding sequence in the same recombinant construct, though physical contiguity is not required. "Strong" promoters are able to direct RNA synthesis at higher rates than weaker promoters.
      <br/>
      Certain promoters direct RNA production at higher levels only in particular types of cells and tissues.
      <br/>
      Promoters that direct RNA production in many or all tissues of a plant without the need for "induction" by a specific inducer substance are called constitutive promoters.
      <br/>
      The operation of a constitutive promoter is relatively independent of the developmental stage of the cell in which it is contained and is most preferred for the present invention.
      <br/>
      An inducible promoter is one which, in response to the presence of an inducer, is activated.
      <br/>
      Hence, a coding sequence driven by an inducible promoter can be turned on or off by providing or withdrawing the inducer.
      <br/>
      A promoter may be homologous, derived from the same species as the coding sequence.
      <br/>
      Preferably, the promoter is heterologous, that is, derived from another species, or even from a virus.
    </p>
    <p num="68">Expression levels from a promoter which is useful for the present invention can be tested using conventional expression systems, for example, by measuring levels of a reporter gene product (protein or mRNA) in extracts of the leaves, stems, roots and flowers of a transgenic plant into which the promoter/reporter have been introduced.</p>
    <p num="69">
      Cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) is a double-stranded DNA plant virus.
      <br/>
      It contains two promoters responsible for the production of transcripts of 35S and 19S in size in infected plants (Guilley, H., et al, Cell 30:763 (1982)).
      <br/>
      The 35S promoter (CaMV35S) is one of the strongest constitutive heterologous promoters known in plants (Odell, et al., Nature 313:810-812 (1985); Jensen, et al., Nature 321:669-674 (1986); Jefferson, et al., EMBO J. 6:3901-3907 (1987); Kay, et al., Science 236:1299-1302 (1987); Sanders, et al., Nucl. Acids Res. 4:1543-1558 (1987)).
      <br/>
      Two different domains within the CaMV 35S promoter may differentially regulate expression of a coding sequence in different plant tissues (domain A, from nucleotides -90 to +8) vs. domain B from nucleotides -343 to -90), as described by Benfey, et al., 1989 EMBO J 8:2195-2202.) The CaMV35S promoter is active in isolated protoplasts (Fromm, M., et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 82:5824 (1985)) and is expressed in all organs of various transgenic plants in the absence of any viral protein, making it widely used in plant genetic engineering.
    </p>
    <p num="70">
      Because of variability in the expression of genes driven by the CaMV35S promoter, (which may be either an intrinsic property of the promoter or a result of variability in the position at which CaMV35S promoter-driven DNA sequence is integrated into the genome of the transformed plant), CaMV35S may be particularly useful for effecting different degrees of altered gene expression by an antisense sequence which the promoter controls.
      <br/>
      Additional useful plant promoters in, for example, other caulimoviruses (a group of double-stranded DNA viruses to which the cauliflower mosaic virus belongs) have also been developed and are useful for similar applications.
      <br/>
      Two caulimoviruses distantly related to CaMV are the figwort mosaic virus (FMV) (Richins, et al., Nucl. Acids Res. 15:8451-8466 (1987)) and the carnation etched ring virus (CERV) (Hull, et al., EMBO J 5:3083-3090 (1986).
      <br/>
      The promoters of FMV and CERV which are homologues of the CaMV35S promoter are described in Rogers, U.S. Pat. No. 5,378,619. Any of the foregoing viral promoters, as well as other viral promoters which act as strong promoters for expression of plant DNA sequences in plant cells, may be used to drive the expression of the DNA molecules of the present invention.
    </p>
    <p num="71">
      Certain other strong plant promoters are also useful to direct the expression of the ACC synthase DNA (or antisense sequences) of the present invention.
      <br/>
      For example, the small subunit (SSU) of the enzyme ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase (RuBPCase), the primary enzyme of the carbon fixation pathway in chloroplasts of plants of the C3 class is an example of a polypeptides known to be highly expressed in plants.
      <br/>
      A highly efficient SSU promoter DNA such as the promoter DNA from the SSU gene denominated SSU301 from Petunia (Bedbrook, et al., U.S. Pat. No. 4,962,028) may be used herein.
      <br/>
      The promoter may be used in the form of an isolated 5' fragment of the SSU gene, and preferably has the 3' end of the fragment modified to create a restriction site which permits ready fusions with the ACC synthase antisense DNA of the present invention.
      <br/>
      The promoter may be conveniently arranged to form an expression cassette comprising a 5' fragment (the promoter region of the SSU gene), a 3' fragment and a linker region connecting the two fragments.
      <br/>
      The fusion points between the 5' fragment and the linker region and between the 3' fragment and the linker region are preferably modified to create restriction sites which permit the antisense DNA of the present invention to be substituted for the linker so as to yield "chimeric" genes containing the complete proximal 5' and 3' regions of the SSU gene but none of the SSU coding sequence

      The present invention provides antisense oligonucleotides and polynucleotides complementary to the gene or genes encoding ACC synthase in a rose plant.
      <br/>
      Such antisense oligonucleotides, should be at least about six, ten, twenty, or fifty nucleotides in length to provide minimal specificity of hybridization, and may be complementary to one strand of DNA or to mRNA encoding ACC synthase (or to a portion thereof), or to flanking sequences in genomic DNA which are involved in regulating ACC synthase gene expression.
      <br/>
      The antisense oligonucleotide may be as large as about 100 nucleotides, an may extend in length up to and beyond the full coding sequence for which it is antisense.
      <br/>
      The oligonucleotides can be DNA or RNA or chimeric mixtures or derivatives or modified versions thereof, single-stranded or double-stranded.
    </p>
    <p num="76">
      The action of the antisense nucleotide may result in specific alteration, primarily inhibition, of ACC synthase gene expression in cells.
      <br/>
      For a general discussion of antisense, see: Alberts, B., et al., MOLECULAR BIOLOGY OF THE CELL, 2nd Ed., Garland Publishing, Inc., New York, N.Y. (1989), in particular, pages 195-196, which reference is hereby incorporated by reference.

    <p num="77">
      The antisense oligonucleotide may be complementary to any portion of the ACC synthase encoding sequence.
      <br/>
      In one embodiment, the antisense oligonucleotide may be between about 6, 10, 20, or 50 and 100 nucleotides, and may be complementary to the initiation ATG codon and an upstream, non-coding translation initiation site of the ACC synthase sequence.
      <br/>
      For example, antisense nucleotides complementary primarily for non-coding sequence, are known to be effective inhibitors of the expression of genes encoding transcription factors (Branch, M. A., 1993 Molec.
      <br/>
      Cell. Biol. 13:4284-4290).
    </p>
    <p num="78">
      Preferred antisense oligonucleotides are complementary to a portion of the mRNA encoding ACC synthase.
      <br/>
      For instance, it is expected that by introducing a full length cDNA clone gene in an antisense orientation, successful alteration of gene expression will be most probable.
      <br/>
      Naturally, introduction of partial sequences, targeting to specific regions of the gene, and the like can be effective as well.
      <br/>
      An example of a preferred antisense oligonucleotide for a rose is a 50mer which is antisense to 50 nucleotides in the 5' half of an RNA transcript of an ACC-encoding cDNA (such as SEQ ID NO: 1), more preferably any stretch of 50 nucleotides in the first 500 nucleotides of the 5' part of the RNA transcript.
      <br/>
      For example, the antisense oligonucleotide can be antisense to nucleotides 1-50, 2-51, 3-52, 4-53, 5-54, etc., of the RNA transcript.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, the antisense oligonucleotide can be shorter for wither plant, for example a 30-mer, and be antisense to any 30 nucleotide stretch of the RNA transcript, preferably in the first 500 5' nucleotides.

      As is readily discernible by one of ordinary skill in the art, the minimal amount of homology required by the present invention is that sufficient to result in sufficient complementarity to provide recognition of the specific target RNA and inhibition or reduction of its translation or function while not affecting function of other mRNA molecules and the expression of other genes.
      <br/>
      While the antisense oligonucleotides of the invention comprise sequences complementary to at least a portion of an RNA transcript of ACC synthase, absolute complementarity, although preferred, may not be required.
      <br/>
      A sequence "complementary to at least a portion of" another sequence, as referred to herein, may have sufficient complementarity to be able to hybridize with that of other sequences in vivo, perhaps forming a stable duplex.
      <br/>
      Naturally, the ability to hybridize may depend on both the degree of complementarity and the length of the antisense nucleic acid.
      <br/>
      Generally, the longer the hybridizing nucleic acid, the more base mismatches with the ACC synthase target sequence it may contain and still form a stable duplex.

      One skilled in the art can ascertain a tolerable degree of mismatch by use of standard procedures to determine the melting temperature of the hybridized complex as discussed above and other techniques.

      When this method was tried by the present inventor for a geranium, the quality of RNA obtained was inadequate and did not permit a generation of a useable, high quality cDNA library (containing cDNA inserts corresponding to the least abundant mRNAs).
      <br/>
      Thus, when cDNA libraries prepared using the conventional method were screened for the presence of cDNA inserts encoding ACC synthase, the clones identified contained only partial genes or, mostly frequently, false positives.
      <br/>
      This problem alone made the process of isolating the ACC synthase genes of this invention extremely difficult and challenging.
      <br/>
      This conclusion was also suggested from the results of expression screening of such libraries with antibodies specific for the ACC synthase protein.
      <br/>
      In sum, the prior art RNA isolation technique at best invited experiments to try to find the full length genes, but provided no reasonable expectation of success.
      <br/>
      Problems posed by the poor quality of the total RNA prepared using conventional methods led the present inventor to look for alternative means for obtaining RNA of sufficiently high quality to be useful for the purposes of this invention, namely preparation of a cDNA library having a high probability of including a full length DNA sequences corresponding to low-abundance mRNAs, in particular full-length ACC synthase coding sequences.

    <p num="97">Preparation of RNA</p>
    <p num="98">
      The preferred method discovered by the present inventor was based on the precipitation of RNA from a tissue extract using 2-butoxyethanol (Manning, K., 1991, Anal.
      <br/>
      Biochem. 195:45-50) with modifications.
      <br/>
      This method is referred to herein as "a 2-butoxyethanol precipitation technique." This technique was originally developed for RNA isolation, and by adapting it for mRNA isolation, the extraordinary results of this invention were achieved.
      <br/>
      Generally, in order to achieve the required RNA precipitation, a co-precipitation critical mass of RNA must be present in the preparation.
      <br/>
      The relative low proportion of RNA in relation to the total extracted material required the recognition by the present inventor that the standard amount of tissue extract used in RNA preparation, about 1 gram or less, would be insufficient for certain types of plants such as roses (discussed more fully below).
      <br/>
      The success described herein was ultimately attained by using an unusually large amount of tissue.
      <br/>
      For effort with roses, this was about 3-5 grams.
      <br/>
      While, in hindsight, this may seem like a simple problem and solution, in fact, this problem does not appear to have been considered by others, and, therefore, the novel method is not an obvious modification of the older technique.
    </p>
    <p num="99">
      This problem in part stems from the fact that the desired precipitation is "non-linear," meaning that no simple linear relationship exists between the mass of RNA and the amount of precipitation.
      <br/>
      Rather, the process is a threshold phenomenon, and unless that critical mass is present, precipitation will not occur.
      <br/>
      For these reasons, the prior art technique would appear on its face to be inapplicable for obtaining a high quality mRNA preparation from woody plants such as geraniums or roses.
      <br/>
      Surpassing such a critical amount of RNA, that is, an amount at which precipitation occurs, permitted the method, as modified, to demonstrate its full utility.
      <br/>
      Hence, the present inventor achieved an unexpected and extraordinary result, in spite of the fact that the technology underlying the modifications introduced to earlier methods had been available.
      <br/>
      Those of ordinary skill in the art may have appreciated (although this is not evident) that a key impediment was in the obtaining of high quality mRNA to generate a fully representative cDNA library.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, a long felt need in the art for such a library had not been satisfied.
      <br/>
      Nevertheless, substantial attempts in the prior art failed because practitioners did not understand the true nature of the reasons for failure of this type of technique.
    </p>
    <p num="100">
      The present inventor's discovery of a means to here achieve the co-precipitation critical mass of RNA is particularly important to the class of plants which have a low proportion of RNA in their tissue, such as less than only 1/10,000th of the total tissue usually obtained.
      <br/>
      It is also particularly important for woody plants such as geraniums or roses, for which the present invention is particularly useful.
      <br/>
      These groups of plants comprises plant species that have a low proportion of RNA in their tissue relative to non-nucleic acid material.
      <br/>
      This is in contrast to other plants which have a higher proportion of RNA and are amenable to the preparation of high quality mRNA (and cDNA corresponding thereto) by the traditional approaches of the prior art.
      <br/>
      While this "low RNA" group of plants is known to include at least Pelargonium and Rosa (rose) species, it is clear that other plants also fall in this category, as would be evident to those skilled in the art.
      <br/>
      This group of plants is characterized in one manner as being woody (that is, they contain large amounts of fiberous material) and therefore having a low relative abundance of RNA, or conversely, as a high relative proportion of non-nucleic acid material.
      <br/>
      Thus, in this category of low RNA plants, it would be necessary to use a "large" amount of tissue, namely, an amount which (depending upon the particular plant or technique) is sufficient to yield a co-precipitant critical mass of total RNA in the process.
      <br/>
      For Pelargonium and Rosa, and the like, a co-precipitant critical mass of RNA is about 200  MU g for successful implementation of the 2-butoxyethanol precipitation technique described herein. (Other RNA isolation techniques or plants may, of course, each have their own critical mass, that is, the presence of enough total RNA for precipitation to actually occur.) Thus, for the present technique and plants, about 3-5 grams of flower tissue was used initially.
      <br/>
      This may represent a minimum amount for some plants.
      <br/>
      Naturally more would also work.

      Translation products detected from each cloned ACC synthase gene was the size expected based on the size of the ORF of each clone.
      <br/>
      The in vitro translation product comigrate with the in vivo product upon gel electrophoresis.

    <p num="139">
      For the geranium, petioles from very young immature leaves from actively growing plants of Pelargonium hortorum cv Samba (sincerity could also have been used) were harvested and sterilized in 15% clorox for 15 minutes.
      <br/>
      They were then thoroughly rinsed with sterile distilled water (four times).
      <br/>
      The petioles were cut into 4-5 mm segments and cultured on modified MS medium as further explained in A Revised Medium For Rapid Growth And Bioassys With Tabacco Tissue Cultures, Murashige T. and Skoog, F., Physiologia Plantarum 15,473-497 (1962).
      <br/>
      Modifications consist of one half concentration of major salts and pyridoxine HCl, 1 mg/liter; nicotinic acid 1 mg/liter; and thiamine HCl 10 mg/liter.
      <br/>
      In addition, the medium used contained 5  MU M BAP and 1  MU M 1AA.
      <br/>
      After incubation of explants at 25 (degree)  C. in the dark for three days, they were transferred to light conditions.
      <br/>
      Regeneration became apparent by 15 days and continued for five weeks.
      <br/>
      The small shoots are then subcultured individually on MS medium containing 0.44  MU M BAP and 0.11  MU M IAA plus 400 mg/liter of L-glutamine.
      <br/>
      After about five weeks, they developed further to about 3-4 cm long with 4-5 nodes.
      <br/>
      They were then subcultured on basal MS medium for rooting.
    </p>
    <p num="140">
      For transformation of geranium, pPHSacc41 was cut with Not I; the staggered ends were filled-in with dGTP and dCTP using Kelnow DNA polymerase The other end was cut with Bam HI for ligation into an agrobacterium binary vector in reverse orientation.
      <br/>
      The vector was prepared for ligation using HPA I and BamI.
      <br/>
      The ligated vector (with PHSacc41 in reverse orientation) was used to transform Agrobacterium tumefaciens 2760.
    </p>
    <p num="141">
      The petiole explants were cocultivated with agrobacterium for 5-10 minutes.
      <br/>
      After several days of cocultivation, agrobacterium cells were killed in the presence of cefotaxime (400  MU g/ml) and Kananeycin (200  MU g/ml).
      <br/>
      After about two weeks selection for transformants was continued.
      <br/>
      Ultimately, the transformed plants will be grown and tested for their various properties to determine which had successfully achieved the desired ACC synthase modification.
      <br/>
      The selected genetically altered plants will be used to produce a new variety or line of plants wherein the alteration is stably transmitted from generation to generation.
      <br/>
      It is anticipated that the above regeneration and transformation procedures--with some modifications as those of ordinary skill in the art would readily understand--should work for the rose application as well.
