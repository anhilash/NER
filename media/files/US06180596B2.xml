    <heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="3">
      The present invention generally relates to annexins.
      <br/>
      More particularly, it relates to methods of inhibiting phospholipase A2 (PLA2) and the activity of PLA2 simulators which employ Annexin I and Annexin VIII.
    </p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="4">
      Annexins are a group of calcium-dependent, phospholipid-binding proteins.
      <br/>
      The calcium and phospholipid binding sites of most annexins are located in four repeated and highly conserved regions each of which contains about 70 amino acids.
      <br/>
      These proteins are widely distributed and at least nine members of the annexin family of proteins have been identified in mammalian tissues.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      The lung is rich in annexins.
      <br/>
      Several members of the annexin family of proteins with apparent molecular weights ranging from about 32 to about 40 kDa have been isolated from lungs of animals.
      <br/>
      Annexin I, a 36 kD phospholipid binding protein, 36 kDa(PLBP), appears to be the most abundant of the annexin family of proteins.
      <br/>
      It is present in the lung in greater amounts than the related Annexin VIII, a 33 kDa phospholipid-binding protein, also known as 33 kDa(PLBP).
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      Compared to the whole lung, the alveolar epithelial type II cells in which the pulmonary surfactant complex is synthesized, stored and secreted have higher expression levels of Annexin I. In addition to the intracellular localization of Annexin I in alveolar type II cells, this protein has been found in lung lavage fluids from human and animals.
      <br/>
      A likely source of the Annexin I in the lung lavage fluid is the alveolar type II cells.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      Using an antibody to Annexin I, researchers have found Annexin I and a smaller protein in the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid of patients with lung diseases.
      <br/>
      The smaller protein was found to be a proteolytic breakdown product resulting from the action of neutrophil elastase upon Annexin I in the patients' BAL fluid.
      <br/>
      The discovery of the Annexin I breakdown product in human BAL fluid samples is consistent with the report that the Annexin I N-terminal region is subject to cleavage by various proteases to yield breakdown products.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      I have discovered that a breakdown product of Annexin I, which has a molecular weight of about 33 kDa (33 kDa(BP)), immunoreacts with anti-Annexin I antibodies.
      <br/>
      I also have discovered that 33 kDa(BP) is cytotoxic and that it is present in higher concentrations in the BAL fluid of patients with lung diseases, including cystic fibrosis (CF), and premature infants with chronic lung disease, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, (BPD) than in normal humans.
      <br/>
      In addition, the BAL fluid of patients with lung disease was found to contain less Annexin I than that of normal humans.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      Based on these and other discoveries, I have found that administering Annexin I or Annexin VIII, to patients with lung disease can be beneficial to such patients.
      <br/>
      I also have made the further discovery that the administration of Annexin I or Annexin VIII, can be beneficial in the treatment of endotoxin toxicity and inflammation.
      <br/>
      The major pathogenesis of endotoxin toxicity leads to inflammation and septic shock.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      Bacteria or bacterial products, such as endotoxin from gram-negative bacteria, activate host responses during infectious and inflammatory processes.
      <br/>
      Endotoxin, also known as lipopolysaccharide (LPS) for its chemical structure consisting of a polysaccharide part and a hydrophobic lipid part, can induce a wide variety of different types of cells including macrophages, polymorphonuclear leukocytes, and endothelial cells to release a number of inflammatory mediators, such as prostaglandins or cytokines.
      <br/>
      In localized infections, endotoxin is largely restricted to inflammatory sites, enhancing host defense.
      <br/>
      However, if the infection is not brought under control, endotoxin and/or inflammatory mediators may reach the circulation, predisposing the microvasculature to thrombosis and can lead to systemic endotoxemia or sepsis and associated complications including septic shock, adult respiratory distress syndrome, and multiorgan failure.
    </p>
    <p num="11">
      Septic or endotoxin shock is an acute and serious cardiovascular collapse resulting from the systemic response to a bacterial infection.
      <br/>
      It is manifested by hypotension, a reduced response to vasoconstrictors, generalized tissue damage and multi-organ failure.
      <br/>
      It is the most common cause of death in the intensive-care unit; there are about 400,000 cases of septicemia per year in the United States with mortality rates between 25% and 50%.
      <br/>
      The steadily increasing incidence of septic shock stems from an increasing proportion of elderly in the population, increasing frequency of invasive surgical procedures, extensive use of immunosuppressive and chemotherapeutic agents, and increasing prevalence of chronic debilitating conditions.
      <br/>
      Because the mechanisms underlying sepsis and septic shock are not yet known, therapeutic interventions have been largely ineffective.
      <br/>
      At present, there is no effective treatment for septic shock.
    </p>
    <p num="12">
      Phospholipase A2 (PLA2) is an enzyme which plays a role in a pathway which can lead to inflammation.
      <br/>
      Inflammation in the lung is caused by inflammatory mediators released by cells, including histamine, cytotoxins (tumor necrosis factor alpha, interleukin-1, etc), and leukotrienes.
      <br/>
      These mediators cause blood vessels to leak and lung tissues to swell, and act to contract the smooth muscles of the airways to cause bronchial constriction.
      <br/>
      The inflammation response, originally designed to combat threats, is in itself the mediator of substantial tissue damage.
      <br/>
      Patients with conditions such as asthma, cystic fibrosis, and bronchopulmonary dysplasia experience chronic inflammation of the lung.
    </p>
    <p num="13">
      Phospholipase A2 is an important enzyme in a synthetic pathway which can lead to the formation of arachidonic acid.
      <br/>
      Arachidonic acid in turn may be acted upon by cyclooxygenase to form prostaglandins, by lipooxygenase to form leukotrienes, and by monooxygenase to form epoxides all which can cause inflammation.
    </p>
    <p num="14">
      Compounds that interfere with this pathway can be useful in preventing inflammation.
      <br/>
      For example, prostaglandin inhibitors are widely known and used for inflammation, and a lipooxygenase inhibitor to prevent formation of leukotrienes has recently come on the market for treatment of asthma.
    </p>
    <p num="15">
      It would be advantageous to have methods of inhibiting PLA2 activity and suppressing the activity of PLA2 simulators, thereby preventing or treating inflammation, especially that which accompanies lung diseases, including cystic fibrosis (CF) and bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD).
      <br/>
      It also would be advantageous to have a method of evaluating agents that might be effective to suppress the activity of PLA2 simulators in a patient's body fluid.
    </p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="16">It is an object of the present invention to disclose novel pharmaceutical compositions containing annexins and methods of inhibiting PLA2 or suppressing the activity of PLA2 simulators which can be used in treating lung inflammation and lung disease in patients and in methods for treating patients with endotoxin shock.</p>
    <p num="17">I have discovered a method of inhibiting the effects of PLA2 and suppressing the activity of PLA2 simulators in the body fluid of an animal which comprises bringing a safe amount of Annexin I, Annexin VIII or a mixture thereof into contact with an animal fluid containing phospholipase A2 (PLA2) or a PLA2 stimulator which amount is effective to inhibit the PLA2 activity and suppress the activity of the PLA2 simulators in the body fluid.</p>
    <p num="18">In a preferred embodiment of the method, the Annexin I or Annexin VIII, or a mixture thereof, is brought into contact with the bronchoaleveolar (BAL) fluid of a patient by inhalation of a pharmaceutical composition containing Annexin I, Annexin VIII or a mixture thereof.</p>
    <p num="19">
      The pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention comprise a member selected from Annexin I, Annexin VIII, and mixtures of those polypeptides, in combination with a pharmaceutical diluent(s) and/or an excipient(s).
      <br/>
      The preferred compositions also contain a source of calcium ions (Ca+2).
      <br/>
      Especially preferred are compositions which are suitable for instillation into the bronchial system of an animal.
    </p>
    <p num="20">In another embodiment of the method of the invention which is useful in determining if a candidate anti-inflammatory agent can inhibit the stimulation of the activity of a PLA2 stimulator in a body fluid, the agent is added to a body fluid known to contain such a stimulator and the agent's inhibitory activity determined by measuring the amount of PLA2 produced.</p>
    <p num="21">These and other objects of the invention will be apparent from the description and examples herein.</p>
    <heading>DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading>
    <p num="22">
      The preferred pharmaceutical compositions are those which contain as the active ingredient Annexin VIII, 33 kDa(PLBP).
      <br/>
      The reason that the Annexin VIII is preferred is that it is as active as Annexin I and it is less likely to be broken down into cytotoxic products by enzymes.
    </p>
    <p num="23">
      In addition to Annexin VIII, the preferred compositions for instillation into the airway of an animal will contain a source of calcium ions and a surfactant.
      <br/>
      The compositions also may contain pharmaceutical diluents and excipients which are customary for aerosols or other dosage forms for instillation of drugs into the airways of animals.
    </p>
    <p num="24">
      In the preferred method of inhibiting the activity of PLA2 and suppressing the activity of a PLA2 stimulator in a body fluid of a patient the preferred composition is instilled directly into the patient's lungs.
      <br/>
      In an alternative method, lung fluid is collected from a patient in whom it is desired to inhibit PLA2 activity or suppress the activity of a PLA2 stimulator, the Annexin I, Annexin VIII or a mixture thereof is added to the lung fluid and the lung fluid is returned to the patient.
    </p>
    <p num="25">The practice of the present invention will be further understood by the description of the experimental work that follows.</p>
    <heading>EXPERIMENTAL WORK</heading>

      <br/>
      Degradation of Annexin I in Lung Disease
    </p>
    <p num="27">
      A study was conducted to determine whether degradation of Annexin I occurs in BAL fluid of patients with lung disease, such as cystic fibrosis (CF) and bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD).
      <br/>
      The lung disease of CF is characterized by bacterial infection and inflammation.
      <br/>
      As a result, the patient's mucus contains high amounts of proteases, particularly, the elastase from the neutrophils and from the organism Pseudomonas aeruginosa that colonized the respiratory tract of the CF patients.
      <br/>
      It was speculated that these proteases may break down proteins, including annexins, in the bronchi and bronchiole.
      <br/>
      The lung disease of premature infant BPD is characterized by oxyradical-mediated acute lung inflammation and injury.
      <br/>
      These premature infants survived respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) after intensive care but suffered oxygen toxicity and developed bronchopulmonary dysplasia, a chronic lung disease.
      <br/>
      The BAL fluid of these patients also contained a high level of proteases derived from neutrophils in addition to the oxyradical substances.
      <br/>
      In this study, rabbit lung Annexin I, which is equivalent to human Annexin I, was used and specific antibodies were raised against rabbit lung Annexin I to analyze the distribution of Annexin I in BAL fluid from CF patients and BPD patients and to determine the changes in Annexin I structure and functional activity.
    </p>
    <p num="28">
      Isolation of lung annexins.
      <br/>
      Rabbit lung Annexin I was isolated from the cytosolic fraction of the lungs from two adult rabbits by known techniques.
      <br/>
      Human lung Annexin I was isolated from post-mortem lung tissue.

      Isolation of lung annexins and preparation of anti-Annexin I antiserum.
      <br/>
      The two rabbit lung calcium-dependent phospholipid-binding proteins, Annexin I or 36 kDa(PLBP) and Annexin VIII or 33 kDa(PLBP), were isolated from cytosolic fraction of the lungs from adult rabbit by known techniques (Tsao FHC, Biochimica et Biophysica Acta. 1045 (1990) 29-39, incorporated by reference.)

    <p num="30">Isolation of Lung-soluble Fraction</p>
    <p num="31">
      An adult New Zealand white rabbit was anaesthetized with an intravenous sodium pentobarbital solution (20 mg pentobarbital and 1000 units heparin per kg body weight).
      <br/>
      Tracheostomy was performed and the lung was lavaged with 20 ml saline three times.
      <br/>
      The trachea was then connected to a respiratory pump (10 ml/stroke, 25 strokes/min).
      <br/>
      The thorax was opened and the animal was exsanguinated.
      <br/>
      The lungs were perfused in situ with saline via the pulmonary artery, removed from the carcass and dissected from nonlung tissue.
      <br/>
      Lung tissue was minced and homogenized in volumes of 0.01 M Tris-HCl/0.33 M sucrose buffer (pH 7.4) containing 5 mM 2-mercaptoethanol and 1 mM EDTA in a Brinkmann Model PT 10/35 homogenizer (Brinkmann Instruments, Westbury, N.Y.).
      <br/>
      In some studies with buffer, and in buffers used in the protein isolation described later, the buffers contained 0.1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and pepstatin A (10  MU g/ml) (Sigma) to inhibit any proteolytic activity.
      <br/>
      The soluble (cytosolic) fraction was obtained from the supernatant of 105,000 * g centrifugation of the post-mitochondria fraction as described earlier �F. H. C. Tsao, Biochim.
      <br/>
      Biophys. Acta 575:234-243, 1979�. The isolated soluble fraction was stored at -20 (degree)  C. before use.

      Lung-soluble fraction obtained from two adult rabbit lungs was titrated to pH 5.5 on ice followed by centrifugation at 4 (degree)  C. at 6600 * g with a Beckman Model L centrifuge (Beckman Instruments, Palo Alto, Calif.) for 10 minutes.
      <br/>
      The pellets were discarded.
      <br/>
      The supernatant was titrated to pH 7.4 followed by the addition of ammonium sulfate crystals with gentle stirring on ice.
      <br/>
      The final concentration of ammonium sulfate in the solution was 70%.
      <br/>
      The precipitated proteins were pelleted by centrifuging the mixture at 15,000 * g at 4 (degree)  C. for 20 minutes.
      <br/>
      The supernatant was discarded.
      <br/>
      The pellets were suspended in about 10 ml 0.01 M Tris-HCl buffer containing 5 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 1 mM EDTA and 0.15 M NaCl at pH 7.4 (buffer A).

    <p num="34">SEPHADEX G-100 Column Chromatography</p>
    <p num="35">
      Half of the protein solution obtained from ammonium sulfate precipitation was applied to a SEPHADEX G-100 column (2.6 * 55 cm) preequilibrated with buffer A. The proteins were eluted with 3.5 ml per tube of buffer A at a flow rate of 12 ml per hour.
      <br/>
      The protein content of the eluted fractions was estimated from an absorbance at 280 nm with a Gilford Model 252 photometer (Gilford, Oberlin, Ohio) adapted with a Beckman DU monochromator.
      <br/>

      Western blot analysis of annexins in human BAL fluid.
      <br/>
      With the use of 100  MU g total BAL fluid proteins, Annexin I was detected in BAL fluid samples from normal volunteers by Western blot.
      <br/>
      Annexin I in one of the 10 normal volunteer BAL samples was only barely detected.

      Small amounts of an immunoreacted protein with molecular weight around 33 kDa also was observed in some of the samples.

      This 33 kDa protein did not bind with phospholipid and was determined to be the 33 kDa(BP) breakdown product of Annexin I. It appeared that the BAL fluid samples of patients with interstitial lung disease which had about 20% neutrophil among total BAL fluid cells also contained small amounts of the 33 kDa(BP).
      <br/>
      In contrast, in 20 BAL fluid samples from CF patients, 17 samples had no Annexin I. In 11 of the 17 samples with no Annexin I, the only immunoreactive protein was the 33 kDa(BP).

      The incubation of purified rabbit lung Annexin I (1  MU g) with four different CF BAL fluid samples (20  MU g protein) yielded 33 kDa(BP) which was immuno-recognized by the antibody.
      <br/>
      The 33 kDa(BP) was solely derived from substrate of rabbit lung Annexin I since the four CF BAL samples employed in the tests contained only 20  MU g of total proteins in which little Annexin I and 33 kDa(BP) could be detected.
      <br/>
      Under the reaction conditions, three BAL fluid samples converted most of the Annexin I to the 33 kDa(BP), whereas one BAL fluid sample degraded less Annexin I to the 33 kDa(BP).
      <br/>

      In the experimental work described Annexin I was present in all the BAL fluid samples from normal volunteers.
      <br/>
      The finding of Annexin I in BAL fluid from normal volunteers was consistent with the previous reports that Annexin I was present in lung lavage fluid from animals and humans.
      <br/>
      Little degradation of Annexin I was observed in the BAL fluid samples from normal volunteers.
      <br/>
      However, degradation of Annexin I appeared to be common in all the BAL fluid samples from CF patients.
      <br/>
      In most of the CF samples, Annexin I was completely degraded to 33 kDa(BP).
      <br/>
      Only a few CF samples contained any Annexin I, but even those samples also had the 33 kDa(BP) protein.
      <br/>
      Although Annexin I was present in all the BAL fluid samples from patients with interstitial lung diseases, some of the samples also contained the 33 kDa(BP) protein.
    </p>
    <p num="50">
      It is interesting to note that among the BAL fluid samples from patients with interstitial lung diseases, the appearance of 33 kDa(BP) was associated closely with relatively higher percentage of neutrophils in these samples.
      <br/>
      Since all the BAL fluid samples from CF patients contained abundant neutrophils, it was concluded that the degradation of Annexin I to the 33 kDa(BP) was associated with neutrophils.
      <br/>
      Likely, the higher the neutrophil elastase in the BAL fluid, the more degradation of Annexin I took place.
      <br/>
      For those CF BAL fluid samples which had low elastase activity, Annexin I was present in the BAL fluid.
      <br/>
      Thus, the breakdown of Annexin I in BAL fluid was associated closely with the degree of lung inflammation in the CF patients.
    </p>
    <p num="51">
      The proteolytic activity in the CF patients' BAL fluid further was confirmed by the degradation of purified rabbit lung Annexin I incubated in reaction mixtures containing CF BAL fluid.
      <br/>
      The breakdown product 33 kDa(BP) of rabbit lung Annexin I catalyzed by CF BAL fluid structurally was nearly identical to the human lung Annexin I breakdown product in the CF BAL fluid samples, i.e., same molecular weight and pI between 8.5-9 0 (slashed zero)  The Annexin I breakdown product 33 kDa(BP) protein had a pI value which was distinct from Annexin VIII, 33 kDa(PLBP), which was an acidic pI of 5.5. Both rabbit lung Annexin I and Annexin VIII aggregated negatively charged vesicles in a calcium-dependent manner, an important annexin functional activity.
      <br/>
      The degradation of rabbit lung Annexin I catalyzed by CF BAL fluid markedly reduced the Annexin I functional activity, in other words, the Annexin I breakdown product 33 kDa(BP) was functionally inactive in vesicle aggregation.
    </p>
    <p num="52">
      Although previous studies suggested that the degradation of Annexin I in BAL fluid from patients with lung diseases was due to the elastase hydrolytic activity, we found that the cleavage site of Annexin I was at the N-terminus Val-36, an elastase substrate specific cleavage site.
      <br/>
      Also the cleavage site of Annexin I was determined with rabbit lung Annexin I which was used as the substrate.
      <br/>
      Both rabbit lung Annexin I and human lung Annexin I have nearly identical amino acid sequences in this region.
      <br/>
      It also was determined that human lung Annexin I could be cleaved at Ser-37.
      <br/>
      This suggested that degradation of Annexin I could occur at more than one position at the N-terminus.
      <br/>
      It has been shown that the N-terminus of Annexin I can be cleaved at several positions by different proteases, such as cathepsin D, calpain or plasmin, which have been demonstrated to cleave human annexin I at Trp-12, Lys-26 or Lys-29, respectively.
      <br/>
      The N-terminus truncated Annexin I has been shown to either increase or decrease the binding affinity with calcium and phospholipid, depending on the N-terminus-truncated position.
      <br/>
      It has been demonstrated that the removal of 36 amino acids at the N-terminus of Annexin I by the proteases in CF patients' BAL fluid diminished the Annexin I functional activity in vesicle aggregation and fusion, indicating that the N-terminus is required for Annexin I functional activity.
    </p>
    <p num="53">
      The source(s) of Annexin I in BAL fluid are not known with certainty.
      <br/>
      It has been found that alveolar epithelial type II cells are rich in Annexin I. Though the role of Annexin I in the type II cell is not clear, it might be associated with lung surfactant and possibly secreted by type II cells.
      <br/>
      The pulmonary surfactant appears not only to be essential to stabilize alveoli from collapse at the lowest volume during expiration, it also may play an important role in mucociliary clearance in the respiratory tract.
      <br/>
      The abnormal surfactant phospholipid composition in the mucus of CF patients not only may contribute to the abnormal mucociliary transport, but it also may cause the collapse of terminal airways.
      <br/>
      The degradation of Annexin I in the BAL fluid in CF patients was not only a sensitive indicator of the high levels of neutrophils and elastase in the inflammatory lung, it also was an indication of the decreased anti-inflammatory activity due to the reduction of the levels of Annexin I in the lungs of these patients.
      <br/>
      Similarly, Annexin I in the BAL fluid samples from five BPD patients was all degraded to 33 kDa(BP).
      <br/>
      These patients had acute lung inflammation and injury.

    <p num="54">From the foregoing, it was apparent that administering Annexin I, Annexin VIII, or mixtures thereof to patients could be beneficial to such patients.</p>

      <br/>
      Among the 15 amino acids, Thr-41 in human Annexin I sequence was replaced with Phe in the 33 kDa(BP) protein and Asp-47 in human Annexin I sequence could not be determined for the 33 kDa(BP) protein.

    <p num="58">
      The results of Western blot also showed that the immunoreacted Annexin I in human BAL fluid had the same apparent molecular weight as rabbit lung Annexin I. The molecular weight of human Annexin I calculated from amino acid sequence deduced from cDNA is 38712.16. Recently, the rabbit Annexin I cDNA was cloned and sequenced; the deduced protein sequence has 346 amino acids with a calculated molecular weight of 38831.28, similar to the Annexin I of human, rat, mouse and guinea pig.
      <br/>
      The apparent molecular weight of rabbit lung Annexin I was 36 kDa as vigorously examined by SDS gel.
      <br/>
      The observed molecular weights of human Annexin I also have been reported to be around 35-37 kDa.
      <br/>
      The difference in molecular weights between the calculated and experimentally determined might be the result of protein charge effects on protein migration on SDS gel due to some post-translational modifications.
      <br/>
      To be consistent with the observed molecular weight, lung Annexin I is referred to as 36 kDa(PLBP) protein since Annexin I was analyzed mostly by SDS-PAGE and Western blot.

      The body temperatures of the rabbits returned to normal levels 6 and 7 hours after injection.

      The injection of a mixture of LPS-Annexin I-calcium delayed the effects of endotoxin more than 2 hours and reduced the degree of response.
      <br/>
      The rabbits that received Annexin I eventually developed fever 4 hours later after injection.
      <br/>
      This is probably due to only one level of Annexin I being tested versus a large dose of endotoxin and the removal or degradation of Annexin I in the airway and the residual endotoxin causing infection.

      The difference between the Control and the average of the Endotoxin and Endotoxin+Annexin I groups for all times 3 hours and after was -1.97 degrees F. (p-value&lt;0.001) while the difference for these times between the Endotoxin and Endotoxin+Annexin was 0.85 degrees F. (p-value 0.014).

      <br/>
      The quantity of Annexin I in the airway is important in protecting against endotoxin.

    <p num="69">
      The Annexin I anti-endotoxin activity is probably due to Annexin I binding to the lipid-A moiety of LPS so the LPS can no longer bind to the host cell membrane to trigger cellular reactions that release infectious mediators.

      Annexin I may also bind to the epithelial cell surfaces to prevent LPS from anchoring on the cell membrane to initiate cellular reactions.

    <p num="78">
      In addition, to using the analysis of the amount of Annexin I/33 kDa(BP) in amniotic fluid as a means to predict premature delivery, the administration of Annexin I and/or Annexin VIII into the amniotic fluid will help to prevent the infections, effects of cytotoxins and prostaglandins which are the major causes of premature delivery.
      <br/>
      The mechanism of the infection in amniotic fluid is similar to that in the airway.

    <p num="79">VI. Inhibition of PLA2 and Suppression of PLA2 Stimulation</p>
    <p num="80">
      PLA2 plays a pivotal role in the pathway which leads to the production of inflammatory lipid mediators.
      <br/>
      I have found that there are PLA2 stimulators that can be present in the BAL fluids of patients with lung disease which can stimulate the activity of PLA2.
      <br/>
      I have also discovered that Annexin I, Annexin VIII or mixtures thereof can inhibit both PLA2 activity and suppress the activity of PLA2 stimulators in the BAL fluids of patients with lung disease.
      <br/>
      The PLA2 stimulator activity in the BAL fluid was measured by the augmentation of PLA2 activity on phospholipid hydrolysis.
      <br/>
      Annexin I or Annexin VIII was introduced into BAL fluids and found to inhibit the activities of both PLA2 and the PLA2 stimulator.
      <br/>
      The BAL fluids used in this study were from patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) or bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) and were obtained from the University of Wisconsin Medical School.
      <br/>
      The PLA2 and phospholipids employed were commercially available.
      <br/>
      The Annexins I and VIII were isolated from rabbit lungs by the inventor.
    </p>
    <p num="81">
      I first looked at bronchoalveolar lavage fluids (BAL) of patients with cystic fibrosis, and was surprised to find no increase in PLA2 activity.
      <br/>
      However, when I added BAL from a cystic fibrosis patient to a preparation of porcine pancreatic PLA2 in a test tube, I saw a large increase in activity of PLA2.
      <br/>
      This stimulatory activity was not destroyed by incubating the BAL for one hour at 37 (degree)  C., nor was it destroyed by boiling for 5 minutes.
      <br/>
      No such stimulator activity was present in the BAL from normal volunteers.
      <br/>
      The following assay for PLA2 activity was used.
    </p>
    <p num="82">Phospholipase A2 Assay</p>
    <p num="83">
      A reaction mixture in 0.1 ml of 0.01 M Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.4) contained 10 MM CaCl2, 5 nmol unilamellar liposomes made of dioleoyl phosphatidylcholine (PC) and phosphatidylglycerol (PG) (50%-50%, by wt) labeled with L- ALPHA -�1-14 C�dioleoyl PC, 25-100  MU g of CF BAL fluid proteins, 10  MU g of either rabbit lung Annexin I or Annexin VIII, and 0.5  MU g of porcine pancreatic phospholipase A2.
      <br/>
      In the control reaction mixture, either CF BAL fluid, Annexin, or both CF BAL fluid and Annexin were omitted.
      <br/>
      The reaction was carried out at room temperature for 20 seconds and stopped by adding 2 ml of chloroform:methanol (1:2 vol) followed by addition of 0.4 ml water and 10  MU l of egg PC (20 nmol) which was used as carrier.
      <br/>
      The mixture was stirred, lipids were extracted by adding additional 0.6 ml water and 0.6 ml chloroform.
      <br/>
      PC was isolated by the methods of silica gel thin-layer chromatography (TLC).
      <br/>
      Lipids on the TLC plate were visualized by exposure of the TLC plate in an iodine tank.
      <br/>
      The PC spot on the plate was scrapped into a scintillation vial, radioactivity determined by a scintillation counter.
      <br/>
      Phospholipase A2 activity was expressed as either decrease in PC radioactivity or increase in fatty acid or lysoPC radioactivity as described previously (Tsao et al., BBA 1081: 141-150, 1991).
      <br/>
      In additional studies CF BAL fluids were incubated in boiling water for 4 minutes followed by centrifugation at 10,000 rpm for 10 minutes prior to its addition to the phospholipase A2 reaction mixture.
    </p>
    <p num="84">
      The above procedure was used to identify a novel PLA2 stimulating factor (PLA2 stimulator) in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluids from patients with cystic fibrosis (CF).
      <br/>
      The PLA2 stimulator activity was measured by the level of increase in porcine pancreatic PLA2 activity on hydrolysis of 14 C-labeled dioleoyl phosphatidylcholine (PC) in the presence of CF BAL fluid.
      <br/>
      The CF BAL fluid stimulated PLA2 activity in a BAL fluid dose-dependent manner; the stimulation reached 2-fold by 50  MU g of total proteins in the fluid and was maintained at optimal levels with the BAL fluids containing 100  MU g of proteins.
      <br/>
      The CF BAL fluid itself had no measurable PLA2 activity.
      <br/>
      Bronchoalveolar lavage fluids from normal volunteers had no stimulation on PLA2 activity.
      <br/>
      The PLA2 stimulation activity in the CF BAL fluid was stable after the fluid was heated in boiling water for 4 min, and the activity was recovered in the 10,000 rpm supernatant of the heated BAL fluid.
      <br/>
      The PLA2 and PLA2 stimulator activities were markedly inhibited by Annexins I and Annexin VIII isolated from rabbit lung.
      <br/>
      The results show that BAL fluids from patients with CF contained PLA2 stimulator(s), and both the PLA2 and PLA2 stimulator activities could be inhibited by lung Annexins I and VIII.
      <br/>
      These results support the conclusion that a PLA2 stimulator is a critical factor involved in inducing inflammation and that Annexins I and VIII may have a role in suppressing the PLA2 -mediated inflammation.
    </p>
    <p num="85">
      The discovery that both PLA2 activity can be inhibited and the PLA2 stimulatory activity of simulators can be suppressed by adding Annexin I or Annexin VIII to a body fluid, such as lung fluid, is an important one.
      <br/>
      Annexins I and VIII are native lung proteins present in the airway that play a role in host defense.
    </p>
    <p num="86">
      In further experiments, I found that the BAL from patients with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) also contained PLA2 simulators for the activity of PLA2 and that the breakdown products of Annexin I, which were in themselves cytotoxic, were ineffective at inhibiting PLA2 or PLA2 stimulator activity.
      <br/>
      I previously found that the addition of Annexins I and VIII prevented a cytotoxicity seen from the BAL from CF and BPD patients.
      <br/>
      This evidence supports the conclusion that bringing Annexin I, Annexin VIII or a mixture thereof into contact with lung fluid of a patient can inhibit both PLA2 activity and any PLA2 stimulator activity and thereby interrupt the pathway involving PLA2 that leads to inflammation.
    </p>
    <p num="87">The surprising discovery of the PLA2 stimulator activity in the BAL of patients with lung disease provides a better understanding of the mechanisms of PLA2 -mediated inflammation making it possible to develop new drugs to inhibit this activity.</p>
    <p num="88">
      The embodiment of the method of the present invention by which a candidate anti-inflammatory agent can be tested to determine if it will inhibit the stimulation of the activity of PLA2 by natural PLA2 simulators known to be present in a body fluid comprises adding the candidate agent to the body fluid and after a reasonable time (e.g., 20 seconds) testing the body fluid to see if any PLA2 activity has been stimulated.
      <br/>
      The results obtained may be compared to the results obtained in a control sample of the body fluid subjected to the same conditions.

      As previously stated, the preferred pharmaceutical compositions, in addition to Annexin I, Annexin VIII, or mixtures thereof, will contain a source of calcium ions.
      <br/>
      When intended for instillation into the lungs of an animal, they also will contain a surfactant or surface active agent.
    </p>
    <p num="90">
      The Annexin I and Annexin VIII are natural proteins in the airway.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the side effects and toxicities of these proteins are minimal.
      <br/>
      Both human Annexin I and Annexin VIII can be synthesized or produced by genetic engineering techniques.
    </p>
    <p num="91">
      The preferred source of calcium ions is a soluble calcium salt, such as calcium chloride.
      <br/>
      The amount of calcium ions in the compositions will depend upon the amount of active ingredient.
      <br/>
      The calcium ion concentration can range from zero where enough endogenous calcium is present to about 1 mM or more.
    </p>
    <p num="92">
      A preferred surfactant would be one that is known to be beneficial in the treatment of lung disease, such as that sold under the trademark SURVANTA by Ross Laboratories.
      <br/>
      Suitable surface active agents include both non-fluorinated surfactants and fluorinated surfactants known in the art and disclosed, for example, in British Patent Nos. 837465 and 994734 and U.S. Pat. No. 4,352,789.

    <p num="93">Examples of other surfactants include:</p>

    <p num="95">
      The surfactants or surface active agents are generally present in amounts not exceeding 5 percent by weight of the total formulation.
      <br/>
      They will usually be present in the weight ratio 1:100 to 10:1 surface active agent: active ingredient, but the surface active agent may exceed this weight ratio in cases where the active ingredient concentration in the formulation is very low.
    </p>
    <p num="96">
      The particle size of the active ingredients should desirably be no greater than 100 microns diameter.
      <br/>
      Preferably, the particle size of a finely-divided solid powder should for physiological reasons be less than 25 microns and preferably less than about 10 microns in diameter.
      <br/>
      The particle size for inhalation therapy should preferably be in the range 0.5 to 10 microns.
    </p>
    <p num="97">
      The concentration of the active ingredient depends upon the desired dosage, but it is generally in the range 0.01 to 5% by weight.
      <br/>
      The dosage will usually be selected to bring the levels of the Annexin I or Annexin VIII at least up to the levels of those polypeptides found in the lung or amniotic fluid of normal animals.
      <br/>
      It should be noted, however, that the dosage can be adjusted to any level which is tolerated without substantial adverse effect by the patient.
      <br/>
      Thus, dosages of from 0.05  MU g/kg of the animal's body weight up to 500 mg/kg or higher could be used if such high levels are not toxic and produce the desirable result in the patient.
      <br/>
      The availability of an animal model for cystic fibrosis, mice homozygous for a disrupted CFTR gene, allows for the testing of compositions containing the active ingredients in animals without undue experimentation.
    </p>
    <p num="98">
      A representative composition for instillation into the lungs of animal would contain in 1 ml. about 0.02 mg of Annexin I, Annexin VIII, or a mixture thereof; 0.5 mg of calcium (5 mM) and 0.4 mg of surfactant phospholipids.
      <br/>
      It could also contain other diluents and ingredients and it would be packaged in an aerosol form not requiring a CFC propellant.
      <br/>
      A composition for addition to amniotic fluid would not contain the surfactant.
    </p>
    <p num="99">From the foregoing, it will be apparent to those skilled in the art that my discovery that the addition of Annexin I, Annexin VIII or mixtures thereof to body fluids will inhibit PLA2 activity and PLA2 stimulator activity has wide and broad clinical applications for the treatment of inflammation in a wide variety of patients, such as children and adults with cystic fibrosis, HIV/AIDS immune suppressed patients, neutropenic, post-operative, bed ridden and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients, as well as, infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia and patients with septic shock or patients who have high risk pregnancies.</p>
