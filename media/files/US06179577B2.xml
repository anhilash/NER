      <br/>
      An assembly (10) for pumping fuel from a fuel source to an engine combusting the fuel comprises a housing (14), and a fuel pump (12) mounted in the housing.
      <br/>
      One end (18) of the housing defines a fuel inlet (20a, 20b) for the pump.
      <br/>
      A fuel filter (16) is mounted externally of the housing and fuel drawn into the fuel pump flows through the filter.
      <br/>
      A valve member (22) is fitted onto the end of the housing adjacent the fuel inlet for opening and closing the fuel inlet.
      <br/>
      The valve member is movable by the fuel filter during its installation to move the valve member to a position at which the fuel inlet is open.
      <br/>
      Removal of the filter causes the valve member to be moved to a position blocking the fuel inlet.
      <br/>
      A heater (40a, 40b) is carried on the valve member and is installed adjacent the fuel inlet.
      <br/>
      The heater heats fuel flowing into the fuel inlet to a predetermined temperature as the fuel is drawn into the fuel pump.
      <br/>
      A thermal switch (62) also carried on the valve member controls power to the heater to activate the heater when the fuel temperature is below the predetermined temperature.

    <p num="2">Not applicable.</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="3">This invention relates to electric fuel pumps, and more particularly, to an electric fuel pump and fuel filter assembly having a heater located at an inlet to the pump to heat fuel drawn through the filter into the pump if the fuel temperature is less than a predetermined value.</p>
    <p num="4">
      In automotive and marine applications, a vehicle or boat is exposed to a wide range of temperature conditions.
      <br/>
      An engine used to power the vehicle or boat is supplied fuel from a tank or reservoir which typically is not insulated so fuel residing in the tank is at close to ambient temperature.
      <br/>
      If the temperature is warm or hot, this can create certain problems, for example, vapor lock.
      <br/>
      The invention set forth in this application is directed to solving fuel delivery problems when the temperature is cool or cold.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      Fuel delivery systems typically employ an electric fuel pump for drawing fuel from the tank or reservoir and delivering it, under pressure, to the engine.
      <br/>
      A fuel filter is often interposed in a fuel intake path to the pump to remove unwanted materials (dirt, dust, and debris) from the fuel.
      <br/>
      One type of fuel filter made by the Parker Hannifin Company is designed so that when a filter is installed, the inlet to the fuel filter is unblocked so fuel is drawn through the filter into the pump.
      <br/>
      If the filter is removed, the fuel inlet is blocked so no fuel can be drawn into the pump.
      <br/>
      The present invention is usable with this type of filter to provide a means of heating the fuel, when the filter is in place, so the fuel pumped to the engine is at a desired temperature.
    </p>
    <heading>BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="11">
      Referring to the drawings, a fuel pump assembly for pumping fuel from a source (not shown) to an engine (also not shown) combusting the fuel is indicated generally 10 in FIG. 1.
      <br/>
      The assembly includes a fuel pump 12 (see FIG. 2) installed in a housing 14, and a fuel filter 16 mounted at a fuel inlet end 18 of the pump.
      <br/>
      The fuel inlet is defined by the pump housing.
      <br/>
      As shown in FIG. 1, fuel filter 16, which is commercially available from the Parker Hannifin Company is mounted externally of the housing.
      <br/>
      Fuel drawn into the fuel pump flows through the filter as indicated by the arrows.
    </p>
    <p num="12">
      As shown in FIGS. 1-3, the fuel pump has a pair of opposed fuel inlets 20a, 20b.
      <br/>
      A valve member indicated generally 22 is installed on the outside of the housing, at the fuel inlet end 18, for opening and closing these inlets.
      <br/>
      Valve member 22 includes an annular flange 24 which extends about end 18 and a plate 26 integrally formed with the flange and extending outwardly from the side of end 18.
      <br/>
      A bias spring 28 has one end seated against plate 26 and the other end seated against an underside 30 of housing 14.
      <br/>
      The spring urges the valve member downwardly so flange 24 covers the fuel inlets 20a, 20b and prevents fuel from flowing to pump 12.
      <br/>
      As further shown in FIG. 1, when filter 16 is installed, an annular tip end 32 of the filter pushes against an underside of plate 26 to move the valve member against the force of spring 28 and open fuel inlets 20a, 20b.
      <br/>
      Typically, so long as the fuel filter is in place, the fuel inlets remain open.
      <br/>
      When the filter is removed, the valve member 22 is moved by the force of the spring to shut off the inlets.
    </p>
    <p num="13">
      In accordance with the present invention, a heater 40 is carried on valve member 22 and is installed on the valve member so to be adjacent a fuel inlet 20.
      <br/>
      Since assembly 10 includes two fuel inlets, two heaters 40a, 40b are carried on the valve member; each heater being located adjacent one of the fuel inlets 20a, 20b.
      <br/>
      When energized, the heaters heat fuel flowing into a respective fuel inlet to a predetermined temperature.
      <br/>
      This is done to improve the efficiency of the operation of the fuel pump and delivery of fuel to the engine.
      <br/>
      As shown in FIGS. 5A and 5B, the heaters 40 are PTC type heaters having a wafer shape.
      <br/>
      PTC heaters are known in the art and their operation will not be described.
    </p>
    <p num="14">
      Referring to FIGS. 3, 4, and 6, one method of installing the heaters so they can be carried by valve member 22 is shown.
      <br/>
      The wafers are mounted on the top of plate 26, as viewed in the drawings, so to be adjacent the respective fuel inlets in housing 14.
      <br/>
      A second plate 42 fits over the heaters so to sandwich them between the two plates.
      <br/>
      Plate 42 is an annular plate whose outer diameter corresponds to that of plate 26.
      <br/>
      The inner diameter of the plate is such that when in place, a portion of the wafer is exposed.
      <br/>
      This allows an electrical lead 44 to be routed to one of the heaters, heater 40a as shown in the drawings, from a power source.
      <br/>
      An insulation material 46 is sandwiched between plates 26 and 42 in the space between the heaters as shown in FIG. 3.
      <br/>
      Alternately, as shown in FIGS. 7A and 7B, openings 50 are formed in plate 26.
      <br/>
      The diameters of the openings correspond to those of the heater 40 wafers.
      <br/>
      These recesses or pockets accommodate the heaters to position them adjacent the respective fuel inlets.
    </p>
    <p num="15">
      Referring to FIG. 8, a schematic of a heater circuit employing heaters 40a, 40b includes a power source (not shown) which supplies +12 VDC to fuel pump 12 and, in parallel, to the heaters.
      <br/>
      As further shown, the heaters are connected in series by an electrical lead 48 which extends between plates 26 and 42.
      <br/>
      Heater 40b is connected to the ground side of the power source by an electrical lead 51 which extends between the heater and an electrical terminal 52 carried on flange 24 of valve member 22 through an opening 55 in the sidewall of inlet end 18.
      <br/>
      This terminal 52 comprises a sliding contact since it moves with the valve member as the valve member moves.
      <br/>
      A ground wire 56 extends from terminal 52 to the return side of the power source.
    </p>
    <p num="16">
      The heaters are, in turn, series connected with a thermal switch 62.
      <br/>
      Switch 62 is shown in FIG. 4 as being mounted outside inlet end 18 of housing 14 so to be in contact with fuel flowing through filter 16 to the pump inlets 20a, 20b.
      <br/>
      For this purpose, the thermal switch is mounted in any convenient manner to plate 26 of the valve member; for example, midway about the plate between the heaters.
      <br/>
      An electrical lead 64 passes through an opening 66 formed in a sidewall of inlet end 18 of the housing for connecting the power source to the thermal switch.
      <br/>
      The circuit path from the power source to the heaters is routed through the switch.
      <br/>
      Switch 62 is set to open when the temperature of the fuel rises above a predetermined temperature which is, for example, 60 (degree)  F. (16 (degree)  C.).
      <br/>
      Accordingly, when the pump is in operation, fuel flowing through filter 16 into housing 18 flows over the thermal switch.
      <br/>
      So long as the fuel temperature is less than the predetermined value, the switch remains closed and the heaters are activated.
      <br/>
      When the fuel temperature reaches or exceeds the thermal switch setting, the switch opens interrupting the circuit path to the heaters, deactivating them.
    </p>
    <p num="17">
      In addition to the foregoing elements of assembly 10, the assembly further includes a water sensor indicated generally 70 in the drawings.
      <br/>
      Sensor 70 first includes an electrical contact 72 which is an elongate terminal that is attached to a base 74 of housing 18 and outwardly from the housing along a longitudinal axis of the housing.
      <br/>
      Sensor 70 includes a second contact 76 which is an annular shaped contact also installed to the base of the housing and in a spaced relation from contact 72.
      <br/>
      Contact 76 is connected to ground wire 56 through an electrical lead 78 which is in contact with sliding contact 52 mounted on valve member 22.
      <br/>
      In operation, fuel flowing between contacts 72, 76 has an electrical resistance value, so a voltage impressed across the sensor will produce a current whose value is proportional to this resistance.
      <br/>
      If water is present in the fuel, then the resistance value of the fluid changes (i.e., decreases) and the resulting change in current can be sensed as an output of the sensor.
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      The electrical wires routed to the various components (heaters, thermal switch, water sensor) are all commonly routed through the interior of housing 14.
      <br/>
      This eliminates wiring clutter on the outside of the housing so as to simplify installation and removal of assembly 10.
      <br/>
      The positive side of the power supply is connected to assembly 10 through an electrical terminal 80 at an end 82 of the housing opposite end 18 thereof.
      <br/>
      Similarly, the ground side of the power supply is connected to assembly 10 through an electrical terminal 84.
      <br/>
      Consequently, assembly 10 only requires one additional electrical output terminal; this being an electrical lead 86 which extends between contact 72 of sensor 70, and the signal output of the sensor.
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      What has been described is a fuel pump/fuel filter assembly used on vehicles and boats to provide fuel to an engine, and including a heater at the pump inlet to heat fuel drawn into the pump to a desired temperature.
      <br/>
      A valve member is operable to open and close the inlet and the valve member carries the heater.
      <br/>
      The heater is insulated from the valve member.
      <br/>
      A temperature sensor senses fuel temperature and operates the heater only if the fuel temperature is below a set temperature.
      <br/>
      Further, a water sensor is located adjacent the fuel inlet to determine if water is present in the fuel.
      <br/>
      The pump assembly is available in different sizes.
