      A preformed gift wrap for quickly and easily wrapping a gift box.
      <br/>
      The preformed gift wrap includes a generally rectangular sheet having a pair of spaced apart lateral fold lines extending between the sides of the sheet which divide the sheet into three generally rectangular panels.
      <br/>
      Extending from each side of the middle second panel is a generally trapezoidal middle flap.
      <br/>
      Each of the middle flaps is foldable along a line extending along the associated side of the sheet.
      <br/>
      Extending from each side of the outer first and third panels is a side flap.
      <br/>
      Each of the side flaps is foldable along a line extending along the associated side of the sheet.
      <br/>
      Each of the sides of the sheet also has two corner flaps extending therefrom such that a first pair of corner flaps are positioned adjacent the first panel and a second pair of corner flaps are positioned adjacent the third panel.
      <br/>
      The first pair of corner flaps is located between the side flaps adjacent the first panel and the middle flaps while the second pair of corner flaps are located between side flaps adjacent the second panel and the middle flaps such that the middle flaps are interposed between the corner flaps.
      <br/>
      The interior surface of the sheet has a plurality of adhesive strips provided thereon for attaching the sheet to the exterior of a gift box.
