    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">
      Radiation-sensitive materials, including light-sensitive materials, such as photographic materials, may utilize filter dyes for a variety of purposes.
      <br/>
      Filter dyes may be used to adjust the speed of a radiation-sensitive layer; they may be used as absorber dyes to increase image sharpness of a radiation-sensitive layer; they may be used as antihalation dyes to reduce halation; they may be used to reduce the amount or intensity of radiation from reaching one or more radiation-sensitive layers, and they may also be used to prevent radiation of a specific wavelength or range of wavelengths from reaching one or more of the radiation-sensitive layers in a radiation-sensitive element.
      <br/>
      For each of these uses, the filter dye(s) may be located in any number of layers of a radiation-sensitive element, depending on the specific requirements of the element and the dye, and on the manner in which the element is to be exposed.
      <br/>
      The amount of filter dyes used varies widely, but they are preferably present in amounts sufficient to alter in some way the response of the element to radiation.
      <br/>
      Filter dyes may be located in a layer above a radiation-sensitive layer, in a radiation-sensitive layer, in a layer below a radiation-sensitive layer, or in a layer on the opposite side of the support from a radiation-sensitive layer.
    </p>
    <p num="3">
      Photographic materials often contain layers sensitized to different regions of the spectrum, such as red, blue, green, ultraviolet, infrared, X-ray, to name a few.
      <br/>
      A typical color photographic element contains a layer sensitized to each of the three primary regions of the visible spectrum, i.e., blue, green, and red.
      <br/>
      Silver halide used in these materials has an intrinsic sensitivity to blue light.
      <br/>
      Increased sensitivity to blue light, along with sensitivity to green light or red light, is imparted through the use of various sensitizing dyes adsorbed to the silver halide grains.
      <br/>
      Sensitized silver halide retains its intrinsic sensitivity to blue light.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      There are numerous applications for which filtration or absorbance of very specific regions of light are highly desirable.
      <br/>
      Some of these applications, such as yellow filter dyes and magenta trimmer dyes, require non-diffusing dyes which may be coated in a layer specific manner to prevent specific wavelengths of light from reaching specific layers of the film during exposure.
      <br/>
      These dyes must have sharp-cutting bathochromic absorbance features on the bathochromic side to prevent light punch through without adversely affecting the speed of the underlying emulsions.
      <br/>
      Depending on the location of these filter layers relative to the sensitized silver halide emulsion layers, it would also be desirable to have non-diffusing, layer specific filter dyes with absorption spectra which are sharp-cutting on the hypsochromic edge as well as the bathochromic edge.
      <br/>
      Such dyes are sometimes known as "finger filters".
      <br/>
      Preferably these dyes should exhibit high extinction coefficients, narrow halfbandwidths and sharp cutting hypsochromic and bathochromic absorption envelopes when incorporated into photographic elements.
      <br/>
      Typically, to achieve these properties, solutions of dissolved, monomeric dyes (non-aggregated) have been incorporated.
      <br/>
      Dyes introduced by this method cannot be coated in a layer specific manner without the use of mordants, and therefore they often wander into adjacent layers and can cause problems such as speed loss or stain.
      <br/>
      Solubilized monomeric dyes may be mordanted to prevent wandering through adjacent layers.
      <br/>
      While the use of polymeric mordants can prevent dye wandering, such mordants aggravate the stain problem encountered when the dye remains in the element through processing.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      Dyes with a high extinction coefficient allow maximum light absorption using a minimum amount of dye.
      <br/>
      Lower requisite dye laydown reduces the cost of light filtration and produces fewer processing by-products.
      <br/>
      Lower dye laydowns may also result in reduced dye stain in short duration processes.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      Finger filters such as described above are highly desirable for other uses such as protecting silver halide sensitized emulsions from exposure by safelights.
      <br/>
      Such dyes must have absorbance spectra with high extinction coefficients and narrow halfbandwidths, and sharp cutting absorbance envelopes to efficiently absorb light in the narrow safelight-emitting region without adversely affecting the speed of the sensitized silver halide emulsions.
      <br/>
      This affords protection for the sensitized emulsion from exposure by light in the safelight's spectral region.
      <br/>
      Useful absorbance maxima for safelight dyes include, but are not restricted to 490 nm and 590 nm.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      Similar properties are required for infrared absorbing filter dyes.
      <br/>
      Laser-exposed radiation-sensitive elements require high efficiency light absorbance at the wavelength of laser emission.
      <br/>
      Unwanted absorbance from broadly absorbing dyes reduces the efficiency of light capture at the laser emission wavelength, and requires the use of larger amounts of dye to adequately cover the desired spectral region.
      <br/>
      In photographic elements, unwanted absorbance may also cause speed losses in adjacent silver halide sensitized layers if the photographic element has multiple sensitized layers present.
      <br/>
      Useful finger filter absorbance maxima for absorbing laser and phosphor emissions include but are not restricted to 790 nm, 633 nm, 670 nm, 545 nm and 488 nm. �Laser ablation/non-photographic�
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      In some photographic elements it is necessary to provide light filtration or antihalation at deep cyan and infrared wavelengths.
      <br/>
      Typically such protection has been achieved using water soluble dyes or milled solid particle dyes.
      <br/>
      Typically, water soluble monomeric dyes can provide relatively sharp, high extinction absorbance, but are prone to interlayer wandering.
      <br/>
      Solid particle dispersions of typical cyan filter dyes are broad absorbing, see for example U.S. Pat. No. 4,770,984, and often weakly absorbing at 700 nm.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      One common use for filter dyes is in silver halide light sensitive photographic elements.
      <br/>
      If, prior to processing, blue light reaches a layer containing silver halide which has been sensitized to a region of the spectrum other than blue, the silver halide grains exposed to the blue light, by virtue of their intrinsic sensitivity to blue light, would be rendered developable.
      <br/>
      This would result in a false rendition of the image information being recorded in the photographic element.
      <br/>
      It is therefore a common practice to include in the photographic element a material that filters blue light.
      <br/>
      This blue-absorbing material can be located anywhere in the element where it is desirable to filter blue light.
      <br/>
      In a color photographic element that has layers sensitized to each of the primary colors, it is common to have the blue-sensitive layer closest to the exposure source and to interpose a blue-absorbing, or yellow filter layer between the blue-sensitized layer and the green- and red-sensitized layers.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      Another common use for filter dyes is to filter or trim portions of the UV, visible or infrared spectral regions to prevent unwanted wavelengths of light from reaching sensitized emulsions.
      <br/>
      Just as yellow filter dyes prevent false color rendition from the exposure of emulsions sensitized to a region of the spectrum other than blue, UV, magenta, cyan and infrared filter dyes can prevent false color rendition by shielding sensitized emulsion layers from exposure to specific wavelength regions.
      <br/>
      One application of this strategy is the use of green-absorbing magenta trimmer dyes.
      <br/>
      In one type of typical color photographic element containing a layer sensitized to each of the three primary regions of the visible spectrum, i.e., blue, green, and red, the green-sensitized layer is coated above the red-sensitized layer and below the blue-sensitized layer.
      <br/>
      Depending on the chosen spectral sensitivity maxima for the sensitized silver halide layers, there may be a region of overlap between the spectral sensitivities of the green and red emulsions.
      <br/>
      Under such circumstances, green light which is not absorbed by the green-sensitive emulsion can punch through to the red sensitive emulsion and be absorbed by the leading edge of the red spectral sensitizing dye.
      <br/>
      This crosstalk between the green and red emulsions results in false color rendition.
      <br/>
      It would, therefore, be highly desirable to find a green-absorbing filter dye which upon incorporation into a photographic element would absorb strongly around the spectral maximum of the green-sensitized emulsion, and possess a sharp cutting bathochromic absorbance such that there is no appreciable absorbance just bathochromic to its absorbance maximum.
      <br/>
      Though the position of optimal absorption maximum for a magenta trimmer dye will vary depending on the photographic element being constructed, it is particularly desirable in one type of typical color photographic element containing a layer sensitized to each of the three primary regions of the visible spectrum, i.e., blue, green, and red, that a magenta trimmer dye absorb strongly at about 550 nm, and possess a sharp cutting bathochromic absorbance such that there is no appreciable absorbance above about 550 nm.
      <br/>
      Therefore it would be desirable to provide a filter dye for use in photographic elements that possesses high requisite absorbance in the green region of the spectrum below about 550 nm, but little or no absorbance above about 550 nm, and furthermore does not suffer from incubative or post process stain problems, and furthermore is not prone to migration in the coated film, but is fully removed upon processing.
    </p>
    <p num="11">
      One method used to incorporate soluble monomeric filter dyes into photographic film element layers is to add them as aqueous or alcoholic solutions.
      <br/>
      Dyes introduced by this method are generally highly mobile and rapidly diffusing and often wander into other layers of the element, usually with deleterious results.
      <br/>
      While the use of polymeric mordants can prevent dye wandering, such mordants aggravate the stain problem encountered when the dye remains in the element through processing.
    </p>
    <p num="12">
      Filter dyes have also been prepared as conventional dispersions in aqueous gelatin using standard colloid milling or homogenization methods or as loaded latices.
      <br/>
      More recently, ball-milling, sand-milling, media-milling and related methods of producing fine particle size slurries and suspensions of filter dyes have become standard tools for producing slurries and dispersions that can readily be used in photographic melt formulations.
      <br/>
      Solid particulate filter dyes introduced as dispersions, when coated at sufficiently low pH, can eliminate problems associated with dye wandering.
      <br/>
      However, milled, insoluble solid particulate filter dyes provide relatively low absorption coefficients, requiring that an excessive amount of dye be coated.
      <br/>
      In addition, the time and expense involved in preparing serviceable solid particulate filter dye dispersions by milling techniques are a deterrent to their use, especially in large volume applications.
      <br/>
      It is therefore desirable to provide dye dispersions that do not necessarily require mechanical milling before use and that do not wander but that wash out easily during processing leaving little or no residual stain.
      <br/>
      It is also desirable that such filter dye dispersions provide high light absorption efficiencies with sharp-cutting absorbance peaks.
      <br/>
      One method of obtaining these desirable dye features in solid particulate dispersions of oxonol filter dyes was described by Texter (U.S. Pat. No. 5,274,109 and U.S. Pat. No. 5,326,687).
      <br/>
      Texter describes a process by which pyrazolone oxonol dyes are microprecipitated under strictly controlled pH conditions to produce absorbance spectra which are narrow, bathochromic and sharp cutting on the long wavelength side relative to their corresponding milled solid particulate dispersions.
      <br/>
      This technique, however, is impractical for large volume applications.
    </p>
    <heading>PROBLEM TO BE SOLVED BY THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="13">
      It is therefore desirable to have a filter dye which has a high extinction coefficient, narrow halfbandwidth, sharp cutting on both the hypsochromic and bathochromic edge, and capable of being substantially completely removed or rendered colorless on process of an exposed radiation-sensitive element comprising said dye.
      <br/>
      It is also desirable to have a method for preparing a dispersion of a filter dye that is suitable for high volume manufacture.

      We have now discovered that certain dyes of Formula I, II and III, set forth below, aggregate when dispersed in an aqueous medium (preferably containing a hydrophilic colloid) and provide the advantages set for in the above objects of the invention.
      <br/>
      The said dye dispersion can be prepared by dispersing powdered dye or microcrystalline solid dye particles in an aqueous medium, preferably containing gelatin or other hydrophilic colloid, using the methods set forth herein.

    <p num="30">Still another preferred embodiment of the invention comprises a radiation-sensitive element, such as a photographic element, containing an aggregated dye of structural Formula I, II or III.</p>
    <p num="31">Yet another preferred embodiment of the invention comprises a method of preparing a dispersion which comprises adding a dye of structural Formula I, II or III to an aqueous medium at a temperature of from about 20 to about 1000C and agitating the mixture for about 5 minutes to about 48 hours.</p>
    <heading>ADVANTAGEOUS EFFECTS OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="32">
      This invention provides a dye, useful as a filter dye in a radiation-sensitive element, such as a photographic element, which when dispersed in an aqueous medium, for example aqueous gelatin, dissolves then spontaneously aggregates.
      <br/>
      In some instances, the aggregated dye state constitutes an unusually well-ordered and thermodynamically stable liquid crystalline phase.
      <br/>
      A dye in the aggregated state possesses a coated  LAMBDA max which is substantially bathochromic to that of its monomeric non-aggregated state and exhibits exceptionally high covering power at its coating  LAMBDA max Further the aggregated dye exhibits sharp-cutting bathochromic and hypsochromic spectral features absorbing strongly at its coating  LAMBDA max while absorbing comparatively little light at wavelengths just below or just above its absorbance maximum.
      <br/>
      Further, the aggregated dye possesses an unusually narrow halfbandwidth.
      <br/>
      The dyes can be formulated using methods for producing microcrystalline solid particle dye dispersions (SPD's), or as direct gelatin dispersions (DGD's) for incorporation in a photographic element.
      <br/>
      In such an environment, the spontaneously aggregated dyes exhibit little, if any tendency to wander within the element and upon processing are substantially free of post-process stain problems.

      When reference in this application is made to a substituent "group", this means that the substituent may itself be substituted or unsubstituted (for example "alkyl group" refers to an unsubstituted or substituted alkyl).
      <br/>
      Generally, unless otherwise specifically stated, substituents on any "groups" referenced herein or where something is stated to be possibly substituted, include the possibility of any groups, whether substituted or unsubstituted, which do not destroy properties necessary for the photographic utility.
      <br/>
      For example, the filter dyes of this invention should not contain a substituent or combination of substituents, which render the dye too soluble at coating pH's, favoring a mobile monomeric dye species instead of the preferred aggregated dye species.

      It will also be understood throughout this application that reference to a compound of a particular general formula includes those compounds of other more specific formula which specific formula falls within the general formula definition.

      Examples of substituents on any of the mentioned groups can include known substituents, such as: halogen, for example, chloro, fluoro, bromo, iodo; alkoxy, particularly those with 1 to 6 carbon atoms (for example, methoxy, ethoxy); substituted or unsubstituted alkyl, particularly lower alkyl (for example, methyl, trifluoromethyl); alkenyl or thioalkyl (for example, methylthio or ethylthio), particularly either of those with 1 to 6 carbon atoms; substituted and unsubstituted aryl, particularly those having from 6 to 20 carbon atoms (for example, phenyl, naphthyl, anthracenyl or styryl); and substituted or unsubstituted heteroaryl, particularly those having a 5 or 6-membered ring containing 1 to 3 heteroatoms selected from N, O, or S (for example, pyridyl, thienyl, furyl, pyrrolyl); and others known in the art.

      The dyes of Formulas (I), (II) and (III) can be prepared by synthetic techniques well-known in the art, as illustrated by the synthetic examples below.
      <br/>
      Such techniques are further illustrated, for example, in "The Cyanine Dyes and Related Compounds", Frances Hamer, Interscience Publishers, 1964.
    </p>
    <p num="48">The dispersions of this invention can be prepared in any of the ways known in the art (e.g., with the aid of a high-boiling non-polar organic solvent or in suitable water-miscible solvents such as methyl alcohol or dimethylformamide or the like), but are preferably formulated using methods developed for producing solid microcrystalline particles of dye (SPD's) or are more preferably formulated as direct gelatin dispersions (DGD's) as described herein.</p>
    <p num="49">
      A dispersion comprising solid microcrystalline particles of dye (SPD) can be prepared by known methods.
      <br/>
      Such methods includes forming a slurry of the dye in an aqueous medium comprising water and a surfactant and the subjecting the slurry to a milling procedure such as ball-milling, sand-milling, media-milling or colloid-milling (preferably media-milling).
      <br/>
      The SPD can then be added to an aqueous medium comprising water and a hydrophilic colloid, such as gelatin, for use in a photographic element.
    </p>
    <p num="50">
      In another preferred embodiment, the dyes may be formulated as a direct gelatin dispersion (DGD) wherein the finely powdered dye or aqueous slurry thereof is simply mixed or agitated with aqueous medium containing gelatin (or other hydrophilic colloid) at a temperature of 40 (degree)  C. or higher.
      <br/>
      This method does not require the use of organic solvents, surfactants, polymer additives, milling processes, pH control or the like.
      <br/>
      It is simpler, faster, more forgiving and more flexible than prior processes.
    </p>
    <p num="51">
      In either of the preferred methods, the dyes may be subjected to elevated temperatures before and/or after gelatin dispersion, but to obtain desirable results, this heat treatment is carried out preferably after dispersing in gelatin.
      <br/>
      The optimal temperature range for preparing gelatin-based dispersions is 40 (degree)  C.-100 (degree)  C. but should remain below the decomposition points of the dyes.
      <br/>
      The heating time is not especially critical as long as the dyes are not decomposed, but in general it is in the range of 5 minutes to 48 hours.
      <br/>
      A similar heat treatment may be applied, if so desired, to dyes prepared as solid particle dispersions before and/or after dispersion in aqueous gelatin to obtain effective results.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, if so desired, pH and/or ionic strength adjustments may be utilized to control the solubility and aggregation properties of dyes prepared using SPD or DGD formulation techniques.
      <br/>
      The direct gelatin dispersion method is advantageous in that it does not necessarily require the use of organic solvents, surfactants, polymer additives, milling processes, pH control or the like.
      <br/>
      A related method described by Boettcher for preparing concentrated sensitizing dye dispersions in aqueous gelatin (PCT WO 93/23792) is equally effective when applied to the inventive dyes.
      <br/>
      The entire disclosure of WO 93/23792 is incorporated herein by reference.
    </p>
    <p num="52">
      Solid particle dispersion and direct gelatin dispersion formulations of the compound of Formula (I-III) are useful as general purpose filter dyes, alone or in combination with other filter dyes in photographic elements.
      <br/>
      The dyes formulated as described above possess finite but low solubilities and a pronounced tendency to aggregate spontaneously at coating pH's of 6 or less (generally 4-6) so that they do not interact with other components of the photographic element.
      <br/>
      However, they are highly soluble at processing pH's of 8 or more (generally 8-12), such that they are still fully removed during photographic processing.
    </p>
    <p num="53">
      A particular advantage of the inventive dyes is that in the aggregated state, they provide higher covering power at their coating  LAMBDA max than comparable known dyes which are insoluble and exist as microcrystalline solid particles in the photographic medium.
      <br/>
      This advantage is particularly important in modern film formats and processing conditions, as filter dyes with high covering power need not be coated at as high a coverage as dyes with lower covering power in order to achieve the same degree of light filtration.
      <br/>
      In addition to reducing manufacturing costs, lower levels of coated dyes will reduce the level of dye residue built up in the processing solutions, and the resulting lower levels of dissolved dye residue removed from photographic elements will have reduced environmental impact.
    </p>
    <p num="54">
      A further advantage of dyes of the invention is that they generally possess absorbance envelopes that are sharper cutting on the bathochromic side than comparable known solid particle dyes such as the structural analogs disclosed in Agfa U.S. Pat. No. 4,770,984. This feature is especially advantageous when strong light absorbance is required in a spectral region up to a specific  LAMBDA max, and maximum light transmission is required past the specified  LAMBDA max.
      <br/>
      Such filter or trimmer dyes are especially useful when coated in specific layers of color photographic films to effectively prevent light of a specific wavelength region from exposing radiation-sensitive layers below the light filtration layer containing the dye, without causing unwanted absorption of longer wavelength radiation.
      <br/>
      A green filter dye coated directly above a red-sensitive silver halide layer is a particularly advantageous example of such absorbance features, and excellent green/red speed separation can be realized.
      <br/>
      In a typical color photographic element, it is desirable to have a green-absorbing filter dye which when coated absorbs strongly at wavelengths close to 550 nm, but which absorbs comparatively little at wavelengths greater than 550 nm.
      <br/>
      It should be emphasized that the exact envelope of desirable light absorbance for a filter dye, even specifically a green filter dye, varies tremendously from one photographic element to another depending on the intended purpose of the material.
      <br/>
      Some photographic elements might require a filter dye, such as a green filter dye, which absorbs strongly up to a wavelength somewhat shorter or longer than 550 nm, but is sharp cutting on the bathochromic side, mostly transmitting wavelengths of light past the desired absorbance  LAMBDA max.
      <br/>
      The feature of coated dye absorbance exhibiting a sharp cutting bathochromic and/or hypsochromic characteristic is fundamentally useful for wavelength-specific light filtration, though the exact wavelength of desired spectral shift from absorbance to transmission may be different for different photographic materials.
    </p>
    <p num="55">
      The dyes may be located in any layer of the element where it is desirable to absorb light, but in photographic elements it is particularly advantageous to locate them in a layer where they will be solubilized and washed out during processing.
      <br/>
      Useful amounts of dye range from 1 to 1000 mg/m2.
      <br/>
      The dye should be present in an amount sufficient to yield an optical density at the absorbance Dmax in the spectral region of interest before processing of at least 0.10 density units and preferably at least 0.50 density units.
      <br/>
      This optical density will generally be less than 5.0 density units for most photographic applications.
    </p>
    <p num="56">
      The dyes of the invention can be used as interlayer dyes, trimmer dyes, or antihalation dyes.
      <br/>
      They can be used to prevent crossover in X-ray materials as disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,900,652 and 4,803,150 and European Patent Application Publication No. 0 391 405, to prevent unwanted light from reaching a sensitive emulsion layer of a multicolor photographic element as disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,988,611, and for other uses as indicated by the absorbance spectrum of the particular dye.
      <br/>
      The dyes can be used in a separate filter layer or as an intergrain absorber.

      The aggregated dyes of Formula (I-III) are useful for the preparation of radiation sensitive materials.
      <br/>
      Such materials are sensitive to radiation such as visible light, ultraviolet, infrared, X-ray.
      <br/>
      The material can be an optical recording medium, such as a CD or other medium sensitive to a laser, light emitting diode, or a more conventional light-sensitive photographic material.
    </p>
    <p num="58">
      Another aspect of this invention comprises a radiation sensitive element containing an aggregated dye of Formula (I-III).
      <br/>
      Preferably, the radiation sensitive element is a photographic element comprising a support bearing at least one light sensitive hydrophilic colloid layer and at least one other hydrophilic colloid layer.
      <br/>
      A dye of Formula I, II or III may be incorporated in a hydrophilic layer of the photographic element in any known way.
    </p>
    <p num="59">The support of the element of the invention can be any of a number of well-known supports for photographic elements as discussed more fully below.</p>
    <p num="60">
      The photographic elements made by the method of the present invention can be single color elements or multicolor elements.
      <br/>
      Multicolor elements contain dye image-forming units sensitive to each of the three primary regions of the spectrum.
      <br/>
      Each unit can be comprised of a single emulsion layer or of multiple emulsion layers sensitive to a given region of the spectrum.
      <br/>
      The layers of the element, including the layers of the image-forming units, can be arranged in various orders as known in the art.
      <br/>
      In an alternative format, the emulsions sensitive to each of the three primary regions of the spectrum can be disposed as a single segmented layer.
    </p>
    <p num="61">
      A typical multicolor photographic element comprises a support bearing a cyan dye image-forming unit comprised of at least one red-sensitive silver halide emulsion layer having associated therewith at least one cyan dye-forming coupler, a magenta dye image-forming unit comprising at least one green-sensitive silver halide emulsion layer having associated therewith at least one magenta dye-forming coupler, and a yellow dye image-forming unit comprising at least one blue-sensitive silver halide emulsion layer having associated therewith at least one yellow dye-forming coupler.
      <br/>
      The element can contain additional layers, such as filter layers, interlayers, overcoat layers, subbing layers, and the like.
      <br/>
      All of these can be coated on a support which can be transparent or reflective (for example, a paper support).

    <p num="62">
      Photographic elements of the present invention may also usefully include a magnetic recording material as described in Research Disclosure, Item 34390, November 1992, or a transparent magnetic recording layer such as a layer containing magnetic particles on the underside of a transparent support as in U.S. Pat. No. 4,279,945 and U.S. Pat. No. 4,302,523. The element typically will have a total thickness (excluding the support) of from 5 to 30 microns.
      <br/>
      While the order of the color sensitive layers can be varied, they will normally be red-sensitive, green-sensitive and blue-sensitive, in that order on a transparent support, (that is, blue sensitive furthest from the support) and the reverse order on a reflective support being typical.
    </p>
    <p num="63">
      The present invention also contemplates the use of photographic elements of the present invention in what are often referred to as single use cameras (or "film with lens" units).
      <br/>
      These cameras are sold with film preloaded in them and the entire camera is returned to a processor with the exposed film remaining inside the camera.
      <br/>
      Such cameras may have glass or plastic lenses through which the photographic element is exposed.

    <p num="73">
      The silver halide used in the photographic elements may be silver iodobromide, silver bromide, silver chloride, silver chlorobromide, silver chloroiodobromide, and the like.
      <br/>
      For example, the silver halide used in the photographic elements of the present invention may contain at least 90% silver chloride or more (for example, at least 95%, 98%, 99% or 100% silver chloride).
      <br/>
      In the case of such high chloride silver halide emulsions, some silver bromide may be present but typically substantially no silver iodide.
      <br/>
      Substantially no silver iodide means the iodide concentration would be no more than 1%, and preferably less than 0.5 or 0.1%. In particular, in such a case the possibility is also contemplated that the silver chloride could be treated with a bromide source to increase its sensitivity, although the bulk concentration of bromide in the resulting emulsion will typically be no more than about 2 to 2.5% and preferably between about 0.6 to 1.2% (the remainder being silver chloride).
      <br/>
      The foregoing % figures are mole %.
    </p>
    <p num="74">
      The type of silver halide grains preferably include polymorphic, cubic, and octahedral.
      <br/>
      The grain size of the silver halide may have any distribution known to be useful in photographic compositions, and may be either polydipersed or monodispersed.
    </p>
    <p num="75">
      Tabular grain silver halide emulsions may also be used.
      <br/>
      Tabular grains are those with two parallel major faces each clearly larger than any remaining grain face and tabular grain emulsions are those in which the tabular grains account for at least 30 percent, more typically at least 50 percent, preferably &gt;70 percent and optimally &gt;90 percent of total grain projected area.
      <br/>
      The tabular grains can account for substantially all (&gt;97 percent) of total grain projected area.
      <br/>
      The tabular grain emulsions can be high aspect ratio tabular grain emulsions--i.e., ECD/t&gt;8, where ECD is the diameter of a circle having an area equal to grain projected area and t is tabular grain thickness; intermediate aspect ratio tabular grain emulsions--i.e., ECD/t=5 to 8; or low aspect ratio tabular grain emulsions--i.e., ECD/t=2 to 5.
      <br/>
      The emulsions typically exhibit high tabularity (T), where T (i.e., ECD/t2)&gt;25 and ECD and t are both measured in micrometers ( MU m).
      <br/>
      The tabular grains can be of any thickness compatible with achieving an aim average aspect ratio and/or average tabularity of the tabular grain emulsion.
      <br/>
      Preferably the tabular grains satisfying projected area requirements are those having thicknesses of &lt;0.3  MU m, thin (&lt;0.2  MU m) tabular grains being specifically preferred and ultrathin (&lt;0.07  MU m) tabular grains being contemplated for maximum tabular grain performance enhancements.
      <br/>
      When the native blue absorption of iodohalide tabular grains is relied upon for blue speed, thicker tabular grains, typically up to 0.5  MU m in thickness, are contemplated.
    </p>
    <p num="76">High iodide tabular grain emulsions are illustrated by House U.S. Patent 4,490,458, Maskasky U.S. Pat. No. 4,459,353 and Yagi et al EPO 0 410 410.</p>
    <p num="77">
      Tabular grains formed of silver halide(s) that form a face centered cubic (rock salt type) crystal lattice structure can have either +100} or +111} major faces.
      <br/>
      Emulsions containing +111} major face tabular grains, including those with controlled grain dispersities, halide distributions, twin plane spacing, edge structures and grain dislocations as well as adsorbed +111} grain face stabilizers, are illustrated in those references cited in Research Disclosure I, Section I.B.(3) (page 503).
    </p>
    <p num="78">
      The silver halide grains to be used in the invention may be prepared according to methods known in the art, such as those described in Research Disclosure I and James, The Theory of the Photographic Process.
      <br/>
      These include methods such as ammoniacal emulsion making, neutral or acidic emulsion making, and others known in the art.
      <br/>
      These methods generally involve mixing a water soluble silver salt with a water soluble halide salt in the presence of a protective colloid, and controlling the temperature, pAg, pH values, etc, at suitable values during formation of the silver halide by precipitation.
    </p>
    <p num="79">
      The silver halide to be used in the invention may be advantageously subjected to chemical sensitization with noble metal (for example, gold) sensitizers, middle chalcogen (for example, sulfur) sensitizers, reduction sensitizers and others known in the art.
      <br/>
      Compounds and techniques useful for chemical sensitization of silver halide are known in the art and described in Research Disclosure I and the references cited therein.
    </p>
    <p num="80">
      The photographic elements of the present invention, as is typical, provide the silver halide in the form of an emulsion.
      <br/>
      Photographic emulsions generally include a vehicle for coating the emulsion as a layer of a photographic element.
      <br/>
      Useful vehicles include both naturally occurring substances such as proteins, protein derivatives, cellulose derivatives (e.g., cellulose esters), gelatin (e.g., alkali-treated gelatin such as cattle bone or hide gelatin, or acid treated gelatin such as pigskin gelatin), gelatin derivatives (e.g., acetylated gelatin, phthalated gelatin, and the like), and others as described in Research Disclosure I. Also useful as vehicles or vehicle extenders are hydrophilic water-permeable colloids.
      <br/>
      These include synthetic polymeric peptizers, carriers, and/or binders such as poly(vinyl alcohol), poly(vinyl lactams), acrylamide polymers, polyvinyl acetals, polymers of alkyl and sulfoalkyl acrylates and methacrylates, hydrolyzed polyvinyl acetates, polyamides, polyvinyl pyridine, methacrylamide copolymers, and the like, as described in Research Disclosure I. The vehicle can be present in the emulsion in any amount useful in photographic emulsions.
      <br/>
      The emulsion can also include any of the addenda known to be useful in photographic emulsions.
      <br/>
      These include chemical sensitizers, such as active gelatin, sulfur, selenium, tellurium, gold, platinum, palladium, iridium, osmium, rhenium, phosphorous, or combinations thereof.
      <br/>
      Chemical sensitization is generally carried out at pAg levels of from 5 to 10, pH levels of from 5 to 8, and temperatures of from 30 to 80 (degree)  C., as described in Research Disclosure I, Section IV (pages 510-511) and the references cited therein.
    </p>
    <p num="81">
      The silver halide may be sensitized by sensitizing dyes by any method known in the art, such as described in Research Disclosure I. The dye may be added to an emulsion of the silver halide grains and a hydrophilic colloid at any time prior to (e.g., during or after chemical sensitization) or simultaneous with the coating of the emulsion on a photographic element.
      <br/>
      The dyes may, for example, be added as a solution in water or an alcohol.
      <br/>
      The dye/silver halide emulsion may be mixed with a dispersion of color image-forming coupler immediately before coating or in advance of coating (for example, 2 hours).
    </p>
    <p num="82">
      Photographic elements of the present invention are preferably imagewise exposed using any of the known techniques, including those described in Research Disclosure I, section XVI.
      <br/>
      This typically involves exposure to light in the visible region of the spectrum, and typically such exposure is of a live image through a lens, although exposure can also be exposure to a stored image (such as a computer stored image) by means of light emitting devices (such as light emitting diodes, CRT and the like).
    </p>
    <p num="83">
      Photographic elements comprising the composition of the invention can be processed in any of a number of well-known photographic processes utilizing any of a number of well-known processing compositions, described, for example, in Research Disclosure I, or in T.

      <br/>
      In the case of processing a negative working element, the element is treated with a color developer (that is one which will form the colored image dyes with the color couplers), and then with a oxidizer and a solvent to remove silver and silver halide.
      <br/>
      In the case of processing a reversal color element, the element is first treated with a black and white developer (that is, a developer which does not form colored dyes with the coupler compounds) followed by a treatment to fog silver halide (usually chemical fogging or light fogging), followed by treatment with a color developer.

      Zirconium oxide beads (60 mL, 1.8 mm diameter) were added and the container with the cap tightly secured was placed in a mill and the contents milled for four days.
      <br/>
      The resulting mixture was then filtered to remove the zirconium oxide beads.
      <br/>
      The resulting aqueous microcrystalline dye slurries will be referred to in the following examples as MDS's.

    <p num="95">Solid Particle Dispersion (SPD) Formulation</p>
    <p num="96">
      Aqueous gelatin dispersions of the above MDS's were prepared as follows.
      <br/>
      The vessel containing the dye MDS was removed and the requisite weight of dye slurry was added to a 12.5% aqueous gelatin solution (18.0 g) at 45 (degree)  C. This mixture was then diluted with water to a weight of 88.87 g., yielding the final dye dispersion.
      <br/>
      In the subsequent experimental sections gelatin-containing dye dispersions prepared in this manner will be referred to as solid particle dispersions (SPD's).
      <br/>
      The term "SPD" is used throughout simply to denote dye dispersions which have been formulated using well known milling techniques normally used for preparing solid particle microcrystalline dye dispersions.
      <br/>
      This does not imply that the physical state of the dye prepared in this manner is exclusively microcrystalline in nature.

      The swollen gelatin was then melted at 50 (degree)  C. for 15 minutes with agitation.

      The gelatin solution was cooled to 25 (degree)  C., then refrigerated at 5 (degree)  C. to set. Nominally 1.49700 g H2 O was then added on top of the set gelatin followed by 0.00300 g of powdered dye.

      The dye powder was thoroughly wetted and dispersed in the water layer by agitation and then allowed to stand at 25 (degree)  C. for 17 hours.

      The samples were then heated to 60 (degree)  C. in a water bath for 2 hours and mixed with intermittent agitation.

      The samples were subsequently cooled to 39.0 (degree)  C. over a period of approximately 1 hour and maintained at this temperature until measurement.

      Direct gelatin dispersions of the Inventive Dyes 2, 6, 8, 9, 11 and 15 were prepared as described in Example C at concentrations equivalent to dye laydowns of 0.064 mg/m2. Solution aliquots of each dispersion were smeared onto glass microscope slides (0.8/1.0 mm thickness) to form uniformly thin wet films which were then allowed to dry at ambient temperature and humidity for at least 17 hours.
      <br/>
      The absorption spectra for these dried films were then measured at 25 (degree)  C. These samples are referred to in Table IX as "dry DGD's".

      The inventive Dyes 2, 6, 8, 9, 11 and 15 were also dispersed in aqueous gelatin according to the SPD procedure described in Example B. These SPD's were coated on a polyester support according to the following procedure.
      <br/>
      A spreading agent (Olin lOG, an isononylphenoxy glycidol surfactand available from Olin Corp.) and a hardener (bis(vinylsulfonylmethyl)ether) were added to the dye-gelatin melt prepared as described above.
      <br/>
      A melt from this mixture was then coated on a poly(ethylene terephthalate) support to achieve a dye coverage of 0.064 g/m2, a gelatin coverage of 1.61 g/m2, and a hardener level of 0.016 g/m2. The absorption spectrum of the dried SPD coating was measured at 25 (degree)  C. The data are summarized in Table IX.

      It is clear from the data that the aggregated dyes in the inventive examples show an excellent robustness toward high heat and humidity as evidenced by the fact that little or no density loss at the aggregate  LAMBDA max is observed as a result of incubation.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, the absence of any detectable optical density at the monomeric  LAMBDA max of the inventive dyes following incubation demonstrates that little or no mobile monomeric dye species is produced under these conditions.
      <br/>
      Consequently, the aggregated inventive dyes exhibit excellent robustness and fastness to diffusion at high temperature and humidity.
