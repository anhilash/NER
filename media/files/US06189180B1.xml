    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">(1) Field of the Invention</p>
    <p num="3">The present invention relates to improvement of the suction tool for an electric vacuum cleaner.</p>
    <p num="4">(2) Description of the Prior Art</p>
    <p num="5">As an example of a suction tool for an electric vacuum cleaner, disclosed in for example, Japanese Utility Model Publication Hei 3 No. 41,634 is a configuration which as shown in FIGS. 1 and 2 includes: inside a suction tool body 33 made up of upper and lower casings 31 and 32 being butted to each other, a suction inflow passage 36 for conducting the suction air stream from a suction port 34 which is an opening in the lower surface of suction tool body 33, to the vacuum cleaner (not shown) via a joint tube 35; a motor 37; and a rotary brush 40 which is driven to rotate about a support shaft 39 through a belt 38 by the driving force of the motor 37.</p>
    <p num="6">
      Since, in the above suction tool, rotary brush 40 rotates about support shaft 39, a space which is greater than the dimension of the radius of rotary brush 40 was needed around the brush inside suction tool body 33, thus increasing the size of the suction tool.
      <br/>
      There was also a risk of danger in that if the hand touched the rotary brush 40, the fingers might be drawn into the tool by the brush.
      <br/>
      Further, there was an area which the bristles of rotary brush 40 could not reach, and the tool had a poor scrubbing effect of dust and dirt in this area.

    </p>
    <p num="37">As has been seen in the above description, each structure of the invention is thus configured, and the effects of the features of the invention are as follows:</p>
    <p num="38">
      In the first configuration of the invention, wherein the movable brush is reciprocated back and forth about the support shaft, the space required for the oscillation is reduced as compared to the rotational space that was occupied by a rotary brush.
      <br/>
      In accordance with the movable brush that sways and reciprocates, there is no risk of danger that the fingers might be drawing in.
    </p>
    <p num="39">
      In the second configuration of the invention, wherein the movable brush is linearly reciprocated left and right, similarly to the case of the first configuration of the invention, the space required for the oscillation is reduced as compared to the rotational space that was occupied by a rotary brush.
      <br/>
      In accordance with the movable brush that sways and reciprocates, there is no risk of danger that the fingers might be drawing in.
    </p>
    <p num="40">In accordance with the third configuration of the invention, depending upon the type of the material on the floor, such as tatami mat (straw matting), carpet, rug, etc;, either brush bristles or blade can be selectively used by detaching a single movable brush and reversing it upside down.</p>
    <p num="41">In accordance with the fourth configuration of the invention, the dust and dirt in front of the rotary brush, that is, in the area which cannot be reached by the conventional rotary brush, can be scrubbed by the second brush.</p>
    <p num="42">In accordance with the fifth configuration of the invention, the dust and dirt at the side, either left or right, of the rotary brush, that is, in the area which cannot be reached by the conventional rotary brush, can be scrubbed by the second brush.</p>
    <p num="43">
      In accordance with sixth configuration of the invention, the movable brush is swayed by a linear motor or solenoid to perform cleaning of the floor surface.
      <br/>
      As a result, the provision of only a movable brush which simply oscillates is so effective that it is possible to make the suction tool compact as compared to the conventional brush which was rotated.
      <br/>
      Still more, the driver device is constituted of a linear motor or-solenoid, needing fewer parts, thus a further reduction in size can be expected.
    </p>
    <p num="44">
      In accordance with seventh configuration of the invention, the oscillator plate is reciprocated through the rod by the operation of the linear motor, so that a movable brush provided at the lower end of the oscillator plate performs cleaning.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, only a movable brush is simply made to oscillate, so that it is possible to make the suction tool compact as compared to the conventional brush which was rotated.
      <br/>
      Still more, since the driver device is constituted of a linear motor, the driving force of the motor is transmitted to the oscillator plate using only a rod.
      <br/>
      This configuration needs very few parts, so that a further reduction in size can be expected.
    </p>
    <p num="45">In accordance with the eighth configuration of the invention, a solenoid is used in place of the linear motor in the above seventh configuration, so that it is possible to produce a suction tool for an electric vacuum cleaner with a few parts, as in the seventh configuration.</p>
    <p num="46">
      In accordance with ninth configuration of the invention, the oscillator plate is reciprocated through the rod by the operation of the linear motor or solenoid, so that the movable brush and sweeping member provided at the lower end of the oscillator plate performs cleaning.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, the provision of only a movable brush is simply made to oscillate, so that it is possible to make the suction tool compact as compared to the conventional brush which was rotated.
      <br/>
      Still more, since the driver device is constituted of a linear motor or solenoid, the driving force of the motor is transmitted to the oscillator plate using only a rod.
      <br/>
      This configuration needs very few parts, so that a further reduction in size can be expected.
      <br/>
      Further, the provision of a sweeping member enables lint and fluff adhering to carpet etc., to be scrubbed efficiently, thus enhancing cleaning efficiency.
    </p>
    <p num="47">
      In accordance with the tenth configuration of invention, the movable brush unit is swayed and reciprocated by the operation of the driver device so that the movable brush and sweeping member of the movable brush unit performs cleaning.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, the provision of only a movable brush which simply oscillates is so effective that it is possible to make the suction tool compact as compared to the conventional brush which was rotated.
      <br/>
      Still more, since the front sweeping part is formed shorter than the rear sweeping part, the structure enables lint and fluff adhering to carpet etc., to be scrubbed efficiently, thus enhancing cleaning efficiency.
    </p>
    <p num="48">
      In accordance with the eleventh configuration of the invention, during the operation of the movable brush unit, cleaning is performed whilst vibrations are absorbed by the anti-vibration mechanism.
      <br/>
      Thus, if the movable brush unit vibrates, the vibration can be alleviated so as not to be transmitted to the whole part of the suction tool.
      <br/>
      Therefore, it is possible to provide an electric vacuum cleaner having good handling, in which the vibration will not-spread to the hands of the user.
    </p>
    <p num="49">In accordance with the twelfth configuration of the invention, since the movable brush is impregnated with liquid paraffin, this feature can offer a simple floor polishing effect for the flooring.</p>
    <p num="50">Since the thirteenth configuration of the invention, further has an angular motion regulatory mechanism for regulating the reciprocating motion of the movable brush about the pivotal shaft, the vibration of the movable brush as well as deformation of the unit base frame is inhibited during the swaying and reciprocating motion, thus making it possible to obtain a reliable sweeping effect of the movable brush.</p>
    <p num="51">
      In accordance with the fourteenth configuration of the invention, since a leaf spring is interposed between the rotary member and the immovable member, braking force is generated through the leaf spring within the range in which the rotary member is movable.
      <br/>
      As a result, it is possible to reliably inhibit the vibration of the movable brushing unit by an inexpensive method
    </p>
    <p num="52">In accordance with the fifteenth configuration of the invention, since the floor polishing assembly moves back and forth in the undersurface of the suction tool body by the operation of the linear motor or solenoid, the electric vacuum cleaner can be used as a floor polisher, thus it is possible to provide an electric vacuum cleaner having good handling.</p>
    <p num="53">
      In accordance with the sixteenth configuration of the invention, the polisher cloth polishes the floor surface whilst the polishing plate vibrates up and down, so that it is possible to polish the floor surface without strongly rubbing it.
      <br/>
      As a result, polishing can be performed without damage to the floor surface.
    </p>
    <p num="54">
      In accordance with the seventeenth feature of the invention, the polisher cloth is freely detached from the polishing plate.
      <br/>
      This configuration permits the polisher cloth to be replaced in a markedly simple manner.
    </p>
    <p num="55">
      In accordance with the eighteenth configuration of the invention, the vibrating cam becomes mechanically linked with the polishing plate so that the motion of the vibrating cam can be transmitted to the polishing plate so to vibrate only when the suction tool body is placed on the floor surface.
      <br/>
      As a result, when the suction tool body is lifted, in other words, when the user lifts up the suction tool body for transfer, or any other reason, the vibrating cam is not mechanically linked with the polishing plate.
      <br/>
      Therefore, it is possible to provide a suction tool which is free from the danger that the fingers might be drawn into the gap between the polishing plate and the suction tool.
    </p>
    <p num="56">
      Finally, since the nineteenth configuration of the invention is constructed as described above, when the floor is dry polished without wax by the floor polisher attached to the suction port, it is possible to perform dry polishing while sucking hair, dust and the like from the flooring.
      <br/>
      Further, when the suction port comes in contact with the wall, it exhibits a maximum suction effect.

    <heading>DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
    <p num="58">First Embodiment</p>
    <p num="59">FIGS. 3 through 5 show the first embodiment of the invention; FIG. 3 is a partially cutaway plan view showing a suction tool for an electric vacuum cleaner; FIG. 4 is a vertical sectional side view showing the essential parts thereof; and FIG. 5 is a vertical sectional front view showing the essential parts thereof.</p>
    <p num="60">
      In each figure, 101 designates a suction tool body in which upper and lower casings 101a and 101b abut each other with a bumper 113 in between.
      <br/>
      Attached to the rear opening which is located between butted surfaces of upper and lower casings 101a and 101b is a suction pipe 103.
      <br/>
      Suction tool body 101 and a vacuum cleaner body (not shown) are connected by this suction pipe 103 and an unillustrated hose.
      <br/>
      Lower casing 101b has an elongated left to right lateral suction port 102 opening on its bottom face.
      <br/>
      The interior enclosed by upper and lower casings 101a and 101b is partitioned by partitioning walls 124a and 124b into a suction inflow passage 125 for conducting suction air stream 103a from suction port 102 to suction pipe 103, and a power transmission room 126.
    </p>
    <p num="61">
      Inside suction tool body 101, a motor 104 is assembled in power transmission room 126 and a movable brush 105 which is driven by motor 104 is incorporated in suction inflow passage 125 above suction port 102.
      <br/>
      Movable brush 105 is composed of an elongated left to right lateral base 105a and a number of bristles 105b embedded in the undersurface of the base, and is assembled so that the bristles 105b face suction port 102.
      <br/>
      A support shaft 108 is provided above movable brush 105 and is laterally supported in parallel with movable brush 105, by a pair of bearings 110, 110 which are disposed at the left and right ends.
      <br/>
      Bearings 110 are fitted and fixed to partitioning wall 124a.
      <br/>
      A pair of support plates 109 are integrally fastened at both, the left and right ends of base 105a of movable brush 105.
      <br/>
      The upper end portions of the left and right support plates 109 fit on, and are supported by, support shaft 108 so that the brush can freely sway back and forth.
      <br/>
      A rotatable shaft 112 in parallel with support shaft 108 is fitted and supported at the lower portion of bearing 110, having a pulley 111 fixedly attached at the end facing power transmission room 126.
      <br/>
      A belt 114 is wound between this pulley 111 and another pulley 127 on the shaft of motor 104.
      <br/>
      Shaft 112 has a rotary piece 106 at the other end thereof facing suction inflow passage 125.
      <br/>
      This rotary piece is fixedly attached so as to proximally face the outer end face of support plate 109.
      <br/>
      In this way, the rotation of motor 104 is transmitted via pulley 127, belt 114, pulley 111 and shaft 112 to rotary piece 106.
    </p>
    <p num="62">
      Rotary piece 106 has an offset pin 106a projecting from the end face thereof facing the outer surface of support plate 109, at a position set by a distance `x` off the rotary axis thereof, while support plate 109 has a linear cam slot 109a which extends vertically, on the outer end face thereof so that the front end of offset pin 106 is slidably engaged into cam slot 109.
      <br/>
      As a result, when offset pip 106a is rotated, it reciprocates inside cam slot 109a so that support plate 109 sways back and forth about support shaft 108 in the direction perpendicular to the inflow direction of suction air stream 103a, and therefore movable brush 105 integrated with support plate 109 moves back and forth in the same direction.
    </p>
    <p num="63">
      In the above arrangement, when the vacuum cleaner body (not shown) is activated, dirt and dust is sucked together with the suction air stream from suction port 102 of suction tool 101, and is conducted to the dust collecting chamber in the vacuum cleaner body through suction inflow passage 125, suction pipe 103 and the hose (not shown).
      <br/>
      At this moment, movable brush 105 sways and reciprocates back and forth about support shaft 108 by the operation of motor 104, scrubbing dirt and dust which had settled on the floor surface, so that the thus scrubbed dust and dirt is sucked together with the suction air inflow.
      <br/>
      In this operation, movable brush 105 which sways back and forth about rotary shaft 108 needs less space as compared to the rotational space that was occupied by the conventional rotary brush 40 shown in FIGS. 1 and 2.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, it is possible to make suction tool body 101 compact proportionally.
      <br/>
      Further, this configuration, unlike rotary brush 40, has no risk that the fingers might be drawn into the tool, thus ensuring safer handling.
      <br/>
      In this case, in the limited narrow space inside suction tool body 101, it is possible to reliably and simply change the rotation of motor 104 into the oscillatory motion of movable brush 105 in the back and forth direction, by the combination of offset pin 106a of rotary piece 106 and support plate 109 having cam slot 109a engaged with this offset pin 106a.
      <br/>
      However, other mechanisms can also be used to change the rotation of motor 104 into the oscillatory motion of movable brush 105.
    </p>
    <p num="64">Second Embodiment</p>
    <p num="65">
      FIGS. 6 and 7 show the second embodiment of the invention.
      <br/>
      In this embodiment, a pair of support plates 109 are integrally fastened at the left and right ends of a movable brush 105, and their upper end portions fit on a support shaft 108 so that the support plates can move in the lateral direction along support shaft 108.
      <br/>
      A rotary piece 106 has a slanted cam surface 106b on the end face thereof facing the outer end face of one support plate 109, while a projection 109b is formed from the outer end surface of support plate 109 and the front end of projection 109b is abutted against slanted cam surface 106b.
      <br/>
      An elastic member 107 such as a coil spring, etc., is interposed between the other support plate 109 and a bearing 110 opposite it so as to constantly urge movable brush 105 toward the rotary piece 106 side.
      <br/>
      Thus, the abutment between the front end of projection 109b and slanted cam surface 106b is maintained.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, during one rotation of rotary piece 106, movable brush 105 linearly reciprocates along support shaft 108 in the left and right directions perpendicular to the inflow direction of the suction air stream 103a by the differential distance between the top and bottom of slanted cam surface 106b.
      <br/>
      The other configurations are the same as in the first embodiment.
    </p>
    <p num="66">
      In this embodiment, since movable brush 105 linearly reciprocates in the left and right directions, therefore, as in the case of the first embodiment, this configuration needs less space of motion as compared to the rotational space that was occupied by the conventional rotary brush 40.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, it is possible to make suction tool body 101 compact proportionally.
      <br/>
      Further, this configuration, unlike rotary brush 40, has no risk that the fingers might be drawn into the tool, thus ensuring safer handling.
      <br/>
      In this case, in the limited narrow space inside suction tool body 101, it is possible to definitely and simply change the rotation of motor 104 into the linear motion of movable brush 105, by the combination of slanted cam surface 106b of rotary piece 106 and support plate 109 having projection 109b abutted against this slanted cam surface 106b.
      <br/>
      However, other mechanisms can also be used to change the rotation of motor 104 into the linear motion of movable brush 105.
    </p>
    <p num="67">Third Embodiment</p>
    <p num="68">
      FIGS. 8 and 9 show the third embodiment of the invention.
      <br/>
      In this embodiment, a movable brush 105 has an elongated left to right lateral base 105a: a number of bristles 105b are embedded in one, either top or bottom, side of the base 105a; and a blade 116 is embedded on the other side.
      <br/>
      Movable brush 105 is detachably mounted to, and supported by, a pair of left and right support plates 109, 109.
      <br/>
      Specifically, a tie rod 118 with a lever 118a is provided at the power transmission side of base 105a of movable brush 105, with an elastic member 117 of a coil spring etc., interposed in between, so that the tie rod can move to the left or right.
      <br/>
      A socket 109c is provided on the end face of the support plate 109 facing the tie rod so that tie rod 118 can fit thereinto and be drawn out therefrom.
      <br/>
      Base 105a has a projection 105c at the other end; the front end of this projection 105c is detachably inserted into another socket 109c which is formed on the end face of the other support plate 109 facing the projection.
      <br/>
      Thus, movable brush 105 is connectedly supported between the left and right support plates 109, 109 by means of projection 105c and tie rod 118.
      <br/>
      When lever 118a is shifted so that tie rod 118 moves toward the center in the lateral direction against the elastic force of elastic member 117, the end of tie rod 118 is drawn out from socket 109c.
      <br/>
      So, movable brush 105 can be taken out from the position between left and right support plates 109 and 109.
      <br/>
      Other configurations, such as the mechanism for activating motor 104 to cause movable brush 105 to sway and reciprocate back and forth about support shaft 108, and the like, are the same as those in the first embodiment.
    </p>
    <p num="69">In accordance with this embodiment, depending upon the type of the material on the floor, such as tatami mat (straw matting), carpet, rug, etc., either brush bristles 105b or blade 116 can be selectively used for convenience by detaching the movable brush 105 and reversing it upside down relative to the left and right support plates 109, 109.</p>
    <p num="70">In this connection, this movable brush 105 of the above embodiment can also be applied to the second embodiment where movable brush 105 reciprocates left and right along the support shaft 108.</p>

      <br/>
      Second brush 121 is supported on a support shaft 122 provided in front of, and in parallel to rotary brush 119 so that it can sway back and forth.
      <br/>
      Fixed at one of the ends of rotary brush 119 with respect to the lateral direction is a cam 120 having a projection 120a on part of the peripheral side.
      <br/>
      Second brush 121 has an upward-extending portion above support shaft 122.
      <br/>
      This portion has a projection 121a, against which the peripheral side of cam 120 is abutted.
      <br/>
      Further, an elastic member 123 of a coil spring etc., is interposed between the upper-extending portion of second brush 121 and upper casing 101a so that the elastic force from elastic member 123 constantly presses and urges the upper-extending portion of second brush 121 toward rotary brush 119, thus abutting the end of projection 121a against the peripheral surface of cam 120.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, during one revolution of rotary brush 119, second brush 121 oscillationally swings back and forth about support shaft 122 due to the variation of the height of cam 120 because of projection 120a.

      FIGS. 13 and 14 show the sixth embodiment of the invention; FIG. 13 is a sectional top view showing a suction tool for an electric vacuum cleaner; and FIG. 14 is a sectional side view of it.
      <br/>
      In these figures, 201 designates a suction tool body.
      <br/>
      Attached to the rear opening of the body is a suction pipe 203.
      <br/>
      Suction tool body 201 and a vacuum cleaner body (not shown) are connected by this suction pipe 203 and an unillustrated hose.
      <br/>
      The suction tool body 201 has an elongated left to right lateral suction port 202 opening on its bottom face.
      <br/>
      The interior enclosed is partitioned by partitioning walls 206a and 206b into a suction inflow passage 207 for conducting suction air stream 203a from suction port 202 to suction pipe 203, and a power transmission room 208.
      <br/>
      Inside suction tool body 201, a driver device 204 is provided in power transmission room 208, and a movable brush unit 205 which is driven by driver device 204 is incorporated in suction inflow passage 207 above suction port 202.
    </p>
    <p num="79">The above driver device 204 is made up of a linear motor as schematically shown in FIG. 15, including: a coil 204a of a donut shape affixed on the wall surface of power transmission room 208; a rod 204b fitted through coil 204a; and an annular ferromagnetic body (a magnet) 204c which fits on rod 204b at a position corresponding to coil 204a.</p>
    <p num="80">
      Rod 204b is supported by thrust bearings 204d and 204d at both ends thereof.
      <br/>
      When coil 204a is supplied with an a.c. current, the rod reciprocates left and right in the drawing, due to the magnetic field generated with ferromagnetic body 204c.
    </p>
    <p num="81">
      In movable brush unit 205, 205a designates an oscillator plate made up of a rectangular sheet, and it has a pair of support shafts 205c, 205c projecting from the side faces at both ends.
      <br/>
      These shafts are supported by support plates 209, 209 affixed on the wall surfaces at both sides of suction tool body 201, so that the oscillator plate 205a is arranged in the lateral direction inside suction port 202.
      <br/>
      This oscillator plate 205a is linked with the front end of the aforementioned rod 204b, at a point above support shaft 205c with a linking pin 205b, so that the plate can sway and reciprocate about support shaft 205c following the reciprocating motion of rod 204b.
    </p>
    <p num="82">Seventh Embodiment</p>
    <p num="83">
      FIG. 16 is another variation of the above driver device 204.
      <br/>
      In this embodiment, a rod 204b is fitted through a solenoid 204e.
      <br/>
      This rod 204b is linked at its one end with the aforementioned oscillator plate 205a; the other side of the rod projecting out from solenoid 204e with a loose coil spring 204g interposed between solenoid 204e and a catch 204f fastened at the distal end of the rod.
    </p>
    <p num="84">In the configurations of the sixth and seventh embodiments, when the vacuum cleaner body (not shown) is activated, dirt and dust is sucked together with the suction air stream from suction port 202 of suction tool 201, and is conducted to the dust collecting chamber in the vacuum, cleaner body through suction inflow passage 207, suction pipe 203 and the hose (not shown).</p>
    <p num="85">
      As soon as the vacuum cleaner is activated, coil 204a of the linear motor in the sixth embodiment is supplied with a.c. current, rod 204b slides back and forth to oscillationally drive crank (oscillator plate) 205a, thus a movable brush 205e scrubs dust and dirt which had settled on the floor surface.
      <br/>
      The dirt and dust scrubbed are sucked together with the aforementioned suction air stream.
    </p>
    <p num="86">In the case where driver device 204 is in the form of the seventh embodiment shown in FIG. 16, when solenoid 204e is intermittently energized, rod 204b moves back and forth with the help of the elastic force of coil spring 204g, thus movable brush 205e can scrub dust and dirt which had settled on the floor surface.</p>
    <p num="87">
      In the above way, movable brush 205e which sways back and forth needs less space as compared to the rotational space that was occupied by the conventional rotary brush 40 shown in FIG. 1.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, it is possible to make suction tool body 201 compact proportionally.
      <br/>
      Further, this configuration, unlike rotary brush 40, has no risk that the fingers might be drawn into the tool, thus ensuring safer handling.
      <br/>
      Moreover, conventional vacuum cleaners needed a lot of parts such as pulleys, belts etc., for transmitting the rotation of motor 37 to the rotary brush in order to operate rotary brush 40.
      <br/>
      In contrast, the structure of the invention, needs fewer parts to perform the same operation.

    <p num="89">
      Base part 205g has a movable brush 205e in which bristle bundles are planted at regular intervals along the length.
      <br/>
      Front sweeping part 205i has sweeper ribs 205k formed entirely across the front-side surface at the end portion thereof.
      <br/>
      In this embodiment, as apparent from the drawings, the dimensions of front and rear sweeping parts 205i, 205j, and the bristle bundle of movable brush 205e can be seen: front sweeping part 205i is set longer by `a` than part 205j; and the bristle bundle of movable brush 205e is set longer by `b` than part 205i.
      <br/>
      The former dimensional difference `a` contributes to the improvement in scrubbing efficiency of lint and fluff, while the latter dimensional difference `b` contributes to the prevention of damage to the floor surface when the floor is made up of flooring.

      In the above configuration of movable brush unit 205, when the movable brush 205e of the eighth embodiment shown in FIG. 17 is used to clean the floor surface, only movable brush 205e comes in contact with the floor surface whilst movable brush 205e sways together with crank 205a moved by driver device 204.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the front and rear sweeping parts 205i and 205j will not damage the floor.
      <br/>
      When this unit is used for cleaning carpet etc., front sweeping part: 205i scrubs lint and fluff whilst the front sweeping part 205i sways, improving the cleaning efficiency.

      In this embodiment, a floor polisher assembly is provided in the undersurface of suction tool body 201.
      <br/>
      FIG. 31 shows a suction tool with a floor polisher assembly 210.
      <br/>
      Floor polisher assembly 210 includes: a device frame 210a of a rectangular box with its top open so that it can fit to the lower part of suction tool body 201; a magnet 210c which is fixed to a magnet socket 210b formed in the undersurface of device frame 210a and attached to a steel plate 210d fixed inside suction tool body 201 when device frame 210a is fitted to suction tool body 201; a slider plate 210e which is attached to the lower face of device frame 210a so as to able to be slide back and forth; a pair of engaging plates 210g which are formed upright, one before and the other behind in parallel to one another, on the upper surface of slider plate 210e with their upper ends inserted through a slider orifice 210f as an opening in the bottom face of device frame 210a, into suction tool body 201 so as to engage the lower end of the aforementioned crank 205a; and a polishing material 210h such as sponge, felt, etc., attached to the undersurface of slider plate 210e.
    </p>
    <p num="114">Slider plate 210e has a pair of engaging portions 210i on the upper face at both ends with respect to the length as shown in FIG. 32. Engaging portions 210i are caught by engagement slots 210j, 210j which open in the front to back direction at both ends on the bottom surface of device frame 210a, so that slider plate 210e can slide forwards and backwards in the undersurface of device frame 210a.</p>
    <p num="115">
      Since crank 205a is engaged between engaging plates 210g, 210g, movable brush 205e formed at the lower end of this crank is also located between engaging plates 210g, 210g.
      <br/>
      Provided at the upper front edge of device frame 210a is an engaging portion 210k formed of a bent portion.
      <br/>
      When device frame 210a is attached to suction tool body 201, engaging portion 210k engages the upper front edge of the suction tool body so that it can prevent, in cooperation with the attractive force of magnet 210c, the device frame from coming off.
    </p>
    <p num="116">
      In the above configuration, when the floor polisher assembly is used, floor polisher assembly 210 is attached to suction tool body 201, as shown in the drawing.
      <br/>
      When an unillustrated switch for polishing is turned on, only driver device 204 is energized whilst the motor for suction is inactivated, Following the oscillation of crank 205a with the reciprocating motion of rod 204b, slider plate 210e is made to slide back and forth by means of engaging plates 210g, thus floor polishing material 210h stretched across the undersurface of slider plate 210e can polish the floor surface.
      <br/>
      When the floor polishing is complete, floor polisher assembly 210 can be removed from suction tool body 201.

      FIG. 33 is a view showing a floor polisher assembly (waxing polisher) attached to a suction tool body.
      <br/>
      A vibrating cam 317 is formed at the lower end of the arm plate 313 shown in the eleventh embodiment.
      <br/>
      An abutting projection 319 is formed in a vibrating plate 318 so as to be located opposite vibrating cam 317.
      <br/>
      This vibrating plate 318 is mounted to an attachment frame plate 320, which is attached to suction tool body 301, and the plate 318 has a polishing plate 321 with a polisher cloth 322 attached underneath it.
    </p>
    <p num="119">
      Attachment frame plate 320 is in the form of a rectangular inverted tray-like frame, and has a pair of engaging projections 320a on the inner sides of the front and rear walls.
      <br/>
      These engaging projections 320a engage with engaging recesses 323 of lower casing 301b so as to attach to this lower casing 301b.
      <br/>
      This attachment frame plate 320 has a vibrating plate receptacle 320b therebeneath for receiving the vibrating plate 318.
      <br/>
      A pair of catching portions 320c, 320c for securing both ends of vibrating plate 318 are provided at both ends of attachment frame plate 320, as shown in FIGS. 34 and 35.
    </p>
    <p num="120">
      FIG. 35 most clearly shows the fitted relationship of catching portions 320c, 320c to both ends of vibrating plate 318.
      <br/>
      As is apparent from this figure, an engaging part 318a formed in each end of vibrating plate 318 fits to a corresponding engaging hole 320d of catching portion 320c while an engaging edge 318b at each side of vibrating plate 318 is caught by engaging part 320e of catching portion 320c.
    </p>
    <p num="121">
      In this arrangement, since the height of catching portion 320c is greater than that of vibrating plate 318, vibrating plate 318 can move up and down after the two ends of vibrating plate 318 are fitted to catching portions 320c.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, when vibrating plate 318 is attached to attachment frame plate 320 so that the two ends of plate 318 engage catching portions 320c, the main structure of vibrating plate 318 is held by vibrating plate receptacle 320b.
      <br/>
      Designated at 318d is a cushioning material which is provided inside vibrating plate 318 and is formed of foam rubber.
      <br/>
      This lends itself to prevention of damage to flooring and reduction of noise.
    </p>
    <p num="122">
      Next, the method for attachment of polishing plate 321 to vibrating plate 318 will be explained.
      <br/>
      In this case, first, polishing cloth 322 is attached to polishing plate 321.
      <br/>
      The attachment of polishing cloth 322 is performed by wrapping polishing cloth 322 on polishing plate 321 and fixing two ends of the cloth with a fastening tape 324.
      <br/>
      In this state, as shown in FIGS. 36 through 39, one end 321a of polishing plate 321 is inserted into engaging part 318a of vibrating plate 318.
      <br/>
      When end 321a is fitted in, a spring 318c which is provided inside engaging part 318a as shown in the figure, flexes so as to allow end 321a to enter to some extent in the pressed direction.
    </p>
    <p num="123">
      In this condition, the other end 321b of polishing plate 321 is positioned to the other engaging part 318a of vibrating plate 318, and thereafter the pressure against the pressing portion (designated at 321c) of polishing plate 321 is released.
      <br/>
      Then, the two ends of polishing plate 321 will engage respective engaging parts 318a due to the restoration force of spring 318c so that polishing plate 321 is integrated with vibrating plate 318, thereby permitting the use of the floor polisher assembly.
      <br/>
      Removal of polishing plate 321 can be easily performed by thrusting pressing portion 321c against the repulsive force of spring 318c and then releasing the engagement between end 321b of polishing plate 321 and engaging part 318a.
    </p>
    <p num="124">
      In this way, as suction tool body 301 with the floor polish device attached thereto, is lifted from the floor surface as shown in FIG. 40, both the vibrating plate 318 and polishing plate 321 lower due to gravity, and consequently, abutting projection 319 comes apart from vibrating cam 317 of arm plate 313 so that the motion of vibrating cam 317 will not be transmitted to the polishing plate through abutting projection 319.
      <br/>
      When suction tool body 301 is placed on the floor surface as shown in FIG. 41, the whole weight of the suction tool, acts to push up vibrating plate 318 so that vibrating cam 317 abuts abutting projection 319, thus the motion of vibrating cam 317 is transmitted to polishing plate 321 via abutting projection 319.
    </p>
    <p num="125">
      In the above configuration, when driver device 304 is energized for driving, the driving force is transmitted through driver pulley 306a, belt 309, driven pulley 306b, offset pin 306d and offset link 306e to oscillator means 312, so as to sway the oscillator means 312.
      <br/>
      This oscillation is transmitted to vibrating cam 317 through arm plate 313.
      <br/>
      Then, vibrating cam 317 thrusts abutting projection 319 as arm plate 313 sways.
      <br/>
      Vibrating plate 318, receiving the interactive action between the weight of suction tool 301 and thrusting force of vibrating cam 317, moves (vibrates) up and down within attachment frame plate 320, whereby the floor surface is polished by polishing cloth 322.

      FIG. 42 is a variation of FIG. 33, showing the embodiment of a floor polisher assembly in which a suction inflow channel (indicated by broken line 90) which communicates with suction port 302 of suction tool is provided.
      <br/>
      In FIG. 42, like reference numerals are allotted to the same components as in FIG. 33. In accordance with the configuration of FIG. 42, when the floor is dry polished without wax by the floor polisher assembly attached to the suction port, it is possible to perform dry polishing while sucking hair, dust and the like from the flooring.
      <br/>
      Further, when the suction port comes in contact with the wall, it exhibits a maximum suction effect.

    <p num="127">As has been seen in the above embodiments, the present invention has the following effects.</p>
    <p num="128">
      In accordance with the first and second features of the invention, since movable brush needs less space for operation as compared to the rotational space that was occupied by the conventional rotary brush, it is possible to reduce suction tool body proportionally.
      <br/>
      Further, this configuration can be used in safety, i.e., it has no risk of danger that the fingers might be drawn into the tool, unlike the case of rotary brush.
    </p>
    <p num="129">In accordance with third feature of the invention, depending upon the type of the material on the floor, either brush bristles or a blade can be selectively used for convenience by detaching a single movable brush and reversing it upside down.</p>
    <p num="130">In accordance with the fourth and fifth features of the invention, the dust and dirt in front of, or at the side of, the rotary brush, that is, in the area which cannot be reached by the conventional rotary brush, can be scrubbed by the second brush, thus it is possible to further improve the effect of collecting dust.</p>

    <p num="132">
      As a result, in accordance with this invention, the provision of only a movable brush which simply oscillates is so effective that it is possible to make the suction tool compact as compared to the conventional brush which was rotated.

      <br/>
      This configuration needs very few parts, so that a further reduction in size can be expected.
      <br/>
      Further, the provision of a sweeping member enables lint and fluff adhering to carpet etc., to be scrubbed efficiently, thus enhancing cleaning efficiency.
    </p>
    <p num="138">
      Next, the suction tool for an electric vacuum cleaner in accordance with the tenth feature includes: a suction tool body which is connected to the vacuum cleaner body and has a suction inflow passage therein for conducting a suction air stream from a suction port opening on the bottom face thereof, to the vacuum cleaner body; and a movable brush unit which is provided in the middle of the suction inflow passage inside the suction tool body and reciprocates back and forth by a driver device.
      <br/>
      The movable brush unit is composed of a unit base frame extending along the suction port and a movable brush assembly attached to the unit base frame, and the movable brush assembly is composed of a sweeping member which is made from a rubber material and includes a base part which fits into the unit base frame, a pair of front and rear sweeping parts which extend downward in parallel to one another with a gap therebetween, from the lower side of the base part, and a movable brush embedded in the gap, wherein the front sweeping part is shorter than the rear sweeping part.
    </p>
    <p num="139">
      In accordance with this invention, the movable brush unit is swayed and reciprocated by the operation of the driver device so that the movable brush and sweeping member of the movable brush unit performs cleaning.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, the provision of only a movable brush which simply oscillates is so effective that it is possible to make the suction tool compact as compared to the conventional brush which was rotated.
      <br/>
      Still more, since the front sweeping part is formed shorter than the rear sweeping part, the structure enables lint and fluff adhering to carpet etc., to be scrubbed efficiently, thus enhancing cleaning efficiency.
    </p>
    <p num="140">
      In the suction tool for an electric vacuum cleaner according to the eleventh feature of the invention, the pivotal shaft of the movable brush unit is supported through an anti-vibration mechanism.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, in accordance with the invention, during the operation of the movable brush unit, cleaning is performed whilst vibrations are absorbed by the anti-vibration mechanism.
      <br/>
      Thus, if the movable brush unit vibrates, the vibration can be alleviated so as not to be transmitted to the whole part of the suction tool.
      <br/>
      Therefore, it is possible to provide an electric vacuum cleaner having good handling, in which the vibration will not spread to the hands of the user.

    <p num="141">The suction tool for an electric vacuum cleaner in accordance with the twelfth feature of the invention, includes: a suction tool body which is connected to the vacuum cleaner body and has a suction inflow passage therein for conducting a suction air stream from a suction port opening on the bottom face thereof, to the vacuum cleaner body; and a movable brush unit which is provided in the middle of the suction inflow passage inside the suction tool body and reciprocates back and forth by a driver device, and the movable brush unit is composed of a unit base frame extending along the suction port and a movable brush assembly attached to the unit base frame while the movable brush assembly is composed of a sweeping member which is made from a rubber material and includes a base part which fits into the unit base frame, a pair of front and rear sweeping parts which extend downward in parallel to one another with a gap therebetween, from the lower side of the base part, and a movable brush embedded in the gap, wherein the movable brush is impregnated with liquid paraffin.</p>
    <p num="142">Thus, since the movable brush is impregnated with liquid paraffin, this feature can offer a simple floor polishing effect for the flooring.</p>
    <p num="143">
      The thirteenth configuration of the invention, further comprises an angular motion regulatory mechanism for regulating the reciprocating motion of the movable brush about the pivotal shaft.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, the vibration of the movable brush as well as deformation of the unit base frame is inhibited during the swaying and reciprocating motion, thus making it possible to obtain a reliable sweeping effect of the movable brush.
    </p>
    <p num="144">
      In the suction tool for an electric vacuum cleaner in accordance with the fourteenth feature of the invention, the angular motion regulatory mechanism has such a structure that a rotary member fixed to the pivotal shaft is angularly restricted by an immovable member, and a leaf spring is interposed between the rotary member and the immovable member so that braking force is generated through the leaf spring within the range in which the rotary member is movable.
      <br/>
      As a result, it is possible to reliably inhibit the vibration of the movable brushing unit by an inexpensive method.
    </p>
    <p num="145">Further, the suction tool for an electric vacuum cleaner in accordance with the fifteenth feature of the invention, includes: a suction tool body which is connected to the vacuum cleaner body and has a suction inflow passage therein for conducting a suction air stream from a suction port opening on the bottom face thereof, to the vacuum cleaner body; a floor polisher assembly which is attached to the lower side of the suction tool body so as to slide back and forth; a linear motor or solenoid for reciprocating a rod provided inside the suction tool body; a transmission device which transmits the motion of the rod to the floor polisher assembly so as to reciprocate the floor polisher assembly back and froth in the undersurface of the suction tool body, following the reciprocating motion of the rod due to the linear motor or solenoid.</p>

    <p num="148">
      Therefore, in accordance with this invention, the polisher cloth polishes the floor surface whilst the polishing plate vibrates up and down, so that it is possible to polish the floor surface without strongly rubbing it.

    <p num="151">
      In accordance with this invention, the vibrating cam becomes mechanically linked with the polishing plate so that the motion of the vibrating cam can be transmitted to the polishing plate so to vibrate only when the suction tool body is placed on the floor surface.

      As a result, when the suction tool body is lifted, in other words, when the user lifts up the suction tool body for transfer, or any other reason, the vibrating cam is not mechanically linked with the polishing plate.
      <br/>
      Therefore, it is possible to provide a suction tool which is free from the danger that the fingers might be drawn into the gap between the polishing plate and the suction tool.
