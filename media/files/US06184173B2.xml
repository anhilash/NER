      The wavelength  LAMBDA  of the X-radiation used for the diffraction and the diffraction angle .crclbar. are related to one another by the Bragg relationship:
      <br/>
      2 sin.crclbar.= LAMBDA /d,
    </p>
    <p num="8">where d is the interplanar spacing of the three-dimensional atomic arrangement, associated with the respective diffraction line.</p>
    <p num="9">Furthermore, the present invention relates to a process for the preparation of multimetal oxides I and their direct use as active material of catalysts for the catalytic gas-phase oxidation of organic compounds.</p>
    <p num="10">The present invention also relates to the use of multimetal oxides I as starting compounds for the preparation of multimetal oxide materials which contain Mo and V and in turn are suitable as active material for the catalytic gas-phase oxidation of organic compounds.</p>
    <p num="11">The preparation of multimetal oxide materials containing Mo and V and their use as active materials of catalysts for the catalytic gas-phase oxidation of organic compounds (eg. acrolein to acrylic acid) is generally known (eg. EP-A 293 859).</p>
    <p num="12">
      Initially, the preparation of such multimetal oxide materials containing Mo and V was carried out by providing a suitable source (starting compound) of each of their elemental constituents, producing from the total amount of these sources a very thorough, preferably finely divided dry mixture having a composition corresponding to the required stoichiometry of the desired multimetal oxide material and calcining said dry mixture at elevated temperatures for several hours under inert gas or under an oxygen-containing gas (eg. air) (single-vessel process).
      <br/>
      All that was important with regard to the sources of the elemental constituents of the multimetal oxide materials was that they were either already oxides or compounds convertible into oxides by heating, at least in the presence of oxygen (cf. for example DE-A 4 335 973 and U.S. Pat. No. 4,035,262).
    </p>
    <p num="13">It is now known (cf. for example EP-A 835, DE-C 3 338 380, DE-A 4 220 859, DE-A 4 307 381, DE-A 4 405 085, DE-A 4 405 059, DE-A 4 405 060, DE-A 4 405 514 and DE-A 44 404 891) that it may be advantageous first to preform separately a multimetal oxide comprising only a fraction of the total amount of the elemental constituents of the desired multimetal oxide material and then to use this separately preformed fractional multimetal oxide as a finely divided source for producing the desired multimetal oxide material.</p>
    <p num="14">As a rule, this results in multimetal oxide materials which have a multiphase composition and some of which are more advantageous for the catalytic gas-phase oxidation of organic compounds than the multimetal oxide materials prepared by the single-vessel processes known per se.</p>
    <p num="15">It is an object of the present invention to provide novel fractional metal oxides of multimetal oxide materials containing Mo and V, which multimetal oxide material can be used as starting compounds for the preparation of multiphase multimetal oxide materials which contain Mo and V and are particularly suitable as active material for the gas-phase catalytic oxidation of acrolein to acrylic acid.</p>
    <p num="16">
      We have found that this object is achieved by the multimetal oxides I defined at the outset.
      <br/>
      Advantageous multimetal oxides I include those in which x is from 15 to 50. x is preferably from 25 to 40, particularly preferably from 30 to 40.
      <br/>
      Other suitable multimetal oxides I include those in which c is 0.
      <br/>
      Where c is 0 and M1 is exclusively W, suitable multimetal oxides I are those in which  &gt;= 25 or  &gt;= 50 or  &gt;= 75 or  &gt;= 95 or  &gt;= 99% of the vanadium is present as V4+.
    </p>
    <p num="17">Typical of the novel multimetal oxides I is that their X-ray powder diffraction spectrum obtained using CuK ALPHA  radiation in the 2.crclbar. range from 5 (degree)  to 50 (degree)  as a characteristic fingerprint contains at least the diffraction lines A1, A3, A5, A9 and A10 but on no account more than the diffraction lines A1, A2, A3, A4, A5, A6, A7, A8, A9 and A10.</p>
    <p num="18">
      It is noteworthy that some of the diffraction lines are those which have a relatively large half-width FWHM (the width of the diffraction line (the intensity plotted as a function of 2.crclbar.) at half the height of their maximum amplitude, stated in the unit for angles in a plane), reflecting an unusual pattern of short-range and long-range order in the novel multimetal oxides I (cf. Examples).
      <br/>
      In the author's opinion, this particular pattern of short-range and long-range order is responsible, inter alia, for the particular catalytic properties of the novel multimetal oxides I.
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      Owing to the particular half-width conditions, the X-ray powder diffraction spectrum of the novel multimetal oxides I does not contain the diffraction lines Ai in completely resolved form.
      <br/>
      However, the presence of the multiplicity of diffraction lines Ai (after subtraction of the linear background) is directly visually evident as a relative maximum in the envelope of the X-ray powder diffraction spectrum of the novel multimetal oxides I, the position of these relative maxima defining, in this publication, the position of the diffraction lines Ai according to the claims.
    </p>
    <p num="20">After subtraction of the linear background (the connecting line between A(2.crclbar. =5 (degree) ) and A(2.crclbar. =65 (degree) )), the following relative line intensities (IArel =(I/Io) * 100%), based on the most intense of the diffraction lines A1 to A10, can be furthermore assigned to these diffraction lines A1 to A10, the amplitude, measured from the base line to the relative maximum, being used as a measure of the intensity:</p>

    </p>
    <p num="22">With regard to this line intensity data, it should be noted that, in contrast to the position of the lines, the relative line intensities are markedly influenced in a manner known per se to a person skilled in the art by the individual crystal orientations obtained in various powder preparations and based on the anisotropy of the crystal form and are therefore of little significance for identification of the novel multimetal oxides.</p>
    <p num="23">In this connection, it should be stated that observation has shown that a further characteristic of the CuK ALPHA  X-ray powder diffraction spectrum of the novel multimetal oxides I appears to be the fact that it generally contains no diffraction lines whose FWHM&lt;0.25 (degree) .</p>
    <p num="24">
      In all embodiments, the X-ray powder diffraction spectrum was recorded by means of a Siemens D-5000 diffractometer using CuK ALPHA  radiation (40 kV, 30 mA,  LAMBDA =1.54178  Angstrom ).
      <br/>
      The diffractometer was equipped with an automatic primary and secondary collimator and with a graphite secondary monochromator.
    </p>
    <p num="25">It is of course possible to resolve the X-ray powder diffraction spectrum of the multimetal oxides I, and hence to produce an alternative characterization of said spectrum, by subtracting the linear background and then, under the boundary condition of a minimum mean square deviation, describing the experimental diffraction spectrum (its envelope) by a mathematical function and converting it by resolution into a superposition of separately resolved lines A1* to A10*. The maximum of each of the resolved lines defines their line position.</p>
    <p num="26">The resolution of the X-ray powder diffraction spectra, as described above, was carried out using the 1994 version of the software package DIFFRAC-AT V 3.2/PROFILE supplied by Siemens, the resolution and fitting being carried out on the basis of the Pearson VII form function.</p>
    <p num="27">
      While the presence of the diffraction lines A2, A4 and A6 to A8 in the CuK ALPHA  X-ray powder diffraction spectra of the novel multimetal oxides I on the basis of an exclusively visual consideration of their envelope entails a certain degree of uncertainty in some cases and may therefore be contentious (cf. Example), their mathematical resolution produced as described above generally unambiguously indicates diffraction lines A2*, A4*, A6* and A7* (cf. Example), whereas it does not require a diffraction line A8*. Both methods of characterization (piece of information) together therefore require the definition, according to the claims, of the subject of the invention.
      <br/>
      On the other hand, when exclusively mathematically resolved, the CuK ALPHA  X-ray powder diffraction spectrum of the novel multimetal oxides I can as a rule be characterized as follows:

    <p num="31">The novel multimetal oxides I are obtainable in a simple manner by producing, from suitable sources of their elemental constituents, a very thorough, preferably finely divided, dry mixture which corresponds to the desired stoichiometry, and calcining this mixture at from 300 to 500 (degree)  C. The key to obtaining the novel multimetal oxides I is the redox character of the calcination atmosphere, which must not be too oxidizing and must not be too reducing.</p>
    <p num="32">
      It is not possible to provide generally valid quantitative data with regard to the required redox character of the calcination atmosphere.
      <br/>
      Thus, on the one hand the required redox character varies with the chosen stoichiometry and on the other hand, for example, the opposite ions (eg. NH4.sym.) of the chosen sources of the elemental constituents also contribute to the redox character of the calcination atmosphere, for example when they are decomposed during the calcination.
      <br/>
      By exploratory preliminary experiments, a person skilled in the art can, however, determine the required redox character of the calcination atmosphere.
    </p>
    <p num="33">For controlling the redox character of the calcination atmosphere, a person skilled in the art has available, for example, N2 and/or noble gases, as inert gases, for example ammonia, hydrogen, lower molecular weight aldehyde and/or hydrocarbons as reducing gases and oxygen (generally in the form of air) as an oxidizing gas.</p>
    <p num="34">
      All that is important with regard to the elemental sources is that they are either already oxides or are compounds which can be converted into oxides by heating, at least in the presence of oxygen.
      <br/>
      In addition to the oxides, particularly suitable starting compounds are therefore halides, nitrates, formates, citrates, oxalates, acetates, carbonates and hydroxides.
      <br/>
      Suitable starting compounds of Mo, V, W and Nb are also their oxo compounds (molybdates, vanadates, tungstates and niobates), which as a rule have NH4.sym. as the opposite ion, which, on heating, liberates NH3 having a reducing action.
      <br/>
      The acids derived from these oxo compounds are of course also suitable as possible starting compounds.
      <br/>
      In addition, compounds such as ammonium acetate and ammonium nitrate are frequently added to the elemental sources and act as pore formers during the calcination and also influence the redox character of the calcination atmosphere.
    </p>
    <p num="35">
      The thorough mixing of the starting compounds in the preparation of multimetal oxides I can be carried out in dry or wet form.
      <br/>
      If it is effected in dry form, the starting compounds are advantageously used as finely divided powders and are subjected to calcination after mixing and, if required, compaction.
      <br/>
      However, the thorough mixing is preferably carried out in the wet form.
      <br/>
      Usually, the starting compounds are mixed with one another in the form of an aqueous solution and/or suspension.
      <br/>
      The aqueous material is then dried and is calcined after drying.
      <br/>
      The drying process is preferably carried out immediately after the preparation of the aqueous mixture and by spray drying (the entry temperature is as a rule from 250 to 350 (degree)  C. and the outlet temperatures are usually from 100 to 150 (degree)  C.).
    </p>
    <p num="36">
      Interestingly, the novel multimetal oxides I as such are suitable as active material of catalysts for the gas-phase catalytic oxidation of organic compounds, such as alkanes, alkanols, alkenes, alkanals, alkenals and alkenols of 3 to 6 carbon atoms (eg. propylene, methacrolein, tert-butanol, methyl ester of tert-butanol, isobutene, isobutane or isobutyraldehyde), to olefinically unsaturated aldehydes and/or carboxylic acids, and to the corresponding nitriles (ammoxidation, especially of propene to acrylonitrile and of isobutene or tert-butanol to methacrylonitrile).
      <br/>
      The preparation of acrolein, methacrolein and methacrylic acid may be mentioned by way of example.
      <br/>
      They are also suitable as catalyst active materials for the oxidative dehydrogenation of olefinic compounds.
    </p>
    <p num="37">Without a doubt, the multimetal oxides I are particularly suitable as active material of catalysts for the gas-phase catalytic oxidation of acrolein to acrylic acid, its high activity being particularly striking with regard to this reaction.</p>
    <p num="38">
      When the novel multimetal oxide materials are used as active material of catalysts for the gas-phase catalytic oxidation of organic compounds, in particular acrolein to acrylic acid, shaping to achieve the desired catalyst geometry is preferably carried out by application to premolded inert catalyst carriers, before or after the final calcination.
      <br/>
      The usual carriers, such as porous or nonporous aluminas, silica, thorium dioxide, zirconium dioxide, silicon carbide or silicates, such as magnesium silicate or aluminum silicate, may be used.
      <br/>
      The carrier elements may be regularly or irregularly shaped, regularly shaped carrier elements having pronounced surface roughness, for example spheres or hollow cylinders, being preferred.
      <br/>
      Among these in turn, spheres are particularly advantageous.
      <br/>
      The use of essentially nonporous, spherical carriers having surface roughness and comprising steatite, whose diameter is from 1 to 6 mm, preferably from 4 to 5 mm, is particularly advantageous.
      <br/>
      The layer thickness of the active material is advantageously chosen in the range from 50 to 500  MU m, preferably from 150 to 250  MU m. It should be pointed out here that, in the preparation of such coated catalysts, the powder material to be applied is generally moistened for coating of the carrier elements and is dried again after application, for example by means of hot air.
    </p>
    <p num="39">
      For the preparation of the coated catalysts, the coating of the carrier elements is as a rule carried out in a suitable rotatable container, as disclosed, for example, in DE-A 2 909 671 or EP-A 293 859.
      <br/>
      As a rule, the relevant material is calcined before the carrier is coated.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, the catalytically active material is milled to a particle diameter of from &gt;0 to 300  MU m, preferably from 0.1 to 200  MU m, particularly preferably from 0.5 to 50  MU m, before the coating process is carried out.
      <br/>
      The coating and calcination process can also be carried out in a suitable manner according to EP-A 293 859, so that the resulting multimetal oxide I layers have a specific surface area of from 0.50 to 150 m2 /g, a specific pore volume of from 0.10 to 0.90 cm3 /g and a pore diameter distribution such that at least 10% of the total pore volume are accounted for by each of the diameter ranges from 0.1 to &lt;1  MU m, from 1.0 to &lt;10  MU m and from 10  MU m to 100  MU m. The pore diameter distributions stated as being preferred in EP-A 293 859 may also be established.
    </p>
    <p num="40">
      The novel multimetal oxides I can of course also be used as unsupported catalysts.
      <br/>
      In this context, the thorough dry mixture comprising the starting compounds of the multimetal oxide I is preferably compacted immediately to give the desired catalyst geometry (for example, pelletizing or extrusion), it being possible, if required, to add conventional assistants, eg. graphite or stearic acid, as lubricants and/or molding aids and reinforcing agents, such as microfibers of glass, asbestos, silicon carbide or potassium titanate, and calcination is effected.
      <br/>
      Here too, calcination can generally be carried out prior to the shaping procedure.
    </p>
    <p num="41">A preferred geometry of unsupported catalysts comprises hollow cylinders having an external diameter and a length of from 2 to 10 mm and a wall thickness of from 1 to 3 mm.</p>
    <p num="42">
      For the catalytic gas-phase oxidation of acrolein to acrylic acid using the novel multimetal oxides I as catalyst active material, acrolein produced by the catalytic gas-phase oxidation of propene is usually used.
      <br/>
      As a rule, the acrolein-containing reaction gases from this propene oxidation are used without intermediate purification.
      <br/>
      The gas-phase catalytic oxidation of acrolein is usually carried out in tube-bundle reactors, as a heterogeneous fixed-bed oxidation.
      <br/>
      Oxygen, advantageously diluted with inert gases (for example in the form of air), is used as the oxidizing agent in a manner known per se.
      <br/>
      Suitable diluents are, for example, N2, CO2, hydrocarbons, such as methane, ethane, propane, butane and/or pentane, recycled reaction exit gases and/or steam.
      <br/>
      As a rule, an acrolein:oxygen:steam:inert gas volume ratio of 1:(1 to 3):(0 to 20):(3 to 30), preferably 1:(1 to 3):(0,5 to 10) (7 to 18), is established in the acrolein oxidation.
      <br/>
      The reaction pressure is in general from 1 to 3 bar and the total space velocity is preferably from 1000 to 3500 l (S.T.P.) per 1 per h. Typical multitube fixed-bed reactors are described, for example, in DE-A 2 830 765, DE-A 2 201 528 or U.S. Pat. No. 3 147 084. The reaction temperature is usually chosen so that the acrolein conversion in a single pass is above 90%, preferably above 98%.
      <br/>
      Usually, reaction temperatures of from 230 to 330 (degree)  C. are required in this connection.
    </p>
    <p num="43">It is noteworthy that, in the gas-phase catalytic oxidation of acrolein to acrylic acid, the novel multimetal oxides I have not only a high activity but also a surprisingly short forming time, ie. if a tube-bundle reactor loaded with the novel multimetal oxides I is operated under the abovementioned conditions using an acrolein-containing gas stream for the purpose of the oxidative formation of acrylic acid, the selectivity of the acrylic acid formation reaches its plateau value within a shorter operating time. with regard to this plateau value, the preparation of the novel multimetal oxide materials exhibits higher reproducibility.</p>
    <p num="44">
      However, the multimetal oxides I begin fully to display their potential as catalyst active material for the catalytic gas-phase oxidation of organic compounds, in particular of acrolein to acrylic acid, while retaining the abovementioned advantages, only when they are diluted with multimetal oxides of the general formula II

      In the simplest procedure for the preparation of such multimetal oxide materials III, the multimetal oxides I and II are each preformed separately, and a thorough dry mixture is then produced from at least one finely divided, separately preformed multimetal oxide I and at least one finely divided, separately preformed multimetal oxide II in the desired ratio (the thorough mixing can be carried out in dry or wet form; if it is effected in wet, as a rule aqueous, form, drying is carried out subsequently; the mixing can be carried out by means of a kneader or mixer), from which dry mixture suitable catalysts for the catalytic gas-phase oxidation of organic compounds, in particular that of acrolein to acrylic acid, can then be produced in a manner corresponding to that described for the multimetal oxide I alone, by shaping.
      <br/>
      However, both the multimetal oxides I and the multimetal oxide materials III can of course also be used in powder form as catalysts.
      <br/>
      It is just as self evident that the multimetal oxide materials III can be used for all those catalytic gas-phase reactions for which the multimetal oxides I were also stated as being suitable.
      <br/>
      If catalysts based on multimetal oxide materials III as active material are used for the catalytic gas-phase oxidation of acrolein to acrylic acid, this is generally effected under the same process conditions as described for the corresponding use of the multimetal oxide I catalysts alone.
    </p>
    <p num="54">
      The multimetal oxides II can be prepared in a simple manner know per se to a person skilled in the art, for example by producing a very thorough, preferably finely divided, dry mixture from suitable sources of their elemental constituents and calcining this dry mixture at from 200 to 1000 (degree)  C., frequently from 250 to 600 (degree)  C., often from 300 to 500 (degree)  C., it being possible to carry out the calcination under inert gas (eg. N2, a mixture of inert gas and oxygen (eg. air), reducing gases, such as hydrocarbons (eg. methane), aldehydes (eg. acrolein) or ammonia, but also under a mixture of O2 and reducing gases (eg. all of the abovementioned ones), as described, for example, in DE-A 4 335 973.
      <br/>
      It is noteworthy that the calcination atmosphere here may also comprise steam.
      <br/>
      In the case of a calcination under reducing conditions, should be noted that the metallic constituents are not reduced the element.
      <br/>
      The calcination time generally decreases with increasing calcination temperature.
    </p>
    <p num="55">
      Essentially the same statements as those made for the sources of the elemental constituents of the multimetal oxides I are applicable with regard to the sources of the elemental constituents of the multimetal oxides II.
      <br/>
      Here too, all that is essential is that they are either oxides or compounds which can be converted into oxides by heating, at least in the presence of oxygen.
      <br/>
      In a preferred preparation method for the multimetal oxides II, the thermal treatment of the thorough mixture of the starting compounds used is carried out in an autoclave in the presence of steam under superatmospheric pressure at from &gt;100 to 600 (degree)  C.

    <p num="56">
      Depending on the chosen calcination conditions, the resulting multimetal oxides II have different three-dimensional atomic arrangements.

No. 4,035,262, DE-A 4 405 058, DE-A 4 405 059, DE-A 4 405 060, DE-A 4 405 514, DE-A 4 440 891 and DE-A 19 528 646.</p>
    <p num="76">For this purpose, for example, the active materials described there are mixed in finely divided form with finely divided multimetal oxides I in a simple manner and are shaped in the way as the thorough starting mixture for the preparation of catylysts comprising multimetal oxide materials III.</p>
    <p num="77">The multimetal oxides I are particularly suitable as a component of the co-phases of the multiphase catalysts comprising multitimetal oxide materials and disclosed in DE-A 4 405 058,</p>

      DE-A 4 405 059, DE-A 4 405 060, DE-A 4 405 514 and DE-A 4 440 891.
      <br/>
      The multimetal oxides I are furthermore suitable as a component of the active phase of the multiphase catalysts of DE-A 19 528 646 which comprise multimetal oxide materials.
      <br/>
      In all these cases, multiphase catalysts which comprise multimetal oxide materials and contain phases comprising multimetal oxides I in finely divided (from &gt;0 to 300  MU m) homogeneous distribution are formed.

      They are particularly suitable as catalysts for the catalytic gas-phase oxidations of organic compounds, which oxidations are stated in the respective cited publications.

    <p num="80">1) Preparation and Identification of Novel Multimetal Oxides MI1 to MI9 and Comparative Multimetal Oxides VMI1 and VMI2 General Aspects</p>
    <p num="81">
      The novel multimetal oxides I described below all contain the elemental constituents Mo and W in the oxidation state +6.
      <br/>
      On the other hand, the oxidation state of the elemental constituent V is as a rule a distribution over its possible oxidation stage V3+, V4+ and V5+. It was possible to determine this distribution by titrimetric analysis with potentiometric endpoint indication (combined platinum electrode and potentiograph from Metrohm, 9100 Herisau, Switzerland), it being necesssary to effect the procedure under an inert gas atmosphere.
      <br/>
      Carrying out the titration at 80 (degree)  C. facilitated the endpoint detection.
      <br/>
      In other respects, the potentiometric analysis was as follows in all cases:
    </p>
    <p num="82">
      In each case 0.15 g of the oxidic sample material was dissolved in a mixture of 5 ml of concentrated phosphoric acid (density  RHO  at 20 (degree)  C.=1.70 q/cm3) and 10 ml of aqueous sulfuric acid with heating (argon atmosphere), the aqueous sulfuric acid solution used in turn being a mixture of equal volumes of water and concentrated sulfuric acid ( RHO 20 =1.52 g/cm3) (the stated volumes relate to 20 (degree)  C.).
      <br/>
      The solvent was chosen so that it did not change the possible oxidation states of V, which was checked by means of appropriate V standards.
    </p>
    <p num="83">
      For the analytical determination of the V5+ content, the freshly prepared resulting solution was titrated with a 0.1 molar aqueous ammonium ferrous sulfate standard solution ((NH4)2 Fe(SO4)2).
      <br/>
      For the analytical determination of V3+ and V4+, a fresh solution prepared in a corresponding manner was titrated with a freshly prepared 0.02 molar aqueous potassium permanganate standard solution (KMnO4), two potential jumps occurring (V3+ --&gt; V4+ and V4+ --&gt; V5+).
      <br/>
      The sum of the V3+, V4+ and V5+ contents determined as described had to correspond to the total V content of the sample.
      <br/>
      This too could be determined by titrimetric analysis with potentiometric endpoint indications.
    </p>
    <p num="84">
      For this purpose, 0.15 g of the oxidic sample material was dissolved in a mixture of 10 ml of the abovementioned semiconcentrated aqueous sulfuric acid and 10 ml of concentrated nitric acid ( RHO 20 =1.52 g/cm3) with heating (argon atmosphere).
      <br/>
      Thereafter, the solution obtained was concentrated by heating with evaporation of the nitric acid and of some of the sulfuric acid used to a residual volume of about 3 ml, the total V content being converted in the oxidation state +5.
      <br/>
      After cooling, the residual volume was diluted to 50 ml and the V5+ present was titrated potentiometrically with a 0.1 molar aqueous (NH4)2 Fe(SO4)2 standard solution to beyond the equivalence point (endpoint).
    </p>
    <p num="85">
      The aqueous solution thus obtained was titrated with a freshly prepared 0.02 molar aqueous potassium permanganate standard solution, two potential jumps occurring.
      <br/>
      The first potential jump indicated the excess of Fe2+ used, and the second potential jump gave the amount of KMnO4 which was required for the oxidation of V4+ to V5+ and which corresponds to the total V content of the sample.

      A spray-dried powder was produced as for MI3. 60 g of the spray-dried powder were then calcined in a horizontal rotary kiln with an isothermally heated quartz bulb volume of 1 l and a rotary speed of 12 revolutions per minute under the conditions defined below.
      <br/>
      The powder used was heated from 25 to 275 (degree)  C. within 50 minutes in a first step, continuously heated from 275 to 325 (degree)  C. within 30 minutes in a second step immediately after the first step, kept at 325 (degree)  C. for 3 hours in a third step immediately after the second step and heated from 325 to 400 (degree)  C. within 90 minutes in a fourth step immediately after the third step and then kept at 400 (degree)  C. for 10 minutes.
      <br/>
      During the first 3 steps, a gas mixture consisting of 4.8 l (S.T.P.)/h of air, 1.5 l (S.T.P.)/h of NH3 and 43.7 l (S.T.P.)/h of N2 flowed through the quartz bulb (total gas flow: 50 l (S.T.P.)/h).

      During the fourth and fifth steps, a gas mixture consisting of 4.8 l (S.T.P.)/h of air and 43.7 l (S.T.P.)/h of N2 flowed through the quartz bulb (total gas flow: 48.5 l (S.T.P.)/h).
      <br/>
      After the end of the fifth step, the external heating of the rotary kiln was switched off and cooling was effected by blowing on air from the outside.
