      A system and method for discriminating cardiac rhythms occurring in an antegrade direction from cardiac rhythms occurring in a retrograde direction.
      <br/>
      Atrial and ventricular contractions are sensed, from which atrial and ventricular cycle lengths are determined.
      <br/>
      Ventricular contractions are also analyzed to determine the occurrence of a tachycardia episode that has a one-to-one association of atrial contractions to ventricular contractions.
      <br/>
      During a tachycardia episode having a one-to-one association of atrial contractions to ventricular contractions, the atrial cycle lengths are paired with the ventricular cycle lengths, where for each of the atrial cycle lengths the atrial cycle length is paired with at least one ventricular cycle length started before the first atrial contraction of each of the atrial cycle lengths and paired with at least one ventricular cycle length started after the first atrial contraction of each of the atrial cycle lengths.
      <br/>
      A retrograde correlation coefficient is then determined for the atrial cycle lengths paired with the ventricular cycle lengths started before the first atrial contraction, and an antegrade correlation coefficient is determined for the atrial cycle lengths paired with the ventricular cycle lengths started after the first atrial contraction.
      <br/>
      The tachycardiac episode is then classified based on a comparison of the antegrade correlation coefficient and the retrograde correlation coefficient.

    <heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="1">The present invention relates generally to implantable medical devices and more particularly to a system and method for discriminating cardiac rhythms occurring in an antegrade direction from cardiac rhythms occurring in a retrograde direction.</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND</heading>
    <p num="2">
      The heart is generally divided into two chambers, the atrial chamber and the ventricular chamber.
      <br/>
      As the heart beats, the atrial chamber and the ventricular chamber of the heart go through a cardiac cycle.
      <br/>
      The cardiac cycle consists of one complete sequence of contraction and relaxation of the chambers of the heart.
      <br/>
      The terms systole and diastole are used to describe the contraction and relaxation phases the chambers of the heart experience during a cardiac cycle.
      <br/>
      In systole, the ventricular muscle cells are contracting to pump blood through the circulatory system.
      <br/>
      During diastole, the ventricular muscle cells relax, causing blood from the atrial chamber to fill the ventricular chamber.
      <br/>
      After the period of diastolic filling, the systolic phase of a new cardiac cycle is initiated.
    </p>
    <p num="3">
      Control over the timing and order of the atrial and ventricular contractions during the cardiac cycle is critical for the heart to pump blood efficiently.
      <br/>
      Efficient pumping action of the heart requires precise coordination of the contraction of individual cardiac muscle cells.
      <br/>
      Contraction of each cell is triggered when an electrical excitatory impulse (an "action potential") sweeps over the heart.
      <br/>
      Proper coordination of the contractual activity of the individual cardiac muscle cells is achieved primarily by the conduction of the action potential from one cell to the next by gap junctions that connect all cells of the heart into a functional system.
      <br/>
      In addition, muscle cells in certain areas of the heart are specifically adapted to control the frequency of cardiac excitation, the pathway of conduction and the rate of impulse propagation through various regions of the heart.
      <br/>
      The major components of this specialized excitation and conduction system include the sinoatrial node (SA node), the atrioventricular node (AV node), the bundle of His, and specialized cells called Purkinje fibers.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      The SA node is located at the junction of the superior vena cava and the right atrium.
      <br/>
      Specialized atrium muscle cells of the SA node spontaneously generate action potentials which are then propagated through the rest of the heart to cause cardiac contraction.
      <br/>
      This SA node region normally acts as the intrinsic cardiac pacemaker.
      <br/>
      The action potential generated by the SA node spreads through the atrial wall, causing the atrial chambers to contract and the P-wave of an electrocardiogram signal.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      The AV node consists of small, specialized cells located in the lower portion of the atrial chamber.
      <br/>
      The AV node acts like a bridge for the action potential to cross over into the ventricular chamber of the heart.
      <br/>
      Once the action potential has crossed over to the ventricular chambers, the bundle of His carries the action potential to specialized cardiac fibers called Purkinje fibers.
      <br/>
      The Purkinje fibers then distribute the action potential throughout the ventricular chamber of the heart.
      <br/>
      This results in rapid, very nearly simultaneous excitation of all ventricular muscle cells.
      <br/>
      The conduction of the action potential through the AV node and into the ventricular chambers creates the QRS-complex of an electrogram signal.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      During the cardiac cycle, the action potential moves in an antegrade direction, first causing the atrial chambers to contract and then causing the ventricle chambers to contract.
      <br/>
      When the action potential causes a single atrial contraction followed by a single ventricular contraction the heart is displaying a one-to-one atrial to ventricular response.
      <br/>
      In other words, for a given atrial contraction, the cardiac signal causing the atrial contraction subsequently causes a ventricle contraction.
      <br/>
      In this manner, there is a one-to-one atrial to ventricular response.
      <br/>
      Cardiac conditions also exist where the action potential moves in a retrograde direction, where the cardiac signal moves from the ventricular chamber up into the atrial chamber.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      When a patient's heart rate increases to above 100 beats per minute, the patient is said to be experiencing a tachyarrhythmia.
      <br/>
      Many different types of tachyarrhythmias can exist.
      <br/>
      For example, a heart in a sinus tachycardia (heart rates between 100-180 beats per minute) exhibits a normal cardiac cycle, where action potential moves in the antegrade direction from the atrial chambers to the ventricular chambers to cause the contraction of the heart.
      <br/>
      The increased heart rate during the sinus tachycardia is a response to a stimulus, and not to a cause within the heart.
      <br/>
      For example, sinus tachycardia stimulus can include physiologic responses to maintain adequate cardiac output and tissue oxygenation during exercise.
      <br/>
      Unlike sinus tachycardia, a ventricular tachycardia (heart rates between 120-250) is caused by electrical disturbances within the heart, and not due to the physiological demands of the body.
      <br/>
      Ventricular tachycardias must be treated quickly in order to prevent the tachycardia from degrading into a life threatening ventricular fibrillation.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      Distinguishing a ventricular tachycardia from a sinus tachycardia is important for diagnosing and properly treating the patient's cardiac condition.
      <br/>
      Misdiagnosis of a sinus tachycardia as a ventricular tachycardia can lead to inappropriate treatment.
      <br/>
      Difficulty in distinguishing among tachyarrhythmias increases when the heart is displaying a one-to-one atrial to ventricular rhythm.
      <br/>
      One reason for this difficulty is that the action potentials generated during the tachyarrhythmia can travel either in the antegrade direction, from the atria to the ventricles, or in a retrograde direction, from the ventricles into the atria.
      <br/>
      Tachyarrhythmias having action potentials conducted in an antegrade direction include sinus tachycardia and atrial tachycardia.
      <br/>
      Tachyarrhythmias having action potentials conducted in a retrograde direction include ventricular tachycardia with 1-to-1 retrograde conduction.
      <br/>
      Distinguishing the direction of the action potential (antegrade or retrograde) during a tachyarrhythmia is important in diagnosing and delivering the appropriate type of treatment to the patient.
    </p>
    <p num="9">For the reasons stated above, and for other reasons stated below which will become apparent to those skilled in the art upon reading and understanding the present specification, there is a need in the art for a reliable and convenient approach which can distinguish antegrade and retrograde action potentials during a tachyarrhythmia.</p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="10">
      The present subject matter provides a system and a method for distinguishing antegrade from retrograde action potentials during a tachyarrhythmia episode.
      <br/>
      The classified action potentials are then used to classify the tachyarrhythmia episode as occurring in either a retrograde direction or an antegrade direction.

    <p num="11">
      In one embodiment, both atrial and ventricular contractions are detected in sensed cardiac signals.
      <br/>
      The detected atrial and ventricular contractions are then used to determine atrial and ventricular cycle lengths.
      <br/>
      In one embodiment, an atrial cycle length is the time between successively sensed atrial contractions, and a ventricular cycle length is the time between successively sensed ventricular contractions.
      <br/>
      The ventricular contractions are further analyzed to determine the occurrence of a tachycardia episode.
    </p>
    <p num="12">
      When a tachycardia episode is detected, the sensed atrial and ventricular contractions are analyzed to determine if the contractions have a one-to-one association of atrial contractions to ventricular contractions.
      <br/>
      During a tachycardia episode having a one-to-one association of atrial contractions to ventricular contractions, the atrial cycle lengths are paired with the ventricular cycle lengths.
      <br/>
      In one embodiment, the atrial cycle lengths are paired with the ventricular cycle lengths in the antegrade direction.
      <br/>
      In pairing the cycle lengths in the antegrade direction, an atrial cycle length is paired with a ventricular cycle length that starts just after the start of the atrial cycle length.
      <br/>
      In pairing the cycle lengths in the retrograde direction, the atrial cycle length is paired with the ventricular cycle length that starts just before the start of the atrial cycle length.
    </p>
    <p num="13">
      In one embodiment, as the atrial and ventricular cycle lengths are paired in the antegrade and the retrograde directions the difference of the paired cycle lengths is calculated.
      <br/>
      The differences of the paired cycle lengths are then used to calculate correlation coefficients for both the cycle lengths paired in the antegrade direction and the retrograde direction.
      <br/>
      Based on the value of the correlation coefficients, the tachycardiac episode is then classified based on the values of the antegrade correlation coefficient and the retrograde correlation coefficient.
    </p>
    <p num="14">
      In one embodiment, the tachycardia episode is classified as occurring in a retrograde direction when the retrograde correlation coefficient is greater then the antegrade correlation coefficient.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, the tachycardia episode is classified as occurring in an antegrade direction when the antegrade correlation coefficient is greater then the retrograde correlation coefficient.
    </p>
    <p num="15">
      In addition to pairing atrial and ventricular cycle lengths in the antegrade and retrograde directions, the atrial and ventricular cycle lengths can also be paired in a super-antegrade and a super-retrograde direction.
      <br/>
      In one embodiment, atrial and ventricular cycle lengths are paired in the super-antegrade direction when an atrial cycle length is paired with a first ventricular cycle length started from an action potential causing the second atrial contraction of the atrial cycle length.
      <br/>
      The atrial and ventricular cycle lengths are paired in the super-retrograde direction when an atrial cycle length is paired with a second ventricular cycle length, the second ventricular cycle length having ended before the first atrial contraction of the atrial cycle length.

      As the atrial and ventricular cycle lengths are paired in the super-antegrade and the super-retrograde directions the difference of the paired cycle lengths is calculated.

    <p num="19">
      In the following detailed description, reference is made to the accompanying drawings which form a part hereof and in which is shown by way of illustration specific embodiments in which the invention can be practiced.

      The following detailed description is, therefore, not to be taken in a limiting sense and the scope of the present invention is defined by the appended claims and their equivalents.
    </p>
    <p num="20">
      The embodiments illustrated herein are demonstrated in an implantable cardiac defibrillator (ICD), which may include numerous defibrillation, pacing, and pulse generating modes known in the art.
      <br/>
      However, these embodiments are illustrative of some of the applications of the present system, and are not intended in an exhaustive or exclusive sense.
      <br/>
      The concepts described herein can be used in a variety of applications which will be readily appreciated by those skilled in the art upon reading and understanding this description.
      <br/>
      For example, the present system is suitable for implementation in a variety of implantable and external medical devices.

    <p num="21">
      As discussed above, discriminating one-to-one rhythms conducted in an antegrade direction (e.g., sinus tachycardia, atrial tachycardia) from one-to-one rhythms conducted in a retrograde direction (e.g., VT with one-to-one retrograde conduction) is important aspect of properly diagnosing a tachyarrhythmia episode.
      <br/>
      The present subject matter utilizes sensed cardiac complexes in determining, or distinguishing, the conduction direction of the cardiac signal.
      <br/>
      Cardiac complexes include the electrical excitatory impulses, or action potentials, that are sensed from the heart is it goes through the cardiac cycle.
    </p>
    <p num="22">
      The present subject matter uses the sensed cardiac complexes in a process called Cross Chamber Interval Correlation (CCIC).
      <br/>
      CCIC discriminates and classifies tachyarrhythmias displaying a one-to-one atrial to ventricular rhythm as either being conducted in an antegrade direction or in a retrograde direction.
      <br/>
      In one embodiment, atrial cycle lengths and ventricular cycle lengths are used in determining whether the tachyarrhythmia is being conducted in the antegrade or retrograde direction.
      <br/>
      An atrial cycle length is the time between successively sensed atrial contractions.
      <br/>
      In one embodiment, the sensed atrial contractions are the P-waves of a sensed electrocardiogram signal.
      <br/>
      A ventricular cycle length is the time between successively sensed ventricular contractions.
      <br/>
      In one embodiment, the sensed ventricular contractions are the R-waves of a sensed electrocardiogram signal.
    </p>
    <p num="23">
      FIG. 1 shows a drawing of a human heart 100.
      <br/>
      The heart 100 is divided into atrial chambers 110 and ventricular chambers 120.
      <br/>
      When the heart 100 is in normal sinus rhythm or in sinus tachycardia the contractile wave (action potential) for the heart beat originates in the SA node 130, which is located in the atrial region of the heart 100.
      <br/>
      In this situation the atrial chambers 110 can be though of as originating the signals to start the contraction of the heart 100.
      <br/>
      The contractile wave moves from the SA node 130 across the atria and then to the AV node 140.
      <br/>
      Lines 150 show the direction of the contractile wave as it would move across the atrial chambers 110.
      <br/>
      The AV node consists of small specialized cells located on the right side of the atrial septum just under the endocardium.
      <br/>
      The lower portion of the AV node consists of parallel fibers that form the only "bridge" of contiguous cardiac cells crossing the cartilaginous structure that provides support for the cardiac valves and electrically separates atria from ventricles.
      <br/>
      Propagation of the impulse through this AV nodal region is typically very slow (approximately 0.05 m/s) and therefore a delay is imposed between excitation of the atria and the ventricles.
      <br/>
      The term AV delay is given to denote this delay.
      <br/>
      The action potential causing the contractile wave then moves through the AV node and down into the ventricle chambers 120.
      <br/>
      The contractile wave is distributed quickly and essentially evenly through out the ventricle chambers 120 which allows for near simultaneous contraction of ventricles of the heart 100.
    </p>
    <p num="24">
      When the contractile wave originates in the SA node and moves through the AV node into the ventricles, the contractile wave is said to be moving in an antegrade direction.
      <br/>
      Examples of when the contractile wave is moving in the antegrade direction include when the heart is in normal sinus rhythm or when the heart is in sinus tachycardia.
      <br/>
      There are also cardiac conditions in which the contractile wave, or action potential, can move in a retrograde direction.
      <br/>
      In this situation the cardiac signal moves from the ventricular chamber up into the atrial chamber.
      <br/>
      An example of a cardiac condition displaying a retrograde direction is ventricular tachycardia with 1-to-1 retrograde conduction.
    </p>
    <p num="25">
      When a tachyarrhythmia displaying a one-to-one atrial to ventricular cycle length is detected, sensed atrial cycle lengths are paired with and compared with sensed ventricular cycle lengths.
      <br/>
      One way of comparing paired atrial cycle lengths and ventricular cycle lengths is in an antegrade direction.
      <br/>
      Another way of comparing paired atrial cycle lengths and ventricular cycle lengths in is a retrograde direction.
    </p>
    <p num="26">
      In one embodiment, antegrade pairing and comparing is accomplished by pairing an atrial cycle length with at least one ventricular cycle length started after the start of the atrial cycle length being paired.

      FIG. 2 shows one embodiment of an antegrade pairing of atrial and ventricular cycle lengths.
      <br/>
      At 200 there is shown atrial cycle lengths, where 204 indicates the occurrence of atrial contraction.

      In one embodiment, the atrial contractions are indicated by the sensing of an electrocardiogram P-wave.
      <br/>
      An atrial cycle length (or P--P-wave interval) constitutes the time between successive atrial contractions as indicated by 208.
      <br/>
      At 212 there is shown ventricular cycle lengths, where 216 indicates the occurrence of ventricular contraction.
      <br/>
      In one embodiment, the ventricular contractions are indicated by the sensing of an electrocardiogram R-wave.
      <br/>
      An ventricular cycle length (or R--R wave interval) constitutes the time between successive ventricular contractions as indicated by 220.

    <p num="27">
      When a tachyarrhythmia having a one-to-one atrial to ventricular cycle length is detected, atrial cycle lengths 208 are paired with and compared to ventricular cycle lengths 220 in the antegrade direction 226.
      <br/>
      When atrial cycle lengths 208 and ventricular cycle lengths 220 are paired in the antegrade direction, the atrial cycle length 208 is paired with a ventricular cycle length 220 started after the start of the atrial cycle length being paired.
      <br/>
      An example of a pairing is shown by the enclosed area 230.
    </p>
    <p num="28">
      In addition to pairing and comparing in the antegrade direction, the same atrial cycle lengths and ventricular cycle lengths can be paired and compared in a retrograde direction.
      <br/>
      For the retrograde direction, atrial cycle lengths are paired with ventricular cycle lengths started before each atrial cycle length being paired.
      <br/>
      FIG. 3 shows one embodiment of an retrograde pairing of atrial and ventricular cycle lengths.
      <br/>
      At 300 there is shown atrial cycle lengths, where 304 indicates the occurrence of atrial contraction.
      <br/>
      The atrial cycle length is indicated by 308.
      <br/>
      At 312 there are shown ventricular cycle lengths, where 316 indicates the occurrence of ventricular contraction.

      The ventricular cycle length is indicated by 320.
      <br/>
      During the tachyarrhythmia displaying a one-to-one atrial to ventricular cycle length, atrial cycle lengths 308 are paired with and compared to ventricular cycle lengths 320 in the retrograde direction 326.
      <br/>
      When atrial cycle lengths 308 and ventricular cycle lengths 320 are paired in the retrograde direction, the atrial cycle length 308 is paired with a ventricular cycle length 320 started before the start of the atrial cycle length being paired.
      <br/>
      An example of a pairing is shown by the enclosed area 330.
    </p>
    <p num="29">
      Correlation coefficients are then determined for the paired atrial cycle lengths and ventricular cycle lengths.
      <br/>
      A correlation coefficient describes the strength of an association between two variables.
      <br/>
      A high correlation coefficient implies a strong association so that the value of one variable can be used to predict, to some extent, the value of the other variable.
      <br/>
      In this invention the sequence of atrial cycle is one variable and the sequence of ventricular cycle lengths is the other variable.
      <br/>
      The correlation coefficient is computed using these sequences using both the antegrade pairing (as in FIG. 2) and the retrograde pairing (as in FIG. 3).
      <br/>
      Depending on the true direction of conduction, either the antegrade or retrograde pairing will have a higher correlation coefficient.
    </p>
    <p num="30">
      For example, a set of variable pairs, the correlation coefficient gives the strength of the association.
      <br/>
      For example, when the action potential is traveling in an antegrade direction during a one-to-one tachyarrhythmia, the atrial cycle lengths will more closely match the ventricular cycle lengths following the atrial cycle lengths, as the action potential initially causing atrial contraction is the action potential that subsequently causes the ventricular contraction.
      <br/>
      In this situation, the antegrade correlation coefficient will be larger than the retrograde correlation coefficient.
      <br/>
      On the other hand, when the action potential is traveling in the retrograde direction during a one-to-one tachyarrhythmia, the ventricular cycle lengths will more closely match the atrial cycle lengths following the ventricular cycle lengths, as the action potential initially causing the ventricular contraction is the action potential that subsequently causes the atrial contraction.
      <br/>
      In this situation, the retrograde correlation coefficient will be larger than the antegrade correlation coefficient.
    </p>
    <p num="31">Using the antegrade correlation coefficient and the retrograde correlation coefficient, the origin and conduction direction of a tachyarrhythmia can determined This information can then be used in making therapy determinations for the patient.</p>

      In one embodiment, cardiac complexes are sensed and analyzed using an ICD system.
      <br/>
      In one embodiment, the ICD system uses a dual chamber transvenous lead system to allow sensing of the cardiac action potentials in both the atrial chamber and the ventricular chamber.
      <br/>
      The transvenous lead system can include a ventricular lead and an atrial lead.
      <br/>
      In one embodiment, the ventricular lead has a rate-sensing (or near-field) electrode positioned at a distal end of the ventricular lead and at least one defibrillation electrode positioned along the surface of the lead.
      <br/>
      The atrial lead has a rate-sensing electrode positioned at a distal end of the atrial lead.
      <br/>
      In an additional embodiment, the atrial lead has at least two rate-sensing electrodes positioned along the peripheral surface of the atrial lead for rate-sensing.
      <br/>
      Other types of rate sensing electrodes are also considered appropriate to use with the present subject matter.
      <br/>
      Examples of other types of rate sensing electrodes include ring electrodes, both annular and semi-annular, as are known in the art.

      Referring now to FIG. 5, there is shown one embodiment for discriminating physiologic 1:1 antegrade rhythms such as sinus tachycardia (ST) from pathologic 1:1 retrograde rhythms such as ventricular tachycardia (VT).
      <br/>
      One of the underlying concepts of the present subject matter is based on the observation that during cardiac rhythms characterized by 1:1 atrial-to-ventricular or ventricular-to-atrial association, the cycle length variations in the originating chamber are correlated to the cycle length variations in the responding chamber except for any accompanying delay in the conduction path.
      <br/>
      For example, delay in the conduction path may be due to the actions of the AV-node or other structures of the conduction path.

      The resulting observation is that the cycle length variations (R--R or A--A intervals) in the origination chamber are statistically correlated with the cycle length variations in the responding chamber.

      The correlation between atrial and ventricular cycle lengths using antegrade and retrograde pairings is relatively easy to see when the delay across the AV node is constant or nearly constant.
      <br/>
      However, FIG. 7 shows a typical property of a human AV node.
      <br/>
      It plots the AV conduction time versus the R--R interval.
      <br/>
      When the R--R intervals are large (i.e., lower heart rates, approximately 60 to 100 beats/minute) the AV conduction curve has a slope that approaches zero.
      <br/>
      In FIG. 7, this area is shown at 700.
      <br/>
      On the other hand, when the R--R interval is decreased (i.e., at faster heart rates), the slope of the AV conduction curve becomes more negative.
      <br/>
      The section of the AV curves where the slope is approximately -1 is shown as area 710 in FIG. 7.
    </p>
    <p num="54">
      As the slope of the AV delay versus rate curve becomes negative, the delay required for an impulse to travel across the AV node gets longer and is more sensitive to the prematurity of the impulse.
      <br/>
      For example, at a R--R rate where the slope is -1, a contraction that occurs 10 msec prematurely (i.e., the R--R interval since the last contraction is 10 msec shorter than the average) will require an additional 10 msec to cross the AV node thus reaching the responding chamber at the same time it would have had the contraction occurred without prematurity.
    </p>
    <p num="55">
      Even if the conduction was truly in the antegrade direction, this slope in the AV conduction curve would reduce the antegrade correlation coefficient so that both the antegrade and retrograde correlation coefficients would be small.
      <br/>
      The present invention deals with this problem by using a super-antegrade and super-retrograde pairing for the computations as described below.
    </p>
    <p num="56">
      When the conduction through the AV node is constant (0 slope of AV conduction curve), any variation of cycle lengths in the atria are directly reflected by a similar (and correlated) cycle length variation in those same beats in the ventricles.
      <br/>
      However, when the AV conduction delay is inversely correlated cycle length (as when the AV conduction curve has a -1 slope), then the variations in the atria are no longer correlated with the variation of those same beats in the ventricles.
      <br/>
      That is why the correlation coefficient using the antegrade pairing is reduced.
    </p>
    <p num="57">
      However, while it is not obvious, under the conditions of a -1 slope in the AV curve, variations in the atria cycle length are correlated with the ventricular cycle length variation of the NEXT beat rather than the same beat.
      <br/>
      Thus, in addition to the antegrade and retrograde pairing of atrial and ventricular cycle lengths, the invention also uses super-antegrade and super-retrograde pairings as described below.
      <br/>
      If the conduction is truly antegrade and the slope of the AV curve is -1, then the correlation coefficient using the super-antegrade pairing is expected to be approximately 1 while the correlation coefficients using the super-retrograde, antegrade, and retrograde pairing are all expected to be close to zero.

    </p>
    <p num="63">
      AV delay intervals are also shown in FIG. 10 at 1024.
      <br/>
      As previously discussed the AV delay interval is the time the contractile wave takes to move through the AV node after being received from the originating chamber.
      <br/>
      By way of example only, and not in any limiting way, in FIG. 10 it is assumed that the heart is initially in a steady state with an atrial and ventricular rate of approximately 300 milliseconds. 1030 shows an atrial cycle length 1008 and a ventricular cycle length 1020 where the atrial cycle length and the responding ventricular cycle length is approximately 300 milliseconds.
      <br/>
      Also by way of example only, and not in any limiting way, during the steady state condition, the AV delay interval is also at a steady state condition.
      <br/>
      In the present embodiment, the AV delay interval is 50 milliseconds for atrial cycle lengths of approximately 300 milliseconds. 1034 show an AV delay interval of 50 milliseconds for atrial cycle lengths of approximately 300 milliseconds.
    </p>
    <p num="64">
      As previously discussed, when the R--R-wave interval decreases (the heart rate increasing) the slope of the AV conduction curve may become more negative.
      <br/>
      As the slope becomes negative, the delay required for an impulse to travel across the AV node depends on the rate at which the node is being activated.
      <br/>
      When there is a premature contraction from the originating chamber, the resulting AV delay value is increased by a value that corresponds to the prematurity of the originating chamber.
      <br/>
      Likewise, when the contraction in the originating chamber causes the contraction cycle length to be longer than previously experienced, the AV delay value is decreased by approximately the same amount of time that the signal was early.
      <br/>
      As the slope of the AV conduction curve changes the values of the antegrade and retrograde correlation coefficients become less distinctive.
      <br/>
      The correlation coefficients from the super-antegrade and super-retrograde comparisons can then aid in making the determination between antegrade conduction and retrograde conduction.
    </p>
    <p num="65">
      By way of example only and not by way of limitation, in FIG. 10 it is assumed that the slope of the AV conduction curve is approximately -1.
      <br/>
      Therefore, changes in the originating chamber will be reflected inversely in the AV node delay.
      <br/>
      At 1038, there is a change in the atrial cycle length time from 300 milliseconds to 295 milliseconds.
      <br/>
      As this is a decrease in the atrial cycle length time, the contractile wave (or action potential) from the atrial chamber arrives at the AV node 5 milliseconds earlier than the steady state time.
      <br/>
      As the signal has arrived 5 milliseconds too early, there is a delay in the AV node of 5 milliseconds.
      <br/>
      So the total time for the contractile wave to move through the AV node is now 55 milliseconds as shown at 1044.
      <br/>
