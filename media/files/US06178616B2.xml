      A circulating type milling apparatus for milling a lock core keyway includes a frame with a rotating disc that is intermittently rotated through a pre-determined angle.
      <br/>
      Lock core seats are equidistantly provided on the rotating disc.
      <br/>
      A milling disc is mounted to a top plate of the frame and includes cutters, ejecting plate, and detectors mounted thereon.
      <br/>
      The cutters are lowered to mill a keyway in each lock core.
      <br/>
      When the cutters are further moved downward and thus disengaged from the lock cores, the rotating disc is rotated by a distance that is equal to a half distance between two adjacent lock core seats such that each lock core seat is in a positioning in alignment with an associated detector yet not in alignment with an associated cutter.
      <br/>
      When the milling disc is moved upward, the detector checks whether the milled keyway of the lock core meets the required standard.
      <br/>
      The ejecting plate ejects the finished milled lock core, and a new lock core is fed by a lock core supplying device.

      Field of the Invention
    </p>
    <p num="2">The present invention relates to a circulating type milling apparatus for milling the keyway of a lock core at high speed.</p>
    <p num="3">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
    <p num="4">Taiwan Utility Model Publication No. 37696, entitled "AUTOMATIC MILLING DEVICE FOR LOCK CORES" and issued on Jun. 1, 1981, discloses a reciprocating cutter mounted on a movable base, a key being provided on the base for activating a control rod and a control arm for automatically urging a lock core to fall into a milling seat and thus be milled to form a keyway.</p>
    <p num="5">
      Taiwan Utility Model Publication No. 44973, entitled "MILLING DEVICE FOR LOCK CORES" and issued on Jul. 1, 1982, discloses a base with a cutter seat to which a cutter is mounted, and a motor is provided for driving a chain wheel.
      <br/>
      A milling seat frame and a milling seat are carried by a chain and thus conveyed along the conveying direction such that a lock core in the milling seat is milled by the cutter on the base to form a keyway.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      It is, however, found that the milling speeds of the milling devices discloses in the above two disclosures are relatively low, only 3-4 lock cores are milled per minute.
      <br/>
      In addition, the whole cutter must be replaced if a small portion of the cutter is damaged, which is not economical.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      Taiwan Utility Model Publication No. 300181, entitled "REVOLVER TYPE MILLING DEVICE FOR LOCK CORES" and issued on Mar. 11, 1997, discloses a frame with a revolver disc rotatably supported by a bearing and having posts for a working table that is moved vertically by a cylinder means.
      <br/>
      The revolver disc is attached to a shaft that is rotatably held by the bearing.
      <br/>
      A bevel gear is intermittently driven to cause the revolver disc to travel through a certain angle at regular time.
      <br/>
      A number of seats are mounted on the revolver disc for holding lock cores.
      <br/>
      When the working table is moved by the cylinder means, cutters on the working table mill the lock cores on the revolver disc in response to reciprocating movements of the posts of the frame, and the milling procedure on each lock core is continued when the revolver disc is rotated to next angular position to finally form a keyway on each lock core.
      <br/>
      It is, however, found that a tooth space difference exists when the lock core is turned, as the bevel gear is intermittently driven.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, the keyway formed by milling has a larger tolerance, resulting in lock cores with unreliable quality.
    </p>
    <p num="8">The present invention is intended to provide a circulating type milling apparatus for milling a lock core keyway that mitigates and/or obviates the above problems.</p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="9">It is a primary object of the present invention to provide a circulating type milling apparatus for precisely and rapidly milling a lock core keyway for each lock core.</p>
    <p num="10">
      A circulating type milling apparatus for milling a lock core keyway in accordance with the present invention comprises a frame with a rotating disc that is rotated through a predetermined angle.
      <br/>
      Lock core seats are provided on the rotating disc.
      <br/>
      Lock cores are filled into the lock core seats one by one and then milled by cutters that are mounted to a vertically movable milling disc, which, in turn, is actuated by, e.g., a hydraulic cylinder.
      <br/>
      The cutters are guided downward by tracks arranged on an annular fixed wall for simultaneously milling the lock cores.
      <br/>
      When a lower sensor detects that the cutters are moved downward and thus disengaged from the lock cores, the rotating disc is rotated by a distance that is equal to a half distance between two adjacent lock core seats such that each lock core seat is in a positioning in alignment with a detector.
      <br/>
      When the milling disc is moved upward, the detector checks whether the milled keyway of the lock core meets the required standard.
      <br/>
      If a cutter fails to mill the keyway to the required standard as a result of wear, the detector sends a signal to stop the whole milling apparatus for replacing the cutter.
      <br/>
      When an upper sensor detects that the milling disc is moved upward to a preset position, the detector disengages from the lock core seat, and the rotating disc is rotated again by a distance that is equal to a half distance between two adjacent lock core seats for next milling.

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading>
    <p num="13">
      Referring to FIGS. 1 and 2, a circulating type milling apparatus in accordance with the present invention generally includes a frame 10, a rotating disc 20, a milling disc 30, and an annular fixed wall 40.
      <br/>
      The frame 10 includes a plurality of posts 11 for supporting a top plate 12.
      <br/>
      At least one cylinder (two hydraulic cylinders 13 in this embodiment) is provided to cause the rotating disc 20 to rotate.
      <br/>
      Each cylinder 13 includes an actuating rod 131 with a ratchet tooth member 132 pivotally connected to a distal end thereof.
      <br/>
      The rotating disc 20 includes a plurality of teeth 21 formed on an outer periphery thereof for releasably meshing with the ratchet tooth member 132.
      <br/>
      When the actuating rod 131 of the cylinder 13 retracts from an extended position shown in FIG. 2 to a retracted position shown in FIG. 3, the rotating disc 20 is rotated, e.g., clockwise through a tooth pitch by the ratchet tooth member 132.
      <br/>
      When the actuating rod 131 of the cylinder 13 extends from the retracted position in FIG. 3, the ratchet tooth member 132 slides over the tip of an associated tooth 21 (see FIG. 4) and then engages with next two adjacent teeth 21 of the rotating disc 20.
      <br/>
      As illustrated in FIG. 4, during sliding movement, the ratchet tooth member 132 is pivoted by the associated tooth 21 and bears against a resilient plate 132 that biases the ratchet tooth member 132 to engage with the teeth 21 of the rotating disc 20.
    </p>
    <p num="14">
      Referring to FIGS. 5 and 6, the frame 10 includes a lock core supplying means 14 that utilizes a guide tube 141 for allowing lock cores 100 to fall onto a support plate 15 one by one.
      <br/>
      A stop plate 142 is provided under the guide tube 141 and actuated by a cylinder 143.
      <br/>
      When the stop plate 142 is below the guide tube 141, falling (i.e., feeding) of the lock cores 100 is stopped, as shown in FIG. 6.
      <br/>
      When the stop plate 142 is moved away from the guide tube 141, a lock core 100 falls onto the support plate 15, best shown in FIG. 7.
      <br/>
      Next, the stop plate 142 is actuated again by the cylinder 143 to a place below the guide tube 142, thereby stopping falling of next lock core 100 and pushing the lock core 100 to a hole 151 in the support plate 15.
      <br/>
      As a result, the lock core 100 falls into an associated lock core seat 20 via the hole 151 under actuation of a cylinder 16 above the hole 151.
      <br/>
      Next retracting stroke of the cylinder 143 causes the next lock core 100 to fall onto the support plate 15.
    </p>
    <p num="15">Referring to FIGS. 1 and 2 again, the frame 10 further includes a guide plate 171 for guiding a milled lock core into a collecting box 17.</p>
    <p num="16">
      The teeth 21 on the rotating disc 20 are equidistantly arranged.
      <br/>
      When a respective tooth 21 is pushed by the ratchet tooth member 132, the rotating disc 20 is rotated through a distance equal to a half distance between two adjacent lock core seats 22.
      <br/>
      In order to provide a better positioning effect after rotation of the rotating disc 20, a plurality of positioning members 23 are provided to the periphery of the rotating disc 20.
      <br/>
      As illustrated in FIG. 10, each positioning member 23 includes a steel ball 231 and an elastic element 232.
      <br/>
      In addition, the frame 10 includes a plurality of annularly, equidistantly arranged arcuate depressions 18.
      <br/>
      Each steel ball 231 is biased by the associated elastic element 232 to be releasably retained in an associated depression 18.
      <br/>
      Thus, the rotating disc 20 may be precisely positioned after every rotation.
    </p>
    <p num="17">
      Referring to FIGS. 2, 9, and 10, a plurality of lock core seats 20 are equidistantly, annularly provided to an inner periphery of the rotating disc 20.
      <br/>
      Each lock core seat 20 includes a slotted hole 221 (namely, a longitudinal slot is defined in a wall defining the hole 221) for receiving a lock core 100.
      <br/>
      The hole 221 has a diameter slightly greater than a relatively smaller diameter of the lock core 100 yet smaller than a relatively larger diameter of the lock core 100.
      <br/>
      Thus, the lock core 100 can be held in the lock core seat 22.
      <br/>
      In order to prevent rotation of the lock core 100 in the lock core seat 22, a transverse hole 222 (preferably threaded) is defined in the lock core seat 22 for receiving a retainer 223, an elastic element 224, and a fixing member 225 with an outer threading for threadedly engaged with the transverse screw hole 222.
      <br/>
      The retainer 223 is made of soft material and biased outward by the elastic element 224 to bear against the lock core 100 and thus retain the lock core 100 in place, thereby preventing rotation of the lock core 100 in the lock core seat 22.
      <br/>
      It is appreciated that the retainer 223 is partially received in the transverse hole 222 when the former is biased outward.
      <br/>
      In addition, the lock core seat 22 may include an inner seat 26 secured in place by the fixing member 225.
      <br/>
      The inner seat 26 may be easily and quickly replaced by a new one if a change in the diameter of the slotted hole is required.
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      Referring to FIGS. 1 and 10, the milling disc 30 is connected to and thus actuated by a cylinder 31 so as to move vertically upon actuation of the cylinder 31 that is secured to the top plate 12 of the frame 10.
      <br/>
      The milling disc 30 includes a plurality of downwardly extending rods 32 each having a cutter 33 attached to a distal end thereof (FIG. 5).
      <br/>
      The cutters 33 are arranged equidistantly on the same circle to mill the lock core keyway gradually (step by step).
      <br/>
      Thus, upon intermittent rotation of the rotating disc 20, the lock core 100 is milled step by step by the cutters 33 one by one and finally forms its keyway.
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      Referring to FIGS. 2, 10, and 11, an upper sensor 36 and a lower sensor 37 are provided to the fixed wall 40.
      <br/>
      When the cutters 33 are disengaged from the lock core seats 22, the cutters 33 are moved to engage with the upper sensor 36 (if moved upward, FIG. 10) or the lower sensor 37 (if moved downward, FIG. 11).
      <br/>
      A signal is sent to cause rotation of the rotating disc 20.
      <br/>
      Namely, rotation of the rotating disc 20 cannot be undergone unless it is confirmed that the cutters 33 are disengaged from the lock core seats 22 by detecting contact between the cutters 33 and either sensor 36, 37.
    </p>
    <p num="20">
      Referring to FIGS. 1, 2, and 12, one of the rods 32 has an ejecting plate 34 for ejecting a milled lock core 100 from the lock core seat 22.
      <br/>
      The ejecting plate 34 is plate-like and is capable of ejecting the lock core 100 upward via the slotted hole 221 of the lock core seat 22 when the milling disc 30 is moved upward, thereby causing the lock core 100 to fall into the collecting box 17 via a guide plate 171.
    </p>
    <p num="21">
      Referring to FIGS. 2, 5, and 13, in order to check whether the milled keyway of every lock core meets the preset standard, a detector 35 is secured to each rod 32 and located behind the associated cutter 33 along the rotating direction.
      <br/>
      The detectors 35 and the cutters 33 are equidistantly arranged on the same circle.
      <br/>
      When the rotating disc 20 is rotated through a tooth pitch, the lock core 100 in the lock core seat 22 aligns with to an associated cutter and an associated detector 35.
      <br/>
      Thus, when the milling disc 30 is moved downward, the cutters 33 mill the lock core 100.
      <br/>
      When the milling disc 30 is moved upward, the detector 35 checks whether the keyway is milled to meet the required standard.
      <br/>
      The detector 35 has a plate with a width slightly smaller than the cutter 33.
      <br/>
      Thus, when the plate of the detector 35 is in contact with the lock core 100 (i.e., the milled keyway does not meet the required standard), a signal is sent by a sensor 38 to stop the whole milling apparatus for replacing the abnormal cutter 33.
    </p>
    <p num="22">
      Referring to FIGS. 2, 3, and 5, in order to provide stable vertical movements for the cutters 33, the ejecting plate 34, and the detectors 35, the annular fixed wall 40 on the frame 10 includes a plurality of tracks 41 for slidingly engaging with fixing seats 330, 340, and 350 respectively for the cutters 33, the ejecting plate 34, and the detectors 35.
      <br/>
      Thus, when the milling disc 30 moved vertically, the cutters 33, the ejecting plate 34, and the detectors 35 move rectilinearly along the vertical direction without any deviation.
    </p>
    <p num="23">
      Referring to FIGS. 2 and 10, the milling disc 30 is moved downward for milling the keyway when the lock core seat 22 is in a position aligned with an associated cutter 33 (FIG. 11).
      <br/>
      After the milling disc 30 is moved downward to a preset position, the lower sensor 37 sends a signal (the cutter 33 disengages from the lock core 100 and the lock core seat 22) to actuate the cylinder 13 for rotating the disc 20 clockwise through a tooth pitch (FIG. 3).
      <br/>
      The lock core 100 is in a position aligned with a detector 35.
      <br/>
      Thus, when the milling disc 30 is moved upward, the keyway just milled is allowed to pass through the detector 35 if the keyway meets the required standard.
      <br/>
      At this time, the cutter 33 does not contact with the lock core 100 during the upward movement of the milling disc 30.
      <br/>
      The lock core 100 is milled by all cutters 33 one by one when the rotating disc 20 is rotated through 360 (degree) . The finished lock core 100 is ejected upward by the ejecting plate 34 and thus falls into the collection box 17.
      <br/>
      New lock cores 100 are supplied via the lock core supplying means 14 for milling.
    </p>
    <p num="24">According to the above description, it is appreciated that the lock cores are milled quickly and precisely by the circulating type milling apparatus in accordance with the present invention.</p>
    <p num="25">Although the invention has been explained in relation to its preferred embodiment, it is to be understood that many other possible modifications and variations can be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as hereinafter claimed.</p>
