    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">The present invention relates to long blades for a high and low pressure sides-integrated steam turbine, using a noble heat resistant alloy, a high and low pressure integral steam turbine using the long blades, and a combined cycle power generation system.</p>
    <p num="3">
      At present, 12Cr--Mo--V--N steel is used for steam turbine blades.
      <br/>
      In recent years, it has been desired to raise the thermal efficiency of a fossil fuel power plant in view of energy-saving, and make apparatuses used therefore compact in view of space-saving.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      Elongation of the turbine blades is an effective means for improving the thermal efficiency and making the apparatuses compact.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the length of blades of the final stage tends to be increased year by year.
      <br/>
      Thereby, under conditions in which the steam turbine blades are used also become severe, a conventional 12Cr--Mo--V--N steel can not provide turbine blades having sufficient strength.
      <br/>
      Therefore, a stronger material is necessary.
      <br/>
      Accordingly the strength of material for long blades, tensile strength, which is a base of mechanical property, is required.
    </p>
    <p num="5">Further, toughness also is required to securing safety against rupture.</p>
    <p num="6">
      As a structural material having a higher tensile strength than the conventional 12Cr--Mo--V--N steel (martensite steel), a Ni-base alloy and Co-base alloy are well known.
      <br/>
      However, the are not sufficient in hot workability, machine-cutting property and vibration-attenuating properties, so that they are not desirable.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      Material for gas turbine discs is disclosed in JP A 63-171856.
      <br/>
      Such material however, does not have a high tensile strength.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      Further, an integral turbine, which has a high pressure side which and a low pressure side are integrated into one unit in view of space-saving in turbines of a small capacity less than 100,000 kW and a middle capacity of from 100,000 to 300,000 kW, has been put into practice.
      <br/>
      The length of final stage blades of this integral turbine is 33.5 inches at most because the strength of material for the rotor and blade is limited.
      <br/>
      The blade length, however, is desired to be further elongated in order to increase the turbine output.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      JP A 3-130502 discloses blades for high and low pressure sides-integrated steam turbines, using 12% Cr steels.
      <br/>
      However, the steel is too low in tensile strength to provide long blades for recent low pressure steam turbines.
    </p>

      The strength rapidly decreases when an amount of Ni becomes less by 0.6% or more than an amount of Mo, and the strength also rapidly decreases when the amount of Ni becomes more by 1.0% or more than an amount of Mo.

      In particular, materials having strength of about 15 kg/mm2 or more are better for the turbine rotors on which long blades of 33.5" are planted.

      Further, in order to examine characteristics of brittleness of sample Nos. 24 and No. 25 (each corresponding to currently used high pressure rotor material) and No. 26 (currently used low pressure rotor material), impact test were conducted of samples before and after treatment of 500 (degree)  C. for 3000 h for embrittling, and a 50% fracture appearance transition temperature (FATT) was examined.
      <br/>
      FATT is increased (which means to be made brittle) from 119 (degree)  C. to 135 (degree)  C. ( DELTA FATT=16 (degree)  C.) in No. 25, from -20 (degree)  C. to 18 (degree)  C. ( DELTA FATT=38 (degree)  C.) in No. 26 by the embrittling treatment.
      <br/>
      On the contrary, it was confirmed that FATT of the sample No. 23 according to the present invention is 38 (degree)  C. before and after the brittleness making treatment, that is, not made brittle.

      Sample Nos. 28 to 31 have rare-earth elements of (La--Ce), Ca, Zr and Al, added thereto, respectively and toughness of each of the samples is increased by adding the element or elements.

      Particularly, an addition of rare-earth elements is effective for improving the toughness.
      <br/>
      A material having Y added thereto other than La--Ce also was examined, as a result, it was confirmed that the addition brought an effect of remarkably improving the toughness.

    <p num="138">Further, a high creep rupture strength of 12 kg/mm2 or more can be obtained by reducing O2 to an amount of 100 ppm or less, particularly, 15 kg/mm2 or more by reducing it 80 ppm or less and 18 kg/mm2 or more by reducing it 40 ppm or less.</p>
    <p num="139">A 538 (degree)  C. 105 h creep rupture strength has a tendency to decrease according to an increase in an amount of Ni, particularly, the strength becomes about 11 kg/mm2 or more when an amount of Ni is 2% or less, more particularly, 12 kg/mm2 or more is exhibited at an amount of Ni of 1.9% or less.</p>
    <p num="140">
      FIG. 10 is a graph showing a relation between impact values after heating for 3000 h and an amount of Ni.
      <br/>
      As shown in FIG. 10, the materials, of which a ratio of (Si+Mn)/Ni is 0.18 or less or a ratio of Mn/Ni is 0.12 or less, have a high impact value according to an increase in an amount of Ni, however, a material or materials of the comparison samples No. 12 to No. 14, of which a ratio of (Si+Mn)/Ni is more than 0.18 or a ratio of Mn/Ni is more than 0.12, has a low impact value of 2.4 kg-m or less, and even if an amount of Ni becomes high, it influences little on the impact value.
      <br/>
      It is apparent that an influence of Mn or (Si+Mn) on the impact value is very large at a specific amount of Ni.
      <br/>
      When an amount of Mn is 0.2% or less or an amount of (Si+Mn) is 0.25% or less, a very high impact value is presented.
      <br/>
      Therefore, when a ratio of (Si+Mn)/Ni is 0.18 or less or a ratio of Mn/Ni is 0.12 or less, a high impact value of 2.5 kg-m or more is presented.

    <p num="141">
      Until a composition ratio between (V+Mo)/(Ni+Cr) relating to creep rupture strength and impact absorption energy reaches about 0.7, wherein V and Mo are elements forming carbides and Ni and Cr are elements improving hardenability, the creep rupture strength and the impact absorption energy increase as the composition ratio (V+Mo)/(Ni+Cr) increases.
      <br/>
      The impact absorption energy becomes low as the above composition ratio becomes larger.
      <br/>
      Toughness and creep rupture strength, which are necessary for the high and low pressure sides-integrated mono-block turbine rotor can be made excellent in their property by making the composition ratio (V+Mo)/(Ni+Cr) into a range of 0.45-0.7.

      Relations between impact values after heating for making brittle and an amount of Mn or an amount of (Si+Mn) of material containing 1.6-1.9% Ni were examined.
      <br/>
      As a result, it was found that an influence of an amount of Mn or an amount of (Si+Mn) on impact value is very large at a specific amount of Ni, and a very large impact value is presented at 0.2% or less of Mn or at 0.07-0.25% of (Si+Mn).

    <p num="143">Relations between impact values and a ratio Mn/Ni or (Si+Mn)/Ni in material containing 1.52-2.0% Ni were examined, as a result, it was found that a high impact value of 2.5 kg-m or more was presented when the ratio of Mn/Ni is 0.12 or less, the ratio of (Si+Mn)/Ni is 0.04-0.18.</p>

    <p num="197">FIG. 18 is a schematic diagram of a multi axis type combined cycle power generation system employing both of 2 gas turbines and one high and low pressure integral steam turbine.</p>
    <p num="198">
      In a case where electric power is generated using a gas turbine, in recent years there has been a tendency to use a compound power generation system in which the gas turbine is driven with liquified natural gas (LNG) as fuel, a steam turbine is driven with steam obtained by recovering energy of waste or exhaust gas of the gas turbine, and a generator is driven by the gas turbine and the steam turbine.
      <br/>
      By using the compound power generation system, the thermal efficiency can be improved greatly to be about 44% as compared with a conventional single steam turbine power generation of which the thermal efficiency is 40%.
    </p>
    <p num="199">In such a compound power generation plant, recently, further, use of both of liquid natural gas (LNG) and liquid petroleum gas (LPG) is planned instead of use of only LNG, and a smooth operation of plant and improvement of economy are planned by combustion of both of LNG and LPG.</p>
    <p num="200">In the power generation system, first of all, air is transferred to an air compressor of the gas turbine through an inlet air filter and inlet air silencer, and the air compressor compresses the air and transfers the compressed air into low NO *  combustors.</p>
    <p num="201">In the combustors, fuel is injected into the compressed air and burned to generate high temperature gas of 1200 (degree)  C. or more and the gas works in the gas turbine to generates power.</p>
    <p num="202">
      Exhaust gas of 530 (degree)  C. or more from the gas turbine is transferred into an exhaust or waste gas recovery boiler through an exhaust gas silencer.
      <br/>
      The boiler recovers energy of the exhaust gas to generate high pressure steam of 530 (degree)  C. or more.
      <br/>
      The boiler is provided with a denitration apparatus using a dry type ammonia contact reducing system.
      <br/>
      The exhaust gas is exhausted from a several hundreds meters high stack with a tripod.
    </p>
    <p num="203">
      The generated high pressure steam and low pressure steam are transferred to the steam turbine having a high and low pressure integral rotor.
      <br/>
      The turbine is described later.
    </p>
    <p num="204">
      Further, the steam from the steam turbine flows into a condenser, in a which it is deaerated in vacuum to be condensate.
      <br/>
      The condensate is pressurized by a condensate pump, and sent to the boiler as a feed water.
      <br/>
      The gas turbine and the steam turbine drive the generator at both shaft ends of the generator to generate electric power.
      <br/>
      For cooling gas turbine blades used in such a compound power generation plant, in some cases, steam used in the steam turbine may be used as a cooling medium.
    </p>
    <p num="205">
      Generally, air is used as a coolant for blades.
      <br/>
      However, steam also is used as such a coolant.
      <br/>
      Steam has a large cooling effect because the steam has a drastically large specific heat as compared with air and has light weight.
      <br/>
      Since the steam has a large specific heat, the temperature of a main flow gas is reduced remarkably and the thermal efficiency of the whole plant is increased when the steam used as coolant is flowed into the main flow gas, so that steam of relatively low temperature, for example, about 300-400 (degree)  C., is supplied to turbine blades from coolant supply ports, cools blade bodies, the coolant the temperature of which is elevated to relatively high temperature through heat-exchange is recovered and then returned into the steam turbine.
      <br/>
      Thereby a decrease in the temperature (about 1300-1500 (degree)  C.) of the main flow gas is prevented and the efficiency of the steam turbine is raised, whereby the efficiency of the whole plant can be improved.
      <br/>
      By this multi-axis type combined power generation system, 100,000-500,000 kW in total can be generated, wherein the gas turbine can generate 50,000-300,000 kW and the steam turbine 50,000-200,000 kW.
      <br/>
      Thereby, the steam turbine in the embodiment is made compact and all the plant including a plurality of gas turbines and steam turbine can generate power of 700,000-1,000,000 kW.
      <br/>
      The plant having the same capacity as a large-sized steam turbine can be made at low cost, compared with the large sized steam turbine and has a large merit that the turbine can be effectively or economically operated responding to fluctuation in power generation amount.

    <p num="245">This embodiment has the following requirement in stead of the gas turbine of the embodiment 6.</p>
    <p num="246">
      In a gas turbine of this embodiment, first stage blades 33 each have substantially the same construction as in the embodiment 6, and are made of a unidirectional solidification casting of Ni-base super alloy comprising, by weight, 5-16% Cr, 0.3-2% Mo, 2-9% W, 2.5-6% Al, 0.5-5% Ti, 1-4% Ta, 8-10% Co, 0.05-0.15% C, 0.005-0.02% B, inevitable impurity and balance Ni.
      <br/>
      A total length of each first stage blade is about 220 mm.
      <br/>
      Since a service temperature of the unidirectional solidification casing is 890-900 (degree)  C. at 105 h 14 kgf/mm2, a heat shield coating layer is provided to lower the metal temperature of the material as in the embodiment 6.
      <br/>
      The unidirectional solidification is done gradually from the blade portion toward a dovetail portion to form columnar crystal of the diameter 2-10 mm.
      <br/>
      The crystal is small at the blade portion and becomes larger from a shank portion to the dovetail portion.
      <br/>
      The unidirectional solidification casting is subjected to solid solution treatment at 1200-1280 (degree)  C., and then two step aging treatment at 1000-1150 (degree)  C. and at 800-950 (degree)  C. is effected, whereby 50-70 volume % of  GAMMA ' phase of one side 2  MU m or less is precipitated.

      The heat shield layer is unnecessary to be provided, particularly, however, the second stage is provided with an alloy layer of an alloy comprising by weight 2-5% Al, 20-30% Cr, 0.1-1% Y and balance Ni or Ni+Co to improve corrosion resistance.
      <br/>
      Each nozzle has an inner cooling hole, and it is cooled by compressed air.
