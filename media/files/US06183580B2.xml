      <br/>
      A protective covering system for protecting the exterior of a vehicle including the paint surfaces and glass surface of the vehicle from damage from rocks, insects, road tar, and other debris while driving.
      <br/>
      The protective covering system includes a set of protective sheets with each protective sheet having front and back surfaces, and an outer perimeter.
      <br/>
      Each protective sheet is generally transparent to permit the passage of light therethrough between the front and back surfaces of the protective sheet.
      <br/>
      The back surface of each of the protective sheet is designed for attachment to an exterior surface of a vehicle.

      <br/>
      Ideally, the side hood protective sheets 31,32 are each quadrilateral in shape and have a pair of end edges and a pair of side edges with the side edges converging together towards one of the end edges of the respective side hood protective sheet 31,32.
    </p>
    <p num="32">
      The bumper protective sheets 33,34 are configured for attachment to the exterior of a bumper 5 of a vehicle 1.
      <br/>
      The bumper protective sheets 33,34 are each generally rectangular and has a length and a width.
      <br/>
      Ideally, the length of each of the bumper protective sheets 33,34 is at least three times greater than the width of the respective bumper protective sheet 33,34.
      <br/>
      The wheel well protective sheets 35 are configured for attachment to a portion of a wheel well of a vehicle 1 behind the associated wheel of the vehicle 1.
      <br/>
      Preferably, each wheel well protective sheet 35 is generally rectangular and has a length and a width.
      <br/>
      Ideally, the length of each wheel well protective sheet 35 is at least twice the width of the respective wheel well protective sheet 35.
    </p>
    <p num="33">
      In use, the back surface 22 of the front windshield protective sheet 26 is attached to the exterior of the front windshield 3 of a vehicle 1 to substantially cover the front windshield 3 of the vehicle 1 with the front windshield protective sheet 26.
      <br/>
      The back surface 22 of each of the side window protective sheets 28 is attached to the exterior of an associated side window of the vehicle such that one of the side window protective sheets 28 substantially covers the exterior of one side window 4 of the vehicle and another of the side window protective sheets substantially covers the exterior of another side window of the vehicle.
      <br/>
      The back surfaces of the hood protective sheets 30,31,32 are attached to the exterior of the hood 2 of the vehicle 1 to such that the center hood protective sheet 30 substantially covers a central region of the exterior of the hood of the vehicle 1 and the side hood protective sheets 31,32 cover exterior portions of the hood 2 of the vehicle 1 on either side of the center hood protective sheet 30.
      <br/>
      The back surfaces 22 of the bumper protective sheets 33,34 are attached to the exterior of the bumper 5 of the vehicle 1.
      <br/>
      Preferably, one of the bumper protective sheets is positioned towards one side of the vehicle and the other bumper protective sheet is positioned towards another side of the vehicle.
      <br/>
      In use, a wheel well protective sheet 35 is attached to each of the wheel wells 6 of the vehicle 1 such that each wheel well protective sheets 35 is positioned in the respective wheel well 6 of the vehicle 1 behind the associated wheel of the vehicle 1.
    </p>
    <p num="34">To remove any of the protective sheets from the exterior of the vehicle a user simply grasps peripheral region 14 of the protective sheet 12 with their fingers to peel the protective sheet 12 off of the exterior surface of the vehicle 1.</p>
    <p num="35">
      The protective sheets 12 can be disposed on a roll 16.
      <br/>
      Note FIG. 2.
      <br/>
      The protective sheets 12, in this form, includes a plurality of perforated lines 18 to facilitate separation of the protective sheets 12 into segments.
      <br/>
      The plurality of perforated lines 18 are spaced at varying lengths to generate segments of differing widths.
      <br/>
      Note FIGS. 4-7. In use, the present invention would be applied to the windshield, front end surfaces, and even certain areas of the lower body panels of a vehicle.
      <br/>
      The main purpose of this product is to protect the windshield and other key surfaces and keep them free of dead insects, road tar, bird droppings, and possibly even scratches or chips caused by small stones.
      <br/>
      The roll could be made in various lengths and in widths ranging from 6 to 36 inches.
      <br/>
      The present invention would be applied to the vehicle via the clear adhesive.
      <br/>
      The user would simply cut or tear the protective sheets 12 to fit the surfaces he wanted to protect.
      <br/>
      The protective sheets 12 would then act as a barrier between insects, tar, stones, and other things which could dirty or damage the actual surface of the vehicle.
      <br/>
      When the protective sheets 12 became worn or well covered with dead bugs, etc., the user could simply peel the protective sheets 12 off, dispose of it, and apply a new protective sheets 12.
