    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="1">
      1.
      <br/>
      Field of the Invention
    </p>
    <p num="2">
      The present invention relates to a multidirectional controller and a multidirectional controlling device using the multidirectional controller.
      <br/>
      Specifically, the present invention relates to a multidirectional controller which is manipulated in horizontal (circumferential) and vertical directions with respect to a surface of a main substrate of the controller.
      <br/>
      The multidirectional controlling device is used, for example, as a controlling device for a portable electronic apparatus, a pointing device for a personal computer or a remote controller for various electronic apparatuses.
    </p>
    <p num="3">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
    <p num="4">
      Conventionally, a controlling device for a portable electronic apparatus or the like includes a controller which is manipulated in a direction horizontal to a surface of a main substrate of the controller.
      <br/>
      Hereinafter, a conventional controller will be described.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      In a conventional controller, a rotational electronic part with a control knob is soldered to one end of a main substrate.
      <br/>
      Electric signals output from the rotational electronic part are led to a connecting terminal via a line pattern provided on the main substrate.
      <br/>
      The electric signals are then transmitted through a flexible substrate connected to the connecting terminal, and to a circuit of an apparatus including the controller.
    </p>
    <p num="6">However, such a conventional controller is controlled only in directions horizontal to the main substrate of the apparatus.</p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>

    <heading>DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
    <p num="32">
      Hereinafter, the present invention will be described by way of illustrative examples with reference to the accompanying drawings.
      <br/>
      The same reference numerals designate the same components.
    </p>
    <p num="33">
      FIG. 17 is a cross-sectional view of a multidirectional controller 100 according to the present invention.
      <br/>
      FIG. 18 is a plan view of the multidirectional controller 100.
    </p>
    <p num="34">
      Referring to FIGS. 17 and 18, a main substrate 1 is formed of a thin elastic insulative substrate such as, for example, a resin substrate which is provided with line patterns made of metal foils on both surfaces thereof.
      <br/>
      A rotational electronic part 3 with a control knob 2 is soldered to a front end 80A portion (a left end portion in the figures) of the main substrate 1.
      <br/>
      Pushing-type switches 4A and 4B are soldered at the middle of the top and the bottom surfaces of the main substrate 1, respectively.
    </p>
    <p num="35">
      A rear end 80B portion (a right end portion of the figures) of the main substrate 1 is pressed through a hole 5A of a supporting member 5, and thereby fixed with a screw 6.
      <br/>
      Opposing supporting portions 5B and 5C extend from the supporting member 5 toward the front end 80A of the main substrate 1 along the surfaces of the main substrate 1.
      <br/>
      Bumps 5D and 5E project from the supporting portions 5B and 5C toward switching buttons 4C and 4D on the pushing-type switches 4A and 4B, respectively.
    </p>
    <p num="36">
      Electric signals output from the rotational electronic part 3 and the pushing-type switches 4A and 4B are transmitted through the lines patterned on the main substrate 1 to a connecting terminal 1A at the rear end 80B of the main substrate 1.
      <br/>
      The electric signals are then transmitted through a flexible line substrate (not shown) connected to the connecting terminal 1A to a circuit of an apparatus (not shown) including this multidirectional controller 100.
    </p>
    <p num="37">
      The rotational electronic part 3 is manipulated by rotating the control knob 2 in horizontal (circumferential) and vertical directions with respect to the surface of the main substrate 1.
      <br/>
      When the control knob 2 is pressed in the vertical direction with respect to the surface of the main substrate 1, the portion of the main substrate 1 that is outside of the supporting member 5 bends in the vertical direction with respect to the surface of the main substrate 1.
    </p>
    <p num="38">
      When the switching button 4C or 4D makes contact with the bumps 5D or 5E, the pushing-type switch 4A or 4B is switched on or off.
      <br/>
      When the above-described vertical force on the control knob 2 is released, the main substrate 1 returns from the bent position to its neutral position due to its elastic restoring force.
    </p>
    <p num="39">Specifically, the multidirectional controller 100 is manipulated in the vertical directions at the control knob 2 by utilizing the elastic restoring force of the main substrate 1, while it is manipulated in the horizontal directions by rotationally manipulating the control knob 2.</p>
    <p num="40">
      However, the above-described multidirectional controller 100 has the following problems.
      <br/>
      When the control knob 2 is pressed in the vertical directions with respect to the surface of the main substrate 1, the main substrate 1 bends.
      <br/>
      This force for bending the main substrate 1 is added to the force required for switching the pushing-type switches 4A or 4B, which results in an insufficient (or a "dull") click feeling upon manipulating the switches.
      <br/>
      Moreover, since the portion of the main substrate 1 where the pushing-type switches 4A and 4B are provided also bends to a certain degree, the manipulation stroke becomes larger and the switching control therefore becomes unstable.
    </p>
    <p num="41">EXAMPLE 1</p>
    <p num="42">Hereinafter, an example of a multidirectional controller 200 according to the first example of the present invention which overcomes the above-described problems will be described with reference to FIGS. 1 through 4.</p>
    <p num="43">
      FIG. 1 is a cross-sectional view showing the multidirectional controller 200 according to the first example of the present invention and FIG. 2 is a plan view showing the multidirectional controller 200.
      <br/>
      Components having like functions and effects are denoted by the same reference numerals as those in FIGS. 17 and 18, and the description thereof is omitted.
    </p>
    <p num="44">
      Referring to FIGS. 1 and 2, the multidirectional controller 200 according to the first example of the present invention includes a base substrate 11 having a thin supporting point 15 at a rear end 80B portion of the base substrate 11.
      <br/>
      The thin supporting point 15 acts as a supporting point for the base substrate 11 to sway without bending.
      <br/>
      Herein, the term "sway" refers to a movement of a substrate which may bend at a predetermined portion but the remaining major portion of the substrate remains straight to move in vertical directions.
      <br/>
      The multidirectional controller 200 further includes an encoder 3 (as an electronic part 3) with the rotational disk-shape control knob 2 at a front end 80A portion of the base substrate 11.
      <br/>
      A supporting member 13 supports the base substrate 11.
      <br/>
      Switches 4A and 4B function in response to the sway of the base substrate 11.
    </p>
    <p num="45">
      The supporting member 13 includes opposing supporting portions 14A and 14B.
      <br/>
      The base substrate 11 is integrated with the supporting member 13 with, for example, a resin.
    </p>
    <p num="46">
      As shown in FIG. 2, a flexible substrate 16 is folded at line X so as to be laterally aligned with the base substrate 11, and is secured to the substrate 11 by engaging one or more dowels 11A which extend through holes 16A provided through the flexible substrate 16.
      <br/>
      The flexible substrate 16 has a line pattern formed from a metal foil or the like.
      <br/>
      The rotational electronic part 3, i.e., the rotation-type encoder 3 has predetermined click adjustments and is soldered to the line pattern of the flexible substrate 16.
      <br/>
      In this manner, a main substrate 17 (FIG. 1) including the line pattern, the flexible substrate 16 and the base substrate 11 is formed.
    </p>
    <p num="47">The pushing-type switches 4A and 4B are soldered to the line pattern on the flexible substrate 16 in between the encoder 3 and the thin supporting point 15.</p>
    <p num="48">
      The rear end 80B of the base substrate 11 is attached to the supporting member 13 via the thin supporting point 15.
      <br/>
      The opposing supporting portions 14A and 14B extend from the supporting member 13 toward the front end 80A of the base substrate 11 along the surfaces of the base substrate 11.
      <br/>
      Bumps 14C and 14D are provided so as to touch the switching buttons 4C and 4D on the switches 4A and 4B, respectively.
      <br/>
      In FIG. 1, the base substrate 11 is shown to be maintained at a neutral position where neither of the pushing-type switches 4A and 4B are switched by the pressure of the bumps 14C and 14D.
    </p>
    <p num="49">
      As shown in FIG. 2, the line pattern on the flexible substrate 16 includes an electric signal lead portion 16B for leading the electric signals from the encoder 3 and the switches 4A and 4B to the outside of the multidirectional controller.
      <br/>
      The electric signal lead portion 16B is provided outwardly sideways from a side of the base substrate 11.
    </p>
    <p num="50">FIG. 3 is a cross-sectional view showing the multidirectional controller 200 according to the first example of the present invention mounted in a multidirectional controlling device 210.</p>
    <p num="51">The multidirectional controller 200 is secured to the multidirectional controlling device (i.e., an electronic apparatus) 210 preferably by a screw 19 such that the bottom surface of the supporting portion 14B is attached to a main case 18 of the multidirectional controlling device 210 and such that a part of the control knob 2 (hereinafter, referred to as "a projecting knob portion 2A") projects through an opening 20 in the main case 18.</p>
    <p num="52">Hereinafter, an operation of the multidirectional controller 200 according to the first example of the present invention will be described.</p>
    <p num="53">
      As shown in FIG. 2, when the projecting knob portion 2A is rotated in horizontal directions with respect to the surface of the base substrate 11 as indicated by an arrow, the encoder 3 generates pulse signals corresponding to the rotation direction wherein the control knob 2 rotates in discrete increments (i.e., at predetermined click adjustments).
      <br/>
      The pulse signals are transmitted to a circuit provided in the electronic apparatus via the electric signal lead portion 16B of the flexible substrate 16.
    </p>
    <p num="54">Once this rotational manipulation is finished, the control knob 2 remains at the predetermined clicking adjustment.</p>
    <p num="55">FIG. 4 is a cross-sectional view showing the multidirectional controller 200 according to the first example of the present invention mounted in the multidirectional controlling device 210, in one operational position.</p>
    <p num="56">
      As shown in FIG. 4, when the projecting knob portion 2A is pressed in an upward direction as indicated by a white arrow, the base substrate 11 upwardly sways via the thin supporting point 15 without bending.
      <br/>
      As a result, the switching button 4C on the pushing-type switch 4A is pressed by the bump 14C, thereby activating the pushing-type switch 4A.
      <br/>
      Signals generated by the switching on of the pushing-type switch 4A are transmitted to the circuit of the electronic apparatus via the electric signal lead portion 16B.
    </p>
    <p num="57">When the pressing force in the upward direction is released from the projecting knob portion 2A, the base substrate 11 will return to its neutral position due to its restoring force.</p>
    <p num="58">
      Similarly, when the projecting knob portion 2A is pressed in a downward direction, the base substrate 11 downwardly sways via the thin supporting point 15 without bending.
      <br/>
      As a result, the switching button 4D on the pushing-type switch 4B is pressed by the bump 14D, thereby activating the pushing-type switch 4B.
    </p>
    <p num="59">
      While the control knob 2 is being pressed in the vertical directions (either up or down), the control knob 2 is settled at the predetermined click adjustment of the encoder 3.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the control knob 2 does not rotate in horizontal directions with respect to the base substrate 11 and thus a pulse signal is not generated by the encoder 3.
    </p>
    <p num="60">The restoring force of the pushing-type switches 4A and 4B for maintaining the main substrate 17 (and thus the control knob 2) at the neutral position, and the force required for pressing the switches 4A and 4B, i.e., the force against the restoring forces are preferably large so that the main substrate 17 (and thus the control knob 2) is stable.</p>
    <p num="61">According to the first example of the present invention, the base substrate 11 sways in the vertical directions via the thin supporting point 15 without bending for the switching on and off the switch 4A or 4B.</p>
    <p num="62">
      Since a force for bending the base substrate 11 is not required in order to sway the main substrate 17, the control knob 2 is manipulated in the vertical directions with less force compared to a conventional controller.
      <br/>
      In other words, the slope (rate of change) of the force applied on the control knob 2 relative to the actual manipulating force is larger than in the conventional controller.
    </p>
    <p num="63">
      According to the first example of the present invention, the multidirectional controller 200 is provided which may be manipulated in horizontal and vertical directions (i.e., in 4 directions) and which has a satisfactory click feeling when the control knob 2 is manipulated in the vertical directions.
      <br/>
      Moreover, since the base substrate 11 sways without bending, the manipulation stroke is small, thereby stabilizing the controller 200.
    </p>
    <p num="64">
      The multidirectional controller 200 according to the first example of the present invention is provided with the encoder 3.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, a rotation-type switch may be used instead of the encoder 3.
    </p>
    <p num="65">Furthermore, the multidirectional controller 200 may be provided with an additional pushing-type switch which, for example, is switched on and off by pushing the control knob 2 at the front end 80A portion of the main substrate 11 toward the rear end 80B of the main substrate 11 as disclosed in Japanese Laid-Open Publication No. 8-203387. In this case, a multidirectional controller is provided which may be manipulated in 5 directions.</p>
    <p num="66">Alternatively, a multidirectional controller which is manipulated in 3 directions may be provided by omitting either one of the switches 4A or 4B on the main substrate 17.</p>
    <p num="67">It can be appreciated that the same effect may be obtained in the case where the bumps 14C and 14D are provided on the main substrate 17 and where the switches 4A and 4B are provided on the opposing supporting portions 14A and 14B, respectively.</p>
