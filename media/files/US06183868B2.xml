    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">
      The present invention relates to spindle-shape goethite particles and a process for producing the same, spindle-shaped hematite particles and a process for producing the same, and spindle-shaped magnetic iron based alloy particles and a process for producing the same.
      <br/>

    <p num="3">
      Miniaturized and lightweight video or audio magnetic recording and play-back apparatuses for long-time recording have recently shown a remarkable progress.
      <br/>
      Especially, video tape recorders (VTR) have rapidly spread wide and more miniaturized and lighter-weight VTR's for longer-time recording have been developed rapidly.
      <br/>
      With this development, magnetic recording media such as a magnetic tape have been strongly required to have a higher performance and a higher recording density.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      In other words, magnetic recording media are required to have a higher picture quality and higher output characteristics, in particular, to improve the frequency response.
      <br/>
      For this purpose, it is necessary to improve the residual flux density (Br), the coercive force, the dispersibility, the packing property and the surface smoothness of the magnetic media, i.e., to improve the S/N ratio of the magnetic media.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      These properties of magnetic recording media strongly depend on the magnetic particles used in the magnetic recording media.
      <br/>
      In recent years, magnetic iron based alloy particles have attracted attention due to their higher coercive force and higher saturation magnetization than those of conventional iron oxide magnetic particles, and have been put to practical use as magnetic media such as digital audio tapes (DAT), 8-mm video tapes, Hi-8 tapes and video floppies.
      <br/>
      Such magnetic iron based alloy particles, however, are also strongly required improvement of the properties.
    </p>
    <p num="6">The relationship between various properties of magnetic recording media and magnetic particles used therefor is described in the following.</p>
    <p num="7">In order to obtain a high picture quality, magnetic recording media for VTR's are required to improve (1) a video S/N ratio, (2) a chroma S/N ratio and (3) a video frequency response, as is obvious from the description in NIKKEI ELECTRONICS, May 3, pp. 82 to 105 (1976).</p>
    <p num="8">
      In order to improve the video S/N ratio and the chroma S/N ratio, it is important to improve the dispersibility of the magnetic particles in a vehicle, the orientation property and the packing property of the magnetic particles in a coating film, and the surface smoothness of the magnetic recording media.
      <br/>
      Such magnetic particles are required to have a narrow particle size distribution, to include no dendrites and, in addition, to have appropriate particle shape and aspect ratio.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      In order to improve the video frequency response, it is necessary that the magnetic recording medium has high coercive force Hc and residual flux density Br.
      <br/>
      In order to enhance the coercive force Hc of the magnetic medium, magnetic particles are required to have as high a coercive force as possible.
      <br/>
      Since the coercive force of magnetic particles is generally dependent upon the shape anisotropy, the coercive force has a tendency to increment with the increase in the aspect ratio of the magnetic particles.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      For increasing the output characteristics, Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open (KOKAI) No. 63-26821 (1988) describes: "FIG. 1 shows the relationship between the S.F.D. and the recording and play-back output of the magnetic disk . . . . The relationship between the S.F.D. and the recording and play-back output is linear, as is seen from FIG. 1, which proves that the use of ferromagnetic particles having a small S.F.D. value enhances the recording and play-back output.
      <br/>
      That is, in order to increase the recording and play-back output, the S.F.D. should be as small as possible.
      <br/>
      In order to obtain a higher output than the ordinary one, it is necessary that the S.F.D. is not more than 0.6." As is clear from the above descriptions, it is necessary that the S.F.D. (Switching Field Distribution), i.e., the coercive force distribution should be as small as possible.
      <br/>
      For this purpose, magnetic particles are required to have as narrow a particle size distribution as possible and to include no dendrites.
    </p>
    <p num="11">As described above, magnetic iron based alloy particles which have a narrow particle size distribution, which include no dendrites, which have appropriate particle shape and aspect ratio, and which have a high coercive force and an excellent coercive force distribution, are now in the strongest demand.</p>
    <p num="12">
      Magnetic iron based alloy particles are usually obtained by, if necessary, heat-treating in a non-reducing atmosphere and heat-treating in a reducing gas atmosphere, goethite particles as precursor particles, hematite particles obtained by dehydrating the goethite particles, the goethite particles containing metals other than iron and the hematite particles containing metals other than iron.
      <br/>
      Consequently, magnetic iron based alloy particles are succeeded to the shape of the goethite particles as precursor particles, and it is known that the larger the aspect ratio of the goethite particles, the larger the aspect ratio of the magnetic iron based alloy particles become.
      <br/>
      It is, therefore, necessary to use goethite particles having a narrow particle size distribution, including no dendrites, and having appropriate particle shape and aspect ratio in order to produce magnetic iron based alloy particles which have various properties described above.
      <br/>
      It is also necessary that the magnetic iron based alloy particles should retain and inherit the particle shape and narrow particle size distribution in the heat-treating process.
    </p>
    <p num="13">
      Various methods are conventionally known as a method of producing goethite particles as a precursor particles of magnetic iron based alloy particles.
      <br/>
      Especially, the following methods are known as a method of adding a metal compound in advance such as Co compounds which has an effect on improvement of the magnetic properties on the magnetic iron based alloy particles, and Al compounds which has a high anti-sintering effect on the magnetic iron based alloy particles and has an excellent shape retention property.
    </p>
    <p num="14">For example, a method of producing accusal goethite particles comprising oxidizing a suspension containing colloidal ferrous hydroxide which is obtained by adding not more than one equivalent of an aqueous alkali hydroxide solution to a ferrous salt solution in the presence of a cobalt compound, introducing an oxygen-containing gas into the suspension at 50 (degree)  C., and further bringing the accusal goethite particles into growth reaction (Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open (KOKAI) No. 7-11310 (1995));</p>
    <p num="15">
      a method of producing spindle-shaped goethite particles comprising introducing an oxygen-containing gas into a suspension containing FeCO3 which is obtained by reacting a ferrous salt solution with an acidic Al salt compound with an aqueous alkali carbonate solution with a basic Al salt compound added thereto (Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open (KOKAI) No. 6-228614 (1994));
      <br/>
      a method of producing a growth of the goethite seed particles comprising hydrolyzing a neutralized solution of a ferric salt and a Co compound with an aqueous hydroxide solution, and hydrolyzing the neutralized solution, in an aqueous ferric salt solution containing an Al compound with an aqueous hydroxide solution (Japanese Patent Publication No. 58-176902 (1983)); and
      <br/>
      a method of producing spindle-shaped goethite particles comprising aging, in a non-oxidizing atmosphere, a suspension containing a precipitate comprising ferrous which is obtained by neutralizing an aqueous alkali carbonate solution with a ferrous salt solution, and introducing an oxygen-containing gas into the suspension so as to oxidize the suspension, wherein a Co compound is added in advance to a solution selected from the ferrous salt solution, the suspension containing a precipitate comprising ferrous and the aged suspension containing a precipitate comprising ferrous before the oxidization, and an aqueous solution of a compound of at least one selected from the group consisting of Al, Si, Ca, Mg, Ba, Sr and rare earth elements such as Nd is added to the ferrous salt solution in the course of oxidization at the stage where Fe2+ content in the ferrous salt solution is 50 to 90%, under the same condition as that of the oxidization, so that the compound is 0.1 to 5.0 mol % (calculated as the elements added) based on the Fe2+ of the ferrous salt solution (Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open (KOKAI) No. 7-126704 (1995)).
    </p>
    <p num="16">Each of the above Japanese Kokais also describes the magnetic iron based alloy particles obtained from the respective goethite particles as precursor particles.</p>
    <p num="17">As hematite particles in which the ratio of the X-ray crystallite size is specified, is conventionally known accusal hemnatite fire particles (Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open (KOKAI) No. 7-206446 (1995)), in which the ratio D104 /D110 of the X-ray crystallite size D104 perpendicular to the face (104) and the X-ray crystallite size D110 perpendicular to the face (110) is in the range of 1 to 2, and the specific surface area is 40 to 50 m2 /g.</p>
    <p num="18">
      The spindle-shaped magnetic iron based alloy particles which have a narrow particle size distribution, include no dendrites, have appropriate particle shape and aspect ratio, and have a high coercive force and an excellent coercive force distribution are now in the strongest demand.
      <br/>
      The magnetic iron based alloy particles obtained from the goethite particles described in the above-described Japanese Kokais, however, cannot be said to adequately satisfy those properties.
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      According to the process described in Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open (KOKAI) No. 7-11310 (1995), acicular goethite particles having an aspect ratio of not less than 10 and containing Co are produced.
      <br/>
      However, dendrite particles are included together with the goethite particles and they cannot be said to have a narrow particle size distribution.
    </p>
    <p num="20">
      According to the process described in Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open (KOKAI) No. 6-228614 (1994), it is possible to produce goethite particles including no dendrites and having a narrow particle size distribution by adopting an appropriate method of adding Al.
      <br/>
      However, the aspect ratio cannot be said to be sufficient.
    </p>
    <p num="21">
      According to the process described in Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open (KOKAI) No. 7-126704 (1995), Al is added in the course of oxidization.
      <br/>
      However, Co ions still remain in the solution in the course of oxidization.
      <br/>
      The present inventors found that if Al is added to the solution in the presence of Co ions, and the remaining ferrous ions are oxidized to grow goethite particles, the particles remarkably grow in the direction of a minor axis, so that the aspect ratio is lowered.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, it is impossible to produce goethite particles having a large aspect ratio, especially, an aspect ratio of not less than 13.
    </p>
    <p num="22">According to the process described in Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open (KOKAI) No. 58-176902 (1983), it is different from the reaction in the present invention in that the reaction mechanism is not oxidization but hydrolysis, and in that hydrothermal reaction is conducted at a high temperature exceeding 100 (degree)  C. for a secondary reaction.</p>
    <p num="23">In addition, it cannot be said that the magnetic iron based alloy particles obtained from the goethite particles produced by each of the methods described above have a narrow particle size distribution, include no dendrites and have a large aspect ratio.</p>
    <p num="24">
      In the acicular hematite particles described in Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open (KOKAI) No. 7-206446 (1995), the X-ray crystallite size ratio (D104 /D110) is in the range of 1 to 2, which is different from the range specified by the present invention.
      <br/>
      Since D110 is smaller than D104, the crystallinity is completely different from that of the magnetic iron based alloy particles of the present invention.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, the acicular hematite particles are obtained by hydrothermal (autoclaving) reaction.
      <br/>
      Although hematite particles in which the X-ray crystallite size ratio (D104 /D110) is 0.7 and which are obtained by heating and dehydrating goethite particles are described as a comparative example, the X-ray crystallite size ratio (D104 /D110) also is out of the range specified by the present invention.
    </p>
    <p num="25">Accordingly, the technical problems of the present invention is to provide spindle-shaped goethite particles or spindle-shaped hematite particles which have a narrow particle size distribution and include no dendrites, and to provide spindle-shaped magnetic iron based alloy particles which are produced from the said spindle-shaped goethite particles or spindle-shaped hematite particles as precursor particles, and which have a high coercive force and an excellent coercive force distribution.</p>
    <p num="26">
      As a result of studies undertaken by the present inventors so as to solve the above-described problems, it has been found that by aging an aqueous suspension containing a precipitate comprising ferrous which is obtained by reacting (neutralizing) a mixed aqueous alkali solution of an aqueous alkali carbonate solution and an aqueous alkali hydroxide solution with a ferrous salt solution, in a non-oxidizing atmosphere;
      <br/>
      introducing (blowing) an oxygen-containing gas into the aqueous suspension so as to produce spindle-shaped goethite seed particles, wherein in the process of producing the seed particles, a cobalt compound in which the Co content is 0.5 to 25 atm % (calculated as Co) based on the total Fe in the spindle-shaped goethite particles is added to one selected from the group consisting of the ferrous salt solution, the aqueous suspension containing the precipitate comprising ferrous, the aqueous suspension containing the precipitate comprising ferrous in the course of aging, i.e., before the beginning of the oxidization reaction, and the aqueous suspension in the course of producing the goethite seed particles;
      <br/>
      adding a mixed aqueous alkali solution of an aqueous alkali carbonate solution and an aqueous alkali hydroxide solution and a ferrous salt solution to the aqueous suspension containing the seed particles; and
      <br/>
      introducing (blowing) an oxygen-containing gas into the aqueous suspension so as to grow goethite on the particle surfaces of the spindle-shaped goethite seed particles, wherein in the process of growing the goethite, an aluminum compound in which the Al content is 0.5 to 15 atm % (calculated as Al) based on the total Fe in the spindle-shaped goethite particles is added to one selected from the group consisting of the aqueous alkali solutions added, the ferrous salt solution, the aqueous suspension containing the spindle-shaped seed particles and the precipitate comprising ferrous before the beginning of the oxidization reaction, and the aqueous suspension in the course of growing the goethite,
      <br/>
      the obtained spindle-shaped goethite particles have a narrow particle size distribution, include no dendrites and have appropriate particle shape and aspect ratio; and
      <br/>
      it has been further found that by heating (dehydrating) the spindle-shaped goethite particles, the obtained spindle-shaped hematite particles have a narrow particle size distribution, include no dendrites, have appropriate particle shape and aspect ratio, and have a high coercive force and an excellent coercive force distribution; and
      <br/>
      by further heat-treating in a reducing gas atmosphere the spindle-shaped goethite particles, the obtained magnetic spindle-shaped iron based alloy particles have a narrow particle size distribution, include no dendrites, have appropriate particle shape and aspect ratio, and have a high coercive force and an excellent coercive force distribution, so that these iron based alloy particles are suitable as magnetic particles for magnetic media having high recording density, high sensitivity and high output.
      <br/>
      The present invention has been achieved on the basis of this finding.

    <p num="131">
      In order to improve the shape and the like of goethite particles as precursor particles of magnetic iron based alloy particles, various metal salts have been added.
      <br/>
      Especially, Co is known to form a solid solution with iron in the magnetic iron based alloy particles, and to enhance the magnetization and the coercive force.
      <br/>
      Al is known to contribute to prevention of the sintering in magnetic iron based alloy particles and to be excellent in shape retention.

    <p num="132">
      It is also known that when Co becomes a solid solution in the process of producing goethite particles, fine particles are obtained and goethite particles having an approximately large aspect ratio are obtained due to a small minor axial diameter.
      <br/>
      On the other hand, since the particles are extremely fine, it is difficult to obtain particles suitable for use.
      <br/>
      It is known that Al has a crystal growth controlling effect and that the aspect ratio is greatly different depending upon the timing of adding Al and the amount of Al added.
      <br/>
      For example, when an Al compound is added in the course of growth of the goethite particles, the aspect ratio be lowered.
      <br/>
      It has been found that if an Al compound and Co ions are co-exist simultaneously, the aspect ratio of the goethite particles is lowered extremely.
    </p>
    <p num="133">Further, it has been found that when the production of goethite particles is separated into two processes, i.e., the process of producing seed particles and the process of growth reaction, Co which shows the effect of appropriately increasing the aspect ratio is added in the process of producing seed particles so as to make a substitution of Co ion for Fe ion in the goethite seed particles in a crystal structure, and Al which shows an anti-sintering effect is added to the ferrous salt solution and the mixed aqueous alkali solution in the process of the growth reaction, when the solution contains no Co, so that Al is present only in the growth reaction, it is possible to produce particles having a necessary aspect ratio in the course of producing the seed Particles and to obtain spindle-shaped goethite particles having a large aspect ratio and retaining an appropriate particle shape in the course of growth reaction.</p>
    <p num="134">Since particles in which Co exists in the goethite seed particles in a crystal structure and Al exists in the goethite layer as same as Co are used for precursor particles, it is possible to produce spindle-shaped magnetic iron based alloy particles having a narrow particle size distribution, including no dendrites, having appropriate particle shape and aspect ratio, and having a high coercive force and an excellent coercive force distribution.</p>
    <p num="135">When a rare earth element exists in the surface layer, since the minor axial diameter of the goethite particles obtained becomes slightly large, the aspect ratio is lowered.</p>
    <p num="136">
      It is known that as the aspect ratio becomes larger, the coercive force of the magnetic iron based alloy particles generally becomes higher.
      <br/>
      On the other hand, if a rare earth element is contained in the surface layer, the aspect ratio of the goethite particles becomes small, as described above.
      <br/>
      However, the goethite particles having a rare earth element in the surface layers have a higher coercive force than the goethite particles obtained by using a rare earth element only as an anti-sintering agent.
      <br/>
      This is considered due to the difference in the state In which a rare earth element exists.
    </p>
    <p num="137">In addition, by adding a rare earth element together with an Al compound in the course of growing the goethite layer, it is possible to prevent sintering during reducing the heated spindle-shaped goethite particles so as to produce spindle-shaped magnetic iron based alloy particles therefrom and to improve the S.F.D. (coercive force distribution) when a sheet is produced by using such magnetic iron based alloy particles.</p>
    <p num="138">Furthermore, it has been found that when the ratio D104 /D110 of the X-ray crystallite size in the spindle-shaped hematite particles obtained by subjecting the spindle-shaped goethite particles to anti-sintering treatment by using an anti-sintering agent of the rare earth element, etc., and dehydrating the thus-treated spindle-shaped goethite particles is in specific range, the S.F.D.

    <p num="139">When a rare earth element is used as an anti-sintering agent for the spindle-shaped goethite particles, it is to easily obtain the ratio D104 /D110 of 0.2 to 0.65 of the X-ray crystallite size of the spindle-shaped hematite particles obtained by appropriately selecting the dehydration temperature, and when a sheet is produced by using such magnetic iron based alloy particles obtained by heat-treating these hematite particles, the S.F.D. (coercive force distribution) is improved.</p>
