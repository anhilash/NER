      A sense amplifier includes current mirror circuits, a NOR gate, inverters and a read data transition detection circuit.
      <br/>
      First and second read data respectively output from the inverters are input to the read data transition detection circuit.
      <br/>
      This read data transition detection circuit includes a NOR gate and outputs a logically low level transition detection signal to a data transition node when either of the first and second read data is at a logically high level.
      <br/>
      The output circuit corresponding to the sense amplifier receives the first read data in response to the transition detection signal.

    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="1">
      1.
      <br/>
      Field of the Invention
    </p>
    <p num="2">The present invention relates to a semiconductor memory.</p>
    <p num="3">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
    <p num="4">
      Generally, in the data read operation of a dynamic random access memory (DRAM) as a semiconductor memory, a predetermined data as stored is first transmitted from a memory cell to a sense amplifier through a column switch, thereby being amplified there.
      <br/>
      This amplified data is further transmitted to an output circuit and is then read out to the outside of the DRAM.
    </p>
    <p num="5">In a prior art DRAM, when transmitting the read data from the sense amplifier to the output circuit, the sense amplifier and the output circuit have been controlled by an address transition detection signal (referred to as "signal ATD" hereinafter) and a data read control signal (referred to as "signal WE" hereinafter).</p>
    <p num="6">In general, in case of the DRAM which includes a complementary data line provided between the sense amplifier and the output circuit, the sense amplifier is controlled by the signal ATD and signal WE, and the input of the read data to the output circuit is executed in response to the level transition of the complementary data line.</p>
    <p num="7">
      Recently, however, the ATD signal speed has been made higher in association with the access speed to the DRAM.
      <br/>
      Thus, in such a DRAM that its output circuit is controlled by the ATD signal in order to stabilize the input of the read data to the output circuit, it is needed to provide a delay circuit for delaying the ATD signal, in order to provide a predetermined margin for the input timing of the read data.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      On one hand, in such a DRAM that the input of the read data to the output circuit is carried out in response to the level transition of the complementary data line, it is not necessary to provide any delay circuit for delaying the ATD signal.
      <br/>
      In this case, however, it is absolutely required to provide the complementary data line.
      <br/>
      Contrary to this, in case of a so-called single data line DRAM which is provided with no complementary data line for the purpose of reducing the chip area, such a delay circuit as mentioned above has to be provided inevitably.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      Generally, in the DRAM, a plurality of sense amplifiers and output circuits are controlled in the same timing.
      <br/>
      Therefore, if the number of sense amplifiers and output circuits is increased to comply with the increase in the memory capacity, the noise generation caused when reading the data comes out as another problem to be concerned with.
    </p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="10">
      The present invention has been made in consideration of such problems as described above.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, the first object of the invention is to provide a semiconductor memory which can not only minimize the enlargement of the circuit scale but comply with the high speed access, and the second object of the invention is to provide a semiconductor memory which can prevent the noise generation which might be caused when reading the data.
    </p>
    <p num="11">
      In order to achieve the objects as described above, according to the invention, there is provided a semiconductor memory which includes n sense amplifiers (n: an integer of two and more) which amplify the data as stored and output the amplified data as the read data, and n output circuits (n: an integer of two and more) which output the output data based on the read data outputted from each of the sense amplifiers.
      <br/>
      Each of the sense amplifiers provided in this semiconductor memory includes a read data transition detection circuit which detects that there has been decided the level transition of each read data to be outputted to each of the output circuits, and outputs a read data transition detection signal.
      <br/>
      Each of the output circuits receives the read data outputted from each of the sense amplifiers in response to the read data transition detection signal outputted from the read data transition detection circuit which is provided in each of the corresponding sense amplifiers.
      <br/>
      According to the constitution of the semiconductor memory as described above, even if the semiconductor memory employs a single data line structure, there can be achieved the high speed input of the read data to each of the output circuits.
    </p>
    <p num="12">
      Each of the output circuits receives the read data outputted from each of the sense amplifiers based on all the read data transition detection signals which indicate that there have been decided all the level transitions of the read data outputted from each of the sense amplifiers.
      <br/>
      The semiconductor memory of the invention may be further provided with a first control circuit which detects that all the level transitions of the read data have been decided, and outputs all the read data transition detection signals.
      <br/>
      According to the semiconductor memory as constituted above, each output circuit can judge the level transitions of the read data outputted from n sense amplifiers at a time, based on all the read data transition detection signals.
      <br/>
      That is, it becomes possible not only to minimize the enlargement of the circuit scale but to input the read data to each of the output circuit at the high speed.
    </p>
    <p num="13">
      The first control circuit outputs a reset signal all the time until all the sense amplifiers output the read data transition detection signals, after any one of n sense amplifiers having decided the level transition of the read data at first, has outputted the read data transition detection signal.
      <br/>
      Each of the output circuits preferably sets its output node for putting out the output data in the high impedance state in response to the reset signal.
      <br/>
      According to the constitution as describe above, it becomes possible to reduce the power consumption in each output circuit and also to prevent the output noise from being generated.
    </p>
    <p num="14">
      The first output circuit of n output circuits sets its first output node for putting out the output data in the high impedance state in response to the reset signal, and receives the read data outputted from the corresponding sense amplifier in response to the all the read data transition detection signals; the second output circuit of n output circuits sets its second output node in the high impedance state based on that the first output node is set in the high impedance state, and receives the read data outputted from the corresponding sense amplifier based on that there has been decided the level transition of the output data outputted from the first output circuit; and the kth output circuit (k: an integer of three through n) of n output circuits sets its kth output node in the high impedance state based on that the k-1th output node of the k-1th output circuit is set in the high impedance state, and receives the read data outputted from the corresponding sense amplifier based on that there has been decided the level transition of the output data outputted from the k-1th output circuit.
      <br/>
      According to the constitution as described above, since each node in n output circuits is once set in the high impedance state, it becomes possible to reduce the power consumption in each output circuit and also to prevent the output noise from being generated.
      <br/>
      Moreover, since each output circuit comes to receive the read data outputted from each sense amplifier on the read data by read data basis, it becomes possible to further reduce the noise generation which might take place when receiving the read data and/or outputting the output data.
    </p>
    <p num="15">
      The n output circuits can be divided into m output circuit groups (m: an integer of two or more).
      <br/>
      The first control circuit is assigned to the first output circuit group while the ith control circuit (i: an integer of two through m) is assigned to the ith output circuit group.

      The ith control circuit sets the output nodes in one or more than two of output circuits in the high impedance state based on that the output node in at least one output circuit of one or more than two of output circuits belonging to the i-1th output circuit group is set in the high impedance state, and detects that there have been decided all the level transitions of the output data outputted from one or more than two of output circuits belonging to the i-1th output circuit group, and further allows one or more than two of output circuits belonging to the ith output circuit group to receive the read data outputted from the corresponding sense amplifier.
      <br/>
      With the constitution as described above, each of output circuit groups formed by dividing n output circuits comes to receive the read data on the basis of read data by read data.
      <br/>
      Thus, it becomes possible to reduce the noise generation which might take place when receiving the read data and/or outputting the output data based on that data input.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, since output circuit groups operate on the group by group basis, the output delay of the output data can be obviated or minimized.

      The i-1th output circuit group preferably supplies the ith control circuit with signals which are the i-1th output node status signal indicating that at least one output node of respective nodes in one or more than two of output circuits belonging to the i-1th output circuit group is set in the high impedance state, and the i-1th output data transition detection signal indicating that there have been decided all the level transitions of the output data outputted from each output node in one or more than two of output circuits belonging to the i-1th output circuit group.
      <br/>
      With the constitution as described above, it becomes possible, without enlarging the circuit scale, to transmit the output node state and the level transition state of the output data in one or more than two of the output circuits belonging to the i-1th output circuit group to the ith output circuit group.

      According to the constitution as described above, the output node in each output circuit can be set in the high impedance state with ease, thus enabling the power consumption to be reduced as a result thereof.
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      Furthermore, the read data holding portion can employ the structure including a latch circuit consisting of two inverters, or an RS flip-flop circuit.
      <br/>

      According to the constitution as described above, each sense amplifier comes to start the operation of sense amplification and outputting the read data, so that it becomes possible to prevent the noise generation.

      <br/>
      According to the constitution as mentioned above, each of sense amplifier groups as a result of dividing n sense amplifiers comes to start the operation of amplification and outputting the read data on the step by step basis or amplifier by amplifier basis.
      <br/>
      Thus, it becomes possible to reduce the noise generation which might take place when starting the operation of amplification and/or outputting the read data.

      <br/>
      The drains of P- and N-transistors 57 and 58 are respectively connected with the output node nDO for putting out the output data DO1.
    </p>
    <p num="45">The operation of the DRAM 1 as constituted above according to the first embodiment will now be explained in the following.</p>
    <p num="46">
      In the DRAM 1, when the read operation is started, for instance, memory cell data BD1 and /BD1 are read out from a predetermined memory cell (not shown), such memory cell data BD1 and /BD1 pass through a column switch (not shown) and are inputted to the sense amplifier A1-1.
      <br/>
      At this time, there is a very small potential difference between the complimentary memory cell data BD1 and the memory cell data /BD1.
    </p>
    <p num="47">
      When either the signal WE or the signal ATD is at the H-level, the sense amplifier A1-1 is set in the reset state.
      <br/>
      At this stage, if the signal WE and the signal ATD are set at the L-level, the sense amplification A1-1 starts amplifying the inputted memory cell data BD1 and /BD1, that is, starts its operation of sense amplification.
    </p>
    <p num="48">
      When the sense amplifier A1-1 starts its operation of sense amplification, one of nodes N10 and n11, both of which were at the H-level by means of the current mirror circuit 3 and the current mirror circuit 5 before the operation starts, is set at the L-level.
      <br/>
      In consequence of this level change of the node n10 or n11, the NOR gate 15 of the read data transition detection circuit 13 outputs the L-level transition detection signal /DT1-1.
    </p>
    <p num="49">
      In the data write operation, the transfer gates 25 and 26 included in the data switch portion 21 of the output circuit OUT1-1 are set in the ON state by the signal WE, and the write data WD1 is supplied to both of nodes n12 and n13.
      <br/>
      Such operation is carried out for reading out a predetermined data from the latch portion 41 of the output circuit OUT1-1 immediately after that data is written to a memory cell without again accessing to that memory cell.
      <br/>
      Thus, this operation can be performed for the purpose of achieving the high-speed data read and the low power consumption.
    </p>
    <p num="50">
      Contrary to this, in case of the data read operation, the transfer gates 25 and 26 are set in the OFF state.
      <br/>
      When the node n/DT1 of the output circuit OUT1-1 receives the L-level transition detection signal /DT1-1 inputted from the sense amplifier A1-1, both of N-transistors 35 and 37 belonging to the read data input portion 31 are turned on.
      <br/>
      Then, both of N-transistors 36 and 38 belonging to the read data input portion 31 are turned on/off in response to the level of the read data RD1 supplied to the node nRD from the sense amplifier A1-1, thereby each level of the nodes n12 and n13 being decided.
    </p>
    <p num="51">
      For instance, when the data "0" is read out from the memory cell, the sense amplifier A1-1 outputs the read data RD1 of the L-level from the node nRD.
      <br/>
      When the read data RD1 of the L-level is inputted to the output circuit OUT1-1, both of N-transistors 37 and 38 belonging to the read data input portion 31 are turned on, so that the nodes n13 is set at the L-level while the node n14 is set at the H-level by the latch portion 41.
    </p>
    <p num="52">
      Furthermore, since the output control signal OE is at the H-level, the node n16 is set at the H-level by the NAND gate 54 while the node n17 is set at the H-level by the NAND gate 55.
      <br/>
      The logical levels of both of nodes n12 and n13 are latched by the latch portion 41.
    </p>
    <p num="53">
      Still further, since both of the nodes n16 and n17 are set at the H-level, the P-transistor 57 is set in the OFF state while the N-transistor 58 is set in the ON state.
      <br/>
      As a result, the L-level output data DO1 is outputted from the output node nDO.
    </p>
    <p num="54">
      As described above, according to the DRAM 1 of the first embodiment, the input of the read data RD1.about.RD4 to the output circuits OUT1-1.about.OUT 1-4 is controlled by the transition detection signals /DT1-1.about./DT1-4 outputted from the sense amplifiers A1-1.about.A1-4, respectively.
      <br/>
      Therefore, even if the DRAM 1 employs a single data line structure for the purpose of reducing the circuit scale, it is not necessary to ensure any timing margin for data read.
      <br/>
      That is, it is no longer needed to prepare any delay circuit for delaying the signal ATD, which has been provided so far, in order to ensure the timing margin for data read.

      In the next, the operation of the DRAM 61 as constituted above according to the second embodiment will be explained in the following.
      <br/>
      When the sense amplifier A2-1 starts its operation of sense amplification, one of nodes n10 and n11 both of which were at the H-level before the operation starts, is set at the L-level by means of the current mirror circuit 3 and the current mirror circuit 5.
      <br/>
      In consequence of this level change of the node n10 or n11, the NOR gate 15 outputs the L-level signal, thereby the N-transistor 67 being set in the ON state.
    </p>
    <p num="68">
      In the same manner, when all the N-transistors included in other sense amplifiers A2-2.about.A2-4 are set in the ON state, the node n/DT2C of the control circuit CNT2 is set at the L-level.
      <br/>
      Such L-level is latched by the latch portion 75 included in the control circuit CNT2 and the node n/DT2D is set at the L-level.
    </p>
    <p num="69">The node n/DT2D of the control circuit CNT2 is connected with the node n/DT1 of respective output circuits OUT1-1.about.OUT1-4, and these output circuits OUT1-1.about.OUT1-4 come to receive the read data RD1.about.RD4.</p>
    <p num="70">When the sense amplifier is in the reset state (signal WE or signal ATD=H-level), the P-transistor 73 is set in the ON state and the nodes n/DT2C and n/DT2D are reset to the H-level.</p>

      As described above, according to the DRAM 61 of the second embodiment, the transition detection signal /DT2C is set at the L-level when all the sense amplifier A2-1.about.A2-4 have outputted the read data RD1.about.RD4. With this, the read data RD1.about.RD4 are inputted to output circuits OUT1-1.about.OUT1-4, respectively.
      <br/>
      On the other hand, when any one of sense amplifiers A2-1.about.A2-4 is reset, the control circuit CNT2 outputs the H-level transition detection signal /DT2D from its node n/DT2D.
      <br/>
      With this, the read data RDIRD4 can not be inputted to output circuits OUT1-1.about.OUT1-4. In other words, the input operation of the read data RD1.about.RD4 to output circuits OUT1-1.about.OUT1-4 is controlled by the control signal /DT2D.
      <br/>
      Therefore, similar to the case of the DRAM 1 according to the first embodiment, despite that the DRAM 61 employs a single data line structure, it become possible to read the data without providing any delay circuit for delaying the signal ATD in order to ensure the timing margin.

      When the sense amplifier A4-1 starts its operation of sense amplification, one of nodes n10 and n11 both of which were at the H-level before the operation starts, is set at the L-level by means of the current mirror circuit 3 and the current mirror circuit 5.
      <br/>
      In consequence of this level change of the node n10 or n11, the NOR gate 15 outputs the L-level signal, thereby both of P- and N-transistors 95 and 87 being set in the ON state.

      When at least one of P-transistors 95 provided in sense amplifiers A4-1.about.A4-4 goes into the ON state, the reset signal /RS4A inputted to the node n/RS4A of the control circuit CNT4 is set at the L-level.
      <br/>
      Receiving this L-level reset signal /RS4A, the control circuit CNT4-1 outputs the L-level reset signal /RS9C-12 from its node n/RS4B.
      <br/>
      At this time, the control circuit CNT4-1 outputs the H-level transition detection signal /DT9E-12 from its node n/DT4D.

      <br/>
      Therefore, the P- and N-transistors 57 and 58 are turned off, and each output node nDO of output circuits OUT9-1 and OUT9-2 goes into the high impedance state.
      <br/>
      Also, the N-transistor 157 provided in the output circuit OUT9-1 goes into the ON state, thus the node n/RS9D of the output circuit OUT9-1 being set at the L-level.
      <br/>
      In the same manner, the N-transistor 157 provided in the output circuit OUT9-2 is set in the ON state, thus the node n/RS9D of the output circuit OUT9-2 being set at the L-level.

      Since the node n/DT4D of the control circuit CNT4-1 is set at the L-level, the node n/RS4B of the control circuit CNT4-1 is set at the H-level by the NAND gate 113.

      The reset signal /RS9C-12 outputted from the node n/RS4B of the control circuit CNT4-1 is set at the H-level, and the RS flip-flop 123 of output circuit OUT9-1 holds the level of both nodes n12 and n13, corresponding to the level of the read data RD1.

      As a result, each output node nDO of output circuits OUT9-1 and OUT9-2 is released from the high impedance state, thus the output data DO1 and DO2 with a predetermined level being outputted, respectively.

    <p num="229">
      Thus, each node n/RS9D of output circuits OUT9-1 and OUT9-2 is set at the H-level, and the H-level reset signal /RS9D-12 is supplied to the control circuit CNT4-2.

      Also, the node n/DT4C having been set at the L-level, the control circuit CNT4-2 outputs the L-level transition detection signal /DT9E-34 to each of output circuits OUT9-3 and OUT9-4.

      In the same manner, receiving the H-level reset signal /RS9C-34 and the L-level transition detection signal /DT9E-34, the output circuit OUT9-4 receives the read data RD4 from the sense amplifier A4-4.

      Until there are decided output data DO1 and DO2 of output circuits OUT9-1 and OUT9-2 in the first output circuit group, each output of output circuits OUT9-3 and OUT9-4 in the second output group is set in the high impedance state.
      <br/>
      After that, when there have been decided output data DO1 and DO2 of output circuits OUT9-1 and OUT9-2 in the first output circuit group, the output node nDO of output circuits OUT9-3 and OUT9-4 in the second output group is released from the high impedance state, thereby output data DO3 and DO4 being outputted.

      Therefore, despite that the DRAM 151 according to the ninth embodiment employs such a single data line structure as the DRAM 141 according to the eighth embodiment, it is not required to provide any timing margin for data read.

      Furthermore, since the current passing through the output circuit OUT9-1.about.OUT9-4 is reduced, there is effectively prevented generation of the noise that might be caused when outputting the output data DO1.about.DO4.

    <p num="236">
      Still further, since the DRAM 151 according to the ninth embodiment operates in such a manner that after one of output circuit groups has decided its output, the remaining output circuit groups starts their data output operation shifting their output timing.
      <br/>
      Therefore, even in case of employing the multi-bit structure (x 16-bit, x 32-bit), it is possible to prevent not only the output delay of the output data but also generation of the noise.

      As described above, when there has been decided each level of read data RD1 and RD2 from sense amplifiers A10-1 and A10-2 belonging to the first sense amplifier group GR11-1, the control circuit CNT11 outputs the L-level transition detection signal /DT11E to each node DT10B of sense amplifiers A10-3 and A10-4 belonging to the second sense amplifier group GR11-2.
      <br/>
      That is, sense amplifiers A10-3 and A10-4 belonging to the second sense amplifier group GR11-2 are released from the reset state and start the operation of sense amplification when there has been decided each level of the read data RD1 and RD2 from sense amplifiers A10-1 and A10-2 belonging to the first sense amplifier group GR11-1.

      The node n/DT12A of the sense amplifier A12-2 is connected with the node n/DT2C of the control circuit CNT2 while the node n/DT12C of the sense amplifier A12-2 is grounded.

    <p num="279">The operation of the DRAM 181 as constituted above according to the twelfth embodiment will be described in the following.</p>
    <p num="280">
      When the signal WE inputted to the node nWE, the signal ATD inputted to the node nATD, or the transition detection signal /DT12C inputted to the node n/DT12C is set at the H-level, sense amplifiers A12-1.about.A12-4 are set in the reset state.
      <br/>
      On one hand, when the signal WE, the signal ATD and the transition detection signal /DT12C are set at the L-level, sense amplifiers A12-1.about.A12-4 start their operation of sense amplification.
    </p>
    <p num="281">In the reset state and immediately after the operation of sense amplification, nodes n10 and n11 in respective sense amplifiers A12-1.about.A12-4 are at the H-level, so that the node n123 connected with the output terminal of the inverter 185 is set at the L-level and the N-transistor 187 is set in the OFF state.</p>

    <p num="283">When either signal WE inputted to the node nWE or signal ATD inputted to node nATD is set at the H-level, the control circuit CNT2 is reset and outputs the H-level transition detection signal /DT12D from its node n/DT12D.</p>
    <p num="284">
      When there have been decided read data RD1 and RD2 from sense amplifiers A12-1 and A12-2 belonging to the first sense amplifier group GR12-1, the L-level transition detection signal /DT12C is inputted to the node n/DT12C of the control circuit CNT2.
      <br/>
      Then, receiving this L-level transition detection signal /DT12C, the control circuit CNT2 outputs the L-level transition detection signal /DT12D from its node n/DT12D.
    </p>
    <p num="285">
      This L-level transition detection signal /DT12D is inputted to each node n/DT12C of sense amplifiers A12-3 and A12-4 belonging to the second sense amplifier group GR12-2.
      <br/>
      That is, when read data RD1 and RD2 from sense amplifiers A12-1 and A12-2 belonging to the first sense amplifier group GR12-1 have been decided, sense amplifiers A12-3 and A12-4 belonging to the second sense amplifier group GR12-2 are released from the reset state and start the operation of sense amplification thereof.

    <p num="288">
      Still further, according to the DRAM 181 of the twelfth embodiment, even if the number of sense amplifiers constituting one sense amplifier group is increase, the number of input signals to the control circuit CNT2 can be kept unchanged.
      <br/>
      Therefore, it is not required to change the circuit constitution of the control circuit CNT2.
      <br/>
      Thus, the constitution of the sense amplifier group can be changed so as to meet the specification of the DRAM 181 without enlarging the circuit scale.

      The invention is widely applicable to other semiconductor devices such as memories, registers and so forth.

    <p num="291">
      Furthermore, in the embodiments as mentioned above, the signal WE has been described as a control signal for controlling the data read.
