    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="1">This invention relates generally to printed circuit boards and manufacturing methods and particularly to printed circuit boards adapted to carry signals having very high data rates.</p>
    <p num="2">
      As is known in the art, printed circuit boards are used to couple data among electrical components mounted on a surface of such board.
      <br/>
      This data is coupled through signal conductors disposed at various levels in the board.
      <br/>
      The board also carries reference potentials, such as ground and component supply voltages.
      <br/>
      In order to provide isolation between signal conductors in the various levels, reference potential conductive planes are interspersed between the levels of signal conductors.
    </p>
    <p num="3">
      As is also known in the art, in order to connect to the components, conductive vias are provided which pass from the surface of the board to the interior region thereof for connection to the signal conductors.
      <br/>
      These vias form what are sometimes called "signal launches." Further, in many cases it is necessary to electrically connect components on one printed circuit board to components on another printed circuit board.
      <br/>
      This is typically done with an electric connector assembly.
      <br/>
      The connector assembly has two parts, each part mounted to a corresponding one of the printed circuit boards.
      <br/>
      Thus, when it is desired to connect one board to the other board, the connector parts are plugged into one another.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      Further, as is known in the art, the data rates of the signals propagating through printed circuit boards are ever increasing.
      <br/>
      As such data rates increase, it is necessary to improve the efficiency of the electrical coupling of the data passing through one of the printed circuit boards to the other printed circuit board.
      <br/>
      More particularly, the signal conductor, reference potential plane or layer, and portions of the dielectric of the board therebetween form a transmission line having a predetermined impedance, typically 50 ohms.
      <br/>
      The effect of the via provides an impedance mismatch to the impedance of the transmission line.
      <br/>
      One technique used to compensate for this impedance mismatch is to provide compensation elements in the connector.
      <br/>
      For vias with impedance below the impedance of signal traces in the boards, some connectors are designed to have a higher impedance so that on average the impedance is the same as the interconnect as it is in the board.
      <br/>
      However, signal reflections which can limit performance of an interconnect depend on changes in impedance.
    </p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="5">
      In accordance with the invention, a printed circuit board is provided having a conductive via passing from a surface of a dielectric into an interior region of the dielectric.
      <br/>
      A reference potential layer is disposed in the interior region of the dielectric parallel to the surface.
      <br/>
      A signal conductor is disposed in the dielectric parallel to the reference potential layer to provide a transmission line having a predetermined impedance.
      <br/>
      The conductive via is configured to provide an impedance to the transmission line substantially matched to the impedance of the transmission line.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      With such an arrangement, impedance matching is provided internal to the printed circuit board thereby enabling connection of such board to another board with reduced reflections caused by the impedance mismatch through the connector launch.
      <br/>
      We have recognized that matching the average impedance of an interconnect to the impedance of the board can limit performance of an interconnect, particularly for high frequency signals.
      <br/>
      We have recognized the benefits of vias with impedance that is more similar to the impedance of the printed circuit board.

    <heading>DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
    <p num="15">
      Referring now to FIGS. 1 and 2, a printed circuit board assembly 10 is shown.
      <br/>
      The assembly includes a pair of multi-level printed circuit boards 12, 14; one typically being a backplane printed circuit board 12 and the other a daughtercard printed circuit board 14.
      <br/>
      Each one of the boards 12, 14 includes a dielectric 16 having in the interior region 17 thereof, a plurality of electrical conductors 18 disposed in various levels of the board, an exemplary one of such levels of signal conductors 18 being shown in detail in FIGS. 3 and 4.
      <br/>
      Disposed between levels of the electrical conductors 18 are reference potential layers, or sheets 20 of electrically conductive material.
      <br/>
      These reference potential layers 20 are used to provide ground potential or reference voltages to electrical components, not shown, mounted on the surface of the printed circuit board 12, 14.
      <br/>
      Conductive vias 22, an exemplary one thereof being shown, pass from the surface 24 of the dielectric 16 into the interior region 17 of the dielectric 16.
      <br/>
      The electrical conductor 18 is connected to the conductive via 22, as shown.
    </p>
    <p num="16">
      As noted above, a plurality of reference potential layers 20 is disposed in the dielectric 16 between, and parallel to, the electrical conductors 18.
      <br/>
      These reference potential layers 20 also provide electric shielding between the signal conductor 18 disposed between a pair of the reference potential layers 20.
      <br/>
      It is noted that a reference potential layer 20, the underlying signal conductor 18 and the portion of the dielectric 16 therebetween provide a microstrip transmission line 25 having a predetermined impedance, such as 50 ohms.
      <br/>
      It is also noted that the signal conductor 18 is connected to the conductive via 22.
      <br/>
      Here, the conductive via 22 is configured to provide a termination impedance to the microstrip transmission line 25 substantially matched to the impedance of the microstrip transmission line 25.
      <br/>
      More particularly, the shape of the conductive via 22 and the separation between conductive via 22 and the edges 48 of the reference potential layers 20 are selected to terminate the microstrip transmission line 25 formed by such conductive sheet 20, the conductor 18, and the portion of the dielectric 16 therebetween into a matched load, i.e., into a termination impedance matched to the impedance of such microstrip transmission line 25 thereby maximizing the efficiency of the transfer of the data on the signal conductor 18 to the conductive via 22.
    </p>
    <heading>EXAMPLE</heading>
    <p num="17">
      A test board was constructed using the configuration of FIG. 4.
      <br/>
      The board had a thickness of 0.222 inches.
      <br/>
      The wider portion 29 of via 22 had a diameter of 0.026 inches, with an inside diameter, after application of a conductive layer on the surfaces of the hole, of 0.022 inches.
      <br/>
      The hole was formed to a depth of 0.025 inches.
      <br/>
      The narrower portion 31 of via 22 had a diameter of 0.014. The distance S1 and S2 were set at 0.013 inches and 0.0215, respectively.
      <br/>
      The impedance of the via was measured for signals having a rise time of 100 psec.
      <br/>
      The impedance was measured to be 45.3 ohms, which was within 10% of the target value of 50 ohms.
      <br/>
      By way of comparison, a separate via was manufactured on the board with a constant diameter and with the setback to the ground plane being uniform at 0.013 inches.
      <br/>
      This via had a measured impedance of 35 ohms.
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      The assembly 10 (FIGS. 1 and 2) includes an electrical connector assembly 30 having a pair of electrical connectors 32, 34.
      <br/>
      The electrical connector 34 has a plurality of signal contacts 38 connected to the conductive vias 22 of one of the boards, here the backplane printed circuit board 12.
      <br/>
      An electrical connector 32 has signal contacts 36 connected to the conductive via 22 of the other one of the boards, here the daughtercard printed circuit board 14.
      <br/>
      The signal contacts 36 of the electrical connector 32 are adapted for electrical connection to the contacts 38 of the electrical connector 34, in a conventional manner, as shown, to electrically interconnect the printed circuit boards 12, 14.
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      More particularly, and referring in more detail to FIGS. 3 and 4 to the printed circuit boards 12, 14, respectively, and considering an exemplary one of the conductive vias 22 in each one of such boards 12, 14, respectively, such conductive via 22 passes from the surface 24 of the dielectric 16 into an interior region 17 of the dielectric 16.
      <br/>
      The conductive via 22 is hollow having an upper surface portion 29 wider than the lower interior portion 31.
      <br/>
      The upper portion 29 has a width selected to receive a terminal pin 40 of the connector 32.
      <br/>
      Here, two types of such terminal pins 40 are shown.
      <br/>
      The terminal pin 40 for the via 22 in the backplane printed circuit board 12 (FIG. 3) is a resilient terminal pin having a hollow region 41 formed therein to enable such terminal pin 40 to compress somewhat as it forced into the wider surface portion 29 of the via 22.
      <br/>
      The terminal pin 40 for the via 22 in the backplane printed circuit board 12 (FIG. 4) is a pin 40 which is inserted into the wider surface portion 29 of the via 22 and then the wider surface portion 29 of the via 22 is filed with solder 43.
      <br/>
      The connection between the signal conductor 18 and the terminal pin 40 of each connector 32, 34 is called a signal launch.
    </p>
    <p num="20">
      As noted above, a plurality of reference potential layers 20 is disposed in the interior region 17 of the dielectric 16 parallel to the surface 24.
      <br/>
      The layers 20 have edges 48 terminating adjacent to the conductive via 22.
      <br/>
      The distance S1 between the edges 48 and the sides of the conductive via 22 are typically selected by the printed circuit board manufacture to be some minimum distance to provide a degree of tolerance which will prevent an inadvertent short circuit between the conductive via 22 and the reference potential layer 20.
      <br/>
      Thus, typically, the same minimum distance S1 is used along the entire interior 17 depth of the dielectric 16.
      <br/>
      For example, here the distance S1 is 0.013" inches.
      <br/>
      Here, however, the distance S2 between the edges 48 of the reference potential layers 30 and the sides of the conductive via 22 are selected, as noted above, to terminate the microstrip transmission line 25 formed by such conductive sheet 20, the conductor 18 and the portion of the dielectric 16 therebetween into a matched load, i.e., into a termination impedance matched to the impedance of such microstrip transmission line 25 thereby maximizing the efficiency of the transfer of the data on the signal conductor 18 to the conductive via 22.
      <br/>
      More particularly, it is noted that the plurality of reference potential layers 20 have edges 48 that terminate at different predetermined distances S1, S2 from the conductive via 22.
      <br/>
      More particularly, the edges 48 of the reference potential layers 20 adjacent the lower interior region 31 of the dielectric 16 are separated from the conductive via 22 a distance S2 that is greater than the minimum clearance distance S1 of the reference potential layers 20 adjacent the wider surface portion 29 of the conductive via 22.
      <br/>
      The distance S2 is selected to reduce the capacitance between the edges 48 of the reference potential layers 20 and the conductive via 22.
      <br/>
      However, S2 cannot be made arbitrarily large because of the loss of shielding between a pair of signal conductors 18 disposed on either side of such reference potential layer 20.
    </p>
    <p num="21">
      It is also noted that the vias 22 in both the backplane printed circuit board 12 and the daughtercard printed circuit board 14 are selected so that the microstrip transmission lines 25 in each of such boards 12, 14 are terminated in impedance matched to such microstrip transmission lines 25.
      <br/>
      Thus, with an electrical connector assembly constructed as a transmission line having an impedance matched to the impedance of the microstrip transmission lines 25 in each of the printed circuit boards 12, 14, data on the signal conductors 18 transfer between the printed circuit boards 12, 14 though the connector assembly 30 with maximum efficiency if the connector is designed with an impedance that closely matches the impedance of the signal traces in the printed circuit boards.
      <br/>
      Thus, the impedance from one of the boards through the electrical connector to the other one of the boards is substantially constant.
    </p>
    <p num="22">Thus, the wider, surface portion 29 of the hollow conductive via is selected to accommodate the terminal pin 40 while the narrower, interior portion 31 of the conductive via is selected for impedance matching termination of the microstrip transmission line 25.</p>
    <p num="23">
      A method for configuring the conductive vias 22 includes determining an impedance of the transmission lines 25 in the printed circuit boards 12, 14, for example with a conventional time domain reflectometer.
      <br/>
      As noted above, the transmission line 25 has a signal conductor 18 separated by a reference potential layer 20 by a portion of a dielectric 16.
      <br/>
      Then, the configuration of the conductive via 22 (i.e., the width of the width surface portion 29, the depth of the width surface portion 29 and the width of the narrower interior portion 31 are selected) along with the distance S2 between the edges 48 of the reference potential layer 20 and the conductive via to provide the transmission line with a termination impedance substantially matched to the impedance of the transmission line 25 considering any loss in shielding with such distance S2.
      <br/>
      A similar procedure is done for the other printed circuit boards.
    </p>
    <p num="24">
      Here, for example, the impedance provided by the vias is within 10% of the impedance of the printed circuit board having such via.
      <br/>
      The impedance through the connector is within 10% of the impedance of the via to which such connected is connected.
    </p>
    <p num="25">
      It will be appreciated that the numbers given herein are for illustration.
      <br/>
      The exact dimensions used for the setbacks between the ground planes and the vias will depend on several factors.
      <br/>
      The thickness of the board will influence the dimensions for S1 and S2.
      <br/>
      For thicker boards, greater setbacks will be required.
    </p>
    <p num="26">
      The invention will be particularly useful for thick boards.
      <br/>
      Boards with a thickness of less than 0.125 inches might provide impedances within 10% of the desired without having a reduced thickness section and without deviating from the standard setback from the ground planes.
      <br/>
      For boards greater than 0.200 inches thick, the invention will be particularly beneficial.
    </p>
    <p num="27">
      Also, the dimensions for S1 and S2 will depend on the frequency at which the board will be operated.
      <br/>
      Frequency is often expressed as the rise time of the fastest signals to be carried by the board.
      <br/>
      Boards operated at rise times slower than 300 psec might not require differential setbacks to achieve via impedances within 10%.
      <br/>
      However, the invention will be particularly useful for boards operated at rise times below 300 psec and particularly useful as rise times fall below 200 psec.
    </p>
    <p num="28">
      From the foregoing, it should be appreciated that the dimensions S1 and S2 will vary based on the thickness of the board and the operating speed.
      <br/>
      It is expected that a person designing a printed circuit board will select the dimensions for S1 and S2 based on several factors according to the following method: The diameter D2 typically will be dictated by the smallest hole the printed circuit board manufacturer can reliably make in a board.
      <br/>
      The dimension S1 will also typically be a standard parameter in the board manufacturing process.
    </p>
    <p num="29">The diameter D1 and the height H will be selected by the printed circuit board designer based on the type of connector to be inserted into the hole.</p>
    <p num="30">
      With these parameters established, an impedance computation can be performed at various values of S2 to determine the impedance of the overall signal launch.
      <br/>
      Impedance computations of this type are typically performed using commercial software package developed for impedance computations.
      <br/>
      The value of S2 yielding the desired impedance is then selected for manufacturing the board.
    </p>
    <p num="31">
      FIG. 5 illustrates one way that the method of manufacturing the printed circuit board could be facilitated.
      <br/>
      FIG. 5 represents a graph that a printed circuit board manufacturer might prepare for a surface hole having a specific depth and diameter.
      <br/>
      Every value of S2 will yield a signal launch with the desired impedance for certain combinations of board thickness and operating frequency.
      <br/>
      FIG. 5 illustrates that these values can be plotted for various values of S2, which are illustrated as Sa, Sb, Sc and Sd.
    </p>
    <p num="32">
      To use this graph, a person designing a printed circuit board would identify the board thickness and operating frequency.
      <br/>
      From this information the person would then find the closest value of S2.
      <br/>
      FIG. 5 illustrates a point representing a board thickness of B1 and a frequency of F1.
      <br/>
      This point is closest to the curve with a value of Sc.
      <br/>
      Thus, Sc would be selected as the dimension for S2.
      <br/>
      It should be appreciated that Sc would have an actual numeric value associated with it that is derived from an impedance computation.
    </p>
    <p num="33">
      The process of selecting S2 would be repeated for each hole size on each board.
      <br/>
      To use the graphical method of selecting values of S2, a different graph would be required for each hole size.
    </p>
    <p num="34">Other embodiments are within the spirit and scope of the appended claims.</p>
    <p num="35">
      For example, it is described that impedance control is achieved solely by varying the dimension S2.
      <br/>
      Impedance control could also be achieved by varying the dimension S1.
      <br/>
      However, increasing S1 will be less desirable because the amount of area on the circuit board useful for routing signal traces will be reduced.
      <br/>
      As a rule of thumb, signal traces should be routed no closer to the edge of an adjacent ground plane than twice the vertical spacing between the signal trace and the ground plane.
      <br/>
      However, where, in order to obtain a signal launch with the desired impedance, it would be necessary to make S2 so large that the ground planes adjacent via 22 were further from the center of the via 22 than the ground planes adjacent surface hole 29, it might be preferable to increase the dimension S1.
      <br/>
      In this circumstance, it might be preferable to set S1 and S2 to a level that places the ground planes adjacent via 22 and hole 29 at the same distance from the center of via 22.
    </p>
    <p num="36">
      Also, a graphical technique is described by which a printed circuit board manufacturer could provided a designer with the information needed to design a printed circuit board.
      <br/>
      It will be appreciated that the same information and assistance could be provided as a computer program.
      <br/>
      The computer program would accept as input the board thickness and operating frequency.
      <br/>
      Board thickness might be specified as inches, millimeters, the number of layers in the board or in any other convenient units.
      <br/>
      The computer program would also require as an input an indication of the dimensions of the upper surface hole.
      <br/>
      This data might be specified in units of length or could be specified in terms of the type of device to be attached to the hole.
    </p>
    <p num="37">
      Such a computer program could then compute the required dimension for S2 and, if desired, S1.
      <br/>
      The computer program could operate by essentially performing the operations illustrated in conjunction with FIG. 5.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, the computer program could be programmed to solve the required dimensions using mathematical techniques.
