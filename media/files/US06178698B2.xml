      An improved door closing apparatus (20) is adapted for use with a door frame (21) that comprises an elongated header (22), a sill (23) and a pair of side jambs (24, 25).
      <br/>
      A door (26) is adapted to be mounted on the frame for pivotal movement about an axis (y-y).
      <br/>
      The improved comprises a base (29) adapted to be mounted on the header, a closer mechanism (30) mounted on the base and having a first shaft (31) adapted to be oriented perpendicularly with respect to the axis of elongation of the header.
      <br/>
      The closer mechanism is operatively arranged to selectively urge the first shaft to rotate relative to the closer mechanism.
      <br/>
      A second shaft (33) is mounted on the base for pivotal movement relative thereto.
      <br/>
      The second shaft is substantially aligned with the pivotal excess of the door.
      <br/>
      First and second arms (34, 35) are mounted on the first and second shafts, respectively, for movement therewith.
      <br/>
      A link (36) pivotally connects the first and second arms that respective locations eccentric to the axes of the first and second shafts.
      <br/>
      Hence, a force transmitted by the closing mechanism may be transmitted through the first shaft, the first arm, the link, the second arm and the second shaft to urge the door to pivot in one direction about its axis.

    <heading>TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
    <p num="1">The present invention relates generally to door closers, and, more particularly, to an improved door closing apparatus for a balanced door.</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND ART</heading>
    <p num="2">
      A balanced door is generally considered to be a door in which the axis of rotation is relatively close to the center of its area.
      <br/>
      Hence, the door may be operated with less effort then a conventional door, which is hinged at one side.
      <br/>
      The present invention relates generally to an improved balanced door closing apparatus.
      <br/>
      However, the inventive improvement is not limited to this one particular end use.
    </p>
    <p num="3">
      In generally, a door has a header, a pair of transversely-spaced jambs, and a base.
      <br/>
      These elements define the door opening.
      <br/>
      The door is operatively arranged within this opening.
      <br/>
      As indicated above, a balanced door is hinged or pivoted about an intermediate portion of its width, as opposed to being hinged at one end.
    </p>
    <p num="4">Various details of prior art balanced doors and door closing apparatuses are shown and described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,309,676, 3,605,339 and 4,286,411.</p>
    <p num="5">Accordingly, it would generally desirable to provide an improved door closer apparatus that is compact, may readily be reversed for either a left-handed door or a right-handed door, and which may be readily mounted on the header.</p>

    <p num="12">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT(S)</p>
    <p num="13">
      At the outset, it should be clearly understood that like reference numerals are intended to identify the same structural elements, portions or surfaces, consistently throughout the several drawing figures, as such elements, portions or surfaces may be further described or explained by the entire written specification, of which this detailed description is an integral part.
      <br/>
      Unless otherwise indicated, the drawings are intended to be read (e.g., cross-hatching, arrangement of parts, proportion, degree, etc.) together with the specification, and are to be considered a portion of the entire written description of this invention.
      <br/>
      As used in the following description, the terms "horizontal", "vertical", "left", "right", "up"and "down", as well as adjectival and adverbial derivatives thereof (e.g., "horizontally", "rightwardly", "upwardly", etc.), simply refer to the orientation of the illustrated structure as the particular drawing figure faces the reader.
      <br/>
      Similarly, the terms "inwardly" and "outwardly" generally refer to the orientation of a surface relative to its axis of elongation, or axis of rotation, as appropriate.
    </p>
    <p num="14">
      Referring to the drawings, and, more particularly, to FIG. 1 thereof, the present invention broadly provides an improved door closing apparatus, generally indicated at 20, for use with a door frame, portions of which are fragmentarily illustrated in FIG. 1 at 21. That frame includes an elongated header 22, a sill 23, a pair of horizontally-spaced side jambs 24, 25 that are operatively ranged to define a door opening at 26.
      <br/>
      A door, portions of which are indicated at 28, is adapted to be mounted on the frame for pivotal movement about an axis y--y.
      <br/>
      In the preferred embodiment, the door is an intermediately-mounted balanced door.
      <br/>
      However, while this arrangement is presently preferred, the invention is not limited to use with such intermediately-pivoted balanced doors, but can, alternatively, be used with conventional edge-mounted doors as well.
    </p>
    <p num="15">
      Referring now collectively to FIGS. 1-6, the improved door closing apparatus 20 is shown as broadly including a horizontally-elongated rectangular plate-like base 29 which is adapted to be mounted on the header 22.
      <br/>
      A closer mechanism, generally indicated at 30, is operatively mounted on the base.
      <br/>
      This closer mechanism is individually "old." It basically includes a body having a spring-biased actuator therein.
      <br/>
      The closer mechanism has a first shaft 31 that is normally arranged to be oriented perpendicularly (i.e., horizontally) with respect to the header.
      <br/>
      The closer mechanism is operatively arranged to selectively urge this first shaft to rotate in one angular direction relative to the body of the closer mechanism.
      <br/>
      A second shaft, indicated at 33, is mounted on the base for pivotal movement relative thereto.
      <br/>
      This second shaft is substantially aligned with the pivotal axis y--y of the door.
      <br/>
      Thus, whereas the first shaft is normally horizontal, the second shaft is normally vertical.
      <br/>
      A first arm 34 is operatively mounted on the first shaft for rotation therewith.
      <br/>
      A second arm 35 is operatively mounted on the second shaft for rotation therewith.
      <br/>
      A link 36 is pivotally connected to the first and second arms at locations eccentric to the respective axes of the first and second shafts.
      <br/>
      Hence, a force transmitted by the closing mechanism may be transmitted through the first shaft, first arm, link, second arm and second shaft to urge the door to pivot in one direction relative to its axis.
    </p>
    <p num="16">
      In the preferred embodiment, the improved apparatus further includes adjustment means, generally indicated at 38, for adjusting the length of this link.
      <br/>
      This adjustment means may include at least one threaded connection, such as a turnbuckle.
    </p>
    <p num="17">
      One unique feature of this particular closer mechanism lies in the fact that the first shaft extends laterally outwardly from either side, as shown in FIG. 5.
      <br/>
      Hence, the first arm may be operatively mounted on either end of the first shaft, depending on whether the door is intended for left-hand or right-hand operation.
    </p>
    <p num="18">Modifications</p>
    <p num="19">
      The present invention contemplates that many changes and modifications may be made.
      <br/>
      For example, while the basis shown as being a horizontally-elongated rectangular plate-like member, the base could have other shapes or forms as well.
      <br/>
      Similarly, the closer mechanism may be a commercially-available off-the-shelf item, or may be of some special design.
      <br/>
      Whether the closer mechanism has the exposed marginal ends of the first shaft extending outwardly from either side, it is entirely optional.
      <br/>
      The first and second arms are described functionally.
      <br/>
      Hence, they may have various shapes and configurations.
      <br/>
      Similarly, the link is not limited to the precise form shown, but may have other shapes and configurations as well.
    </p>
    <p num="20">Therefore, while the presently preferred form of the improved door closing apparatus as been shown and described, and several modifications thereof discussed, persons skilled in this art will readily appreciate that various additional changes and modifications may be made without departing from the spirit of the invention, as defined and differentiated by the following claims.</p>
