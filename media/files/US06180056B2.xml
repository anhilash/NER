    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="1">
      The present invention relates to certain compositions and processes useful for minimizing biological and colloidal fouling.
      <br/>
      The present invention further relates to compositions and methods for minimizing biological and colloidal fouling in aqueous systems that use separation membranes.
      <br/>
      General embodiments of such aqueous systems, include but are not limited to, nanofiltration, ultrafiltration, microfiltration and particularly reverse osmosis processes.
      <br/>
      The compositions of the present invention preferably show unexpected efficacy in minimizing biological and colloidal fouling.
    </p>
    <p num="2">
      Reverse osmosis (RO) is a process commonly used in commercial, industrial, and home liquid purification systems.
      <br/>
      RO processes purify liquids that contain undissolved and dissolved impurities.
      <br/>
      The liquid to be purified is passed over a RO membrane.
      <br/>
      The "permeate" passes through the reverse osmosis membrane and is collected as purified liquid, while the remaining liquid, or "concentrate" is discarded or further processed.
      <br/>
      The successful practice of a RO process is inhibited by accumulating colloidal dispersions and biofouling.
    </p>
    <p num="3">
      Biofouling can be considered as one of the last major unresolved problems affecting RO processes.
      <br/>
      This is because the most common RO membrane type in use today cannot tolerate chlorine or other oxidizing biocides.
      <br/>
      For this reason, chlorine must generally be removed from the feedstreams to these systems.
      <br/>
      However, without the presence of a chlorine residual, microorganisms quickly colonize and biofoul membrane surfaces.
      <br/>
      The approach of the industry thus far has been either to ignore the problem and accept high operating costs due to biofouling, or to add non-oxidizing biocides to these plants.
      <br/>
      It has been estimated that the cost of biofouling may total as high as $0.25 per 1000 gallons of RO permeate produced.
      <br/>
      This high cost makes biofouling control by non-oxidizing biocides economically attractive.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      However, there are a significant number of drawbacks to many of the non-oxidizing biocides currently available.
      <br/>
      Specifically, non-oxidizing biocides are known to be highly toxic, incompatible with RO membranes, produce unwanted side reactions with other treatment chemicals or feedwater constituents, and/or adversely affect downstream processes where excess biocides passes through RO membranes.
    </p>
    <p num="5">Accordingly, there is a need in the art for a biocidal composition that overcomes these and other problems.</p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="6">It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a novel method and composition for minimizing biological and colloidal fouling, preferably without one or more of the drawbacks discussed above.</p>
    <p num="7">
      Additional features and advantages of the invention will be set forth in the description, which follows, and in part will be apparent from the description, or may be learned by practice of the present invention.
      <br/>
      The advantages of the present invention will be realized and obtained by the method and composition of matter, particularly, pointed out in the written description and claims thereof.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      To achieve these and other advantages and in accordance with the purpose of the invention, as embodied and broadly described, the present invention relates to a composition which includes at least one anionic antiscalant and at least one cationically-charged biocide.
      <br/>
      The anionic antiscalant and cationically-charged biocide are present in any amount effective to control or minimize colloidal and/or biological fouling.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      The present invention also relates to a method to control colloidal and/or biological fouling in an aqueous system involving the use of a separation membrane system.
      <br/>
      The method involves the introduction of a formulation containing at least one anionic antiscalant and at least one cationic biocide to an aqueous system upstream of the separation membrane, in an effective amount to control or reduce the colloidal and/or biological fouling in the aqueous solution.

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="12">The present invention is directed to the use of a composition or formulation for minimizing or controlling biological and/or colloidal fouling comprising at least one antiscalant and at least one cationically-charged biocide.</p>
    <p num="13">
      The compositions or formulations of the present invention are advantageously used in aqueous systems involving the use of at least one separation membrane such as a reverse osmosis membrane.
      <br/>
      The compositions or formulations of the present invention are introduced at a point upstream from the location of the separation membrane used in the aqueous system.
      <br/>
      Preferably, the aqueous system involving the use of a separation membrane also uses at least one pre-filter located upstream from the separation membrane.
      <br/>
      The compositions or formulations of the present invention can be introduced upstream from the pre-filter if one is present or introduced at any location between the pre-filter and the separation membrane.
      <br/>
      The compositions or formulations of the present invention can be introduced as a single prepared formulation or the components of the formulation can be added separately into the aqueous system as long as the components are introduced upstream from the separation membrane.
      <br/>
      The use of the compositions and formulations of the present invention at such a separation system for aqueous solutions, such as water is advantageous since the formulations of the present invention have the ability to control fouling, such as biological and/or colloidal fouling which exists in separation systems without substantially hindering and/or having detrimental effects on the separation membrane which include membrane fouling.
      <br/>
      Such detrimental effects include, but are not limited to, loss in permeate flow and salt rejection.
    </p>
    <p num="14">
      The use of the compositions of the present invention are viable and advantageous because they are formulated using cationically-charged biocides, which are unexpectedly compatible with separation membrane systems, such as RO membranes, especially polyamide RO membranes and membranes with related chemistries, including, but not limited to, membranes used in nanofiltriation, ultrafiltration, microfiltration, and the like.
      <br/>
      Previously, cationically-charged surfactants were considered to be incompatible with separation membranes because the cationically-charged surfactants reacted with the membranes, and thus could lead to membrane fouling.
      <br/>
      However, the present invention makes use of a class of cationically-charged biocides suitable for use with separation membranes, including RO membranes, and preferably avoids or controls membrane fouling.

      <br/>
      While any effective amount of the anionic antiscalant and the cationically-charged biocide can be used, preferably, the anionic antiscalant and cationically-charged biocide are present at a weight ratio of from about 0.1:1 to about 5:1, more preferably from about 0.5:1 to about 3:1, and most preferably from about 0.7:1 to about 1.3:1. One skilled in the art in view of this disclosure can routinely determine the optimal amounts of the anionic antiscalant and cationically-charged biocide for a particular application.

    <p num="17">
      With respect to the biocide, the biocide is preferably a cationically-charged biocide.
      <br/>
      Preferably, the cationically-charged biocide has no hydrophobic moieties, for example, no alkyl groups having C8 or more, such as C10 -C18 alkyl groups, or no aromatic groups.
      <br/>
      Specific examples of biocides include, but are not limited to, tetrakishydroxymethylphosphonium sulfate (THPS), poly(oxyethlylene(dimethyliminio)ethylene(dimethyliminio)ethylene dichloride) (WSCP), or any combinations thereof THPS is commercially available from Albright and Wilson.
      <br/>
      WSCP is commercially available from Buckman Laboratories International, Inc.
      <br/>
      These cationically-charged biocides are also preferred in liquid purification systems because they have low toxicity levels.

      The biocides are present in amounts such as to minimize, control, or prevent the presence or growth of microorganisms, especially bacteria.
      <br/>
      Preferably, the amount of the biocide is from about 5% to about 50%, more preferably from about 10% to about 40%, and most preferably from about 15% to about 36%, based on the total weight of the anionic antiscalant and cationically-charged biocide present, (i.e., on an active basis).

      <br/>
      Generally, fouling occurs when the operational efficiency of an aqueous system is reduced, as a result of the gradual accumulation of colloidal solids and/or biological growth in pipes or on process components.

      Specific examples of aqueous systems include, but are not limited to, aqueous systems which are susceptible to bacteria and/or fungal deterioration and/or degradation unless steps are taken to inhibit such degradation and deterioration.
      <br/>
      Specific examples include aqueous systems used in the making of paper and paper containing products, metal finishing, power, electronics, chemical, petroleum, mining, biological and industrial waters, metal working fluids, cooling tower water, drinking water systems, and other industrial water systems which are used in the process and preparation of products and material.

      Generally, each component of the composition of the present invention can be added separately to an aqueous system or may be combined first and then introduced into the water system.
      <br/>
      Preferably, a formulation of the various components comprising the present invention are first prepared and then added as a single formulation into the aqueous system.
      <br/>
      Generally, in making the formulation of the present invention, the above-described ingredients can be simply mixed together to form the formulation.
      <br/>
      The formulation can then be dispersed into the aqueous system in any manner used to disperse liquid or solid components.
      <br/>
      In some cases, it may be necessary to neutralize the acidity of the antiscalant to prevent degradation of the biocide.
      <br/>
      For example, in the case of THPS-containing formulations, caustic soda or other similar agent should be added to the THPS and be completely dissolved in the antiscalant solution to raise the pH to 7 prior to the addition of the THPS.
      <br/>
      Likewise, it may be necessary to lower the pH of some other biocides to prevent the precipitation of antiscalant:biocide ion pairs from the formulation.
      <br/>
      Preferably, the composition whether in a single formulation or as separate components is dispersed into the aqueous system in order to more effectively control or inhibit the growth of the microorganisms and to prevent and/or control scaling.

      In a preferred embodiment, the present invention is used in the aqueous systems used for producing high-purity or portable water in which the absence of biocide in the permeate water is a necessity.

      Aqueous systems include those systems used in the making of paper and paper containing products, metalworking fluids, power, electronics, chemical, petroleum, mining, biological and industrial waste waters, cooling tower water, and drinking water systems.

      It is further understood by "controlling," (i.e., preventing or minimizing or reducing) the growth of at least one type of microorganism, the growth of at least one microorganism is inhibited.

      In other words, there is no growth or essentially no growth of at least one microorganism. "Controlling" the growth of at least one microorganism can also maintain the microorganism population at a desired level, reduce the population to a desired level (even to undetectable limits, e.g., 0 population), and/or inhibit the growth of at least one microorganism.
      <br/>
      Thus, the systems in which the compositions of the present invention are used can also preserve from attack and the resulting spoilage and other detrimental effects caused by microorganisms.

      During the last THPS test series, a cell test apparatus was plumbed to the concentrate pressure of the RO system.
      <br/>
      Performance data were collected from the test cell and normalized.
      <br/>
      Following the test, the membrane sample was removed for microbiological examination.
      <br/>
      Normalized performance data are plotted in FIG. 15. Following the test run, no significant biofouling was seen on the surface of the membrane based upon a Gram staining material swabbed from the membrane surface.
    </p>
    <p num="52">
      Cell test and the RO test showed that both THPS and WSCP are compatible with polyamide RO membranes.
      <br/>
      This was an unexpected result based on the known incompatibility of cationic surfactants with polyamide membranes.
      <br/>
      A typical polyamide membrane response to a cationic surfactant is shown in FIG. 16. The breaks in the curves at the point of addition for this cationic biocide indicate immediate decreases in the A and B values for this membrane, which would be indicative of fouling.
      <br/>
      These breaks are not seen in the curves for WSCP and THPS, both of which are also cationic biocides.
      <br/>
      Initial tests as shown in FIG. 10 of the WSCP product indicated that this compound might cause membrane fouling.
      <br/>
      However, when WSCP addition was stopped, membrane fouling continued at the same rate.
      <br/>
      When WSCP addition was resumed at a higher dosage, the fouling rate did not change.
    </p>
    <p num="53">
      A final THPS test was conducted.
      <br/>
      When normalized permeate flow from this test was superimposed on the WSCP, fouling rates for both test were seen to be identical.
      <br/>
      This evidences that the feedwater changed during the WSCP tests, resulting in fouling of the pilot system.
    </p>
    <p num="54">
      Unexpectantly, the THPS, and to a lesser extent WSCP, actually reduced the amount of TOC passage through the membranes.
      <br/>
      Thus, the biocide passage through the polyamide membrane was virtually nil.
      <br/>
      Based upon bacteria counts, both WSCP and THPS appeared to control bacterial growth within the pilot RO system.
      <br/>
      At 75% recovery, salts and bacteria were concentrated about four times within the RO system.
      <br/>
      With the addition of both THPS and WSCP, viable bacteria counts of the concentrate stream were seen to always be less than four times the feed counts.
      <br/>
      Also, the slipstream cell test membrane showed no biofouling when analyzed after the THPS test.
      <br/>
      A further indication of biocide efficacy was observed during the WSCP test.
      <br/>
      Specifically, when the addition of WSCP was stopped, concentrate bacteria counts increased significantly.
      <br/>
      Upon resumption of WSCP feed, bacteria counts fell.
    </p>
    <p num="55">
      Furthermore, the test showed that HEDP and DETPMP may be mixed in all proportions with WSCP and THPS without precipitation.
      <br/>
      Therefore, a single product that combines both antiscalant and biocidal functionalities can be produced.
      <br/>
      The CFI test indicated that a blend of phosphonates and THPS will reduce colloidal fouling more effectively than will phosphonate alone.
      <br/>
      Larger colloidal particles tend to be more effectively swept through element feed passages than smaller particles.
      <br/>
      For this reason, the presence of a cationic substance in the phosphonate formulation may lower the rate of colloidal fouling by flocculation of colloidal particles contained in the RO feedstream.
