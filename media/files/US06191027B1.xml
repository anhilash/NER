      A method of fabricating a semiconductor device include the steps of: providing a substrate having an insulating layer thereon; forming a connection hole including a first sub-hole and a second sub-hole mutually connected in the insulating layer, wherein the first sub-hole has a first diameter and the second sub-hole has a second diameter larger than the first diameter; forming a first conductive layer over the substrate; removing the first conductive to a thickness so as to form a side wall spacer film on a side wall of the second sub-hole and a plug film in the first sub-hole; forming a barrier metal layer over the substrate to cover the side wall spacer and the plug film; forming a second conductive layer over the substrate to fill space in the connection hole; and chemical mechanical polishing the second conductive layer.

    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="3">a) Field of the Invention</p>
    <p num="4">The present invention relates to a method of forming a flat wiring layer with a damascene method, and more particularly to a flat wiring layer forming method capable of forming a low resistance and high reliability flat wiring layer by depositing a conductive layer inlaid in connection holes and interconnect grooves formed in an insulating film and thereafter planarizing the conductive layer.</p>
    <p num="5">b) Description of the Related Art</p>
    <p num="6">
      A flat wiring layer forming method with a damascene method is already known, for example, as illustrated in FIGS. 28 to 30 (e.g., refer to "DUAL DAMASCENE: A ULSI WIRING TECHNOLOGY", Carter W. Kaanta et al.
      <br/>
      Jun. 11-12, 1991 VMIC Conference).
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      At the process shown in FIG. 28, after wirings 2A and 2B are embedded in a surface layer of an insulating film 1, the surface of the insulating film 1 is planarized by CMP (chemical mechanical polishing).
      <br/>
      Another insulating film 3 is formed on the planarized surface of the insulating film 1.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      A resist pattern 4 having holes 4a and 4b corresponding to connection portions to the wirings 2A and 2B is formed on the insulating film 3.
      <br/>
      Another resist pattern 5 is formed on the resist pattern 4, the resist pattern 5 having an interconnect hole coupling the holes 4a and 4b of the resist pattern 4.

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
    <p num="20">
      Using conductive material having a low resistivity is expected to be effective in reducing the resistance of a damascene wiring layer.
      <br/>
      However, there is some tradeoff between using material having a low resistivity and using material suitable for forming a conductive plug in a connection hole formed in an insulating film.
      <br/>
      In this connection, the inventor proposes to use different materials for a plug filled in a connection hole formed in an insulating film and for a damascene wiring layer laterally extending between plugs.
    </p>
    <p num="21">The inventor has studied a wiring layer forming method combined with connection hole embedding techniques and damascene methods, as illustrated in FIGS. 31 to 41.</p>
    <p num="22">
      In the process shown in FIG. 31, after a field oxide film 12 having an element hole 12a is formed on the surface of a semiconductor substrate 10 by known local oxidation of silicon (LOCOS), a MOS transistor T is formed in the surface area in the element hole by known methods.
      <br/>
      For example, the transistor T has a gate insulating film F, a gate electrode G, side spacers H1 and H2, source and drain regions S1 and D1 having a relatively low impurity concentration, and source and drain regions S and D having a relatively high impurity concentration.
    </p>
    <p num="23">By using the same processes of forming the gate electrode G, a wiring K is formed on the insulating film 12, and by using the same processes of forming the side spacers H1 and H2, side spacers L1 and L2 are formed on the side walls of the wiring K. An insulating film 14 made of silicon oxide or the like is deposited on the substrate by CVD, covering the insulating film 12, transistor T, and wiring K.</p>
    <p num="24">
      In the process shown in FIG. 32, the insulating film 14 is abraded or lapped by CMP to planarize the surface thereof.
      <br/>
      In the process shown in FIG. 33, a resist pattern 16 is formed by known photolithography, the resist pattern 16 having holes 16s, 16d and 16k corresponding to the connection areas of the source region S, drain region D and wiring K.
    </p>
    <p num="25">
      In the process shown in FIG. 34, by using the resist pattern 16 as a mask, the insulating film 14 is anisotropically etched to form connection holes 14s, 14d and 14k which reach the source region S, drain region D and wiring K, respectively.
      <br/>
      Thereafter, the resist pattern 16 is removed.
    </p>
    <p num="26">
      In the process shown in FIG. 35, an adhesion layer 18 such as TiN/Ti (Ti is a lower layer) is sputtered on the inner surfaces of the connection holes 14s, 14d and 14k and on the surface of the insulating film 14, in order to ensure good adhesion to a W layer.
      <br/>
      A W layer 20 is formed by CVD on the adhesion layer 18, filling the insides of the connection holes 14s, 14d and 14k.
    </p>
    <p num="27">
      In the process shown in FIG. 36, a lamination of the adhesion layer 18 and W layer 20 is partially removed and planarized to leave first, second and third portions 18s, 18d and 18k of the adhesion layer 18 and first, second and third portions 20s, 20d and 20k of the W layer 20, respectively in the connection holes 14s, 14d and 14k.
      <br/>
      The portions 18s and 20s form a plug Ps, the portions 18d and 20d form a plug Pd, and the portions 18k and 20k form a plug Pk.
      <br/>
      The space (void or seam) formed in the W layer 20 expands by this CMP process.
    </p>
    <p num="28">In the process shown in FIG. 37, an insulating film 22 such as Si oxide is formed by CVD on the substrate, covering the insulating film 14 and plugs Ps, Pd and Pk.</p>
    <p num="29">
      In the process shown in FIG. 38, a resist pattern 24 is formed by photolithograpy, the resist pattern 24 having a hole 24s corresponding to an interconnect groove for the plug Ps and a hole 24d corresponding to an interconnect groove for the plugs Pd and Pk.
      <br/>
      The interconnect groove is used for inlaying a damascene interconnect and has a shape conformal to the shape of an interconnect which interconnects two or more connection holes and to the shape of an interconnect which extends the wiring in the connection hole to another contact position.
    </p>
    <p num="30">
      In the process shown in FIG. 39, by using the resist pattern 24 as a mask, the insulating film 22 is anisotropically etched to form interconnect grooves 22s and 22d in the insulating film 22.
      <br/>
      The interconnect groove 22s is used for the interconnect to the plug Ps, and the interconnect groove 22d is used for the local interconnect between the plugs Pd and Pk.
      <br/>
      Thereafter, the resist pattern 24 is removed.
    </p>
    <p num="31">
      In the process shown in FIG. 40, a barrier layer 26 such as TiN/Ti (Ti is a lower layer) is formed through sputtering on the inner surfaces of the interconnect grooves 22s and 22d and on the insulating film 22.
      <br/>
      A wiring layer 28 such as Al alloy is sputtered on the barrier layer 26, being inlaid in the interconnect grooves 22s and 22d.
      <br/>
      The barrier layer 26 is used in order to prevent Al or the like in the wiring layer 28 from diffusing into the W plugs and Si substrate.
    </p>
    <p num="32">
      In the process shown in FIG. 41, a lamination of the barrier layer 26 and wiring layer 28 is partially removed from the upper surface thereof and planarized, to leave a first portion 26s of the layer 26 and a first portion 28s of the layer 28 in the interconnect groove 22s and to leave a second portion 26d of the layer 26 and a second portion 28d of the layer 28 in the interconnect groove 22d.
      <br/>
      The plug Ps and portions 26s and 28s form an interconnect 30S connected to the source region S. The plug Pd, portions 26d and 28d and plug Pk form an interconnect 30D locally interconnecting the drain region D and wiring K.
    </p>
    <p num="33">
      With the wiring layer forming method described with reference to FIGS. 31 to 41, the interconnects 30S and 30D excepting the plugs are made of wiring material such as Al alloy.
      <br/>
      It is therefore easy to reduce the total wiring resistance.
      <br/>
      However, it has been found that there is a problem of degraded reliability of interconnects, as will be described hereinunder.
    </p>
    <p num="34">
      In the W layer deposition process shown in FIG. 35, as the process of depositing W on the inner surfaces of the connection holes 14s, 14d and 14k proceeds, a supply of source gas (WF6) to the insides of the connection holes is limited more so that the W deposition speed in the inside of the connection holes lowers more than the outside thereof.
      <br/>
      When the upper wall of the W layer 20 covering the inside of each connection hole is closed, the source gas cannot be supplied to the inside of the connection hole and the W deposition stops.
      <br/>
      A space (seam or void) Q is therefore formed inside each connection hole.
    </p>
    <p num="35">
      In the CMP process shown in FIG. 36, abrasive particles of alumina (Al2 O3) added with oxidant H2 O2 is used as an abrading agent.
      <br/>
      More specifically, the abrading mechanism is the oxidizing of the surface of the W layer 20 by the oxidant to form a fragile oxide which is removed by mechanical abrasion with alumina abrasive particles.
      <br/>
      As the abrading proceeds, the oxidant enters the seam or void Q and the upper opening of the space Q is enlarged as shown in FIG. 36. Since alumina abrasive particles also enter the seam or void Q, it is very difficult in practice to remove the alumina abrasive particles in the seam or void Q through brushing or chemical washing after the CMP process.
    </p>
    <p num="36">Even if the upper opening of the seam or void Q is enlarged, the inner diameter of the seam or void Q is very small so that it is hard to completely fill the inside of the seam or void Q during the insulating film deposition process shown in FIG. 37 or during the process of depositing the barrier layer and wiring material layer shown in FIG. 40. The seam or void Q is therefore left even after the interconnects 30S and 30D are formed, as shown in FIG. 41. If the wiring metal is exposed to such a seam or void Q, the void may be grown or scattered in the wiring metal because of electromigration or the like and the reliability of interconnects is lowered.</p>
    <p num="37">
      In the process of etching the insulating film shown in FIG. 39, it is desired to stop etching when the plugs Ps, Pd and Pk are exposed at the bottoms of the interconnect grooves 22s and 22d.
      <br/>
      However, it is not easy to detect the end point of the etching.
      <br/>
      Moreover, since the etching rate is not uniform over the whole surface of a wafer, over-etch of about 50 to 100 nm is performed to ensure that all the plugs are exposed.
      <br/>
      As a result, the insulating film 14 is etched deeper than the peak level of the plugs Ps, Pd and Pk, and the plugs are protruded higher than the bottoms of the interconnect grooves.
    </p>
    <p num="38">
      If the barrier layer 26 is formed at the process shown in FIG. 40 after the process shown in FIG. 39 by which the upper wall of the seam or void Q is enlarged and the plugs Ps, Pd and Pk are protruded higher than the bottoms of the interconnect grooves, then the coverage of the barrier layer 26 is degraded at the opening of the seam or void Q and near at the plugs.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, since the bottom of each of the interconnect grooves 22s and 22d is generally vertical to the side wall thereof as shown in FIG. 39, the coverage of the barrier layer 26 at the process shown in FIG. 40 is also degraded at these right angle corners.
    </p>
    <p num="39">
      If the coverage of the barrier layer 26 is degraded at the opening of the seam or void Q, this seam or void Q is exposed to the wiring metal of Al alloy or the like so that the reliability of interconnects is lowered from the same reason described previously.
      <br/>
      The lowered coverage of the barrier layer 26 degrades the barrier performance and hence the reliability of interconnects.
      <br/>
      For example, if Cu is used as the wiring metal, Cu may be diffused into the insulating films 14 and 22 from the regions where the barrier performance of the barrier layer 26 is lowered, or oxygen in the insulating films 14 and 22 may oxidize Cu.
      <br/>
      The reliability of interconnects is therefore degraded.
    </p>
    <p num="40">
      In order to alleviate the problems accompanied by the CMP process, such as fine abrasive particles left in the seam or void Q, the CMP process shown in FIG. 36 may be replaced by an etch-back process which etches back the W layer 20 to leave the planarized W layer.
      <br/>
      In this case, the etch-back process is performed by two steps including main etching and over-etching both under anisotropic etching conditions, because of a difficulty in forming plugs Ps, Pd and Pk if both etching processes are performed under isotropic etching conditions.
    </p>
    <p num="41">
      If the etch-back process is performed in the process shown in FIG. 36, a portion of the W layer 20 may be left unetched during the main etching even if the surface of the insulting film 14 is made flat at the process shown in FIG. 32, because of an irregular etching rate over the whole surface of a wafer.
      <br/>
      Such an unetched W layer 20 may cause an electrical short-circuit between interconnects.
      <br/>
      Therefore, in order to perfectly remove the W layer 20, the over-etching is performed following the main etching.
    </p>
    <p num="42">
      FIG. 42 illustratively shows the connection hole 14s after over-etching.
      <br/>
      As shown, the W layer 20s constituting the plug Ps is excessively etched and a recess having a depth Rd is formed on the upper portion of the plug Ps.
      <br/>
      The opening of the seam or void Q is enlarged more.
    </p>
    <p num="43">Under the conditions that the recess is formed on the upper portion of the plug and the opening of the seam or void Q is enlarged, if the barrier layer 26 is sputtered at the process shown in FIG. 40, the coverage of the barrier layer 26 is degraded at the opening of the seam or void Q and at the step of the recess.</p>
    <p num="44">
      The lowered coverage of the barrier layer 26 at the opening of the seam or void Q may cause the seam or void Q to be exposed to the wiring metal such as Al alloy so that the reliability of interconnections is lowered from the same reason described previously.
      <br/>
      The lowered coverage of the barrier layer 26 may also degrade the barrier performance and the reliability of interconnections is lowered from the above-described reason.
    </p>
    <p num="45">
      FIGS. 1 to 11 illustrate a flat wiring layer forming method according to the first embodiment of the invention.
      <br/>
      The processes (1) to (11) of this method will be described sequentially with reference to corresponding FIGS. 1 to 11.
    </p>
    <p num="46">
      (1) On the surface of a semiconductor substrate 40 made of, for example, Si (silicon), a field insulating film 42 made of Si oxide and having an element hole 42a is formed by known local oxidation of silicon (LOCOS).
      <br/>
      After a gate insulating film F is formed through thermal oxidation on the semiconductor surface in the element hole 42a of the insulating film 42, a polysilicon layer or polycide layer (lamination of a lower polysilicon layer and an upper silicide layer formed thereon) is deposited and patterned to form a gate electrode G. If desired, the gate insulating film F may be patterned to the same shape as the gate electrode G.
    </p>
    <p num="47">
      Next, by using a lamination of the insulating film F and electrode G and the insulating film 42 as a mask, a selective impurity doping process (e.g., ion implantation) is performed to form a source region S1 and a drain region D1 having a relatively lower concentration of impurities having the opposite conductivity type to the substrate.
      <br/>
      An insulating film of Si oxide or the like is deposited on the substrate, and an etch-back process is performed to form side spacers H1 and H2 on both sides of the gate electrode G.
    </p>
    <p num="48">
      Thereafter, by using a gate portion GP including the insulating film F, electrode G, side spacers H1 and H2 and the insulating film 42 as a mask, a selective impurity doping process (e.g., ion implantation) is performed to form a source region S and a drain region D having a relatively higher concentration of impurities having the conductivity type opposite to the substrate.
      <br/>
      With these processes, a source/drain region of a lightly doped drain (LDD) structure is formed.
    </p>
    <p num="49">
      (2) An interlayer insulating film 44 is formed 0.8 to 1.5  MU m in thickness by sequentially depositing PSG (phosphosilicate glass) and BPSG (borophhosphosilicate glass), the film 44 covering the MOS transistor in the element hole 42a and the insulating film 42.
      <br/>
      In order to ensure wafer abrasion uniformity and controllability of a CMP process shown in FIG. 3 to be described later, in place of the BPSG film having a low abrading rate, a plasma Si oxide film having a low abrading rate may be formed which is an Si oxide film formed by plasma CVD or an Si oxide film formed by plasma CVD using TEOS (tetraethylorthosilicate).
    </p>
    <p num="50">(3) Since the surface of the insulating film 44 is irregular, reflecting the steps of the underlying layers such as the gate portion GP and insulating film 42, the surface of the insulating film 44 is planarized by CMP.</p>
    <p num="51">
      Materials used for this CMP process are, for example, abrasive liquid formed by suspending abrasive particles of fused silica (SiO2 : primary particles) having a diameter of 30 nm in alkalescent liquid containing potassium hydroxide (KOH), ammonium hydroxide (NH4 OH) or the like, and polyurethane based abrading or lapping cloth having micro holes in the surface layer thereof.
      <br/>
      The abrading conditions may be:
    </p>
    <p num="52">
      Abrasion load: 60-90 kg/wafer (about 350 g/cm2 -500 g/cm2);
      <br/>
      Platen rotation speed: 30 rpm (common to both (a) and (b));
      <br/>
      Head rotation speed: 40 rpm (common to both (a) and (b));
      <br/>
      Abrading rate: 150 nm/min (common to both (a) and (b));
      <br/>
      Abrasion uniformity: 1  SIGMA =10 to 20 nm/(removal=500 nm) (common to both (a) and (b)).
    </p>
    <p num="53">
      The platen/head rotation ratio of 30/40 is set to improve the abrasion uniformity over the wafer surface.
      <br/>
      The abrasion uniformity indicates a uniformity when a film is abraded by 500 nm.
      <br/>
      The surface of the insulating film 44 abraded under the above conditions is flat without any step as shown in FIG. 3.

      (10) A conductive barrier layer 54 is formed covering the plugs 52s, 52d and 52k, side wall spacers 52S and 52D and exposed adhesion layer 50.

      This barrier layer 54 can be formed with good coverage because the side walls of the interconnect grooves 44S and 44D are covered with the side wall spacers and the steps are relaxed.
      <br/>
      Similar to the adhesion layer 50, the barrier layer 54 can be formed by sequentially depositing a Ti layer and a TiN layer (or TiON layer) by sputtering.

      For example, the Ti layer is deposited 7 nm in thickness and the TiN layer is deposited 50 nm.

      Next, a wiring material layer 56 is formed by sputtering or CVD, covering the barrier layer 54 and being inlaid in the interconnect grooves 44S and 44D, and if necessary a reflow process is performed to make the wiring material layer 56 sufficiently fill the interconnect grooves 44S and 44D.
      <br/>
      Since the barrier layer 54 is formed with good coverage, a void is not formed in the wiring material layer 56 nor diffused into the wiring material layer.

    <p num="86">After the layer 56 is formed under the above conditions, the substrate with the layer 56 is heated to 400 to 550 (degree)  C. to reflow the layer 56 to completely fill the interconnect grooves 44S and 44D with the layer 56.</p>
    <p num="87">Even if the layer 56 is formed by sputtering, good coverage can be obtained and voids are not formed at the later reflow process, because the side walls of the interconnect grooves 44S and 44D are covered with the side wall spacers and the steps are relaxed.</p>
    <p num="88">If the collimated sputtering or long throw sputtering is used when the layer 56 is formed by sputtering, the interconnect grooves can be filled with the layer 56 with less strict reflow conditions, because a sufficient initial film thickness can be obtained even on the bottom of a small interconnect groove.</p>
    <p num="89">
      Instead of the Al or Al alloy layer, the wiring material layer 56 may be made of Cu or Cu alloy (Cu-Cr, Cu-Zr, Cu-Pd or the like).
      <br/>
      In this case, a target used for sputtering is replaced by Cu or Cu alloy.
    </p>
    <p num="90">As a film forming method suitable for filling the interconnect grooves 44S and 44D, PVD (physical vapor deposition) or CVD may be used instead of the above-described sputtering-reflow.</p>
    <p num="91">
      If PVD is used, a process of forming a film and a process of filling the groove with the film can be realized at the same time without using a separate reflow process.
      <br/>
      For example, both the processes can be realized at the same time by high temperature sputtering, by heating the substrate 40 ultimately to a substrate temperature of 400 to 550 (degree)  C. while Al or Al alloy constituting the wiring material layer 56 is sputtered.
    </p>
    <p num="92">
      If CVD is used, it is advantageous in that the inside of a small interconnect groove can be filled with the film with good coverage.
      <br/>
      For example, the film can be formed by using a gas such as dimethyl-aluminum-hydride (DMAH) and an H2 carrier gas under the conditions of a substrate temperature of 100 to 250 (degree)  C. and a gas flow rate of 200 to 500 sccm.
      <br/>
      In this case, if the substrate temperature is set low, the Al layer (layer 56) formed does not reflow so that the coverage of the layer 56 is poor and the layer 56 is conformal to the shape of the underlying layer.
      <br/>
      In this case, after the Al layer (layer 56) is formed, it is reflowed in a vacuum or inert gas atmosphere so that the Al layer can be inlaid in the interconnect grooves 44S and 44D.

      The timing of stopping CMP can be detected by monitoring the amount of material of the adhesion layer 50 contained in abrasion waste.
      <br/>
      Specifically, while the wiring material layer 56 is abraded, the material of the adhesion layer 50 will not be drained to the abrasion waste.
      <br/>
      After the CMP for the wiring material layer 56 is completed at the surface level of the barrier layer 54 over the flat surface of the insulating film 44, the barrier layer 54 is then abraded and thereafter the adhesion layer 50 is abraded when a large amount of the material of this layer 50 is drained to the abrasion waste and the concentration increases sharply.

      In the process shown in FIG. 12, the adhesion layer 50 is etched after the over-etching process shown in FIG. 9.

      The adhesion layer 50 exposed on the flat portion of the insulating film 44 and in the interconnect grooves 44S and 44D is dry-etched, for example, by RIE.

      Since the adhesion layer 50 exposed on the flat portion of the insulating film 44 is removed, the layer 50 on the flat portion of the insulating film 44 is not necessary to be removed at a CMP process shown in FIG. 14 to be described later.

      This CMP process is generally the same as that described with FIG. 11. However, the timing of stopping the CMP process is changed.

      The time period while the excessive CMP is performed may be determined empirically or may be determined from the following calculations in order to perform the excessive CMP more reliably.

      After the cap layer 60 is formed, rapid thermal anneal (RTA) may be performed for 10 to 60 seconds in an N2 atmosphere at a substrate temperature of 500 to 800 (degree)  C., in order to improve the heat resistance and barrier performance of the cap layer 60.
      <br/>
      Afterward, another insulating layer such as silicon oxide will be formed thereon.
    </p>
    <p num="116">The materials of the cap layer 60 are not limited to those described above, but other materials may be used including an alloy of refractory metal such as TiW, metal silicide, a lamination of metal silicide and metal nitride such as TiN, and a lamination of refractory metal and its nitride (or boride).</p>
    <p num="117">
      The cap layer 60 is used for improving the reliability of the wiring material layer 56 made of Al or Al alloy or Cu or Cu alloy, by preventing the surface oxidation of the wiring material layer and increasing a resistance to electromigration.
      <br/>
      If Cu or Cu alloy is used as the material of the wiring material layer 56, the cap layer 60 functions as a barrier layer for preventing oxidation by oxygen diffused from the insulating layer or preventing Cu from diffusing into the insulating layer.
      <br/>
      It is therefore necessary to cover Cu containing wiring material much more reliably with the cap layer 60.
      <br/>
      It is therefore preferable to form the cap layer 60 thicker if Cu containing wiring material is used, than if Al or Al alloy is used as the material of the wiring material layer 56.

      Next, in the process shown in FIG. 16, the cap layer 60 is partially removed by CMP to planarize the surface thereof, to leave the first and second portions 60s and 60d of the cap layer 60 in the interconnect grooves 44S and 44D, respectively.

      The thickness of the left cap layers 60s and 60d can be controlled in accordance with the recess depth in the interconnect grooves at the process shown in FIG. 14, the thickness of the cap layer 60 at the process shown in FIG. 15, the abrasion amount of the cap layer 60 at the process shown in FIG. 16, and other parameters.

      The features of the second embodiment reside firstly in that interconnect grooves and connection holes are formed by a single etching process by using resist patterns 62 and 64 as a mask and secondary in that a conductive material layer 52 is anisotropically etched back and thereafter a void or seam Q is taper-etched to enlarge the void or seam Q toward the opening thereof.

      <br/>
      The holes 62s, 62d and 62k correspond to connection holes coupled to the contact surfaces of the source region S, drain region D and wiring K. The resist pattern 62 is subjected to heat treatment at about 150 (degree)  after the development, or is subjected to both the heat treatment and an ultraviolet radiation process.
      <br/>
      This is performed in order to cure the resist pattern 62 on which another resist pattern is to be formed.

      Next, in the process shown in FIG. 18, on the resist pattern 62, another resist pattern 64 having holes 64s and 64d is formed by photolithography.

      The hole 64s corresponds to an interconnect groove coupled to the contact surface of the source region S, and the hole 64d corresponds to an interconnect groove coupled to the contact surfaces of the drain region D and wiring K.

    <p num="126">
      The resist patterns may be formed by coating two resist layers having different photosensitive wavelengths, by patterning the upper resist layer to have an interconnect groove pattern, and by patterning the lower resist layer to have a connection hole pattern.

      Alternatively, the resist patterns may be formed by coating a lower resist layer, by coating on the lower resist layer an upper resist layer containing compounds which absorb light of a photosensitive wavelength of the lower resist layer, by patterning the upper resist layer to have the interconnect groove pattern while preventing the lower resist pattern from being exposed to the light, and by patterning the lower resist layer to have the connection hole pattern.

    <p num="127">Next, in the process shown in FIG. 19, by using the resist patterns 62 and 64 as a mask, the insulating film 44 is anisotropically etched to form connection holes 44s, 44d and 44k and interconnect grooves 44S and 44D by a single etching process.</p>
    <p num="128">
      In this case, it is preferable to etch both the resist patterns 62 and 64 and insulating film 44 at nearly the same etching rate.

      Power: 400 to 700 (preferably 550) W
      <br/>
      Magnetic field: 100 Gauss

    <p num="129">
      Under these dry-etching conditions, the insulating film 44 in the areas of the holes 62s, 62d and 62k of the resist pattern 62 is first etched, and at the same time the resist pattern 62 in the areas exposed in the holes 64s and 64d of the resist pattern 64 is removed and the resist pattern 64 is removed.
      <br/>
      In succession, as the insulating film 44 in the areas of the holes 64s and 64d of the resist pattern 64 is removed by using the left resist pattern 62 as a mask, the left resist pattern 62 is etched and removed.
      <br/>
      As a result, the connection hole pattern of the resist pattern 62 and the interconnect groove pattern of the resist pattern 64 can be correctly transferred to the insulating film 44.

    <p num="130">
      An over-etch is not performed because the interconnect grooves are etched too deep if it is performed.

      The etching is controlled by calculating from the etching rate of the insulating film 44 an etching time taken to etch the film 44 to a necessary depth (e.g., 500 to 1000 nm) which allows the connection holes 44s, 44d and 44k to reliably reach the contact surfaces of the source region S, drain region D and wiring K.

      Therefore, an interconnect layer 58S connected to the source region S and an interconnect layer 58D locally interconnecting the drain region D and wiring K are formed.

      When necessary, similar processes are repeated to form multi-layer wiring structure.
    </p>
    <p num="159">
      In the first to fourth embodiments described above, the interconnect layers 58S and 58D connected to the source and drain regions S and D are formed.

      By using the processes of forming the interconnect layers 58S and 58D, higher level interconnect layers connected to the lower level interconnect layers may also be formed.
    </p>
    <p num="160">The following functions and advantages can be obtained according to the embodiments of the invention.</p>
    <p num="161">
      (a) As shown in FIGS. 11, 16, 23, and 27, since the interconnect layer 58S (58D) is constituted of the plug 52s (52d, 52k) and low resistance wiring material layer 56s (56d), it is possible to lower the resistance of the interconnect layer.
      <br/>
      The wiring resistance can be lowered further in the case of the wiring structures shown in FIGS. 23 and 27 because the void or seam Q of the plug 52s (52d, 52k) is filled with the low resistance wiring layer 56s (56d).
    </p>
    <p num="162">(b) Since the conductive material layer 52 is thinned by an etch-back, the problems associated with the CMP process can be solved, the problems including an enlarged void or seam, contamination, foreign material attachment, damages and the like to be caused by abrasive particles such as alumina.</p>
    <p num="163">
      (c) As shown in FIG. 9, the connection hole 44s (44d, 44k) is filled with the plug 52s (52d, 52k) and the side wall spacer 52S (52D) is formed on the side wall of the interconnect groove 44S (44D).
      <br/>
      Therefore, as shown in FIG. 10 the barrier layer 54 and wiring material layer 56 can be formed with good coverage.
      <br/>
      As a result, as shown in FIGS. 11 and 16 even if the void or seam Q is left, it is not directly exposed to the wiring material layer 56s (56d) because of the presence of the barrier layer 54s (54d), so that the void or seam Q is suppressed from being migrated into the wiring layer or from being diffused into the wiring layer, thereby improving the reliability of interconnects.
    </p>
    <p num="164">
      (d) As shown in FIG. 21, the connection hole 44s (44d, 44k) is filled with the plug 52s (52d, 52k), the side wall spacer 52S (52D) is formed on the side wall of the interconnect groove 44S (44D), and the void or seam Q is worked to have a normal taper.
      <br/>
      Therefore, as shown in FIG. 22 the wiring material layer 56 can be formed with good coverage.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, the void or seam Q is not left in the connection hole and the reliability of interconnects can be improved without the barrier layer as shown in FIG. 23A. If the barrier layer portion 54s (54d) is formed as shown in FIG. 27A, the reliability of interconnects can be improved further.
    </p>
    <p num="165">
      (e) The side wall spacer 52S (52D) functions as the barrier layer in combination with the adhesion layer 50s (50d).
      <br/>
      If the barrier layer 54s (54d) is formed, the barrier performance of the barrier layers 52s and 52S (52d and 52D) can be reinforced.
      <br/>
      For example, if Cu or Cu alloy is used as the material of the wiring material layer 56, the side wall spacer 52S (52D) suppresses oxygen diffusion (oxidation of wiring material) from the insulating film 44 to the wiring material layer 56 and diffusion of metal such as Cu into the insulating layer 44.
      <br/>
      Such suppression effects can be enhanced by forming the barrier layer 54s (54d).
      <br/>
      The side wall spacer can therefore improve the reliability of interconnects which is further improved by adding the barrier layer 54s (54d).
