      Field of the Invention
    </p>
    <p num="2">The present invention relates to a flame-retardant resin composition showing excellent flame retardancy without using any halogen-based flame retardant, as well as to a sealant for semiconductor, using the composition.</p>
    <p num="3">2. Related Art Statement</p>
    <p num="4">
      Thermosetting resins typified by epoxy resins, etc. are in wide use in parts of electric or electronic appliances, etc. for their excellent properties.
      <br/>
      In many cases, flame retardancy is imparted to the thermosetting resins to allow them to have safety to fire.
      <br/>
      The flame retardancy of these resins has generally been achieved by using a halogen-containing compound such as brominated epoxy compound or the like.
      <br/>
      While halogen-containing compounds have high flame retardancy, aromatic bromine compounds liberate bromine or hydrogen bromide (these are corrosive) when thermally decomposed and, when decomposed in the presence of oxygen, may form a polybromodibenzofuran or a polydibromodibenzoxine (these are very toxic).
      <br/>
      Further, bromine-containing waste materials are very difficult to dispose.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      It is well known that for the above reasons, extensive study is being made on phosphorus compounds as a flame retardant replacing the bromine-containing flame retardant.
      <br/>
      Addition of a phosphoric acid ester or the like to an epoxy resin, however, has limited applications because of problems of bleeding and hydrolysis.
      <br/>
      Further, ordinary phosphoric acid ester compounds having a functional group such as phenolic hydroxyl group or the like cause hydrolysis and liberate free phosphoric acid, which invites conspicuous impairment of electrical properties or reliability.
    </p>
    <heading>OBJECT OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="6">
      An intensive study has been made to solve the above problems and, as a result, the present invention has been completed.
      <br/>
      The present invention provides a resin composition which has high flame retardancy without using any halogen compound and which does not impair the properties of an article to which the composition is applied.

    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="7">The present invention resides in:</p>
    <p num="8">a flame-retardant resin composition comprising:</p>
    <p num="9">
      - (A) an epoxy resin other than halogenated epoxy resins, having at least two epoxy groups in the molecule,
      <br/>
      - (B) a curing agent, and
      <br/>
      - (C) a product obtained by reacting (C1) a phosphorus compound having at least one P-H linkage in the molecule, with (C2) a compound having, in the molecule, at least one functional group selected from the group consisting of C--C double bond, epoxy group, alcoholic hydroxyl group and carbonyl group, and at least one functional group selected from the group consisting of epoxy group, phenolic hydroxyl group, amino group, cyanate ester group and isocyanate group, and having a phosphorus content of 0.3% by weight to 8% by weight; and
      <br/>
      a sealant for semiconductor, using the above composition.
    </p>
    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="10">
      As mentioned above, addition of a phosphoric acid ester or the like to an epoxy resin has limited applications because of problems of bleeding and hydrolysis.
      <br/>
      Further, ordinary phosphoric acid ester compounds having a functional group such as phenolic hydroxyl group or the like cause hydrolysis and liberate free phosphoric acid, which invites conspicuous impairment of electrical properties or reliability.
      <br/>
      In order to solve these problems of the prior art, the present invention has achieved both flame retardancy and reliability by (1) reacting a compound having a P-H linkage, with a functional group capable of causing an addition reaction or a condensation reaction with said compound, to form a phosphorus compound having a P-C linkage stable to hydrolysis and (2) reacting a matrix resin (an epoxy resin and a curing agent having a phenolic hydroxyl group) with a functional group reactive with said epoxy resin or said curing agent, to form a strong bond.
    </p>
    <p num="11">
      In the present invention, the epoxy resin (A) other than halogenated epoxy resins, having at least two epoxy groups in the molecule can be exemplified by bisphenol A type epoxy resin; bisphenol F type epoxy resin; bisphenol S type epoxy resin; phenolic novolac type epoxy resin; cresol novolac type epoxy resin; naphthalene type epoxy resin; biphenyl type epoxy resin; and N-glycidyl compounds of aromatic amines or heterocyclic nitrogen bases, for example, N,N-diglycidylaniline, triglycidyl isocyanurate and N,N,N',N'-tetraglycidyl-bis(p-amino-phenyl)-methane.
      <br/>
      The epoxy resin (A) is not restricted to these examples.
      <br/>
      These compounds may be used in admixture of two or more kinds.
      <br/>
      The epoxy resin (A) excludes halogen-containing epoxy resins such as brominated bisphenol A epoxy resin, brominated novolac epoxy resin and the like because the resin composition of the present invention uses no halogen-based flame retardant.
      <br/>
      However, when the epoxy resin used in the present resin composition is an ordinary epoxy resin produced from epichlorohydrin, the chlorine contained in the epoxy resin is inevitably contained in the present resin composition, but the amount thereof is a level known to those skilled in the art and is an order of several hundreds of ppm in terms of hydrolyzable chlorine.
    </p>
    <p num="12">
      In the present invention, as the curing agent (B), there can be used all curing agents known to those skilled in the art.
      <br/>
      Examples thereof are amines such as C2-20 straight chain aliphatic diamines (e.g. ethylenediamine, trimethylenediamine, tetramethylenediamine and hexamethylenediamine), metaphenylenediamine, paraphenylenediamine, paraxylenediamine, 4,4'-diaminodiphenyl-methane, 4,4'-diaminodiphenylpropane, 4,4'-diaminodiphenyl ether, 4,4'-diaminodiphenylsulfone, 4,4'-diaminodicyclohexane, bis(4-aminophenyl)phenylmethane, 1,5-diaminonaphthalene, metaxylylenediamine, paraxylylenediamine, 1,1-bis(4-aminophenyl)cyclohexane, dicyandiamide and the like; novolac type phenolic resins such as phenolic novolac resin, cresol novolac resin, tert-butylphenol novolac resin, nonylphenol novolac resin and the like; phenolic resins such as resole type phenolic resin, phenol aralkyl resin and the like; polyoxystyrenes such as polyparaoxystyrene and the like; and acid anhydrides.
      <br/>
      The curing agent (B) is not restricted to these examples.
      <br/>
      When the present resin composition is used as a semiconductor sealant, the curing agent (B) is preferably a novolac type phenolic resin (e.g. phenolic novolac resin, cresol novolac resin, tert-butylphenol novolac resin or nonylphenol novolac resin), a resole type phenolic resin, a polyoxystyrene (e.g. polyparaoxystyrene) or a phenol aralkyl resin, for their excellency in moisture resistance, reliability, etc.
    </p>
    <p num="13">In the present invention, the phosphorus compound (C1) having at least one P-H linkage in the molecule, used for synthesis of the component (C) is preferably at least one phosphorus compound selected from the group consisting of 9,10-dihydro-9-oxa-10-phosphaphenanthrene-10-oxide, diphenylphosphine oxide, diphenyl phosphite and phenylphosphinic acid.</p>
    <p num="14">In the compound (C2) used for synthesis of the component (C), it is preferable that the C--C double bond as the functional group is at least one group selected from the group consisting of allyl group, acrylic group, methacrylic group and maleimide group, or that the alcoholic hydroxyl group as the functional group is hydroxymethyl group, or that the carbonyl group as the functional group is at least one group selected from the group consisting of carboxyl group, formyl group and acetyl group.</p>
    <p num="15">The component (C), which is a product obtained by the reaction of the phosphorus compound (C1) with the compound (C2), can be used as a single compound or in admixture of two or more compounds.</p>
    <p num="16">
      In the present invention, the reaction for synthesis of the component (C) is conducted by melt-mixing the phosphorus compound (C1) having a P-H linkage and the compound (C2) at a temperature not lower than the melting point of the compound (C1).
      <br/>
      The condensation reaction between the P-H linkage of the compound (C1) and the functional group of the compound (C2) is preferably conducted while the condensation water generated is being removed under reduced pressure.
      <br/>
      The reaction can be conducted in a bulk state, but can also be conducted using a solvent inert to the phosphorus compound having a P-H linkage and also to C--C double bond, epoxy group, alcoholic hydroxyl group, carbonyl group, phenolic hydroxyl group, amino group, cyanate ester group and isocyanate group.
    </p>
    <p num="17">
      The proportions of the epoxy resin (A) and the curing agent (B) used are appropriately determined in consideration of that the component (C) may have an epoxy group or a phenolic hydroxyl group.
      <br/>
      The presence of either of these functional groups in a large excess is not preferable because it invites reduction in moisture resistance, moldability and electrical properties after curing.
      <br/>
      The proportion of the component (C) is determined so that the phosphorus content in the resin composition becomes 0.3% by weight to 8% by weight.
      <br/>
      When the proportion is smaller than 0.3% by weight, no flame-retardant effect is obtained.
      <br/>
      When the proportion is larger than 8% by weight, there occur reduction in heat resistance and moisture resistance and impairment of moldability.

    <p num="18">
      The flame-retardant resin composition of the present invention has high flame retardancy without using any halogen compound and does not impair the properties of an article to which the composition is applied.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the resin composition can be suitably used as a sealant for semiconductor element, electronic part or electrical part; as a coating material; as an insulating material; or as a laminated sheet, a metal-clad laminated sheet, or the like.
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      When the present flame-retardant resin composition is used as a sealant for semiconductor element, various additives known to those skilled in the art are added to the composition.
      <br/>
      Such additives include fillers (e.g. silica powder, alumina, talc, calcium carbonate, titanium white, clay and mica) and, optionally, releasing agents (e.g. natural wax, synthetic wax, metal salt of straight chain fatty acid, acid amide, ester and paraffin), coloring agents (e.g. carbon black and red iron oxide), curing accelerators, etc.
      <br/>
      A semiconductor sealant can be produced by uniformly mixing, by the use of a mixer or the like, the present flame-retardant resin composition, a filler and other additives at a given composition, then subjecting the resulting mixture to kneading by a hot roll or to mixing by a kneader or the like, cooling the resulting material for solidification, and grinding the resulting solid into an appropriate size.
      <br/>
      The thus-obtained sealant can be suitably used for sealing of semiconductor elements by transfer molding, injection molding or the like.

    <p num="20">
      When the present flame-retardant resin composition is used for coating, production of a laminated sheet, or other usage, the composition is dissolved in a solvent to prepare a varnish.
      <br/>
      In producing a laminated sheet, the varnish is coated on or impregnated into a substrate such as paper, woven glass fabric, nonwoven glass fabric, nonglass fabric or the like; the coated or impregnated substrate is dried in a dryer at 80 to 200 (degree)  C.; thereby, a prepreg is produced.
      <br/>
      The prepreg is heated and pressed to produce a laminated sheet, a metal-clad laminated sheet for printed circuit board, or the like.

    <p num="21">
      In preparing a varnish of the present flame-retardant resin composition, an ordinary solvent is used.
      <br/>
      The solvent is required to have good solvency for a part or all of the components of the flame-retardant resin composition, but may be a poor solvent as long as it has no adverse effect.
      <br/>
      Examples of the usable solvent are ketone type solvents such as acetone, methyl ethyl ketone, methyl isobutyl ketone, cyclohexanone and the like; aromatic hydrocarbon type solvents such as toluene, xylene, mesitylene and the like; glycol ether type solvents such as methyl cellosolve, ethyl cellosolve, butyl cellosolve, isobutyl cellosolve, diethylene glycol monomethyl ether, triethylene glycol monomethyl ether, propylene glycol monomethyl ether, dipropylene glycol monomethyl ether, propylene glycol monopropyl ether, dipropylene glycol monopropyl ether, ethylene glycol monoisopropyl ether, diethylene glycol monoisopropyl ether, diethylene glycol monobutyl ether and the like; ester type solvents such as methyl cellosolve acetate, ethyl cellosolve acetate, butyl cellosolve acetate, ethyl acetate and the like; dialkyl glycol ether type solvents such as ethylene glycol dimethyl ether, diethylene glycol diethyl ether, diethylene glycol dibutyl ether and the like; amide type solvents such as N,N-dimethylacetamide, N,N-dimethylformamide, N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone and the like; and alcohol type solvents such as methanol, ethanol and the like.

      The spiral flow was measured using a die meeting the EMMI specification, under conditions of 175 (degree)  C. and 70 kgf/cm2.
      <br/>
      The curability was evaluated by producing a molded article from the molding material at 175 (degree)  C. for 120 seconds and measuring the Barcol hardness of the molded article.
      <br/>
      The flame resistance was evaluated by producing a molded article from the molding material at 175 (degree)  C. for 3 minutes, subjecting the molded article to post-curing at 175 (degree)  C. for 8 hours to obtain a 1.6 mm-thick sample for flame resistance test, and subjecting the sample to a flame resistance test (vertical method) according to UL-94.
      <br/>
      The reliability was evaluated by producing, from the molding material, a monitor IC (16pDIP) mounting thereon a simulated aluminum element, under the same conditions as used in the production of the sample for flame resistance test, allowing the monitor IC to stand for 1,000 hours under the temperature and humidity conditions of 121 (degree)  C. and 100%, and then counting the number of defectives (defective IC monitors).

      <br/>
      Each of the molding materials was measured for spiral flow, curability, flame resistance and reliability.

      <br/>
      Each of the molding materials was measured for spiral flow, curability, flame resistance and reliability.

      The results are shown in Table 2.

    <p num="39">
      As clear from Tables 1 and 2, in Comparative Examples 5 and 6 using a conventional flame retardant, the amount of the flame retardant is relatively small and consequently the flame resistance is low (V-1); but, the spiral flow is long, the curability is low, and the reliability is low as well.
      <br/>
      In Compoarative Example 4 using another conventional flame retardant, although the amount of the flame retardant is increased and thereby the flame resistance is improved to V-0, the reliability is even lower.
      <br/>
      In Comparative Examples 1 and 2 using a phosphorus compound of the present invention so that the phosphorus content becomes lower than the range (0.3 to 8% by weight) specified in the present invention, the flame resistance is low (V-1); in Comparative Example 3 using a phosphorus compound of the present invention so that the phosphorus content becomes higher than said range, the spiral flow is short and the reliability is low.
      <br/>
      Meanwhile, in each of Examples 1 to 6 using a phosphorus compound of the present invention so that the phosphorus content falls within said range, the flame resistance is satisfactory at V-0 and, even when the phosphorus compound is contained in a relatively large amount (Examples 1-4 and 6), the number of defectives is zero and the reliability is high.
