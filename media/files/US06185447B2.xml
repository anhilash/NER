      Disclosed is an apparatus and a method for three dimensional magnetic resonance data acquisitions using a fast 3D sequence to acquire volumetric data in a cine mode.
      <br/>
      The entire heart can be imaged in the same amount of time that a conventional cine scan requires for a single section.
      <br/>
      The true temporal resolution is similar to that of the segmented k-space acquisition.
      <br/>
      The sequence uses very short repetition times (TR), and hence the inherent contrast is poor.
      <br/>
      This problem is overcome with the use of a T1 shortening agent.
      <br/>
      Since contrast between blood and the myocardium is no longer flow dependent, it is more stable throughout the heart cycle.

    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">This invention relates generally to magnetic resonance data acquisition and imaging, and more particularly the invention relates to a three-dimensional magnetic resonance sequence for acquiring volumetric data depicting a motion cycle.</p>
    <p num="3">
      Cardiac MRI can provide extremely accurate measures of chamber volumes, stroke volume, cardiac output and ejection fraction.
      <br/>
      The most commonly used methods are cine MR (described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,710,717, "Method for Fast Scan Cine NMR Imaging," Norbert J. Pelc and Gary H. Glover, December, 1987), and segmented k-space techniques (described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,377,680, "MRI Cardiac Image Produced by Temporal Data Sharing," Tsur Bernstein and Thomas K. Foo, January, 1995).
      <br/>
      Both of these techniques employ two-dimensional (2D) data acquisition strategies, and have limitations.
      <br/>
      For example, a cine scan with 128 phase-encodings can image 3 slices with a temporal resolution of approximately 60 ms in roughly 2 minutes, but the need for volumetric coverage increases the total scan time substantially.
      <br/>
      The segmented k-space methods reduce the scan time at the expense of temporal resolution.
      <br/>
      They image a single slice in a breath-hold with 80 ms temporal resolution.
      <br/>
      However, the rest periods between scans makes the total scan time for volumetric coverage comparable to that in cine.
      <br/>
      Both techniques produce 2D image sets, which must be concatenated for volumetric measurements.
      <br/>
      Thus, any subject movement during the scan can lead to slice registration errors, which in turn can affect the quality of the results.
      <br/>
      With both techniques, it may be difficult to obtain high spatial resolution in the slice direction.
      <br/>
      Further, both methods can suffer from insufficient contrast between the blood in the chambers and the myocardium, especially during flow stasis in diastole.
      <br/>
      This makes automatic volumetric analysis difficult, and manual analysis is tedious and introduces measurement variability.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      MRI techniques produce images of individual slices by encoding spatial information.
      <br/>
      In the most commonly used method, often called 2DFT or "spin-warp", location in one direction is encoded using selective excitation which generates signal only from a slice through the object.
      <br/>
      Location in a second direction is encoded by acquiring the signal in the presence of a magnetic field in that direction, thereby encoding position into the temporal frequency of the measured signal.
      <br/>
      Location in the third direction is encoded using a preparation "phase encoding gradient".
      <br/>
      To form an image, the sequence of pulses that form the pulse sequence must be repeated many times using many values of this phase encoding gradient.
      <br/>
      The time between sequence repetitions is called the repetition time TR.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      The method described above forms an image of a single plane.
      <br/>
      Many such images to cover a volume can be acquired either sequentially or in an interleaved manner.
      <br/>
      It is also possible to acquire data from a 3D volume simultaneously.
      <br/>
      For example, one can generate signal using an excitation pulse that excites a relatively thick slab.
      <br/>
      Position in the slice direction along the slab is encoded using a second phase encoding gradient.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      Imaging techniques which are faster than those described above are known.
      <br/>
      One, called Echo Planar Imaging (EPI) is even capable of forming an image of an entire slice from data acquired during a single pulse sequence execution.
      <br/>
      However, the image quality using "single shot EPI" may not be acceptable for some applications.
      <br/>
      For these, it is possible to use multi-shot EPI.
      <br/>
      Other fast imaging methods, e.g. spiral k-space scanning, are also known.

      FIG. 1A is a perspective view, partially in section, illustrating coil apparatus in MR imaging system and FIGS. 1B-1D illustrate field gradients which can be produced in the apparatus of FIG. 1A. Briefly, the uniform static field Bo is generated by the magnet comprising the coil pair 10.
      <br/>
      A gradient field G(x) is generated by a complex gradient coil set which can be wound on the cylinder 12.

      An RF field B1 is generated by a saddle coil 14.
      <br/>
      A patient undergoing imaging would be positioned along the Z axis within in the saddle coil.
      <br/>
      In FIG. 1B an ideal X gradient field is shown which is parallel to the static field Bo and varies linearly with distance along the X axis but does not vary with distance along the Y or Z axes.
      <br/>
      FIGS. 1C and 1D are similar representations of the Y gradient and Z gradient fields, respectively.

      <br/>
      A computer 20 was programmed to control the operation of the MRI apparatus and process FID signals detected therefrom.
      <br/>
      The gradient field is energized by a gradient amplifier 22 and the RF coils for impressing an RF magnetic moment which rotates at the Larmor frequency is controlled by the transmitter 24 and the RF coils 26.
      <br/>
      After the selected nuclei have been excited, the RF coils 26 are employed to detect the FID signal which is passed through the receiver 28 and then through digitizer 30 for processing by computer 20.
      <br/>
      For the dynamic imaging techniques of the present invention, physiological monitoring and triggering equipment (not shown) may be needed, as known by one skilled in the art.

    <p num="14">
      The present invention provides a fast 3D sequence to acquire volumetric data in a cine mode.
      <br/>
      A large volume, perhaps covering the entire heart can be imaged in the same amount of time as a single cine scan.
      <br/>
      The temporal resolution is similar to that in a segmented k-space 2D acquisition.
      <br/>
      Table 1 compares the acquisition times between conventional cardiac cine imaging, a segmented k-space technique, an EPI-based approach, and the 3D cine sequence of the present invention.
      <br/>
      The same spatial resolution is considered in all four techniques.

    <p num="16">
      While conventional cine requires a number of heart beats equal to the number of phase-encoding steps to image one section, the overall scan time can be reduced by simultaneously acquiring up to four sections in an interleaved manner.
      <br/>
      The segmented k-space sequence acquires 8 phase-encoding values per temporal phase, and thus 9 heart beats are required for each section.
      <br/>
      The true temporal resolution is equal to that of conventional cine.
      <br/>
      The EPI technique considered here collects k-space data over 5 heart beats, and offers an improved temporal resolution equal to that of the sequence TR.
      <br/>
      With both the segmented k-space and EPI methods breath-holding is used.
      <br/>
      The rest period between section acquisitions is not included in this table and will further increase the total acquisition time.
    </p>
    <p num="17">
      To perform the volumetric data acquisition in accordance with the invention, the representative short TR gradient recalled data acquisition pulse sequence as shown in FIG. 3 is used.
      <br/>
      A very short TR is accomplished through several steps.
      <br/>
      The sequence design shown here assumes a scanner that is capable of gradients which rise to a full gradient amplitude of 22 mT/m in 184  MU s. The slab excitation (f and g in FIG. 3) is performed with a 600  MU s reduced power selective RF pulse (h; the RF phase waveform is not shown), and data are acquired using a receiver bandwidth of 64 kHz (the readout gradients are shown as waveforms a and b).
      <br/>
      First-order moment nulling is not used in order to keep the echo time (TE) as short as possible.
      <br/>
      The in-plane phase encode gradient is shown as waveform (d).
      <br/>
      An in-plane phase encode "rewinder" gradient used to reduce artifacts (waveform c represents the rewinder for the previous TR).
      <br/>
      RF spoiling and "crusher" gradients (e) are used to improve the suppression of static tissue.
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      A schematic representation of the acquisition scheme is shown in FIG. 4.
      <br/>
      In. FIG. 4, as in conventional cine imaging, the in-plane phase encoding (Gpe) is constant during each heart beat.
      <br/>
      The value of the in-plane phase encode (Gpe) changes with each RR interval, while the value of the slice direction phase encode (Gss) changes with every TR interval.
      <br/>
      The data acquired for each in-plane and slice-direction phase-encoding are interpolated in time to produce data for each desired time frame (tinterp in FIG. 4).
      <br/>
      Data at time tinterp are constructed through linear interpolation of nearest neighbor points.
      <br/>
      All Nz slice-direction phase encodings (Gss) are interleaved in each heart beat, thereby achieving a temporal resolution of Nz * TR.
      <br/>
      The scan time for Ny in-plane phase-encodes is thus Ny heart beats.
      <br/>
      Other interesting schemes can be used.
      <br/>
      For example, if the desired number of slice encoding Nz is too large for the required temporal resolution, a fraction of the Nz encodings can be used in any single heart cycle, the rest being used in another heart cycle.
      <br/>
      Also, some combination of y and z direction phase encodings could be interleaved.
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      Respiratory compensation is implemented by making the value of the in-plane phase-encode dependent on the respiration cycle.
      <br/>
      The method supports zero-padding in the slice-direction, which allows the production of overlapped slices.
      <br/>
      Partial k-space coverage of the in-plane or slice phase-encoded directions can also be used.
    </p>
    <p num="20">
      In this configuration the sequence TR and TE are typically 5.0 and 1.2 ms, respectively.
      <br/>
      A volume of 16 7.5 mm sections can be used to cover the entire heart.
      <br/>
      With this value of Nz, the true temporal resolution is 80 ms.
      <br/>
      Zero-filling by a factor of two in the slice direction will increase the number of reconstructed slices to 32 with no loss of temporal resolution or increase in acquisition time.
      <br/>
      With an in-plane phase encode resolution of 192, and a subject heart rate of 60 bpm, the total acquisition time is 3.2 min.
    </p>
    <p num="21">
      FIG. 5 shows 16 images from one time point in the cardiac cycle from a study of a human subject.
      <br/>
      These data were acquired with the above scan parameters.
      <br/>
      In addition, an axial scan plane and body coil reception were used.
      <br/>
      The imaging field-of-view (FOV) was 24 cm, and a flip angle of 20 (degree)  was used for excitation.
      <br/>
      Respiratory compensation was used to reduce motion artifacts.
      <br/>
      Due to the small FOV, aliasing in the phase-encode direction was eliminated by acquiring the data with the "no phase wrap" option.
      <br/>
      The total imaging time was 6.1 min, and 16 cardiac phases were reconstructed for each section.
    </p>
    <p num="22">
      Because this acquisition scheme uses a short sequence TR and volume excitation the inherent contrast between the heart muscle and the blood is poor.
      <br/>
      This problem can be overcome with the use of a T1 shortening agent.
      <br/>
      Since contrast between blood and the myocardium is no longer flow dependent, it is more stable throughout the heart cycle.
      <br/>
      This is shown in a set of images in FIG. 6.
      <br/>
      These data were acquired using the same protocol as above, but in this case the sequence was run after the administration of an investigational intravascular contrast agent.
      <br/>
      In this case excellent contrast is seen between the blood and myocardium, and the endocardial border is well visualized throughout the entire cycle.
      <br/>
      This is an advantage over the traditional cine approach, where contrast definition is lost towards end diastole as the blood becomes increasingly saturated.
    </p>
    <p num="23">If a T1 shortening agent such as Gd-DTPA is used in this way, more consistent contrast between blood and myocardium can be obtained, and automated image analysis should be simplified.</p>
    <p num="24">
      An advantage of the 3D imaging mode is that zero-filling can be used to produce spatial interpolation between slices.
      <br/>
      In addition, the data can be reformatted in any plane.
    </p>
    <p num="25">
      The scan time needed to image the entire heart with this sequence is short, but too long for breath-holding.
      <br/>
      However, respiratory gating could be used and the scan time would still be clinically acceptable.
