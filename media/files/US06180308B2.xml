    <p num="5">The appropriate components and processes of the above copending applications and patents may be selected for the present invention in embodiments thereof.</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="6">
      This invention is generally directed to liquid developer compositions and processes thereof and wherein there can be generated excellent developed images thereof in, for example, bipolar ion charging processes, and reverse charge imaging and printing development (RCP) processes, wherein a first charging device generates a positive or negative toner polarity, and a second charging device generates an opposite toner charge of a negative or positive polarity, reference U.S. Pat. No. 5,826,147, the disclosure of which is totally incorporated herein by reference, and wherein the developer contains no charge director, or wherein the developer contains substantially no charge director.
      <br/>
      Preferably the liquid developer of the present invention is clear in color and is comprised of a resin, a hydrocarbon carrier, and as a charge acceptor a polyethylene oxide-polypropylene oxide, Alohas, an aluminum-di-tertiary butyl salicylate, as illustrated in U.S. Pat. No. 5,563,015, the disclosure of which is totally incorporated herein by reference, including a mixture of Alohas and EMPHOS PS-900 (tm) , a cyclodextrin charge acceptance agent, or charge acceptance additive component, and an optional colorant.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      The present invention is also specifically directed to a electrostatographic imaging process wherein an electrostatic latent image bearing member containing a layer of marking material, toner particles, or liquid developer as illustrated herein and containing a charge acceptance additive, which additive may be coated on the developer, is selectively charged in an imagewise manner to create a secondary latent image corresponding to the first electrostatic latent image on the imaging member.
      <br/>
      Imagewise charging can be accomplished by a wide beam charge source which generates free mobile charges or ions in the vicinity of the electrostatic latent image coated with the layer of marking material or toner particles.
      <br/>
      The latent image causes the free mobile charges or ions to flow in an imagewise ion stream corresponding to the latent image.
      <br/>
      These charges or ions, in turn, are accepted by the marking material or toner particles, leading to imagewise charging of the marking material or toner particles with the layer of marking material or toner particles itself becoming the latent image carrier.
      <br/>
      The latent image carrying toner layer is subsequently developed by selectively separating and transferring image areas of the toner layer to substrates like paper thereby enabling an output document.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      The present invention also relates to an imaging process and imaging apparatus, wherein an electrostatic latent image including image and nonimage areas are formed in a layer of marking material, and further wherein the latent image can be developed by selectively separating portions of the latent image bearing layer of the marking material comprised of a liquid developer such that the image areas reside on a first surface and the nonimage areas reside on a second surface.
      <br/>
      In an embodiment, the present invention relates to an image development apparatus, comprising a system for generating a first electrostatic latent image on an imaging member, wherein the electrostatic latent image includes image and nonimage areas having distinguishable charge potentials, and a system or device for generating a second electrostatic latent image on a layer of marking materials situated adjacent the first electrostatic latent image on the imaging member, wherein the second electrostatic latent image includes image and nonimage areas having distinguishable charge potentials of a polarity opposite to the charge potentials of the charged image and nonimage areas in the first electrostatic latent image.
      <br/>
      The apparatus and process details can in embodiments be as illustrated in U.S. Pat. No. 5,826,147, the disclosure of which is totally incorporated herein by reference.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      The liquid developers and processes of the present invention possess in embodiments thereof a number of advantages including the development and generation of images with improved image quality, the avoidance of a charge director, the use of the developers in a reverse charging development process, excellent image transfer, and the avoidance of complex chemical charging of the developer.
      <br/>
      Poor transfer can, for example, result in poor solid area coverage if insufficient toner is transferred to the final substrate and can also cause image defects such as smears and hollowed fine features.
      <br/>
      Conversely, over-charging the toner particles may result in low reflective optical density images or poor color richness or chroma since only a few very highly charged particles can discharge all the charge on the dielectric receptor causing too little toner to be deposited.
      <br/>
      To overcome or minimize such problems, the liquid toners, or developers and processes of the present invention were arrived at after extensive research.
      <br/>
      Other advantages are as illustrated herein and also include minimal or no image blooming, the generation of excellent solid area images, minimal or no developed image character defects, and the like.

    <heading>PRIOR ART</heading>
    <p num="10">
      A latent electrostatic image can be developed with toner particles dispersed in an insulating nonpolar liquid.
      <br/>
      These dispersed materials are known as liquid toners, toner or liquid developers.
      <br/>
      The latent electrostatic image may be generated by providing a photoconductive imaging member (PC) or layer with a uniform electrostatic charge, and developing the image with a liquid developer, or colored toner particles dispersed in a nonpolar liquid which generally has a high volume resistivity in excess of about 109 ohm-centimeters, a low dielectric constant, for example below about 3, and a moderate vapor pressure.
      <br/>
      Generally, the toner particles of the liquid developer are less than about or equal to about 30  MU m (microns) average by area size as measured with the Malvern 3600E particle sizer.

      The ionic or zwitterionic charge directors illustrated may include both negative charge directors, such as lecithin, oil-soluble petroleum sulfonates and alkyl succinimide, and positive charge directors such as cobalt and iron naphthanates.

      wherein R1 is selected from the group consisting of hydrogen and alkyl, and n represents a number, and which developer is substantially free of color; an imaging process which comprises the development of an image with the developer; liquid developers comprised of a nonpolar liquid, resin, preferably a thermoplastic resin, as a charge acceptor the aluminum salts of alkylated salicylic acid, like, for example, hydroxy bis�3,5-tertiary butyl salicylic� aluminate, or mixtures thereof, optionally also containing EMPHOS PS-900 (tm) , reference U.S. Pat. No. 5,563,015, the disclosure of which is totally incorporated herein by reference, or as a charge acceptor a cyclodextrin component.
      <br/>
      In embodiments thereof of the present invention the liquid developers can be charged in a device which first charges the developer to a first polarity, such as a positive polarity, followed by a second charging with a second charging device to reverse the developer charge polarity, such as to a negative polarity in an imagewise manner.
      <br/>
      Subsequently, a biased image bearer, (IB) separates the image from the background corresponding to the charged image pattern in the toner, or developer layer.
      <br/>
      Thus, the liquid developers are preferably charged by bipolar ion charging (BIC) rather than with chemical charging.
    </p>
    <p num="33">
      Cyclodextrins and their nitrogenous derivatives can be selected as the nonpolar medium insoluble charge acceptance agent, and which charge acceptance agent is capable of capturing either negative or positive ions to provide either negative or positively charged liquid developers and preferably wherein the cyclodextrins, or derivatives thereof capture positive ions.
      <br/>
      Although not being desired to be limited by theory, it is believed that non-bonded electron pairs on neutral nitrogen atoms (usually amine functional groups but not limited thereto) which reside at the openings of the cyclodextrin cavity capture positive ions from the corona effluent by forming covalent or coordinate covalent (dative) bonds with the positive ions.
      <br/>
      The neutral nitrogen atom in the cyclodextrin molecule then becomes a positively charged nitrogen atom and therefore the cyclodextrin charge acceptor molecule itself becomes positively charged.
      <br/>
      Since the positively charged cyclodextrin molecule resides in the immobile toner particle and not in the mobile phase or liquid carrier, the immobile toner layer itself on the dielectric surface becomes positively charged in an imagewise manner dependent upon the charge acceptor molecule concentration.
      <br/>
      As the charge acceptor concentration can be the same throughout the toner layer, it is the amount of toner at a given location in the toner layer that controls the amount of charge acceptor and charge at that location.
      <br/>
      The amount of charge at a given location then results in differential development (due to different potentials) in accordance with the imagewise pattern deposited on the dielectric surface
    </p>
    <p num="34">
      In addition to the above-described nitrogen (positive) charge acceptance mechanism, two other mechanisms may coexist when using cyclodextrin charge acceptor molecules, with or without nitrogen groups present.
      <br/>
      These mechanisms involve corona ion-acceptance (both involving both ion polarities) or acceptance of ions derived from the interaction of corona ions with other components in the toner layer.
      <br/>
      One mechanism involves the hydroxyl groups, present at the cavity entrances in the cyclodextrin molecules, which can capture either positive or negative corona effluent ions or species derived therefrom.
      <br/>
      In regard to the hydroxyl charge (ion) acceptance mechanism, it is believed that nonbonded electron pairs on one or more of the oxygen atoms in adjacent hydroxyl groups can bond positive ions from the corona effluent or from species derived therefrom, from which there results a positive charge dispersed on one or more hydroxyl oxygen atoms.
      <br/>
      Although the strength of a hydroxyl oxygen-positive ion bond is not as large as that of the amine nitrogen-positive ion bond, multiple oxygen atoms can participate at any given instant in time to complex the positive ion thereby resulting in a sufficient bonding force to acquire permanent positive charging.
      <br/>
      Optionally, the positive ion from the corona effluent or from species derived therefrom can bind to only one hydroxyl oxygen atom, however, the positive ion can then migrate around all the hydroxyl oxygen atoms surrounding the cyclodextrin cavity opening thereby providing positive charge stability by a charge dispersal mechanism.
      <br/>
      Also, in the hydroxyl oxygen-positive ion bonding mechanism, the hydroxyl group hydrogen atom is further capable of hydrogen bonding to negative ions originating from the corona effluent or from species derived therefrom.
      <br/>
      Thus, the hydroxyl group itself is ambivalent in its ability to chemically bind positive and negative ions.
      <br/>
      In the hydroxyl hydrogen bonding mechanism, hydrogen bonding is an on again-off again mechanism referring, for example, to when one hydrogen bond forms and then breaks there is an adjacent hydroxyl hydrogen atom that replaces the first broken hydrogen bond so that hydrogen bonding charge dispersion occurs to again provide charge stability by a charge dispersal mechanism.
      <br/>
      In the second mechanism, corona ion fragments (either polarity) or species derived therefrom that are small enough can become physically entrapped inside the cyclodextrin cavity opening resulting in a charged cyclodextrin molecule and hence again a charged toner layer.
      <br/>
      This ion trapping mechanism is specific to the steric size of the ion or ions emanating from the corona effluent or from species derived therefrom.
      <br/>
      Ions should be able to fit into the cavity opening to be entrapped, and ions too large cannot enter the cavity opening, will not be entrapped and will not charge the toner layer by this mechanism.
      <br/>
      Ions that are too small to rapidly pass into and out of the cyclodextrin cavity opening and are not entrapped for a significant time period, will not charge the toner layer by the aforementioned entrapment mechanism.
      <br/>
      These inappropriately sized ions however could ultimately charge the toner layer as indicated herein.
      <br/>
      Also, some of the corona effluent ions may have first interacted with other toner layer components to produce secondary ions that are captured by the cyclodextrin charge acceptance molecules.
      <br/>
      However, any secondary ion formation that might occur should not be too extensive to cause a degradation of the polymeric toner resin or the colorant during the toner layer charging, and wherein the toner layer retains its integrity and the colorant its color strength.

    <p num="35">
      With regard to the aluminum salts, illustrated herein and the appropriate patents mentioned herein, such as the carboxylate salts selected as charge acceptance additives, preferably at least one of the toner resins in the developer contains a functional group capable of covalently bonding to the aluminum charge acceptance agent.
      <br/>
      Typical functional groups include a carboxylic acid and a hydroxyl group.
      <br/>
      Examples of resins with functional groups are carboxylic acid containing resins such as the NUCREL resins available from E. I. DuPont. When the carboxylic acid group in the resin forms a covalent bond with the aluminum containing charge acceptance agent, it is believed that the carboxylic acid group anchors the charge acceptance agent to the toner resin in the solid phase.
      <br/>
      Thus, when the charge acceptance agent accepts an ionic charge from the corona discharge or from species derived therefrom, the ionic charge is also anchored in the solid phase of the liquid toner.
      <br/>
      Since only toner particles then become charged, the concentration of free mobile ions in the developer liquid phase is avoided or minimized.
      <br/>
      The avoidance of mobile ions in the liquid phase is desirable since they interfere with BIC-RCP development.
      <br/>
      This type of charge acceptance agent preferentially accepts negative ions, wherein the negative ions frequently contain one or more negative oxygen atoms, to provide a negatively charged liquid developer.
      <br/>
      The aluminum salts generally accept oxygen nucleophiles (preferentially as a negative oxygen anion) from the corona effluent by forming a fourth covalent bond between the oxygen nucleophile and the aluminum atom, thereby generating a negative aluminum atom which renders the aluminum-containing molecule negatively charged.
      <br/>
      Acceptance of positive ions, generated from the corona effluent or from species derived therefrom, by an aluminum carboxylate charge acceptor may occur to generate positively charged aluminum-containing molecules.
      <br/>
      Three bonding mechanisms are plausible between positive ions and the aluminum carboxylate charge acceptors and which generate positively charged aluminum-containing molecules and a positively charged toner layer.
      <br/>
      Although not being desired to be limited by theory, (1) a low steady-state concentration of free carboxylate anions, dissociated from the aluminum carboxylate complex but contained therein, could accept positive ions; (2) the aluminum carboxylate complex positive ion acceptance mechanism could also occur by positive ion-hydrogen bonding with water of hydration surrounding the aluminum carboxylate charge acceptor; and (3) the aluminum carboxylate complex positive ion acceptance mechanism could also be accomplished by positive ion-hydrogen bonding with hydroxyl groups, attached to the aluminum atom in the aluminum carboxylate complex.
    </p>
    <p num="36">
      While not being desired to be limited by theory, capturing charge using a charge acceptance agent versus a charge control agent is different mechanistically.
      <br/>
      A first difference resides in the origin and location of the species reacting with a charge acceptance agent versus the origin and location of the species reacting with a charge control agent.
      <br/>
      The species reacting with a charge acceptance agent originate in the corona effluent, which after impinging on the toner layer, become trapped in the solid phase thereof.
      <br/>
      The species reacting with a charge control agent, i.e. the charge director originates by purposeful formulation of the charge director into the liquid developer and remains soluble in the liquid phase of the toner layer.
      <br/>
      Both the charge acceptance agent (in BIC-RCP developers) and the charge control additive or agent (in chemically charged developers) are insoluble in the liquid developer medium and reside on and in the toner particles, however, charge directors used for chemically charged developers, dissolve in the developer medium.
      <br/>
      A second difference between a charge acceptance agent and a charge director is that charge directors in chemically charged liquid developers charge toner particles to the desired polarity, while at the same time capturing the charge of opposite polarity so that charge neutrality is maintained during this chemical equilibrium process.
      <br/>
      Charge separation occurs only later when the developer is placed in an electric field during development.
      <br/>
      In the BIC-RCP development process, the corona effluent used to charge the liquid developer is generated from any corona generating device and the dominant polarity of the effluent is fixed by the device.
      <br/>
      Corona ions first reach the surface of the toner layer, move through the liquid phase, and are adsorbed onto the toner particle and captured by the charge acceptance agent.
      <br/>
      The mobile or free corona ions in the liquid phase rapidly migrate to the ground plane.
      <br/>
      Some of these mobile ions may include counterions, if counter ions are formed in the charging process.
      <br/>
      Counter ions bear the opposite polarity charge versus the charged toner particles in the developer.
      <br/>
      The corona ions captured by the charge acceptance agent in or on the toner charge the developer to the same polarity as the dominant polarity charge in the corona effluent.
      <br/>
      The ion-charged liquid developer particles remain charged and most counter-ions, if formed in the process, exit to the ground plane so fewer counter charges remain in the developer layer.
      <br/>
      Electrical neutrality or equilibrium is not usually attained in the BIC-RCP development process and development is not usually interfered with by species containing counter charges.
    </p>
    <p num="37">
      The slightly soluble charge acceptance agent initially resides in the liquid phase but prior to charging the toner layer the charge acceptance agent preferably deposits on the toner particle surfaces.
      <br/>
      The concentration of charge acceptor in the nonpolar solvent is believed to be close to the charge acceptor insolubility limit at ambient temperature especially in the presence of toner particles.
      <br/>
      The adsorption affinity between soluble charge acceptor and insoluble toner particles is believed to accelerate charge acceptor adsorption such that charge acceptor insolubility occurs at a lower charge acceptor concentration versus when toner particles are not present.
      <br/>
      When the insoluble or slightly soluble charge acceptors accept (chemically bind) ions from the impinging corona effluent (BIC) or from species derived therefrom, there is obtained a net charge on the toner particles in the liquid developer.
      <br/>
      Since the toner layer contains charge acceptors capable of capturing both positive and negative ions, the net charge on the toner layer is not determined by the charge acceptor but instead is determined by the predominant ion polarity emanating from the corona.
      <br/>
      Corona effluents rich in positive ions give rise to charge acceptor capture of more positive ions, and therefore, provide a net positive charge to the toner layer.
      <br/>
      Corona effluents rich in negative ions give rise to charge acceptor capture of more negative ions, and therefore, provide a net negative charge to the toner layer.
    </p>
    <p num="38">
      A difference in the charging mechanism of a charge acceptance agent versus is that after charging a liquid developer via the standard charge director (chemical charging) mechanism, the developer contains an equal number of charges of both polarity.
      <br/>
      An equal number of charges of both polarities in the developer hinders reverse charge imaging, so adding a charge director to the developer before depositing the uncharged developer onto the dielectric surface is undesirable.
      <br/>
      However, if corona ions in the absence of a charge director are used to charge the toner layer, the dominant ion polarity in the effluent will be accepted by the toner particles to a greater extent resulting in a net toner charge of the desired polarity and little if any counter-charged particles.
      <br/>
      When the toner layer on the dielectric receiver has more of one kind (positive or negative) of charge on it, reverse charge imaging is facilitated.
    </p>
    <p num="39">
      Of importance with respect to the present invention is the presence in the liquid developer of the charge acceptor, for example, the aluminum salts illustrated herein, cyclodextrins, and the like, which agents function to for example, increase the Q/M of both positive and negatively charged developers.
      <br/>
      The captured charge can be represented by Q=fCV where C is the capacitance of the toner layer, V is the measured surface voltage, and f is a proportionality constant which is dependent upon the distribution of captured charge in the toner layer.
      <br/>
      M in Q/M is the total mass of the toner solids.
      <br/>
      It is believed that with the developers of the present invention in embodiments all charges are associated with the solid toner particles.

      <br/>
      More specifically, cooling can be accomplished, for example, in the same vessel, such as an attritor, while simultaneously grinding with particulate media to prevent the formation of a gel or solid mass; without stirring to form a gel or solid mass, followed by shredding the gel or solid mass and grinding by means of particulate media; or with stirring to form a viscous mixture and grinding by means of particulate media.
      <br/>
      The resin precipitate is cold ground for about 1 to about 36 hours, and preferably from about 2 to about 4 hours.
      <br/>
      Additional liquid may be added during the preparation of the liquid developer to facilitate grinding or to dilute the developer to the appropriate percent solids needed for developing.
      <br/>
      Other processes of preparation are generally illustrated in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,760,009; 5,017,451; 4,923,778; 4,783,389, the disclosures of which are totally incorporated herein by reference.

      As illustrated herein, the developers or inks of the present invention can be selected for RCP imaging and printing methods wherein, for example, there can be selected an imaging apparatus, wherein an electrostatic latent image, including image and nonimage areas, is formed in a layer of marking or liquid developer material, and further wherein the latent image can be developed by selectively separating portions of the latent image bearing layer of the marking material such that the image areas reside on a first surface and the nonimage areas reside on a second surface.
      <br/>
      In embodiments, the present invention relates to an image development apparatus, comprising a system for generating a first electrostatic latent image on an imaging member, wherein the electrostatic latent image includes image and nonimage areas having distinguishable charge potentials, and a system for generating a second electrostatic latent image on a layer of marking materials situated adjacent the first electrostatic latent image on the imaging member, wherein the second electrostatic latent image includes image and nonimage areas having distinguishable charge potentials of a polarity opposite to the charge potentials of the charged image and nonimage areas in the first electrostatic latent image.
      <br/>
      Marking material refers, for example, to the solids of the liquid developer or the liquid developer itself.

    <heading>CHARGING CURRENT TEST</heading>
    <p num="66">Charging Current Test For Embodiments Using Cyclodextrins as Charge Acceptance Agents</p>
    <p num="67">
      An experimental setup for accomplishing a charging current test is illustrated in FIG. 1.
      <br/>
      A thin (5 to 25 micrometers) liquid toner layer 5 is prepared on a flat conductive plate 6.
      <br/>
      The plate is grounded through a meter 7.
      <br/>
      The charging wire of the scorotron is represented by 1, the scorotron grid by 3, ions by 4, ground by 8, and electrostatic voltmeter by 10 with DC representing direct current.
      <br/>
      A charging device, such as a scorotron 2, is placed above the plate.
      <br/>
      With no toner layer on the plate (bare plate), the current that passes through the plate to the ground is a constant (Ib) during charging.
      <br/>
      Assuming a toner layer is a pure insulator, the current passing from the plate to the ground is zero during charging.
      <br/>
      By monitoring the current that passes through the plate to ground, the toner charge capture or acceptance ability can be measured.
      <br/>
      The closer the steady state current is to zero, the more charge the toner layer has captured or accepted.
      <br/>
      The closer the steady state current is to the bare plate current Ib, the less charge the toner layer has captured or accepted.
      <br/>
      The faster the current reaches its steady state, the higher is the toner charge capturing or accepting efficiency.
      <br/>
      One way to analyze the experimental data is to calculate the absolute current difference of a toner layer on the plate and a bare plate.
      <br/>
      The larger the current difference, the more charge the toner layer has captured or accepted.

    <heading>CHARGING VOLTAGE TEST</heading>
    <p num="68">Charging Voltage Test For Embodiments Using Cyclodextrins as Charge Acceptance Agents</p>
    <p num="69">
      An experimental setup for a charging voltage test is similar to the one illustrated in FIG. 1 except that a meter 7 is not required.
      <br/>
      A thin (5 to 25 micrometers) liquid toner layer is prepared on a flat conductive plate.
      <br/>
      A scorotron is placed above the sample plate.
      <br/>
      When the scorotron is turned off, the charged toner layer on the plate is instantly moved to an immediately adjacent location underneath the electrostatic voltmeter (ESV) in order to measure the surface voltage.
      <br/>
      The ESV 10 is located about 1 to about 2 millimeters above the charged toner layer.
      <br/>
      A typical test involves first charging the toner layer with a scorotron for 0.5 second, and then monitoring the surface voltage decay as a function of time for two minutes.
      <br/>
      This is accomplished for both positively and negatively charged toner layers.

    <heading>CHARGING CURRENT TEST RESULTS</heading>
    <p num="84">
      Tables 1 and 2 contain the charging current test results.
      <br/>
      Table 1 lists the raw data readings and Table 2 lists the after process data.
      <br/>
      The following discussion and numbers refer to Table 2.
      <br/>
      The charging current test experimental setup is illustrated in FIG. 1.
      <br/>
      When Alohas charge director is not added to the liquid toner formulation, the charging current difference with a bare plate in Example 1 (Table 2) indicates that after first charging the toner layer positive and then reversing to negative, the positive current difference is 0.15  MU A and the reverse negative current difference is 0.14  MU A. This result indicates that when using cyclodextrin as the charge acceptance agent without Alohas charge director present the charging polarity can be reversed to about the same levels.
      <br/>
      In controls 1 and 2 of Table 2, in which 1 milligram and 2 milligrams of Alohas charge director per gram of toner solids were used, respectively, reversing the charging polarity from positive to negative provided small current difference values (0.04 and 0.05  MU A) which indicates that the toner layer resisted being charged to a negative polarity.
      <br/>
      It is believed that the soluble Alohas charge director captures negative charge, and that the captured negative charge immediately migrates to ground in the liquid phase leaving very little negative charge remaining on the toner particles in the solid phase.
    </p>
    <p num="85">
      When Alohas charge director is not added to the liquid toner formulation, the charging current difference with a bare plate in Example 1 (Table 2) indicates that after first charging the toner layer negative and then reversing to positive, the negative current difference is 0.18  MU A and the reverse positive current difference is 0.15  MU A. This result indicates that when using cyclodextrin as the charge acceptance agent without Alohas charge director present, the charging polarity can be easily reversed to about the same levels.
      <br/>
      In controls 1 and 2 of Table 2, in which 1 milligram and 2 milligrams of Alohas charge director per gram of toner solids were used respectively, reversing the charging polarity from negative to positive again provided small current difference values (0.04 and 0.05  MU A) which indicates that the toner layer resisted being charged to a positive polarity.

      The positive and negative toner layer charge-capturing propensity can be measured by several techniques.
      <br/>
      One of the most frequently used techniques involves first charging the toner layer with a scorotron for a fixed time, e.g. 2 seconds, and then monitoring the surface voltage decay as a function of time when charging is avoided or turned off.
      <br/>
      This is accomplished for both positively and negatively charged toner layers.

      <br/>
      Comparing the decay for the 5 second negative surface voltage in Example 1 versus the Control indicated that in Example 1 the 5 second negative surface voltage was -15 volts (50 percent improvement) whereas in the Control the 5 second negative surface voltage was only -10 volts.

      Reverse Charge Printing (RCP) development is initiated with a uniform uncharged toner layer.
      <br/>
      A first charging device charges toner to a first polarity, then a second charging device reverses the toner charge to a second polarity in an imagewise fashion.
      <br/>
      A biased Image Bearer (IB) subsequently separates the image from the background corresponding to the charge pattern in the toner layer.
      <br/>
      Thus, the toner image is formed on the IB and is ready to be transferred to final substrates.
      <br/>
      Since it is preferred that the first polarity of toner charge be the same as that of the P/R (photoreceptor imaging member) polarity, if a P/R is used, the toner layer may be first charged to a positive polarity when, for example, amorphous silicon is used as the photoreceptor and first charged to a negative polarity when an organic layered photoreceptor, reference U.S. Pat. No. 4,265,990, the disclosure of which is totally incorporated herein by reference, is used.
      <br/>
      The IB bias can be either the same as or opposite to that of the recharging device depending on the latent image polarity.
      <br/>
      Table 4 summarizes the four process options in RCP development.
      <br/>
      An objective of the bench print test for RCP is to identify the optimized process parameters for each ink by acquiring four development curves for all the process options.
      <br/>
      From each print test, the expemost desired outputs are minimum photoreceptor charge contrast, maximum ROD (ROD &gt;1.3) in solid area minimum ROD (background ROD &lt;0.15) in background area, and excellent solid area image quality. �Delta E=the square root of sum of squares of L*, a*, and b* less than 2 for both microscopic and macroscopic uniformity�.

      In the experiments, the imaging member 6 (P/R) had permanent image patterns thereupon.
      <br/>
      After the P/R was charged in the dark, the imaged area was discharged under room light exposure while the background area held charge.
      <br/>
      In this RCP bench experiment, a draw bar coating device was used to coat a thin uniform toner layer onto the N-mep photoreceptor using an ink containing 10 to 15 weight percent solids.
      <br/>
      Two scorotrons were used to charge and recharge the toner layer and a biased metal roll was wrapped with Rexham 6262 dielectric paper with the rough side contacting the toner layer to function as the cake conditioning device (CC).
      <br/>
      Another biased metal roll, wrapped with the smooth side of the Rexham 6262 paper, contacted the toner layer to function as the image bearer (IB).
      <br/>
      FIG. 2 illustrates the experimental steps for (+,-,+) RCP development.
      <br/>
      Charging and recharging of the N-mep photoreceptor was accomplished in the dark in order to hold the same amount of charge in every experiment.
      <br/>
      The cake conditioning and cake transfer to the image bearer were operated with a light on to permit the N-mep photoreceptor to fully discharge in order to create a strong electric field in the process nip without air breakdown, and to maintain the same experimental condition for very data point.
      <br/>
      After the toner layer was charged to a positive polarity, the N-mep photoreceptor was discharged by light and the cake conditioning roll was biased to the same polarity as that of the toner charging device.
      <br/>
      The cake conditioning roll was applied to the positively charged toner layer surface to squeeze out extra carrier fluid and to compress the toner cake to a higher solids content.
      <br/>
      The recharging step was also operated in the dark.
      <br/>
      The scorotron screen bias V2 and the electrical properties of the N-mep photoreceptor, which control the amount of negative charge delivered to the toner layer, together with the toner material properties, determine the toner charge reversal efficiency.
      <br/>
      In these experiments, the development curve was defined as the ROD of the fused toner on the IB as a function of V2.
      <br/>
      The bias on the IB 14 was set at 350 V.

    <heading>RCP PRINT TEST RESULTS</heading>
    <p num="133">
      The printing test results for the Controls and Examples are listed in Table 5.
      <br/>
      Control 1 is a typical liquid ink composition wherein the charge director, Alohas, in the liquid phase charges toner particles positively.
      <br/>
      When Control 1 ink was used in the RCP development process, the positive toner charge polarity could not be reversed to a negative one, so that the Control 1 ink prints out images with very high background (requirement: background ROD &lt;0.1) and much less image/background contrast (requirement: image/background ROD contrast &gt;1.2).
      <br/>
      Control 2 is another typical liquid ink.
      <br/>
      With a high concentration of HBr Quat 93K charge director, the toner particles in the Control 2 ink acquire a higher negative charging level.
      <br/>
      The Control 2 ink prints high-density images (requirement: image ROD &gt;1.2) in a traditional liquid immersion development process, however, in a RCP development process, the Control 2 ink prints background extensively (ROD=0.38, which is too large versus the required ROD &lt;0.15).
      <br/>
      The high charge director concentration (5 milligrams of charge director per gram of toner solids) renders it more difficult to reverse toner polarity.
      <br/>
      The inability to reverse toner charge polarity results in low-efficiency toner cake reclaim following the development and charge erase steps.
      <br/>
      Example 1 (with Alohas as the charge acceptance agent) of the RCP ink composition indicated significant background improvement since, for example, without a charge director in the ink, the charge on the toner particles could be reversed.

      Example 2, as a RCP ink composition, indicated that without Alohas in the particle phase as charge acceptor, the image contrast was not as large as in Examples 1 and 3, and the background was not as clean.

      This results indicated that the Alohas Charge Acceptor (CA) enhanced the charge-accepting efficiency of the toner particles.

      With further reference to Table 5 and to further understand the effect of the charge acceptor on RCP ink charging, further print tests were accomplished using the RCP process to develop toners of Example 2 (no charge acceptor) and Example 3 (0.9 percent charge acceptor).
      <br/>
      The results in Example 3 indicated that the RCP liquid developer or ink containing 0.9 percent resin-bound Alohas charge acceptor provided a much higher image density (image ROD &gt;1.25) and cleaner background (background ROD &lt;0.15) when the toner layer was first charged negatively and then recharged positively in an imagewise manner using the RCP process.
