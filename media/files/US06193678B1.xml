    <heading>BACKGROUND ART</heading>
    <p num="2">
      Most people have spots or locations on the body that benefit most from massaging and the application of heat.
      <br/>
      Although individuals have these spots it is often difficult to have massaging vibrations and/or heat applied to these spots with conventional massaging devices and heating pads.
      <br/>
      It would be a benefit, therefore, to have a massaging system that included a mechanism for allowing a user to position vibrating and heating units onto the body at user selected locations and to hold the vibrating and heating units in place.
      <br/>
      It would be a further benefit if the vibrating units and heating units could be repositioned as required for more than one user.
    </p>

    </p>
    <p num="10">
      Vest unit 12 is of conventional sewn fabric construction and has an interior surface 28 entirely covered with hook and pile fastener material.
      <br/>
      Two of the four user-adjustable, massaging and heat unit compression bands 14a,14b are stitched to the exterior of the torso covering area of vest unit 12.
      <br/>
      The remaining two user-adjustable, massaging and heat unit compression bands 14c,14d are stitched to the shoulder covering areas of the exterior of vest unit 12.
      <br/>
      Each of the four user-adjustable, massaging and heat unit compression bands 14a-d is adjustable in length with a buckle assembly 30.
    </p>
    <p num="11">
      Heating pad unit 16 is a conventional resistance element heating pad having a heating pad connecting jack 32, hook and pile fastener strips 34 on a first exterior surface 36, and a vibration unit hook and pile fastener attaching section 38 (FIG. 2) provided on a second exterior surface 40 (FIG. 2).
      <br/>
      Hook and pile fastener strips 34 are companionately attachable with the hook and pile covered interior surface 28 of vest unit 12.
      <br/>
      Vibration unit hook and pile fastener attaching section 38 is the same hook and pile material as hook and pile covered interior surface 28 of vest unit 12.
    </p>
    <p num="12">
      Each of the five identical vibration units 18 has a conventional electric motor vibration element housed within a cylindrical housing 44, a number of hook and pile fastener strips 46 on the exterior of housing 44, and a vibration unit connecting jack 48.
      <br/>
      Hook and pile fastener strips 46 are companionately attachable to the hook and pile covered interior surface 28 of vest unit 12 and vibration unit hook and pile fastener attaching section 38 (FIG. 2) on second exterior surface 40 (FIG. 2) of heating pad 16.
    </p>
    <p num="13">
      Vehicle cigarette lighter power adapter 20 includes an adapter control unit connecting jack 50.
      <br/>
      Battery pack 22 includes a battery pack control unit connecting jack 52.
      <br/>
      AC/DC converter unit 24 includes a converter unit control unit jack 54.
      <br/>
      Adapter control unit connecting jack 50, battery pack control unit connecting jack 52, and converter unit control unit jack 54 are each electrically and mechanically connectable to a control unit power input plug 56 that, with reference now to FIG. 3, supplies power to a control circuit 58 housed within a control housing 60 (FIG. 1).
      <br/>
      Control circuit 58 is a conventional massager controller circuit that is in electrical connection with a serial mode selector momentary contact switch 62, a continuous mode selector momentary contact switch 64, a back-and-forth mode selector momentary contact switch 66, a vibration speed variable position control switch 68, a two-position heating pad on/off switch 70, a heating pad heat intensity variable position heat control switch 72, and a wiring harness, generally designated 74 (FIG. 1) including a cable 75 (FIG. 1) in connection between control circuit 58 and five vibration unit connecting plugs 76a-e and a heating pad connecting plug 78.
      <br/>
      Control circuit 58 is programmed such that: a) depressing serial mode selector momentary contact switch 62 causes control circuit 58 to serially energize vibration unit connecting plugs 76a-e one at a time and repeat until either continuous mode selector momentary contact switch 64 or back-and-forth mode selector momentary contact switch 66 is depressed; b) depressing continuous mode selector momentary contact switch 66 causes control circuit 58 to energize vibration unit connecting plugs 76a-e all at the same time until either serial mode selector momentary contact switch 62 or back-and-forth mode selector momentary contact switch 66 is depressed; and c) depressing back-and-forth mode selector momentary contact switch 68 causes control circuit 58 to serially energize vibration unit connecting plugs 76a-e in a first direction one at a time from 76a to 76e then reversing to a second direction to serially energize vibration unit connecting plugs 76a-e one at a time in the second direction from 76e to 76a and then repeating until either serial mode selector momentary contact switch 62 or continuous mode selector momentary contact switch 64 is depressed.
    </p>
    <p num="14">
      With reference back to FIG. 2, prior to use, the user positions vibration units 18 and heating pad 16 at desired location on interior 28 of vest unit 12.
      <br/>
      Vest unit 12 is then donned and, referring to FIG. 1, user-adjustable, massaging and heat unit compression bands 14a-d adjusted as desired.
      <br/>
      The user can then select the operating mode, vibration speed and heat intensity using control unit 26.
