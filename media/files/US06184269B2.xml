    <heading>TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
    <p num="1">
      This invention pertains to moldable, polyethylene-based intumescent flame retardant materials (PE FRIMs).
      <br/>
      More specifically, this invention pertains to such moldable, thermoplastic elastomer, intumescent compositions containing high density polyethylene, chlorinated polyethylene and a relatively small amount of a relatively high molecular weight silphenylene siloxane elastomer.
    </p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">
      U.S. Pat. No. 5,834,535 describes a family of compositions in accordance with its title, "Moldable Intumescent Polyethylene and Chlorinated Polyethylene Compositions." These compositions are readily moldable by a variety of polymer molding practices into articles that have good physical strength.
      <br/>
      Moreover, the molded bodies have an additional property of serving as a heat and fire barrier.
      <br/>
      Upon exposure to a flame, they initially burn but do not melt and drip.
      <br/>
      Instead, they form a relatively strong foamed barrier of carbonized char and inorganic ceramic-like material.
      <br/>
      In some embodiments of these high density polyethylene (HDPE) and chlorinated polyethylene (CPE) compositions, a silicone elastomer (specifically, an organosiloxane) is used in addition to, or as a replacement for, some of the CPE.
      <br/>
      In many formulations the siloxane polymer improved the processibility of the material by reducing the mixing torque requirement.
      <br/>
      Further, in the molded product the polysiloxane reduced smoke evolution.
    </p>
    <p num="3">It is an object of this invention to provide a family of polyethylene and chlorinated polyethylene-based intumescent flame retardant materials containing silphenylene-siloxane elastomers for improved intumescence properties and improved processing properties.</p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="4">
      In accordance with this invention, certain high molecular weight silphenylene siloxane elastomers are used in combination with thermoplastic high density polyethylene, chlorinated polyethylene elastomer and suitable specified additives to form moldable blends that yield intumescent molded products.
      <br/>
      Such molded mixtures of HDPE, CPE and silphenylene siloxane elastomer form a thermoplastic elastomer that has high temperature resistance and produces a good foamed char barrier with little smoke when exposed to a flame and burned.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      Thermoplastic elastomers are a family of materials that have the properties of elastomers but can be processed as plastics.
      <br/>
      Being elastomeric, they have the desirable properties of flexibility, impact resistance, energy and shock absorption, and sound and vibration reduction.
      <br/>
      They can be formed by compression molding, injection molding, extrusion, vacuum forming and blow molding.
      <br/>
      Thermoplastic elastomers are recyclable, and in plant scrap generated during processing can be chopped up and used again to make parts.
      <br/>
      If such material can be made intumescent, then a convenient form of fire protection is available that can be introduced in vehicles on the assembly line.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      The present invention teaches intumescent thermoplastic elastomer compositions that can be molded into automotive parts.
      <br/>
      The moldings are very effective as a heat and fire barrier.
      <br/>
      Upon burning, these materials will not melt and drip but will form a relatively strong foamed barrier of char and inorganic ceramic-like material.
      <br/>
      The intumescent material could be used to replace existing plastic parts in cars or as a cover or shield to protect other plastic parts.
      <br/>
      The material is based on high density polyethylene as the hard phase of thermoplastic elastomer and chlorinated polyethylene and a specified silphenylene siloxane silicone rubber as the soft phase.
      <br/>
      Properties of compression molded and injection molded parts will be presented.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      Moreover, moldings produced from the compositions suitably have at least certain minimal physical properties such as a tensile strength (for injection moldings) of 0.5 MPa (72 psi) and an elongation at break of at least six percent at normal room temperature (ASTM D412).
      <br/>
      Such properties give moldings sufficient strength and durability so as to be useful in architectural applications, automotive applications, marine applications or the like.
      <br/>
      In addition to being formable and having useful physical properties for such applications, the moldings also have "intumescence efficiency." When exposed to elevated temperatures, the intumescent additives react or decompose to convert the molded plastic body to a residual insulating foam-like structure that is resistant to burning and insulates the back side of the molding from the high temperatures of the combustion flame.
    </p>
    <p num="8">Suitable constituents of the subject intumescent thermoplastic elastomer molding compositions comprise:</p>
    <p num="9">
      1.
      <br/>
      Resin Matrix
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      A high density polyethylene resin is mixed with a chlorinated polyethylene elastomer and silphenylene siloxane elastomer in proportion to obtain desired physical properties in a molded part.
      <br/>
      Suitable examples of HDPE and CPE are, of course, well known.
      <br/>
      However, the selection of the subject silicone constituent requires some explanation.
    </p>
    <p num="11">
      Silphenylene siloxane elastomeric polymers based, for example, on 1,4-phenylene-hexamethyltrisiloxanyl monomer or 1,4-phenylene-1,1,3,5,5-pentamethyl-3-vinyltrisiloxanyl monomer are suitable provided that the polymers are of sufficient molecular weight to provide the desired physical and intumescence properties to the molded composition.
      <br/>
      For example, Mn (i.e., number average molecular weight) values of 64,000 for poly(1,4-phenylene-hexamethyltrisiloxanyl) and of 109,000 for poly(1,4-phenylene-1,1,3,5,5-pentamethyl-3-vinyltrisiloxanyl) yield suitable elastomers.
      <br/>
      A further characteristic of the subject silicones is that each monomer moiety contains a silphenyl and a siloxane group.
      <br/>
      The silphenyl group has two silicon atoms that in the above examples each have two attached methyl groups.
      <br/>
      One of these methyl groups can be replaced with a phenyl group.
      <br/>
      Any of the four methyl groups can be replaced with another alkyl group such as ethyl, propyl, isopropyl group or fluorinated analogs of these groups.
      <br/>
      As illustrated, the siloxane group has a single silicon atom with two methyl groups or a methyl group and a vinyl group.
      <br/>
      The methyl groups on the siloxane portion of the monomer can be replaced with other alkyl groups such as ethyl, propyl, isopropyl group or fluorinated analogs of these groups.
      <br/>
      One of the siloxane methyl groups can also be replaced with a phenyl group.
    </p>
    <p num="12">A liquid chlorowax (e.g., Paroil 145) is suitably used as a plasticizer when needed to impart flexibility to the resin matrix at low temperatures.</p>
    <p num="13">2. Thermal and Oxidation Stabilizers</p>
    <p num="14">
      Although any suitably compatible stabilizer can be used with HDPE, CPE and the subject silicone for protection against heat and oxygen, it is found that a system consisting of distearylthiodipropionate (DSTDP) and a butylated reaction product of p-cresol and dicyclopentadiene (Wingstay L) is very effective as an antioxidant.
      <br/>
      In addition to such antioxidant, MgO is used in the formulation to absorb evolved HCL produced during aging of chlorinated polyethylene and thus acts as an effective dehydrochlorination stabilizer.
    </p>
    <p num="15">3. Gas-Generating Foaming Agents</p>
    <p num="16">
      These agents are used in the subject compositions to generate gases in order to foam the polymeric matrix before it is consumed by the fire.
      <br/>
      The residue that remains after burning of most organic material will have a porous char structure and will thus be an effective thermal barrier.
      <br/>
      Two preferred gas-generating agents used in this invention are ammonium dihydrogen phosphate, NH4 H2 PO4, and ammonium polyphosphate, approx. (NH4 PO3)n, which emit ammonia when heated.
      <br/>
      Hydrated alumina and hydrated magnesia are also preferred because they emit water vapor when heated.
      <br/>
      The ammonium dihydrogen phosphate will also form phosphoric acid which will act as a catalyst to encourage char formation from polyhydroxy compounds.
    </p>
    <p num="17">4. Char Formers</p>
    <p num="18">
      Any suitable compatible starch or other carbohydrate may be used in the moldable compositions to form heavy char when exposed to fire.
      <br/>
      Polyhydric alcohols also perform the same function.
      <br/>
      A preferred char former is monopentaerythritol or dipentaerythritol.
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      5. In appropriate formulations, other ingredients are beneficially added to intumescent moldable material.
      <br/>
      A first is a filler consisting of glass fibers, mica particles and/or titanium oxide powder.
      <br/>
      These fillers help strengthen the molding and develop a strong structure of the material after intumescing.
      <br/>
      A second ingredient is antimony oxide which imparts fire retardancy to the intumescent material and hence slows down the burning process.
      <br/>
      This is helpful in decreasing heat release rate during fire and increasing the char content.
    </p>
    <p num="20">Further objects and advantages of the invention will be more apparent from a detailed description thereof which follows.</p>
    <heading>DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
    <p num="21">
      This invention provides intumescent thermoplastic molding compositions that can be blow molded, injection molded, compression molded or otherwise suitably molded and shaped to a desired geometry or configuration by thermal processes.
      <br/>
      In some applications, the molded part may be intended to serve primarily as a heat or fire barrier.
      <br/>
      More often, it will also serve another functional purpose and serve incidentally as a heat or fire barrier.
      <br/>
      In either case, the invention provides a moldable material mixture that can be formed into a molded product in a suitable manufacturing facility and transported for efficient handling at an automobile assembly line or at a construction site or the like.
      <br/>
      Thus, the subject composition facilitates efficient manufacture and assembly and provides robust physical and fire-resistant properties in use.

      The polyethylene constituent of the subject compositions has a density in the range of 0.940 to 0.970 g/cm3. Such materials are produced using suitable known catalysts at a relatively low pressure of ethylene.
      <br/>
      Such high density polyethylenes are available with molecular weight ranging from about 10,000 (usually waxes) to ultra high molecular weight HDPE (UHMW-HDPE) of several millions.
      <br/>
      Wide variation of branching and density are also available.
    </p>
    <p num="25">
      Many grades of high density polyethylene (HDPE) can be used in this invention depending on the application and the method of processing.
      <br/>
      High molecular weight/high melt viscosity grades are used for blow molding applications.
      <br/>
      Low melt viscosity grades are preferred for injection molding.
      <br/>
      Extrusion is normally performed using intermediate melt viscosities.

    <p num="26">Chlorinated polyethylene (CPE), suitably with about 36% to 42% by weight chlorine, is preferably combined with HDPE and the subject silphenylene siloxane elastomer in accordance with the invention in the above proportions to produce suitable moldable intumescent thermoplastic elastomer grades with varying degrees of hardness.</p>
    <p num="27">The specification of suitable silphenylene siloxane elastomers and the synthesis of exemplary elastomers is provided in detail below in this specification.</p>

      Chlorowax is used to improve low temperature properties of the intumescent polyethylene/chlorinated polyethylene/silicone thermoplastic elastomer mixture.
      <br/>
      An added advantage of chlorowax is that it contributes to the char formation during burning of the intumescent material.

      Silphenylene siloxane elastomers have been synthesized previously using the chlorosilane or the ureidosilane routes.
      <br/>
      The chlorosilane-silanol condensation reaction will generate HCl which can catalyze the self-condensation of the silanol monomer, thus preventing the formation of exactly alternating polymer structures.
      <br/>
      Although the ureidosilane approach can produce alternating silphenylene siloxane elastomers, the reaction times are very long and broad molecular weight distributions are common.
      <br/>
      For these reasons, it is preferred to use the disilanol diaminosilane polycondensation route in which the byproduct amine is generated as a gas providing a clean reaction.
      <br/>
      The reaction was carried out in toluene at 110 (degree)  C. under nitrogen atmosphere.

      It is found that suitable silphenylene siloxane elastomeric polymers based, for example, on 1,4-phenylene-hexamethyltrisiloxanyl monomer or 1,4-phenylene-1,1,3,5,5-pentamethyl-3-vinyltrisiloxanyl monomer provide useful intumescence properties to polyethylene and chlorinated polyethylene-based thermoplastic elastomer formulations as specified in Table 1.
      <br/>
      They also facilitate the processing of such formulations.
      <br/>
      Such polymers are characterized by average molecular weight values, Mw, in the range of about 30,000 to 800,000.
      <br/>
      They are true elastomers.
    </p>
    <p num="80">The elastomers E1, poly(1,4-phenylene-hexamethyltrisiloxanyl) and E2, poly(1,4-phenylene-1,1,3,5,5-pentamethyl-3-vinyltrisiloxanyl) with their respective Mw values of 150,000 for E1 and 480,000 for E2 represent preferred silicone elastomers for use in the subject PE FRIMs.</p>
    <p num="81">
      A further characteristic of the subject silicones is that each monomer moiety contains a silphenyl and a siloxane group.
      <br/>
      The silphenyl group is viewed as having two silicon atoms with four R groups attached.
      <br/>
      One R may be a phenyl group.
      <br/>
      Any or all of the Rs may be an alkyl group selected from the group consisting of methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl or fluorinated analogs of these groups.
      <br/>
      The siloxane group has two R groups that were illustrated as either two methyl groups or as a methyl group and a vinyl group.
      <br/>
      The one or two methyl groups on the siloxane portion of the monomer can be replaced with one phenyl or other alkyl groups such as ethyl, propyl, isopropyl or fluorinated analogs of these groups.
