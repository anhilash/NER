    <heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">This invention relates to articles of luggage in the form of suitcases or carrying cases, as commonly used by airlines' passengers or other travelers for the transportation of clothing and personal effects.</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="3">Commonly known wheeled carrying cases include a substantially rigid frame providing side walls of the case, and front and rear major walls that are supported by the frame, at least one of the major walls including a zippered attachment to adjacent ones of the side walls.</p>
    <p num="4">Wheeled carrying cases are also well known in the art that include a handle that can be telescopically extended, or retracted into, the body of the case at one of the side walls thereof, and, wheels provided at the opposite side wall of the case that can roll over a ground surface, such as the floor of an airport terminal, or, a passenger aisle of an aircraft.</p>
    <p num="5">While this arrangement is admirable for relatively small articles of luggage, it poses a problem in the event that a large and heavily loaded article of luggage is involved.</p>
    <p num="6">
      While such large and heavy articles of luggage easily can be stored in the luggage compartment of an automobile or other form of conveyance, when it is necessary to transport the article of luggage to some other location, a problem arises in providing adequate stability for the article of luggage when being wheeled on a ground surface, this being due to the fact that during wheeling of the article of luggage, the article of luggage must be held in an inclined position.
      <br/>
      In that position, the center of gravity of the case is displaced laterally of the ground engaging wheels, is located between the handle and the ground engaging wheels.
    </p>
    <p num="7">This can constitute a source of discomfort to the person towing the article of luggage, who is then required to exert sufficient force to support the handle, which at the time the article of luggage is positioned in the inclined position relative to the vertical for towing, can exert a considerable downwards force on the handle, that downwards force being resisted by the grasp of the user's hand.</p>
    <p num="8">Further, depending on the physical height of the person towing the article of luggage, the condition exists that a relatively shorter person will be subjected to a much greater force, due to the greater inclination relative to the vertical of the article of luggage and the fixed position of the handle relative to the article of luggage, than would be a taller person, who conveniently can hold the article of luggage at a lesser angle of inclination relative to the vertical during towing of the article of luggage.</p>
    <p num="9">
      As will be appreciated, the wheels on which the article of luggage is towed act as a fulcrum about which the article of luggage angles relative to the vertical when moved from the vertical position to the inclined towing position.
      <br/>
      Further, the greater the angle of inclination relative to the vertical, the greater becomes the spacing of the center of gravity relative to the towing wheels providing the fulcrum, the center of gravity then being displaced laterally of the vertical and laterally of the axis of the ground engaging wheels.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      One manner of reducing this problem would be for the user to have packaged all heavy articles at the bottom of the article of luggage and in proximity to the towing wheels, the remainder of the case being occupied by relatively light weight articles.
      <br/>
      This, however, does not normally occur during the packaging of the article of luggage by the user.
      <br/>
      If relatively heavy articles are packaged in that end of the article of the luggage remote from the towing wheels, then, the center of gravity of the packaged article of luggage becomes even more displaced relative to the vertical plane including the axes of the towing wheels.
    </p>
    <p num="11">If the handle of the case should slip out of the grasp of the user's hand, then, the only possible situation is that the article of luggage, and its contained articles will crash downwardly onto the supporting ground surface, this resulting in possible damage to the articles stored within the article of luggage.</p>
    <p num="12">
      Another problem often encountered by travelers is having to deal with multiple articles of luggage.
      <br/>
      Even if both have wheels, it is very cumbersome to attempt to tow (or push) more than one article of luggage at a time.
      <br/>
      As well, the ability to stack one article of luggage upon another article of luggage is restricted and also adds significant weight along the extent of the inclined handle of the towed article of luggage.
    </p>
    <p num="13">For this reason, despite the generally recognized advantages of wheeled luggage, there are significant unresolved problems in use which the simple addition of wheels and a handle do not solve.</p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="14">
      The present invention proceeds from the known wheeled article of luggage of the type including a handle extendable, or some other towing implement, from one side wall of the article of luggage and towing wheels provided at an opposite side wall of the article of luggage, and overcomes the problems of the prior art by providing wheels on one of the major front or back walls of the article of luggage that will permit the article of luggage to be towed over a ground engaging surface with the wheeled major wall of the article of luggage in proximity to the ground surface, thus to relieve the user of any forces exerted on the user's hands due to angling of the article of luggage relative to the vertical as is common in prior art constructions.
      <br/>
      In addition, the article of luggage can readily service as a platform upon which additional articles of luggage or other items can be stacked and conveniently and easily towed.
    </p>
    <p num="15">In one embodiment of the invention, the article of luggage is provided with ground engaging wheels on a major wall of the article of luggage, and an extendable handle of the article of luggage, which instead of being arranged in fixed telescoping relation with the article of luggage and extendable or retractable parallel to the plane of the major walls of the article of luggage, comprises a towing member that is attached to the article of luggage, and which can be extended therefrom into a position convenient for use in towing of the article of luggage.</p>
    <p num="16">For example, the towing member can be a flexible strap that can be readily stored within a pocket located on the outer surface of the article of luggage, and which can be withdrawn from that pocket and employed in the manner of a leash for towing the article of luggage at the time the article of luggage has been laid on its wheeled major wall.</p>
    <p num="17">
      In the alternative, a telescoping handle with a gripping handlebar can be hinged to the article of luggage at the end remote from the handlebar, and which is preferably releasably secured to the article of luggage in the vicinity of the handlebar of the telescoping handle.
      <br/>
      In this instance, prior to placing the article of luggage on its wheeled major wall, the handle is first released from its attachment to the article of luggage in the vicinity of the handlebar, the telescopic handle is then swung angularly about its pivot at the end of the handle remote from the handlebar, such that it extends beyond the end of the article of luggage.
      <br/>
      The article of luggage can then be laid on its wheeled major wall.
      <br/>
      If desired a side mounted carrying handle can be included which permits customary carrying and as well conveniently can be employed for luggage to its operative towing orientation.
    </p>
    <p num="18">Yet another alternative is the inclusion of the telescoping handle which can be extended from the article of luggage a distance sufficient to expose hinges in the telescoping handle, those hinges, when exposed, permitting the handle to be raised and lowered relative to the article of luggage, and thus permit towing of the article of luggage with comfort by a person of any height.</p>
    <p num="19">
      The telescoping handle in this alternative may be lockable at various degrees of extension from the case to accommodate different persons of varying heights.
      <br/>
      At less than full extension of the telescoping handle, however, the case is only towable in an inclined attitude relative to the ground surface as was previously described with respect to the towing of the case on the towing wheels 16.
      <br/>
      In addition, the hinge may be of a socket type restricting rotation of the handle substantially within two planes, one plane being substantially perpendicular to the wheeled major wall of the article of luggage when the article of luggage is laid on its major wall and the other plane having an inclination to the horizontal substantially the same as the inclination of the handle to the horizontal.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, the hinge may be of a socket type restricting rotation substantially within the single plane substantially perpendicular to the wheeled major wall of the article of luggage.
    </p>
    <p num="20">
      Preferably the wheeled major wall of the article of luggage is provided with one pair of towing wheels that are rotatable about a common fixed axis, and at least one caster wheel that can rotate randomly about a first axis extending perpendicular to the backwall of the article of luggage, and a second axis extending parallel to the backwall of the article of luggage.
      <br/>
      Preferably two such caster wheels are provided, one at each corner of the substantially rectangular major wall of the article of luggage.
    </p>
    <p num="21">
      The provision of four wheels to support the article of luggage on its major wall is adequate in the event that the major wall of the article of luggage is substantially rigid.
      <br/>
      If, however, and as is often the case, the major wall of the article of luggage includes a sheet of a flexible material, such as leather, synthetic leather, or a coated woven fabric, there could then be a tendency of the major wall of the article of luggage to bulge outwardly, particularly when the major wall of the article of luggage is moved into proximity with the supporting ground surface.
      <br/>
      This can result in abrasion or other damage at the center of the major wall.
    </p>
    <p num="22">To overcome this problem in what is generally referred to as soft-sided luggage, a roller ball type caster is preferably located at the center of the major wall of the article of luggage that is operative to support the center of the major wall spaced from the engaged ground surface.</p>
    <p num="23">The ground-engaging roller ball can be supported within the article of luggage by a suitable frame member that extends parallel to the major wall of the article of luggage, and which, preferably, for lightness in weight, is in the form of an X-frame that provides a support for the roller ball at the intersection of the arms of the X-frame, and which also provides supports at the ends of the arms of the X-frame for the roller wheels or casters.</p>
    <p num="24">Access to the interior of the article of luggage can be provided at that wall of the article of luggage that is opposite to the wheeled major wall, or, the wheeled major wall can be detachably attached to the side walls of the case.</p>
    <p num="25">At least some of the wheels on the major wall of the article of luggage may be designed such that they retract beneath the surface of the major wall for ease of storage of the luggage when not being transported.</p>
    <p num="26">In addition, not only can the article of luggage be placed on a ground surface with the wheeled major wall of the article of luggage presented to the ground surface in preparation for towing of the article of luggage across the ground engaging surface, but also, the article of luggage, which is already loaded with its contents, can be employed as a wheeled pallet usable in the transportation of further articles of luggage, such as carry-on cases, hand baggage, carrier bags, or any other items needing transport by the user.</p>

    <heading>DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
    <p num="28">In each of the embodiments now to be described, it is assumed that in its novel usage described herein the carrying case will be supported on a ground surface 10, such as a side walk, lobby floor, or main hall of an aircraft terminal building or the like.</p>
    <p num="29">
      In FIG. 1, the carrying case of the present invention is shown in a vertical position in which ground-engaging feet 12 of the carrying case 14 are resting on the ground surface 10.
      <br/>
      If desirable, additional support for the carrying case 14 can be provided by towing wheels 16, as shown in FIG. 3, that are rotatable about a fixed axis, that axis lying in or closely parallel to a plane that includes a major wall of the carrying case, and also the direction of sliding of a handle bar 18 of a telescopic handle having telescopically retractable and extendable legs 20.
    </p>
    <p num="30">
      As so far described, the carrying case includes those elements that are commonly known in conventional wheeled carrying cases.
      <br/>
      The user firstly extends the handle bar 18 from the body of the carrying case, and then employs the handle to angle the carrying case from its initial vertical orientation into an inclined position in which it is supported for towing over the ground surface on ground engaging towing wheels 16 as illustrated in FIG. 3.
    </p>
    <p num="31">When the case is fulcrumed about the towing wheels 16 into an inclined attitude relative to the ground surface, the center of gravity of the case moves relative to the axis of the ground wheels, and, depending upon the amount of inclination of the case relative to the vertical, will position itself on the opposite side of a vertical plane that includes the common axis of the ground engaging wheels 16.</p>
    <p num="32">
      It is impossible to predict exactly where the actual center of gravity of the carrying case will be positioned, as this will be entirely dependent upon the weight of the contents of the carrying case and the positioning of the contents within the carrying case.
      <br/>
      Depending upon the extent to which the carrying case is angled relative to the vertical, the center of gravity of the carrying case will have passed over a vertical plane including the axis of rotation of the ground engaging towing wheels 16, and, dependent on the amount of inclination of the carrying case relative to the vertical will be spaced from the vertical plane including the axis of rotation of the respective towing wheels 16.
    </p>
    <p num="33">A taller person will have the tendency to move the carrying case to a relatively small inclination relative to the said vertical plane, while a person of lesser height will have angled the carrying case at a greater angle to the said vertical plane, in which event the center of gravity will have moved further away from the said vertical plane, and, the downwards force exerted on the handlebar 18 will have been considerably increased.</p>
    <p num="34">If the user at that time loses or releases his or her grasp on the handlebar 18, then, the carrying case will crash onto the ground engagable surface, with possible damage to the stored contents of the carrying case.</p>
    <p num="35">Where size, weight and the need for transporting additional items are issues, the present invention teaches the addition or substitution of additional ground-engagable wheels 22 and 24 mounted on one of the walls of the carrying case.</p>
    <p num="36">
      As shown in FIGS. 1 and 2, the wheels 22 and 24 are mounted on a front wall 26 of the case.
      <br/>
      As well, the handlebar 18 and its supporting telescopic legs 20 are mounted externally of the carrying case on the opposed back wall 28 of the case, with the legs 20 hinged in any convenient manner such as shown at 30, such that the entire handlebar and telescopic leg assembly is swingable, as illustrated in FIG. 2, relative to the body of the carrying case 14 from a position in which it overlies the back wall 28, to a position in which it extends at an angle to the back wall 28.
      <br/>
      Conveniently, the hinged attachment 30 of the handlebar and telescopic leg assembly 20 can be located adjacent an end wall 32 of the carrying case and the back wall 28 can be provided with a removable zippered closure 34, to enable loading of the articles to be carried within the carrying case.
    </p>
    <p num="37">Conveniently, the carrying case can be provided with a side handle 36, that in addition to being employed for hand carrying or manipulation of the case, also can be employed for reorienting the carrying case into a position in which the wheels 22 and 24 are engaged with the supporting ground surface.</p>
    <p num="38">
      Referring again to the embodiment of FIG. 1, when the handlebar 18 and its supporting telescopic legs 20 are in the retracted position, one or multiple of handle 36 can then be employed to tilt the carrying case on to the ground engaging feet 12 to lower the front wall 26 into engagement with the supporting ground surface 10.
      <br/>
      Thereafter, a release button 38 associated with the handlebar 18 and its supporting telescopic legs 20 is actuated to release the handlebar 18 from its releasable engagement with the end wall 40 of the carrying case.
      <br/>
      As shown in FIG. 2, the handle 18 is then swung upwardly and over the then upwardly presented back wall 28 of the carrying case, in order to position the handlebar in an orientation ready for towing of the carrying case over the ground surface 10, as is accommodated by the ground engaging wheels 22 and 24.
    </p>
    <p num="39">
      Conveniently, the front wall 26 of the carrying case 40 can be made of a flexible material, such as is common in the art, or alternatively, the entire back wall can be made of a structurally rigid material such as molded plastic, metal or a plywood substrate can be used to support the flexible outer covering material.
      <br/>
      If a flexible material is used for the formation of the back wall 26, then a probability exists that the back wall will bulge outwardly at the time the case is positioned horizontally for towing.
    </p>
    <p num="40">
      If the outward bowing of the front wall 26 is sufficient to cause the center of the front wall to contact the ground surface 10, the center of the front wall 26 might be abraded or otherwise damaged during towing.
      <br/>
      To avoid this from happening, a center caster 40 may be employed, preferably, in the form of an omni-directionally rotatable ball which is mounted on the front wall 26 at the center of the front wall 26.
    </p>
    <p num="41">
      As shown in FIG. 1A, the center caster 40 is of lesser height than the height of the ground engaging wheels 22 and 24 as shown by vertical line 43.
      <br/>
      At maximum height, a center caster 41 (shown in dotted lines) can be of equal height to the height of the ground engaging wheels 22 and 24.
    </p>
    <p num="42">Further, if the front wall 26 is formed of a flexible material, it is also preferably that a frame be incorporated into the luggage, with the frame providing a support for the ground engaging wheels 22 and 24, and also for the center caster 40.</p>
    <p num="43">Conveniently, and to reduce the weight of the carrying case, the frame supporting the wheels 22 and 24 and also the center caster 40 can be in the form of an X-frame, as indicated in dotted lines 42 in FIG. 1 of the drawings.</p>
    <p num="44">
      In the event that one of the sets of ground engaging wheels 22 and 24, for example wheels 22, are rotatable about fixed axes, then, the other wheels 24 can be in the form of casters, that can angle relative to the wheels 22.
      <br/>
      The combination of wheels rotatable about a fixed axis and caster wheels will allow for omni-directional movement of the carrying case over the ground surface 10 under the control of the handlebar and its supporting telescopic legs 20.
    </p>
    <p num="45">In lieu of telescoping legs 20, the legs 20 can be tubes of fixed length that are hinged at their ends opposite the handlebar 18 to the end wall 32 of the case by the hinges 30.</p>
    <p num="46">
      The structure described with respect to FIGS. 1 and 2 results in the handlebar 18 and its supporting legs 20 being positioned exteriorly of the carrying case 14.
      <br/>
      While this has the advantage of providing the maximum internal capacity of the carrying case, internal mounting is also possible, such as illustrated in FIGS. 3 and 4.
    </p>
    <p num="47">
      In FIGS. 3 and 4, the handlebar 18 and its associated telescopic legs, instead of being positioned adjacent the front wall 26 of the carrying case are positioned internally of the carrying case and adjacent the back wall 28.
      <br/>
      Also as illustrated, the rigid handlebar and leg arrangement can be supplemented, or indeed eliminated and replaced by a towing strap 44 which can be stored when not needed in a pocket 46 secured to a side wall of the carrying case.
    </p>
    <p num="48">
      The positioning of the telescopically extendable legs 20 for them to be guided within the case and adjacent the back wall 28 of the case carries with it the requirement that the legs 20, when retracted, can only extend parallel to the back wall 28 of the case in the manner of the conventional carrying case.
      <br/>
      To permit upwards orientation of the handlebar relative to the ground surface 10, the respective legs 20 can be hingedly connected at 48 to the leg portions 50 that are slidable within the body of the case, and, which are held captive within the body of the case at the time the main handlebar 18 and its supporting legs 20 are extended from the case.
    </p>
    <p num="49">
      In FIGS. 6 to 13, the handlebar 18 and its supporting legs 20 are replaced by a linear member 52 comprised of a plurality of telescoping sections 54, 56 and a handgrip 58.
      <br/>
      The handle 60 shown in FIGS. 6 to 12 is shown in its fully retracted position within the carrying case 14 in FIG. 6, and the linear member 52 and its associated end section 50 are contained within a tubular member 62 located within the carrying case 14 and attached to the back wall 28.
      <br/>
      In this fully retracted position, the handle 60 is locked in place by a latch 64 pinned to the handgrip 58 at one end and seated in a groove 66 in a boss 68 which is integral with the tubular member 62 and is fixedly attached to the carrying case 14.
      <br/>
      The latch 64 is held firmly in groove 66 by the spring 74 which biases a first button 72 and by a spring 67 loaded second button 69 pinned to a lever arm 73 fitting between and contacting the boss 68 and the underside 75 of the handgrip 58.
      <br/>
      The linear member 52 passes through an aperture 70 in the boss 68.
      <br/>
      Pressing down 71 on the first button 72, which is located on the top of the handgrip 58 over the linear member 52, releases 77 the latch 64 from the groove 66, allowing a first telescoping section 56 to be extended to its full length.
    </p>
    <p num="50">
      Further extension of the linear member 52 is prevented by the lever arm 73 which extends far enough to obstruct the top of a wall of a second telescoping section 54 from extension, but not far enough to contact the first telescoping section 56.
      <br/>
      In this position where only the first telescoping section 56 is extended, the case 14 can only be carried in an attitude inclined from the vertical with respect to the supporting surface on its towing wheels 16.
    </p>
    <p num="51">
      To extend the second telescoping section 54, the second button 69 is depressed 76 with the result that the lever arm 73 is lifted 78.
      <br/>
      FIG. 11A shows an exemplary detail of an arrangement whereby the lever arm 73 can be lifted 78 when the second button 69 is depressed 76.
      <br/>
      When the second button 69 is depressed 76, the lever arm 73 is lifted 78 by the corner 65 of the boss 68.
      <br/>
      When the second button 69 is released, a torsion spring 67 surrounding the pin 79 connecting the second button 69 and the lever arm 73 acts to restore the lever arm 73 to a horizontal position.
    </p>
    <p num="52">
      FIG. 11B shows another exemplary detail of an arrangement whereby the lever arm 73 can be lifted 78 when the second button 69 is depressed 76.
      <br/>
      FIG. 11B shows the pin 79, which attaches the lever arm 73 to the second button 69, and the hole 81 in the second button 69 and the lever arm 73, through which hole 81 the pin 79 passes.
      <br/>
      The cams 83, 85 on the pin 79 and the hole 81, respectively, convert the downward motion of the second button 69 when depressed into rotational motion of the pin 79 counterclockwise, raising the lever arm 73 mounted on the pin 79, and convert the upward motion of the second button 69 when it is released after depression into clockwise rotation of the pin 79, lowering the lever arm 73 mounted on the pin 79.
      <br/>
      The pin 79 is fixed with respect to the lever arm 73 by a second pin 87 or other fixing means.
    </p>
    <p num="53">
      An alternative arrangement to that using the latch 64 is shown in FIG. 7A. A rod 78 is connected to the spring 74 beneath the first button 72.
      <br/>
      The rod 78 travels vertically down and up within the first telescoping section 56 as the first button 72 is depressed and released.
      <br/>
      The rod 78 is adapted to contact a tube 82 mounted in first telescoping section 56 near the free end of the rod 78.
      <br/>
      The tube 82 is loaded with a spring biased ball bearing 84.
      <br/>
      When the first button 72 is not depressed, the ball bearing 84 is seated in an aperture 86 in the second telescoping section 54 by the contact of the rod 78 with the tube 82, thus locking the first telescoping section 56 against vertical movement.
      <br/>
      When the first button 72 is depressed, the ball bearing 84 can be moved out of the aperture 86 since the rod 78 no longer contacts the tube 82, allowing vertical extension of the first telescoping section 56.
      <br/>
      A multiplicity of apertures 86 may be located in the second telescoping section 54 to allow multiple "locking points" for the first telescoping section 56 as it extends since the ball bearing 84, by virtue of its spring biasing, will become seated in each of the apertures 86 as the rod 78 contacting the tube 82 moves vertically upward along with the first telescoping section 56 in which the rod 78 is mounted.
      <br/>
      By depressing the first button 72 on each such occasion of locking, the ball bearing 84 will become unseated from the aperture 86 in which it is seated, allowing further extension of the first telescoping section 56.
      <br/>
      An alternative structure to that which is described in this paragraph is disclosed in our copending application Ser.
      <br/>
      No. 09/005,313, filed on Jan. 9, 1998, which is incorporated by reference in this application, especially on page 18, line 17 through page 19, line 20 and in FIGS. 7A, 7B, and 7D of that copending application.
    </p>
    <p num="54">
      The structure of the second button 69 is the same as shown in FIG. 7 and as described with reference thereto except for the elbow and rod arrangement 88 attached to the bottom flange 90 of the second button 69.
      <br/>
      The elbow and rod arrangement 88 carry a tube 92 loaded with a spring biased ball bearing 94.
      <br/>
      The rod 96 travels vertically down or up between the tubular member 62 and the second telescoping section 54 when the second button 69 is depressed or released, respectively.
      <br/>
      When the second telescoping section 54 is unextended, the ball bearing 94 is seated in one of the apertures 86 in the second telescoping section 54, adding its locking effect to that of the lever arm 73 previously described.
      <br/>
      Pressing the second button 69 after the first telescoping section 56 is fully extended will raise the lever arm 73 as previously described and will also unseat the ball bearing 94 from the aperture 86 in which it was located, thus allowing extension of the second telescoping section 54.
      <br/>
      Analogously to the possibility outlined above for the first telescoping section 56 in FIG. 7A, multiple "locking points" can be introduced at different lengths of extension of the second telescoping section 54 by a multiplicity of apertures 86 in and along the length of the second telescoping section 54.
      <br/>
      If such a multiplicity of apertures 86 is introduced in the second telescoping section 54, the ball bearing 94 will become seated in each of the apertures 86 as the second telescoping section 54 is extended, locking the section repeatedly.
      <br/>
      By depressing the second button 69 on each such occasion of locking, the ball bearing 94 will become unseated from the aperture 86 in which it is seated, allowing further extension of the second telescoping section 54.
      <br/>
      An alternative structure for producing multiple "locking points" at different lengths of extension of the second telescoping section 54 is disclosed in our copending application Ser.
      <br/>
      No. 09/005,313, filed on Jan. 9, 1998, especially in FIGS. 7A, 7C, and 7E of that copending application.
    </p>
    <p num="55">
      As can be deduced from the above description and the drawings, the same apertures 86 in the second telescoping section 54 can be used to seat both ball bearings 84, 94 and thus to serve as multiple "locking points" for both the first telescoping section 56 and the second telescoping section 54.
      <br/>
      The arrangement shown in FIGS. 7A to 7C allows as many degrees of lockable extension of the handle 60 as the number of apertures 86 which are provided in contradistinction to the arrangement shown in FIG. 7 which only allows one degree of lockable extension, namely, the condition existing when the first telescoping section 56 is fully extended, and the second telescoping section 54 is still unextended.
    </p>
    <p num="56">For either the arrangement of FIG. 7 or that of FIGS. 7A to 7C, when the second telescoping section 54 is fully extended, the associated end section 50 will be partially exposed on the outside of the case 14.</p>
    <p num="57">
      FIG. 13 shows the end section 50 connected to the second telescoping section 54 by a socket type hinge 98 restricting rotation 100, 102 of the handle to a plane substantially perpendicular to the back wall 28 of the carrying case 14 when the case 14 is laid on its back wall 28 on a supporting surface, and to a plane of substantially the same inclination to the horizontal as the inclination of the handle 60 also when the case 14 is laid on its back wall 28.
      <br/>
      The hinge 98, thus, allows extensive maneuverability of the handle 60 when the case 14 is laid on its back wall 28, without allowing rotation of the handle 60 about its longitudinal axis 104.
      <br/>
      This extensive maneuverablity of the handle 60 allows a person to guide the case 14 in substantially any direction including around curved paths of varying radii of curvature.
    </p>
    <p num="58">Alternatively, FIG. 15 shows the end section 50 connected to the second telescoping section 54 by socket type hinge 104 restricting rotation 100 of the handle 60 to a plane substantially perpendicular to the back wall 28 of the carrying case 14 when the case 14 is laid on its back wall 28 on a supporting surface.</p>
    <p num="59">At least one of the wheels 106 on the major wall 108 of the article of luggage 110 may be designed so that it retracts below the surface 112 of the major wall 108 of the luggage 110 from which it otherwise protrudes upon the desire of a user, (see FIGS. 16 and 17).</p>
    <p num="60">
      In the particular embodiment shown in FIG. 16, the at least one wheel 106 is held in a retracted position so that a bottom surface 114 of a housing 116 in which each wheel 106 is mounted is level with the surface 112 of the major wall 108 of the luggage 110 when an extendible handle 118 of the luggage 110 is in a fully retracted position.
      <br/>
      Each wheel 106 is held in a retracted position by a bar 120 with a tongue 122, the tongue 122 fitting into an aperture 124 in the housing 116.
      <br/>
      The tongue 122 and the aperture 124 restrain the housing 116 and the wheel 106 from being rotated outwardly from the luggage 110 by a spring-loaded hinge 126 which tends to rotate the attached housing 116 and mounted wheel 106 out of a well 128 in the luggage 110 into which the housing 116 and wheel 106 fit when retracted.
    </p>
    <p num="61">
      Each bar 120 is biased toward the aperture 124 by a spring 130 surrounding and extending along a portion of the length of the bar 120, the spring 130 being held in place by protrusions 132,133 from the major wall 108 of the luggage 112 and from the well 128, respectively, and by a flange 135 on the bar 120.
      <br/>
      A cable 134 is attached at a first end to each bar 130, the cable 134 extending through a guide tube 137 to an attachment at a second end to a U-shaped member 136.
      <br/>
      The U-shaped member 136 is in turn attached through a cable 139 to a pull ring 141 located within the luggage 10 in a position such that the grip 143 of the extendible handle 118 covers the pull ring 141 when the extendible handle 118 is fully retracted and, thus, makes the pull ring 141 inaccessible to a user.
      <br/>
      However, as soon as the extendible handle 118 is at least partially extended, the user can manually exert a tensile force 138 on the pull ring 141.
    </p>
    <p num="62">
      The tensile force 138 acts through the system of the cable 139, the U-shaped member 136, and the cables 134, to retract each bar 120 against each biasing spring 130 such that the tongue 122 no longer lies within the aperture 124.
      <br/>
      This retraction of the bar 120 and the tongue 122 sets the housing 116 and the attached wheel 106 free to rotate 140 under the impetus of the spring-biased hinge 126 until the housing 116 impacts and is held against the surface 112 of the major wall 108 of the luggage 10.
      <br/>
      In this position, the wheel 106 is available to contact a supporting surface to allow the luggage 110 to be propelled by the handle 118 such that its major wall 108 is parallel to the supporting surface.
      <br/>
      In contrast, the retracted position of the wheels 106 previously discussed allows more convenient storage of the luggage 110 because the flat surface 112 of the major wall 108 is not interrupted by the projection of the housings 116 and wheels 106 in the operating position.
    </p>
    <p num="63">
      The retraction of the wheels 106 and the housings 116 from the operating position must be done manually by the user.
      <br/>
      The user must rotate each housing 116 and wheel 106 against the biasing force exerted by the spring-biased hinge 126 back into their respective wells 128 in the luggage 10.
      <br/>
      Each housing 116 and wheel 106 will be "snap-locked" into place by the tongue 122 when the housing 116 and wheel 106 reach their retracted position in their well 128.
    </p>
    <p num="64">
      This "snap-locking" effect occurs as follows.
      <br/>
      The tongue 122 protrudes from an aperture 142 in the well 128 when the interior 141 of the well 128 is not filled by the housing 116 and the wheel 106.
      <br/>
      This protrusion of the tongue 122 into the interior 141 of the well 128 occurs due to the spring 130 biasing the bar 120 toward the well 128 when no tensile force 138 is acting on the cable 134.
      <br/>
      The flange 135 serves to limit the biasing of the bar 120 toward the well 128 by contacting the well 128, as well as serving to hold the spring 130 as previously mentioned.
      <br/>
      When the housing 116 is rotated into the well 128, the outer surface 145 of the housing 116 contacts the tongue 122 forcing it temporarily inward toward the well 128 against the biasing force of the spring 130.
      <br/>
      When the tongue 122, however, reaches the aperture 124 in the housing 116 due to the rotation of the housing 116 into the well 128, the tongue 122 will be snapped into the aperture 124 by the biasing force of the spring 130, thus locking the housing 116 and attached wheel 106 into place.
    </p>
    <p num="65">
      FIGS. 20 and 21 detail an alternative arrangement for the retractable wheel assemblies 144.
      <br/>
      The major difference from the previously described arrangement is the alteration of the member restraining the wheel 147 and the housing 149 in a retracted position from the bar 120 previously described to a pivotable member 146.
      <br/>
      The pivotable member 146 restrains the wheel 147 and the housing 149 by a tongue 148 fitting through an aperture 150 in the well 152 and an aperture 154 in the housing 149, similarly to the previous description.
    </p>
    <p num="66">
      However, the pivotable member 146 is of a generally cross shape in plan and is pivotably attached 156 to the luggage 158.
      <br/>
      The pivotable attachment is located on one arm 160 of the pivotable member 146 transverse to the tongue 148 of the pivotable member 146, while a second arm 162 of the pivotable member 146 is attached through a spring 164 to the luggage 158.
    </p>
    <p num="67">
      Upon the pulling of a cable 166, attached to an end 168 of the pivotable member 156 opposite the tongue 148, by a process similar to that previously described, the pivotable member 146 pivots about the pivotable attachment 156 such that the tongue 148 no longer passes through the aperture 154, (see dotted line shape 170 in FIG. 20 representing the pivoted position of the pivotable member 146).
      <br/>
      When a pulling force is no longer exerted on the cable 166, the spring 164 acts to cause the pivotable member 146 to pivot in the opposite direction from the direction of pivoting of the pivotable member 146 when the cable 166 was pulled, such pivoting producing the result that the tongue 148 is again in a position to pass through the aperture 154.
      <br/>
      Similarly to the previously described wheel arrangement, the interior 172 of the well 152 must be empty to allow the tongue 148 to be pivoted back by the spring 164 to a position to pass through the aperture 154.
      <br/>
      This position of the tongue 148 protruding from the well 152 into the empty interior 172 of the well 152 will insure a "snap lock" of the housing 149 and the wheel 147 into the retracted position when the housing 149 and the wheel 147 are subsequently manually retracted, the "snap lock" occurring by a process similar to that described for the previous wheel arrangement.
    </p>
    <p num="68">It should be noted that the wheel shown in the center of the major wall for the retractable wheel arrangements is exemplary only and may easily be replaced by the roller ball shown in other of the drawings appended hereto.</p>
    <p num="69">Furthermore, the arrangements disclosed for retaining the retractable wheels in a retracted position and releasing them from that position are exemplary only, and persons with ordinary skill in the art can easily conceive of alternative arrangements which are within the scope of the appended claims.</p>
    <p num="70">
      Optionally, and as illustrated in FIG. 1, the front wall 26 can also be detachably attached to the body of the carrying case 14 by a zippered connection therewith as indicated at 34 in FIG. 1.
      <br/>
      This will permit the front wall 26 with its attached ground engagable wheels 22 and 24 and the center caster 40 to be entirely removed from the carrying case in the event that it is not deemed needed for a particular use or if replacement, repair, or cleaning of the surface is desired.
      <br/>
      If desired, access to the interior of the carrying case can be provided by a zippered closure located underneath the front wall 26.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, the zippered closure can be provided on the back face 28 of the carrying case, in which event the handle 18 and its legs 20 can also be made removable from the body of the carrying case.
