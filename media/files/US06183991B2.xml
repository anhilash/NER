    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">
      Proliferation and differentiation of cells within multicellular organisms is controlled by hormones and polypeptide growth factors.
      <br/>
      These diffusable molecules allow cells to communicate with each other and act in concert to form organs, and to repair and regenerate damaged tissue.
      <br/>
      Examples of hormones and growth factors include the steroid hormones (e.g., estrogen, testosterone), parathyroid hormone, follicle stimulating hormone, the interleukins, platelet derived growth factor (PDGF), epidermal growth factor (EGF), granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF), erythropoietin (EPO), insulin and calcitonin.
    </p>
    <p num="3">
      Hormones and growth factors influence cellular metabolism by binding to receptors.
      <br/>
      Receptors may be integral membrane proteins that are linked to signaling pathways within the cell, such as second messenger systems.
      <br/>
      Other classes of receptors are soluble molecules, such as certain transcription factors.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      Insulin belongs to a group of protein/polypeptide hormones.
      <br/>
      Insulin increases the rate of synthesis of glycogen, fatty acids, and proteins and stimulates glycolysis.
      <br/>
      It also promotes the transport of glucose, some other sugars, and amino acids into muscle and fat cells.
      <br/>
      The mature form of insulin consists of a 30 amino acid residue B chain, that is at the N-terminus of the propeptide form, and a 21 amino acid residue A chain, that is C-terminal.
      <br/>
      Proinsulin also contains a connecting peptide, C-peptide, between the B chain and A chain that is cleaved out to form mature insulin.
      <br/>
      The B chain and A chain are covalently joined by two disulfide bonds.
      <br/>
      The B-chain, C-peptide, A-chain motif is found in several other proteins including, relaxin (U.S. Pat. No. 4,835,251, incorporated herein by reference), insulin-like growth factors (IGF) I and II (Bang and Hall, In "Insulin-like Growth Factors", P. N. Schofield (eds.), 151-177, Oxford Univ.
      <br/>
      Press, Oxford; incorporated herein by reference), Leydig factor (Bullesbach et al., J. Biol. Chem. 270:16011-16015, 1995; incorporated herein by reference), and early placenta insulin-like factor (EPIL; Chassin et al., Genomics 29:465-470, 1995, incorporated herein by reference).
      <br/>
      Unlike the other members of the insulin superfamily, IGF I and IGF II have D and E domains that are cleaved post-translationally.
      <br/>
      Cysteines that are involved in disulfide bonds are conserved in all the members of the family and play a role in the tertiary structure of the molecules.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      Spermatogenesis is the process by which a germ cell proceeds through multiple stages of differentiation, and culminates in the formation of a terminally differentiated cell with a unique function.
      <br/>
      Hematopoiesis can be used as a paradigm for understanding spermatogenesis, and while there are striking parallels between what is known about hematopoiesis and spermatogenesis, the maturation of spermatogonia (germ cells) is less clearly understood than the maturation of hematopoietic stem cells.
      <br/>
      Particularly deficient is an understanding of factors that regulate the maturation process in spermatogenesis.
      <br/>
      Recent evidence suggests that some cytokines involved in the progression of stem cells of the hematopoietic lineage to fully differentiated cells are also involved in sperm cell maturation.
      <br/>
      In a fashion similar to cytokine action in hematopoiesis, these cytokines are thought to act at specific stages in the germ cell's maturation.
      <br/>
      For example, stem cell factor (also known as Steel factor and c-kit ligand) mRNA is expressed in spermatogonia (Manova et al., Development 110:1057-1066, 1990), and administration of a monoclonal antibody to stem cell factor to adult or prepubertal mice causes depletion of differentiating spermatogonia but has no effect on the non-differentiating spermatogonia, or spermatocytes (Yoshinaga et al., Development 113:689-699, 1991).
      <br/>
      Other cytokines that have been associated with spermatogenesis include IL-1, IL-6 and  BETA -TGF (Sharp, Regulation of Spermatogenesis, in Knobil and Neil (ed.), Physiol. Reproduction, (2nd ed.), Raven, N.Y., 1994).
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      Because growth factors have had an enormous impact on our understanding of and ability to treat metabolic and cellular disorders, discovery of new factors is important.
      <br/>
      A new growth factor found in testis is particularly important for elucidating the spermatogenic process and potentially affecting the outcome of that process.

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="28">
      The term "allelic variant" is used herein to denote any of two or more alternative forms of a gene occupying the same chromosomal locus.
      <br/>
      Allelic variation arises naturally through mutation, and may result in phenotypic polymorphism within populations.
      <br/>
      Gene mutations can be silent (no change in the encoded polypeptide) or may encode polypeptides having altered amino acid sequence.
      <br/>
      The term allelic variant is also used herein to denote a protein encoded by an allelic variant of a gene.
    </p>
    <p num="29">
      The term "expression vector" is used to denote a DNA molecule, linear or circular, that comprises a segment encoding a polypeptide of interest operably linked to additional segments that provide for its transcription.
      <br/>
      Such additional segments include promoter and terminator sequences, and may also include one or more origins of replication, one or more selectable markers, an enhancer, a polyadenylation signal, etc.
      <br/>
      Expression vectors are generally derived from plasmid or viral DNA, or may contain elements of both.
    </p>
    <p num="30">The term "isolated", when applied to a polynucleotide, denotes that the polynucleotide has been removed from its natural genetic milieu and is thus free of other extraneous or unwanted coding sequences, and is in a form suitable for use within genetically engineered protein production systems.</p>
    <p num="31">"Operably linked", when referring to DNA segments, indicates that the segments are arranged so that they function in concert for their intended purposes, e.g. transcription initiates in the promoter and proceeds through the coding segment to the terminator.</p>
    <p num="32">
      A "polynucleotide" is a single- or double-stranded polymer of deoxyribonucleotide or ribonucleotide bases read from the 5' to the 3' end.
      <br/>
      Polynucleotides include RNA and DNA, and may be isolated from natural sources, synthesized in vitro, or prepared from a combination of natural and synthetic molecules.
    </p>
    <p num="33">
      The term "promoter" is used herein for its art-recognized meaning to denote a portion of a gene containing DNA sequences that provide for the binding of RNA polymerase and initiation of transcription.
      <br/>
      Promoter sequences are commonly, but not always, found in the 5' non-coding regions of genes.
    </p>
    <p num="34">
      The term "receptor" is used herein to denote a cell-associated protein, or a polypeptide subunit of such a protein, that binds to a bioactive molecule (the "ligand") and mediates the effect of the ligand on the cell.
      <br/>
      Binding of ligand to receptor results in a conformational change in the receptor (and, in some cases, receptor multimerization, i.e., association of identical or different receptor subunits) that causes interactions between the effector domain(s) and other molecule(s) in the cell.
      <br/>
      These interactions in turn lead to alterations in the metabolism of the cell.
      <br/>
      Metabolic events that are linked to receptor-ligand interactions include gene transcription, phosphorylation, dephosphorylation, cell proliferation, increases in cyclic AMP production, mobilization of cellular calcium, mobilization of membrane lipids, cell adhesion, hydrolysis of inositol lipids and hydrolysis of phospholipids.
      <br/>
      The term "receptor polypeptide" is used to denote complete receptor polypeptide chains and portions thereof, including isolated functional domains (e.g., ligand-binding domains).
    </p>
    <p num="35">
      A "secretory signal sequence" is a DNA sequence that encodes a polypeptide (a "secretory peptide") that, as a component of a larger polypeptide, directs the larger polypeptide through a secretory pathway of a cell in which it is synthesized.
      <br/>
      The larger polypeptide is commonly cleaved to remove the secretory peptide during transit through the secretory pathway.
    </p>
    <p num="36">
      The present invention is based in part upon the discovery of a novel DNA sequence that encodes a polypeptide with homology to the insulin family (i.e., insulin, relaxin, Leydig factor, INSL-4, IGF I and IGF II).
      <br/>
      The DNA sequence was designated Zins2.
      <br/>
      Analysis of the tissue distribution of the mRNA corresponding to this novel DNA showed that expression was restricted to the testis.
      <br/>
      In situ hybridization analysis demonstrated that mRNA is localized in the seminiferous tubules and epididymus, suggesting a role as a growth or differentiation factor for testis-specific cell types and involvement in sperm activation.
    </p>
    <p num="37">
      Spermatogenesis is a sequential process and takes place in the seminiferous tubules, where germ cells ultimately mature into spermatozoa, herein referred to as sperm.
      <br/>
      Testis-specific factors that influence the maturation process may come directly from the Sertoli cells that are in contact with spermatogenic cells, or may be paracrine or endocrine factors.
      <br/>
      Many of the molecules produced outside the seminiferous tubules are transported into the sperm cell microenvironment by transport and binding proteins that are expressed by the Sertoli cells within the seminiferous tubules.
    </p>
    <p num="38">
      Paracrine factors that cross the cellular barrier and enter the sperm cell microenvironment include molecules secreted from Leydig cells.
      <br/>
      Leydig cells are located in the interstitial space found between the seminiferous tubules, and produce several factors believed to play an important role in spermatogenic cell maturation process, such as testosterone, Leydig factor, IGF-1, inhibin and activin.
      <br/>
      The expression of these, and other factors, may be specific to a defined stage in the spermatogenic cycle.
      <br/>
      The sperm is then transported to the epididymus, where sperm motility and fertilization capacity are increased.
      <br/>
      The sperm is stored in the tail of the epididymus until released.
    </p>
    <p num="39">
      Before reaching the oocyte or egg and initiating an egg-sperm interaction, the sperm must be activated.
      <br/>
      The sperm undergo a gradual capacitation, lasting up to 3 or 4 hours in vitro, during which the plasma membrane of the sperm head and the outer acrosomal membrane fuse to form vesicles that facilitate the release of acrosomal enzymes.
      <br/>
      The acrosomal membrane surrounds the acrosome or acrosomal cap which is located at the anterior end of the nucleus in the sperm head.
    </p>
    <p num="40">
      In order for the sperm to interact with the egg the sperm must penetrate the oocyte.
      <br/>
      To enable this process the sperm must undergo acrosomal exocytosis, also known as the acrosomal reaction, and release the acrosomal enzymes in the vicinity of the oocyte.
      <br/>
      These enzymes enable the sperm to penetrate the various oocyte layers, (the cumulus oophorus, the corona radiata and the zona pellucida) and initiate an interaction with the egg.
      <br/>
      The released acrosomal enzymes include hyaluronidase and proacrosin, in addition to other enzymes such as proteases.
      <br/>
      During the acrosomal reaction, proacrosin is converted to acrosin, the active form of the enzyme, which is required for and must occur before binding and penetration of the zona pellucida is possible.
      <br/>
      A combination of the acrosomal lytic enzymes and sperm tail movements provide the sperm with the ability to penetrate the oocyte layers.
      <br/>
      Numerous sperm must reach the egg and release their acrosomal enzymes before the egg can finally be fertilized.
      <br/>
      Only one sperm will successfully bind to and penetrate the egg, after which the zona hardens so that no other sperm can penetrate and fertilization of the egg occurs (Zaneveld, in Male Infertility Chapter 11, Comhaire (Ed.), Chapman &amp; Hall, London 1996).
      <br/>
      Insulin homologs have been associated with sperm activation and egg-sperm interaction.
      <br/>
      For instance, capacitated sperm incubated with relaxin showed an increased percentage of progressively motile sperm, increased zona penetration rates, and increased percentage of viable acrosome-reacted sperm (Carrell et al., Endocr. Res. 21:697-707, 1995).
      <br/>
      Homology of the Zins2 proteins with relaxin and localization of Zins2 to the testis suggests that the Zins2 proteins described herein play a role in these and other reproductive processes.
    </p>
    <p num="41">
      Analysis of a rat cDNA encoding a testis-specific insulin homolog (SEQ ID NO:1) revealed an opening reading frame encoding 188 amino acids (SEQ ID NO: 2), comprising a putative signal sequence and a mature polypeptide.
      <br/>
      The analysis of a representative human cDNA sequence encoding a testis-specific insulin homolog polypeptide revealed a similar homology, with an open reading frame of 213 amino acids as shown in SEQ ID NO: 13.
    </p>
    <p num="42">
      The mature polypeptide has homology with insulin, relaxin 1 and 2, INSL-4 and Leydig factor, respectively, as shown in FIGS. 1A and 1B. Within this family, the cysteine motif is highly conserved in the B and A chains, where the B chain motif can be represented as LCGX+10}C, where X+ } is the number of any amino acid residues except cysteine.
      <br/>
      The A chain motif is CCX+3}CX+8}C, where X+ } is the number of any amino acid residues, except cysteine.
    </p>
    <p num="43">
      Isolation of a rat cDNA sequence encoding testis-specific insulin homolog revealed that the predicted amino acid sequence contained the B chain-C peptide-A chain motif found in the relaxins and insulin.
      <br/>
      Preprorelaxin and preproinsulin both have a signal sequence, followed by the B chain, C peptide, and A chain.
      <br/>
      The mature molecule of both relaxin and insulin has the signal peptide and C peptide removed, with the B and A chains joined by both inter- and intra-chain disulfide bonds (James et al., Nature 267:544-546, 1977).
      <br/>
      Isolation of a human clone and subsequent sequence analysis indicates that the human sequence (as shown in SEQ ID NO: 13) is structurally equivalent to other members of the family.
    </p>
    <p num="44">
      Processing of the mature protein molecule involves cleavage at the C-terminus of the signal peptide, and, based on predicted structural homology with other mature members of the insulin family, a cleavage at the C-terminus of the B chain and at the N-terminus of the A chain, resulting in removal of the C-peptide.
      <br/>
      Alignment of the rat testis-specific insulin homolog of the present invention with other known members of the insulin family (as shown in the FIGS. 1A and 1B) suggests a signal peptide cleavage site in the region of amino acid residue 22 (Glu) to amino acid residue 23 (Gln) of SEQ ID NO:2.
      <br/>
      Cleavage at the C-terminus of the B chain is predicted to be at the C-terminal of amino acid residue 52 (Arg) followed by cleavage of the Arg residue by carboxypeptidase to leave amino acid residue 51 (Phe) as the C-terminal amino acid residue.
      <br/>
      Cleavage sites resulting in the N-terminus of the A chain are suggested in the region of amino acid residue 161 (Arg) to 163 (Gly).
      <br/>
      Cleavage is predicted to be after the C-terminus of amino acid residue 162 (Arg) leaving amino acid residue 163 (Gly) as the N-terminal amino acid residue of the A chain.
      <br/>
      The C-terminal amino acid is residue 188 (Phe).
      <br/>
      The cleavage site at the junction of the C-peptide and A chain is highly conserved, occurring after Arg-X-X-Arg (wherein X is any amino acid residue), Arg-Arg or Lys-Arg; however, the cleavage sites at the junction of the signal sequence and B chain, and at the junction of the B chain and C-peptide, do not maintain a similarly high degree of conservation within the insulin family.
    </p>
    <p num="45">
      Alignment of a representative human testis-specific insulin homolog polypeptide suggests signal peptide cleavage in the region of amino acid residue 20 (Ser) to residue 21 (Arg) of SEQ ID NO:13.
      <br/>
      Cleavage at the C-terminus of the B chain is predicted to be C-terminal of amino acid residue 54 (Arg), followed by cleavage of the Arg residue by a carboxypeptidase, to leave amino acid residue 53 (Phe) as the C-terminal amino acid residue of the B chain.
      <br/>
      Cleavage sites resulting in the N-terminus of the A chain are suggested in the region of amino acid residue 171 (Arg) to 173 (Gly).
      <br/>
      Cleavage is predicted to be at the C-terminus of amino acid residue 172 (Arg) leaving amino acid residue 173 (Gly) as the N-terminal amino acid residue of the A chain.
    </p>
    <p num="46">
      There are several potential cleavage sites in the C-terminal portion of the predicted human Zins2 A chain sequence, for example C-terminal of the Arg at amino acid residue 200 or C-terminal of the Arg at amino acid residue 205.
      <br/>
      It is not obvious based on the amino acid sequence of the human Zins2 testis-specific insulin homolog (SEQ ID NO:13) alone, or in comparison with other insulin homologs (FIGS. 1A and 1B), which site is the A chain C-terminal cleavage site, or if there would be cleavage at all.
      <br/>
      IGF-1 has a furin cleavage site and multiple potential monobasic cleavage sites and consensus furin sites in the C-terminal of the A chain, while insulin and relaxin do not.
      <br/>
      A determination of which of the two possible sites is the actual cleavage site is not possible based on the human Zins2 sequence alone.
      <br/>
      Knowledge of the amino acid sequence of the rat Zins2 homolog (SEQ ID NO:2) enables a reasonable prediction of the C-terminal cleavage site for the human A chain.
      <br/>
      Human Zins2 has two potential cleavage sites wherein rat Zins2 does not.
      <br/>
      There is a cleavage site in the human sequence C-terminal of amino acid residue 200 (Arg).
      <br/>
      Cleavage at this site, followed by cleavage of the Arg (amino acid residue 200) and Lys (amino acid residue 199) residues by a carboxypeptidase, leaves amino acid residue 198 (Phe) as the C-terminal amino acid residue of the human A chain which corresponds to the rat sequence as disclosed in SEQ ID NO:2.
      <br/>
      It is therefore predicted, based on the rat Zins2 homolog, that C-terminal cleavage site of the human Zins2 A chain would be C-terminal of amino acid residue 200 (Arg) of SEQ ID NO:13.
    </p>
    <p num="47">
      Based on the predicted sites, the amino acid sequence of mature human Zins2 testis-specific insulin homolog include, a B chain having the sequence of SEQ ID NO:13 from amino acid residue 21 (Arg) to amino acid residue 53 (Phe), and an A chain having the sequence of SEQ ID NO:13 from amino acid residue 173 (Gly) to amino acid residue 198 (Phe).
      <br/>
      The amino acid sequence of the mature rat Zins2 testis-specific insulin homolog include, a B chain having the sequence of SEQ ID NO:2 from amino acid residue 23 (Gln) to amino acid residue 51 (Ser), and an A chain having the sequence of SEQ ID NO:2 from amino acid residue 163 (Gly) to amino acid residue 188 (Phe).
      <br/>
      The B and A chains are joined by inter- and intra-chain disulfide bonds.
    </p>
    <p num="48">
      The enzymology of proinsulin conversion suggests that prohormone convertase 3 (PC3) or other homolog-monobasic capable convertases, cleave primarily at the B chain-C-peptide junction, and that prohormone convertase 2 (PC2) or similar convertases cleave preferentially at the C-peptide-A-chain junction and favor proinsulin already processed by PC3 over intact prohormone.
      <br/>
      In human and rat proinsulin, dibasic residues link the B chain and C-peptide and the C-peptide and A chain.
      <br/>
      In addition, a basic residue 4 residues N-terminal to the cleavage site (a "P4 basic residue") may be present at one or both junctions, and may influence the ability of furin, or similar convertases of the furin family such as prohormone convertase 4 (PC4) and PACE4, to cleave at the junction sites.
      <br/>
      In a study reported by Vollenweider et al. (Diabetes 44:1075-80, 1995), cotransfection of COS cells with PC3 and either human proinsulin, rat proinsulin II or mutant human proinsulin Arg62 showed that PC3 cleaved both proinsulin junctions, regardless of the presence or absence of a P4 basic residue.
    </p>
    <p num="49">
      Within the relaxin proteins there is a highly conserved region in the B chain of Cys-Gly-Arg and Cys-Gly at amino acid residues 35 to 37 and amino acid residues 47 to 48, respectively, that is also found in the rat testis-specific insulin homolog protein of the present invention at amino acid residues 33 to 35 and amino acid residues 45 to 46 of SEQ ID NO:2, respectively.
      <br/>
      The equivalent region in the human sequence shown in SEQ ID NO:13 is amino acid residues 33-35 and 45-46, respectively and is shown in the FIGS. 1A and 1B. There is evidence that residues 35-41 (CGRELVR), as found in the relaxins (and shown in the FIGS. 1A and 1B), are important for binding the relaxin receptor (Bullesbach et al., J. Biol. Chem. 267:22957-22960, 1992).
      <br/>
      The Zins2 testis-specific insulin homologs are missing one of the critical arginine residues, in the rat Zins2 sequence, the second arginine is replaced by valine (amino acid residue 39 of SEQ ID NO:2) and in the human Zins2 sequence, arginine is replaced by lysine (amino acid residue 39 of SEQ ID NO:13).
      <br/>
      This substitution does not rule out the possibility of cross-reactivity by the relaxins with Zins2, but it is unlikely that Zins2 would be cross-reactive with the relaxins.
    </p>
    <p num="50">
      Also provided by the present invention are post-translationally modified polypeptides or polypeptide fragments having the amino acid sequence from amino acid residue 53 to amino acid residue 162 of SEQ ID NO:2; the amino acid sequence from amino acid residue 55 to amino acid residue 172 of SEQ ID NO:13 or the amino acid sequence from amino acid residue 201 to amino acid residue 213 of SEQ ID NO:13.
      <br/>
      Examples of post translational modifications include proteolytic cleavage, glycosylation, disulfide bonding and hydroxylation.
      <br/>
      The C peptide from insulin, when administered to diabetic rats, decreased or prevented diabetes-induced damage to neurons or blood vessels (Ido et al., Science 277:563-66, 1997).

      Chromosomal localization of the human Zins2 testis-specific insulin homolog polypeptide to chromosome 9p24 was determined using radiation hybrid chimeras.
      <br/>
      INSL4, another insulin homolog associated with reproductive tissue, was also mapped to chromosome 9p24 (Chassin et al., Genomics 29:465-70, 1995).
      <br/>
      Relaxin 1 and 2 were mapped to 9pter-q12 (Grawford et al., EMBO J. 3:2341-45, 1984).
      <br/>
      Several cases of sex reversal have been reported in association with de novo translocation or deletion involving 9p24 suggesting an association with this region and testis development (Hoo et al., Am. J. Hum. Genet. 45 (suppl.) :A78, 1989; Bennett et al., J. Med. Genet. 30:518-20, 1993).

      Those skilled in the art will recognize that the sequences disclosed in SEQ ID NO:1 and SEQ ID NO:12 represent a single allele of the rat and human testis-specific insulin homolog polypeptide, respectively, and that allelic variation, "allelic variants", and alternative splicing, "splice variants", are expected to occur.
      <br/>
      Allelic variants of the DNA sequences shown in SEQ ID NO:1 and SEQ ID NO:12, including those containing silent mutations and those in which mutations result in amino acid sequence changes, are within the scope of the present invention, as are proteins which are allelic variants of SEQ ID NO:2 and SEQ ID NO:13.
      <br/>
      Splice variants of the DNA sequences shown in SEQ ID NO:1 and SEQ ID NO:12 include DNA sequences that result from mature RNA molecules created by known eukaryotic RNA splicing processes wherein intron sequence is removed and exon sequence is joined.

      The present invention further provides counterpart polypeptides and polynucleotides from other species ("species homologs").

      These species would include, but are not limited to, mammalian, avian, amphibian, reptile, fish, insect and other vertebrate and invertebrate species.
      <br/>
      Of particular interest are testis-specific insulin homolog polypeptides from other mammalian species, including murine, porcine, ovine, bovine, canine, feline, equine and other primate proteins.
      <br/>
      Species homologs of relaxin are unique in that there is considerable structural variation between the species, possibly resulting in functional differences between the proteins from species to species.
      <br/>
      For example, between pig, rat and human relaxins the amino acid residues can vary by greater than 50% (U.S. Pat. No. 4,835,251, incorporated herein by reference.)

      Alternate species polypeptides of zins2 may have importance therapeutically.
      <br/>
      It has been demonstrated that in some cases use of a non-native protein, i.e., protein from a different species, can be more potent than the native protein.
      <br/>
      For example, salmon calcitonin has been shown to be considerably more effective in arresting bone resorption than human forms of calcitonin.
      <br/>
      There are several hypotheses as to why salmon calcitonin is more potent than human calcitonin in treatment of osteoporosis.
      <br/>
      These hypotheses include: 1) salmon calcitonin is more resistant to degradation; 2) salmon calcitonin has a lower metabolic clearance rate (MCR); and 3) salmon calcitonin may have a slightly different conformation, resulting in a higher affinity for bone receptor sites.
      <br/>
      Another example is found in the  BETA -endorphin family (Ho et al., Int. J. Peptide Protein Res. 29:521-24, 1987).
      <br/>
      Studies have demonstrated that the peripheral opioid activity of camel, horse, turkey and ostrich  BETA -endorphins is greater than that of human  BETA -endorphins when isolated guinea pig ileum was electrostimulated and contractions were measured.
      <br/>
      Vas deferens from rat, mouse and rabbit were assayed as well.
      <br/>
      In the rat vas deferens model, camel and horse  BETA -endorphins showed the highest relative potency.
      <br/>
      Synthesized rat relaxin was as active as human and porcine relaxin in the mouse symphysis pubis assay (Bullesbach and Schwabe, Eur. J. Biochem. 241:533-7, 1996).
      <br/>
      Thus, the rat zins2 molecules of the present invention may have higher potency than the human endogenous molecule in human cells, tissues and recipients.

      The proteins of the present invention can also comprise, in addition to the 20 standard amino acids, non-naturally occurring amino acid residues.

      Non-naturally occurring amino acids include, without limitation, trans-3-methylproline, 2,4-methanoproline, cis-4-hydroxyproline, trans-4-hydroxyproline, N-methyl-glycine, allo-threonine, methylthreonine, hydroxyethyl-cysteine, hydroxyethylhomocysteine, nitroglutamine, homoglutamine, pipecolic acid, tert-leucine, norvaline, 2-azaphenylalanine, 3-azaphenylalanine, 4-azaphenyl-alanine, 4-fluorophenylalanine, 4-hydroxyproline, 6-N-methyl lysine, 2-aminoisobutyric acid, isovaline and  ALPHA -methyl serine.
      <br/>
      Several methods are known in the art for incorporating non-naturally occurring amino acid residues into proteins.
      <br/>
      For example, an in vitro system can be employed wherein nonsense mutations are suppressed using chemically aminoacylated suppressor tRNAs.
      <br/>
      Methods for synthesizing amino acids and aminoacylating tRNA are known in the art.
      <br/>
      Transcription and translation of plasmids containing nonsense mutations are carried out in a cell free system comprising an E. coli S30 extract and commercially available enzymes and other reagents.
      <br/>
      Proteins are purified by chromatography.
      <br/>
      See, for example, Robertson et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc. 113:2722, 1991; Ellman et al., Meth. Enzymol. 202:301, 1991; Chung et al., Science 259:806-09, 1993; and Chung et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 90:10145-49, 1993).
      <br/>
      In a second method, translation is carried out in Xenopus oocytes by microinjection of mutated mRNA and chemically aminoacylated suppressor tRNAs (Turcatti et al., J. Biol. Chem. 271:19991-98, 1996).
      <br/>
      Within a third method, E. coli cells are cultured in the absence of a natural amino acid that is to be replaced (e.g., phenylalanine) and in the presence of the desired non-naturally occurring amino acid(s) (e.g., 2-azaphenylalanine, 3-azaphenylalanine, 4-azaphenylalanine, or 4-fluorophenylalanine).
      <br/>
      The non-naturally occurring amino acid is incorporated into the protein in place of its natural counterpart.
      <br/>
      See, Koide et al., Biochem. 33:7470-76, 1994.
      <br/>
      Naturally occurring amino acid residues can be converted to non-naturally occurring species by in vitro chemical modification.
      <br/>
      Chemical modification can be combined with site-directed mutagenesis to further expand the range of substitutions (Wynn and Richards, Protein Sci. 2:395-403, 1993).

      <br/>
      In the latter technique, single alanine mutations are introduced at every residue in the molecule, and the resultant mutant molecules are tested for biological activity (e.g. proliferation or differentiation) to identify amino acid residues that are critical to the activity of the molecule.
    </p>

      Drug selection is generally used to select for cultured mammalian cells into which foreign DNA has been inserted.
      <br/>
      Such cells are commonly referred to as "transfectants".
      <br/>
      Cells that have been cultured in the presence of the selective agent and are able to pass the gene of interest to their progeny are referred to as "stable transfectants." A preferred selectable marker is a gene encoding resistance to the antibiotic neomycin.

      Selection is carried out in the presence of a neomycin-type drug, such as G-418 or the like.
      <br/>
      Selection systems may also be used to increase the expression level of the gene of interest, a process referred to as "amplification." Amplification is carried out by culturing transfectants in the presence of a low level of the selective agent and then increasing the amount of selective agent to select for cells that produce high levels of the products of the introduced genes.

      Non-human antibodies may be humanized by grafting only non-human CDRs onto human framework and constant regions, or by incorporating the entire non-human variable domains (optionally "cloaking" them with a human-like surface by replacement of exposed residues, wherein the result is a "veneered" antibody).
      <br/>
      In some instances, humanized antibodies may retain non-human residues within the human variable region framework domains to enhance proper binding characteristics.
      <br/>
      Through humanizing antibodies, biological half-life may be increased, and the potential for adverse immune reactions upon administration to humans is reduced.
      <br/>
      Alternative techniques for generating or selecting antibodies useful herein include in vitro exposure of lymphocytes to testis-specific insulin homolog protein or peptide, and selection of antibody display libraries in phage or similar vectors (for instance, through use of immobilized or labeled testis-specific insulin homolog protein or peptide).

      Testis-specific insulin homolog polypeptide prepared according to the present invention is purified using methods generally known in the art, such as affinity purification and separations based on size, charge, solubility and other properties of the protein.
      <br/>
      When the protein is produced in cultured mammalian cells, it is preferred to culture the cells in a serum-free culture medium in order to limit the amount of contaminating protein.
      <br/>
      The medium is harvested and fractionated.
      <br/>
      Preferred methods of fractionation include affinity chromatography, Q-Fast Flow Sepharose, MonoQ resin, FPLC, phenyl Sepharose, hydroxyapatite, Mono S and/or S-Sepharose.

      Proteins can also be purified using an immobilized an affinity tag (e.g., polyhistidine, substance P or other polypeptide or protein for which an antibody or other specific binding agent is available).
      <br/>
      A specific cleavage site may be provided between the protein of interest and the affinity tag.
      <br/>
      Preferred affinity tags include polyhistidine tail, which permits purification of the fusion protein on immobilized nickel (Houchuli et al., Bio/Technol. 6:1321-1325, 1988).
      <br/>
      In prokaryotic expression systems, a maltose binding protein (MBP) fusion may be advantageously used as an affinity tag.

      Suspension of the sperm in seminal plasma from normal subjects or in a "capacitation media"containing a cocktail of compounds known to activate sperm, such as caffeine, dibutyl cyclic adenosine monophosphate (dbcAMP) or theophylline, have resulted in improved reproductive function of the sperm, in particular, sperm motility and zonae penetration (Park et al., Am.
