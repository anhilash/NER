      <br/>
      An apparatus is automatically conveying cartridges reliably and correctly without causing errors, making it possible to enhance the operation efficiency and performance of the apparatus.
      <br/>
      The apparatus is automatically conveying cartridges disposed adjacent to a recording/reproducing apparatus, and is comprised of a cell mechanism having racks, an accessor mechanism having an accessor, and a conveyance control unit for controlling the conveyance of the cartridges by controlling the accessor mechanism, wherein the accessor is provided with catcher hands, a catcher hand drive mechanism, an open detector mechanism for detecting the open state of said catcher hands, and a closed detector mechanism for detecting the closed state of said catcher hand.
      <br/>
      The conveyance control unit is equipped with a catcher hand controller which controls the catcher hands to assume an open state, a closed state or a middle state which is an intermediate state relying upon the data detected by the open detector mechanism and the closure detector mechanism.

    <p num="4">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
    <p num="5">In recent years, automatic operation of magnetic tape units has become so advanced that it is necessary to employ an apparatus for automatically conveying cartridges to take a cartridge that is to be processed from a rack of a cell mechanism, in which a plurality of cartridges are stored, and to convey the cartridge to a magnetic tape apparatus.</p>
    <p num="6">
      In the apparatus for automatically conveying cartridges, a robot that requires a servo control operation has generally been controlled by firmware.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, the torque required from a motor to drive the apparatus for automatically conveying cartridges varies depending upon the apparatuses due to mechanical tolerance, the environment in which the apparatus for automatically conveying cartridges is used and the time of use.
      <br/>
      It is presumed that these differences result from a change in friction and mechanical tolerance.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      Despite the occurrence of the above-mentioned situations, any magnetic tape apparatus can be easily coped with if mechanical tolerance in the apparatus is absorbed by the firmware that controls the apparatus for automatically conveying cartridges.
      <br/>
      Moreover, incorporating a mechanical unit in the apparatus for automatically conveying cartridges maintaining precision requires laborious work as well as considerable expense.
      <br/>
      It therefore becomes necessary to assemble the apparatus while maintaining precision to a certain degree and, then, control the operation is corrected by the firmware.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      As the apparatus is designed to operate automatically, furthermore, it is required to operate unattended.
      <br/>
      Therefore, it is necessary to develop a library unit which stores a number of cartridges and conveys a cartridge to the magnetic tape apparatus to automatically execute recording/reproducing operation.
      <br/>
      Even when the apparatus for automatically conveying cartridges is coupled to a library unit to automatically convey the cartridges, however, it is not possible to automatically convey the cartridges when there are included cartridges from which the leader block has been pulled out or when the detector mechanisms have been broken in the apparatus for automatically conveying the cartridges.
      <br/>
      In such a case, the operation must be carried out by an operator.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      Even in an apparatus in which the detector mechanisms have been broken, therefore, the processing can be continued if the cartridge contained therein can be taken out.
      <br/>
      It therefore becomes necessary to automatically continue the processing without assistance from an operator or maintenance personnel.
      <br/>
      This is related to enhancing the retry control operation when an error has occurred.
      <br/>
      When the operator uses the apparatus for automatically conveying cartridges, furthermore, the apparatus must be easily operated.
      <br/>
      For this purpose, the operation performance must be enhanced.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the operation must be simple and easy.

    <p num="11">.sctn.1: Description of a Cartridge and Apparatus for Automatically Conveying Cartridges--see FIGS. 1A to 1D.</p>
    <p num="12">
      FIG. 1A is a perspective view of a cartridge, FIG. 1B is a side view of a conventional ACL apparatus for a single unit, FIG. 1C is a side view of a conventional ACL apparatus for attachment to a library unit, and FIG. 1D is a plan view of a conventional accessor.
      <br/>
      In the following description, the apparatus for automatically conveying cartridges is referred to as an ACL (automatic cartridge loading) apparatus, the magnetic tape unit is referred to as "MTU", and the magnetic cartridge tape is referred to as "cartridge".
    </p>
    <p num="13">
      As a magnetic cape recording medium, there has heretofore been known a cartridge (magnetic cartridge tape) 1 that is shown (3480-type magnetic cartridge tape).
      <br/>
      There has been known an ACL apparatus for automatically conveying cartridges to the MTU which records and reproduces the data by using the cartridge 1.
      <br/>
      The ACL apparatus may be either an ACL apparatus 4 for a single unit or an ACL apparatus 5 for attachment to a library unit.
    </p>
    <p num="14">
      The ACL apparatus 4 for a single unit is used in combination with the MTU (as a unitary structure) and automatically conveys the cartridge to the MTU 6.
      <br/>
      The ACL apparatus 5 for attachment to a library is used in combination with the MTU 6 (as a unitary structure) and is further mechanically coupled to a library unit 12.
    </p>
    <p num="15">In this case, the library unit 12 is equipped with a cell (rack mechanism) for storing a number of cartridges therein, an MTU (unit separate from the MTU 6 combined with the ACL unit), an accessor mechanism for automatically conveying cartridges to the cell and to the MTU, and a cartridge access station (CAS) for automatically loading/discharging the cartridges.</p>
    <p num="16">
      As shown, the ACL apparatus 4 for a single unit is used in combination with the MTU 6 (as a unitary structure).
      <br/>
      The ACL apparatus 4 for a single unit is equipped with a cell mechanism 10 having many racks (cells) 11 for holding cartridges, and an accessor mechanism for automatically conveying cartridges.
      <br/>
      The accessor mechanism is provided with an accessor (mechanism which grips a cartridge and moves) 8, a shaft 9 and an accessor drive mechanism which includes a motor.
    </p>
    <p num="17">
      The accessor 8 is driven by the accessor drive mechanism and ascends or descends along the shaft 9 but does not turn on a horizontal plane.
      <br/>
      The cartridge can be inserted in each rack 11 of the cell mechanism 10, by hand, from the external side.
      <br/>
      The accessor 8 grips the cartridge inserted in the rack 11 of the cell mechanism 10, conveys it and loads it into the MTU 6.
      <br/>
      The cartridge loaded into the MTU is subjected to read/write processing.
      <br/>
      The cartridge processed in the MTU 6 is gripped by the accessor 8, conveyed to the cell mechanism 10 and is discharged into the rack 11.
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      Like the ACL apparatus 4 for a single unit, the ACL apparatus 5 for attachment to a library unit is used in combination with the MTU 6 and is further coupled (mechanically coupled) to a library unit 12.
      <br/>
      In this case, the ACL apparatus 5 for attachment to a library unit is provided with the accessor mechanism and the cell mechanism 10.
      <br/>
      Here, the cell mechanism 10 is provided with an entry cell 13 and an exit cell 14.
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      The ACL apparatus 5 for attachment to a library unit automatically exchanges the cartridge with the library unit 12 through the entry cell 13 and the exit cell 14.
      <br/>
      For instance, a cartridge stored in the library unit 12 is conveyed by the ACL apparatus 5 for attachment to a library unit to the MTU 6 (which is separate from the MTU in the library unit 12) and is subjected to read/write processing.
    </p>
    <p num="20">
      The accessor 8 is provided with catcher hands 19 (located on both sides) which open and close by turning about a rotary center shaft 20 to grip or release the cartridge 1, a catcher motor 21 for driving the catcher hands 19, feed motors 23 for feeding/returning (pulling/discharging) the cartridge by driving the feeder belts, a presence-of-cartridge sensor 25 for detecting the presence of a cartridge on the rack of the cell mechanism 10, a first cell side sensor 38 and a second cell side sensor 39 for detecting the presence of a cartridge in the accessor 8.
      <br/>
      The catcher hands 19 are disposed on the side of the cell mechanism 10.
    </p>
    <p num="21">.sctn.2: Controlling the Portions of the ACL Apparatus.</p>
    <p num="22">
      Described below are the operations for controlling the portions of the ACL. apparatus 4 for a single unit and of the ACL apparatus 5 for attachment to a library unit.
      <br/>
      In the following description, both the ACL apparatus 4 for a single unit and the ACL apparatus 5 for attachment to a library unit are simply referred to as "ACL apparatuses".
      <br/>
      Furthermore, the racks of the cell mechanism provided for the ACL apparatus 4 for a single unit and the entry cell and exit cell of the cell mechanism provided for the ACL apparatus 5 for attachment to a library unit are all referred to as "racks" or "cells".
    </p>
    <p num="23">(1) Controlling the accessor 8.</p>
    <p num="24">
      The accessor 8 in a conventional ACL apparatus is provided with catcher hands 19 which are closed or opened to grip or release the cartridge 1.
      <br/>
      For instance, when a cartridge held in the rack 11 of the cell mechanism 10 is to be pulled (fed) into the accessor, the catcher hands 19 are opened and are positioned to the cell mechanism 10.
      <br/>
      The catcher hands 19 are then closed to grip the cartridge and are pulled (fed) into the accessor 8.
    </p>
    <p num="25">When the cartridge in the accessor 8 is to be loaded into the MTU 6, the accessor 8 holding the cartridge is positioned to the MTU 6 (positioned in the direction of height) and the cartridge is loaded into the MTU 6.</p>
    <p num="26">(2) Detecting a cartridge present in the cell mechanism 10.</p>
    <p num="27">The cartridge 1 present on the rack of the cell mechanism 10 has heretofore been detected by the presence-of-cartridge sensor 25 provided on the accessor 8 in a manner as described below.</p>
    <p num="28">1 The cartridge 1 present on the rack (cell) has simply been detected by the presence-of-cartridge sensor 25, without making sure if the presence-of-cartridge sensor 25 itself is functioning properly or not.</p>
    <p num="29">2 Whether the presence-of-cartridge sensor 25 works properly or not is confirmed by the initialization processing only at the time when the power source circuit is closed.</p>
    <p num="30">(3) Controlling the position of the rack (cell).</p>
    <p num="31">So far, the position of the rack of the cell mechanism 10 has been corrected as described below.</p>
    <p num="32">1 The presence-of-cartridge sensor 25 is furnished with a function for detecting the position of the rack (cell), and mechanical dispersion due to mounting of the rack or due to the rack (cell) itself is absorbed by the presence-of-cartridge sensor 25.</p>
    <p num="33">2 The apparatus not equipped with the presence-of-cartridge sensor 25 could not absorb dispersion of the racks (cells).</p>
    <p num="34">3 In assembling the cell mechanism 10 of the ACL apparatus 5 for attachment to a library unit, positioning must be accomplished relative to the library unit and, hence, the cell mechanism 10 has been so assembled as to suppress dispersion of the racks (cells) without, however, correcting the positions of the racks (cells) in a subsequent step.</p>
    <p num="35">(4) Pushing the leader block into the cartridge.</p>
    <p num="36">
      When the leader block 2 of the cartridge 1 has been pulled out, the ACL apparatus 4 for a single unit informs the operator of the fact that the leader block 2 has been pulled out, informs an error and discharges the cartridge l. Even the ACL apparatus 5 for attachment to a library unit discharges the cartridge 1 without pushing in the leader block 2.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the cartridge 1 from which the leader block 2 has been pulled out is discharged without being processed.
    </p>
    <p num="37">(5) Controlling the feeder belts.</p>
    <p num="38">
      So far, when a cartridge gripped by the catcher hands 19 is to be discharged (returned) to the cell mechanism 10 or to the MTU 6 by the accessor 8, the motive power of the feeder motors 23 is transmitted to the feeder belts to discharge the cartridge.
      <br/>
      When there is no cartridge in the accessor 8, the feeder motors 23 are not driven and the feeder belts remain at rest.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the feeder belts are driven at one place only.
    </p>
    <p num="39">(6) Controlling the feeder learning.</p>
    <p num="40">
      The accessor 8 has been equipped with a feeder mechanism comprising feeder motors 23 and feeder belts in order to discharge (return) the cartridge in the accessor 8 into the cell mechanism 10 or into the MTU 6 or to pull (feed) the cartridge in the cell mechanism 10 or in the MTU 6 into the accessor 8.
      <br/>
      However, the feeder mechanism of the accessor 8 does not have a learning function but simply feeds or returns the cartridge.
    </p>
    <p num="41">(7) Initializing the cartridge.</p>
    <p num="42">
      The cartridge present in the accessor 8 is detected by using the first cell side sensor 38 and the second cell side sensor 39.
      <br/>
      When the power source circuit is closed or an error has occurred, however, the accessor 8 is not initialized.
    </p>
    <p num="43">(8) Retrying the feeder mechanism.</p>
    <p num="44">
      The accessor 8 is equipped with a feeder mechanism comprising feeder motors 23 and feeder belts in order to discharge (return) the cartridge in the accessor 8 into the cell mechanism 10 or into the MTU 6, or to pull (feed) the cartridge in the cell mechanism 10 or in the MTU 6 into the accessor 8.
      <br/>
      When an error occurs due to the operation for feeding or returning the cartridge, the accessor 8 is positioned again to the cell mechanism 10 or to the MTU 6, and the feeder mechanism is operated again.
    </p>
    <p num="45">(9) Returning the cartridge.</p>
    <p num="46">
      When the cartridge in the accessor 8 is to be discharged (returned) onto the rack of the cell mechanism 10, the accessor 8 is not equipped with a detection mechanism for detecting the returning state; i.e., the accessor 8 is moved in the discharging direction by a predetermined amount to discharge the cartridge after the cartridge is no longer detected by the first cell side sensor 38 and the second cell side sensor 39 that detects the cartridge properly held in the accessor 8.
      <br/>
      That is, when the cartridge is to be returned, the conventional apparatus does not detect to which position the cartridge is discharged but simply discharges the cartridge onto the rack so as to overrun to some extent.
    </p>
    <p num="47">(10) Controlling the position of cartridge (controlling the overrunning of cartridge).</p>
    <p num="48">
      The cartridge in the accessor 8 is discharged (returned) onto the rack of the cell mechanism 10 so as to overrun to some extent (discharged to go a little ahead of the specified holding position).
      <br/>
      That is, when the cartridge is discharged by the conventional apparatus, the cartridge is not controlled for its flying (overrunning) but is simply discharged onto the rack.
    </p>
    <p num="49">(11) Discriminating between new and old devices.</p>
    <p num="50">
      The conventional apparatus has not been equipped with a function for automatically discriminating a new ACL apparatus or an old ACL apparatus.
      <br/>
      The type of the apparatus has been discriminated by employing both new and old firmware or by setting in the apparatus data related to the types of the apparatuses.
    </p>
    <p num="51">The above-mentioned conventional apparatus involves the problems as described below.</p>
    <p num="52">(1) Controlling the catcher hands of the accessor.</p>
    <p num="53">
      The catcher hands 19 have been driven to be either opened or closed (open or closed state is based on the side of the cell mechanism 10) but not to assume an intermediate position.
      <br/>
      In the ACL apparatus 4 for a single unit, therefore, when the cartridge is loaded into the MTU 6, for example, the catcher hands 19 are opened on the side of the MTU 6 but are closed on the side of the cell mechanism.
      <br/>
      When the operator attempts to pull the cartridge on the rack of the cell mechanism 10 at a height same as the MTU 6 or attempts to insert the cartridge into the rack, therefore, the catcher hands 19 which are closed on the side of the cell mechanism 10 enter into the rack and become an obstacle.
    </p>
    <p num="54">
      In the ACL apparatus 5 for attachment to a library unit, furthermore, when the rack at the position of the MTU 6 (rack at the same height as the MTU 6) is used as the entry cell 13, the MTU 6 becomes flush with the entry cell 13, and the accessor 8 does not need to ascend or descend.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the shortest time is required for loading the cartridge into the MTU 6, but the accessor 8 becomes an obstacle; i.e., the accessor in the library unit is not allowed to freely access the entry cell 13.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the entry cell 13 has been deviated from the position (height) of the MTU 6.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, an extended period of time is required for loading the cartridge into the MTU 6.
    </p>
    <p num="55">(2) Detecting the presence of a cartridge on the rack.</p>
    <p num="56">
      1 In the case of the ACL apparatus 5 for attachment to a library unit, whether there is a cartridge in the entry cell 13 or in the exit cell 14 is detected by the presence-of-cartridge sensor 25.
      <br/>
      During the ordinary operation, however, whether the presence-of-cartridge sensor 25 itself is normally working or not has not been checked.
    </p>
    <p num="57">
      When the cartridge in the MTU 6 is to be discharged into the exit cell 14, first, the presence-of-cartridge sensor 25 determines whether there is a cartridge or not.
      <br/>
      Only when it is so judged that there is no cartridge, is the cartridge in the MTU 6 conveyed by the accessor 8 and discharged into the exit cell 14.
    </p>
    <p num="58">
      When it is so judged that there is a cartridge in the exit cell 14, however, it is not allowed to discharge the cartridge in the MTU 6 into the exit cell 14.
      <br/>
      In such a case, it is not judged whether the cartridge really exists in the exit cell 14 or the presence-of-cartridge sensor 25 is erroneously detecting a cartridge, but an error is informed to the host unit.
    </p>
    <p num="59">When it is so judged that there is a cartridge though there really is no cartridge in the exit cell 14, the software which control the library unit 12 assumes that a cartridge exist in the exit cell 14 when it does not and control of cartridge is difficult.</p>
    <p num="60">
      2 During an ordinary operation, whether or not the presence-of-cartridge sensor 25 is properly functioning has not been checked.
      <br/>
      Therefore, if the presence-of-cartridge sensor 25 has been broken, a cartridge in the exit cell 14 may not be detected by the presence-of-cartridge sensor 25.
      <br/>
      As a result, it is often judged that there is no cartridge despite there really being a cartridge in the exit cell 14.
    </p>
    <p num="61">
      In such a case, the accessor in the library unit 12 could not access the exit cell 14 since it was judged by the ACL apparatus 5 for attachment to a library unit that there is no cartridge in the exit cell 14.
      <br/>
      Therefore, when it is desired to convey the cartridge to another MTU in the library unit 12, the operator must take out the cartridge from the exit cell in the ACL apparatus 5 for attachment to a library unit and must insert it again into the library unit 12 requiring an increased amount of operation.
    </p>
    <p num="62">
      3 When the cartridge is held in a tilted manner in the entry cell 13 or in the exit cell 14, the presence of the cartridge is not correctly detected, and it is often regarded that no cartridge is present even though there really is a cartridge present.
      <br/>
      This makes it difficult to determine the number of the cartridges by the software that manages the library unit 12.
    </p>
    <p num="63">(3) Correcting the position of the rack (cell) of the cell mechanism.</p>
    <p num="64">Correcting the position of the rack (cell) is as described below.</p>
    <p num="65">1 When the accessor 8 has accessed the rack (cell) of the cell mechanism 10 without correcting the position of the rack of the cell mechanism 10, the accessor 8 is often positioned deviated from the rack and the cartridge is often not pulled into the accessor 8 from the rack.</p>
    <p num="66">
      2 In the above-mentioned case 1, the cartridge can be pulled into the accessor 8 upon retrying.
      <br/>
      However, an extended access time is required since the retrying is effected each time.
    </p>
    <p num="67">3 When the rack and the accessor 8 are deviated from each other, the cartridge is not taken out from the rack or the cartridge is not returned back to the rack, resulting in an error.</p>
    <p num="68">(4) Pushing the leader block.</p>
    <p num="69">The leader block of the cartridge is pushed as described below.</p>
    <p num="70">
      1 The cartridge from which the leader block has been pulled out cannot be loaded into the MTU 6 and is, therefore, discharged without subjecting it to the read/write processing.
      <br/>
      In the ACL apparatus 4 for a single unit, in this case, this fact is reported to the operator to have the leader block pushed in to continue the processing.
      <br/>
      When such an event occurs in the batch job during the night, however, the processing must be interrupted.
    </p>
    <p num="71">
      2 In the ACL apparatus 5 for attachment to a library unit, even when the operator is informed of the fact that the leader block has been pulled out, the cartridge is taken out from the library unit 12 and is processed.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the processing is interrupted during this period often resulting in a tremendous amount of damage.
    </p>
    <p num="72">
      3 In the case of the ACL apparatus 4 for a single unit, the cartridge discharged onto the rack (cell) of the cell mechanism 10 is taken out by hand by the operator from the rack (cell) and is stored.
      <br/>
      Therefore, there arises no problem even if the leader block has been pulled out at the time when the cartridge is discharged.
    </p>
    <p num="73">
      In the ACL apparatus 5 for attachment to a library unit, however, the next processing is automatically carried out without being assisted by the operator.
      <br/>
      When the leader block has been pulled out, therefore, there arises a problem in that the cartridge cannot be loaded into the library unit 12 when the cartridge is taken out from the exit cell 14 in the ACL apparatus 5 for attachment to a library unit and is loaded into the MTU (MTU in the library unit 12) which is not prepared to cope with the cartridges into which the leader block has not been pushed.
    </p>
    <p num="74">(5) Driving the feeder belts.</p>
    <p num="75">
      The cartridge is conveyed from the rack of the cell mechanism 10 to the accessor 8, from the accessor 8 to the MTU 6, and is returned from the MTU 6 back to the accessor 8.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the feeder belts provided in the accessor 8 are driven at the same portions at all times.
      <br/>
      Moreover, the control operation for pushing the leader block so works as to push the leader block and then pulls the cartridge into the accessor 8.
      <br/>
      In this case, too, therefore, the control operation is executed at the same positions at all times.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the feeder belts slip at the same portions only and are conspicuously worn out at these portions but are not worn out at other portions.
    </p>
    <p num="76">(6) Controlling the feeder learning.</p>
    <p num="77">
      The learning control has not been effected for the feeder mechanism in the conventional accessor 8.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the speed of the feeder motors 23 of the accessor 8 varies, friction varies depending upon the cartridges, and the amount of overrunning often increases when the cartridge is pulled into the accessor 8 from the rack of the cell mechanism 10.
    </p>
    <p num="78">
      In this case, when the feeder motors 23 are stopped after the cartridge is detected by the second cell side sensor 39, the cartridge overruns up to a position where it is not detected by the second cell side sensor 39.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the cartridge must be once properly returned back into the accessor 8.
      <br/>
      When the cartridge is discharged from the accessor 8 into the rack of the cell mechanism 10, furthermore, the cartridge overruns in varying amounts.
      <br/>
      Therefore, overrunning of a predetermined amount is not accomplished.
    </p>
    <p num="79">(7) Initializing the cartridge.</p>
    <p num="80">
      So far, the accessor 8 has not been initialized when the power source circuit is closed or when an error has occurred.
      <br/>
      When the power source circuit is closed or when an error has occurred, therefore, it appears that there is no cartridge though a cartridge really exists in the accessor 8.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the accessor 8 ascends or descends in a state where the cartridge has been missed or the cartridge has not been properly held in the accessor 8, causing the cartridge to be broken or the apparatus to be damaged.
    </p>
    <p num="81">(8) Retrying the feeder mechanism.</p>
    <p num="82">
      So far, the cartridge has been fed or returned by the feeder mechanism in the accessor 8.
      <br/>
      When an error occurs in the feeding/returning operation of the cartridge, the accessor 8 is positioned to the cell mechanism 10 or to the MTU 6, and is tried again.
    </p>
    <p num="83">
      When the feeder mechanism is retried, however, the accessor 8 is located at the same position at all times, i.e., located at a position where the rack should exist even though the rack in practice might have deviated (the rack position is not corrected).
      <br/>
      When the rack position is deviated, therefore, the accessor 8 cannot be properly positioned to the deviated rack.
      <br/>
      Despite the feeder mechanism being retried, therefore, the cartridge is neither fed nor returned, and an error occurs.
    </p>
    <p num="84">
      (9) In the conventional apparatus, the cartridge that is to be returned is simply discharged onto the rack to overrun to some extent without detecting where the cartridge is discharged.
      <br/>
      In the conventional control operation, therefore, there is no guarantee that the cartridge has returned back to the rack, and there remains a possibility that the cartridge is erroneously recognized to have returned back to the rack though it has not really returned back to the rack due to some obstacle like damage to the motor.

      When the cartridge is to be discharged (returned) in the conventional apparatus, the cartridge is not controlled for its position (overrunning) but is simply discharged onto the rack.
      <br/>
      In this case, the state of the cartridge (processed/unprocessed state) is displayed on the operator panel but without looking at the operator panel, the operator could not judge whether the cartridge on the rack is the one that has not been processed or not.
      <br/>
      There remains a problem in that if the LED of the operator panel breaks, it becomes difficult to determine whether the cartridge is the one that has not been processed or not.

    <p num="88">
      As an ACL apparatus of the improved version is placed in the market as a new type of ACL apparatus, it becomes necessary to detecting the type of the ACL apparatus.
      <br/>
      So far, this could be coped with by setting data related to the type of the apparatus (data related to the new and old types) in the ACL apparatus or by employing two types of firmware in the new apparatus and in the old apparatus, respectively.
      <br/>
      When the data related to the types of the apparatuses are to be set, however, the operation involves mistakes, and the operator must set the data again requiring a cumbersome operation.

    <p num="171">Description of Other Portions</p>
    <p num="172">(1) Controlling the Catcher to Assume the Middle State--refer to A1 to A7 Above.</p>
    <p num="173">
      The above descriptions A1 to A7 are concerned with controlling the catcher hands 19 to assume the middle state.
      <br/>
      By placing the catcher hands 19 in a middle state which is an intermediate position, the cartridge can be loaded/discharged into the rack by the operator without any trouble, and the apparatus for automatically conveying the cartridges can be operated more efficiently.
      <br/>
      When connected to the library unit, the entry cell can be brought to a position of the same height as the recording/reproducing apparatus (MTU 6), and the time for conveying the cartridge can be shortened.
      <br/>
      This makes it possible to enhance the performance of the apparatus.
    </p>
    <p num="174">(2) Detecting the Presence of the Cartridge--refer to B1 to B6.</p>
    <p num="175">
      The above descriptions B1 to B6 are related to detecting the presence of a cartridge.
      <br/>
      When a cartridge exists on the rack of the exit cell, it is not possible to discharge the cartridge in the recording/reproducing apparatus (MTU 6).
      <br/>
      However, if the presence-of-cartridge detector mechanism is not working properly, it may appear that the cartridge is present on the rack of the exit cell though it is really not present thereon.
    </p>
    <p num="176">Therefore, when the cartridge must be discharged onto the exit cell when the cartridge is present on the rack of the exit cell, the library unit is not stopped at once but, instead, it is confirmed whether the presence-of-cartridge detector mechanism is functioning properly or not.</p>
    <p num="177">
      When the presence-of-cartridge detector mechanism is not functioning properly, the cartridge is discharged onto the rack of the exit cell and, then, the library unit is stopped to convey the cartridge on the side of the library unit to the other recording/reproducing apparatus (MTU 6).
      <br/>
      Thus, the library unit itself is not stopped, and the performance of the apparatus is enhanced and the apparatus can be operated unattended.
    </p>
    <p num="178">
      When the cartridge was loaded onto the rack in an inclined manner, the cartridge, could not be detected and could not be processed.
      <br/>
      According to the present invention, however, the cartridge is gripped again by the catcher hands 19 and is placed straight relative to the rack without creating an error.
      <br/>
      Thus, the cartridge that could not be accessed can now be accessed.
    </p>
    <p num="179">(3) Correcting the Position the Rack of the Cell Mechanism--refer to C1 and C2 Above.</p>
    <p num="180">
      The above descriptions C1 and C2 are related to correcting the rack position.
      <br/>
      In order to correct the rack position, the accessor 8 is brought to a correct position relative to each of the racks at all times.
      <br/>
      This makes it easy to pull the cartridge or to discharge the cartridge.
      <br/>
      Besides, since dispersion in the mounting of the racks or dispersion in the racks themselves can be absorbed by the firmware, the apparatus can be assembled requiring decreased amounts of laborious work.
      <br/>
      This contributes to decreasing the cost of the apparatus and improving the reliability of the apparatus.
    </p>
    <p num="181">(4) Pushing in the Leader Block--refer to D1to D4 Above.</p>
    <p num="182">
      The above descriptions D1to D4 are related to pushing in the leader block.
      <br/>
      The present invention makes it possible to push in the leader block even for a cartridge from which the leader block has been pulled out and which could not be processed.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the processing can be continued.
      <br/>
      Even when the cartridge is connected to the library unit, the apparatus can be operated without being attended.
      <br/>
      Moreover, the leader block that has been pulled out does not cause error, and the reliability of the apparatus can be improved.
    </p>
    <p num="183">(5) Preventing the Feeder Belts from Being Worn out at the Same Portions--refer to E1 Above.</p>
    <p num="184">
      The above description E1 is related to preventing the feeder belts from being worn out at the same portions.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the feeder belts are not partly worn out but are entirely worn out.
      <br/>
      This enables the life of the belts to be lengthened compared with when the belts are worn out only partly, and hence the life of the accessor 8 is extended.
      <br/>
      In maintaining the apparatus, therefore, the belts need be renewed less frequently and the amount of work can be decreased.
    </p>
    <p num="185">(6) Controlling the Feeder Learning--see F1 Above.</p>
    <p num="186">
      The above description F1 is related to controlling the feeder learning.
      <br/>
      The speed of the feeder motors 23 is controlled to remain constant at all times, and the overrunning amount can be set to be constant after the feeder motors 23 are stopped.
      <br/>
      With the overrunning amount being set to be constant even when the cartridge is to be pulled into the accessor 8 from the rack, the cartridge can be correctly pulled into the accessor 8 at all times.
      <br/>
      This eliminates the time for retries and, hence, makes it possible to shorten the time for accessing the cartridge.
    </p>
    <p num="187">
      Besides, the cartridge that is returned back to the rack overruns a predetermined amount and, hence, flies a predetermined amount.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the motor is stopped after a predetermined period of time has passed from when the cartridge is no longer detected by the detector mechanism 2 of the rack side relying upon a simple control operation.
    </p>
    <p num="188">(7) Initializing the Cartridge--Refer to G1 Above.</p>
    <p num="189">
      The above description G1 is related to initializing the cartridge.
      <br/>
      When the power source circuit is closed or an error has occurred, the presence of the cartridge in the accessor 8 is confirmed without breaking the cartridge, without damaging the apparatus and without missing the cartridge.
      <br/>
      Thus, reliability of the apparatus is enhanced.
    </p>
    <p num="190">(8) Retrying the Feeder Mechanism--refer to H1 Above.</p>
    <p num="191">
      The above description H1 is related to retrying the feeder mechanism.
      <br/>
      The retrying operation of the present invention makes it possible to recover from an erroneous state.
      <br/>
      It does not happen that the cartridge is not accessible, and reliability is improved.
      <br/>
      Even when connected to the library unit, it does not happen that the apparatus cannot access the cartridge, and the apparatus as a whole is not stopped.
    </p>
    <p num="192">(9) Returning the Cartridge--refer to I1 Above.</p>
    <p num="193">
      The above description is concerned with returning the cartridge.
      <br/>
      When the cartridge that was being returned back to the rack was not detected by the detector mechanisms 1, 2 of the rack side, there was a probability that the cartridge may be missed even when it is not properly placed on the cell.
      <br/>
      According to the present invention, however, the cartridge is not missed and reliability is improved.
    </p>
    <p num="194">(10) Controlling the Position of the Cartridge--see J1 Above.</p>
    <p num="195">
      The above description J1 is related to controlling the position of cartridge.
      <br/>
      According to the present invention, the cartridge after being processed is popped up more toward the rack than the cartridge that has not been processed, and the operator is allowed to discern at a glance whether the cartridge has been processed or not.
      <br/>
      This contributes to greatly enhancing the operation efficiency.
    </p>
    <p num="196">(11) Discriminating the Type of the Apparatus--see K1 Above.</p>
    <p num="197">
      The above description K1 is related to discriminating the type of the apparatus.
      <br/>
      The type of the accessor 8 is automatically discriminated by the firmware.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the operator need not set the kind of the accessor.
      <br/>
      Even when the operator has forgotten the setting, it does not matter.
      <br/>
      Thus, one firmware suffices.

    <heading>DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
    <p num="199">
      An embodiment of the present invention will now be described in detail with reference to the drawings.
      <br/>
      The ACL (automatic cartridge loading) apparatus that will be described below is either an ACL apparatus for a single unit or an ACL apparatus for attachment to a library unit.
      <br/>
      The ACL apparatus for a single unit is used in combination with the MTU and automatically conveys the cartridge to the MTU.
      <br/>
      The ACL apparatus for attachment to a library unit is used in combination with the MTU and is further coupled to a library unit.
      <br/>
      The accessor mechanism in the ACL apparatus is common for the ACL apparatus for a single unit and for the ACL apparatus for attachment to a library unit.
    </p>
    <p num="200">.sctn.1: Constitution of the ACL Apparatus for a Single Unit, see FIGS. 3 to 4B.</p>
    <p num="201">
      FIG. 3 is a front view of an ACL apparatus for a single unit, FIG. 4A is a side view 1 of the ACL apparatus for a single unit, and FIG. 4B is a side view 2 of the ACL apparatus for a single unit.
      <br/>
      The constitution of the ACL apparatus 4 for a single unit will now be described with reference to FIGS. 3 to 4B.
    </p>
    <p num="202">
      The ACL apparatus 4 for a single unit is combined with the MTU (magnetic tape unit) 6 as a unitary structure, the MTU 6 being disposed on the side of the back surface of the ACL apparatus 4 for a single unit.
      <br/>
      In the ACL apparatus 4 for a single unit are provided a cell mechanism 10 and an accessor mechanism, the cell mechanism 10 being disposed on the side of the front surface and the accessor mechanism being disposed on the back side of the cell mechanism 10.
      <br/>
      In this case, the accessor mechanism is disposed between the cell mechanism 10 and the MTU 6.
    </p>
    <p num="203">
      The cell mechanism 10 is provided with many racks (or cells) 11, and a cartridge will be held in each of these racks 11.
      <br/>
      Many rails are provided running up and down maintaining a predetermined distance on both inner sides of the side plates constituting the cell mechanism 10, and rack plates are inserted along these rails to constitute the racks 11.
      <br/>
      A flag 26 for detecting the presence of a cartridge is provided at a portion of the racks 11.
    </p>
    <p num="204">
      The plurality of racks 11 of the cell mechanism 10 permit the operator to insert or discharge the cartridge from the outer side (from the front side) by hand.
      <br/>
      In the ACL apparatus 4 for a single unit, the accessor mechanism takes out the cartridge from the rack and conveys it to the MTU 6, or conveys the cartridge processed by the MTU 6 and discharges it onto the rack 11.
    </p>
    <p num="205">The accessor mechanism is constituted by an accessor 8 which grips a cartridge and moves to convey it, a shaft 9 for raising/lowering the accessor 8, a motor for raising/lowering the accessor, a belt and gears.</p>
    <p num="206">.sctn.2: Constitution of the ACL Apparatus for Attachment to a Library Unit--see FIGS. 5 to 7.</p>
    <p num="207">
      FIG. 5 is a front view of the ACL apparatus for attachment to a library unit, FIG. 6 is a side view 1 of the ACL apparatus for attachment to a library unit, and FIG. 7 is a side view 2 of the ACL apparatus for attachment to a library unit.
      <br/>
      Constitution of the ACL apparatus for attachment to a library unit will now be described with reference to FIGS. 5 to 7.
    </p>
    <p num="208">
      The ACL apparatus 5 for attachment to a library unit is combined with the MTU (magnetic tape unit) 6 as a unitary structure and is mechanically (detachably) coupled to a library unit 29.
      <br/>
      Here, the ACL apparatus 5 for attachment to a library unit is provided with the cell mechanism 10 and the accessor mechanism, the cell mechanism 10 being disposed on the side of the library unit 29 and the accessor mechanism being disposed on the side of the MTU 6.
    </p>
    <p num="209">
      The cell mechanism 10 is provided with an entry cell 13 and an exit cell 14.
      <br/>
      The entry cell 13 and the exit cell 14 have constitutions corresponding to the cell mechanism 10 of the ACL apparatus 4 for a single unit but in which a rack plate is provided at a position of the entry cell 13 and a rack plate is provided at a position of the exit cell 14, and the rack plates are removed from other portions.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the entry cell 13 has one rack and the exit cell 14 has one rack.
    </p>
    <p num="210">
      The ACL apparatus 5 for attachment to a library unit has the library unit 29 coupled to the side of the cell mechanism 10 and has the MTU 6 provided on the side of the accessor mechanism, so that the cartridge can be automatically handed over from the library unit 29 through the cell mechanism 10.
      <br/>
      The accessor mechanism is the same as that of the ACL apparatus 4 for a single unit.
    </p>
    <p num="211">
      The entry cell 13 is an inlet port for inserting the cartridge from the side of the library unit 29, and the exit cell 14 is a discharge port for discharging the cartridge processed by the MTU 6 through the ACL apparatus 5 for attachment to a library unit.
      <br/>
      The ACL apparatus 5 for attachment to a library unit has a leader block pushing member 30 at a position (MTU 6 side) of a height of the exit cell 14 to push the leader block.
    </p>
    <p num="212">.sctn.3: Leader Block Pushing Member--see FIGS. 8A to 8C.</p>
    <p num="213">
      FIGS. 8A to 8C are diagrams illustrating a leader block pushing member, wherein the FIG. 8A is a general view and the diagram B is a detailed view.

    <p num="214">
      As shown, the ACL apparatus 5 for attachment to a library unit is provided with a leader block pushing member 30 in a portion of the side of the MTU 6 at the height of the exit cell 14.
      <br/>
      When the leader block has been pulled out from the cartridge, the leader block pushing member 30 brings the accessor 8 that is gripping the cartridge to the position of the exit cell (same position as the leader block pushing member 30), pushes the leader block of the cartridge into the cartridge.
    </p>
    <p num="215">
      The leader block pushing member 30 is a plate-like member, has a protruded portion 32 at the center thereof, and has holes 31 in both sides thereof for attachment.
      <br/>
      Screws are inserted in the holes 31 to secure it to a portion of the ACL apparatus 5 for attachment to a library.
      <br/>
      The protruded portion 32 is pushed onto the leader block of the cartridge to push it thereinto.

    </p>
    <p num="218">In this system, provision is made of a plurality of MTU units 34 each mounting four MTU's and ACL apparatuses 5 for attachment to a library unit for each of the MTU's, the MTU units 34 being coupled to the library unit 29 using screws.</p>
    <p num="219">
      In this system, therefore, each MTU unit 34 is provided with four ACL apparatuses 5 for attachment to a library unit, and the library unit 29 is provided with an entry cell 13 and an exit cell 14.

    <p num="220">In this case, the library unit 12 is equipped with a cell (rack) mechanism for storing a number of cartridges, a plurality of MTU units (magnetic tape units), an accessor mechanism for automatically conveying cartridges to the cell mechanism and to the MTU units, and a cartridge access station (CAS) for automatically loading and discharging the cartridges.</p>
    <p num="221">
      When this system is used, the processing is executed as described below.
      <br/>
      That is, when it is desired to process the cartridge stored on the side of the library unit 12 by an MTU on the side of the MTU unit 34, the accessor mechanism in the library unit 12 conveys the cartridge and inserts it in the entry cell 13 of the ACL apparatus 5 for attachment to a library unit.
      <br/>
      Thereafter, the cartridge in the entry cell 13 is conveyed by the accessor mechanism in the ACL apparatus 5 for attachment to a library unit, inserted in the MTU in the MTU unit 34, and is subjected to the read/write processing.
    </p>
    <p num="222">
      The cartridge after the processing is conveyed by the accessor mechanism in the ACL apparatus 5 for attachment to a library unit and is discharged onto the exit cell 14.
      <br/>
      Thereafter, the cartridge is taken out from the exit cell 14 by the accessor mechanism in the library unit 12 and is stored in the cell mechanism in the library unit 12.

      <br/>
      The constitution and function of the accessor will now be described with reference to FIGS. 14 to 20F.
    </p>
    <p num="230">
      The accessor mechanism is provided with an accessor 8 which grips a cartridge and moves to convey it.
      <br/>
      The accessor 8 is provided with catcher hands 19, a catcher motor 21, feeder motors 23 (two), a presence-of-cartridge sensor 25, a first cell side sensor 38, a second cell side sensor 39, a catcher open sensor 40, a catcher close sensor 41, feeder belts 43, a catcher open/close sensor flag 44, a cartridge return sensor 45, and a cartridge return detector flag 46.
    </p>
    <p num="231">
      The accessor 8 does not turn on a horizontal plane but ascends or descends being driven by the motor provided on the accessor mechanism.
      <br/>
      One of the catcher hands 19 provided in the accessor 8 faces the cell mechanism 10 and the other one faces the MTU 6.
      <br/>
      The catcher hands 19 are driven to assume a catcher open state, a catcher middle state or a catcher closed state.
      <br/>
      The catcher open state and the catcher closed state are always reversed depending upon the side of the cell mechanism 10 and the side of the MTU 6.
      <br/>
      Described below are the functions of the above-mentioned portions.
    </p>
    <p num="232">
      (1) The catcher hands 19 grip or release the cartridge.
      <br/>
      The catcher hands 19 are driven by the catcher motor 21, and turn about a center shaft 20 to assume the catcher open state (FIGS. 20A and 20B), a catcher middle state (FIGS. 20C and 20D) or a catcher closed state (FIGS. 20E and 20F).

      In the catcher open state, the side of the cell mechanism is opened and the side of the MTU 6 is closed.
      <br/>
      In the catcher closed state, the side of the cell mechanism 10 is closed and the side of the MTU 6 is opened.
      <br/>
      In the catcher middle state, furthermore, both the side of the cell mechanism 10 and the side of the MTU 6 are in the catcher middle state.
    </p>
    <p num="234">In the following description, the "catcher open state" stands for a state where the side of the cell mechanism 10 is opened and the side of the MTU 6 is closed, and the "closed state" stands for a state where the side of the cell mechanism 10 is closed and the side of the MTU 6 is opened.</p>
    <p num="235">
      (2) The catcher motor 21 drives the catcher hands 19.
      <br/>
      That is, by changing the direction of rotation and the rotational position of the catcher motor 21, the catcher hands 19 are opened, closed, or brought to the middle state.
    </p>
    <p num="236">(3) The feeder motors 23 change the direction of rotation (clockwise/counterclockwise) and drive the feeder belts 43, in order to pull (feed) a cartridge on the rack of the cell mechanism 10 into the accessor 8 or to discharge (return) the cartridge from the accessor onto a rack of the cell mechanism 10.</p>
    <p num="237">
      (4) The presence-of-cartridge sensor 25 detects a cartridge on a rack of the cell mechanism 10.

      The presence-of-cartridge sensor 25 is further capable of detecting a rack of the cell mechanism 10.
      <br/>
      The detection of deviation of rack position is utilized for correcting the rack position when the accessor 8 is to be positioned to the rack.
    </p>
    <p num="238">
      (5) The first cell side sensor 38 and the second cell side sensor 39 detect whether there is a cartridge in the accessor 8 or not.

      Furthermore, these sensors are used for detecting the cartridge at the time when it is being pulled/discharged (fed/returned).
    </p>
    <p num="239">
      (6) The catcher open sensor 40 detects the open state of the catcher hands 19 in response to the motion of the catcher open/close sensor flag 44, and comprises a light-emitting portion and a light-receiving portion.

      The catcher open sensor 40 is turned on when a flag piece (described later) of the catcher open/close sensor flag 44 is inserted between the light-emitting portion and the light-receiving portion, and is turned off when the flag piece is in a state of not being inserted between the light-emitting portion and the light-receiving portion.

    <p num="241">(8) The catcher open/close sensor flag 44 is driven by the catcher motor 21, and is detected by the catcher open sensor 40 or the catcher closure sensor 41 (see FIGS. 16B and 16C, and FIGS. 20A to 20F).</p>
    <p num="242">
      A center shaft 50 is provided in the body of the catcher open/close sensor flag 44, and is rotated by the catcher motor 21.
      <br/>
      About the center shaft 50 are provided a first flag piece 51, a second flag piece 52 and a third flag piece 53 maintaining a gap of about 90 (degree) .
    </p>
    <p num="243">
      In this case, when the first flag piece 51 has a length L1, the second flag piece 52 has a length L2 and the third flag piece 53 has a length L3, then a relationship L1=L3&lt;L2 is maintained.
      <br/>
      That is, the second flag piece 52 has the length L2 longer than the lengths L1, L3 of other flag pieces.

    <p num="244">
      In the catcher open state (catcher motor 21 is at rest) shown in FIGS. 20A and 20B, the catcher open/close sensor flag 44 is at a position shown.
      <br/>
      In this case, the catcher open sensor 40 is turned on upon detecting the third flag piece 53, and the catcher closure sensor 41 remains turned off upon detecting none of the flag pieces.
    </p>
    <p num="245">
      As the catcher open/close sensor flag 44 turns in the direction of arrow from the above-mentioned state and assumes the catcher middle state as shown in FIGS. 20C and 20D, the catcher open sensor 40 is turned on upon detecting the first flag piece 51, and the catcher closure sensor 41 is turned on upon detecting the second flag piece 52.
      <br/>
      As the catcher open/close sensor flag 44 further rotates from this state into the catcher closed state shown in FIGS. 20E and 20F, the catcher open sensor 40 is turned off upon detecting none of the flag pieces, and the catcher closure sensor 41 is turned on upon detecting the third flag piece 53.

    <p num="246">
      (9) The feeder belts 43 are driven by the feeder motors 23.
      <br/>
      Accompanying the motion of the feeder belts 43, the cartridge is pulled (fed) into the accessor 8 or is discharged (returned) onto the rack of the cell mechanism 10.
      <br/>
      The feeder belts 43 are provided on the right side and on the left side, and are driven by the right and left feeder motors 23 to carry out the opening/closing operation together with the catcher hands 19.
    </p>
    <p num="247">When, for example, the cartridge is fed (pulled into the accessor 8) from the cell mechanism 10, the catcher hands 19 are closed to grip the cartridge which is then conveyed into the accessor 8 by turning the feeder belts 43 (the cartridge is conveyed by the frictional force of the feeder belts 43) and is fed.</p>
    <p num="248">When the cartridge is to be returned (discharged from the accessor 8) onto the rack of the cell mechanism 10, furthermore, the catcher hands 19 are closed and the feeder belts 43 are turned in the direction opposite to that of the feeding thereby to return the cartridge.</p>
    <p num="249">
      (10) The cartridge return sensor 45 and cartridge return detector flag 46 are provided near the end of the catcher hands 19, and detect the cartridge that is discharged (returned) from the accessor 8.
      <br/>
      The cartridge return sensor 45 and the cartridge return detector flag 46 are constructed as shown in FIGS. 19A to 19D.
    </p>
    <p num="250">As shown, a flag roller 47 is provided at the end of the cartridge return detector flag 46, and is allowed to turn in the directions of arrows a and b in FIG. 19A. When there is no cartridge at the position of the flag roller 47, the flag roller 47 turns in the direction b due to the restoring force of a return spring.</p>
    <p num="251">
      As the cartridge comes to the position of the flag roller 47, the flag roller 47 is pushed by the cartridge and turns in the direction a. Furthermore, at the rear end of the flag roller 47 is provided a flag end piece 48 that is bent at right angles with respect to the main body of the flag roller 47.
      <br/>
      The flag end piece 48 turns in a direction opposite to the flag roller 47.
    </p>
    <p num="252">That is, the cartridge return detector flag 46 is supported to turn about the center shaft between the flag roller 47 and the flag end piece 48, and the flag roller 47 and the flag end piece 48 are turned in the opposite directions by the cartridge.</p>
    <p num="253">
      The cartridge return sensor 45 is an optical sensor comprising a light-emitting portion and a light-receiving portion, and the flag end piece 48 of the cartridge return detector flag 46 is inserted or not inserted between the light-emitting portion and the light-receiving portion.
      <br/>
      When the flag end piece 48 is inserted between the light-emitting portion and the light-receiving portion, the light from the light-emitting portion no longer falls on the light-receiving portion, and the sensor is turned off.
      <br/>
      When the flag end piece 48 is not inserted between the light-emitting portion and the light-receiving portion, the sensor is turned on.
    </p>
    <p num="254">When the cartridge is discharged (returned) from the accessor 8 onto the rack of the cell mechanism 10, the side surface of the cartridge first pushes the flag roller 47 toward the direction as it is being discharged, whereby the flag roller 47 turns in the direction a. In this case, the flag end piece 48 is not inserted between the light-emitting portion and the light-receiving portion, and the cartridge return sensor 45 is turned on.</p>
    <p num="255">Next, as the cartridge is discharged onto the rack of the cell mechanism 10, the flag roller 47 is no longer pushed by the cartridge and turns in the direction b. Therefore, the flag end piece 48 is inserted between the light-emitting portion and the light-receiving portion, and the cartridge return sensor 45 is turned off.</p>

    <p num="294">Controlling the catcher to assume the middle state will now be described with reference to FIGS. 23 to 29. The control operation is carried out in a manner as described below so that the catcher hands 19 of the accessor 8 assume the middle state (referred to as "catcher middle state") at an intermediate position which is neither the open state nor the closed state.</p>
    <p num="295">(1) Outline for controlling the catcher to assume the middle state.</p>
    <p num="296">a) The ACL apparatus is provided with the accessor 8 which includes the catcher hands 19 for gripping a cartridge, the catcher open sensor 40 (the detector mechanism including this sensor is often referred to as "open detector mechanism") for detecting the open state of the catcher hands 19, and the catcher closure sensor 41 (the detector mechanism including this sensor is often referred to as "closure detector mechanism") for detecting the closed state of the catcher hands 19.</p>
    <p num="297">
      By using the above two sensors, the catcher hands 19 are controlled to assume the middle state which is neither the open state nor the closed state, i.e., to assume the intermediate state between the open state and the closed state.
      <br/>
      The catcher hands in the middle state can be detected by the above two sensors simultaneously, and are controlled by the catcher motor 21.
    </p>
    <p num="298">b) When the catcher hands 19 are to be shifted from the open state to the middle state, the catcher motor 21 is rotated at a speed slower than the ordinary speed, i.e., the catcher motor 21 is supplied with a low drive voltage.</p>
    <p num="299">
      c) In the above control operation b), the drive voltage applied to the catcher motor 21 is PWM-controlled (pulse width modulation) in which the current is permitted to flow or is not permitted to flow in a certain period.
      <br/>
      Owing to this control operation, the rotational speed of the catcher motor 21 is delayed, so that the above two sensors will reliably detect the catcher hands.
      <br/>
      The PWM control operation is carried out by the PWM control unit 96.
    </p>
    <p num="300">d) After the catcher hands have assumed the middle state, the PWM control unit 96 executes the PWM control operation to pass a further decreased current, so that the catcher hands 19 will not move but are held at the intermediate position.</p>
    <p num="301">
      e) When catcher open or catcher closed has not yet been determined immediately after the closure of the power source circuit, the OFF-ON-OFF-ON of the sensors may not have been determined yet (such as when the power source circuit is interrupted at the intermediate position).

      FIG. 23 is a flowchart for controlling the catcher hands to assume the middle state, and FIGS. 24A and 20B are timing charts wherein FIG. 24A is an ideal timing chart for detecting open/closure of when the flag pieces have the same length and FIG. 24B is a timing chart for detecting open/closure of when the lengths of the flag pieces are set to be the same.
      <br/>
      The operation for controlling the catcher hands to assume the middle state will now be described with reference to FIGS. 23 to 24B, wherein S1 to S5 denote steps of processing.
    </p>
    <p num="307">
      To control the catcher hands 19 to assume the middle state, the catcher motor 21 is PWM-controlled by the PWM control unit 96 provided in the motor control unit 95.
      <br/>
      First, the catcher hands 19 are brought to the catcher open state (cell side is opened)(S1) and, then, the PWM control unit 96 sets a drive PWM value (smaller than an ordinary PWM value) to bring the catcher hands 19 to the middle state (S2), and the catcher motor 21 is driven (S3).
    </p>
    <p num="308">In this case, when the catcher hands 19 are brought to the catcher open state and are, then, shifted to the catcher middle state, the PWM control operation is carried out to drive the catcher motor 21 at a rotational speed slower than the ordinary speed, i.e., to apply a drive voltage lower than the ordinary drive voltage to the catcher motor 21.</p>
    <p num="309">At a moment (S4) at which the catcher hands are simultaneously detected by the catcher open sensor 40 and the catcher closure sensor 41 (which are simultaneously turned on) the PWM control unit 96 sets a PWM value for passing a very small current to the catcher motor 21 to maintain the catcher middle state (S5).</p>
    <p num="310">
      After the catcher middle state is assumed due to the thus set PWM value, a very small current is supplied to the catcher motor 21 so that the catcher hands 19 will not move but are held at the catcher middle state.
      <br/>
      Thus, the catcher middle state is stably maintained.
    </p>
    <p num="311">
      In the catcher middle state as shown in FIGS. 20C and 20D, the catcher open sensor 40 is turned on upon detecting the first flag piece 51, and the catcher closure sensor 41 is turned on upon detecting the second flag piece 52.
      <br/>
      In this case, since the second flag piece 52 is longer than the first flag piece 51, the catcher closure sensor 41 is necessarily turned on when the catcher open sensor 40 is turned on.

      FIGS. 24A and 24B show timing charts of when the flag pieces all have the same length in the catcher open/close sensor flag 44.

      In FIGS. 24A and 24B, in this case, the open detector mechanism including the catcher open sensor 40 is denoted as "open detector mechanism" and the closure detector mechanism including the catcher closure sensor 41 is denoted as "closure detector mechanism".
    </p>
    <p num="313">In an ideal state as shown in FIG. 24A, the catcher open sensor 40 (open detector mechanism) and the catcher closure sensor 41 (closure detector mechanism) simultaneously detect the flag piece and are turned on in the catcher middle state.</p>
    <p num="314">
      In practice, however, a deviation occurs between a timing of detection by the catcher open sensor 40 (open detector mechanism) and a timing of detection by the catcher closure sensor 41 (closure detector mechanism).
      <br/>
      That is, the timing chart shown in FIG. 24B is the one when the open state is detected first.
      <br/>
      Even when the catcher hands are controlled to assume the middle state, the catcher open sensor 40 detects the flag piece first and the catcher closure sensor 41 detects the flag piece after being slightly delayed.
      <br/>
      Therefore, a deviation occurs between the two detection timings.
    </p>
    <p num="315">
      When the catcher motor 21 is driven from the catcher open state as described above, the catcher open sensor 40 detects the flag piece first and, hence, it appears that the catcher open state has been established for a period of several milliseconds though the catcher open state has not really been established.
      <br/>
      When the catcher hands pass through the catcher middle state, furthermore, the catcher open sensor 40 discontinues the detection, first, and the catcher closure sensor 41 only detects the flag piece, so that it appears that the catcher closed state is established.
    </p>
    <p num="316">The above-mentioned inconvenience can be eliminated by selecting the length of the second flag piece 52 to be longer than the length of the first flag piece 51 as described above.</p>

      When the catcher hands are to be closed from the catcher open state, the detection of the catcher closure sensor 41 (closure detector mechanism) changes in a manner of detection --&gt; non-detection --&gt; detection when the catcher hands are shifted from the catcher closed state (closure detecting state) to the catcher middle state.
      <br/>
      Then, as the catcher hands pass through the catcher middle state, the detection changes in a manner of detection --&gt; non-detection, and the catcher hands 19 assume the open state.
    </p>
    <p num="320">
      Then, the catcher motor 21 is driven from the catcher closed state (closure detector mechanism is in the detecting state) toward the catcher open direction (S12).

    <p num="322">
      FIG. 26A shows a timing chart for PWM control.

      In the PWM control by the PWM control unit 96, a period PWM (a period of clock) is set to be 100%.
      <br/>
      When it is desired to control the drive voltage for the catcher motor 21 by n%, a current of n% is supplied to the catcher motor 21.
      <br/>
      That is, a current flows while the PWM waveform is in the off state and, hence, the off period is set to be n% of one period.
      <br/>
      It is thus possible to adjust the voltage applied to the catcher motor 21.

      FIG. 26B shows a timing chart for open/closure detection (when the second flag piece only is lengthened).

      When the first flag piece 51 has a length L1, the second flag piece 52 has a length L2 and the third flag piece 53 has a length L3 in the catcher open/close sensor flag 44 as described earlier, the relationship L1=L3&lt;L2 holds.

      In the catcher middle state, the catcher closure sensor 41 is turned on upon detecting the second flag piece 52 (closure detector mechanism is detecting) and the catcher open sensor 40 is turned on upon detecting the first flag piece 51 (open detector mechanism is detecting).
      <br/>
      Since the above-mentioned relationship is maintained between the flag pieces, the period in which the catcher closure sensor 41 is detecting becomes longer than a period (detection time or detection width) in which the catcher open sensor 40 is detecting.
      <br/>
      When the catcher open sensor 40 is turned on (open detector mechanism is detecting), therefore, the catcher closure sensor 41 is necessarily turned on (closure detector mechanism is detecting).

    <p num="326">That is, in the catcher middle state as shown in FIG. 2B, the catcher open sensor 40 and the catcher closure sensor 41 are necessarily in the detecting state (turned on), and the catcher open sensor 40 assumes the detecting state only in the catcher open state.</p>
    <p num="327">

      Thereafter, the control operation is so carried out as to establish the catcher closed state.

      A detection signal of the presence-of-cartridge sensor 25 is fed to the ACL control unit 81 to determine whether there is a cartridge on the rack or not.

      FIG. 31 is a flowchart for detecting the presence of a cartridge when it is to be discharged onto the exit cell (with the ACL apparatus being connected to the library unit).
      <br/>
      Described below with reference to FIG. 31 is the operation for detecting the presence of a cartridge when it is to be discharged onto the exit cell (with the ACL apparatus being connected to the library unit).

      The cartridge is discharged onto the exit cell 14 after having detected the presence of a cartridge on the exit cell 14.
      <br/>
      The control operation in this case is carried out as described below.
      <br/>
      First, the ACL control unit 81 brings the accessor 8 to a position of the exit cell 14 (S71), and the presence-of-cartridge detector mechanism (presence-of-cartridge sensor 25) detects the cartridge (S72).
      <br/>
      As a result, when no cartridge is detected, the cartridge is discharged onto the exit cell 14 (S77) to end the operation.
    </p>
    <p num="370">
      In an ordinary library unit, in this case, the next cartridge is never loaded while a cartridge exists on the exit cell 14.
      <br/>
      Therefore, when no cartridge is detected on the exit cell 14 at step S72, the cartridge is discharged.
    </p>
    <p num="371">
      When the cartridge is detected at step S72, however, the cartridge is not discharged onto the exit cell 14.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the ACL control unit 81 brings the accessor 8 to a position where the cartridge will not be detected by the presence-of-cartridge detector mechanism (S73) and determines whether the cartridge is not detected at this position (S74).
    </p>
    <p num="372">
      When the cartridge is detected, the ACL control unit 81 determines that the presence-of-cartridge detector mechanism is broken and informs the host unit of the fact that the presence-of-cartridge detector mechanism has been broken (S76).
      <br/>
      Thereafter, the ACL control unit 81 brings the accessor 8 again to the position of the exit cell 14 and discharges the cartridge onto the exit cell 14 (S77).
      <br/>
      When the cartridge is not detected at step S74, however, the host unit is informed of that there is a cartridge on the exit cell 14, and is informed of an error (S75).
    </p>
    <p num="373">
      That is, the presence or absence of the cartridge is detected at step S72.
      <br/>
      When the presence of cartridge is detected, it is checked whether the presence-of-cartridge detector works properly.
      <br/>
      For this purpose, the accessor 8 is brought to a position where the cartridge will not be detected by the presence-of-cartridge detector mechanism to confirm whether the cartridge is not detected.
      <br/>
      When the detector mechanism is properly working, then, a cartridge exists on the exit cell 14, and the host unit is informed of the presence of cartridge on the exit cell 14 and of an error.
    </p>
    <p num="374">When a cartridge is detected at step S74, furthermore, the ACL control unit 81 so judges that the presence-of-cartridge detector mechanism has been broken and informs the host unit of the breakage of the presence-of-cartridge detector mechanism (S76) and discharges the cartridge onto the exit cell 14 (S77).</p>

    <p num="376">Described below is the control operation for correcting the rack position of the cell mechanism.</p>
    <p num="377">(1): Outline of the operation for correcting the rack position.</p>
    <p num="378">
      The racks 11 of the cell mechanism 10 in the ACL apparatus (racks of the entry cell 13 and exit cell 14 in the ACL apparatus 5 for attachment to a library) may not be present at the positions where they should be present due to the mechanically mounted state of the rack and dispersion in the thickness of the racks.
      <br/>
      That is, the practical rack positions may often be deviated to some extent from the positions where they should be present.
      <br/>
      To bring the accessor 8 to the rack positions, therefore, a deviation in the position of the rack must be corrected.
    </p>
    <p num="379">
      In the control operation for correcting the rack position, therefore, the presence-of-cartridge detector mechanism or the presence-of-cartridge sensor 25 detects the positions of the racks of the cell mechanism 10.
      <br/>
      By utilizing the presence-of-cartridge detector sensor 25, therefore, a practical rack position is detected while moving the accessor 8, and a difference is found from a position where the rack should be present in order to execute the processing for correcting the rack position.
    </p>
    <p num="380">
      When the accessor 8 is to be brought to a position of a rack of the cell mechanism 10 during the ordinary operation, the control operation for positioning is carried out while correcting the rack position by using the above-mentioned difference as a correction value.
      <br/>
      The operation for correcting the rack position is automatically carried out by the ACL control unit 81 by using the presence-of-cartridge sensor 25.
      <br/>
      In an apparatus not equipped with the rack position detector mechanism, however, the rack position is manually corrected by the operator.
    </p>
    <p num="381">
      In such an apparatus, the ACL apparatus is provided, on a portion of the housing thereof, with a screw (for effecting fine adjustment) to ascend or descend the accessor 8 by manual operation.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, the operator panel 64 is provided with a switch SWI for manually opening or closing the catcher hands 19 of the accessor 8 and with a switch SW2 for determining a correction value for the rack position.
      <br/>
      The rack position is corrected by manipulating the string screw and switches SW1, SW2.
      <br/>
      The switch SW1, in its off state, executes no operation but executes, in its on state, the operation by which the catcher hands 19 are opened --&gt; closed --&gt; opened --&gt; closed . . . repetitively and continuously.
    </p>
    <p num="382">In the rack position correction by the manual operation, any rack of the cell mechanism 10 is set as a reference rack, the accessor 8 is positioned, first, to the reference rack, the string screw provided on the ACL apparatus is turned by hand to ascend or descend the accessor 8 so that it is brought to a desired position.</p>
    <p num="383">
      The switch SW1 provided on the operator panel 64 is manupulated to open or close the catcher hands 19, and it is confirmed whether a desired position is accomplished.
      <br/>
      After the position is confirmed, the switch SW2 of the operator panel 64 is manipulated to input the data for determining a correction value for the rack position.
    </p>
    <p num="384">
      As the data for setting a correction value is input by manipulating the switch SW2 as described above, the ACL control unit 81 calculates a correction value at the position of the accessor 8.
      <br/>
      When the correction value is within a range in which the correction can be accomplished, the rack position is corrected and the correction value is stored in the work memory 94.
      <br/>
      In the ordinary operation, thereafter, the correction value for the rack position stored in the work memory 94 is used for controlling the positioning of the accessor 8.
      <br/>
      No matter how many reference racks exist, each rack position is corrected in the same manner as described above.
    </p>
    <p num="385">
      When the power source circuit is broken, the above-mentioned correction value may be stored in the EEPROM 107 which is a nonvolatile memory.
      <br/>
      When the power source circuit is closed in the next time, the correction value may be read out by the work memory 94 to execute the control operation.
      <br/>
      Here, when the correction value is corrected again, the correction value in the EEPROM 107 is replaced by a newly corrected value.

    <p num="386">(2) A tachometer value latch circuit for correcting the rack position--see FIG. 32.</p>
    <p num="387">
      FIG. 32 is a block diagram illustrating in detail the tachometer value latch circuit.
      <br/>
      Use is made of the circuit shown in FIG. 32 for latching the tachometer value at the time when the presence-of-cartridge detector mechanism has produced an output.
    </p>
    <p num="388">
      This circuit is constituted by a counter 101, an AND circuit 102, an OR circuit 103, a flip-flop circuit (hereinafter referred to as "FF") 104 and an output circuit 105.
      <br/>
      The following signals are input to the tachometer value latch circuit 100.
      <br/>
      That is, 1 a tachometer value and 2 a reset signal are input to the counter 101, 3 the output of the presence-of-cartridge detector mechanism and 4 a latch enable signal are input to the AND circuit (&amp; circuit) 102, and 5 an address (*XXXXH) and 6 a read signal (RD) are input to the OR circuit 103.
    </p>
    <p num="389">
      The tachometer value 1 is an output of a tachometer (value measured by the tachometer) which is provided in the accessor mechanism and counts the number of revolutions of a motor that ascends or descends the accessor 8.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the tachometer value represents a distance by which the accessor 8 has ascended or descended.
      <br/>
      The reset signal 2 is the one (having either a high level "1" or a low level "0") output from the MPU 91 in the ACL control unit 81.
      <br/>
      When the reset signal assumes "1", the counter 101 is reset (cleared).
    </p>
    <p num="390">
      The output 3 of the presence-of-cartridge detector mechanism is output from the presence-of-cartridge sensor 25, and is processed through the level comparator 83 and the sensor control unit 98, and is input to the tachometer value latch circuit 100.
      <br/>
      The output 3 of the presence-of-cartridge detector mechanism assumes the high level "1" when the rack of the cell mechanism 10 is detected by the presence-of-cartridge detector sensor 25 and assumes the low level "0" when no rack is detected (e.g., the signal assumes the high level "1" depending upon the rise or break of the output signal of the presence-of-cartridge sensor 25).
    </p>
    <p num="391">
      The latch enable signal 4 is output from the MPU 91 in the ACL control unit 81, and assumes the high level 1 in the latch enable state and assumes the low level 0 in other state.
      <br/>
      The address 5 (*XXXXH) and the read signal 6 (*RD) are output from the MPU 91 in the ACL control unit 81.
    </p>
    <p num="392">
      In the tachometer value latch circuit 100, the counter 101 is reset (cleared) as the reset signal 2 assumes "1" and counts the tachometer value as the reset signal 2 assumes "0".
      <br/>
      The FF 104 is cleared when the AND circuit 102 produces an output of the low level "0", and latches the counter value (tachometer value) of the counter 101 when the output 3 of the presence-of-cartridge detector mechanism assumes "1", the latch enable signal 4 assumes "1" and the output of the AND circuit 102 assumes "1".
    </p>
    <p num="393">
      When the address 5 or the read signal 6 assumes "1", the output circuit 105 reads (takes in) the data latched by the FF 104, and puts the data onto a data bus so as to be recognized by the MPU 91.
      <br/>
      For instance, the MPU 91 sends the read signal 6 to the tachometer value latch circuit 100 and reads the data (tachometer value) on the data bus to recognize the tachometer value.

    <p num="394">(3) Correcting the rack position of the cell mechanism--see FIG. 33.</p>
    <p num="395">
      FIG. 33 is a flowchart for correcting the rack position.
      <br/>
      The control operation for correcting the rack position (in the case of single unit=ACL apparatus for a single unit+MTU) will now be described with reference to FIG. 33 wherein S81 to S91 denote steps of the process.
    </p>
    <p num="396">
      When the rack position of the cell mechanism 10 is to be corrected, first, the accessor 8 is brought to a position of the highest (or lowest) rack of the cell mechanism 10 being controlled by the ACL control unit 81 (S81).
      <br/>
      In this case, the position (tachometer value) of the accessor 8 is latched relying upon the output 3 (rising or breaking) of the presence-of-cartridge detector mechanism and, hence, the latch enable bit 4 is set to "1", the reset signal 2 is set to "1" and, then, the counter 101 is cleared (S82).
    </p>
    <p num="397">
      In this state, the ACL control unit 81 drives the motor for raising/lowering the accessor so that the accessor 8 is slowly descended (or ascended), and checks whether a new tachometer value has been latched or not (S83).
      <br/>
      Here, as the accessor 8 descends or ascends to come to the next rack position, the presence-of-cartridge sensor 25 detects the rack, whereby the output 3 of the presence-of-cartridge detector mechanism assumes "1" and a tachometer value counted by the counter 101 is latched by the FF 104.
    </p>
    <p num="398">
      Then, the MPU 91 outputs the address 5 or the read signal 6 to the tachometer value latch circuit 100 to take the tachometer value latched by the FF 104 into the output circuit 105 and to put it onto the data bus, so that the tachometer value (that is latched) on the data bus can be checked.
      <br/>
      When the output 3 of the presence-of-cartridge detector mechanism assumes "0", the tachometer value that is latched is not put onto the data bus.
    </p>
    <p num="399">When a new tachometer value has been latched as a result of checking whether the tachometer value is newly latched or not, the MPU 91 reads out an ideal value of a corresponding rack position from a "Table of Ideal Values of Rack Positions" stored in the EEPROM 107 (S84) and compares it with the latched tachometer value (ideal value of rack position) &gt;= (latched tachometer value) (S85).</p>
    <p num="400">As a result, when (ideal value of rack position) &gt;= (latched tachometer value), the MPU 91 sets a "direction flag" to the work memory 94, finds a difference (ideal value of rack position-latched tachometer value) between the ideal value of the rack position and the latched tachometer value, and stores the difference as a correction value in the work memory 94 (S86).</p>
    <p num="401">When (ideal value of rack position)&lt;(latched tachometer value), the "direction flag" stored in the work memory 94 is reset (S90), a difference (latched tachometer value-ideal value of rack position) is found between an ideal value of the rack position and the latched tachometer value, and the difference is stored as a correction value in the work memory 94 (S90).</p>
    <p num="402">
      After the processing of step S86 or S90 is finished, the MPU 91 determines whether the correction value is within a range in which it can be corrected or not (S87).
      <br/>
      When the value lies outside the range of correction, the host unit is informed of an error (S91) and the processing is finished.
      <br/>
      When the error is within a range of correction, however, the value counted by the counter 101 is corrected by the correction value (S88).
    </p>
    <p num="403">
      When (ideal value of rack position) &gt;= (latched tachometer value), then, correction value=(ideal value of rack position-latched tachometer value).
      <br/>
      Therefore, the MPU 91 adds the correction value to the value counted by the counter 101 to obtain a correct tachometer value (value of the counter 101 is counted up by the correction value).
      <br/>
      Furthermore, when (ideal value of rack position)&lt;(latched tachometer value), then, correction value=(latched tachometer value-ideal value of rack position).
      <br/>
      Therefore, the value counted by the counter 101 is counted down by the correction value to obtain a correct tachometer value.
    </p>
    <p num="404">
      Thus, the correction is effected for each of the racks, and the process are repeated starting from step S83 until the positions are corrected up to the lowest (or highest) rack.
      <br/>
      When the correction is finished for the lowest (or highest) rack (S89), the process all end.

      When being connected to the library unit (ACL apparatus 5 for attachment to a library unit+MTU+library unit), the processing can be executed in the same manner as described above.

    <p num="409">
      Depending upon whether the direction flag has been set to the correction value or not, the MPU 91 determines the direction for correction (upward direction or downward direction), and adds the correction value (S106) to, or subtracts the correction value (S104) from, a target value (value of a desired rack position to which the accessor 8 will be positioned) thereby to correct the target value.

      When it is determined at step S128 that there is no cartridge on the exit cell 14, the ACL control unit 81 brings the accessor 8 to the position of the exit cell 14 (same position as the leader block pushing member 30) (S129), drives the feeder motors 23 and rotates the feeder belts 43, so that the leader block of the cartridge is pushed onto the leader block pushing member 30 (S130).

    <p num="440">(1) Outline of the processing for preventing the feeder belts from being worn out at the same portions.</p>
    <p num="441">
      The accessor 8 is provided with a feeder mechanism which comprises feeder motors 23, feeder belts 43, etc.
      <br/>
      The feeder motors 23 are driven to turn the feeder belts 43, and the cartridge is conveyed as the portions of the feeder belts 43 come into contact with the cartridge.
    </p>
    <p num="442">
      The feeder belts 43 are rotating with their same portions only being in contact with the cartridge, and particular portions only are worn out.
      <br/>
      This is because, the cartridge is repetitively moved in a manner of accessor 8 --&gt; MTU 5, MTU --&gt; accessor 8, accessor 8 --&gt; rack, rack --&gt; accessor 8, and the feeder belts 43 are turning over the same portions at all times.

    <p num="446">
      Usually, the cartridge is fed into the accessor 8 from a rack of the cell mechanism 10 (S171), the accessor 8 is positioned to the MTU 6, and the cartridge is loaded into the MTU 6 (S172).
      <br/>
      The cartridge that is processed by the MTU 6 is then discharged therefrom (S173).
      <br/>
      The cartridge is then fed into the accessor 8 which is moved to be positioned to a rack of the cell mechanism 10 into which the cartridge is to be discharged (S174).
    </p>
    <p num="447">
      It is then determined if the connection-to-library unit mode has been established or not (S175).

      The cartridge is then discharged into the exit cell 14 (S177).

      In this case, the cartridge is properly held when it is detected by the second cell side sensor 39 but is not detected by the first cell side sensor 38.
    </p>
    <p num="451">
      Accordingly, learning is controlled by using these two sensors.
      <br/>
      In this learning control operation, the cartridge is pulled into the accessor 8 from the rack of the cell mechanism 10 and, at this moment, the time is measured from when the cartridge is detected by the first. cell side sensor 38 until when it is detected by the second cell side sensor 39.
    </p>
    <p num="452">
      The MPU 91 in the ACL control unit 81 compares the above measured time with a "reference time" that has been stored in the EEPROM 107, finds a difference between the two, adjusts a PWM value for driving the feeder motors 23 from the difference, and forms an adjusted PWM value.
      <br/>
      The adjusted PWM value is set to the memory in the PWM control unit 96.
    </p>
    <p num="453">
      When the feeder motors 23 are to be controlled next time, a voltage to be applied to the feeder motors 23 is adjusted relying upon the above adjusted PWM value to control the drive.

      The control operation is repetitively carried out to accomplish the learning, and the feeder motors 23 are PWM-controlled relying upon a proper PWM value at all times.

      Since the PWM value has been adjusted to a proper value, the overrunning amount when the cartridge is fed can be properly adjusted at all times.

    <p num="456">
      First, the feeder motors 23 are driven in a direction to pull the cartridge into the accessor 8 from a rack of the cell mechanism 10 (S191).

      Then, the timer 106 is driven at a moment when the first cell side sensor 38 is turned on (upon detecting the cartridge) (S192) in order to start measuring the time (S193).
      <br/>
      Then, the passage of time is measured (S195) until the second cell side sensor 39 is turned on (S194).
      <br/>
      After the above passage of time is measured, a PWM value adjusted depending upon the lapse of time is obtained for the feeder motors 23 (S196), and the adjusted PWM value is set to the memory in the PWM control unit 96 (S197).
    </p>
    <p num="457">(3) Advantage of feeder learning.</p>
    <p num="458">
      By PWM-controlling the feeder motors 23 using the adjusted PWM value obtained by feeder learning, the speed of the feeder motors 23 can be maintained to be constant at all times.
      <br/>
      Therefore, after the feeder motors 23 are stopped, the overrunning amount of the cartridge can be set to be constant.
      <br/>
      Even when the cartridge is to be pulled into the accessor from the rack, therefore, the overrunning amount becomes constant, and the cartridge can be properly pulled into the accessor at all times.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, the retrying time is eliminated and the time for accessing the cartridge is shortened.
    </p>
    <p num="459">
      When the cartridge is to be returned back to the rack, furthermore, the cartridge overruns by a predetermined amount and, hence, the cartridge flies by a predetermined amount.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, the feeder motors 23 can be stopped after the passage of a predetermined period of time from when the first cell side sensor 39 has detected the cartridge.
      <br/>
      Thus, the cartridge can be fed maintaining a high precision at all times.

    <p num="496">Described below with reference to FIGS. 45A to 50 is the operation for pulling/discharging (feeding/returning) the cartridge.</p>
    <p num="497">(1) Outline of the process.</p>
    <p num="498">
      The cartridge return sensor 45 provided on the accessor 8 is turned on when the cartridge being discharged (returned) into a rack of the cell mechanism 10 from the accessor 8 is completely held in the rack, and is turned off when the cartridge is gripped by the accessor 8 but has not been properly held in the rack.
      <br/>
      When the power source circuit is closed or when the accessor 8 is moved, a control operation is carried out to check whether the cartridge return sensor 45 is properly working or not.
    </p>
    <p num="499">When the cartridge return sensor 45 has detected that the cartridge has been broken while the cartridge is being discharged (returned) from the accessor 8 into the rack of the cell mechanism 10, the host unit is informed of an error after the cartridge is discharged onto the rack.</p>

    <p num="501">
      FIGS. 45A to 45C are diagrams of when the cartridge is to be pulled in, and FIGS. 46A and 46B are timing charts 3.
      <br/>
      Described below with reference to FIGS. 45A to 46B is a control operation for pulling in (feeding) the cartridge into the accessor 8 from a rack 11 of the cell mechanism 10.
    </p>
    <p num="502">
      Referring to FIGS. 45A to 45C, the accessor 8 is equipped with the cartridge return sensor 45, first cell side sensor 38 and second cell side sensor 39 which are arranged in this order from a side close to the rack 11 of the cell mechanism 10 maintaining a predetermined distance.
      <br/>
      In this state, a cartridge on the rack 11 of the cell mechanism 10 is pulled (fed) into the accessor 8.
    </p>
    <p num="503">In the operation for pulling in the cartridge, first, the cartridge return sensor 45 detects the cartridge and is turned on as in a state 1 shown in FIG. 45A. In this state, the first cell side sensor 38 and the second cell side sensor 39 do not detect the cartridge but remain turned off.</p>
    <p num="504">
      As the cartridge is further pulled in from the above-mentioned state 1, a state 2 is assumed as shown in FIG. 45B. In this state 2, the cartridge return sensor 45, first cell side sensor 38 and second cell side sensor 39 all detect the cartridge and are turned on.
      <br/>
      As the cartridge is further pulled in from this state 2, a state 3 is assumed as shown in FIG. 45C.
    </p>
    <p num="505">
      In the state 3, the cartridge return sensor 45 does not detect the cartridge and is turned off.
      <br/>
      Besides, the first cell side sensor 38 does not detect the cartridge and is turned off.
      <br/>
      Then, the second cell side sensor 39 only detects the cartridge and is turned on.
      <br/>
      Thus, when the second cell side sensor 39 is turned on and the first cell side sensor 38 is turned off, the cartridge stays at the home position, and the cartridge is held at this position (state where the cartridge is held at a proper position).
    </p>
    <p num="506">
      The cartridge held at the home position of the accessor 8 is discharged into the rack 11 in the reverse order.
      <br/>
      That is, in the operation for discharging the cartridge, the state 3 is, first, assumed as shown in FIG. 45C. Then, as the cartridge is returned, the state 2 is assumed as shown in FIG. 45B, which is then shifted into the state 1 shown in FIG. 45A. Finally, as the cartridge is discharged into the rack 11, the cartridge return sensor 45 no longer detects the cartridge and is turned off.
      <br/>
      Thus, at a moment when the cartridge return sensor 45 is turned off, it is so determined that the operation for returning the cartridge into the rack 11 is completed.
    </p>
    <p num="507">
      The above-mentioned operations are shown by a timing chart of FIGS. 46A and 46B, wherein FIG. 46A is a timing chart of when the cartridge is to be pulled into the accessor 8 from the rack, and FIG. 46B is a timing chart of when the cartridge is to be discharged into the rack from the accessor 8.
      <br/>
      In pulling the cartridge from the rack 11 as shown in FIG. 46A, first, the cartridge return sensor 45 only detects the cartridge at a timing t1 and is turned on (state 1 in FIG. 45A).
    </p>
    <p num="508">
      Then, as the cartridge is further pulled, the first cell side sensor 38 detects the cartridge at a timing t2 and is turned on.
      <br/>
      Then, at a timing t3, the second cell side sensor 39 detects the cartridge and is turned on.
      <br/>
      That is, at the timing t3, all sensors detect the cartridge and are turned on (state 2 in FIG. 45B).
    </p>
    <p num="509">At a timing t4 at which the cartridge is further pulled from the above-mentioned state, the cartridge return sensor 45 and the first cell side sensor 38 do not detect the cartridge and are turned off, but the second cell side sensor 39 only detects the cartridge and is turned on (state 3 in FIG. 45C).</p>
    <p num="510">
      When the cartridge on the accessor 8 is to be discharged onto the rack 11 as shown in FIG. 46B, the second cell side sensor 39 only detects the cartridge at a timing t10 and is turned on, but the first cell side sensor 38 and the cartridge return sensor 45 do not detect the cartridge and remain turned off.
      <br/>
      Then, as the cartridge is further returned, the second cell side sensor 39 and the first cell side sensor 38 detect the cartridge at a timing t11 and are turned on.

    <p num="511">
      Then, at a timing t12 at which the cartridge is further returned, the first cell side sensor 38, second cell side sensor 39 and cartridge return sensor 45 are all turned on.

      At a timing t13 at which the cartridge is further returned, the second cell side sensor 39 no longer detects the cartridge and is turned off.
    </p>
    <p num="512">
      Thus, at a timing t14 at which the cartridge is discharged onto the rack 11, all of the sensors no longer detect the cartridge and are turned off.

    <p num="513">(3) Pulling the cartridge.</p>
    <p num="514">
      Described below is a processing for pulling the cartridge into the accessor from the rack of the cell mechanism 10.
      <br/>
      In the following description, the first cell side sensor 38 is also referred to as "detector mechanism 1 of the rack side", the second cell side sensor 39 is also referred to as "detector mechanism 2 of the rack side", and the cartridge return sensor 45 is also referred to as "return detector mechanism".
    </p>
    <p num="515">
      The cartridge that is being pulled into the accessor 8 from the rack (cell) of the cell mechanism 10 is detected by the return detector mechanism (cartridge return sensor 45).
      <br/>
      Next, the cartridge is detected by the detector mechanism 1 of the rack side and the detector mechanism 2 of the rack side of the accessor 8 in this order.
      <br/>
      The pulling of cartridge into the accessor 8 ends when the cartridge is no longer detected by the detector mechanism 1 of the rack side.
    </p>
    <p num="516">
      When the cartridge that is being pulled is detected by both the detector mechanism 1 of the rack side and the detector mechanism 2 of the rack side of the accessor 8 at the start of the pulling operation, there is a probability that the cartridge is not detected by the return detector mechanism.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the return detector mechanism is not checked.
      <br/>
      If the detector mechanism 1 of the rack side of the accessor 8 only is detecting, then, the control operation is started after having confirmed that the return detector mechanism is detecting the cartridge.
    </p>
    <p num="517">
      Here, if the return detector mechanism is not detecting, which is contradictory to the principle, it is assumed that the return detector mechanism is broken.
      <br/>
      Since the distance has been determined between the return detector mechanism and the detector mechanism 1 of the rack side, the time from when the cartridge is detected by the return detector mechanism until it is detected by the detector mechanism 1 of the rack side can be learned from the distance and the speed for feeding the cartridge.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the timer is started when the cartridge is detected by the return detector mechanism.
      <br/>
      When the cartridge is not detected by the detector mechanism 1 of the rack side even after the passage of a time n (ms), then, it is assumed that the detector mechanism 1 of the rack side is broken.
    </p>
    <p num="518">
      When the catcher hands 19 are in the open state, the cartridge is never detected by the return detector mechanism unless it is broken.
      <br/>
      Whenever the catcher hands 19 are in the open state, therefore, the return detector mechanism is checked for its operation.
      <br/>
      Since it is not probable that the return detector mechanism that is detecting the cartridge is broken, it is then regarded that the detector mechanism 1 of the rack side is broken.
    </p>
    <p num="519">
      When the detector mechanism 2 of the rack side has detected the cartridge earlier than the detector mechanism 1 of the rack side after the cartridge has been detected by the return detector mechanism, which is contradictory to the principle, it is then regarded that the detector mechanism 1 of the rack side is broken.
      <br/>
      Similarly to the above, the time from when the cartridge is detected by the detector mechanism 1 of the rack side until the cartridge is detected by the detector mechanism 2 of the rack side, can be learned from a relation between the distance and the speed.
      <br/>
      Therefore, when the cartridge is not detected by the detector mechanism 2 of the rack side after the passage of a time x (ms) from when the cartridge is detected by the detector mechanism 1 of the rack side, it is regarded that the detector mechanism 2 of the rack side is broken.
      <br/>
      Finally, the motor is stopped after the cartridge is no longer detected by the detector mechanism 1 of the rack side, and the host unit is informed of the normal operation.

      When the detector mechanism 1 of the rack side is on (S251) and the detector mechanism 2 of the rack side is on (S252), the ACL control unit waits until the detector mechanism 1 of the rack side that is turned off (S264), and informs the host unit of the normal end (S265) and ends the processing.

      When there is no return detector mechanism (S301), the ACL control mechanism 81 waits until the detector mechanism 1 of the rack side is turned off (S302), sets n+x (ms) to the timer 106 and starts the timer 106 (S303).
      <br/>
      The timer supervises the passage of time.
      <br/>
      As the time n (ms) passes resulting in a time out (S304), the ACL control unit 81 stops the feeder motors 23 (S305)

    <p num="555">According to the above-mentioned control operation, the processed cartridge is poping up relative to the rack beyond a cartridge that has not been processed, and the operator is allowed to determine at a glance whether the cartridge is one that has not been processed or one that has been processed, contributing greatly to enhancing the operation efficiency.</p>
    <p num="556">.sctn.14: Processing for new/old apparatus discrimination--see FIGS. 52A and 52B.</p>
    <p num="557">FIGS. 52A and 52B are diagrams illustrating a processing for new/old apparatus discrimination, wherein FIG. 52A shows an old apparatus and FIG. 52B shows a new apparatus.</p>
    <p num="558">(1) Outline of the processing.</p>
    <p num="559">
      When the control method differs between the old apparatus using an old type of accessor 8 and the new apparatus using a new type of accessor 8, it requires a lot of time and work to develop firmwares for each of the old apparatus and the new apparatus.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the new type of apparatus and the old type of apparatus are automatically discriminated, so that a single firmware may suffice.
    </p>
    <p num="560">(2) Description of constitution.</p>
    <p num="561">
      In the old apparatus (conventional apparatus) shown in FIG. 52A, a connector B is connected to the other end of a cable C which is connected to a connector A of the accessor 8.
      <br/>
      On the side of the connector B, the logic (0 or 1) of a cable check signal that is received is returned back without being changed to the side of the connector A of the accessor 8.
    </p>
    <p num="562">
      Therefore, when, for example, the MPU 91 in the ACL control unit 81 sends a cable check signal (high level "1") to the side of the connector B, the signal received by the connector B is returned back without being changed (logic is not inverted) to the side of the connector.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the MPU 91 receives the cable check signal of the same logic and determines that the apparatus is of the old type.
    </p>
    <p num="563">
      In the new apparatus (of the present invention) shown in FIG. 52B, on the other hand, the connector B is connected to the other end of the cable C connected to the connector A of the accessor 8.
      <br/>
      A logic-inverting circuit is provided on the side of the connector B, and the logic (0 or 1) of the cable check signal that is received is inverted by the logic-inverting circuit and is returned back to the side of the connector A of the accessor 8.
    </p>
    <p num="564">Therefore, when, for example, the MPU 91 in the ACL control unit 81 sends a cable check signal (high level "1") to the side of the connector B, the signal received by the connector B is inverted for its logic by the logic-inverting circuit and is returned back to the side of the connector A. Therefore, the MPU 91 receives the cable check signal having an inverted logic and determines that the apparatus is of the new type.</p>
    <p num="565">(3) Processing based on the drawing.</p>
    <p num="566">
      First, described below is an ordinary method of checking a cable.
      <br/>
      Signals 0, 1 are sent from the side (MPU 91) of checking the cable to an end (to the side of a first pin) of the cable C. Then, the cable C returns the signals 0, 1 back to the end of the opposite side (side of the final pin) of the cable C through a printed board or the like that is connected to the cable C. Or, returns back the signals 1, 0.
      <br/>
      It is thus checked whether the cable C is connected or not.
    </p>
    <p num="567">
      According to the method of checking the cable of the old apparatus, the cable C is connected when the same logic is returned back between the ends of the cable C. That is, 1 --&gt; 1 and 0 --&gt; 0.
      <br/>
      Here, if the cable of the new apparatus is checked by the same method, 1 --&gt; 0 and 0 --&gt; 1; i.e., inverted logics are returned back.
      <br/>
      This makes it possible to discriminate the new apparatus over the old apparatus.
    </p>
    <p num="568">(4) Advantage.</p>
    <p num="569">
      According to the above-mentioned processing, the type of the accessor 8 is automatically discriminated by the firmware.
      <br/>
      Therefore, there is no need for the operator to set the type of the accessor 8 or it does not happen that the operator has forgot the setting.
      <br/>
      Thus, a single firmware suffices.
    </p>
    <p num="570">As described above, the present invention offers the following effects.</p>
    <p num="571">
      (1) The catcher hands can be controlled to assume the middle state which is an intermediate position of the catcher hands.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the cartridge can be loaded/discharged to and from the rack by the operator without being hindered (by the catcher hands), and the apparatus for automatically conveying cartridge features improved operation efficiency.
      <br/>
      When connected to the library unit, furthermore, the entry cell can be brought to a position (of the same height) of the recording/reproducing apparatus, making it possible to shorten the time for conveying the cartridge.
      <br/>
      This helps enhance the performance of the apparatus.
    </p>
    <p num="572">
      (2) The following effects are obtained upon detecting the presence of the cartridge.
      <br/>
      That is, when there is a cartridge on the rack of the exit cell, the cartridge in the recording/reproducing apparatus cannot be discharged.
      <br/>
      Here, if the presence-of-cartridge detector mechanism is not properly working, it may appear that a cartridge exists on the rack of the exit cell even though it really does not exist.
    </p>
    <p num="573">Therefore, when it is forced to discharge the cartridge onto the exit cell when a cartridge already exists on the rack of the exit cell, the apparatus is not stopped at once but it is confirmed if the presence-of-cartridge detector mechanism is properly working or not.</p>
    <p num="574">
      When the presence-of-cartridge detector mechanism is not functioning properly, the cartridge is discharged onto the rack of the exit cell and the apparatus is stopped, so that the cartridge on the side of the library unit can be conveyed to the other recording/reproducing apparatus.
      <br/>
      Thus, the library unit itself is not stopped, and the apparatus features enhanced performance and is operated nonattended.
    </p>
    <p num="575">
      So far, the cartridge that was obliquely loaded into the rack could not be detected and could not be processed.
      <br/>
      According to the present invention, however, the cartridge is gripped again by the catcher hands and is put straight with respect to the rack to eliminate the erroneously placed state.
      <br/>
      Thus, it is made possible to access even a cartridge that could not be accessed previously.
    </p>
    <p num="576">
      (3) Since the rack position is corrected, the accessor can be brought to a correct position with respect to each of the racks at all times.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the cartridge can be easily pulled or discharged.
      <br/>
      Besides, dispersion in the mounting of racks and dispersion in the racks themselves are absorbed by the firmware, enabling the apparatus to be assembled requiring decreased amounts of work.
      <br/>
      This makes it possible to decrease the cost of the apparatus and to improve reliability of the apparatus.
    </p>
    <p num="577">
      (4) Upon pushing in the leader block, even a cartridge from which the leader block was pulled out and could not be processed, can now be processed, and the apparatus can be operated nonattended even when it is connected to a library unit.
      <br/>
      An error does not occur even when the leader block is pulled out, and reliability of the apparatus is enhanced.
    </p>
    <p num="578">
      (5) The following effect is obtained as a result of preventing the feeder belts from being worn out at the same portions only.
      <br/>
      The feeder belts are turned a little with no load and so will not be worn out at the same portions only.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the belts are worn out evenly instead of being locally worn out in varying amounts.
      <br/>
      This makes it possible to lengthen the life of the belts compared to when they are worn out only locally and, hence, to lengthen the life of the accessor.
      <br/>
      This decreases the frequency for renewing the belts and, hence, to decrease the amount of work in the maintenance of the apparatus.
    </p>
    <p num="579">
      (6) Owing to the feeder learning, the speed of the feeder motors can be controlled to remain constant at all times.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the overrunning amount can be maintained constant after the feeder motors are stopped.
      <br/>
      With the overruning amount being maintained constant, the cartridge can be properly pulled into the accessor from the rack at all times.
      <br/>
      This eliminates the time for retrying and helps shorten the cartridge access time.
    </p>
    <p num="580">
      Moreover, the overrunning time is kept constant when the cartridge is to be returned back to the rack and, hence, the cartridge flies a constant amount.
      <br/>
      This can be realized by a simple control operation by stopping the motors after the passage of a predetermined period of time from when the cartridge is no longer detected by the detector mechanism 2 of the rack side.
    </p>
    <p num="581">
      (7) By initializing the cartridge, the presence of cartridge in the accessor can be confirmed at the time of closing the power source circuit or at the time when an error has occurred.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the cartridge is not damaged, the apparatus not scarred, and the cartridge is not lost.
      <br/>
      This improves the reliability of the apparatus for automatically conveying a cartridge.
    </p>
    <p num="582">
      (8) By retrying the feeder mechanism, even a cartridge that had been placed in an erroneous state can now be rescued.
      <br/>
      Therefore, it does not happen that the cartridge is not accessible, and reliability is improved.
      <br/>
      Even when the ACL apparatus is connected to the library unit, it does not happen that the cartridge is not accessible, and the system down does not take place.
    </p>
    <p num="583">
      (9) The following effect is obtained by the cartridge return control operation.
      <br/>
      Previously it could happen that the cartridge that is being returned back to the rack but that is not properly held in the cell, is lost when it is detected by neither the detector mechanism 1 of the rack side nor the detector mechanism 2 of the rack side.
      <br/>
      According to the present invention, however, the cartridge is not lost and the reliability is improved.
    </p>
    <p num="584">(10) Upon controlling the flying of the cartridge, the cartridge after processed now flies more toward the rack than the cartridge before being processed, enabling the operator at a glance to determine whether the cartridge is one before being processed or one after being processed, and contributing to greatly improving the operation efficiency.</p>
    <p num="585">
      (11) Upon carrying out the operation for discriminating the types of the apparatuses, the types of the accessors are automatically discriminated by firmware.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the operator does not have to set the type of the accessor.
      <br/>
      The operator cannot forget the setting.
      <br/>
      Therefore, only one firmware is needed.
