      A method for the amplification of a target nucleic acid is disclosed comprising the steps of reacting a nucleic acid with an amplification reaction mixture and a modified thermostable enzyme, wherein said modified thermostable polymerase is prepared by a reaction of a mixture of a thermostable polymerase and a chemical modifying reagent.
      <br/>
      The chemical modification reagent is an aldehyde, preferably formaldehyde.
      <br/>
      Essentially complete inactivation of the enzyme at ambient temperatures is achieved, with recovery of enzymatic activity at temperatures above 50° C.

    <heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="3">
      The present invention provides a method for reversible inactivation of thermostable enzymes by chemical modification under aqueous conditions.
      <br/>
      This chemical modification of thermostable enzymes has surprising effects in applications in the field of molecular biology such as nucleic acid amplification.
    </p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="4">
      The most important nucleic acid amplification technology is the Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) which was first described by Saiki et al., Science, 230:1350-54 (1985) and is also disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,683,202; 4,683,195; and 4,965,188.
      <br/>
      Commercial vendors, such as QIAGEN GmbH, Hilden, Germany, market PCR reagents and kits, and provide protocols for PCR.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      The principle of PCR is basically described by the amplification of specific nucleic acid sequences of a nucleic acid target template, using at least one, two or several target-specific oligonucleotides (primers), a thermostable nucleic acid polymerase, deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates and a reaction buffer.
      <br/>
      DNA synthesis initiates at the accessible 3 '--OH group of the target-specific oligonucleotides flanking the DNA sequence to be copied, thereby generating an identical copy of the target template nucleic acid sequence.
      <br/>
      The enzymatic reaction is repeated for a substantial number of thermal cycles consisting of the denaturation of the target nucleic acid, annealing of the primer oligonucleotides to complementary nucleic acid sequences and the subsequent extension of these primer-template complexes using a thermostable nucleic acid polymerase in a sequence-dependent manner.
      <br/>
      Hybridization of primers occurs usually at sufficiently high temperature to provide annealing conditions that ensure binding of the oligonucleotide primers mainly to its complementary target nucleic acid sequence.
      <br/>
      However, PCR reaction mixtures are often assembled at room temperature, thus providing much less stringent oligonucleotide hybridization conditions, at a temperature at which most thermostable nucleic acid polymerases possess DNA synthesis activity.
      <br/>
      Since non-specifically annealed and extended oligonucleotides lead to formation of non-specific amplification products, these mis-primed non-specific PCR products can compete during subsequent PCR cycles with the specific PCR product for primer molecules, polymerase and nucleotides, thereby severely interfering or even abrogating the amplification reaction of the specific amplification product (see, Chou et al., Nucleic Acids Research, 20(7): 1717-1723 (1992)).
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      To overcome difficulties related to non-specific amplification products caused by the extension of mis-primed oligonucleotides during the reaction set-up or the initial heating phase of PCR, an essential PCR component such as the oligonucleotide primers, nucleotide triphosphates, magnesium ions or thermostable nucleic acid polymerase could be added only at higher temperatures, thereby reducing the probability of having non-specific hybridization or extending mis-primed oligonucleotides.
      <br/>
      This technique is commonly known as "hot-start PCR", or more specifically "manual hot-start PCR".
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      Another method, described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,411,876, employs a solid wax-barrier between the template-primer mix and the remaining reaction mixture.
      <br/>
      This wax-barrier melts only at elevated temperature, so that all of the reaction components are mixed only at high temperature, preventing mis-priming and extension of mis-primed oligonucleotides.
      <br/>
      However, as in the case of the manual hot start PCR, the wax-mediated hot start procedure carries a higher risk of contamination and is less convenient, due to increased time necessary for sample processing and due to the solid wax-barrier that forms above the reaction mixture after finishing PCR.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      Extension of mis-primed oligonucleotides can also be prevented by pre-incubating the primers with a compound that binds specifically to single-stranded DNA in a heat-reversible manner, such as a single-strand binding protein.
      <br/>
      Such a compound would prevent the oligonucleotide primer from hybridizing to any template sequence at ambient temperature.
      <br/>
      For instance, the use of Gene 32 protein, a single stranded DNA binding protein, was shown to improve the yield of PCR products in Schwarz et al., Nucleic Acid Research, 18(4): 10 (1990).
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      Another method of reducing formation of extension products from mis-primed oligonucleotides during the reaction set-up is a reversible non-covalent modification of the nucleic acid polymerase. U.S. Pat. No. 5,338,671 discloses the use of antibodies specific for the nucleic acid polymerase to inhibit the polymerase's activity.
      <br/>
      Pre-mixing of nucleic acid polymerase and polymerase-specific antibodies results in the formation of an antibody-polymerase complex.
      <br/>
      Under these conditions substantially no oligonucleotide extension activity can be detected.
      <br/>
      At elevated temperatures, the antibody dissociates from the complex, thus releasing the nucleic acid polymerase, which can then function in DNA synthesis during the Polymerase Chain Reaction.
      <br/>
      However, this method carries the risk of contamination due to an increased number of handling steps and the possible presence of residual nucleic acids derived from the antibody preparation.
      <br/>
      Another method to reduce non-specific amplification products involves the use of a chemically modified thermostable DNA polymerase that becomes active only after incubation of the DNA polymerase for a certain period of time at elevated temperature, thus preventing production of non-specific DNA synthesis products during reaction set-up and the initial heating phase of PCR. U.S. Pat. No. 5,677,152 and corresponding European patent publication EP 0 771 870 A1 describe a method for amplification of a target nucleic acid using a thermostable polymerase reversibly inactivated using a dicarboxylic acid anhydride.

    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="11">
      The present invention provides methods and reagents for reversible inactivation of thermostable enzymes using a chemical modification under essentially aqueous conditions.
      <br/>
      In particular, the thermostable enzymes of the present invention are reversibly modified in the presence of an aldehyde.
      <br/>
      The modified thermostable enzymes of the present invention do not show significant increase in enzyme activity at 37 (degree)  C., even when incubated for periods of an hour or more.
      <br/>
      On the other hand, enzymatic activity of the present chemically modified enzymes is increased at least two-fold within thirty minutes when incubated at a more elevated temperature, i.e., above 50 (degree)  C., preferably at a temperature of 75 (degree)  C. to 100 (degree)  C., and most preferably at 95 (degree)  C. Such chemically modified enzymes may be employed in all applications involving manipulation of nucleic acids, such as amplification, ligation, exonucleolytic or endonucleolytic reactions, or nucleic acid topology changing enzymatic reactions, wherein the inactivated enzyme becomes reactivated by incubating the reaction mixture prior or as part of the intended enzymatic reaction at an elevated temperature.
    </p>
    <p num="12">
      One major aspect of the modification is crosslinking of enzyme molecules, thereby limiting enzyme structure flexibility and accessibility of functional core region(s) of the enzyme.
      <br/>
      The great advantage of this method is its broad applicability, since the inactivation and reactivation of the thermostable enzyme is essentially independent of pH, which in general varies with respect to the optimal reaction conditions for different enyzmes.
    </p>
    <p num="13">Another aspect of the present invention relates to methods for chemical modification of thermostable enzymes such as enzymes for nucleic acid amplification reactions, ligation reactions or enzymatic reactions requiring exo- and/or endonucleolytic activities or enzymatic reactions resulting in changes of nucleic acid topology.</p>
    <p num="14">
      A further aspect of the present invention relates to the chemical modifier employed for reversible inactivation of the thermostable enzymes of the present invention.
      <br/>
      Preferably the chemical modifier is capable of reversibly modifying the enzymes of the present invention under essentially aqueous conditions.
      <br/>
      More preferably, the chemical modifier is an aldehyde.
      <br/>
      Most preferably the chemical modifier is formaldehyde (H2 C.dbd.O).

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="21">Modification Under Aqueous Conditions</p>
    <p num="22">
      The present invention relates to methods for chemical modification of thermostable enzymes such as enzymes for nucleic acid amplification reactions, ligation reactions, enzymatic reactions requiring exo- and/or endonucleotlytic activities or enzymatic reactions which result in changes of nucleic acid topology.
      <br/>
      The modified thermostable DNA polymerases according to the present invention exhibit stable, reduced enzyme activity at temperatures lower than about 50 (degree)  C., and thus the presently disclosed reversibly inactivated enzymes show advantages over, e.g., a DNA polymerase treated as described in European patent publication EP 0 771 870 A1, as demonstrated in Examples 9, 12 and 13 below, due to the conditions necessary for reactivation and more specifically due to the discrepancy between the pH range required for reactivation and the pH that is allowed for optimal reaction conditions for such treated thermostable enzymes.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, modification of enzymes with acylating agents as described in EP 0 771 870 A1 is disadvantageous compared with the method described herein: Reactions employing acylating agents usually require non-aqueous reaction conditions, which are less suitable for proteins in terms of optimization and control of the modification reaction.
      <br/>
      In contrast, modification reactions using aldehydes, preferably formaldehyde, are advantageously carried out under essentially aqueous conditions and are therefore can be completed rapidly and are easy to optimize.
    </p>
    <p num="23">
      The present invention describes a method and reagents that can be used for the heat-reversible inactivation of thermostable enzymes that can be employed in primer-based nucleic acid amplification reactions.
      <br/>
      The present methods and reagents are especially suitable for nucleic acid polymerases that do not function satisfactorily when treated as described in European patent publication EP 0 771 870 A1, as is demonstrated in example 12.
    </p>
    <p num="24">
      The present invention provides methods for the convenient inactivation of enzymes that are thermostable, that is, enzymes that are relatively stable to heat and can withstand high temperature incubation (e.g., greater than about 50 (degree)  C.) without irreversible loss of activity.
      <br/>
      Activity of the modified enzymes according to the invention can be achieved by treating said inactivated enzymes at high temperature (e.g., greater than about 50 (degree)  C.) in a pre-incubation step prior to the intended enzymatic reaction or as part of the enzymatic reaction.
    </p>
    <p num="25">
      Aldehydes useful as modifying reagents for reversibly inactivating thermostable enzymes according to this invention will have the general formula RHC.dbd.O, where R is H or an alkyl, aryl, or alkylaldehyde (O.dbd.CH--(CH2)0-9 --) group of 1 to 10 carbon atoms.
      <br/>
      Such reagents include formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, glutaraldehyde, and the like, however, because the aldehyde is believed to inactivate the enzyme by forming crosslinks between enzyme molecules, formaldehyde is especially preferred.
      <br/>
      The aldehyde employed must be at least partially soluble in water and capable of reacting below about 50 (degree)  C. with the thermostable enzyme to form a modified enzyme that will return at least part of its former enzymatic primer extension activity after incubation at a high temperature, i.e., above about 50 (degree)  C. It is believed that reaction of the enzyme with aldehyde reagent forms heat-labile crosslinks through amino-functional side-chains, and therefore any aldehyde compound that is reactive with an enzyme to be treated and which forms such crosslinks without significantly degrading the enzyme or irreversibly inactivating the enzyme is suitable.
      <br/>
      The preferred reagent for the reversible inactivation of thermostable DNA polymerases for the use in primer extension reactions is formaldehyde.
    </p>
    <p num="26">
      The modification consists of reacting molecules of a thermostable enzyme, e.g., Taq DNA polymerase, by heating in the presence of 0.01 M-2 M aldehyde, e.g., formaldehyde, at a temperature below 50 (degree)  C. (preferably 35 (degree)  C.-39 (degree)  C., most preferably about 37 (degree)  C.), preferably under aqueous conditions, for sufficient time to reduce the activity of the enzyme to acceptable levels.
      <br/>
      The modification typically can be carried out within 1 to 60 minutes reaction time, but this will vary slightly depending on the reagent used.
      <br/>
      Formaldehyde modification will preferably be carried out for less than 60 minutes, most preferably 15 to 30 minutes.
      <br/>
      The modified thermostable enzyme will have essentially no primer extension activity at room temperature and will not recover significant activity until exposed to elevated temperatures.
      <br/>
      Below about 50 (degree)  C., however, exposure must be so prolonged (greater than 1 hour) in order to reactivate the enzymes that the enzyme modification is viewed as being reversible only at high temperatures (above 50 (degree)  C.).
      <br/>
      In a preferred embodiment, for example, a modified Taq DNA polymerase treated with formaldehyde according to the present invention has essentially no primer extension activity at the conditions of maximal primer extension activity (i.e., between 60 (degree)  C. to 75 (degree)  C.), as shown in Example 6; and the modified thermostable enzyme appears to be further stabilized in comparison with Taq DNA polymerase treated with anhydride.
    </p>
    <p num="27">
      Primer extension using a nucleic acid polymerase can be considered as a process involving two major stages.
      <br/>
      The first step is the association of the nucleic acid polymerase with a priming site.
      <br/>
      The second is binding of a nucleotide (to form a new base pair with the template nucleotide) and moving on to the next (unpaired) template nucleotide.
      <br/>
      At this point, the enzyme can dissociate or continue adding new deoxymononucleotides (Kornberg, DNA replication, Freeman &amp; Co., New York, 1980).
      <br/>
      Modification of the enzyme structure by crosslinking with aldehyde reagents according to this invention is believed to prevent the enzymatic activity by reducing, for example, flexibility of the structure or reducing accessibility of the active core region of the enzyme by crosslinking enzyme molecules.
      <br/>
      Binding to the template, adding the deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates and moving along the template may require specific enzyme conformations and flexibility as well as free accessibility of the enzyme's active center that are hindered when the enzyme is in the crosslinked state.
    </p>
    <p num="28">
      Modification of proteins with formaldehyde that eliminates enzymatic activity has been shown in the art, however recovery of enzymatic activity of the formaldehyde-modified enzyme has not been observed.
      <br/>
      Earlier studies have shown that treatment of ribonuclease A by formaldehyde shows an immediate loss of enzymatic activity upon adding formaldehyde, followed by a slower second stage loss.
      <br/>
      The initial inactivation was reversed upon dilution and short incubation whereas the second stage of inactivation was not reversed by dilution (Means and Feeney 1968, Biochemistry 7(6): 2192-201).
      <br/>
      Surprisingly, we have found that the enzymatic activity of formaldehyde-treated thermostable enzymes can be recovered by incubation for a period at elevated temperatures.
    </p>
    <p num="29">
      Crosslinking of the enzyme can have additional stabilizing effects.
      <br/>
      Various physical studies have shown that the action of formaldehyde on proteins under conditions close to physiological conditions may produce intramolecular crosslinks hindering denaturation of proteins.
      <br/>
      Reductive alkylation with formaldehyde has little or no effect on the distribution of charged groups and causes a minimal disturbance of electrostatic interactions (see, Means, Methods in Enzymology, 47: 469-78 (1977)).
      <br/>
      Formaldehyde treatment, e.g., to fix or inactivate enzyme activity, has been used for a number of purposes.
      <br/>
      Formaldehyde has been used more extensively than other aldehydes in industry, research and medicine, e.g., for preparation of vaccines, inactivation of viral RNA, for making direct functional changes of nucleic acids in vivo, and for the investigation through modification of structural and functional characteristics of DNA and proteins (Feldman, Progr.
      <br/>
      Nucl. Acid Res. &amp; Mol. Biol., 13: 1-49 (1973)).
    </p>
    <p num="30">
      As described in EP 0 771 870 A1, reaction of most acylating agents, e.g., citraconic anhydride, with protein amino-groups is competitive with hydrolysis of the reagent by water or hydroxyl ions.
      <br/>
      The reaction conditions must be adjusted to take this into account, and non-aqueous solutions may be required for optimal performance.
      <br/>
      The optimal conditions employ a high concentration of the anhydride reagent at a pH that maximizes deprotonation of amino-groups but minimizes hydrolysis.
      <br/>
      The rapid liberation of acid during the reaction must also be taken into account, especially during the long incubation times, which are typical for the reaction (Atassi et al., Methods in Enzymology, 25(B): 546-53 (1972); Butler et al., Methods in Enzymology. 25(B): 191-199 (1972)).
    </p>
    <p num="31">
      In contrast to anhydride reagents, the reaction conditions of formaldehyde treatment are preferably aqueous.
      <br/>
      The reaction can be carried out at a broad range of pH in a few minutes.
      <br/>
      This fact simplifies optimization and control of the reaction rate.
    </p>
    <p num="32">
      As mentioned above, the primary sites of formaldehyde treatment appear to be the  EPSILON --NH2 group of lysine, e.g., in the histones.
      <br/>
      This group has a pK of 11.3 and at pH 7 is fully protonated and highly reactive.
      <br/>
      The rate of formaldehyde crosslinking of histones with DNA is very rapid (80% crosslinked within 1 min.).
      <br/>
      The dramatic decrease of ribonuclease activity is achieved after a few minutes upon addition of formaldehyde (Jackson, Cell, 15(3): 945-54 (1978)).
      <br/>
      The reaction of formaldehyde with an amine is thought to be an essential step.
      <br/>
      At the same time there is no consensus on the exact mechanism of formaldehyde action on the amino-groups of a protein.
      <br/>
      No evidence for so-called Schiff base (R--N.dbd.CHR) formation was obtained in the reaction of formaldehyde with  ALPHA -amino groups of amino acids although reductive alkylation of amino groups in protein by formaldehyde in the presence of pyridine borane and borohydride propose the mechanism of Schiff-formation.
    </p>
    <p num="33">Treatment of Thermostable Enzymes</p>
    <p num="34">
      In a preferred method, DNA polymerase purified from Thermus aquaticus is incubated with up to 2 M formaldehyde, preferably with 20 mM to 1 M formaldehyde, at 37 (degree)  C. in a water bath, for about 1 minute to 60 minutes, preferably 30 minutes.
      <br/>
      Subsequently, the reaction mixture is chilled on ice and the residual formaldehyde is removed from the formaldehyde-treated DNA polymerase by ultra-filtration and by washing in a buffer consisting of 20 mM Hepes pH 7.9, 1 mM EDTA, 200 mM KCl.
      <br/>
      The treated DNA polymerase is then dialyzed overnight at 4 (degree)  C. against a storage buffer consisting of 20 mM Tris pH 9.0, 0.1 mM EDTA, 0.5% (v/v) Tween 20, 10 mM ethanolamine, 100 mM KCl, 1 mM DTT, 0.5% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 50% (v/v) Glycerin.
      <br/>
      Surprisingly, it was found that formaldehyde treatment of thermostable nucleic acid polymerase isolated from either Thermus aquaticus or Pyrococcus furiosus, cloned and overexpressed in Escherichia coli, under essentially physiological conditions gives a stable product after removal of unreacted formaldehyde.
    </p>
    <p num="35">
      The formaldehyde-modified nucleic acid polymerases are characterized by non-detectable primer extension activity, in the absence of free formaldehyde.
      <br/>
      In addition, the primer extension activity can be recovered by incubation at elevated temperature for a prolonged time.
      <br/>
      The recovery of primer extension activity was found to be temperature-dependent and time-dependent, with higher reactivation temperature or longer incubation times above 50 (degree)  C. leading to greater or more rapid recovery of activity.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, reactivation of formaldehyde-treated nucleic acid polymerase is essentially independent of pH.
      <br/>
      Most reaction buffers or reaction mixtures are Tris-buffered.
      <br/>
      The temperature dependence of many buffer systems used in molecular biology including Tris-buffers has been reported by Good et al., Biochemistry, 5(2): 467-477 (1966).
      <br/>
      With regard to Tris-buffers, the change in pKa with temperature is as follows:  DELTA pKa/ (degree)  C.=-0.031. As indicated in the following examples, it is shown that recovery of enzyme activity from formaldehyde-treated thermostable DNA polymerase is more temperature-dependent and less pH dependent than, for example, when using dicarboxylic acid anhydrides.
    </p>
    <p num="36">
      In addition to using the modified, inactivated nucleic acid polymerases as described above, PCR reactions may be improved by using additives that affect the melting behavior of nucleic acids in the reaction mixture.
      <br/>
      For example, difficult PCR amplifications, such as reactions that yield non-specific products, and especially amplification of templates having a high GC content or having extensive secondary structure, may be improved by employing additives that "isostabilize" AT- and GC-base pairing to the level of AT-base pair stability.
      <br/>
      Suitable such PCR additives include multifunctional polyols, preferably trifunctional polyols, most preferably glycerol; amides, preferably carbamides, most preferably formamide; alkaline ammonia salts, preferably alkylated ammonia salts, most preferably tetramethylammonium chloride; sulfoxides, preferably alkylated sulfoxides, most preferably dimethylsulfoxide; sulfates, preferably inorganic sulfates, most preferably ammonium sulfate polyalkylene glycols, most preferably polyethylene glycol.
      <br/>
      Additionally, SSB protein (single strand binding protein), preferably E. coli SSB protein (see, Schwarz et al., E. coli SSB protein, Nucleic Acids Research, 18: 1079 (1990)), T4 gene 32 protein, or yeast SSB protein, may also be used.
      <br/>
      Preferred PCR additives also include calf thymus protein UP1 (see, Amrute et al., Biochemistry, 33(27): 8282-8291 (1994).

    <p num="38">
      The PCR additives are advantageously added to a PCR reaction mixture in an amount effective to improve the specificity of the amplified product.
      <br/>
      Typically concentrations of additive from 1 mM to 5M, preferably about 1M, are used, however any amount that improves the yield of the specific amplification product, compared with a PCR reaction carried out in the absence of the additive, is suitable.

A fragment of the human glycerinaldehyde-3-phosphate-dehydrogenase gene was reverse transcribed from total RNA into complementary DNA (cDNA) by either reverse transcriptase and subsequently amplified by 0.03 *  Taq DNA polymerase using primers flanking a 831 bp PCR fragment including primer sequences (24-mer 5'-ATGGGGAAGGTGAAGGTCGGAGTC-3' (SEQ ID NO: 8), 24-mer 5'-AGTGTAGCCCAGGATGCCCTTGAG-3' (SEQ ID NO: 9)) for both enzymatic reactions.
      <br/>
      The reaction mixture contained 1  MU g total RNA from HeLa cells (purified from human HeLa cell line using RNeasy.RTM. Maxi Kit, QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany), 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.4, 50 mM KCl, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 200  MU M of each dNTP, 0.4  MU M of each primer.
      <br/>
      Final reaction volume was 50  MU l. The thermal cycling profile consisted of a 30 min. lasting reverse transcriptase step at 50 (degree)  C., directly followed by a pre-incubation step at 95 (degree)  C. for 15 min. during which simultaneously the respective reverse transcriptase became inactivated.
      <br/>
      This step was followed by 40 cycles: denaturation step for 30 sec. at 94 (degree)  C., annealing step for 45 sec. at 55 (degree)  C. and an extension step for 1 min. at 72 (degree)  C. Amplification products were analyzed on a 1% agarose gel by gel electrophoresis using a 1 *  TAE electrophoresis buffer and a DNA intercalating dye.
      <br/>
      Gel electrophoresis was performed for approximately 35 min. at 85 volts.
      <br/>
      Ethidium bromide-stained amplification products were visualized using UV irradiation.

    <p num="120">
      The results demonstrate that formaldehyde-inactivated Taq DNA polymerase can be used in combination with reverse transcriptases in a continuous single tube RT-PCR reaction.
      <br/>
      Advantageously, formaldehyde-inactivated Taq DNA polymerase is inactive during the reverse transcriptase reaction and only becomes active for the PCR reaction, while during the heat activation step, residual reverse transcriptase activity is destroyed.
      <br/>
      This advantageous effect of formaldehyde-inactivated Taq DNA polymerase can be used in continuous single tube RT-PCR with both RNase H positive and RNase H negative reverse transcriptases.
