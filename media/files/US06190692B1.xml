      The method includes administering a pharmaceutical formulation comprising (a) a core including the pharmaceutically active agent to be delivered, and (b) a swellable polymeric coating layer substantially surrounding the core.
      <br/>
      The swellable polymeric coating layer delays the release of the pharmaceutically active agent from the core for a predetermined period of time dependent upon the thickness of the swellable polymeric coating layer.

    <p num="2">
      The present invention relates to controlled release dosage formulations.
      <br/>
      More particularly, the present invention relates to a method of preparing a time-specific controlled release dosage formulations.
    </p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="3">
      Pharmaceutical formulations for oral administration have employed various coatings for the purpose of preserving the integrity of the formulation while passing through the gastric tract.
      <br/>
      The high acidity, and presence of proteolytic and other enzymes generates a highly digestive environment which readily disintegrates pharmaceutical formulations which do not possess some type of gastro-resistance protection.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      In recent years, a need has arisen for formulations which are capable of passing over the entire tract of the small intestine, including the duodenum, jejunum, and ileum, so that the active ingredients are released directly in the colon.
      <br/>
      For example, European Patent Application No. 366 621 provides a formulation for delivery in the colon which includes a core containing the active ingredient and three protective layers having differing solubilities around the core.
      <br/>
      As another example, our European Application No. 572 942, disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety, provides an oral pharmaceutical composition including a core containing the active ingredient, an intermediate coating layer which delays the release of the active ingredient contained in the core for a programmed time period, and an outer layer, the dissolution of which activates the process of swelling/dissolution/erosion of the intermediate layer.
      <br/>
      In the composition described in European Application No. 572 942, the coating layers are applied sequentially by watery or organic film coating or by press coating techniques, such as double press coating.
      <br/>
      A primary disadvantage of these coating methods is that these methods employ solutions of the coating polymers, which coating polymers have very high viscosities in water-based environments.
    </p>
    <p num="5">Double press coating techniques have some disadvantages in that the core of the formulation may not be properly centered within the coating, and a relatively large amount of polymer is required for proper coating.</p>
    <p num="6">There also remains a need in the art for pharmaceutical formulations which release active ingredient after a predetermined latency or lag time period in the body, i.e., time-specific release formulations.</p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="7">
      It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a method of preparing a time-specific release pharmaceutical formulation which is faster than conventional coating techniques.
      <br/>
      It is also an object of the present invention to provide a time-specific pharmaceutical formulation, the disintegration of which is triggered by time lapse, independently of the pH of the environment to which it is subjected.

    <p num="19">
      The cores employed in the methods of the present invention may be either solid, tablet-like cores or liquid filled capsule cores.
      <br/>
      In the case of solid, tablet-like cores, the cores typically include one or more pharmaceutically acceptable excipients in addition to the pharmaceutically active agent.
      <br/>
      Pharmaceutically acceptable excipients which may be employed are well known to those skilled in the art and include any conventional pharmaceutically acceptable tableting excipients.
      <br/>
      Examples of suitable excipients include but are not limited to microcrystalline cellulose, dibasic calcium phosphate dihydrate, starch, sodium starch glycolate, crospovidone, croscarmellose sodium, magnesium stearate, lactose, maleic acid, colloidal silicon dioxide, talc, and glyceryl behenate.
    </p>
    <p num="20">
      The core can be prepared by any suitable technique known to those skilled in the art.
      <br/>
      For example, the pharmaceutically active agent may be admixed with the excipient(s) and advantageously formed into a tablet or caplet using a conventional tableting press.
    </p>
    <p num="21">
      In the embodiment wherein the core is a capsule containing a liquid form of the pharmaceutically active agent, the pharmaceutically active agent is provided in a liquid form such as a solutions, liposome dispersions, oil-in-water emulsions, microemulsions, precursors of microemulsions and liposomes, dispersions of microparticles, dispersions of nanoparticles, dispersions of solid lipid nanoparticles, and suspensions.
      <br/>
      Any conventional technique for providing the active in the form of a solution, liposome dispersions, oil-in-water emulsion, microemulsion, precursors of microemulsion and/or liposomes, dispersions of microparticles, dispersions of nanoparticles, dispersions of solid lipid nanoparticle, or suspension can be employed.
      <br/>
      Generally, liquid forms of a pharmaceutically active agent can be provided by bringing into association the pharmaceutically active agent and one or more carriers such as by solubilizing, dispersing, or suspending the pharmaceutically active agent in a suitable carrier or emulsifying a liquid containing the pharmaceutically active agent.
      <br/>
      Of course suitable carriers will be those carriers which do not interfere with the activity of the particular pharmaceutically active agent to be administered, and are pharmaceutically acceptable in the sense that they are not deleterious to the patient to which the formulation will be administered.
    </p>
    <p num="22">
      Suitable carriers include hydrophilic and lipophilic carriers include, for example, pharmaceutically acceptable alcohols such as ethanol; glycols such as ethoxy diglycol, ethylene glycol, propylene glycol, and polyethylene glycols of varying length (e.g., PEG-4, PEG-6, PEG-8, etc.); alkyl esters of fatty acids such as isopropyl myristate, isopropyl palmitate, isopropyl stearate, isopropyl oleate, and polyglyceryl-6 isostearate; mono-, di-, and triglycerides; polyoxyethylene-polyoxypropylene thermosetting copolymers; phospholipids such as phosphatidylcholine; natural and synthetic oils such as hydrogenated coconut oil, palm oil, corn oil, almond oil, white mineral oil, silicon oil, dimethylpolysiloxane; propylene glycol dipelargonate; trilaneth-4-phosphate.
      <br/>
      Other examples of conventional, suitable hydrophilic and lipophilic carriers which may be employed for the productions of liquid forms of any of the above-listed pharmaceutically active agents can be found in REMINGTON'S PHARMACEUTICAL SCIENCES, 18th ed. A. Gennaro, Mack Publishing Co., Easton Pa. (1990).
      <br/>
      In some instances it may be desirable to combine two or more hydrophilic carriers, two or more lipophilic carriers, or a combination of an hydrophilic and lipophilic carriers to provide the pharmaceutically active agent in liquid form.
    </p>
    <p num="23">The liquid form of the pharmaceutically active agent may also contain additives such as, for example, conventional dispersants, preservatives, stabilizers, surfactants, antioxidants, buffers, colorants, and the like, as will be understood by those skilled in the art of pharmacy.</p>
    <p num="24">Further advantages of the formulation are obtained by including in the liquid form components such as enhancers to improve the intestinal absorption of specific active agents, or enzyme-inhibitors to protect specific active agents from intestinal enzymatic degradation.</p>
    <p num="25">
      The pharmaceutically active agents may be formulated into a liquid form using any suitable, conventional techniques known to those skilled in the art of pharmacy.
      <br/>
      REMINGTON'S PHARMACEUTICAL SCIENCES, 18th ed. A. Gennaro, Mack Publishing Co., Easton Pa. (1990) as well as many other general pharmacy texts described methods for formulating active agents in solutions, liposome dispersions, oil-in-water emulsions, microemulsions, precursors of microemulsions and/or liposomes, dispersions of microparticles, dispersions of nanoparticles, dispersions of solid lipid nanoparticles, and suspensions; which methods may be employed to provide the pharmaceutically active agent in liquid form according to the present invention.
    </p>
    <p num="26">For example, solutions containing pharmaceutically active agents can be produced by substantially completely solubilizing the pharmaceutically active agent in a suitable carrier, optionally with stirring and/or the addition of heat.</p>
    <p num="27">Emulsions may be obtained by solubilizing the pharmaceutically active agent in either an aqueous or an oil phase and emulsifying the aqueous and oil phases with the aid of at least one surfactant.</p>
    <p num="28">
      The liposome dispersions may be produced according to conventional techniques, through the use of phospholipids after the solubilization of the pharmaceutically active agent.
      <br/>
      Suitable conventional techniques for the production of liposome dispersions are described in Martindale, 18th Edition, page 1691-1692; Pharmaceutical Manufacturing of Liposomes, F. J. Martin, SPECIALIZED DRUG DELIVERY SYSTEMS, Marcel Dekker Inc., pg. 267-316; and Specialized Pharmaceutical Emulsions, M. Rosoff, PHARMACEUTICAL DOSAGE FORMS: DISPERSE SYSTEMS, vol. 1, Marcel Dekker Inc., pg 245-283.

    <p num="30">Precursors of microemulsions and liposomes may be obtained in the same way as microemulsions and liposome dispersions, but with less, or no quantity of water.</p>

Kreuter, SPECIALIZED DRUG DELIVERY SYSTEMS, Marcel Dekker Inc., pg. 257-266. Dispersions of these nanoparticles can then be obtained using the dispersion techniques described above.</p>
    <p num="33">
      Solid lipid nanoparticles may be obtained as described in Nanoparticelle Lipidiche Solide Quali Sistemi Terapeutici Colloidali, M. R. Gasco, NCF nr. 7, 1996, pg 71-73.
      <br/>
      Dispersions of these particles can then be obtained using the dispersion techniques described above.
    </p>
    <p num="34">Suspensions may be obtained by suspending the pharmaceutically active agent in a carrier in which it is partially, substantially, or completely insoluble.</p>
    <p num="35">
      The pharmaceutically active agent in liquid form is then encapsulated in a capsule prior to coating the capsule core with the swellable polymeric coating layer by filling the capsule with the liquid form of the pharmaceutically active agent and sealing the capsule to contain the liquid.
      <br/>
      Any conventional pharmaceutical capsule may be employed.
      <br/>
      Examples of suitable capsules include gelatin-based capsules (both hard and soft), starch-based capsules, and vegetable-based capsules.
      <br/>
      Currently soft shell gelatin capsules are preferred for the methods of the present invention.
      <br/>
      When gelatin or starch capsules are employed, the liquid form of the pharmaceutically active agent preferably includes lipophilic carriers, and in some instances, also hydrophilic carriers in an amount which does not cause the solubilization of the gelatin or starch capsule by the carrier.
      <br/>
      Typically, the amount of hydrophilic carrier is not more than 30% in those formulations which include by a hydrophilic and a lipophilic carrier.
      <br/>
      However, this number will differ depending upon the particular capsules employed.
      <br/>
      Capsule manufacturers typically establish the maximum amount of hydrophilic carrier which can be suitable encapsulated within their particular capsules.
    </p>
    <p num="36">
      According to the methods of the present invention, the pre-formed core, whether it is a solid, tablet-like core or a liquid filled capsule core, is substantially surrounded by a swellable polymeric coating layer.
      <br/>
      The swellable polymeric coating layer delays the release of the pharmaceutically active agent for a predetermined period of time, which period of time is dependent upon the thickness of the swellable polymeric coating layer.
      <br/>
      In other words, the thicker the swellable polymeric coating, the longer it delays the release of the active ingredient from the core of the formulation.
      <br/>
      Thus, the appropriate time period for the release of the active ingredient can be determined prior to the preparation of the formulation, and the formulation designed by applying the appropriate thickness of swellable polymeric coating layer to achieve the desired time delay prior to release of the active ingredient.
      <br/>
      Typically, the desired time delay will range from about 4 to about 9 hours inclusive, but may be longer or shorter in certain cases.
    </p>
    <p num="37">
      Because the formulations of the present invention provide the time-delayed release of a pharmaceutically active agent, the formulations provided by the instant invention are useful for the treatment of conditions which are desirously treated through time-delayed pharmaceutical agent delivery mechanisms.
      <br/>
      For example, the formulations of the present invention are useful for the treatment of morning pathologies, i.e., pathologies, conditions, diseases, or other illnesses, the symptoms of which are generally pronounced, aggravated, or more acute in the morning as the afflicted subject awakens from sleep.
      <br/>
      The Inventors have filed concurrently herewith, a separate patent application directed toward methods of treating morning pathologies with the time-specific formulations of the present invention.
      <br/>
      Morning pathologies include arthritis, angina, hypertension, and asthma.
      <br/>
      These conditions may be advantageously treated by administering the time-specific formulation according to the present invention prior to sleeping such that the delivery of the pharmaceutically active agent is achieved at about the time the afflicted subject awakens, thereby alleviating the symptoms of the morning pathology.

      The swellable polymeric coating layer is comprised of two basic components, a binder solution, and powdered polymeric particles.
      <br/>
      The swellable polymeric coating layer is applied to the core in a two-step fashion, which steps are repeated a sufficient number of times to build the thickness of the swellable polymeric coating layer.
      <br/>
      In the first step, the core is wet with the binder solution which serves to adhere the powdered polymeric coating particles to the wet core.

      Currently, polyvinylpyrrolidone is the preferred binder agent.

    <p num="39">
      Suitable solvents for solubilizing the binder agents include solvents which are capable of substantially completely solubilizing the specific binder agent(s) selected and which are pharmaceutically and biologically acceptable for ingestion.
      <br/>
      Suitable solvents will be readily determinable by those skilled in the art.
      <br/>
      Water is currently the preferred solvent for solubilizing the binder agent, as it is pharmacologically and biologically well suited for ingestion.
      <br/>
      However, other examples of suitable solvents will be appreciated by those skilled in the art and are contemplated by the methods of the present invention.

    <p num="40">
      The binder solution should be of sufficient viscosity to enable the wetting of the cores by any suitable wetting technique known to those skilled in the art.
      <br/>
      For example, the cores may be wetted with the binder solution by rotating the cores in a bath containing the binder solution.
      <br/>
      The cores may be suitably wetted by manual application of the binder solution by ladling the binder solution over the cores as the cores are rotating in a conventional coating pan.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, the cores may be wetted by spraying the binder solution on the cores.
      <br/>
      In one embodiment, the wetting step is advantageously carried out using conventional automated pan coating equipment wherein the cores are sprayed with the binder solution while rotating in the pan.
    </p>
    <p num="41">
      To provide the coating layer, the wetted cores are coated with dry, powdered polymeric coating particles which adhere to the binder-wetted core due to the presence of the binder on the surface of the core.
      <br/>
      The polymeric coating particles typically comprise a hydrophilic gelling polymer or "swellable" polymer which swells on contact with gastro-intestinal juices to form a continuous film surrounding the core.
      <br/>
      The coating layer must sufficiently protect the integrity of the core for the desired period of time, without regard to the pH of the medium to which it is subjected.
      <br/>
      Once the desired, pre-delivery time period has elapsed, the coating layer should be almost completely dissolved or eroded so that the core should be capable of relatively quick disintegration.
      <br/>
      Thus, it is desirable that the core be capable of the fast, time-specific release of the pharmaceutically active agent.
      <br/>
      Significantly, the methods of the present invention do not required polymeric solutions for the formation of the swellable polymeric coating layer and as such provide distinct advantages in terms of ease of manufacture and decreased manufacturing time.
      <br/>
      Because the methods of the present invention do not utilize polymeric solutions for the formation of the swellable polymeric coating layer, but instead utilize dry powdered polymeric particles, polymers which exhibit high viscosity in solution may be used in the methods of the present invention although they may not be functional in conventional film coating methods.
    </p>
    <p num="42">
      The polymeric coating particles may be comprised of any suitable hydrophilic gelling polymer known to those skilled in the art.
      <br/>
      For example, suitable hydrophilic gelling polymers include but are not limited to cellulosic polymers, such as methylcellulose, carboxymethylcellulose, hydroxypropylcellulose, hydroxypropylmethylcellulose, hydroxyethylcellulose, and the like; vinyl polymers, such as polyvinylpyrrolidone, polyvinyl alcohol, and the like; acrylic polymers and copolymers, such as acrylic acid polymer, methacrylic acid copolymers, ethyl acrylate-methyl methacrylate copolymers, and the like; and mixtures thereof.
      <br/>
      Currently, the preferred polymeric particles comprise hydroxypropylmethylcellulose.
    </p>
    <p num="43">
      Hydroxypropylmethylcellulose is a polymer which is available in many forms, including forms of different molecular weight, extremely different viscosity and different substitution grade.
      <br/>
      The inventors have also discovered that it is advantageous in certain applications to utilize mixtures or blends of two or more different forms of hydroxypropylmethylcellulose as the polymeric coating particles.
      <br/>
      In one preferred embodiment, the polymeric coating particles of the coating layer comprise a mixture of polymeric coating particles having differing molecular weights and solubility characteristics.
      <br/>
      For example, the coating layer may be comprised of polymeric coating particles comprising a mixture of a) hydroxypropylmethylcellulose having I) a typical weight percent substitution corresponding to 29% methoxyl and 8% hydroxypropoxyl groups, and ii) a nominal viscosity of a 2% watery solution at 20 (degree)  C. ranging from 5 to 100 mPa.s; and b) hydroxypropylmethylcellulose having I) a typical weight percent substitution corresponding to 22.1% methoxyl and 8.1% hydroxypropoxyl groups, and ii) a nominal viscosity of a 2% watery solution at 20 (degree)  C. ranging from 4,000 to 100,000 mPa.s. An example of the first type of hydroxypropylmethylcellulose is METHOCEL E5.RTM., and an example of the second type is METHOCEL K15M.RTM., both of which are commercially available from Colorcon.
    </p>
    <p num="44">
      The polymer(s) of the swellable polymeric coating layer partially hydrates on the outer surface thereof after ingestion to form a gel-like layer that acts as a skin, controlling the rate of erosion of the coating layer.
      <br/>
      As a consequence, the release or delivery of the pharmaceutically active agent contained within the core is inhibited for the predetermined period of time.
    </p>
    <p num="45">
      Grades of hydroxypropylmethylcellulose having different degrees of substitution also possess different rates of hydration.
      <br/>
      The inventors have discovered that by utilizing mixtures or blends of two or more polymers with different rates of hydration, it is possible to obtain a layer with improved characteristics in terms of the rate-controlled hydration of the same.
    </p>
    <p num="46">Because the formulations and methods of the present invention may include either a single hydroxypropylmethylcellulose or a blend of two or more different forms of hydroxypropylmethylcellulose as the powdered polymeric coating particles, for simplicity, the term "hydroxypropylmethylcellulose" as used herein, including the claims, refers to either a single hydroxypropylmethylcellulose or a blend of two or more forms of the polymer.</p>
    <p num="47">
      Alternatively, the swellable polymeric coating layer may be comprising of other substances which are capable of becoming freely permeable with an exactly defined kinetic following hydration in aqueous fluids.
      <br/>
      Such substances include polysaccharides, such as gelatin, saccharose, sorbitol, mannanes, and jaluronic acid; polyaminoacids; polyalcohols; polyglycols; and the like.
    </p>
    <p num="48">
      In addition to the foregoing, the swellable polymeric coating layer may also include additional excipients such as lubricants, flow promoting agents, plasticizers, antisticking agents, natural and synthetic flavorings and natural and synthetic colorants.
      <br/>
      Specific examples of additional excipients include polyethylene glycol, polyvinylpyrrolidone, talc, magnesium stearate, glyceryl behenate, stearic acid, and titanium dioxide.
    </p>
    <p num="49">
      After the powdered polymeric coating particles are applied to the wetted core, the steps of first, wetting the core with binder and second, coating with powdered polymeric coating particles are repeated sequentially one or more additional times in order to build the thickness of the swellable polymeric coating layer around the core.
      <br/>
      In other words, the alternating steps of wetting the core and coating with powdered polymeric coating particles are repeated in alternate fashion so that prior to each application of the powdered coating particles, the core is first wetted with binder solution.
      <br/>
      In this manner of repeated alternate applications of binder solution and powdered polymeric coating particles, the thickness of the swellable polymeric coating layer is increased to the desired measure.
      <br/>
      The number of repeated wetting and coating cycles is dependent upon the desired predetermined time for delivery of the active ingredient.
      <br/>
      The thicker the swellable polymeric coating layer around the core, the longer the latency, or lag time prior to delivery of the active ingredient.
      <br/>
      Typically, a sufficient number of wetting and coating cycles are performed so as to produce a core:coating layer weight ratio of between about 20:1 and about 1:5 inclusive, or a thickness in excess of about 10  MU m, and up to about 3 mm.
      <br/>
      Preferably, a sufficient number of coating cycles are completed so as to produce a core:coating layer weight ratio of between about 5:1 and about 1:3 inclusive, or a thickness of between about 50  MU m and about 1.5 mm.

      In an alternate embodiment of the present invention, the swellable polymeric coating layer may be applied to the core using conventional film (or spray) coating techniques or double press coating techniques which are known to those skilled in the art of pharmacy.

      In the embodiment wherein the swellable polymeric coating layer is applied to the core using film coating techniques, the hydrophilic gelling polymer is solubilized in an aqueous solution.
      <br/>
      Typically, the polymer used for film coating exhibits a viscosity ranging from about 3 to 100 mPa.s. at 25 (degree)  C. in a 2% aqueous solution.
