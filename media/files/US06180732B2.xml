    <heading>TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
    <p num="2">This invention relates to unique catalysts and processes using the unique catalyst for the production of isotactic and/or syndiotactic polymers which can be prepared essentially free of defects.</p>
    <p num="3">More particularly, the present invention relates to production of a isotactic and/or syndiotactic polyolefin by polymerization of ethylenically saturated olefins over a metallocene catalyst or catalyst precursor having a bridged cyclopentadienyl metallocene ligand bearing  ALPHA  and  BETA  substituents that stereodirect and stereolock the polymer chain and coordinated monomer into a specific orientation such that tactiospecific polymers are produced and that render the catalyst or catalyst precursor C2 or pseudo-C2 symmetric in the case of isospecific catalysts or catalyst precursors or Cs or pseudo-Cs symmetric in the case of syndiospecific catalysts or catalyst precursors.</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="4">
      Polyolefins can be prepared with variety of steric configurations that correspond to the manner in which each new monomer unit is added to a growing polyolefin chain.
      <br/>
      Four basic configurations are commonly recognized for polyolefins, atactic, hemi-isotactic, isotactic and syndiotactic.
      <br/>
      Of course, a given polymer may incorporate regions of each steric configuration, yet not exhibit the pure or nearly pure configuration.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      Atactic polymers exhibit no regular order of repeat units in the polymer chain, i.e., the substituents neither alternate nor maintain the same orientation relative to a hypothetical plane containing the polymer backbone (the plane is oriented such that the substituents on the asymmetric carbon atoms are either above or below the plane), but assume a random distribution of orientations.
      <br/>
      On the other hand, isotactic, syndiotactic, and hemi-isotactic polymers have unique and regularly repeating stereochemistries.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      The isotactic structure is defined as having the substituents attached to the pseudo-asymmetric carbon atoms with the same relative steric configuration.
      <br/>
      In a Fischer projection with the polymer backbone portrayed in the plane of the paper (the horizontal line), the vertical line segments representing the substituents all appear on the same side of the polymer as represented by the horizontal line:  (Chemical Structure image '1' not included in text)
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      Another way of describing the isotactic structure is through the use of NMR.
      <br/>
      In Bovey's NMR nomenclature, an isotactic pentad is represented by . . . mmmm . . . with each "m" representing a "meso" dyad or successive substituents on the same side in the plane.
      <br/>
      As is well known in the art, any deviation, disruption, or inversion about a pseudo-asymmetric carbon in the chain will lower the degree of isotacticity and crystallinity of the polymer.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      In contrast, the syndiotactic structure is typically described as having the substituents, that are attached to the pseudo-asymmetric carbon atoms, pseudo-enantiomorphically disposed, i.e., the substituents are oriented alternately and regularly above and below the main polymer chain.
      <br/>
      In a Fischer projection, the substituents alternate above and below the polymer backbone:  (Chemical Structure image '2' not included in text)
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      In NMR nomenclature, a syndiotactic pentad is represented by . . . rrrr . . . in which each "r" represents a "racemic" dyad, i.e., successive substituents on alternate sides of the plane.
      <br/>
      The percentage of r dyads in the chain determines the degree of syndiotacticity of the polymer.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      There are other variations in polymer structures as well.
      <br/>
      One such variant is the so-called hemi-isotactic polymers.
      <br/>
      Hemi-isotactic polymers are ones in which every other pseudo-asymmetric carbon atom has its substituent oriented on the same side relative to the plane containing the polymer backbone in a Fischer projection.
      <br/>
      While, the other pseudo-asymmetric carbon atoms can have their substituents oriented randomly either above or below the plane.
      <br/>
      Since only every other pseudo-asymmetric carbon is in an isotactic configuration, the term hemi is applied.
      <br/>
      In a Fischer projection, the substituent configurational sequence for a hemi-isotactic polymer is shown below:  (Chemical Structure image '3' not included in text)
    </p>
    <p num="11">
      Isotactic and syndiotactic polymers are crystalline polymers and are insoluble in cold xylene.
      <br/>
      Crystallinity distinguishes both syndiotactic and isotactic polymers from hemi-isotactic or atactic polymers that are soluble in cold xylene and non-crystalline.
      <br/>
      Atactic polymers are typically a waxy product and not crystalline.
      <br/>
      While it is possible for a catalyst to produce all four types of polymers (atactic, hemi-isotactic, isotactic and syndiotactic), it is desirable for a catalyst to produce predominantly or essentially exclusively isotactic or syndiotactic polymer with very few to essentially no defects.
    </p>
    <p num="12">
      Catalysts that produce isotactic polyolefins are disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,794,096 and 4,975,403, as well as European Pat.
      <br/>
      Appln. 0,537,130. Catalysts that produce syndiotactic polyolefins are disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,258,455, 3,305,538, 3,364,190, 4,892,851, 5,155,080, and 5,225,500.

      Catalysts that produce hemi-isotactic polyolefins are disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,036,034.
    </p>
    <p num="13">
      Although the catalysts described in the patents listed above are capable of generating polymers that have a relatively high stereoselectivity to a given tacticity, all are subject to various phenomena that introduce defects in the stereoregularity of the polymers.
      <br/>
      One common defect in the preparation of isotactic polymers is the occasional introduction of the wrong orientation disrupting the isotactic placement of monomer units, as shown below:  (Chemical Structure image '4' not included in text)
    </p>
    <p num="14">On the other hand, an analogous defect in syndiotactic polymers (i.e., the occasional introduction of the wrong orientation) is the so-called meso triad defect, shown below:  (Chemical Structure image '5' not included in text)</p>
    <p num="15">
      Thus, it would be a significant advancement in the art to be able to design and prepare stereospecific catalysts capable of generating stereoregular polymers essentially free of defects or where the amount and type of defects can be statistically controllable through catalyst design.
      <br/>
      Polypropylene with higher tactiospecificity will have a higher melting point and, therefore, will better suited for higher temperature applications such as the fabrication of ironable zippers for the clothing industry.
      <br/>
      Of course, other uses will be apparent as well.
    </p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="16">The present invention provides isospecific and/or syndiospecific  BETA  stereodirected and  ALPHA  stereolocked metallocene catalysts, processes for preparing the catalysts, and processes for preparing isotactic and/or syndiotactic polyolefins derived from polymerizing ethylenically unsaturated monomers containing three (3) or more carbon atoms using the stereodirected and stereolocked catalysts.</p>
    <p num="17">The stereodirected and stereolocked metallocene catalysts incorporate a bridged cyclopentadienyl ring (sometimes abbreviated as Cp ring) ligand systems where the Cp rings bear substituents, other than hydrogen, that stereodirect and stereolock the polymer chain end conformation where the stereodirecting substituents are a set of  BETA  Cp substituents having different steric requirements (i.e, one substituent is sterically larger than the other) and where the stereolocking substituents are a second set of  ALPHA  Cp substituents and such that the resulting catalyst precursor has C2 or pseudo-C2 symmetry for isospecificity or Cs or pseudo-Cs symmetry for syndiospecificity.</p>
    <p num="18">Catalysts or their precursor metallocenes in accordance with the present invention may be characterized by formula (I):  (Chemical Structure image '6' not included in text)</p>
    <p num="19">where: A is a structural bridge; Z and Z' are the same or different  ALPHA  and  BETA  substituted cyclopentadienyl radicals where the  BETA  substituents stereodirect and the  ALPHA  substituents stereolock an orientation of a growing polymer chain end which results in a tactiospecific monomer addition; Me is a Group 3, 4, or 5 metal or La, Lu, Nd or Sm, from the Periodic Table of Elements; Q is a hydrocarbyl radical or a halogen atom; P is a stable non-coordinating anion; k is an integer having a value from 1 to 3; and 1 is an integer having a value from 0 to 2.</p>
    <p num="20">Isospecific catalysts or catalyst precursors of formula (I) are characterized by having at least one substituted cyclopentadienyl radical having either a 2,4 or 3,5 substitution pattern and the other substituted cyclopentadienyl radical either having an identical or different 2,4 or 3,5 substitution pattern such that the resulting catalyst precursor has either C2 or pseudo-C2 symmetry and such that the the  BETA  substituents stereodirect and the  ALPHA  substituents stereolock the orientation of the growing polymer chain end which results in a  PI  face selective, isospecific monomer addition.</p>
    <p num="21">Syndiospecific catalysts or catalyst precursors of formula (I) are characterized by having at least one substituted cyclopentadienyl radical having either a 3,4 or 2,5 substitution pattern and the other cyclopentadienyl ring having either a 2,5 or 3,4 substitution pattern, respectively, or bilateral or pseudo-bilateral symmetry (i.e., being symmetric with respect to a bisecting mirror plane containing the ring atom bonding to the bridging group A) and such that the resulting catalyst precursor has either Cs or pseudo-Cs symmetry and such that the the  BETA  substituents stereodirect and the  ALPHA  substituents stereolock the orientation of the growing polymer chain end which results in a  PI  face selective, syndiospecific addition,</p>
    <p num="22">
      The present invention further provides a process for producing isotactic and syndiotactic polyolefins comprising introducing at least one of the catalyst components of formula (I) into a polymerization reaction zone containing an ethylenically unsaturated monomer.
      <br/>
      In addition, a co-catalyst such as an alkyl aluminum or a aluminoxane is added into the reaction zone or combined with the metallocenes of formula (I) prior to introduction into the zone.
      <br/>
      For cationic catalysts of formula (I) (l=1 or 2), an ion pair is reacted with the neutral metallocene (l=0) to form a cationic metallocene either prior to or concurrent with introduction in the zone.
    </p>
    <p num="23">
      Furthermore, the catalyst components of formula (I) can be pre-polymerized prior to introduction into the reaction zone and/or prior to the stabilization of the reaction conditions in the zone.
      <br/>
      Moreover, the present invention can also be practiced to produce intimate blends of isotactic and syndiotactic polymers by introducing a catalyst of formula (I) designed for each tacticity into the reaction zone.
      <br/>
      The preferred application of the invention is in the production of isotactic polypropylene, syndiotactic polypropylene or mixtures thereof.
    </p>
    <p num="24">The present invention also includes processes for preparing the  BETA  stereodirected,  ALPHA  stereolocked metallocene ligand systems, methods for preparing the catalysts of formula (I) and methods for activating the catalysts of formula (I) into catalytically active polymerization agents.</p>
    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
    <p num="25">
      The inventor has found that catalysts can be prepared which have improved stereospecificity in the preparation of isotactic and syndiotactic polyolefins relative to prior art analogs.
      <br/>
      These uniquely designed catalysts have as a key feature a stereorigid, bridged substituted cyclopentadienyl ligand system that simultaneously stereodirects and stereolocks the growing chain end attached to the metallocene catalysts in a specific conformation where the degree of stereoselectivity can be controlled to yield isotactic and syndiotactic polymers with essentially no defects compared to prior art catalyst systems.
    </p>
    <p num="26">
      The  ALPHA  and  BETA  substituents on each Cp ring are strategically situated and sized to direct and lock the growing polymer chain end into a specific conformation that results in tactiospecific monomer addition and in the formation of polymers with enhanced and/or tailored stereospecificity, higher or variable melting points, and higher or variable crystallinity over prior art polymers.
      <br/>
      The catalyst are designed wherein conformational directing and locking is achieved by having non-hydrogen  ALPHA  and  BETA  Cp substituents (proximal and distal substituents relative to the ring carbon bonded to the structural bridging group A) that act in concert to direct and lock the growing polymer chain end into an orientation that results in the formation of either iso or syndio specific monomer addition and such that the overall ligand has either C2 or pseudo-C2 or Cs or pseudo-Cs symmetry depending on whether the catalyst is isospecific or syndiospecific, respectively.
      <br/>
      The steric bulk of the substituents must be sufficient to direct and lock both the growing polymer chain end into a specific orientation and, hence, to define the approach and coordination of a monomer unit so that an essentially pure stereoregular polymer can be produced.
    </p>
    <p num="27">Polymers with enhanced stereoregularity are characterized by having high melting points and high cystallinity, thus making them more useful as a high temperature plastic for making structural plastic components for a wide variety of uses such as microwave cooking surfaces and the like.</p>
    <p num="28">
      The inventor has also found that by controlling the  ALPHA  and  BETA  substituents relative steric size, catalysts can be formed that insert statistically controllable defects into the resulting polymers.
      <br/>
      The inventor has also found that catalysts of the present invention can be designed to produce hemi-isotactic polymers with little or no defects in the isotactic part.
      <br/>
      The inventor has also found that intimate mixtures of essentially pure isotactic and/or syndiotactic polymers with less stereoregular polymers can be prepared by polymerizing monomer in the presence of the tactiospecific catalysts of the present invention in combination with less tactiospecific catalysts of the present invention and/or prior art catalysts.
    </p>
    <p num="29">
      The present invention involves the use of certain  BETA  stereodirected and  ALPHA  stereolocked, stereorigid metallocenes as catalysts or catalyst precursors for preparing isospecific polyolefins, syndiospecific polyolefins or intimate mixtures thereof.
      <br/>
      Of course, one skilled in the art should recognize that the metallocenes catalysts of formula (I) actually represent precursors to the actual catalytically active species that ultimately polymerizes the olefinic monomers.
      <br/>
      Typically, the metallocene catalysts of formula (I) can be combined with co-catalysts to provide a more practical catalytically active agent.
    </p>
    <p num="30">
      The term metallocene, in accordance with normal art usage, denotes an organometallic coordination compound in which two cyclopentadienyl containing ligands are bonded to or "sandwiched" about a central metal atom.
      <br/>
      The metal atom may be a transition metal or transition metal halide, alkyl, alkoxy, halide or the like.
      <br/>
      Such structures are sometimes referred to as "molecular sandwiches" because the two cyclopentadienyl ligands are oriented above and below the plane containing the coordinated metal atom (Me in formula (I)).
      <br/>
      Similarly, the term "cationic metallocene" means a metallocene which carries a positive charge, i.e., the metallocene complex is a cation associated with a stable non-coordinating or pseudo-non-coordinating anion.
    </p>
    <p num="31">
      The metallocenes used in the present invention are  BETA  stereorigid,  ALPHA  stereodirected, and stereolocked such that the conformation of the growing polymer chain end is locked in such a way that the tacticity of the resulting polymer is specifically controlled.
      <br/>
      Stereorigidity is imparted to the metallocene ligand by a chemical bridge connecting the Cp rings.
      <br/>
      The bridging group prevents the Cp rings from rotating and undergoing fluctuational changes leading to isomerizations.
      <br/>
      Stereodirecting and stereolocking are effectuated by placing appropriate  ALPHA  and  BETA  substituents on the two Cp rings that force the polymer chain end to occupy a sterically preferred orientation relative to the coordinating metal Me and the substituents on the Cp rings and the non-Cp ligand x-y plane.
      <br/>
      Of course, it should be recognized that the stereodirecting and stereolocking substituents interact primary with the carbon center one carbon removed from the carbon coordinated to the metal Me.

      In the case of isospecific catalysts or catalyst precursors, each Cp ring will bear a stereodirecting and a stereolocking substituent.

Another preferred class of isospecific catalysts or catalyst precursors of formula (I) will have one Cp ring with either a 2,4 or 3,5 substitution pattern and the other Cp containing group will be symmetric or pseudo-symmetric with respect to a bisecting mirror plane containing the bridgehead ring carbon (the ring carbon bonded to the A group), e.g., dimethylsilenyl�3-t-butyl-5-methyl-CpFlu�ZrCl2 where Flu stands for the fluorenyl ring system.

      The unique and novel feature of the catalysts of the present invention are that the catalysts are stereorigid and stereodirect and lock the polymer chain end such that tactiospecific monomer addition can occur.
      <br/>
      These characteristics can cause the polymers generated using these catalysts to have near 100% stereoregularity.
      <br/>
      The catalyst can be designed by controlling the  ALPHA  and  BETA  substituents to virtually eliminate the insertion of the wrong  PI  face selectivity of monomer during chain propagation.
      <br/>
      Thus, the bridging group A imparts the stereorigidity to the catalysts of formula (I), while in concert the  BETA -substituents stereodirect and  ALPHA -substituents stereolock the chain end attached to the catalysts and/or catalyst precursors of formula (I) and thereby defines the stereochemistry of addition of each successive monomer unit to the growing chain.

      It is reasonably supposed from the prior art that the relative stereo specificities, though higher or statistically controllable than previously available with other metallocene analogs, can be tailored with a number of strategies.

      The single carbon bridged versions have been found to be more stereospecific than the silicon bridged analogs for syndiotactic specific catalysts; while the carbon bridged versions have always been less stereospecific than the silicon bridged analogs for isospecific catalysts.

      It is expected that the larger the steric requirements are for the stereodirecting and stereolocking  ALPHA  and  BETA  substituents, usually, the more stereospecific the catalyst will be.

    <p num="83">While the applicant's invention is not to be restricted by theory, it is believed that neutral metallocenes of certain metals are converted to the active cationic complexes by reaction with the MAO in the manner as disclosed by Zambelli, A. et al., "Isotactic Polymerization of Propene: Homogenous Catalysts Based on Group 4 Metallocenes Without Methylaluminoxane", Macromolecules 1989, 22, pages 2186-2189.</p>
    <p num="84">
      The catalyst precursors used in the present invention may be prepared by procedures similar to those disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,892,851, while the active cationic catalysts may be produced by simply converting the neutral metallocene into the cationic state following procedures such as those disclosed in European applications 277,003 and 277,004 or more preferably, by reaction with triphenylcarbenium boronates.
      <br/>
      Similarly, alcohol--B(PhF5)3 complexes can be used as anionic precursors for forming the active cationic metallocenes of the present invention where the alcoholic proton reacts with an alkyl group on the coordinating metal atoms to generate a cationic metallocene and a alkoxide--B(PhF5)3 anion.

    <p num="85">
      The chain-end conformational locking catalysts of formula (I) can also be converted to supported heterogeneous catalysts by depositing the catalysts on supports including, without limitation, silica, alumina, magnesium dichloride, polystyrene beads, and like.

      The supported analogs of the present catalyst can improve the bulk density of the polymer as further described in Canadian Pat.

      The catalyst can also be chemically linked to the support by placing functional groups with ion pairs or Lewis acid centers or Lewis base centers on the ligands and/or supports.
      <br/>
      Supporting can also be achieved by using large (oligomeric or polymeric) insoluble anions as counter ions.
    </p>
    <p num="87">The catalysts of the present invention can be used to prepare isospecific, syndiospecific, hemi-isospecific, and aspecific polymerizations, not only of propylene, but for all  ALPHA -olefins such as 1-butene, 1-pentene, 1-hexene, 4-methyl-1-pentene, CH2.dbd.CH(CH2)p Si(CH3)3 where p is practical integer, and the like.</p>
    <p num="88">
      One of ordinary skill should recognize that some of the ligands of the present invention may give rise to meso and rac catalysts.
      <br/>
      The stereospecific rac catalysts can be separated from the meso forms by fractional crystallization, solvent extraction, or chromatography.
    </p>
    <p num="89">
      The catalysts of the present invention can obviously be used in conjunction with each other, all other metallocene catalysts, TiCl3 /DEAC, and or TiCl4 /MgCl2 /TEAL catalysts having internal electron donors such as diisobutylypthalate and external donors such as diphenyldimethoxysllane, methanol, etc. to produce polymers with mixed stereochemical composition, distributions and tailored molecular weight distributions.
      <br/>
      Reactor blends of polymers with optimized physical, thermal, mechanical, and Theological properties can be tailored to produce the optimum mixture for specific applications requiring high melt strength, high clarity, high impact strength, and high rates of crystallization, simply by mixing catalyst species together in appropriate ratios.
    </p>
    <p num="90">
      The catalysts of the present invention clearly have the potential to influence the rate of termination by  BETA -hydride elimination reactions.
      <br/>
      This, therefore, provides a novel ligand effect for controlling polymer molecular weights.
      <br/>
      These catalysts can be exploited by used to tailor molecular weights and hence molecular weight distributions with mixed species of the catalysts and any other class of catalysts.
      <br/>
      This would be advantageous in tailoring the polymer properties in HDPE, LLDPE, i-PP, s-PP, etc.
      <br/>
      Similarly the chain-end conformation locking substituent will influence the rate of reactivity of the new metallocenes with  ALPHA -olefins such as propylene, butene and hexene.
      <br/>
      The new ligand effects on the catalyst reactivity ratios can be exploited to produce reactor blends with varying composition, sequence and molecular weight distributions.
      <br/>
      Similarly, the catalysts can be reasonably be expected to provide improved tailored grades of polypropylene and propylene-ethylene high impact copolymers as reactor blends, random ethylene-propylene copolymers and terpolymers of ethylene, propylene and other monomers, or from reactors in series including fluidized and stirred gas phase polymerizations.
    </p>
    <p num="91">The catalysts of the present invention can also be used to generate copolymers of olefins and copolymers of olefins and dienes with varying degrees of tactiospecificity and 1,2 diene insertion.</p>
    <p num="92">
      The generalized methods that follow described the preparation of the catalyst and/or catalyst precursors.
      <br/>
      It is important that the catalyst complex be pure as usually low molecular weight, amorphous polymer can be produced by impure catalysts.
    </p>
    <p num="93">Generally, the preparation of the metallocene complex consists of forming and isolating the bridged bis Cp containing ring ligands which are then (aromatized and) reacted with a halogenated metal to form the complex.</p>
    <p num="94">
      The synthetic procedures are generally performed under an inert gas atmosphere using a glove box or Schlenk techniques.
      <br/>
      The synthesis process generally comprises the steps of preparing dianionic ligand and coordinating the dianionic ligand with a metal Me and purifying the coordinating metal-ligand system.
    </p>
    <p num="95">The synthesis of the ligands of the present invention can be accomplished by contacting an appropriately substituted fulvene with an appropriately substituted cyclopentadienyl containing anion under reaction conditions sufficient to produce a bridged structure having the requisite substituted Cp containing rings to yield ligands that will ultimately be used to prepare the unique catalyst of formulas (I-VI).</p>
    <p num="96">
      Fulvene is cyclopentadiene with an exo-cyclic methylene carbon at the 1 position of cyclopentadiene ring.
      <br/>
      The exo-cyclic methylene carbon is defined as the 6 position of fulvene.
      <br/>
      Since this carbon can ultimately become the bridging group A in formula (I), the preferred fulvenes for the preparation of the present catalysts are typically 6,6-disubstituted fulvenes so that the resulting bridging group is a tertiary carbon.
      <br/>
      The fulvenes useful in preparing the ligands of the present invention are generally 6,6 disubstituted.
    </p>
    <p num="97">
      As noted previously, a preferred mode of converting the neutral metallocenes to cationic metallocene catalyst useful in the present invention involves reaction of the neutral metallocenes with a triphenylcarbenium boronate.
      <br/>
      A preferred reactant is triphenylcarbeniumtetrakis(pentafluorophenyl)boronate.
    </p>
    <p num="98">
      The catalysts of the present invention can also be made into efficient pre-polymerized catalysts by the methods disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,893,989, 4,287,328, 4,316,966 and 5,122,583 incorporated herein by reference.
      <br/>
      Essentially, the catalysts are used to polymerize monomer on a small scale.
      <br/>
      The pre-polymerized catalysts can be prepared in the presence of co-catalysts such as the ones described previously.
    </p>
    <p num="99">
      The pre-polymerized catalysts can then be introduced into a reaction zone containing monomer.
      <br/>
      The resulting polymerization can show greatly improved catalytic efficiencies.
      <br/>
      The preferred methods for using pre-polymerized catalysts of the present invention are: (1) contacting a pre-polymerized catalyst of formula (I) with a co-catalyst and introducing the catalyst into a polymerization reaction zone containing monomer and (2) contacting a pre-polymerized catalyst of formula (I) with a co-catalyst and introducing the catalyst into a polymerization reaction zone containing monomer.
      <br/>
      Of course, the pre-polymerized catalysts of formula (I) can be introduced into the reaction zone in a stream either separately or in conjunction with separate streams containing the co-catalyst and/or electron donors.
    </p>
    <p num="100">Preferred pre-polymerized catalysts of the present invention have a weight ratio of polymer/catalyst of approximately 0.1-100 with ratios of less than 10 being particularly preferred.</p>
    <p num="101">The syntheses are conveniently done at room temperature or lower in low boiling solvents which are readily evaporated in vacuo.</p>
    <p num="102">A general scheme of preparing the catalyst of formula (I) is out lined below for the synthesis of Me2Si(3-t-butyl-5-methyl)(fluorenyl)ZrCl2 as a catalyst precursor.</p>
    <p num="103">
      3-methyl-6,6-dimethylfulvene is prepared from the methyl cyclopentadienyl anion and acetone; as shown by Little et al in the Journal of Organic Chemistry.
      <br/>
      Reaction of 3-methyl-6,6-dimethylfulvene with one equivalent of methyl lithium in THF results in the Li salt of the 1-t-butyl-3-methyl-cyclopentadienyl anion.
      <br/>
      Separately, 0.5 equivalents of Me2 SiCi2 in pentane at -78 (degree)  C. to 22 (degree)  C. is reacted with the fluorenyl anion, followed by overnight stirring, results in ClMe2 Si(fluorenyl).
      <br/>
      The ClMe2 Si(fluorenly) is then added to the 1-t-butyl-3-methyl-cyclopentadienyl anion resulting in the formation of Me2 Si(3-t-butyl-5-methyl-cyclopentadienyl)(fluorenyl).
      <br/>
      The ligand precursor is isolated by extraction from LiCl with a suitable hydrocarbon solvent such as pentane, methylene chloride, or toluene, followed by solvent evaporation.
      <br/>
      The ligand dianion is obtained in THF from reaction of Me2 Si(3-t-butyl-5-methyl-cyclopentadienyl)(fluorenyl) with 2 equivalents of methyl lithium.
      <br/>
      Me2 Si(3-t-butyl-5-methyl-cyclopentadienyl)(fluorenyl) Li2.n(THF) mixtures with ZrCl4 in pentane or cold methylene chloride yield Me2 Si(3-t-butyl-5-methyl-cyclopentadienyl)(fluorenyl)ZrCl2.
