      An oil pump attachment structure is provided for an engine.
      <br/>
      The oil pump attachment structure includes an oil pump 9 coaxially driven by the crankshaft 2.
      <br/>
      A pump housing 10 of the pump 9 is disposed between a front cover 7 for covering timing chains 5a, 5b and crank sprockets 3a, 3b while leaving a clearance against the front cover 7.
      <br/>
      The pump housing 10 is also fastened to a cylinder block 1 so as to straddle the timing chains 5a, 5b, through stays 11a, 11b, 11c by bolts 12.
      <br/>
      With this arrangement, pulsation produced during the operation of the oil pump 9 is not transmitted to the front cover 7 directly, so that noise radiated from a front face of the front cover 7 can be reduced.

    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="1">
      1.
      <br/>
      Field of the Invention
    </p>
    <p num="2">The present invention relates to an oil pump attachment structure for an engine and more particularly, it relates to an oil pump attachment structure for attaching an oil pump coaxially driven by a crankshaft.</p>
    <p num="3">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
    <p num="4">As an earlier structure for attaching the oil pump coaxially driven by the crankshaft, there is disclosed an attachment structure where a pump housing is carried inside a front cover for covering a timing chain and disposed between the front cover and a sprocket for a timing chain (Japanese Patent Publication No. 5-059924).</p>
    <p num="5">There is also another structure where a pump housing is disposed between the sprocket for the timing chain and a cylinder block, while the pump housing is either projected from the cylinder block for fixture or embedded in a recess formed on a front side of the cylinder block.</p>
    <p num="6">However, in case of the attachment structure allowing the front cover to carry the pump housing, the pulsation produced when operating the oil pump directly oscillates the front cover to cause the noise to radiate from the front side of the front cover, so that the engine noise is increased on the front side of the engine disadvantageously.</p>
    <p num="7">
      In case of the structure where the pump housing is disposed between the sprocket for the timing chain and the cylinder block, the running line of the timing chain is apart from the front face of the cylinder block due to the provision of the pump housing.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the driving force of the timing chain is applied on a camshaft's portion having a large overhang from journals supporting a camshaft while the whole length of the cylinder head is increased.
      <br/>
      Consequently, there is a possibility of causing the damping performance to be deteriorated due to the reduced rigidity of the camshaft and the journals or causing the weight of the cylinder block to be increased in order to ensure the rigidity of the camshaft and the journals.
    </p>
    <p num="8">In case of the structure where the pump housing is embedded in the front side of the cylinder block, there is produced a problem of causing the cylinder block to be large-sized.</p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="9">Under such a circumstance, it is an object of the present invention to provide an oil pump attachment structure for an engine, which is capable of preventing the pulsation generated at the operation of the oil pump from propagating to the front cover and avoiding the running line of the timing chain from projecting forward thereby preventing the cylinder block from being large-sized.</p>
    <p num="10">According to the invention, the above-mentioned object is accomplished by an oil pump attachment structure for an engine having a valve system where at least one camshaft is driven by a crankshaft through at least one timing chain, the oil pump attachment structure comprising:</p>
    <p num="11">
      an oil pump coaxially driven by the crankshaft, for supplying oil to respective engine sections, the oil pump including a pump housing;
      <br/>
      wherein the pump housing is disposed between a front cover for covering the timing chain and a sprocket for the timing chain, while leaving a clearance relative to the front cover; and
      <br/>
      wherein the pump housing is fastened to a cylinder block of the engine so as to straddle the timing chain.
    </p>
    <p num="12">
      Since the pump housing is fastened to the cylinder block and the clearance is defined between the pump housing and the front cover, the pulsation produced during the operation of the oil pump is not transmitted to the front cover directly.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the noise radiated from the front face of the front cover is reduced thereby to decrease the noise occurring on the front side of the engine.
    </p>
    <p num="13">The above and other features and advantages of this invention will become apparent, and the invention itself will best be understood, from a study of the following description and appended claims, with reference to the attached drawings showing one preferred embodiment of the invention.</p>
    <heading>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading>
    <p num="14">
      FIG. 1 is a front view of a cylinder block, showing an oil pump attachment structure in accordance with an embodiment of the invention; and
      <br/>
      FIG. 2 is a side view showing an end of a crankshaft, on the front side of the engine in accordance with the embodiment of the invention.
    </p>
    <heading>DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading>
    <p num="15">Referring to the attached drawings, we now describe an embodiment of the present invention.</p>
    <p num="16">FIG. 1 is a front view of a cylinder block of a V-type engine, in accordance with the embodiment of the invention, while FIG. 2 is a side view showing an end of a crankshaft, on the front side of the engine.</p>
    <p num="17">
      In FIGS. 1 and 2, a crankshaft 2 is held by a cylinder block 1 through a bearing 1a.
      <br/>
      The crankshaft 2 has a part formed to project toward the front side of the engine.
      <br/>
      On such a projecting part of the crankshaft 2 close to the cylinder block 1, two crank sprockets (sprockets for timing chains) 3a, 3b are juxtaposed in the axial direction, corresponding to respective banks of the engine.
      <br/>
      Wound over the crank sprockets 3a, 3b and respective cam sprockets 4a, 4b of the respective banks are respective timing chains 5a, 5b through which cam shafts (intake cam shafts and exhaust cam shafts) of the respective banks are driven by the crankshaft 2.
    </p>
    <p num="18">At a leading end of the crankshaft 2, a crank pulley 6 is attached to drive various accessories, for example, an alternator, a compressor for air conditioner, a power steering pump, etc. through accessory belts.</p>
    <p num="19">
      A front cover 7 is fastened on the front side of the cylinder block 1, for covering a valve drive system consisting of the crank sprockets 3a, 3b, the cam sprockets 4a, 4b, the timing chains 5a, 5b and so on.
      <br/>
      The front cover 7 is provided with an opening about which an oil seal 8 is fitted and through which the leading end of the crankshaft 2 projects outward.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the crank pulley 6 is positioned outside the front cover 7.
    </p>
    <p num="20">Coaxially driven by the crankshaft 2 is an oil pump 9 which includes a pump housing 10 disposed between the front cover 7 and the crank sprockets 3a, 3b.</p>
    <p num="21">
      In operation, the oil pump 9 does suck up oil in an oil pan attached to the bottom of the cylinder block 1 through an oil strainer and sequentially supplies the oil to respective engine sections, such as a cylinder head, a crank shaft, etc. through the intermediary of an oil filter.
      <br/>
      The oil pump 9 further includes a rotor 9a accommodated in a pump chamber defined by the pump housing 10.
      <br/>
      In the pump housing 10, the rotor 9a rotates together with the crankshaft 2 and performs the sucking and discharging operation of the oil.
      <br/>
      The pump housing 10 is fastened to the cylinder block 1 so as to straddle the timing chains 5a, 5b, through three stays 11a, 11b, 11c.
      <br/>
      These stays 11a, 11b, 11c are arranged so as to avoid the crank sprockets 3a, 3b and the timing chains 5a, 5b.
      <br/>
      Note, depending on the arrangement situations, the number of stays may be increased to five in order to enhance the supporting rigidity for the oil pump 9.
    </p>
    <p num="22">
      The pump housing 10 is composed of a main body 10a and a back lid 10b separable from each other.
      <br/>
      Being formed integrally with the back lid 10b, the stays 11a, 11b, 11c are provided with through-holes 13 for allowing bolts 12 to inserted thereinto.
      <br/>
      The cylinder block 1 is provided, on a front end face thereof, with internal threading portions 14 into which the bolts 12 are to be screwed and which are positioned so as to coincide with the stays 11a, 11b, 11c, respectively.
      <br/>
      By fastening the bolts 12 passing through the through-holes 13 into the respective internal threading portions 14, the pump housing 10 is secured on the cylinder block 1.
    </p>
    <p num="23">
      In the axial direction of the crankshaft 2 defined by the lengths of the stays 11a, 11b, 11c, the pump housing 10 is disposed between the crank sprockets 3a, 3b and the front cover 7.
      <br/>
      In order to prevent the rotating crank sprockets 3a, 3b from interfering with the pump housing 10, a clearance is ensured between the pump housing 10 and the crank sprockets 3a, 3b.
      <br/>
      Similarly, a clearance is also defined between the pump housing 10 and the front cover 7.
    </p>
    <p num="24">
      Note, it is preferable to establish the stay 11c in a position capable of restricting the vibration due to the oil strainer.
      <br/>
      In detail, it is desirable to position the stay 11c in the vicinity of a high-pressurized area of the oil pump 9, that is, on the opposite side of an "oil strainer" attachment part 15.
    </p>
    <p num="25">
      In case of the above-mentioned arrangement, since the front cover 7 does not come in direct contact with the pump housing 10, the pulsation caused by the operation of the oil pump is not transmitted to the front cover 7 directly.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the noise radiated from the front face of the front cover 7 is reduced, so that it is possible to reduce the noise level on the front side of the engine.
    </p>
    <p num="26">
      Additionally, since the oil pump 9 is disposed between the crank sprockets 3a, 3b and the front cover 7 and therefore, the sprockets 3a, 3b are positioned in the closest position to the cylinder block 1, it is possible to establish the running line of the timing chains 5a, 5b in the vicinity of the cylinder block 1.
      <br/>
      Consequently, it is further possible to prevent the whole length of the cylinder head from its increasing and also prevent the sound and vibration performance from being deteriorated due to the insufficiency in rigidity of the camshaft and journals.
      <br/>
      Moreover, it is possible to avoid the cylinder block 1 from being large-sized.
    </p>
    <p num="27">The entire contents of Japanese Patent Application No. 10-256621 (filed on Sep. 10, 1998) is incorporated herein by reference.</p>
