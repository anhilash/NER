    <heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">
      The present invention relates to liquid laundry detergent compositions useful for hand-washing fabric, comprising one or more  BETA -ketoester pro-fragrance compounds which release fragrance raw material alcohols, ketones, and mixtures thereof, thereby providing a "freshness" or "clean" scent to fabric.
      <br/>
      The present invention also relates to a method for providing a fragrance benefit to laundered fabric by contacting soiled fabric with a laundry detergent composition described herein.
    </p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="3">
      In addition to the removal of stains, dirt, soil, grime, and grease from fabric, laundry detergent formulators have attempted to deliver a "fresh" or "clean" odor to washed clothing to provide an olfactory aesthetic benefit and to serve as a signal that the product is effective.
      <br/>
      Laundry detergent compositions, including rinse-added fabric softeners and dryer-added substrates, are currently formulated with perfiune and fragrance ingredients which are aesthetically pleasing to the consumer and which attempt to deliver a prolonged "fragrance" or "pleasurable smell" to fabric which has been laundered via automatic appliance.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      Liquid laundry detergent compositions are typically formulated with adjunct materials which are designed and formulated to work in high or low density liquid laundry detergent compositions.
      <br/>
      For example, certain enzymes, bleaches, soil release agents, and dispersants which comprise granular laundry detergent compositions may not be compatible with liquid laundry detergent formulations.
      <br/>
      Therefore, liquid laundry detergents comprise adjunct materials which are especially designed to fit the special needs of liquid compositions.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      Attempts have been made to deliver perfiume ingredients, especially fragrance raw material alcohols and ketones, which have an enduring fragrance benefit, from liquid laundry detergent compositions.
      <br/>
      The admixture of fragrance and perfume raw materials into a perfume component, which is subsequently added to the liquid laundry composition, may provide a short-term fragrance benefit, however, these materials have, in general, failed to provide a lasting fragrance benefit to fabric.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      Accordingly, there remains a need in the art for a fragrance delivery system wherein fragrance raw materials are delivered to fabric by way of a liquid laundry detergent composition comprising one or more pro-fragrance or pro-accord compounds having high substantivity and water dispersing properties which provides the cleaned clothing or fabric with a "fresh" or "clean" smell for a protracted period after washing.
      <br/>
      The aforementioned laundry detergent compositions are typically granular detergents or laundry bars

    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="8">
      The present invention meets the aforementioned needs in that it has been surprisingly discovered that fragrance raw materials can be delivered onto fabric "through the wash" by way of a fragrance delivery system comprised of single precursor pro-fragrance or pro-accord compounds having high fabric substantivity and that these compounds release fragrance raw materials thereby imparting a "fresh" or "clean" aesthetic odor benefit to the fabric.
      <br/>
      In addition to the short-term pleasurable odor benefits, the profragrances or pro-accords according to the present invention continue to release their fragrance raw materials for as long as several weeks depending upon the structure of the pro-fragrance.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      The pro-fragrances and pro-accords described herein comprise fragrance raw material alcohols in a stable, releasable  BETA -ketoester form.
      <br/>
      The pro-fragrance containing liquid laundry detergent compositions of the present invention can comprise any number of profragrances which when taken together are capable of releasing complex perfiume fragrances.
      <br/>
      However, the  BETA -ketoesters of the present invention which are pro-accords are capable of undergoing chemical transformation and thereby releasing one or more fragrance raw materials in addition to the fragrance raw material alcohol used to prepare the original parent pro-accord.
      <br/>
      In addition, the pro-fragrances and pro-accords of the present invention are suitable for delivery of any type of fragrance "characteristic" desired by the formulator.

    <p num="24">Fragrance Delivery System</p>
    <p num="25">
      The laundry detergent compositions of the present invention comprise a fragrance delivery system which lays down one or more "pro-fragrance" compounds onto the fabric surface during the laundry wash cycle which are capable of releasing a fragrance raw material alcohol or in the case of "pro-accords" the compounds are capable of releasing a mixture of fragrance raw materials.
      <br/>
      The key advantages provided by the  BETA -ketoester pro-fragrances or pro-accords of the present invention include chemical stability in the final product matrix, ease of formulation into the product matrix, and a highly desirable rate of fragrance raw material alcohol release.
    </p>
    <p num="26">
      The  BETA -ketoester profragrances and pro-accords of the present invention begin delivering the fragrance raw materials to the fabric surface once the fabric is exposed to the laundry liquor.
      <br/>
      For the purposes of the present invention the term "pro-fragrance" is defined as "a  BETA -ketoester which releases a fragrance raw material alcohol" whereas a "pro-accord" is defined as " BETA -ketoester which release two or more fragrance raw materials".
      <br/>
      For the purposes of the present invention, however, since a material that is a "pro-fragrance" in one embodiment can serve as a "pro-accord" in a different embodiment, the term "pro-fragrance" is used interchangeably with the term "pro-accord" and either term may be used to stand equally well for either  BETA -ketoester pro-fragrance molecules,  BETA -ketoester pro-accord molecules, or both collectively.
      <br/>
      These "pro-fragrance" compounds are rapidly deposited onto the fabric surface due to the high fabric substantivity of the compounds and once deposited, begin to release the fragrance raw material alcohols during the wash and drying cycles.
      <br/>
      Because the  BETA -ketoester "pro-fragrances" of the present invention generally have a higher molecular weight than uncombined fragrance raw material alcohols are therefore less volatile, the "pro-fragrances" of the present invention are a means for effectively delivering fragrance raw materials to the fabric surface even upon exposure to prolonged heating which occurs during automatic dryer usage.
      <br/>
      Once the laundry cycle is complete, that is the clothing or fabric is dry and ready for use, the "pro-fragrance" continues to release the fragrance raw material alcohol and because this release of material is protracted, the fabric remains "fresh" and "clean" smelling longer.
    </p>
    <p num="27">For the purposes of the present invention "fragrance raw materials" are herein defined as alcohols and ketones having a molecular weight of at least about 100 g/mol and which are useful in imparting an odor, fragrance, essence, or scent either alone or in combination with other "fragrance raw material alcohols and ketones".</p>
    <p num="28">
      Most of the fragrance raw material alcohols which comprise the  BETA -ketoester "pro-fragrances" of the present invention are not deliverable as individual compounds to fabric via the laundry cycle either due to solubility factors (not sufficiently soluble in the liquid laundry liquor), substantivity factors (do not sufficiently adhere to fabric surface), or volatility factors (evaporation during storage).
      <br/>
      Therefore, the profragrances described herein are a means for delivering certain fragrance raw materials to fabric which could not have previously been effectively or efficiently delivered.

      According to the present invention all isomers of a fragrance raw material whether in the form of the pro-fragrance or the released fragrance raw material, are suitable for use in the present invention.
      <br/>
      When optical isomers are possible, fragrance raw materials may be included as either the separate chemical isomer or as the combined racemic mixture.
      <br/>
      For example, 3,7-dimethyl-6-octen-1-ol, commonly known by those of ordinary skill in the art as  BETA -citronellol or cephrol, comprises a pair of optical isomers, R--(+)- BETA -citronellol and S--(-)- BETA -citronellol.
      <br/>
      Each of these materials separately or as a racemic pair are suitable for use as fragrance raw materials in the present invention.
      <br/>
      However, those skilled in the art of fragrances, by utilization of the present invention, should not disregard the olfactory differences that individual optical isomers, admixtures of optical isomers or admixtures of positional isomers imparl By way of example, carvone, 2-methyl-5-(1-methylethenyl)-2-cyclohexene-1-one exists as two isomers; d-carvone and l-carvone. d-Carvone is found in oil of caraway and renders a completely different fragrance from l-carvone which is found in spearmint oil.
      <br/>
      According to the present invention a pro-fragrance which releases d-carvone will result in a different scent or fragrance than one which releases l-carvone.
      <br/>
      The same applies to l-carvone.
      <br/>
      In addition, isomers such as cis/trans isomers, for example, nerol (3,7-dimethyl-cis-2,6-octadien-1-ol) and geraniol (3,7-dimethyl-trans-2,6-octadien-1-ol), are well known to those skilled in the art of perfumery and these two terpene alcohols, which commonly occur as an admixture, have different fragrance characteristics.
      <br/>
      Therefore, when formulating fragrance raw materials which comprise mixtures of isomers such as nerol/geraniol, the formulator must also take into account whether different sources of raw material have different ratios of isomers.

    <p num="65">
      The formulator is not limited to the delivery of one type of fragrance, for example a top, middle, or base fragrance raw material note.
      <br/>
      Instead a mixture of top notes, a mixture of top and middle notes, or any combination of top, middle and base notes may be delivered in any suitable proportion.
      <br/>
      As described herein above, those skilled in the art of preparing fragrance- containing compositions have categorized fragrances into three types based on their relative volatility; top, middle, and base notes.
      <br/>
      In addition, fragrances are categorized by the odor they produce; some of these descriptors are broad and others are relatively specific.
      <br/>
      For example, "floral" is a term which connotes odors associated with flowers while the term "lilac" is more specific.
      <br/>
      Descriptors used by those skilled in the art of perfiumes and fragrances are inter alia "rose", "floral", "green", "citrus", "spicy", "honey", and "musk".
      <br/>
      The sources of these notes are not limited to one chemical class; alcohols can produce "rose", "green", and "musk" scents, while "rose" scents can comprise alcohols, ketones, terpenes, aldehydes, etc.
    </p>
    <p num="66">
      Top, middle, and base notes each serve a different purpose in the blending of fragrances and when properly formulated produce a "balanced fragrance" composition.
      <br/>
      Based on volatility, these notes are described by those skilled in the art as: the base notes having the most long lasting aroma; the middle notes, have a medium volatility; and the top notes are the most volatile.
      <br/>
      The compositions described herein below, as well as others chosen by the formulator, comprise a fragrance delivery system which utilizes the pro-fragrances of the present invention to successfully deliver a "balanced fragrance" profile.
    </p>
    <p num="67">
      It is also recognized by those skilled in the art that descriptors which relate to aesthetic perceptions such as "top", "middle" and "base" notes are relative terms.
      <br/>
      A fragrance raw material categorized as a top note by one formulator usually has the identical classification among most other Perfiuners.
      <br/>
      The same is true for the middle and base notes, however, occasionally one formulator may classify a given fragrance raw material as a middle note rather than a top note, or vice versa, but this fact does not diminish the utility of a given compound or its absolute identity.
      <br/>
      Top, middle and base notes are now combined in a reproducible manner to produce perfumes, colognes, after-shave lotions, eau de toilettes, etc. for application to skin, which have unique and pleasant odor characteristics.
      <br/>
      Yet apart from this pleasant fragrance, a fragrance delivery system which is used to deliver a scent to a laundry detergent composition must meet a number of technical requirements.
      <br/>
      It must be sufficiently strong, it must be persistent, and it must retain its "essential character" throughout its period of evaporation and fragrance raw material release.
    </p>
    <p num="68">
      Aside from the changes made to the "pro-fragrance" molecules for the purpose of modifying the fragrance profiles which the fragrance delivery systems of the present invention provide, modifications can be made to these pro-fragrances for the purpose of increasing the substantivity of the materials.
      <br/>
      The formulator by selecting a suitable R1, R2, or R3 unit, or upon the selection of R4 R5, and R6, can influence the degree and rate at which the "pro-fragrance" is deposited upon fabric or other surface.
      <br/>
      Those skilled in the art of formulating detergent compositions will recognize that the terms "substantive" and "substantivity" refer to the propensity of a compound to adhere to, associate with, or deposit upon a surface, preferably the surface of fabric.
      <br/>
      Therefore, compounds which are more substantive more readily adhere to fabric surface.
      <br/>
      However, substantive compounds, in general, do not react with the surface onto which they deposit.
    </p>
    <p num="69">An example of a pro-fragrance which is modified to provide higher fabric substantivity is the 2,6-dimethyl-7-octen-2-yl 3-( BETA -naphthyl)-2-(methoxy-pentaethyleneoxy)-3-oxo-propionate, �dihydromyrcenyl (2-naphthoyl)(2-E5 methoxy)acetate�, having the formula:  (Chemical Structure image '25' not included in text)</p>

      Calcium ions are generally more effective than magnesium ions and are preferred herein if only one type of cation is being used.
      <br/>
      Typical detergent compositions, especially liquids, will comprise from about 1 to about 30, preferably from about 2 to about 20, more preferably from about 8 to about 12 millimoles of calcium ion per liter of finished detergent composition, though variation is possible depending on factors including the multiplicity, type and levels of enzymes incorporated.
      <br/>
      Preferably water-soluble calcium or magnesium salts are employed, including for example calcium chloride, calcium hydroxide, calcium formate, calcium malate, calcium maleate, calcium hydroxide and calcium acetate; more generally, calcium sulfate or magnesium salts corresponding to the exemplified calcium salts may be used.
      <br/>
      Further increased levels of Calcium and/or Magnesium may of course be useful, for example for promoting the grease-cutting action of certain types of surfactant.
    </p>
    <p num="127">
      Another stabilizing approach is by use of borate species.
      <br/>
      See Severson, U.S. Pat. No. 4,537,706. Borate stabilizers, when used, may be at levels of up to 10% or more of the composition though more typically, levels of up to about 3% by weight of boric acid or other borate compounds such as borax or orthoborate are suitable for liquid detergent use.
      <br/>
      Substituted boric acids such as phenylboronic acid, butaneboronic acid, p-bromophenylboronic acid or the like can be used in place of boric acid and reduced levels of total boron in detergent compositions may be possible though the use of such substituted boron derivatives.
    </p>
    <p num="128">
      Stabilizing systems of certain cleaning compositions may further comprise from 0 to about 10%, preferably from about 0.01% to about 6% by weight, of chlorine bleach scavengers, added to prevent chlorine bleach species present in many water supplies from attacking and inactivating the enzymes, especially under alkaline conditions.
      <br/>
      While chlorine levels in water may be small, typically in the range from about 0.5 ppm to about 1.75 ppm, the available chlorine in the total volume of water that comes in contact with the enzyme, for example during fabric- washing, can be relatively large; accordingly, enzyme stability to chlorine in-use is sometimes problematic.
      <br/>
      Since perborate or percarbonate, which have the ability to react with chlorine bleach, may present in certain of the instant compositions in amounts accounted for separately from the stabilizing system, the use of additional stabilizers against chlorine, may, most generally, not be essential, though improved results may be obtainable from their use.
      <br/>
      Suitable chlorine scavenger anions are widely known and readily available, and, if used, can be salts containing ammonium cations with sulfite, bisulfite, thiosulfite, thiosulfate, iodide, etc.
      <br/>
      Antioxidants such as carbamate, ascorbate, etc., organic amines such as ethylenediaminetetracetic acid (EDTA) or alkali metal salt thereof, monoethanolamine (MEA), and mixtures thereof can likewise be used.
      <br/>
      Likewise, special enzyme inhibition systems can be incorporated such that different enzymes have maximum compatibility.
      <br/>
      Other conventional scavengers such as bisulfate, nitrate, chloride, sources of hydrogen peroxide such as sodium perborate tetrahydrate, sodium perborate monohydrate and sodium percarbonate, as well as phosphate, condensed phosphate, acetate, benzoate, citrate, formate, lactate, malate, tartrate, salicylate, etc., and mixtures thereof can be used if desired.
      <br/>
      In general, since the chlorine scavenger function can be performed by ingredients separately listed under better recognized functions, (e.g., hydrogen peroxide sources), there is no absolute requirement to add a separate chlorine scavenger unless a compound performing that function to the desired extent is absent from an enzyme-containing embodiment of the invention; even then, the scavenger is added only for optimum results.
      <br/>
      Moreover, the formulator will exercise a chemist's normal skill in avoiding the use of any enzyme scavenger or stabilizer which is majorly incompatible, as formulated, with other reactive ingredients, if used.
      <br/>
      In relation to the use of ammonium salts, such salts can be simply admixed with the detergent composition but are prone to adsorb water and/or liberate ammonia during storage.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, such materials, if present, are desirably protected in a particle such as that described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,652,392, Baginski et al.

    <heading>ADJUNCT INGREDIENTS</heading>
    <p num="136">The following are non-limiting examples of adjunct ingredients useful in the liquid detergent compositions of the present invention, said adjunct ingredients include builders, optical brighteners, bleach boosters, bleach catalysts, bleach activators, soil release polymers, dye transfer agents, dispersents, enzymes, suds suppressers, dyes, perfiumes, colorants, filler salts, hydrotropes, enzymes, photoactivators, fluorescers, fabric conditioners, hydrolyzable surfactants, preservatives, anti-oxidants, chelants, stabilizers, anti-shrinkage agents, anti-wrinkle agents, germicides, fingicides, anti corrosion agents, and mixtures thereof.</p>
    <p num="137">
      Builders--Detergent builders can optionally be included in the compositions herein to assist in controlling mineral hardness.
      <br/>
      Inorganic as well as organic builders can be used.
      <br/>
      Builders are typically used in fabric laundering compositions to assist in the removal of particulate soils.
    </p>
    <p num="138">
      The level of builder can vary widely depending upon the end use of the composition and its desired physical form.
      <br/>
      When present, the compositions will typically comprise at least about 1% builder.
      <br/>
      Formulations typically comprise from about 5% to about 50%, more typically about 5% to about 30%, by weight, of detergent builder.
    </p>
    <p num="139">
      Inorganic or P-containing detergent builders include, but are not limited to, the alkali metal, amnmonium and alkanolammonium salts of polyphosphates (exemplified by the tripolyphosphates, pyrophosphates, and glassy polymeric meta-phosphates), phosphonates, phytic acid, silicates, carbonates (including bicarbonates and sesquicarbonates), sulphates, and aluminosilicates.
      <br/>
      For the purposes of the present invention, phosphate builders are one of the preferred builders.
      <br/>
      However, non-phosphate builders are required in some locales.
      <br/>
      Importantly, the compositions herein function surprisingly well even in the presence of the so-called "weak" builders (as compared with phosphates) such as citrate, or in the so-called "underbuilt" situation that may occur with zeolite or layered silicate builders.
    </p>
    <p num="140">
      Examples of silicate builders are the alkali metal silicates, particularly those having a SiO2 :Na2 O ratio in the range 1.6:1 to 3.2:1 and layered silicates, such as the layered sodium silicates described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,66.4,839, issued May 12, 1987 to H. P. Rieck. NaSKS-6 is the trademark for a crystalline layered silicate marketed by Hoechst (commonly abbreviated herein as "SKS-6").
      <br/>
      Unlike zeolite builders, the Na SKS-6 silicate builder does not contain aluminum.
      <br/>
      NaSKS-6 has the delta-Na2 SiO5 morphology form of layered silicate.
      <br/>
      It can be prepared by methods such as those described in German DE-A-3,417,649 and DE-A-3,742,043.
      <br/>
      SKS-6 is a highly preferred layered silicate for use herein, but other such layered silicates, such as those having the general formula NaMSix O2x+1 * yH2 O wherein M is sodium or hydrogen, x is a number from 1.9 to 4, preferably 2, and y is a number from 0 to 20, preferably 0 can be used herein.
      <br/>
      Various other layered silicates from Hoechst include NaSKS-5, NaSKS-7 and NaSKS- 11, as the alpha, beta and gamma forms.
      <br/>
      As noted above, the delta-Na2 SiO5 (NaSKS-6 form) is most preferred for use herein.
      <br/>
      Other silicates may also be useful such as for example magnesium silicate, which can serve as a stabilizing agent for oxygen bleaches, and as a component of suds control systems.
    </p>
    <p num="141">Examples of carbonate builders are the alkaline earth and alkali metal carbonates as disclosed in German Patent Application No. 2,321,001 published on Nov. 15, 1973.</p>
    <p num="142">
      Alumninosilicate builders are useful in the present invention.
      <br/>
      Aluminosilicate builders can also be a significant builder ingredient in the liquid detergent formulations of the present invention.
      <br/>
      Alumninosilicate builders include those having the empirical formula:
      <br/>
      �Mz (zAlO2 � * xH2 O
    </p>
    <p num="143">wherein z and y are integers of at least 6, the molar ratio of z to y is in the range from 1.0 to about 0.5, and x is an integer from about 15 to about 264.</p>
    <p num="144">
      Useful aluminosilicate ion exchange materials are commercially available.
      <br/>
      These aluminosilicates can be crystalline or amorphous in structure and can be naturally-occurring aluminosilicates or synthetically derived.
      <br/>
      A method for producing aluminosilicate ion exchange materials is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 3,985,669, Krummel, et al, issued Oct. 12, 1976. Preferred synthetic crystalline aluminosilicate ion exchange materials useful herein are available under the designations Zeolite A, Zeolite P (B), Zeolite MAP and Zeolite X. In an especially preferred embodiment, the crystalline aluminosilicate ion exchange material has the formula:
      <br/>
      Na12 �(AlO2)12 (SiO2)12 � * xH2 O
    </p>
    <p num="145">
      wherein x is from about 20 to about 30, especially about 27.
      <br/>
      This material is known as Zeolite A. Dehydrated zeolites (x=0-10) may also be used herein.
      <br/>
      Preferably, the aluminosilicate has a particle size of about 0.1-10 microns in diameter.
    </p>
    <p num="146">
      Organic detergent builders suitable for the purposes of the present invention include, but are not restricted to, a wide variety of polycarboxylate compounds.
      <br/>
      As used herein, "polycarboxylate" refers to compounds having a plurality of carboxylate groups, preferably at least 3 carboxylates.
      <br/>
      Polycarboxylate builder can generally be added to the composition in acid form, but can also be added in the form of a neutralized salt.
      <br/>
      When utilized in salt form, alkali metals, such as sodium, potassium, and lithium, or alkanolammonium salts are preferred.
    </p>
    <p num="147">
      Included among the polycarboxylate builders are a variety of categories of useful materials.
      <br/>
      One important category of polycarboxylate builders encompasses the ether polycarboxylates, including oxydisuccinate, as disclosed in Berg, U.S. Pat. No. 3,128,287, issued Apr. 7, 1964, and Lamberti et al, U.S. Pat. No. 3,635,830, issued Jan. 18, 1972. See also "TMS/TDS" builders of U.S. Pat. No. 4,663,071, issued to Bush et al, on May 5, 1987.
      <br/>
      Suitable ether polycarboxylates also include cyclic compounds, particularly alicyclic compounds, such as those described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,923,679; 3,835,163; 4,158,635; 4,120,874 and 4,102,903.
    </p>
    <p num="148">
      Other usefuil detergency builders include the ether hydroxypolycarboxylates, copolymers of maleic anhydride with ethylene or vinyl methyl ether, 1,3,5-trihydroxy benzene-2,4,6-trisulphonic acid, and carboxymethyloxysuccinic acid, the various alkali metal, ammonium and substituted ammonium salts of polyacetic acids such as ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid and nitrilotriacetic acid, as well as polycarboxylates such as mellitic acid, succinic acid, oxydisuccinic acid, polymaleic acid, benzene 1,3,5-tricarboxylic acid, carboxymethyloxysuccinic acid, and soluble salts thereof.
      <br/>
      Citrate builders, e.g., citric acid and soluble salts thereof (particularly sodium salt), are polycarboxylate builders of particular importance for heavy duty liquid detergent formulations due to their availability from renewable resources and their biodegradability.
    </p>
    <p num="149">
      Also suitable in the detergent compositions of the present invention are the 3,3-dicarboxy-4-oxa-1,6-hexanedioates and the related compounds disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,566,984, Bush, issued Jan. 28, 1986. Useful succinic acid builders include the C5 -C20 alkyl and alkenyl succinic acids and salts thereof A particularly preferred compound of this type is dodecenylsuccinic acid.
      <br/>
      Specific examples of succinate builders include: laurylsuccinate, myristylsuccinate, palmitylsuccinate, 2-dodecenylsuccinate (preferred), 2-pentadecenylsuccinate, and the like.
      <br/>
      Lauiylsuccinates are the preferred builders of this group, and are described in European Patent Application 86200690.5/0,200,263, published Nov. 5, 1986.
    </p>
    <p num="150">Other suitable polycarboxylates are disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,144,226, Crmtchfield et al, issued Mar. 13, 1979 and in U.S. Pat. No. 3,308,067, Diehl, issued Mar. 7, 1967. See also Diehl U.S. Pat. No. 3,723,322.</p>
    <p num="151">
      Fatty acids, e.g., C12 -C18 monocarboxylic acids, can also be incorporated into the compositions alone, or in combination with the aforesaid builders, especially citrate and/or the succinate builders, to provide additional builder activity.
      <br/>
      Such use of fatty acids will generally result in a diminution of sudsing, which should be taken into account by the formulator.
    </p>
    <p num="152">
      In situations where phosphorus-based builders can be used, and especially in the formulation of bars used for hand-laundering operations, the various alkali metal phosphates such as the well-known sodium tripolyphosphates, sodium pyrophosphate and sodium orthophosphate can be used.
      <br/>
      Phosphonate builders such as ethane-1-hydroxy-1,1-diphosphonate and other known phosphonates (see, for example, U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,159,581; 3,213,030; 3,422,021; 3,400,148 and 3,422,137) can also be used.
    </p>
    <p num="153">Soil Release Agents</p>
    <p num="154">
      SRA's suitable for the compositions of the present invention typically have hydrophilic segments to hydrophilize the surface of hydrophobic fibers such as polyester and nylon, and hydrophobic segments to deposit upon hydrophobic fibers and remain adhered thereto through completion of washing and rinsing cycles, thereby serving as an anchor for the hydrophilic segments.
      <br/>
      This can enable stains occurring subsequent to treatment with the SRA to be more easily cleaned in later washing procedures.
    </p>
    <p num="155">
      SRA's can include a variety of charged, e.g., anionic or even cationic species, see U.S. Pat. No. 4,956,447, issued Sep. 11, 1990 to Gosselink, et al., as well as noncharged monomer units, and their structures may be linear, branched or even star-shaped.
      <br/>
      They may include capping moieties which are especially effective in controlling molecular weight or altering the physical or surface-active properties.
      <br/>
      Structures and charge distributions may be tailored for application to different fiber or textile types and for varied detergent or detergent additive products.
    </p>
    <p num="156">
      SRA's include oligomeric terephthalate esters, typically prepared by processes involving at least one transesterification/oligomerization, often with a metal catalyst such as a titanium(IV) alkoxide.
      <br/>
      Such esters may be made using additional monomers capable of being incorporated into the ester structure through one, two, three, four or more positions, without, of course, forming a densely crosslinked overall structure.
    </p>
    <p num="157">
      Suitable SRA's include a sulfonated product of a substantially linear ester oligomer comprised of an oligomeric ester backbone of terephthaloyl and oxyalkyleneoxy repeat units and allyl-derived sulfonated terminal moieties covalently attached to the backbone, for example as described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,968,451, Nov. 6, 1990 to J. J. Scheibel and E. P. Gosselink. Such ester oligomers can be prepared by: (a) ethoxylating allyl alcohol; (b) reacting the product of (a) with dimethyl terephthalate ("DMT") and 1,2-propylene glycol ("PG") in a two-stage transesterification/oligomerization procedure; and (c) reacting the product of (b) with sodium metabisulfite in water.
      <br/>
      Other SRA's include the nonionic end-capped 1,2-propylene/polyoxyethylene terephthalate polyesters of U.S. Pat. No. 4,711,730, Dec. 8, 1987 to Gosselink et al., for example those produced by transesterification/-oligomerization of poly(ethyleneglycol) methyl ether, DMT, PG and poly(ethyleneglycol) ("PEG").
      <br/>
      Other examples of SRA's include: the partly- and fully- anionic-end-capped oligomeric esters of U.S. Pat. No. 4,721,580, Jan. 26, 1988 to Gosselink, such as oligomers from ethylene glycol ("EG"), PG, DMT and Na-3,6-dioxa-8-hydroxyoctanesulfonate; the nonionic-capped block polyester oligomeric compounds of U.S. Pat. No. 4,702,857, Oct. 27, 1987 to Gosselink, for example produced from DMT, methyl (Me)-capped PEG and EG and/or PG, or a combination of DMT, EG and/or PG, Me-capped PEG and Na-dimethyl-5-sulfoisophthalate; and the anionic, especially sulfoaroyl, end-capped terephthalate esters of U.S. Pat. No. 4,877,896, Oct. 31, 1989 to Maldonado, Gosselink et al., the latter being typical of SRA's useful in both liquid laundry and fabric conditioning products, an example being an ester composition made from m-sulfobenzoic acid monosodium salt, PG and DMT, optionally but preferably fuirther comprising added PEG, e.g., PEG 3400.
    </p>
    <p num="158">
      SRA's also include: simple copolymeric blocks of ethylene terephthalate or propylene terephthalate with polyethylene oxide or polypropylene oxide terephthalate, see U.S. Pat. No. 3,959,230 to Hays, May 25, 1976 and U.S. Pat. No. 3,893,929 to Basadur, Jul. 8, 1975; cellulosic derivatives such as the hydroxyether cellulosic polymers available as METHOCEL from Dow; the C1 -C4 alkyl celluloses and C4 hydroxyalkyl celluloses, see U.S. Pat. No. 4,000,093, Dec. 28, 1976 to Nicol, et al.; and the methyl cellulose ethers having an average degree of substitution (methyl) per anhydroglucose unit from about 1.6 to about 2.3 and a solution viscosity of from about 80 to about 120 centipoise measured at 20 (degree)  C. as a 2% aqueous solution.
      <br/>
      Such materials are available as METOLOSE SM100 and METOLOSE SM200, which are the trade names of methyl cellulose ethers manufactured by Shin-etsu Kagaku Kogyo KK.

    <p num="159">
      Suitable SRA's characterised by poly(vinyl ester) hydrophobe segments include graft copolymers of polyvinyl ester), e.g., C1 -C6 vinyl esters, preferably poly(vinyl acetate), grafted onto polyalkylene oxide backbones.
      <br/>
      See European Patent Application 0 219 048, published Apr. 22, 1987 by Kud, et al.
      <br/>
      Commercially available examples include SOKALAN SRA's such as SOKALAN HP-22, available from BASF, Germany.
      <br/>
      Other SRA's are polyesters with repeat units containing 10-15% by weight of ethylene terephthalate together with 80-90% by weight of polyoxyethylene terephthalate derived from a polyoxyethylene glycol of average molecular weight 300-5,000.
      <br/>
      Commercial examples include ZELCON 5126 from Dupont and MILEASE T from ICI.
    </p>
    <p num="160">
      Additional classes of SRA's include: (I) nonionic terephthalates using diisocyanate coupling agents to link polymeric ester structures, see U.S. Pat. No. 4,201,824, Violland et al. and U.S. Pat. No. 4,240,918 Lagasse et al.; and (II) SRA's with carboxylate terminal groups made by adding trimellitic anhydride to known SRA's to convert terminal hydroxyl groups to trimellitate esters.
      <br/>
      With the proper selection of catalyst, the trimellitic anhydride forms linkages to the terminals of the polymer through an ester of the isolated carboxylic acid of trimellitic anhydride rather than by opening of the anhydride linkage.
      <br/>
      Either nonionic or anionic SRA's may be used as starting materials as long as they have hydroxyl terminal groups which may be esterified.
      <br/>
      See U.S. Pat. No. 4,525,524 Tung et al.. Other classes include: (III) anionic terephthalate-based SRA's of the urethane-linked variety, see U.S. Pat. No. 4,201,824, Violland et al.; (IV) poly(vinyl caprolactam) and related co-polymers with monomers such as vinyl pyrrolidone and/or dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate, including both nonionic and cationic polymers, see U.S. Pat. No. 4,579,681, Ruppert et al.; (V) graft copolymers, in addition to the SOKALAN types from BASF, made by grafting acrylic monomers onto sulfonated polyesters.
      <br/>
      These SRA's assertedly have soil release and anti-redeposition activity similar to known cellulose ethers: see EP 279,134 A, 1988, to Rhone-Poulenc Chemie.
      <br/>
      Still other classes include: (VI) grafts of vinyl monomers such as acrylic acid and vinyl acetate onto proteins such as caseins, see EP 457,205 A to BASF (1991); and (VII) polyester-polyamide SRA's prepared by condensing adipic acid, caprolactam, and polyethylene glycol, especially for treating polyamide fabrics, see Bevan et al., DE 2,335,044 to Unilever N. V., 1974. Other useful SRA's are described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,240,918, 4,787,989 and 4,525,524.

      If high sudsing is desired, suds boosters such as the C10 -C16 alkanolamides can be incorporated into the compositions, typically at 1%-10% levels.
      <br/>
      The C10 -C14 monoethanol and diethanol amides illustrate a typical class of such suds boosters.
      <br/>
      Use of such suds boosters with high sudsing adjunct surfactants such as the amine oxides, betaines and sultaines noted above is also advantageous.
