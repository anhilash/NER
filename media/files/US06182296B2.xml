    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="1">
      1.
      <br/>
      Field of Invention
    </p>
    <p num="2">This invention relates to an approach for producing reversible clothing, including pants and jackets, and more particularly such a method and its resultant particular style of denim pants and jackets.</p>
    <p num="3">2. Description of Prior Art</p>
    <p num="4">
      Reversible clothing is known in the art.
      <br/>
      Reversible garments are designed such that the two surfaces of the garment have a different pattern, color, or texture.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the user is provided with two choices of pattern, color or fabric texture with each garment.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      Some types of reversible garments are constructed using two different types of fabrics.
      <br/>
      The two fabrics are sewn together such that a different fabric faces out when the garment is turned inside out and vice versa.
      <br/>
      The problem with this design is that the clothing is typically bulky and uncomfortable due to the two layer thickness of the garment fabric.
      <br/>
      In order to solve this problem, reversible garments were designed using two-sided, single thickness fabric.
      <br/>
      Because the fabric is only one layer in thickness, the garment is relatively thin and comfortable to wear, yet the garment is reversible.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      Reversible pants could also be used when one side of the pants has been permanently stained, but the reversible side has not been effected.
      <br/>
      Thus, the stain does not precipitate disposal of the pants.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      Reversible pants are traditionally designed using two different types of fabrics, sewn together so that a different fabric faces outward.
      <br/>
      However, this dual-fabric configuration can often be bulky and uncomfortable to wear.
      <br/>
      To solve this problem, the two fabrics may be made thinner.
      <br/>
      However, this creates the problem of reduces strength of each fabric, which increases the likelihood of tearing of either fabric.
    </p>
    <p num="8">Use of a single, thicker fabric reduces the bulk created by the dual fabric configurations, while simultaneously increases structural integrity of the pants.</p>
    <p num="9">Another problem commonly found in reversible pants concerns pocket and fastening means.</p>
    <p num="10">
      Any pockets used in the pants must be easily accessible when either side of the fabric is outward facing.
      <br/>
      Placing two pockets, one on either side, increases bulkiness, especially in dual fabric configurations.
      <br/>
      Further, buttons or zippers accessible from one side of the garment must be just as easily accessible when the pants are reversed.
      <br/>
      Also, pocket attachment must be achieved to reduces bunching of the pockets when not in use.
    </p>
    <p num="11">
      In the related art, several devices are disclosed that describe a reversible shirt/sweater with extended sleeves.
      <br/>
      These include U.S. Pat. No. 5,720,044, issued in the name of Robinson and U.S. Pat. No. 5,561,860, issued in the name of Nguyen-Senderowicz.

    <p num="12">U.S. Pat. No. 5,204,995 issued in the name of Knapp, discloses reversible pants.</p>
    <p num="13">U.S. Pat. No. 4,310,929, issued in the name of Finlay, describes reversible running shorts.</p>
    <p num="14">U.S. Pat. No. 4,481,683, issued in the name of Estruch, discloses reversible, uni-sex underwear.</p>
    <p num="15">U.S. Pat. No. 5,063,614, issued in the name of McSheffery, discloses a reversible, upper body garment having detachable pockets.</p>
