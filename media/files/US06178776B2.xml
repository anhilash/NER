    <heading>TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
    <p num="1">This invention relates generally to the production of pressurized oxygen gas and more particularly to the production of pressurized oxygen gas from low pressure oxygen gas.</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND ART</heading>
    <p num="2">
      The compression of gaseous oxygen to produce pressurized oxygen gas is very expensive when compared to the cost of compression of other atmospheric gases.
      <br/>
      The cost is higher in both power consumed and in initial capital cost of the compression equipment.
      <br/>
      This high cost is due to the reactive nature of gaseous oxygen.
      <br/>
      Mechanical tolerances are set much looser for an oxygen compressor than for a nitrogen or air compressor so as to reduce the risk of a rub within the machine that could cause a fire.
      <br/>
      These looser tolerances or high clearances result in significantly reduced compressor efficiencies, on the order of six to ten percent.
      <br/>
      This lower efficiency corresponds to a higher compressor power.
    </p>
    <p num="3">
      The problem of high cost in the production of pressurized oxygen gas is not acute when the oxygen is produced by the cryogenic separation of air because the oxygen can be recovered as high pressure gas directly from a column, or can be taken from a column as liquid, pressurized and then vaporized.
      <br/>
      However these expediencies are not available when the oxygen is produced by a non-cryogenic air separation method such as by vacuum pressure swing adsorption.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      Those skilled in the art have addressed this problem by making small, incremental improvements in oxygen compressors.
      <br/>
      Incremental improvements in centrifugal compressors have been achieved, but the gains have been modest.
      <br/>
      Positive displacement machines have been used in place of centrifugal compressors, and while they have a lower initial capital cost, the life cycle cost of such machines is higher due to increased power consumption and higher maintenance cost.
      <br/>
      In summary, improvements in such machines over the years has been only incremental, not a step change.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      In the operation of a non-cryogenic oxygen plant, such as a vacuum pressure swing adsorption plant, the cost of the oxygen compressor is a significant portion of both the total capital cost and the power usage of the plant.
      <br/>
      If a significant reduction in the cost of oxygen compression can be achieved, a substantial decrease in the total cost of a non-cryogenic oxygen production plant can be attained.
    </p>
    <p num="6">Accordingly it is an object of this invention to provide an improved system for the production of pressurized oxygen gas.</p>
    <p num="7">It is another object of this invention to provide a system for the production of pressurized oxygen gas from low pressure oxygen gas without the need for employing an oxygen compressor.</p>

      As used herein, the term "column" means a distillation or fractionation column or zone, i.e. a contacting column or zone, wherein liquid and vapor phases are countercurrently contacted to effect separation of a fluid mixture, as for example, by contacting of the vapor and liquid phases on a series of vertically spaced trays or plates mounted within the column and/or on packing elements such as structured or random packing.
      <br/>
      For a further discussion of distillation columns, see the Chemical Engineer's Handbook, fifth edition, edited by R. H. Perry and C. H. Chilton, McGraw-Hill Book Company, New York, Section 13, The Continuous Distillation Process.
    </p>
    <p num="14">
      Vapor and liquid contacting separation processes depend on the difference in vapor pressures for the components.
      <br/>
      The high vapor pressure (or more volatile or low boiling) component will tend to concentrate in the vapor phase whereas the low vapor pressure (or less volatile or high boiling) component will tend to concentrate in the liquid phase.
      <br/>
      Partial condensation is the separation process whereby cooling of a vapor mixture can be used to concentrate the volatile component(s) in the vapor phase and thereby the less volatile component(s) in the liquid phase.
      <br/>
      Rectification, or continuous distillation, is the separation process that combines successive partial vaporizations and condensations as obtained by a countercurrent treatment of the vapor and liquid phases.
      <br/>
      The countercurrent contacting of the vapor and liquid phases is generally adiabatic and can include integral (statewise) or differential (continuous) contact between the phases.
      <br/>
      Separation process arrangements that utilize the principles of rectification to separate mixtures are often interchangeably termed rectification columns, distillation columns, or fractionation columns.

      Cryogenic rectification is a rectification process carried out at least in part at temperatures at or below 150 degrees Kelvin (K).

      As used herein, the term "variable load refrigerant" means a multicomponent fluid, i.e. a mixture of two or more components, in proportions such that the liquid phase of those components undergoes a continuous and increasing temperature change between the bubble point and the dew point of the mixture.
      <br/>
      The bubble point of the mixture is the temperature, at a given pressure, wherein the mixture is all in the liquid phase but addition of heat will initiate formation of a vapor phase in equilibrium with the liquid phase.

      <br/>

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
    <p num="24">
      The invention will be described in detail with reference to the Drawings.
      <br/>
      Referring now to FIG. 1, low pressure oxygen gas 10, typically at a pressure within the range of from 14.7 to 25 pounds per square inch absolute (psia), is passed to the warm end of heat exchanger 60.
      <br/>
      In the embodiment illustrated in FIG. 1, heat exchanger 60 is shown as a unitary piece.
      <br/>
      It is understood however that the heat exchanger useful in the practice of this invention could comprise two or more discrete elements.
      <br/>
      Low pressure oxygen gas in stream 10 is typically the product output from an adsorption air separation system, such as a vacuum pressure swing adsorption system, and has an oxygen concentration generally within the range of from 85 to 95 mole percent with the remainder comprised primarily of argon.
      <br/>
      Low pressure oxygen gas 10 could also be product output from a low purity oxygen cryogenic air separation plant.
    </p>
    <p num="25">
      Low pressure oxygen gas in stream 10 is first cooled and then condensed in heat exchanger 60 by indirect heat exchange as will be more fully discussed below.
      <br/>
      Resulting low pressure oxygen liquid exits the cold end of heat exchanger 60 as stream 11 and at least a portion 13 of stream 11 is passed to liquid pump 14 wherein its pressure is raised, generally to be within the range of from 100 to 1000 psia, more typically within the range of from 100 to 250 psia.
      <br/>
      If desired, a portion 18 of the resulting pressurized oxygen liquid from liquid pump 14 may be recovered as oxygen liquid which is typically passed to storage.
      <br/>
      The remainder 16 of the pressurized oxygen liquid is passed to the cold end of heat exchanger 60.
      <br/>
      Within heat exchanger 60 the pressurized oxygen liquid is vaporized by indirect heat exchange as will be more fully described below, resulting in the production of pressurized oxygen gas which is withdrawn from the warm end of heat exchanger 60 in stream 17 and recovered at a pressure generally within the range of from 100 to 1000 psia, more typically within the range of from 100 to 250 psia.
    </p>
    <p num="26">
      While the heat duty of condensing stream 10 and vaporizing stream 16 is about the same, the temperature levels at which stream 10 condenses and stream 16 boils are different.
      <br/>
      Due to the lower pressure of stream 10, the condensing temperature of stream 10 is significantly lower than the boiling temperature of stream 16.
      <br/>
      In order to be able to condense stream 10 there must be a liquid stream that boils at a slightly lower temperature than stream 10, and in order to be able to vaporize stream 16 there must be a vapor stream that condenses at a slightly higher temperature than stream 16.
      <br/>
      Both of these functions are provided by one fluid, a defined multicomponent refrigerant fluid, which provides both the boiling and the condensing streams at the required temperatures.
    </p>
    <p num="27">
      Higher pressure multicomponent refrigerant fluid in stream 30 is passed to the warm end of heat exchanger 60 at a pressure and having a composition such that the dew point of stream 30 is a few degrees higher than the bubble point of the pressurized oxygen liquid in stream 16.
      <br/>
      This allows the pressurized oxygen liquid in stream 16 to boil or vaporize by indirect heat exchange with the compressed multicomponent refrigerant fluid in stream 30.
      <br/>
      The resulting condensed higher pressure multicomponent refrigerant fluid is withdrawn from the cold end of heat exchanger 60 in stream 31 and is flashed to a lower pressure by passage through valve 32 to form stream 33 which is mostly liquid.
      <br/>
      The pressure of stream 33 is set such that its bubble point is slightly colder than the dew point of the low pressure oxygen gas in stream 10.
      <br/>
      This allows the multicomponent refrigerant fluid in stream 33 to boil or vaporize at the correct temperature to allow the low pressure oxygen gas in stream 10 to condense to form stream 11.
      <br/>
      Resulting vaporized multicomponent refrigerant fluid is withdrawn from the warm end of heat exchanger 60 in stream 34 and passed to compressor 35 wherein it is compressed to a level to achieve the afore described pressure requirements.
      <br/>
      The resulting higher pressure multicomponent refrigerant fluid 36 is cooled of the heat of compression by passage through cooler 37 to form the aforesaid higher pressure multicomponent refrigerant fluid 30 and the cycle starts anew.
    </p>
    <p num="28">
      Table 1 presents one illustrative example of the invention in accord with an embodiment such as is illustrated in FIG. 1 but without the use of a downstream cryogenic rectification column.
      <br/>
      That is, all of stream 11 is passed to the liquid pump and there are no other fluids passing through heat exchanger 60 other than those recited in Table 1.
      <br/>
      In Table 1 the stream numbers correspond to those of FIG. 1 and the compositions are in mole percent.

      As mentioned, FIG. 1 illustrates a particularly preferred embodiment of the invention.
      <br/>
      Since one element of the invention involves the liquification of oxygen gas, a portion of such oxygen liquid may be conveniently processed in a cryogenic rectification column to produce high purity oxygen, i.e. a fluid having an oxygen concentration which exceeds that of the low pressure oxygen gas provided into the system.
    </p>
    <p num="43">
      Referring back now to FIG. 1, a portion 12 of oxygen liquid stream 11 is passed into cryogenic rectification column 61 which is operating at a pressure generally within the range of from 14.7 to 25 psia.
      <br/>
      Within column 61 the oxygen liquid provided into that column is separated by cryogenic rectification into high purity oxygen and into waste fluid.
      <br/>
      Some of the waste fluid is condensed in top condenser 63 to form column reflux.
      <br/>
      Another portion of the waste fluid is withdrawn from the upper portion of column 61 in vapor stream 50, warmed by passage through heat exchanger 60 and removed from the system in stream 51.
      <br/>
      Some of the high purity oxygen is boiled in bottom reboiler 62 to form column upflow vapor.
      <br/>
      Another portion of the high purity oxygen is withdrawn from the lower portion of the column 61 in stream 20 and pumped to a higher pressure in liquid pump 21 to form high pressure stream 22.
      <br/>
      If desired, a portion 25 of stream 22 may be recovered as high purity oxygen liquid.
      <br/>
      The remaining high pressure high purity oxygen liquid 23 is vaporized by passage through heat exchanger 60 and recovered as high purity oxygen gas.
      <br/>
      Typically the high purity oxygen fluid has an oxygen concentration of at least 99.5 mole percent.
    </p>
    <p num="44">
      Cryogenic rectification column 61 is driven by a heat pump circuit which includes top condenser 63 and bottom reboiler 62 and which uses a recirculating heat pump fluid which may be a pure component such as nitrogen or may be multicomponent refrigerant fluid such as those which are useful in the oxygen compression circuit described above.
      <br/>
      Compressed stream 48 is cooled of the heat of compression by passage through heat exchanger 60 to form stream 41.
      <br/>
      The pressure of stream 40 is set such that the dew point temperature of stream 40 is slightly higher than the bubble point temperature of the liquid at the bottom of column 61.
      <br/>
      This allows stream 41 to condense in reboiler 62 while providing the heat duty required for boil up in the column.
      <br/>
      Condensed stream 42 is then reduced in pressure through throttle valve 43 to form stream 44, with the pressure of stream 44 set such that the bubble point of stream 44 is slightly lower than the dew point of the overhead products of column 61.
      <br/>
      Vapor stream 45 is then warmed in heat exchanger 60 and resulting stream 46 is passed to compressor 47 for compression to the pressure required by stream 40.
    </p>
    <p num="45">
      FIG. 2 illustrates another particularly preferred embodiment of the invention, which is similar to the embodiment illustrated in FIG. 1 except that the multicomponent refrigerant fluid which is used to produce the pressurized oxygen gas is also used as the heat pump fluid to drive the cryogenic rectification column.
      <br/>
      The numerals of FIG. 2 are the same as those of FIG. 1 for the common elements, and these common elements will not be described again in detail.
    </p>
    <p num="46">
      Referring now to FIG. 2, multicomponent refrigerant fluid 30 is mostly condensed in heat exchanger 30 and resulting stream 31 is passed to bottom reboiler 62 wherein the uncondensed portion of stream 31 is condensed to provide the heat duty needed for column 61 boil up.
      <br/>
      Resulting liquid multicomponent fluid in stream 52 is throttled through valve 53 and then passed as stream 54 to top condenser 63 wherein a portion of stream 54 is vaporized to provide the heat duty needed to generate reflux for column 61.
      <br/>
      The resulting mostly liquid, low pressure multicomponent fluid in stream 55 is then passed to heat exchanger 60 wherein it is vaporized to carry out the condensation of low pressure oxygen gas.
      <br/>
      The resulting vaporized multicomponent refrigerant fluid in stream 34 is passed to compressor 35 and processed as previously described.
    </p>
    <p num="47">
      Now by the use of this invention, one can effectively and efficiently produce pressurized oxygen gas from low pressure oxygen gas without the need for compressing the oxygen gas.
