    <heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">This invention relates to new hot melt construction adhesives for the manufacture of disposable consumer articles, such as diapers, feminine sanitary napkins, adult incontinent products, medical gowns, and the like.</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="3">
      The development of hot melt construction adhesives for disposable consumer articles has paralleled the increasing complexity of the articles themselves.
      <br/>
      The increasing complexity of disposable articles requires hot melt construction adhesives to bond to a wider range of substrates such as various nonwoven materials and low surface energy polyolefins such as untreated polypropylene.
      <br/>
      The use of thinner polyolefin back sheets in the manufacture of disposable articles requires the use of lower viscosity hot melts in order to prevent burn-through and distortion when the adhesive is applied.
      <br/>
      Highly creep resistant bonds are required to hold elastic attachments in place, for example, elastic attachments made from natural rubber, polyurethane, and various types of foam.
      <br/>
      In addition, restrictions on low odor and light color of the hot melts are needed to meet consumer expectations.
    </p>
    <p num="4">Hot melt construction adhesives for disposable articles are known, including ethylene-vinyl acetate (EVA) copolymer-based hot melts, amorphous polypropylene-alpha-olefin (APAO)-based hot melts, styrene-butadiene-styrene (SBS) A-B-A-B-A multi-block copolymer-based hot melts, styrene-butadiene-styrene (SB)n radial copolymer-based hot melts, and styrene-isoprene-styrene (SIS) A-B-A block copolymer-based hot melts.</p>
    <p num="5">EVA copolymer-based hot melts such as those disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,299,475 suffer from poor adhesion to polyolefins and require large add-ons to obtain sufficient bond strengths.</p>
    <p num="6">APAO-based hot melts such as those disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,460,728 lack specific adhesion to polyolefins and exhibit poor creep resistance and poor machinability.</p>
    <p num="7">
      SBS multi-block copolymer-based hot melts such as those disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,526,577 possess poor specific adhesion to foam elastic attachments used in leg gathers and waist bands on diapers and adult incontinent articles and inferior creep resistance (particularly noticeable at low temperatures which articles are commonly exposed to during shipment and storage).
      <br/>
      Furthermore, SBS multi-block copolymer-based hot melts exhibit thermal stability problems; i.e., when they are subjected to heating during the article manufacturing process, these hot melts have a tendency to gel and plug the application equipment.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      Hot melt construction adhesives based on styrene-butadiene-styrene (SB)n radial copolymers such as those disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,944,933, 5,024,667, 5,037,411 and 5,057,571 suffer from poor machining and adhesion limitations which result in inferior bonds to polyolefin substrates.
      <br/>
      In addition, these formulations are highly over-tackified to provide necessary creep resistance, which in turn renders the adhesives very stiff at low temperatures and thus yields inferior bond strengths at those low temperatures.
      <br/>
      Radial polymers, while inherently stronger than multi-block copolymers, do not exhibit desirable adhesion characteristics, mainly due to the positioning of the styrene domains.
      <br/>
      Multi-block copolymers have more mid-block ends extending away from the styrene domains.
      <br/>
      Since the mid block dictates the adhesive properties of these hot melts, polymers possessing more mid-block ends tend to exhibit better adhesion characteristics.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      Hot melt construction adhesives based on styrene-isoprene-styrene A-B-A block copolymers such as those disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,149,741 possessing high amounts of styrene, without styrene endblock modifying resins, suffer from a loss of creep and heat resistance upon long exposure to high temperatures.
      <br/>
      SIS copolymers undergo chain scission reactions which form large amounts of styrene-isoprene (SI) diblocks.
      <br/>
      This causes a loss in mechanical properties which manifests itself in dramatic decreases in viscosity, lower heat resistance, lower shear adhesion failure temperature, and lower creep resistance as indicated by a shorter time to failure during static shear at both room temperature and elevated temperature.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, these compositions are highly over-tackified, thus deleteriously impacting their low temperature adhesion.
    </p>
    <p num="10">Non-pressure sensitive hot melt adhesives based on A-B-A styrene-butadiene-styrene copolymers, A-B-A-B-A styrene-butadiene-styrene copolymers, and their hydrogenated counterparts (styrene content 15 to 60%) such as those disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,275,589 are specifically designed to bond to the outer nonwoven layer of three ply diaper construction and are high viscosity oil-less formulations.</p>
    <p num="11">Sprayable hot melt adhesives based on blends of styrenic block copolymers (12 to 45% styrene by weight), tackifying resins, and ethylene copolymers such as ethylene-methacrylate copolymers such as those disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,401,792 are well known in the industry to be highly unstable systems, which can cause equipment problems due to gelation upon overexposure to high temperature.</p>
    <p num="12">
      Pressure sensitive, low tack hot melt adhesive compositions containing styrene-butadiene radial block copolymers, styrene-isoprene radial block copolymers and/or styrene-isoprene linear block copolymers, and plasticizing oils, such as those disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,523,343, exhibit a good balance of properties normally required.
      <br/>
      However, these hot melt adhesive compositions possess very low tack values (i.e., peel adhesion and quick stick) and are very high in viscosity.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, they are not viable adhesives for disposable article construction applications which require high tack valves and low viscosities at 140 (degree)  C., i.e., &lt;25,000 mPa * s.

    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="13">It is an object of the present invention to provide a hot melt construction adhesive for disposable consumer articles which exhibits low viscosity.</p>
    <p num="14">It is a further object of the present invention to provide a hot melt construction adhesive for disposable consumer articles which exhibits improved creep resistance, improved high temperature resistance, improved thermal stability, and improved adhesion to polyolefins such as high-density polyethylene both at elevated and at low temperatures.</p>
    <p num="15">
      These and further objects of the invention are obtained by a hot melt construction adhesive composition which comprises a blend of a styrene-butadiene (SB) block copolymer containing greater than about 25 weight percent styrene and a styrene-isoprene (SI) block copolymer containing greater than about 25 weight percent styrene, said hot melt construction adhesive composition possessing a viscosity of no greater than about 25,000 mPa * s at about 140 (degree)  C., a shear adhesion failure temperature (SAFT) of at least about 60 (degree)  C. and a static shear time to failure of no less than about 25 hours at about 23 (degree)  C., i.e., at room temperature.
      <br/>
      The hot melt construction adhesive of this invention further comprises tackifying resin(s) and plasticizing oil(s) and optionally can further comprise stabilizer(s) and wax component(s).
    </p>
    <p num="16">All quantities disclosed herein, except in the examples are to be understood to be modified by the term "about".</p>
    <heading>DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
    <p num="17">
      The hot melt construction adhesive of the invention contains, as its primary component, a blend of a styrene-butadiene block copolymer containing at least about 25 weight percent styrene and a styrene-isoprene block copolymer containing at least about 25 weight percent styrene.
      <br/>
      The styrene-butadiene block copolymer can broadly represent from about 5 to about 20, preferably from about 8 to about 16, weight percent of the hot melt adhesive of this invention.
      <br/>
      The styrene-isoprene block copolymer can broadly represent from about 5 to about 20, preferably from about 8 to about 16, weight percent of the hot melt adhesive of this invention.
      <br/>
      The styrene-butadiene and styrene-isoprene block copolymers can be linear copolymers corresponding to the general configuration A-B-A or A-B-A-B-A or radial copolymers corresponding to the general configuration (AB-)n wherein the polymer blocks A are non-elastomeric styrene-containing polymer blocks, and the polymer blocks B are elastomeric butadiene-containing or isoprene-containing polymer blocks.
      <br/>
      The use of linear styrene-butadiene block copolymers is particularly preferred for use herein.
      <br/>
      The styrene-butadiene block copolymer and styrene-isoprene block copolymer are individually comprised of at least about 25 weight percent, preferably from about 25 to about 50, and more preferably from about 35 to about 45, weight percent styrene.
      <br/>
      The styrene-butadiene block copolymer and the styrene-isoprene block copolymer each individually possess a melt flow index of from about 3 to about 50, preferably from about 8 to about 40 (as determined by ASTM-D 1238-95).
      <br/>
      The ratio of butadiene-isoprene block copolymer to styrene-isoprene block copolymer employed to produce the physical blend can broadly range from about 1:3 to about 3:1 parts by weight and preferably is about 1:1.
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      Typical styrene-butadiene copolymers which can be advantageously employed in the present invention include the linear A-B-A triblock styrene-butadiene copolymers sold under the tradenames Kraton D-1102 by Shell-Chemical or SolT166 by Enichem, the linear A-B-A-B-A multiblock styrene-butadiene block copolymers sold under the tradenames Stereon 840A by Firestone or Vector D-4461 by Dexco and the radial (AB-)n styrene butadiene copolymers sold under the tradename Kraton D-1122X by Shell Chemical or SolT168 by Enichem.
      <br/>
      Typical styrene-isoprene copolymers which can advantageously be employed herein are the styrene-isoprene copolymers sold under the tradenames Vector 4411D by Dexco or SolT193A, SolT193B and SolTE-9308 by Enichem.
      <br/>
      In addition to high styrene content, the di-block content of the styrene-isoprene copolymers is advantageously maintained below 25 weight percent, more preferably below 10 weight percent and most preferably 0 weight percent due to their poor thermal stability (which leads to di-block formation and a loss of creep and heat resistance).
    </p>
    <p num="19">Most preferred for use herein are blends of the linear A-B-A-B-A multiblock styrene-butadiene block copolymer sold by Firestone under the tradename Stereon 840A and the linear A-B-A triblock styrene-isoprene copolymer having di-block content of 0 weight percent sold by Dexco under the tradename Vector 4411D.</p>
    <p num="20">
      The tackifying resin(s) which are employed in the hot melt construction adhesives of the present invention are those which extend the adhesive properties and improve specific adhesion characteristics of the adhesives.
      <br/>
      As used herein, the term "tackifying resin" includes, but is not limited to, natural and modified rosins such as gum rosin, wood rosin, tall-oil rosin, distilled rosin, hydrogenated rosin, dimerized rosin and polymerized rosin; glycerol and pentaerythritol esters of natural and modified rosins, such as the glycerol esters of pale wood rosin, hydrogenated rosin, polymerized rosin and the pentaerythritol ester of pale wood rosin, hydrogenated rosin, tall oil rosin and the phenolic-modified pentaerythritol ester of rosin; polyterpene resins having a softening point, as determined by ASTM method E28-58T, of from about 60 (degree)  C. to about 140 (degree)  C., the latter polyterpene resins generally resulting from the polymerization of terpene hydrocarbons, such as the mono-terpene known as pinene, in the presence of Friedel-Crafts catalysts at moderately low temperatures; also included are the hydrogenated polyterpene resins; copolymers and terpolymers of natural terpenes, e.g., styrene/terpene,  ALPHA -methyl styrene/terpene and vinyl toluene/terpene; phenolic-modified terpene resins such as, for example, the resin product resulting from the condensation, in an acidic medium, of a terpene and a phenol; aliphatic petroleum hydrocarbon resins having Ball and Ring softening points of from about 60 (degree)  to 140 (degree)  C., the latter resins resulting from the polymerization of monomers consisting primarily of olefins and diolefins; also included are the hydrogenated aliphatic petroleum hydrocarbon resins; aromatic petroleum hydrocarbons and the hydrogenated derivatives thereof, aliphatic-/aromatic petroleum derived hydrocarbons and the hydrogenated derivatives thereof.
      <br/>
      Mixtures of two or more of the above described tackifying resins can be employed where desired.
      <br/>
      Tackifying resins can broadly represent from about 40 to about 65 parts by weight of the hot melt adhesive of this invention and preferably represent from about 50 to 60 parts by weight of the hot melt adhesive of this invention.
    </p>
    <p num="21">
      The preferred tackifying resins for the present invention are aliphatic/aromatic petroleum derived hydrocarbon resins having softening points from about 60 (degree)  C. to about 130 (degree)  C. Commercially available resins of this type are supplied by Exxon under the tradename Escorez 5600 and by Hercules under the tradename Regalite V1100.
      <br/>
      These resins offer excellent compatibility with blends of styrene-isoprene and styrene-butadiene block copolymers without the need of co-tackifying resins.
      <br/>
      Their light color and low odor make them ideal for consumer article construction applications.
      <br/>
      These resins have softening points from about 90 (degree)  C. to about 110 (degree)  C.
    </p>
    <p num="22">
      The plasticizer(s) which are utilized in the hot melt adhesive of the present invention provide viscosity control and wetting and specific adhesion to bonded substrates.
      <br/>
      These plasticizers are selected from a group consisting of naphthenic oil, phthalate and adipate esters, oligomers of polypropylene, polybutenes, polyisoprene, hydrogenated polyisoprene and polybutadiene, benzoate esters, and vegetable and animal oils and derivatives thereof and mixtures of two or more of any of the foregoing.
      <br/>
      The preferred primary plasticizer is a paraffinic oil, a commercial grade widely used is available from Witco under the tradename Kaydol oil.
      <br/>
      Plasticizers can broadly represent from about 10 to about 30 parts by weight of the hot melt adhesive of this invention and preferably represent from about 15 to about 25 parts by weight of the hot melt adhesive of this invention.
    </p>
    <p num="23">
      Wax component(s) can be optionally utilized in the present invention.
      <br/>
      Wax components are useful for multi-purpose hot melt adhesives, in that these components offer additional wetting and added creep resistance for foamed elastic attachments.
      <br/>
      These wax additives can be selected from a group comprised of paraffin wax, microcrystalline wax, Fischer-Tropsch wax, polyethylene wax, ethylene vinyl acetate wax, oxidized polyethylene wax, hydrogenated castor oil and derivatives thereof, polypropylene wax and mixtures of two or more of any of the foregoing.
      <br/>
      The preferred waxes for the present invention are selected from a group of oxidized polyethylene waxes, of which a commercial grade is available from Allied Signal under the tradename AC-395.
      <br/>
      Wax component(s) can represent from 0 to about 10 parts by weight of the hot melt adhesive of this invention and preferably represent from about 3 to about 7 parts by weight of the hot melt adhesive of this invention.
    </p>
    <p num="24">
      Stabilizers can be optionally utilized in the present invention, such as high molecular weight hindered phenols and multifunctional phenols.
      <br/>
      Hindered phenols are well known to those skilled in the art to be effective primary stabilizers for both styrene-isoprene block copolymers and styrene-butadiene block copolymers.
      <br/>
      Typical commercially available stabilizers of these types are supplied by Ciba-Geigy under the tradenames Irganox 1010 and Irganox 1076.
      <br/>
      Useful secondary stabilizers include phosphites, such as tris-(p-nonylphenyl)-phosphite (TNPP) and bis(2,4-di-tert-butylphenyl)4,4'-diphenylene-diphosphonite and di-stearyl-3,3'-thiodipropionate (DSTDP).
      <br/>
      Stabilizer(s) can represent from 0 to about 2.0, preferably from about 0.25 to about 2.0, parts by weight of the hot melt adhesive of this invention.
    </p>
    <p num="25">
      The hot melt adhesive composition of this invention is prepared by mixing the components in a heated tank under vacuum at a temperature of from about 120 (degree)  C. to about 190 (degree)  C. until a homogeneous blend is obtained.
      <br/>
      A minimal amount of thermal and mechanical energy should be employed to manufacture the adhesive.
      <br/>
      The determination of such amounts are well within the purview of one skilled in the art.
      <br/>
      This step usually requires two to three hours.
      <br/>
      The vacuum is then broken with nitrogen or carbon dioxide gas to prevent air entrapment in the adhesive.
      <br/>
      The finished adhesive is then packed and cooled quickly for shipment to the manufacturer of the disposable articles.
    </p>
    <p num="26">
      The disposable article manufacturer then re-melts the hot melt adhesive for use as the construction adhesives of said articles.
      <br/>
      The application of the hot melt construction adhesives may be accomplished by several applications systems depending on the type of article being made and the substrates involved.
      <br/>
      These application systems may involve spiral spray techniques, multi-line extrusion, multi-dot extrusion, and melt blown deposition.
      <br/>
      The adhesives produced by the teachings of the present invention can be applied by any of the aforementioned techniques in the manufacture of consumer articles, and wherein the adhesive is bonding a polyolefin or nonwoven substrate to at least one elastic, polyolefin, foam, or nonwoven substrate.
    </p>
    <p num="27">This invention can be further illustrated by the following examples of the preferred embodiments thereof, although it will be understood that these examples are included only for illustration and comparison to the existing art, and are not intended to limit the scope of the invention unless specifically indicated.</p>
    <p num="28">EXAMPLES 1-3</p>
    <p num="29">
      Hot melt adhesive compositions in accordance with the teachings of the present invention (Examples 1-3) were prepared by blending styrene-butadiene and styrene-isoprene block copolymers, plasticizer (Kaydol Oil available from Witco) and stabilizer (Irganox 1010 available from Ciba-Geigy) in a heated vessel at 177 (degree)  C. under high shear from a marine type prop mixer.
      <br/>
      Once this blend was homogeneous, the tackifying resin (Escorez 5600 available from Exxon) was added slowly until a uniform mixture was obtained.
      <br/>
      The resulting adhesive was tested for viscosity, (RBSP), and then coated 25 microns thick on a 50 micron PET film using an Acumeter slot-die coater at 140 (degree)  C. The resulting 25-micron films of adhesive were then tested for comparison to Comparative Examples 1-4.

    <p num="110">
      The apparatus shall be a dead-weight piston plastometer consisting of a thermostatically controlled heated steel cylinder with a die at the lower end and a weighted piston operating within the cylinder.
      <br/>
      Detailed description of individual components can be found in ASTM-D 1238-95.
    </p>
    <p num="111">Procedure:</p>
    <p num="112">
      Manual operation with condition 190/5.
      <br/>
      1) Check die bore diameter with appropriately sized go/no-go gages prior to testing.
      <br/>
      Die should be tested at 25 +- 5 (degree)  C.
      <br/>
      2) Allow the apparatus, including die and piston to equilibrate at 190.+- 0 (slashed zero) 2 (degree)  C. for 15 minutes prior to testing.
      <br/>
      3) Remove the piston and place it on an insulated surface.
      <br/>
      Charge the cylinder within 1 minute with a weighted portion of the sample according to the expected flow rate, as given in Table 1.
      <br/>
      4) Replace the piston and allow time for the material to begin to melt.
      <br/>
      Normally about 5 to 6 minutes.
      <br/>
      5) Add 5 Kg weight to piston and purge air along with some material until piston start marks are still 1.5 to 2 cm from top of cylinder.
      <br/>
      Then allow time for piston to fall naturally to the start marks.
      <br/>
      6) Start collecting a timed extrudate when the piston start mark reaches the top of the cylinder as long as the total time from the end of the charging step has not exceeded 7 minutes.
      <br/>
      7) Simultaneously start the interval timer, (time set according to Table 1,) and make the initial cut-off when the start mark reaches the cylinder.
      <br/>
      8) Make the final cut-off when the time interval is reached.
      <br/>
      Check the extrudate for air bubbles and discard if any are found.
      <br/>
      9) Purge the remainder of the material and clean the apparatus.
      <br/>
      10) Upon cooling, weight the extrudate to the nearest 1 mg.
      <br/>
      11) Multiply the weight by the appropriate factor from Table 1 to obtain the flow rate in grams per 10 minutes.
      <br/>
      12) Repeat steps 2 through 11) for at least three good readings.

      The above results clearly demonstrate the superiority of Examples 1-3, versus the Comparative Examples 1-4.
      <br/>
      Important properties such as SAFT are significantly higher with the adhesives made by the teachings of this invention.
      <br/>
      SAFT is an important test for determining storage of adhesive bonds under a static load under elevated temperatures, such as those encountered during the shipment of finished disposable articles.
      <br/>
      The examples of this invention possess superior high temperature properties (as evidenced by the SAFT and static shear results) and superior adhesion to HDPE at 4 (degree)  C. The static shear properties are especially greater for Example 1 versus any of Comparative Examples 1-4.
      <br/>
      Even Example 3, which was formulated to be lower in viscosity compared to Examples 1-2, has comparable properties versus the comparative examples.
      <br/>
      Lower viscosity hot melts are beneficial for bonding thinner polyolefin films to nonwovens for the manufacture of disposable articles, without distortion of the substrates.
    </p>
    <p num="125">
      Concerning property retention after exposure to elevated temperatures, the adhesives of this invention overcome the limitations of both styrene-isoprene and styrene-butadiene copolymers by blending them.
      <br/>
      This blend provides a more stable adhesive versus an adhesive formulated with either copolymer alone.
      <br/>
      Styrene-isoprene copolymer-based adhesives undergo chain scission, which lowers the molecular weight of the copolymer and weakens the adhesive, resulting in lower heat and shear resistance.
      <br/>
      Adhesives formulated with styrene-butadiene copolymers undergo chain extensions during exposure to elevated temperature which leads to the gelation of the adhesive that can plug application equipment.
