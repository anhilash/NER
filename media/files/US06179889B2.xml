    <heading>TECHNICAL FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="1">The present invention relates in general to vacuum cleaners and in particular to a vacuum cleaner assembly for securely housing a filter bag inside a receptacle or tank.</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">
      Vacuum cleaners often include a disposable filter bag.
      <br/>
      The filter bag collects particulate matter from air passing through the filter bag for subsequent disposal.
      <br/>
      Typically, the filter bag is removably mounted in a tank or other receptacle associated with the vacuum cleaner.
      <br/>
      When the filter bag is full, it is removed and an empty filter bag is installed in the tank.
    </p>
    <p num="3">
      Most filter bags include a cardboard plate with an aperture aligned to an opening in the filter bag.
      <br/>
      To install an empty filter bag in the vacuum cleaner tank, in such a way as to prevent unwanted movement of the filter bag, the aperture in the cardboard plate is pushed on to a filter bag mount.
      <br/>
      The filter bag mount is connected to the vacuum cleaner tank and to a hose.
      <br/>
      The combination usually remains in place due to friction or an interference fit.
      <br/>
      An aperture in the filter bag mount allows dirty air to pass from the hose to the filter bag where the dirt is collected.
      <br/>
      In order to reduce the amount of dirty air that escapes (i.e., air which fails to pass through the filter bag), and to help maintain the position of the filter bag, the filter bag mount may include a raised flange or other seal.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      Prior art systems allow an individual to replace the filter bag in such a way as to reduce movement and dirty air escape, however, these prior art systems suffer from certain drawbacks.
      <br/>
      The filter bag mount with raised flange requires the user to force and/or bend the cardboard plate into position.
      <br/>
      As a result, user's often find it difficult to install a new filter bag.
      <br/>
      Further, damage may occur to the cardboard plate, thereby increasing the amount of dirty air that escapes or possibly resulting in the cardboard plate and bag becoming entirely dislodged.
    </p>

    </p>
    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
    <p num="12">
      Vacuum cleaners typically comprise a motor assembly, a tank or other receptacle, a lid, a motor assembly, a hose inlet on the receptacle, and a hose that attaches to the hose inlet at one end and has a nozzle at the other end.
      <br/>
      The lid has a rim which is designed to fit over the edge of the receptacle of the vacuum cleaner.
      <br/>
      Around the periphery of the lid are several latch ports which cooperate with latches on the receptacle in order to hold the lid on the receptacle.
      <br/>
      The lid houses a motor assembly that is in air flow communication with the receptacle through a filter.
      <br/>
      Generally, the motor assembly includes an electric motor, a power cord for use with an electrical outlet, an air impeller, various housings, and other associated equipment.
      <br/>
      The motor of the motor assembly drives an impeller that creates a low pressure area inside the receptacle.
      <br/>
      The pressure difference between the inside and the outside of the receptacle creates a suction effect at the hose inlet, which causes dust, debris, and liquids to enter the receptacle through the hose.
    </p>
    <p num="13">
      Referring to FIG. 1 and FIG. 2, a vacuum cleaner tank or receptacle 10 (FIG. 1) is used to house a filter bag 12 (FIG. 2).
      <br/>
      The filter bag 12 includes an aperture 14 surrounded by a gasket 15 through which air containing particulate matter may pass for filtering.
      <br/>
      The tank 10 includes an inlet 16 through which the air may pass to the filter bag aperture 14.
      <br/>
      The filter bag 12 may be made of a variety of materials including, but not limited to, paper, foam, cloth or other woven materials.
      <br/>
      The filter bag 12 is securely held in place inside the filter tank 10, in part, by a filter bag retainer 18.
      <br/>
      The filter bag retainer 18 may be formed from plastic materials, such as polypropylene, polyethylene, ABS, and/or similar materials.
      <br/>
      Preferably, the filter bag retainer 18 includes two slots 20.
      <br/>
      The slots 20 are used to receive a plate 22 on the filter bag 12.
      <br/>
      Preferably, the plate 22 is made of cardboard and contains an aperture 24 substantially the same size as the inlet 16.
      <br/>
      The plate 22 is permanently attached to the filter bag 12 in a known manner such that the plate aperture 24 substantially aligns with the filter bag aperture 14, thereby creating a filter bag assembly 26.
    </p>
    <p num="14">
      The filter bag retainer 18 includes a threaded cylinder 28 forming a retainer aperture 30.
      <br/>
      Further, the threaded cylinder 28 includes a cylinder abutment 31.
      <br/>
      Preferably, the retainer aperture 30 is substantially the same size as the filter bag aperture 14, the plate aperture 24, and the inlet 16.
      <br/>
      In the preferred embodiment, the filter bag assembly 26 is attached to the filter bag retainer 18 by sliding the plate 22 into the retainer slots 20.
      <br/>
      The filter bag assembly 26 is then held in position inside the tank 10 by inserting the threaded cylinder 28 through the inlet 16 from the inside of the tank 10 to the outside of the tank 10.
      <br/>
      As a result, the inlet 16, the retainer aperture 30, the plate aperture 24, and the filter bag aperture 14 are coaxially aligned.
    </p>
    <p num="15">
      For the purpose of restricting both horizontal and vertical movement of the aligned apertures (14, 16, 24, 30), an inlet fitting 32 is provided.
      <br/>
      The inlet fitting 32 is cylindrical in shape with a ridged end 34 and a non-ridged end 36.
      <br/>
      By inserting the non-ridged end 36 of the inlet fitting 32 through the aligned apertures (14, 16, 24, 30) in a direction from outside the tank 10 to inside the tank 10, the filter bag assembly 26 is prevented from sliding out of the retainer slots 20.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, the filter bag 12 is secured to the retainer 18 by the inlet fitting 32 inside the tank 10, and the particulated air may pass easily through all of the apertures (14, 16, 24, 30).
    </p>
    <p num="16">
      For the purpose of loosely trapping the inlet fitting 32 adjacent the filter bag retainer 18, a swivel fitting 38 is provided.
      <br/>
      The swivel fitting 38 is cylindrical in shape and includes a threaded inner surface 40 and a swivel fitting abutment 42.
      <br/>
      The threaded inner surface 40 of the swivel fitting 38 engages and joins the threaded cylinder 28 of the filter bag retainer 18 by rotation of the swivel fitting 38.
      <br/>
      As the swivel fitting 38 is tightened down on the filter bag retainer 18, a first ridged member 44 of the inlet fitting 32 is loosely trapped adjacent the cylinder abutment 31, and a second ridged member 46 of the inlet fitting 32 is loosely trapped adjacent the swivel fitting abutment 42 (see FIGS. 3-5).
    </p>
    <p num="17">
      In addition, a hose 48 is provided.
      <br/>
      The hose 48 includes a series of outer ribs 52 and a series of inner ribs 54 forming a grooved aperture.
      <br/>
      The inner ribs 54 engage and couple to the second ridged member 46 of the inlet fitting 32 preferably using a force fit in a known manner.
      <br/>
      In this configuration, the end of the hose 48 may travel with the rotating swivel fitting 38 (see FIGS. 3-5).
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      In summary, persons of ordinary skill in the art will readily appreciate that a vacuum cleaner tank assembly for securely housing a filter bag inside a vacuum cleaner tank has been provided.
      <br/>
      Systems implementing the teachings of the invention do not require the user to force and/or bend the cardboard plate into position.
      <br/>
      As a result, user's will find it easier to install a new filter bag.
      <br/>
      Further, less damage will occur to the cardboard plate, thereby decreasing the amount of dirty air that escapes.
