    <p num="1">
      1.
      <br/>
      Technical Field of the Invention
    </p>
    <p num="2">The present invention relates to a contact key switch used as an input key for an electronic instruments such as a telephone, a calculator, and an AV instrument, or a automobile such as a power window and a remote control led door mirror, and a method for its manufacture.</p>
    <p num="3">2. Related Art</p>
    <p num="4">
      As a rule, the rubber-like elastic key pad of the main body of a contact key switch is manufactured using as a material an insulating rubber-like elastic body represented by materials such as a natural rubber, synthetic rubber, or thermoplastic elastic body, by processing with various methods such as compression molding, injection molding, etc.
      <br/>
      Among the rubber-like elastic body, silicon rubber is frequently used for having many characteristics, such as electric insulation, low temperature resistant, heat-proof, chemical resistance, precision molding ability, and resilience elasticity, necessary for a contact key switch.
    </p>
    <p num="5">A contact portion is exemplified by those molded integrally with an electroconductive chip on the contact portion of the key pad in a given shape by mixing carbon black and metal powder in a rubber-like elastic material, those formed by preparing a layer of electroconductive ink on the contact portion by screen printing or pad printing after previous making the main body of the contact key switch, and those molded integrally after preparing the electroconductive chip by punching a layering body, that is made by layering a metal layer plated a metal plate on a rubber layer, in a given shape.</p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="6">
      However, said contact portion has been made by mixing carbon black and metal powder, which are electroconductive media, in an elastic material or ink.
      <br/>
      Therefore, compounding a large quantity of an electroconductive medium yields some 10 ohms or higher of a contact resistance, not allowing a use suitable for the low contact resistance of some ohms or lower.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      In addition, the contact portion of a contact switch made by plating of a metal on a rubber layer is, as described in Japanese Patent Publication 06(1994)-93335 and Japanese Patent Laid-Open 08(1996)-276435, is made of a metal, and suitable for the use for a low resistance.
      <br/>
      However, silicon as the material of the keypad is normally difficult to adhere to a metal as known from the use as a release agent.
      <br/>
      Therefore, adhesive and adhering procedure should be used by selection to make adhesion of both materials possible.
      <br/>
      On the other hand, both sides of the electroconductive chip have consisted of a metal layer and an insulating rubber layer.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the metal layer should be contact with the mold surface at insertion of the mold in molding step.
      <br/>
      This step makes the efficiency of manufacture worse and cost higher.
    </p>
    <p num="8">To solve the aforementioned problem, the present invention provides a contact key switch usable for a low resistance by making the surface of contact portion of contact switch with electroconductive woven fabric or electroconductive nonwoven.</p>
    <p num="9">The material of the rubber part of the main body of the contact switch and layered body is, as used as the contact switch, not specially restricted if having a high resilience elasticity, however, preferably an insulating rubber-like elastic body represented by a synthetic rubber selected from at least any one of natural rubber, ethylenepropylene rubber, silicon rubber, butadiene rubber or a thermoplastic elastic body selected from at least any one of styrene, esters, olefins, urethanes, and vinylated compounds.</p>
    <p num="10">On the other hand, the constituent of the electroconductive woven fabric or electroconductive nonwoven fabric is not specially restricted if at least one of warp fibers or woof fibers is consisted of electroconductive fibers.</p>
    <p num="11">Further, the present invention provides a contact key switch excellent in characteristics such as low temperature resistant, heat-proof, c chemical resistance, precision molding ability, and resilience elasticity, by using silicon rubber for a rubber-like elastic body.</p>
    <p num="12">Furthermore, the present invention provides a contact key switch usable for a low resistance by using material selected from carbon fiber and metal fiber for an electroconductive woven fabric or an electroconductive nonwoven fabric.</p>
    <p num="13">
      According to the present invention, carbon fibers composing the electroconductive woven fabric or the electroconductive nonwoven fabric is selected from fiber constitution of number of wales of 10 to 30 per 25 mm and filament number of 1000 to 6000 in the electroconductive woven fabric and carbon mass rate of 0.03 to 2.5 g per cm3 in the electroconductive nonwoven fabric.
      <br/>
      A smaller number of fiber constitution than that of respective number ranges increases surface resistance by invasion of unvulcanized rubber, in the surface of layered contact portion due to large opening portion of the electroconductive woven fabric or the electroconductive nonwoven fabric.
      <br/>
      A larger number of fiber constitution than that of respective number ranges easily allows surface dissociation by lowered holding performance of vulcanized rubber and fibers caused by no invasion of unvulcanized rubber between fibers due to small opening portion of the electroconductive woven fabric or the electroconductive nonwoven fabric.
    </p>
    <p num="14">The method for manufacture of carbon fibers is not specially restricted, and can be selected from fibers prepared by carbonizing through heat treatment of fibers made by spinning of an organic fibers such as rayon and polyacrylonitrile and purified petroleum pitch in an inert gas atmosphere.</p>
    <p num="15">The material of metal fiber is not specially restricted, and may be fibers such as gold, gold alloy, silver, copper, copper alloy, iron, nickel, brass, and when corrosible material is used, those of which the entire surfaces has been plated with a material, such as gold or gold alloy, not easily corrosible.</p>
    <p num="16">The layered contact portion is manufactured by penetrating unvulcanized rubber into the opening portion of the electroconductive woven fabric or the electroconductive nonwoven fabric to harden and make a layered body, and by punching the layered body in a given shape.</p>
    <p num="17">The layered body made of the rubber layer and the electroconductive woven fabric or the electroconductive nonwoven fabric, of the present invention, is manufactured by layering the electroconductive woven fabric or the electroconductive nonwoven fabric on the unvulcanized rubber to subject to compression molding.</p>
    <p num="18">The layered body made of the rubber layer and the electroconductive woven fabric or the electroconductive nonwoven fabric, of the present invention, is manufactured by layering evenly the unvulcanized rubber on the electroconductive woven fabric or the electroconductive nonwoven fabric using a roll or a blade, if necessary, by further layering the electroconductive woven fabric or the electroconductive nonwoven fabric on the unvulcanized rubber, and by using a hardening furnace with far infrared rays, near-infrared rays, or heat air.</p>
    <p num="19">
      According to aforementioned method, the unvulcanized rubber is hardened after penetrating into the opening portion of the electroconductive woven fabric or the electroconductive nonwoven fabric to allow easy formation of the layered contact portion.
      <br/>
      Thus, selection and use of an adhesive and adhesion process is not necessary.
    </p>
    <p num="20">
      The condition of the unvulcanized rubber of the present invention is not restricted to either a liquid form or a solid form.
      <br/>
      However, when the unvulcanized rubber is evenly layered on the electroconductive woven fabric or the electroconductive nonwoven fabric by using a roll or a blade, the liquid form is preferable for easy penetration into the opening portion of the electroconductive woven fabric or the electroconductive nonwoven fabric.
    </p>
    <p num="21">
      In the use of silicon rubber for the rubber layer, if silane coupling agent is applied to the electroconductive woven fabric or the electroconductive nonwoven fabric, if necessary, the holding performance of the electroconductive woven fabric or the electroconductive nonwoven fabric is increased.
      <br/>
      A silane coupling agent is used broadly in order to improve reactivity with the material which is hard to stick to an end usually.
      <br/>
      For example, there are vinyltrimeto-xylane, amino-silane, and these are appropriately selected according to the material.
      <br/>
      In addition, the rubber layer is not restricted to insulating or electroconductive rubber layer.
      <br/>
      However, if electroconductive rubber is used, the contact resistance of the contact portion shows a tendency to fall to a lower value.
      <br/>
      The layered contact portion is formed by punching the layered body in a given shape.
      <br/>
      The layered contact portion is engaged to the contact part of the mold of the rubber-like elastic key pad to fit the surface of the electroconductive woven fabric or the electroconductive nonwoven fabric to the mold, followed by integrated molding by inserting the rubber-like elastic material in the mold.
    </p>
    <p num="22">The layered body made of the rubber layer and the electroconductive woven fabric or the electroconductive nonwoven fabric, of the present invention, is manufactured by putting the electroconductive woven fabric or the electroconductive nonwoven fabric on the mold for injection molding, extruding the thermoplastic elastic body to the mold, and seizing the melted thermoplastic elastic body to the electroconductive woven fabric or the electroconductive nonwoven fabric or penetrating to the opening portion of the electroconductive woven fabric or the electroconductive nonwoven fabric.</p>
    <p num="23">
      Layering the electroconductive woven fabric or the electroconductive nonwoven fabric on both sides of the rubber layer causes both sides to have electroconductivity in the layered contact portion.
      <br/>
      Therefore, a jig or an apparatus for identifying the side of the layered contact portion is not necessary for insertion of the layered contact portion in the contact part of the mold to allow efficient manufacture.

      Embodiments of the present invention are given below according to the FIG. 1.
      <br/>
      FIG. 1 is a sectional view of a contact key switch, showing an embodiment of the present invention.
    </p>
    <p num="27">
      In the FIG. 1, main body 1 of the contact key switch has been made of non-operation portion 1a, operation portion 1b, thin skirt portion 1c connecting them, and a projecting portion 1d projecting downward integrally with an elastic body.
      <br/>
      The surface of layered contact portion 2 is made of the electroconductive woven fabric or the electroconductive nonwoven fabric.
    </p>
    <p num="28">
      In one embodiment, silicon rubber was used for the main body 1 of the contact key switch.
      <br/>
      For a carbon fiber forming the electroconductive woven fabric or the electroconductive nonwoven fabric of the surface of the contact portion, Torekakurosu made by Toray K. K. was used in the electroconductive woven fabric and Torekamatto (made by Toray K. K.) was used in the electroconductive nonwoven fabric.
      <br/>
      Electroconductive silicon rubber was used in the rubber layer.
    </p>
    <p num="29">
      The rubber layer of layered electroconductive portion is not specially restricted if integrated hardening is possible by vulcanizing the main body of the contact switch and carbon fiber fabric.
      <br/>
      However, a rubber-like elastic body made of the same material as that of the main body of the contact switch is preferable.
      <br/>
      Silicon rubber containing 50 weight part of carbon black was used.
      <br/>
      The contact resistance of the layered contact portion was 2 to 3  OMEGA .
    </p>
    <p num="30">A method for manufacture of the layered contact portion of the present invention is described below for using the carbon fiber fabric according to the FIG. 2.</p>
    <p num="31">
      As shown in the FIG. 2, the layered body 2 made by layering a rubber sheet 2b on the carbon fiber fabric 2a and layering the carbon fiber fabric 2a on the rubber sheet 2b was subjected to compression molding under 190 kgf/cm2 using unvulcanized electroconductive silicon rubber layer and the carbon fiber fabric (Torekakurosu made by Toray K. K.), vulcanized and integrated, punched in a given shape to manufacture the layered contact portion as shown in the FIG. 3.
      <br/>
      In the case of using the Torekamatto (made by Toray K. K.) as the carbon fiber nonwoven fabric for the layered contact portion, manufacture was carried out by same method as that of the carbon fiber fabric.
    </p>
    <p num="32">
      The contact key switch was manufactured by putting the layered contact portion in a mold and putting silicon rubber as a rubber-like elastic body of the main body 1 of the contact switch in the mold to mold integrally.
      <br/>
      The compression pressure at the compression molding is not restricted if the layered contact portion can be molded in a given thickness.
      <br/>
      However, Preferable pressure is 100 to 200 kgf/cm2 in either unvulcanized rubber of liquid form or solid form.
    </p>
    <p num="33">
      Table 1 presents the result of the electroconductive woven fabric in the layered contact portion made of carbon fibers.
      <br/>
      Similarly, Table 2 presents the result of the electroconductive nonwoven fabric.

      The contact key switch of the present invention has the surface of electroconductive contact portion made of woven fabric or nonwoven fabric of electroconductive fibers.
      <br/>
      Thus, the same low resistance was yielded as that of the contact portion made of a metal plate.
    </p>
    <p num="39">
      Further, manufacture of the layered contact portion by punching in a given shape the layered body, of which both surfaces of the rubber layer is covered by the electroconductive woven fabric or the electroconductive nonwoven fabric, gives electroconductivity to the both surfaces of the layered contact portion.
      <br/>
      Therefore, a jig or an apparatus or the like for identifying the side of the layered contact portion is not necessary for insertion of the layered contact portion in the contact part of the mold to allow efficient manufacture and a low cost.
    </p>
    <p num="40">
      The main body of the contact key switch and the electroconductive woven fabric or the electroconductive nonwoven fabric are easily and integrally molded by using same material to the rubber layer of the layered contact portion and the rubber-like elastic body of the main body of the contact switch.
      <br/>
      Thus, selection of an adhesive and adhesion process for use is not necessary.
    </p>
    <p num="41">Furthermore, the use of carbon fibers for the electroconductive woven fabric or the electroconductive nonwoven fabric prevents an increasing of resistance caused by oxidation which easily occurs in a metal to provide the contact key switch of high reliability.</p>
    <p num="42">
      The carbon fibers are selected from a composition of number of wales of 10 to 30 per 25 mm and filament number of 1000 to 6000 in the electroconductive woven fabric and from carbon mass rate of 0.03 to 2.5 g/cm3 in the electroconductive nonwoven fabric.
      <br/>
      By this, a high quality contact key switch has a low contact resistance and a high durability.
