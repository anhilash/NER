    <p num="2">The present invention is directed to a replaceable chip module for electrically connecting one or more first circuit members to a second circuit member.</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="3">
      The current trend in connector design for those connectors utilized in the computer field is to provide both high density and high reliability connectors between various circuit devices.
      <br/>
      High reliability for such connections is essential due to potential system failure caused by misconnections of devices.
      <br/>
      Further, to assure effective repair, upgrade, testing and/or replacement of various components, such as connectors, cards, chips, boards, and modules, it is highly desirable that such connections be separable and reconnectable in the final product.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      Pin-type connectors soldered into plated through holes or vias are among the most commonly used in the industry today.
      <br/>
      Pins on the connector body are inserted through plated holes or vias on a printed circuit board and soldered in place using conventional means.
      <br/>
      Another connector or a packaged semiconductor device is then inserted and retained by the connector body by mechanical interference or friction.
      <br/>
      The tin lead alloy solder and associated chemicals used throughout the process of soldering these connectors to the printed circuit board have come under increased scrutiny due to their environmental impact.
      <br/>
      The plastic housings of these connectors undergo a significant amount of thermal activity during the soldering process, which stresses the component and threatens reliability.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      The soldered contacts on the connector body are typically the means of supporting the device being interfaced by the connector and are subject to fatigue, stress deformation, solder bridging, and co-planarity errors, potentially causing premature failure or loss of continuity.
      <br/>
      In particular, as the mating connector or semiconductor device is inserted and removed from the present connector, the elastic limit on the contacts soldered to the circuit board may be exceeded causing a loss of continuity.
      <br/>
      These connectors are typically not reliable for more than a few insertions and removals of devices.
      <br/>
      These devices also have a relatively long electrical length that can degrade system performance, especially for high frequency or low power components.
      <br/>
      The pitch or separation between adjacent device leads that can be produced using these connectors is also limited due to the risk of shorting.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      Another electrical interconnection method is known as wire bonding, which involves the mechanical or thermal compression of a soft metal wire, such as gold, from one circuit to another.
      <br/>
      Such bonding, however, does not lend itself readily to high density connections because of possible wire breakage and accompanying mechanical difficulties in wire handling.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      An alternate electrical interconnection technique involves placement of solder balls or the like between respective circuit elements.
      <br/>
      The solder is reflowed to form the electrical interconnection.
      <br/>
      While this technique has proven successful in providing high density interconnections for various structures, this technique does not allow facile separation and subsequent reconnection of the circuit members.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      An elastomer having a plurality of conductive paths has also been used as an interconnection device.
      <br/>
      The conductive elements embedded in the elastomeric sheet provide an electrical connection between two opposing terminals brought into contact with the elastomeric sheet.
      <br/>
      The elastomeric material that supports the conductive elements compresses during usage to allow some movement of the conductive elements.
      <br/>
      Such elastomeric connectors require a relatively high force per contact to achieve adequate electrical connection, exacerbating non-planarity between mating surfaces.
      <br/>
      Location of the conductive elements is generally not controllable.
      <br/>
      Elastomeric connectors may also exhibit a relatively high electrical resistance through the interconnection between the associated circuit elements.
      <br/>
      The interconnection with the circuit elements can be sensitive to dust, debris, oxidation, temperature fluctuations, vibration, and other environmental elements that may adversely affect the connection.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      The problems associated with connector design are multiplied when multiple integrated circuit devices are packaged together in functional groups.
      <br/>
      The traditional way is to solder the components to a printed circuit board, flex circuit, or ceramic substrate in either a bare die silicon integrated circuit form or packaged form.
      <br/>
      Multi-chip modules, ball grids, array packaging, and chip scale packaging have evolved to allow multiple integrated circuit devices to be interconnected in a group.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      One of the major issues regarding these technologies is the difficulty in soldering the components, while ensuring that reject conditions do not exist.
      <br/>
      Many of these devices rely on balls of solder attached to the underside of the integrated circuit device which is then reflown to connect with surface mount pads of the printed circuit board, flex circuit, or ceramic substrate.
      <br/>
      As discussed above, these joints have not been proven to be extremely reliable nor easy to inspect for defects.
      <br/>
      The process to remove and repair a damaged or defective device is costly and many times results in unusable electronic components and damage to other components in the functional group.
    </p>
    <p num="11">
      Multi-chip modules have had slow acceptance in the industry due to the lack of large scale known good die for integrated circuits that have been tested and burned-in at the silicon level.
      <br/>
      These dies are then mounted to a substrate which interconnect several components.
      <br/>
      As the number of devices increases, the probability of failure increases dramatically.
      <br/>
      With the chance of one device failing in some way and effective means of repairing or replacing currently unavailable, yield rates have been low and the manufacturing costs high.
    </p>
    <heading>BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="12">
      The present invention is directed to a replaceable chip module for electrically connecting one or more first circuit members to a second circuit member.
      <br/>
      The replaceable chip module includes a module housings having a plurality of device sites each capable of receiving at least one first circuit member.
      <br/>
      A first connector is located in each of the device sites.
      <br/>
      The first connector comprises one or more first contact members comprising a first compliant member defining a first circuit interface engageable with the first circuit member, a resilient, dielectric encapsulating material defining a second compliant member surrounding a portion of the first contact member, the first and second compliant members providing a first mode of compliance, and at least one end stop positioned to engage with the first contact member in a second mode of compliance.
      <br/>
      A second connector is positioned to electrically connect the first connector to the second circuit member.
    </p>
    <p num="13">
      In one embodiment, second connector comprises a second contact member having substantially the same structure as the first contact member.
      <br/>
      In one embodiment, the first contact member and a second contact member comprise a single contact member extending between the first and second circuit members.
      <br/>
      A third electrical connector can optionally be provided for electrically connecting the second circuit member to a third circuit member.
      <br/>
      In one embodiment, the third circuit member comprises the present replaceable chip module.
    </p>
    <p num="14">
      The first connector has multiple modes of compliance and an initial insertion force differing from a secondary insertion force.
      <br/>
      The first connector has multiple compliant members that can be independently adjusted to accommodate a wide range of first and second circuit members.
      <br/>
      The first connector allows the contact members to be arranged with a pitch of less than 0.50 millimeters without shorting.
      <br/>
      The multiple compliant contact members accommodate a wide range of thermal and vibrational effects, and can be configured to accommodate a wide range of compression distances.
    </p>
    <p num="15">
      The present invention is also directed to a method of utilizing the present replaceable chip module during multiple phases in the life of an integrated circuit device.
      <br/>
      After placement into the replaceable chip module, the integrated circuit devices can be tested, identified, burned-in, and used in production without ever having to be removed or handled.
      <br/>
      If one or more of the integrated circuit devices fails during the testing, identification, burn-in, or production phases, the individual circuit device can be removed from the replaceable chip module without damage to the other integrated circuit devices or the replaceable chip module.
    </p>
    <p num="16">
      Each of the first circuit members can be removed and replaced in the event of failure, upgraded, or changed in configuration.
      <br/>
      The short electrical length of the multi-mode compliance connector allows for excellent signal integrity and overall size similar to current packaging techniques.
      <br/>
      By eliminating the need to solder the first circuit members into the module, the present invention greatly reduces the implications of known good die or burn-in packaged integrated circuits.
    </p>
    <p num="17">
      In theory, any printed circuit board, multi-chip module, or flex circuit that has components soldered in some arrangement can be eliminated by use of the present replaceable chip module.
      <br/>
      An exemplary list of other applications include dual in-line or single in-line memory modules for use in computers, multi-chip modules for use in a variety of applications, PCMCIA cards for use in notebook computers, embedded computer system cards, and conventional PC board replacement.
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      The use of electrical connectors with multiple modes of compliance at each device site allows the integrated circuit devices to be placed very close together.
      <br/>
      Bare die silicon integrated circuits can be located directly in the device site without additional packaging.
      <br/>
      Additionally, a wide variety of package devices such as a ball grid array (BGA), land grid array (LGA), plastic leaded chip carrier (PLCC), pin grid array (PGA), edge card, small outline integrated circuit (SOIC), dual in-line package (DIP), quad flat package (QFP), leadless chip carrier (LCC), chip scale package (CSP) where the package size is within 20% of the bare die silicon, can be accommodated in a number of configurations with use of the present replaceable chip module.
      <br/>
      As used herein, integrated circuit refers to packaged or unpackaged bare silicon integrated circuit devices.
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      The present replaceable chip module can replace a printed circuit board with a group of integrated circuit devices soldered thereto.
      <br/>
      The present invention allows for economical use of conventional materials that do not need to withstand the temperature effects of repeated soldering and reflow.
      <br/>
      By including locations for many devices in one module, the space required is much smaller than if multiple device connectors were to be used.
    </p>
    <p num="20">
      For example, recent studies have shown that modular schemes, such as MCM's, multiple-chip packages, Intel's Pentium 2, memory modules, and PCMCIA cards have demonstrated the benefit of grouping integrated circuit devices together to attain short interconnect lengths.
      <br/>
      Many expensive integrated circuit devices, such as microprocessors and microcontrollers, are placed into an integrated circuit attach connector so that they can be removed and replaced if needed without the damaging effects of reflow and rework.
      <br/>
      The present invention allows for the modular concept to be taken to the next step, with a plurality of components retained in a single module where they can be inserted and removed without the need for solder or soldering processes.

      As the connector 40 is pressed onto the circuit interface portion 66, it comes in contact with the pad 60.
      <br/>
      The compliant encapsulant 46 allows for initial movement of the distal end 74 until it contacts end stop 76 on the housing 44.
      <br/>
      The movement of the distal end 74 preferably includes both vertical and horizontal components so as to cause a wiping action of the circuit interface portion 66 across the surface of the pad 60.

    <p num="47">
      Elastic deformation of the contact member 42 and movement of the contact member 42 within the relatively soft encapsulating material 46 defines a first mode of compliance.
      <br/>
      The filaments 43 may also contribute to the first mode of compliance where present.
      <br/>
      The first mode of compliance compensates for nonplanarity of the contact members on the circuit member 52.
      <br/>
      A relatively soft encapsulating material 46 provides a relatively low initial insertion force for the present connector 40.
      <br/>
      Insertion force refers to engagement of the present connector 40 with one or more circuit members 50, 52.
    </p>
    <p num="48">
      After the distal end 74 of the contact member 42 is engaged with the end stop 76, the base metal of the contact acts as a load spring, providing the second mode of compliance.
      <br/>
      The end stop 76 prevents compression beyond the elastic limit of the contact 42 or the encapsulant 46.
      <br/>
      Similarly, the distal end 70 of the contact 42 then encounters end stop 72 on the housing 44, stopping rotational and translational movement in either the horizontal or vertical directions.
    </p>
    <p num="49">
      The first mode of compliance is determined primarily by the resilience of the encapsulating material 46, although the elastic deformation of the contact member 42 and the filaments 43 may also be factors.
      <br/>
      The encapsulant 46 provides a relatively large range of motion at a low force, allowing for the contact 56 to achieve continuity and planarity despite a significant mismatch.
      <br/>
      The filaments 43 can help define the rotational or translational movement of the contact member 42 during the first mode of compliance.
    </p>
    <p num="50">
      Once the contact member 42 is compressed against the end stops 72, 78, the base metal substantially defines the second mode of compliance, providing long term connection that resists failure due to fatigue, vibration, temperature fluctuation, and excessive or repeated insertion.
      <br/>
      The second circuit interface portion 66 operates similarly, although the initial and secondary insertion forces may vary.
    </p>
    <p num="51">
      The significance of the present connector 40 is that interconnection between the contact member 42 and the device leads 56, 60 is independently acting and independently controlled.
      <br/>
      For example, the connector 40 is capable of having a different first mode of compliance for the first and second circuit interface portions 62, 66, respectively, by using two or more encapsulating materials.
      <br/>
      The geometry or thickness of the contact member may also be adjusted to provide a different second modes of compliance at the first and second circuit interface portions 62, 66.
      <br/>
      For example, the first circuit interface portion 62 provides greater resistance to the contact 56 in the second mode of compliance.
      <br/>
      The geometry of the second circuit interface portion 66 is such that the resistance provided to the contact 60 in the second mode of compliance is less than the resistance provided by the first circuit interface portion.
    </p>
    <p num="52">
      The present methodology permits the size, shape, location or material of the contact member and the composition, durometer value and quantity of the encapsulating material, to be varied to accommodate a wide range of connector applications.
      <br/>
      The present connector 40 may also be configured to provide a relatively short electrical path.
      <br/>
      The connector 40 is capable of achieving a fine pitch that typically cannot be achieved by pin type connectors.
      <br/>
      The present connector 40 does not rely on the encapsulant as the sole means of support and does not require the connection members to be deformed in order to gain continuity with the circuit members 50, 52.
    </p>
    <p num="53">
      For conventional semiconductor device applications, the encapsulating material 46 provides a low initial insertion force in the range of about 10 grams to about 30 grams.
      <br/>
      The contact member provides a higher secondary insertion force in the range of about 40 grams to about 100 grams.
      <br/>
      The resulting electrical interconnection provides a higher long term force load toward the end of its engagement motion to ensure long term continuity without failure due to fatigue, compression set, or oxidation.

      Deformation of the encapsulating material 132 and the contact member 130 provide a first mode of compliance whereby the distal end 136 moves toward the end stop 138.
      <br/>
      Similarly, as the second circuit interface portion 144 is brought into engagement with a connector member (not shown), the distal portion 140 moves in a first mode of compliance toward the end stop 142.
      <br/>
      Once the distal portions 136, 140 are engaged with the end stops 138, 142, respectively, the contact member 130 operates as a load spring in a second mode of compliance and deforms within its elastic range.

      A contact member 154 is retained within housing 156 by encapsulating material 158.

      The encapsulating material 158 retains distal end 160 of the contact member 154 in a spaced relationship from end stop 162.

      As the connector pad 152 is brought into engagement with the circuit interface portion 164 of the contact member 154, the distal end 160 is displaced in a first mode of compliance until it engages with the end stop 162.
      <br/>
      Deformation of the contact member 154 may provide a component of the first mode of compliance.
      <br/>
      A center portion 166 of the contact member 154 pivots on a portion 168 of the housing 156 so that engagement with the contact pad 152 causes the contact member 154 to rotate in a counterclockwise direction.

      In particular, the sharp point formed in the contact member 154A at the circuit interface portions 164A, 170A provides greater resistance to elastic deformation than the curved circuit interface portions 164, 170 illustrated in FIG. 8A.

      The contact member 154B has a shape intended to provide less resistance in the second mode of compliance than provided by the contact member 154 of FIG. 8A. Although the curvature of the circuit interface portions 164B, 170B corresponds generally to that shown in FIG. 8A, the inverted curvature of the contact member 154B provides for less resistance during the second mode of compliance, and hence a lower secondary insertion force.

      A contact member 202 is located in a housing 204.
      <br/>
      A first circuit interface portion 206 on the contact member 202 extends above a surface 208 of the housing 204.
      <br/>
      The second circuit interface portion 210 extends above a surface 209 of the housing 204.
      <br/>
      Alternately, the first and second interface 15 portions 206, 210 may be recessed below the surfaces 208, 209, respectively.
      <br/>
      Resilient materials 212, 213 (also referred to as the "second resilient material") are interposed between the rigid connector member 202 and the housing 204 in two separate locations.
      <br/>
      The connector member 202 and resilient members 212, 213 are retained within the housing 204 by an encapsulating material 214.
    </p>
    <p num="64">
      The contact member 202 may be supported by one or more suspension filament 220, 227A, 227B to precisely locate the contact member 202 during encapsulation.
      <br/>
      The suspension filaments 220, 227A, 227B are preferably anchored to the housing 204 (see FIG. 13).
      <br/>
      The suspension filaments 220, 227A, 227B may be permanent or may be removed after application of the encapsulating material 214.
    </p>
    <p num="65">
      The suspension filaments 220, 227A, 227B may be a rigid material or a flexible material.
      <br/>
      The suspension filaments 220, 227A-227B are preferably flexible, but not extendible so as to permit limited translational and rotational movement of the contact member 202.
      <br/>
      The conductive elements 202 may be positioned along the filament 220 in such a way that a minimum of two moment arms are created as a result of the location of the interface point along the body of the contact member 202.
      <br/>
      A single rigid suspension member 220 may be located at a single point 221 near or along the major axis of the contact member 202 such that it provides a pivot point for rotation.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, second and/or third suspension filaments 227A, 227B may optionally be included (see FIGS. 19 and 20).
    </p>
    <p num="66">
      The filaments 220, 227A, 227B may be located at any point along the body of the contact member 202 such that it will be positioned in a desired location when the connector 200 is at rest, but will not be restricted from a desired amount of transitional or rotational movement.
      <br/>
      The suspension filaments 220, 227A, 227B may remain in place after encapsulation, and will result in a reinforced composite that will function in practice in a manner different from that of the encapsulant alone.
      <br/>
      The filaments 220, 227 will allow the desired motion of the contact member 202 upon incident with the opposing terminals that are to be connected, but will restrict movement in one or more directions as well as limit the total travel of the contact member 202, resulting in an action that will prevent damage to the encapsulant 214, the secondary resilient members 212, 213, the contact member 202, or the opposing terminal 216.
      <br/>
      The nature of contact member 202 action will allow for each member to move independent of its neighbor through a range sufficient to accommodate co-planarity variances between the conductive elements and any of the opposing terminals to be connected.
    </p>
    <p num="67">
      The contact member 202 is preferably rigid.
      <br/>
      As the connector member 216 on the first circuit member 218 is brought in contact with the first circuit interface portion 206, the encapsulating material 214 allows for both translational and rotational movement of the contact member 202 around a filament 220.
      <br/>
      Movement of the contact member 202 within the encapsulating material 214 comprises a first mode of compliance, resulting in a relatively low initial insertion force with a circuit members, such as 218.
      <br/>
      The compliant encapsulant 214 allows vertical movement until contact member 202 encounters one or both of the resilient materials 212, 213.
      <br/>
      The resilient materials 212, 213 in combination with the encapsulant 214 (and optionally the filaments 220, 227A, 227B) provide the second mode of compliance.
      <br/>
      In the preferred embodiment, the resilient materials 212, 213 are stiffer (higher durometer value) than the encapsulant 214, so that the secondary insertion force is larger than the initial insertion force.
      <br/>
      The contact member 202 eventually contacts end stops 222, 223 on the housing 204.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, the resilient materials 212, 213 may be selected so that the secondary insertion force is less than the initial insertion force.
    </p>
    <p num="68">
      The encapsulant 214 provides a relatively large range of motion at a low force, allowing for the contact 202 to achieve continuity and planarity despite a significant mismatch.
      <br/>
      In one embodiment, the filament 220 is not a rigid support, allowing for both rotational and translational movement of the contact 202.
      <br/>
      Once the contact member 202 is compressed against the resilient material 212, 213, the second mode of compliance provides long term connection that resists failure due to fatigue, vibration, temperature fluctuation, and excessive or repeated insertion.
      <br/>
      In an alternate embodiment in which the contact member 202 is flexible, the connector 200 will operate as a loading spring, as discussed above in connection with FIGS. 1-3.

      FIG. 13 is a perspective view of the connector 200 having a plurality of contact members 202 separated by spacers 224.

      The spacers may be incorporated into the filament 220.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, the contact members 202 may be retained in the desired spaced relationship during application of the encapsulating material 214 (see FIG. 12A).
      <br/>
      The filament 220 is supported by the housing 204.
      <br/>
      The spacing between the contact members 202 may be adjusted by altering the thickness of the spacers 224.
      <br/>
      The present connector is preferably capable of providing contact members having a pitch of less than about 0.4 mm, and more preferably less than about 0.2 mm. The spacers 224 may be constructed from a variety of dielectric materials, such as plastic or ceramics.
