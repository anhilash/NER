    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>

      1.
      <br/>
      Field of the Invention
    </p>
    <p num="3">The present invention generally relates to semiconductor devices and a method of manufacturing the same, and more particularly, a semiconductor device formed on an SOI (Silicon on Insulator) substrate in order to implement high speed operation and a method of manufacturing the same.</p>
    <p num="4">2. Description of the Background Art</p>
    <p num="5">Referring to FIGS. 75 to 77, description will be given of a plan structure and a sectional structure of a semiconductor device having a gate array, having a plurality of gates disposed thereon, formed on a silicon substrate.</p>
    <p num="6">
      At a prescribed position of a silicon substrate 316, formed is a field oxide film 302.
      <br/>
      Silicon substrate 316 includes a p type MOS field effect transistor forming region 310, and an n type MOS field effect transistor forming region 312 formed therein.
      <br/>
      Gate electrode 304 are disposed regularly in respective MOS field effect transistor forming regions 310, 312.
      <br/>
      In a semiconductor device including a gate array structure as described above, respective blocks in which gate electrodes 304 are disposed are electrically isolated from each other by field oxide film 302.
      <br/>
      In one block, active regions are electrically isolated by gate electrode 304.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      Referring to FIG. 78, the operational principle of isolation of transistors by an electrode will be specifically described, taking n type MOS field effect transistor forming region 312 as an example.
      <br/>
      By fixing gate electrode 304 to a ground potential, for example, a transistor 317 formed of a gate electrode 318, a source region 320 and a drain region 322, and a transistor 323 formed of a gate electrode 324, a source region 326 and a drain region 328 are electrically isolated from each other.
      <br/>
      These transistors can operate independently.
      <br/>
      In p type MOS field effect transistor forming region 310, by fixing to the power supply potential gate electrode 304 between transistors to be isolated, the similar effects can be obtained.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      As described above, a method for electrically isolating transistors by fixing a gate electrode between the transistors to be isolated to the power supply potential or the ground potential is called a gate isolation method.
      <br/>
      The gate electrode between the transistors is called a gate isolation gate electrode.
      <br/>
      The gate isolation method is suitable for high integration as compared to an isolation method using a field oxide film, because the gate electrode can effectively be used in the former method.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      Description will now be given of a semiconductor device configuring a 3-input NAND gate using the above-described gate isolation method with reference to FIGS. 79 and 80. FIG. 80 is a plan view of the semiconductor device configuring a 3-input NAND gate shown in (a), (b) of FIG. 79. In FIG. 80, the upper block corresponds to a p type MOS field effect transistor forming region, and the lower block corresponds to an n type MOS field effect transistor forming region.
      <br/>
      By configuring a gate electrode and a source/drain region in an internal interconnection structure as shown in FIG. 80, a 3-input NAND gate can be easily configured.
      <br/>
      In FIG. 80, by fixing the rightmost gate electrode of the p type MOS field effect transistor forming region and the rightmost gate electrode of the n type MOS field effect transistor forming region to the power supply potential and the ground potential, respectively, these forming regions can be electrically isolated from the other adjacent transistors.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      A semiconductor device having a conventional gate array having a plurality of gates disposed therein, which is described above, is formed on a bulk silicon substrate.
      <br/>
      Formation of such a semiconductor device on an SOI (Silicon on Insulator) substrate is currently studied.
      <br/>
      If a CMOS (Complementary Metal-Oxide Semiconductor) field effect transistor is formed on an SOI substrates the following features can be obtained as compared to a CMOS field effect transistor formed on a bulk silicon substrate:
    </p>
    <p num="11">
      (1) Increase in drivability
      <br/>
      (2) Reduction of junction capacitance in source/drain region
      <br/>
      (3) Latchup free
    </p>
    <p num="12">
      FIGS. 81 and 82 show cross sections in the case where MOS field effect transistors are formed on a bulk silicon substrate and an SOI substrate, respectively.
      <br/>
      In the case of the transistor fabricated on the SOI substrate, a depletion layer under a channel extends only to a buried oxide film.
      <br/>
      Therefore, a voltage applied to a gate electrode effectively generates carriers in the channel, resulting in increase of drivability.
      <br/>
      Since a source/drain junction is formed only in a surface perpendicular to an SOI layer because of the buried oxide film, the junction capacitance in the source/drain region can be reduced.
      <br/>
      Since respective MOS field effect transistors are electrically isolated completely by the buried oxide film, latchup, which has been conventionally problematic, will not occur.
    </p>
    <p num="13">Because of the above features, high speed operation without latchup can be expected by forming a gate array on an SOI substrate.</p>
    <p num="14">
      In an MOS field effect transistor fabricated on the conventional SOI substrate, the breakdown voltage between source and drain is lowered as compared to an MOS field effect transistor fabricated on the bulk silicon substrate, because of the substrate floating effect of an SOI layer serving as a channel.
      <br/>
      Referring to FIGS. 83 and 84, described is how the breakdown voltage between source and drain is lowered because of the substrate floating effect.
      <br/>
      FIG. 83 shows the Id-Vd characteristics of an MOS field effect transistor fabricated on a bulk silicon substrate, and FIG. 84 shows the Id-Vd characteristics of an MOS field effect transistor fabricated on an SOI substrate.
    </p>
    <p num="15">
      Referring to these figures, in the MOS field effect transistor fabricated on the bulk silicon substrate, the breakdown voltage is 5V or more.
      <br/>
      On the other hand, in the MOS field effect transistor fabricated on the SOI substrate, the breakdown voltage is only approximately 2V.
    </p>
    <p num="16">
      Description will now be given of the substrate floating effect with reference to FIGS. 85 and 86. A hole 338 generated by impact ionization in a depletion layer in the vicinity of a drain region 334 is stored in a lower portion of a channel region 332 in the vicinity of a source region 330.
      <br/>
      Holes 338 are sequentially accumulated in the lower portion of channel region 332, thereby increasing the potential of an SOI layer to induce injection of an electron 336 from source region 330.
      <br/>
      The injected electron 336 reaches the vicinity of drain region 334 to generate new hole 338.
      <br/>
      As described above, a so-called feed forward loop formed by injection of electron 336 and generation of hole 338 causes the breakdown voltage between source and drain to decrease.
    </p>
    <p num="17">
      In order to prevent the substrate floating effect, several methods are being studied.
      <br/>
      The most reliable one is a method of preventing storage of holes 338 by fixing the potential of a channel region 344, with reference to FIG. 87. In the case of an n type MOS field effect transistor, for example, storage of holes 338 can be prevented by fixing the potential of the channel region to ground potential.
      <br/>
      Similarly, in the case of a p type MOS field effect transistor, storage of holes 338 can be prevented by fixing the potential of the channel region to power supply potential.
      <br/>
      In order to fix the potential of channel region 332, the SOI layer under gate electrode 304 is drawn out, and a region 350 for providing a body contact 352 is formed.
      <br/>
      As a result, storage of holes 338 can be prevented.
      <br/>
      However, this method necessitates an additional region 350 for forming a body contact, which hampers high integration of a semiconductor device.

    <p num="42">Description will now be given of the first embodiment of the present invention with reference to the drawings.</p>
    <p num="43">
      Referring to FIG. 1, a sectional structure of the semiconductor device of the first embodiment will be described.
      <br/>
      A buried oxide film 4 of a thickness of approximately 3800  Angstrom  to 4200  Angstrom  is formed on a silicon substrate 2.
      <br/>
      An SOI layer 5 of a thickness of approximately 500  Angstrom  to 1000  Angstrom  is formed on buried oxide film 4.
      <br/>
      A first field oxide film 10 covering the surface of SOI layer 5 and reaching the surface of buried oxide film 4 is formed on the surface of SOI layer 5.
      <br/>
      First field oxide film 10 isolates a pMOS field effect transistor active region 6 and an nMOS field effect transistor active region 8.
      <br/>
      A second field oxide film 12 separating a pMOS field effect transistor into two or more regions is formed on the surface of pMOS field effect transistor active region 6.
      <br/>
      Second field oxide film 12 separating an nMOS field effect transistor into two or more regions is also formed on the surface of nMOS field effect transistor active region 8.
    </p>
    <p num="44">
      As shown in FIG. 1, by forming first field oxide film 10 large in thickness so as to be in contact with buried oxide film 4, a pMOS field effect transistor forming region and an nMOS field effect transistor forming region can be isolated from each other completely.
      <br/>
      Latchup can be completely prevented.
      <br/>
      By forming second field oxide film 12 smaller in thickness than first field oxide film 10, it is possible to fix the potential of a channel portion using SOI layer 5 of a region under second field oxide film 12.
    </p>
    <p num="45">Referring to FIG. 2, description will now be given of a method of fixing the potential under second field oxide film 12.</p>
    <p num="46">
      In pMOS field effect transistor active region 6, an n type potential fixing region 22 is formed in a region under second field oxide film 12.

      <br/>
      Potential fixing electrode 18 is provided between gate electrode 24 of the p MOS field effect transistor of second field oxide film 12.
    </p>
    <p num="48">

      <br/>
      A plurality of gate electrode 26 of the nMOS field effect transistor are provided over first field oxide film 10 and second field oxide film 12.
      <br/>

    </p>
    <p num="49">
      Referring to FIG. 4, description will now be given of a conductivity type of the semiconductor device shown in FIG. 3.
      <br/>
      In pMOS field effect transistor active region 6, formed is a source/drain region 32 of the pMOS field effect transistor of a p type region having an impurity concentration of 1 * 1019 cm-3 or more.
      <br/>
      Also formed is a channel region 28 of the pMOS field effect transistor of an n type region having an impurity concentration of 1 * 1018 cm-3 or less. n type potential fixing region 22 having an impurity concentration higher than that of channel region 28 is formed in a region positioned lower of second field oxide film 12.
    </p>
    <p num="50">
      In nMOS field effect transistor active region 8, formed is a source/drain region 34 of the nMOS field effect transistor of an n type region having an impurity concentration of 1 * 1019 cm-3 or more.
      <br/>
      Also formed is a channel region 30 of the nMOS field effect transistor of a p type region having an impurity concentration of 1 * 1018 cm-3 or less. p type potential fixing region 20 having an impurity concentration higher than that of channel region 30 is formed in a region positioned lower of second field oxide film 12.
    </p>
    <p num="51">
      Referring to FIG. 5, description will be given of an improvement of a breakdown voltage between source and drain.
      <br/>
      FIG. 5(a) shows an enlarged A region of nMOS field effect transistor active region 8 shown in FIG. 4.
      <br/>
      In the figure, impurity concentrations of n type source region 34, n type drain region 34, p type channel region 30 and p type potential fixing region 20 are set at 1 * 1020 cm-3, 1 * 1020 cm-3, 1 * 1017 cm-3, and 1 * 108 cm-3, respectively.
    </p>
    <p num="52">
      Consider the case where an MOS field effect transistor having its gate potential set at 0V is turned off, for example.
      <br/>
      With the source potential set at 0V, when 5V is applied to drain region 34, for example, a depletion layer 40 extends in a pn junction portion in the vicinity of drain region 34, and most of the voltage of 5V is applied to depletion layer 40.
      <br/>
      As a result, carriers accelerated by the electric field in depletion layer 40 causes impact ionization to generate a new pair of an electron 36 and a hole 38.
      <br/>
      The generated electron 36 is attracted by the electric field in depletion layer 40 to enter drain region 34.
    </p>
    <p num="53">
      On the other hand, the generated hole 38 enters channel region 30 according to the electric field in depletion layer 40.
      <br/>
      As the potential for hole 38 of channel region 30 changes in a shape of a valley as shown in FIG. 5(b), hole 38 is accumulated in channel region 30.
    </p>
    <p num="54">
      Since p type potential fixing region 20 is formed at the side of channel region 30 in this embodiment, however, the accumulated hole 38 flows to p type potential fixing region 20 at a lower potential level.
      <br/>
      Therefore, hole 38 flowing in p type potential fixing region 20 is drawn to the outside of the element by potential fixing electrode 16.
      <br/>
      As a result, the potential is not increased by storage of hole 38 in channel region 30.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the breakdown voltage between source and drain can be improved.
      <br/>
      Even in the pMOS field effect transistor active region, it is possible to improve the breakdown voltage between source and drain by drawing an electron accumulated in the channel through potential fixing electrode 18.

      In the mesa isolation method, active regions are isolated with an SOI layer of an active region left and the other portions etched away.
      <br/>
      In the field shield isolation method, active regions are isolated by applying a voltage of 0V to a field shield gate electrode of an nMOS field effect transistor forming region so that current will not flow to n+ layers on both sides of the field shield gate electrode.

      A p type contact region 112 is provided in active region 104 of the nMOS field effect transistor, and an n type contact region 114 is provided in active region 106 of the pMOS field effect transistor.

      However, in this embodiment, a structure is shown in which these regions are isolated with a mesa isolation method.

    <p num="92">
      Referring to FIG. 41, description will be given of the characteristics of a semiconductor device in the structure of the above-described embodiments 6 to 9.
      <br/>
      In order to evaluate the characteristics, 53-stage CMOS ring oscillators are formed on a thin film SOI substrate and a bulk silicon substrate, and the delay times thereof are compared.
      <br/>
      The structure of isolation of the ring oscillator formed on the thin film SOI substrate includes a field shield isolation structure in which the potential of a channel region is fixed, and a field isolation structure in which the potential of a channel region is in a floating state.
    </p>
    <p num="93">
      These structures were compared with a field shield isolation structure of the ring oscillator formed on the bulk silicon substrate.
      <br/>
      In FIG. 41, the abscissa shows consumed power rated by oscillating frequency.
      <br/>
      The voltage is in the range of 2V to 5V.
      <br/>
      In this range of voltage, the delay time of the ring oscillator formed on the bulk silicon substrate is substantially larger than that formed on the thin film SOI layer.
      <br/>
      This is because the parasitic capacitance (junction capacitance) of the source/drain region is smaller in the ring oscillator formed on the thin film SOI substrate than in the ring oscillator formed on the bulk silicon substrate.
    </p>
    <p num="94">
      Referring to FIG. 42, description will be given of the relationship between the power supply voltage and power consumed by the ring oscillators in the structure similar to the case of FIG. 41. As is the case of FIG. 41, power consumed by the ring oscillator formed on the bulk silicon substrate is substantially larger than that of the ring oscillator formed on the thin film SOI substrate.
      <br/>
      As to power consumption of the ring oscillators formed on the thin film SOI substrate having a field shield isolation structure and a field isolation structure, respectively, when the power supply voltage is low (2-3V), there is no difference in power consumption between the oscillators.
      <br/>
      However, when the power supply voltage is high (4-5V), power consumption of the ring oscillator having the field isolation structure becomes larger than that of the ring oscillator formed on the bulk silicon substrate.
      <br/>
      The characteristic of low power consumption, which the SOI substrate structure originally has, cannot be obtained.
    </p>
    <p num="95">
      This is caused by decrease of the breakdown voltage between source and drain by parasitic bipolar operation, as described above.
      <br/>
      By fixing the substrate potential in the field shield isolation structure, attracting holes stored in the channel region, and improving the breakdown voltage between source and drain, the ring oscillator formed on the SOI substrate can implement power consumption lower than that of the ring oscillator formed on the bulk silicon substrate for the power supply voltage up to 5V.
    </p>
    <p num="96">
      As described above, in the semiconductor device in which the substrate potential is fixed, it is possible to maintain the characteristic of the SOI structure, and to prevent lowering of the breakdown voltage between source and drain, which was the largest shortcoming of the MOS field effect transistor formed on the SOI substrate.
      <br/>
      Even under the high power supply voltage, a circuit formed on the SOI substrate can implement circuit operation similar to a circuit formed on the bulk silicon substrate.

      However, there is a case where holes are generated by impact ionization in the channel in the transistor forming region.
      <br/>
      In order to prevent generation of holes, it is possible to cover the surroundings of field shield gate electrodes 222, 224 with p type impurities to fix field shield gate electrodes 222, 224 to the ground potential, as shown in FIG. 71.

      Description will now be given of the twentieth embodiment of the present invention with reference to FIGS. 72 to 74. As described with respect to the nineteenth embodiment, holes are generated by impact ionization in the channel.
      <br/>
      Therefore, only the breakdown voltage between source and drain of the nMOS field effect transistor has to be taken into consideration.
      <br/>
      In order to improve the breakdown voltage between source and drain of the nMOS field effect transistor, a region of an impurity concentration higher than that of the p type channel portion is formed in the channel portion in the vicinity of the source region, thereby preventing implantation of electrons from the source region.

    <p num="125">
      Referring to FIG. 72, source region 240 and drain region 242 are formed on both sides of gate electrode 246.
      <br/>
      A region 252 of a p type impurity concentration higher than that of channel region 244 in the vicinity of source region 240 is formed on one side of channel region 244 under gate electrode 246.
      <br/>
      Referring to FIG. 74, a field shield isolation region 254 is formed in the surroundings of gate electrode 246.

      Referring again to FIG. 72, description will now be given of a method of manufacturing the nMOS field effect transistor shown in FIG. 72. After field isolation of the SOI layer, p type impurities such as boron are implanted into the entire surface of the SOI layer in an implantation amount of approximately 1 * 1012 cm-2, to form a gate electrode.
      <br/>
      Boron in an amount of approximately 1 * 1013 cm-2 is additionally implanted in one direction.
      <br/>
      By forming an ordinary source/drain region, the transistor is completed.
      <br/>
      As shown in FIGS. 72 and 73, channel region 252 higher in an impurity concentration than channel region 244 is formed in channel region 244 in the vicinity of source region 240.

      By forming such an impurity profile, holes generated by impact ionization in channel region 244 in the vicinity of drain region 242 flow to source region 240.

      Since channel region 252 of a high concentration is provided, a potential barrier with respect to source region 240 is high.
      <br/>
      As a result, holes are less likely to enter source region 240, suppressing implantation of electrons from source region 240.
