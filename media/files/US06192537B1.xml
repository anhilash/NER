      <br/>
      A semi-fluid based body support system using a mass of granular material to support a user has reversible transferring means and fluidizing means to locally control the granular material.
      <br/>
      The reversible transferring means and fluidizing means are independently controlled at plural locations along a system longitudinal dimension so that each region of the user body may be independently accommodated.
      <br/>
      The reversible transferring means is used to achieve fitness for natural posture by controlling a distribution of the accumulative height of granular material, and transfers the granular material between a transverse middle portion and transverse side portions of the system reversibly.
      <br/>
      The fluidizing means is used to achieve reduced partial oppression by controlling a local fluidity of the granular material.
      <br/>
      In a preferred embodiment, rotary blade devices, placed at spaced locations along the system longitudinal dimension, implement the fluidizing and transferring means by switching between operational modes.
      <br/>
      The rotary blade devices each include a shaft with blades that is rotatable reversibly.
      <br/>
      A shaft axis of rotation is oriented at an angle in the approximate range of 60° to 120° relative to a system longitudinal axis.
      <br/>
      The blades extend over a zone on the shaft, wherein: the length of the zone is larger than 25% of a system transverse dimension; and the zone is located within a complementary half of the system transverse dimension.
      <br/>
      Blades located within the same zone have the same screw direction.
      <br/>
      Blades located within mutually opposite transverse halves of the system have opposite screw directions.

    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="4">
      This invention in general relates to a bed system.
      <br/>
      More particularly, this invention relates to a user support system for a bed, such as a mattress, which uses fluidizable granular material to support the user thereon.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      The quality of sleep is generally influenced by the features of the mattress.
      <br/>
      The characteristics of a mattress affect the health of the user during the course of long time intervals.
      <br/>
      Important characteristics of the mattress can be considered to include reduced partial oppression, fitness for natural posture, stability in holding the user and potential for good ventilation.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      In ordinary homes, water mattresses, air mattresses and gel mattresses are widely known as mattresses having a soft feel.
      <br/>
      Although these mattresses are simple in structure and are moderate in price, they have some problems which need to be overcome.
      <br/>
      These problems include several of:
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      (a) partial oppression caused by the tension of a sealed container holding the fluid;
      <br/>
      (b) deterioration of supported posture, caused by a difference in weight (or specific gravity) of regions of the body;
      <br/>
      (c) low stability in holding the body, resulting from high fluidity of the fluid;
      <br/>
      (d) lack of ventilation, due to the use of the sealed container; and
      <br/>
      (e) thermal disharmony caused by a large thermal capacity of a mass of water.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      In the medical fields, fluidized beds are used for supporting the patient with little partial oppression.
      <br/>
      There are some problems associated with using fluidized beds in the home, including several of:
      <br/>
      (a) extra weight relating to buoyancy of the fluidized granular material;
      <br/>
      (b) extra energy consumed for thermal conditioning of the pressurized air;
      <br/>
      (c) deterioration of supported posture, caused by a difference in weight (or specific gravity) of regions of the body; and
      <br/>
      (d) unstable controllability in fluidizing the granular material, relating to the aerodynamics.
    </p>
    <p num="9">With respect to fluidized beds, the Goodwin patent (U.S. Pat. No. 4,637,083) discloses a fluidized patient support apparatus, the Eady patent (U.S. Pat. No. 4,951,335) discloses a mattress assembly, the Smith patent (U.S. Pat. No. 4,686,723) discloses a semi-fluidized bed, the Kato patent (U.S. Pat.

    <heading>BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="10">It is an object of the present invention to provide a semi-fluid based body support system having reduced partial oppression, fitness for natural posture, stability in holding the user, potential for good ventilation and moderate (or relative) balance.</p>
    <p num="11">It is another object of the present invention to provide a semi-fluid based body support system including relatively simple machinery which is suitable for the fine and firm control of the granular material and is also suitable for a home bed with a shallow and wide structure.</p>
    <p num="12">It is another object of the present invention to provide a semi-fluid based body support system having reduced weight.</p>
    <p num="13">
      The semi-fluid based body support system of this invention is suitable for a mattress and a bed.
      <br/>
      The semi-fluid based body support system is applicable to mattresses and beds in the medical fields where it is required to support a patient in reduced partial oppression.
      <br/>
      The patient or nurse can adjust this semi-fluid based body support system to fit the natural posture of the patient attained during sleep.
      <br/>
      This semi-fluid based body support system does not need the flow of pressurized air, so it is relatively easy to keep a bed warm.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, the mechanism of this semi-fluid based body support system can be embodied in a shallow and wide structure which is often used in a home bed.
      <br/>
      Therefore, this semi-fluid based body support system is especially suitable for a home mattress and a home bed in everyday life.
      <br/>
      Since this semi-fluid based body support system solves, to some extent, a conflict between reduced partial oppression and fitness for natural posture, this system has the potential of improving the quality of sleep in the home mattress and the home bed.
    </p>
    <p num="14">The semi-fluid based body support system of this invention is also suitable for production using automatic machine tools because the main machinery of this system can be embodied by repetitions of relatively simple apparatus, such as a rotary blade device.</p>
    <p num="15">The semi-fluid based body support system of this invention also gives a benefit of motive power to sleep because it can really apply powerful machinery to a mattress and a bed.</p>
    <p num="16">Other features and advantages of this invention will be apparent from the detailed description of the invention, and from the claims.</p>

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="18">
      FIGS. 1 through 11 illustrate the first preferred embodiment of a semi-fluid based body support system of this invention.
      <br/>
      The semi-fluid based body support system of this embodiment comprises a frame 33a-33b having a floor 39 and a wall 40a-40b, a mass of granular material 30 held (or disposed) in the frame 33a-33b, means for fluidizing the granular material 31a-31b and means for transferring the granular material 31a-31b, as illustrated in FIGS. 1, 2 and 3.
      <br/>
      The user is supported on the granular material 31a-31b through an air permeable sheet 34 which is connected to the wall 40a-40b of the frame 33a-33b.
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      The frame 33a-33b is composed of a base frame 33a and a cushion frame 33b.
      <br/>
      The base frame 33a holds the machinery and fixes the hem of the air permeable sheet 34.
      <br/>
      The machinery is mainly composed of rotary blade devices 32a-32w, which are discussed below, and related components.
      <br/>
      The machinery drives the granular material 31a-31b finely and firmly to assist the user in obtaining an appropriate support condition in each region of his body.

      Usually, the user is supported in a middle portion of the frame.
      <br/>
      Therefore, generally, the term "transverse middle portion of the frame" as used herein is intended to represent a portion of the frame 33a-33b, wherein: a transverse dimension (i.e. a dimension measured in a transverse direction of the frame 33a-33b) of the portion is from 10% to 50%, preferably 20% to 40%, of the transverse dimension 59 of the frame 33a-33b; and the transverse center (i.e. a center measured in a transverse direction of the frame 33a-33b) of the portion is identical with the transverse center of the frame 33a-33b.

    <p num="53">Reduced Partial Oppression</p>
    <p num="54">To reduce the partial oppression, the semi-fluid based body support system of this embodiment operates the rotary blade devices 32a-32w in a fluidizing mode as called herein so that the impeller members 44a-44g and 45a-45g may rotate alternately clockwise and counterclockwise as shown by an arrow 65, as illustrated in FIGS. 6 and 8A. The granular material 31e and 31f around the impeller members 44a-44g and 45a-45g is shaken (or stirred) as shown schematically by arrows 66a and 66b and gets local fluidity depending on the output power of the driving motor 41.</p>
    <p num="55">
      As illustrated in FIG. 9A, if the user (head 71a, shoulder 71b, waist 71c, hip 71d, and leg 71e) feels the partial oppression at his leg region 71e in a current support condition 72, the user operates rotary blade devices 32o-32t, which correspond to leg region 71e, in the fluidizing mode.
      <br/>
      The driven granular material 31k and 31L in an area 74 around the rotary blade devices 32o-32t flows (or drifts) locally, like a fluid, in the semi-fluid based body support system of this embodiment, and the shape of this semi-fluid based body support system contacting the body changes to a new shape with reduced partial oppression at that area 74, due to the characteristics of the fluid.
      <br/>
      Thus, the user obtains a new support condition 73 with reduced partial oppression at the leg region 71e.
    </p>
    <p num="56">
      Within a period of the above operation, the granular material still remains in a stationary state at the surrounding area 75a and 75b of the other rotary blade devices 32a-32n and 32u-32w which are stationary or stopped.
      <br/>
      In the stationary state, since a mass of granular material 30 can support a load steadily in the shape presented, the other regions 71a-71d of the body continue to be supported steadily on the granular material while the above operation continues.
    </p>
    <p num="57">
      When the user gains a feeling of satisfaction about the partial oppression, the user stops all of the rotary blade devices 32a-32w.
      <br/>
      The semi-fluid based body support system of this embodiment thereafter supports the user steadily in the shape presented at the time of disabling the rotary blade devices.
      <br/>
      Thus, the semi-fluid based body support system of this embodiment can continue to support the body steadily in reduced partial oppression, if this semi-fluid based body support system has such a shape corresponding to reduced partial oppression, obtained through above-mentioned operation.
    </p>
    <p num="58">Fitness for Natural Posture</p>
    <p num="59">To fit the semi-fluid based body support system of this embodiment to the natural posture of the user, the semi-fluid based body support system of this embodiment operates the rotary blade devices 32a-32w in a transferring mode as called herein so that the impeller members 44a-44g and 45a-45g may rotate in a certain direction as shown by an arrow 67 or 69, as illustrated in FIGS. 8B and 8C. Because of a difference in weight (or specific gravity) of regions of the body, the user tends to have an unnatural posture when lying on a fluid or fluidized bed.</p>
    <p num="60">
      To compensate for deterioration of the posture, it is important to adjust a supporting height 52 for each region 51 of the body.
      <br/>
      As illustrated in FIG. 5, in the semi-fluid based body support system of this embodiment, the adjustment of the supporting height 52 is achieved by transferring the granular material 31 a between a transverse middle portion 54 and transverse side portions 55a and 55b of the frame 33a-33b.
    </p>
    <p num="61">Since each of the rotary blade devices 32a-32w has the left-handed impeller members 44a-44g located within the left zone 56 and the right-handed impeller members 45a-45g located within the right zone 57 as illustrated in FIGS. 5, 6 and 8C, the granular material 31i and 31j around the impeller members 44a-44g and 45a-45g is transferred from the transverse middle portion 54 to the transverse side portions 55a and 55b of the frame 33a-33b as shown schematically by arrows 70a and 70b when the impeller members 44a-44g and 45a-45g rotate clockwise viewing from the driving motor 41 as shown by an arrow 69.</p>
    <p num="62">By contrast, when the impeller members 44a-44g and 45a-45g rotate counterclockwise viewing from the driving motor 41 as shown by arrow 67 as illustrated in FIGS. 6 and 8B, the granular material 31g and 31h around the impeller members 44a-44g and 45a-45g is transferred from the transverse side portions 55a and 55b to the transverse middle portion 54 of the frame 33a-33b as shown schematically by arrows 68a and 68b.</p>
    <p num="63">The above-mentioned transferring of the granular material makes it possible to adjust the distribution of an accumulative height 53 of the granular material in the transverse middle portion 54 of the frame 33a-33b.</p>
    <p num="64">
      By independently controlling the rotary blade devices 32a-32w which are located along the longitudinal dimension 50 of the frame 33a-33b, it becomes possible to adjust a distribution of the accumulative height 53 of the granular material along the longitudinal dimension 50 of the frame 33a-33b at the transverse middle portion 54 of the frame 33a-33b.
      <br/>
      Since the transverse middle portion 54 of the frame 33a-33b generally corresponds to an area for supporting the user thereon, the above-mentioned adjustment of the granular material corresponds to an adjustment of the supporting height 52 in each region 51 of the body.
    </p>
    <p num="65">If the user feels something wrong, in the current posture 81 or 85, about the supporting height in his hip region 71d, the user operates a part of the rotary blade devices 32L corresponding to the hip region 71d in the transferring mode, as illustrated in FIGS. 10A, 10B and 9B.</p>
    <p num="66">FIG. 10A illustrates a case of lifting the hip region 71d from the current supporting height 82 to new supporting height 83 by transferring the granular material 31n and 31o from the transverse side portions 55a and 55b to the transverse middle portion 54 of the frame 33a-33b, as shown schematically by arrows 84a and 84b, by rotating the impeller members 44a-44g and 45a-45g of the rotary blade device 32L counterclockwise as shown by an arrow 67.</p>
    <p num="67">FIG. 10B illustrates a case of sinking down (or lowering) the hip region 71d from the current supporting height 86 to new supporting height 87 by transferring the granular material 31p and 31q from the transverse middle portion 54 to the transverse side portions 55a and 55b of the frame 33a-33b, as shown schematically by arrows 88a and 88b, by rotating the impeller members 44a-44g and 45a-45g of the rotary blade device 32L clockwise as shown by an arrow 69.</p>
    <p num="68">Thus, by applying the above-mentioned operation to each region of the body, the semi-fluid based body support system of this embodiment obtains fitness for natural posture.</p>
    <p num="69">Light Granular Material</p>
    <p num="70">
      In order to reduce the weight of the semi-fluid based body support system of this embodiment, it is appropriate to use light granular material.
      <br/>
      If the light granular material is used, the user tends to sink in this semi-fluid based body support system when the granular material is fluidized widely because the buoyancy operating on the body is insufficient to support the body.
    </p>
    <p num="71">
      A scanning control method, as called herein, of the rotary blade devices 32a-32w provides a narrow fluidized area of the granular material and a wide stationary area of the granular material before and behind the narrow fluidized area.
      <br/>
      The control method scans the narrow fluidized area along the body while supporting the user steadily on the wide stationary area.
    </p>
    <p num="72">
      As illustrated in FIG. 9B, if the user feels the partial oppression at all regions 71a-71e in the current support condition 76, the user needs to operate rotary blade devices 32c-32t corresponding to regions 71a-71e, in the fluidizing mode.
      <br/>
      In this case, if all of the above rotary blade devices 32c-32t are operated at a time, it is inevitable that the user suffers severe deterioration of posture caused by sinking of the whole body into the light granular material.
    </p>
    <p num="73">
      Accordingly, the user operates the required rotary blade devices 32c-32t one by one in turn, as shown by an arrow 80.
      <br/>
      In a narrow fluidized area 78 corresponding to the rotary blade device 32L which is operated currently, the shape of the semi-fluid based body support system of this embodiment changes to a new shape with reduced partial oppression by the flow of the granular material.
      <br/>
      Also, in the wide stationary areas 79a and 79b corresponding to the rotary blade devices 32a-32k and 32m-32w which are paused currently, the other regions of the body are supported steadily on the granular material.
      <br/>
      By scanning the narrow fluidized area 78 along all regions, the user obtains reduced partial oppression on the whole body at new support condition 77 without suffering severe deterioration of the posture.
    </p>
    <p num="74">By applying the scanning control method of the rotary blade devices 32a-32w to the operations in the fluidizing mode and in the transferring mode, the semi-fluid based body support system of this embodiment provides the user with a totally desirable effect on all of the regions while preventing the body from over sinking, even if a light granular material is used.</p>
    <p num="75">
      In the case of using a light granular material, preferably, the rotary blade devices should be rotated intermittently (or with periodical pulsed driving), especially when transferring the granular material.
      <br/>
      By the intermittent rotation of the rotary blade devices, the shortage of buoyancy is compensated to some extent due to the inertia of the body and granular material and some stability in an arrangement of a mass of granular material 30.
      <br/>
      In addition, the scanning control method of the rotary blade devices is also applicable to the case of using heavy granular material.
    </p>
    <p num="76">Mixture of Operation</p>
    <p num="77">
      In the above description, the operation for obtaining reduced partial oppression and the operation for obtaining fitness for natural posture are explained separately.
      <br/>
      But it is important to simultaneously apply these operations to the rotary blade devices 32a-32w to obtain reduced partial oppression and fitness for natural posture, moderately balanced.
      <br/>
      Preferably, these operations should be applied to each region of the body jointly, repeatedly and little by little, using an unbalanced rotation of the rotary blade devices 32a-32w, such as turning twice clockwise after turning once counterclockwise.
      <br/>
      The above unbalanced rotation of the rotary blade devices 32a-32w has a mixed effect on the operations of fluidizing and transferring the granular material.
      <br/>
      Thus, the user obtains reduced partial oppression and fitness for natural posture.
    </p>
    <p num="78">Installation to Bed</p>
    <p num="79">
      The semi-fluid based body support system of this embodiment can be installed in a bed so as to be separable or inseparable from the bed.
      <br/>
      FIG. 11 illustrates a bed mainly composed of the semi-fluid based body support system of this embodiment, a power control unit 89, a power line 90 and legs 91.
      <br/>
      The power control unit 89 is connected to the power line 90 and drives the rotary blade devices 32a-32w under the control of the user, preferably through some kind of remote control apparatus.
      <br/>
      The power control unit 89 can be composed mainly of an electronic circuit and heat sinks.
      <br/>
      In this case, the semi-fluid based body support system of this embodiment can have the power control unit 89 built-in by installing the heat sinks, for example, in the bottom face of the floor 39 of the frame 33a-33b.
    </p>
    <p num="80">Channel Structure</p>
    <p num="81">
      FIGS. 12 through 15 illustrate the second preferred embodiment of a semi-fluid based body support system of this invention.
      <br/>
      This embodiment further comprises a channel structure (or groove structure) in addition to being constructed like the first preferred embodiment, in order to localize the function area of the rotary blade devices 32a-32w and to strengthen the mechanical structure.
      <br/>
      The channel structure is composed of channels 100a-100w generally arranged in parallel.
      <br/>
      The term "channel" as used herein is intended to represent a linear area of relatively deep portions.
    </p>
    <p num="82">
      The floor 39 of the frame 33a-33b has channels 100a-100w formed on a top face of the floor 39, as illustrated in FIGS. 12 and 13. The channel 100a houses (or receives) the corresponding rotary blade device 32a at least partially.
      <br/>
      Thus the channel 100a is oriented at an angle in the approximate range of 60 (degree)  to 120 (degree)  relative to the longitudinal axis 37 of the frame 33a-33b, and the channels 100a-100w are located, preferably arranged, along the longitudinal dimension 50 of the frame 33a-33b.
      <br/>
      The shaft member 42 of the rotary blade device 32a is rotatable on the axis of rotation 43 generally parallel to the corresponding channel 100a.
    </p>
    <p num="83">
      Preferably, every channel 100a-100w should support the safety net member 35 to improve the strength of the safety net member 35.
      <br/>
      By connecting the safety net member 35 to the walls 101u and 101v of the channel 100v, it is possible to release the load on the safety net member 35 and it also becomes easy to cover the blade member of the rotary blade device 32v by the safety net member 35 to protect the user.
    </p>
    <p num="84">
      Preferably, the vertical depth 170a, 170b and 170c of the channels 100c, 100x and 100y should be equal to or greater than an external radius of rotation 103R (i.e. half of the external diameter, shown with a circle 103) of the blade member of the impeller members 44g of the rotary blade devices 32c, as illustrated in FIGS. 14A, 14B, 14C and 14D.
      <br/>
      Since the wall 101a of the channel 100a controls the longitudinal moving of the granular material 31r toward the next channel 100b as illustrated in FIG. 13, the function area of the rotary blade device 32a is localized, so that the independent controllability in each region of the body is improved.
    </p>
    <p num="85">
      The height of the walls 101a-101v and 101x-101z of the channels can vary severally depending on the characteristics of the granular material and/or on the regions of the body, as illustrated in FIGS. 13, 14A and 14B.
      <br/>
      Also, two or more rotary blade devices 32c and 32d can be placed in the same channel 100x, as illustrated in FIG. 14B. As illustrated in FIG. 14C, the function areas of the adjoining rotary blade devices 32c and 32d placed in the same channel 100y can overlap with each other by shifting the mounting positions of the impeller members on the shaft member 42.
    </p>
    <p num="86">
      As illustrated in FIG. 14D, in order to support the rotary blade device 32c when the shaft member 42 is deflected by a lateral load, preferably, the inner surface of the channel 100c should share the lateral load like a bearing for the impeller member 44g.
      <br/>
      Therefore, preferably, the radius of curvature 102R (i.e. half of the core diameter, shown with a circle 102) of the inner surface of the channel 100c should be substantially equal to an external radius of rotation 103R of the impeller members 44a-44g and 45a-45g at least in its bottom portion.
      <br/>
      Normally, the rotary blade device 32c is apart from the inner surface of the channel 100c.
      <br/>
      They contact when the shaft member 42 is deflected, and the inner surface of the channel 100c supports the rotary blade device 32c.
      <br/>
      Lateral load is also supportable by using ordinary bearings for extra support of the shaft member 42.
    </p>
    <p num="87">
      A direction of a channel can be curved or bent, if necessary.
      <br/>
      In the curved channel, divided shaft members, flexible joints and extra bearings for the shaft member are available for the rotary blade device.
    </p>
    <p num="88">
      As illustrated in FIG. 15, the channel structure having channels 100b-100e can be also formed by partitions 104a-104e supported in the frame 33a-33b.
      <br/>
      The partition 104a functions like the wall 101a of channels 100a and 100b.
      <br/>
      The partitions 104a-104e are fixed to the floor 39 of the frame 33a-33b by the bolts 105.
    </p>
    <p num="89">
      The partition 104b is located between the adjoining rotary blade devices 32b and 32c.
      <br/>
      Thus, the partitions 104a-104e are oriented at an angle in the approximate range of 60 (degree)  to 120 (degree)  relative to the longitudinal axis 37 of the frame 33a-33b and are located, preferably arranged, along the longitudinal dimension 50 of the frame 33a-33b.
      <br/>
      The shaft member 42 of the rotary blade device 32a is rotatable on the axis of rotation 43 generally parallel to the direction of the corresponding partition 104b.
      <br/>
      The partition 104d can have holes, if necessary.
    </p>
    <p num="90">
      Preferably, the vertical height of the partition 104b should be equal to or greater than an external radius of rotation 103R of the blade member of the impeller members 44a-44g and 45a-45g.
      <br/>
      The vertical height of the partition 104b, as used herein, is defined as a height of the top of the partition 104b measured from the bottom of the impeller members of the rotary blade devices 32b and 32c.
    </p>
    <p num="91">Cell Structure</p>
    <p num="92">
      FIGS. 16 through 18 illustrate the third preferred embodiment of a semi-fluid based body support system of this invention.
      <br/>
      This embodiment comprises a cell structure in addition to being constructed like the second preferred embodiment, to lessen the trouble in making a bed (e.g., provide a more rapid adjustment of the system to the user) and to improve the feel of this semi-fluid based body support system.
      <br/>
      The cell structure is composed of cells 110a-110d arranged in the frame 33a-33b longitudinally.
    </p>
    <p num="93">
      As illustrated in FIGS. 17A and 17B, the frame 33a-33b and the air permeable sheet 34 are further connected to the wall 101e of the channel 100e and define a cell 110a surrounded thereby.
      <br/>
      Each of the cells 110a-110d holds a part of a mass of granular material 30.
      <br/>
      Since a longitudinal migration (or drift) of the granular material 31s is restricted to inside of the cell 110a, it lessens the trouble in making a bed (e.g., the system may be rapidly adjusted to a user) which is usually required in the advance of medical preparations or in the turning of the body.
      <br/>
      The characteristics of the granular material held in each of the cells 110a-110d can vary severally to improve the feel of this semi-fluid based body support system.
    </p>
    <p num="94">
      As illustrated in FIG. 18, the partitions 104a-104e supported in the frame 33a-33b can be used for the cell structure.
      <br/>
      In this case, the frame 33a-33b and the air permeable sheet 34 are connected to the partitions 104b and 104d and define a cell 110g surrounded thereby.
      <br/>
      Each of the cells 110e-110h holds a part of a mass of granular material 30.
      <br/>
      One or more rotary blade devices 32c and 32d can be placed within the cell 110g.
      <br/>
      Also, the adjoining cells 110g and 110h can be connected through the holes of the partition 104d.
    </p>
    <p num="95">Single-Ended Rotary Blade Device</p>
    <p num="96">
      FIGS. 19A and 19B illustrate the fourth preferred embodiment of a semi-fluid based body support system of this invention.
      <br/>
      This embodiment comprises single-ended rotary blade devices 115a and 115b instead of the rotary blade devices 32a-32w of the first preferred embodiment.
    </p>
    <p num="97">
      Each of the single-ended rotary blade devices 115a and 115b includes a shaft member 117 and right-handed impeller members 118a-118g connected to the shaft member 117, as illustrated in FIG. 19B. The driving motor 116 is connected to the shaft member 117 so as to rotate the right-handed impeller members 118a-118g clockwise, counterclockwise, and alternately clockwise and counterclockwise.
      <br/>
      Operation of each of the single-ended rotary blade devices 115a and 115b is independently controlled, by the user, including the following operations: starting, stopping, direction of rotation and, preferably, speed of revolution.
      <br/>
      The single-ended rotary blade devices 115a and 115b are installed in the frame 33a so that an axis of rotation 119a and 119b of the shaft member 117 may be oriented at an angle in the approximate range of 60 (degree)  to 120 (degree)  relative to a longitudinal axis 37 of the frame 33a.
      <br/>
      Preferably, the single-ended rotary blade devices 115a and 115b face each other and should be used as a pair.
    </p>
    <p num="98">The vertical directions of the axes of rotation 119a and 119b of the single-ended rotary blade devices 115a and 115b can vary with each other, as illustrated in FIG. 19A. Also, the horizontal directions of the axes of rotation 119a and 119b of the single-ended rotary blade devices 115a and 115b can vary with each other.</p>
    <p num="99">
      The operations of the single-ended rotary blade devices 115a and 115b are similar to those of the rotary blade devices 32a-32w in the first preferred embodiment.
      <br/>
      For example, clockwise rotation of the rotary blade devices 32a-32w in the first preferred embodiment corresponds to the same clockwise rotation of the single-ended rotary blade devices 115a and 115b.
      <br/>
      Each of the rotary blade devices 32a-32w in the first preferred embodiment include left-handed impeller members 44a-44g located within the left zone 56 and right-handed impeller members 45a-45g located within the right zone 57, while the single-ended rotary blade devices 115a and 115b include right-handed impeller members 118a-118g located within left zone 56 and right zone 57, respectively.
      <br/>
      The user can improve the handling of this semi-fluid based body support system by driving each of the single-ended rotary blade devices 115a and 115b independently.
    </p>
    <p num="100">
      A pair of the single-ended rotary blade devices 115a and 115b, facing each other transversely, can be connected by a flexible joint and be driven by a common driving motor, if the screw directions of their impeller members (i.e. screw direction in left zone 56 and screw direction in right zone 57) are opposite each other.
      <br/>
      The rotary blade devices 32a-32w of the first preferred embodiment can be divided into three or more pieces, if necessary.
    </p>
    <p num="101">Blade and Guide</p>
    <p num="102">
      FIGS. 20A, 20B, 20C and 21 illustrate the other preferred embodiments of the rotary blade device and related components.
      <br/>
      Although the rotary blade devices 32a-32w are applied to both of the fluidizing means and the transferring means, each blade member of the rotary blade devices 32a-32w can have a biased feature suitable for either fluidizing means or transferring means.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the blade shape, blade area, blade angle, blade inclination, blade eccentricity and blade linkage can vary in every blade member.
    </p>
    <p num="103">FIG. 20A illustrates a rotary blade device 120 having left-handed inclined impeller members 121a-121e and right-handed inclined impeller members 122a-122e so as to have mixed effects in fluidizing and transferring the granular material 31a-31b.</p>
    <p num="104">FIG. 20B illustrates a rotary blade device 123 having left-handed inclined and eccentric sole blade members 124a-124f and right-handed inclined and eccentric sole blade members 125a-125f so as to strengthen the effect in fluidizing the granular material 31a-31b.</p>
    <p num="105">
      FIG. 20C illustrates a rotary blade device 126 having left-handed impeller members 127a-127g and right-handed impeller members 128a-128g, wherein the blade angle of the inner impeller member 127e (i.e. impeller member located at an inner position on the shaft member 42) is larger than the blade angle of the outer impeller member 127d.
      <br/>
      The transportable quantity 129b of the inner impeller member 127e with a relatively large blade angle is larger than the transportable quantity 129a of the outer impeller member 127d with a relatively small blade angle.
      <br/>
      Thus, distributions of quantities of the granular material carried out or carried in within the transverse side portions 55a and 55b of the frame 33a-33b can be made relatively uniform due to the movement of granular material pushed out from, or drawn into, the array of the impeller members 127a-127g and 128a-128g, as shown by arrows 130.
    </p>
    <p num="106">
      A particularly shaped blade member partially including the above-mentioned features is available, if necessary.
      <br/>
      An example of such a particularly shaped blade member is a screw-like transferring blade partially having a kneading blade thereon.
      <br/>
      FIG. 20D illustrates a rotary blade device 131 having a continuous screw blade member 132 as a simple example of the particularly shaped blade member.
    </p>
    <p num="107">As illustrated in FIG. 21, preferably, a guide slope 133 should be used in the transverse center of the frame 33a-33b, to assist the function of the blade members.</p>
    <p num="108">Mirror Symmetrical Arrangement</p>
    <p num="109">
      FIGS. 22, 23A, 23B and 24 illustrate another preferred embodiment of arrangements of the rotary blade devices and its blade members.
      <br/>
      If many rotary blade devices 140a-140c and 141a-141c rotate in the same direction, the granular material 31t located above the channel 100b tends to migrate (or drift) in a longitudinal direction 37x of the frame 33a-33b because the granular material 31t is pushed in that direction 37x continuously by the blade members 142 and 143, as illustrated in FIG. 22.
    </p>
    <p num="110">
      To compensate for the above migration, the adjoining rotary blade devices 140a and 141a have substantially mirror symmetrical screw directions with each other in the longitudinal direction 37x of the frame 33a-33b, in an arrangement of their blade members 142 and 143.
      <br/>
      These adjoining longitudinally mirror symmetrical rotary blade devices 140a and 141a as called herein can be placed in the same channel as a pair of rotary blade devices, as similarly illustrated in FIG. 14B.
    </p>
    <p num="111">
      As illustrated in FIG. 23A, when the adjoining longitudinally mirror symmetrical rotary blade devices 140a and 141a transfer the granular material 31t from the transverse middle portion 54 to the transverse side portion 55b of the frame 33a-33b (or reversibly) as shown by arrows 145a and 145b, these adjoining rotary blade devices 140a and 141a rotate in opposite directions with each other as shown by arrows 69 and 67.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the longitudinal migration of the granular material 31t is canceled to some extent as shown by arrows 146a and 146b.
    </p>
    <p num="112">By contrast, when the adjoining longitudinally mirror symmetrical rotary blade devices 140a and 141a rotate in the same direction as shown by an arrow 69, the granular material 31t circulates relatively transversely as shown by arrows 145a and 145c and migrates longitudinally as shown by arrows 146a and 146c as illustrated in FIG. 23B. In this case, the longitudinal migration of the granular material 31t is intensified.</p>
    <p num="113">Canceling or intensifying of the longitudinal migration of the granular material lessens further the trouble in making a bed (e.g., accelerates the rate of adjustment of the system to a user).</p>
    <p num="114">
      FIG. 24 illustrates adjoining longitudinally mirror symmetrical rotary blade devices 150 and 151, wherein the blade angle of the inner impeller member of these rotary blade devices 150 and 151 is larger than the blade angle of the outer impeller member of these devices, as similarly illustrated in FIG. 20C. When these rotary blade devices 150 and 151 are rotated in the same direction as shown by an arrow 67, the granular material 31u tends to swirl between the adjoining rotary blade devices 150 and 151 as shown by arrows 154a-154d and 155 since the transportable quantity of the blade members 153a and 153b are different.
      <br/>
      Thus, the effect in fluidizing the granular material is improved.
    </p>
    <p num="115">Granular Material</p>
    <p num="116">
      Preferably, the granular material should have low specific heat and low thermal conductivity to reduce the thermal disharmony.
      <br/>
      Preferably, the granular material should have sizes ranging from 1 millimeter (mm) to 3 millimeters (mm) to provide the strength, feel and ventilation.
      <br/>
      Preferably, the granular material should be hard and slippery.
      <br/>
      Preferably, the granular material should have a variety of shapes and sizes so that a mass of granular material 30 may have appropriate stability or instability in an arrangement thereof.
    </p>
    <p num="117">Furthermore, desirably, the granular material should have a little elasticity so as to follow slight movements of the user, such as breathing.</p>

      An air pump 160 having an intake port 162 and an outlet port 161 is installed in the frame 33a-33b, as illustrated in FIG. 25B. An inhaling duct 163 and an exhaling duct 164 are placed along the channel 100b, and are preferably formed within a wall 101b of the channel 100b.
      <br/>
      The inhaling duct 163 and the exhaling duct 164 are connected to the intake port 162 and the outlet port 161 of the air pump 160, respectively.

      The air permeable inhaling holes 166, 166a and 166b and the air permeable exhaling holes 165 are exposed to the granular material 31a respectively.

    <p num="122">To make the air currents 167a and 167b transversely circulate through the air permeable sheet 34 and the granular material 31a, the air permeable inhaling holes 166, 166a and 166b are located in the transverse side portions of the frame 33a-33b and the air permeable exhaling holes 165 are located in the transverse middle portion of the frame 33a-33b, as illustrated in FIG. 25B.</p>
    <p num="123">
      By driving the air pump 160, the user obtains good ventilation by the air currents 167a and 167b which circulate from the back of the user to both sides of this semi-fluid based body support system transversely.

      Instead of the air permeable sheet 34, an air impermeable sheet with an air permeable area in its middle portion is available to keep the air warm by suppressing air leakage from the sheet side portions while the air circulates.
