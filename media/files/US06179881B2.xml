      Azo compounds of the 2-(4-amino)phenyldiazinecarboximidamide type and 2-(4-amino)phenylhydrazinecarboximidamide type, a process for their synthesis, their use for dyeing keratin fibers, dye compositions containing them, and dyeing processes.

  </abstract>
  <description format="original" lang="en" id="desc_en">
    <p num="1">The present invention relates to novel azo compounds of the 2-(4-amino)phenyidiazinecarboximidamide type, to a process for their synthesis, to their use for dyeing keratin fibers, to dye compositions containing them and to dyeing processes using them.</p>
    <p num="2">
      It is well known that hair dye compositions use either oxidation dyes or direct dyes.
      <br/>
      The former dyes lead to shades with better covering power and better staying power, but they have the disadvantage of not being entirely harmless and of requiring an oxidation which is generally accompanied by appreciable degradation of the keratin fibers.
      <br/>
      In addition, their staying power and their affinity for the hair usually entails the appearance of the phenomenon of demarcation between dyed ends and half-lengths and undyed roots.
    </p>
    <p num="3">
      These problems do not arise in the case of direct dyes.
      <br/>
      The use of direct dyes has the further advantage over oxidation dye precursors of reducing the potential risks of allergy.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      Among the direct dyes most commonly used are nitrobenzene derivatives.
      <br/>
      However, these nitrobenzene dyes do not sufficiently withstand repeated washing.
      <br/>
      To overcome this flaw, attempts have been made to replace nitrobenzene dyes with aminoanthraquinone dyes or azo dyes.
      <br/>
      It has already been proposed, in particular in patent application FR-A-2,570,946, to use the azo dye of the following formula:  (Chemical Structure image '1' not included in text)
    </p>
    <p num="5">i.e. 4-amino-2'-methyl-4'-�N,N-bis(b-hydroxyethyl)amino�phenylazobenzene.</p>
    <p num="6">However, the use of this compound to dye the hair does not yield entirely satisfactory results, in particular, regarding the intensity of the colourings obtained.</p>
    <p num="7">The inventors have thus sought other azo dyes which have good solubility in a medium suitable for dyeing, such as water, water/alcohol mixtures and more generally common dye supports and which give, on keratin fibers, dyes with good resistance properties with respect to the various attacking factors to which keratin fibers may be subjected, and in particular with respect to washing, light, bad weather and perspiration.</p>
    <p num="8">Thus, following these investigations, the inventors have discovered azo compounds of the 2-(4-amino)phenyldiazinecarboximidamide type of formula (I) defined below.</p>
    <p num="9">This discovery forms the basis of the present invention.</p>
    <p num="10">The present invention is thus novel azo compounds of formula (I) below, and acid addition salts thereof:  (Chemical Structure image '2' not included in text)</p>
    <p num="11">in which:</p>
    <p num="12">
      R1 and R2, independently of each other, represent a hydrogen atom; a C1 -C6 alkyl radical; a 5- or 6-membered cycloalkyl radical; a 5- or 6-membered aromatic ring; a 5- or 6-membered aromatic ring substituted with a C1 -C6 alkyl radical, a halogen atom, an amino radical, a hydroxyl radical or a C1 -C6 alkoxy radical; or R1 and R2 form, together with the nitrogen atom to which they are attached, a 4- to 8-membered heterocycle, said heterocycle containing one or more hetero atoms chosen from sulfur, nitrogen and oxygen;
      <br/>
      R3 and R4, independently of each other, represent a hydrogen atom, a C1 -C6 alkyl radical, a C1 -C6 monohydroxyalkyl radical or a C2 -C6 polyhydroxyalkyl radical; and
      <br/>
      A is a 5- to 6-membered aromatic ring which can be interrupted by one or more hetero atoms chosen from sulfur, nitrogen and oxygen, or fused to another 5- to 6-membered aromatic ring.
    </p>
    <p num="13">
      When used to dye keratin fibers, the compounds of formula (I) in accordance with the invention have good solubility in water, in water/alcohol mixtures and more generally in common dye supports, and give colourings in a very intense coppery-orange shade which are particularly resistant to the various treatments to which the fibers may be subjected, such as washing, light, bad weather and perspiration.
      <br/>
      The coppery-orange colourings obtained using the compounds of formula (I) in accordance with the invention are, in particular, more intense than those obtained under the same conditions with 4-amino-2'-methyl-4'-�N,N'-bis(b-hydroxyethyl)amino�phenylazobenzene mentioned above.
    </p>
    <p num="14">In formula (I) above, the alkyl, monohydroxyalkyl and polyhydroxyalkyl radicals may be linear or branched.</p>
    <p num="15">Among the C1 -C6 alkyl radicals of the compounds of formula (I) above, preferred alkyl radicals are: methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, isopropyl, n-butyl, isobutyl, tert-butyl, n-pentyl, isopentyl, n-hexyl and isohexyl radicals.</p>
    <p num="16">Among the C1 -C6 monohydroxyalkyl radicals, preferred monohydroxyl radicals are: hydroxymethyl, hydroxyethyl, hydroxypropyl and hydroxybutyl radicals.</p>
    <p num="17">Among the C2 -C6 polyhydroxyalkyl radicals, preferred polyhydroxylalkyl radicals are: dihydroxyethyl, dihydroxypropyl, trihydroxypropyl and dihydroxybutyl radicals.</p>
    <p num="18">Among the cycloalkyl radicals which can be represented by the radicals R1 and R2, preferred cycloalkyl radicals are: cyclohexyl and cyclopentyl.</p>
    <p num="19">Among the aromatic rings which can be represented by the radicals R1 and R2, preferred aromatic rings are, for example, phenyl rings; phenyl rings substituted with a C1 -C6 alkyl radical, a halogen atom or an amino, hydroxyl or C1 -C6 alkoxy radical; benzyl, pyrimidine, pyridazine and benzimidazole rings.</p>
    <p num="20">Among the heterocycles which can be formed by the radicals R1 and R2 together, preferred heterocycles are: imidazole, benzotriazole, benzimidazole, pyrrolidine, piperidine and morpholine rings.</p>
    <p num="21">Among the rings which can be represented by the aromatic ring A, preferred rings are, for example, 6-membered rings such as phenyl, pyrimidine and pyridine rings, and 5-membered rings such as pyrrole and pyrazole rings.</p>
    <p num="22">The radicals R1, R2, R3 and R4, independently of each other, preferably represent a hydrogen atom or a methyl radical.</p>
    <p num="23">
      Among the compounds of formula (I), mention may be made in particular of:

      2-(4-amino)phenyidiazinecarboximidamide,

      The difference between the color of the lock before dyeing and the color of the lock after dyeing expresses the intensity of the colouring and was calculated by applying the Nickerson formula:

      <claim-text>or R1 and R2 form, together with the nitrogen atom to which they are attached, a 4- to 8-membered heterocycle, said heterocycle containing one or more hetero atoms chosen from sulfur, nitrogen and oxygen; - R3 and R4, independently of each other, represent a hydrogen atom, a C1 -C6 alkyl radical, a C1 -C6 monohydroxyalkyl radical or a C2 -C6 polyhydroxyalkyl radical;</claim-text>
      <claim-text>and - A is a 5- to 6-membered aromatic ring which can be interrupted by one or more hetero atoms chosen from sulfur, nitrogen and oxygen, or fused to another 5- to 6-membered aromatic ring, and a second compartment contains composition (B) containing, in a medium which is suitable for dyeing, at least one oxidizing agent.</claim-text>
