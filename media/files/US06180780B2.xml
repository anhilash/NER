      Preparatory to production scale fermentation for hydroxylation of canrenone or other substrates of Formula XIII, an inoculum of cells is prepared in a seed fermentation system comprising a seed fermenter, or a series of two or more seed fermenters.
      <br/>
      A working stock spore suspension is introduced into the first seed fermenter, together with a nutrient solution for growth of cells.
      <br/>
      If the volume of inoculum desired or needed for production exceeds that produced in the first seed fermenter, the inoculum volume may be progressively and geometrically amplified by progression through the remaining fermenters in the seed fermentation train.
      <br/>
      Preferably, the inoculum produced in the seed fermentation system is of sufficient volume and viable cells for achieving rapid initiation of reaction in the production fermenter, relatively short production batch cycles, and high production fermenter activity.
      <br/>
      Whatever the number of vessels in a train of seed fermenters, the second and subsequent seed fermenters are preferably sized so that the extent of dilution at each step in the train is essentially the same.
      <br/>
      The initial dilution of inoculum in each seed fermenter can be approximately the same as the dilution in the production fermenter.
      <br/>
      Canrenone or other Formula XIII substrate is charged to the production fermenter along with inoculum and nutrient solution, and the hydroxylation reaction conducted there.
    </p>
    <p num="116">
      The spore suspension charged to the seed fermentation system is from a vial of working stock spore suspension taken from a plurality of vials constituting a working stock cell bank that is stored under cryogenic conditions prior to use.
      <br/>
      The working stock cell bank is in turn derived from a master stock cell bank that has been prepared in the following manner.
      <br/>
      A spore specimen obtained from an appropriate source, e.g., ATCC, is initially suspended in an aqueous medium such as, for example, saline solution, nutrient solution or a surfactant solution, (e.g., a nonionic surfactant such as Tween 20 at a concentration of about 0.001% by weight), and the suspension distributed among culture plates, each plate bearing a solid nutrient mixture, typically based on a non-digestible polysaccharide such as agar, where the spores are propagated.
      <br/>
      The solid nutrient mixture preferably contains between about 0.5% and about 5% by weight glucose, between about 0.05% and about 5% by weight of a nitrogen source, e.g., peptone, between about 0.05% and about 0.5% by weight of a phosphorus source, e.g., an ammonium or alkali metal phosphate such as dipotassium hydrogen phosphate, between about 0.25% and about 2.5% by weight yeast lysate or extract (or other amino acid source such as meat extract or brain heart infusion), between about 1% and about 2% by weight agar or other non-digestible polysaccharide.
      <br/>
      Optionally, the solid nutrient mixture may further comprise and/or contain between about 0.1% and about 5% by weight malt extract.
      <br/>
      The pH of the solid nutrient mixture is preferably between about 5.0 and about 7.0, adjusted as required by alkali metal hydroxide or orthophosphoric acid.
      <br/>
      Among useful solid growth media are the following:
    </p>
    <p num="117">
      1.
      <br/>
      Solid Medium -1: 1% glucose, 0.25% yeast extract, 0.3% K2 HPO4 and 2% agar (Bacto); pH adjusted to 6.5 with 20% NaOH.
      <br/>
      2. Solid Medium -2: 2% peptone (Bacto), 1% yeast extract (Bacto), 2% glucose and 2% agar (Bacto); pH adjusted to 5 with 10% H3 PO4.
      <br/>
      3. Solid Medium -3: 0.1% peptone (Bacto), 2% malt extract (Bacto), 2% glucose and 2% agar (Bacto); pH as is 5.3.
      <br/>
      4. Liquid Medium: 5% blackstrap molasses, 0.5% cornsteep liquor, 0.25% glucose, 0.25% NaCl and 0.5% KH2 PO4, pH adjusted to 5.8.
      <br/>
      5. Difco Mycological agar (low pH).
    </p>
    <p num="118">
      The number of agar plates used in the development of a master stock cell bank can be selected with a view to future demands for master stock, but typically about 15 to about 30 plates are so prepared.
      <br/>
      After a suitable period of growth, e.g., 7 to 10 days, the plates are scraped in the presence of an aqueous vehicle, typically saline or buffer, for harvesting the spores, and the resulting master stock suspension is divided among small vials, e.g., one ml. in each of a plurality of 1.5 ml vials.
      <br/>
      To prepare a working stock spore suspension for use in research or production fermentation operations, the contents of one or more of these second generation master stock vials can be distributed among and incubated on agar plates in the manner described above for the preparation of master stock spore suspension.
      <br/>
      Where routine manufacturing operations are contemplated, as many as 100 to 400 plates may be used to generate second generation working stock.
      <br/>
      Each plate is scraped into a separate working stock vial, each vial typically containing one ml of the inoculum produced.
      <br/>
      For permanent preservation, both the master stock suspension and the second generation production inoculum are advantageously stored in the vapor space of a cryogenic storage vessel containing liquid N2 or other cryogenic liquid.
    </p>
    <p num="119">
      In the process illustrated in FIG. 1, aqueous growth medium is prepared which includes a nitrogen source such as peptone, a yeast derivative or equivalent, glucose, and a source of phosphorus such as a phosphate salt.
      <br/>
      Spores of the microorganism are cultured in this medium in the seed fermentation system.
      <br/>
      The preferred microorganism is Aspergillus ochraceus NRRL 405 (ATCC 18500).
      <br/>
      The seed stock so produced is then introduced into the production fermenter together with the substrate of Formula XIII.
      <br/>
      The fermentation broth is agitated and aerated for a time sufficient for the reaction to proceed to the desired degree of completion.
    </p>
    <p num="120">
      The medium for the seed fermenter preferably comprises an aqueous mixture which contains: between about 0.5% and about 5% by weight glucose, between about 0.05% and about 5% by weight of a nitrogen source, e.g., peptone, between about 0.05% and about 0.5% by weight of a phosphorus source, e.g., an ammonium or alkali metal phosphate such as ammonium phosphate monobasic or dipotassium hydrogen phosphate, between about 0.25% and about 2.5% by weight yeast lysate or extract (or other amino acid source such as distiller's solubles), between about 1% and about 2% by weight agar or other non-digestible polysaccharide.
      <br/>
      A particularly preferred seed growth medium contains about 0.05% and about 5% by weight of a nitrogen source such as peptone, between about 0.25% and about 2.5% by weight of autolyzed yeast or yeast extract, between about 0.5% and about 5% by weight glucose, and between about 0.05% by weight and about 0.5% by weight of a phosphorus source such as ammonium phosphate monobasic.
      <br/>
      Especially economical process operations are afforded by the use of another preferred seed culture which contains between about 0.5% and about 5% by weight corn steep liquor, between about 0.25% and about 2.5% autolyzed yeast or yeast extract, between about 0.5% and about 5% by weight glucose and about 0.05% and about 0.5% by weight ammonium phosphate monobasic.
      <br/>
      Corn steep liquor is a particularly economical source of proteins, peptides, carbohydrates, organic acids, vitamins, metal ions, trace matters and phosphates.
      <br/>
      Mash liquors from other grains may be used in place of, or in addition to, corn steep liquor.
      <br/>
      The pH of the medium is preferably adjusted within the range of between about 5.0 and about 7.0, e.g., by addition of an alkali metal hydroxide or orthophosphoric acid.
      <br/>
      Where corn steep liquor serves as the source of nitrogen and carbon, the pH is preferably adjusted within the range of about 6.2 to about 6.8. The medium comprising peptone and glucose is preferably adjusted to a pH between about 5.4 and about 6.2. Among useful growth media for use in seed fermentation:
      <br/>
      1.
      <br/>
      Medium -1: 2% peptone, 2% yeast autolised (or yeast extract) and 2% glucose; pH adjusted to 5.8 with 20% NaOH.
      <br/>
      2. Medium -2: 3% corn steep liquor, 1.5% yeast extract 0.3% ammonium phosphate monobasic and 3% glucose; pH adjusted to 6.5 with 20% NaOH.
    </p>
    <p num="121">
      Spores of the microorganism are introduced into this medium from a vial typically containing in the neighborhood of 109 spores per ml. of suspension.
      <br/>
      Optimal productivity of seed generation is realized where dilution with growth medium at the beginning of a seed culture does not reduce the spore population density below about 107 per ml.
      <br/>
      Preferably, the spores are cultured in the seed fermentation system until the packed mycelial volume (PMV) in the seed fermenter is at least about 20%, preferably 35% to 45%.
      <br/>
      Since the cycle in the seed fermentation vessel (or any vessel of a plurality which comprise a seed fermentation train) depends on the initial concentration in that vessel, it may be desirable to provide two or three seed fermentation stages to accelerate the overall process.
      <br/>
      However, it is preferable to avoid the use of significantly more than three seed fermenters in series, since activity may be compromised if seed fermentation is carried through an excessive number of stages.
      <br/>
      The seed culture fermentation is conducted under agitation at a temperature in the range of about 23 (degree)  to about 37 (degree)  C., preferably in range of between about 24 (degree)  and about 28 (degree)  C.

    <p num="122">
      Culture from the seed fermentation system is introduced into a production fermenter, together with a production growth medium.
      <br/>
      In one embodiment of the invention, non-sterile canrenone or other substrate of Formula XIII serves as the substrate for the reaction.
      <br/>
      Preferably, the substrate is added to the production fermenter in the form of a 10% to 30% by weight slurry in growth medium.
      <br/>
      To increase the surface area available for 11 ALPHA -hydroxylation reaction, the particle size of the Formula XIII substrate is reduced by passing the substrate through an off line micronizer prior to introduction into the fermenter.
      <br/>
      A sterile nutrient feed stock containing glucose, and a second sterile nutrient solution containing a yeast derivative such as autolyzed yeast (or equivalent amino acid formulation based on alternative sources such as distiller's solubles), are also separately introduced.
      <br/>
      The medium comprises an aqueous mixture containing: between about 0.5% and about 5% by weight glucose, between about 0.05% and about 5% by weight of a nitrogen source, e.g., peptone, between about 0.05% and about 0.5% by weight of a phosphorus source, e.g., an ammonium or alkali metal phosphate such as dipotassium hydrogen phosphate, between about 0.25% and about 2.5% by weight yeast lysate or extract (or other amino acid source such as distiller's solubles), between about 1% and about 2% by weight agar or other non-digestible polysaccharide.

      A particularly preferred production growth medium contains about 0.05% and about 5% by weight of a nitrogen source such as peptone, between about 0.25% and about 2.5% by weight of autolyzed yeast or yeast extract, between about 0.5% and about 5% by weight glucose, and between about 0.05% and about 0.5% by weight of a phosphorus source such as ammonium phosphate monobasic.

      Another preferred production medium contains between about 0.5% and about 5% by weight corn steep liquor, between about 0.25% and about 2.5% autolyzed yeast or yeast extract, between about 0.5% and about 5% by weight glucose and about 0.05% and about 0.5% by weight ammonium phosphate monobasic.
      <br/>
      The pH of the production fermentation medium is preferably adjusted in the manner described above for the seed fermentation medium, with the same preferred ranges for the pH of peptone/glucose based media and corn steep liquor based media, respectively.

      Useful bioconversion growth media are set forth below:

      Advantageously, the substrate is initially introduced in an amount sufficient to establish a concentration of between about 0.1% by weight and about 3% by weight, preferably between about 0.5% and about 2% by weight, before inoculation with seed fermentation broth, then added periodically, conveniently every 8 to 24 hours, to a cumulative proportion of between about 1% and about 8% by weight.
      <br/>
      Where additional substrate is added every 8 hour shift, total addition may be slightly lower, e.g., 0.25% to 2.5% by weight, than in the case where substrate is added only on a daily basis.
      <br/>
      In the latter instance cumulative canrenone addition may need to be in the range 2% to about 8% by weight.
      <br/>
      The supplemental nutrient mixture fed during the fermentation reaction is preferably a concentrate, for example, a mixture containing between about 40% and about 60% by weight sterile glucose, and between about 16% and about 32% by weight sterile yeast extract or other sterile source of yeast derivative (or other amino acid source).
      <br/>
      Since the substrate fed to the production fermenter of FIG. 1 is non-sterile, antibiotics are periodically added to the fermentation broth to control the growth of undesired organisms.
      <br/>
      Antibiotics such as kanamycin, tetracycline, and cefalexin can be added without disadvantageously affecting growth and bioconversion.
      <br/>
      Preferably, these are introduced into the fermentation broth in a concentration, e.g., of between about 0.0004% and about 0.002% based on the total amount of the broth, comprising, e.g., between about 0.0002% and about 0.0006% kanamicyn sulfate, between about 0.0002% and about 0.006% tetracycline HCl and/or between about 0.001% and about 0.003% cefalexin, again based on the total amount of broth.
    </p>
    <p num="124">
      Typically, the production fermentation batch cycle is in the neighborhood of 80-160 hours.
      <br/>
      Thus, portions of each of the Formula XIII substrate and nutrient solutions are typically added every 2 to 10 hours, preferably every 4 to 6 hours.
      <br/>
      Advantageously, an antifoam is also incorporated in the seed fermentation system, and in the production fermenter.
    </p>
    <p num="125">
      Preferably, in the process of FIG. 1, the inoculum charge to the production fermenter is about 0.5 to about 7%, more preferably about 1 to about 2%, by volume based on the total mixture in the fermenter, and the glucose concentration is maintained between about 0.01% and about 1.0%, preferably between about 0.025% and about 0.5%, more preferably between about 0.05% and about 0.25% by weight with periodic additions that are preferably in portions of about 0.05% to about 0.25% by weight, based on the total batch charge.
      <br/>
      The fermentation temperature is conveniently controlled within a range of about 20 (degree)  to about 37 (degree)  C., preferably about 24 (degree)  C. to about 28 (degree)  C., but it may be desirable to step down the temperature during the reaction, e.g., in 2 (degree)  C. increments, to maintain the packed mycelium volume (PMV) below about 60%, more preferably below about 50%, and thereby prevent the viscosity of the fermentation broth from interfering with satisfactory mixing.
      <br/>
      If the biomass growth extends above the liquid surface, substrate retained within the biomass may be carried out of the reaction zone and become unavailable for the hydroxylation reaction.
      <br/>
      For productivity, it is desirable to reach a PMV in the range of 30 to 50%, preferably 35% to 45%, within the first 24 hours of the fermentation reaction, but thereafter conditions are preferably managed to control further growth within the limits stated above.
      <br/>
      During reaction, the pH of the fermentation medium is controlled at between about 5.0 and about 6.5, preferably between about 5.2 and about 5.8, and the fermenter is agitated at a rate of between about 400 and about 800 rpm.
      <br/>
      A dissolved oxygen level of at least about 10% of saturation is achieved by aerating the batch at between about 0.2 and about 1.0 vvm, and maintaining the pressure in the head space of the fermenter at between about atmospheric and about 1.0 bar gauge, most preferably in the neighborhood of about 0.7 bar gauge.
      <br/>
      Agitation rate may also been increased as necessary to maintain minimum dissolved oxygen levels.
      <br/>
      Advantageously, the dissolved oxygen is maintained at well above 10%, in fact as high as 50% to promote conversion of substrate.
      <br/>
      Maintaining the pH in the range of 5.5.+- 0 (slashed zero) 2 is also optimal for bioconversion.
      <br/>
      Foaming is controlled as necessary by addition of a common antifoaming agent.
      <br/>
      After all substrate has been added, reaction is preferably continued until the molar ratio of Formula VIII product to remaining unreacted Formula XIII substrate is at least about 9 to 1.
      <br/>
      Such conversion may be achieve within the 80-160 hour batch cycle indicated above.
    </p>
    <p num="126">
      It has been found that high conversions are associated with depletion of initial nutrient levels below the initial charge level, and by controlling aeration rate and agitation rate to avoid splashing of substrate out of the liquid broth.
      <br/>
      In the process of FIG. 1, the nutrient level was depleted to and then maintained at no greater than about 60%, preferably about 50%, of the initial charge level; while in the processes of FIGS. 2 and 3, the nutrient level was reduced to and maintained at no greater than about 80%, preferably about 70%, of the initial charge level.
      <br/>
      Aeration rate is preferably no greater than one vvm, more preferably in the range of about 0.5 vvm; while agitation rate is preferably not greater than 600 rpm.
    </p>
    <p num="127">
      A particularly preferred process for preparation of a compound of Formula VIII is illustrated in FIG. 2.
      <br/>
      Again the preferred microorganism is Aspergillus ochraceus NRRL 405 (ATCC 18500).
      <br/>
      In this process, growth medium preferably comprises between about 0.5% and about 5% by weight corn steep liquor, between about 0.5% and about 5% by weight glucose, between about 0.1% and about 3% by weight yeast extract, and between about 0.05% and about 0.5% by weight ammonium phosphate.
      <br/>
      However, other production growth media as described herein may also be used.
      <br/>
      The seed culture is prepared essentially in the manner described for the process of FIG. 1, using any of the seed fermentation media described herein.
      <br/>
      A suspension of non-micronized canrenone or other Formula XIII substrate in the growth medium is prepared aseptically in a blender, preferably at a relatively high concentration of between about 10% and about 30% by weight substrate.
      <br/>
      Preferably, aseptic preparation may comprise sterilization or pasteurization of the suspension after mixing.
      <br/>
      The entire amount of sterile substrate suspension required for a production batch is introduced into the production fermenter at the beginning of the batch, or by periodical chain feeding.
      <br/>
      The particle size of the substrate is reduced by wet milling in an on-line shear pump which transfers the slurry to the production fermenter, thus obviating the need for use of an off line micronizer.
      <br/>
      Where aseptic conditions are achieved by pasteurization rather than sterilization, the extent of agglomeration may be insignificant, but the use of a shear pump may be desirable to provide positive control of particle size.
      <br/>
      Sterile growth medium and glucose solution are introduced into the production fermenter essentially in the same manner as described above.
      <br/>
      All feed components to the production fermenter are sterilized before introduction, so that no antibiotics are required.
    </p>
    <p num="128">
      Preferably, in operation of the process of FIG. 2, the inoculum is introduced into the production fermenter in a proportion of between about 0.5% and about 7%, the fermentation temperature is between about 20 (degree)  and about 37 (degree)  C., preferably between about 24 (degree)  C. and about 28 (degree)  C., and the pH is controlled between about 4.4 and about 6.5, preferably between about 5.3 and about 5.5, e.g., by introduction of gaseous ammonia, aqueous ammonium hydroxide, aqueous alkali metal hydroxide, or orthophosphoric acid.
      <br/>
      As in the process of FIG. 1, the temperature is preferably trimmed to control growth of the biomass so that PMV does not exceed 55-60%.
      <br/>
      The initial glucose charge is preferably between about 1% and about 4% by weight, most preferably 2.5% to 3.5% by weight, but is preferably allowed to drift below about 1.0% by weight during fermentation.
      <br/>
      Supplemental glucose is fed periodically in portions of between about 0.2% and about 1.0% by weight based on the total batch charge, so as to maintain the glucose concentration in the fermentation zone within a range of between about 0.1% and about 1.5% by weight, preferably between about 0.25% and about 0.5% by weight.
      <br/>
      Optionally, nitrogen and phosphorus sources may be supplemented along with glucose.
      <br/>
      However, because the entire canrenone charge is made at the beginning of the batch cycle, the requisite supply of nitrogen and phosphorus bearing nutrients can also be introduced at that time, allowing the use of only a glucose solution for supplementation during the reaction.
      <br/>
      The rate and nature of agitation is a significant variable.
      <br/>
      Moderately vigorous agitation promotes mass transfer between the solid substrate and the aqueous phase.
      <br/>
      However, a low shear impeller should be used to prevent degradation of the myelin of the microorganisms.
      <br/>
      Optimal agitation velocity varies within the range of 200 to 800 rpm, depending on culture broth viscosity, oxygen concentration, and mixing conditions as affected by vessel, baffle and impeller configuration.
      <br/>
      Ordinarily, a preferred agitation rate is in the range of 350-600 rpm.
      <br/>
      Preferably the agitation impeller provides a downward axially pumping function so as to assist in good mixing of the fermented biomass.
      <br/>
      The batch is preferably aerated at a rate of between about 0.3 and about 1.0 vvm, preferably 0.4 to 0.8 vvm, and the pressure in the head space of the fermenter is preferably between about 0.5 and about 1.0 bar gauge.
      <br/>
      Temperature, agitation, aeration and back pressure are preferably controlled to maintain dissolved oxygen in the range of at least about 10% by volume during the bioconversion.
      <br/>
      Total batch cycle is typically between about 100 and about 140 hours.
    </p>
    <p num="129">
      Although the principle of operation for the process of FIG. 2 is based on early introduction of substantially the entire canrenone charge, it will be understood that growth of the fermentation broth may be carried out before the bulk of the canrenone is charged. optionally, some portion of the canrenone can also be added later in the batch.
      <br/>
      Generally, however, at least about 75% of the sterile canrenone charge should be introduced into the transformation fermenter within 48 hours after initiation of fermentation.
      <br/>
      Moreover, it is desirable to introduce at least about 25% by weight canrenone at the beginning of the fermentation, or at least within the first 24 hours in order to promote generation of the bioconversion enzyme(s).
    </p>
    <p num="130">
      In a further preferred process as illustrated in FIG. 3, the entire batch charge and nutrient solution are sterilized in the production fermentation vessel prior to the introduction of inoculum.
      <br/>
      The nutrient solutions that may be used, as well as the preferences among them, are essentially the same as in the process of FIG. 2.
      <br/>
      In this embodiment of the invention, the shearing action of the agitator impeller breaks down the substrate agglomerates that otherwise tend to form upon sterilization.
      <br/>
      It has been found that the reaction proceeds satisfactorily if the mean particle size of the canrenone is less than about 200 MU  and at least 75% by weight of the particles are smaller than 240 MU .
      <br/>
      The use of a suitable impeller, e.g., a disk turbine impeller, at an adequate velocity in the range of 200 to 800 rpm, with a tip speed of at least about 400 cm/sec., has been found to provide a shear rate sufficient to maintain such particle size characteristics despite the agglomeration that tends to occur upon sterilization within the production fermenter.
      <br/>
      The remaining operation of the process of FIG. 3 is essentially the same as the process of FIG. 2.
      <br/>
      The processes of FIGS. 2 and 3 offer several distinct advantages over the process of FIG. 1.
      <br/>
      A particular advantage is the amenability to use of a low cost nutrient base such as corn steep liquor.
      <br/>
      But further advantages are realized in eliminating the need of antibiotics, simplifying feeding procedures, and allowing for batch sterilization of canrenone or other Formula XIII substrate.
      <br/>
      Another particular advantage is the ability to use a simple glucose solution rather than a complex nutrient solution for supplementation during the reaction cycle.

      VIII is a crystalline solid which, together with the biomass, may be separated from the reaction broth by filtration or low speed centrifugation.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, the product can be extracted from the entire reaction broth with organic solvents.
      <br/>
      Product of Formula VIII is recovered by solvent extraction.
      <br/>
      For maximum recovery, both the liquid phase filtrate and the biomass filter or centrifuge cake are treated with extraction solvent, but usually  &gt;= 95% of the product is associated with the biomass.
      <br/>
      Typically, hydrocarbon, ester, chlorinated hydrocarbon, and ketone solvents may be used for extraction.
      <br/>
      A preferred solvent is a ethyl acetate.
      <br/>
      Other typically suitable solvents include toluene and methyl isobutyl ketone.
      <br/>
      For extraction from the liquid phase, it may be convenient to use a volume of solvent approximately equal to the volume of reaction solution which it contacts.
      <br/>
      To recover product the from the biomass, the latter is suspended in the solvent, preferably in large excess relative to the initial charge of substrate, e.g., 50 to 100 ml. solvent per gram of initial canrenone charge, and the resulting suspension preferably refluxed for a period of 20 minutes to several hours to assure transfer of product to the solvent phase from recesses and pores of the biomass.
      <br/>
      Thereafter, the biomass is removed by filtration or centrifugation, and the filter cake preferably washed with both fresh solvent and deionized water.
      <br/>
      Aqueous and solvent washes are then combined and the phases allowed to separate.
      <br/>
      Formula VIII product is recovered by crystallization from the solution.
      <br/>
      To maximize yield, the mycelium is contacted twice with fresh solvent.
      <br/>
      After settling to allow complete separation of the aqueous phase, product is recovered from the solvent phase.
      <br/>
      Most preferably, the solvent is removed under vacuum until crystallization begins, then the concentrated extract is cooled to a temperature of 0 (degree)  to 20 (degree)  C., preferably about 10 (degree)  to about 15 (degree)  C. for a time sufficient for crystal precipitation and growth, typically 8 to 12 hours.

      The processes of FIG. 2, and especially that of FIG. 3, are particularly preferred.

      These processes operate at low viscosity, and are amenable to close control of process parameters such as pH, temperature and dissolved oxygen.
      <br/>
      Moreover, sterile conditions are readily preserved without resort to antibiotics.

    <p num="133">
      The bioconversion process is exothermic, so that heat should be removed, using a jacketed fermenter or a cooling coil within the production fermenter.

      <br/>
      Dissolved oxygen is preferably maintained at a level of at least about 5%, preferably at least about 10%, by volume, sufficient to provide energy for the reaction and assure conversion of the glucose to CO2 and H2 O, by regulating the rate of air introduced into the reactor in response to measurement of oxygen potential in the broth.

      In each of the alternative processes for 11-hydroxylation of the substrate of Formula XIII, productivity is limited by mass transfer from the solid substrate to the aqueous phase, or the phase interface, where reaction is understood to occur.
      <br/>
      As indicated above, productivity is not significantly limited by mass transfer rates so long as the particle mean particle size of the substrate is reduced to less than about 300 MU , and at least 75% by weight of the particles are smaller than 240 MU .
      <br/>
      However, productivity of these processes may be further enhanced in certain alternative embodiments which provide a substantial charge of canrenone or other Formula XIII substrate to the production fermenter in an organic solvent.
      <br/>
      According to one option, the substrate is dissolved in a water-immiscible solvent and mixed with the aqueous growth medium inoculum and a surfactant.
      <br/>
      Useful water-immiscible solvents inlcude, for example, DMF, DMSO, C6 -C12 fatty acids, C6 -C12 n-alkanes, vegetable oils, sorbitans, and aqueous surfactant solutions.
      <br/>
      Agitation of this charge generates an emulsion reaction system having an extended interfacial area for mass transfer of substrate from the organic liquid phase to the reaction sites.
    </p>
    <p num="135">
      A second option is to initially dissolve the substrate in a water miscible solvent such as acetone, methylethyl ketone, methanol, ethanol, or glycerol in a concentration substantially greater than its solubility in water.
      <br/>
      By preparing the initial substrate solution at elevated temperature, solubility is increased, thereby further increasing the amount of solution form substrate introduced into the reactor and ultimately enhancing the reactor payload.
      <br/>
      The warm substrate solution is charged to the production fermentation reactor along with the relatively cool aqueous charge comprising growth medium and inoculum.
      <br/>
      When the substrate solution is mixed with the aqueous medium, precipitation of the substrate occurs.
      <br/>
      However, under conditions of substantial supersaturation and moderately vigorous agitation, nucleation is favored over crystal growth, and very fine particles of high surface area are formed.
      <br/>
      The high surface area promotes mass transfer between the liquid phase and the solid substrate.
      <br/>
      Moreover, the equilibrium concentration of substrate in the aqueous liquid phase is also enhanced in the presence of a water-miscible solvent.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, productivity is promoted.
    </p>
    <p num="136">Although the microorganism may not necessarily tolerate a high concentration of organic solvent in the aqueous phase, a concentration of ethanol, e.g., in the range of about 3% to about 5% by weight, can be used to advantage.</p>

      A third option is to solubilize the substrate in an aqueous cyclodextrin solution.

      In this embodiment of the invention, a formula VIII substrate is reacted with an excess of alkali metal cyanide in an aqueous solvent containing a proton source, or optionally an excess of ketone cyanohydrin in the presence of a base and LiCl, as described hereinabove.
      <br/>
      However, instead of cooling the reaction mixture, acidifying, and adding water in proportions calculated to cause precipitation of the enamine, substantial cooling of the reaction mixture is preferably avoided.
      <br/>
      Water and an acid, preferably a mineral acid such as sulfuric, are indeed added to mixture at the end of the cyanidation reaction, and the proportion of acid added is sufficient to neutralize excess alkali metal cyanide, which ordinarily requires introduction of at least one molar equivalent acid per mole of Formula VIII substrate, preferably between about 2 and about 5 mole equivalents per equivalent substrate.
      <br/>
      However, the temperature is maintained at high enough, and the dilution greater enough, so that substantial precipitation is avoided and hydrolysis of the enamine to the diketone is allowed to proceed in the liquid phase.
      <br/>
      Thus, the process proceeds with minimum interruption and high productivity.
      <br/>
      Hydrolysis is preferably conducted at a temperature of at least 80 (degree)  C., more preferably in the range of about 90 (degree)  C. to about 100 (degree)  C., for a period of typically about 1 to about 10 hours, more preferably about 2 to about 5 hours.

      <br/>
      The product of this reaction is a hydroxyester compound corresponding to Formula V  (Chemical Structure image '59' not included in text)

      Yields of this reaction are most satisfactory when the metal alkoxide is K or Na methoxide, but other lower alkoxides can be used.

      A K alkoxide is particularly preferred.
      <br/>
      Phenoxides, other aryloxides may also be used, as well as arylsulfides.

      The reaction is conveniently carried out in the presence of an alcohol corresponding to the formula R10 OH where R10 is as defined above.

      Temperature is not critical but elevated temperature enhances productivity.
      <br/>
      Reaction time is typically between about 4 and about 24 hours, preferably about 4 to 16 hours.

      In the conversion of the diketone of Formula VI to the hydroxyester of Formula VI, by-product cyanide ion can react with the product to form 5-cyanoester.
      <br/>
      Because the equilibrium is more favorable at low concentrations, the reaction is preferably run at rather high dilution, e.g., as high as 40:1 for reaction with Na methoxide.
      <br/>
      It has been found that significantly higher productivity can be realized by use of K methoxide rather than Na methoxide, because a dilution in the range of about 20:1 is generally sufficient to minimize the extent of reverse cyanidation where K methoxide is the reagent.
    </p>
    <p num="162">
      In accordance with the invention, it has been further discovered that the reverse cyanidation reaction may be inhibited by taking appropriate chemical or physical measures to remove by-product cyanide ion from the reaction zone.
      <br/>
      Thus, in a further embodiment of the invention, the reaction of the diketone with alkali metal alkoxide may be carried out in the presence of an precipitating agent for cyanide ion such as, for example, a salt comprising a cation which forms an insoluble cyanide compound.
      <br/>
      Such salts may, for example, include zinc iodide, ferric sulfate, or essentially any halide, sulfate or other salt of an alkaline earth or transition metal that is more soluble than the corresponding cyanide.
      <br/>
      If zinc iodide is present in proportions in the range of about one equivalent per equivalent diketone substrate, it has been observed that the productivity of the reaction is increased substantially as compared to the process as conducted in the absence of an alkali metal halide.

      Even where a precipitating agent is used for removal of cyanide ion, it remains preferable to run at fairly high dilution, but by use of a precipitating agent the solvent to diketone substrate molar ratio may be reduced significantly compared to reactions in the absence of such agent.

      The leaving group elimination reagent is preferably prepared by mixing an organic acid, an organic acid salt and a drying agent, preferably formic acid, alkali metal formate and acetic anhydride, respectively, in a dry reactor.

      To promote the removal of water, the temperature of this reaction is preferably maintained in the range of 60 (degree)  to 90 (degree)  C., most preferably about 65 (degree)  to about 75 (degree)  C. This reagent is then added to the product solution of the compound of Formula IV to effect the elimination reaction.

      After 4-8 hours, the reaction mixture is preferably heated to a temperature of at least about 85 (degree)  C., but not above about 95 (degree)  C. until all volatile distillate has been removed, and then for an additional period to complete the reaction, typically about 1 to 4 hours.

      In this process, the enester product is precipitated by dilution of the reaction mixture with water after removal of formic acid.

      According to a further alternative for conversion of the hydroxyester of Formula V to the enester of Formula II without isolation of the compound of Formula IV, the 11 ALPHA -hydroxy group of the Formula V hydroxyester is replaced by halogen, and the Formula II enester is then formed in situ by thermal dehydro halogenation.
      <br/>
      Replacement of the hydroxy group by halogen is effected by reaction with sulfuryl halide, preferably sulfuryl chloride, in the cold in the presence of a hydrogen halide scavenger such as imidazole.
      <br/>
      The hydroxyester is dissolved in a solvent such as tetrahydrofuran and cooled to 0 (degree)  C. to -70 (degree)  C. The sulfuryl halide is added and the reaction mixture is warmed to moderate temperature, e.g., room temperature, for a time sufficient to complete the elimination reaction, typically 1 to 4 hours.

      The process of this embodiment not only combines two steps into one, but eliminates the use of: a halogenated reaction solvent; an acid (such as acetic); and a drying reagent (acetic anhydride or sodium sulfate).
      <br/>
      Moreover, the reaction does not require refluxing conditions, and avoids the generation of by-product CO which results when acetic acid is used as a drying reagent.

      Where trihaloacetonitrile is used in the epoxidation reaction, it has been found that the selection of solvent is important, with halogenated solvents being highly preferred, and methylene chloride being especially preferred.
      <br/>
      Solvents such as dichloroethane and chlorobenzene give reasonably satisfactory yields, but yields are generally better in a methylene chloride reaction medium.
      <br/>
      Solvents such as acetonitrile and ethyl acetate generally give poor yields, while reaction in solvents such as methanol or water/tetrahydrofuran give little of the desired product.
    </p>
    <p num="200">
      Further in accordance with the present invention, it has been discovered that numerous improvements in the synthesis of epoxymexrenone can be realized by use of a trihaloacetamide rather than a trihaloacetonitrile as a peroxide activator for the epoxidation reaction.
      <br/>
      In accordance with a particularly preferred process, the epoxidation is carried out by reaction of the substrate of Formula IIA with hydrogen peroxide in the presence of trichloroacetamide and an appropriate buffer.
      <br/>
      Preferably, the reaction is conducted in a pH in the range of about 3 to about 7, most preferably between about 5 and about 7.
      <br/>
      However, despite these considerations, successful reaction has been realized outside the preferred pH ranges.
    </p>
    <p num="201">
      Especially favorable results are obtained with a buffer comprising dipotassium hydrogen phosphate, and/or with a buffer comprising a combination of dipotassium hydrogenphosphate and potassium dihydrogen phosphate in relative proportions of between about 1:4 and about 2:1, most preferably in the range of about 2:3.
      <br/>
      Borate buffers can also be used, but generally give slower conversions than dipotassium phosphate or K2 HPO4 or K2 HPO4 /KH2 PO4 mixtures.
      <br/>
      Whatever the makeup of the buffer, it should provide a pH in the range indicated above.
      <br/>
      Aside from the overall composition of the buffer or the precise pH it may impart, it has been observed that the reaction proceeds much more effectively if at least a portion of the buffer is comprised of dibasic hydrogenphosphate ion.
      <br/>
      It is believed that this ion may participate essentially as a homogeneous catalyst in the formation of an adduct or complex comprising the promoter and hydroperoxide ion, the generation of which may in turn be essential to the overall epoxidation reaction mechanism.
      <br/>
      Thus, the quantitative requirement for dibasic hydrogenphosphate (preferably from K2 HPO4) may be only a small catalytic concentration.
      <br/>
      Generally, it is preferred that HPO4 be present in a proportion of at least about 0.1 equivalents, e.g., between about 0.1 and about 0.3 equivalents, per equivalent substrate.
    </p>
    <p num="202">
      The reaction is carried out in a suitable solvent, preferably methylene chloride, but alternatively other halogenated solvents such as chlorobenzene or dichloroethane can be used.
      <br/>
      Toluene and mixtures of toluene and acetonitrile have also been found satisfactory.
      <br/>
      Without committing to a particular theory, it is posited that the reaction proceeds most effectively in a two phase system in which a hydroperoxide intermediate is formed and distributes to the organic phase of low water content, and reacts with the substrate in the organic phase.
      <br/>
      Thus the preferred solvents are those in which water solubility is low.
      <br/>
      Effective recovery from toluene is promoted by inclusion of another solvent such as acetonitrile.
    </p>
    <p num="203">
      In the conversion of substrates of Formula II to products of Formula I, toluene provides a process advantage since the substrates are freely soluble in toluene and the products are not.
      <br/>
      Thus, the product precipitates during the reaction when conversions reach the 40-50% range, producing a three phase mixture from which the product can be conveniently separated by filtration.
      <br/>
      Methanol, ethyl acetate, acetonitrile alone, THF and THF/water have not proved as to be as effective as the halogenated solvents or toluene in carrying out the conversion of this step of the process.

      While trichloroacetamide is a highly preferred reagent, other trihaloacetamides such as trifluoroacetamide can also be used.
      <br/>
      Trihalomethylbenzamide, and other compounds having an arylene moiety between the electron withdrawing trihalomethyl group and the carbonyl of the amide, may also be useful. 3,3,3-Trihalopropionamides may also be used, but with less favorable results.

      <br/>
      Where any of X1, X2, X3, X4 or X5 is not halo, it is preferably haloalkyl, most preferably perhaloalkyl.

      Particularly preferred activators include those in which n is 0 and at least two of X1, X2 and X3 are halo; or in which all of X1, X2, X3, X4 and X5 are halo or perhaloalkyl.
      <br/>
      Each of X1, X2 X3, X4 and X5 is preferably Cl or F, most preferably Cl, though mixed halides may also be suitable, as may perchloralkyl or perbromoalkyl and combinations thereof.

      Preferably, the peroxide activator is present in a proportion of at least about 1 equivalents, more preferably between about 1.5 and about 2 equivalents, per equivalent of substrate initially present.
      <br/>
      Hydrogen peroxide should be charged to the reaction in at least modest excess, or added progressively as the epoxidation reaction proceeds.
      <br/>
      Although the reaction consumes only one to two equivalents of hydrogen peroxide per mole of substrate, hydrogen peroxide is preferably charged in substantial excess relative to substrate and activator initially present.
      <br/>
      Without limiting the invention to a particular theory, it is believed that the reaction mechanism involves formation of an adduct of the activator and OOH-, that the formation of this reaction is reversible with the equilibrium favoring the reverse reaction, and that a substantial initial excess of hydrogen peroxide is therefore necessary in order to drive the reaction in the forward direction.
      <br/>
      Temperature of the reaction is not narrowly critical, and may be effectively carried out within the range of 0 (degree)  to 100 (degree)  C. The optimum temperature depends on the selection of solvent.
      <br/>
      Generally, the preferred temperature is between about 20 (degree)  C. and 30 (degree)  C., but in certain solvents, e.g., toluene the reaction may be advantageously conducted in the range of 60 (degree) -70 (degree)  C. At 25 (degree)  C., reaction typically requires less than 10 hours, typically 3 to 6 hours.
      <br/>
      If needed additional activator and hydrogen peroxide may be added at the end of the reaction cycle to achieve complete conversion of the substrate.

    <p num="208">
      At the end of the reaction cycle, the aqueous phase is removed, the organic reaction solution is preferably washed for removal of water soluble impurities, after which the product may be recovered by removal of the solvent.
      <br/>
      Before removal of solvent, the reaction solution should be washed, at with least a mild to moderately alkaline wash, e.g., sodium carbonate.
      <br/>
      Preferably, the reaction mixture is washed successively with: a mild reducing solution such as a weak (e.g. 3% by weight) solution of sodium sulfite in water; an alkaline solution, e.g., NaOH or KOH (preferably about 0.5N); an acid solution such as HCl (preferably about 1N); and a final neutral wash comprising water or brine, preferably saturated brine to minimize product losses.
      <br/>
      Prior to removal of the reaction solvent, another solvent such as an organic solvent, preferably ethanol may be advantageously added, so that the product may be recovered by crystallization after distillation for removal of the more volatile reaction solvent.

      It should be understood that the novel epoxidation method utilizing trichloroacetamide or other novel peroxide activator has application well beyond the various schemes for the preparation of epoxymexrenone, and in fact may be used for the formation of epoxides across olefinic double bonds in a wide variety of substrates subject to reaction in the liquid phase.
      <br/>
      The reaction is particularly effective in unsaturated compounds in which the olefinic carbons are tetrasubstituted and trisubstituted, i.e., Ra Rb C.dbd.CRc Rd and Ra Rb C.dbd.CRc RH where Ra to Rd represent substituents other than hydrogen.
      <br/>
      The reaction proceeds most rapidly and completely where the substrate is a cyclic compound with a trisubstituted double, or either a cyclic or acyclic compound with tetrasubstituted double bonds.

      Exemplary substrates for this reaction include  DELTA -9,11-canrenone, and  (Chemical Structure image '74' not included in text)

    <p num="210">Because the reaction proceeds more rapidly and completely with trisubstituted and tetrasubstituted double bonds, it is especially effective for selective epoxidation across such double bonds in compounds that may include other double bonds where the olefinic carbons are monosubstituted, or even disubstituted.</p>
    <p num="211">
      It should be further understood that the reaction may be used to advantage in the epoxidation of monosubstituted or even disubstituted double bonds, such as the 11,12-olefin in various steroid substrates.

      However, because it preferentially epoxidizes the more highly substituted double bonds, e.g., the 9,11-olefin, with high selectivity, the process of this invention is especially effective for achieving high yields and productivity in the epoxidation steps of the various reaction schemes described elsewhere herein.

      Multiple advantages have been demonstrated for the process of the invention in which trichloroacetamide is used in place of trichloroacetonitrile as the oxygen transfer reagent for the epoxidation reaction.
      <br/>
      The trichloroacetamide reagent system provides tight regiocontrol for epoxidation across trisubstituted double with disubstituted and  ALPHA , BETA -keto olefins in the same molecular structure.
      <br/>
      Thus, reaction yield, product profile and final purity are substantially enhanced.
      <br/>
      It has further been discovered that the substantial excess oxygen generation observed with the use of trihaloacetonitrile is not experienced with trichloroacetamide, imparting improved safety to the epoxidation process.
      <br/>
      Further in contrast to the trichloroacetonitrile promoted reaction, the trichloroacetamide reaction exhibits minimum exothermic effects, thus facilitating control of the thermal profile of the reaction.
      <br/>
      Agitation effects are observed to be minimal and reactor performance more consistent, a further advantage over the trichloroacetonitrile process.
      <br/>
      The reaction is more amenable to scaleup than the trichloroacetonitrile promoted reaction.
      <br/>
      Product isolation and purification is simple, there is no observable Bayer-Villager oxidation of carbonyl function (peroxide promoted conversion of ketone to ester) as experienced, e.g., using m-chloroperoxybenzoic acid or other peracids and the reagent is inexpensive, readily available, and easily handled.

      As reaction proceeded, the reaction mixture was periodically analyzed to determine glucose content, and by thin layer chromatography to determine conversion to 11 ALPHA -hydroxycanrenone.
      <br/>
      Based on TLC analysis of reaction broth samples as described hereinbelow, additional canrenone was added to the reaction mixture as canrenone substrate was consumed.
      <br/>
      Glucose levels were also monitored and, whenever glucose concentration dropped to about 0.05% by weight or below, supplemental glucose solution was added to bring the concentration up to about 0.25% by weight.
      <br/>
      Nutrients and antibiotics were also added at discrete times during the reaction cycle.
      <br/>
      The addition schedule for steroid suspension, glucose solution, autolyzed yeast solution and antibiotic solution is set forth in Table 8.
      <br/>
      The transformation reaction continued for 90 hours at an aeration rate of 0.5 vol. air per vol. liquid per minute (vvm) at a positive head pressure of 0.3 kg/cm2. The temperature was maintained at 28 (degree)  C. until PVM reached 45%, then decreased to 26 (degree)  C. and maintained at that temperature as PVM grew from 45% to 60%, and thereafter controlled at 24 (degree)  C. The initial agitation rate was 400 rpm, increasing to 700 rpm after 40 hours.
      <br/>
      The pH was maintained at between 4.7 and 5.3 by additions of 2M orthophosphoric acid or 2M NaOH, as indicated.
      <br/>
      Foaming was controlled by adding a few drops of Antifoam SAG 471 as foam developed.
      <br/>
      The disappearance of canrenone and appearance of 11 ALPHA -hydroxycanrenone were monitored at 4 hour intervals during the reaction by TLC analysis of broth samples.
      <br/>
      When most of the canrenone had disappeared from the broth, additional increments were added.
    </p>
    <p num="346">After all canrenone additions had been made, the reaction was terminated when TLC analysis showed that the concentration of canrenone substrate relative to 11 ALPHA -hydroxycanrenone product had dropped to about 5%.</p>
    <p num="347">
      At the conclusion of the reaction cycle, the fermentation broth was filtered through cheese cloth for separation of the mycelium from the liquid broth.
      <br/>
      The mycelia fraction was resuspended in ethyl acetate using about 65 volumes (5.2 liters) per gram canrenone charged over the course of the reaction.
      <br/>
      The suspension of mycelia in ethyl acetate was refluxed for one hour under agitation, cooled to about 20 (degree)  C., and filtered on a Buchner.
      <br/>
      The mycelia cake was washed sequentially with ethyl acetate (5 vol. per g canrenone charge; 0.4 L) and deionized water (500 ml) to displace the ethyl acetate extract from the cake.
      <br/>
      The filter cake was discarded.
      <br/>
      The rich extract, solvent washing and water washing were collected in a separator, then allowed to stand for 2 hours for phase separation.
    </p>
    <p num="348">
      The aqueous phase was then discarded and the organic phase concentrated under vacuum to a residual volume of 350 ml.
      <br/>
      The still bottoms were cooled to 15 (degree)  C. and kept under agitation for about one hour.
      <br/>
      The resulting suspension was filtered to remove the crystalline product, and the filter cake was washed with ethyl acetate (40 ml).
      <br/>
      After drying, the yield of 11 ALPHA -hydroxycanrenone was determined to be 60 g.

      <br/>
      The resulting mixture was incubated in the flask for 24 hours at 25 (degree)  C. on an alternating shaker (120 strokes per min.; displacement 5 cm), thereby producing a culture which, on microscopic examination, was observed to appear as a pure culture with hyphae well twisted.
      <br/>
      The pH of the culture was between about 5.3 and 5.5, and the PMV (as determined by centrifugation at 3000 rpm for 5 min.) was 8 to 10%.

      Bioconversion was carried out for about 96 hours with aeration at 0.5 L/L-min. at a head pressure of 0.5 kg/cm2 and a pH of ranging between 4.7 and 5.3, adjusted as necessary by additions of 7.5 M NaOH or 4 M H3 PO4.
      <br/>
      The agitation rate was initially 100 rpm, increased to 165 rpm at 40 hours and 250 rpm at 64 hours.
      <br/>
      The initial temperature was 28 (degree)  C., lowered to 26 (degree)  C. when PMV reached 45%, and lowered to 24 (degree)  C. when PMV rose to 60%.
      <br/>
      SAG 471 in fine drops was added as necessary to control foaming.
      <br/>
      Glucose levels in the fermentation were monitored at 4 hour intervals and, whenever the glucose concentration fell below 1 gpl, an increment of sterile additive solution (10 L) was added to the batch.
      <br/>
      Disappearance of canrenone and appearance of 11 ALPHA -hydroxycanrenone were also monitored during the reaction by HPLC.
      <br/>
      When at least 90% of the initial canrenone charge had been converted to 11 ALPHA -hydroxycanrenone, an increment of 1.250 kg canrenone was added.
      <br/>
      When 90% of the canrenone in that increment was shown to have been converted, another 1.250 kg increment was introduced.
      <br/>
      Using the same criterion further increments (1.250 kg apiece) were added until the total reactor charge (20 kg) had been introduced.
      <br/>
      After the entire canrenone charge had been delivered to the reactor, reaction was terminated when the concentration of unreacted canrenone was 5% relative to the amount of 11 ALPHA -hydroxycanrenone produced.

      However, based on the results of these runs, it was concluded that methanol or other water-miscible solvent could serve effectively at lower concentrations to increase the canrenone charge and provide canrenone as a fine particle precipitate providing a large interfacial area for supply of canrenone to the subject to the reaction.

      Because of the limited solubility of canrenone in the aqueous growth medium, the productivity of the process depends on mass transfer from the solid phase, and thus may be expected to depend on the interfacial area presented by the solid particulate substrate which in turn depends on the particle size distribution.
      <br/>
      These considerations initially served as deterrents to the processes of FIGS. 2 and 3.
    </p>
    <p num="428">
      However, agitation in the blender of FIG. 2 and the fermentation tank of FIG. 3, together with the action of the shear pump used for transfer of the batch in FIG. 2, were found to degrade the agglomerates to a particle size range reasonably approximate that of the unsterilized and micronized canrenone fed to the process of FIG. 1.
      <br/>
      This is illustrated by the particle size distributions for the canrenone as available at the outset of the reaction cycle in each of the three processes.
      <br/>
      See Table 30 and FIGS. 4 and 5.

    <p num="430">
      From the data in Table 30, it will be noted that agitators and shear pump were effective to reduce the average particle size of the sterilized canrenone to the same order of magnitude as the unsterilized substrate, but a significance size difference remained in favor of the unsterilized substrate.
      <br/>
      Despite this difference, reaction performance data showed that the pre-sterilization processes were at least as productive as the process of FIG. 1.
      <br/>
      Further advantages may be realized in the process of FIG. 2 by certain steps for further reducing and controlling particle size, e.g., wet milling of sterilized canrenone, and/or by pasteurizing rather than sterilizing.

      At 20 hours, the mycelia in the inoculum fermenter was pulpy with a 40% PMV.

      A transformation growth medium (35 L) was prepared having the composition shown in Table 20.

      In the preparation of feeding medium, glucose and yeast extract were sterilized separately and mixed as a single feed at an initial concentration of 30% by weight glucose and 10% by weight yeast extract. pH of the feed was adjusted to 5.7.
    </p>
    <p num="434">
      Using this medium, (Table 20), two bioconversion runs were made for the conversion of canrenone to 11 ALPHA -hydroxycanrenone.
      <br/>
      Each of the runs was conducted in a 60 L fermenter provided with an agitator comprising one Rushton turbine impeller and two Lightnin' A315 impellers.
    </p>
    <p num="435">
      Initial charge of the growth medium to the fermenter was 35 L. Micronized and unsterilized canrenone was added to an initial concentration of 0.5%. The medium in the fermenter was inoculated with a seed culture prepared in the manner described in Example 5 at an initial inoculation ratio of 2.5%. Fermentation was carried out at a temperature of 28 (degree)  C., an agitation rate of 200 to 500 rpm, an aeration rate of 0.5 vvm, and backpressure sufficient to maintain a dissolved oxygen level of at least 20% by volume.
      <br/>
      The transformation culture developed during the production run was in the form of very small oval pellets (about 1-2 mm).
      <br/>
      Canrenone and supplemental nutrients were chain fed to the fermenter generally in the manner described in Example 1.
      <br/>
      Nutrient additions were made every four hours at a ratio of 3.4 g glucose and 0.6 g yeast extract per liter of broth in the fermenter.

    <p num="451">Fungi were grown in soybean meal medium and in peptone-yeast extract glucose; atinomycetes and eubacteria were grown in soybean meal (plus 0.9% by weight Na formate for biotransformations) and in Mueller-Hinton broth.</p>
    <p num="452">
      Starter cultures were inoculated with frozen spore stocks (20 ml soybean meal in 250 ml Erlenmayer flask).
      <br/>
      The flasks were covered with a milk filter and bioshield.
      <br/>
      Starter cultures (24 or 48 hours old) were used to inoculate metabolism cultures (also 20 ml in 250 ml Erlenmeyer flask)--with a 10% to 15% crossing volume--and the latter incubated for 24 to 48 hours before addition of steroid substrate for the transformation reaction.
    </p>
    <p num="453">Canrenone was dissolved/suspended in methanol (20 mg/ml), filter sterilized, and added to the cultures to a final concentration of 0.1 mg/ml. All transformation fermentation flasks were shaken at 250 rpm (2" throw) in a controlled temperature room at 26 (degree)  C. and 60% humidity.</p>
    <p num="454">
      Biotransformations were harvested at 5 and 48 hours, or at 24 hours, after addition of substrate.
      <br/>
      Harvesting began with the addition of ethyl acetate (23 ml) or methylene chloride to the fermentation flask.
      <br/>
      The flasks were then shaken for two minutes and the contents of each flask poured into a 50 ml conical tube.
      <br/>
      To separate the phases, tubes were centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 20 minutes in a room temperature unit.
      <br/>
      The organic layer from each tube was transferred to a 20 ml borosilicate glass vial and evaporated in a speed vac.
      <br/>
      Vials were capped and stored at -20 (degree)  C.
    </p>
    <p num="455">
      To obtain material for structure determination, biotransformations were scaled up to 500 ml by increasing the number of shake flask fermentations to 25.
      <br/>
      At the time of harvest (24 or 48 hours after addition of substrate), ethyl acetate was added to each flask individually, and the flasks were capped and put back on the shaker for 20 minutes.
      <br/>
      The contents of the flasks were then poured into polypropylene bottles and centrifuged to separate the phases, or into a separatory funnel in which phases were allowed to separate by gravity.
      <br/>
      The organic phase was dried, yielding crude extract of steroids contained in the reaction mixture.
    </p>
    <p num="456">
      Reaction product was analyzed first by thin layer chromatography on silica gel (250  MU m) fluorescence backed plates (254 nm).
      <br/>
      Ethyl acetate (500  MU L was added to each vial containing dried ethyl acetate extract from the reaction mixture.
      <br/>
      Further analyses were conducted by high performance liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry.
      <br/>
      Plates were developed in a 95:5 v/v chloroform/methanol medium.

      Further analysis was conducted by high performance liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry.
      <br/>
      A waters HPLC with Millennium software, photodiode array detector and autosampler was used.
      <br/>
      Reversed phase HPLC used a waters NovaPak C-18 (4  MU m particle size) RadialPak 4 mmcartridge.
      <br/>
      The 25 minute linear solvent gradient began with the column initialized in water:acetonitrile (75:25), and ended at water:acetonitrile (25:75).
      <br/>
      This was followed by a three minute gradient to 100% acetonitrile and 4 minutes of isocratic wash before column regeneration in initial conditions.
    </p>
    <p num="458">
      For LC/MS, ammonium acetate was added to both the acetonitrile and water phases at a concentration of 2 nM.
      <br/>
      Chromatography was not significantly affected.
      <br/>
      Eluant from the column was split 22:1, with the majority of the material directed to the PDA detector.
      <br/>
      The remaining 4.5% of the material was directed to the electrospray ionizing chamber of an Sciex API III mass spectrometer.
      <br/>
      Mass spectrometry was accomplished in positive mode.
      <br/>
      An analog data line from the PDA detector on the HPLC transferred a single wave length chromatogram to the mass spectrometer for coanalysis of the UV and MS data.
    </p>
    <p num="459">
      Mass spectrometric fragmentation patterns proved useful in sorting from among the hydroxylated substrates.
      <br/>
      The two expected hydroxylated canrenones, 11 ALPHA -hydroxy- and 9 ALPHA -hydroxy, lost water at different frequencies in a consistent manner which could be used as a diagnostic.
      <br/>
      Also, the 9 ALPHA -hydroxycanrenone formed an ammonium adduct more readily than did 11 ALPHA -hydroxycanrenone.
      <br/>
      Set forth in Table 35 is a summary of the TLC, HPLC/UV and LC/MS data for canrenone fermentation, showing which of the tested microorganism were effective in bioconversion of canrenone to 9 ALPHA -hydroxycanrenone.
      <br/>
      Of these preferred microorganism was Corynespora cassiicola ATCC 16718.

      A working cell bank of each of Aspergillus ochraceus NRRL 405 (ATCC 18500); Aspergillus niger ATCC 11394; Asperqillus nidulans ATCC 11267; Rhizopus oryzae ATCC 11145; Rhizoous stolonifer ATCC 6227b; Trichothecium roseum ATCC 12519 and ATCC 8685 was prepared essentially in the manner described in Example 4.
      <br/>
      Growth medium (50 ml) having the composition set forth in Table 18 was inoculated with a suspension of spores (1 ml) from the working cell bank and placed in an incubator.
      <br/>
      A seed culture was prepared in the incubator by fermentation at 26 (degree)  C. for about 20 hours.

      The incubator was agitated at a rate of 200 rpm.

      Aliquots (2 ml) of the seed culture of each microorganism were used to inoculate transformation flasks containing the growth medium (30 ml) of Table 15.
      <br/>
      Each culture was used for inoculation of two flasks, a total of 16.
      <br/>
      Androstendione (300 mg) was dissolved in methanol (6 ml) at 36 (degree)  C., and a 0.5 ml aliquot of this solution was introduced into each of the flasks.
      <br/>
      Bioconversion was carried out generally under the conditions described in Example 6 for 48 hours.
      <br/>
      After 48 hours samples of the broth were pooled and extracted with ethyl acetate as in Example 17.
      <br/>
      The ethyl acetate was concentrated by evaporation, and samples were analyzed by thin layer chromatography to determine whether a product having a chromatographic mobility similar to that of 11 ALPHA -hydroxy-androstendione standard (Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis) was present.

      Various microorganisms were tested for effectiveness in the conversion of mexrenone to 11 BETA -hydroxymexrenone.

      Fermentation media for this example were prepared as described in Table 34.

      <br/>
      The rationale for chromatographic analysis is as follows: 11 ALPHA -hydroxymexrenone and 11 ALPHA -hydroxycanrenone have the same chromatographic mobility. 11 ALPHA -hydroxycanrenone and 9 ALPHA -hydroxycanrenone exhibit the same mobility pattern as 11 ALPHA -hydroxyandrostendione and 11 BETA -hydroxyandrostendione.
      <br/>
      Therefore, 11 BETA -hydroxymexrenone should have the same mobility as 9 ALPHA -hydroxycanrenone.
      <br/>
      Therefore, compounds extracted from the growth media were run against 9 ALPHA -hydroxycanrenone as a standard.
