    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
    <p num="25">
      The present inventors have conducted intensive studies with the view toward attaining the objects of the present invention.
      <br/>
      As a result, they found that active acidic points densely present on the surface of the aforementioned composite metal-oxide catalysts contribute to widening an alkylene oxide adduct distribution of the product.
      <br/>
      Further, they found that the composite metal-oxide catalysts can be modified if the active acidic points densely present on the surface of the composite metal-oxide catalysts are selectively partial-poisoned by a metal hydroxide or a metal alkoxide.
      <br/>
      Based on the above findings, they have accomplished the present invention.
    </p>
    <p num="26">
      More specifically, the method of manufacturing a fatty acid ester of polyoxyalkylene alkyl ether according to the present invention comprises a step of reacting a fatty acid alkyl ester with an alkylene oxide in the presence of an composite metal-oxide catalyst whose surface is modified by a metal hydroxide or a metal alkoxide.
      <br/>
      Owing to this method, it is possible to obtain a fatty acid ester of polyoxyalkylene alkyl ether represented by the following formula (I), having a narrow alkylene oxide adduct distribution accompanied with a small amount of a remaining unreactive fatty acid alkyl ester.  (Chemical Structure image '7' not included in text)
    </p>
    <p num="27">wherein each of R1 and R3 independently represents an alkyl group or an alkenyl group, R2 represents an alkylene group, and n is a positive number.</p>
    <p num="28">
      In the fatty acid alkyl ester (R1 COOR3) used as a starting material of the present invention, R1 preferably has 3 to 40 carbon atoms, and more preferably 6 to 22.
      <br/>
      R3 preferably has 1 to 30 carbon atoms, and more preferably 1 to 4.
    </p>
    <p num="29">The alkyl group defined in the present invention includes also a group having a double bond in a carbon chain thereof (e.g. the so-called alkenyl group).</p>
    <p num="30">It is preferable that the alkylene oxide which is addition-polymerized to a fatty acid alkyl ester have 2 to 8 carbon atoms (the carbon number of R2 is 2 to 8), and it is particularly preferable that ethylene oxide or propylene oxide having 2 to 3 carbon atoms be used.</p>
    <p num="31">The fatty acid alkyl ester and the alkylene oxide can be subjected to the reaction singly or in the form of mixture of two or more members.</p>
    <p num="32">The composite metal-oxides to be used in the present invention include: a magnesium oxide added with at least one metal ion selected from the group consisting of Al (aluminum), Ga (gallium), Zr (zirconium), In (indium), Ti (thallium), Co (cobalt), Sc (scandium), La (lanthanum) and Mn (manganese); a calcined hydrotalcite which may be converted to an Al--Mg series composite metal-oxide; and a calcined aluminum magnesium hydroxide (a coprecipitate of aluminum hydroxide and magnesium hydroxide).</p>
    <p num="33">The amount of the metal ion to be added to magnesium oxide is preferably 0.1 to 30 wt % based on the composite metal-oxide amount.</p>
    <p num="34">
      In the case where the calcined aluminum magnesium hydroxide is particularly used as the composite metal-oxide, a large catalytic surface can be obtained.
      <br/>
      Consequently, when an alkylene oxide is addition-polymerized to a fatty acid alkyl ester, the catalytic activity of the calcined aluminum magnesium hydroxide is higher than that of other composite metal-oxides.
    </p>
    <p num="35">Use of the aluminum magnesium hydroxide as the composite metal-oxide is industrially advantageous since the aluminum magnesium hydroxide makes it possible to efficiently promote the addition-polymerization reaction in a predetermined manner and to easily separate the catalyst from the reaction product after completion of the reaction.</p>
    <p num="36">
      A method of manufacturing the metal-ion added magnesium oxide is disclosed in Jpn.
      <br/>
      Pat. Appln. KOKAI Publication No. 1-164437. It is desirable that the metal-ion added magnesium oxide particles be manufactured by precipitating the metal-ion to be added from an aqueous solution containing the metal ion by the following methods:
    </p>
    <p num="37">1) Dipping method: MgO particles are added to an aqueous solution containing a metal ion to be added, such as an aqueous aluminum nitrate solution, mixed well, evaporated to dryness, pulverized and calcined, resulting in the catalyst particles.</p>
    <p num="38">
      2) Coprecipitation method: an aqueous magnesium salt solution, such as an aqueous magnesium nitrate solution, is mixed with an aqueous solution containing a metal-ion to be added, such as an aluminum nitrate solution, and a precipitating agent such as ammonia is added thereto, thereby coprecipitating magnesium and the metal ion to be added as hydroxides in the aqueous solution.
      <br/>
      These hydroxides are filtered, washed, dried, pulverized, and calcined to prepare catalyst particles.
    </p>
    <p num="39">3) Deposition method: an aqueous solution containing a metal-ion to be added to magnesium particles is added to a dispersion in which magnesium oxide particles are dispersed, and a hydroxide of the metal to be added is allowed to precipitate and deposit on the surface of magnesium oxide particles, subsequently filtrated, dried, and calcined.</p>
    <p num="40">In the case where a catalyst is manufactured by the precipitation method such as the coprecipitation or deposition method, undesired anions present in a catalyst slurry obtained after completion or precipitation treatment can be removed by an ion exchange resin, so that a washing step following the filtration can be omitted or simplified.</p>
    <p num="41">
      A hydrotalcite is represented by the following Formula (II).
      <br/>
      A natural hydrotalcite and a synthetic hydrotalcite can be used.
      <br/>
      A calcined hydrotalcite as an Al--Mg system composite metal-oxide can be obtained by calcining a hydrotalcite.

    </p>
    <p num="45">The calcination temperature of the aluminum magnesium hydroxide is preferably 400 to 950 (degree)  C., more preferably 400 to 700 (degree)  C.</p>
    <p num="46">In the method of the present invention, a modified composite metal-oxide catalyst is obtained by reforming the surface of the composite metal-oxide with a metal hydroxide or a metal alkoxide,-and then subjected to the reaction for obtaining a fatty acid ester of polyoxyalkylene alkyl ether.</p>
    <p num="47">A preferable metal hydroxide is an alkoxide of an alkali metal or an alkali earth metal, and a more preferable metal hydroxide is sodium hydroxide or potassium hydroxide.</p>
    <p num="48">A preferably metal alkoxide is an alkoxide of an alkali metal or an alkali earth metal, and a more preferable metal alkoxide is sodium alkoxide or potassium alkoxide.</p>
    <p num="49">
      The modified composite metal-oxide catalyst is manufactured by reforming a composite metal-oxide such as magnesium oxide added with a metal ion, a calcined hydrotalcite, or a calcined aluminum magnesium hydroxide, with a hydroxide of an alkali metal or an alkali earth metal, or an alkoxide of an alkali metal or an alkali earth metal and then subjected to the reaction as a catalyst.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, the modified composite metal-oxide catalyst is manufactured, in a reaction vessel for use alkoxylation, by steps of adding a composite metal-oxide, and a metal hydroxide or a metal alkoxide to a fatty acid alkyl ester which is used as a starting material for producing a fatty acid ester of polyoxyalkylene alkyl ether, mixing them, and reforming the composite metal-oxide in the fatty acid alkyl ester, and the composite metal-oxide catalyst thus-modified is reacted with an alkylene oxide.
    </p>
    <p num="50">The former method of reforming a composite metal-oxide is not particularly limited and it is preferable that the composite metal oxide be dried and calcined after it is sprayed with an aqueous solution or an alcohol solution of a metal hydroxide or a metal alkoxide.</p>
    <p num="51">
      In the latter method, the addition order of a composite metal-oxide, and a metal hydroxide or a metal alkoxide to the starting fatty acid alkyl ester is not particularly restricted.
      <br/>
      In this case, it is preferable that the metal hydroxide or the metal alkoxide by dissolved in a lower alcohol and then added to the fatty acid alkyl ester since acidic points on a catalyst surface can be more uniformly and selectively partial-poisoned.
    </p>
    <p num="52">The metal hydroxide or the metal alkoxide for use in reforming the composite metal-oxide is preferably used in an amount of 1 to 10 wt % based on the composite metal oxide amount.</p>
    <p num="53">
      The reaction of the present invention can be easily performed according to a customary operational procedure under normal reaction conditions.
      <br/>
      The reaction temperature employed is preferably 80 to 230 (degree)  C., and more preferably 120 to 180 (degree)  C. The reaction pressure employed is preferably 20 atm or less, and more preferably 2 to 8 atm, although it is dependent on the reaction temperature.
    </p>
    <p num="54">The amount of the catalyst varies depending on a molar ratio of the alkylene oxide to the fatty acid alkyl ester subjected to the reaction, and the catalyst is generally preferred to add in an amount of 0.1 to 20 wt % based on a fatty acid alkyl ester amount.</p>
    <p num="55">
      The reaction of the present invention is performed, for example, in the following procedure: a fatty acid alkyl ester and a modified catalyst are placed in an autoclave.
      <br/>
      After degassing and dehydration are effected, an alkylene oxide is introduced in the autoclave and the fatty acid alkyl ester is allowed to react with the alkylene oxide at predetermined temperature, under predetermined pressure conditions in an nitrogen atmosphere.
      <br/>
      After completion of the reaction, the resultant solution is cooled and the catalyst is separated by filtration.
    </p>
    <p num="56">
      Alternatively, the reaction of the present invention can be performed as follows: a fatty acid alkyl ester and a composite metal-oxide are placed in an autoclave.
      <br/>
      Subsequently, a metal hydroxide or a metal alkoxide for use in reforming a catalyst is added thereto and mixed well, and the composite metal-oxide is reformed in the autoclave.
      <br/>
      Thereafter, degassing and dehydrating are effected in the same manner as above.
      <br/>
      Subsequently, an alkylene oxide is addition-polymerized at a predetermined temperature under a predetermined pressure conditions in a nitrogen atmosphere.

      An aqueous solution obtained by dissolving 30 g of aluminum nitrate in 87 g of water was added dropwise to a dispersion obtained by dispersing 70 g of MgO in 525 g of water and aged for 30 minutes to prepare a slurry.
      <br/>
      To this slurry, 263 cc of a strong-basic ion exchange resin (trade name:SA-20A available from Mitsubishi Kagaku Corp.) was added after being converted to an OH type resin by pretreatment.

      Consequently, NO3- was removed from the slurry.

      After completion of ion exchange, the ion exchange resin was separated from the slurry by means of a screen having a mesh size of 300  MU m. The resultant slurry was spray-dried, calcined for one hour at 600 (degree)  C., resulting in a composite metal-oxide powder, namely, an Al-ion added MgO.
