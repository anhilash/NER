    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">
      The present invention relates to the field of contact lens cleaning and disinfecting.
      <br/>
      In particular, this invention relates to liquid enzyme compositions and methods for cleaning human-worn contact lenses with those compositions.
      <br/>
      The invention also relates to methods of simultaneously cleaning and disinfecting contact lenses by combining the liquid enzyme compositions of the present invention with a chemical disinfecting agent.
    </p>
    <p num="3">
      Various compositions and methods for cleaning contact lenses have been described in the patent and scientific literature.
      <br/>
      Some of these methods have employed compositions containing surfactants or enzymes to facilitate the cleaning of lenses.
      <br/>
      The first discussion of the use of proteolytic enzymes to clean contact lenses was in an article by Lo, et al. in the Journal of The American Optometric Association, volume 40, pages 1106-1109 (1969).
      <br/>
      Methods of removing protein deposits from contact lenses by means of proteolytic enzymes have been described in many publications since the initial article by Lo, et al., including U.S. Pat. No. 3,910,296 (Karageozian, et al.).
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      Numerous compositions and methods for disinfecting contact lenses have also been described.
      <br/>
      Those methods may be generally characterized as involving the use of heat and/or chemical agents.
      <br/>
      Representative chemical agents for this purpose include organic antimicrobials such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidine, and inorganic antimicrobials such as hydrogen peroxide and peroxide-generating compounds. U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,407,791 and 4,525,346 (Stark) describe the use of polymeric quaternary ammonium compounds to disinfect contact lenses and to preserve contact lens care products. U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,758,595 and 4,836,986 (Ogunbiyi) describe the use of polymeric biguanides for the same purpose.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      Various methods for cleaning and disinfecting contact lenses at the same time have been proposed.
      <br/>
      Methods involving the combined use of proteolytic enzymes and peroxides to clean and disinfect contact lenses simultaneously, are described in U.S. Pat. No. Re 32,672 (Huth, et al.).
      <br/>
      A representative method of simultaneously cleaning and disinfecting contact lenses involving the use of proteolytic enzymes and quaternary ammonium compounds is described in Japanese Patent Publication 57-24526 (Boghosian, et al.).
      <br/>
      The combined use of a biguanide (i.e., chlorhexidine) and liquid enzyme compositions to simultaneously clean and disinfect contact lenses is described in Canadian Patent No. 1,150,907 (Ludwig, et al.).
      <br/>
      Methods involving the combined use of dissolved proteolytic enzymes to clean and heat to disinfect are described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,614,549 (Ogunbiyi).
      <br/>
      The combined use of proteolytic enzymes and polymeric biguanides or polymeric quaternary ammonium compounds is described in copending, commonly assigned U.S. patent application Ser.
      <br/>
      No. 08/156,043 and in corresponding European Patent Application Publication No. 0 456 467 A2 (Rosenthal, et al.), as well as in U.S. Pat. No. 5,096,607 (Mowrey-McKee, et al.).
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      The commercial viability of most prior enzymatic cleaning products has depended on the use of stable enzyme tablets.
      <br/>
      More specifically, the use of solid enzymatic cleaning compositions has been necessary to ensure stability of the enzymes prior to use.
      <br/>
      In order to use such compositions, a separate packet containing a tablet must be opened, the tablet must be placed in a separate vial containing a solution, and the tablet must be dissolved in order to release the enzyme into the solution.
      <br/>
      This practice is usually performed only once a week due to the cumbersome and tedious procedure and potential for irritation and toxicity.
      <br/>
      Moreover, the enzymatic cleaning tablets contain a large amount of excipients, such as effervescent agents (e.g., bicarbonate) and bulking agents (e.g., sodium chloride).
      <br/>
      As explained below, such excipients can adversely affect both cleaning and disinfection of the contact lenses.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      There have been prior attempts to use liquid enzyme compositions to clean contact lenses.
      <br/>
      However, those attempts have been hampered by the fact that aqueous liquid enzyme compositions are inherently unstable.
      <br/>
      When a proteolytic enzyme is placed in an aqueous solution for an extended period (i.e., several months or more), the enzyme may lose all or a substantial portion of its proteolytic activity.
      <br/>
      Steps can be taken to stabilize the compositions, but the use of stabilizing agents may have an adverse effect on the activity of the enzyme.
      <br/>
      For example, stabilizing agents can protect enzymes from chemical instability problems during storage in an aqueous liquid, by placing the enzymes in a dormant physical conformation.
      <br/>
      In addition to the general problems referred to above, a commercially viable liquid enzyme preparation for treating contact lenses must be relatively nontoxic, and must be compatible with other chemical agents used in treating contact lenses, particularly antimicrobial agents utilized to disinfect the lenses.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      The following patents may be referred to for further background concerning prior attempts to stabilize liquid enzyme formulations: U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,462,922 (Boskamp); 4,537,706 (Severson); and 5,089,163 (Aronson).
      <br/>
      These patents describe detergent compositions containing enzymes.
      <br/>
      The detergent compositions may be used to treat laundry, as well as other industrial uses.
      <br/>
      Such detergents are not appropriate for treating contact lenses.
      <br/>
      The compositions of the present invention do not contain a detergent, or other agents potentially damaging or irritating to the eye.

      <br/>
      The compositions of the present invention are believed to provide significant improvements relative to the compositions described in those publications.

    <heading>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading>
    <p num="11">FIG. 1 is a graph comparing the proteolytic stability of a liquid enzyme composition of the present invention with other compositions, at 40 (degree)  C. through 12 weeks.</p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="12">
      The liquid enzyme compositions of the present invention contain critical amounts of selected stabilizing agents.
      <br/>
      The stabilizing agents utilized are calcium ion, a monomeric polyol and a borate/boric acid compound.
      <br/>
      The amounts of stabilizing agents utilized have been delicately balanced, such that maximum stability is achieved, while maximum activity is later obtained when the composition is put into use.
      <br/>
      A suitable preservative may also be added to the liquid enzyme compositions of the present invention to preserve the liquid enzyme compositions from microbial contamination when the compositions are packaged in multiple use containers.
    </p>
    <p num="13">
      The present invention also provides methods for cleaning contact lenses with the above-described liquid enzyme compositions.
      <br/>
      In order to clean a soiled lens, the lens is placed in a few milliliters of an aqueous solution and a small amount, generally one to two drops, of the enzyme composition is added to the solution.
      <br/>
      The lens is then soaked in the resultant cleaning solution for a time sufficient to clean the lens.
    </p>
    <p num="14">
      The liquid enzyme compositions of the present invention are preferably combined with an aqueous disinfecting solution to simultaneously clean and disinfect contact lenses.
      <br/>
      The compositions and methods of the present invention provide greater ease of use.
      <br/>
      This ease of use enables contact lens users to clean their lenses 2 to 3 times a week, or more preferably, every day.
      <br/>
      It has been found that daily use of the liquid enzyme compositions of the present invention results in dramatically better cleaning and safety, as compared to the once-a-week enzyme cleaning regimens currently being utilized.
    </p>
    <p num="15">
      The enzyme compositions of the present invention are formulated as concentrated, multi-dose liquids, which provide a significantly improved enzyme stability profile.
      <br/>
      This improved stability allows the liquid compositions to have greater shelf life and the option of being commercially transported without refrigeration.
    </p>
    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="16">
      It has been discovered that liquid enzyme compositions containing a particular combination of ingredients, and in particular concentrations, provides a significantly improved enzyme stability profile over prior liquid enzyme compositions.
      <br/>
      The liquid enzyme compositions of the present invention are comprised of an enzyme, stabilizing agents and water.
      <br/>
      The stabilizing agents required by the present invention are a monomeric polyol, calcium ion and a borate/boric acid compound.
    </p>
    <p num="17">
      As used herein, the term "monomeric polyol" refers to a compound with 2 to 6 carbon atoms and at least two hydroxy groups.
      <br/>
      Examples of monomeric polyols are glycerol, propylene glycol, ethylene glycol, sorbitol and mannitol.
      <br/>
      Preferably, the monomeric polyols are selected from polyols having 2-3 carbons and at least two hydroxy groups ("2-3 carbon polyol").
      <br/>
      Examples of 2-3 carbon polyols are glycerol, 1,2-propane diol ("propylene glycol"), 1,3-propane diol and ethylene glycol.
      <br/>
      Glycerol and propylene glycol are the most preferred 2-3 carbon polyols.
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      The monomeric polyol amounts will vary depending on the particular polyol used.
      <br/>
      In general, liquid enzyme compositions of the present invention will require 40 to 85% weight/volume ("% w/v") of a polyol to achieve the necessary criteria for efficacious and commercially viable liquid enzyme compositions, as described above.
      <br/>
      While any of the polyols can be components of the compositions of the present invention, particular polyols may be used depending on the particular intended use.
      <br/>
      For example, propylene glycol, which has preservative activity, is a preferred polyol when the need for an additional preservative present in a liquid enzyme composition of the present invention is desired.
      <br/>
      The most preferred combination of polyols used in the compositions of the present invention are glycerol and propylene glycol.
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      The liquid enzyme compositions of the present invention will also contain an effective amount of calcium ion.
      <br/>
      The calcium ion contained in the compositions of the present invention may be obtained by the addition of various calcium salts.
      <br/>
      For example, the calcium ion source may be obtained from calcium chloride, calcium acetate and calcium ascorbate or other water soluble salts of calcium.
      <br/>
      The most preferred calcium ion source is calcium chloride.
      <br/>
      As used herein, "effective amount of calcium ion" refers to that amount of calcium ion which enhances the proteolytic stability of an enzyme in the liquid enzyme compositions of the present invention.
      <br/>
      While that amount will vary depending upon the various components present, typical calcium ion concentrations will be about 1 to 90 millimolar.
      <br/>
      Preferred concentrations will be about 4.5 to 45 millimolar, and most preferred concentrations will be of from 10 to 25 millimolar.
    </p>
    <p num="20">
      The compositions of the present invention will also contain an effective amount of a borate/boric acid compound.
      <br/>
      As used herein, "borate/boric acid compound" refers to an inorganic compound comprising boron and one or more oxygen groups, and which is either in acid or base form when dissolved in a composition of the present invention.
      <br/>
      Sources of borate/boric acid compounds include alkali metal salts of borate, boric acid and borax.
      <br/>
      As used herein, "effective amount of a borate/boric acid compound" refers to that amount of a borate/boric acid compound contained in a liquid enzyme composition of the present invention which enhances the proteolytic stability of the enzyme.
      <br/>
      While such an amount will vary depending on other components present in the concentrate, the amount will be about 0.3 to 8.0% (w/v).
      <br/>
      Preferred amounts will be of from 0.5 to 1.5% (w/v).
      <br/>
      The borate/boric acid compound may also contribute to the anti-microbial preservation of the liquid enzyme compositions of the present invention to a level effective for multi-use dispensing.
      <br/>
      The solubility of the borate/boric acid compound may be limited in water.
      <br/>
      The solubility of these compounds, however, may be increased by increasing the amount of polyol employed.
    </p>
    <p num="21">
      A variety of preservatives may be employed to preserve liquid enzyme compositions of the present invention intended for multi-dispensing.
      <br/>
      In general, any of the disinfecting agents listed below for use in the disinfecting solutions of the methods of the present invention, with the exception of oxidative disinfecting agents, may be used.
      <br/>
      Particularly preferred, are the polymeric quaternary ammonium compounds, the most preferred is polyquaternium-1.
      <br/>
      The amount of preservative used will depend on several factors including the anti-microbial efficacy of the particular agent and any synergistic interaction the agent may have with the liquid enzyme composition.
      <br/>
      In general, 0.0001 to 0.1% w/v of the preservative agent will be used.
    </p>

      The most preferred enzymes of the present invention are the alkyl trypsins.
      <br/>
      It has been discovered that alkyl trypsins ("Al-trypsin(s)") are more stable in the liquid compositions than the native trypsin, or other native enzymes.
    </p>
    <p num="33">
      As used herein, "Al-trypsin" refers to a covalently modified trypsin wherein one or more of its lysine epsilon-amino groups has been mono-alkylated or di-alkylated to form the corresponding monoalkylamino or dialkylamino group.
      <br/>
      The alkyl group attached to the amine may be a primary or branched C-12 group.
      <br/>
      Preferred Al-trypsins of the present invention are those wherein the alkyl group is a primary or branched C1-4 group.
      <br/>
      Alkylation of trypsin is generally performed by reductive alkylation.
      <br/>
      The degree of alkylation of the lysine epsilon-amino groups will de pend on the reaction conditions of the reductive alkylation process.
      <br/>
      For example, if the reaction cycle is repeated a number of times and/or a higher reagent to enzyme ratio is used, then full alkylation, i.e., alkylation of all of the lysine epsilon-amino groups, will tend to be achieved.
      <br/>
      Al-trypsins of the present invention will preferably be fully dialkylyated at all of their lysine epsilon-amino groups.
      <br/>
      The most preferred Al-trypsin is methyl trypsin ("Me-trypsin").
      <br/>
      The most preferred Me-trypsin of the present invention will be derived from porcine tissue sources and will be fully dimethylated, as described above.

      <br/>
      The alkylimino product (2) reduces to the resonant alkylamino species (3,4).
      <br/>
      The product (3,4) may react with another mole of the alkylating reagent (1) to yield the dialkylamino trypsin (5).

      The liquid enzyme compositions of the present invention will have an enzyme concentration sufficient to provide an effective amount of enzyme to remove substantially or to reduce significantly deposits of proteins, lipids, mucopolysaccharides and other materials typically found on human-worn contact lenses when a small amount of a composition is added to a diluent.
      <br/>
      As used herein, such a concentration is referred to as "an amount effective to clean the lens." The amount of enzyme used in the liquid enzyme compositions of the present invention will generally range from about 0.05 to 5% w/v.
      <br/>
      The selection of a specific concentration will depend on various factors, such as: the enzyme or combination of enzymes selected; the purity, specificity and efficacy of the enzyme(s) selected; the type of lenses to be cleaned; the intended frequency of cleaning (e.g., daily or weekly); and the intended duration of each cleaning.

      The cleaning obtained with the liquid enzyme compositions of the present invention is a function of the time.

      The soaking times utilized will generally vary from about 1 hour to overnight.

      However, if longer soaking periods (e.g., 24 hours) were to be employed, lower concentrations than those described above can be utilized.

      The cleaning methods of the present invention involve the use of a small amount of the above-described liquid enzyme compositions to facilitate the removal of proteins and other deposits from contact lenses.

      The amount of enzyme composition utilized in particular embodiments of the present invention may vary, depending on various factors, such as the purity of the enzyme utilized, the proposed duration of exposure of lenses to the compositions, the nature of the lens care regimen (e.g., the frequency of lens disinfection and cleaning), the type of lens being treated, and the use of adjunctive cleaning agents (e.g., surfactants).
      <br/>
      However, the cleaning methods of the present invention will generally employ an amount of the above-described liquid enzyme compositions sufficient to provide a final enzyme concentration of about 1-100 PAU/mL, following dispersion of the liquid enzyme compositions in a disinfecting solution or other aqueous solvent.

      A final concentration of about 5-25 PAU/mL is preferred.

    <p num="50">
      As indicated above, the liquid enzyme compositions of the present invention contain relatively minor amounts of ionic solutes.
      <br/>
      More specifically, the compositions do not contain bulking agents, effervescent agents or other ionic solutes commonly contained in prior enzyme tablets.
      <br/>
      The present compositions do contain the ionic solutes of borate or boric acid compounds and hydrochloric acid and/or sodium hydroxide, but the concentration of these solutes in the present compositions is relatively low.
      <br/>
      The compositions are therefore substantially nonionic.
      <br/>
      Moreover, as a result of the fact that the compositions are formulated as concentrated, multi-dose liquids, only a small amount of the compositions, generally one or two drops, is required to clean a contact lens.
      <br/>
      The present compositions therefore have very little impact on the ionic strength of disinfecting solutions.
      <br/>
      As explained below, this feature of the present invention is particularly important when the liquid enzyme compositions are combined with disinfecting solutions which contain ionic antimicrobial agents, such as polyquatemium- 1.
    </p>
    <p num="51">
      The antimicrobial activity of disinfecting agents, particularly polymeric quaternary ammonium compounds such as polyquatemium-1, is adversely affected by high concentrations of sodium chloride or other ionic solutes.
      <br/>
      More specifically, polymeric quaternary ammonium compounds, and particularly those of Formula (I), below, lose antimicrobial activity when the concentration of ionic solutes in the disinfecting solution is increased.
      <br/>
      The use of solutions having low ionic strengths (i.e., low concentrations of ionic solutes such as sodium chloride) is therefore preferred.
      <br/>
      Since both ionic solutes (e.g., sodium chloride) and nonionic solutes (e.g., glycerol) affect the osmolality and tonicity of a solution, osmolality and tonicity are indirect measures of ionic strength.
      <br/>
      However, the low ionic strengths preferably utilized in the cleaning and disinfecting methods of the present invention generally correspond to tonicities/osmolalities in the range of hypotonic to isotonic, and more preferably in the range of 150 to 350 milliOsmoles per kilogram (mOs/kg).
      <br/>
      A range of 200 to 300 mOs/kg is particularly preferred, and an osmolality of about 220 mOs/kg is most preferred.

      The following Examples (5-7) illustrate enzyme stability as a function of enzyme vity.
      <br/>
      Enzyme activity was ascertained by the following azocasein method:
    </p>
    <p num="93">Azocasein Method:</p>
    <p num="94">The following solutions are used in this assay:</p>
    <p num="95">1) Buffer solution: 0.05 M sodium phosphate buffer containing 0.9% sodium chloride, pH 7.6.</p>
    <p num="96">2) Substrate solution: 2 mg/ml azocasein in the buffer solution mentioned above.</p>
    <p num="97">
      The assay is initiated by mixing 1 ml of an appropriately diluted (such that the enzyme activity is in the range of standard curve) enzyme composition in phosphate buffer with 2 ml of azocasein substrate solution (2 mg/ml).
      <br/>
      Afier incubation at 37 (degree)  C. for 20 minutes, the mixture is removed from the incubator and 1 ml of trichloroacetic acid (14% w/v) is added to stop the enzyme reaction.
      <br/>
      The mixture is vortexed well and allowed to stand at room temperature for 20 minutes.
      <br/>
      After centrifuging at 2500 rpm (with a Beckman GS-6R Centrifuge) for 15 minutes, the supernatant is filtered with a serum sampler. 2 ml of the clear yellow filtrate is then adjusted to a neutral pH with 2.0 ml of 0.5 N sodium hydroxide and the absorbance of 440 nm wavelength light is measured with a spectrophotometer.
      <br/>
      The amount of azocasein hydrolyzed is calculated based on a standard curve of known concentrations of azocasein solution developed under identical conditions.
      <br/>
      An enzyme activity unit ("AZ U") is defined as that amount of enzyme which hydrolyzes 1  MU g of azocasein substrate/minute at 37 (degree)  C.

    <p num="110">
      The disinfecting efficacy of the cleaning and disinfecting methods of the present invention was evaluated by determining the rate and extent of kill achieved with the multi-purpose solution prepared from the Example 2A and 2B compositions.
      <br/>
      The multi-purpose solution was tested against Serratia marcescens, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Candida albicans and Fusarium solani.
      <br/>
      The test procedures and results are described below.
    </p>
    <p num="111">The following procedure was used:</p>
    <p num="112">
      A 0.1 mL volume of inoculum (108 colony forming units/mL) was first added to a 10 mL volume of the disinfecting solution of Example 2B, followed by the addition of 2 drops (1 drop equals about 30-40  MU L using a "Droptainer") of the liquid enzyme composition of Example 2A.
      <br/>
      A similarly inoculated 10 mL volume of the disinfecting solution of Example 2B was used as a control.
      <br/>
      The solutions were maintained at room temperature throughout the test.
      <br/>
      Each microorganism and test solution was tested individually.
      <br/>
      Sets of four replicate (n=8) samples were tested for each organism.
    </p>
    <p num="113">
      At selected time intervals of 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 24 and 168 hours, a I mL volume of the inoculated test solution containing Serratia marcescens, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Candida albicans and Fusarium solani was removed and appropriate serial dilutions were made in sterile 0.9% sodium chloride solution dilution blanks.
      <br/>
      Pour-plates were prepared with soybean-casein digest agar containing 0.07% Asolectin and 0.5% Polysorbate 80.
      <br/>
      At Time 0, a 1.0 mL volume of the saline control was removed and serial dilution pour-plates were prepared using the same recovery medium and dilution blanks.
      <br/>
      The Time 0 saline control count was used as the initial count.
      <br/>
      The pour-plates were incubated at 30-35 (degree)  C. for appropriate incubation periods.
      <br/>
      The number of surviving organisms at each time interval was then determined.
