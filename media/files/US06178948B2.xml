      A throttle lever assembly for controlling the air intake of a throttle body of an internal combustion engine includes a return cam secured to an end of a throttle shaft.
      <br/>
      The return cam, formed of a planar metal plate, has a channel disposed about a portion of its periphery for receiving an accelerator cable.
      <br/>
      The channel is formed of alternately offset fingers having fluke-shaped end portions to provide substantially continuous walls of the channel and a cable seat formed of alternately offset fingers.
      <br/>
      In addition, the return cam may include a cruise stud extending axially from the outer surface of the cam return, an idle stop lever and a wide open stop lever.

    <heading>TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
    <p num="1">The present invention relates to a throttle lever assembly for controlling the delivery of air to the combustion chamber of an internal combustion engine.</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">
      In a conventional air/fuel system for an internal combustion engine, a throttle body assembly provides a means for controlling the air provided to the engine in response to the operator's actuation of an accelerator pedal or command from a cruise control system.
      <br/>
      Generally, the throttle body includes a lever assembly mounted pivotally to a throttle housing that controls the opening of a throttle valve.
      <br/>
      The degree of rotation of the lever assembly is directly proportional to the opening of the throttle valve which provides air to the engine.
    </p>
    <p num="3">
      Typically, the throttle lever assembly has a number of components and subassemblies attached to a throttle shaft, each of which perform a specific function.
      <br/>
      One such subassembly is a return cam mounted to one end of the shaft.
      <br/>
      The return cam alters the engine's acceleration in response to input provided by the operator.
      <br/>
      The return cam may be formed of plastic molded onto a metal insert, or two metal pieces joined together.
      <br/>
      The return cam includes a U-shaped channel for receiving an accelerator cable which has another end interconnected to the accelerator pedal.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      When the accelerator pedal is depressed, the cable is retracted to rotate the lever assembly to open the throttle valve which increases the amount of air provided to the engine.
      <br/>
      The lever assembly is rotated back to its initial or idle position by a return spring when the accelerator pedal is released or pressure on the pedal is reduced.
      <br/>
      The spring is maintained coaxially about the shaft by a spring retainer mounted to the shaft inboard of the throttle cam.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      An idle stop lever extends radially from the shaft and is oriented such that the throttle valve is opened a small amount to the idle or shipping air position when the idle stop lever engages an idle stop screw threaded within a depending member of the housing.
      <br/>
      The idle stop screw is used to adjust the idle position of the lever assembly.
      <br/>
      The idle stop lever may also include a second engagement surface to provide a wide open throttle stop for the shaft and lever assembly.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      The lever assembly may also include a cruise control lever mounted to the end of the shaft, abutting the outer surface of the return cam.
      <br/>
      The cruise control lever extends radially from the shaft at a predetermined angle and distance to engage a cable or linkage of the cruise control system which provides control of the throttle body independent of the operator input.
      <br/>
      A stud extends axially outward from the end of the idle lever to provide a means to engage the linkage or cable of the cruise control system.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      This throttle lever assembly functions adequately for its intended purpose, however, the assembly is complex, requiring a number of discrete parts.
      <br/>
      Consequently, the process of manufacturing and assembling the throttle lever assembly is costly and time consuming.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      For instance, the traditional process of manufacturing and assembling the throttle lever assembly described heretofore includes the steps of independently manufacturing each of the subassemblies.
      <br/>
      For the cruise lever assembly, the stud is machined on a screw machine and the cruise lever is stamped on a punch press.

    <heading>DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading>
    <p num="15">
      Referring to FIG. 1, a throttle lever assembly in accordance with the present invention is generally designated 10.
      <br/>
      The throttle lever assembly 10 is shown as a subassembly of a throttle body 12 which includes a throttle housing 14 having an air intake opening 16 for providing air to the combustion chambers of an internal combustion engine (not shown).
      <br/>
      The throttle lever assembly 10 comprises a return cam 18 secured to a first end 20 of a shaft 22 that has a second end 24 pivotally engaged with the throttle housing 14 through the intake opening 16.
      <br/>
      A circular vane 26 is secured within an axial slot 28 (see FIG. 2) disposed in the second end 24 of the shaft 22 to provide valving action for the air intake opening 16 when the shaft is rotated.
      <br/>
      In the idle position (shown in FIG. 1), the vane 26 is in a slightly open position, and in the wide open position, the vane is in a predetermined open position.
    </p>
    <p num="16">
      The rotation of the throttle lever assembly 10 is controlled by the operator or a cruise control system (not shown).
      <br/>
      The operator controls the rotation of the lever assembly 10 by depressing an accelerator pedal (not shown), which pulls an accelerator cable 30 that is attached to the return cam 18.
      <br/>
      Similarly, the cruise control system is interconnected to the lever assembly 10 by a second cable or linkage 32.
      <br/>
      When the cruise control system is actuated by the operator, the system pulls the second cable 32 to rotate the throttle lever assembly 10 to a position set by the operator.
      <br/>
      A return spring 34 disposed coaxially about the shaft 22 returns the lever assembly 10 back to the idle position (as shown in FIG. 1) when the operator or cruise control system reduces tension on their respective cables 30, 32 to close the throttle valve 26.
    </p>
    <p num="17">
      Referring to FIG. 2, the return cam 18, formed of a planar metal plate (i.e. steel), includes a planar body portion 36 defined by inner and outer radial surfaces 38, 40.
      <br/>
      A generally U-shaped or V-shaped channel 42 is disposed along an eccentric portion of the outer periphery 44 of the body portion 36 of the return cam 18.
      <br/>
      The channel 42 opens radially outward for receiving the accelerator cable 30 (see FIG. 1).
      <br/>
      The body portion 36 of the return cam 18 includes a bore 46 having a shape complementary to the cross section of the first end 20 of the shaft 22 which is circular having a pair of opposing milled planar surfaces 52 which prevents rotational translation of the return cam 18 relative to the shaft 22.
      <br/>
      The shaft 22 is secured to the return cam 18 by spinning over the first end 20 of the shaft 22 extending through the bore 46 at 53 to prevent axial translation of the return cam 18.
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      As best shown in FIGS. 2 and 3, the channel 42 of the return cam 18 is formed of a plurality of alternately offset fingers 54.
      <br/>
      The fingers 54 are offset sufficiently to ensure that the channel 42 can receive and retain the accelerator cable 30 (see FIG. 1) during the operation of the lever assembly 10.
      <br/>
      The ends of the fingers 54 are also swaged to provide flukes 56 wherein the expansion of the fingers substantially reduces or eliminates the spacing 58 between the flukes 56 of the adjacent offset fingers 54 to provide a pair of substantially continuous walls 60 of the channel 42.
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      As best shown in FIGS. 2 and 4, a seat 62 is provided to secure a cylindrical anchor 64 that is fixedly attached to the end of the accelerator cable 30.
      <br/>
      The seat 62 comprises three consecutive fingers 66-68 located at one end 70 of the channel 42.
      <br/>
      Similar to fingers 54, the ends of fingers 66-68 are swaged to form flukes 56.
      <br/>
      The width of these fingers 66-68 are greater than the width of the other fingers 54 that form the channel 42 so as to provide a sufficient space 72 between fingers 66, 68 to permit installation of the accelerator cable 30 and anchor 64 into the seat 62.
      <br/>
      The centrally-disposed finger 67 of the seat 62 includes a bore 76 opposing the space 72.
      <br/>
      The bore 76 has a diameter greater than that of the anchor 64 to retain and permit rotation of the anchor therein.
      <br/>
      Similarly, the space 72 between adjacent fingers 66, 68 of the seat 62 must be sufficiently close to retain the anchor 64 therebetween.
      <br/>
      The spacing 73 between the flukes 56 of fingers 66 and 68 must be greater than the gauge of the accelerator cable 30.
      <br/>
      The accelerator cable 30 is attached to the seat 62 of the return cam 18 by inserting the anchor 64 between fingers 66 and 68 and into the cavity defined by the bore 76 and spacing 72.
      <br/>
      The cable 18 then rides within the channel 42 of the return cam 18.
    </p>
    <p num="20">
      As shown in FIG. 1, the return cam 18 may include an idle stop lever 80 and a wide open stop lever 82 integrally extending therefrom.
      <br/>
      These stop levers 80, 82 engage a depending member 84 of the throttle housing 14 to limit the rotation of the throttle lever assembly 10 between the idle stop position and the wide open position.
      <br/>
      The idle stop lever 80 extends axially towards the housing 14 for engagement with an idle stop screw 86 threaded through the depending member 84.
      <br/>
      The screw 86 is adjustable to change the idle stop limit of the return cam 18.
      <br/>
      The idle stop lever 80 also engages the free end 90 of the return spring 34.
      <br/>
      The spring provides a rotational force against the idle stop lever 80 urging the return cam 18 back to the idle stop position.
    </p>
    <p num="21">Similarly, the wide open stop lever 82 extends axially towards the housing 14, from the return cam 18, opposite the channel 42 at an appropriate angle to engage the depending member 84 of the housing 14 at the wide open position.</p>
    <p num="22">
      The throttle housing 14 and the inner radial surface 38 of the planar body portion 36 of the return cam 18 maintain the return spring 34 in relative coaxial relation to the throttle shaft 22.
      <br/>
      One end (not shown) of the return spring 34 is retained in the throttle housing 14 while the free end 90 engages the idle stop lever 80 and planar body portion 36.
      <br/>
      The planar body portion 36 extends a sufficient distance radially about the shaft 22 mounted thereto to ensure the spring 34 does not contact the offset fingers 54.
      <br/>
      Referring to FIGS. 1-3, a cruise stud 98 may be attached to one of the fingers 54 of the channel 42 of the return cam 18 for receiving the cruise control cable or linkage 32.
      <br/>
      Preferably, the cruise stud 98 projects axially outward from the return cam 18 and has an end cap 100 to retain the cruise control cable or linkage 32 attached thereto.
      <br/>
      The location of the stud 98 about the periphery of the return cam 18 is determined by the location of the cruise control system relative to the return cam 18.
    </p>
    <p num="23">
      An important feature of the present invention is the simplicity of forming the return cam 18 from a single planar metal plate blank 102.
      <br/>
      The return cam 18 is shown in FIG. 5 at a stage of manufacturing thereof.
      <br/>
      The plate blank 102 includes a plurality of relief cuts 104 disposed radially along the outer edge 106 of the return cam 18 which define the fingers 54 of the channel 42 and fingers 66-68 of the seat 62 for retaining the anchor 64.
      <br/>
      Finger 67 also includes a bore 76 for retaining the anchor 64.
      <br/>
      The planar plate blank 102 is also shaped to provide radially extending members 110, 112 which define the idle stop and wide open stop levers 80, 82, respectively of FIG. 1.
      <br/>
      The plate blank 102 is then stamped to alternately offset and expand the fingers 54, 66-68 that form the channel 42 and seat 62, as shown in FIGS. 2 and 3.
      <br/>
      If the return cam 18 is intended to be used with an engine having a cruise control system, the cruise stud 98, is mounted to the outer surface 40 of the return cam 18.
      <br/>
      Generally, the cruise stud is attached to a fluke 56 of one of the fingers 54 at the midpoint of the channel 42.
    </p>
    <p num="24">
      In the embodiment of the present invention shown in FIG. 1, each component of the throttle lever assembly 10 is integrated into a single return cam 18, however, one would recognize that integration of any combination of less than all of these components is possible.
      <br/>
      For example, the stop levers 80, 82 may be only integrated into the return cam 18, and the cruise stud 98 may only be integrated with the return cam 18.
