      <br/>
      A hook and unhooking coupling device for enabling a user to easily attach or remove a latch hook from a boat or other object.
      <br/>
      The inventive device includes a pole member, and an engaging member having an opening and a tongue member secured to the distal end of the pole.
      <br/>
      The engaging member comprises a first member secured to a second member having an open V-shaped cross sectional area.
      <br/>
      A first edge is secured to the first member and a second edge is secured to the second member while leaving the opening unobstructed.
      <br/>
      The engaging member is removably positionable about the eyelet member of a latch hook for opening the spring latch while simultaneously retaining the latch hook firmly thereby allowing the user to manipulate the pole member so that the latch hook is positioned about a desired hook.
      <br/>
      After the latch hook is positioned about the desired hook, the user then manually pulls the engaging member from the latch hook thereby allowing the spring latch to close thereby preventing the latch hook from being accidentally removed.
      <br/>
      To remove a latch hook from a hook, the user simply reverses this process.

    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="1">
      1.
      <br/>
      Field of the Invention
    </p>
    <p num="2">The present invention relates generally to latch hooks and more specifically it relates to a hook and unhooking coupling device for enabling a user to easily attach or remove a latch hook from a boat or other object.</p>
    <p num="3">2. Description of the Prior Art</p>
    <p num="4">
      Latch hooks have been in use for years.
      <br/>
      Typically, a latch hook comprises a hook member, a eyelet member attached to the lower end of the hook member, and a spring latch pivotally attached to the hook member.
      <br/>
      A rope or cable is typically attached within the eyelet.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      The user typically has to manually grasp the hook member while simultaneously retaining the spring latch open to attach or remove the hook member from a hook upon a boat or other structure to be retained.
      <br/>
      This can be extremely burdensome and cumbersome for the user who must often times physically extend themselves to place the hook member about a hook.
      <br/>
      In addition, the user must sometimes enter the water to connect the hook member with the hook.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      While these devices may be suitable for the particular purpose to which they address, they are not as suitable for enabling a user to easily attach or remove a latch hook from a boat or other object.
      <br/>
      There currently is no system to easily attach or remove a latch hook from a boat.
    </p>
    <p num="7">In these respects, the hook and unhooking coupling device according to the present invention substantially departs from the conventional concepts and designs of the prior art, and in so doing provides an apparatus primarily developed for the purpose of enabling a user to easily attach or remove a latch hook from a boat or other object.</p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="8">In view of the foregoing disadvantages inherent in the known types of latch hooks now present in the prior art, the present invention provides a new hook and unhooking coupling device construction wherein the same can be utilized for enabling a user to easily attach or remove a latch hook from a boat or other object.</p>
    <p num="9">The general purpose of the present invention, which will be described subsequently in greater detail, is to provide a new hook and unhooking coupling device that has many of the advantages of the latch hooks mentioned heretofore and many novel features that result in a new hook and unhooking coupling device which is not anticipated, rendered obvious, suggested, or even implied by any of the prior art latch hooks, either alone or in any combination thereof.</p>
    <p num="10">

    </p>
    <heading>DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading>
    <p num="22">
      Turning now descriptively to the drawings, in which similar reference characters denote similar elements throughout the several view, FIGS. 1 through 4 illustrate a hook and unhooking coupling device 10, which comprises a pole member 20, and an engaging member 30 having an opening and a tongue member 33 secured to the distal end of the pole member 20.
      <br/>
      The engaging member 30 comprises a first member 32 secured to a second member 34 having an open V-shaped cross sectional area.
      <br/>
      A first edge 36 is secured to the first member 32 and a second edge 38 is secured to the second member 34 while leaving the opening unobstructed.
      <br/>
      The engaging member 30 is removably positionable about the eyelet member 16 of a latch hook 12 for opening the spring latch 18 while simultaneously retaining the latch hook 12 firmly thereby allowing the user to manipulate the pole member 20 so that the latch hook 12 is positioned about a desired hook.
      <br/>
      After the latch hook 12 is positioned about the desired hook, the user then manually pulls the engaging member 30 from the latch hook 12 thereby allowing the spring latch 18 to close thereby preventing the latch hook 12 from being accidentally removed.
      <br/>
      To remove a latch hook 12 from a hook, the user simply reverses this process.
    </p>
    <p num="23">
      As shown in FIGS. 1 and 2, the latch hook 12 includes an eyelet member 16 that is attachable to a rope 14 or cable.
      <br/>
      A spring latch 18 is attached to the latch hook 12 either adjacent to or upon the eyelet as best shown in FIG. 1 of the drawings.
      <br/>
      The spring latch 18 is normally in a closed position thereby preventing the latch hook 12 from being accidentally removed from a hook upon a boat or other object.
    </p>
    <p num="24">
      As shown in FIGS. 1 through 3 of the drawings, a pole member 20 is provided having a significant length of between two to thirty feet long.
      <br/>
      The pole member 20 is comprised of any well-known material, but is preferably constructed of a relatively lightweight material such as tubular aluminum.
    </p>
    <p num="25">
      An engaging member 30 is provided that is secured to a distal end of the pole member 20 as shown in FIGS. 1 and 2 of the drawings.
      <br/>
      The engaging member 30 includes a tongue member 33 that is attachable to the pole by at least one conventional fastener 31.
    </p>
    <p num="26">
      The engaging member 30 further comprises a first member 32 and a second member 34 connected to form a structure having a V-shaped cross-sectional area.
      <br/>
      A first edge 36 and a second edge 38 are connected to the first member 32 and second member 34 respectively as shown in FIGS. 1 and 2 of the drawings.
      <br/>
      The space between the first edge 36 and the second edge 38 defines an elongated opening that is larger than the rope 14 or cable attached to the eyelet member 16.
    </p>
    <p num="27">
      The broadest portion of the engaging member 30 is able to slidably fit about the eyelet member 16 as shown in FIGS. 1 and 4 of the drawings.
      <br/>
      The first member 32 and the first edge 36 engage the spring latch 18 for retaining it in an open position as shown in FIG. 1 of the drawings.
    </p>
    <p num="28">
      In use, the user positions the engaging member 30 about the rope 14 or cable through the opening.
      <br/>
      The user then slides the engaging member 30 over the eyelet member 16 of the latch hook 12 so as to completely open the spring latch 18 of the latch hook 12.
      <br/>
      When the engaging member 30 is properly positioned, the first member 32 and the first edge 36 will engage the eyelet and the spring latch 18 for retaining the spring latch 18 in an open position as best shown in FIG. 1 of the drawings.
      <br/>
      Also, the second member 34 and the second edge 38 will engage the opposite side of the eyelet member 16 and also the mid-portion of the latch hook 12 as shown in FIG. 1 thereby preventing the latch hook 12 from moving during attachment.
    </p>
    <p num="29">
      After the latch hook 12 is properly positioned within the engaging member 30, the user grasps the pole member 20 and manipulates the pole member 20 so that the latch hook 12 is connected to the desired hook upon the boat or other object.
      <br/>
      Once the latch hook 12 is secured, the user slowly pulls upon the pole member 20 to slide the engaging member 30 away from the latch hook 12 thereby allowing the spring latch 18 to close as shown in FIG. 2 of the drawings.
      <br/>
      The user continues to slide the engaging member 30 away from the latch hook 12 until the user is able to completely remove it by positioning the rope 14 or cable through the opening.
    </p>
    <p num="30">When the user desires to remove the latch hook 12 from the boat or other object, the above process is simply reversed so that the engaging member 30 simultaneously opens the spring latch 18 while snugly retaining the latch hook 12 thereby allowing the user to easily remove the latch hook 12.</p>
    <p num="31">
      As to a further discussion of the manner of usage and operation of the present invention, the same should be apparent from the above description.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, no further discussion relating to the manner of usage and operation will be provided.
    </p>
    <p num="32">With respect to the above description then, it is to be realized that the optimum dimensional relationships for the parts of the invention, to include variations in size, materials, shape, form, function and manner of operation, assembly and use, are deemed readily apparent and obvious to one skilled in the art, and all equivalent relationships to those illustrated in the drawings and described in the specification are intended to be encompassed by the present invention.</p>
    <p num="33">
      Therefore, the foregoing is considered as illustrative only of the principles of the invention.
      <br/>
      Further, since numerous modifications and changes will readily occur to those skilled in the art, it is not desired to limit the invention to the exact construction and operation shown and described, and accordingly, all suitable modifications and equivalents may be resorted to, falling within the scope of the invention.
