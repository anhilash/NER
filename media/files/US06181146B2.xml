      <br/>
      Field of the Invention
    </p>
    <p num="2">The present invention relates to a burn-in board used in a burn-in test on a semiconductor product, and particularly to a burn-in board which single makes it possible to perform a burn-in test on plural kinds of semiconductor products which are equal to one another in their package and the number of pins.</p>
    <p num="3">2. Prior Art</p>
    <p num="4">
      In order to secure quality and reliability of a semiconductor product, a burn-in test is performed as a kind of screening tests for removing a product having a potential defect.
      <br/>
      In the burn-in test, a burn-in board is used as a board for accommodating a number of devices to be tested and the burn-in board is accommodated in a burn-in chamber and then the test is performed.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      In an existing burn-in board, different kinds of devices to be tested (semiconductor products) which are equal to one another in their package and the number of pins are different in electric test conditions, and therefore, it has been necessary to change over the test circuits and so some additional boards have had to be prepared.
      <br/>
      As a method for solving such a problem, up to now, a technique is known which has been disclosed in a Japanese laid-open publication Tokkaihei No. 3-170078.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      A burn-in board 100 disclosed in this publication has plural (four) IC sockets 102 on a printed wiring board 101 as shown by an external view in FIG. 8 and a circuit diagram in FIG. 9.
      <br/>
      Each of the IC sockets 102 is provided with fourteen terminals (pins) represented by numbers 1 to 14, where the terminals of numbers 1 to 6 have the corresponding signals 1 to 6 inputted to them through the respective resistors 103 and the terminals of numbers 8 to 13 have the corresponding signals 8 to 13 inputted to them through the respective resistors 103.
      <br/>
      And the terminal of number 14 is connected to a first power source (Vcc) 107 through a circuit changeover socket 104.
      <br/>
      The terminal of number 7 is connected to a second power source (the ground potential GND) 108.
      <br/>
      The circuit changeover socket 104 can put on and off selectively either one of circuit changeover units 105a and 105b.
      <br/>
      The circuit changeover socket 105a has resistors 106 and the circuit changeover socket 105b has no resistor.
    </p>
    <p num="7">This burn-in board 100 makes it possible to change a circuit (insert or remove the resistors 106 in this example) by wiring a circuit part common to plural kinds of burn-in boards as it is on the single printed wiring board 101 and collecting one-end parts of other circuit wirings than the common part at a part (circuit changeover socket 104) of the printed wiring board 101 and then putting on or off either one of the circuit changeover units 105a and 105b which have, respectively, other circuits than the common circuit.</p>
    <p num="8">By means of such a composition, the existing burn-in board 100 makes it possible to perform a burn-in test on plural kinds of semiconductor products which are equal to one another in the package and the number of pins.</p>
    <p num="9">
      In the existing burn-in board 100, however, since one-end parts of other circuit wirings than the common circuit part are collected at a part of the single printed wiring board, wiring length of other circuits than the common circuit on the printed wiring board 101 cannot help being longer when the wiring is drawn from an IC socket 102 more distant from the circuit changeover socket 104.
      <br/>
      And there has been a problem that a limit of expansion of a wiring pattern width due to its close pattern increases a signal noise and can have a bad influence upon devices to be tested (semiconductor products).

      <br/>
      FIG. 1 shows an external appearance of a burn-in board 200 of an embodiment of the invention.
      <br/>
      FIG. 2 is a circuit diagram of the burn-in board 200.
      <br/>
      The burn-in board 200 is provided with plural, for example, four IC sockets 202 as tested device accommodating parts on a printed wiring board 201.
      <br/>
      Each of the IC sockets 202 is provided with fourteen test terminals (pins) represented by numbers 1 to 14, for example.

      <br/>
      The plural resistors 203 are, respectively, soldered on the signal wiring pattern on the printed wiring board 201.
    </p>
    <p num="23">
      A Vcc circuit changeover socket 204A as a first circuit changeover socket and a GND circuit changeover socket 205A as a second circuit changeover socket are arranged in a wiring connection area between the test terminals of numbers 1 to 7 at one side of each of the IC sockets and the resistors 203 corresponding to these terminals on this burn-in board 200.
      <br/>
      On the other hand, a Vcc circuit changeover socket 204B as a first circuit changeover socket and a GND circuit changeover socket 205B as a second circuit changeover socket, in the same way as above, are arranged in a wiring connection area between the test terminals of numbers 8 to 14 at the other side of each of the IC sockets and the resistors 203 corresponding to these terminals.
    </p>
    <p num="24">
      A Vcc circuit changeover unit 206 as a first circuit changeover unit can be selectively mounted on and detached from the Vec circuit changeover sockets 204A and 204B, and a GND circuit changeover unit 207 as a second circuit changeover unit can be selectively mounted on and detached from a GND circuit changeover sockets 205A and 205B.
      <br/>
      In this embodiment, it is assumed that a first electric potential (Vcc) is supplied to the test terminals of numbers 5 and 7 of the IC socket 202 and the ground potential (GND) is supplied to the test terminals of numbers 12 and 14 of the IC socket 202.
      <br/>

      <br/>
      The Vcc circuit changeover sockets 204A and 204B and the Vcc circuit changeover unit 206 form a Vcc circuit changeover device.
      <br/>
      The GND circuit changeover sockets 205A and 205B and the GND circuit changeover unit 207 form a GND circuit changeover device.
    </p>
    <p num="25">
      FIG. 4 shows a concrete composition of the Vcc circuit changeover device composed of the Vcc circuit changeover socket 204A and the Vcc circuit changeover unit 206 at one side (a side corresponding to terminal numbers 1 to 7) of the IC socket 202, and FIGS. 4(A), 4 (B), and 4(C) show, respectively, a side View of the Vcc circuit changeover unit 206, a plan view of the Vcc circuit changeover socket 204A, and a side view of the Vcc circuit changeover socket 204A set on the printed wiring board 201.
      <br/>
      Since the Vcc circuit changeover socket 204B is also composed in the same way as the Vcc circuit changeover socket 204A, description of the socket 204B is omitted.
    </p>
    <p num="26">
      The Vcc circuit changeover socket 204A has a structure where plural receptive terminals 204b (in this case, seven terminals to be connected to the terminals 1 to 7 out of the terminals 1 to 14 of the IC socket 202) are embedded in a line in its main body 204a made of an insulating material such as plastics in the shape of a rectangular parallelopiped.
      <br/>
      The main body 204a is furthermore provided with a Vcc terminal 204c as a first electric potential terminal at each end of the line of the seven receptive terminals 204b.
    </p>
    <p num="27">
      These Vcc terminals 204c are connected with a Vcc wiring pattern 208 formed on the printed wiring board 201 so as to surround the Vcc circuit changeover socket 204A.
      <br/>
      The receptive terminals 204b and the Vcc terminals 204c are respectively provided with the receptive holes, into which the respective plug-in terminals 206b and 206c of the Vcc circuit changeover unit 206 as described later can be inserted.

      <br/>
      The base end side of these plug-in terminals 206b and 206c is covered with the unit body 206a made of an insulating material, for example, plastics.
    </p>
    <p num="29">
      FIG. 5 shows a concrete composition of the GND circuit changeover socket 205B and the GND circuit changeover unit 207 at the other side (a side corresponding to terminal numbers 8 to 14) of the IC socket 202, and FIGS. 5 (A), 5(B), and 5(C) show, respectively a side view of the GND circuit changeover unit 207, a plan view of the GND circuit changeover socket 205B, and a side view of the GND circuit changeover socket 205B set on the printed wiring board 201.
      <br/>
      Since the GND circuit changeover socket 205A is also composed in the same way as the GND circuit changeover socket 205B, description of the socket 205A is omitted.
    </p>
    <p num="30">
      The GND circuit changeover socket 205B has a structure where plural receptive terminals 205b (in this case, seven terminals to be connected to the terminals 8 to 14 out of the terminals 1 to 14 of the IC socket 202) are embedded in a line in its main body 205a made of an insulating material such as plastics in the shape of a rectangular parallelopiped.
      <br/>
      The main body 205a is furthermore provided with a GND terminal 205c as a second electric potential terminal at each end of the line of the seven receptive terminals 205c.
      <br/>
      These GND terminals 205c are connected with a GND wiring pattern 209 formed on the printed wiring board 201 so as to surround the GND circuit changeover socket 205B.
      <br/>
      The receptive terminals 205b and the GND terminals 205c are respectively provided with the receptive holes, into which the respective plug-in terminals 207b and 207c of the GND circuit changeover unit 207 as described later can be inserted.
    </p>
    <p num="31">
      In this embodiment, the GND circuit changeover unit 207 is provided with two plug-in terminals 207b and two GND plug-in terminals 207c which are formed in one body so that both of the test terminals 12 and 14 of the IC socket 202 can be electrically connected with a GND power source 211 as a second electric potential supplying means.
      <br/>
      The base end side of these plug-in terminals 207b and 207c is covered with the unit body 207a made of an insulating material, for example, plastics.
    </p>
    <p num="32">In this embodiment, the terminals 5 and 7 of the IC socket 202 are connected with the Vcc power source 210 and the terminals 12 and 14 of the IC socket 202 are connected with the GND power source 211 (are grounded) by inserting the Vcc circuit changeover unit 206 into the Vcc circuit changeover socket 204A set on one side (the upper side in FIG. 2) of the IC socket 202 and inserting the GND circuit changeover unit 207 into the GND circuit changeover socket 205B set on the other side (the lower side in FIG. 2) of the IC socket 202.</p>
    <p num="33">The Vcc circuit changeover device and the GND circuit changeover device as composed in this manner are provided at both sides of each of the four IC sockets 202.</p>
    <p num="34">
      In the burn-in board 200 of this embodiment, as shown in FIG. 6, the circuit wiring on the printed wiring board 201 has a Vcc wiring pattern, a GND wiring pattern, and a signal wiring pattern which are respectively formed on different layers.
      <br/>
      Namely, the signal wiring pattern 212a, the Vcc wiring pattern 208, the GND wiring pattern 209, and the signal wiring pattern 212b are respectively formed on the first, the second, the third, and the fourth layer, where an insulating layer is put between the adjoining wiring pattern layers.
      <br/>
      Particularly, the Vcc wiring pattern 208 and the GND wiring pattern 209 are made as wide as possible in pattern width and formed so as to surround the IC socket 202 in the very close vicinity of it in order to reduce a voltage drop and a noise, as shown by a plan view of the Vcc wiring pattern 208 as an example.
      <br/>
      And the Vcc wiring pattern 208 is directly connected with the receptive terminals 204c of the Vcc circuit changeover socket 204 and the GND wiring pattern 209 is directly connected with the receptive terminals 205c of the GND circuit changeover socket 205.
    </p>
    <p num="35">
      Thus, the burn-in board 200 according to this embodiment can form, for example, the Vcc wiring circuit by fitting the Vcc circuit changeover unit 206 in the Vcc circuit changeover socket 204A and can form the GND wiring circuit by fitting the GND circuit changeover unit 207 in the GND circuit changeover socket 205B.
      <br/>
      Therefore, it is possible to easily change over a circuit from a signal wiring to a desired Vcc wiring or GND wiring by preparing the number of Vcc circuit changeover units 206 and the number of GND circuit changeover units 207 which are respectively provided with specific plug-in terminals, corresponding to the number of changeover circuits (kinds of tested devices) and by changing these Vcc circuit changeover units 206 or GND circuit changeover units 207.
    </p>
    <p num="36">
      The changeover unit of this embodiment has the Vcc circuit changeover unit 206 provided with plug-in terminals 206b and 206c so that the terminals 5 and 7 of the IC socket 202 can be connected with the Vcc power source 210 and has the GND circuit changeover unit 207 provided with plug-in terminals 207b and 207c so that the terminals 12 and 14 of the IC socket 202 can be connected with the GND power source 211.
      <br/>
      Therefore, in case that it is necessary to change over the Vcc wiring and the GND wiring after a burn-in board has been made, it is possible to easily perform a changeover of the Vcc wiring and the GND wiring by pulling out the Vcc circuit changeover unit 206 and the GND circuit changeover unit 207 which have been previously used, respectively, from the Vcc circuit changeover socket and the GND circuit changeover socket, and then inserting the Vcc circuit changeover unit and the GND circuit changeover unit which have been newly made for changing over the wiring, respectively, into the Vcc circuit changeover socket and the GND circuit changeover socket.
    </p>
    <p num="37">
      In this embodiment, a Vcc wiring pattern, a GND wiring pattern, and a signal wiring pattern as the circuit wiring on the printed wiring board 201 are respectively formed on different layers.
      <br/>
      Particularly, therefore, the Vcc wiring pattern and the GND wiring pattern can be made as wide as possible in pattern width and can be formed so as to surround the IC socket 202 in its very close vicinity in order to reduce a voltage drop and a noise.
      <br/>
      And the Vcc wiring pattern is directly connected with the Vcc terminals 204c of the Vcc circuit changeover sockets 204A and 204B, and the GND wiring pattern is directly connected with the GND terminals 205c of the GND circuit changeover sockets 205A and 205B.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, since length of the Vcc wiring and that of the GND wiring which have influence upon a noise and a voltage drop come to be only lengths of them inside the Vcc circuit changeover unit and the GND circuit changeover unit, these lengths can be 50 mm or less and can be shorten to 10% or less of the existing wiring length.
      <br/>
      Thus, a voltage drop and a noise caused by the Vcc wiring and the GND wiring can be reduced by 20% or more of the existing level.
    </p>
    <p num="38">
      Although the invention has been described with an embodiment of it, the present invention is not limited to the above-mentioned embodiment and can be modified in various manners.
      <br/>
      In the above-mentioned embodiment, for example, a Vcc circuit changeover socket as a first circuit changeover socket and a GND circuit changeover socket as a second circuit changeover socket are arranged corresponding to the respective terminal lines at both sides of an IC socket 202, but it will do also to arrange only the Vcc circuit changeover socket at one side of the IC socket 202 and only the circuit changeover socket at the other side of the IC socket 202.
    </p>
    <p num="39">As described above, since a burn-in board of the invention is provided with a test circuit changeover means capable of changing the test circuit according to kinds to be tested by selectively changing over an electric potential supplied to the respective test terminals of a tested device accommodating part from a first and a second electric potential supplying means, different tests can be easily performed on different kinds of devices on which a burn-in test is to be performed and which are equal in their package and the number of pins to one another, and since the test circuit changeover means is provided near the tested device accommodating part, length of the wiring having influence upon a voltage drop and a noise can be greatly reduced and an effect of greatly reducing the signal noises can be obtained.</p>
