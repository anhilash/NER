      Field of the Invention
    </p>
    <p num="2">The present invention relates to a novel silver halide photosensitive material for color photography providing an ornamental image, and a method for forming a color image using the same.</p>
    <p num="3">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
    <p num="4">
      Photosensitive materials for photography utilizing a silver halide are increasingly being developed recently, and at present, a color image having high image quality is easily available.
      <br/>
      For example, ordinary, in a method called color photography, photography is conducted using a color negative film, and image information recorded on a color negative film after development is printed optically on color photographic paper, to thereby obtain a color print.
      <br/>
      Recently, this process has developed to a high degree, and color laboratories that are large centralized apparatuses for producing large amounts of color prints with high efficiency and so-called miniature laboratories that are compact and simple printer processors placed in shops are now widely spread.
      <br/>
      As a result, any one can enjoy color photography easily.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      Thus, while a system utilizing a silver halide (hereinafter, referred to as "silver halide system") have been developed, means by which digital image information is output via a personal computer and the like have also been developed to a remarkably degree.
      <br/>
      Though the silver halide system has reached a stage wherein simple and quick treatment is possible, it requires a specialized processing device using special processing solution such as developing solution, bleach-fix solution and the like and skilled operators.
      <br/>
      Meanwhile, an inkjet method, electrophotography method and sublimation type transfer method are spreading in offices and families as a system for obtaining a color image easily.
      <br/>
      Further, image quality obtained in these systems is recently excellent, and selling competition is intense to attract users with so-called "photographic quality".
      <br/>
      However, it can not be admitted yet that the outputted image in these systems has leached the same level as that of the silver halide system, though it has improved to a certain extent.
      <br/>
      Therefore, it is strongly required that the high quality image that is characteristic of the silver halide system be obtained with the same ease as in other systems.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      Simply stated, the constant on the silver halide system represented by color photography is that processing with a specialized color laboratory is necessary.
      <br/>
      When use in offices and general households is considered, the ordinary silver halide system has a defect in that it has a complicated and time-consuming processing method.
      <br/>
      The reason for this is that, for example, when a color print is made using color photographic paper, a specialized color printer for printing color negative information on photographic paper while maintaining a suitable color balance is required.
      <br/>
      Further, to operation the color printer, skilled operators are usually necessary.
      <br/>
      Next, to treat the exposed color photographic paper, a color processor is required for conducting color development, bleach-fixing, and washing or stabilization processing under strictly controlled conditions, and for this treatment, a time of about 4 minutes is usually required.
      <br/>
      Moreover, the environmental load that has been recently observed cannot be ignored.
      <br/>
      Namely, processing solutions thereof contain substances whose discharge should be restricted such as color developing agents, iron chelate compounds which are bleaching agents, and the like, and developing equipment often require exclusive facilities.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      Therefore, if these processes can be effected simply and quickly, it is expected that the high quality characteristic of the silver halide system can be utilized for output of color images in various fields.
      <br/>
      Namely, simple and quick processing is an important subject for further developing the silver halide system.
    </p>
    <p num="8">In view of this background, there have been suggested many improved technologies for making a system that uses neither a color developing agent nor a bleaching agent, which are used in current color image forming systems.</p>
    <p num="9">
      For example, in IS &amp; T's 48th Annual Conference Proceedings, p. 180, a system is disclosed which removes developed silver and an unreacted silver halide by allowing a pigment formed in a developing reaction to migrate into a printing layer and then releasing the layer, making a bleach-fix bath, which is essential for conventional color photography processing unnecessary.
      <br/>
      However, in this suggested technology, a developing process in a processing bath containing a color developing agent is still necessary, and it can not be said that the environmental problem has been solved.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      As a system requiring no processing solution containing a color developing agent, a pictrography system is provided by Fuji Photo Film Co., Ltd. In this system, a development reaction is caused by supplying a small amount of water to a photosensitive member containing a base precursor, laminating this with an image receiving member, and heating the laminate.
      <br/>
      This method is advantageous in that the above-described treatment bath is not used.
    </p>
    <p num="11">
      Pigment image formation by pictrography is roughly divided into a method in which a compound which releases a pigment in a developing reaction of exposed silver halide particles is used and the pigment is released corresponding to development, and a method in which a pigment is released reverse-corresponding to development by consuming a compound in which an oxide of a contained developing agent generated accompanying development of a silver halide causes a pigment releasing reaction.
      <br/>
      In both of the methods, a so-called pre-formed dye compound containing a pigment part previously in the molecule is taken into a photosensitive member.
      <br/>
      Consequently, in both methods, a colored material shall be contained in a photosensitive emulsion layer, and imparting high sensitivity is difficult.
      <br/>
      Further, compounds used in these color developing methods require complicated molecular structures for precisely controlling the above-described reactions, and are disadvantageous in terms of cost.
    </p>
    <p num="12">
      Since further development of a quick and simple image forming system can be expected by solving these problems of the pictrography method, development of novel technologies has been desired.
      <br/>
      As an example of such novel system, Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open (JP-A) No. 9-152705 discloses a technology for forming an ornamental image using a developing agent which can thermally develop a silver halide and a compound that releases a pigment through a coupling reaction with an oxide thereof.
    </p>
    <p num="13">Investigation has been conducted on a system for simply obtaining a color print having high quality in a short period of time based on the above-described technologies, and as a result, it has been found that image concentration varies according to variation in the amount of water used in thermal development, and that strict control of the amount of water is necessary for stably forming an image having high quality.</p>
    <p num="14">
      In such an image forming method, a small amount of water is used for the purpose of progressing a thermal developing reaction quickly.
      <br/>
      In detail, the developing reaction and the pigment releasing reaction are caused by heating in the presence of water between a photosensitive material and a pigment fixing material which fixes a generated pigment, the amount of water being in an amount corresponding to 1/10 to 1-fold of that required for the maximum swelling of a layer composed of these materials.
      <br/>
      In this procedure, variation in reaction amount of development or pigment release, which accompanies variation in the amount of water is not preferable for stably forming an image having high quality.
      <br/>
      Namely, it has become clear that when the amount of water varies, there is the fear that an image having constant quality can not be obtained repeatedly or that image concentration varies in one image and the like.
      <br/>
      Further, these problems regarding variation in image concentration, increasingly worsen when the temperature is raised to shorten processing time.
    </p>

      Specifically, after the coupling reaction, electron migration occurs from a non-covalent electron pair of an atom which can become an anion or a cation proton-dissociated on D, to the coupling part, and a double bond is formed between X and Yk (when k=0, between X and D) to allow a N--X bond to be cut, and further, a substituent on the coupler side is released as an anion simultaneously with formation of a double bond between the coupling part of the coupler and a N atom.
      <br/>
      By this series of a electron migration mechanism, formation of a dye and releasing of a substituent occur.

      A technology using silver halide emulsion composed of silver halide particles having a small variation coefficient of particle size distribution as a photosensitive material for high temperature development is disclosed in JP-A No. 62-32454.

      However, the means disclosed in the above-described technology is only a technology for improving the above-described discrimination in a system using a pigment donative compound which releases a pigment in developing an exposed silver halide or using a coupler which forms a pigment having diffusion resistance with using a p-aminophenol derivative as a developing agent, and it is a technology which is utterly different from a technology which suppresses variation in abilities caused by variation in the amount of water imparted, in a system which releases a diffusive pigment following coupling reaction using a specific developing agent prescribed in the present invention.

      <br/>
      When halogen compositions of fine crystal particles of statistically significant number, namely, at least several decades or more are measured, the variation coefficient of halogen composition distribution can be calculated by statistically treating the resulted compositions.

      In the same manner as for the particle size distribution, the variation coefficient can be obtained by measuring the standard deviation of halogen composition distribution and by dividing this value by average halogen composition between particles.

      The composition of the silver halide emulsion of the present invention can take various compositions for imparting intended abilities, and preferably selected from silver chloride bromide, silver iodide bromide and silver chloride iodide bromide.

      Such silver chloride bromide, silver iodide bromide and silver chloride iodide bromide which are not a so-called mixed crystal can make the whole silver halide particle to be composed of a single composition, however, they are not preferable since they can not easily impart various required properties to a photosensitive material.

      A preferable example is a method in which a particle is constituted of a plurality of layers having different halogen compositions.
      <br/>
      In the present invention, a plurality of layers can be laminated forming co-axial polyhedral shape by changing halogen composition on the way of forming a particle.
      <br/>
      For example, when a silver chloride bromide particle is illustrated as an example, a core having high silver bromide content is placed at the center of a particle and a shell having low silver bromide content can be formed around the core.
      <br/>
      Reversely, a shell having high silver bromide content can be formed around a core having high silver chloride content.

      Also, the physical properties of a silver halide crystal can be significantly changed by allowing a silver chloride bromide particle to contain a small amount of iodine.
      <br/>
      For this, iodine is preferably contained in any concentration in the above-described core and shell.
      <br/>
      The content of silver bromide and silver iodide can be changed optionally within the range wherein the object of the present invention is not lost.

    <p num="132">
      Various methods can be adopted for changing the halogen composition at various parts of a particle.
      <br/>
      In normal method, it is conducted by changing the composition of a water-soluble silver halide such as a silver halide alkali and the like introduced in a reaction system simultaneously with a water-soluble silver salt such as silver nitrate and the like during particle formation.
      <br/>
      Further, a particle is also preferably grown by supplying a ultra-fine particle of silver halide previously formed.
      <br/>
      In this case, the partial composition of a particle can be changed by changing the composition of a silver halide ultra-fine particle.
      <br/>
      Further, for introducing silver bromide and silver iodide into a particle, there is also preferably used an organic compound such as, for example,  BETA -bromopronionic acid and sodium p-iodinated acetamidebenzenesulfonate which can generate a bromide ion and iodide ion by reacting with a base, sulfite and the like in an emulsion.
    </p>
    <p num="133">
      It is also preferable to form a projected part composed of a silver halide epitaxially connected onto the surface of a particle.
      <br/>
      Since the projected part is constituted of silver halide, crystal type thereof is the same face centered crystal type rock salt type as the host particle, however, since the halogen composition is different from that of the host particle, epitaxial connecting part is formed contributing to increase in sensitivity.
    </p>
    <p num="134">
      Control of the halogen composition of the epitaxial projected part is conducted by changing silver halide ions supplied or existing in depositing the epitaxial projected part onto the host particle.
      <br/>
      For example, silver iodide content of the epitaxial projected part can be enhanced by adding a bromide ion and iodine ion prior to deposition of the epitaxial projected part and/or allowing a bromine ion and an iodine ion to exist in an aqueous silver halide alkali solution supplied simultaneously with a silver chloride solution.
      <br/>
      In some case, an epitaxial projected part having any composition can also be formed by adding silver halide in the form of a fine crystal of which composition is controlled.
    </p>
    <p num="135">
      For controlling deposited part of the epitaxitial projected part, an adsorption substance which can act as a site director is preferably added before formation of the epitaxitial projected part.
      <br/>
      As specific examples thereof, cyanine and merocyanine compounds can be preferably used.
      <br/>
      By controlling the amount added of these pigments, position formed of the epitaxitial projected part can be controlled and occupying area can be controlled.
      <br/>
      As the site director, nitrogen-containing heterocyclic compounds such as aminoazaindenes and the like can be used in addition to the above-described pigments.
      <br/>
      In using them, a method disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,435,501 can be referred to.

      Among these metal complexes, a metal complex which provides a transitional shallow electron trap in sensitizing process is preferably contained.
      <br/>
      Whether it acts as the transitional shallow electron trap or not can be checked by measuring the life of a photoelectron generated in irradiating a test piece coated with a silver halide emulsion by a laser pulse light, by utilizing micro wave absorption.
      <br/>
      As a result of inclusion of the metal complex in the silver halide particle, when the life of a photoelectron generated by the above-described laser pulse is prolonged, it can be judged that the metal complex acts as a transitional shallow electron trap.
      <br/>
      When the life of a photoelectron is significantly shortened by introduction of a lot of electron traps as well as other reasons in preparation process of the silver halide particle used, and therefor the measurement is difficult, the measurement can be made easy by cooling a sample.

      In the emulsion of the present invention, it is preferable to use a metal complex which provides a deep electron trap in sensitizing process together with the above-described metal complex which provides a transitional shallow electron trap in sensitizing process.
      <br/>
      Whether it acts as the deep electron trap or not can be checked by measuring the above-described life of a photoelectron and by investigating if the life of an electron is shortened by introduction of the metal complex.
    </p>
    <p num="142">A metal complex having a trap depth measured by the above-described ESR measurement of 0.35 eV or more can be preferably used.</p>

      In the silver halide emulsion of the present invention, doping amount of the above-described metal complex into a silver halide particle is generally in the range from 10-9 to 10-2 per one mol of a silver halide.
      <br/>
      More particularly, it is preferable that the metal complex which provides a transitional shallow electron trap in sensitizing process is used in an amount within 10-6 to 10-2 per one mol of a silver halide, and that the metal complex which provides a deep electron trap in sensitizing process is used in an amount within 10-9 to 10-5 per one mol of a silver halide.

    <p num="145">
      The doping site of these metal complex can be changed variously.
      <br/>
      Namely, the metal complex may be doped uniformly in a silver halide particle, or may be localized inside or on the surface of the particle.
      <br/>
      It may be doped in extremely shallow semi-surface near the surface of the particle.
      <br/>
      Further, in the case of a silver halide particle having structure inside the particle, different metal complexes may be preferably doped in parts having different compositions.
      <br/>
      For example, there can be preferably used a method in which a hexacyano ferrate (II) ion is doped in a part having high silver chloride content and a hexachloro iridate (III) ion is doped in an epitaxial crystal part having high silver bromide content, a method in which a metal complex is doped intensively inside a silver iodide bromide, a method in which a hexachloro iridate (IV) ion is doped in a silver iodide bromide and a hexacyano ruthenate (II) ion is doped in a corner part of the particle to obtain an epitaxial crystal having high silver chloride content and this crystal is deposited.
    </p>
    <p num="146">For doping these metals in a silver halide particle, a method a metal complex is dissolved in a reaction solution used for particle formation, for example, an aqueous alkali halide solution and is introduced, a method in which a solution of a metal complex is added to a reaction vessel during particle formation and the metal complex is introduced, and the like may be appropriately selected for use.</p>
    <p num="147">
      In the silver halide particle of the present invention, a divalent anion of a what is called chalcogen element such as sulfur, selenium and tellurium is also preferably doped.

Zelikman et al., Making and Coating of Photographic Emulsion, Focal Press, 1964, and the like can be used as a basic method.
      <br/>
      Namely, the particle can be prepared in various pH ranges such as an acidic method, neutral method, ammonia method and the like.
      <br/>
      As a supplying method for a reaction solution of a water-soluble silver salt and water-soluble halogen salt, a one side mixing method, simultaneous mixing method and the like can be used alone or in combination.
      <br/>
      Further, it is also preferable that a controlled double jet method in which addition of a reaction solution is controlled so as to keep pAg at intended value.

    <p num="149">The preparation of the silver halide particle of the present invention is usually conducted by supplying a water-soluble silver salt solution and solution of a water-soluble halogen salt such as an alkali halide into a solution in which a water-soluble binder such as gelatin is dissolved, under controlled conditions.</p>
    <p num="150">
      In formation of a flat silver halide particle having high aspect ratio such as used in the present invention, gelatin during the particle formation also exerts an important influence.
      <br/>
      For forming a flat particle having thin particle thickness, gelatin containing a small amount of methionine is preferable.
      <br/>
      For reducing methionine content in gelatin, it is preferable that the gelatin is oxidized using hydrogen peroxide and the like.
      <br/>
      Further, it is also preferable that an amino group contained in gelatin is modified by a substituent having a carboxyl group.
      <br/>
      Examples of the preferable substituent include phthalic acid, succinic acid, trimellitic acid and pyromellitic acid.
    </p>
    <p num="151">
      After the silver halide particle is formed, it is preferable to remove excess water-soluble salts.
      <br/>
      This process is called a desalting process or water-washing process, and various means are used.
      <br/>
      For example, there may also be used a Nudel water-washing method in which a gelatin solution containing a silver halide particle is gelled, cut in the form of a string and a water-soluble salt is washed away by cool water, and a precipitation method in which inorganic salts (for example, sodium sulfate), anionic surfactant, anionic polymer (for example, sodium polystyrenesulfonate) comprising a polyvalent anion, or a gelatin derivative (for example, aliphatic acylated gelatin, aromatic acylated gelatin, aromatic carbamoylated gelatin and the like) is added to flocculate the gelatin and excess salts are removed.
      <br/>
      When the precipitation method is used, the removal of excess salts is carried out quickly.

    <p num="152">
      In the present invention, it is usually preferable to use a silver halide emulsion to which chemical sensitization has been performed.
      <br/>
      The chemical sensitization contributes to supply of high sensitivity to a silver halide particle prepared and to supply of exposure condition stability and preservation stability.
      <br/>
      For the chemical sensitization, sensitization methods which are generally known can be used alone or in various combinations.
    </p>
    <p num="153">
      As the chemical sensitization method, a chalcogen sensitization method using a sulfur, selenium or tellurium compound is preferably used.
      <br/>
      As the sensitization agent for these methods, a compound which releases the above-described chalcogen element to form a silver chalcogenide when added to the silver halide emulsion is used.
      <br/>
      Further, it is also preferable to use these compounds together to obtain high sensitivity and to suppress fogging low.
    </p>
    <p num="154">
      Further, a noble metal sensitization method using gold, platinum, iridium and the like is also preferable.
      <br/>
      In particular, a gold sensitization method in which chlorine aurate is used alone or together with a thiocyanate ion which is a ligand of gold gives high sensitivity.
      <br/>
      When the gold sensitization and chalcogen sensitizatin are used together, further high sensitivity can be obtained.
    </p>
    <p num="155">
      Further, there is also preferably used a so-called reducing sensitization method in which a reductive silver nucleus is introduced by using a compound having suitable reducing ability in forming a particle to obtain high sensitivity.
      <br/>
      A reductive sensitization method in which an alkylamine compound having an aromatic ring is added in chemical sensitization is also preferable.
    </p>
    <p num="156">
      Control of reactivity using various compounds having adsorptivity to the silver halide particle is preferably conducted in conducting chemical sensitization.
      <br/>
      In particular, a method in which a nitrogen-containing heterocyclic compound and mercapto compound, sensitizing pigments of cyanines and merocyanines are added prior to the chalcogen sensitization and gold sensitization is particularly preferable.
    </p>
    <p num="157">Though the reaction conditions when the chemical sensitization is performed differ depending on object, and the temperature is from 30 (degree)  C. to 95 (degree)  C., and preferably from 40 (degree)  C. to 75 (degree)  C., pH is from 5.0 to 11.0, and preferably from 5.5 to 8.5, and pAg is from 6.0 to 10.5, and preferably from 6.5 to 9.8.</p>

      In the present invention, it is preferable to perform so-called spectral sensitization which gives sensitivity in desired light wave range to a photosensitive silver halide emulsion.

      In particular, in a color photography photosensitive member, photosensitive layers having photosensitivity against blue, green and red respectively are introduced to conduct color rendering exactly corresponding to original.
      <br/>
      This photosensitivity is provided by spectral sensitization of a silver halide.
      <br/>
      In spectral sensitization, so-called spectral sensitization pigment is used which adheres to the silver halide particle and gives sensitivity in adsorption wavelength range of itself.

      <br/>
      The spectral sensitization pigment is used in combination as well as used alone.
      <br/>
      This pigment is used for the purpose of regulation of wavelength distribution of spectral photosensitivity and strong color sensitization.
      <br/>
      By combination of the pigments showing strong color sensitization action, sensitivity remarkably greater than the sum of sensitivities which can be attained alone can be obtained.
    </p>
    <p num="162">
      Further, it is also preferable to use together a pigment having no spectral sensitizing action-itself or a compound which and does not substantially absorb a visible light but shows strong color sensitizing action.

      Further, image exposure can also be conducted using a wavelength converting element which is obtained by combining a non-linear optical material with a coherent light source such as laser light and the like.
      <br/>
      The non-liner optical material is a material which can manifest non-linear characteristic between electric field and polarization which occurs when strong light electric field such as laser light is imparted, and there are preferably used inorganic compounds represented by lithium niobate, potassium dihydrogen phosphate (KDP), lithium iodate, BaB2 O4 and the like, urea derivatives, nitroaniline derivatives, for example, nitropyridine-N-oxide derivatives such as 3-methyl-4-nitropyridine-N-oxide (POM), compounds described in JP-A Nos. 61-53462 and 62-210432.

      The heat developing photosensitive material and/or pigment fixing material of the present invention may adopt form having an electroconductive heat generating layer as a heating means for heat development diffusion transfer of a pigment.

      As the heat generating element in this case, those described in JP-A No. 61-145544 and the like can be used.
    </p>
    <p num="232">
      The heating temperature in the heat developing is from about 50 to 250 (degree)  C., and a temperature from about 60 to 180 (degree)  C. is particularly useful.
      <br/>
      The diffusion transfer process of a pigment may be conducted simultaneously with the heat development or may be conducted after completion of the heat development process.
      <br/>
      In the latter case, it is preferable that the heating temperature in the transfer process is particularly 50 (degree)  C. or higher and lower than the temperature in the heat developing-process by about 10 (degree)  C., though the transfer process can be conducted at from room temperature to the temperature in the heat developing process.
    </p>
    <p num="233">
      Though movement of a pigment is caused only by heat, a solvent may be used to promote the pigment movement.
      <br/>
      A method is also useful in which development ant transfer are conducted simultaneously or continuously by heating in the presence of a small amount of solvent (especially, water) described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,704,345, 4,740,445, JP-A No. 61-238,056 and the like.
      <br/>
      In this method, the heating temperature is preferably 50 (degree)  C. or higher and not more than boiling point of the solvent.
      <br/>
      For example, when the solvent is water, it is preferably from 50 to 100 (degree)  C., and more preferably from 60 to 100 (degree)  C. When the heating temperature is less than 50 (degree)  C., promotion of pigment migration is insufficient, and transfer in a short period of time becomes difficult, and when over 100 (degree)  C., generation of bubble accompanying steep vaporization of water cause image defects, therefore, both ranges are not preferable.
    </p>
    <p num="234">
      The heating time can be suitably selected in relation to the heating temperature, and in general, about 5 to 60 seconds is preferable.
      <br/>
      When it is 5 seconds or shorter, image forming reaction is unstable, and when over 60 seconds, the reaction is not successful in quickness.

      When LD or LED is used as a light source, output of a digital signal is possible.

      By this, a using method in which control of design and hue of a print is conducted on CRT and a color proof is output as final output (DDCP) is possible.
      <br/>
      Namely, DDCP is an effective means for conducting output of a proof efficiently in the field of a color proof.
      <br/>
      The reason for this is that a color printer has relatively simple structure and is inexpensive, and by using the color printer, as is well known, production of a preparation film for a color printer and production of a press plate (PS plate) and the like are not necessary, therefore, a hard copy obtained by forming an image on a sheet can be easily produced in a short period of time for several times.
    </p>
    <p num="246">
      When LD or LED is used as a light source, it is preferable that three spectral sensitivities of yellow, magenta and cyan, four spectral sensitivities of yellow, magenta, cyan and black, or, for the purpose of obtaining desirable hue, spectral sensitivities of respective colors obtained by mixing two or more pigments, have respective peaks of the spectral sensitivities at separate wavelengths respectively apart by 20 nm or more.
      <br/>
      Further, as other method, when spectral sensitivities of two or more different colors have difference by 10 times or more, there is also adopted a method in which an image of two or more colors is obtained by one radiation wavelength.

      To produce a color proof for printing which correctly reproduces moire and the like appearing on a print of high resolution by a color printer of low resolution, respective net point area ration data aj of a CMYK4 size plate are converted to 48800DPI bit map data b'j respectively by referring to a threshold matrix 24.
      <br/>
      Then, area ratio ci of each color is counted by referring simultaneously to bit map data b'j in given range.

      Then, primary three stimulation value data X, Y, Z of 1600 DPI which show measured value data of the above-described respective colors previously calculated are calculated.
      <br/>
      Secondary three stimulation value data X', Y', Z' of 400 DPI are calculated by conducting anti-areazing filter treatment against this primary three stimulation value data X, Y, Z. These calculated data are used as input data for the color printer. (This is described in Japanese Patent Application No. 8-192540 in detail.)

      From the results shown in table 9, the following facts are known.
      <br/>
      When the photosensitive material 101 and the photosensitive material 102 are compared, the variation coefficient of particle size distribution and the variation coefficient of halogen composition distribution between particles are within the prescriptions of the present invention, and as a result, variation in abilities against variation in the amount of water imparted in thermal development is small and stable.
      <br/>
      Particularly, variation in shoulder concentration in the specific curve remarkably decreases.

    <p num="334">
      In the results of the photosensitive material 103 having large variation coefficient of halogen composition distribution between particles, increase in fogging when the amount of water decreases is remarkable, though the variation coefficient of particle size distribution is small.

      1000 ml of distilled water was prepared in a reaction vessel, and to this was added 35 g of lime-processed gelatin, 0.5 g of potassium bromide and 3.4 g of sodium chloride, and the mixture was dissolved at 40 (degree)  c. To this solution was added 50 mg of N,N'-dimethylimidazolidine-2-thione and the mixture was heated to 46 (degree)  c. Then, 220 ml of an aqueous solution containing 17.0 g of silver nitrate and 220 ml of an aqueous solution containing 5.9 g of potassium bromide and 2.9 g of sodium chloride were added with vigorous stirring over 9 minutes. 5 minutes after the completion of the addition, 480 ml of an aqueous solution containing 152.9 g of silver nitrate and 480 ml of an aqueous solution containing 97. 0 g of potassium bromide, 5.3 g of sodium chloride and 0.05 mg of potassium hexachloroiridate (iv) were added with vigorous stirring over 32 minutes.
      <br/>
      After the completion of these solutions, 100 ml of a methanol solution containing 610 mg of the spectral sensitizing pigment (g1) and 125 mg of the pigment (g2) was added.
      <br/>
      After the addition, the mixture was kept at 46 (degree)  c. for 10 minutes, then, cooled down to 35 (degree)  c. The pH of the solution was lowered to 3.8, and de-salting was conducted by a normal method using a polymer coagulating agent.
      <br/>
      Then, by adding to this 40 g of lime-treated ossein gelatin and 0.1 mg of benzoisothiazolone, ph was controlled to 6.4, pag was controlled to 7.6 and the temperature was controlled to 60 (degree)  c. To this emulsion was added 50 mg of 4-hydroxy-6-methyl-1,3,3a,7-tetrazaindene and 3.1 mg of sodium thiosulfate, and after 5 minutes, 200 mg of a nucleic acid decomposed material was added and chemical sensitization was conducted optimally, then, 150 mg of 3-methylureidophenyl-mercaptotetrazole was added, and the mixture was cooled.

      The photosensitive materials 201 to 208 were exposed to a light at 2500 lux for 1/50 seconds through an optical wedge and a green filer.
      <br/>
      Then water in an amount corresponding to 5 ml per 1 m2 (amount corresponding to about 0.42-fold of the amount of water required for the maximum swelling of the whole coated film of the photosensitive material and the pigment fixing material) was imparted to the surface of the photosensitive material, and laminated with the above-describe pigment fixing material and the laminate was heated at 80 (degree)  C. for 30 seconds, then, they were released.
      <br/>
      On the released pigment fixing material, a brilliant magenta wedge-formed image was formed.
    </p>
    <p num="358">Then, the amount of water imparted to the photosensitive material after exposure was changed to 4 ml (amount corresponding to about 0.33-fold) and 6 ml (amount corresponding to about 0.50-fold) per 1 m2, and a pigment image was formed on the pigment fixing material in the same manner.</p>
    <p num="359">
      The reflection of the pigment image formed on the pigment fixing material was measured, to obtain a so-called specific curve.

      Using this specific curve, the minimum concentration, the maximum concentration and the shoulder concentration of the specific curve (color developing concentration corresponding to an exposing amount which is lower by 0.6 logE than the exposing amount giving a concentration which is higher by 0.5 than the minimum concentration) were measured.

    <p num="364">Preparation of photosensitive silver halide emulsion (for red sensitive emulsion layer)</p>
    <p num="365">
      1100 ml of distilled water was prepared in a reaction vessel, and to this was added 34 g of lime-processed gelatin, 0.5 g of potassium bromide and 3.4 g of sodium chloride, and the mixture was dissolved at 40 (degree)  C. To this solution was added 50 mg of N,N'-dimethylimidazolidine-2-thione and the mixture was heated to 53 (degree)  C. Then, 280 ml of an aqueous solution containing 51.0 g of silver nitrate and 280 ml of an aqueous solution containing 23.2 g of potassium bromide, 6.1 g of sodium chloride and 0.15 mg of potassium hexachloro iridate (IV) were added with vigorous stirring over 9 minutes. 5 minutes after the completion of the addition, 425 ml of an aqueous solution containing 118.9 g of silver nitrate and 425 ml of an aqueous solution containing 75.0 g of potassium bromide and 4.1 g of sodium chloride were added with vigorous stirring over 24 minutes.
      <br/>
      After the addition, the mixture was kept at 53 (degree)  C. for 10 minutes, then, cooled down to 35 (degree)  C.
    </p>
    <p num="366">
      Then, the pH was reduced to 3.8, and de-salting was conducted by a normal method using a polymer coagulating agent.
      <br/>
      Then, by adding to this 40 g of lime-treated ossein gelatin and 0.1 mg of benzoisothiazolone, pH was controlled to 6.1, pAg was controlled to 7.4 and the temperature was controlled to 60 (degree)  C. To this emulsion 1.35 mg of trimethylthiourea and 110 mg of 4-hydroxy-6-methyl-1,3,3a,7-tetrazaindene were added, and after 5 minutes, 450 mg of a nucleic acid decomposed material was added and chemical sensitization was conducted optimally, then, 200 ml of a methanol solution containing 140 mg of a spectral sensitizing pigment (r1) was added.
      <br/>
      Further, 150 mg of 3-methylureidophenyl-mercaptotetrazole was added, and the mixture was cooled.
      <br/>
      Thus prepared emulsion was named an emulsion R1.

    <p num="367">
      According to observation by an electron microscope, the emulsion R1 was composed of a silver halide particle in the form of a cube having an average particle size of 0.35  MU m, and had a variation coefficient of particle size of 15%.
      <br/>
      Halogen composition of each particle was measured according to an EPMA method regarding this emulsion, to find that the average silver bromide content was 83.5% and the variation coefficient of silver bromide content distribution between particles was 30%.

      Next, an emulsion R3 was prepared in the same manner as for the emulsion B3 excepting that the average particle size was changed to 0.36  MU m by changing the temperature in the particle formation, the spectral sensitizing pigment was changed to the following (r2), and addition of these pigments was conducted at initiation of the chemical sensitization.
      <br/>
      The emulsion R3 has an average silver bromide content of 2.1% and a variation coefficient of silver bromide content distribution between particles of 30%.  (Chemical Structure image '46' not included in text)

      Halogen composition of each particle was measured in the same manner as for the emulsion B3, to find that the average silver bromide content was 2.3% and the variation coefficient of silver iodide content distribution between particles was 12%.

    <p num="373">Next, a photosensitive material 301 was constituted in the same manner as in Example 1, by combining a experiment standard in which the exemplified compound C-12 as a cyan dye forming coupler is combined with the exemplified compound D-5 and the compound (d1) as a developing agent, and a experiment standard in which the exemplified compound C-14 as a cyan dye forming coupler is combined with the exemplified compound (10) and the compound (d1) as a developing agent, with these silver halide emulsions so that the composition shown in Table 20 was obtained.</p>

      The photosensitive materials 301 to 308 were exposed to a light at 2500 lux for 1/50 seconds through an optical wedge and a green filer.

      Then water in an amount corresponding to 12 ml per 1 m2 (amount corresponding to about 0.42-fold of the amount of water required for the maximum swelling of the whole coated film of the photosensitive material and the pigment fixing material) was imparted to the surface of the photosensitive material, and laminated with the above-describe pigment fixing material and the laminate was heated at 80 (degree)  C. for 30 seconds, then, they were released.
      <br/>
      On the released pigment fixing material, a brilliant cyan wedge-formed image was formed.
    </p>
    <p num="387">Then, the amount of water imparted to the photosensitive material after exposure was changed to 4 ml (amount corresponding to about 0.34-fold) and 6 ml (amount corresponding to about 0.51-fold) per 1 m2, and a pigment image was formed on the pigment fixing material in the same manner.</p>
    <p num="388">
      The reflection of the pigment image formed on the pigment fixing material was measured, to obtain a so-called specific curve.

      The photosensitive materials 401 to 404 were exposed to a light at 2500 lux for 1/50 seconds through an optical wedge and a red filer, green filter and blue filter.
      <br/>
      Then water in an amount corresponding to 12 ml per 1 m2 (amount corresponding to about 0.6-fold of the amount of water required for the maximum swelling of the whole coated film of the photosensitive material and the pigment fixing material) was imparted to the surface of the photosensitive material, and laminated with the above-describe pigment fixing material and the laminate was heated at 80 (degree)  C. for 30 seconds, then, they were released.
      <br/>
      On the release pigment fixing material, brilliant cyan, magenta and magenta wedge-formed images were formed, the colors being in complementary relation to the exposed light.
    </p>
    <p num="402">Then, the amount of water imparted to the photosensitive material after exposure was changed to 10 ml (amount corresponding to about 0.5-fold) and 14 ml (amount corresponding to about 0.7-fold) per 1 m2, and a pigment image was formed on the pigment fixing material in the same manner.</p>
    <p num="403">
      The reflection of the pigment image formed on the pigment fixing material was measured, to obtain a so-called specific curve.
      <br/>
      Using this specific curve, the minimum concentration, the maximum concentration and the shoulder concentration of the specific curve (color developing concentration corresponding to an exposing amount which is lower by 0.6 logE than the exposing amount giving a concentration which is higher by 0.5 than the minimum concentration) were measured.

      The photosensitive materials 501 to 504 were exposed to a light based on a digital information controlled so that a wedge formed image was obtained for sensitometry of cyan, magenta and yellow using digital color printer Fujix Pictorography PG-3000 manufacture by Fuji Photo Film Cor., Ltd, and then water in an amount corresponding to 12 ml per 1 m2 (amount corresponding to about 0.60-fold of the amount of water required for the maximum swelling of the whole coated film of the photosensitive material and the pigment fixing material) was imparted between the photosensitive material and a pigment fixing material, and the photosensitive material was laminated with the pigment fixing material and the laminate was heated at 80 (degree)  C. for 30 seconds, for conducting image formation.
      <br/>
      On the pigment fixing material, a brilliant color image was formed.
    </p>
    <p num="435">Then, the amount of water imparted to the photosensitive material after exposure was changed to 10 ml (amount corresponding to about 0.50-fold) and 14 ml (amount corresponding to about 0.69-fold) per 1 m , and a pigment image was formed on the pigment fixing material in the same manner.</p>
    <p num="436">The maximum concentration and the minimum concentration were measured by using a reflection densitometer X-lite 304 manufactured by X-like Corp.</p>
