      RNA enzymes or ribozymes can act as endoribonucleases, catalyzing the cleavage of RNA molecules with a sequence specificity of cleavage greater than that of known ribonucleases and approaching that of the DNA restriction endonucleases, thus serving as RNA sequence specific endoribonucleases.
      <br/>
      An example is a shortened form of the self-splicing ribosomal RNA intervening sequence of Tetrahymena (L-19 IVS RNA).
      <br/>
      Site-specific mutagenesis of the enzyme active site of the L-19 IVS RNA alters the substrate sequence specificity in a predictable manner, allowing a set of sequence-specific endoribonucleases to be synthesized.
      <br/>
      Varying conditions allow the ribozyme to act as a polymerase (nucleotidyltransferase), a dephosphorylase (acid phosphatase or phosphotransferase) or a sequence-specific endoribonuclease.

    <p num="3">This invention concerns compositions of RNA functioning as an RNA enzyme, i.e. a ribozyme in several capacities: dephosphorylase (acid phosphatase and transphosphorylase), ribonucleotidyl transferase (polymerase activity) and sequence-specific endoribonuclease activities.</p>
    <heading>SUMMARY</heading>
    <p num="4">It is found that purified ribonucleic acid (RNA) can serve as an enzyme acting on other RNA molecules in vitro (ribozyme) as a: 1) dephosphorylating enzyme catalyzing the removal of 3' terminal phosphate of RNA in a sequence-specific manner, 2) RNA polymerase (nucleotidyl transferase) catalyzing the conversion of oligoribonucleotides to polyribonucleotides, 3) sequence specific endoribonuclease. (This latter activity is also referred to as RNA restriction endanuclease or endoribonuclease activity.)</p>

      Methods: L-19 IVS RNA was synthesized by methods similar to those described previously (Zaug, A. J., and Cech, T. R., (1986) Science 231:470-475), except a different RNA polymerase-template system was used.
      <br/>
      Plasmid pT7-TT1A3 (which contains a T7 RNA polymerase promoter, a 42 bp 5' exon, the entire 413 bp IVS, and an 82 bp 3' exon) was cleaved with Eco RI and transcribed with bacteriophage T7 RNA polymerase (Davanloo, P., et al. (1984) Proc. Nat'l. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 81: 2035-2039).
      <br/>
      The transcripts were incubated further under self-splicing, cyclization, and site-specific hydrolysis conditions to produce L-19 IVS RNA (Zaug, A. J., et al. (1984) Science 224:574-578; Zaug,-A. J. and Cech, T. R., (1986) Science 231:470-475).

      <br/>
      Substrate RNAs were produced by T7 RNA polymerase transcription of BamHI-cleaved pAK105 (Mount, S. M., et al. (1983) Cell 33:509-518), XmnI- or ScaI-cleaved pT 7-1 (purchased from U.S. Biochemical Corp.), and SnaBI-cleaved pDW27, which encodes Ml RNA (obtained from D. Wahl and N. Pace).

(B) C5 (0.01 uM) was reacted with 0.16 uM L-19 IVS RNA.

      FIG. 8 Model for the enzymatic mechanism of the L-19 IVS RNA.
      <br/>
      The RNA catalyzes cleavage and rejoining of oligo(C) by the pathway 1 -2 -3 -4 -1.
      <br/>
      The L-19 IVS RNA enzyme (1) is shown with the oligopyrimidine binding site (RRRRRR, six purines) near its 5' end and G414 with a free 3'-hydroxyl group at its 3' end.
      <br/>
      The complex folded core structure of the molecule (Davies, R. W., et al., (1982) Nature (London) 300:719; Waring, R. B., et al. (1983) J. Mol. Biol. 167:595; Michel, F., et al. (1983) EMBO J. 2:33; Cech, T. R., et al. (1983) Proc. Nat'l. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 80:3903; Inoue, T., et al. (1985) ibid 82:648) is simply represented by a curved line.
      <br/>
      The enzyme binds its substrate (C5) by Watson-Crick base-pairing to form the noncovalent enzyme-substrate complex (2).
      <br/>
      Nucleophilic attack by G414 leads to formation of the covalent intermediate (3).
      <br/>
      With the pentanucleotide C5 as substrate, the covalent intermediate is usually loaded with a single nucleotide, as shown; with substrates of longer chain length, an oligonucleotide can be attached to the 3' end of G414.
      <br/>
      If C5 binds to the intermediate (3) in the manner shown in (4), transesterification can occur to give the new product C6 and regenerate the enzyme (1).
      <br/>
      Note that all four reactions in this pathway are reversible.
      <br/>
      When acting as a ribonuclease, the L-19 IVS RNA follows the pathway 1 -2 -3 -1.
      <br/>
      The covalent intermediate (3) undergoes hydrolysis, releasing the nucleotide or oligonucleotide attached to its 3' end (in this case pC) and regenerating the enzyme (1).

      <br/>
      The analysis was limited to the smaller products because their production is affected only by the first transesterification reaction (FIG. 8).
      <br/>
      Although d-C5 is inactive in the first transesterification reaction, it has some activity as a substrate in the second transesterification reaction (Zaug, A., et al. unpublished data) and therefore could affect the production of chains of length greater than 5. (C) Km /Vmax, determined from the slopes of the lines in (B), is plotted against the inhibitor concentration.

    <p num="26">
      The Tetrahymena rRNA intervening sequence (IVS) is a catalytic RNA molecule or ribozyme.
      <br/>
      It mediates RNA self-splicing, accomplishing its own excision from the large ribosomal RNA precursor, and subsequently converts itself to a circular form (Kruger, K., et al. (1982) Cell 31:147-157; Zaug, A. J., et al. (1983) Nature 301:578-583).
      <br/>
      In these reactions, the splice sites and cyclization sites can be viewed as intramolecular substrates for an activity that resides within the IVS RNA (Zaug, A. J., et al. (1984) Science 224:574-578).
      <br/>
      This is not a true enzymatic reaction however since the RNA is not regenerated in its original form at the end of the self-splicing reaction.
      <br/>
      The IVS RNA when in its linear form is referred to as L IVS RNA.
    </p>
    <p num="27">
      This view has been validated by studies of the L-19 IVS RNA, a linear form of the IVS which is missing the first 19 nucleotides.
      <br/>
      Because it lacks the cyclization sites, the L-19 IVS RNA cannot undergo intramolecular reactions (Zaug, A. J. , et al. (1984) Science 224:574-578).
      <br/>
      It still retains activity, however, and can catalyze cleavage-ligation reactions on other RNA molecules (Zaug, A. J. and Cech, T. R. (1986) Science 231:470-475).
      <br/>
      When provided with oligo(cytidylic acid) as a substrate, the L-19 TVS RNA acts as an enzyme with nucleotidyltransferase �poly(C) polymerase� and phosphodiesterase (ribonuclease) activities (Zaug, A. J. and Cech, T. R. (1986) Science 231:470-475).
      <br/>
      With 3'-phosphorylated oligo(C) substrates, the same ribozyme acts as a phosphotransferase and an acid phosphatase (Zaug, A. J. and Cech, T. R. (1986) Biochemistry 25:4478-4482).
      <br/>
      A key mechanistic feature of all four of these reactions is the formation of a covalent enzyme-substrate intermediate in which a nucleotide or phosphate is esterified through the 3'-O of G414, the 3' terminal guanosine of the IVS RNA.
      <br/>
      In addition, we describe herein a fifth enzymatic activity concerning the endoribonuclease activity of the L-19 IVS RNA on other RNA molecules.
    </p>
    <p num="28">
      Following self-splicing of the Tetrahymena rRNA precursor, the excised IVS RNA (Abbreviations: IVS, intervening sequence or intron: L-19 IVS RNA (read "L minus 19"), a 395-nt RNA missing the first 19 nt of the L IVS RNA (the direct product of pre-ribosomal RNA splicing); , 32 P within an oligonucleotide, that is, C5 C is CpCpCpCpC32 pC and C5 is 32 pCpCpCpCpC; d-C5, deoxyC5) undergoes a series of RNA-mediated cyclization and site-specific hydrolysis reactions.
      <br/>
      The final product, the L-19 IVS RNA, is a linear molecule that does not have the first 19 nucleotides of the original excised IVS RNA (Zaug, A. J., et al., Science 224:574 (1984).
      <br/>
      We interpreted the lack of further reaction of the L-19 species as an indication that all potential reaction sites on the molecule that could reach its active site (that is, intramolecular substrates) had been consumed; and we argued that the activity was probably unperturbed (Zaug, A. J., et al., Science 224:574 (1984) (L IVS RNA is linear IVS RNA).
      <br/>
      We have now tested this by adding oligonucleotide substrates to the L-19 IVS RNA.
      <br/>
      We find that each IVS RNA molecule can catalyze the cleavage and rejoining of many oligonucleotides.
      <br/>
      Thus, the L-19 IVS RNA is a true enzyme.
      <br/>
      Although the enzyme can act on RNA molecules of large size and complex sequence, we have found that studies with simple oligoribonucleotides like pC5 (pentacytidylic acid) have been most valuable in revealing the minimum substrate requirements and reaction mechanism of this enzyme.
    </p>
    <p num="29">Nucleotidyltransferase or RNA Polymerase Activity</p>
    <p num="30">
      When the shortened form of the self-splicing ribosomal RNA (rRNA) intervening sequence of Tetrahymena thermophila acts as a nucleotidyl transferase, it catalyzes the cleavage and rejoining of oligonucleotide substrates in a sequence-dependent manner with Km =42 uM and kcat =2 min-1.
      <br/>
      The reaction mechanism resembles that of rRNA precursor self-slicing.
      <br/>
      With pentacytidylic acid as the substrate, successive cleavage and rejoining reactions lead to the synthesis of polycytidylic acid.
      <br/>
      When the active site is changed from the natural nucleotide sequence GGAGGG to the sequence GAAAAG, oligouridylic acid is polymerized to polyuridylic acid �Been and Cech, Cell 47:207 (1986)�. Thus, the RNA molecule can act as an RNA polymerase, differing from the protein enzyme in that it uses an internal rather than an external template.
      <br/>
      Thus various heteropolymers would be constructed by varient RNA enzyme forms.
      <br/>
      This predicts the formation for example of messenger RNA molecules for particular peptides or proteins.
      <br/>
      This messenger could be synthesized with or without introns.
      <br/>
      At about pH 9, the same RNA enzyme has activity as a sequence-specific ribonuclease.
    </p>
    <p num="31">
      With C5 as substrate, the L-19 IVS RNA makes poly(C) with chain lengths of 30 nucleotides and longer, acting as an RNA polymerase or nucleotidyl transferase.
      <br/>
      Thus longer oligonucleotides (polynucleotides) can be formed from short oligonucleotide starting material.
      <br/>
      The number of P--O bonds is unchanged in the process.
      <br/>
      In the synthesis of poly(C) on a poly(dG) template by RNA polymerase, one CTP is cleaved for each residue polymerized.
      <br/>
      Thus, the RNA polymerase reaction is also conservative with respect to the number of P--O bonds in the system.
      <br/>
      The L-19 IVS RNA can therefore be considered to be a poly(C) polymerase that uses C4 pC instead of pppC as a substrate.
      <br/>
      It incorporates pC units at the 3' end of the growing chain and releases C4 ; the C4 is analogous to the pyrophosphate released by RNA polymerase.
      <br/>
      Synthesis is directed by a template, but the template is internal to the RNA enzyme.
      <br/>
      It may be possible to physically separate the template portion from the catalytic portion of the RNA enzyme with retention of activity.
      <br/>
      If so, the RNA enzyme could conceivably act as a primordial RNA replicase, catalyzing both its own replication and that of other RNA molecules (T. R. Cech, (1986) Proc. Nat'l. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 83:4360-4363.
    </p>
    <p num="32">
      The L-19 IVS RNA catalyzes the cleavage-ligation of pC5 with Km =42 uM, kcat =2 min-1, and kcat /Km =1 * 103 sec-1 M-1.
      <br/>
      The Km is typical of that of protein enzymes.
      <br/>
      The kcat and kcat /Km are lower than those of many protein enzymes.
      <br/>
      However, kcat is well within the range of values for proteins that recognize specific nucleic acid sequences and catalyze chain cleavage or initiation of polymerization.
      <br/>
      For example, Eco RI restriction endonuclease cleaves its recognition sequence in various DNA substrates, including a specific 8-bp DNA fragment, with kcat =1 min-1 to 18 min (Greene, P. J., et al. (1975) J. Mol. Biol. 99:237; Modrich, et al. (1976) J. Biol. Chem. 251:5866; Wells, R. D., et al. (1981) Enzymes 14:157; Brennan, M. B., et al. in preparation; and Terry, B., et al. in preparation) The kcat is also similar to that of the RNA enzyme ribonuclease P, which cleaves the precursor to tRNA with kcat =2 min (Guerrier-Takada, C., et al. (1983) Cell 35:849; Marsh, T. L., et al. in Sequence Specificity in Transcription and Translation, R. Calendar and L. Gold Eds., UCLA Symposium on Molecular and Cellular Biology (Plenum, N.Y., in press)).
    </p>
    <p num="33">
      Another way to gauge the catalytic effectiveness of the L-19 IVS RNA is to compare the rate of the catalyzed reaction to the basal chemical rate.
      <br/>
      A transesterification reaction between two free oligonucleotides has never been observed, and hence the uncatalyzed rate is unknown.
      <br/>
      On the other hand, the rate of hydrolysis of simple phosphate diesters has been studied (Kumamoto, J., et al. (1956) J. Am. Chem. Soc. 78:4858; P. C. Haake et al. ibid. (1961) 83:1102; Kirby, A. J., et al. (1970) J. Chem. Soc. Ser. B., p. 1165; Bunton, C. A., et al. (1969) J. Org. Chem. 34:767)).
      <br/>
      The second-order rate constant for alkaline hydrolysis of the labile phosphodiester bond in the circular IVS RNA (Zaug, A. J., et al. (1985) Biochemistry 24:6211) is 12 orders of magnitude higher than that of dimethyl phosphate (Kumamoto, J., et al. (1956) Supra) and ten orders of magnitude higher than that expected for a normal phosphodiester bond in RNA (The rate of nucleophilic attack by hydroxide ion on phosphate esters is sensitive to the pKa of the conjugate acid of the leaving group.
      <br/>
      A phosphate in RNA should be more reactive than dimethyl phosphate, because pKa =12.5 for a nucleoside ribose and pKa =15.5 for methanol �values at 25 (degree)  C. from P.O.P. T'so, Basic Principles in Nucleic Acid Chemistry (Academic Press, New York, (1974), vol. I, pp. 462-463 and P. Ballinger and F. A. Long, J. Am. Chem. Soc. 82:795 (1960), respectively).
      <br/>
      On the basis of the kinetic data available for the alkaline hydrolysis of phosphate diesters (Kumamoto, J., et al. (1956) J. Am. Chem. Soc. 78:4858; Haake, P. C. (1961) et al. ibid. 83:1102; Kirby, A. J., et al. (1970) J. Chem. Soc. Ser. B., p. 1165; Bunton, C. A., et al. (1969) J. Org. Chem. 34:767), the slope of a graph of the logarithm of the rate constant for hydrolysis as a function of pKa can be roughly estimated as 0.6. Thus, RNA is expected to be more reactive than dimethyl phosphate by a factor of 100.6 (15.5-12.5) =101.8. The estimate for RNA pertains to direct attack by OH- on the phosphate, resulting in 3'-hydroxyl and 5'-phosphate termini.
      <br/>
      Cleavage of RNA by OH- -catalyzed transphos-phorylation, producing a 2',3'-cyclic phosphate, is a much more rapid (intramolecular) reaction but is not relevant to the reactions of the L-19 IVS RNA).
      <br/>
      On the basis of the data of FIG. 7D, the covalent enzyme-substrate complex undergoes hydrolysis at approximately the same rate as the equivalent bond in the circular IVS RNA.
      <br/>
      Thus, we estimate that the L-19 IVS RNA in its ribonuclease mode enhances the rate of hydrolysis of its substrate about 1010 times.
    </p>
    <p num="34">
      The RNA moiety of ribonuclease P, the enzyme responsible for cleaving transfer RNA (tRNA) precursors to generate the mature 5 ' end of the tRNA, is an example of an RNA enzyme molecule.

      However, this enzyme catalyzes only a specific tRNA reaction without general RNA activity.
      <br/>
      The specificity is such that a variety of single base changes in the t-RNA portion of the pre-tRNA substrate prevent the enzyme from cleaving the substrate.

    <p num="36">
      We have also found that the same enzyme has activity toward phosphate monoesters.
      <br/>
      The 3'-phosphate of C5 p or C6 p is transferred to the 3'-terminal guanosine of the enzyme.
      <br/>
      The pH dependence of the reaction (optimum at pH 5) indicates that the enzyme has activity toward the dianion and much greater activity toward the monoanion form of the 3'-phosphate of the substrate.
      <br/>
      Phosphorylation of the enzyme is reversible by C5 --OH and other oligo(pyrimidines) such as UCU--OH.
      <br/>
      Thus, the RNA enzyme acts as a phosphotransferase, transferring the 3'-terminal phosphate of C5 p to UCU--OH with multiple turnover.
      <br/>
      At pH 4 and 5, the phosphoenzyme undergoes slow hydrolysis to yield inorganic phosphate.
      <br/>
      Thus, the enzyme has acid phosphatase activity.
      <br/>
      These are the two aspects of its dephosphorylase activity.
      <br/>
      The RNA enzyme dephosphorylates oligonucleotide substrates with high sequence specificity, which distinguishes it from known protein enzymes.

    <p num="37">
      The L-19 IVS RNA has transphosphorylation activity toward 3'-phosphorylated oligo(C) substrates.
      <br/>
      The properties of the transphosphorylation reaction indicate that it is taking place in the same active site as the poly(C) polymerase and ribonuclease reactions (FIG. 15).
      <br/>
      The properties include the specificity of the reactions for oligo(C) substrates, the production of oligo(C) products with 3'-hydroxyl termini, and the formation of similar covalent enzyme-substrate complexes.
      <br/>
      The presumptive intermediate is a phosphoenzyme, E-p, in the case of the phosphotransferase reaction and a nucleotidyl enzyme, E-pC or E-(pC)n, in the case of the poly(C) polymerase and ribonuclease reactions (Zaug &amp; Cech, (1986) Science (Wash., D.C. 231:470-475).
      <br/>
      In both cases the presumptive covalent intermediate involves a phosphate ester linkage through the 3'-O of G414 of the L-19 IVS RNA (Zaug and Cech, unpublished results).

    <p num="38">
      The transphosphorylation reaction is readily reversible.

    <p num="39">
      Thus, the L-19 IVS RNA has transphosphorylation activity resembling that of Escherichia coli alkaline phosphatase (Reid &amp; Wilsor, (1971) Enzymes (3rd Ed.) 4:373-415); Coleman &amp; Gettins, (1983) Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Area Mol. Biol., 55:381), acid phosphatase, and a variety of other phosphotransferases that form covalent enzyme-substrate intermediates (Knowles, (1980) Ann. Rev. Biochem. 49:877).
      <br/>
      In addition, the L-19 IVS RNA phosphoenzyme can transfer its phosphate to water at pH 4 and 5, indicating it has acid phosphatase activity.
    </p>
    <p num="40">
      As the pH is lowered from 7.5 to 5.0, the rate of the transphosphorylation reaction increases substantially.
      <br/>
      In this same pH range, the 3'-phosphate of C5 p is converted to a monoanion �pKa approximately 6.0, based on the value for cytidine 3'-phosphate from Ts'o �(1974) Basic Principles in Nucleic Acid Chemistry vol. 1, pp. 462 Academic, New York �. Protonation of a phosphate monoester makes it possible for it to react like a diester (Benkovic &amp; Schray, (1973) Enzymes (3rd Ed.) 8:235).
      <br/>
      Thus, it seems reasonable that an enzyme known to react with diesters could use the same mechanism to react with monoester monoanions.
      <br/>
      The acidic pH requirement for hydrolysis of the phosphoenzyme can be similarly explained if the reaction occurs by attack of water on the phosphate monoester monoanion.
      <br/>
      The pH independence of transphosphorylation between pH 7.5 and pH 9.0 strongly suaqests that the monoester dianion is also reactive, albeit at a rate less than 5% that of the monoester moncoanion.
      <br/>
      The reactivity of the monoester dianion is surprising and perhaps indicates that the enzyme provides electrophilic assistance to the departure of the leaving group with a proton or metal ion.
    </p>
    <p num="41">
      At alkaline pH the phosphodiester bond following G414 is labile in the circular IVS RNA (Zaug et al., 1984 Science (Wash., D.C. 224:574), in the pre-rRNA (Inoue et al., 1986, J. Mol. Biol. 189:143), and in E-pC (Zaug, A. J., and Cech, T., 1986, Science (Wash., D.C.) 231:470-475), whereas the phosphomonoester bond following G414 is stable in E-p.
      <br/>
      Specific hydrolysis of the phosphodiester bonds involves attack of hydroxide ion (Zaug, A. J. et al., (1985) Biochemistry 24:6211).
      <br/>
      It is not surprising that attack of hydroxide ion on the phosphate monoester dianion of E-p might be prohibited due to electrostatic repulsion (Kirby &amp; Younas, (1970) J. Chem. Soc. B, 1165).

    <p num="42">
      At pH 5 the phosphoenzyme undergoes very slow hydrolysis but readily transfers its phospho group to C5 --OH.
      <br/>
      The rate of the hydrolysis reaction is 2-3 orders of magnitude slower than that of the phospho transfer reaction, even though H2 O is present at 55 M and the oligonucleotide at less than 1 uM.
      <br/>
      Thus, C5 --OH is a better acceptor than H2 O by a factor exceeding 1010. �Such a large factor is not unusual for phosphotransferases; for example, Ray et al. (1976) Biochemistry 15:4006 report that phosphoglucomutase transfers a phosphate to the C-6 hydroxyl of glucose 1-phosphate at a rate 3 * 1010 times greater than that of transfer to H2 O.� The difference in rate is much too large to be explained by the greater nucleophilicity of the 3'-hydroxyl of C5 --OH than H2 O, which could perhaps account for a factor of 10 (Lohrmann &amp; Orgel (1978) Tetrahedron 34:853; Kirby &amp; Varvoglis, (1967) J. Am. Chem. Soc. 89:415-423).
      <br/>
      Most of the difference in rate probably reflects the ability of the enzyme to utilize the binding energy from its interaction with non-reacting portions of C5 --OH (Jencks, W. P., 1975, Adv.
      <br/>
      Enzymol. Relat. Areas Md. Biol. 43:219).
      <br/>
      For example, specific binding interactions could precisely position the 3'-hydroxyl of C5 --OH for displacement of the phosphate from the enzyme, but would not be available to facilitate the addition of water.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, the catalytic apparatus may not be fully assembled until the acceptor oligonucleotide is in place and water is absent (Koshland, (1963) Cold Spring Harbor Symp.

      We are only beginning to understand how the L-19 IVS RNA catalyzes phospho transfer.
      <br/>
      The overall transfer reaction is undoubtedly facilitated by the formation of a covalent bond between the enzyme and the phosphate of the substrate.
      <br/>
      Such covalent catalysis is common in enzyme-catalyzed group transfer reactions (Jencks, (1969) Catalysis in Chemistry and Enzymology McGraw-Hill, New York; Walsh, (1979) Enzymatic Reaction Mechanisms W. H. Freeman, San Francisco).

      Binding sites within the IVS RNA for the oligo(pyrimidine) substrate (Zaug &amp; Cech, (1986) Science (Wash., D.C. 231:470-475) and for the nucleophilic G residue at its own 3' end (N. K. Tanner and T. R. Cech, unpublished results) contribute to the catalysis of the transfer reactions.
      <br/>
      These binding interactions presumably place the 3'-hydroxyl group of G414 in an optimal orientation for nucleophilic attack on the terminal phosphate of C5 p (FIG. 15B) or on an internal phosphate of C5 --OH (FIG. 15A).
      <br/>
      We suspect that catalysis might also involve a specific role for Mg2+ �Steffens et al., (1973) J. Am. Chem. Soc. 95:936 and (1975) Biochemistry 14:2431; Anderson et al. , (1977) J. Am. Chem.

      One unanswered question concerns the extremely low extent of nucleotidyl transfer with the C5 p substrate at neutral pH.
      <br/>
      Since C5 --OH is readily attacked at the phosphate following the fourth C to produce E-pC, why is C5 p not attacked at the equivalent phosphate to produce E-pCp? Perhaps the terminal phosphate of C5 p is coordinated to Mg(II) or serves as a hydrogen bond acceptor, resulting in a preferred mode of binding different from that of C5 --OH.

      This length and sequence specificity is explained by the requirement that the substance must bind to the enzyme by Watson-Crick base pairing to the guanosine-rich active site (FIG. 15).

      <br/>
      Unless these activities can be separated, the usefulness of the enzyme as a reagent for dephosphorylation of RNA is limited.

    <p num="48">Endoribonuclease or "RNA Restriction Endonuclease" Activity</p>
    <p num="49">
      We describe here a fifth enzymatic activity of the Tetrahymena ribozyme.
      <br/>
      It cleaves other RNA molecules at sequences that resemble the 5' splice site of the rRNA precursor.
      <br/>
      Cleavage is concomitant with addition of a free guanosine nucleotide to the 5' end of the downstream RNA fragment; thus, one product can be readily end-labeled during the reaction.
      <br/>
      The reaction is analogous to the first step of pre-rRNA self-splicing (FIGS. 1A-1B).
      <br/>
      Cleavage does not require nucleotide G414 of the ribozyme; thus, unlike the first four activities, it does not involve formation of a covalent enzyme-substrate intermediate.
      <br/>
      Thus there exists as a result of the work of the invention sequence-specific endoribonucleases, protein-free i.e. able to act in the absence of protein, and composed of RNA, which are enzymatically active on other RNA molecules.
      <br/>
      These RNA ribozymes act on exogenous RNA.
      <br/>
      Thus the enzyme or ribozyme is composed of RNA and the substrate is RNA (or mixed RNA-DNA polymers)
    </p>
    <p num="50">
      The ribozyme has high specificity for cleavage after the nucleotide sequence CUCU; under stringent conditions it can discriminate against sites that have a 3-out-of-4 match to this recognition sequence.
      <br/>
      For example, in a solution containing 2.5 M urea the ribozyme cleaves after CUCU while ignoring the related sequences CUGU and CGCU (FIG. 3c).
      <br/>
      The sequence specificity approaches that of the DNA restriction endonucleases (Nathans, D. and Smith, H. O. (1975) Annu. Rev. Biochem. 44:273-293).
      <br/>
      We further show that site-specific mutations in the active site of the IVS RNA, the so-called internal guide sequence (Davies, R. W., et al. (1982) Nature 300:719-724; Waring, R. B., et al. (1986) Nature 321:133-139) or 5' exon-binding site (Inoue, T., et al. (1985) Cell 43:431-437; Garriga, G., et al. (1986) Nature 322:86-89; Been, M. D. and Cech, T. R., (1986) Cell 47, 207-216), alter the sequence specificity of the ribozyme in a predictable manner.
      <br/>
      In its endoribonuclease mode, the L-19 IVS RNA recognizes four or more nucleotides in choosing a reaction site.
      <br/>
      Protein ribonucleases that are active on single-stranded RNA substrates have specificity only at the mononucleotide level (for example, ribonuclease T1 cleaves after guanosine).
      <br/>
      Thus the L-19 has more base-sequence specificity for single-stranded RNA than any known protein ribonuclease, and may approach the specificity of some of the DNA restriction endonucleases.
      <br/>
      An attractive feature of this new RNA enribonuclease is that its substrate specificity can be completely and predictably changed by altering the sequence of the internal binding site.
    </p>
    <p num="51">
      The endoribonuclease reaction is analogous to the first step of pre-rRNA self-splicing (FIGS. 1A-1B).
      <br/>
      Both the enzymatic and the self-splicing reactions make use of the same two binding sites, an oligopyrimidine-binding site and a guanosine-binding site, to achieve specificity and to contribute to catalysis.
      <br/>
      The oligopyrimidine-binding site is also known as the 5' guide sequence (Waring, R. B., et al. (1986) Nature 321:133-139) or the 5' exon-binding site (Inoue, T., et al. (1985) Cell 43:431, Garriga, G., et al. (1986) Nature 322:86-89, Been, M. D. and Cech, T. R., Cell (1986) 47, 207-216).
      <br/>
      Its role in self-splicing has been conclusively demonstrated by the analysis of single-base mutations and second-site suppressor mutations (Waring, R. B., et al. (1986) Supra; Been, M. D. and Cech, T. R., (1986) Supra; Perea, J. and Jacq, C., (1985) EMBO, J. 4:3281).
      <br/>
      The role of these same nucleotides in the endoribonuclease reaction is demonstrated by the change in substrate specificity of the mutant enzymes (FIGS. 3B-3C) , the altered specificity being predictable by the rules of Watson-Crick base pairing.
      <br/>
      The guanosine-binding site involved in self-splicing has not been localized to a particular set of nucleotides, but its general features have been described (Bass, B. L. and Cech, T. R., (1984) Nature 308:820; (1986) Biochemistry 25:4473).
      <br/>
      The endoribonuclease activity appears to make use of the same guanosine-binding site by the following criteria: in both cases guanosine is as active as GTP, whereas UTP, CTP, ATP and dGTP have little if any activity.
      <br/>
      In addition, the Km of 44 uM for GTP shown is in reasonable agreement to the value of 32 +- 8 uM determined for self-splicing under somewhat different reaction conditions (Bass, B. L. and Cech, T. R., Biochemistry (1986) Supra).
    </p>
    <p num="52">
      The endoribonuclease activity of the L-19 IVS RNA does not require its 3'-terminal guanosine (G414).
      <br/>
      In this respect it differs from the nucleotidyl transfer, phospho transfer and hydrolytic activities of the same enzyme.
      <br/>
      In those reactions G414 participates in a covalent enzyme-substrate complex that appears to be an obligatory reaction intermediate (Zaug, A. J. and Cech, T. R. (1986) Science 231:470-475; Zaug, A. J. and Cech, T. R. (1986) Biochemistry 25:4478).
      <br/>
      Thus, the L-19 IVS RNA is not restricted to reaction mechanisms involving formation of a covalent enzyme-substrate intermediate.
      <br/>
      It an also catalyze bisubstrate reactions by a single-displacement mechanism.
      <br/>
      Ribonuclease P, an RNA enzyme that catalyzes cleavage by hydrolysis rather than by transesterification, also appears to act without formation of a covalent intermediate (Marsh, T. L., et al. (1985) Science 229:79-81; Guerrier-Takeda, C., et al. (1986) Biochemistry 25:1509).
    </p>
    <p num="53">
      The L-19 IVS RNA endoribonuclease activity reported here appears to require single-stranded RNA substrates.
      <br/>
      Based on work recently reported by Szostak ((1986) Nature 322:83-86), it seems possible that a smaller version of the Tetrahymena IVS RNA missing its 5' exon-binding site may have an endoribonuclease activity that requires a base-paired substrate.
      <br/>
      The substrate tested by Szostak ((1986) Nature Supra) was an RNA fragment containing the end of the 5' exon paired with the 5' exon-binding site.
      <br/>
      However, this RNA "substrate" also included a substantial portion of the IVS RNA, so it remains to be established whether the ribozyme has endoribonuclease activity with double-stranded RNA substrates in general.
    </p>
    <p num="54">
      Potential usefulness of sequence-specific RNA endoribonucleases.
      <br/>
      Sequence-specific endoribonucleases might have many of the same applications for the study of RNA that DNA restriction endonucleases have for the study of DNA (Nathans, D. and Smith, H. O., (1975) Ann. Rev. Biochem. 44:273).
      <br/>
      For example, the pattern of restriction fragments could be used to establish sequence relationships between two related RNAs, and large RNAs could be specifically cleaved to fragments of a size more useful for study.
      <br/>
      The 4-nucleotide specificity of the ribozyme is ideal for cleavage of RNAs of unknown sequence; an RNA of random sequence would have an average of 1 cleavage site every 256 bases.
      <br/>
      In addition, the automatic end-labelling of one fragment during ribozyme cleavage is a practical advantage.
    </p>
    <p num="55">
      Development of the ribozymes as useful tools for molecular biology has begun.
      <br/>
      The efficiency of cleavage of large RNA substrates needs to be increased so that complete digests rather than partial digests can be obtained.
      <br/>
      The effects of denaturants such as urea and formamide must be further explored; they appear to increase the sequence specificity of cleavage, and at the same time they should melt structure in the substrate to maximize the availability of target sequences.
      <br/>
      Finally, mutagenesis of the active site of the ribozyme by those skilled in the art can be accomplished to ascertain all possible permutations of the 256 possible tetranucleotide cleavage enzymes.
    </p>
    <p num="56">
      RNA sequence recognition.
      <br/>
      Protein ribonucleases can cleave RNA substrates with high specificity by recognizing a combination of RNA structure and sequence, with the emphasis on structure (e.g., RNase III (Robertson, H. D. (1982) Cell 30:669) and RNase M5 (Stahl, D. A., et al. (1980) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 77:5644).
      <br/>
      Known proteins that cleave single-stranded RNA substrates, on the other hand, have specificity only at the mononucleotide or dinucleotide level (e.g., RNase T1 cleaves after guanosines (Egami, F., et al. (1980) Molec Biol.
      <br/>
      Biochem. Biophys. 32:250-277�. Thus, the L-19 IVS RNA has considerably more base-sequence specificity for cleaving single-stranded RNA than any known protein ribonuclease.
    </p>
    <p num="57">Variant Ribozymes (or Other Versions of the Ribozyme that Retain Activity)</p>
    <p num="58">
      Earlier work on sequence requirements for self-splicing (Price, J. V., et al. (1985) Nucleic Acid.
      <br/>
      Res. 13:1871) show that sequence requirements can be examined as shown therein by insertions and deletions to obtain other self-splicing IVS RNA's.
      <br/>
      In like manner, we could alter the L-19 IVS RNA to obtain an array of RNA sequence-specific endoribonuclease molecules.
      <br/>
      Thus three regions were found by Price et al. to be necessary for IVS self-splicing.
      <br/>
      Similar experiments would reveal necessary portions of L-19 IVS RNA for endoribonuclease activity.
      <br/>
      Burke, J. M., et al. (1986) Cell 45:167-176 show the role of conserved elements for the IVS self-splicing sequence; that work shows a further use of mutagenesis experiments to alter the highly conserved sequences to alter activity thereof.
      <br/>
      Just so, in like manner, the activity of the L-19 IVS RNA can be altered with accompanying alteration in activity to effect an array of endoribnucleases.
    </p>
    <p num="59">
      Cech, T. R., et al. have recently found a yet smaller piece of the L-19 IVS RNA which contains full enzymatic activity and comprises nucleotides 19-331 of the RNA.
      <br/>
      It is also found that the 21-331 piece is fully active.
      <br/>
      Plasmids have been constructed to produce the L-19 and L-21 IVS RNA strands directly.
      <br/>
      Here the promoter is moved to the 19 position or 21 position and the DNA coding for the restriction site is at the 331 position instead of the 414 site.

    <heading>EXAMPLE I</heading>
    <p num="89">Sequence-Specific Cleavage of Large RNAs</p>
    <p num="90">
      The L-19 IVS RNA enzyme was prepared by incubation of pre-rRNA under conditions that promote self-splicing, cyclization, and site-specific hydrolysis, (Zaug, A. J., et al. (1984) Science 224:574; Zaug, A. J., et al. (1986) Science 231:470).
      <br/>
      The 3'-terminal guanosine (G414 ) was then removed from the L-19 IVS RNA by periodate oxidation followed by beta-elimination (Winter, G., et al. (1978) Nucleic Acids Res. 5:3129-3139).
      <br/>
      As expected, the resulting ribozyme (L-19 IVS-beta) has greatly reduced activity as a nucleotidyl-transferase, assayed using �32 P�-p(C)5 as a substrate.
      <br/>
      When GTP was added, however, the ribozyme was able to cleave p(C)5 as well as large RNA molecules.
      <br/>
      For example, the 504 nt pAK105 transcript (Mount, S. M., et al. (1983) Cell 33:509-518), a fragment of mouse beta-globin pre-mRNA containing the first intron, was cleaved to give major fragments of 148, 360 and 464 nt, as well as some minor fragments (FIG. 2a).
      <br/>
      As shown below, the 360 and 148 nt fragments can be explained as the 5' and 3' products of cleavage at position 360.
      <br/>
      The 464 nt fragment is the 3' product of cleavage at position 44, the 5' 44 nt fragment being to small to be observed.
      <br/>
      The absence of a major amount of a 316 nt RNA, the expected product of cleavage at both position 44 and 360, is indicative of partial digestion with few molecules cleaved more than once.
    </p>
    <p num="91">
      Cleavage required magnesium ion (optimum at 10-20 mM MgCl2) and was essentially independent of monovalent cation in the range 0-200 mM NaCl.
      <br/>
      The pH optimum was in the range of 7.5-8.0, and the temperature optimum was approximately 50 (degree)  C. Although the beta-eliminated L-19 IVS RNA was competent to catalyze the cleavage reaction, removal of G414 from the ribozyme was not required for cleavage activity.
      <br/>
      The enzyme worked at the same rate whether or not G414 had been removed.
      <br/>
      We explain the activity of the intact L-19 IVS RNA by the postulate that, at saturating concentrations of GTP, the attack by GTP on the substrate competes very effectively with attack by G414.
    </p>
    <p num="92">
      We note the IVS RNA and L-19 IVS RNA are protein-free.
      <br/>
      The L-19 IVS RNA is therefore a protein-free RNA enzyme (or ribozyme). L-19 IVS RNA and the like also function as enzymes in the absence of proteins.
      <br/>
      This applies to exogenous as well as endogenous protein.
      <br/>
      This is evidenced by retention of activity when subjected to protease activity, boiling or sodium dodecyl sulfate.
      <br/>
      Any RNA polymerase protein from the transcription system used to produce IVS RNA is removed by phenol extraction.
      <br/>
      The ability to make the IVS RNA in a totally defined system in vitro and remove the RNA polymerase by phenol extraction is further evidence of the protein-free nature of the reaction.

    <p num="93">Labelled Cleavage Products</p>
    <p num="94">
      When �alpha-32 P�GTP was included in the reaction of pAK105 RNA as in Example I above, the 148 and 464 nt cleavage products were labeled (FIG. 2b).
      <br/>
      Direct sequencing of these labeled RNA fragments (e.g., FIG. 2c) showed that cleavage and GTP-addition occur at nucleotides 44 and 360 in the sequence, such that the downstream cleavage products are 5'-GTP labeled.
      <br/>
      The bonds formed by GTP addition are sensitive to RNase T1, confirming that the GTP was covalently added through its 3'-O by a normal 3'-5' phosphodiester bond.
      <br/>
      Reaction of the 841 nt pT 7-1 (Xmn 1) RNA (essentially pBR322 sequences) produced 4 major labeled fragments.
      <br/>
      These were sequenced in the same manner. pT7-1RNA with an additional 122 nt at its 3 ' end, produced by transcription of pT7-1 DNA that had been cleaved at the Sca I site, showed the expected increase in molecular weight of the labeled products.
      <br/>
      In all of the reactions, including those in which substrate RNA was omitted, the L-19 IVS RNA became labeled, perhaps by the guanosine-exchange reaction proposed elsewhere (Zaug, A. J., et al. (1985) Science 229:1060-1064; Price, J. V., et al. (1987) J. Mol. Biol. in press).
      <br/>
      The sites of self-labeling were heterogeneous.

    <heading>EXAMPLE III</heading>
    <p num="95">Specificity Assessment</p>
    <p num="96">
      The sequence near the 5' end of each end-labeled product (See Example II above) was compared to the known sequence of the RNA to identify the nucleotides preceding the site of cleavage.
      <br/>
      The results are summarized in Table 1.
      <br/>
      Both the major and the minor cleavage sites are preceded by four pyrimidines, the consensus sequence being CUCU.
      <br/>
      This is exactly the tetranucleotide sequence expected to be an optimal target for the ribozyme.
      <br/>
      The importance of nucleotides at positions -5 and -6 relative to the cleavage the phage T7 promoter was isolated by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and electroelution.
      <br/>
      The promoter-containing fragment was ligated into the linearized pUC18 and the plasmid transformed into E. coli strain JM83.
      <br/>
      Individual colonies were picked and miniprep DNA was screened by restriction endonuclease digestion to locate the promoter fragment to the correct HaeII site (position 680 on the map in the New England Biolabs Catalog).
      <br/>
      The orientation of the T7 promoter was determined by transcribing EcoRI-cut miniprep DNA with T7 RNA polymerase and determining the size of the product.
      <br/>
      This plasmid (pUT718) was then cut in the multicloning site with KpnI and SphI and treated with T4 DNA polymerase followed by calf intestinal phosphatase.
      <br/>
      An IVS-containing BamHI DNA fragment was isolated from pJE457 (Price, J. V. and Cech, T. R., (1985) Science 228:719-722) and treated with S1 nuclease, phenol extracted, chloroform extracted, and ethanol precipitated.
      <br/>
      The S1-treated fragment, containing short deletions at both ends, was ligated into the KpnI/SphI-cut pUT718. E. coli strain JM83 was transformed with the recombinant plasmid and plated on LB agar containing ampicillin and X-gal (5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-beta-D-galactoside).
      <br/>
      DNA isolated from blue colonies was assayed by agarose gels electrophoresis for IVS-size inserts.
      <br/>
      Exon sequences were determined by dideoxy-sequencing the miniprep DNA.
      <br/>
      Ideally, site is not yet clear, although the absence of G residues may be significant.
      <br/>
      There is no apparent sequence preference downstream from the cleavage site, with all four nucleotides represented at position +1.
    </p>
    <p num="97">
      In assessing specificity, it is also necessary to consider which potential sites in the RNA were not cleaved by the ribozyme.
      <br/>
      For the pAK105 RNA, there was only one CUCU site at which cleavage was not observed. (Cleavage at this site would have produced a labeled 378 nt RNA.) On the other hand, a great many sites that match CUCU in 3 out of 4 positions were not cleaved.
      <br/>
      These include 17 CUMU sequences (where M not equal to C) and 7 CNCU sequences (where N not equal to U).
      <br/>
      In pT 7-1 RNA, cleavage was observed at both the CUCU sequences in the RNA, but at only one of the 15 UUUU sequences present.
      <br/>
      Thus, the ribozyme has a strong preference for cleavage after the tetranucleotide CUCU.

    <heading>EXAMPLE IV</heading>
    <p num="98">Cleavage Within Regions of Base-Paired RNA Secondary Structure</p>
    <p num="99">
      M1 RNA, the RNA subunit of E coli RNase P (Reed, R. E., et al. (1982) Cell 30:627-636) , was not cleaved by L-19 IVS RNA-beta under standard reaction conditions (FIG. 2b) . M1 RNA contains the sequence UCCUCU, which should be an excellent targent site.
      <br/>
      However, this sequence is involved in a stable hairpin stem (Guerrier-Takada, C., et al. (1984) Biochemistry 23:6327-6334; Pace, N. R., et al. (1985) Orig. of Life 16:97-116), which presumably makes it unavailable as a substrate.
      <br/>
      We have found that denaturation of M1 RNA with glyoxal allowed efficient cleavage of this site by L-19 IVS RNA, in support of the interpretation that RNA secondary structure can inhibit cleavage.
      <br/>
      The glyoxal procedure used for denaturation is according to Carmichael, G. G., et al. (1980) Meth. in Enzymol. 65:380-391.

    <heading>EXAMPLE V</heading>
    <p num="100">Active-Site Mutations Alter Substrate Specificity</p>
    <p num="101">
      The substrate specificity was next studied in a defined system where we could be certain that secondary structure in the substrate RNA was not affecting the cleavage reaction.
      <br/>
      Oligoribonucleotide substrates were synthesized by the phage T7 RNA polymerase transcription method developed by Uhlenbeck and co-workers (Lowary, P., et al. (1986) NATO ASI Series, vol. 110, 69-76) (FIG. 3a).
      <br/>
      One substrate contained a perfect match to the tetranucleotide consensus sequence.
      <br/>
      Two other substrates had single-base changes giving a 3-out-of-4 match to the consensus.
    </p>
    <p num="102">
      These substrates were tested with the wild-type L-19 IVS RNA and with two altered ribozymes (Been, M. D. and Cech, T. R., (1986) Cell 47,207-216).
      <br/>
      The two variants have single-base changes in the 5' exon-binding site that alter the sequence specificity of the first step in pre-rRNA self-splicing (Been, M. D., et al. Supra).
      <br/>
      The 23C variant (G converted to C at position 23 of the L-19 IVS RNA) is expected to recognize CUGU substrates, and the 24C (A converted to C at position 24) variant should recognize CGCU (FIG. 3b).
      <br/>
      In the course of these studies, we found that the inclusion of 2.5M urea or 15% formamide in the reactions greatly increased the specificity, allowing each ribozyme to differentiate substrates with a single base change in the recognition sequence.
      <br/>
      Our operating model is that these denaturants destabilized the base-pairing between the substrate and the active site nucleotides of the ribozyme, thereby discriminating against mismatched complexes.
      <br/>
      The results of treatment of the 3 substrates with each of the 3 ribozymes in the presence of 2.5 M urea are shown in FIG. 3c. Each substrate is cleaved exclusively by the ribozyme that is capable of making a perfectly base-paired enzyme-substrate complex (FIG. 3b).
      <br/>
      Thus it is contemplated the active site can be manipulated to recognize any base sequence so far that is XYZU, where X, Y and Z can be any of the four bases A,U,C,G and the nucleotides in the four base sequence can be the same or different.
    </p>
    <p num="103">
      When variant ribozymes were incubated with the 504 nt pAK105 RNA, each ribozyme gave a different pattern of cleavage products.
      <br/>
      One major cleavage site has been mapped for three variant ribozymes, including a 25C variant (G converted to C at position 25).
      <br/>
      The sites cleaved by the 23C, 24C and 25C ribozymes are preceded by CCCUGU, UCUGCU, and CUGUCU, respectively; the underlining indicates the base that would form a G.C. base pair with the mutated nucleotide in the variant ribozyme.
      <br/>
      Each of these sequences can form 6 continuous base-pairs with the active site nucleotides of the variant ribozyme.
      <br/>
      While more cleavage sites must be sequenced before specificity can be properly assessed, these initial results are promising.

      The time course of cleavage of the oligonucleotide substrate GGCCCUCU*AAAAA (where the asterisk designates the cleavage site) by the wild-type ribozyme is shown in FIG. 4a. The reaction of 2.5 uM substrate with 0.2 uM ribozyme is 66% complete in 90 minutes.
      <br/>
      Thus, it is readily apparent that the ribozyme is acting catalytically.

      The kinetics are adequately described by the Michaelis-Menten rate law.

      The dependence of the rate on GTP concentration is shown in the form of a Lineweaver-Burk plot in FIG. 4b. The Km for GTP is 44 uM.
      <br/>
      The dependence of the rate on RNA substance concentration at saturating GTP concentration is shown in FIG. 4C. The Km for this oligoribonucleotide substrate is 0.8 uM, and kcat is 0.13 min-1. Thus under Vmax conditions the enzyme turns over about 8 times per hour.

    <p num="108">
      Unlabeled L-19 IVS RNA was incubated with 5'-32 P-labeled pC5 in a solution containing 20 mM MgCl2, 50 mM tris-HCl, pH 7.5. The pC5 was progressively converted to oligocytidylic acid with both longer and shorter chain length than the starting material (FIG. 5A).
      <br/>
      The longer products extended to at least pC30, as judged by a longer exposure of an autoradiogram such as that shown in FIG. 5A. THe shorter products were exclusively pC4 and pC3.
      <br/>
      Incubation of pC5 in the absence of the L-19 IVS RNA gave no reaction (FIG. 5C).

    <p num="109">
      Phosphatase treatment of a 60-minute reaction mixture resulted in the complete conversion of the 32 P radioactivity to inorganic phosphate, as judged by polyethyleneimine thin-layer chromatography (TLC) in 1M sodium formate, pH 3.5 (Zaug, A., et al. unpublished data).
      <br/>
      Thus, the 5'-terminal phosphate of the substrate does not become internalized during the reaction, and the substrate is being extended on its 3' end to form the larger oligonucleotides.
      <br/>
      When C5 C was used as the substrate and the products were treated with ribonuclease T2 or ribonuclease A, the 32 P radioactivity was totally converted to C (Zaug, A., et al. unpublished data).
      <br/>
      Thus, the linkages being formed in the reaction were exclusively 3',5'-phosphodiester bonds.
      <br/>
      The products of the C5 C reaction were totally resistant to phosphatase treatment.

      No reaction occurred when magnesium chloride was omitted.
      <br/>
      The enzyme activity was approximately constant in the range 5 to 40 mM MgCl2 (Zaug, A., et al. unpublished data).
      <br/>
      The 20 mM concentration was routinely used to circumvent the potential effect of chelation of Mg2+ by high concentrations of oligonucleotide substrates.

    <p num="112">
      The L-19 IVS RNA is regenerated after each reaction, such that each enzyme molecule can react with many substrate molecules.
      <br/>
      For example, quantitation of the data shown in FIG. 5G revealed that 16 pmol of enzyme converted 1080 pmol of pC5 to products in 60 minutes.
      <br/>
      Such numbers underestimate the turnover number of the enzyme; because the initial products are predominantly C6 and C4, it is likely that the production of chains of length greater than six or less than four involves two or more catalytic cycles.
      <br/>
      Quantitation of the amount of radioactivity in each product also provides some indication of the reaction mechanism.
      <br/>
      At early reaction times, the amount of radioactivity (a measure of numbers of chains) in products larger than pC5 is approximately equal to that found in pC4 plus pC3, consistent with a mechanism in which the total number of phosphodiester bonds is conserved in each reaction.
      <br/>
      As the reaction proceeds, however, the radioactivity distribution shifts toward the smaller products.
      <br/>
      This is most likely due to a competing hydrolysis reaction also catalyzed by the L-19 IVS RNA, as described below.
    </p>
    <p num="113">
      The rate of conversion of 30 uM pC5 to products increases linearly with L-19 IVS RNA enzyme concentration in the range 0.06 to 1.00 uM (Zaug, A., et al. unpublished data).
      <br/>
      At a fixed enzyme concentration (FIG. 5, E to G) there is a hyperbolic relation between the reaction rate and the concentration of pC5.
      <br/>
      The data are fit by the Michaelis-Menten rate law in FIG. 6.

      The resulting kinetic parameters are Km =42 uM and kcat =1.7 min-1.

      Convalent intermediate.

      When C5 was used as a substrate, radioactivity became covalently attached to the L-19 IVS RNA (FIG. 7A) (The radioactive phosphate was bonded covalently to the L-19 IVS RNA as judged by the following criteria: it remained associated when the complex was isolated and subjected to a second round of denaturing gel electrophoresis; it was released in the form of a mononucleotide upon RNase T2 treatment; and it was released in the form of a series of unidentified oligonucleotides upon RNase T1 treatment (A.
      <br/>
      Zaug and T. Cech, unpublished data).
      <br/>
      These results are consistent with a series of covalent enzyme-substrate complexes in which various portions of C5 C are linked to the L-19 IVS RNA via a normal 3'-5'-phosphodiester bond.
      <br/>
      This observation, combined with our previous knowledge of the mechanism of IVS RNA cyclization (Zaug, A. J., et al., (1984) Science 224:574; Sullivan and Cech, T. R., (1985) Cell 42:639; Zaug, A. J., et al. (1983) Nature (London) 301:578), Been, M. and Cech, T. R.

      The cleavage reaction occurred with high efficiency, as judged by the production of C4 and C3, but there was very little synthesis of products larger than the starting material (FIG. 7B; compare to FIG. 5A).
      <br/>
      These data are easily interpreted in terms of the proposed reaction pathway.
      <br/>
      The first step, formation of the covalent intermediate with release of the 5'-terminal fragment of the oligonucleotide, is occurring normally.
      <br/>
      The first step consumes all the substrate, leaving insufficient C5 to drive the second transesterification reaction.

      The model shown in FIG. 8 was tested by isolating the covalent enzyme-substrate complex prepared by reaction with C5 C and incubating it with unlabeled C5.

      A portion of the radioactivity was converted to oligonucleotides with the electrophoretic mobility of C6, C7, C8, and higher oligomers (FIG. 7C).

      In a confirmatory experiment, the covalent complex was prepared with unlabeled C5 and reacted with C5.

      Radioactivity was again converted to a series of higher molecular weight oligonucleotides (Zaug, A., et al. unpublished data).

      In both types of experiments the data are readily explained if the covalent complex is a mixture of L-19 IVS RNA's terminating in . . . GpC, . . . GpCpC, . . . GpCpCpC, and so on.

      Because they can react with C5 to complete the catalytic cycle, these covalent enzvme-substrate complexes are presumptive intermediates in the reaction (FIG. 8).
      <br/>
      A more detailed analysis of the rate of their formation and resolution is needed to evaluate whether or not they are kinetically competent to be intermediates.
      <br/>
      We can make no firm conclusion about that portion of the enzyme-substrate complex that did not react with C5.
      <br/>
      This unreactive RNA could be a covalent intermediate that was denatured during isolation such that it lost reactivity, or it could represent a small amount of a different enzyme-substrate complex that was nonproductive and therefore accumulated during the reaction.

      The G414 -A16 linkage in the C IVS RNA, the G414 -U20 linkage in the C' IVS RNA, and the G414 -U415 linkage in the pre-rRNA are unusual phosphodiester bonds in that they are extremely labile to alkaline hydrolysis, leaving 5' phosphate and 3'-hydroxyl termini (Zaug, A. J. et al, (1984) Science 224:574 and Inoue, T., et al. (1986) J. Mol. Biol. 189,143-165).
      <br/>
      We therefore tested the lability of the G414 -C linkage in the covalent enzvme-substrate intermediate by incubation at pH 9.0 in a Mg2+ -containing buffer.
      <br/>
      This treatment resulted in the release of products that comigrated with pC and pCpC markers and larger products that were presumably higher oligomers of pC (FIG. 7D) Thin-layer chromatography was used to confirm the identity of the major products (Zaug, A., et al. unpublished data) In those molecules that released pC, the release was essentially complete in 5 minutes.
      <br/>
      Approximately half of the covalent complex was resistant to the pH 9.0 treatment.
      <br/>
      Once again, we can make no firm conclusion about the molecules that did not react.
      <br/>
      The lability of the G 414 -C bond forms the basis for the L-19 IVS RNA acting as a ribonuclease (FIG. 8) by a mechanism that is distinct from that of the endoribonuclease described in Examples I through VI.

      A competitive inhibitor.
      <br/>
      Deoxy C5, which is not a substrate for L-19 IVS RNA-catalyzed cleavage, inhibits the cleavage of pC5 (FIG. 9A).
      <br/>
      Analysis of the rate of the conversion of pC5 to pC4 and pC3 as a function of d-C5 concentration is summarized in FIG. 9B and C. The data indicate that d-C5 is a true competitive inhibitor with the inhibition constant Ki =260 uM.
      <br/>
      At 500 uM, d-A5 inhibits the reaction only 16 percent as much as d-C5.
      <br/>
      Thus, inhibition by d-C5 is not some general effect of introducing a deoxyoligonucleotide into the system but depends on sequence.

      The observation the the Ki for d-C5 is within an order of magnitude of the Km for C5 can then be interpreted in terms of d-C5 and C5 having similar binding constants for interaction with the active site on the enzyme.
      <br/>
      This fits well with the idea that the substrate binds to an oligopurine (R5) sequence in the active site primarily by Watson-Crick base-pairing, in which case the C5 * R5 duplex and the d-C5 * R5 duplex should have similar stability.

      Enzyme mechanism and its relation to self-splicing.
      <br/>
      The stoichiometry of the reaction products (equimolar production of oligonucleotides smaller than and larger than the starting material), the lack of an ATP or GTP (adenosine triphosphate; guanosine triphosphate) energy requirement, the involvement of a covalent intermediate, the specificity for oligoc substrates, and the competitive inhibition by d-C5 lead to a model for the enzyme mechanism (FIG. 8).
      <br/>
      The L-19 IVS RNA is proposed to bind the substrate noncovalently by hydrogen-bonded base-pairing interactions.
      <br/>
      A transesterification reaction between the 3'-terminal guanosine residue of the enzyme and a phosphate ester of the substrate then produces a covalent enzyme-substrate intermediate.
    </p>
    <p num="123">
      Transesterification is expected to be highly reversible.
      <br/>
      If the product C4 rebinds to the enzyme, it can attack the covalent intermediate and reform the starting material, C5.
      <br/>
      Early in the reaction, however, the concentration of C5 is much greater than the concentration of C4 ; if C5 binds and attacks the covalent intermediate, C6 is produced (FIG. 8).
      <br/>
      The net reaction is 2 C5 converted to C6 +C4.
      <br/>
      The products are substrates for further reaction, for example, C6 +C5 is converted to C7 +C4 and C4 +C5 is converted to C3 +C6.
      <br/>
      The absence of products smaller than C3 is explicable in terms of the loss of binding interactions of C3 relative to C4 (C3 could form only two base pairs in the binding mode that would be productive for cleavage).
    </p>
    <p num="124">
      The transesterification reactions are conservative with respect to the number of phosphodiester bonds in the system.
      <br/>
      Thus, RNA ligation can occur without an external energy source as is required by RNA or DNA ligase.
      <br/>
      Hydrolysis of the covalent intermediate competes with transesterification.
      <br/>
      The net reaction is C5 +H2 O converted to C4 +pC, with the L-19 IVS RNA acting as a ribonuclease.
    </p>
    <p num="125">
      On the basis of our current understanding of the reaction, the catalytic strategies of the L-19 IVS RNA enzyme appear to be the same as those used by protein enzymes (Jencks, W. P., (1969) Catalysis in Chemistry and Enzymology (McGraw-Hill, New York).
      <br/>
      First, the RNA enzyme, like protein enzymes, forms a specific noncovalent complex with its oligonucleotide substrate.
      <br/>
      This interaction is proposed to hold the oligonucleotide substrate at a distance and in an orientation such as to facilitate attack by the 3'-hydroxyl of the terminal guanosine of the enzyme.
      <br/>
      Second, a covalent enzyme-substrate complex is a presumptive intermediate in the L-19 IVS RNA reaction.
      <br/>
      Covalent intermediates are prevalent in enzyme-catalyzed group transfer reactions.
      <br/>
      Third, the phosphodiester bond formed in the covalent intermediate is unusually susceptible to hydrolysis, suggesting that it may be strained or activated to facilitate formation of the pentavalent transition state upon nucleophilic attack (Zaug, A. J., et al. (1985) Biochemistry 24:6211; Zaug, A. J., et al. (1984) Science 224:574).
      <br/>
      Similarly, protein catalysts are thought to facilitate the formation of the transition state, for example, by providing active site groups that bind the transition state better than the unreacted substrate (Fersht, A., (1985) Enzyme Structure and Mechanism (Freeman, New York, ed. 2); Wells, T. N. C. , et al. (1985) Nature (London) 316:656).
      <br/>
      Thus far there is no evidence that another major category of enzyme catalysis, general acid-base catalysis, occurs in the L-19 IVS RNA reactions, but we think it likely that it will be involved in facilitating the required proton transfers.
    </p>
    <p num="126">
      Each L-19 IVS RNA-catalyzed transesterification and hydrolysis reaction is analogous to one of the steps in Tetrahymena pre-rRNA self-splicing or one of the related self-reactions (FIGS. 10A-10F).
      <br/>
      Thus, the finding of enzymatic activity in a portion of the IVS RNA validates the view that the pre-rRNA carries its own splicing enzyme as an intrinsic part of its polynucleotide chain.
      <br/>
      It seems likely that the C5 substrate binding site of the L-19 IVS RNA is the oligopyrimidine binding site that directs the choice of the 5' splice site and the various IVS RNA cyclization sites (Sullivan, F. X., et al. (1985) Cell Supra; Been, M., et al. (1985) Nucleic Acid Research Supra; Inoue, T., et al. J. Mol. Biol., Supra; Inoue, T., et al. (1985) Cell 43:431.
      <br/>
      Although the Location of this site within the IVS RNA has not been proved, the best candidate is a portion of the "internal guide sequence" proposed by Davies and co-workers (Davies, R. W., et al. (1982) Nature (London) 300:719; Waring, R. B., et al. (1983) J. Mol. Biol. 167:595).
      <br/>
      Michel and Dujon (Michiel, F., et al. (1983) EMBO J. 2:33) show a similar pairing interaction in their RNA structure model.
      <br/>
      The putative binding site, GGAGGG, is located at nucleotides 22 to 27 of the intact Tetrahymena IVS RNA and at positions 3 to 8 very near the 5' end of the L-19 IVS RNA.
      <br/>
      If this is the substrate binding site, site-specific mutation of the sequence should change the substrate specificity of the enzyme in a predictable manner.

    <heading>EXAMPLE IX</heading>

      The L-19 IVS RNA Dephosphorylates C6 p. When oligo(cytidylic acid) with a 3'-terminal hydroxyl group is incubated with the L-19 IVS RNA enzyme in 20 mM MgCl2, it is converted to oligo(C) with both larger and smaller chain lengths (FIG. 1A) as described previously (Examples VII and VIII and Zaug &amp; Cech, (1986) Science (Wash., D.C.) 231:470-475.
      <br/>
      The reaction is specific for oligo(C); for example, pA6 --OH is unreactive under the same conditions (FIG. 11A)
    </p>
    <p num="128">
      When oligo(cytidylic acid) with a 3'-terminal phosphate is incubated with excess L-19 IVS RNA in 20 mM MgCl2, the substrate is converted to a product with reduced electrophoretic mobility (FIG. 11A) . This abrupt reduction in electrophoretic mobility, equivalent to an increase of approximately three nucleotides on a sequencing ladder, is exactly that obtained by treating the substrate with alkaline phosphatase (not shown in FIG. 11A; an example is shown in FIG. 12A).
      <br/>
      Thus, it appeared that the product was C6 --OH.
      <br/>
      When the substrate is internally labeled (C5 p*Cp), the labeled phosphate is retained in the product (FIG. 11A) . On the other hand, when the substrate is terminally labeled (C5 p*), the oligonucleotide product is unlabeled and the L-19 IVS RNA becomes labeled (FIG. 11B).
      <br/>
      These findings confirmed that the reaction involves removal of the 3'-terminal phosphate of the substrate.

    <p num="129">
      Dephosphorylation is specific for the 3'-phosphate of oligo(cytidylic acid).

      The 5'-phosphate of pC5 is not reactive (FIG. 11A) and neither phosphate is removed from pCp (data not shown). (We estimate that 0.1% reaction would have been detected).

      Neither A6 Cp (FIG. 11A) nor pA6 p (not shown) is a substrate. (We estimate that 0.1% reaction would have been detected).
      <br/>
      On the basis of this sample, it appears that there is both a minimum length requirement and a sequence requirements for a substrate and that the requirement are similar to those of the nucleotidyl transfer activity of the L-19 IVS RNA (Zaug &amp; Cech, (1986) Science Supra).

      Formation and Stability of E-p.
      <br/>
      We next investigated the fate of the phosphate that is removed from C5 p in the presence of L-19 IVS RNA.
      <br/>
      At neutral pH no inorganic phosphate is formed during the reaction, as judged by thin-layer chromatography of the reaction products (data not shown).
      <br/>
      When the reaction is conducted in the presence of C5 p*, it becomes clear that the phosphate is transferred to the L-19 RNA (FIG. 11B).
      <br/>
      Treatment of the phosphorylated L-19 IVS RNA (hereafter called E-p) with alkaline phosphatase leads to quantitative release of the radioactivity in the form of inorganic phosphate.
      <br/>
      Thus, the dephosphorylation of the substrate is accomplished by transphosphorylation.
      <br/>
      The structure of E-p has been determined; the phosphate is esterified through the 3'-O of the 3'-terminal guanosine residue (G414) of the RNA (Zauc and Cech, unpublished results).
    </p>
    <p num="131">
      The rate of conversion of G5 p to C5 --OH+E-p is pH-dependent with an optimum around pH 5 0 (slashed zero)  A sample of the data is shown in FIGS. 12A-12C. The phospho transfer reaction is essentially pH-independent in the range pH 7.5-9 and proceeds at a rate similar to that of the nucleotidyl transfer reaction (FIG. 12A) . At pH 5 the phospho transfer reaction is accelerated more than 20-fold, while the nucleotidyl transfer reaction is unaffected.
      <br/>
      At pH 4, the enzyme still has substantial phospho transfer activity while its nucleotidyl transfer activity is greatly diminished.
      <br/>
      Since the enzyme is probably starting to denature below pH 5 (Zaug, et al., (1985) Biochemistry 24:6211) the phospho transfer activity profile in this range presumably reflects the inactivation of the enzyme rather than the pH optimum for the transfer step.
      <br/>
      Data such as those shown in FIG. 12B were quantified, and the resulting rate constants are summarized in FIG. 12C.

      The covalent intermediate formed during the reaction of pC5 --OH with the L-19 IVS RNA (E-pC) is alkali-labile; at pH 9.0 it undergoes hydrolysis, releasing the nucleotide pC and regenerating the free enzyme (Zaug &amp; Cech, (1986) Science Supra).
      <br/>
      We therefore investigated the stability of the phosphate monoester in the phosphenzyme E-p.
      <br/>
      There is no detectable hydrolysis of the phosphate monoester at pH 9.0, conditions in which E-pC treated in parallel gave release of pC, or at any other pH in the range 7.0-9 0 (slashed zero)
    </p>
    <p num="133">
      At acidic pH, on the other hand, the terminal phosphate monoester of E-p underwent slow hydrolysis.
      <br/>
      When E-p was incubated at pH 5.0, the phosphate was released as Pi at a rate of approximately 10%/h.
      <br/>
      The rate was slower at pH 4.0 and at pH 6.0 than at pH 5 0 (slashed zero)  Release of Pi was also observed during the reaction of C5 p* with L-19 IVS RNA at pH 5.0 at reaction times of 2 and 4 h. Thus, the L-19 IVS RNA has acid phosphatase activity.

      This hydrolytic reaction is so slow, however, that we have not attempted to demonstrate multiple turnover.

      Phosphorylation of the Enzyme is Reversible.

      When unlabeled E-p is incubated with a trace amount of C5 p*, very little reaction takes place (FIG. 13A).

      In contrast, when the same E-p is incubated with a trace amount of labeled pC5 --OH, labeled pC5 p is progressively formed (FIG. 13B).

      The products normally formed by incubation of pC5 --OH with excess L-19 IVS RNA, pC4 --OH and pC3 --OH (Zaug &amp; Cech, 1986) are not observed.

      To prove that the L-19 IVS RNA could act catalytically, it was necessary to show that each enzyme molecule could mediate the dephosphorylation of multiple substrate molecules.
      <br/>
      This was accomplished by the incubation of L-19 IVS RNA with a molar excess of C5 p* and an even greater molar excess of unlabeled UCU, to act as a phosphate acceptor.
      <br/>
      As shown in FIG. 14A, L-19 IVS RNA was capable of transferring the 3'-terminal phosphate from C5 p to UCU.

      Treatment of the product with RNase T2 and thin-layer chromatography confirmed that the phosphate had been transferred from a C to a U residue.
      <br/>
      The time course in FIG. 14B was done under conditions of lower enzyme concentration (0.16 uM) and higher acceptor concentration (200 uM) than those used in the experiment of FIG. 14A.
