      Low resistivity contacts are formed on source/drain regions and gate electrodes at a suitable thickness to reduce parasitic series resistances, thereby significantly reducing consumption of underlying silicon, while significantly reducing junction leakage.
      <br/>
      Embodiments include selectively depositing a metal layer, such as nickel, on the source/drain regions and on the gate electrode and ion implanting to form a barrier layer within the nickel layers which does not react with silicon or nickel silicide during subsequent solicitation.
      <br/>
      The barrier layer confines salicidation to the relatively thin underlayer layer of nickel, thereby minimizing consumption of underlying silicon while the unsilicidized overlying nickel on the barrier layer ensures low sheet resistivity.

    <heading>TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
    <p num="2">
      The present invention relates to semiconductor manufacturing, particularly to self-aligned silicide (silicide) technology.
      <br/>
      The present invention is particularly applicable to manufacturing ultra large scale integrated circuit (U.S.S.) Systems having features in tile deep-sub micron range.
    </p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND ART</heading>
    <p num="3">
      Deep-submicron scaling required for ULSI Systems dominates design considerations in the micro electronics industry.
      <br/>
      As the gate electrode length is scaled down, the source and drain junctions must be scaled down accordingly, to suppress the so-called short channel effects (SCE) which degrade performance of miniaturized devices.
      <br/>
      A major problem related to complementary metal oxide silicon (CMOS) scaling is the undesirable increase in parasitic resistance.
      <br/>
      As the source/drain junction depth (Xj) and polycrystalline silicon line width are scaled into the deep-submicron range, parasitic series resistances of the source/drain diffusion layers and polysilicon gate electrodes increase.
      <br/>
      A conventional approach to the increase in parasitic series resistances of the source/drain diffusion layers and the polysilicon gate electrodes involves salicide technology which comprises forming a layer of titanium silicide (TiSi2) on the source/drain regions and gate electrode.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      Conventional salicide technology employing TiSi2 for reducing parasitic series resistance has proven problematic, particularly as design rules plunge into the deep-submicron range, e.g., about 0.18 microns and under.
      <br/>
      For example, in forming a thin TiSi2 layer, silicide agglomeration occurs during silicide annealing to effect a phase change from the high resistivity C49 form to the low resistivity C54 form.
      <br/>
      Such agglomeration further increases the sheet resistance of the silicide film.
      <br/>
      Moreover, the formation of a thick silicide layer causes a high junction leakage current and low reliability, particularly when forming ultra shallow junctions, e.g., at an Xj of less than about 800  Angstrom .
      <br/>
      The formation of a thick silicide layer consumes silicon from the underlying semiconductor substrate such that the thick silicide layer approaches and even shorts the ultra-shallow junction, thereby generating a high junction leakage current.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      Another problem attendant upon conventional TiSi2 technology is the well-known increase in sheet resistance as the line width narrows.
      <br/>
      The parasitic series resistances of source/drain regions and gate electrodes are a major cause of device performance degradation and are emerging as one of the severest impediments to device scaling.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      There are additional problems attendant upon conventional silicide technology employing titanium or other metals, such as cobalt, which problems are exacerbated as design rules extend into the deep-submicron range, e.g. about 0.18 microns and under.
      <br/>
      For example, conventional salicide technology for deep-submicron CMOS transistors comprises depositing a layer of metal at a predetermined thickness by physical vapor deposition (PVD), such as sputtering, over the entire wafer surface and then conducting a two step rapid thermal annealing with an intervening etching step to remove unreacted metal from the dielectric sidewall spacers on the gate electrode as well as the field isolation region.
      <br/>
      The need to remove unreacted metal from the dielectric sidewall spacers and field isolation region complicates processing and reduces manufacturing throughput as well as device reliability.
      <br/>
      In addition, as devices are scaled smaller and smaller, shorting between source/drain regions and the gate electrode becomes significant due to high temperature processing required to form low resistivity silicide layers.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      There exist a need for simplified salicide technology which enables a reduction in parasitic series resistances.
      <br/>
      There exist a particular need for simplified salicide methodology in manufacturing semiconductor devices having a design rule in the deep-submicron range, e.g. a design rule less than about 0.18 microns, with increased reliability and reduced shorting between source/drain regions and the gate electrode.

    <heading>DESCRIPTION THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="17">
      The present invention addresses and solves problems attendant upon conventional salicide technology for parasitic series resistances.
      <br/>
      Conventional salicide methodology comprises forming a layer of TiSi2 on the source/drain diffusion layers and on the silicon gate electrode, to prevent an increase in parasitic series resistance due to scaling down of the source/drain junction depth and silicon line width.
      <br/>
      However, the formation of a sufficiently thick TiSi2 layer on the source/drain regions and on the gate electrode to reduce parasitic series resistances generates a leakage current, in that the TiSi2 layer on the source/drain regions approaches and frequently overlaps the shallow junction causing an increase in junction leakage current.
      <br/>
      If a thin TiSi2 layer is employed, a high sheet resistance would result.
      <br/>
      Moreover, TiSi2 undergoes agglomeration upon annealing from the high resistivity C49 phase to the low resistivity C54 phase, thereby further increasing sheet resistance.
      <br/>
      TiSi2 also increases in sheet resistance as the line width is narrowed.
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      The present invention addresses and solves such problems by providing an elevated salicide technology for source/drain regions and gate electrodes for lowering parasitic series resistances.
      <br/>
      In accordance with various embodiments of the present invention, a low resistivity composite layer is formed on the source/drain regions and gate electrode, which low resistivity composite layer contains a lower metal silicide layer, a barrier layer on the metal silicide layer and a metal layer on the barrier layer.
      <br/>
      Advantageously, the metal silicide layer of the composite is formed with significantly reduced consumption of silicon from the underlying source/drain regions and gate electrode, thereby significantly improving the junction leakage and reliability of ultra-shallow junctions.
      <br/>
      The present invention enjoys utility in manufacturing any of various types of semiconductor devices, particularly advanced deep-submicron CMOS devices, such as 0.1 microns devices with ultra-shallow junctions, e.g., less than about 800  Angstrom .
      <br/>
      The present invention enables the formation of low resistivity contacts having a thickness sufficient to reduce parasitic series resistance. e.g,. above about 500  Angstrom  to about 2000  Angstrom , while significantly improving the reliability of ultra-shallow junctions.
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      In accordance with embodiments of the present invention, a metal layer is selectively deposited on the source/drain regions and the gate electrode.
      <br/>
      Thus, the metal layer is self-aligned with the source/drain regions and gate electrode.
      <br/>
      After depositing the metal layer, a barrier layer is formed within and across the metal layer dividing the metal layer into a lower metal portion and an upper metal portion separated by the barrier layer.
      <br/>
      Embodiments of the present invention include forming the barrier layer by ion implantation.
      <br/>
      For example, a nickel layer is selectively deposited by electroless plating on the source/drain regions and gate electrode.
      <br/>
      Ion implantation is then conducted to implant an atomic species which reacts with nickel, as upon subsequent annealing, to form the barrier layer which prevents silicidation of the upper nickel portion during subsequent silicidation.
      <br/>
      Embodiments include ion implanting nitrogen to form a barrier layer comprising nickel nitride, ion implanting boron to form a barrier layer comprising nickel boride and ion implanting carbon to form a barrier layer comprising nickel carbide.
      <br/>
      It should be understood that the resulting barrier layer should be a good conductor and does not react with silicon or nickel silicide during the subsequent silicidation heating and/or thermal cycling during backend processing.
    </p>
    <p num="20">
      A particular advantageous feature of embodiments of the present invention comprises forming a composite layer with a relatively thin lower metal portion, thereby minimizing consumption of silicon from the underlying substrate and gate electrode during silicidation, as silicidation is confined to the lower portion by the barrier layer.
      <br/>
      The thin silicide layer ensures low contact resistance, while the remainder of the unsilicidated metal on the barrier layer ensures low sheet resistance for both shallow source/drain junctions and narrow polysilicon gates.
    </p>
    <p num="21">
      Embodiments of the present invention comprise depositing a metal layer, e.g. nickel, at a thickness greater than about 500  Angstrom  to about 2000  Angstrom , e.g. substantially corresponding to that of the polycrystalline silicon gate electrode.
      <br/>
      Ion implantation is then conducted, as by implanting nitrogen into the nickel layer at a dosage of about 1 * 1015 atoms cm-2 to about 1 * 1017 atoms cm-2 and at an implantation energy of about 10 KeV to about 100 KeV.
      <br/>
      A rapid thermal annealing or thermal annealing is then conducted to form the barrier metal layer, as at a temperature of about 200 (degree)  C. to about 700 (degree)  C., thereby dividing the deposited nickel layer into a lower nickel silicide or nickel portion and upper nickel portion separated by the barrier layer.
      <br/>
      During such annealing, some or all of the lower nickel portion may react with the substrate to form nickel silicide.
      <br/>
      The lower nickel portion (or nickel silicide) is preferably considerably thinner than the upper nickel portion, thereby minimizing the degree of silicon consumption.
      <br/>
      For example: the lower nickel portion can have a thickness of about 5  Angstrom  to about 100  Angstrom ; the barrier layer can have a thickness of about 20  Angstrom  to about 300  Angstrom ; and the upper nickel portion can a thickness of about 500  Angstrom  to about 1500  Angstrom .
      <br/>
      Further heating may be conducted to form a nickel monosilicide layer by reacting the lower nickel portion with the underlying silicon to form nickel silicide at a temperature of about 375 (degree)  C. to about 750 (degree)  C. Embodiments of the present invention comprise heating to simultaneously complete formation of the barrier layer and effect silicidation.
      <br/>
      In another embodiment, silicidation is effected by thermal cycling during backend processing.
      <br/>
      The resulting composite low resistivity contact typically has a thickness of about 10  Angstrom  to about 200  Angstrom .
      <br/>
      The present invention, therefore, enables the formation of self-aligned contacts at a suitable thickness to minimize parasitic series resistance while maintaining the integrity of the ultra-shallow source/drain regions and narrow polycrystalline silicon gates for increased miniaturization.
    </p>
    <p num="22">
      In accordance with the present invention, the substrate typically comprises crystalline silicon, e.g., monocrystalline silicon.
      <br/>
      The substrate can either be a p-type substrate or an n-type substrate, with the source/drain regions having a conductivity type opposite to that of the substrate.
    </p>
    <p num="23">
      Sequential phases of a method in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention are schematically illustrated in FIGS. 1-4, wherein similar reference numerals denote similar features.
      <br/>
      Adverting to FIG. 1, a conventional transistor structure, formed in a conventional manner, comprises substrate 10 doped with an n-type impurity, and source/drain regions comprising a shallow extension region 11A and a heavily doped (HD) region 11B doped with a p-type impurity.
      <br/>
      The source/drain regions are formed in a conventional manner as, for example, by forming gate electrode layer 13 on semiconductor substrate 10 with gate dielectric layer 12, e.g., a gate oxide such as silicon dioxide, therebetween.
      <br/>
      Using the gate electrode as a mask, shallow extension regions 11A are formed.
      <br/>
      Dielectric sidewall spacers 14 are then formed on the side surfaces of gate electrode 13.
      <br/>
      Dielectric sidewall spacers can comprise any suitable dielectric material, such as silicon dioxide, silicon nitride or a composite of silicon dioxide and silicon nitride.
      <br/>
      Ion implantation is then conducted, using the gate electrode 13 and sidewall spacers 14 as a mask, to form HD regions 11B.
    </p>
    <p num="24">
      Adverting to FIG. 2, a metal layer 20, such as nickel, is selectively formed on the exposed portions of the source/drain regions, i.e., on the HD regions, and on the upper surface of gate electrode 13.
      <br/>
      The selective formation of nickel layers 12 can be effected in any conventional manner.
      <br/>
      Advantageous results have been obtained by selectively depositing nickel layers 20 on the exposed portions of the HD regions 11B and on the upper surface of gate electrode 13 by electroless plating.
      <br/>
      Such selective electroless plating can be implemented by initially removing any oxide film from the main surface of the semiconductor substrate, i.e., the upper surfaces of the HD regions 11B, and from the upper surface of gate electrode 13, as with a buffered oxide etch (BOE) at room temperature for about 30 seconds.
      <br/>
      The surfaces of the source/drain regions and gate electrode are then activated employing a solution of palladium chloride, hydrochloric acid (HCl) and BOE, e.g., 0.1 g platinum chloride/liter, 10 milliliters HCl/liter and 25 milliliters of BOE/liter.
      <br/>
      The activated surface is then rinsed for about three minutes employing about 10 milliliters of HCl/liter and 25 milliliters of boric oxide/liter.
      <br/>
      Electroless deposition is then conducted employing a conventional nickel bath.
      <br/>
      It is believed that the activation of the cleaned silicon surface with palladium chloride forms palladium nucleation sites which ultimately remain in and improve the integrity of the metal silicide layer.
    </p>
    <p num="25">Another suitable catalytic activation solution comprises about 0.25 g of palladium chloride, about (10 ml of HCl/liter, about 25 ml of 10:1 BOE and about 50 mg/liter Rhodafac RE610, an anionic surfactant available from Rhone-Poulen, located in Cranberry, N.J. Another suitable rinse solution comprises about 10 ml, HCl/liter, about 25 ml of 10:1 BOE and about 50 mg/liter of Rhodafac RE610.</p>
    <p num="26">
      Adverting to FIG. 3, ion implantation is then conducted, e.g. nitrogen ion implantation to implant a layer of nitrogen atoms into each metal e.g. nickel layer (FIG. 2, 20) as indicated by Arrows 30.
      <br/>
      Upon annealing a barrier layer 31 is formed in each nickel layer dividing each nickel layer into a lower nickel portion 32 and an upper nickel portion 33 separated by barrier layer 31.
      <br/>
      Such annealing to complete formation of the barrier layer can be affected at a temperature of about 200 (degree)  C. to about 700 (degree)  C. Heating may be then conducted, as at a temperature of about 350 (degree)  C. to about 750 (degree)  C. to form nickel mono silicide (NiSi) by reaching the lower nickel portion 32 with silicon in the underlying substrate 10 and gate electrode 13 to form nickel silicide layers 40 as shown in FIG. 4.
      <br/>
      The presence of barrier layer 31 prevents silicidation of overlying metal layer 33, thereby minimizing silicon consumption in the substrate and gate electrode and, hence, improving integrity of shallow source/drain regions and gate electrode width.
    </p>
    <p num="27">
      Advantageously, the thickness of the lower metal layer (32, FIG. 3) can be tailored or optimized by controlling the implantation conditions to form a metal silicide layer (40, FIG. 4) having a low contact resistance for good ohmic contact with minimum silicon consumption.
      <br/>
      A particular advantage attendant upon selectively depositing nickel is that the nickel silicide silicidation temperature is low e.g. about 350 (degree)  C. to about 750 (degree)  C. Accordingly, the separate silicidation annealing can be omitted, thereby further simplifying the process, since typical backend thermal cycling will cause the silicidation reaction thereby forming the nickel silicide layer (40, FIG. 4).
      <br/>
      Thus, the nickel silicide improves ohmic contact rather than determining sheet resistance.
      <br/>
      Instead, sheet resistance is determined by the overlying nickel layer on the barrier layer.
      <br/>
      Subsequent processing is then conducted in a conventional manner.
    </p>
    <p num="28">
      The present invention can be readily integrated into current methodology with an attendant advantageous significant reduction in silicon consumption, thereby reducing the junction leakage current and improving the reliability of ultra-shallow source/drain regions.
      <br/>
      Another technological advantage of the present invention stemming from the significantly reduced silicon consumption is that relatively deep source/drain junctions are not necessary, thereby further simplifying process flow.
    </p>
    <p num="29">
      Advantageously, the present invention enables the formation of semiconductor devices having a design rule in the deep-submicron range employing elevated salicide technology to prevent an undesirable increase in parasitic series resistance while, at the same time, significantly minimizing junction leakage, even in semiconductor devices having an Xj less than about 800  Angstrom , even. 500  Angstrom  and below.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, the present invention achieves the technological advantage of enabling formation of reliable ultra-shallow source/drain junctions to meet the increasing demands for high density and miniaturization, as in manufacturing deep-submicron CMOS devices, such as sub 0.1 micron devices.
