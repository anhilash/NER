      Field of the Invention
    </p>
    <p num="2">
      The present invention relates to a sole of a baseball spiked shoe, and a method of measuring shearing stress distribution of a baseball spiked shoe.
      <br/>
      More particularly, the present invention relates to the sole of baseball spiked shoes that provides superior sliding resistance in any action in a baseball play such as batting, throwing, and running, and that improves flexibility of the foot action during the play.
      <br/>
      Also, the present invention relates to a method of measuring shearing stress distribution of a baseball spiked shoe.
    </p>
    <p num="3">2. Description of the Background Art</p>
    <p num="4">
      Conventional baseball spiked shoes, particularly those with metal spikes, have the so-called triangular shaped blades provided on the sole.
      <br/>
      More specifically, as shown in FIG. 17A, three blade-like protrusions at respective positions at the fore foot portion and the heel portion are joined by a connecting washer so as to be located at the vertices of a triangle, and fastened by a fixing pin and the like at respective holes formed in the connecting washer.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      A baseball spiked shoe as shown in FIG. 17B is also used.
      <br/>
      Such a baseball spiked shoe has the triangular shaped blades of the fore foot portion divided into a toe portion spike and a stepping portion spike in order to improve the flexibility of the fore foot portion of the shoe sole.
    </p>
    <p num="6">Also, a baseball spike shoe having auxiliary projections provided to the conventional triangular shaped blades as shown in FIG. 18 for the purpose of improving sliding resistance is disclosed in Japanese Patent Laying-Open No. 6-21408.</p>
    <p num="7">
      A baseball shoe with the above-described triangular shaped blades had almost no flexibility at the fore foot portion since a connecting washer of high rigidity is fixed over a large area at the fore foot portion from the toe portion to the stepping portion.
      <br/>
      When a person wearing such baseball spiked shoes shifts his or her weight frontward at the time of running to kick the ground, his or her foot will move within the shoe since the sole cannot accurately follow the flexing fore foot portion.
      <br/>
      The initial kicking force cannot be reliably conveyed against the ground.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      A similar problem is encountered when the player moves sideways.
      <br/>
      The shoe sole cannot accurately follow the eversion and inversion shape of the foot portion.
      <br/>
      The foot will move inside the shoe, so that the kicking force cannot be reliably conveyed against the ground.
      <br/>
      Such disadvantages could not be solved by the baseball spiked hardware disclosed in the aforementioned Japanese Patent Laying-Open No. 60-21408.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      The typical actions during a baseball play are the four actions of batting, throwing, fielding, and running.
      <br/>
      The strength of a player's leg could not be exercised sufficiently in respective actions with the conventional worn spiked shoes.
      <br/>
      For example, when a right-handed batter is at bat, the right foot functions as a pivoting foot to exhibit a great kicking force centering about the anterior portion of the first metatarsal head at the time of ball-impact.
      <br/>
      However, since there is no projection in a conventional spiked shoe at the anterior portion of the first metatarsal head and the projection provided in the proximity of the first metatarsal head is provided parallel to the direction of the kicking force, a great force cannot be generated.
      <br/>
      The shoe sole will slide on the ground to result in loss of the kicking force.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      When a right-handed player throws a ball, a great kicking force is imparted from the stepping portion to the heel portion of the right foot in the action starting from take back to the down swing of the player's arm.
      <br/>
      At the moment the ball leaves the player's hand, a great braking force is imparted from the heel portion to the stepping portion of the left foot.
      <br/>
      Since a conventional spiked shoe has only one projection provided at the toe portion, which is located at right angles with respect to the longitudinal line of the foot, the kicking force at the toe portion of the right foot could not be conveyed sufficiently against the ground.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, there is only one projection provided as perpendicular to the longitudinal line of the foot at the heel portion of the left foot shoe, so that a sufficient braking force could not be exercised.
    </p>
    <p num="11">
      As to the kinetic performance of a baseball player during fielding and running, the movement can be classified into the case where the player makes a dash straight forward, and the case where the player turns his body and makes a dash in that direction.
      <br/>
      When the player dashes straight forward, the load path on the sole of the spiked shoe shows a trajectory starting from contact of the heel on the ground to the toe portion via the lateral side of the plantar arc, the lateral side of the stepping portion, and the medial side of the stepping portion.
    </p>
    <p num="12">
      Although a conventional spiked shoe has a projection provided at the first metatarsal head, the direction of the projection is parallel to the direction of the transfer of weight.
      <br/>
      An adequate kicking force could not be exercised, resulting in loss of force.
      <br/>
      When the player makes a dash sideways in the right direction, the region of the left foot from the toe portion to the medial side of the stepping portion kicks against the ground while the toe of the right foot is pointed towards the forwarding direction to dart off.
      <br/>
      Since the projections provided at the first metatarsal head and at the toe of a conventional spiked shoe are substantially parallel to the direction of the kicking force, there was loss in force.
    </p>
    <p num="13">Although flexibility corresponding to various movements is required in spiked shoes, the sole of a conventional spiked shoe does not have a flexion groove provided at an effective position.</p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="14">In view of the foregoing, a main objective of the present invention is to provide a method of analyzing various movements of a spiked shoe in a baseball play for measuring the direction of shearing stress acting on a shoe sole and an area of force application.</p>
    <p num="15">Another objective of the present invention is to provide a sole of a baseball spiked shoe having the required position and direction of a projection determined according to the measured direction of shearing stress and area of force application.</p>
    <p num="16">According to an aspect of the present invention, a toe portion projection, a first metatarsal head projection, a stepping portion projection, and a fifth metatarsal head projection are provided at a fore foot portion on a sole of a baseball spiked shoe.</p>
    <p num="17">Since respective projections are provided at the fore foot portion in the present invention, kicking force and the like in a kinetic performance can reliably be conveyed to the ground to improve exercise efficiency.</p>
    <p num="18">According to another aspect of the present invention, a heel medial projection, a heel posterior projection, and a heel lateral projection are provided at a heel portion.</p>
    <p num="19">Also preferably, a heel anterior projection is provided at the heel portion.</p>
    <p num="20">According to a further aspect of the present invention, a sole of a baseball spiked shoe includes a toe portion projection, a first metatarsal head projection, a stepping portion projection, a fifth metatarsal head projection provided at a fore foot portion, and a heel medial projection, a heel anterior projection, a heel posterior projection, and a heel lateral projection provided at a heel portion.</p>
    <p num="21">
      Further preferably, a first metatarsal head posterior projection is provided at a relatively posterior portion of the first metatarsal head projection.
      <br/>
      The toe portion projection and the first metatarsal head projection are formed integrally by a connecting washer.
    </p>
    <p num="22">
      Also, the stepping portion projection and the fifth metatarsal head projection are joined integrally by a connecting washer.
      <br/>
      The stepping portion projection, the fifth metatarsal head projection, and the first metatarsal head posterior projection are formed integrally by a connecting washer.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, the heel medial projection, the heel anterior projection, the heel posterior projection, and the heel lateral projection are joined integrally by a connecting washer.
    </p>
    <p num="23">According to still another aspect of the present invention, a method of measuring shearing stress distribution of a baseball spiked shoe includes the step of measuring distribution of compressive stress in the vertical direction of a shoe sole as foot stress distribution data for every short period of time when a subject moves with a baseball spiked shoe, the step of simultaneously measuring stress in the three dimensional direction of the shoe sole for every short period of time, and the step of analyzing a resultant force vector of the measured compressive stress in the vertical direction and the stress in the horizontal direction as triaxial components to obtain foot stress distribution data and load vector data for determining a shearing stress distribution diagram.</p>
    <p num="24">The foregoing and other objects, features, aspects and advantages of the present invention will become more apparent from the following detailed description of the present invention when taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.</p>

    <heading>DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
    <p num="26">
      Referring to FIG. 1, a plate type sensor 11, a triaxial stress measurement device 12, a processor 13, and a memory 14 are provided for measurement to obtain a shearing stress distribution.
      <br/>
      A subject wearing a shoe of a relatively planar sole design moves on plate type sensor 11.
      <br/>
      Distribution of compressive stress in the vertical direction in the region of plate type sensor 11 in contact with the bottom of the shoe sole is measured for every short period of time as foot stress distribution data to be stored in memory 14 via processor 13.
    </p>
    <p num="27">
      Triaxial stress measurement device 12 is installed within another plate type sensor provided beneath plate type sensor 1.
      <br/>
      Measurement of stress in the three dimensional direction at a moment identical to that of the foot stress distribution measurement by plate type sensor 11 is provided by triaxial stress measurement device 12.
      <br/>
      A resultant force vector of the stress in the vertical direction and the horizontal direction is analyzed as triaxial components.
      <br/>
      Measurement is provided for every short period of time, and load vector data is stored in memory 14 via processor 13.
    </p>
    <p num="28">
      Foot stress distribution data and load vector data obtained as described above are applied to a load vector distribution determination unit 15, whereby load vector distribution is determined.
      <br/>
      The load vector distribution data is applied to a shearing stress distribution determination unit 16 to have a shearing stress distribution determined.
    </p>
    <p num="29">
      An example of a determined shearing stress distribution is shown in FIG. 2.
      <br/>
      This diagram represents the shearing stress distribution in the form of contour lines.
    </p>
    <p num="30">
      The shearing stress distribution diagram determined by shearing stress distribution determination unit 16 is applied to a CAD system 18 from an image input unit 17 such as a scanner.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, the shearing stress distribution diagram can be transferred to CAD system 18 directly as data via a floppy disc or via a computer network, and then drawn by a program in the CAD system.
    </p>
    <p num="31">
      In CAD system 18, various data such as foot length, foot width, position of first metatarsal head are added using a foot portion anatomy database.
      <br/>
      The position and direction of a projection are determined according to the shearing stress distribution diagram.
    </p>
    <p num="32">FIGS. 3-6 are plan views of a shoe sole according to an embodiment of the present invention.</p>
    <p num="33">At the bottom plane of a shoe sole body 1, nine projections, i.e. toe portion projections T1 and T2, a first metatarsal head projection T3, a stepping portion projection M1, a fifth metatarsal head projection M2, a heel medial projection H1, a heel anterior projection H2, a heel posterior projection H3, and a heel lateral projection H4 are provided.</p>
    <p num="34">
      In the present embodiment, appropriate projections are formed integrally by means of a first and second caller 2B and 2B connecting.
      <br/>
      More specifically, toe portion projections T1, T2, and first metatarsal head projection T3 are joined together by first connecting caller 2A.
      <br/>
      Stepping portion projection M1 and fifth metatarsal head projection M2 are joined together by first connecting caller 2A.
      <br/>
      Heel medial projection H1, heel anterior projection H2, heel posterior projection H3, and heel lateral projection H4 are joined together by third connecting washer 2C.
    </p>
    <p num="35">Each projection is provided corresponding to the skeletal layout of the foot portion as shown in FIG. 5.</p>
    <p num="36">More specifically, toe portion projection T1 is located corresponding to a position between an end of distal hallux a and an end of second distal phalanx b. Toe portion projection T2 is located corresponding to a position between end of second distal phalanx b and an end of third distal phalanx c.</p>
    <p num="37">First metatarsal projection T3 is located corresponding to a position relatively frontward of first metatarsal head d.</p>
    <p num="38">Stepping portion projection M1 is located at a position corresponding to a third proximal phalanx e. Fifth metatarsal head projection M2 is located corresponding to a position between a proximal portion of fourth proximal phalanx f and a proximal portion of fifth proximal phalanx g.</p>
    <p num="39">Furthermore, heel medial projection H1 is located at the medial side of a heel center h, corresponding to a position at the medial side of a calcaneus i. Heel anterior projection H2 is located frontward of heel center h, corresponding to a position substantially at the center of calcaneus i. Heel posterior projection H3 is located at the posterior of heel center h, corresponding to a position posterior to calcaneus i. Heel lateral projection H4 is located at the lateral side of heel center h, corresponding to a position at the lateral side of calcaneus i.</p>
    <p num="40">The angle  THETA  of each projection is defined as an angle between a line of extension of respective projections and a longitudinal line of the foot L as shown in FIG. 6.</p>
    <p num="41">
      Here, the longitudinal line of the foot L is a straight line connecting a leading tip end X and the backmost end Y of the heel of the sole.
      <br/>
      It is a reference line that is uniquely determined once the shape of the shoe sole is defined.
    </p>

      Although the function of each projection has been described according to the present invention, the shoe sole itself must be flexible at an appropriate region in order to achieve effective usage of these projections.
      <br/>
      For this purpose, other embodiments of a baseball spiked shoe according to the present invention are shown in FIGS. 3 and 4.
      <br/>
      A stepping portion flexion groove 5 can be provided at the shoe sole body along a line connecting the metatarsal head from the hallux to the fifth phalanx.
      <br/>
      Also, a fore foot portion flexion groove 4 can be provided at the shoe sole body starting from a region posterior to toe portion projection T2 to a region posterior to first metatarsal head portion T3 via a region anterior to stepping portion projection M1.
    </p>
    <p num="76">
      Stepping portion flexion groove 5 is particularly effective for a running movement in the forward direction.
      <br/>
      Fore foot portion flexion groove 4 serves to effect toe portion projections T1 and T2 and first metatarsal head projection T3 provided at the fore foot portion particularly in the kinetic performance that requires a firm stepping grip at an area from the medial side of the fore foot portion to the toe portion such as in dashing, batting, and throwing sideways.
    </p>
    <p num="77">Furthermore, an auxiliary projection 6, and an auxiliary projection 7 can be provided appropriately at the surface of the shoe sole as shown in FIG. 4.</p>
    <p num="78">Auxiliary projections 6 and 7 support the gripping force of each projection to contribute to improve the function.</p>
    <p num="79">Each spike hardware of the present invention can be formed by press-working a metal plate of a predetermined configuration to provide an upright projection portion, or by casting.</p>
    <p num="80">
      Each spike hardware can be formed of a synthetic resin such as nylon, polyurethane, and the like.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, a combination of such a synthetic resin and metal is possible.
    </p>
    <p num="81">For example, connecting washer 2 can be formed of a synthetic resin, and a projection molded from metal can be fixedly attached in the proximity of the leading edge of connecting washer 2.</p>
    <p num="82">
      The method of fastening each projection of the present invention to a shoe sole is arbitrary.
      <br/>
      A projection can be fastened by a pin into a hole 3 or by a bolt and nut.
    </p>
    <p num="83">Although not shown, it is possible to bury connecting washer 2 of respective projections within the shoe sole body so that each projecting portion protrudes from the surface of the shoe sole.</p>
    <p num="84">In this case, each projection can be formed individually.</p>
    <p num="85">
      As another embodiment of the present invention shown in FIGS. 13 and 14, a sole of a baseball spiked shoe including toe portion projections T1 and T2, first metatarsal head projection T3, stepping portion projection M1, and fifth metatarsal head projection M2 at the bottom plane can further have a first metatarsal head posterior projection M3 provided substantially parallel to the longitudinal line of the foot slightly posterior to the first metatarsal head.
      <br/>
      Projection M3 exhibits an effective stepping grip against shearing stress working laterally in a batting action, and serves to support the gripping force of first metatarsal head projection T3.
    </p>
    <p num="86">As a further embodiment of the present invention, a sole of a baseball spiked shoe can be provided characterized by including heel medial projection H1, heel posterior projection H3, and heel lateral projection H4 excluding heel anterior projection H2 of the projections provided at the heel of the bottom of the sole.</p>
    <p num="87">For players that concentrate on a running movement, the kinetic performance may be improved by having heel posterior projection H3 removed.</p>
    <p num="88">More specifically, in making a dash at full speed, each projection at the fore foot portion exhibits a gripping force, and the heel anterior projection provides no effective function.</p>
    <p num="89">
      FIG. 15 shows a sole of a baseball spiked shoe according to a still further embodiment of the present invention.
      <br/>
      FIG. 16 shows in detail a projection used in the embodiment of FIG. 15. The embodiment of FIG. 15 has a projection 50 shown in FIG. 16 provided for each projection of the embodiment shown in FIG. 3.
      <br/>
      In contrast to the embodiment of FIG. 3 wherein each projection has a blade configuration, projection 50 of the embodiment shown in FIG. 15 has a configuration as shown in FIG. 16. Reinforcing ribs 51 are formed at one side and a plane having friction force is formed at another side.
    </p>
    <p num="90">Referring to FIG. 15, toe portion projections T10 and T20, a first metatarsal head projection T30, a stepping portion projection M10, a fifth metatarsal head projection M20, a first metatarsal head posterior projection M30, and auxiliary projections S1, S2, and S3 are provided at the toe portion, similar to those of FIG. 3.</p>
    <p num="91">At the heel portion, four projections H10-H40 and an auxiliary projection S4 are provided, differing in arrangement from those of FIG. 3.</p>
    <p num="92">
      The embodiments of the present invention provide the following advantages.
      <br/>
      Baseball spiked shoes of the present invention improve the efficiency of the kinetic performance by conveying the kicking force of an action reliably against the ground since each projection is provided at the most effective position according to analysis of each kinetic action.
    </p>
    <p num="93">
      Natural flexibility of the fore foot portion is allowed during a kinetic performance.
      <br/>
      The function of each projection is sufficiently exercised.
      <br/>
      The stress on the foot of a player is reduced to alleviate fatigue.
    </p>
    <p num="94">Although the present invention has been described and illustrated in detail, it is clearly understood that the same is by way of illustration and example only and is not to be taken by way of limitation, the spirit and scope of the present invention being limited only by the terms of the appended claims.</p>
