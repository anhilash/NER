      Field of the Invention
    </p>
    <p num="3">This invention relates to a child exerciser/rocker and, more particularly, to a device for exercising and entertaining a child having a seat for supporting a child with an associated tray and a bowl-shaped base to facilitate rocking, engagable feet to preclude rocking, spring couplings between the seat and the base to facilitate bouncing with height adjustment components between the base and seat and with bearing surfaces between the seat and tray to facilitate 360 degree rotation with locking components therebetween to preclude rotation when so desired.</p>
    <p num="4">2. Description of the Background Art</p>
    <p num="5">
      There are a wide variety of devices in the marketplace today in which children may be placed for exercise.
      <br/>
      Similarly, there are a wide variety of devices in the marketplace today in which children may be placed for entertainment.
      <br/>
      In a limited number of cases, devices for entertainment may provide exercise and, conversely, devices for exercise may provide entertainment.
      <br/>
      In all such instances, however, care must be taken in the design and use of such devices to insure the maximum safety of the child as well as the peace of mind of the mother.
    </p>
    <p num="6">

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="17">
      Shown in the Figures, with particular reference to FIG. 1, there is shown a child exerciser/rocker 10 constructed in accordance with the principles of the present invention.
      <br/>
      From an overview standpoint, the child exerciser/rocker includes three major assemblies, a seat assembly 12, a base assembly 14, and a coupling assembly 16 therebetween.
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      With regard to the seat assembly 12, a seat 20 is provided for receipt of a child who is to receive the exercise and the entertainment while supported therein.
      <br/>
      The seat 20 comprises a rigid upper support 22 and a soft flexible lower support 24 therebeneath.
      <br/>
      Leg openings 26 are formed in the forward portion of the lower support for passage of the legs of a child supported therein.
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      The rigid upper support 22 is covered with a soft cushion 27.
      <br/>
      The cushion 27 is removably secured in position by elastic loops 29 permanently secured at their upper ends to the cushion and removably secured at their lower ends to a bearing retainer 31.
      <br/>
      Note FIG. 10.
    </p>
    <p num="20">
      Between the upper and lower supports 22 and 24 of the seat are spherical ball bearing members 30.
      <br/>
      Such ball bearing members are adapted to cooperate with an associated downwardly facing bearing surface 32 coupled to the seat.
      <br/>
      The bearing surface is also adapted to cooperate with an associated upwardly facing bearing surface 34.
      <br/>
      The bearing surface 32 is coupled to the tray components.
      <br/>
      This arrangement allows for circular rotation of the seat through 360 degrees with respect to the tray and base components therebeneath.
    </p>
    <p num="21">
      Extending radially outwardly from the circular bearing surface is a lower supporting structure in the form of a tray 38.
      <br/>
      Such tray has a radially interior opening 40 in a circular configuration sized and shaped for receiving and rotatably supporting the seat 20.
      <br/>
      Such support is at a location between the upper and lower supporting structures 22 and 24 of the seat.
      <br/>
      The lower supporting structure or tray also has a radially exterior periphery 42 formed as an upwardly extending flange in a circular configuration.
      <br/>
      Depending downwardly from adjacent to the exterior periphery of the tray are three conical projections 44.
      <br/>
      The conical projections assist in the locating and coupling of the seat tray, and upper supporting structures with respect to the components therebeneath.
      <br/>
      Associated lag bolts 45 and threaded apertures 47 in the tray loosely couple the tray 38 with the posts 62 and as such also function to couple the tray with respect to the posts 62 and base.
      <br/>
      Other types of bolts including screws could readily be used as a substitute for lag bolts 45.
    </p>
    <p num="22">
      A bowl-shaped base 54 at the bottom of the device is also provided.
      <br/>
      Such base is spherical in configuration at its lower extent and is adapted to rock in any direction.
      <br/>
      It is also adapted to rock the components supported thereabove.
      <br/>
      The upper periphery of the base is formed with three vertically extending and equally spaced upstanding towers 56.
      <br/>
      The towers extend in parallel relationship with respect to each other.
      <br/>
      Their upper ends are formed with openings 58 extending downwardly from their upper ends.
    </p>
    <p num="23">
      Three vertically extending posts 62 are also provided.
      <br/>
      Each post has a lower end received within a recess 58 of a upper end of a tower 56.
      <br/>
      An operator-controlled button 66 extends through each post and tower and is urged outwardly by a spring 68.
      <br/>
      This arrangement functions to fix the height of the post and seat with respect to the towers 56 and base 54.
      <br/>
      The buttons 66 may be depressed by a user to raise or lower the posts 62.
      <br/>
      In this manner a user may vary the height of the post and seat 20 with respect to the towers 56 and base 54.
    </p>
    <p num="24">
      Each post also has an upper end with a recess 72 for receiving a downwardly depending cone shaped projection 44 extending downwardly from the exterior periphery of the support structure.
      <br/>
      Such projections and recesses function in association with lag bolts 45 to locate the seat and tray with respect to the towers and base and to preclude rotation between the tray and base.
    </p>
    <p num="25">
      A spring 76 is operatively positioned between each post 62 and projection 44 of the support structure.
      <br/>
      Such springs 76 allow for bouncing of a child in the seat 20 with respect to the towers 56 and base 54.
      <br/>
      As such, a child in the seat 20 may rotate and/or bounce and/or rock by the shifting of his or her weight and the movement of his or her feet on the upper surface of the base 54.
    </p>
    <p num="26">
      The lower retainer has outwardly facing teeth 80 which may be engaged by a slide 82 on the bottom of the tray 28.
      <br/>
      The slide is movable by the user between an operative position out of contact with the teeth 80 to allow rotation of the seat and an inoperative position to engage the teeth to preclude rotation of the seat when so desired.
    </p>
    <p num="27">
      Lastly, three feet 86 are provided on the lower surface of the base.
      <br/>
      Each foot is pivotally secured by a hinge pin 88 in recesses 90 in the base.
      <br/>
      The feet are urged by springs 92 to the position in which they are set and to retain such set position.
      <br/>
      The feet are movable about their hinge pins 88 by a user between a recessed orientation within the recesses 90 to allow rocking and an extended orientation exterior of the recesses 90 to preclude rocking.
    </p>
    <p num="28">
      Optionally provided with the above described device are one or more toys removably coupled with respect to the flange of the tray.
      <br/>
      By way of example, toy 102 has a clip positionable over the flange with upstanding side walls supporting a ball 104 located on a pivot pin.
      <br/>
      Note FIG. 6.
      <br/>
      FIG. 7 is a clip 106 adapted to support a toy of any other type.
      <br/>
      Any of a wide variety of clips, toys and interconnections therebetween could readily be utilized.
      <br/>
      Although this invention has been described in its preferred form with a certain degree of particularity, it should be understood that the present disclosure of the preferred form has been made only by way of example and that numerous changes in the details of construction and combination and arrangement of parts may be resorted to without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention.
