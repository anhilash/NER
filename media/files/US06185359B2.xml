      The color television receiving device of the known system includes a color-television-signal-processing unit in accordance with the PAL color television system, this unit comprising a burst-phase discriminator, a sync separator, and a flip-flop forming a switching information generating unit for generating switching information.
      <br/>
      The switching information can be applied to a color subcarrier switch of the color-television-signal-processing unit, this switch changing the switching state when switching information occurs, in order to apply a color subcarrier whose phase is in accordance with the PAL color television system to an R-Y demodulator of a color signal demodulator.

    <p num="7">
      By means of the known reproducing device, it is possible to reproduce recorded color television signals in a normal reproducing mode and in at least one special reproducing mode.
      <br/>
      In a special reproducing mode, a reproducing head of the reproducing device, this head taking the form of an optical scanner, scans the record carrier in such a manner that the reproducing heads traverses adjacent track portions, which, in the present case, extend along a spiral path.
      <br/>
      When the reproducing head moves from one spiral track portion to an adjacent spiral track portion in a special reproducing mode, color sequence errors arise in the color signal, these errors forming a discontinuity in the reproduced color television signal.
    </p>
    <p num="8">The known system further comprises, as a control information generating unit, a special control unit which generates control information in the form of a jump signal upon the occurrence of a discontinuity in the reproduced color television signal during the passage from one track portion to an adjacent track portion in a special reproducing mode.</p>
    <p num="9">
      The reproducing device of the known system includes a color signal processing circuit comprising separate means with which color sequence errors in a color television signal reproduced by means of the reproducing device can be corrected.
      <br/>
      During the occurrence of a jump signal forming the control information, this separate means is controlled so as to correct the color sequence error producing a discontinuity.
      <br/>
      This separate means forms an additional element, which makes the reproducing device of the known system, and hence the entire known system, more expensive, which is a disadvantage.

    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="10">It is an object of the invention to avoid the afore-mentioned problems in a system of the type defined in the opening paragraph and to provide a system of the type defined in the opening paragraph, in which color sequence errors occurring in a reproduced color television signal during the passage of a reproducing head from one track portion to an adjacent track portion in a special reproducing mode can be corrected substantially without additional separate means in the reproducing device.</p>
    <p num="11">
      According to the invention, to achieve this object, a system of the type defined in the opening paragraph is characterized in that the control information generating unit of the system is connected to cooperate with the switching information generating unit of the color television receiving device, and in that the control information from the control information generating unit can be processed in the switching information generating unit and the switching information, which can be generated by means of the switching information generating unit, can be influenced by the control information.
      <br/>
      In this way, it is achieved that control information generated by the control signal generating unit can be processed by means of the switching information generating unit in the color television receiving device, the control information enabling the switching information, which can be generated by means of the switching information generating unit, to be influenced in such a manner that during the demodulation of a reproduced color signal to be demodulated by means of the color signal demodulator, this demodulation being effected with the aid of the influenced switching information, color sequence errors in said color signal can be corrected in the color television receiving device, practically only with means which are present anyway in the color television receiving device, which has the advantage that separate means for the correction of color sequence errors in the reproducing device of a system in accordance with the invention can be dispensed with, which is cost-saving.

    <p num="12">
      In a system in accordance with the invention, it has proved to be advantageous if the reproducing device is formed by a magnetic-tape video recorder device and the magnetic-tape video recorder device comprises two rotationally drivable magnetic heads as reproducing heads for reproducing color television signals from a magnetic tape which can be loaded into the magnetic-tape video recorder device as the record carrier and which is drivable in its longitudinal direction, color television signals being recorded on the magnetic tape in adjacent track portions which are inclined with respect to the longitudinal direction of the magnetic tape, each track portion carrying a given number of line signals of a color television signal and the line signals of adjacent track portions being recorded so as to be offset relative to one another in the longitudinal directions of the track portions, and if the control information generating unit is included in the magnetic-tape video recorder device and is connected to the switching information generating unit via an electrically conductive connection, and if the control information generating unit includes a phase-jump detector by means of which it is possible to detect a phase jump in a reproduced color television signal at the transition from one track portion to an adjacent track portion during reproduction in a special reproducing mode and by means of which the control information can be generated in dependence upon a detected phase jump.
      <br/>
      This results in a system having a particularly simple control information generating unit because this unit merely requires an easy-to-realize phase-jump detector.
    </p>
    <p num="13">
      In a system as described in the preceding paragraph, the phase jump detector can be adapted to detect a phase jump in the sequence of color subcarrier signals in the color signal of a reproduced color television signal.
      <br/>
      It has also proved to be advantageous if the phase-jump detector is adapted to detect a phase jump in the train of horizontal synchronization pulses in a reproduced color television signal.
      <br/>
      In practice, this has proved to be particularly advantageous for the reliable detection of a phase jump.
    </p>
    <p num="14">
      In a system in accordance with the invention, it has further proved to be advantageous if the reproducing device is formed by a magnetic-tape video recorder device and the magnetic-tape video recorder device comprises four rotationally drivable magnetic heads as reproducing heads for reproducing color television signals from a magnetic tape which can be loaded into the magnetic-tape video recorder device as the record carrier and which is drivable in its longitudinal direction, color television signals being recorded on the magnetic tape in adjacent track portions which are inclined with respect to the longitudinal direction of the magnetic tape, each track portion carrying a given number of line signals of a color television signal and the line signals of adjacent track portions being recorded so as to be offset relative to one another in the longitudinal directions of the track portions, and each time two of the four magnetic heads are arranged adjacent one another and form a head pair, and if the magnetic-tape video recorder device includes a head switching stage and a stage control unit for the head switching stage, which stage control unit can supply stage control information which can be applied to the head switching stage, in such a manner that in a special reproducing mode the reproduction can be switched from one magnetic head of a head pair to the other magnetic head of the same head pair at the transition from one track portion to an adjacent track portion, and if the control information generating unit is formed by the stage control unit for the head switching stage and the control information from the stage control unit can be applied as control information to the switching information generating unit.
      <br/>
      This has the advantage that a stage control unit for the head switching stage, which is present anyway in the reproducing device in such a system, is also utilized as control information generating unit.
    </p>
    <p num="15">
      In a system in accordance with the invention, it has further proved to be advantageous if there has been provided an envelope detector by means of which the amplitude of the envelope of a color television signal reproduced by means of ta least one magnetic head can be detected and by means of which detection information can be generated in dependence upon the detected amplitude of the envelope upon the occurrence of a discontinuity in a reproduced color television signal, which detection information can be applied to the stage control unit forming the control information generating unit and which influences the stage control information which can be supplied by the stage control unit.
      <br/>
      Thus, a system is obtained which has the advantage that a particularly reliable and correctly timed recognition of a discontinuity in a reproduced color television signal is guaranteed.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, it is favorable that a discontinuity is detected on the basis of the entire reproduced color television signal.
    </p>
    <p num="16">
      In a system in accordance with the invention, it has further proved to be advantageous if the switching information generating unit is adapted to generate switching information in the form of a rectangular switching signal of half the line frequency and to produce a 180 (degree)  phase shift in the rectangular switching signal as additional switching information upon receipt of control information applied to it.
      <br/>
      Such a switching information generating unit has the advantage that it can be realized in a particularly simple and consequently cheap manner.
    </p>
    <p num="17">
      In a system in accordance with the invention, it has further proved to be advantageous if the color television signals which can be reproduced from a record carrier by means of the reproducing device are in accordance with the PAL color television system and the color signal demodulator is formed by a PAL color signal demodulator which includes a color subcarrier phase switch, and if the switching information generating unit has an output connected to a control input of the color subcarrier phase switch of the PAL color signal demodulator, and if the switching information from the switching information generating unit can be applied to the control input of the color subcarrier phase switch to change the switching state of the color subcarrier phase switch.
      <br/>
      Thus, it is achieved that the switching information influenced in the switching information generating unit when control information occurs is applied to the color subcarrier phase switch and causes the switching state of this phase switch to be changed, which has the advantage that the color subcarrier phase switch of the PAL color signal demodulator is, in addition, used for the correction of a color sequence error.
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      In a system in accordance with the invention, it has further proved to be advantageous if the color television signals which can be reproduced from a record carrier by means of the reproducing device are in accordance with the SECAM color television system and the color signal demodulator is formed by a SECAM color signal demodulator which includes two color signal delay switches, and if the switching information generating unit has an output connected to a control input of each of the color signal delay switches of the SECAM color signal demodulator, and if the switching information from the switching information generating unit can be applied to each control input of the two color signal delay switches to change the switching states of the color signal delay switches.
      <br/>
      Thus, it is achieved that the switching information influenced in the switching information generating unit when control information occurs is applied to the two color signal delay switches and causes their switching states to be changed, which has the advantage that both color signal delay switches of the SECAM color signal demodulator are, in addition, used for the correction of a color sequence error.
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      In a system in accordance with the invention, it has further proved to be advantageous if the color signal demodulator and the switching information generating unit have been incorporated in an integrated circuit, and if the integrated circuit has a control information terminal via which control information from the control information generating unit can be applied to the switching information generating unit.
      <br/>
      In this way, the color signal demodulator and the switching information generating unit can be realized in a particularly compact and cheap manner.
    </p>
    <p num="20">
      In a system in accordance with the invention, it has further proved to be advantageous if the reproducing device and the color television receiving device and the control information generating unit have been arranged in a common housing and form parts of a combination apparatus.
      <br/>
      Thus, a system in accordance with the invention advantageously takes the form of a combination apparatus in which the color sequence errors in a reproduced color television signal are corrected directly, i.e., in the color television receiving device incorporated in the combination apparatus, while in the case that an electrically conductive connection is needed between a control information generating unit and the switching information generating unit in the color television receiving device such a connection is particularly simple to realize in a combination apparatus.
    </p>
    <p num="21">
      According to the invention, an integrated circuit of the type defined in the second paragraph is characterized in that the integrated circuit has a control information terminal via which control information can be applied to the switching information generating unit, this control information being characteristic of a discontinuity in a reproduced color television signal and by means of which the correction of color sequence errors in a reproduced color signal can be initiated.
      <br/>
      This results in an integrated circuit by means of which the color signal of a reproduced color television signal, which color signal is applied to the integrated circuit, can be demodulated with the aid of control information applied to the integrated circuit and by means of which, in addition, a color sequence error in the color signal of a reproduced color television signal can be corrected.

    <p num="24">
      FIG. 1 shows a system 1 in accordance with a first embodiment of the invention, comprising a magnetic-tape video recorder device 2, which forms a reproducing device, a color television receiving device 3, and a control information generating unit 4, in the present cases incorporated in the magnetic-tape video recorder device 2.
      <br/>
      The system 1 is accommodated in a housing 5 of a combination apparatus 6.

    <p num="25">
      The magnetic-tape video recorder device 2 is adapted to reproduce color television signals recorded on a magnetic tape 7, the magnetic tape 7 forming a record carrier.
      <br/>
      The magnetic-tape video recorder device 2 comprises a deck unit 8 for driving the magnetic tape 7 which can be loaded into the magnetic-tape video recorder device 2.
      <br/>
      The magnetic tape 7 is guided in its longitudinal direction 9 by means of movable tape guides 10, 11 and 12, 13 and is wrapped around a drum-shaped scanning device 14.
      <br/>
      By means of a capstan 15, which can be driven by a tape drive motor 17 via a drive transmission 16, shown diagrammatically as a dash-dot line, and against which a movable tape pressure roller 18 can be pressed, the magnetic tape 7 can be driven in its longitudinal direction 9 with a tape speed VT, i.e., either with a normal tape speed (VT)1 for making or reproducing a standard recording, or with a lower tape speed (VT)2, equal to half the normal tape speed (VT)1, for making or reproducing a long-play recording, or with at least one further tape speed (VT)n for reproducing a standard recording or a long-play recording in a special reproducing mode, which is often referred to as multi-speed reproduction.
    </p>
    <p num="26">
      The system 1 comprises a microcomputer 19.
      <br/>
      The microcomputer 19 can supply first motor control signals from its first output 20 to a first motor control stage 21, which controls the speed of the tape drive motor 17.
      <br/>
      The microcomputer 19 can supply second motor control signals from its second output 22 to a second motor control stage 23, which controls the speed of a drum motor 24.
      <br/>
      The drum motor 24 is coupled to a rotationally drivable drum section 26 of the scanning device 14 via a drive transmission 25 in order to drive the drum section 26.
      <br/>
      Generally know means, which are not shown and not described herein, have been provided for controlling the speed of the tape drive motor 17 and of the drum motor 24.
    </p>
    <p num="27">
      The rotationally drivable drum section 26 carries four magnetic heads SP-K1, SP-K2, LP-K1 and LP-K2 as reproducing heads for reproducing color television signals from the magnetic tape 7, which heads can thus be driven to rotate in a direction indicated by an arrow PR.
      <br/>
      The for magnetic heads SP-K1, SP-K2, LP-K1 and LP-K2 are arranged side by side in pairs and form a first head pair SP-K1, LP-K2 and a second head pair SP-K2, LP-K1.
      <br/>
      The magnetic heads SP-K1, LP-K1, which are disposed substantially opposite one another on the drum section 26, have a similar first azimuth angle AZI1, and the magnetic heads SP-K2, LP-K2, which are disposed substantially opposite one another on the drum section 26, have a similar second azimuth angle AZI2, which differs from the first azimuth angle AZI1.
      <br/>
      The magnetic heads SP-K1 and SP-K2 have a larger first gap width GAP1 and the magnetic heads LP-K1 and LP-K2 have a smaller second gap width GAP2.

      The magnetic heads SP-K1, SP-K2, LP-K1 and LP-K2 are adapted to reproduce color television signals recorded--as shown in FIG. 9--in juxtaposed track portions on the magnetic tape 7, which track portions are inclined with respect to the longitudinal direction 9 of the magnetic tape 7.
      <br/>
      Of the track portions 27 those referenced 27n to 27n-15 are shown at least partly in FIG. 9.

      Color television signals in adjacent track portions 27 are recorded on the magnetic tape 7 with mutually different azimuth angles AZI1 and AZI2 in order to reduce crosstalk and thus to improve the signal quality in the reproduced color television signals.

      From its fourth output 51, the microcomputer 19 can supply stage control information TI to the control input 52 of the SP/LP head switching stage 49 to change the switching state of the SP/LP head switching stage 49.
      <br/>
      Depending on the switching state of the SP/LP head switching stage 49 the terminal 48 or the terminal 50 of this stage is connected to a terminal 53 of the SP/LP head switching stage 49, depending on the head switching pulses HP produced by the microcomputer 19 on its third output 43 and depending on the stage control information TI produced microcomputer 19 on its fourth output 51 the color television signals reproducible by one of the four magnetic heads SP-K1, SP-K2, LP-K1 and LP-K2 can be transferred to the terminal 53 of the head switching stage 49.

      The magnetic-tape video recorder device 2 further has an entry unit 54 for the activation of at least one normal reproducing mode or at least one special reproducing mode.

      The keyboard entry unit 55 can supply mode information BI1 to a processing unit 56.

      The deck unit 8 comprises a stationary CTL magnetic head 58 which is in scanning engagement with the magnetic tape 7 and which, in known manner, enables CTL pulses to be recorded in and reproduced from a CTL track which extends in the longitudinal direction 9.

      The CTL pulses reproduced by the CTL magnetic head 58 in a reproducing mode can be applied to a CTL detector stage 59 formed by means of the microcomputer 19.

      By means of the CTL detector stage 59, it is possible to detect recording-mode information AI, which indicates whether the color television signals reproduced from the track portions 27 on the magnetic tape 7 have been recorded with the normal tape speed (VT)1 as a standard recording or with the lower tape speed (VT)2 as a long-play recording.
      <br/>
      The CTL detector stage 59 can supply this recording mode information AI to the processing unit 56 of the control information generating unit 4.

      By means of the envelope detector 60, it is possible to detect the envelopes of the color television signals applied to it and to generate envelope information HI as detection information which indicates whether the envelope of the color television signal reproduced by one of the two magnetic heads SP-K1 and SP-K2, or that of the color television signal reproduced by one of the two magnetic heads LP-K1 and LP-K2, has a larger amplitude.

      When a special reproducing mode has been activated by means of the entry unit 54 and when, on the basis of the recording mode information AI, the processing unit 56 detects that the color television signals reproduced from the magnetic tape 7 have been recorded with the lower tape speed (VT)2 as a long-play recording, a third operational state of the magnetic-tape video recorder device 2 occurs.
      <br/>
      In the third operational state, the processing unit 56 produces such motor control signals on the first output 20 and on the second output 22 of the microcomputer 19 that the motors 17 and 24 are controlled in such a manner that the magnetic heads SP-K1, SP-K2, LP-K1 and LP-K2 scan the magnetic tape 7 along a special track portion 63 shown in FIG. 9 in accordance with the selected special reproducing mode, this special track portion in the present case intersects the adjacent track portions 27n, 27n-1 and 27n-2.
      <br/>
      During one half revolution of the drum section 26, the special track portion 63 is scanned either by the first head pair SP-K1, LP-K2 or by the second head pair SP-K2, LP-K1.
      <br/>
      When the special track portion 63, which intersects the adjacent track portions 27n, 27n-1 and 27n-2, is scanned by the first head pair SP-K1, LP-K2, the processing unit 56 initially supplies such first switching information to the first switching control stage 61 and to the second switching control stage 62 that the color television signals reproduced from the track portion 27n, in which a color television signal has been recorded with the first azimuth angle AZI1, by the magnetic head SP-K1, which has the first azimuth angle AZI1, is supplied to the terminal 53 of the SP/LP head switching stage 49.
      <br/>
      While the magnetic tape 7 is being scanned by the first head pair SP-K1, LP-K2 along the special track portion 63, a transition from the track portion 27n to the track portion 27n-1 occurs initially, in which last-mentioned track portion a color television signal has been recorded with the second azimuth angle AZI2, which signal cannot be reproduced by means of the magnetic head SP-K1, which has the first azimuth angle AZI1, as a result of which the amplitude of the envelope of the color television signal reproduced by means of the magnetic head SP-K1 decreases strongly.
      <br/>
      However, the magnetic head LP-K2, which has the second azimuth angle AZI2, can reproduce a color television signal recorded in the track portion 27n-1 with the second azimuth angle AZI2, as a result of which, the amplitude of the envelope of the color television signal reproduced by means of the magnetic head LP-K2 increases strongly.
      <br/>
      At the transition from reproduction from the track portion 27n to the track portion 27n-1, a discontinuity appears in the color television signals reproduced by the magnetic head SP-K1 and subsequently by the magnetic head LP-K2 due to the strong decrease and the strong increase of the amplitude of the envelope.
    </p>
    <p num="41">
      The above-mentioned discontinuity in the television signals reproduced by the magnetic head SP-K1 and subsequently by the magnetic head LP-K2 can be detected by means of the envelope detector 60, which can supply corresponding envelope information HI to the processing unit 56 of the control information generating unit 4.
      <br/>
      When such envelope information HI appears as a result of the detected discontinuity, the processing unit 56 supplies such second switching information to the second switching control stage 62 that this stage produces such stage control information TI that the switching state of the SP/LP head switching stage 49 is changed in such a way that the terminal 50 of the SP/LP head switching stage 49 is connected to the terminal 53 of the SP/LP head switching stage 49 and, consequently, the color television signal reproduced by the magnetic head LP-K2 is applied to the terminal 53.

    <p num="42">
      During scanning of the special track portion 63 by the first head pair SP-K1, LP-K2 in the third operational state, a further transition from the track portion 27n-1 to the track portion 27n-2 occurs.
      <br/>
      This transition likewise produces a discontinuity in the color television signals reproduced by the magnetic head LP-K2 and subsequently by the magnetic head SP-K1.
      <br/>
      This discontinuity in the reproduced color television signals can also be detected by means of the envelope detector 60, after which the envelope detector 60 can supply corresponding envelope information HI to the processing unit 56 of the control information generating unit 4.
      <br/>
      When such envelope information HI as a result of the detected discontinuity occurs, the processing unit 56 supplies such switching information to the second switching control stage 62 that this stage supplies stage control information TI so as to change the switching state of the SP/LP head switching stage 49 in such a manner that the color television signal reproduced by the magnetic head SP-K1 appears on the terminal 53 of the SP/LP head switching stage 49.

      Depending on the activated special reproducing mode, the first head pair SP-K1, LP-K2 or the second head pair SP-K2, LP-K1 scans the magnetic tape 7 along a special track portion 63, the relevant special track portion intersecting a larger or smaller number of track portions 27.
      <br/>
      At the transition from one track portion 27 to an adjacent track portion 27, stage control information TI is supplied to the SL/LP head switching stage 49 by the control information generating unit 4, which, in the present case, advantageously also forms a stage control unit for the SP/LP head switching stage 49, so that in the activated special reproducing mode, the reproduction is switchable from a magnetic head of the first head pair SP-K1, LP-K2 or of the second head pair SP-K2, LP-K1 to the other magnetic head of the same head pair at the transition from a track portion 27 to an adjacent track portion 27.

      When, in a system as shown in FIG. 1, a special reproducing mode has been activated in which the first head pair SP-K1, LP-K2 and the second head pair SP-K2, LP-K1 scan the magnetic tape 7 along a special track portion 63 which intersects only a few track portions 27, the tape speed (VT)n in the special reproducing mode will not differ substantially from the lower tape speed (VT)2 with which the color television signals had been recorded in the track portions 27.
      <br/>
      In such a special reproducing mode, the special track portion 63 may, for example, intersect only the track portion 27n and the track portion 27n-1.
      <br/>
      In such a case, the control information generating unit 4 of the microcomputer 19 can supply stage control information TI to the SP/LP head switching stage 49 at a certain predetermined instant Tp, namely, after one of the magnetic heads SP-K1, SP-K2, LP-K1 or LP-K2 has scanned half the track portion 27n.
      <br/>
      This predetermined instant Tp, which, in the present case, is determined by the microcomputer 19 and is not influenced by envelope information supplied by an envelope detector, corresponds to the transition from the track portion 27n to the adjacent track portion 27n-1 where a discontinuity in the reproduced color television signals occurs.
      <br/>
      This generation of stage control information TI at certain predetermined instants Tp by means of a microcomputer is particularly simple and, consequently, advantageous, but it can only be used advantageously in those special reproducing modes in which the relevant special track portion 63 intersects only a small number of track portions 27, i.e., when the tape speed (VT)n in the special reproducing mode does not differ too much from the lower tape speed (VT)2.

      As is shown in FIG. 9, each track portion 27 comprises a given number of line signals 64 of a color television signal recorded in the relevant track portion 27, of which the line signals 641 to 64m are shown at least partly.
      <br/>
      The line signals 64 in a track portion 27, which adjoin one another in a longitudinal direction R of the track portions 27, have a different configuration in relation to the color signal of the color television signals recorded in the track portion 27, a first configuration of the color signal in a line signal 64 being marked with a plus sign (+) and a second configuration of the color signal in a line signal 64 being marked with a minus sign (-).
      <br/>
      In the case of the system 1 as shown in FIG. 1, the color television signals recorded on and reproducible from the magnetic tape 7 are signals in accordance with the PAL color television system.
      <br/>
      In accordance with the PAL color television system, the color signals have a configuration which differs with respect to the phase (+, -) of a color subcarrier, which exhibits a first phase (-) or a second phase (+).

      In the case of a long-play recording--as is shown in FIG. 9--the line signals 64 of adjacent track portions 27 are recorded so as to be shifted relative to one another in the longitudinal direction R of the track portions 27.
      <br/>
      At the transition of the reproduction of a line signal 648 of the track portion 27n, whose color subcarrier exhibits the first phase (-), to a line signal 647 of the track portion 27n-1, whose color subcarrier exhibits the second phase (+), a phase jump (- --&gt; +) in the phase of the color subcarrier of the reproduced color signals occurs, which forms a discontinuity in the color signal and which is referred to as a color sequence error.
    </p>
    <p num="47">
      It is to be noted that in the third operational state, each time that a discontinuity, as stated hereinbefore, occurs as a result of a strong decrease or increase in amplitude of the envelopes of the reproduced color television signal, also a discontinuity in the color signal of the reproduced color television signals is produced as a result of a phase jump in the phase of the color subcarrier.
      <br/>
      Thus, in the third operational state, both the first-mentioned discontinuity and the last-mentioned discontinuity are indicative of a color sequence error in the reproduced color television signals.

      Furthermore, the switching signal H/2, appearing on the output 103 of the first switching stage 102, can be applied to the detector 107.
      <br/>
      By comparison of the phase of the reproduced color subcarrier with the phase of the continuous wave, it is possible to derive phase information P, which indicates whether the reproduced color subcarrier exhibits the first phase (-) or the second phase (+).
      <br/>
      By evaluating the phase information P and detecting the phase of the switching signal H/2, which determines the switching state of the color subcarrier phase switch 95, the detector 107 can supply anti-phase information GI to a time-constant stage 108 if, due to the initial switching state of the color subcarrier phase switch 95, the alternating-phase color subcarrier and the reproduced color subcarrier are in phase opposition to one another.
      <br/>
      After the anti-phase information GI has appeared a given number of times, the time-constant stage 108 supplies the initial signal IS, shown in FIG. 4D, which has an edge 109.
      <br/>
      When the edge 109 appears, the phase or polarity of the switching information SI shown in FIG. 4E is changed upon the edge referenced 169, as a result of which the switching state of the color subcarrier phase switch 95 is also changed and, consequently, the alternating-phase color subcarrier is now in phase with the reproduced color subcarrier and is subsequently switched in phase synchronism.
      <br/>
      The time-constant stage 108 does not supply an initial signal IS until the anti-phase information has appeared several times, in order to preclude that noise in only one line signal 64 already causes the phase of the alternating-phase color subcarrier to be changed.
      <br/>
      The reliability of the detection whether the reproduced color subcarrier is in phase opposition to the alternating-phase color subcarrier is increased by the provision of the time-constant stage 108.

      In the system as shown in FIG. 1, it is advantageously possible, in the third operational state, to correct a color sequence error, which occurs at the transition from a track portion 27 to an adjacent track portion 27 and which is indicated by a discontinuity in the reproduced color television signal, by an additional phase change of the switching information SI, and thus, an additional phase change of the alternating-phase color subcarrier, namely, upon the occurrence of stage control information TI which is indicative of a discontinuity, which is applied to and processed in the switching information generating unit 96 of the color television receiving device 3 as control information TI, by means of which the correction of color sequence errors in a reproduced color signal can be initiated.
      <br/>
      For this purpose, the control information generating unit 4 of the system 2 is connected to cooperate with the switching information generating unit 96 of the color television receiving device 3 via an electrically conductive connection 110 so as to allow the control information TI from the control information generating unit 4 to be applied to the switching information generating unit 96 via the electrically conductive connection 110 and to be processed therein, enabling the switching information SI, which can be generated by means of the switching information generating unit 96, to be influenced by the control information TI.

      The control information TI applied to the input 111 of the color signal processing unit 78 can be applied to an input 112 of the second switching stage 104.
      <br/>
      When the edge 113, shown in FIG. 4C, appears in the control information TI, which forms the control information TI for the switching information generating unit 96, the phase of the switching information SI, which can be supplied by the second switching stage 104, is additionally changed in accordance with the edge 170 in FIG. 4E, and thus, the phase of the alternating-phase color subcarrier is additionally changed at the transition from a track portion 27 to an adjacent track portion 27, so that after this transition from a track portion 27, to an adjacent track portion 27 the alternating-phase color subcarrier is in phase with the reproduced color subcarrier and is subsequently switched in phase by means of the color subcarrier phase switch 95.
      <br/>
      The switching information generating unit 96--as is apparent from the above explanation--is adapted to generate a rectangular switching signal H/2 of half the line frequency as switching information SI, and to generate a 180 (degree)  phase shift in the rectangular switching signal H/2 as additional switching information upon receipt of control information TI applied to it.

      In order to ensure that constantly an R-Y color signal component is available on the output 117 of the color signal processing unit 123, the R-Y color signal component is transferred to the output 117 via the R-Y color signal delay switch 129 without being delayed when the color signal C includes an R-Y color signal component, and the R-Y color signal component is transferred to the output 117 via the R-Y color signal delay switch 129 delayed by the line period TH with the aid of the 1-H delay stage 127 when the color signal C includes a B-Y color signal component.

      The detector 107 supplies anti-phase information GI when the detector 107 detects the color carrier of the first center frequency, which frequency together with an R-Y color signal component is present in the color signal C, and when, on the basis of the detected phase of the switching signal H/2, the detector 107, at the same time, detects that the R-Y color signal delay switch 129 supplies the delayed R-Y color signal component on its output 131.

      The initial signal IS causes the phase of the switching information formed by a switching signal H/2 of half the line frequency to be shifted through 180 (degree) . As a result of this, the switching state of the color signal delay switches 129 and 134 is changed in such a manner that the delayed color signal components can be supplied to color signal delay switches 129 and 134 exactly when the respective other color signal components appear in the color signal C.

      By means of the envelope detector 60, it is possible to generate envelope information HI as detection information which indicates whether the color television signal reproduced by one of the two magnetic heads SP-K1 and SP-K2 or the color television signal reproduced by one of the two magnetic heads LP-K1 and LP-K2 has a better signal quality.
      <br/>
      On the basis of a strong deterioration in signal quality of a reproduced color television signal, it is possible, in the third operational state already explained hereinbefore, to detect the transition of a head pair SP-K1, LP-K2 or SP-K2, LP-K1 from a track portion 27 to an adjacent track portion 27, and thus, a discontinuity in the reproduced color television signal.
      <br/>
      The signal quality is determined by the amplitude of the envelope but also by the level of the crosstalk in the reproduced color television signal.
    </p>
    <p num="81">In the third operational state, in which the color television signals reproduced from the magnetic tape 7 originate from a long-play recording made by means of the magnetic heads LP-K1 and LP-K2, the crosstalk in the color television signals reproduced by means of the magnetic heads SP-K1 and SP-K2 is larger than the crosstalk in the color television signals reproduced by means of the magnetic heads LP-K1 and LP-K2 because the magnetic heads SP-K1 and SP-K2 have the larger first gap width GAP1.</p>
    <p num="82">The envelope detector 60 as shown in FIG. 5 is adapted to generate such envelope information HI that the control information generating unit 4 always supplies such stage control information TI that, when the envelope of the color television signals reproduced by the magnetic heads LP-K1 and LP-K2 have at least a minimum amplitude, the color television signals reproduced by the magnetic heads LP-K1 and LP-K2 can be transferred to the output 53 of the SP/LP head switching stage 49.</p>

      During those envelope halfwaves of the reproduced color television signals which are positive with respect to the reference potential 145, the first capacitor 144 can be charged to a voltage value UH via the first diode 141, which is conductive in this case, which value corresponds to the positive peak value of the envelope of the reproduced color television signals.

      The voltage value UH can be stored in the first buffer stage 143.

      During those envelope halfwaves of the reproduced color television signals which are negative with respect to the reference potential 145, the second capacitor 151 can be charged to a voltage value UL via the now conductive second diode 148, which value corresponds to the negative peak value of the envelope of the reproduced color television signals.

      By an appropriate choice of the resistance values of the resistors 153 and 156, it is possible to select a threshold value US between the voltage value UH and the voltage value UL, which threshold value US can be applied to the inverting input 154 of the comparator 147.

      At those instants at which the positive halfwave of the envelope of the reproduced color television signals corresponds to the threshold value US the comparator, 147 produces edges forming the envelope information HI on its output 157.
      <br/>
      Thus, the envelope detector 60 can supply envelope information HI to the processing unit 56 of the control information generating unit 4 when the amplitude of the envelope of the color television signals reproduced by the magnetic heads LP-K1 and LP-K2 becomes smaller than or larger than a threshold value US corresponding to a minimum amplitude.

      The construction of the envelope detector 60 as a peak detector is particularly advantageous because the minimum amplitude of the envelope of the color television signals reproduced by means of the magnetic heads LP-K1 and LP-K2 can be chosen freely by selection of the resistance values of the resistors 153 and 156.
      <br/>
      Moreover, in the envelope detector 60 in the form of a peak detector, allowance has been made for the fact that in the color television signals reproduced by means of the magnetic heads LP-K1 and LP-K2, the crosstalk from adjacent track portions 27 is smaller than in the color television signals reproduced by means of the magnetic heads SP-K1 and SP-K2, for which reason the color television signals reproduced by means of the magnetic heads LP-K1 and LP-K2 can always be transferred to the output of the SP/LP head switching stage 49 when at least the minimum amplitude of the envelope of the color television signals reproduced by means of the magnetic heads LP-K1 and LP-K2, which minimum amplitude corresponds to the selected threshold value US, is available.

During the reproduction of line signals 64 in the above-described third operational state, in which the magnetic tape 7 is scanned along a special track portion 63, the line pulses H, which recur after the fixed line period TH during normal reproduction of line signals 64 from a track portion H, appear non-recurrently before or after the line period TH upon the last occurrence of a line pulse H, i.e., shifted in time, at each transition from a track portion 27 to an adjacent track portion 27.
      <br/>
      This non-recurrent time-shifted occurrence of a line pulse H at the transition from one track portion 27 to an adjacent track portion 27, constitutes a discontinuity in the reproduced color television signal.
    </p>
    <p num="90">
      The line pulses H supplied by the sync separator stage 161 can be applied to a pulse generator 163.
      <br/>
      The pulse generator 163 periodically generates fixed pulses IF having a period equal to the line period TH and applies these fixed pulses IF to a phase-jump detector 162.
      <br/>
      The line pulses H supplied by the sync separator stage 161 can also be applied to the phase-jump detector 162.
      <br/>
      Moreover, a control signal MS (multi-speed control signal) can be applied from the processing unit 56 of the microcomputer 19 to the phase-jump detector 162 of the luminance signal processing unit 73, which control signal indicates that a special reproducing mode (multi-speed mode) has been activated in the magnetic-tape video recorder device 2.
    </p>
    <p num="91">
      In the third operational state, the phase-jump detector 162, the phase relationship PH between the fixed pulses IF and the line pulses H. As long as line signals 64 are reproduced from a single track portion 27 in the third operational state, a constant phase relationship PH is obtained.
      <br/>
      At a subsequent transition from a track portion 27 to an adjacent track portion 27, as occurs in the third operational state, a non-recurrent phase jump occurs in the phase relationship PH between the fixed pulses IF and the line pulses H as a result of the time-shifted occurrence of a line pulse H, which constitutes a discontinuity in the reproduced color television signal, which can be detected by means of the phase-jump detector 162.
      <br/>
      When such a discontinuity in the reproduced color television signal is detected and from the presence of a control signal MS, the phase-jump detector 162 learns that a special reproducing mode has been activated, the phase-jump detector 162 can generate control information in the form of phase information PD.
      <br/>
      The phase-jump detector 162, however, only generates phase information PD upon every second discontinuity detected by the phase-jump detector 162, which will be discussed in more detail hereinafter.
      <br/>
      Thus, by means of the phase-jump detector 162, it is possible to determine the offset of the line signals 64 of a track portion 27 with respect to the line signals 64 of an adjacent track portion 27 by detection of the afore-mentioned phase jump, and to derive control information in the form of phase information PD from the offset thus determined.
      <br/>
      The sync separator stage 161, the pulse generator 163 and the phase-jump detector 162, in the present case, form the control signal generating unit 4 of the system 1, which can generate the phase information PD as control information, which can be applied to the switching information generating unit 96 via the electrically conductive connection 110 and can be processed in this unit.

      The luminance signal processing unit 73 of the reproduction color-television-signal-processing unit 71 further includes a 1/2 H delay stage 173, which delays the luminance signal Y of the reproduced color television signals by half a line period TH.
      <br/>
      The luminance signal Y which has been delayed in the 1/2 H delay stage 173 can be applied to a first input 174 of a delay switch 175.
      <br/>
      The non-delayed luminance signal Y of the reproduced color television signal can be applied to a second input 176 of the delay switch 175.
      <br/>
      Upon each discontinuity detected by the phase-jump detector 162, the phase-jump detector 162 can supply delay information SK to a control input 177 of the delay switch 175.
      <br/>
      The switching state of the delay switch 175 can be changed by means of the delay information SK.
      <br/>
      Depending on its switching state, the delay switch 175 can transfer either the delayed luminance signal Y applied to the first input 174 of the delay switch 175, or the non-delayed luminance signal applied to the second input 176 of the delay switch 175, to the output 178 of the luminance signal processing unit 73.
    </p>
    <p num="93">
      Likewise, color signal processing unit 72 of the reproduction color-television-signal-processing unit 71 includes a 1/2H delay stage 179 and a delay switch 180.
      <br/>
      Depending on the delay information SK applied to the delay switch 180 of the color signal processing unit 72 by the phase-jump detector 162 of the luminance signal processing unit 73, either the color signals C delayed by the delay switch 180 or the non-delayed color signals C can be transferred to the output 158 of the color signal processing unit 72.
    </p>
    <p num="94">
      When it scans the special track portion 63 shown in FIG. 9, the magnetic head SP-K1, which has the first azimuth angle AZI1, can reproduce only the color television signals recorded in the track portions 27n and 27n-2.
      <br/>
      The color television signals recorded in the track portion 27n-1 have been recorded by means of a magnetic head having the second azimuth angle AZI2 and can, therefore, not be reproduced by means of the magnetic head SP-K1.
      <br/>
      The color television signals reproduced from the track portion 27n by means of the magnetic head SP-K1 have been shifted in time by half a line period TH with respect to the color television signals reproduced from the track portion 27n-2.
      <br/>
      When the phase-jump detector 162 detects a discontinuity, which appears at the point of transition of the magnetic head SP-K1 from the track portion 27n to the track portion 27n-2, and supplies delay information SK to the delay switches 175 and 180, the switching state of the delay switches 175 and 180, in a first case, is changed in such a manner that subsequently the non-delayed luminance signal Y is transferred to the output 178 of the luminance signal processing unit 73 and the non-delayed color signal C is transferred to the output 158 of the color signal processing unit 72.
      <br/>
      In this first case, the delay of the color television signal reproduced from the track portion 27n-2, which is dictated by the offset of the line signals 64 by half a line period TH, is compensated for in that the delay switches 175 and 180 change over from the signals (luminance signal Y and color signal C) delayed by the 1/2H delay stages 173 and 179 to the non-delayed signals.
      <br/>
      Therefore, no color sequence errors arise in this first case, for which reason, the phase-jump detector 162 does not supply phase information PD in this first case.
    </p>
    <p num="95">
      In a second case, in which the phase-jump detector 162 supplies delay information SK upon detection of a discontinuity and the switching states of the delay switches 175 and 180 are changed in response to the delay information SK and subsequently supply a delayed luminance signal Y and a delayed color signal C, the delay by half a line period TH, due the offset of the line signals 64, is added to the delay by the 1/2H delay stages 173 and 179, as a result of which the luminance signal Y appearing on the output 178 of the luminance signal processing unit 73 and the color signal C appearing on the output 158 of the color signal processing unit 72 are supplied with a delay by one line period TH.
      <br/>
      In the second case, a color sequence error occurs as a result of the delay of the reproduced color television signals by one line period TH because two successive line signals the have the same configuration.
      <br/>
      In the second case, the phase-jump detector 162 supplies phase information PD to the input 111 of the color signal processing unit 78 via the electrically conductive connection 110, thereby enabling the correction of color sequence errors in the reproduced color signal C.
    </p>
    <p num="96">When the phase-jump detector 162 detects a discontinuity in the reproduced color television signal, it supplies delay information SK to the delay switches 175 and 180 upon each detection of a discontinuity, and it supplies phase information PD to the color signal processing unit 78 of the color television receiving device 3 upon each second detection of a discontinuity.</p>
    <p num="97">In this way, a system 1 in accordance with the invention is obtained by means of which color television signals, which have been recorded on the magnetic tape 7 as a long-play recording and which can be reproduced only by means of two magnetic heads SP-K1, SP-K2 in a special reproducing mode during reproduction in a magnetic-tape video recorder device 2, can be displayed by means of the picture display device 122 without any color errors, i.e., with the correct colors.</p>
    <p num="98">
      It is to be noted that the line pulses H, which can be supplied by the sync separator stage 161 of the luminance signal processing unit 73 and which can be applied to the phase-jump detector 162, can alternatively be applied to the phase-jump detector 162 from the output 85 of the sync separator stage 83 of the color television receiving device 3.
      <br/>
      In that case, the sync separator stage 161 of the luminance signal processing unit 73 can be dispensed with.
    </p>
    <p num="99">
      FIG. 7 shows a system 1 in accordance with a fifth embodiment of the invention whose construction bears much resemblance to the system 1 as shown in FIG. 6 but in which system 1 of FIG. 7 the sync separator stage 161, the phase-jump detector 162 and the pulse generator 163 in the luminance signal processing unit 73 do not form a control information generating unit 4 as shown in FIG. 6, because these have been provided in the color television receiving device 3 in the system 1 of FIG. 7, which will be described in more detail hereinafter.
      <br/>
      Consequently, the phase-jump detector 162 cannot supply phase information PD to the color signal processing unit 78, for which reason no electrically conductive connection has been provided.
    </p>
    <p num="100">When a special reproducing mode has been activated in the system 1 as shown in FIG. 7, the processing unit 56 can generate a control signal MS (multi-speed signal), which can be applied to an input 172 of the color signal processing unit 78 of the color television receiving device 3 via an electrically conductive connection 171.</p>
    <p num="101">
      The color signal processing unit 78 of the system of FIG. 7 is shown in detail in FIG. 8.
      <br/>
      The color signal processing unit 78 also takes the form of an integrated circuit and is adapted to demodulate color signals in accordance with the PAL color television system.
    </p>
    <p num="102">As is apparent from FIG. 8, the control signal MS supplied to the input 172 of the color signal processing unit 78 can be applied to the switching information generating unit 96, i.e., to a control input 164 of a switch 165, which has been provided additionally in the switching information generating unit 96 of the present system.</p>
    <p num="103">
      In the switching information generating unit 96 of the color signal processing unit 78 as shown in FIG. 8, the detector 107 again takes the form of a phase detector.
      <br/>
      The reproduced color subcarrier appearing on the output 97 of the color subcarrier gate 92 can be applied to the detector 107.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, the continuous wave from the color subcarrier generator 181 can be applied to the detector 107.
      <br/>
      Moreover, the detector 107 is arranged to receive switching information SI formed by a switching signal of half the line frequency supplied by the second switching stage 104.
      <br/>
      By comparison of the phase of the reproduced color subcarrier with the phase of the continuous wave, it is possible to derive phase information P which indicates whether the reproduced color subcarrier exhibits the first phase (-) or the second phase (+).
      <br/>
      The detector 107 can supply anti-phase information GI by evaluating the phase information P and the switching information SI.
      <br/>
      If, on the basis of the switching information SI, the detector 107 detects that the color subcarrier phase switch 95 is in such a position that the alternating-phase color subcarrier supplied by the color subcarrier phase switch 95 is not in phase with the reproduced color subcarrier, the detector 107 generates anti-phase information GI.
    </p>
    <p num="104">
      First anti-phase information GIl is generated immediately after activation of a reproducing mode if the initial switching state of the color subcarrier phase switch 95 results in the reproduced color subcarrier and the alternating-phase color subcarrier being switched in phase opposition.
      <br/>
      Second anti-phase information GI2 is generated if a phase jump occurs at the transition from a track portion 27 to an adjacent track portion 27.
      <br/>
      The detector 107 can supply the anti-phase information GI1 and GI2 to the time-constant stage 108 and to a first input 166 of the switch 165.
      <br/>
      The time-constant stage 108 only supplies an initial signal IS to a second input 167 of the switch 165 after first anti-phase information GI1 has appeared a plurality of times.
    </p>
    <p num="105">
      When the normal reproducing mode is active, the initial signal IS received by the switch 165 can be applied to the input 106 of the second switching stage 104 by means of the switch 165 on the basis of the switching state of this switch 165 in order to change the phase of the switching information SI.
      <br/>
      When a special reproducing mode is active, the processing unit 56 supplies a control signal MS to the control input 164 of the switch 165 via the connection 171, as a result of which the switching state of the switch 165 is changed in such a manner that the first input 166 is connected to an output 168 of the switch 165, thereby enabling second anti-phase information GI2, received on the first input 166 of the switch 165, to be applied to the input of the second switching stage 104 via the switch 165 in order to change the phase of the switching information SI.
      <br/>
      Thus, when the normal reproducing mode is active, the initial signal IS, and when the special reproducing mode is active, the second anti-phase information GI2 can be applied from the output 168 of the switch 165 to the input 106 of the second switching stage 104 in order to change the phase of the switching information SI.
    </p>
    <p num="106">
      In the third operational state, in which the magnetic-tape video recorder device 2 is in a special reproducing mode and the processing unit 56 supplies a control signal MS to the control input 164 of the switch 165, the detector 107 detects a phase jump, which forms a discontinuity, in the phase of the color subcarrier of a reproduced color television signal at the transition of the reproduction from a track portion 27 to an adjacent track portion 27.
      <br/>
      Thus, in the system 1 as shown in FIGS. 7 and 8, the detector 107, which is adapted to detect an initial switching state, also forms the control information generating unit of this system, by means of which the second anti-phase information GI2 can be generated as the control information by which the correction of color sequence errors in a reproduced color signal can be initiated.
      <br/>
      The detector 107 supplies the second anti-phase information GI2 to the second switching stage 104 of the switching information generating unit 96 via the switch 165, as a result of which the phase of the switching signal of half the line frequency, supplied as switching information SI by the second switching stage 104, is changed by 180 (degree) . This switching information SI changes the switching state of the color subcarrier phase switch 95 and, consequently, the phase of the alternating-phase color subcarrier, as a result of which the demodulation of the R-Y signal component also proceeds correctly after the transition from a track portion 27 to the adjacent track portion 27.
    </p>
    <p num="107">The fifth embodiment of the invention described in the foregoing with reference to FIGS. 7 and 8, has the advantage of a particularly simple construction of the control information generating unit 4 because the detector 107 in the switching information generating unit 96 of the color signal processing unit 78 at the same time forms the control information generating unit and, as a consequence, substantially no separate means are needed to generate the control signal.</p>
    <p num="108">
      In order to increase the noise immunity of the switching information SI in the system of FIGS. 7 and 8, the second anti-phase information GI2 applied to the first input 166 of the switch 165 can also be applied to the first input 166 via a time-constant stage, the final anti-phase information being applied to the first input 166 of the switch 165 and thus to the second switching stage 104 after the second anti-phase information GI2 has occurred a few times.
      <br/>
      Thus, it can be precluded that a one-time error in the detection of a phase jump in the phase of the color subcarrier of a reproduced color television signal by means of the detector 107 results in the phase of the alternating-phase color subcarrier being changed by means of the color subcarrier phase switch 95.
    </p>
    <p num="109">
      It is to be noted that the reproducing device of a system in accordance with the invention can also be constituted by a video disc reproducing device adapted to reproduce color television signals from a video disc in which the adjacent track portions extend along a circular-arc or spiral path.
      <br/>
      Moreover, it is to be noted that a system in accordance with the invention need not be accommodated in a housing of a combination apparatus but the reproducing device and the color television receiving device may be accommodated in separate apparatuses interconnected by electrically conductive connections.
