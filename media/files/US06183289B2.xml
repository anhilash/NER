      <br/>
      An article adapted to pass a cable through a housing includes a substantially solid body, including front and rear ends.
      <br/>
      A side surface of the body provides a groove extending into the body from the front to the rear end.
      <br/>
      The groove is sized to carry a selected size electric cable.
      <br/>
      The body also includes connective structure adapted to removably connect the body to the housing.
      <br/>
      The article also includes a sheet of nonconductive material extending across the groove at the front end of the body.
      <br/>
      The sheet provides a circular opening sized to allow the cable to pass therethrough.
      <br/>
      The sheet also has a slit extending from the side surface to the circular opening.

      The sheet is fabricated of a resilient material and is structured to allow the cable to be inserted through the slit and into the circular opening such that the cable extends along the groove and extends into the housing from the rear end of the body when the body is connected to the housing.

    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">The invention relates generally to the field of digital data processing systems for distributed monitoring and control in industrial environments, and in particular to a compact, modularly expandable controller (called herein a "field controller") and internal dongles adapted for use with the controller.</p>
    <p num="3">
      Distributed control systems are often used in a number of commercial, industrial and home applications, in particular to monitor and control operations at manufacturing, chemical processing and similar industrial operations, to monitor and control environmental and other factors and so forth.
      <br/>
      In a manufacturing operation, a distributed control system will typically control machines which facilitate the manufacture and assembly of the products being manufactured.
      <br/>
      In addition, in a chemical processing operation, a distributed control system may control valves to control rates of flow of chemicals into and out of reaction chambers, and monitoring and/or controlling reaction temperatures and pressures and the like which are required to carry out the chemical process.
      <br/>
      In addition to controlling the manufacturing or chemical process, distributed control systems may perform bookkeeping operations to keep track of the inventory of inputs required for the manufacturing or chemical process, as well as the inventory of outputs produced by the operation.
      <br/>
      Typical distributed control systems essentially comprise large, centrally-located and expensive computer systems, which can be expensive to maintain and typically have limited expansion capabilities.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      A control system may include one or more PCMCIA cards that each couple to a device in the industrial environment, such as, for example, an instrument, monitor, machine or the like.
      <br/>
      Often, it is advantageous to include an active or passive circuit in the coupling between the controller and the device.
      <br/>
      The cable may include the circuit.
      <br/>
      In one arrangement, called a "dongle," the cable has an encapsulated end portion that includes the active or passive circuit and a connector.
    </p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="5">The invention provides a relatively compact, computationally powerful, easily-extendable and easily serviceable field controller for use in a variety of industrial, commercial and home applications.</p>
    <p num="6">
      According to one aspect of the invention, a field controller for use in a distributed control system with an area controller manages at least one controlled device in an industrial process operation.
      <br/>
      The field controller includes a processor module segment through which it can control a selected number of devices.
      <br/>
      The field controller may also include one or more expansion module segments, each having at least one PCMCIA card coupled to the process control segment to enable it to control a larger number of controlled devices.
      <br/>
      The processor module segment includes a processor module and at least one local interface module for interfacing to a controlled device, and the expansion module segment includes interface modules for interfacing to other controlled devices.
      <br/>
      In the processor module segment, the processor module and the local interface module are interconnected by a bus segment, which is also connected to an upstream off-module connector.
      <br/>
      Each expansion module segment includes at least one interface module, and also includes a downstream off-module connector and an upstream off-module connector, which are interconnected by a bus segment.
      <br/>
      The downstream off-module connector of each expansion module segment is adapted to mate with the upstream off-module connector of the processor module segment and of other expansion module segment, so as to facilitate the interconnection of the processor module segment and a sequence of expansion module segments by establishing a unitary multi-drop bus comprising the processor module's bus segment and the bus segments of expansion module in the sequence.
      <br/>
      The processor module controls each controlled device through the respective local interface module or expansion interface module connected thereto.
      <br/>
      The processor module segment and each expansion module segment are each mounted in a housing segment which is configured to form a unitary housing when they are interconnected.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      A benefit of this arrangement is that the number of controlled devices which can be controlled by the field controller be easily increased or decreased by adding expansion module segments to, or removing them from, the field controller.
      <br/>
      Since the bus created by the series of bus segments is an extensible multi-drop bus, the controlled devices can be connected to the field controller through any interface module connected into the field controller along the bus.
      <br/>
      Since the processor module segment and each expansion module segment also includes an integral housing segment, when the processor module segment and expansion module segments are connected together they provide a unitary, compact housing which is convenient in a commercial, industrial or home environment.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      According to another aspect of the invention, an industrial computing device, such as a field controller, includes a field mountable housing.
      <br/>
      The housing includes a primary housing with first and second side covers, and a removable front cover.
      <br/>
      The first side cover is structured and arranged to provide access to a processor within the housing from a first lateral side of the primary housing.
      <br/>
      The first side cover includes a mount on a rear side structured and arranged to mount the housing to a DIN rail.
      <br/>
      The mount is adapted to electrically connect to a ground bus within the primary housing with the first side cover coupled to the primary housing.
      <br/>
      At least one peripheral connector within the housing is adapted to receive at least one PCMCIA card such that when the PCMCIA card is plugged into the peripheral connector, the PCMCIA card is also within the housing and electrically coupled to the processor.
      <br/>
      An expansion connector is adapted to receive an expansion board which includes at least one more peripheral connector which itself is adapted to receive at least one more PCMCIA card.
      <br/>
      The second removable side cover is structured and arranged to provide access to the expansion connector from a second lateral side of the primary housing.
      <br/>
      The peripheral connector, the expansion connector, the primary housing and the first and second side covers are oriented orthogonal to a mounting plane of the industrial computing device.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      The primary housing includes I/O structure for mounting at least one I/O connector in a recess of the housing such that it is integral with the housing.
      <br/>
      The recess may be provided between the front cover and a hinged lid at a top or bottom end of the primary housing.
      <br/>
      A ground bus includes a connector which is structured and arranged to electrically couple to a body of the I/O connecter when mounted to the housing.
      <br/>
      The I/O connector may be an internal dongle which includes a body including connective structure being arranged to removably attach the body to the primary housing, and a circuit assembly, including an exterior connector on the body for electrically connecting to an external electronic device, a dongle circuit being electrically coupled to the external connector through the body, an electronic cable having a first end electrically coupled to the dongle circuit, and a second end including a connector being structured and arranged to connect to an electronic component within the housing, such as, for example, the PCMCIA card.
      <br/>
      The dongle circuit may include a passive circuit, an active circuit, or both on a circuit board attached to the body.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      The industrial computing device may further include an expansion module which includes the expansion board in an expansion housing.
      <br/>
      The expansion module mechanically couples between the primary housing and the second side cover and is oriented orthogonal to the mounting plane of the industrial computing device.
      <br/>
      Each of the primary housing and the expansion housing including a recess and other structure for mounting at least one I/O connector integral with the primary housing and the expansion housing, respectively.
      <br/>
      The expansion module may further include a second expansion connector adapted to receive a second expansion board in a second expansion module.
      <br/>
      The second expansion board includes at least one more peripheral connector being adapted to receive at least one more PCMCIA card.
      <br/>
      An addressing circuit automatically assigns the PCMCIA cards unique addresses wherein individual addressing of the PCMCIA cards is unnecessary.

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="12">
      FIG. 1 is a functional block diagram of a distributed control system 10 which includes a field controller constructed in accordance with the invention.
      <br/>
      The distributed control system 10 may be used, for example, in a number of commercial, industrial and home applications, in particular to monitor and control a variety of diverse types of operations.
      <br/>
      For example, in a manufacturing operation, the distributed control system 10 may, for example, control various machines and robots to facilitate manufacture of those components that are manufactured on site, and transfer of the components from inventory to assembly locations where they are assembled into the final product.
      <br/>
      In such an operation, the distributed control system 10 will also receive status information regarding the operational status of the various machines controlled by the system, as well as, for example, the inventory of the various components which may be used in manufacture of the end product and the assembly line, which status information the system 10 may use in controlling the rate of component manufacture and product assembly.
      <br/>
      Similarly, in a chemical processing operation, the distributed control system 10 may control the rates of flow of chemicals within the operation, as well as reaction parameters such as temperatures, pressures and the like of the chemical reaction chambers, with the control being exercised in response to corresponding status information the system 10 receives from the controlled components of the processing plant.
      <br/>
      In a commercial or home application, the distributed control system 10 may monitor and control of a variety of environmental factors, including, for example, heating, air conditioning, ventilation, energy consumption and supply, and so forth.
    </p>
    <p num="13">
      The distributed control system 10 depicted in FIG. 1 provides for distributed control in a commercial, industrial or home environment operation.
      <br/>
      In the illustrative embodiment depicted in FIG. 1, the distributed control system 10 includes an area controller 11 and one or more field controllers 12(A) through 12(C) (generally identified by reference numeral 12(F)), which may be conveniently interconnected by a network 13 or other communications arrangement.
      <br/>
      Although only three field controllers are shown in FIG. 1, it will be understood that a greater or fewer number of field controllers may be connected to area controller 11.
      <br/>
      The area controller 11 maintains overall control of the industrial operation under control, or a portion thereof, thereby maintaining overall control of the manufacturing process.
      <br/>
      Each of the field controllers 12(F), under control of the area controller 11, controls a portion of the plant, and in particular controls specific elements of the plant, such as specific machines (not shown) in a manufacturing operation or specific valves and reaction chambers in a chemical processing plant.
      <br/>
      In addition, each field controller 12(F) will receive status information preferably from sensors (also not shown) in its assigned portion of the plant which indicate their status in the process under control.
      <br/>
      Depending on the control information and operational parameters provided by the area controller 11 to a field controller 12(F), the field controller 12(F) may, in response to the status information it receives from the sensors connected thereto, control the machines to perform selected operations as determined by their programming.
    </p>
    <p num="14">In addition, the field controller 12(F) may notify the area controller 11 if the status information indicates that an operation in its area is outside of a selected operational range, and the area controller 11 may initiate corrective procedures in connection therewith.</p>
    <p num="15">
      FIG. 2 depicts a functional block diagram of a field controller 12(F) useful in the distributed control system 10.
      <br/>
      The field controller 12(F) comprises a plurality of modules, including a processor module 20 and one or more expansion modules 21(1) through 21(N) (generally identified by reference numeral 21(e)) whose electrical features are depicted in FIGS. 2.
      <br/>
      As will be described below, the modules 20 and 21(e) each have external connections which are positioned and configured to enable them to be connected together in a relatively compact manner.
      <br/>
      In addition, the modules 20 and 21(e) provide external interfaces to control devices in the factory environment.
      <br/>
      The entire field controller, comprising the processor module 20, one or more expansion modules 21(e), along with power supply and input/output devices which may be connected thereto (not shown) provides a very compact yet computationally powerful and easily maintainable package, which is convenient and quite useful in an industrial environment.
    </p>
    <p num="16">
      The processor module 20 comprises a processor submodule 22 and a local communications submodule 23.
      <br/>
      The processor submodule 22, in turn, includes a central processor unit (CPU) 24, a read only memory (ROM) 25 and a random access main memory 26, all of which are connected to a bus segment, such as, for example, ISA bus 27, and may also include other components as described below.
      <br/>
      The CPU 24 is preferably in the form of a microprocessor.
      <br/>
      The ROM 25 provides non-volatile storage which may be used for, for example, a BIOS (basic input/output system) portion of the operating system program that controls the CPU 24, and may also provide storage for certain other fixed operating information.
      <br/>
      The main memory 26, which may consist of one or more conventional DRAM (dynamic random-access memory) chips, provides storage for programs and data which may be down-loaded be the area controller 11 to enable the field controller 12(F) to operate, data received from the controlled devices and sensors controlled by the field controller 12(F), information processed by the CPU 24, and status information which may be retained for transmission to the area controller.
    </p>
    <p num="17">
      In addition to components 24 through 26, processor submodule 22 may include one or more external communication ports, such as, for example, serial ports 30.
      <br/>
      Ports 30 may be used, for example, for facilitating communications with the area controller 11.
      <br/>
      Processor submodule also includes devices such as light emitting diodes (LED) 31 for providing visual status indications, and devices for receiving local control input, such as a reset signal provided by a reset button (RST) 32. Processor submodule 22 may also include devices such as speakers (not shown) for generating audible alarm or status indications.
      <br/>
      All of these elements are indicated as being connected to ISA bus 27 over a system interface bus 33.
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      While ISA bus 27 conforms to the ISA bus specification, it will be appreciated that other types of busses may be used for a bus segment.
      <br/>
      Preferably, the bus segment will be in the form of a "multi-drop" bus, that is, it will facilitate the interconnection of more than two devices to facilitate the transfer of data and status information.
      <br/>
      In addition, the bus segment will preferably provide an interrupt facility, by which the central processor unit 24 can receive interrupt requests from other devices that are connected to the bus to notify it of conditions that may occur on an asynchronous or non-periodic basis which require servicing by the central processor unit 24, as will be described below.
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      The processor submodule 22 in one embodiment is preferably in the form of a single module having a form factor defined by the PCMCIA (Personal Computer Memory Card International Association) standard, with dimensions generally 3.375 inches long by 2.125 inches wide, by 0.25 inch deep, and having an ISA bus interface preferably along one of its long edges.
      <br/>
      A suitable processor sub-module 22 is currently sold by S-MOS Corporation as a model CARDIO (tm)  486 processor module, which provides the above-identified components and including an 80486-class microprocessor as the central processor unit.
    </p>
    <p num="20">
      The local communications sub-module 23 also includes a bus segment 40 and a plurality of PCMCIA interfaces 41(1) through 41(P) (generally identified by reference numeral 41(p)), which are interconnected by an interface controller chip I/F 42.
      <br/>
      The bus segment 40 of the local communications submodule 23 is logically similar to the bus segment 27 of the processor sub-module 22.
      <br/>
      In the described embodiment, in which the processor submodule's bus segment 27 conforms to the ISA bus specification, the local communication sub-module's bus segment 40 will also conform to the ISA bus specification.
      <br/>
      The local communications sub-module's bus segment 40 connects to the processor sub-module's bus segment 27 through a downstream connector 43.
    </p>
    <p num="21">
      The interface controller chip I/F 42 provides a connection from the bus segment 40 to the PCMCIA interfaces 41(p).
      <br/>
      Each PCMCIA interface in turn, provides a connection to a PCMCIA device, that is, a device which conforms to the electrical interface defined by the PCMCIA specification identified above.
      <br/>
      The PCMCIA specification defines, in addition to the PCMCIA form factor described above, an electrical interface which is essentially a point-to-point bus, that is, a bus which interconnects only two devices. (This is in contrast to the ISA bus specification which, as described above, defines a multi-drop bus, which can interconnect more than two devices.) Each PCMCIA interface 41(p) includes an interface connector 44(p) which connects to the interface controller chip 42, an interface card 45(p), and an external interface 46(p) which provides an interface to a controlled device (not shown) which may be located in the industrial environment, as described above.
      <br/>
      The interface card 45(p) is preferably constructed in the PCMCIA form-factor as described above, and provides circuitry which converts between PCMCIA signals provided by the interface controller chip 42 and signals transmitted to and received from the controlled device or sensor connected to the card 45(p).
      <br/>
      It will be appreciated that the particular circuitry provided in each interface card 45(p) will generally depend on the particular controlled device or sensor to which the card 45(p) is connected.
    </p>
    <p num="22">
      As described above, the processor module 20 provides an interface to two controlled devices through the local communications sub-module 23.
      <br/>
      To increase the number of devices which may be controlled by the local controller, one or more expansion modules 21(e) may be connected to the processor module 20.
      <br/>
      In particular, the local communications sub-module 23, in addition to providing a connector 43 to the processor module 22, also provides an upstream connector 47, which may be connected to an expansion module 21(1), as shown in FIG. 2.
    </p>
    <p num="23">
      Each expansion module 21(e), the physical structure of which will be described below, is electrically and logically similar to the local communications sub-module 23.
      <br/>
      That is, it is provided with a downstream connector 50, a bus segment 51, an upstream connector 52, an interface controller chip 53 and a plurality of PCMCIA interfaces 54(1) through 54(Pe) (generally identified by reference numeral 54(P)) which include an interface connector 55(p) which connects to the interface controller chip 53, an interface card 56(p), and an external interface 57(p) which provides an interface to a controlled device (not shown) which may be located in the industrial environment, as described above.
      <br/>
      In one embodiment, the maximum number of PCMCIA interfaces 54(Pe) that may be connected in an expansion controller, which also corresponds to the number of PCMCIA interfaces 41(p) which can be connected in the processor sub-module 20, is two, but it will be appreciated that an expansion module 21(e) may provide more or fewer interfaces than the processor module 20.
      <br/>
      The downstream connector 50 of the first expansion module 21(1) connects to the external connector 47 of the processor module 20, to connect the bus segment 51 of the first expansion module 21(1) to the bus segment 40 of the local communications sub-module 23, and thus to facilitate the transfer of signals from the processor sub-module 22 to the first expansion module 21(1).
      <br/>
      The bus segment 51 couples the signals from the downstream connector 50 to the upstream connector 52 for transfer to a further expansion module 21(2) through its downstream connector 50(2), if one is provided in the field controller 12(F).
      <br/>
      As in the local communications sub-module 23, the interface controller chip 53 couples signals between the bus segment 51 and the PCMCIA interfaces 54(Pe) which are provided in the first expansion module 21(1).
    </p>
    <p num="24">
      As noted above, the expansion modules 21(e) are all electrically similar (and are similar to the local communications sub-module 23 as described above).
      <br/>
      Accordingly, for each expansion module 21(e) after the first, the respective downstream connector 50(e) will connect to the upstream connector 52(e-1) of the preceding expansion module 21(e-1) in the series, and the upstream connector 52(e) will connect to the downstream connector 50(e+1) of the next expansion module 21(e+1) in the series, with the module's bus segment 51(e) coupling signals between the downstream connector 50(e) and the upstream connector 52(e).
      <br/>
      The interface controller chip 53(e) in the respective expansion module 21(e) connects to the bus segment 51 and the PCMCIA interfaces 54(Pe) allowing the expansion module 21(e) to connect to a number of controlled devices over respective PCMCIA interfaces (not shown).
      <br/>
      For each expansion module 21(e) the bus segments 27 . . . 40 . . . 51(e), interconnected by respective connectors 43, 47, 50(1), 52(1), 50(e), 52(e), provide a continuous path for carrying data and control signals from the central processor unit CPU 24 of the processor sub-module 22 to the respective local communications sub-module 23 and expansion module 21(e).
      <br/>
      The central processor unit CPU 24 is able to control the controlled device(s) through the PCMCIA interfaces 45(p) (as in the case of a controlled device connected to the local communications sub-module 23) or 54(Pe) (as in the case of a controlled device connected to an expansion module 21(e).
    </p>
    <p num="25">
      The field controller 12(F) further includes a module selection arrangement, which is described in detail in co-pending co-owned application Ser.
      <br/>
      No. 08/560,167, filed Nov. 20, 1995, the entire disclosure of which is included herein by reference.
      <br/>
      It will suffice to mention here that the processor sub-module 22 can select which of the local communications sub-module 23 or expansion module 21(e) is to receive signals transmitted by it (that is, the processor sub-module 22) on the respective bus segments 27 . . . 40 . . . 51(e), or which of the local communications sub-module 23 or expansion module 21(e) is to transmit signals to it (that is, the processor sub-module 22) onto the respective bus segments 27 . . . 40 . . . 51(e).
      <br/>
      The processor submodule 22 includes an addressing circuit that automatically assigns unique addresses to the PCMCIA cards, such that individual addressing of the PCMCIA cards is unnecessary.
    </p>
    <p num="26">
      The field controller 12(F) provides an architecture which may be conveniently implemented in a compact package which can be readily installed and maintained in a factory environment.
      <br/>
      One embodiment of such an implementation will be described below.
      <br/>
      The field controller of the described embodiment may be mounted on, for example, a vertical support such as a wall, with the processor module 20 (or, as it will be referred to below, the "head unit") and each expansion module 21(e) being generally configured so that, when an expansion module is added to the field controller 12(F), it will be connected to the head unit 20 or to previously-provided expansion modules so as to extend the field controller 12(F) in a direction which is generally parallel to a plane of the vertical support.
      <br/>
      Another embodiment, described in Ser.
      <br/>

      Stand-offs 92 are held in place with respect to head unit housing 70 at least in part by ground straps 83 which form portions of a head unit ground bus 85.
      <br/>
      Head unit housing 70 is also held in position with respect to an adjacent expansion module 21(e) or left side cover 66 by receiving alignment pins 77'(e) (see FIGS. 7 and 10) formed on the adjacent expansion module 21(e) or cover 66 into alignment apertures 77.

      The following description applies equally to all expansion units 21(e) because they are configured identically.
      <br/>
      Expansion module 21(e) includes an expansion board, generally identified by 81(e), in the expansion housing 74(e).
      <br/>
      The expansion unit 20(e) illustrated in FIG. 6 is mechanically coupled to the head unit 20 between the head unit 20 and the left side cover 66, although there may be one or more other expansion modules 21(e) between the left side cover 66 and the expansion module located adjacent the head unit 20, as illustrated in FIGS. 3 and 4.
      <br/>
      Like head unit 20 and the side covers 66, 68, all expansion modules 21(e) are narrow units which are oriented orthogonal to the mounting plane of the field controller 12(F).
      <br/>
      Expansion board 81(e) is held in place by stand-offs, generally identified by 92(e), which connect to stand-offs 92 in head unit 20 in the configuration illustrated in FIG. 6.
      <br/>
      Expansion housing front cover 76(e) has brackets 90(e) which snap in and out of engagement with front stand-offs 92(e).
      <br/>
      Expansion housing 74(e) is held in place relative to expansion board 81(e) at least in part by two ground straps (only one visible in FIG. 6), generally identified by 83(e), that couple to front stand-offs 92(e).
      <br/>
      Each ground strap 83(e) forms a part of a ground bus 85(e) inside the expansion housing 74(e).
      <br/>
      Ground bus 85(e) connects to ground at the DIN rail 64 via the stand-offs 92(e), as does the ground bus 85 in the head unit 22.

      Each expansion board 81(e) includes a pair of peripheral connectors 93(e1) and 93(e2) (generally identified by 93(e)) positioned on a side facing away from the head unit 20.
      <br/>
      Either or both of peripheral connectors 93(e) may receive a PCMCIA card 95(e).
      <br/>
      Peripheral connectors 93(e) and any attached PCMCIA cards 95(e) are aligned side-by-side in parallel with expansion unit board 81(e).

      <br/>
      A downstream expansion connector 50 is positioned on the side of the expansion board 81(e) nearest the head unit 20.
      <br/>
      Each upstream expansion connector 52 is adapted to connect to a downstream expansion connector 50 on another expansion board 81(e) in a different expansion module.
      <br/>
      The downstream expansion connector 50 on the right-most expansion module 21(2) connects to the upstream expansion connector 47 on the head board 80.
      <br/>
      The upstream expansion connector on the left-most expansion module 21(1) does not connect to anything because it is adjacent the left side cover 66.

      Stand-offs 92 and 92(e) each include a threaded left end 97 that screws into the right end of the next left-most stand-off 92(e).
      <br/>
      Stand-offs 92(e) of expansion module 21(1) screw into threaded fittings in left side cover 66.
      <br/>
      The connected stand-offs 92, 92(e), which are made of a conductive metal, provide a ground bus that runs through the chassis and electrically couples to a ground line on each expansion board 81 and the head board 80.
      <br/>
      The two front stand-offs 92(e) which connect to the left side cover 66 connect to a ground strip 97 that extends between the front stand-offs 92(e) and also extends to an aperture 99 at the rear of the left side cover 66.
      <br/>
      Referring now also to FIG. 8, a spring-like portion 101 of ground strip 97 extends through aperture 99 for making electrical connection with a DIN rail.
      <br/>
      Referring also now to FIG. 9, which shows a detail of a mounting arrangement for the right side cover 68, each of the side covers 66, 68 includes a molded top hook 109 which is adapted to fit over the top edge of the DIN rail 64.
      <br/>
      After top hook 109 is placed over the DIN rail 64, a quarter-turn pawl 107 which extends through bracket 105 is turned upwards to engage the lower end of the DIN rail 64.
      <br/>
      Tightening the pawl 107 presses the spring-like portion 101 of the ground strip 97 into electrical engagement with the DIN rail 64, thereby providing a ground path for the field controller 12(F).
