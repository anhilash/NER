      An immunization strategy to provide protection against disease caused by infection with a paramyxoviridae virus, specifically respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and parainfluenza virus, is described.
      <br/>
      A priming intranasal administration of a recombinant virus expressing at least one RSV or PIV protein or immunogenic sequence there first is made to the host followed by a booster administration of at least one purified RSV or PIV protein or immunogenic fragment thereof, which may be adjuvanted with alum.
      <br/>
      This immunization strategy provides a safe and effective means of controlling RSV and PIV infections.
      <br/>
      The strategy leads to a stronger protective immune response than other strategies and to the induction of a more balanced Th-1/Th-2 type response than previously attained.
      <br/>
      Novel recombinant poxviruses are provided containing nucleic acid encoding a paramyxovirus protein or immunogenic fragment thereof is a non-essential region of the poxvirus genome, specifically NYVAC-F and ALVAC-F, which produce the F glycoprotein of RSV.

    <heading>FIELD OF INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="1">The present invention relates to the field of immunology and, in particular, to a vaccination procedure for protection of a host against disease caused by infection with a virus of the paramyxoviridae family, particularly respiratory syncytial virus (RSV).</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND TO THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">
      Human parainfluenza virus type 1, 2, 3 and human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) have been identified as the major viral pathogens responsible for severe respiratory tract infections in infants and young children (ref. 1 to 3--Throughout this specification, various references are referred to in parenthesis to more fully describe the state of the art to which this invention pertains.
      <br/>
      Full bibliographic information for each citation is found at the end of the specification, immediately following the claims.
      <br/>
      The disclosures of these references are hereby incorporated by reference into the present disclosure).
      <br/>
      RSV has also been reported to cause significant morbidity in immunocompromised individuals and the elderly.
      <br/>
      Globally 65 million infections occur every year resulting in 160,000 deaths (ref. 4).
      <br/>
      In the USA alone, 100,000 children are hospitalized annually with severe cases of pneumonia and bronchiolitis resulting from an RSV infection (refs. 5, 6).
      <br/>
      Inpatient and ambulatory care for children with RSV infections has been estimated to cost in excess of $340 million each year in the USA (ref. 7).
      <br/>
      Severe lower respiratory tract disease due to RSV infection predominantly occurs in infants two to six months of age (ref. 8).
      <br/>
      The World Health Organization (WHO) and the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease (NIAID) vaccine advisory committees have ranked RSV second only to HIV for vaccine development while the preparation of an efficacious PIV-3 vaccine is ranked in the top ten vaccines considered a priority for vaccine development.
      <br/>
      Both the annual morbidity and mortality figures as well as the staggering health care costs for managing paramyxoviridae infections including RSV have provided the incentive for aggressively pursuing the development of efficacious RSV vaccines.
    </p>
    <p num="3">
      RSV is a member of the Paramyxoviridae family of pneumovirus genus (ref. 2).
      <br/>
      The two major protective antigens of RSV are the envelope fusion (F) and attachment (G) glycoproteins (ref. 9).
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      In addition to the antibody response generated by the F and G glycoproteins, human cytotoxic T-cells have been shown to recognize the F protein RSV matrix (M) protein, nucleoprotein (N), small hydrophobic protein (SH) and nonstructural protein (lb) (ref. 10), produced following RSV infection.
      <br/>
      For PIV-3, the protective immunogen are the hemagglutinin-neuramidase (HN) protein and the fusion (F) protein.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      Previous attempts to produce a safe and effective RSV vaccine were unsuccessful.
      <br/>
      Production of live attenuated RSV vaccines has had limited success.
      <br/>
      The mutants prepared to date have all been either over-attenuated, virulent or genetically unstable.
      <br/>
      A formalin-inactivated (FI) RSV vaccine developed in the 1960's failed to provide adequate protection in clinical trials (refs. 8, 11, 12).
      <br/>
      In fact, immunization of seronegative infants with the FI-RSV vaccine resulted in the exacerbation of RSV disease (immunopotentiation) in some vaccinees following exposure to wild type virus.
      <br/>
      Identification of the major immunoprotective antigens of RSV has provided the scientific rationale for pursuing a subunit approach to RSV vaccine development.
      <br/>
      However, efficacy of the RSV subunit vaccines tested to date have been inconsistent (ref. 12).
      <br/>
      There is also conflicting reports in the literature on the ability of an alum-adjuvanted RSV vaccine containing the F protein purified from virus infected cells by immunoaffinity chromatography (PFP-1) to cause enhanced pulmonary pathology (immunopotentiation) following live virus challenge (ref. 13 and 14).
      <br/>
      There is a definite requirement for the development of a safe and efficacious RSV vaccine.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      One of the main obstacles in developing a safe and effective RSV vaccine has been to produce a vaccine formulation that can elicit a protective immune response without causing exacerbated disease.
      <br/>
      Elucidation of the mechanism(s) involved in the potentiation of RSV disease is important for the design of safe RSV vaccines, especially for the seronegative population.
      <br/>
      Recent experimental evidence suggests that an imbalance in cell-mediated responses may contribute to immunopotentiation (ref. 15).
      <br/>
      Enhanced histopathology observed in mice that were immunized with the FI-RSV and challenged with virus could be abrogated by depletion of CD4+ cells or both interleukin-4 (IL-4) and IL-10 (ref. 16).
      <br/>
      Experimental results indicated that induction of a Th-2 type response may play a role in disease potentiation.
      <br/>
      BALB/c mice given live virus intranasally or intramuscularly elicited a Th-1 type response, whereas FI-RSV induced a Th-2 type of response.
      <br/>
      These results were recently substantiated by the finding that BALB/c mice that were immunized with the FI-RSV vaccine had a marked increase in the expression of mRNA (from cells in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid) for the Th-2 cytokines IL-5 and IL-13 (ref. 17).
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      Studies on the development of live viral vaccines and glycoprotein subunit vaccines against parainfluenza virus infection are being pursued.
      <br/>
      Clinical trial results with a formalin-inactivated PIV types 1,2,3 vaccine demonstrated that this vaccine was not efficacious (refs. 33, 34, 35).
      <br/>
      Further development of chemically-inactivated vaccines was discontinued after clinical trials with a formalin-inactivated RSV vaccine demonstrated that not only as the vaccine not effective in preventing RSV infection but many of the vaccinees who later became infected with RSV suffered a more serious disease.
      <br/>
      Most of parainfluenza vaccine research has focussed on candidate PIV-3 vaccines (ref. 36) with significantly less work being reported for PIV-1 and PIV-2.
      <br/>
      Recent approaches to PIV-3 vaccines have included the use of the closely related bovine parainfluenza virus type 3 and the generation of attenuated viruses by cold-adaptation of the virus (refs. 37, 38, 39, 40).
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      Another approach to parainfluenza virus type 3 vaccine development is a subunit approach focusing on the surface glycoproteins hemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN) and the fusion (F) protein (refs. 41, 42, 43).
      <br/>
      The HN antigen, a typical type II glycoprotein, exhibits both haemagglutination and neuraminidase activities and is responsible for the attachment of the virus to sialic acid containing host cell receptors.
      <br/>
      The type I F glycoprotein mediates fusion of the viral envelope with the cell membrane as well as cell to cell spread of the virus.
      <br/>
      It has recently been demonstrated that both the HN and F glycoproteins are required for membrane fusion.
      <br/>
      The F glycoprotein is synthesized as an inactive precursor (F) which is proteolytically cleaved into disulfide-linked F2 and F1 moieties.
      <br/>
      While the HN and F proteins of PIV-1, 2 and 3 are structurally similar, they are antigenically distinct.
      <br/>
      Neutralizing antibodies against the HN and F proteins of one PIV type are not cross-protective.
      <br/>
      Thus, an effective PIV subunit vaccine must contain the HN and F glycoproteins from the three different types of parainfluenza viruses.
      <br/>
      Antibody to either glycoprotein is neutralizing in vitro.
      <br/>
      A direct correlation has been observed between the level of neutralizing antibody titres and resistance to PIV-3 infections in infants.
      <br/>
      Native subunit vaccines for parainfluenza virus type 3 have investigated the protectiveness of the two surface glycoproteins.
      <br/>
      Typically, the glycoproteins are extracted from virus using non-ionic detergents and further purified using lectin affinity or immunoaffinity chromatographic methods.
      <br/>
      However, neither of these techniques may be entirely suitable for large scale production of vaccines under all circumstances.
      <br/>
      In small animal protection models (hamsters and cotton rats), immunization with the glycoproteins was demonstrated to prevent infection with live PIV-3 (refs. 44, 45, 46, 47, 48).
      <br/>
      The HN and F glycoproteins of PIV-3 have also been produced using recombinant DNA technology.
      <br/>
      HN and F glycoproteins have been produced in insect cells using the baculovirus expression system and by use of vaccinia virus and adenovirus recombinants (refs. 49, 50, 51, 52, 53).
      <br/>
      In the baculovirus expression system, both full-length and truncated forms of the PIV-3 glycoproteins as well as a chimeric F-HN fusion protein have been expressed.
      <br/>
      The recombinant proteins have been demonstrated to be protective in small animal models (see WO91/00104, U.S. patent application Ser.

      The construction of the recombinant poxviruses is described in a number of granted United States patents, including U.S. Pat.

    <p num="10">
      Live recombinant poxviruses expressing the relevant viral proteins may be used alone or as priming immunogens in a prime/boost regime with the subunit vaccine.
      <br/>
      Despite having promising attributes as a "universal" immunization vehicle, safety issues have provided a concern for the re-introduction of vaccinia virus as an immunizing agent.
      <br/>
      These concerns stem from complications observed during the Smallpox Eradication Program (ref. 18).
      <br/>
      From one perspective, the safety issues surrounding the use of vaccinia-based vaccine candidates have been addressed with the development of the NYVAC and ALVAC vectors.
    </p>
    <p num="11">
      The NYVAC strain was derived from the vaccinia virus Copenhagen strain by the precise deletion of 18 ORFs encoding functions implicated in the pathogenicity of orthopoxviruses, as well as host-range regulatory functions governing the replication competency of these viruses on cells from certain species (ref. 19).
      <br/>
      General biological properties of NYVAC include: �1� a highly debilitated replicative capacity on cells derived from mice, swine, equids, and humans; �2� the ability to replicate with wildtype efficiency on primary chick embryo fibroblasts, and �3� a highly attenuated phenotype in immunocompetent and immunocompromised animal systems used historically to assess the virulence of vaccinia virus strains (ref. 19).
      <br/>
      Despite these highly attenuated properties, NYVAC has been shown to function effectively as an immunization vehicle (ref. 19, 20).
      <br/>
      These properties are consistent with NYVAC providing a safer alternative to existing vaccinia virus vaccine strains for developing vector-based vaccine candidates.
      <br/>
      Due to the attenuation profile of NYVAC, the Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee of the National Institutes of Health has reduced the biological containment level of this virus from BSL-2 to BSL-1.
      <br/>
      It is the only member of the Orthopoxvirus genus accorded to a BSL-1 biocontainment level.
    </p>
    <p num="12">
      The basic vaccinia virus vector technology has been extended to other members of the poxvirus family.
      <br/>
      Extension to the Avipoxvirus genus, in particular fowlpoxvirus (FPV), was targeted for species-specific applications in the poultry industry (ref. 21).
      <br/>
      Studies with a FPV recombinant expressing an immunogen from a mammalian pathogen (the rabies virus glycoprotein G), however, demonstrated the ability of this recombinant to elicit immune responses in a number of non-avian species (ref. 22), thus establishing these viruses as viable candidates for developing non-replicating vector-based vaccine candidates for veterinary and human application.
      <br/>
      The inability of the Avipoxviruses to productively replicate in non-avian species provides an exquisite safety barrier against the occurrence of vaccine-associated and vaccine-induced complications.
    </p>
    <p num="13">
      Subsequent studies with canarypoxvirus (CPV)-based recombinants in non-avian species also demonstrated their utility as immunization vehicles (refs. 23, 24).
      <br/>
      In this regard the canarypoxvirus-based recombinants were found superior to similar FPV recombinants and equivalent to thymidine-kinase mutants of replication-competent vaccinia virus recombinants (refs. 19, 24).
      <br/>
      A plaque-cloned isolate of CPV was derived from the vaccine strain Kanapox and designated ALVAC (ref. 19).
    </p>
    <p num="14">
      ALVAC, like NYVAC, has demonstrated a highly attenuated phenotype in a number of animal systems comparing existing vaccinia virus vaccine strains (ref. 19).
      <br/>
      The Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee has reduced the biological containment for ALVAC to BSL-1.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, ALVAC has been shown to be an effective immunization vehicle in a number of non-avian species including humans (ref. 25).
      <br/>
      The concept of using a non-replicating vector in humans was supported by the results of phase I clinical trials using an ALVAC-based rabies G (ref. 26) and an ALVAC-HIV-1MN env (ref. 27) recombinant.
      <br/>
      In each study, the ALVAC-based recombinant elicited antigen-specific immune responses the heterologous antigen.
      <br/>
      Thus, the use of either ALVAC or NYVAC recombinants expressing the pertinent RSV proteins represents a promising approach for RSV vaccine development.

      The present invention provide a novel immunization strategy to provide protection against disease caused by infection and members of the Paramyxoviridae family, particularly respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and parainfluenza virus (PIV).
      <br/>
      The immunization strategy provided herein leads to a stronger protective immune response than other strategies.
    </p>
    <p num="16">According to one aspect of the invention, there is provided a method of immunizing a host against disease caused by infection by a paramyxoviridae viruses, which comprises:</p>
    <p num="17">

    <heading>GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="28">The present invention relates to methods of immunization comprising administration of a recombinant virus expressing at least one paramyxoviridae virus protein or immunogenic fragment thereof and subsequent administration of at least one protein or fragment thereof of the same protein of the paramyxoviridae virus.</p>
    <p num="29">The recombinant virus vector expressing at least one paramyxoviridae virus protein may itself be unable to confer protection.</p>
    <p num="30">
      In one aspect, the at least one protein may comprise a mixture of RSV proteins such as G glycoprotein, F glycoprotein, M protein and heterodimers and oligomeric forms of the G and G proteins.
      <br/>
      Thus, the subsequent administration may be of a subunit preparation isolated from RSV viral concentrates.
      <br/>
      Referring to FIGS. 1 to 3, there is shown an analysis of a composition of the RSV subunit preparation by SDS-PAGE analysis (FIG. 1) and Western blot (FIGS. 2 and 3).
      <br/>
      A typical composition of the RSV subunit preparation determined by densitometric scanning is:
    </p>
    <p num="31">
      --
      <br/>
      --           G glycoprotein (95 kDa form)     10%
      <br/>
      --           F1 glycoprotein (48 kDa)    30%
      <br/>
      --           M protein (31 kDa)               23%
      <br/>
      --           F2 glycoprotein (23 kDa)    19%
    </p>
    <p num="32">when analyzed under reducing conditions by SDS-PAGE and silver staining.</p>
    <p num="33">
      As described above the primary (priming) immunization may be by administration of a recombinant virus expressing at least one paramyxoviridae virus protein.
      <br/>
      The recombinant virus may be a pox virus modified to contain a gene encoding at least a portion of the paramyxoviridae virus protein such as the RSV F protein.
      <br/>
      The poxvirus may be attenuated for the usually mammalian host by modification of regions of the poxvirus genome necessary for virulence to produce, for example, a NYVAC-F recombinant virus such as vP1000.
      <br/>
      In an alternative embodiment, the poxvirus may be virus such as an avipox virus that does not replicate in mammalian hosts.
      <br/>
      Such a recombinant virus is ALVAC-F, such as vCP181.
    </p>
    <p num="34">
      Recombinant avipox viruses containing the gene encoding the F protein of RSV were constructed and used to immunize mice as shown in Table 1.
      <br/>
      Total anti-F IgG, IgG1 and IgG2 antibodies were measured in murine sera and the results are shown in FIG. 6.
      <br/>
      The sera from animals that were primed with the ALVAC-F recombinant virus and boosted either with the ALVAC-F recombinant virus or the subunit preparation had anti-F IgG1/IgG2a ratios of approximately 1:1.
      <br/>
      This is in contrast to the anti-RSV F IgG1/IgG2a ratios obtained in mice that were primed and boosted with formalin-inactivated RSV (8:1) or subunit vaccine (11:1).
      <br/>
      The induction of IgG2A in mice is indicative of a Th1 immune response.
      <br/>
      The sera of mice primed with the ALVAC-F recombinant virus and boosted with the RSV proteins as a subunit preparation contained high levels of virus neutralizing antibodies as shown by plaque reduction titres (FIG. 7).
      <br/>
      Mice primed with the poxvirus recombinant and then boosted with RSV proteins produced RSV-specific cytotoxic T cells as shown in FIG. 8.
      <br/>
      Of significance is that mice primed with recombinant pox expressing the RSV F protein and boosted with RSV proteins were protected from challenge with live RSV as shown in Table 2.
      <br/>
      In particular, mice primed and boosted with ALVAC-F recombinant virus had detectable virus in their lungs whilst no virus could be detected in the lungs of mice that were primed with ALVAC-F and boosted with RSV proteins or an RSV subunit preparation.
    </p>
    <p num="35">The invention extends to the use of a recombinant virus expressing at least one paramyxoviridae virus protein for primary immunization (priming) of a host and the subsequent use of at least one paramyxoviridae virus protein for boosting said host to protect said host against disease caused by paramyxoviridae.</p>
    <p num="36">
      The vaccines are administered in a manner compatible with the dosage formulation, and in such amount as will be therapeutically effective, immunogenic and protective.
      <br/>
      The quantity to be administered depends on the subject to be treated, including, for example, the capacity of the immune system of the individual to synthesize antibodies, and, if needed, to produce a cell-mediate immune response.
      <br/>
      Precise amounts of active ingredient required to be administered depend on the judgment of the practitioner.
      <br/>
      However, suitable dosage ranges are readily determinable by one skilled in the art and may be of the order of micrograms to milligrams of the proteins or fragments thereof and 105 -109 pfu of the combinant virus.
      <br/>
      The dosage may also depend on the route of administration and will vary according to the size of the host.

      Immunogenicity can be significantly improved if the antigens are co-administered with adjuvants.
      <br/>
      Adjuvants enhance the immunogenicity of an antigen but are not necessarily immunogenic themselves.
      <br/>
      Adjuvants may act by retaining the antigen locally near the site of administration to produce a depot effect facilitating a slow, sustained release of antigen to cells of the immune system.
      <br/>
      Adjuvants can also attract cells of the immune system to an antigen depot and stimulate such cells to elicit immune responses.
    </p>
    <p num="38">
      Immunostimulatory agents or adjuvants have been used for many years to improve the host immune responses to, for example, vaccines.
      <br/>
      Intrinsic adjuvants, such as lipopolysaccharides, normally are the components of the killed or attenuated bacteria used as vaccines.
      <br/>
      Extrinsic adjuvants are immunomodulators which are typically non-covalently linked to antigens and are formulated to enhance the host immune responses.
      <br/>
      Thus, adjuvants have been identified that enhance the immune response to antigens delivered parenterally.
      <br/>
      Some of these adjuvants are toxic, however, and can cause undesirable side-effects, making them unsuitable for use in humans and many animals.
      <br/>
      Indeed, only aluminum hydroxide and aluminum phosphate (collectively commonly referred to as alum) are routinely used as adjuvants in human and veterinary vaccines.
      <br/>
      The efficacy of alum in increasing antibody responses to diphtheria and tetanus toxoids is well established and, more recently, a HBsAg vaccine has been adjuvanted with alum.
      <br/>
      While the usefulness of alum is well established for some applications, it has limitations.
      <br/>
      For example, alum is ineffective for influenza vaccination and usually does not elicit a cell mediated immune response.
      <br/>
      The antibodies elicited by alum-adjuvanted antigens are mainly of the IgG1 isotype in the mouse, which may not be optimal for protection by some vaccinal agents.
    </p>
    <p num="39">
      A wide range of extrinsic adjuvants can provoke potent immune responses to antigens.
      <br/>
      These include aluminum phosphate, aluminum hydroxide, QS21, Quil A, derivatives and components thereof, calcium phosphate, calcium hydroxide, zinc hydroxide, a glycolipid analog, an octodecyl ester of an amino acid, a muramyl dipeptide, polyphosphazene, a lipoprotein, ISCOM matrix, DC-Chol, DDA, and other adjuvants and bacterial toxins, components and derivatives thereof as, for example, described in U.S. application Ser.

      Plasmid pSKF7, containing the coding sequence for the RSV type A fusion glycoprotein (RSV-F), was obtained from Institute Merieux, Lyon, France.
      <br/>
      RSV-F coding sequences, from plasmid pSKF7, were placed under control of a vaccinia virus promoter by joining fragments which had been amplified by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) (ref. 28).
      <br/>
      The modified vaccinia virus early/late H6 promoter (ref. 29), followed by the 5' base pairs of the RSV F gene, was amplified by PCR from plasmid pRW825 containing the H6 promoter sequence oligonucleotide primers RW325 (SEQ ID No: 1) (5'-GATTGAGGATCCTTAATTAATTAGTGATAC-3') and RW326 (SEQ ID No: 2) (5'-TGCATTTGCTTTGAGGATTAGCAACTCCATTACGATACAAACTTA-3') were used in a PCR, with plasmid template pRW825, to generate a 200 bp H6 promoter fragment with the translation initiation codon of the H6 promoter overlapping the RSV F translation initiation codon.
      <br/>
      Oligonucleotide RW325 contains a BamHI site followed by a sequence which primes 5' of the H6 promoter toward the H6 promoter 3' base pairs.

      The resultant PCR, amplified with the primers RW325/RW330, fused the three template fragments into one fragment containing the H6 promoted 5' base pairs of the RSV F gene followed by the 3' base pairs of RSV-F gene.
      <br/>
      Addition of the central RSV-F coding sequences is described below.
      <br/>
      The RW325/RW330 PCR fragment was digested with NruI (with the H6 promoter) and HindIII (3' of RSV-F gene) for insertion between the NruI and HindIII sites of the H6 promoter vector pRW880.

      Immunoblots of replicate gels were prepared and probed with a mouse monoclonal antibody (mAb 5353C75) to F glycoprotein (FIGS. 2a and 3a), or a mouse monoclonal antibody (mAb 131-2G), to G glycoprotein (FIGS. 2b and 3b) or guinea pig anti-serum (gp178) against an RSV M peptide (peptide sequence: LKSKNMLTTVKDLTMKTLNPTHDIIALCEFEN-SEQ ID No: 20) (FIGS. 2c and 3c), or goat anti-serum (Virostat -0605) against whole RSV (FIGS. 2d and 3d).
      <br/>
      Densitometric analysis of the silver-stained gel of RSV subunit preparation electrophoresed under reducing conditions indicated a compositional distribution as follows:
    </p>
    <p num="73">
      G glycoprotein (95 kDa form)=10%
      <br/>
      F1 glycoprotein (48 kDa)=30%
      <br/>
      M protein (31 kDa)=23%
      <br/>
      F2 glycoprotein (23 kDa)=19%
    </p>
    <p num="74">The F glycoprotein migrates under non-reducing conditions as a heterodimer of approximately 70 kDa (F0) as well as higher oligomeric forms (dimers and trimers) (FIG. 3a).</p>
    <p num="75">EXAMPLE 5</p>
    <p num="76">This example describes the immunization of animals by priming with the ALVAC-F recombinant virus and boosting with RSV proteins.</p>
    <p num="77">Pathogen-free BALB/c mice (approximately 8 weeks old; 17 animals per group) were immunized according to the immunization protocol outlined in Table 1.</p>
    <p num="78">
      Animals were bled 4 weeks after the primary inoculation and boosted with the vaccine formulation outlined in Table 1.
      <br/>
      Serum samples were also taken 4 weeks after the booster does.
      <br/>
      The anti-RSV F antibody titres in the sera of mice that were immunized according to the protocol outlined in Table 1 are summarized in FIG. 6.
      <br/>
      With the exception of the control animals, the sera of mice immunized with the various RSV formulations contained had anti-F IgG antibodies.
      <br/>
      The sera from animals that were primed with the ALVAC-F recombinant virus and boosted with either the ALVAC-F recombinant virus or the subunit preparation had anti-F IgG1/IgG2a ratios of approximately 1:1.
      <br/>
      This is in contrast to the anti-RSV F IgG1/IgG2a ratios obtained in mice that were primed and boosted with the alum-adjuvanted FI-RSV (8:1) or subunit vaccine (11:1).
      <br/>
      These results indicate that priming animals with the ALVAC-F recombinant virus results in a balanced anti-RSV F IgG1/IgG2a response and sets the stage for a Th-1 type response.
    </p>
    <p num="79">
      As shown in FIG. 7, the sera of mice that were primed and boosted with the various RSV preparations outlined in Table 1, all had significant levels of RSV-specific neutralizing antibodies.
      <br/>
      The RSV-specific neutralizing antibody titers (13 log2) were significantly higher in animals that were primed with the ALVAC-F recombinant and boosted with the subunit preparation than in mice that were primed and boosted with the ALVAC-F recombinant virus (neutralizing antibody titre 8.8 log2).
      <br/>
      Thus, priming animals with the ALVAC-F recombinant virus not only appears sets the stage for a Th-1 type response but also results in the induction of high titres of RSV-specific neutralizing antibodies after boosting with the alum-adjuvanted RSV subunit vaccine.

      Nunc-MaxiSorp plate wells were coated overnight at room temperature with 2.5 ng of immunoaffinity-purified RSV-F protein diluted in 0.05M carbonate-bicarbonate buffer, pH9.6. Wells were blocked for non-specific binding by adding 0.1% BSA in PBS for 30 min. at room temperature, followed by two washes in a washing buffer of 0.1% BSA in PBS+0.1% Tween 20.
      <br/>
      Serial two or four-fold dilutions of mouse serum was added to the wells.

      The titre was taken as the reciprocal of the last dilution at which the OD was approximately double.
      <br/>
      This OD must be greater that the negative control of the assay at the starting dilution.

      CTL activity was tested 5 to 6 days following re-stimulation.
      <br/>
      On the day of the assay, effector cells were washed twice with fresh medium and viable cell counts were determined by the Trypan blue dye exclusion method.

      BC cells (2 * 106 cells), a BALB/c fibroblast cell line, as well as BCH4 cells (2 * 106 cells), a BALB/c fibroblast T cell line persistently infected with RSV, were pulsed with 200  MU Ci of Sodium 51 chromate (Dupont) for 90 min.
      <br/>
      The targets were washed three times with medium to remove free 51 chromium.
      <br/>
      Viable cell counts of the target cells were determined and target cell suspensions were prepared at 2 * 104 cells/mL.

      Spontaneous and total release of 51 chromium were determined by incubating target cells with either medium or 2.5% Triton X-100 in the absence of responder lymphocytes, respectively.
      <br/>
      Six replicates of each were prepared.
      <br/>
      After 4 hours, plates were centrifuged at 200 * g for 2 min and 100  MU L of supernatant were removed from each well to determine the amount of .vertline. chromium released.

      As shown in FIG. 8, CTLs generated from mice that were primed with ALVAC-F recombinant virus and boosted with the subunit vaccine (.quadrature.), or primed and boosted with the ALVAC-F recombinant virus ( DELTA ) or live mouse adapted virus (.diamond-solid.) lysed BCH4 cells (persistently infected with RSV) at all effector cell dilutions when compared to the lysis of BC (control) cells.
      <br/>
      CTL activity was not observed in animals that were primed and boosted with either the alum-adjuvanted RSV subunit vaccina or FI-RSV, Thus, priming animals with the ALVAC-F vector and boosting them with either the ALVAC-F vector or alum-adjuvanted RSV subunit vaccine induced significant levels of CTL activity.

      In contrast to the placebo control animals (groups 6, 7, 8), the lower respiratory tract of mice that were primed with the ALVAC-F recombinant virus and boosted with the alum-adjuvanted RSV subunit preparation was completely protected against live virus challenge.
      <br/>
      Complete protection was also observed in animals that were immunized with two 1  MU g doses of the alum-adjuvanted subunit vaccine or given live mouse-adapted RSV.
      <br/>
      Boosting ALVAC-F primed animals with the alum-adjuvanted subunit preparation resulted in a more durable protective response.
      <br/>
      It was observed that 3 out of 6 animals that were primed and boosted with the ALVAC-F recombinant virus had low, yet detectable levels of RSV in their lungs.
