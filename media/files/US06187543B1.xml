      Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF ALPHA ) is a potent cytokine that is released from many cell types, particularly, macrophages and monocytes.
      <br/>
      TNF ALPHA  also exists in a cell-membrane bound, higher molecular weight form on cells, and this form also appears to mediate a variety of biological effects.
      <br/>
      TNF ALPHA  is thought to have few roles in normal development and physiology; however, it exerts harmful and destructive effects on many tissues in many disease states (Tracey et al, Ann.
      <br/>
      Rev. Med. 45:491 (1994)).
      <br/>
      Disease states in which TNF ALPHA  has been shown to exert a major pathogenetic role include septic shock syndrome, cancer cachexia, rheumatoid arthritis, etc.
      <br/>
      Many investigators and pharmaceutical companies are actively investigating agents and potential drugs that can block TNF ALPHA  effects, either by blocking its synthesis or interfering with its binding to its surface receptors.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      One example of this approach is the use of monoclonal antibodies to TNF ALPHA .
      <br/>
      These have been used in animal models of human disease, and in human conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis (Arend et al, Arthritis and Rheumatism 38:151 (1995)).
      <br/>
      There is no question that these antibodies temporarily relieve some of the signs and symptoms of this disease in man.
      <br/>
      However, their potential widespread use is compromised by many factors, especially the fact that they seem to be only temporarily (ie, a few months) effective.
      <br/>
      Other drawbacks include expense, the need for parenteral administration, the likelihood that anti-idotype antibodies will develop, etc.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      The present invention relates to a novel approach to the treatment of diseases the effects of which are mediated, at least in part, through TNF ALPHA .
      <br/>
      This approach involves the protein tristetraprolin (TTP) and nucleic acid sequences encoding same.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      TTP (Lai et al, J. Biol. Chem. 265:16556 (1990)), also known as Nup475 (DuBois et al, J. Biol. Chem. 265:19185 (1990)) and TIS11 (Varnum et al, Oncogene 4:119 (1989); Varnum et al, Mol.
      <br/>
      Cell. Biol. 11:1754 (1991)), is a widely distributed 33.6 kDa phosphoprotein encoded by the immediate-early response gene, Zfp-36 (Taylor et al, Nucl.
      <br/>
      Acids Res. 19:3454 (1991)).
      <br/>
      This gene has been mapped to chromosome 7 in the mouse, and the equivalent human gene, ZFP36, has been mapped to chromosome 19q 13.1 (Taylor et al, Nucl.
      <br/>
      Acids Res. 19:3454 (1991)).
      <br/>
      TTP is the prototype of a group of proteins containing two or more highly conserved putative zinc fingers of the CCCH class (Varnum et al, Mol.
      <br/>
      Cell. Biol. 11:1754 (1991); Taylor et al, Nucleic Acids Res. 19:3454 (1991); Gomperts et al, Oncogene 5:1081 (1990); Ma et al, Oncogene 9:3329 (1994)).
      <br/>
      In addition, the protein has been shown to bind Zn++ and has been localized to the cell nucleus in mouse fibroblasts (DuBois et al, J. Biol. Chem. 265:19185 (1990)), suggesting that it may be a transcription factor.
      <br/>
      Serum or other mitogen stimulation of quiescent fibroblasts causes rapid serine phosphorylation and nuclear to cytosolic translocation of TTP (Taylor et al, J. Biol. Chem. 270:13341 (1995); Taylor et al, Mol.
      <br/>
      Endocrinol. 10:140 (1996)), both of which are likely to modulate its function in cells.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      In the adult mouse, TTP mRNA is highly expressed in lung, intestine, lymph node, spleen, and thymus, with lower expression in adipose tissue, kidney, and liver, and negligible expression in skeletal muscle and brain (Lai et al, J. Biol. Chem. 265:16556 (1990); DuBois et al, J. Biol. Chem. 265:19185 (1990)).
      <br/>
      In the thymus, TTP mRNA is highly expressed in both cortical and medullary thymocytes, while in the spleen, it is highly expressed in B and T lymphocytes within the white pulp, and is expressed at somewhat lower levels in the myeloid cells of the red pulp and endothelial cells of the high endothelial venules.
      <br/>
      In addition, TTP is constitutively expressed in several types of blood cells, particularly neutrophils, macrophages and B and T lymphocytes.
      <br/>
      The function of TTP in normal vertebrate physiology, however, was heretofore unknown.

      FIG. 1. Expression of TTP mRNA (a) and protein (B). (a) Total RNA was isolated from the indicated tissues of (+/+), (+/-), and (-/-) mice and subjected to northern blotting with a TTP cDNA probe. Each lane contains 15  MU g of total cellular RNA. The lower band represents endogenous TTP mRNA, whereas the upper band represents the TTP-neo fusion RNA. (b) Primary embryonic fibroblasts were isolated from three different (+/-) (A-C) and three (-/-) (D-F) embryos. The cells were serum-deprived for 14 h, and then exposed to �35 S�-cysteine for 2 h and 20% fetal calf serum for an additional 2 h. Lysates from these cells were used for immunoprecipitation with an antibody that recognizes the amino-terminus of TTP, and the immunoprecipitated proteins were separated on a 9% acrylamide SDS gel and an autoradiograph prepared. The positions of molecular weight standards are indicated. TTP migrates at about 43 kDa. Immunoprecipitated proteins from the same samples were also separated on a 20% acrylamide SDS gel; no truncated amino-terminal TTP fragment was detected in the (-/-) samples.

    <heading>DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="26">
      The present invention results from the realization that TTP regulates effective levels of TNF ALPHA  in animals, eg mammals.
      <br/>
      As indicated above, TNF ALPHA  has been implicated in the pathology of a variety of neoplastic diseases, immune disorders and infections.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, the ability of TTP to regulate TNF ALPHA  levels is of considerable pharmaceutical importance.
    </p>
    <p num="27">
      The identification of this regulatory activity of TTP makes possible methods of screening compounds for their ability to enhance the TNF ALPHA  production-inhibitory activity of TTP, as well as their ability to enhance the effect of TTP on TNF ALPHA  processing and secretion.
      <br/>
      It also makes possible methods of identifying susceptibility to TNF ALPHA -associated diseases, including inflammatory conditions and sepsis.
      <br/>
      Further, the demonstration of TTP as an inhibitor of TNF ALPHA  production, processing or secretion makes possible new modes of therapy for diseases or disorders mediated by or exacerbated by TNF ALPHA .
    </p>
    <p num="28">It will be appreciated that the preferred subject of the invention is a human, however veterinary uses are also contemplated.</p>
    <p num="29">Compound Screens</p>
    <p num="30">
      The natural ability of TTP to inhibit cellular production, processing or secretion of TNF ALPHA  permits the screening of test compounds for their ability to enhance this inhibitory effect.
      <br/>
      Using appropriate screens, compounds can be identified that potentiate the ability of TTP to inhibit TNF ALPHA  production, processing or secretion, independent of the mechanism by which this inhibition occurs.
    </p>
    <p num="31">
      In one example of a screening system of the invention, a host cell is cotransfected with a vector encoding TTP and a vector containing the TNF ALPHA  gene, for example, operably linked to a reporter gene.
      <br/>
      Examples of commonly used reporter genes include chloramphenicol acyltransferase (CAT), alkaline phosphatase, luciferase, growth hormone, thymidine kinase, etc.
      <br/>
      Potential host cells include fibroblasts, HeLa cells, and macrophage and lymphocyte cells lines.
      <br/>
      Transfection can be effected using art-recognized techniques.
    </p>
    <p num="32">
      Using this type of system, test compounds can be assayed for their ability to shift the TTP dose response curve to the left, that is, to decrease the dose at which TTP inhibits TNF ALPHA  production (or processing or secretion) as measured, for example, by the reporter expression.
      <br/>
      Compounds identified as being capable of enhancing (directly or indirectly) the TTP inhibitory activity can then be further assayed, using standard protocols, for stability, toxicity etc.
    </p>
    <p num="33">
      While the foregoing screen can be used to assay test compounds for their ability to decrease the dose at which TTP inhibits TNF ALPHA  production (or processing or secretion), various other screens can be devised based on the mechanism by which TTP exerts it inhibitory effect.
      <br/>
      For example, if TTP inhibits TNF ALPHA  gene transcription, then a screen can be used in which sequences within the TNF ALPHA  gene promoter are linked to a reporter gene.
      <br/>
      Such constructs can be used in cell transcription studies or cell-free transcription assays in the presence or absence of TTP and the test compound.
      <br/>
      Similarly, if TTP inhibits TNF ALPHA  mRNA translation, test compounds can be added, for example, to cell-free translation assays in the presence or absence of TTP and TNF ALPHA  mRNA.
      <br/>
      The rate of synthesis of the TNF ALPHA  protein can then be determined.
      <br/>
      Other screens can also be used, dependent on the biochemical site of action of TTP (eg gene transcription, mRNA translation, protein processing or protein secretion).
    </p>
    <p num="34">
      Examples I-V below describe an animal model of TTP deficiency produced using gene targeting in murine embryonic stem cells.
      <br/>
      The resulting mice, while appearing normal at birth, develop a phenotype consistent with whole body TNF ALPHA  excess.
      <br/>
      This animal model (as well as other such TTP-deficient animal (eg mammalian) models) can be used to screen and/or test agents for their ability to prevent/treat the effects of excess TNF ALPHA .
      <br/>
      The test agent can be administered to the model animal (eg orally or by injection) in accordance with standard test protocols and the effects on animal growth and phenotype monitored.
      <br/>
      Compounds that prevent the development of one or more aspects of the phenotype of TTP-deficient animals can then be further tested for pharmaceutical acceptability using standard protocols.
    </p>
    <p num="35">Detection/Diagnosis</p>
    <p num="36">
      The TTP deficiency produced in Examples I-V causes a severe syndrome of wasting and arthritis that is often lethal.
      <br/>
      Partial deficiencies resulting from the production of mutant forms of TTP, while perhaps non-lethal, can be expected to increase susceptibility to TNF ALPHA  associated diseases and disorders, including infections, and autoimmune disorders (likewise, heterozygosity).
      <br/>
      The availability of the amino acid sequence of TTP (eg the human TTP sequence, Taylor et al, Nucl.
      <br/>
      Acids Res. 19:3454 (1991)) and its encoding sequence (eg GenBank accession number M63625) makes possible methods of identifying and diagnosing individuals at increased risk, for example, for inflammatory conditions or sepsis following infection.
    </p>
    <p num="37">
      General mutation screening of the TTP gene to identify subjects at increased risk can be performed by such methods as direct sequencing of cDNAs from candidate patients.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, approaches based on the cytogenetic mapping of the human gene to chromosome 19 q 13.1 (Taylor et al, Nucl.
      <br/>
      Acids Res. 19:3454 (1991)) can be used.
      <br/>
      For example, sequences from the human cDNA or genomic DNA can be used to locate the TTP gene (ZFP36) on a physical map of chromosome 19 (see, for example, Garcia et al, Genomics 27:52 (1995)).
      <br/>
      One or more polymorphic loci in the immediate vicinity of the gene can then be identified.
      <br/>
      Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) primers, for example, can be used to screen genomic DNA from populations (eg members of multiple families with rheumatoid arthritis) for polymorphisms closely linked to the TTP gene.
      <br/>
      Direct DNA sequencing of genomic DNA from likely candidate patients can then be accomplished using, for example, PCR sequencing strategies.
    </p>
    <p num="38">
      In an alternative approach, a biological sample can be obtained from a subject suspected of being at increased risk and the sample examined for the presence of a mutated form of TPP.
      <br/>
      Biological samples suitable for use in this regard include blood cells and transformed cell lines derived therefrom, lung lavage fluid, ascites fluid, etc.
      <br/>
      Tissue samples can also be used, including samples from liver, kidney intestine, spleen, lymph nodes, etc.
      <br/>
      Detection of a mutant form of the protein can be effected by isolating the protein from the sample and determining its amino acid sequence or by contacting the protein (in purified or semi-purified form) with a binding partner (eg an anti-wild type TTP antibody or TNF ALPHA  promoter sequence) and determining whether complexation occurs.
      <br/>
      Complexation (or lack thereof) can be established using any of a variety of art recognized techniques (eg use of a labeled binding partner, use of a binding partner bound to a solid support, etc).
      <br/>
      Mutant forms of the protein can be expected to have altered (eg decreased) affinity for the binding partner.
      <br/>
      In addition, abnormalities in the size, charge or relative amount of the protein identified, for example, by means of a binding partner (such as an antibody) indicate a mutation in the TTP gene.
      <br/>
      Mutations can be confirmed by routine sequencing of the gene.
    </p>
    <p num="39">The identification of mutant forms TTP or its encoding sequence makes possible the identification of subjects likely to benefit from increased monitoring or therapeutic intervention.</p>
    <p num="40">Therapy</p>
    <p num="41">
      The present invention contemplates the use in gene therapy regimens of DNA sequences encoding TTP or portions thereof encoding TNF ALPHA  production (processing or secretion)-inhibiting polypeptides.
      <br/>
      The encoding sequences can be present in a construct which, when introduced into target cells, results in expression of the TTP encoding sequences and thus production of the TNF ALPHA  production (processing or secretion)-inhibitor.
    </p>
    <p num="42">For gene therapy to be practical, it is desirable to employ a DNA transfer method that: (1) directs the therapeutic sequence into specific target cell types (2) is highly efficient in mediating uptake of the therapeutic polynucleotide into the target cell population, and (3) is suited for use ex vivo or in vivo for therapeutic application.</p>
    <p num="43">
      Delivery of the TTP gene (or portion thereof encoding a TNF ALPHA  production (processing or secretion)-inhibitor polypeptide) can be effected using any of a variety of methodologies.
      <br/>
      Presently available methodologies include transfection with a viral vector (eg retroviral vector or adenoviral vector) and fusion with a lipid.
      <br/>
      Other techniques are also available, many employing selectable markers to improve transfection efficiency.
      <br/>
      The technique selected depends upon the particular situation.
    </p>
    <p num="44">
      Retroviral vectors can be used to effect high efficiency gene transfer into replicating cells and such vectors are particularly suitable for use where target cells are present in a body compartment, such as brain and liver or epithelial surfaces such as lung, bladder or colon.
      <br/>
      Adenovirus vectors are advantageous from the standpoint that they have the potential to carry larger insert polynucleotide sequences than retroviral vectors and they have the ability to infect non-replicating cells.
      <br/>
      Further, they are suitable for infecting tissues in situ, especially in the lung.
      <br/>
      Adenoassociated viruses, which integrate, can also be used, as can other viral systems depending on the target site, including hepatitis virus when liver is the target tissue.
      <br/>
      Consistent with this approach, TTP sequences can be transfected into autologous bone marrow progenitor or stem cells, and those cells can then be transplanted back into the original donor, for example, after selection for cells expressing the transfected TTP sequences.
      <br/>
      Similar approaches are contemplated in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (Chernajorsky et al, Brit.
      <br/>
      Med. Bull. 51:503 (1995); Kiem et al, Curr.
      <br/>
      Opin. Oncol. 7:107 (1995)). (See also Morgan and Anderson, Annu.
      <br/>
      Rev. Biochem. 62:191 (1993) and Mulligan, Science 260:926 (1993) for further details relating to use of viral vectors for gene therapy.)
    </p>
    <p num="45">
      Another gene transfer method suitable for use in the present invention is the physical transfer of plasmid DNA in liposomes directly into target cells.
      <br/>
      Liposome-mediated DNA transfer has been described by various investigators (Liu et al, Gene Therapy 1:7 (1994); Huxley, Gene Therapy 1:7 (1994); Miller and Vile, FASEB J. 9:190 (1995)).
    </p>
    <p num="46">
      Essentially any suitable DNA delivery method can be used in the context of the present invention.
      <br/>
      Ex vivo transfection using viral vectors, however, may be preferred in certain settings.
      <br/>
      Use of the TTP gene truncated at the 3' untranslated region may serve to make the mRNA more stable.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, a TTP cDNA operably linked to a cell specific promoter can be used.
      <br/>
      In any case, transfection of hematopoietic marrow progenitors or stem cells ex vivo and reintroduction by bone marrow transplantation can be effected.
    </p>
    <p num="47">
      The nucleic acid-containing compositions of the invention can be stored and administered in a sterile physiologically acceptable carrier.
      <br/>
      The nucleic acid can be present in combination with any agent which aids in the introduction of the DNA into cells.
    </p>
    <p num="48">
      Various sterile solutions may be used for administration of the composition, including water, PBS, etc.
      <br/>
      The concentration of the DNA will be sufficient to provide a therapeutic dose.
    </p>
    <p num="49">Actual delivery of the gene sequence, formulated as described above, can be carried out by a variety of techniques including direct injection, administration to the lung and other epithelial surfaces, intravenous injection and other physical methods.</p>
    <p num="50">
      The present invention also contemplates the use of TTP, and TNF ALPHA  production (processing or secretion)-inhibitor polypeptide fragments thereof, as a pharmaceutical agent to effect suppression of TNF ALPHA  biosynthesis, processing or secretion.
      <br/>
      Polypeptides can be made using commonly used and widely available techniques for the synthesis of synthetic peptides.

      A TTP insertion targeting vector was created by first isolating a 3.8 kb Zfp-36 (TTP genomic) clone from a SV129 library (Stratagene, La Jolla, Calif.) using a mouse TTP cDNA probe (Lai et al, J. Biol. Chem. 265:16556 (1990)); this fragment was cloned into the SalI site of BS+ (Stratagene).
      <br/>
      A 1.14 kb XhoI-BamHI neo fragment from pMC1Po1A (Stratagene) was then ligated into the TTP SstI site (1 kb downstream of the initiator ATG) in pBS+/TTP.
      <br/>
      Next, a 4.9 kb SalI TTP-neo fragment from pBS+/TTP-neo was cloned into the SalI site of pSP73 (Promega, Madison, Wis.), into which two thymidine kinase genes (ClaI-BamHI and HindIII-XhoI fragments of pIC19R/MC1-TK) (Mansour et al, Nature 336:348 (1988)) had been cloned previously at the pSP73 ClaI-BamHI and HindIII-XhoI sites.
      <br/>
      This targeting vector was linearized with HindIII and electroporated into ES cells, which were then used to generate chimeric mice according to established methods (Koller et al, Proc.

    <p num="81">Generation of TTP (-/-) Mice</p>
    <p num="82">
      A targeting vector was constructed that contained 3.8 kb of the gene encoding TTP, Zfp-36 (Taylor et al, Nucl.
      <br/>
      Acids Res. 19:3454 (1991)), in which a neomycin resistance gene (neo) was inserted into the protein-coding portion of the second exon.
      <br/>
      Insertion of this sequence introduced multiple stop codons upstream of the sequences encoding the two putative zinc fingers, precluding synthesis of functional TTP protein.
      <br/>
      Using this targeting vector and established experimental methods (Koller and Smithies, Proc.
      <br/>
      Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 86:8932 (1989)), TTP-deficient mice were generated.
      <br/>
      Among the first 492 offspring of heterozygous (+/-) crosses, 126 (26%) were homozygous wild-type (+/+), 267 (54%) were heterozygous (+/-), and 99 (20%) were homozygous null (-/-), indicating that there was no substantial embryonic lethality associated with the (-/-) genotype.
    </p>
    <p num="83">
      Northern analysis of tissues from (+/-) mice revealed that the endogenous TTP mRNA signal was decreased by about 50%, and that a TTP/neo fusion mRNA had been generated (FIG. 1a).
      <br/>
      No endogenous TTP mRNA was detected in tissues from a (-/-) mouse, but the TTP/neo fusion mRNA signal was increased over that seen in the +/- mice.
      <br/>
      Because the neo portion of the TTP/neo fusion mRNA contains many termination codons, a complete TTP/neo translation product should not be made; however, translation of an amino-terminal TTP fragment could have occurred.
      <br/>
      To test this possibility, primary embryonic fibroblasts were generated from both (+/-) and (-/-) embryos, and immunoprecipitations were performed on lysates from these cells, using an antibody (Taylor et al, J. Biol. Chem. 270:13341 (1995)) directed at the amino-terminus of TTP (FIG. 1b).
      <br/>
      Although TTP was readily detectable in (+/-) cells, neither intact TTP nor a truncated amino-terminal TTP fragment could be detected in the (-/-) cells (FIG. 1b).

      This failure of weight gain and eventual cachexia was one of the most striking characteristics of the phenotype, and occurred in essentially all of the mice to varying degrees (FIG. 2).
      <br/>
      They also developed patchy alopecia, dermatitis, arthritis, and conjunctivitis.
      <br/>
      Although all (-/-) mice eventually developed the syndrome, the degree to which they were affected was variable. 34% (of 56) were severely affected and died before reaching seven months of age.
      <br/>
      The remaining (-/-) mice were less severely affected, but nevertheless, 68% (of 37) displayed dermatitis, 88% arthritis, and 72% conjunctivitis by seven months of age.

      Survival of a (-/-) mouse was 16 months or more.
    </p>
    <p num="87">
      Histological examination of the (-/-) mice demonstrated several characteristic abnormalities.
      <br/>
      In the calavarial skin of seven-month old littermate mice, there was orthokeratotic hyperkeratosis in many areas, with an infiltration of neutrophils in the epidermis, and marked acanthosis.
      <br/>
      There was also diffuse inflammation in the underlying dermis, characterized by accumulation of many neutrophils and fewer lymphocytes, plasma cells, and macrophages.
      <br/>
      The inflammatory infiltrates extended to the deep dermal margins of the tissue, and in some cases, to the underlying skeletal muscle.
      <br/>
      Large numbers of Gr-1+ neutrophils were present in both the epidermis and the dermis, while small foci of CD3+, TCR ALPHA  BETA +, and Thy1.2+ lymphocytes, 75% of which were of the CD4+ subset, were also present in the dermis.
      <br/>
      A striking finding was that subcutaneous fat was essentially absent as was mesenteric and epididymal fat.
    </p>
    <p num="88">
      The epidermis of the eyelid was also thickened, was the palpebral conjunctiva.
      <br/>
      Neutrophils infiltrated the dermis beneath both the eyelid and the conjunctiva.
      <br/>
      In addition, there were relatively few mucous cells along the surface of the conjunctiva in the -/- mice.
    </p>
    <p num="89">
      In most joints in both the front and rear paws of the (-/-) mice at seven months of age, the synovium was markedly inflamed and thickened, with proliferating synovial cells extending well into the joint spaces; the synovium contained many Mac-1+ macrophages and fewer Gr-1+ neutrophils, CD3+, TCR ALPHA  BETA +, and Thy1.2+ lymphocytes and plasma cells.
      <br/>
      In addition, there was apparent proliferation of synovial cells and pannus formation, which in some cases completely separated apposing joint surfaces.
      <br/>
      Erosion of articular cartilage by pannus and extensive bone destruction were common.
      <br/>
      The marrow cavities were densely filled with cells of the myeloid lineage, especially mature neutrophils, and there was marked osteolysis of the inner aspect of the cortical bones.
    </p>
    <p num="90">
      Several abnormalities were also noted in the hematopoietic systems of the (-/-) mice.
      <br/>
      Thymuses in adult (-/-) mice were hypoplastic and showed no cortical/medullary organization; the thymuses of four days post-pactum (-/-) mice were decreased in size by an average of 50%.
      <br/>
      Spleens of the (-/-) mice were enlarged by an average of 41%, and there was extensive splenic myeloid hyperplasia, with many metamyelocyte, bands, and segmented neutrophils present.
      <br/>
      The perirenal, submaxillary, and mesenteric lymph nodes were also often enlarged, again showing extensive extramedullary hematopoiesis, primarily granulopoiesis.
      <br/>
      There was a marked increase in the number of myeloid cells in the bone marrow, which appeared nearly white in contrast to the red marrow of the control animals.
      <br/>
      Essentially all of the marrow myeloid cells were strongly Gr-1+. Although the cellular architecture of the liver appeared normal in (-/-) mice, foci of necrotizing hepatitis were present that contained a mixed inflammatory exudate of neutrophils, macrophages, and lymphocytes.
      <br/>
      There was also an inflammatory abscess in the interventricular septum of one mouse.
    </p>
    <p num="91">
      Because antinuclear antibodies were present (see below), the kidneys were examined histologically by staining with hematoxylin and eosin, periodic acid Schiff (PAS), and Congo red, and immunologically, for the presence and absence of IgG and IgM.
      <br/>
      The tubular and interstitial architecture was essentially normal in the kidneys from the -/- mice, but the glomeruli manifested increased cellularity and increased PAS-positive mesangial matrix.
      <br/>
      There was also focal, segmental thickening of peripheral capillary loops, which were congested with erythrocytes.
      <br/>
      IgG and IgM staining of glomeruli were similar in the kidneys from the +/+ and -/- mice.

      The marrow myeloid cells were karyotypically normal, suggesting that they had not undergone malignant transformation.

      The peripheral red blood cell count, hemoglobin, hematocrit, and platelet count were within normal ranges; however, the Ter119+ erythroid cells in bone marrow were decreased in percentage by about two-fold, presumably secondary to the massive increase of myeloid cells in the bone marrow.
    </p>
    <p num="94">
      Assays of hematopoietic progenitor cells per organ were performed on cells from spleen, bone marrow and peripheral blood of young (age 33 days) and older (6.5 to 12 months) mice.
      <br/>
      In the young mice, absolute numbers of granulocyte-macrophage progenitors (CFU-GM) from -/- mouse bone marrow were increased approximately two-fold compared to control (+/+ (n=3): 30.8+/-3.6 * 103 /femur (mean +- SEM); -/- (n=3): 64.3+/-0.5 * 103 /femur, p&lt;0.0025 using Student's t test) whereas CFU-GM from spleen and peripheral blood were unchanged.
      <br/>
      Erythroid (BFU-E) and multipotential (CFU-GEMM) progenitors per spleen, femur and ml of peripheral blood were not significantly different (p&gt;0.05) in the young -/- and +/+ mice.
      <br/>
      In the older mice, there were marked increases in myeloid progenitors (CFU-GM, BFU-E and CFU-GEMM) in spleen and peripheral blood but not bone marrow from the -/- compared to +/+ mice.
      <br/>
      Comparative progenitor cell values  * 103 per spleen (-/- vs. +/+) were 145 +- 50 vs. 6 +- 5 for CFU-GM, 115 +- 51 vs. 7 +- 4 for BFU-E and 10 +- 4 vs. 0.2 +- 2 for CFU-GEMM.
      <br/>
      Comparative values per ml of blood were 1530 +- 781 vs. 46 +- 39 for CFR-GM, 417 +- 273 vs. 30 +- 27 for BFU-E and 62 +- 32 vs. 4 +- 4 for CFU-GEMM.
      <br/>
      Colonies from young or old -/- or +/+ mice did not form in vitro without addition of growth factors and no obvious differences in sensitivity of progenitor cells to stimulation of proliferation by single or multiple cytokines was apparent with bone marrow cells from -/- vs. +/+ mice.
    </p>
    <p num="95">Routine serum chemistries, including glucose, were within normal limits in the (-/-) mice, except for slightly decreased albumin and increases total serum globulin and  BETA -globulin levels.</p>
    <heading>EXAMPLE IV</heading>
    <p num="96">Autoantibodies</p>
    <p num="97">
      Rheumatoid factors (both IgG and IgM) and anti-Sm antibody titers were repeatedly normal in sera from the -/- mice.
      <br/>
      However, 3/4 of the sera from the -/- mice expressed high titers of antinuclear antibodies, with a homogenous pattern; these antibodies were not detected in 4/4 sera from the +/+ animals.
      <br/>
      The -/- sera (but not the +/+ sera) also contained antibodies to double-stranded DNA (mean+/- SEM of ELISA units from four -/- mice was 0.41+/-0.18 compared to 0.06+/-0.02 from four +/+ mice; p=0.11 by Student's t test).
      <br/>
      This finding was confirmed by the Crithidia assay (4/4 -/- mice were positive, compared to 0/4 +/+ mice).
      <br/>
      Finally, sera from the -/- mice (but not from the +/+ mice) contained high titers of antibodies to single stranded DNA (mean+/- SEM ELISA units from four -/- mice was 1.49+/-0.30 compared to 0.22+/-0.05 from four +/+mice; p=0.006 by Student's t test).

    <p num="98">TNF ALPHA  Antibody Treatment</p>
    <p num="99">
      Because the phenotype of the TTP-deficient mice resembled that produced by chronic administration of TNF ALPHA  (Keffer et al, EMBO J. 10:4025 (1991); Ulich et al, Res.
      <br/>
      Immunol. 144:347 (1993)), an attempt was made to prevent the development of the phenotype by treating the mice beginning at 10 days of age with nine weekly intraperitoneal injections of a hamster monoclonal antibody (TN3-19.12) that is specific for mouse TNF ALPHA  (Sheehan et al, J. Immunol. 142:3884 (1989)).
      <br/>
      This antibody was originally thought to cross-react with TNF BETA  (Sheehan et al, J. Immunol. 142:3884 (1989)); however, subsequent work has shown that it does not neutralize the biological activity of this cytokine (R. D. Schreiber, personal communication).
      <br/>
      Four of six TTP -/- mice injected with PBS exhibited striking growth retardation, and one exhibited mild growth retardation (FIG. 4A).
      <br/>
      The sixth PBS-injected mouse died before growth retardation could become obvious (FIG. 4B); two others died before completion of the trial (FIG. 4).
      <br/>
      Three PBS-injected mice survived the trial, but were strikingly smaller than their wild-type littermates (FIG. 4).
      <br/>
      In contrast, five of six mice injected with the TNF ALPHA  antibody maintained essentially identical growth curves to those of their +/+ and +/- littermates (FIG. 4), whereas one exhibited slight growth retardation (FIG. 8B).
      <br/>
      The mean body weights of the six TTP -/- mice receiving the TNF ALPHA  antibody were in the middle of the normal range throughout the trial, whereas the mean weights of those receiving PBS were significantly (p&lt;0.001) lower than those receiving antibody at all time points after week 4 (FIG. 4H).
    </p>
    <p num="100">
      The antibody-injected mice also developed none of the cutaneous or joint stigmata associated with the -/- syndrome.
      <br/>
      In addition, the -/- mice injected with TNF ALPHA  antibodies did not display medullary myeloid hyperplasia, with marrow from these animals containing 33.7 +- 3.1% (SEM) mature granulocytes and bands, compared to 30.4 +- 3.0% for the wild-type animals (p=0.49).
      <br/>
      Every examined aspect of the TTP-deficient phenotype has been essentially normalized by the injection of TNF ALPHA  antibody.
