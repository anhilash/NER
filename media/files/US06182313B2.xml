      The present invention relates to therapeutic head cradle apparatus intended to support the back, front or side of head to apply acupressure and shiatsu to portions of the head resulting from contact with the head cradle.
      <br/>
      The head cradle can be used in a prone body or inclined body position.
      <br/>
      Elastomeric cushion covers lateral support members of the head cradle to provide self-massage when the head is rolled side to side.
    </p>
    <p num="3">2. State of the Art</p>
    <p num="4">
      The benefits of Acupressure, Shiatsu and Chinese self-massage to relieve stress, tension, insomnia, headaches, anxiety and other symptoms is well documented in the literature.
      <br/>
      Acupressue deals with the application of pressure to certain meridian points on the body to relieve pain.
      <br/>
      The human body has fourteen meridians that carry energy throughout the body according to James Roy Holliday, III in his "Guide to Acupressure" on the internet.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      The meridians start at the fingertips, connect to the brain, and then connect to the organ associated with the specific meridian.
      <br/>
      Acupressue is applied locally to a small area of the body at pressure points using the thumb, finger, knuckle or probes.
      <br/>
      Thirty-two pressure point areas are given by James Roy Holliday, III where five areas are located about the head.
      <br/>
      One pair is found on either side of the head where the spine meets the skull.
      <br/>
      A second pair is found on the back of the jawbone just below the ear.
      <br/>
      The third pair is located on the cheek, next to the outside of the nostril.
      <br/>
      A fourth and fifth pair are located among the eyebrows.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      Michael Reed Gach in the book "Acupressure's Potent Points--A Guide to Self-Care for Common Ailments", Bantam Books, New York, 1990, deals with the application of self-acupressure to common pressure points and other areas of the body to treat common ailments.
      <br/>
      The present invention provides a head cradle that permits the application of acupressure at all five pressure points as the head and body are moved into back, side and frontal contact with the head cradle.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      Shiatsu is similar to acupressure in that pressure is applied to the pressure points on the meridian but over a larger surface area.
      <br/>
      Shiatsu is commonly applied with the palm, elbow, knee, and foot.
      <br/>
      Often a holding technique is used to maintain pressure for a longer period of time.
      <br/>
      Shiatsu combines pressure and stretching techniques to stimulate the circulation and flow of lymphatic fluid to release toxins and release tensions according to the internet address http://Holisticonline.com. Benefits include reduced stress and fatigue, increased circulation of blood and lymph fluids, reduced blood pressure and less muscle stiffness.
      <br/>
      Ryokyn Endo in the book "Tao Shiatsu-Life Medicine for the Twenty-First Century", Japan Publications, Inc., Toyoko and New York, 1995, page 62 describes the basic techniques using the palm, heel of the hand and other pressure application methods of Shiatsu.
      <br/>
      He describes the importance of continuous steady pressure for Shiatsu on page 79.
      <br/>
      The present invention can provide pressure to the head over surface areas larger than the pressure points for a combined application of Shiatsu and Acupressure.
      <br/>
      Stretching techniques can be added as optional for more complete Shiatsu benefits.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      The technique and benefits of self-massage are described by Fan Ya-Li in "Chinese Self-Massage Therapy--The Easy Way to Health", Blue Poppy Press, Boulder, Colo., 1997. Chapter 2 deals with self-massage of the head, face, eyes, nose and ears for treating symptoms of eye related problems, ear health, neck pain and headache.
      <br/>
      The present invention allows self-massage of the head areas when the head is rolled side to side on elastomeric cushions.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      Pillows are generally used to support the weight of the head over the largest area possible to reduce pressure and avoid "lumps" which result in localized high pressure discomfort.
      <br/>
      A variety of head and neck supports appear in the art to provide improved support, align the head or provide acupressure to the back of the head.

    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="16">
      The present invention relates to a cradle apparatus configured to support the head in several head orientations as determined by back, side or frontal positions of the body.
      <br/>
      The most effective use of the head cradle for therapeutic benefits occurs in the prone body positions.
      <br/>
      However, the head cradle can also be effective as a headrest with the body inclined such as in a seated position with the cradle placed between the head and seat back.
    </p>
    <p num="17">
      In the preferred embodiment, the head cradle is composed of two lateral support members oriented generally in-line with the body and constructed of round tubular polymeric rigid material.
      <br/>
      Each lateral support member is covered with two layers of flexible elastomeric material as a cushion means.
      <br/>
      Each layer has a different density where the outer layer is softer and less firm than the inner layer.
      <br/>
      This combination provides a softer tactile feel to the skin while maintaining sufficient spring to apply acupressure and shiatsu pressure.
      <br/>
      Further, this combination of dual density cushion layers provides a means for Chinese self-massage when the head is rolled side to side.
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      The two lateral supports are connected by a tubular transverse support member that is threaded into each lateral support member.
      <br/>
      To adjust the distance between the pair of lateral supports, one lateral support is rotated relative to the other when the same thread hand is used as a means for adjustment.
      <br/>
      Alternately, a left hand and right hand thread combination would allow an alternate means for adjustment by turning the transverse support member.
      <br/>
      Of course, other means for adjustment mechanism may also be used.
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      The head cradle is placed upon a comfortable prone surface, such as a bed, with the transverse support member extended beyond the head with the lateral support members in general alignment with the prone body.
      <br/>
      With the body laying upon the back, the head will be supported solely by contact with the pair of lateral support members.
      <br/>
      The neck is free to self-align without pressure from a neck support.
      <br/>
      In this position, the lateral supports apply acupressure to the pair of pressure points at the base of the skull and shiatsu pressure is applied to the back of the head, both resulting from the weight of the head being localized upon the contact area of the head cradle.
      <br/>
      These pressure points relate to fear control, lightheadedness, nasal congestion, nosebleed and headache according to James Roy Holliday, III.
      <br/>
      The shiatsu pressure on the back of the head will reduce stress and fatigue according to Michael Reed Gach.
    </p>
    <p num="20">
      With the body on it's side, the side of the head is then supported by the pair of lateral supports wherein one lateral support member can apply acupressure to the pressure point behind the ear.
      <br/>
      Acupressure at this pressure point is helpful with Lumbago according to James Roy Holliday, III.
      <br/>
      The shiatsu pressure supplied by the second lateral support member can reduce insomnia to encourage sleep according to Michael Reed Gach.
    </p>
    <p num="21">
      With the body frontal to the bed surface, several positions are available for the head on the head cradle.
      <br/>
      With the head fully face down, the lateral support members exert acupressure upon the pressure points in the eyebrow area.
      <br/>
      These pressure points can be used to relieve some of the symptoms of cold and influenza, sinus problems, sneezing, allergies, eye discomfort and general backache according to James Roy Holliday, III.
      <br/>
      With the head at an angle to the bed surface, one lateral support member can be used to apply acupressure to the pressure point along side the nose while the other lateral support member supports the side of the head with shiatsu pressure.
      <br/>
      Application of acupressure to these pressure points is considered to be helpful with sinus problems, nasal congestion, colds and influenza according to James Roy Holliday, III.
      <br/>
      Shiatsu pressure applied to the side of the head is helpful with insomnia and encourages sleep according to Michael Reed Gach.
    </p>
    <p num="22">In an alternate embodiment, the lateral support members can have triangular shaped cross sections as well as other irregular shapes.</p>
    <p num="23">
      In another alternate embodiment, a pillow is inserted between the head and the lateral support members.
      <br/>
      The pillow will soften the acupressure and shiatsu pressure to permit longer contact time with the head cradle.
      <br/>
      Benefits occur over a longer period of time.
    </p>
    <p num="24">
      In another embodiment, a second transverse member connects the free ends of the lateral support members for a more rigid framework.
      <br/>
      Each traverse support member has a left hand and right hand thread as means for adjustment, allowing the transverse members to be rotated to adjust the predetermined distance between the lateral support members.
      <br/>
      At least one of the transverse support members is covered with a cushion material for neck support.
    </p>
    <p num="25">
      In another embodiment, magnets are inserted within the tubular lateral support members to provide magnetic therapy as well as acupressure, shiatsu and self-massage for additional benefits.
      <br/>
      The magnets can be permanent magnets or electrically controlled as means for magnetic therapy.
    </p>
    <p num="26">
      In yet another embodiment, a stereo sound system can be added with speakers or vibrators inserted within the lateral side supports and a sound generator placed in the transverse support member as means for sound therapy as well as acupressure, shiatsu and self-massage benefits.
      <br/>
      The means for sound therapy can produce vibrations that can also be felt by the user.
    </p>
    <p num="27">
      In summary, the head cradle offers the user the benefits of both acupressure and shiatsu as applied to the head pressure points by the head cradle lateral support members.
      <br/>
      Since the lateral supports and transverse support compose a rigid structure, pressure is maintained to localized areas of the head until the user changes position of the head.
      <br/>
      The elastomeric material covering the lateral support members allow self-massage of the contact areas by rotating the head to transfer the weight of the head from one to the other lateral support members in a cyclic manner.
      <br/>
      Prior art apparatus for acupressure does not address all five pressure points of the head combined with benefits from shiatsu pressure and Chinese self-massage.

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE EMBODIMENTS</heading>
    <p num="29">
      Referring to the drawings in detail, lateral support members 20,22 are shown in FIGS. 1 and 2 having round tubular cross sections and are positioned generally side by side spaced by predetermined distance 10.
      <br/>
      One end of each lateral support member 20,22 is connected to elbows 21,23 which are connected by transverse support member 24, collectively forming a U-shape.
      <br/>
      Transverse support member 24 is round with threads 17,19 as a means for adjustment at each end which thread into elbows 21,23.
      <br/>
      Predetermined distance 10 may be changed by rotating one lateral support member 20 relative to the other lateral support member 22 when threads 17,19 are the same thread hand.
      <br/>
      When threads 17 and 19 are opposite hand threads, transverse support member 24 may be rotated to change predetermined distance 10 as an alternate means for adjustment.
      <br/>
      Of course it is understood that other means for adjustment may also be used such as telescoping members with locking device (not shown).
    </p>
    <p num="30">
      Lateral support members 20,22 are covered with an inner cushion layer 30,32 of elastomeric material and outer cushion layer 26,28 of a different density elastomeric material.
      <br/>
      Outer cushions 26,28 are softer and compress with less force than inner cushions 30,32.
      <br/>
      Non-elastomeric cushions could also be used but would be less effective for rolling the head side to side for Chinese massage.
    </p>
    <p num="31">
      The head cradle of FIGS. 1 and 2 is shown in FIG. 3 oriented in-line with the prone body of the user.
      <br/>
      Cushions 26 and 28 contact the back of the head to support the weight.
      <br/>
      FIG. 4 shows the head cradle of FIGS. 1 and 2 being used as a head rest with the body inclined at angle 9.
    </p>
    <p num="32">
      FIG. 5 shows the different head positions A-E for the preferred embodiment of FIG. 2.
      <br/>
      Head position A has the back of the head in acupressure contact with lateral support members 20,22 at the first pair of pressure points 1.
      <br/>
      Head position B shows lateral support members 20 and 22 in shiatou pressure contact with the temple 2 and the side 6 of the head.
      <br/>
      Head position C has lateral support member 20 in acupressure contact with the second pressure point 3 behind the ear and lateral support member 22 in shiatsu pressure contact with the rear portion 7 of the head.
      <br/>
      Head position D has the head in a frontal posture where the lateral support members 20 and 22 provide acupressure to the forth pressure point area 4 in the middle eyebrow.
      <br/>
      Head position E has the head angled with the side of the nose and eyebrow in contact 5 with lateral support member 20.
      <br/>
      Acupressure is applied to the third pressure point at the side of the nose and to the fourth pressure point at the inner eyebrow.
      <br/>
      Lateral support member 22 is in shiatsu contact 8 with the temple of the head.
      <br/>
      In all of these head positions A-E, the head may be rolled side to side to vary the contact time for any pressure point to apply Chinese massage.
    </p>
    <p num="33">
      FIG. 6 shows pillow 46 inserted between the head and cushions 26,26 which cover lateral support members 20,22 for head position A. The pillow may be used for any head position A-E which tends to provide shiatsu pressure allowing longer contact time.
      <br/>
      A pillow may be used with only one lateral support 20 or 22.
    </p>
    <p num="34">
      An alternate embodiment is shown in FIG. 7 where triangular elastomeric cushions 34,36 cover lateral supports 20,22.
      <br/>
      A combination of round 26 and triangular 36 cushion shapes may also be used.
    </p>
    <p num="35">
      Another alternate embodiment is shown in FIG. 8 having rectangular lateral support members 25,27 covered with irregular shaped cushions 29,31.
      <br/>
      It is understood that other shapes for cushions and lateral support members in various combinations may also be used effectively.

      The improvement of the present invention over prior art lies in the versatility of the head cradle to administer acupressure contact with all five of the pressure point areas of the head depending upon head placement on the cradle.
      <br/>
      Shiatsu pressure is also applied to pressure points as well as to other areas of the head.
      <br/>
      Rolling the head side to side to alternately deform the elastomeric cushions provides Chinese massage.
      <br/>
      The adjustment means allows the lateral support members to be positioned at a preferred distance by the user.
