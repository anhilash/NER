      Peptides having general and specific binding affinities for the Src homology region 3 (SH3) domains of proteins are disclosed in the present invention.
      <br/>
      In particular, SH3 binding peptides have been isolated from phage-displayed random peptide libraries which had been screened for isolates that bind to bacterial fusion proteins having an SH3 domain and glutathione S-transferase (GST).
      <br/>
      Preferred peptides are disclosed which comprise a core 7-mer sequence (preferably, a consensus motif) and two or more, preferably at least six, additional amino acid residues flanking the core sequence, for a total length of 9, preferably at least 13, amino acid residues and no more than about 45 amino acid residues.
      <br/>
      Such peptides manifest preferential binding affinities for certain SH3 domains.
      <br/>
      The preferred peptides exhibit specific binding affinities for the Src-family of proteins.
      <br/>
      In vitro and in vivo results are presented which demonstrate the biochemical activity of such peptides.

    <p num="2">1. FIELD OF THE INVENTION</p>
    <p num="3">
      The present invention relates to SH3 binding peptides having a broad range of binding specificities.
      <br/>
      That is, certain members of the SH3 binding peptides disclosed bind with approximately the same facility with SH3 domains derived from different SH3 domain-containing proteins.
      <br/>
      Other members, in contrast, bind with a much greater degree of affinity for specific SH3 domains.
      <br/>
      The SH3 binding peptides are obtained from random peptide libraries that are also phage-displayed.
      <br/>
      Methods are described of obtaining the phage clones that bind to the SH3 domain targets and of determining their relevant nucleotide sequences and consequent primary amino acid sequence of the binding peptides.
      <br/>
      The resulting SH3 binding proteins are useful in a number of ways, including, but not limited to, providing a method of modulating signal transduction pathways at the cellular level, of modulating oncogenic protein activity or of providing lead compounds for development of drugs with the ability to modulate broad classes, as well as specific classes, of proteins involved in signal transduction.
    </p>
    <p num="4">2. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</p>
    <p num="5">2.1. Src and the SH3 Domain</p>
    <p num="6">
      Among a number of proteins involved in eukaryotic cell signaling, there is a common sequence motif called the SH3 domain.
      <br/>
      It is 50-70 amino acids in length, moderately conserved in primary structure, and can be present from one to several times in a large number of proteins involved in signal transduction and in cytoskeletal proteins.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      The protein pp60c-src represents a family of at least nine non-receptor protein tyrosine kinases (NR-PTKs).
      <br/>
      Members of this family share an overall structural organization comprising a series of catalytic and non-catalytic domains.
      <br/>
      In Src, a 14-amino-acid myristylation signal resides at the extreme amino-terminus, and is followed by a unique region that is not highly conserved among family members.
      <br/>
      Following this region are two highly conserved 60- and 100-amino-acid regions, the Src homology (SH) domains 3 and 2, respectively.
      <br/>
      SH2 and SH3 domains have been shown to play an important role in mediating protein-protein interactions in a variety of signaling pathways.
      <br/>
      Koch, C. A., et al., in Science (1991) 252:668-74.
      <br/>
      The carboxy-terminal half of Src contains the PTK catalytic domain, as well as a negative regulatory tyrosine (Y527) near the carboxy terminus.
      <br/>
      Phosphorylation of this residue (e.g., by Csk) results in the inhibition of PTK activity.
      <br/>
      Cooper, J. A., et al., in Science (1986) 231:1431-1434.
      <br/>
      Mutation of Y527 --&gt; F generates forms of Src with increased PTK and oncogenic activity.
      <br/>
      Cartwright, C. A., et al., in Cell (1987) 49:83-91; Kmiecik, T. E., et al., in Cell (1987) 49:65-73; and Piwicna-Worms, H., et al., in Cell (1987) 75-82.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      The fact that some mutations which result in increased Src PTK and transforming activity map to the Src SH2 (Seidel-Dugan, C., et al., in Mol. Cell. Biol. (1992) 12:1835-45; and Hirai, H. and Varmus, H. E. in Mol. Cell. Biol. (1990) 10:1307-1318) and SH3 domains (Seidel-Dugan, C., et al., supra; Hirai, H. and Varmus, H. E., supra; Superti-Furga, G., et al., in Embo. J. (1993) 12:2625-34; and Potts, W. M., et al., in Oncogene Res. (1988) 3:343-355) suggests a negative regulatory role for these domains.
      <br/>
      That phosphotyrosine residues within specific sequence contexts represent high affinity ligands for SH2 domains suggests a model in which the SH2 domain participates in Y527-mediated inhibition of PTK activity by binding phosphorylated Y527, thereby locking the kinase domain in an inactive configuration.
      <br/>
      Matsuda, M., Mayer, B. J., et al., in Science (1990) 248:1537-1539.
      <br/>
      This model is supported by the observation that phosphopeptides corresponding to the carboxy-terminal tail of Src bind active, but not inactive, variants of Src.

    </p>
    <p num="9">
      The mechanism of SH3-mediated inhibition of Src PTK activity remains unclear.
      <br/>
      There is evidence that pY527-mediated inhibition of Src PTK activity involves the SH3 domain as well as the SH2 domain.
      <br/>
      Okada, M., Howell, et al., in J. Biol. Chem. (1993) 268:18070-5; Murphy, S. M., et al., in Mol. Cell. Biol. (1993) 13:5290-300; and Superti-Furga, G., et al., supra.
      <br/>
      Although these effects are thought to be a consequence of SH3-mediated protein-protein interactions, precisely how the Src SH3 domain exerts its negative regulatory effect is unclear.
      <br/>
      Identification of high affinity ligands for the Src SH3 domain could help resolve these issues.

    <p num="10">2.2. Protein Tyrosine Kinases and the Immune Response</p>
    <p num="11">
      Src-related tyrosine kinases are expressed in a variety of cell types including those of the immune system (lymphocytes, T cells, B cells, and natural killer cells) and the central nervous system (neural cells, neurons, oligodendrocytes, parts of the cerebellum, and the like).

      <br/>
      Mol. Brain Res. (1992) Dec. 16(3-4):303-310.
      <br/>
      Their presence in these cells and tissues and their interaction with specific cell surface receptors and immunomodulatory proteins (such as T cell antigen receptor, CD14, CD2, CD4, CD40 or CD45) suggest that these kinases serve an important role in the signalling pathways of not only the central nervous system but of the immune system, as well.
      <br/>
      See, e.g., Ren, C. L. et al., in J. Exp. Med. (1994) 179(2):673-680 (signal transduction via CD40 involves activation of Lyn kinase); Donovan, J. A. and Koretzky, G. A., in J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. (1993) 4(4):976-985 (CD45, the immune response, and regulation of Lck and Fyn kinases); and Carmo, A. M. et al., in Eur. J. Immunol. (1993) 23(9):2196-2201 (physical association of the cytoplasmic domain of CD2 with p56lck and p59fyn).
    </p>
    <p num="12">
      For instance, mice with disruptions in their Src-like genes, Hck and Fgr, possess macrophages with impaired phagocytic activity or exhibit a novel immunodeficiency characterized by an increased susceptibility to infection with Listeria monocytogenes.
      <br/>
      Lowell, C. A. et al., in Genes Dev. (1994) 8(4):387-398. Also, it has been shown that bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) activates CD14-associated p56lyn, p68hck, and p59c-fgr, while inducing the production of lymphokines, such as TNF-alpha, IL-1, IL-6, and IL-8.
      <br/>
      Inhibition of the protein tyrosine kinases blocks production of TNF-alpha and IL-1.
    </p>
    <p num="13">2.3. SH3 Binding Peptides</p>
    <p num="14">
      As mentioned above, it has long been suspected that SH3 domains are sites of protein-protein interaction, but it has been unclear what SH3 domains actually bind.
      <br/>
      Efforts to identify ligands for SH3 domains have led to the characterization of a number of SH3-binding proteins, including 3BP1 and 2 (Ren, R., Mayer, et al., in Science (1993) 259:1157-61), SOS (Olivier, J. P., et al., in Cell (1993) 73:179-91; and Rozakis-Adcock, M., et al., in Nature (1993) 363:83-5), p85 PI-3' Kinase (Xingquan, L., et al., in Mol. Cell. Biol. (1993) 13:5225-5232), dynamin (Gout, I., et al., in Cell (1993) 75:25-36), AFAP-110 (Flynn, D. C., et al., in Mol. Cell. Biol. (1993) 13:7892-7900), and CD42 (Barfod, E. T., et al., in J. Biol. Chem. (1993) 268:26059-26062).
      <br/>
      These proteins tend to possess short, proline-rich stretches of amino acids, some of which have been directly implicated in SH3 binding.
      <br/>
      A variety of consensus sequences have been proposed, although the similarity among proline-rich regions of different SH3-binding proteins tends to be fairly low.
      <br/>
      Also, attempts to build consensus sequences are likely complicated by the incorporation of data from proteins that bind different SH3 domains.
    </p>
    <p num="15">
      Thus, Cicchetti, P., et al., in Science (1992) 257:803-806, published their work relating to the isolation and sequencing of two naturally-occurring proteins that could be bound in vitro by the SH3 domain of the abl oncogene product.
      <br/>
      These workers found that SH3 domains bind short, proline-rich regions of such proteins.
      <br/>
      Subsequently, this same group disclosed further results (Ren, R. et al., supra) in which the SH3 binding sites of the SH3 binding proteins were localized to "a nine- or ten-amino acid stretch rich in proline residues." A consensus sequence incorporating the features of the SH3 binding sites of four SH3 binding proteins was proposed: XPXXPPP.Yen.XP (SEQ ID NO:1), wherein X indicates a position in the amino acid sequence which is not conserved among the four SH3 binding proteins, P represents proline, and .Yen. indicates a hydrophobic amino acid residue, such as P or L.

    <p num="16">The screening of complex random peptide libraries has been used to identify peptide epitopes for monoclonal (Scott, J. K. and Smith, G. P. in Science (1990) 249:386-390) and polyclonal (Kay, B. K., et al., in Gene (1993) 128:59-65) antibodies, as well as peptide ligands for a variety of proteins, including streptavidin (Devlin, J. J., et al., in Science (1990) 249:404-406; and Lam, K., et al., in Nature (1991) 354:82-84), the endoplasmic reticulum chaperone BiP (Blond-Elguindi, S., et al., in Cell (1993) 75:717-728), and CaM (Dedman, J. R., et al., in J. Biol. Chem. (1993) 268:23025-23030).</p>
    <p num="17">
      Recently, Chen, J. K. et al., in J. Am. Chem. Soc. (1993) 115:12591-12592, described ligands for the SH3 domain of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI-3' Kinase) which were isolated from a biased combinatorial library.

      A "biased" library is to be distinguished from a "random" library in that the amino acid residue at certain positions of the synthetic peptide are fixed, i.e., not allowed to vary in a random fashion.
      <br/>
      Indeed, as stated by these research workers, screening of a "random" combinatorial library failed to yield suitable ligands for a PI-3' Kinase SH3 domain probe.
      <br/>
      The binding affinities of these unsuitable ligands was described as weak, &gt;100  MU M, based on dissociation constants measured by the Biosensor System (BIAcore).
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      More recently, Yu, et al. (Yu, H., et al., in Cell (1994) 76:933-945) used a "biased" synthetic peptide library of the form XXXPPXPXX (SEQ ID NO:2), wherein X represents any amino acid other than cysteine, to identify a series of peptides which bind the Src and PI-3' Kinase SH3 domains.
      <br/>
      The bias was accomplished by fixing the proline residues at the specific amino acid positions indicated for the "random" peptide.
      <br/>
      As stated previously, without this bias, the technique disclosed fails to identify any SH3 domain-binding peptides.
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      A consensus sequence, based on 13 binding peptides was suggested: RXLPPRPXX (SEQ ID NO:3), where X tends to be a basic residue (like R, K or H).
      <br/>
      The binding affinities of several SH3 binding peptides were disclosed as ranging from 8.7 to 30  MU M. A "composite" peptide, RKLPPRPRR (SEQ ID NO:4), was reported to have a binding affinity of 7.6  MU M. This value compares favorably to the binding affinity of the peptide, VPPPVPPRRR (SEQ ID NO:5), to the N-terminal SH3 domain of Grb2.
      <br/>
      See, Kraulis, P. J. J. Appl. Crystallogr. (1991) 24:946.
      <br/>
      Recognizing the limitations of their technique, Chen and co-workers, supra, stated that their results "illustrate the utility of biased combinatorial libraries for ligand discovery in systems where there is some general knowledge of the ligand-binding characteristics of the receptor" (emphasis added).
    </p>
    <p num="20">
      Yu and co-workers, supra, further described an SH3 binding site consensus sequence, Xp.O slashed.PpXP (SEQ ID NO:6), wherein X represents non-conserved residues, .O slashed. represents hydrophobic residues, P is proline, and p represents residues that tend to be proline.
      <br/>
      A consensus motif of RXLPPRPXX (SEQ ID NO:7), where X represents any amino acid other than cysteine, was proposed for ligands of PI-3' Kinase SH3 domain.
      <br/>
      A consensus motif of RXLPPLPR PHI  (SEQ ID NO:8), where  PHI  represents hydrophobic residues, was proposed for ligands of Src SH3 domain.
      <br/>
      Still, the dissociation constants reported for the 9-mer peptides ranged only from about 8-70  MU M and selectivity between one type of SH3 domain and another was relatively poor, the KD s differing by only about a factor of four.
    </p>
    <p num="21">
      Hence, there remains a need to develop techniques for the identification of Src SH3 binding peptides which do not rely on such "biased" combinatorial peptide libraries that are limited to a partially predetermined set of amino acid sequences.
      <br/>
      Indeed, the isolation of SH3 binding peptides from a "random" peptide library has not been achieved successfully before now.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, particular peptides having much greater binding affinities, whether general or more selective binding for specific SH3 domains, remain to be identified.
      <br/>
      Binding peptides specific for particular SH3 domains are useful, for example, in modulating the activity of a particular SH3 domain-containing protein, while leaving others bearing an SH3 domain unaffected.
      <br/>
      Still, the more promiscuous general binding peptides are useful for the modulation of a broad spectrum of SH3 domain-containing proteins.
    </p>
    <p num="22">
      The present invention relates to such SH3 binding peptides, methods for their identification, and compositions comprising same.
      <br/>
      In particular, peptides comprising particular sequences of amino acid residues are disclosed which were isolated from random peptide libraries.
      <br/>
      In the present invention, clones were isolated from a phage-displayed random peptide library which exhibited strong binding affinities for SH3 domain-containing protein targets.
      <br/>
      Some of these protein targets, include Abl, Src, Grb2, PLC- DELTA , PLC- GAMMA , Ras GAP, Nck, and p85 PI-3' Kinase.
      <br/>
      From the nucleotide sequence of the binding phage, the amino acid sequence of the peptide inserts has been deduced.
      <br/>
      Synthetic peptides having the desired amino acid sequences are shown to bind the SH3 domain of the target proteins.
      <br/>
      In particular, synthetic peptides combining a core consensus sequence and additional amino acid residues flanking the core sequence are especially effective at binding to particular target protein SH3 domains.
      <br/>
      The SH3 binding peptides disclosed herein can be utilized in a number of ways, including the potential modulation of oncogenic protein activity in vivo.
      <br/>
      These peptides also serve as useful leads in the production of peptidomimetic drugs that modulate a large class of proteins involved in signal transduction pathways and oncogenesis.
    </p>
    <p num="23">3. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</p>
    <p num="24">
      Accordingly, three phage-displayed random peptide libraries were screened for isolates that bind to bacterial fusion proteins consisting of the Src homology region 3 (SH3) and glutathione S-transferase (GST).
      <br/>
      DNA sequencing of the isolates showed that they contained sequences that resemble the consensus motif, RPLPPLP (SEQ ID NO:9), within their 8, 22, or 36 amino acid long random regions.
      <br/>
      When peptides were synthesized corresponding to the pIII inserts of the SH3-binding phage, they bound to the GST fusions of the SH3 domains of Src and the Src-related proteins, such as Yes, but not of Grb2, Crk, Abl, or PLC GAMMA 1.
      <br/>
      The synthesized peptides bind quite well to the Src SH3 domain and act as potent competitors of natural Src SH3 interactions in cell lysates.
      <br/>
      For instance, these peptides can compete with radiolabelled proteins from cell lysates in binding to immobilized Src-GST, with an apparent IC50 of 1-10  MU M. When a peptide, bearing the consensus sequence RPLPPLP (SEQ ID NO:9) was injected into Xenopus laevis oocytes, it accelerated the rate of progesterone-induced maturation.
      <br/>
      These results demonstrate the utility of phage-displayed random peptide libraries in identifying SH3-binding peptide sequences and that such identified peptides exhibit both in vivo and in vitro biological activity.
    </p>
    <p num="25">
      Thus, it is an object of the present invention to provide peptides having at least nine and up to forty-five amino acid residues, including an amino acid sequence of the formula, R-2-L-P-5-6-P-8-9 (SEQ ID NO:10), positioned anywhere along the peptide, in which each number represents an amino acid residue, such that 2 represents any amino acid residue except cysteine, 5 and 6 each represents a hydrophobic amino acid residue, 8 represents any amino acid residue except cysteine, and 9 represents a hydrophilic amino acid residue except cysteine, each letter being the standard one-letter symbol for the corresponding amino acid, said peptide exhibiting a binding affinity for the SH3 domain of Src, provided that said peptide is not R-P-L-P-P-L-P-T-S (SEQ ID NO:11).
      <br/>
      In a particular embodiment of the present invention, the peptides also exhibit a binding affinity for the SH3 domain of Src-related proteins, including Yes, Fyn, Lyn, Lck, Hck and Fgr.
    </p>
    <p num="26">

      <br/>
      Furthermore, peptides are also provided which further comprise an N-terminal-flanking amino acid sequence of the formula 1', 2'-1', 3'-2'-1' or 4'-3'-2'-1' (SEQ ID NO:14) in which each number represents any amino acid residue except cysteine, such that 1' is bound to R by a peptide bond.

    <p num="28">
      The present invention also seeks to provide new consensus sequences or motifs that reflect variations in SH3 domain binding selectivities or specificities.
      <br/>
      The present invention also contemplates conjugates of the SH3 binding peptides and a second molecule or chemical moiety.
      <br/>
      This second molecule may be any desired substance whose delivery to the region of the SH3 domain of a particular protein (or cell containing the protein) is sought.

      <br/>
      FIG. 4 illustrates the possible origin of one class of double-insert R8C recombinants (e.g., encoding SEQ ID NO:36). Double-stranded oligonucleotides (e.g., SEQ ID NO:37) may have ligated in a head-to-head fashion at the Xba I site prior to cloning in the Xho I-Xba I cleaved M13 vector.

      <br/>
      FIG. 6 graphically illustrates the relative binding affinities of selected phage clones for various SH3 domains. The results indicate that certain amino acid sequences provide generic SH3 domain binding, while others can provide greater selectivity for the SH3 domain of Src. Still other clones exhibit Src SH3 domain preferential binding.
      <br/>
      FIG. 7 shows the binding of synthetic peptides (SEQ ID NOS:9 and 62-70) representing Src SH3-selected phage inserts to Src SH3-GST fusion target (shaded columns) over background GST binding (unshaded columns) relative to the core peptide RPLPPLP (SEQ ID NO:9) and proline-rich peptide segments derived from naturally occurring proteins.

In particular, the binding affinities of the peptides for the SH3 domains of the following protein fusion targets were tested: Src SH3-GST, Yes SH3-GST, Grb2-GST, Crk SH3-GST, Abl SH3-GST, PLC GAMMA 1 SH2SH3-GST. Bound biotinylated peptide was detected with streptavidin-alkaline phosphatase. Each point was performed in triplicate; values are average signal (absorbance at 405 nm) above GST background, with error bars representing standard deviation. Hatched bars indicate saturation of the ELISA signal. SEQ ID NOS:62-70 are shown in order from top to bottom except that RPLPPLP is SEQ ID NO:9.

      <br/>
      FIG. 10 presents a graph illustrating the increased rate of progesterone-induced maturation of oocytes injected with an SH3 domain-binding peptide, VLKRPLPIPPVTR (SEQ ID NO:64), of the present invention. Briefly, Stage VI oocytes were prepared and injected as previously described (see, Kay, B. K., in Methods in Cell Biol. (1991) 36:663-669). Oocytes were injected with 40 nL of 100  MU M test peptide or water. After injection, the oocytes were placed in 2  MU g/mL progesterone (Sigma, St. Louis, Mo.) and scored hourly for germinal vesicle breakdown (GVBD). LAPPKPPLPEGEV is SEQ ID NO:70.

    <p num="37">5.1. General Considerations</p>
    <p num="38">
      The present invention relates to peptides that exhibit a binding affinity for an SH3 domain, which domain has been found to be present in a number of physiologically significant proteins.
      <br/>
      In particular, peptides are disclosed which exhibit general binding characteristics to the SH3 domains found in a group of proteins, including but not limited to Abl, Src, Grb2, PLC- DELTA , PLC- GAMMA , Ras GAP, Nck, and p85 PI-3' Kinase.
      <br/>
      Preferred peptides exhibit selective, if not specific, binding affinity for the SH3 domain of Src.
      <br/>
      As described herein, the peptides of the present invention include a core sequence, preferably a consensus sequence, and additional amino acid residues that flank the core sequence.
      <br/>
      These peptides, including the methods for their identification, are described in greater detail, below.
    </p>
    <p num="39">
      Thus, in a specific embodiment of the invention, peptides are provided which have at least nine and up to about forty-five amino acid residues, including an amino acid sequence resembling the formula,
      <br/>
      R-2-L-P-5-6-P-8-9   (SEQ ID NO:10),
    </p>
    <p num="40">
      positioned anywhere along the peptide.
      <br/>
      In the above-mentioned formula, each number represents an amino acid residue, such that 2 represents any amino acid residue except cysteine, 5 and 6 each represents a hydrophobic amino acid residue, 8 represents any amino acid residue except cysteine, and 9 represents a hydrophilic amino acid residue except cysteine.
      <br/>
      Each letter used in the formulas herein represent the standard one-letter symbol for the corresponding amino acid.
      <br/>
      When the peptide is a 9-mer, the peptide R-P-L-P-P-L-P-T-S (SEQ ID NO:1l) is excluded.
      <br/>
      The peptides of particular interest are those that exhibit a binding affinity for the SH3 domain of Src and Src-related proteins, including Yes, Fyn, Lyn, Lck, Hck and Fgr.
      <br/>
      Preferably, the peptides of the invention exhibit a binding affinity for the SH3 domain of Src, which is at least three-fold, more preferably at least four-fold, most preferably at least about five-fold greater than that exhibited by the peptide RPLPPLP (SEQ ID NO:9).
      <br/>
      In still other embodiments, the peptides exhibit a binding affinity for the SH3 domain of Src which is at least ten-fold greater than that exhibited by the peptide RPLPPLP (SEQ ID NO:9).
    </p>
    <p num="41">
      In specific embodiments, peptides are disclosed in which the various amino acid residues at the indicated positions may independently have the following preferred identities: 2 is a P, R, A, L, Q, E or S, more preferably P or R; 5 represents a P, M, I or L, more preferably P or M; 6 is a P, L, I or V, more preferably P or L; 8 is a T, R, P, I, N, E, V, S, A, G or L, more preferably T or R; and 9 is a T, R, S, H or D, more preferably T or R. Despite the preference for hydrophobic amino acid residues at 5 and 6, in some cases it may be desirable to have hydrophilic amino acid residues at these positions.
      <br/>
      Specifically, amino acid residue 5 may be a T, R or S, and amino acid residue 6 may be a T or R. Likewise, while a hydrophilic amino acid residue is preferred at position 9, in some instances a hydrophobic residue, such as a P or A, may be desirable.
    </p>
    <p num="42">
      The present invention also contemplates SH3 domain-binding peptides with a minimum length of 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 or more amino acids.. Such peptides contain additional amino acid residues flanking the core sequence of R-2-L-P-5-6-P (SEQ ID NO:71) either at the C-terminal end, the N-terminal end or both.
      <br/>
      Thus, for example, such peptides include those that further comprise a C-terminal-flanking amino acid sequence of the formula 10, 10-11, 10-11-12, 10-11-12-13 (SEQ ID NO:12) or 10-11-12-13-14 (SEQ ID NO:13), in which each number represents any amino acid residue except cysteine, such that the amino acid residue 10 is bound to the amino acid residue 9 by a peptide bond.
      <br/>
      In that case, specific embodiments include an amino acid residue 10 which is T, R, L, S, D, P, A or N, preferably T or R, an amino acid residue 11 which is R, P, A, Q, S or T, preferably R or P, an amino acid residue 12 which is P, S, R or T, preferably P or S, an amino acid residue 13 which is P, S, R, F, H or T, preferably P or S, and an amino acid residue 14 which is S, R, G or T, preferably, S or R.
    </p>
    <p num="43">
      Furthermore, peptides are also provided which further comprise an N-terminal-flanking amino acid sequence of the formula 1', 2'-1', 3'-2'-1' or 4'-3'-2'-1' (SEQ ID NO:14) in which each number represents any amino acid residue except cysteine, such that 1' is bound to R by a peptide bond.
      <br/>
      In such a case, specific embodiments are provided in which the amino acid residue 1' is T, P, S, N, F, W, K, H, Q or G, preferably T or P, wherein the amino acid residue 2' is S, T, G, P, R, Q, L, A or H, preferably S or T, wherein the amino acid residue 3' is R, S, P, G, A, V, Y or L, preferably S or T, and wherein the amino acid residue 4' is R, S, V, T, G, L or F, preferably R or S.
    </p>
    <p num="44">
      In a particular embodiment, a peptide is disclosed having at least thirteen and up to forty-five amino acid residues, including an amino acid sequence of the formula, 3'-2'-1'-R-2-L-P-5-6-P-8-9-10 (SEQ ID NO:15), positioned anywhere along the peptide, in which each number represents an amino acid residue, such that 3', 2', 1', 2, 8, and 10 each represents any amino acid residue except cysteine, 5 and 6 each represents a hydrophobic amino acid residue, and 9 represents a hydrophilic amino acid residue except cysteine, each letter being the standard one-letter symbol for the corresponding amino acid, said peptide exhibiting a binding affinity for the SH3 domain of Src.
      <br/>
      Preferred 13-mers include, but are not limited to, those having an amino acid residue 5 which is a P or M, an amino acid residue 1' which is T, P, S or N, an amino acid residue 2' which is S or T, an amino acid residue 3' which is R or S, and an amino acid residue 10 which is T or R. In all the SH3 domain-binding peptides described herein, the prohibition against the use of the hydrophilic amino acid residue cysteine (C) does not extend beyond the 7-mer "core" sequence and the additional amino acid residues flanking the core up to a total (core+flanking) of about 20 amino acids.
      <br/>
      That is, the occasional use of a cysteine is not absolutely prohibited.
      <br/>
      What should be kept in mind is that the potential for the formation of intramolecular disulfide bonds, to form a cyclic structure, be minimized as much as possible.
      <br/>
      Applicants have found that cyclized structures appear to be disfavored, at least with potential binding peptides of less than about 15 amino acid residues in length.
      <br/>
      The concern for the formation of cyclized structures comprising the core sequence diminishes with increasing size of the peptide.
      <br/>
      Presumably, a large enough structure, though cyclic, may allow the critical core sequence to adopt a more or less linear conformation.

      Phage clones are also disclosed, along with the amino acid sequences that are responsible for SH3 domain binding.

      These phage clones are identified in FIG. 5.

    <p num="47">In other embodiments of the present invention, SH3 domain-binding peptides are contemplated which have a total of 11, 13, 14, 18, 20, 22, 23, 25, 30, 36, 38 or 45 amino acid residues.</p>

    <p num="49">
      The SH3 binding peptides exhibit a wide range of biological activity which includes the enhancement (or inhibition, depending on the particular peptide or the nature of the peptide's target molecule, in this case a protein bearing an SH3 domain) of the natural function or biological activity of the peptide's target molecule.
      <br/>
      For example, the interaction of the binding peptide of the present invention could result in the modulation of the oncogenic activity of the target molecule bearing the SH3 domain.
      <br/>
      If the target molecule has, in turn, a natural binding partner or ligand, the peptides of the present invention may also exhibit antagonistic or agonistic activity in relation to the biological activity of the natural binding partner.

      The intensity of the immune response can thus be stimulated, for example, by the increased production of certain lymphokines, such as TNF-alpha and interleukin-1.

      As is generally known to those of ordinary skill in the art, a more intense immune response may be in order in certain conditions, such as in combating a particularly tenacious infection, viral or otherwise, or a malignancy.

      Furthermore, in a specific embodiment of the present invention, a conjugate compound is contemplated which comprises the peptide of the present invention and a second chemical moiety.
      <br/>
      The second chemical moiety can be selected from a wide variety of chemical compounds including the peptide itself.
      <br/>
      Typically, however, the second chemical moiety is selected to be other than the peptide of the present invention, including but not limited to an amino acid, a peptide other than an SH3 binding peptide of the present invention, a polypeptide or protein (i.e., the conjugate is a fusion protein), a nucleic acid, a nucleoside, a glycosidic residue (i.e., any sugar or carbohydrate), a label or image-enhancing agent (including metals, isotopes, radioisotopes, chromophores, fluorophores (such as FITC, TRITC, and the like), and enzyme substrates), a drug (including synthetic, semisynthetic, and naturally-occurring compounds), small molecules (e.g., biotin, hormones, factors) and the like.
    </p>
    <p num="52">
      The peptide of the present invention can be conjugated to the second chemical moiety either directly (e.g., through appropriate functional groups, such as an amine or carboxylic acid group to form, for example, an amine, imine, amide, ester, acyl or other carbon-carbon bond) or indirectly through the intermediacy of a linker group (e.g., an aliphatic or aromatic polyhydroxy, polyamine, polycarboxylic acid, polyolefin or appropriate combinations thereof).
      <br/>
      Moreover, the term "conjugate," as used herein, is also meant to encompass non-covalent interactions, including but not limited to ionic, affinity or other complexation interactions.

    <p num="53">
      As described further herein, the peptides of the present invention have been shown to localize within certain cellular compartments which contain Src or Src-related proteins.

      It should also be pointed out that the present invention seeks to provide a recombinant construct comprising a nucleic acid or its complement that includes codons or nucleotide sequences encoding a peptide having a region that binds to an SH3 domain, preferably the Src SH3 domain.

      The recombinant nucleic acid may be a DNA or RNA polynucleotide.

      In a specific embodiment, the present invention contemplates a recombinant construct which is a transforming vector.

      Such vectors include those well known to those of ordinary skill in the art, which effect the transfer or expression of the nucleotide sequence after introduction to a host, such as recombinant plasmid, phage or yeast artificial chromosome.
      <br/>
      These vectors may be closed circular loops or they may be linearized.

      The vectors contemplated include those that exist extrachromosomally after host transformation or transfection, as well as those that integrate within or even displace portions of the host chromosome.

      The vectors may be introduced to the cell with the help of transfection aids or techniques well-known in the art.

      In addition, the present invention contemplates the direct introduction of the desired nucleic acid to the host cell, for instance, by injection.

    </p>
    <p num="62">5.2. Preparation of Random Peptide Libraries</p>
    <p num="63">
      The preparation and characterization of the preferred phage-displayed random peptide libraries have been described elsewhere.
      <br/>
      See, for example, Kay, B. K. et al. in Gene (1992) 128:59-65, for a description of the preparation of the phage-displayed random peptide library known as TSAR-9, more below.
      <br/>
      In particular, by cloning degenerate oligonucleotides of fixed length into bacteriophage vectors, recombinant libraries of random peptides can be generated which are expressed at the amino-terminus of the pIII protein on the surface of M13 viral particles. (There are 3-5 copies of the pIII-fusion on the surface of each particle.) Phage display offers several conveniences: first, the expressed peptides are on the surface of the viral particles and accessible for interactions; second, the recombinant viral particles are stable (i.e., can be frozen, exposed to pH extremes); third, the viruses can be amplified; and fourth, each viral particle contains the DNA encoding the recombinant genome.
      <br/>
      Consequently, these libraries can be screened by isolating viral particles that bind to targets.
      <br/>
      The isolates can be grown up overnight, and the displayed peptide sequence responsible for binding can be deduced by DNA sequencing.
    </p>
    <p num="64">
      These libraries have approximately &gt;108 different recombinants, and nucleotide sequencing of the inserts suggests that the expressed peptides are indeed random in amino acid sequence.
      <br/>
      These libraries are referred to herein as TSAR libraries, where TSAR stands for Totally Synthetic Affinity Reagents.
      <br/>
      The preparation of the TSAR libraries are described further below.
    </p>
    <p num="65">5.3. SH3 Binding Clones and their Characteristics</p>
    <p num="66">
      Accordingly, peptides have been isolated from an unconstrained random peptide library which exhibit a binding affinity for SH3 domains.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, the binding affinities exhibited by the disclosed peptides differ in their selectivities with certain peptides showing comparable binding affinities for SH3 domains derived from different proteins, while others manifest greater affinities for specific SH3 domains.
    </p>
    <p num="67">
      The amino acid sequence of various peptides isolated by the present method are listed in FIG. 5.
      <br/>
      As can be seen from this list, certain groups of SH3 domain binding peptides are isolated from three separate random peptide libraries, each based on a different type of random peptide insert, all displayed at the amino-terminus of the pIII protein on the surface of M13 viral particles.
      <br/>
      Ten clones were isolated from the R8C library, seven from the TSAR-12 library, and seven from the TSAR-9 library.
      <br/>
      The sequences are presented to highlight the particular amino acid residues believed to bind directly to the SH3 domain, as well as to point out the remaining amino acid residues of the random insert and the viral flanking sequences and complementary site amino acid residues common to each group of clones.
      <br/>
      The frequency with which each particular clone is found in each library is also indicated in FIG. 5.
      <br/>
      Thus, clones T12.SRC3.1 and T12.SRC3.2 are by far the most abundant clones found among the three libraries.
    </p>
    <p num="68">
      Interestingly, all the binding peptides are found to have the proline-rich amino acid residue motif, which is apparently responsible for binding, the motif being located predominantly at the C-terminal end of the insert, although each clone also contains an insert at the N-terminal end.
      <br/>
      The significance of this observation is not presently understood, although this finding may indicate the possible importance of the C-terminal viral flanking sequences in SH3 domain binding.
    </p>
    <p num="69">
      Indeed, a synthetic peptide bearing only the core consensus sequence RPLPPLP (SEQ ID NO:9) was less effective in binding to target SH3 domains than synthetic peptides that also included additional amino acid residues flanking the core sequences.
      <br/>
      Thus, 13-mers and 14-mers having the sequences RSTPRPLPMLPTTR (SEQ ID NO:62), RSTPRPLPPLPTTR (SEQ ID NO:67), GILAPPVPPRNTR (SEQ ID NO:63), GPHRRLPPTPATR (SEQ ID NO:65), and VLKRPLPIPPVTR (SEQ ID NO:64) have been prepared and shown to bind to SH3 domains, such as those of Src and Yes, much more avidly than the 7-mer, RPLPPLP (SEQ ID NO:9).
      <br/>
      The 13-mer ANPSPATRPLPTR (SEQ ID NO:66) has been shown to have binding affinities comparable to the core consensus sequence.
      <br/>
      In each case, the 13-mers comprise a 7-mer "core" sequence plus additional amino acid residues flanking same, some of which additional amino acid residues are contributed by the viral flanking sequences.
    </p>
    <p num="70">
      Thus, in one embodiment of the present invention, a 7-mer core includes a consensus motif of the formula RXLP PHI  PHI P (SEQ ID NO:71), wherein R is arginine, L is leucine, P is proline, X represents any amino acid except cysteine and  PHI  represents a hydrophobic amino acid residue.
      <br/>
      By "hydrophobic amino acid residue," the applicants mean to include F, Y, W, V, A, I, L, P or M, each letter representing the standard one-letter designation for the corresponding amino acid residue.
    </p>
    <p num="71">
      Furthermore, a preferred 9-mer peptide comprising two additional amino acids on the C-terminal end of the core sequence is envisioned having a consensus motif of the formula RXLP PHI  PHI PX PSI  (SEQ ID NO:10).
      <br/>
      In this preferred 9-mer consensus motif, the symbol  PSI  represents a hydrophilic amino acid residue, except cysteine.
      <br/>
      By "hydrophilic amino acid residue," the applicants mean to include K, R, H, D, E, N, Q, T, S or C, and the other symbols are as defined above.
      <br/>
      For the purposes of the present invention, a glycine residue (G) may be considered either a hydrophobic or a hydrophilic amino acid residue.
      <br/>
      The one-letter symbols B and Z, which stand for N or D and Q or E, respectively, are considered hydrophilic amino acid residues.

    <p num="72">
      Particular 13-mer peptides of the present invention include those listed, below.
      <br/>
      It is noted, however, that not all the following 13-mer peptides correlate strictly to or comply with the preferred 9-mer consensus motif, described above.
      <br/>
      Those peptides that do not comply (indicated in italics, with the non-complying amino acid residues underscored) can, thus, be described as "resembling" those that do comply (indicated in normal type) with the preferred 9-mer consensus motif: PGFRELPPLPPSR (SEQ ID NO:72), AQSRPLPIPPETR (SEQ ID NO:73), VLKRPLPIPPVTR (SEQ ID NO:64), PPNSPLPPLPTHL (SEQ ID NO:74), TGRGPLPPLPNDS (SEQ ID NO:75), YSTRPVPPITRPS (SEQ ID NO:76), SHKSRLPPLPTRP (SEQ ID NO:77), YRFRALPSPPSAS (SEQ ID NO:78), GPHRRLPPTPATR (SEQ ID NO:65), LAQRQLPPTPGRD (SEQ ID NO:79), ALQRRLPRTPPPA (SEQ ID NO:80), PATRPLPTRPSRT (SEQ ID NO:81), YSTRPLPSRPSRT (SEQ ID NO:82), XPGRILLLPSEPR (SEQ ID NO:83), SGGILAPPVPPRN (SEQ ID NO:84), RSTRPLPILPRTT (SEQ ID NO:85), STPRPLPMLPTTR (SEQ ID NO:86), STNRPLPMIPTTR (SEQ ID NO:87), RSTRPLPSLPITT (SEQ ID NO:88), STSRPLPSLPTTR (SEQ ID NO:89), RSTRSLPPLPPTT (SEQ ID NO:90), RSTRQLPIPPTTT (SEQ ID NO:91), STPRPLPLIPTTP (SEQ ID NO:92), RSTRPLPPTPLTT (SEQ ID NO:93), and RSTRPQPPPPPITT (SEQ ID NO:94).
      <br/>
      Accordingly, other peptides not specifically disclosed, which either comply with or "resemble" the preferred 9-mer consensus motif, can be readily envisioned by those of ordinary skill in the art and are considered to be equivalent to those that are specifically disclosed above.
      <br/>
      In particular, non-compliance at positions 1 (S, G, and I, in place of R, are tolerated), 3 (V, A, and Q, in place of L, are tolerated), 4 (L, in place of P, is tolerated), 5 (hydrophilic amino acid residues, S, R, and T, are tolerated in place of a hydrophobic amino acid residue), 6 (hydrophilic amino acid residues, R and T, are tolerated in place of a hydrophobic amino acid residue), 7 (T, and S, in place of P, are tolerated), and 9 (P and A are tolerated in place of a hydrophilic amino acid residue) have been observed.

    <p num="73">5.3.1. Binding Specificities</p>
    <p num="74">
      It has been discovered that certain of the binding peptides disclosed have a greater relative binding affinity for one SH3 domain over another.
      <br/>
      Referring now to FIG. 8, the relative binding affinities of the various peptides described above toward different SH3 domain targets are graphically presented.
      <br/>
      As one can see, the relative binding affinities of the respective peptides can differ by orders of magnitude.
      <br/>
      Thus, as shown in FIG. 8, the peptide GPHRRLPPTPATR (SEQ ID NO:65), having the relevant sequence of the phage clone identified as T12.SRC3.3, is specific to Src family SH3 domains, including, but not limited to, Src, Yes, Lck, Hck, Fgr, Fyn, and Lyn.
      <br/>
      This SH3 binding peptide has little affinity for SH3 domains derived from PLC GAMMA  or Grb2.
      <br/>
      On the other hand, the peptide GILAPPVPPRNTR (SEQ ID NO:63), corresponding to the relevant sequence of the phage clone T12.SRC3.1, which is one of the most abundant binding clones found by the present method, binds generically to a broad range of SH3 domains, including Src, PLC GAMMA , and Grb2.
    </p>
    <p num="75">
      On an intermediate level, the present invention has also uncovered a peptide, VLKRPLPIPPVTR (SEQ ID NO:64), corresponding to the relevant sequence of the phage clone T12.SRC3.6, which is Src preferential; that is, this peptide exhibits strong binding affinities for members of the Src family, some binding affinities for Grb2 proteins, but little binding affinities for PLC GAMMA  domains.
      <br/>
      The peptide ANPSPATRPLPTR (SEQ ID NO:66), corresponding to the relevant sequence of the phage clone T12.SRC3.2, also exhibits Src family specificity similar to GPHRRLPPTPATR (SEQ ID NO:65).
      <br/>
      The peptides RSTPRPLPMLPTTR (R8C.YES3.5; SEQ ID NO:62) and RSTPRPLPPLPTTR (representative consensus motif; SEQ ID NO:67) are highly specific for SH3 domain of Src, Yes, and other Src-related proteins.
    </p>
    <p num="76">5.4. Further Discussion of Binding Experiments</p>
    <p num="77">
      At the outset it is apparent that the binding affinity of certain peptides to the SH3 domain of Src and Src-related proteins is governed by more than just the presence of the preferred core consensus sequences, RPLPPLP (SEQ ID NO:9) or RPLPMLP (SEQ ID NO:95; i.e., RPLP(P/M)LP, SEQ ID NO:96).
      <br/>
      Thus, while the synthetic peptides RSTPRPLPMLPTTR (R8C.YES3.5; SEQ ID NO:62) and RSTPRPLPPLPTTR (consensus; (SEQ ID NO:67) exhibit a strong specific binding affinity for Src SH3, the other synthetic peptides tested also exhibited an avid binding affinity to SH3 domains relative to the 7-mer, RPLPPLP (SEQ ID NO:9).
      <br/>
      These other peptides, GILAPPVPPRNTR (SEQ ID NO:63), VLKRPLPIPPVTR (SEQ ID NO:64), GPHRRLPPTPATR (SEQ ID NO:65), and ANPSPATRPLPTR (SEQ ID NO:66), sport core sequences and flanking sequences that do not closely adhere to the preferred core consensus sequences.
      <br/>
      Thus, these results suggest that binding affinity to SH3 domains is governed to a large extent by the nature of the amino acid residues flanking the core 7-mer sequence.
    </p>
    <p num="78">
      The binding characteristics of Src SH3-selected peptides was determined using synthetic biotinylated peptides corresponding to the sequences displayed by Src SH3-selected phage.
      <br/>
      These biotinylated peptides were assayed for direct binding to immobilized Src SH3-GST.
      <br/>
      Each of the five library-derived peptides tested were found to bind to Src SH3-GST and Yes SH3-GST over background (FIG. 8).
      <br/>
      Furthermore, a strong correlation was observed between the similarity of a given peptide to the preferred core consensus sequence RPLP(P/M)LP (SEQ ID NO:96) and the peptide's affinity for Src SH3-GST.
      <br/>
      The core sequence of the clone T12.SRC3.1 (GILAPPVPPRNTR; SEQ ID NO:63) appears to provide more generic SH3 domain-binding characteristics.
    </p>
    <p num="79">Experiments comparing the relative binding of various phage clones to SH3 domains taken from a variety of proteins demonstrated the preference of these clones for Src and Src-related SH3 domains over SH3 domains taken from other proteins.</p>
    <p num="80">
      It was further found that while the 7-mer having the consensus sequence RPLPPLP (SEQ ID NO:9) bound to Src SH3-GST only weakly, peptides comprising the consensus sequence flanked by residues encoded by one of the Src SH3-selected clones (R8C.YES3.5), RSTP (SEQ ID NO:97) at the N-terminal end and TTR at the C-terminal end, bound significantly better than any of the peptides tested (FIG. 7).
      <br/>
      Thus, as stated previously, sequences that flank the RPLP(P/M)LP (SEQ ID NO:96) core appear to be important contributors to SH3 binding.
      <br/>
      It is further surmised that a peptide having or resembling the sequence RSTPAPPVPPRTTR (SEQ ID NO:98) should exhibit strong but generic binding to a variety of SH3 domains.
    </p>
    <p num="81">
      Similarly, it is observed that most of the Src SH3-binding motifs are located near the carboxy-terminus of the random peptides, adjacent to sequences which are fixed in every clone (FIG. 5).
      <br/>
      The exceptional clones tend to possess sequences that resemble motifs that include fixed flanking sequences.
      <br/>
      This clustering contrasts with previous results, in which binding motifs are distributed throughout the random peptide.
      <br/>

    </p>
    <p num="82">
      The binding of the library-derived Src SH3-binding peptides was compared to that of peptides corresponding to proline-rich regions of natural proteins.
      <br/>
      Peptides corresponding to SH3-binding regions in human PI-3' Kinase (KISPPTPKPRPPRPLPV; SEQ ID NO:69) and human SOS1.20 (GTVEPVPPPVPPRRRPESA; SEQ ID NO:68), as well as a proline-rich region of the cytoskeletal protein vinculin (LAPPKPPLPEGEV; SEQ ID NO:70), bound Src SH3 much less well than the library-derived peptides (FIG. 7).
    </p>
    <p num="83">
      As mentioned above, the relative specificity of binding was explored.
      <br/>
      Thus, the relative binding of Src SH3-selected peptides to equal amounts of GST fusions to SH3 domains from different proteins was determined (FIG. 8).
      <br/>
      While all of the library-derived peptides bound the Src and Yes SH3 domains almost equally well, none of the peptides (with the exception of peptide T12.SRC3.1, the most divergent peptide tested) bound the SH3 domains of Grb2, Crk, Abl or PLC GAMMA 1 appreciably.
      <br/>
      Thus, the library-derived peptides, in contrast with a peptide derived from SOS1, exhibit SH3 binding that is relatively specific for Src-family members.
    </p>
    <p num="84">
      Next, it was determined whether the binding to the Src SH3 domain was qualitatively like the interactions of the SH3 domain and natural proteins found in cell lysates.
      <br/>
      Thus, radiolabeled proteins were prepared from NIH 3T3 cell lysates and chromatographed over Src SH3-GST immobilized on glutathione linked Sepharose.
      <br/>
      SDS-PAGE shows that a number of proteins can be affinity purified in this manner.
      <br/>
      The synthesized peptides bind quite well to the Src SH3 domain, as they can compete the binding of radiolabeled proteins from cell lysates to immobilized Src-GST, with an IC50 of 1-10 mM (FIG. 9).
      <br/>
      In conclusion, the peptides can efficiently block the interaction of cellular proteins with Src SH3 in vitro.

      To explore the ability of the library-derived Src SH3-binding peptides to exert a biochemical effect in vivo, the influence of the peptides on the maturation of Xenopus laevis oocytes was examined.
      <br/>
      Hence, stage VI oocytes were injected with peptide, exposed to progesterone, and scored for germinal vesicle breakdown.
      <br/>
      FIG. 10 shows that the rate of maturation was accelerated by approximately one hour when oocytes were injected with the SH3-binding peptide consisting of RPLPPLP (SEQ ID NO:9) flanked by residues from clone T12.SRC3.6 (VLKRPLPIPPVTR; SEQ ID NO:64), but not with water or a peptide corresponding to a proline-rich segment of vinculin (LAPPKPPLPEGEV; SEQ ID NO:70) as controls.
      <br/>
      The magnitude of this effect is roughly equivalent to that seen with injection of mRNA encoding constituitively active Src.
      <br/>
      See, e.g., FIG. 3B in Unger, T. F. and Steele, R. E., supra.
      <br/>
      This result suggests that the library-derived Src SH3-binding peptide is effectively relieving an inhibitory effect of the Src SH3 domain upon Src PTK activity.
      <br/>
      This model is consistent with a number of studies which have demonstrated an inhibitory effect of the Src SH3 domain upon Src kinase and transforming activity.

    <p num="87">As already indicated above, the present invention also seeks to provide diagnostic, prophylactic, and therapeutic agents based on the SH3 binding peptides described herein.</p>
    <p num="88">In one embodiment, diagnostic agents are provided, preferably in the form of kits, comprising an SH3 domain-binding peptide and a detectable label conjugated to said peptide directly, indirectly or by complexation, said peptide comprising: (i) a core sequence motif of the formula RXLP PHI  PHI P (SEQ ID NO:71), wherein X represents any amino acid except cysteine and  PHI  represents a hydrophobic amino acid residue, including F, Y, W, V, A, I, L, P, M or G, each letter representing the standard one-letter designation for the corresponding amino acid residue; and (ii) two or more additional amino acid residues flanking said core sequence at its C-terminal end, N-terminal end or both.</p>
    <p num="89">
      The diagnostic agents of the present invention can be used to detect the presence of SH3 domains of a generic or specific type in cells, tissues or organs either in vitro or in vivo.
      <br/>
      For in vivo applications, the diagnostic agent is preferably mixed with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier for administration, either enterally, parenterally or by some other route dictated by the needs of the particular application.
    </p>
    <p num="90">
      In a particular embodiment, for example, an assay based on a fusion product is contemplated which comprises a Src SH3 domain-binding peptide of the invention and a substrate for deregulated or "activated" Src.
      <br/>
      For instance, a muscle biopsy, taken from a subject suspected of being infected by the Rous sarcoma virus, can be treated with an effective amount of the fusion product.
      <br/>
      By subsequent analysis of the degree of conversion of the substrate, one can potentially detect infection by the Rous sarcoma virus in the subject, particularly mammals, especially chickens.
      <br/>
      The presence of the retrovirus, which causes the expression of deregulated or "activated" Src, may thus be indicated by unusually high levels of Src as revealed by large amounts of the converted substrate.
      <br/>
      See, for example, Paxton, W. G. et al., in Biochem.
      <br/>
      Biophys. Res. Commun. (1994) 200(1):260-267 (detection of phosphorylated tyrosine and serine residues of angiotensin II AT1 receptor, a substrate of Src family tyrosine kinases); another suitable substrate may be the protein p68 (Fumagalli, S. et al., in Nature (1994) 368(6474):871-874; Taylor, S. J. and Shalloway, D., in Ibid. at 867-871.
    </p>
    <p num="91">
      Alternatively, the enzyme can be isolated by selective binding to a form of the SH3 domain-binding peptides of the present invention (e.g., biotin-peptide conjugate).
      <br/>
      After isolation of the protein-peptide conjugate complex (e.g., on a column comprising streptavidin), the activity of the enzyme can then be assayed by conventional methods to determine its level of protein kinase activity which can be taken as an indication of the presence of the deregulated or "activated" form of the enzyme.
      <br/>
      An assay for Src kinase has been described by Klinz and Maness, in Neuroprotocols (a companion to Neuroscience) (1992) 1(3):224-231.
    </p>
    <p num="92">
      Moreover, the diagnostic agents of the invention can also serve as imaging agents of cells, tissues or organs, especially those that contain proteins with an SH3 domain.
      <br/>
      For example, neural cells (e.g., neurons, other areas of the brain), osteoclasts, osteoblasts, platelets, immune cells, and other dividing cells are known to express or contain proteins with SH3 domains.
      <br/>
      Thus, an image can be taken of portions of the body to serve as a baseline for subsequent images to detect physiologic or biochemical changes in the subject's body.
      <br/>
      For instance, changes in the condition of cellular levels of Src or a transformation of the cellular Src to an "activated" form may be detected using the diagnostic or imaging agents of the present invention.

    <p num="93">
      Accordingly, it has been demonstrated that an SH3-binding peptide tagged with a fluorescence emitter can provide an image of the cytoskeleton.
      <br/>
      The images are presented in FIG. 11. As can be seen from FIG. 11, panels A, B, and C show the fluorescence image that is obtained on treating NIH 3T3 fibroblasts with SH3 domain-binding peptides modified to include a fluorescent tag.
      <br/>
      In sharp contrast, panel D shows only a dark image that is produced when the cells are treated with a proline-rich segment of vinculin as a control.
    </p>
    <p num="94">
      In another embodiment, an SH3 domain-binding peptide-horseradish immunoperoxidase complex or related immunohistochemical agent could be used to detect and quantitate specific receptor molecules in tissues, serum or body fluids.
      <br/>
      In particular, the present invention provides useful diagnostic reagents for use in immunoassays, Southern or Northern hybridization, and in situ assays.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, the diagnostic agents described herein may be suitable for use in vitro or in vivo.
    </p>
    <p num="95">
      In addition, the diagnostic or imaging agent of the present invention is not limited by the nature of the detectable label.
      <br/>
      Hence, the diagnostic agent may contain one or more such labels including, but not limited to, radioisotope, fluorescent tags, paramagnetic substances, heavy metals, or other image-enhancing agents.
      <br/>
      Those of ordinary skill in the art would be familiar with the range of label and methods to incorporate or conjugate them into the SH3 domain-binding peptide to form diagnostic agents.

      In yet a further embodiment, pharmaceutical compositions are provided comprising an SH3 domain-binding peptide and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.
      <br/>
      In a specific embodiment of the invention, the pharmaceutical composition is useful for the modulation of the activity of SH3 domain-containing proteins.
      <br/>
      By "modulation" is meant either inhibition or enhancement of the activity of the protein target.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, a pharmaceutical composition is disclosed comprising an SH3 domain-binding peptide and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, said peptide comprising: (i) a 9-mer sequence motif of the formula RXLP PHI  PHI PX PSI  (SEQ ID NO:10), wherein X represents any amino acid except cysteine,  PHI  represents a hydrophobic amino acid residue, and wherein  PSI  is a hydrophilic amino acid residue except cysteine, each letter representing the standard one-letter designation for the corresponding amino acid residue; and, optionally, (ii) additional amino acid residues flanking the 9-mer sequence at its C-terminal end, N-terminal end or both, up to a total of 45 amino acid residues, including said 9-mer sequence.
      <br/>
      Preferably, the peptide comprises at least one, more preferably at least two, and most preferably at least three additional amino acids flanking the 9-mer sequence.
    </p>
    <p num="97">
      As stated above, the therapeutic or diagnostic agents of the invention may also contain appropriate pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, diluents and adjuvants.
      <br/>
      Such pharmaceutical carriers can be sterile liquids, such as water and oils including those of petroleum, animal, vegetable or synthetic origin, such as peanut oil, soybean oil, mineral oil, sesame oil and the like.
      <br/>
      Water is a preferred carrier when the pharmaceutical composition is administered intravenously.
      <br/>
      Saline solutions and aqueous dextrose and glycerol solutions can also be employed as liquid carriers, particularly for injectable solutions.
      <br/>
      Suitable pharmaceutical excipients include starch, glucose, lactose, sucrose, gelatin, malt, rice, flour, chalk, silica gel, magnesium carbonate, magnesium stearate, sodium stearate, glycerol monostearate, talc, sodium chloride, dried skim milk, glycerol, propylene, glycol, water, ethanol and the like.
      <br/>
      These compositions can take the form of solutions, suspensions, tablets, pills, capsules, powders, sustained-release formulations and the like.
      <br/>
      Suitable pharmaceutical carriers are described in "Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences" by E. W. Martin.
    </p>
    <p num="98">
      Such compositions will contain an effective therapeutic amount of the active compound together with a suitable amount of carrier so as to provide the form for proper administration to the subject.
      <br/>
      While intravenous injection is a very effective form of administration, other modes can be employed, including but not limited to intramuscular, intraperitoneal, and subcutaneous injection, and oral, nasal, enteral, and parenteral administration.
    </p>
    <p num="99">
      The therapeutic agents and diagnostic agents of the instant invention are used for the treatment and/or diagnosis of animals, and more preferably, mammals including humans, as well as dogs, cats, horses, cows, pigs, guinea pigs, mice and rats.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, other methods contemplated in the present invention, include, but are not limited to, a method of modulating, i.e., inhibiting or enhancing, bone resorption in a mammal (see, e.g., Hall, T. J., in Biochem.
      <br/>
      Biophys. Res. Commun.

J. and Shalloway, D., supra).
    </p>
    <p num="100">
      The diagnostic or therapeutic agents of the present invention can be modified by attachment to soluble macromolecules such as proteins, polysaccharides, or synthetic polymers.
      <br/>
      For example, the peptide could be coupled to styrene-maleic acid copolymers (see, e.g., Matsumura and Maeda, Cancer Res. (1986) 46:6387), methacrylamide copolymers (Kopececk and Duncan, J. Controlled Release (1987) 6:315), or polyethylene glycol (PEG) (e.g., Hershfield and Buckley, N. Engl. J. Med. (1987) 316:589; Ho et al., Drug Metab.
      <br/>
      Dispos. (1986) 14:349; Chua et al., Ann. Intern. Med. (1988) 109:114).
      <br/>
      The agents, if desired, are further targeted by attachment to an antibody, especially a monoclonal antibody.
      <br/>
      Such antibodies include but are not limited to chimeric, single chain, Fab fragments, and Fab expression libraries.
      <br/>
      In one embodiment the agent is coupled to the macromolecule via a degradable linkage so that it will be released in vivo in its active form.
    </p>
    <p num="101">
      In another embodiment, the therapeutic or diagnostic agent may be delivered in a vesicle, in particular a liposome.
      <br/>

    </p>
    <p num="102">
      In yet another embodiment, the therapeutic or in vivo diagnostic agent can be delivered in a controlled release system.
      <br/>
      In one embodiment, a pump may be used (see Langer, supra; Sefton, CRC Crit.
      <br/>
      Ref. Biomed. Eng. (1987) 14:201; Buchwald et al., Surgery (1980) 88:507; Saudek et al., N. Engl. J. Med. (1989) 321:574).
      <br/>
      In another embodiment, polymeric materials may be used (see Medical Applications of Controlled Release, Langer and Wise (eds.), CRC Pres., Boca Raton, Fla., 1974; Controlled Drug Bioavailability, Drug Product Design and Performance, Smolen and Ball (eds.) Wiley, N.Y. 1984; Raner and Peppas, J. Macromol. Sci. Rev. Macromol. Chem. (1983) 23:61; see, also, Levy et al., Science (1985) 228:190; During et al., Ann. Neurol. (1989) 25:351; Howard et al., J. Neurosurg. (1989) 71:105).
      <br/>
      In a preferred embodiment, a controlled release system may be placed next to the therapeutic target, thus requiring only a fraction of the systemic dose (see, e.g., Goodson, in Medical Applications of Controlled Release, supra, (1984) 2:115-138).
      <br/>
      It will be recognized by one of ordinary skill in the art that a particular advantage of the invention is that a peptide will not be subject to the problems of denaturation and aggregation associated with proteins held in the warm, most environment of a body in a controlled release system.

    <p num="104">5.6 Identification of Compounds that Affect Binding of SH3 Domain-containing Proteins and their Ligands</p>
    <p num="105">
      A common problem in the development of new drugs is that of identifying a single, or a small number, of compounds that possess a desirable characteristic from among a background of a large number of compounds that lack that desired characteristic.
      <br/>
      This problem arises both in the testing of compounds that are natural products from plant, animal, or microbial sources and in the testing of man-made compounds.
      <br/>
      Typically, hundreds, or even thousands, of compounds are randomly screened by the use of in vitro assays such as those that monitor the compound's effect on some enzymatic activity or its ability to bind to a reference substance such as a receptor or other protein.
    </p>
    <p num="106">
      The compounds which pass this original screening test are known as "lead" compounds.
      <br/>
      These lead compounds are then put through further testing, including, eventually, in vivo testing in animals and humans, from which the promise shown by the lead compounds in the original in vitro tests is either confirmed or refuted.
      <br/>
      See Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, 1990, A. R. Gennaro, ed., Chapter 8, pages 60-62, Mack Publishing Co., Easton, Pa.; Ecker and Crooke, 1995, Bio/Technology 13:351-360.
    </p>
    <p num="107">
      There is, of course, a continual need for new compounds to be tested in the in vitro assays that make up the first testing step described above.
      <br/>
      There is also a continual need for new assays by which the pharmacological activities of these compounds may be tested.
      <br/>
      It is an object of the present invention to provide such new assays to determine whether a candidate compound is capable of affecting the binding between a protein or polypeptide containing an SH3 domain and a ligand of the SH3 domain.
      <br/>
      A compound capable of affecting this binding would be useful as a means of modulating the pharmacological activity of proteins or polypeptides containing the SH3 domain.
      <br/>
      The present invention provides suitable ligands for SH3 domains for use in such assays.
      <br/>
      Such assays can be performed where the SH3 domains include, but are not limited to, SH3 domains from Cortactin, Nck, Abl, PLC GAMMA , Src, p53bp2, Crk, Yes, and Grb2.

    <p num="108">
      The present invention provides methods of identifying a compound that affects the binding of a molecule comprising an SH3 domain and a ligand of the SH3 domain.
      <br/>
      The effect on binding can be an increase or decrease in total amount of binding or in affinity of binding.
      <br/>
      Preferably, the effect is an inhibition (reduction in or loss of binding).
    </p>
    <p num="109">Accordingly, the invention provides a method of identifying an inhibitor of the binding between a first molecule comprising an SH3 domain and a second molecule that binds to the SH3 domain comprising incubating one or more compounds from which it is desired to select such an inhibitor with the first molecule and the second molecule under conditions conducive to binding and detecting the one or more compounds that inhibit binding of the first molecule to the second molecule.</p>
    <p num="110">In a particular embodiment of the above-described method, the second molecule is obtained by:</p>

    <p num="113">(iii) producing a peptide comprising the consensus sequence;</p>
    <p num="114">wherein the second molecule comprises the peptide comprising the consensus sequence.</p>
    <p num="115">In another embodiment, the second molecule is obtained by:</p>

      One version of an assay suitable for use in the present invention comprises binding the protein containing an SH3 domain to a solid support such as the wells of a microtiter plate.
      <br/>
      The wells contain a suitable buffer and other substances to ensure that conditions in the wells permit the binding of the protein or polypeptide containing an SH3 domain to its ligand.
      <br/>
      The ligand and a candidate compound are then added to the wells.
      <br/>
      The ligand is preferably labeled, e.g., it might be biotinylated or labeled with a radioactive moiety, or it might be linked to an enzyme, e.g., alkaline phosphatase.
      <br/>
      After a suitable period of incubation, the wells are washed to remove any unbound ligand and compound.
      <br/>
      If the candidate compound does not interfere with the binding of the protein or polypeptide containing an SH3 domain to the labeled ligand, the labeled ligand will bind to the protein or polypeptide containing an SH3 domain in the well.
      <br/>
      This binding can then be detected.
      <br/>
      If the candidate compound interferes with the binding of the protein or polypeptide containing an SH3 domain and the labeled ligand, label will not be present in the wells, or will be present to a lesser degree than is the case when compared to control wells that contain the protein or polypeptide containing an SH3 domain and the labeled ligand but to which no candidate compound is added.
      <br/>
      Of course, it is possible that the presence of the candidate compound will increase the binding between the protein or polypeptide containing an SH3 domain and the labeled ligand.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, the ligand can be affixed to solid substrate during the assay.

      FIG. 1 shows the formula of the oligonucleotides and the assembly scheme used in construction of the TSAR-9 library.
      <br/>
      The oligonucleotides were synthesized with an applied Biosystems 380a synthesizer (Foster City, Calif.), and the full-length oligonucleotides were purified by HPLC.
    </p>
    <p num="140">
      Five micrograms of each of the pair of oligonucleotides were mixed together in buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 15 mM KCl, 0.001% gelatin, 1.5 mM magnesium chloride), with 0.1% Triton X-100, 2 mM dNTP's, and 20 units of Taq DNA polymerase.
      <br/>
      The assembly reaction mixtures were incubated at 72 (degree)  C. for 30 seconds and then 30 (degree)  C. for 30 seconds; this cycle was repeated 60 times.
      <br/>
      It should be noted that the assembly reaction is not PCR, since a denaturation step was not used.
      <br/>
      Fill-in reactions were carried out in a thermal cycling, device (Ericomp, LaJolla, Calif.) with the following protocol: 30 seconds at 72 (degree)  C., 30 seconds at 30 (degree)  C., repeated for 60 cycles.
      <br/>
      The lower temperature allows for annealing of the six base complementary region between the two sets of the oligonucleotide pairs.
      <br/>
      The reaction products were phenol/chloroform extracted and ethanol precipitated.
      <br/>
      Greater than 90% of the nucleotides were found to have been converted to double stranded synthetic oligonucleotides.
    </p>
    <p num="141">
      After resuspension in 300  MU L of buffer containing 10 mM Tris-HCI, pH 7.5, 1 mM EDTA (TE buffer), the ends of the oligonucleotide fragments were cleaved with Xba I and Xho I (New England BioLabs, Beverly, Mass.) according to the supplier's recommendations.
      <br/>
      The fragments were purified by 4% agarose gel electrophoresis.
      <br/>
      The band of correct size was removed and electroeluted, concentrated by ethanol precipitation and resuspended in 100  MU L TE buffer.
      <br/>
      Approximately 5% of the assembled oligonucleotides can be expected to have internal Xho I or Xba I sites; however, only the full-length molecules were used in the ligation step of the assembly scheme.
      <br/>
      The concentration of the synthetic oligonucleotide fragments was estimated by comparing the intensity on an ethidium bromide stained gel run along with appropriate quantitated markers.
      <br/>
      All DNA manipulations not described in detail were performed according to Maniatis, supra.
    </p>
    <p num="142">
      To demonstrate that the assembled enzyme digested oligonucleotides could be ligated, the synthesized DNA fragments were examined for their ability to self-ligate.

      The digested fragments were incubated overnight at 18 (degree)  C. in ligation buffer with T4 DNA ligase.
      <br/>
      When the ligation products were examined by agarose gel electrophoresis, a concatamer of bands was visible upon ethidium bromide staining.
      <br/>
      As many as five different unit length concatamer bands (i.e., dimer, trimer, tetramer, pentamer, hexamer) were evident, suggesting that the synthesized DNA fragments were efficient substrates for ligation.

      6.1.2. Construction of Vectors
    </p>
    <p num="143">
      The construction of the M13 derived phage vectors useful for expressing a TSAR library has been recently described (Fowlkes, D. et al. BioTech. (1992) 13:422-427).
      <br/>
      To express the TSAR-9 library, an M13 derived vector, m663, was constructed as described in Fowlkes.
      <br/>
      The m663 vector contains the pIII gene having a c-myc-epitope, i.e., as a stuffer fragment, introduced at the mature N-terminal end, flanked by Xho I and Xba I restriction sites (see also, FIG.
      <br/>
      I of Fowlkes).
      <br/>
      6.1.3. Expression of the TSAR-9 Library
    </p>
    <p num="144">
      The synthesized oligonucleotides were then ligated to Xho I and Xba I double-digested m663 RF DNA containing, the pIII gene (Fowlkes) by incubation with ligase overnight at 12 (degree)  C. More particularly, 50 ng of vector DNA and 5 ng of the digested synthesized DNA and was mixed together in 50  MU L ligation buffer (50 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 10 mM MgCl2, 20 mM DTT, 0.1 mM ATP) with T4 DNA ligase.
      <br/>
      After overnight ligation at 12 (degree)  C., the DNA was concentrated by ethanol precipitation and washed with 70% ethanol.
      <br/>
      The ligated DNA was then introduced into E. coli (DH5 ALPHA F'; GIBCO BRL, Gaithersburg, Md.) by electroporation.
    </p>
    <p num="145">
      A small aliquot of the electroporated cells was plated and the number of plaques counted to determine that 108 recombinants were generated.
      <br/>
      The library of E. coli cells containing recombinant vectors was plated at a high density (.about.400,000 per 150 mM petri plate) for a single amplification of the recombinant phage.
      <br/>
      After 8 hr, the recombinant bacteriophage were recovered by washing each plate for 18 hr with SMG buffer (100 mM NaCl, 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mM MgCl2, 0.05% gelatin) and after the addition of glycerol to 50% were frozen at -80 (degree)  C. The TSAR-9 library thus formed had a working titer of .about.2 * 1011 pfu/ml.

    <p num="146">6.2. Preparation of the TSAR-12 Library</p>
    <p num="147">
      FIG. 2 shows the formula for the synthetic oligonucleotides and the assembly scheme used in the construction of the TSAR-12 library.
      <br/>
      As shown in FIG. 2, the TSAR-12 library was prepared substantially the same as the TSAR-9 library described in Section 6.1 above with the following exceptions: (1) each of the variant non-predicted oligonucleotide sequences, i.e., NNB, was 30 nucleotides in length, rather than 54 nucleotides; (2) the restriction sites included at the 5' termini of the variant, non-predicted sequences were Sal I and Spe 1, rather than Xho I and Xba I; and (3) the invariant sequence at the 3' termini to aid annealing of the two strands was GCGGTG and CGCCAC rather than CCAGGT and GGTCCA (5' to 3').
    </p>
    <p num="148">
      After synthesis including numerous rounds of annealing and chain extension in the presence of dNTP's and Taq DNA polymerase, and purification as described above in Section 6.1.1, the synthetic double stranded, oligonucleotide fragments were digested with Sal I and Spe I restriction enzymes and ligated with T4 DNA ligase to the nucleotide sequence encoding the M13 pIII gene contained in the m663 vector to yield a library of TSAR-expression vectors as described in Sections 6.1.2 and 6.1.3. The ligated DNA was then introduced into E. coli (DH5 ALPHA F'; GIBCO BRL, Gaithersburg, Md. by electroporation.
      <br/>
      The library of E. coli cells were plated at high density (.about.400,000 per 150 mm petri plate) for amplification of the recombinant phage.
      <br/>
      After about 8 hr, the recombinant bacteriophage were recovered by washing, for 18 hr with SMG buffer and after the addition of glycerol to 50% were frozen at -80 (degree)  C.

    <p num="150">6.3. Characterization of the TSAR-9 and -12 Libraries</p>
    <p num="151">
      The inserted synthetic oligonucleotides for each of the TSAR libraries, described in Sections 6.1 and 6.2 above, had a potential coding complexity of 2036 (.about.1047) and 2020, respectively, and since .about.1014 molecules were used in each transformation experiment, each member of these TSAR libraries should be unique.
      <br/>
      After plate amplification the library solution or stock has 104 copies of each member/mL.
    </p>
    <p num="152">
      It was observed that very few (&lt;10%) of the inserted oligonucleotide sequences characterized so far in both of the libraries have exhibited deletions or insertions.
      <br/>
      This is likely a reflection of the accuracy assembling the oligonucleotides under the conditions used and the fact that certain types of mutations (i.e., frame-shifts) would not be tolerated as pIII an essential protein for phage propagation.
    </p>
    <p num="153">
      In order to determine whether any coding bias existed in the variant non-predicted peptides expressed by these libraries, perhaps due to biases imposed in vitro during synthesis of the oligonucleotides or in vivo during expression by the reproducing phage, inserts were sequenced as set forth below.
      <br/>
      6.3.1. Characterization of TSAR-9 Library
    </p>
    <p num="154">
      Inserted synthetic oligonucleotide fragments of 23 randomly chosen isolates were examined from the TSAR-9 library.
      <br/>
      Individual plaques were used to inoculate I ml of 2 * YT broth containing E. coli (DH5 ALPHA F') cells and the cultures were allowed to grow overnight at 37 (degree)  C. with aeration.
      <br/>
      DNA was isolated from the culture supernatants according to Maniatis, supra.
      <br/>
      Twenty-three individual isolates were sequenced according to the method of Sanger (Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA (1979) 74:5463-5467) using as a primer the oligonucleotide 5'-AGCGTAACGATCTCCCG (SEQ ID NO. 99), which is 89 nucleotides downstream of the pIII gene cloning site of the m663 vector used to express the TSARS.
    </p>
    <p num="155">
      Nucleotide sequences and their encoded amino acid sequences were analyzed with the MACVECTOR (tm)  computer program (IBI, New Haven, Conn.).
      <br/>
      The Microsoft EXCEL (tm)  program was used to evaluate amino acid frequencies.
      <br/>
      Such analyses showed that the nucleotide codons coding for and hence most amino acids, occurred at the expected frequency in the TSAR-9 library of expressed proteins.
      <br/>
      The notable exceptions were glutamine and tryptophan, which were over- and under-represented, respectively.
    </p>
    <p num="156">
      It is of interest to note the paucity of TAG stop codons in the inserts, i.e., only 2 of .about.200 isolates characterized contained a TAG stop codon.
      <br/>
      About half �1-(47/48)36 � of the phage inserts were expected to have at least one TAG codon in view of the assembly scheme used.
      <br/>
      However, most of the TAG-bearing phage appear to have been lost from the library, even though the bacterial host was supE.
      <br/>
      This may be a consequence of suppression being less than 100% effective.
    </p>
    <p num="157">
      The amino acids encoded by the inserted double stranded synthesized oligonucleotide sequences, excluding the fixed PG-encoding centers, were concatenated into a single sequence and the usage frequency determined for each amino acid using the Microsoft EXCEL (tm)  program.
      <br/>
      These frequencies were compared to that expected from the assembly scheme of the oligonucleotides, and the divergence from expected values represented by the size of the bars above and below the baseline.
      <br/>
      Chi square analysis was used to determine the significance of the deviations.
      <br/>
      The majority of amino acids were found to occur at the expected frequency, with the notable exceptions that glutamine and tryptophan were somewhat over- and under-represented, respectively.
      <br/>
      Thus, except for the invariant Pro-Gly, any position could have any amino acid; hence, the sequences are unpredicted or random.

    <p num="160">
      Referring now to FIG. 3, two oligonucleotides were synthesized on an Applied Biosystems Model 380a machine with the sequence 5'-TGACGTCTCGAGTTGTNNKNNKNNKNNKNNKNNKNNKNNKTGTGGATCTAGAAGGATC-3' (SEQ ID NO:31) and 5'-GATCCTTCTAGATCC-3' (SEQ ID NO:32), where N is an equimolar ratio of deoxynucleotides A, C, G, and T, and K is an equimolar ratio of G and T. Fifty pmol of each oligonucleotide was incubated at 42 (degree)  C. for 5 min, then 37 (degree)  C. for 15 min, in 50  MU L of SEQUENASE (tm)  buffer (U.S. Biochemicals, Cleveland, Ohio) with 0.1  MU g/ MU L acetylated BSA, and 10 mM DTT.
      <br/>
      After annealing, 10 units of SEQUENASE (tm)  (U.S. Biochemicals) and 0.2 mM of each dNTP were added and incubated at 37 (degree)  C. for 15 min.

      The sample was then heated at 65 (degree)  C. for 2 hr, digested with 100 units of both Xho I and Xba I (New England BioLabs, Beverly, Mass.), phenol extracted, ethanol precipitated, and resolved on a 15% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel.

      The vector, m663 (Fowlkes, D. et al. Biotech. (1992) 13:422-427), was prepared by digestion with Xho I and Xba I, calf alkaline phosphatase (Boehringer Mannheim, Indianapolis, Ind.) treatment, phenol extracted, and purified by agarose gel electrophoresis.
      <br/>
      To ligate, 20  MU g vector was combined with 0.2  MU g insert in 3 mL with T4 DNA ligase (Boehringer Mannheim), according to the manufacturer.
      <br/>
      After removal of the protein and buffer by phenol extraction and ethanol precipitation, the ligated DNA was electroporated into XL1-Blue E. coli (Stratagene, San Diego, Calif.) and plated for eight hours at 37 (degree)  C. To recover the recombinant phage, the top agar was collected with a spatula, mixed with an equal volume of 100 mM NaCl, 10 mM MgCl2, and 50 mM Tris-HCI (pH7.5), and disrupted by two passes through an 18-gauge syringe needle.
      <br/>
      The bacterial cells were removed by centrifugation, and phage particles were collected by polyethylene glycol precipitation and stored at -70 (degree)  C. in 25% glycerol.

      However, all of the SH3-binding phage isolated from the R8C library had double-inserts.
      <br/>
      Such phage are presumed rare (i.e., &lt;5%) within the library, yet because the SH3-binding peptide appears to need to be linear they were selected for by our screening methods.
      <br/>
      Most likely they were formed during the generation of the library; one scenario is that the inserts ligated together to form head-to-head dimers and that they were subsequently cloned into m663 DNA by ligation with the vector's Xho I sticky end and by illegitimate ligation with the vector's Xba I site (see, FIG. 4).

    <p num="181">
      To demonstrate association of the SH3-binding peptides with SH3-domains of proteins inside cells, the SH3-binding peptides are tagged and localized in cells.
      <br/>
      For example, Bar-Sagi et al., in Cell (1993) 74:83-91, have shown that SH3-binding proteins localize to the cytoskeleton when expressed in cells.
      <br/>
      Thus, the SH3 domain-binding peptides of the present invention can serve as cellular targetting signals (e.g., to the cytoskeleton).
      <br/>
      Accordingly, the peptides are tagged with biotin and, subsequently, injected into cells.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, one can transfect into cells a recombinant plasmid that expresses a fusion protein comprising of the SH3-binding peptide and the green fluorescent protein (GFP, Chalfie et al., in Science (1994) 263:802-805).
      <br/>
      The location of the biotinylated peptide or the GFP fusion protein is then assayed with FITC-labeled streptavidin in paraformaldehyde-fixed cells or by direct fluorescence in living cells, respectively.

      Localization of the SH3-binding peptides to the cytoskeleton demonstrates that the SH3-binding peptides can bind SH3-domain proteins in vivo.

      Using procedures similar to those described in Sections 6.1 and 6.4 and also described in Sparks, A. B., et al., in Methods in Enzymology, (1995) 255:498-509, oligonucleotide inserts were constructed according to the schematic provided in FIG. 12. The two synthetic oligonucleotides (5'-ctgtgcctcgagk(nnk)6 cca(nnk)2 cca(nnk)6 tctagacgtgtcagt-3' (SEQ ID NO:162) and 5'-actgacacgtctaga-3'(SEQ ID NO:163), where k=g+t and n=g+a+t+c) were annealed and filled in with SEQUENASE (tm)  T7 DNA polymerase (Amersham, Arlington Heights, Ill.).
      <br/>
      The inserts were then digested with Xho I and Xba I and were ligated into gene III of the mBAX vector.
    </p>
    <p num="196">
      The mBAX vector was created by generating cloning sites in gene III of the M13mp18 vector (Messing, J., 1991, "Cloning in M13 phage or how to use biology at its best," Gene 100, 3-12) in the manner of Fowlkes et al., 1992, Biotechniques 13, 422-427.
      <br/>
      The mBAX vector displays a peptide sequence at the N-terminus of the mature pIII protein that encodes the epitope for the mouse monoclonal antibody 7E11 (see FIG. 13); it includes the stop codon TAG in the coding region, which is suppressed in E. coli carrying suppressor tRNA gene mutations known as supE or supF.
      <br/>
      There are no other stop codons in the mBAX genome.
      <br/>
      The mBAX vector also carries a segment of the alpha fragment of  BETA -galactosidase; bacterial cells expressing the omega fragment of  BETA -galactosidase that are infected by a bacteriophage that expresses the alpha fragment convert the clear XGal substrate into an insoluble blue precipitate.
      <br/>
      Thus, plaques of such bacteriophage on such cells appear blue.
    </p>
    <p num="197">
      Recombinant mBAX molecules can be distinguished easily from non-recombinant molecules due to the TAG codon in the XhoI-XbaI segment in gene III of mBAX.
      <br/>
      When recombinants are generated by replacing the Xho I-Xba I fragment with oligonucleotides encoding random peptides, the recombinants can be grown in bacteria with (e.g., DH5 ALPHA F') or without (e.g., JS5) suppressor tRNA mutant genes.
      <br/>
      On the other hand, the non-recombinant mBAX molecules fail to produce plaques on bacterial lawns where the bacteria (e.g., JS5) lack such suppressor genes.
      <br/>
      This is because in JS5, the TAG codon serves as a stop codon to yield a truncated pIII molecule during translation; since pIII is an essential protein component of viable M13 viral particles, no plaques will form.

      Clones with strong SH3-binding activity were selected for further analysis.
      <br/>
      The sequences of peptides displayed by these clones were determined by DNA sequencing of phage inserts.

      6.14.3 Preparation of GST-SH3 Fusion Proteins
    </p>
    <p num="200">
      Constructs encoding GST fusions to the Grb2 N-terminal (Grb2 N, aa 1-58), Nck N-terminal (Nck N, aa 1-68), Nck middle (Nck M, aa 101-166), Nck C-terminal (Nck C, aa 191-257), p53bp2 (aa 454-530), or Src (aa 87-143) SH3 domains were generated by PCR cloning of the appropriate cDNAs into pGEX-2T (Pharmacia, Piscataway, N.J.; a general reference for the pGEX vectors is Smith, D. B., &amp; Johnson, K. S. (1988) Gene 67, 31-40).
      <br/>
      The integrity of the constructs was confirmed by DNA sequencing. pGEX-derived constructs expressing GST fusions to the SH3 domains of Yes, Cortactin, Crk, Abl, and PLC GAMMA  were kindly provided by M. Sudol (Rockefeller University), J. T. Parsons (University of Virginia at Charlottsville), M. Matsuda (Tokyo, Japan), A. M. Pendergast (Duke University), and S. Earp (University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill), respectively.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, the GST-SH3 fusion proteins for Yes, Cortactin, Crk, Abl, and PLC GAMMA  could have been prepared as above for Grb2 N, Nck N, Nck M, Nck C, p53bp2, and Src, using published sequence information for these proteins.

      <br/>
      GST-SH3 fusion proteins were prepared as described in Smith, D. B., &amp; Johnson, K. S. (1988) Gene 67, 31-40.
      <br/>
      The integrity and purity of the fusion proteins were confirmed by SDS-PAGE.
      <br/>
      Protein concentrations were determined using a BIORAD (tm)  brand Coomassie Brilliant Blue protein assay (BioRad, Hercules, Calif.).

      6.14.4 SH3 Domain Binding Peptides and Consensus Sequences
    </p>
    <p num="201">The use of second generation or biased peptide libraries, which fix all or part of the PXXP (SEQ ID NO:161) consensus motif for SH3 domain binding peptides and randomize flanking residues, has defined additional sequence residues exhibiting selective SH3 domain binding.</p>
    <p num="202">
      Tables 1-5, below, list some of the relevant amino acid sequences obtained when the biased peptide library described in Section 6.14.1 was screened with GST-SH3 fusion proteins.
      <br/>
      The underscored amino acid residues in Tables 1-5 indicate the fixed positions.
      <br/>
      Also, indicated for each set of new binders is a "consensus" sequence, which seeks to include the additional features gleaned from the new binding peptides.
      <br/>
      The symbol " PHI " in the consensus sequences of Tables 1-5 represents a hydrophobic residue.
      <br/>
      The symbol x in the consensus sequences of Tables 1-5 represents any amino acid.
      <br/>
      For the Nck SH3 domain binding clones, a GST-SH3 fusion protein containing the middle SH3 domain of Nck was used.

      6.14.5 SH3 Ligand Binding Orientation
    </p>
    <p num="279">
      Peptide ligands bound to SH3 domains have been shown to assume a left-handed polyproline type II (PPII) helix conformation (Yu, H., Chen, J. K., Feng, S., Dalgarno, D. C., Brauer, A. W., &amp; Schreiber, S. L. (1994) Cell 76, 933-45).
      <br/>
      SH3 ligands are pseudo-symmetrical and may therefore bind in one of two opposite orientations (Feng, S., Chen, J. K., Yu, H., Simon, J. A., &amp; Schreiber, S. L. (1994) Science 266, 1241-7) (Feng et al.).
      <br/>
      Feng et al., supra, have demonstrated that peptides that bind in one or the other orientation share different consensus motifs.
      <br/>
      Specifically, ligands that bind in the Class I or Class II orientation conform to the consensus +pYPpYP (SEQ ID NO:244) or YPpYPp+ (SEQ ID NO:245) respectively, where uppercase positions represent conserved residues that contact the SH3 domain and confer specificity, and lowercase positions represent scaffolding residues that tend to be proline.

    <p num="280">
      According to this model, we predict that the peptides selected by the Src, Yes, Abl, and Grb2 N SH3 domains bind in the Class I orientation, whereas the peptides selected by the Cortactin, p53bp2, PLC GAMMA , and Crk N SH3 domains bind in the Class II orientation (see Table 14).
      <br/>
      Interestingly, most of the SH3 ligand consensus motifs identified in this work contain additional conserved residues flanking the SH3-binding core defined by Feng et al., supra.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, these conserved residues are situated N- and C-terminal of the SH3-binding core in Class I and Class II motifs, respectively, and are therefore predicted to interact with equivalent regions of their target SH3 domains (see Table 14).

      The Src SH3 domain is capable of binding both Class I and Class II peptides Feng et al., supra.
      <br/>
      Although Class I peptides predominate in the population of Src SH3 ligands selected from the PXXP (SEQ ID NO:161) library, one clone conforms well to the Class II consensus (see Table 6).
      <br/>
      Previously, Sparks, A. B., Quilliam, L. A., Thorn, J. M., Der, C. J., &amp; Kay, B. K. (1994) J. Biol. Chem. 269, 23853-6 and Yu, H., Chen, J. K., Feng, S., Dalgarno, D. C., Brauer, A. W., &amp; Schreiber, S. L. (1994) Cell 76, 933-45 had isolated Class II Src SH3 ligands sharing the consensus PP PSI PPR (SEQ ID NO:248).
      <br/>
      Similarly, whereas the Grb2 N SH3 domain has been shown to bind peptides from SOS with the Class II consensus sequence PP PSI PPR (SEQ ID NO:248) (Rozakis-Adcock, M., Fernley, R., Wade, J., Pawson, T., &amp; Bowtell, D. (1993) Nature 363, 83-5), we have isolated Grb2 N SH3 ligands that conform to the Class I consensus (see Table 14).
      <br/>
      Thus, both the Src and the Grb2 N SH3 domains apparently have the capacity to bind both Class I and Class II peptide ligands.

      6.14.6 SH3 Ligand Binding Characteristics
    </p>
    <p num="284">
      To explore further the capacity of SH3 domains to discriminate between different SH3 ligands, we investigated the binding of phage expressing various peptide ligands to a panel of SH3 domains.
      <br/>
      Equal titers of clonal phage stocks were incubated in microtiter wells coated with different GST-SH3 fusion proteins.
      <br/>
      The wells were washed several times, and bound phage were detected with an anti-phage antibody (see FIG. 14).
      <br/>
      Positive ELISA signals were equivalent to those obtained with previously characterized Src SH3-binding clones (Sparks, A. B., Quilliam, L. A., Thorn, J. M., Der, C. J., &amp; Kay, B. K. (1994) J. Biol. Chem. 269, 23853-6) and are indicative of SH3: peptide affinities in the 5 to 75  MU M range (Yu, H., Chen, J. K., Feng, S., Dalgarno, D. C., Brauer, A. W., &amp; Schreiber, S. L. (1994) Cell 76, 933-945; Rickles, R. J., Botfield, M. C., Weng, Z., Taylor, J. A., Green, O. M., Brugge, J. S., &amp; Zoller, M. J. (1994) EMBO J. 13, 5598-604).
      <br/>
      Whereas the Src, Yes, Crk, and Grb2 N SH3 domains cross-reacted with a few phage clones selected with other SH3 domains, the Abl, Cortactin, p53bp2, and PLC GAMMA  SH3 domains displayed considerable specificity.
      <br/>
      Significantly, only 33 of 220 potential instances of cross-reactivity were observed, suggesting that SH3 selectivity is the rule rather than the exception.
    </p>
    <p num="285">
      Each instance of cross-reactivity may be explained by similarities between the sequences of the peptides and the ligand preferences of the cross-reactive SH3 domains.
      <br/>
      For example, Crk SH3 cross-reacted with three phage clones selected with other SH3 domains; each of these clones coincidentally expressed peptides conforming to the Crk SH3 preferred ligand consensus motif.
      <br/>
      Similarly, the cross-reactivity observed between the Src, Yes, and Grb2 SH3 domains and clones selected by other SH3 domains within this group may be a consequence of the fact that these SH3 domains prefer the same proline-rich core.
      <br/>
      Finally, the Src and Yes SH3 domains cross-reacted with the PLC GAMMA  SH3 ligand MPPPVPPRPPGTL (a portion of SEQ ID NO:176), which contains the Class II Src SH3-binding sequence PPVPPR (SEQ ID NO:249).
      <br/>
      Taken together, these data demonstrate the capacity of SH3 domains to discern subtle differences in the primary structure of potential ligands.

    <p num="286">6.15 Use of Consensus Sequences to Determine the Amino Acid Sequences Responsible for Binding in Proteins that are Known to Bind SH3 Domains</p>
    <p num="287">
      There are many proteins that are known to bind SH3 domains but for which the specific sequences of those proteins that are responsible for binding to SH3 domains are not known.
      <br/>
      The consensus sequences shown above in Tables 1-13 can be used to search databases (e.g., GenBank) containing the amino acid sequences of those proteins in order to determine which sequences are responsible for the binding of those proteins to SH3 domains.
      <br/>
      This was done for a number of known SH3 domain binding proteins and sequences resembling the consensus sequences of Tables 1-13 were identified.
      <br/>
      The results are shown in Table 15.
      <br/>
      For comparison, also shown in Table 15 are the amino acid sequences that had previously been demonstrated to be responsible for SH3 domain binding for a number of proteins.

      The consensus sequences shown above in Tables 1-13 can be used to search databases (e.g., GenBank) containing the amino acid sequences of proteins that are not known to bind to SH3 domains.
      <br/>
      In this way, a large number of proteins not previously suspected of containing amino acid sequences that bind SH3 domains have been shown to contain such sequences.
      <br/>
      The portions of the amino acid sequences of these proteins that resemble one or more of the consensus motifs of Tables 1-13 are shown below in Table 16.
      <br/>
      The SH3 domain-binding sequences of the proteins shown in Table 16 can be used as ligands in the assays for the identification of compounds that affect binding of SH3 domain-containing proteins and their ligands that are described above in Section 5.6.
