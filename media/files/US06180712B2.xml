    <heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="1">
      The invention generally relates to silicone water-based emulsion compositions.
      <br/>
      More particularly, the invention relates to a silicone water-based emulsion composition that can be converted to silicone elastomer by the removal of water with the concomitant formation of a rubber coating that is highly adherent to substrates.
    </p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">
      Within the art of silicone water-based emulsion compositions that form rubber coatings upon water removal, Japanese Laid Open (Kokai or Unexamined) Patent Application Number Sho 56-16553 (16,553/1981), for example, teaches a silicone emulsion composition comprising hydroxyl-functional diorganosiloxane, colloidal silica, and an organotin compound or an organoamine compound.
      <br/>
      One problem with this composition is its inadequate adherence to fabrics and textiles.
      <br/>
      Although there have been attempts to address this problem through the addition of an amino-functional organoalkoxysilane or epoxy-functional organoalkoxysilane as an adhesion promoter (refer to Japanese Laid Open (Kokai or Unexamined) Patent Application Number Hei 5-98579 (98,579/1993)), this approach can still suffer from an inadequate adherence and may cause post-treatment yellowing of fabrics and textiles.
    </p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="3">It has now been discovered that the problems discussed above can be solved by the inclusion of a silatrane derivative in the water-based silicone composition.</p>
    <p num="4">The invention thus relates to a silicone water-based emulsion composition whose main components are</p>
    <p num="5">

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="8">
      The organopolysiloxane constituting component (A) is a straight-chain or branched organopolysiloxane that contains at least 2 silicon-bonded hydroxyl or alkoxy groups in each molecule.
      <br/>
      Diorganopolysiloxane with the following general formula is a typical example of the organopolysiloxane (A) under consideration.  (Chemical Structure image '2' not included in text)
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      The groups R in this general formula are each independently selected from monovalent organic groups.
      <br/>
      These monovalent organic groups can be specifically exemplified by saturated aliphatic hydrocarbon groups such as methyl, ethyl, propyl, butyl, pentyl, hexyl, heptyl, octyl, decyl, and dodecyl; unsaturated aliphatic hydrocarbon groups such as vinyl, allyl, and hexenyl; saturated alicyclic hydrocarbon groups such as cyclopentyl and cyclohexyl; aromatic hydrocarbon groups such as phenyl, tolyl, and naphthyl; halogen-substituted hydrocarbon groups such as 3,3,3-trifluoropropyl, 3-chloropropyl and nonafluorobutylethyl; epoxy-functional organic groups such as 3-glycidoxypropyl and 3,4-epoxycyclohexyl; carboxyl or carboxyl derived organic groups such as --(CH2)10 COOH, --(CH2)2 COOCH3, --(CH2)10 COOSi(CH3)3 and --CH2 CH(CH3)COOCH3 ; amino-functional organic groups such as --C3 H6 NHC2 H4 NH2, --C3 H6 NHC6 H11 and --C3 H6 NH2 ; and methacryl-functional organic groups such as methacryloxymethyl and 3-methacryloxypropyl.
      <br/>
      The group X is hydroxyl or alkoxy group, wherein the alkoxy can be exemplified by methoxy, ethoxy, and propoxy.
      <br/>
      The group Y is hydrogen or an alkyl group, wherein the alkyl can be exemplified by methyl, ethyl, and propyl.
      <br/>
      The group Z is --(OSiR2)k X. The subscripts n and k are both integers  &gt;= 0, while the subscript m is an integer  &gt;= 1.
      <br/>
      The total number average molecular weight of component (A) should be at least about 20,000, preferably 20,000 to 300,000, and the preferred ranges for the subscripts are as follows: n=integer from 0 to 100, k=integer from 0 to 100, and m=integer from 300 to 4,000.
      <br/>
      Component (A) is preferably used in emulsion form.
    </p>
    <p num="10">Organopolysiloxane (A) can be exemplified by polymers with the following structures.  (Chemical Structure image '3' not included in text)</p>
    <p num="11">
      Organopolysiloxane (A) can be synthesized by known methods.
      <br/>
      For example, component (A) can be synthesized by the re-equilibration reaction of  ALPHA , OMEGA -dihydroxysiloxane oligomer or organoalkoxysilane with cyclic siloxane, e.g., octamethylcyclotetrasiloxane, in the presence of a catalyst such as alkali metal hydroxide.
      <br/>
      Component (A) can also be synthesized by known emulsion polymerization techniques, for example, by first emulsifying reactants such as cyclic siloxane and organoalkoxysilane in water using anionic or cationic surfactant and then running a polymerization reaction with the addition of an acid or base catalyst, as necessary.
      <br/>
      The organoalkoxysilane used for this emulsion polymerization will have the general formula Rq Si(OR5)4-q in which R and R5 are defined as above and q is 1 or 2.
      <br/>
