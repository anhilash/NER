      No pharmacological utility is disclosed for this compound.

    <p num="5">Drug Res. 27(1) Nr 19, 1977, pages 4-14, Van K. H. Klingler discloses certain 1,3-dimethyl-8-substituted xanthines as intermediates solely in the synthesis of phenylethyl aminoalkyl xanthines.</p>

      Drug Res. 31 (11), Nr. 12, 1981, R. G. Werner et al, pages 2044-2048 discloses certain 1,3-dimethyl-8-substituted xanthines.
      <br/>
      No pharmacological activity is disclosed for these compounds.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      It has now been discovered that certain 8-substituted xanthines have a protective effect against the consequences of cerebral metabolic inhibition.
      <br/>
      The said compounds improve data acquisition or retrieval following transient forebrain ischaemia and are therefore useful in the treatment of cerebral vascular and neuronal degenerative disorders associated with learning, memory and cognitive dysfunctions including cerebral senility, multi-infarct dementia, senile dementia of the Alzheimer type, age associated memory impairment and certain disorders associated with Parkinson's disease.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      These compounds are also indicated to have neuroprotectant activity.
      <br/>
      They are therefore useful in the prophylaxis of disorders associated with neuronal degeneration resulting from ischaemic events, including cerebral ischaemia due to cardiac arrest, stroke and also after cerebral ischaemic events such as those resulting from surgery and/or during childbirth.
      <br/>
      In addition treatment with the compound is indicated to be of benefit for the treatment of functional disorders resulting from disturbed brain function following ischaemia.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      These compounds are also active in increasing the oxygen tension in ischaemic skeletal muscle.
      <br/>
      This property results in an increase in the nutritional blood flow through ischaemic skeletal muscle which in turn indicates that the compounds of the invention are of potential use as agents for the treatment of peripheral vascular disease such as intermittent claudication.
    </p>
    <p num="10">These compounds also act as phosphodiesterase inhibitors and elevate cyclic AMP levels and are therefore of potential use in the treatment of proliferative skin disease in human or non-human mammals.</p>
    <p num="11">These compounds are also indicated to have bronchodilator activity and thus to be of potential use in the treatment of disorders of the respiratory tract, such as reversible airways obstruction and asthma.</p>
    <p num="12">It has now also surprisingly been discovered that these compounds are good inhibitors of induced blood eosinophilia and that they are therefore potentially useful in the treatment and/or prophylaxis of disorders associated with increased numbers of eosinophils, such as asthma, and allergic disorders associated with atopy, such as urticaria, eczema and rhinitis.</p>
    <p num="13">Certain of the novel compounds are also indicated to. possess useful adenosine Al antagonist activity.</p>
    <p num="14">Finally the present compounds also show good metabolic stability.</p>
    <p num="15">Accordingly, the invention provides a method for the treatment of cerebrovascular disorders and/or disorders associated with cerebral senility and/or prophylaxis of disorders associated with neuronal degeneration resulting from ischaemic events and/or peripheral vascular disease and/or proliferative skin disease and/or for disorders of the respiratory tract and/or the treatment or prophylaxis of disorders associated with increased numbers of eosinophils and allergic disorders associated with atopy, which method comprises the administration of an effective, non-toxic amount of a compound of formula (I):  (Chemical Structure image '2' not included in text)</p>

    <p num="19">In another aspect, the invention provides the use of a compound of formula (I), or if appropriate a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, for the manufacture of a medicament for the treatment of cerebrovascular disorders and/or disorders associated with cerebral senility and/or prophylaxis of disorders associated with neuronal degeneration resulting from ischaemic events and/or peripheral vascular disease and/or proliferative skin diseases and/or disorders of the respiratory tract and/or the treatment or prophylaxis of disorders associated with increased numbers of eosinophils and allergic disorders associated with atopy.</p>

    <p num="21">The present invention also provides a pharmaceutical composition comprising a compound of formula (I), or if appropriate a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, providing that in the compound of formula (I) when R1 and R2 both represent methyl then R3 is not a nitro group, and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier therefor.</p>
    <p num="22">In a further aspect the invention provides a compound of formula (I), or if appropriate a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, providing that in the compound of formula (I) when R1 and R2 both represent methyl then R3 is not a nitro group, for use as an active therapeutic substance.</p>

    <p num="289">The procedure used was that described by Arch, J. R. S. and Newsholme, E. A. in Biochem. J. 158, 603, (1976): Erythrocytes were obtained from Na-citrate (16 mM; 0.1 ml/ml blood) anticoagulated blood by repeated centrifugation with removal of the buff coat and washing with an isotonic buffer (composition in mM: NaCl 13.7, KCl 4, CaCl2.2 H2 O 1.8, Na2 HPO4.12 H2 O 0.8., NaH2 PO4 0.2, MgSO4.7 H2 O 0.7, Hepes 3.4; pH 7.4).</p>
    <p num="290">The phosphodiesterase was extracted by mixing the erythrocytes with 4 volumes of 7 mM phosphate buffer, pH7.4, followed by sonification (3 * 10 sec; 100 W) and then centrifuging for 30 min at 4200 x g.</p>

    <p num="295">Animals</p>
    <p num="296">Male Charles River Sprague Dawley rats weighing between 250 to 300 g were used.</p>
    <p num="297">The method used was a modification of that described by Laycock et al (Int. Arch. Appl. Immunol, (1986). 81, 363).</p>
    <p num="298">
      Sephadex G200, particle size 40 to 120 micron, was suspended in isotonic saline at 0.5 mg/ml, and stored for 48 h at 4 (degree)  C. 1 ml of the suspension was given intravenously to rats on days 0,2 and 5.
      <br/>
      A control group received saline.
      <br/>
      The test compound was given before the Sephadex on each occasion, with a contact time expected to give maximum activity at the time of the Sephadex administration.
      <br/>
      Blood was taken from the tail vein of the rats on day 7 for the determination of total and differential leucocyte counts.
    </p>
    <p num="299">
      A control group of at least 6 animals was included each time a compound was evaluated.
      <br/>
      The control group received Sephadex and the vehicle without test compound.
      <br/>
      The results in the drug treated animals were compared with the control group.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, if the mean for the control group for any experiment was not statistically different from the mean of the sum of all of the control groups, then the treated animal results for that experiment were compared with the mean of the sum of all the control groups.
    </p>
    <p num="300">Total and differential leucocyte counts.</p>
    <p num="301">
      20  MU l samples of blood, taken from the tail vein of the rats, were added to 10 ml of Isoton II and, within 30 min, Zaponin (3 drops) was added, to lyse the erythrocytes.
      <br/>
      Five minutes later the total cell count was determined using a Coulter Counter Model DN.
      <br/>
      Differential leucocyte counts were carried out by fixing and staining a blood smear on a microscopic slide with May-Grunwald and Giemsa stains.
      <br/>
      A minimum of 400 cells were counted on each slide.

      The effect of the test compound upon Sephadex induced eosinophilia in the rat is set out in Table 3.
      <br/>
      The test compound was given orally 30 minutes before each injection of Sephadex.
      <br/>
      The results indicate that the test compound inhibits the induced eosinophilia in a dose dependent manner.
