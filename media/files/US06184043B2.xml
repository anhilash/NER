      No. 08/403,844, filed Apr. 18, 1995, which is a U.S. National Stage filing of PCT/NO93/00136, filed Sep. 10, 1993 and amended on Apr. 14, 1994, claiming priority from PCT/NO92/00151, filed Sep. 14, 1992, which applications are incorporated herein by reference.

      The present invention relates to an immunomagnetic method for detection of specific target cells in cell populations and solutions of cell populations.
      <br/>
      The invention also relates to a kit for performing the method in different cell populations.
    </p>
    <p num="3">
      In biology, biochemistry and adjacent fields it is considerable need for methods in which chemical entities are linked together.
      <br/>
      Such methods have an increasing importance in research regarding both normal and abnormal cell populations.
      <br/>
      Especially when solid supports are used cells can be immobilized, detected and isolated and purified.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, the cell content may be examined using a range of sofisticated methods.
      <br/>
      It is also of importance to be able to isolate the cells in viable forms.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      Affinity binding is a sofisticated way of linking chemical/biochemical entities together.
      <br/>
      In such a method a pair of binding partners, which for example are attached to the substances to be linked, bind to each other when brought in contact.
      <br/>
      One of the binding partners in such a linkage may be represented by a molecule on the cell surface.
      <br/>
      Several such binding partner systems are known, such as antigen-antibody, enzyme-receptor, ligand-receptor interactions on cells and biotin-avidin binding, of which antigen-antibody binding is most frequently used.
      <br/>
      A hapten/anti-hapten binding pair has also recently been suggested (WO 91/01368).
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      When such methods are used for isolation of specific cells, which are the subject for further various examinations, it is necessary to reverse the linkage without producing destructive effects on the binding partners, which ideally should recover their function upon returning to the original conditions.
      <br/>
      This is not always the case, although it is proposed a method for adequately cleaving antigen/anti-antigen and hapten/anti-hapten linkages (PCT/EP91/00671, PCT/EP90/01171).
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      Methods are known in which one of the binding partners is attached to an insoluble support, such as paramagnetic particles, and by which isolation of target cells in a mixed cell population is performed as negative isolation or positive isolation.
      <br/>
      In a negative isolation procedure the unwanted cells can be removed from the cell preparation by incubating the cells with antibody-coated particles, specific for the unwanted cells.
      <br/>
      Following the incubation the cell/antibody/particle-complex can be removed using the particles, leaving the wanted target cells behind.
      <br/>
      This result is often not satisfactory, since the wanted cells are left in the cell population, more or less purified, and also since the intention of the isolation procedure is to examine and/or perform further studies on the specific target cells.
      <br/>
      Attempts have been made to use particles for positive isolation, in which the wanted target cells are removed from the mixed cell population.
      <br/>
      These procedures have, however, been directed to certain target cells and are not suited for all target cell systems.
      <br/>
      A positive isolation procedure involving the hapten/anti-hapten linkage system has recently been proposed (PCT/EP90/01171) and also a method for isolating haemopoietic progenitor cells from bone marrow (PCT/EP90/02327).
      <br/>
      The latter is directed to use a combination of positive and negative selection for the purpose of isolating and possibly growing specific cells, i.e. haematopoietic progenitor cells, in the bone marrow, and is dependent upon removal of the particles.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      PCT/EP90/01171 relates to a method of connecting target cells to an insoluble support by using the abilities of hapten, anti-hapten antibodies and anti-cell antibodies to bind to each other, thus constructing a linkage between the insoluble support, i.e. particle, and the target cell, consisting at least of hapten and anti-hapten antibody or combinations of hapten and anti-hapten antibodies and anti-anti-hapten antibodies or secondary anti-cell antibodies.
      <br/>
      The later cleavage of the complex is performed by again exposing it to hapten or hapten analogue.
      <br/>
      Thus the constructed link always consists of hapten in addition to 1 or more elements.
      <br/>
      The method is directed to unspecified target cells and is directed to isolation of target cells and release of the insoluble support.
    </p>
    <p num="8">There is a need for a simple linkage to connect a target cell to an insoluble support, which do not involve compounds of a rather unspecified haptene-group, and which is directed to detection of specific target cells, with a minimum of unspecific cell association and which render unnecessary a later cleavage between the insoluble support and the specific target cell.</p>
    <p num="9">
      Thus the object of the present invention is to detect for diagnostic purposes specific target cells when used in a blood and bone marrow, without the problem with unspecific binding to normal cells.
      <br/>
      It represents a sensitive detection method for a variety of cells types, such that a high number of cells can be readily screened in the microscope and the procedure is rapid and simple.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, the present method can be used for isolation of cells for biochemical, biological and immunological examination, and for studying of specific genes at the nucleotide or protein level, in addition to culturing the cells, without the need for cleaving the cell-particles complex.
      <br/>
      A further object of the invention is to provide a kit for performing the method as characterized in the claims.
    </p>
    <p num="10">The intensions of the inventions are obtained by the method and kit characterized in the enclosed claims.</p>
    <p num="11">
      The method for immunomagnetic detection of target cells in a mixed cell population and physiological solutions containing cell populations is suitable for detection, but may also be used in positive isolation of specific types of both normal cells and patogenic cells.
      <br/>
      The method creates a linkage between a specific target cell and an insoluble support, such as paramagnetic particles, which consists of one or two elements.
      <br/>
      The particle is either coated with an anti-cell antibody of murine or human origin, directed to the specific antigen determinants in the membranes of the wanted target-cells, or the particles are coated with a polyclonal anti-mouse or anti-human antibody capable of binding to the Fc-portions of the specific anti-cell antibody directed to the antigen determinants in the target-cell membranes.
      <br/>
      Instead of using the polyclonal anti-mouse/anti-human antibody for coating the particles, a monoclonal rat anti-mouse/anti-human antibody may be used.
      <br/>
      This last antibody, due partly to its monoclonal origin, may provide a more specific binding to the anti-cell antibody and reduce the risk for possible cross-reactions with other cells in solutions, such as blood.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, incubation of the cell suspension with a mild detergent and/or second set of antibodies or antibody fragments, prelabeled or not with fluorescent agents, metallocolloids, radioisotopes, biotin-complexes or certain enzymes allowing visualization, will dramatically increase the specificity of the method.
    </p>
    <p num="12">
      In the following a more detailed disclosure of the method is presented, using cancer cells as the target-cells for detection and possible isolation.
      <br/>
      The method is, however, not limited to cancer cells and the disclosure shall not limit the method to this particular field of use, since the method is suitable within a range of cytological research areas.
    </p>

      In the management of cancer patients, the staging of the disease with regards to whether it is localized or if metastatic spread has occurred to other tissues, is of utmost importance for the choice of therapeutic alternative for the individual patient.
      <br/>
      Malignant cells spread by direct invasion into the surrounding tissue, through the lymphatics or by the distribution of tumor cells in the blood to distant organs, including the bone marrow and the central nervous system and the cerebrospinal fluid.
    </p>
    <p num="14">
      Detection of metastatic tumor cells has, until recently, relied on morphological methods using light and electron microscopy on biopsied tumor specimens, on smears of bone marrow and peripheral blood, and on slides prepared after cytosentrifugation of various body fluids.
      <br/>
      Since the advent of monoclonal antibodies recognising antigens predominantly expressed on the surface of different types of malignant cells, the identification of metastatic cells has, to an increasing extent, also involved immunocytochemistry and immunofluorescence.
      <br/>
      Thus, slides prepared from biopsied tumors or cytosentrifugates have been treated with monoclonal antibodies, and the binding of these to the tumor cells is visualized colorimetrically or by fluorescence.
      <br/>
      The latter method requires the use of a fluorescence microscope, alternatively preparing a cellsuspension an use a flow cytometer.
    </p>
    <p num="15">
      The previous methods suffer from limited sensitivity and/or specificity, and is usually laborious and time consuming, also requiring a high degree of expertise.
      <br/>
      Flowcytometric examinations also involve expensive equipment.
    </p>
    <p num="16">
      The morphological methods for the detection of tumor cells in blood and bone marrow are much less sensitive than methods involving immunocytochemistry and immunofluorescence (Beiske et al., Am. J. Pathology 141 (3), September 1992).
      <br/>
      Also the latter methods are, however, inadequate in cases where the tumor cells represent less than 1% of the total number of nucleated cells.
      <br/>
      Flow cytometry may provide better sensitivity than the methods involving the use of a microscope, but requires the availability of a high number of cells, and also involves several technical difficulties.
      <br/>
      Thus, aggregation of cells may cause problems, and the method does not provide possibilities to distinguish between labeled tumor cells and unspecifically fluorescing normal cells.
    </p>
    <p num="17">
      The invention allows for a very sensitive detection of, for example, metastatic tumor cells, since a high number of cells can readily be screened in the microscope and the attached magnetic beads are easily recognisable.
      <br/>
      The monoclonal antibodies used bind with sufficient specificity to, for example, tumor cells and not to other cells than the target-cells present in mixed cell suspensions, like blood, bone marrow, and in other tumor manifestations, such that all cells with attached beads represent the target-cells.
      <br/>
      In addition, the procedure is rapid and simple, and can be performed by any investigator with access to a conventional microscope.
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      The novel method involves the binding of monoclonal antibodies, e.g. of murine or human origin, that specifically recognize antigens present on tumor cells, and not on the normal cells in question, or for other purposes to specified subpopulations of normal cells, to paramagnetic particles, either directly or to beads first covered with antibodies specifically recognizing the respective antibodies, or the Fc-portion of IgG antibodies, that bind to the tumor cells.
      <br/>
      The cell binding antibodies may be of the IgG or IgM type or being a fragment of ab IgG or IgM.
      <br/>
      Examples of used anti-target-cell antibodies may be those directed against groups of antigen determinants, for example CD56/NCAM antigen (MOC-1), Cluster 2 epithelial antigen (MOC-31), Cluster 2 (MW.about.40 kD) antigen (NrLu10) (Myklebust et al.
      <br/>
      Br. J. Cancer Suppl. 63, 49-53, 1991), HMW-melanoma-associated antigen (9.2, 27) (Morgan et al., Hybridoma, 1, 27-36, 1981), 80 kD, Sarcoma-associated antigen (TP1 &amp; TP3) (Cancer Res. 48, 5302-5309, 1988), mucin antigens (Diel et al., Breast Cancer Res.
      <br/>
      Treatm., 1991), or EGF-receptor antigen (425.3) (Merck), in addition to the anti-pan-human antibody (Bruland et al., unpublished), which is suitable for detecting human cells among animal cells.
      <br/>
      The 425.3 antibody is directed towards antigens in both normal and malignant cells.
      <br/>
      Antibodies can furthermore be directed against growth factor receptors, for example EGF-receptor, PDGF (A and B) receptor, insuline receptor, insuline-like receptor, transferrin receptor, NGF and FGF receptors, group of integrins, other adhesion membrane molecules and MDR proteins in both normal cells and abnormal cells, and antigens present on subpopulations of normal cells, in addition to oncogenic products, expressed on the membranes of normal and malignant cells and on malignant cells alone, for example Neu/erb B2/HER2.
      <br/>
      As for the malignant cells, these may be breast, ovarian and lung carcinoma cells, melanoma, sarcoma, glioblastoma, cancer cells of the gastrointestinal tract and the reticuloendothelial system, or the target-cells may be associated with non-neoplastic diseases, such as cardiovascular, neurological, pulmonary, autoimmune, gastrointestial, genitourinary, reticuloendothelial and other disorders.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, the malignant cell population may be located in bone marrow, peripheral blood, come from pleural and peritoneal effusions and other body fluid compartments, such as urine, cerebrospinal fluid, semen, lymph or from solid tumors in normal tissues and organs, for example liver, lymph nodes, spleen, lung, pancreas, bone tissue, the central nervous system, prostatic gland, skin and mucous membranes.
      <br/>
      A more complete list of the antigen determinants and the corresponding antibodies or antibody fragments used in the present improved method is presented in Table 1.
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      The method comprises attachment of the antibodies directly to the paramagnetic particles, or the attachment can take place by attachment to surface-bound antibodies, such as polyclonal anti-mouse antibodies, monoclonal rat anti-mouse antibodies or monoclonal anti-human antibodies, specifically recognizing the Fc-portion of the said individual antibodies.
      <br/>
      The antibody-coated paramagnetic beads are then mixed with the suspension of cells to be examined and incubated for 5-10 min to 2 h, preferably for 30 min at 0-25 (degree)  C., preferably at 4 (degree)  C., under gentle rotation.
      <br/>
      The present method may also be performed in a changed order of steps, in that the free target-cell antibodies are added to the cell suspension, incubated for 5-10 min to 2 h, preferably 30 min, at 0-20 (degree)  C., preferably 4 (degree)  C., under gentle rotation.
      <br/>
      The paramagnetic particles, precoated with anti-mouse or anti-human antibodies are then added to the incubated cell suspension, as described above, and the resulting suspension subjected to a further incubation of 5-10 min to 2 h, preferably 30 min, at 0-25 (degree)  C., preferably 4 (degree)  C. under gentle agitation.
    </p>
    <p num="20">
      Samples of the cell suspension are then transferred to a cell counting device, and the fraction of cells with attached beads relative to the total number of cells is determined under light microscopy.
      <br/>
      The number of antibody-coated beads added to the cell suspension should be between 0.5-10 times the number of target cells.
      <br/>
      When this number is unknown, the amount of coated beads added should be 1-10% of the total number of cells.
    </p>
    <p num="21">
      For specific purposes, and in the cases where the density of the target-cells is low, for example malignant cells, or the target-cells represent a very low fraction of the total number of cells ( &lt;= 1%), the target cells can be positively separated from non-target cells in a magnetic field.
      <br/>
      The isolated target cells, can then be enumerated microscopically and the fraction of target cells relative to the total number of cells in the initial cell suspension can be calculated.
      <br/>
      Moreover, the target-cells may be characterized for the presence of specific biochemical and biological features.
      <br/>
      Of particular importance will be the use of such cells for studies in molecular biology.
      <br/>
      In contrast to the above cited methods of the prior art, the present method allows studies and growth of the target-cells without performing a cleavage of the paramagnetic particle-target cell linkage.
      <br/>
      For several purposes it is of interest to examine specific genes in a pure population of target cells at the DNA, mRNA and protein level, both in tumor biopsies as well as in tumor cells present in blood, bone marrow and other body fluids, for example urine, cerebrospinal fluid, semen, lymph, or from otherwise normal tissues and organs, for example liver, lymph nodes, spleen, lung, pancreas, bone tissues, central nervous system, prostatic gland, skin and mucous membranes, and in other areas of cytological research activity.
    </p>
    <p num="22">
      With the methods of prior art, signals obtained on Southern, Northern and Western blots represent the normal cells as well as the tumor cells in the biopsy.
      <br/>
      If a single cell suspension is first prepared from the tumor material, and the tumor cells are then positively immunomagnetically detected and separated, any gene studies performed on this material would represent the target-cells only.
      <br/>
      This also relates to for example malignant cells present in mammalian tissues, for example in bone marrow, peripheral blood, pleural and peritoneal effusions, and other body fluids, for example urine, cerebrospinal fluid, semen and lymph.
      <br/>
      Studies involving polymerase chain reaction (PCR) methodology will also gain in specificity and reliability when performed on pure tumor cell populations obtained by the new method.
    </p>
    <p num="23">The application of the new method steps may differ depending on type of tissues to be examined.</p>
    <p num="24">
      a) Tissue from solid or needle tumor biopsies is prepared mechanically or with mild enzymatic treatment into a single cell suspension, to which the primary, specific antibodies or antibody fragments are added directly or after washing the cell suspension with phosphate buffered saline or culture medium with or without serum, such as fetal calf serum, bovine, horse, pig, goat or human serum.
      <br/>
      b) If the material is a sample of pleural or ascitic effusion, cerebrospinal fluid, urine, lymph or body fluids such as effusions in the joints of patients with various forms of arthritis, the specific antibodies or antibody fragments are either added to the samples directly, or after centrifugation with or without washings before or after the cells in the samples are spun down and brought back into suspension.
      <br/>
      c) If the material consists of blood or bone marrow aspirate, the mononuclear cell fraction is isolated by gradient sentrifugation on e.g. Lymphoprep before washing, resuspension, and addition of the appropriate antibodies or antibody fragments.
    </p>
    <p num="25">The procedure conditions for a) and b) are established, as exemplified by results obtained in successful experiments as those described below.</p>
    <p num="26">
      For c) the results have been found to be influenced by a high number of factors which have been examined in detail.
      <br/>
      Among these are antibody concentration, the ratio of the number of paramagnetic particles versus number of cells, incubation times and volumes, type of incubation medium, and the pH level.
      <br/>
      The particle to mononuclear cell ratio in all experiments should be in the range of 0.5/1-2/1, depending on the binding affinity of the primary specific antibodies or fragments.
    </p>
    <p num="27">
      A major problem has been unspecific attachment to normal blood or bone marrow cells of particles coated with either sheep or rat anti-mouse antibodies alone, or in addition with the specific antibodies.
      <br/>
      Experiments have shown that the unspecific binding is equally high without the presence of the specific antibodies, indicating that the problem is not caused by cross-reactivity of the targeting antibodies to normal cells.
      <br/>
      The possibility that the less than optimal specificity could be caused by ionic binding has been ruled out.
      <br/>
      Another possibility was that subpopulations of normal cells of the B-lineage might adhere to the particle-antibody complexes.
      <br/>
      However, immunomagnetic removal of B-cells from the cell suspension before adding the specific antibodies/antibody-particle complexes did not improve the specificity of the latter.
    </p>
    <p num="28">
      The problem with the procedure used on isolated mononuclear fractions of bone marrow and peripheral bllod, that some non-target cells might also bind paramagnetic particles, has been circumvented or overcome.
      <br/>
      Thus with sheep-anti-mouse antibody coated particles alone or with specific antibodies the number of particles unspecifically attached to a low fraction mononuclear blood of bone marrow cells was reduced from an average of 10 to about 1 and in paralell the fraction of normal cells with particles decreased from 1-2% to 0.5-1% or less.
    </p>
    <p num="29">
      Evidence has been obtained that the problem may be caused by hydrophobic forces associated with the antibodies bound to the paramagnetic particles.
      <br/>
      Methods for reducing this hydrophobicity is thus claimed.
      <br/>
      One such method is preincubation of the antibody-coated particles and the cell suspension with mild detergents in suitable concentrations, for example Tween 20 (tm)  in concentrations of less than 0.1% for 30 minutes at 4 (degree)  C. When possible selection of the target cells is warrented, the cell suspension should contain a low concentration of the detergent, e.g. 0.01% of Tween 20 (tm) . In several experiments this procedure has almost eliminated or dramatically reduced the problem of unspecific binding seen with the mononuclear cell fractions from blood or bone marrow.
    </p>
    <p num="30">The other improvement which, if found warrantied, may be used together with the detergent step as follows:</p>
    <p num="31">
      After incubation of the cell suspension with the primary antibodies or antibody fragments and the antibody-coated paramagnetic particles as described in previously, the cell suspension is incubated with a second set of antibodies or antibody fragments directed against other extracellular or against intracellular determinants of the target cells, with our without pretreatment with cell fixatives such as formaldehyde or alcohols.
      <br/>
      These antibodies or their fragments should have been prelabeled by fluorescent agents, metallocolloids, radioisotopes, biotin-complexes or enzymes like peroxidase and alkaline phosphatase, allowing visualization by per se known methods in the microscope and/or a suitable counting device.
    </p>
    <p num="32">The target cells will both be visualized with the latter method and have bound particles to their surface, and can thus be enumerated.</p>
    <p num="33">To simplify the distinction between non-target and target cells, the cell suspension can before the second visualization step either be subjected to cytospin centrifugation or portions of the suspension are attached to caoted glass slides on which the particle-bound cells will be spread out in a thin layer, facilitating the recognition of the double-"stained" cells.</p>
    <p num="34">
      For use in the new procedure, kits will contain for example precoated paramagnetic particles prepared for each monoclonal antibody.
      <br/>
      In another embodiment the kits contain paramagnetic particles pre-coated with IgG isotype specific anti-mouse or anti-human antibody as one part of it, and different target cell-associated, for example tumor cell, antibodies as another part.
      <br/>
      In a third embodiment the kit contains paramagnetic particles precoated with specific anti-Fc antibodies, such as polyclonal anti-mouse, or monoclonal rat anti-mouse, or anti-mouse, or anti-human antibodies, capable of binding to the Fc-portion the target-cell associating antibodies, bound to specific anti-target-cell antibodies.
      <br/>
      In a further embodiment the kit contains other specific antibodies or antibody fragments directed against antigens/receptors within or on the wanted target-cells, where said antibodies or antibody fragments are conjugated to peroxidase, alkaline phosphatase, or other enzymes, together with relevant substrates to such enzymes, or where said antibody or antibody fragment is bound to non-paramagnetic particles with specific colours or with bound enzymes such as peroxidase and alkaline phosphatase.
    </p>
    <p num="35">
      The present method will in the following be illustrated by model experiments, examples of the usefulness of the new method and examples of practical applications.
      <br/>
      These examples shall not be regarded as in any way limiting the invention.

      Binding of antibody-based complexes to tumor cell lines with the new procedure
    </p>
    <p num="38">
      To determine antibody concentrations and optimal conditions for the binding of antibody-paramagnetic particle complexes to tumor cells, a large panel of cancer cell lines was used.
      <br/>
      The paramagnetic beads were bound to the cells, either by coating the specific antibodies to sheep-anti-mouse antibody (SAM)-coated paramagnetic particles, or by first incubating the cells with the specific antibodies, washing, followed by a second incubation with SAM-coated particles.
      <br/>
      The results of these experiments are given in Tables 2a and 2b, in which + indicates binding of several beads to all cells, (+) indicates either a lower number of beads bound to each cell, or that not all the tumor cells had beads attached to their surface, whereas - reflects no binding, and (-) indicates very weak binding.
    </p>
    <p num="39">
      2. For detection of tumor cells in the mononuclear fraction of bone marrow or peripheral blood, model experiments were performed where specific antibodies and SAM-coated paramagnetic particles were added either to such mononuclear cells or to a cell suspension where a different number of cancer cells from in vitro cultivated cell lines were added to said mononuclear cells.
      <br/>
      In some experiments, either the mononuclear cells, or the malignant cells were prestained with a fluorescent dye, to be able to distinguish beteween the two types of cells.
      <br/>
      In all experiments, non-binding primary antibodies, and/or sheep-anti-mouse antibody-coated beads were used separately as controls.

      In several experiments some unspecific binding to the mononuclear cells was observed, which was found to be unrelated to the nature of the specific antibody, and which was equally pronounced with SAM-coated particles alone.
      <br/>
      The magnitude of this unspecific binding varied from almost 0 to a level between 0.5-2%. This unspecific binding was almost eliminated by mild treatment with detergent, (Tween 20) performed to reduce the problem of hydrophobic cell interactions.

    <heading>EXAMPLES OF THE USEFULNESS OF THE NEW PROCEDURE</heading>
    <p num="43">
      1.
      <br/>
      Detection of micrometastic neoplastic disease in blood and marrow
    </p>
    <p num="44">
      Early and reliable diagnosis of spread of cancer cells to blood and/or bone marrow has become increasingly important for the choice of optimal therapy, possibly curative in many types of cancer, including carcinomas, as described in application Example 1.
      <br/>
      Similar procedures for malignant melanoma, sarcoma, neuroblastoma and several other cancers have been established or are under development.
    </p>
    <p num="45">2. Detection of malignant cells in pleural or ascitic effusions, and in urine</p>
    <p num="46">
      The nature of such effusions may represent an important diagnostic problem, particularly when a low number of cancer cells are present together with normal reactive or epithelial cells.
      <br/>
      In several cases a definite diagnosis has been rapidly made with the new method, in cases where conventional cytological examination has been negative or inconclusive.
      <br/>
      A similar advantage can be found in cases of cancer in the kidneys or in the urinary tract and bladder.
    </p>
    <p num="47">3. Detection of neoplastic cells in the cerebrospinal fluid</p>
    <p num="48">
      As the systemic treatment of many cancer types have improved, the frequency of cases with symptom-giving brain metastases have significantly increased, and in parallell with this, the necessity for early detection of such spread.
      <br/>
      With the use of the new procedure even a low number of malignant cells can easily be identified, permitting intervention with therapeutic alternatives at an early stage of intracranial tumor manifestations.
    </p>
    <p num="49">4. Diagnosis of cancer in biopsied tissue</p>
    <p num="50">When cancer is suspected, and tissue biopsies are obtained by surgical procedures or by e.g. needle biopsies, a much more simple and rapid diagnosis can be made with the new method, used on prepared cell suspensions, compared to conventional morphological or immunohisto- or cytochemical procedures.</p>
    <p num="51">Distinction between several alternative cancers can be made by the use of the appropriate antibodies.</p>
    <p num="52">5. Identification of prognostic indicators</p>
    <p num="53">Since the expression of several membrane molecules have been shown to correlate with progression of the malignant disease in several cancers, the present method can be used to identify prognostic indicators, for example as described in application Example 2.</p>
    <p num="54">6. Identification of cells indicative of specific diseases or of disease progression or state</p>
    <p num="55">
      In various types of rheumatoid diseases (such as rheumatoid arthritis), as well as in allergic, autoimmune, and cardiovascular diseases, identification of the systemic or local presence of specific subpopulations of cells is important for diagnosis and for determining the stage of the disease.
      <br/>
      Rapid detection of such cell populations with the new method is therefore of considerable diagnostic and therapeutic importance.
    </p>
    <p num="56">7. Detection of subpopulations of normal cells</p>
    <p num="57">
      For several purposes, it will be important to detect the fraction of a particular subpopulation of normal cells in a population.
      <br/>
      This applies e.g. to liver biopsies where the identification of cells expressing the biliar epithelial antigen, may be of importance.
      <br/>
      Similarly, the identification, and possible isolation of specific endothelial cells from a cell suspension prepared from various normal tissues may be warranted.
    </p>
    <p num="58">
      Several of the cell membrane molecules mentioned in sections 1-6 may also be used as targets for immunotherapy with several types of activiated killer cells or e.g. with immunotoxins.
      <br/>
      The identification with the new method of expression of such molecules is, therefore, also of value for determining in which cases such types of therapy should be used.
    </p>
    <heading>EXAMPLES OF A PRACTICAL APPLICATION OF THE METHOD</heading>
    <p num="59">Example 1</p>
    <p num="60">
      To diagnose spread of cancer cells in blood and/or bone marrow at an early stage, we have used in the new procedure the MOC-31, NrLu10, BM2, BM7, 12H12, and MLuCl anti-carcinoma antibodies to determine whether or not micrometastatic disease from breast, lung, colorectal, and prostate cancer might be sensitively identified in such body fluids.
      <br/>
      The successful results with these antibodies have significant clinical implications.
    </p>
    <p num="61">Example 2</p>
    <p num="62">
      The expression of serveral cell membrane molecules have been shown to correlate with progression of the malignant disease in several types of cancer.
      <br/>
      The detection of binding of such antibodies to respective antibodies can therefore be used to obtain information of high prognostic value.
      <br/>
      Among such antigens are a high number of adhesion molecules, carbohydrate antigens, glycolipids, growth factor receptors and carcinoma markers listed below.
      <br/>
      We have, with the new procedure identified the binding of particle-antibody complexes to CD44-variants, E-cadherin, Ley, CEA, EGF-r, transferrin receptor, MUC-1 epitope, LUBCRU-G7 epitope, prostate cancer antigen, UJ13A epitope,  BETA 2 -microglobulin, HLA-antigens, and apoptosis receptor.
    </p>
    <p num="63">Example 3</p>
    <p num="64">
      Two liters or pleural diffusion from a patient supposed to suffer from malignant melanoma was obtained.
      <br/>
      After centrifugation, the cells were suspended in a volume of 2 ml of RPMI with a 10% fetal calf serum, incubated with 9.2.27 anti-melanoma antibody (10  MU g/ml) at 4 (degree)  C. for 30 min, washed and again incubated with Dynabeads (tm)  SAM M450/IgG2A at 4 (degree)  C. for 30 min.
      <br/>
      The cell suspension was then examined under a microscope for determining the fraction of cells with paramagnetic cells attached to their surface.
      <br/>
      The diagnosis of malignant melanoma was confirmed, as about 10% of the cells had a significant number of particles rosettes.
    </p>
    <p num="65">Example 4</p>
    <p num="66">
      Biopsied tissue was obtained from a subcutaneous tumor in a case with clinical indications of either small cell lung cancer or a malignant melanoma.
      <br/>
      A single cell suspension was prepared from the biopsy, divided in 2 fractions, one incubated with the 9.2.27 anti-melanoma antibody, and the other with MOC-31 anti-carcinoma antibody (both at 10  MU g/ml).
      <br/>
      The incubation was similar to that used in the example above.
      <br/>
      None of the cells incubated with the melanoma antibody bound any beads, whereas all tumor cells incubated with MOC-31 were positive.
    </p>
    <p num="67">Example 5</p>
    <p num="68">
      Biopsied tissue from a patient suspected to have malignant melanoma was examined by preparing single cell suspension, incubating with 9.2.27 anti-melanoma antibody, and then following the procedure as above.
      <br/>
      Most of the cells were positive with a high number of particle-rosettes attached to their membranes.
    </p>
    <p num="69">Example 6</p>
    <p num="70">
      A pleural effusion from a breast cancer patient was studied to examine whether tumor cells could be detected in the fluid.
      <br/>
      One liter of the fluid was centrifuged, the cells resuspended, and in separate vials incubate with each of 3 different anti-carcinoma antibodies (MOC-31, 2E11, 12H12).
      <br/>
      After completing the procedure as in the previous example, it was found that most of the cells bound to antibody-coated particles in all 3 cases.
    </p>
    <p num="71">Example 7</p>
    <p num="72">
      A bone marrow suspension obtained from a breast cancer patient was studied to examine whether micrometastic tumor cells could be present.
      <br/>
      After the preparation of mononuclear cells, these were incubated with the same 3 anti-carcinoma antibodies used in the example above, but in this case the antibodies were first attached to Dynabeads (tm)  SAM IgG paramagnetic particles.
      <br/>
      After 1 incubation with these directly coated particles, the cell suspension was examined in the microscope, and a high number of cells were found positive with a number of particle-rosettes attached to their membrane.
    </p>
    <p num="73">Similar experiments have been performed in a number of pleural or ascitic effusion and bone marrow from patients with breast cancer.</p>
    <p num="74">Example 8</p>
    <p num="75">
      T47D human breast carcinoma cells were incubated for varying lenghts of time with Hoechst fluorescence dye, and the viability of the labeled cells was checked.
      <br/>
      Varying numbers of labeled breast carcinoma cells were then added to 1 * 106 bone marrow cells obtained from healthy volunteers.
      <br/>
      In different experiments, different concentrations of paramagnetic, monodisperse particles (Dynabeads (tm)  P450) coated with individual anticarcinoma antibodies (NrLu10, MOC31, or 12H12) were added.
      <br/>
      After incubation for 30 min on ice, samples of the different test tubes were examined in a counting chamber under light and fluorescence microscopy.
      <br/>
      When the ratio of tumor cells/total nucleated cells was low, the cell suspension was subjected to a magnetic field and the cells with particles attached were isolated before examined in the microscope.
      <br/>
      It was found that at an optimal ratio of 1-10 paramagnetic beads per tumor cell in the cell mixture, all the tumor cells had from 2-15 beads attached to their surface.
      <br/>
      The sensitivity of the detection method was close to one target-cell per 104 nucleated cells.
      <br/>
      In control experiments with labeled tumor cells using antibodies known to have some cross-reativity to normal cells, this cross-reactivity was confirmed with the antibody-coated paramagnetic particles.
      <br/>
      In experiments with beads without tumor-associated antibody coating, none of the target cells bound any beads.
    </p>
    <p num="76">
      Similar experiments have been performed both with other breast cancer lines and a small cell lung cancer cell line.
      <br/>
      Similar sensitivity and specificity were obtained in these experiments.
    </p>
    <p num="77">Example 9</p>
    <p num="78">
      Pleural and ascites fluid from patients with breast cancer and ovarian carcinoma were sentrifuged, the same coated paramagnetic particles used in Example 1 were added, incubated and concentrated in a magnetic field before the suspension was examined under light microscopy.
      <br/>
      Typically, cells that had the clear morphological features of tumor cells had beads attached, whereas none of the few normal cells bound the antibody-coated beads.
      <br/>
      In two cases with pleural effusion, an independent morphological examination did not reveal the presence of any tumor cells, whereas a significant number malignant cells were detected by the use of anibody-coated beads.
      <br/>
      In some cases, tumor cells were separated in a magnetic field and transferred to tissue culture flasks containing growth medium specially prepared for growing breast cancer cells, in attempts to establish permanent cell lines from these cultures.
      <br/>
      In parallel, cells from the malignant effusions were cultivated directly without positive selection with magnetic beads.
      <br/>
      In the latter cases, no cell line could be established, whereas in more than 50% of the cases where positively selected tumor cells had been used, cell lines were successfully established.
    </p>
    <p num="79">Example 10</p>
    <p num="80">
      In some cases, bone marrow and peripheral blood obtained from patients with breast cancer were examined with the present procedure by adding antibody-coated paramagnetic beads, incubating for 30 min at 4 (degree)  C. and concentrating in a magnetic field and by examining the suspension under light microscopy.
      <br/>
      In both cases binding of the paramagnetic beads to tumor cells, representing 0.1-1% of the nucleated cells in the bone marrow and blood was detected, cells that could not be identified by any other method.
    </p>
    <p num="81">Example 11</p>
    <p num="82">
      Antibodies against certain growth factor receptors or other gene products expressed on the surface of specific cell populations may be used to identify and positively select these cells.
      <br/>
      Beads coated with anti-transferring receptor antibodies, used in the novel method according to the present invention were shown to represent a rapid, simple and sensitive method for identification of cells expressing the transferrin-receptor.
