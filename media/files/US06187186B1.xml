    </p>
    <heading>DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
    <p num="8">
      A device for introducing substances into water has a housing which is identified with reference numeral 1.
      <br/>
      It is connectable with a water source, for example with a pipeline by a nut 2 with an inner thread and a fixing bushing 3 which is shown in more detail in FIG. 3.
      <br/>
      The nut 2 is fixed to the housing 1 by a threaded flange 4 which has an inner hexagonal cross-section and is provided with an outer seal 6.
      <br/>
      The housing 1 has a first chamber which is identified with reference numeral 7, a partition 8, and a second chamber 9.
      <br/>
      The partition 8 separates the chambers 7 and 9 from each other and has a central opening.
      <br/>
      The housing 1 has an outer threaded portion 10 for attachment of a showerhead or any other consumer device.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      The housing has two throughgoing openings 11 and 12 which are located at both sides of the partition 8.
      <br/>
      Each opening 11 and 12 is provided with an annular recess 13.
      <br/>
      Seals 14 formed for example as O-rings are located in the recesses 13.
      <br/>
      The device further has a threaded flange 15 which is connected to the housing 1 turnably via a pin 16.
      <br/>
      Two pins 17 shown in FIG. 2 extend from the flange 15 and engage in grooves 18 which are provided in an inner part of the housing 1.
      <br/>
      The upper wall of the flange 15 also has two flange openings 19 and 20.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      Reference numeral 21 identifies a container with a substance to be introduced into water.
      <br/>
      It has an outer thread 22 with which it is screwed into the inner thread of the flange 15 and sealed by a seal 23.
      <br/>
      The flange 15 is turnable around an axis of the flange between an operative position in which the flange openings 19 and 20 coincide with the throughgoing housing openings 11 and 12 so that water flows from the first chamber 7 into the container 21, is mixed in the container with the substance, and then the mixture flows into the second chamber 9 and to a consumer.
      <br/>
      The flange 15 can be turned to an inoperative position in which the openings 19 and 20 do not coincide with the openings 11 and 12, so that there is no communication between the chambers 7 and 9 and the interior of the container 21.
    </p>
    <p num="11">
      A control member 24 is arranged in the opening of the partition 8.
      <br/>
      It can be formed for example as a diagram shown in FIG. 4.
      <br/>
      When water flows through an opening of the diaphragm 24, a resistance is provided so that a pressure difference is produced between the first chamber 7 and the second chamber 9.
      <br/>
      This difference depends on the size of the opening 25 of the diaphragm.
      <br/>
      On the other hand, a flow rate and concentration of the solution from the container 21 depends from the pressure difference between the chambers 7 and 9.
      <br/>
      Since water systems have various pressures, the pressure difference between the chamber 7 and 9 can be very high if the opening in the partition between the chambers is constant, and at low pressures the pressure difference can drop to zero so that there will be no supply of the solution, while in the conditions of high pressure difference the solution will be immediately washed out from the container.
    </p>
    <p num="12">
      The diaphragm 24 is composed of elastic material, for example rubber, and its hardness is selected experimentally so as to control the pressure difference.
      <br/>
      When there is a high water supply pressure, the opening 25 of the diaphragm opens so as to increase a water flow rate, while in condition of low water supply pressure the opening 25 of the diaphragm narrows so as to maintain the pressure difference.
    </p>
    <p num="13">
      The device in accordance with the present invention is very convenient for installation in a shower system since it provides a convenient location of the container 21 for the user.
      <br/>
      For this purpose the nut 2 is utilized in combination with the bushing 3 which is formed as a plastic or rubber bushing and simultaneously forms a seal and a fixator.
      <br/>
      The fixation is provided by the polygonal (for example hexagonal) cross-section of the end of the bushing 3 which is inserted into the inner polygon of the flange 5, so that the housing can not turn any longer on the pipeline.
    </p>
    <p num="14">
      The seals 14 arranged in the recesses 13 of the throughgoing housing openings 11 and 12 prevent leaks between the flange 15 of the container 21 and the housing 1.
      <br/>
      Therefore, a reliable tightness and a simple manufacture are guaranteed.
      <br/>
      It is to be understood that the seals 14 can be instead arranged in the flange openings 19 and 20.
    </p>
    <p num="15">
      When the device is used for technical purposes, it is necessary to prevent a backflow of the substance into the pipeline.
      <br/>
      FIG. 5 shows another embodiment of the present invention.
      <br/>
      In accordance with this embodiment, the partition between the chambers 7 and 9 has a cylindrical opening 27 and a conical opening portion 28.
      <br/>
      The control member 29 is arranged in the conical opening portion 28 and is spring-biased by a spring 30.
      <br/>
      A perforated further partition 31 provided with openings 32 is located in the region of an outlet 34 of the housing 1.
    </p>
    <p num="16">
      When water enriched with the substance flows out of the housing 1, the control member 29 which is formed as a conical member deviates from the conical opening portion 28 so as to form a gap therebetween to allow water to flow from the chamber 7 into the chamber 9, and thereafter through the openings 32 of the partition 31, while the solution of the water with the substance flows from the container 21 through the aligned openings 19 and 12.
      <br/>
      In the event of a back pressure, the control member 29 is firmly pressed against the conical opening portion 28 so that the opening 27 between the chambers 7 and 9 is closed, and also the throughgoing housing opening 12 is closed as well.
      <br/>
      As a result, the solution can not flow back into the chamber 7 neither from the chamber 9 nor from the container 21.
    </p>
    <p num="17">
      In the embodiment of FIGS. 6 and 7 a housing 41 having openings 42 and 43 is connected immovably with a flange 44 which has openings 45 and 46.
      <br/>
      A slider 47 provided with openings 48 and 49 is turnable around an axis which is perpendicular to the axis of the flange between an operative position in which the openings 42, 45, 48 and 43, 46, 49 coincide with one another to provide throughgoing flows, and an inoperative position in which the openings 48 and 49 are angularly displaced and a material of the slider 47 interrupts the communication between the openings 42, 45 and 43, 46 correspondingly.
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      The device in accordance with the embodiment shown in FIG. 8 substantially corresponds to the device of the embodiment of FIGS. 6, 7.
      <br/>
      The only difference here is that in the device shown in FIG. 8 the slider 47' is not turnable, but instead is translatorily displaceable between the operative and inoperative position.
    </p>
    <p num="19">It will be understood that each of the elements described above, or two or more together, may also find a useful application in other types of constructions differing from the types described above.</p>
    <p num="20">While the invention has been illustrated and described as embodied in device for introducing substances into water, it is not intended to be limited to the details shown, since various modifications and structural changes may be made without departing in any way from the spirit of the present invention.</p>
    <p num="21">Without further analysis, the foregoing will so fully reveal the gist of the present invention that others can, by applying current knowledge, readily adapt it for various applications without omitting features that, from the standpoint of prior art, fairly constitute essential characteristics of the generic or specific aspects of this invention.</p>
