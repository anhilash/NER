      <br/>
      Field of the Invention
    </p>
    <p num="3">
      The present invention is in the field of building systems, and more particularly, pertains to a plurality of interconnecting members which secure in a rigid and stable manner without the use of fasteners, adhesives, or the like, which are easily assembled and disassembled without the need for tools.
      <br/>
      Building system members can be made in any number of sizes and scales allowing building systems to create life size playhouses, utility sheds, bins and various other toy and play scale structures.
      <br/>
      The building systems are designed to be safely and easily used by adults and children alike.
    </p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="4">The general purpose of the present invention are building systems which do not require the use of fasteners, adhesives, or tools.</p>
    <p num="5">
      According to one embodiment of the present invention, there is provided a plurality of intermediate members, having upper and lower beveled portions, four notches, a tongue joint, a groove joint, larger inbound shoulders and smaller outbound shoulders.
      <br/>
      There are also provided upper and lower members which are constructed using the same principles as the intermediate portions with many like features.
    </p>
    <p num="6">One significant aspect and feature of the present invention are the various means of interlocking member ends in ways that create rigid and sturdy structures.</p>
    <p num="7">Another significant aspect and feature of the present invention are the various means of interlocking member edges for added stability.</p>
    <p num="8">A further significant aspect and feature of the present invention is smaller outbound shoulders than inbound shoulder which prevents damage during assembly and disassembly.</p>
    <p num="9">An additional significant aspect and feature of the present invention are the unlimited structure configurations using the building systems.</p>
    <p num="10">Still another significant aspect and feature of the present invention is the ability to use wood, plastic or metal in construction.</p>
    <p num="11">
      Yet another significant aspect and feature of the present invention are building systems which requires no tools for assembling.
      <br/>
      Components are reuseable to create other structures.
    </p>
    <p num="12">Having thus described embodiments of the present invention, it is the principal object of the present invention to provide a building system which requires no fasteners or adhesives for securation.</p>
    <p num="13">One object of the present invention is to provide a building system which is easy to assembly by adults and children.</p>
    <p num="14">Another object of the present invention is to provide a portable building system.</p>
    <p num="15">A further object of the present invention is to provide a building system which requires no tools for construction.</p>
    <p num="16">
      An additional object of the present invention is to provide building systems which are easy to breakdown, transport, and store.
      <br/>
      Compact storage for components that can build relatively large and stable structures.
    </p>
    <p num="17">
      Still another object of the present invention is to provide building systems which create useful structures such as, but not limited to retail displays, playhouses, shipping boxes, and camping cabins.
      <br/>
      User-friendly, intuitive, as easy as play for a child.
    </p>
    <p num="18">Other objects of the present invention and many of the attendant advantages of the present invention will be readily appreciated as the same becomes better understood by reference to the following detailed description when considered in connection with the accompanying drawings, in which like reference numerals designate like parts throughout the figures thereof and wherein:</p>

      FIG. 1 illustrates an orthographic view of a building system 10 having lower members 12a and 12b, intermediate members 16a, 16b, 16c, 16d, 16e and 16f, and upper members 18a and 18b, interlocked together via a combination of tongue and groove edge joints and notch end joints.
      <br/>
      The tongue and groove joints lock the top and bottom edges together and the notch joints lock the corners together.
      <br/>
      These joints are further described in FIG. 2.

      FIG. 3 illustrates a front view of the intermediate full height member 16a, and FIG. 4 illustrates an end view of the intermediate full height members 16a-16f.
      <br/>
      With additional reference to FIG. 1 and FIG. 2, the features of intermediate member 16a is now described.
      <br/>
      Member 16b, 16c, 16d, 16e, and 16f are identical to member 16a.
      <br/>
      Intermediate member 16a has two upper beveled portions 22 and 24 which extend upwardly and inwardly from planar portions 34 and 36 and meet at a tongue joint 30.
      <br/>
      Also featured are lower beveled portions 26 and 28 which extend downwardly and inwardly from planar portions 34 and 36 and meet at a groove joint 32.
      <br/>
      The combination of the tongue joint 30 and the groove joint 32 combine to create an interlocking means for the upper and lower surfaces of adjacent intermediate members.
      <br/>
      Notches 38, 40, 42, and 44 create inbound shoulders 46, 48, 50, and 52, outbound shoulders 54, 56, 58 and T-shaped end portions 62 and 64.
      <br/>
      The outbound shoulders 54-60 are smaller than inbound shoulders 46, 48, 50, and 52 to facilitate easy interconnection and prevent the end portions 62 and 64 from damage when connecting and disconnecting the building system 10, without sacrificing the strength and rigidity of the building system 10.

      <br/>
      Notches 106 and 108 create inbound shoulders 110 and 112, outbound shoulders 114 and 116, and end portions 118 and 120.
      <br/>
      The notches 106 and 108 in upper member 18a perpendicularly engage the notches 38 and 42 of intermediate portions 16d and 16b, creating a rigid and stable interconnection.
