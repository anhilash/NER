    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="1">
      1.
      <br/>
      Field of the Invention
    </p>
    <p num="2">
      The present invention relates to a decorative laminated sheet, particularly to a decorative laminated sheet having excellent moldability, a low temperature impact resistance, surface smoothness, colorless transparency and other various properties; the decorative laminated sheet resists becoming cloudy or opaque when embossing or heat sealing.
      <br/>
      The decorative laminated sheet of the present invention is particularly suitable for vacuum press molding, pneumatic press molding and membrane press molding.
    </p>
    <p num="3">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
    <p num="4">
      Conventionally, decorative laminated sheets have been widely used or laminated on metallic or wooden materials such as furniture, cabinets, fittings, desks and cupboards.
      <br/>
      The decorative laminated sheets have been laminated and sealed tightly on adherends having complex contours by the membrane press molding.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      For example, Japanese Patent Publication No. 7-39170 discloses a decorative laminated sheet composed of a substrate layer of a polyvinyl chloride sheet and a transfer film laminated thereon using a laminating method of so-called doubling embossing.
      <br/>
      According to Japanese Patent Publication No. 7-39170, a decorative laminated sheet having stain resistance, scratch resistance and high gloss is provided.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 7-24979 discloses a decorative laminated sheet composed of an opaque polyolefin type resin film and an amorphous polyethylene terephthalate resin film.
      <br/>
      The amorphous film used for the sheet described in Japanese Patent Laid-Open NO. 7-24979 is partially crystalline.
      <br/>
      According to Japanese Patent Laid-Open NO. 7-24979 a decorative laminated sheet having excellent moldability, transparency, weather resistance, stain resistance or the like can be obtained.
    </p>
    <p num="7">However, when the above-mentioned decorative laminated sheets are molded by membrane press molding, vacuum press molding, or pneumatic press molding, the sheet may become cloudy or opaque when embossing or heat sealing.</p>
    <p num="8">
      When membrane press molding, a thermoplastic decorative sheet, which is colored or surface-printed with a desired color and a desired thickness, is heated to approximately the softening point thereof, placed on an adherend having a complex contour such as a door of a kitchen unit, covered with, for example, a rubber sheet and then air or liquid pressure is applied to stick the decorative sheet to the contour.
      <br/>
      Vacuum press molding and pneumatic press molding are based on a same principle of the membrane press molding.
      <br/>
      The former is a molding method with a vacuum pressure using no membrane rubber, and the latter is a molding method utilizing an air pressure.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      The decorative laminated sheet is generally manufactured by a calendar roll method.
      <br/>
      During the manufacture, irregularities, so-called bank marks, are partially produced caused by a nonuniform flow of a peculiarity of the resin on a calendar sheet.
      <br/>
      The irregularities do not cause adverse affects on a practical use, however, they affect the smoothness of the surface, resulting in a damaged appearance.
      <br/>
      In addition, if the line speed is increased when doubling embossing, the bank mark becomes more prominent, thereby reducing productivity.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      Moreover, the decorative laminated sheet tends to crack easily at a low temperature.
      <br/>
      The sheet can crack when handling it in winter.
    </p>
    <p num="11">Furthermore, the sheet composed of the substrate layer of polyvinyl chloride disclosed in the Japanese Patent Publication No. 7-39170 is colored at an early stage, and, due to thermal degradation, is not an especially excellent transparency.</p>
    <p num="12">An object of the present invention is to provide a decorative laminated sheet having excellent moldability, a low temperature impact resistance, surface smoothness, colorless transparency and other various properties; the decorative laminated sheet resists becoming cloudy or opaque when embossing or heat sealing, and is particularly suitable for vacuum press molding, pneumatic press molding and membrane press molding.</p>

    <p num="33">According to the present invention, the (A) completely amorphous polyester type resin described below can be used as the (B) substrate layer.</p>
    <p num="34">
      A thickness of the (B) substrate layer may be determined depending on its usage.
      <br/>
      For example, the thickness is 0.1 to 2 mm, preferably 0.3 to 1.0 mm.
    </p>
    <p num="35">
      The (A) completely amorphous polyester type resin of the present invention does not recrystallize and does not lower its properties even if it is reheated.
      <br/>
      The (A) completely amorphous polyeser type resin has no crystalline components.
      <br/>
      Further, the crystallinity referred to the present invention is a value which is measured in accordance with JIS K7121 (DSC method).
    </p>
    <p num="36">The completely amorphous polyester type resin is preferably manufactured by using mainly, for example, a dicarboxylic acid component such as terephthalic acid or dimethyl terephthalic acid and a diol component such as ethylene glycol to conduct esterification and then polycondensation.</p>
    <p num="37">
      Further, preferably a third component may be copolymerized with the two components used for the above-mentioned completely amorphous polyester to produce a copolymer type completely amorphous polyester type resin,.

      More particularly, the diol components are 60 to 80 mol % of ethylene glycol and 20 to 40 mol % of 1,4 cyclohexane dimethanol.
    </p>
    <p num="38">The completely amorphous polyester type resin may be manufactured according to methods available in the art, such as, for example, the methods disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,340,907.</p>
    <p num="39">
      According to the present invention, when the completely amorphous polyolefin type resin is selected as the (B) substrate layer, the (A) completely amorphous polyester type resin is preferably the copolymer type including the above-mentioned third component.
      <br/>
      This combination inhibits the decorative laminated sheet from becoming cloudy or opaque when embossing or heat sealing.
    </p>
    <p num="40">
      A thickness of the (A) completely amorphous polyester type resin layer is determined depending on its usage.
      <br/>
      For example, the thickness is 0.1 to 2.0 mm, preferably 0.1 to 1.0 mm.
    </p>
    <p num="41">The (B) substrate layer can be laminated on the (A) completely amorphous polyester type resin by conducting a corona treatment (for example, 20 to 200 W/m2 /minute) on the surface of the substrate layer to bond them using typical adhesives, as required.</p>
    <p num="42">The corona treatment can be conducted using known corona discharge treatment device utilizing a vacuum tube system, a thyristor system or the like.</p>
    <p num="43">According to the present invention, when the (B) substrate layer is printed, the (A) completely amorphous polyester type resin layer does not affect the color on the print, and the color is faithfully maintained, with a deep color.</p>
    <p num="44">
      Further, according to the present invention, a transfer foil can be formed on the (A) completely amorphous polyester type resin layer as required.
      <br/>
      The transfer foil can include a print layer for a design, a transparent protective film for protecting the print layer, a top coat layer and the like as known in the art.
      <br/>
      In case of using no transfer foil, embossing is performed on the top of the completely amorphous polyester type resin layer, and ink can be introduced into a concave portion of the emboss.
      <br/>
      A top coat layer can be further formed thereon using a gravure method.
    </p>
    <p num="45">
      Alternatively, in case of using the completely amorphous polyester type resin as the (B) substrate layer, the transfer foil can be formed directly on the (B) substrate layer.
      <br/>
      According to this embodiment, the decorative laminated sheet has a simple two layer construction even if the transfer foil is laminated.
      <br/>
      Thus, the decorative laminated sheet can be manufactured advantageously and cost effectively while maintaining the advantages of the present invention.
    </p>
    <p num="46">In this second embodiment, embossing may be performed on the top of the completely amorphous polyester type resin layer, and the top coat layer can be formed directly thereon using a gravure method.</p>
    <p num="47">A thickness of whole decorative laminated sheet of the present invention is, for example, 0.15 to 2.0 mm, preferably 0.2 to 1.0 mm, but is not especially limited.</p>
