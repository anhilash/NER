    <p num="1">This is a nonprovisional application which claims the benefit of provisional applications U.S. Ser. No. 60/111,079, filed Dec. 4, 1998.</p>
    <heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">
      The present invention is directed to novel 3-substituted-4-arylquinolin-2-one derivatives which are modulators of the large-conductance calcium-activated potassium (BK) channels and, therefore, useful in the protection of neuronal cells and diseases arising from dysfunction of cellular membrane polarization and conductance.
      <br/>
      The present invention also provides a method of treatment with the novel substituted quinolin-2-one derivatives and to pharmaceutical compositions thereof.

    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="3">
      Potassium channels play a key role in regulation of cell membrane potential and modulation of cell excitability.
      <br/>
      Potassium channels are largely regulated by voltage, cell metabolism, calcium and receptor mediated processes. �Cook, N. S., Trends in Pharmacol.
      <br/>
      Sciences (1988), 9, 21; and Quast, U., et al., Trends in Pharmacol.
      <br/>
      Sciences (1989), 10, 431�. Calcium-activated potassium (Kca) channels are a diverse group of ion channels that share a dependence on intracellular calcium ions for activity.
      <br/>
      The activity of KCa channels is regulated by intracellular �Ca2+ �, membrane potential and phosphorylation.
      <br/>
      On the basis of their single-channel conductances in symmetrical K+ solutions, KCa channels are divided into three subclasses: large conductance (BK)&gt;150 pS; intermediate conductance 50-150 pS; small conductance&lt;50 pS.
      <br/>
      Large-conductance calcium-activated potassium (Maxi-K or BK) channels are present in many excitable cells including neurons, cardiac cells and various types of smooth muscle cells. �Singer, J. et al., Pflugers Archiv. (1987) 408,98; Baro, I., et al., Pflugers Archiv. (1989) 414 (Suppl. 1), S168; and Ahmed, F. et al., Br. J. Pharmacol. (1984) 83, 227�.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      Potassium ions play a dominant role in controlling the resting membrane potential in most excitable cells and maintain the transmembrane voltage near the K+ equilibrium potential (Ek) of about -90 mV.
      <br/>
      It has been shown that opening of potassium channels shift the cell membrane potential towards the equilibrium potassium membrane potential (Ek), resulting in hyperpolarization of the cell. �Cook, N. S., Trends in Pharmacol.
      <br/>
      Sciences (1988), 9, 21�. Hyperpolarized cells show a reduced response to potentially damaging depolarizing stimuli.
      <br/>
      BK channels which are regulated by both voltage and intracellular Ca2+ act to limit depolarization and calcium entry and may be particularly effective in blocking damaging stimuli.
      <br/>
      Therefore cell hyperpolarization via opening of BK channels may result in protection of neuronal cells.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      A range of synthetic and naturally occurring compounds with BK opening activity have been reported.
      <br/>
      The avena pyrone extracted from avena sativa-common oats has been identified as a BK channel opener using lipid bi-layer technique �International Patent application WO 93/08800, published May 13, 1993�. 6-Bromo-8-(methylamino) imidazo�1,2-a�pyrazine-2-carbonitrile (SCA-40) has been described as a BK channel opener with very limited electrophysiological experiments �Laurent, F. et al., Br. J. Pharmacol. (1993) 108, 622-626�. The flavanoid, Phloretin has been found to increase the open probability of Ca2+ -activated potassium channels in myelinated nerve fibers of Xenopus laevis using outside-out patches �Koh, D-S., et al., Neuroscience Lett. (1994) 165, 167-170�.

    <heading>BIOLOGICAL ACTIVITY</heading>
    <p num="42">
      Potassium (K+) channels are structurally and functionally diverse families of K+ -selective channel proteins which are ubiquitous in cells, indicating their central importance in regulating a number of key cell functions �Rudy, B., Neuroscience, 25: 729-749 (1988)�. While widely distributed as a class, K+ channels are differentially distributed as individual members of this class or as families. �Gehlert, D. R., et al., Neuroscience, 52: 191-205 (1993)�. In general, activation of K+ channels in cells, and particularly in excitable cells such as neurons and muscle cells, leads to hyperpolarization of the cell membrane, or in the case of depolarized cells, to repolarization.
      <br/>
      In addition to acting as an endogenous membrane voltage clamp, K+ channels can respond to important cellular events such as changes in the intracellular concentration of ATP or the intracellular concentration of calcium (Ca2+).
      <br/>
      The central role of K+ channels in regulating numerous cell functions makes them particularly important targets for therapeutic development. �Cook, N. S., Potassium channels: Structure, classification, function and therapeutic potential.
      <br/>
      Ellis Horwood, Chinchester (1990)�. One class of K+ channels, the large-conductance Ca2+ -activated K+ channels (Maxi-K or BK channels), is regulated by transmembrane voltage, intracellular Ca2+, and a variety of other factors such as the phosphorylation state of the channel protein. �Latorre, R., et al., Ann. Rev. Pysiol., 51: 385-399 (1989)�. The large, single channel-conductance (generally&gt;150 pS) and high degree of specificity for K+ of BK channels indicates that small numbers of channels could profoundly affect membrane conductance and cell excitability.
      <br/>
      Additionally, the increase in open probability with increasing intracellular Ca2+ indicates involvement of BK channels in the modulation of Ca2+ -dependent phenomena such as secretion and muscular contraction. �Asano, M., et al., J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther., 267: 1277-1285 (1993)�.
    </p>
    <p num="43">Openers of BK channels exert their cellular effects by increasing the open probability of these channels �McKay, M. C., et al., J. Neurophysiol., 71: 1873-1882 (1994); and Olesen, S.-P., Exp. Opin. Invest. Drugs, 3: 1181-1188 (1994)�. This increase in the opening of individual BK channels collectively results in the hyperpolarization of cell membranes, particularly in depolarized cells, produced by significant increases in whole-cell BK-mediated conductance.</p>
    <p num="44">
      The ability of compounds described in the present invention to open BK channels and increase whole-cell outward (K+) BK-mediated currents was assessed under voltage-clamp conditions by determining their ability to increase cloned mammalian (mSlo or hSlo) BK --mediated outward current heterologously expressed in Xenopus oocytes �Butler, A., et al., Science, 261: 221-224 (1993); and Dworetzky, S. I., et al., Mol. Brain Res., 27: 189-193 (1994)�. The two BK constructs employed represent nearly structurally identical homologous proteins, and have proven to be pharmacologically identical in our tests.
      <br/>
      To isolate BK current from native (background, non-BK) current, the specific and potent BK channel-blocking toxin iberiotoxin (IBTX) �Galvez, A., et al., J. Biol. Chem., 265: 11083-11090 (1990)� was employed at a supramaximal concentration (50 nM).
      <br/>
      The relative contribution of BK channels current to total outward current was determined by subtraction of the current remaining in the presence of IBTX (non-BK current) from the current profiles obtained in all other experimental conditions (control, drug, and wash).
      <br/>

    <p num="46">To determine the ability of these compounds to reduce cell loss resulting from neuronal ischemia, a standard rodent model of permanent focal ischemia, involving occlusion of the middle cerebral artery in the spontaneously hypertensive rat (middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model) was employed �Tamura, A., et al., Journal of Cerebral Blood Flow and Metabolism, Volume 1, 53-60, (1981)�.</p>
    <p num="47">
      Selected compounds have been evaluated in the focal stroke model involving permanent MCAO in the spontaneously hypertensive rat.
      <br/>
      This procedure results in a reliably large neocortical infarct volume that is measured by means of vital dye exclusion in serial slices through the brain 24 hours after MCAO.
      <br/>
      In the present test, compounds were administered using an intravenous route of administration at 2 hours after occlusion.
      <br/>
      For example, in this model, the compound of Example 21 reduced the cortical infarct volume by about 25% when administered (0.003 mg/kg) as a single bolus 2 hours after middle cerebral artery occlusion as compared to vehicle-treated (2% DMSO, 98% propylene glycol) control.

      Am. J. Physiol. 272: H1960-H1971, (1997)�. Briefly, rats (250-600 g) were anesthetized using sodium pentobarbital, the abdomen opened and the cavernous nerve identified.
      <br/>
      A pressure catheter was placed in the right corpus cavernosum (crus) to measure intracavernous pressure (ICP).
      <br/>
      A second catheter was introduced into the carotid artery to measure blood pressure.
      <br/>
      Test compound (0.1, 0.3 and 1 mg/kg iV.) or vehicle (PEG 400) was given via a catheter placed into the jugular vein.
    </p>
    <p num="49">
      Control intracavernous pressure responses were elicited by electrically stimulating the cavernous nerve via bipolar stimulating electrodes (20 Hz, 0.22 ms pulse width).
      <br/>
      Stimulus amplitude (0.2-20 mA) was adjusted to produce a submaximal intracavernous pressure response (typically 0.2 or 0.5 mA).
      <br/>
      A series of control intracavernous pressure responses were then obtained using a constant stimulus amplitude.
      <br/>
      Test compound or vehicle was then administered (200  MU l i.v bolus) and the cavernous nerve was restimulated to evoke a cavernous pressure response at various times post-drug administration.
      <br/>
      Animals were excluded from the study if the initial ICP responses to nerve stimulation were unstable ("spiky" responses) or if there were time-dependent variations in the magnitude of the control responses.
      <br/>
      Animals were also excluded if the control ICP/BP response fell outside the 0.3-0.6 range.

    <p num="54">For therapeutic use, the pharmacologically active compounds of Formula I will normally be administered as a pharmaceutical composition comprising as the (or an) essential active ingredient at least one such compound in association with a solid or liquid pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and, optionally, with pharmaceutically acceptable adjutants and excipients employing standard and conventional techniques.</p>
    <p num="55">
      The pharmaceutical compositions include suitable dosage forms for oral, parenteral (including subcutaneous, intramuscular, intradermal and intravenous) bronchial or nasal administration.
      <br/>
      Thus, if a solid carrier is used, the preparation may be tableted, placed in a hard gelatin capsule in powder or pellet form, or in the form of a troche or lozenge.
      <br/>
      The solid carrier may contain conventional excipients such as binding agents, fillers, tableting lubricants, disintegrants, wetting agents and the like.
      <br/>
      The tablet may, if desired, be film coated by conventional techniques.
      <br/>
      If a liquid carrier is employed, the preparation may be in the form of a syrup, emulsion, soft gelatin capsule, sterile vehicle for injection, an aqueous or non-aqueous liquid suspension, or may be a dry product for reconstitution with water or other suitable vehicle before use.
      <br/>
      Liquid preparations may contain conventional additives such as suspending agents, emulsifying agents, wetting agents, non-aqueous vehicle (including edible oils), preservatives, as well as flavoring and/or coloring agents.
      <br/>
      For parenteral administration, a vehicle normally will comprise sterile water, at least in large part, although saline solutions, glucose solutions and like may be utilized.
      <br/>
      Injectable suspensions also may be used, in which case conventional suspending agents may be employed.
      <br/>
      Conventional preservatives, buffering agents and the like also may be added to the parenteral dosage forms.

      The dosage of the compounds of Formula I to achieve a therapeutic effect will depend not only on such factors as the age, weight and sex of the patient and mode of administration, but also on the degree of potassium channel activating activity desired and the potency of the particular compound being utilized for the particular disorder of disease concerned.
      <br/>
      It is also contemplated that the treatment and dosage of the particular compound may be administered in unit dosage form and that the unit dosage form would be adjusted accordingly by one skilled in the art to reflect the relative level of activity.
      <br/>
      The decision as to the particular dosage to be employed (and the number of times to be administered per day) is within the discretion of the physician, and may be varied by titration of the dosage to the particular circumstances of this invention to produce the desired therapeutic effect.
    </p>
    <p num="57">
      A suitable dose of a compound of Formula I or pharmaceutical composition thereof for a mammal, including man, suffering from, or likely to suffer from any condition as described herein is an amount of active ingredient from about 0.01  MU g/kg to 10 mg/kg body weight and preferrably, from about 0.1  MU g/kg to 5 mg/kg body weight for oral administration.
      <br/>
      For parenteral administration, the dose may be in the range of 0.1  MU g/kg to 1 mg/kg body weight for intravenous administration The active ingredient will preferably be administered in equal doses from one to four times a day.
      <br/>
      However, usually a small dosage is administered, and the dosage is gradually increased until the optimal dosage for the host under treatment is determined.
