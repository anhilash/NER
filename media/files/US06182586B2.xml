      <br/>
      The present invention relates to a soil injection apparatus in which a probe having on insertion tip is inserted into the soil.
      <br/>
      A pair of probe guide assemblies are positioned adjacent each side of the probe to provide stability of the probe and prevent breaking of the probe.
      <br/>
      A probe hydraulic system extends and retracts the probe from the soil.
      <br/>
      A liquid pumping system pumps liquid into an outlet of the probe after insertion of the probe into the soil.
      <br/>
      A control system activates the probe hydraulic system and liquid pumping system.
      <br/>
      Preferably, a switch is used to activate the pumping system to pump liquid into the soil after the probe has been inserted a predetermined depth into the soil.
      <br/>
      The soil injection apparatus can be attached to a self-propelled vehicle.
      <br/>
      A carrier can be attached to the vehicle for holding debris removed from the soil injection site.

      Field of the Invention
    </p>
    <p num="2">The present invention relates to a soil injection apparatus in which a plurality of probes are guided and independently controlled, thereby preventing probe breakage and preventing fluid from being dispersed until the probe reaches a defined depth.</p>
    <p num="3">2. Related Art</p>
    <p num="4">
      Conventional systems have been used to inject various chemicals to subsurface areas to effect the growth conditions of soils for grass, plants or trees. U.S. Pat. No. 4,903,618 discloses a soil injection system mounted to a conventional farm vehicle without modification to the chassis of the vehicle.
      <br/>
      The system includes a single, hydraulically operated ground penetrating bit with an attached fluid injector which are operated to penetrate the ground.
      <br/>
      The penetrating bit is designed to be coupled to and powered by the vehicle's hydraulic system.
      <br/>
      The system further includes a chemical (fluid) supply tank, a pressurization tank and a chemical metering tank.
      <br/>

    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="9">
      The present invention relates to a soil injection apparatus in which a probe having on insertion tip is inserted into the soil.
      <br/>
      A pair of probe guide assemblies are positioned adjacent each side of the probe to provide stability of the probe and prevent breaking of the probe.
      <br/>
      A probe hydraulic system extends and retracts the probe from the soil.
      <br/>
      A liquid pumping system pumps liquid into an outlet of the probe after insertion of the probe into the soil.
      <br/>
      A control system activates the probe hydraulic system and liquid pumping system.
      <br/>
      Preferably, the control system includes a multiple position switch for controlling upward and downward movement of the probe and of pumping the liquid.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      A switch can be attached to the probe guide assemblies and the liquid pumping system.
      <br/>
      The switch is closed when the probe extends a predetermined depth into the soil to activate the liquid pumping system.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, liquid is only pumped to probes that have been extended a predetermined depth into the soil, thereby preventing untimely disbursement of the liquid.
    </p>
    <p num="11">
      The soil injection apparatus can be attached to a self-propelled vehicle.

      Preferably, a holding tank for the liquid and probe guide assembly can be attached to a frame which is removable attached to the vehicle.

      <br/>
      Probe guide assembly 12 is coupled to probe hydraulic system 40.
      <br/>
      Probe 13 moves within hydraulic cylinder 20.
      <br/>
      Hydraulic cylinder 20 is activated and deactivated by probe hydraulic system 40.
      <br/>
      Liquid pumping system 50 pumps liquid to probe guide assembly 12 and into ground 11.
      <br/>
      Control system 60 activates probe hydraulic system 40 for extending probe 13 in the direction of arrow Al into soil 11 and retracting probe 13 in the direction of arrow A2 away from soil 11.
      <br/>
      After probe 13 is inserted into ground 11, control system 60 activates liquid pumping system 50 for pumping liquid into probe 13.
    </p>
    <p num="17">
      FIGS. 2A-2D are detailed views of probe guide assembly 12 and its relationship to probe 13.
      <br/>
      Insertion tip 15 is formed at end 16 of probe 13.
      <br/>
      Insertion tip 15 is pointed for piercing soil 11 to insert probe 13 into ground 11.
      <br/>
      A pair of probe guides 14 are positioned adjacent each side of probe 13 to provide support for probe 13, thereby preventing bending or breaking of probe 13 when insertion tip 15 encounters resistance from ground 11.
      <br/>
      For example, resistance on insertion tip 15 can occur because of a rock, root or other subsurface obstacles.
      <br/>
      Probe 13 has a hollow fluid passage 18 connected to probe outlet 17.
      <br/>
      Probe outlet 17 is formed in insertion tip 15.

      <br/>
      For example, inner probe guide 25 and probe guide support 26 can have a square cross-sectional shape with the outer circumference Co of inner probe guide 25 being smaller than the inner circumference Ci of probe guide support 26.
      <br/>
      Preferably, friction reducing material 27 is inserted between outer surface 28 of inner probe guide 25 and inner surface 29 of probe guide support 26.

      <br/>
      Valve 44 is activated by control system 60 to provide movement of the probe up and probe down position, as described in more detail below.
      <br/>
      When valve 44 is activated into the probe up position, hydrostatic transmission 49 powers hydraulic motors 45 to pump hydraulic fluid from hydraulic fluid reservoir 46 to port 41 of hydraulic cylinder 20.
      <br/>
      The application of pressurized hydraulic fluid into hydraulic cylinder 20 extends probe 13.
      <br/>
      When valve 44 is activated into the probe down position, valve 44 is opened to relief valve 47 to allow hydraulic fluid to escape from port 42.
      <br/>
      The escape of pressurized hydraulic fluid retracts probe 13 into hydraulic cylinder 20.
