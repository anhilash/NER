      There is described a process for the enantioselective alkylation of aldehydes by means of organozinc compounds, of which a ligand of the zinc is transferred to the aldehyde, and the other ligand acts as so-called dummy ligand.
      <br/>
      As novel substances there are used zinc-organic compounds, which contain the neophyl residue as dummy ligand.

    <p num="1">This invention relates to a process for the selective alkylation of aldehydes by means of organozinc compounds.</p>
    <p num="2">
      Organozinc compounds R--Zn--X or R2 Zn (R=alkyl, aryl, x=Cl, Br, I) are easy-to-handle organometallic reagents, which in the synthesis can be used for selective CC cross-linking reactions, where due to the low reactivity of the zinc species the transfer of the residue R requires the presence of a further transition metal compound, e.g. a copper, palladium, cobalt or titanium compound.
      <br/>
      A particular advantage of the zinc-organic chemistry consists in the fact that the above-mentioned organic residues R can also have a functional group FG, such as an ester, amine or nitrile function. (A good survey is provided by P. Knochel and R. D. Singer in Chem.

      In this way, functionalized secondary alcohols can in general be produced with good yields and very good enantiomeric purities (&gt;90%).
      <br/>
      This excellent selectivity is paid for with a relatively poor reactivity of the Zn species.
      <br/>
      The latter leads to the fact that the zinc compound must generally be used with a two- or threefold excess, i.e. from the amounts (R-FG) used only about 15 to 30% are transferred to the aldehyde in the final analysis.
      <br/>
      The rest is lost during processing.
      <br/>
      The same is true for the titanium compound used as co-reagent, which must preferably be used in about equimolar amounts (based on the Zn compound).

      To increase the utilization of the zinc-bound alkyl residue, there were used recently mixed zinc compounds of the type

    <p num="6">�C. Lutz, P. Knochel, J. Org. Chem. 1997, 62, 7895�. It was found that the H2 C--Si(CH3)3 residue ("TMSM") is not transferred to carbonyl compounds and thus a desired chemoselective transfer of the functionalized alkyl residue (R-FG) is ensured.</p>
    <p num="7">
      In this way, the residue (R-FG) to be transferred is required in considerably lower amounts.
      <br/>
      This is of high interest in particular for valuable functionalized residues.
      <br/>
      For technical applications, the TMSM residue is, however, less suited because of a lack of availability and because of the high price of its precursor compound Cl--CH2 --Si(CH3)3.
    </p>
    <p num="8">It is therefore the object underlying the invention to eliminate the disadvantages known from the prior art and in particular create a process for the (enantioselective) alkylation of aldehydes by means of zinc-organic compounds, wherein the alkyl residue to be transferred can be present in a functionalized form and saturates only one valency each of the zinc, and the second zinc compound is saturated by an easily accessible and in expensive residue ("dummy ligand") which does not disturb the alkylation.</p>
    <p num="9">It is a further object of the invention to create novel compounds, by means of which the (enantioselective) alkylation of aldehydes can be performed to a particular advantage corresponding to the inventive process.</p>

      In this case, the catalyst system for the addition of mixed (partly functionalized) dialkylzinc compounds to aldehydes consists of (R,R)-1,2-bis-(trifluoromethanesulfonamido)cyclohexane as chiral ligand and titanium tetraisopropylate as Lewis acid.
      <br/>
      As can be seen from the results of the test reaction indicated in the above table, in the case of the neopentyl (dummy) ligand (R2,R3,R4 =Me) and of the neophyl (dummy) ligand (R2,R3 =Me, R4 =Ph) only the desired residue (R-FG), in this case 4-pivaloxybutyl, is transferred to the aldehyde, namely largely enantioselectively.
      <br/>
      A change to sterically less demanding dummy ligands, such as isobutyl (R2,R3 =Me, R4 =H) and isopropyl (R5 =Me), leads to a partial transfer of the dummy ligand to the aldehyde (5% or 18%).

      Nevertheless, the desired reaction product 1 is still obtained in a clear excess with respect to the undesired product 2.

      Thus, it has been shown that by means of the inventive process the residue (R-FG) to be transferred is transferred chemoselectively from the dialkylzinc compound to the aldehyde, where the dummy ligand of the dialkylzinc compound consists of easily accessible and inexpensive organic residues.

      Subsequently, 0.1 to 2.0 equivalents, preferably 0.6 to 1.2 equivalents (based on the aldehyde) Lewis acid, e.g. titanium or zirconium tetraalkoxide, preferably titanium tetraisopropylate, are added.

      In a heated, argon-flooded round flask with nitrogen cock, (R,R)-1,2-bis(trifluoromethanesulfonamido)cyclohexane (61 mg, 0.16 mmol, 8 mol-%), titanium tetraisopropylate (0.36 ml, 1.2 mmol, 0.6 equivalents) was dissolved in 3 ml diethyl ether.
      <br/>
      The catalyst solution was cooled to -20 (degree)  C. The mixed dialkylzinc reagent 4-pivaloxybutyl-neopentylzinc (2.4 equivalents) was slowly added dropwise to the catalyst solution.

      After 10 minutes, benzaldehyde (0.21 g, 2.0 mmol, 1 equivalent) was dropped in undiluted.
      <br/>
      The reaction mixture was stirred for 23 hours at -20 (degree)  C. Upon hydrolysis with 20 ml saturated ammonium chloride solution and 5 ml 10% aqueous hydrochloric acid solution, the organic phase was separated and the aqueous phase was extracted three times with 50 ml diethyl ether each.
      <br/>
      The combined organic phases were washed with 2N sodium hydroxide solution and dried over magnesium sulfate.
      <br/>
      Upon removal of the solvent by distillation, the raw product was purified by column chromatography.
