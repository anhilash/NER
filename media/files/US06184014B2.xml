    <heading>TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
    <p num="2">
      The present invention relates to a bacterial polyphenol oxidase, to a process of making the enzyme, to a bacterial strain that produces the enzyme, and to processes using the enzyme.
      <br/>
      More specifically, the present invention provides a novel enzyme source of polyphenol oxidase for use in the oxidation of colored substances and oxidation of polyphenol-containing substances and also for use in cleaning.
    </p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND ART</heading>
    <p num="3">
      Polyphenol oxidase and laccase are known as enzymes that oxidize polyphenols.
      <br/>
      Various studies have been made on the use of polyphenol-oxidizing enzymes.
      <br/>
      For example, WO 94-29510 reports the delignination in the field of paper and pulp; and WO 91-05839, EP 91619032, DE 4008894 and JP-A 64-60693 report the use of the enzymes for bleaching in laundry washing.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      However, the only known microbial sources for polyphenol oxidase and laccabe are mold fungi such as Basidiomycetes and Deuteromycetes., and it is generally difficult to cultivate large amounts of such fungi and, in addition, the rate of growth of the cells during cultivation is not high.
      <br/>
      Improving the enzyme yield by mutation or by use of genetic engineering technology is more difficult with these fungi than with bacteria, since the fungi have complicated life cycles and have complicated gene structures comprising introns, etc.
      <br/>
      For these reasons, it is difficult to stably and inexpensively obtain large amounts of polyphenol oxidases from such fungi, and bacteria-derived polyphenol oxidases are desired in order to apply them to practical use.
    </p>
    <p num="5">It is the object of the present invention to provide a polyphenol oxidase to be produced by bacteria, the bacteria that produce the enzyme and the use of the enzyme, thus providing a novel enzyme source of polyphenol oxidase for use in the oxidation of colored substances and oxidation of polyphenol-containing substances and also for use in cleaning.</p>
    <heading>STATEMENT OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="6">
      We, the present inventors have assiduously searched various bacteria for extracellular products that catalyze the oxidation of polyphenol substances.
      <br/>
      Though being extremely difficult, our search for such products has at last resulted in the finding of the fact that bacteria belonging to the genus Bacillus can extracellularly produce the intended enzyme.
      <br/>
      On the basis of this finding, we have completed the present invention.

    <p num="27">From the above-mentioned results and with reference to "Bergey's Manual of Systematic Bacteriology", Vol. 2, 1986, Williams &amp; Wilkins, and "The Genus Bacillus", 1973, U.S. Department of Agriculture, this strain is classified as Bacillus licheniformis SD3003.</p>
    <p num="28">Preparation of Enzyme</p>
    <p num="29">
      The polyphenol oxidase of the present invention can be obtained by cultivating the cells of strains belonging to the genus Bacillus such as those mentioned hereinabove, or those of mutants thereof.
      <br/>
      In addition, it can also be obtained by cultivating transformants from such strains to be prepared through genetic engineering.
      <br/>
      For example, host cells as transformed with an expression vector to be prepared by inserting a DNA that codes for the polyphenol oxidase of the invention, along with suitable promoter, operator and terminator DNAs that function to make said enzyme-encoding DNA express the enzyme in host organisms, into a DNA vector having a replication-initiating point at which the replication of said vector in host organisms is initiated; or host cells as transformed through integration of a DNA that codes for the polyphenol oxidase of the invention with a DNA of a host cell along with suitable promoter, operator and terminator DNAs that function to make said enzyme-encoding DNA express the enzyme in host organisms are cultivated under the condition under which the intended polyphenol oxidase can be expressed, and the thus-expressed polyphenol oxidase is collected from the culture of the thus-cultivated transformant cells.
    </p>
    <p num="30">
      To obtain a DNA fragment that codes for the polyphenol oxidase of the invention, any ordinary methods are employable.
      <br/>
      For example, the cDNA or genome library extracted from the strains as referred to hereinabove may be used as the DNA sources.
      <br/>
      Using, as the probe, an oligonucleotide as synthesized on the basis of the amino acid sequence of the intended enzyme, polyphenol oxidase, of the invention, or on the basis of the amino acid sequence of a known polyphenol oxidase, the intended DNA fragment may be specifically identified.
      <br/>
      Apart from these, clones that express enzymatic activity may be selected, or clones capable of producing a protein that reacts with an antibody to the enzyme, polyphenol oxidase of the invention may be selected.
    </p>
    <p num="31">
      The polyphenol oxidase of the present invention can be obtained by cultivating the enzyme-producing cells on a conventional synthetic medium or nutrient medium comprising an organic carbon source and an organic nitrogen source.
      <br/>
      It is desirable to add to the medium a metal salt of Cu2+ ion at a concentration of from 0.001 mM to 10 mM, preferably from 0.01 mM to 1 mM.
      <br/>
      It is also desirable to add thereto a metal salt of Mn2+ ion at a Concentration of from 0.001 mM to 100 mM, preferably from 0.01 mM to 10 mM.
      <br/>
      The cultivation temperature may be from 20 to 60 (degree)  C., preferably from 30 to 55 (degree)  C. The cultivation time may be suitably from 20 hours to 200 hours, preferably from 46 hours to 150 hours.
    </p>
    <p num="32">
      The polyphenol oxidase as secreted by the cells can be recovered by any ordinary means.
      <br/>
      The means of recovering the enzyme may comprise a series of steps of separating the cells from the medium by centrifugation, filtration or membrane separation, followed by purifying the enzyme through chromatography such as ion-exchange chromatography or the like.
      <br/>
      Concentrating by use of an ultrafiltration membrane is also effective for the recovery of the enzyme.
      <br/>
      In addition, it is also possible to isolate and concentrate the enzyme through salting-out with ammonium sulfate or the like.
    </p>
    <p num="33">Properties of Enzyme</p>
    <p num="34">The polyphenyl oxidase of the invention preferably has one or more of the following properties: Optimum reaction pH about 7, optimum reaction temperature between 60 (degree)  C. and 80 (degree)  C., and a molecular weight of about 51,000 (as measured by GFC).</p>
    <p num="35">
      One typical example of the polyphenol oxidase of the present invention is the enzyme derived from Bacillus licheniformis SD3003, which catalyzes oxidation within a broad pH range of from 5 to 9, but preferably from 6 to 8, more preferably about pH 7 (see FIG. 1).
      <br/>
      Thus, this enzyme is characterized in that it catalyzes oxidation within a neutral pH range.
      <br/>
      The optimum temperature for the action of the enzyme may be from 60 (degree)  C. to 80 (degree)  C. (see FIG. 2).
      <br/>
      The activity after 30 minutes heat treatment at various predetermined temperatures at pH 7 shows a residual activity of almost 100 at 70 (degree)  C. (FIG. 3).
      <br/>
      After the enzyme has been treated in a buffer having varying pH values at 30 (degree)  C. for 30 minutes, its activity is still stable in a broad pH range (see FIG. 4).
      <br/>
      These results ensure the stable activity of the enzyme to catalyze oxidation in various solutions within a broad pH range that covers from weakly acidic to weakly alkaline, at medium to low temperatures.

      Then, the beaker was shaken for 12 minutes to wash the cloth.
      <br/>
      After thus having been washed, the swatch was rinsed with water and dried in air, and its color was measured with a color-difference meter (CR-200, produced by Minolta Co.) to determine the Y, y and x values of the cloth.
      <br/>
      From these, the Z value thereof was obtained according to the equation, Z=(1-x-y)Y/y.

    <p num="97">The results demonstrated an increase of 1.5 points in the degree of whiteness of the swatch treated with the enzyme-containing detergent sample, compared with that treated with the control detergent sample with no enzyme.</p>
