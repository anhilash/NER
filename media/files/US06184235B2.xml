    <heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">
      The present invention relates to novel compounds and medical methods of treatment of inflammation, atherosclerosis, restenosis, and immune disorders especially those associated with lymphocyte or monocyte accumulation such as arthritis and transplant rejection.
      <br/>
      More particularly, the present invention concerns the use of 2-phenyl benzimidazole derivatives.

    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="3">
      Migration of leukocytes from blood vessels into diseased tissues is important to the initiation of normal disease-fighting inflammatory responses.
      <br/>
      But this process, known as leukocyte recruitment, is also involved in the onset and progression of debilitating and life-threatening inflammatory and autoimmune diseases.
      <br/>
      The pathology of these diseases results from the attack of the body's immune system defenses on normal tissues.
      <br/>
      Thus, blocking leukocyte recruitment to target tissues in inflammatory and autoimmune disease would be a highly effective therapeutic intervention.
      <br/>
      The leukocyte cell classes that participate in cellular immune responses include lymphocytes, monocytes, neutrophils, eosinophils and basophils.
      <br/>
      In many cases, lymphocytes are the leukocyte class that initiates, coordinates, and maintains chronic inflammatory responses, and thus are generally the most important class of cells to block from entering inflammatory sites.
      <br/>
      Lymphocytes attract monocytes to the site, which, collectively with lymphocytes, are responsible for much of the actual tissue damage that occurs in inflammatory disease.
      <br/>
      Infiltration of lymphocytes and/or monocytes is responsible for a wide range of chronic, autoimmune diseases, and also organ transplant rejection.
      <br/>
      These diseases include, but are not limited to, rheumatoid arthritis, atherosclerosis, psoriasis, chronic contact dermatitis, inflammatory bowel disease, multiple sclerosis, sarcoidosis, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, dermatomyositis, skin pemphigoid and related diseases, (e.g., pemphigus vulgaris, p. foliacious, p. erythematosis), glomerulonephritides, vasculitides, hepatitis, diabetes, allograft rejection, and graft-versus-host disease.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      This process, by which leukocytes leave the bloodstream and accumulate at inflammatory sites, and initiate disease, takes place in at least three distinct steps which have been described as (1) rolling, (2) activation/firm adhesion and (3) transendothelial migration �Springer, T. A., Nature 346:425-433 (1990); Lawrence and Springer, Cell 65:859-873 (1991); Butcher, E. C., Cell 67:1033-1036 (1991)�. The second step is mediated at a molecular level by chemoattractant receptors.
      <br/>
      Chemoattractant receptors on the surface of leukocytes bind chemoattractant cytokines secreted by cells at the site of damage or infection.
      <br/>
      Receptor binding activates leukocytes, increases the adhesiveness of the adhesion molecules that mediate transendothelial migration, and promotes directed migration of the cells toward the source of the chemoattractant cytokine.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      A recent discovery is the existence of a large family (&gt;20 members) of structurally homologous chemoattractant cytokines, approximately 8 to 10 kD in size.
      <br/>
      These molecules share the ability to stimulate directed cell migration (chemotaxis) and have been collectively called "chemokines", a contraction of chemotactic cytokines.
      <br/>
      Each chemokine contains four cysteine residues (C) and two internal disulfide bonds.
      <br/>
      Chemokines can be grouped into two subfamilies, based on whether the two amino terminal cysteine residues are immediately adjacent (C-C family) or separated by one amino acid (C-X-C family).
      <br/>
      These differences correlate with the organization of the two subfamilies into separate gene clusters.
      <br/>
      Within each gene cluster, the chemokines typically show sequence similarities between 25 to 60%.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      The chemokines of the C-X-C subfamily, such as interleukin-8, are produced by a wide range of cell types and act predominantly on neutrophils as mediators of acute inflammation.
      <br/>
      Chemokines of the C-C subfamily are also produced by a wide variety of cell types.
      <br/>
      These molecules act predominantly on subsets of mononuclear inflammatory cells.
      <br/>
      Currently there are at least six C-C chemokines with known chemotactic activity for human monocytes and/or T cells, including MCP-1, MCP-2, MCP-3, MIP-1 ALPHA , MIP-1 BETA , and RANTES.
      <br/>
      This suggests there may be a high degree of redundancy in chemoattractant pathways.
      <br/>
      In addition, most C-C chemokines are chemotactic for more than one cell type.
      <br/>
      For examples, RANTES (regulated on activation, normal T cell expressed and secreted) acts on memory CD4+ T cells, eosinophils, and monocytes.
      <br/>
      Monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), another C-C chemokine, acts on monocytes, activated "memory" T cells and on basophils.
      <br/>
      MCP-1 is also a potent secretogogue of inflammatory mediators for monocytes and basophils.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      Five C-C chemokine receptors have recently been characterized (CKR1-5 or CCR1-CCR5), and all of these belong to the seven transmembrane spanning G protein-coupled receptor family.
      <br/>
      Each of these receptors mediates the binding and signaling of more than one chemokine.
      <br/>
      For example, the CCR1 receptor binds both MIP-1 ALPHA  and RANTES.
      <br/>
      There are 2 receptors which bind MCP-1, CCR2 (with alternately spliced forms, 2A and 2B) and CCR4.
      <br/>
      CCR2 is also known to mediate binding and signaling of MCP-3.
      <br/>
      The CCR4 receptor binds and signals, in addition to MCP-1, with RANTES and MIP-1 ALPHA .
      <br/>
      Which of these is responsible for the MCP-1 mediated recruitment of monocytes and T cells is not known.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      In agreement with the observation that lymphocyte emigration into inflammatory sites is usually accompanied by emigration of monocytes, MCP-1 is expressed at sites of antigen challenge and autoimmune disease.
      <br/>
      However, analyses of human inflammatory lesions with antibodies to other chemokines show RANTES, MIP-1 ALPHA , MIP1 BETA  and MCP-3 to be present as well.
      <br/>
      Injection of MCP-1 into skin sites in mice provokes only a mild monocytic infiltrate or no infiltrate at all (Ernst, C. A. et al., J. Immunol. 152:3541-3544, 1994).
      <br/>
      Whether these results reflect redundant and complex recruitment pathways has not been resolved.
      <br/>
      MCP-1 and MCP-3 may play a role in allergic hypersensitivity disease.
      <br/>
      This is suggested by the observation that MCP-1 lacking the amino terminal glutamic acid loses the ability to stimulate basophil mediator release and acquires activity as an eosinophil chemoattractant.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      Chemokines of both subfamilies may bind to heparan sulfate proteoglycans on the endothelial cell surface, and may function principally to stimulate haptotaxis of leukocytes that attach to cytokine-activated endothelium through induced adhesion molecules.
      <br/>
      Additionally, MCP-1 has been reported to selectively activate the  BETA 1 integrin family of leukocyte adhesion molecule, suggesting a role in leukocyte interactions with the extracellular matrix.
      <br/>
      Hence, MCP-1 may not only trigger the initial arrest and adhesion of monocytes and T cells, but may also act to guide their migration in extravascular space.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      Chemoattractants appear to be required for transendothelial migration in vitro and in vivo and can induce all steps required for transmigration in vivo.
      <br/>
      Injection of neutrophil chemoattractants into skin or muscle leads to robust emigration of neutrophils from the vasculature and accumulation at the injection site (Colditz, 1991).
      <br/>
      Pretreatment of neutrophils with pertussis toxin inhibits emigration into inflammatory sites (Spangrude, et al., 1985; Nourshargh and Williams, 1990).
      <br/>
      Moreover, MAb to IL-8 markedly inhibits neutrophil emigration in inflammation (Sekido et al., 1993).
    </p>
    <p num="11">
      Neutrophil chemoattractants injected into the same skin site hours apart will stimulate neutrophil accumulation the first time but not the second time, whereas a second injection into a distant site will stimulate accumulation at that site.
      <br/>
      This desensitization occurs for homologous chemoattractants only (Colditz, 1991) or those that interact with the same receptor.
      <br/>
      Thus, chemoattractants can act on and homologously desensitize a cell type that is localized in tissue.
    </p>
    <p num="12">
      Chemoattractants impart directionality to leukocyte migration.
      <br/>
      By contrast with intradermal injection, intravascular injection of IL-8 does not lead to emigration (Hechtman et al., 1991).
      <br/>
      Cytokine-stimulated endothelial monolayers grown on filters secrete IL-8 into the underlying collagen layer.
      <br/>
      Neutrophils added to the apical compartment emigrate into the basilar compartment, but not when the IL-8 gradient is disrupted by addition of IL-8 to the apical compartment (Huber et al., 1991).
    </p>
    <p num="13">
      The endothelium may present chemoattractants to leukocytes in a functionally relevant way, as well as providing a permeability barrier that stabilizes the chemoattractant gradient.
      <br/>
      Since leukocytes, responding to specific antigen or inflammatory signals in tissue, may signal emigration of further leukocytes into the site, a chemoattractant was sought in material secreted by mitogen-stimulated mononuclear cells (Carr et al., 1994).
      <br/>
      Purification to homogeneity guided by a transendothelial lymphocyte chemotaxis assay revealed that monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1), previously thought to be solely a monocyte chemoattractant, is a major lymphocyte chemoattractant.
      <br/>
      An activated subset of memory lymphocytes respond to MCP-1.
      <br/>
      In the same assay, lymphocytes respond to RANTES and MIP-1 ALPHA  but less so than to MCP-1 (C-C chemokines) and not at all to IL-8 or IP-10 (C-X-C chemokines).
      <br/>
      This physiologically relevant assay suggests that C-C chemokines tend to attract both monocytes and lymphocytes.
      <br/>
      In agreement with the observation that lymphocyte emigration into inflammatory sites is accompanied by emigration of monocytes, MCP-1 is abundantly expressed at sites of antigen challenge and autoimmune disease (Miller and Krangel, 1992) and, together with other chemokines, is an excellent candidate to provide the step 2 signal required to activate integrin adhesiveness and emigration of lymphocytes in vivo. (Traffic Signals for Lymphocyte Recirculation and Leukocyte Emigration: The Multistep Paradigm; Springer, 1994, Cell 76: 301-314).

      We have surprisingly found that 2-phenyl benzimidazole derivates are MCP-1 receptor antagonists and are capable of inhibiting the binding of MCP-1 to its receptor.
      <br/>
      Surprisingly, the compounds block T cell migration in vitro, and more surprisingly still, have dramatic effects on the recruitment of inflammatory cells in multiple models of inflammatory diseases.
      <br/>
      Thus, these compounds are useful as agents for the treatment of inflammatory disease, especially those associated with lymphocyte and/or monocyte accumulation, such as arthritis, atherosclerosis and transplant rejection.
      <br/>
      In addition, these compounds can be used in the treatment of allergic hypersensitivity disorders such as asthma and allergic rhinitis characterized by basophil activation and eosinophil recruitment, as well as for the treatment of restenosis and chronic or acute immune disorders.

    <p num="56">The benzimidazoles are valuable agents for the treatment of inflammatory diseases or conditions, atherosclerosis, restenosis, and autoimmune disorders such as arthritis and transplant rejection.</p>
    <p num="57">
      In a preferred embodiment, the disease or condition is one which is associated with lymphocyte and/or monocyte infiltration of tissues (including recruitment and/or accumulation in tissues), such as arthritis (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis), inflammatory bowel diseases (e.g., Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis), multiple sclerosis, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, and graft rejection (e.g., in transplantation), including allograft rejection or graft-versus-host disease.

    <p num="60">MCP-1 Binding Assay</p>
    <p num="61">
      Membranes used in the MCP-1 binding assay were prepared from THP-1 cells (human monocytic cell line source--American Type Culture Collection, Tumor Immunology Bank -202, Rockville, Md., accession no. ATCC TIB 202).
      <br/>
      Cells were harvested by centrifugation and washed twice in ice-cold PBS (phosphate-buffered saline) and the cell pellet was frozen at -80 (degree)  C. in some cases.
      <br/>
      Cells were resuspended in ice-cold lysis buffer 5 mM HEPES (2-(4N-�2-hydroxyethyl�piperazin-1-yl)-N'-(2-ethanesulfonic acid), pH 7.5, 2 mM EDTA (ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid), 5  MU g/mL each leupeptin, aprotinin, chymostatin (protease inhibitors), and 100  MU g/mL PMSF (phenylmethane sulfonyl fluoride--also a protease inhibitor)) at a concentration of 5 * 107 cells/mL.
      <br/>
      The cell suspension was dounced 10-15 times using the B pestle (small pestle of tissue grinder--clearance is 0.07 mm; source--Fisher Scientific) on ice.
      <br/>
      Nuclei and debris were removed by centrifugation at 500-1000 * g for 10 minutes at 4 (degree)  C. The supernatant was transferred to a fresh tube and centrifuged at 25,000 * g for 30 minutes at 4 (degree)  C. The supernatant was aspirated and the pellet was resuspended in freezing buffer (10 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 300 mM sucrose, 1  MU g/mL each leupeptin, aprotinin, chymostatin, and 10  MU g/mL PMSF) using a minihomogenizer until all clumps were resolved.
      <br/>
      Membranes were aliquoted and frozen at minus 70-85 (degree)  C. until needed.
      <br/>
      Typical binding assays used 10-20  MU g/well of total membrane protein as determined with a standard protein assay (e.g. Bradford protein assay, BioRad, Richmond, Calif.).
    </p>
    <p num="62">
      For binding, 10-20  MU g of total membrane protein were included in the binding reaction along with 0.2 nM I125 -labeled MCP-1 (Amersham, Arlington Heights, Ill.) with or without unlabeled competitor MCP-1 (Peprotech, Rocky Hill, N.J.) (at 500 nM).
      <br/>
      Binding reactions were performed in a final volume of 100 ul in a binding buffer containing 10 mM HEPES, pH 7.2, 1 mM CaCl2, 5 mM MgCl2, 0.5% BSA (bovine serum albumin).
      <br/>
      After 30-60 minutes at room temperature, the binding reactions were filtered through GF/C filters (Whatman glass fiber filters, Type C) or GF/B unifilter plates (Packard) which had been pre-soaked with 0.3% polyethyleneimine and washed twice with binding buffer containing 0.5 M NaCl. Filters were dried and counted in a Beta-Plate scintillation counter using standard scintillation fluid.
      <br/>
      Final concentration of compound in the binding assay ranged from 0.05-100  MU M. Compounds were dissolved in DMSO (dimethyl sulfoxide).
      <br/>
      Final concentrations of DMSO in the binding were kept constant at 0.5%.
    </p>
    <p num="63">
      IC50s were calculated using a non-linear 3-parameter logistic curve fit.
      <br/>
      IC50 means the concentration at which 50% inhibition is achieved.
      <br/>
      Negative controls contained the same amount of DMSO vehicle as used in wells containing compound.
      <br/>
      Positive control contained 250-500 nM cold competitor MCP-1 in DMSO vehicle.
      <br/>
      Non-specific binding (the level of bound 125 I-labeled MCP-1 in the presence of 250-500  MU M unlabeled MCP-1) was subtracted from all data prior to analysis.

    <p num="67">
      Recombinant human MCP-1 was obtained from Peprotech (Rockey Hill, N.J.).
      <br/>
      T lymphocyte blast cells (CD3-Blasts) were generated by standard protocols (Coligan, J. E., A. M. Kruisbeek, D. H. Macgulies, E. M. Shevach, and W. Strober, editors. 1992. Current Protocols in Immunology.
      <br/>
      John Wiley and Sons, New York 7.1.2, 7.10.1-7.10.10).
      <br/>
      Briefly, human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were isolated from heparinized venous blood by Percoll density gradient centrifugation (d=1.088) at room temperature.
      <br/>
      RBCs were removed by hypotonic lysis or dextran sedimentation.
      <br/>
      Blast cells were generated by incubating 2 * 106 PBMC in 24-well tissue culture plates that were coated with 2.5  MU g of an anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody (identified as TR66, a gift from Dr. A. Lanzivecchia; similar monoclonal antibody is HIT3a, from Parmingen -30111A) at 37 (degree)  C. for 48 to 72 hours, and then transferring 12 wells to T25 or T75 flasks with RPMI (Roswell Park Memorial Institute 1640, a growth cell medium available from Gibco/RBL, Inc., N.Y.)+10% FCS (fetal calf serum)+50 units/ml IL-2.
      <br/>
      The cells are expanded and cultured for up to 3 weeks.
      <br/>
      CD3-Blast chemotaxis was assessed no sooner than 3 to 4 days after transfer to the IL-2 containing medium using a modification of a transendothelial migration assay (Carr. M. W., S. J. Roth, B. Luther, S. S. Rose, and T. A. Springer. 1994. Monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 acts as a T-lymphocyte chemoattractant.
      <br/>
      Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 91:3652-6).
      <br/>
      The endothelial cells used for this assay were the endothelial cell line ECV304. (ECV304 was from the European Collection of Animal Cell Cultures, Porton Downs, U K, assession -92091712).
      <br/>
      Endothelial cells were cultured on 6.5 mm diameter Transwell culture inserts (Costar) with a 3.0 mm pore size.
      <br/>
      Culture media for ECV304 cells consisted of M199 (a cell culture medium from Gibco BRL, Inc., Gaithersburg, Md.)+10% FCS (fetal calf serum from Gibco BRL, Inc.), L-glutamine, and antibiotics (the penicillin concentration was 50 U/mL, and the streptomycin concentration was 50  MU g/mL; both from Gibco, N.Y.).
      <br/>
      Assay media consisted of equal parts RPMI 1640 and M199, with 0.5% BSA (bovine serum albumin or simply RPMI 1640 with 0.5% BSA).
      <br/>
      Twenty four hours before the assay, 2 * 105 ECV304 cells were plated onto each insert of the 24 well chemotaxis plate and incubated at 37 (degree)  C. MCP-1 (About 10 nM diluted in assay medium) with or without compounds, was added to the wells of a 24-well tissue culture plate in a final volume of 600 mL.
      <br/>
      Endothelial coated Transwells were inserted into each well and 106 CD3-blasts were added to the top chamber in a final volume of 100 mL, with or without compounds.

      The plate was then incubated at 37 (degree)  C. in 5% CO2 95% air for approximately 1 hour.
      <br/>
      The cells that had migrated to the bottom chamber were enumerated using flow cytometry. 500 mL of the cell suspension from the lower chamber was placed in a tube, and relative cell counts were obtained by acquiring events for a set time period of 30 seconds.
      <br/>
      This counting method was found to be highly reproducible, and enabled gating on the leukocytes and the exclusion of debris or other cells.
      <br/>
      Background migration was determined by counting cells that migrated in the absence of MCP-1 in the lower chamber.
      <br/>
      This background migration of cells per 30 second count was subtracted from the migration to MCP-1 to obtain specific migration.
      <br/>
      The percent inhibition by compounds of directed migration was determined by the following formula:  (Equation image '1' not included in text)

    <p num="71">
      Streptococcal cell wall (SCW) arthritis is induced in female Lewis rats (200 g).
      <br/>
      To induce the subacute, transient arthritic response, a highly refined preparation of streptococcal cell walls (100P, Lee Laboratories, Grayson, Ga.) is injected into the ankle joints of female Lewis rats (6  MU l/rat in Dulbecco's PBS).
      <br/>
      Twenty one days later, the animals are given an IV booster of SCW at a dose of 100  MU g/rat in 0.25 mL of Dulbecco's PBS.
      <br/>
      Vehicle (0.5% hydroxypropylmethylcellulose and 0.2% Tween 80, 10 mL/kg) or test compounds suspended in vehicle is given one hour before the IV challenge with SCW and daily thereafter for 3 additional days.
      <br/>
      Paw volume is measured daily by mercury plethysmography.
      <br/>
      Swelling was determined by comparing paw volume at the various timepoints with an initial paw volume measurement for each rat.
      <br/>
      Percent inhibition of swelling in compound-treated rats is determined in comparison with swelling in rats treated with vehicle.

      Statistical power is calculated using an analysis of covariance with a contrast mean comparison test (n=5-10 per experimental group).

    <p num="72">Glucan Vasculitis Model</p>
    <p num="73">
      Pulmonary granulomatous vasculitis was induced in anesthetized, 150-20 g male Lewis rats by intravenous infusion of 5 mg glucan.
      <br/>
      Infusion of particulate yeast cell-wall glucan into rats results in the rapid and synchronous development of angiocentric pulmonary granulomas which are composed almost entirely of monocytes and macrophages.
      <br/>
      It has been shown previously that MCP-1 mRNA expression and MCP-1 activity in lung lavage fluid rise in association with pulmonary granuloma development, and that granuloma development is markedly attenuated in rats treated with neutralizing concentrations of anti-MCP-1 antibody.
      <br/>
      This suggests that MCP-1 plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of glucan-induced granulomatous vasculitis.
      <br/>
      For these studies, compound was given by oral gavage at the indicated doses one hour prior to, and then twenty-four and forty-eight hours after glucan infusion.
      <br/>
      The rats were sacrificed seventy-two hours after the glucan infusion.
      <br/>
      At the time of sacrifice, the lungs were lavaged with 6.0 mLs. PBS/EDTA. Total cell counts in the recovered lavage fluid were obtained on a coulter counter, and cytocentrifuge preparations were prepared for differential cell counts.
      <br/>
      Following the lavage, the lungs were fixed with 10% neutral buffered formalin for routine processing and histological assessment of pulmonary vasculitis.
      <br/>
      The test results are shown in FIG. 1 for Example 1 compound.

    <p num="75">Method of Evaluation</p>
    <p num="76">
      Inbred, approximately 200 g, male Lewis rats were used in all experiments.
      <br/>
      Cutaneous delayed hypersensitivity (DHR) was induced as previously described (1).
      <br/>
      Briefly, rats were sensitized to KLH (Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, Mo.) by administering 50  MU g KLH in 0.1 mL complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA; Sigma Chemical Co.) into each of 4 subcutaneous sites.
      <br/>
      After 14 days, DHR was elicited by the challenge of 5  MU g KLH in PBS into multiple intradermal sites on the back.
      <br/>
      Analysis was performed 24 hours after antigen challenge.
      <br/>
      For each experiment, there were at least three groups of animals of at least four animals in each group.
      <br/>
      One group of nonsensitized, naive animals was used as a negative control and received vehicle alone (consisting of 0.5% hydroxypropylmethylcellulose/0.2% Tween 80 in water) per os at the time of challenge.
      <br/>
      As positive controls, one group of sensitized animals received alone per os at the time of KLH challenge.
      <br/>
      A third group consisted of sensitized animals that received compound suspended in vehicle per os at the time of KLH challenge.
    </p>
    <p num="77">
      T cell recruitment at sites of DHR was quantified using methods previously described (1-4).
      <br/>
      Briefly, rat T cells were isolated from spleen of naive adult Lewis rats by mincing the splenic tissue, removing the red cells by hypotonic lysis, and passing the cells through a nylon wool column.
      <br/>
      The cells in the effluent were highly purified (&gt;95%) rat T cells as assessed by anti-rat CD3 (monoclonal antibody KT3, Biosource International, Camarillo, Calif.) immunoreactivity by flow cytometry.
      <br/>
      Radiolabeling was performed by suspending 5 * 107 T cells in 0.5 mL RPMI 1640 medium with 7.5  MU Ci111 In-oxiquinoline (Amersham Corp., Arlington Hgts, Ill.) for 20 min at room temperature so that 2 * 107 T cells yielded approximately 0.5-2 * 106 cpm of  GAMMA  activity.
      <br/>
      The cells were then washed twice, resuspended in RPMI 1640 plus 10% normal rat serum, and 2 * 107 labeled T cells/200 gm body weight rat were injected intravenously at the time of KLH intradermal challenge.
      <br/>
      Skin challenge sites (8 mm in diameter) were counted on a  GAMMA  counter 24 hours after injection of radiolabeled T cells.
      <br/>
      Lung, liver, and spleen were also collected and counted as comparative indices for evaluation of input.
