      A covering for a flower pot with a floral grouping disposed therein and extending a distance above an upper end of the flower pot wherein the flower pot has a lower end and an outer peripheral surface.
      <br/>
      The covering includes a sheet of material having an upper surface, a lower surface and an outer peripheral surface with a sheet extension connected to the outer peripheral surface of the sheet of material and extending a distance from the outer peripheral surface of the sheet of material.
      <br/>
      The sheet of material is formed about the flower pot to a position wherein the sheet of material extends about substantially the entire outer peripheral surface of the flower pot to provide a decorative covering and the sheet extension is formed about the floral grouping to a position wherein the sheet extension extends about a substantial portion of the floral grouping to provide a protective covering.

      A pot opening 224 (FIGS. 31 and 33) is formed through the upper end 218 of the base 212 providing access to a pot receiving space 226 (FIGS. 31 and 33).
      <br/>
      The pot receiving space 226 forms an inner peripheral surface 228 in the base 212.
      <br/>
      As shown in FIGS. 31 and 32, the base 212 is generally cylindrically shaped, although the base 212 could be any geometric shape as may be desired in a particular application.

      <br/>
      The skirt 214 extends a distance radially outwardly from the base 212 terminating with an outer periphery 232.
      <br/>
      The skirt 214 has an inner peripheral face 234 (FIGS. 31 and 33) and an outer peripheral surface 236 (FIGS. 32 and 33).
      <br/>
      In one form, shown in FIGS. 31 and 32, a plurality of folds 238 also are formed in the skirt 214 with most of the folds 238 extending radially outwardly from the upper end 218 of the base 212 toward the outer periphery 232 of the skirt 214.

      The bonding material 240 more particularly is disposed near the connection 230 between the skirt 214 and the upper end 218 of the base 212 (FIG. 31).
      <br/>
      The bonding material 240 covers an area extending from the connection 230 of the skirt 214 to the upper end 218 of the base 212 a distance radially outwardly to a line 242 (FIG. 31) spaced a distance radially outwardly from the connection 230.
      <br/>
      Although the bonding material 240 is shown in FIGS. 31 and 32 in the form of a continuous strip of the bonding material 240, the bonding material 240 may be in the form of spots or spaced apart strips or any other form desired in a particular application suitable for effecting the crimping described below.

      When the bonding material 240 is a cohesive, a plurality of the flower pot covers 210 may be stacked one on top of the other with the base 212 of an adjacent flower pot cover being disposed in the pot receiving space 226 of an adjacent flower pot cover 210.
      <br/>
      When the bonding material 240 is a cohesive, the bonding material 240 will not cause one flower pot cover 210 to be bonded to an adjacent flower pot cover 210 when the flower pot covers 210 are stacked in the manner just described.
