      While these proposals address certain similar problems, particularly those related to lack of sleeping space in today's vehicles, they are all merely an extension of the vehicle's interior and/or exterior and can not be used independently of the vehicle.
      <br/>
      Also when compacted they all reside within the boundary of the vehicle significantly altering the available interior and/or exterior space of the vehicle as to negatively effect the function, economy and comfort of said vehicle.
    </p>
    <p num="7">No prior art is known, however, for a hitch-mounted camping devise that is carried on a vehicle hitch-arm, without additional support of wheels like in a trailer, but can be used independently of the vehicle when unfolded.</p>
    <heading>BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="8">
      The principal object of the present invention is to provide a fold-out living area supported and carried in its folded state by a hitch receiver and in its unfolded state by the means of height adjustable fold-out legs to the ground.
      <br/>
      In brief summary, the present invention overcomes the aforesaid problems of the prior art by providing an independent camping unit utilizing the carrying capability of a standard hitch receiver used for pulling campers, trailers, and such (without removing the function of the hitch) or alternately, in case no hitch receiver is available, clamped to a vehicle's bumper or frame.
      <br/>
      The fold-out floor sections, comprised of one or more sections, as well as the tent, mattresses and bedding accessories are all contained within the present folding camper.
      <br/>
      This invention comprises an expandable, substantially rigid floor section made of one or more floor boards hinged together in such way that they can either be unfolded to create an elevated floor space large enough for a living space or folded to fit on a vehicle's hitch arm.
      <br/>
      On this floor space is a tent semi-permanently mounted in such way to be easily erected when unfolding the floor boards.
      <br/>
      These floor-boards are further supported to the ground by means of expandable legs in such way that when unfolded, this camping unit is totally self-supported and can consequently be disconnected from the vehicle creating a vehicle-independent camper unit similar to a wheeled camper.
      <br/>
      In its folded (collapsed) state these floor sections will create a hard shell that crates the interior and tent part of the camper.
      <br/>
      The support legs are concealed within the floor sections in the collapsed state.
      <br/>
      It is also an object of the present invention to provide such a device that is of a simple, inexpensive construction.
      <br/>
      Another object is to provide such device in a lightweight form that can be disassembled as a unit or in parts for storage.
      <br/>
      Consequently the tent is removable with the means of snaps and each floor section can be disconnected as an item for storage.

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
    <p num="11">
      The preferred embodiment of the present invention will now be described in connection with the above-mentioned drawings.
      <br/>
      Refer now to FIG. 1, which is an overall conceptual drawing of a preferred embodiment of the "Hitch-mounted Fold-out Camper", hereafter referred to as the "Camper", in its folded, covered state.
      <br/>
      Here we can see the compacted "Camper" �FIG. 1 (1)� covered with a weather-proof cover �FIG. 1 (2)�. A preferred cover, due to its light weight, would be vinyl but any lightweight, weather proof, material including hard-sided material could be used.
      <br/>
      In this case the "Camper" is mounted on an extended Hitch-arm �FIG. 1 (3) and FIG. 17 (3)� with an additional rear hitch receiver �FIG. 1 (4) and FIG. 17 (4)�. A regular 2 inch hitch arm utilizing a 2-inch, 1/4 inch walls, square pipe (Class 3 hitch) will allow a 1.5-inch hitch-arm to be fitted inside said 2 inch arm, creating a Class 2 hitch �FIG. 17 (5)�, enough to tow a mid-size trailer/boat.
    </p>
    <p num="12">
      FIG. 2 is a conceptual drawing of a preferred embodiment of the "Camper" in its unfolded, for camping, usable state.
      <br/>
      In this case the unit is still connected to the car but it could very well be unhooked as an independent camper by pulling the pin �FIG. 17 (7)� holding the Hitch-arm to the vehicle's hitch-receiver �FIG. 17 (8)�. As the unit is totally supported by the ground with its adjustable fold-out legs �FIG. 2 (9)� there is no need to keep it attached to the vehicle.
      <br/>
      FIG. 12 show a close-up of the "Height-adjustable Fold-out legs", hereafter referred to as the "Legs", with its lockable support arm (6) and adjustable inner tube (34).
    </p>
    <p num="13">
      FIG. 3 is a cut-away drawing of the basic concept to better illustrate the invention.
      <br/>
      In basic terms, the unit is comprised of one or more floor board �FIG. 3 (10)� with at least one of them attached to the vehicle's receiver.
      <br/>
      In this case the forward floor board �FIG. 3 (10)�, from here on referred to as the "Base-plate", is mounted to the vehicles hitch-arm �FIG. 17 (3)�. To this "Base-plate" are possibly one or more floor-boards attached.
      <br/>
      In this sample three additional floor-boards �FIG. 3 (12)(13)(14)�. They are in turn connected with the means of quick-release hinges �FIG. 11 (15) with detailed drawing �FIG. 15�, so as to be able to unfold the said floor-boards into a largely flat surface (floor) supported to the ground with the "Legs" �FIG. 12�. Around the peripheral of this "floor" is an easily erected tent enclosure �FIG. 3 (16)� semi-permanently, by means of readily available canvas-snaps, mounted to create a living space while unfolded.
      <br/>
      Optionally, as shown in FIG. 3, the floor can be wholly or partly covered by semi-permanently installed mattresses �FIG. 3 (17)�. The "Camper" is designed to be able to hold each and all of the bedding equipment as well as the semi permanently mounted tent structure �FIG. 3 (16)� including its tent poles (35), both in its folded state �FIG. 5 (35)� as well as unfolded state �FIG. 3 (35)�.
    </p>
    <p num="14">
      While not in use as a camper the floor sections can all be disassembled as single floor sections and reassembled in the home to be used as a regular everyday bed or a guest bed.
      <br/>
      In this sample, floor boards �FIG. 3 (12)(13)(14)� can be assembled to create a light-weight king size bed.
      <br/>
      Although the unit can be made in any size, the preferred sizes are, U.S. double, queen and king not counting the base-plate �FIG. 3 (10)�. The "Base-plate" is designed to be used for storage, heaters, camping gears and such.
      <br/>
      For larger trucks and vans a 74-inch-wide unit allowing two double beds, arranged crosswise to the vehicles travel direction, can be made.
      <br/>
      In either case this will allow the "Camper" to use regular form-fitted bedding sheets for the respective size.
    </p>
    <p num="15">
      FIG. 4 illustrates the additional advantage of being able to simultaneously utilize the towing hitch's normal function, in this case towing a boat.
      <br/>
      Here the optional Class 2 hitch �FIG. 17 (5)� fitted into the extended Hitch-arm �FIG. 17 (3)� was used to connect the trailer to the "Camper".
    </p>
    <p num="16">
      Refer now to FIGS. 5 to 8 for an illustrated step-by-step instruction on how to unfold the "Camper".
      <br/>
      To make the procedure clear the tent canvas has been removed for this demonstration.
    </p>
    <p num="17">
      Step 1. �FIG. 5� Remove the cover.
      <br/>
      The interior of the Camper" can now be seen with, in this case, the folded mattresses (17) and tent poles (35).
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      Step 2.
      <br/>
      Unfold the "Legs" (9) on the rear vertical floor board (12) and swing the unit backward until the "Legs" rest on the ground as in (FIG. 6).
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      Step 4.
      <br/>
      Do the same with floor board (13) and lower it to the ground. �FIG. 7�.
    </p>
    <p num="20">
      Step 5.
      <br/>
      Again do the same with floor board �FIG. 8 (14)�. In case a foldable mattress is used it can now be flipped �FIG. 7 (19)� into place.
      <br/>
      The only thing left at this point is to erect the normally attached tent.
      <br/>
      Again for this demonstration the tent canvas has not been shown to make the demonstration clear although the steps with the canvas attached are the same.
    </p>
    <p num="21">
      While in its folded state the whole unit can be folded back, as illustrated in �FIG. 9�, to be able to access the vehicle's back door.
      <br/>
      This is accomplished by adding a hinged swing arm �FIG. 10 (20)� to each side of the extended hitch-arm �FIG. 10 (3)� with a rear pivot point �FIG. 10 (21)�. By pulling the forward pin �FIG. 10 (22)� the compacted, folded, "Camper" can swing back as a unit �FIG. 9� and thereby allow easy access to the rear of the vehicle.
    </p>
    <p num="22">
      FIG. 11 shows the framework for the "Camper" as well as the suggested hardware used in the assembly.
      <br/>
      The frame (23) is preferably made of lightweight aluminum covered by any light-weight material, solid or soft, such as plywood or stretched canvas �FIG. 3 (10)�. Each Fold-out frame has at least two "Legs" (9), detailed in FIG. 12. It also illustrates the locations of the quick release hinges between the Fold-out sections �FIG. 11 (15)�. A detailed illustration of the hinges can be found in FIG. 15. As seen on this partially cut-away drawing �FIG. 15� of the quick-release hinge, the two sections A and B can be easily separated by pressing the two release levels (24) compressing the spring (26).
      <br/>
      This forces the two hinge pins (25) to pull out of the two hinge sections (27) attached to section A, thereby disconnecting the two floor sections.
      <br/>
      This will allow for quick assembly as well as disassembly of the unit, breaking it down to smaller, light-weight, floor boards that can be easily handled, stored as flat units, or used as a regular bed by reassembling the sections in the home.
      <br/>
      To prevent the floor sections from folding beyond 90 degrees while folding the unit and to make the unit more rigid while folded, each section also contains an angulation limiting device (28) detailed in FIGS. 13 and 14. This angulation device is comprised of a tube (29) and a rod (30) inserted to each other and attached in one end of each rod/tube to a hinge-bracket (31) which in turn is fixed to the frames for the floor-boards.
      <br/>
      The length of the rod is so designed as to reach the tube's hinge pin (32) when the two sections reach an angle of 90 degrees preventing further angulation.
      <br/>
      Although not a required addition, it greatly helps in handling the unit.
    </p>
    <p num="23">
      FIG. 16 illustrates the use of an optional rear light-bar/license plate holder (33) inserted into the rear end of the extended hitch-arm (3).
      <br/>
      This is only needed in case the folded "Camper" would cover the vehicles rear lights or license plate.
      <br/>
      The electrical hookup to the vehicle is made by using the regular trailer light outlet just like a trailer.
      <br/>
      This light bar could in addition be outfitted with a tow hitch as illustrated in FIG. 17 (5).
    </p>
    <p num="24">
      FIG. 17 (3) is a perspective view of a preferred Extended Hitch-arm that the "Camper" is resting on.
      <br/>
      The rear end of the extended hitch arm (4) with its square hole (hitch receiver) can also be seen.
      <br/>
      This "receiver` will allow for an optional hitch arm/ball-holder and/or the previously mentioned light-bar (33) to be fitted to said extended hitch-arm.
