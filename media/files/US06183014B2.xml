      A device for damping the belt tension which occurs in a seat belt (16) in the event of a momentary stress of great force.
      <br/>
      In order for momentary stresses of great force on the seat belt (16) to be able to be absorbed without injury being caused, the device has at least two reels (6, 14), rollers or the like which deflect the seat belt (16) from its straight-line extent and at least one (14) of which can yield elastically in the transverse direction of the extent when a preset maximum force is exceeded.

    <heading>FIELD AND BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="1">
      When belts in motor vehicles are worn, there occur, in the event of a crash or in the event of a sudden deceleration, momentary stresses of great force on the belt itself, resulting in the fabric of the seat belt stretching.
      <br/>
      Cases have even been known in which the belt itself tears, with the result that it is no longer able to carry out the safety function for which it is responsible.
    </p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">It is an object of the invention to provide a seat belt such that momentary stresses of great force on the seat belt can be absorbed without injury being caused.</p>
    <p num="3">This object is achieved by a device for damping the belt tension which occurs in a seat belt in the event of a momentary stress of great force, having at least two reels, rollers or the like which deflect the seat belt from a straight-line extent and at least one of which can yield elastically in a transverse direction of the extent when a preset maximum force is exceeded.</p>
    <p num="4">
      As a result of a development of this type, a device of the type concerned having great safety value is provided.
      <br/>
      In the event of a normal stress of force, as results, for example when putting the seat belt on, or in the event of normal braking forces, there is no yielding movement of the appropriate deflection reel counter to its elastic support, since the stress does not exceed the preset maximum force.
      <br/>
      In contrast, in the event of a crash in which naturally a momentary stress of great force on the seat belt is effective, the elastically supported deflection reel is able to yield elastically because the preset maximum force is exceeded, with the result that force peaks which become effective in the seat belt due to deformation are smoothed over.
      <br/>
      The risk of the seat belt tearing or starting to tear is thus avoided.
      <br/>
      One or more deflection reels can be provided, depending on requirements, the reels yielding elastically when the preset maximum force is exceeded.
      <br/>
      The greater the number of these displaceable deflection rollers, the greater is the smoothing over of the force peaks.
      <br/>
      In detail, the device is provided in such a manner that the seat belt is guided in a wavy manner through at least three deflection reels situated in a row one behind another.
      <br/>
      Provision is made here for the central deflection reel to be supported by the pretensioned, elastic cushion.
      <br/>
      In order to achieve cost-effective production of the device, the latter has a housing which is U-shaped in cross section, has screw-on tabs and consists of bent steel plate.
      <br/>
      The U-limbs are used to mount the corresponding deflection reels.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, the U-shaped housing entails the advantage of arranging the elastic cushion, which in particular is made of foam, in the U-space, which elastic cushion is covered by a covering plate which bears the movable reel.
      <br/>
      At the preset maximum force, said covering plate is supported on the elastic cushion which, for its part, is supported on the U-shaped housing.
      <br/>
      The covering plate is held in the pretensioned position in a simple manner by means of holding tabs which are bent off from the U-limbs.
      <br/>
      It should furthermore be stressed that the axes of the deflection reels lie in a plane parallel to the U-web of the U-shaped housing.
      <br/>
      When the device according to the invention is arranged in a motor vehicle it is particularly advantageous to arrange the device on the body, between the belt retractor device and the outlet opening which is situated at shoulder height.
      <br/>
      In this case, the location may, for example, be on the B- or C-pillar.
      <br/>
      The device is of relatively low construction and so it is also possible, and favorable, to provide a cover for the device.

    <heading>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading>
    <p num="5">

    </p>
    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading>
    <p num="6">
      The device which is designated as a whole by the number 1 has a housing 2 which is essentially U-shaped in cross section.
      <br/>
      The housing consists of steel plate and has a U-web 3 which is formed as a supporting plate and has U-limbs 4 bent off from said housing.
      <br/>
      Each U-limb 4 forms two small bearing brackets 4' which are situated one behind the other in the longitudinal direction and are intended for holding the spindles 5 of deflection reels 6 in such a manner that the axes thereof run parallel to the U-web 3.
    </p>
    <p num="7">Screw-on tabs 7 protrude over the narrow edges of the U-web 3 in order to secure the device 1, for example, on a B-pillar 8 (dash-dotted lines) of a motor vehicle.</p>
    <p num="8">
      The U-space 9 serves to hold an elastic cushion 10 which in the embodiment consists of a suitable foam.
      <br/>
      The elastic cushion 10 is covered by a covering plate 11 which extends between the U-limbs 4.
      <br/>
      In the region between the two deflection reels 6 there are bent off from the covering plate 11 two bearing tabs 12 which are situated at the same height and into which the bearing spindles 13 of a central deflection reel 14, which is situated between the two deflection reels 6, engage.
      <br/>
      By means of holding tabs 15, which are bent off inward from the U-limbs, the covering plate 11 is held in a pretensioned position in which all of the axes of the deflection reels 6, 14 run parallel to the U-web 3.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      By means of the deflection reels 6, 14 a seat belt 16 is guided through the device in a wavy profile.
      <br/>
      The wavy profile is such that the seat belt loops around the outside of the central deflection reel 14.
      <br/>
      Following the two outer deflection reels 6, the seat belt 16 leaves the device through guide slots 17 which are situated in tabs 18 which are bent upward from the end of the covering plate 11.
      <br/>
      The lower end of the seat belt 16 emerging from the device 1 is guided to a belt retractor device 19 (illustrated diagrammatically), while the upper end of the seat belt leaves an outlet opening (not shown), which is situated at shoulder height, in a panel 20 (shown by dash-dotted lines).
      <br/>
      The panel is secured to the B-pillar.
      <br/>
      The outlet opening can be provided in such a manner that it can be adjusted in its height in order to take account of differing heights of the people on the vehicle seat.
      <br/>
      The pretensioned position of the covering plate 11 is such that in the event of normal loads occurring on the seat belt 16, no change in position of the movable deflection reel 14 and hence of the covering plate 11 occurs.
      <br/>
      These normal loads result, for example, when the seat belt is put on and in the event of normal braking forces.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      In the event of a momentary stress of great force, such as occurs, for example, in the event of a crash, the seat belt strives to take up a straight-line extent in the region of the wavy profile in the device 1.
      <br/>
      This leads to the central deflection reel 14 being displaced together with the covering plate 11 against the elastic cushion 10 and, connected therewith, the force peaks are smoothed over due to deformation of the elastic cushion.
      <br/>
      Damping thus occurs which protects the seat belt 16 from excessive stress and largely prevents the seat belt from starting to tear or tearing.
    </p>
