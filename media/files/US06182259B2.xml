      First and second digital data to which a code to correct errors was added are inputted.
      <br/>
      For a certain period of time, processes to detect errors in the first and second digital data are executed in accordance with the order of the first digital data and the second digital data.
      <br/>
      In this period of time, on the basis of the processing results, processes to correct the errors in the first and second digital data are executed in accordance with the order of the second digital data and the first digital data.
      <br/>
      Thus, the error detecting processes of the digital data that is inputted on a predetermined unit basis can be executed in parallel and an error correcting process in which a circuit scale is small and costs are low can be realized.

      Field of the Invention
    </p>
    <p num="2">The invention relates to a program for an error correcting process included in an error correcting device, method, and medium and, more particularly, to a technique for performing an error correcting process to digital data to which a code for detecting and correcting an error was added.</p>
    <p num="3">2. Related Background Art</p>
    <p num="4">
      Hitherto, in case of recording or transmitting digital data, it is a general way to add additional data for detecting and correcting errors of the digital data.
      <br/>
      By checking the additional data at the time of reproduction or reception, an error occurring at the time of recording or reproduction of the digital data or during the transmission can be detected and corrected.
      <br/>
      A Reed Solomon code which is used as such additional code is excellent in an ability for detecting and correcting an error and is used in many signal processing systems.
    </p>
    <p num="5">FIG. 1 is a block diagram showing a general error detecting processing device using the Reed Solomon code.</p>
    <p num="6">In FIG. 1, reference numeral 101 denotes an input terminal; 102 a syndrome generating circuit; 103 a data bus; 104 a selector circuit; 105 a syndrome memory A; 106 a syndrome memory B; 107 a bus control circuit; 108 a circuit for calculating an error position and an error value; and 109 an output terminal.</p>
    <p num="7">
      Digital data of a predetermined unit to which the Reed Solomon code was added is inputted to the syndrome generating circuit 102 through the input terminal 101.
      <br/>
      The syndrome generating circuit 102 generates a syndrome on the basis of the Reed Solomon code of the digital data of each unit.
      <br/>
      After the syndrome of the digital data of each unit was generated, it is inputted to the selector circuit 104 via the data bus 103 while being controlled by the bus control circuit 107.
      <br/>
      The selector circuit 104 alternately records the syndromes of the digital data into the syndrome memory A 105 or syndrome memory B 106 on a predetermined unit basis.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      The syndromes of the digital data recorded in the syndrome memory A 105 or syndrome memory B 106 are alternately read out by the selector circuit 104 while being controlled by the bus control circuit 107 and are inputted to the error position and error value calculating circuit 108 through the data bus 103.
      <br/>
      The error position and error value calculating circuit 108 executes an Euclidean method, a chain search, or the like to the syndromes generated from the digital data of a predetermined unit, thereby calculating the error position and the error value.
      <br/>
      Arithmetic operation results are outputted from the output terminal 109 and the errors are corrected by an error correcting circuit (not shown).
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      As mentioned above, in case of detecting and correcting the error of the digital data by using, for example, the Reed Solomon code, it is generally necessary to sequentially perform a generation of syndromes, a calculation of an error polynomial, a chain search, and a calculation of the error position and the error value.
      <br/>
      In order to detect and correct the error in the digital data of a predetermined unit every unit, it is necessary to sequentially execute a series of those processes.
      <br/>
      In the conventional device, the generation of the syndromes of each unit and the calculation of the error position and the error value are alternately processed by using one selector circuit and two syndrome memories.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      However, in case of processing two kinds of digital data (for example, digital audio data and digital image data) in parallel by using the conventional device as mentioned above, one selector circuit and two syndrome memories are further necessary.
      <br/>
      Therefore, for example, in case of processing a motion image with an audio sound, it is necessary to process the digital audio data and the digital image data in parallel within a predetermined period of time, so that there is a drawback such that a circuit scale is large and large costs are required.

    <p num="26">�First embodiment�</p>
    <p num="27">FIG. 2 is a block diagram showing a construction of an error correcting device according to the first embodiment of the present invention.</p>
    <p num="28">In FIG. 2, reference numeral 201 denotes an input terminal; 202 a syndrome generating circuit; 203 a data bus; 204 a video selector circuit; 205 a video syndrome memory A; 206 a video syndrome memory B; 207 an audio syndrome memory; 208 a circuit for calculating an error position and an error value; 209 a bus control circuit; and 210 an output terminal.</p>
    <p num="29">
      In FIG. 2, reference numeral 211 denotes an error detecting device constructed by the circuits 201 to 210.
      <br/>
      The error detecting device 211 calculates an error position and an error value of digital data (to which a code for error detection and correction has been added) inputted from the input terminal 201 and outputs calculation results from the output terminal 210.
      <br/>
      Reference numeral 212 denotes a memory to store digital video data and digital audio data of a predetermined unit (for example, as much as one track or one picture plane) to which a code (for instance, Reed Solomon product code) to detect and correct the error has been added.
      <br/>
      The digital video data and digital audio data stored in the memory 212 are alternately read out and supplied to the input terminal 201.
      <br/>
      The digital data (to which the code for error detection and correction has been added) to be written into the memory 212 is, for example, data that was reproduced from an external recording medium or was inputted from an external transmission path.
      <br/>
      Reference numeral 213 denotes an error correcting circuit for correcting the errors of the digital video data or digital audio data stored in the memory 212 by using the error positions and the error values of the digital video data or digital audio data as much as one track which was outputted from the output terminal 210.
      <br/>
      Reference numeral 214 denotes a control circuit for controlling the error detecting device 211, memory 212, and error correcting circuit 213 and for controlling so as to execute calculations to detect and correct the errors in the digital data (in the embodiment, video data and audio data) which is stored into the memory 212 in parallel.
    </p>
    <p num="30">The operation of the error correcting device constructed as mentioned above will now be described hereinbelow.</p>
    <p num="31">The digital audio data and digital video data as much as one track or one picture plane inputted from the input terminal 201 are alternately inputted to the syndrome generating circuit 202 and syndromes are generated.</p>
    <p num="32">After the syndromes of the digital audio data of one track were generated, they are recorded into the audio syndrome memory 207 on a track unit basis through the data bus 203 while being controlled by the bus control circuit 209.</p>
    <p num="33">
      After the syndromes of the digital video data of one track were generated, they are inputted to the video selector circuit 204 through the data bus 203 while being controlled by the bus control circuit 209.
      <br/>
      The video selector circuit 204 switches the video syndrome memory A 205 and video syndrome memory B 206 serving as two banks on a track unit basis, thereby allowing the inputted syndromes to be alternately recorded into each bank.
    </p>
    <p num="34">
      The syndromes of the digital video data of one track recorded in the video syndrome memory A 205 or video syndrome memory B 206 are alternately read out by the video selector circuit 204 and are inputted to the error position and error value calculating circuit 208 through the data bus 203 while being controlled by the bus control circuit 209.
      <br/>
      The error position and error value calculating circuit 208 calculates the error positions and the error values of the digital video data from the inputted syndromes by using the Euclidean method, chain search, or the like and outputs the calculation results to the output terminal 210.
    </p>
    <p num="35">
      The error position and the error value of the digital video data calculated by the error detecting device 211 are outputted from the output terminal 210 and inputted to the error correcting circuit 213.
      <br/>
      The error correcting circuit 213 corrects the error of the digital video data stored in the memory 212 by using the error position and the error value.
      <br/>
      After completion of the error correcting process of the digital video data of one track stored in the memory 212, the contents in the memory 212 are rewritten to the digital video data of the next track.
    </p>
    <p num="36">
      After the calculation of the error positions and the error values of the digital video data as much as one track was finished, error positions and error values of the digital audio data are calculated.
      <br/>
      That is, syndromes of the digital audio data as much as one track recorded in the audio syndrome memory 207 are read out from the audio syndrome memory 207 and are inputted to the error position and error value calculating circuit 208 through the data bus 203 while being controlled by the bus control circuit 209.
      <br/>
      On the basis of the syndromes of the digital audio data of one track inputted to the error position and error value calculating circuit 208, the calculating circuit 208 calculates the error positions and the error values of the digital audio data from the inputted syndromes by using the Euclidean method, chain search, or the like and outputs the calculation results to the output terminal 210.

      The error correcting circuit 213 corrects the error of the digital audio data stored in the memory 212 by using the error position and the error value.
      <br/>
      After completion of the error correcting process of the digital audio data of one track stored in the memory 212, the contents in the memory 212 are rewritten to the digital audio data of the next track.

      In the embodiment, the syndrome generating process of the audio data and the error position and error value calculating process of the video data are processed in parallel as shown in FIG. 3.
      <br/>
      In one process interval shown in FIG. 3, the syndrome generating circuit 202 executes the processes in accordance with the order of Audio(i+1) and Video(i+1).
      <br/>
      At the same time, the error position and error value calculating circuit 208 executes the processes in accordance with the order of Video(i) as data of one track before of Video(i+1) and Audio(i+1) which was subjected to the syndrome generating process during the calculation of the error position and the error value of Video(i).
    </p>
    <p num="42">
      The error detecting device 211 of the embodiment processes the respective data in parallel by using a point that the time that is required for the error position and error value calculating process and the correcting process of the digital video data is longer than the time that is required for the syndrome generating process of the digital audio data.
      <br/>
      That is, by performing the error correcting process (syndrome generating process and the error position and error value calculating process) for the digital audio data within one process interval, the number of syndrome memories for audio data can be reduced to one memory.
