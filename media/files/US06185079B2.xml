      A disk drive system having a magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ) sensor having two MTJ stacks between first and second shields and a common electrode disposed between the two MTJ stacks.
      <br/>
      A first sense current is provided to the first MTJ stack by the first shield and the common electrode and a second sense current is provided to the second MTJ stack by the second shield and the common electrode.
      <br/>
      The magnetization directions of the pinned layers of the first and second MTJ stacks are fixed perpendicular to the ABS and antiparallel with respect to each other so that the magnetoresistive signal generated due to an external field from a disk by the first MTJ stack differs in phase by 180° with respect to the magnetoresistive signal generated due to the same external field by the second MTJ stack.
      <br/>
      The voltages developed across the two MTJ stacks (voltages due to the presence of thermal asperities and voltages due to the presence of data fields) are applied to the inputs of a differential amplifier for substantial elimination of the thermal asperity signal.

      Field of the Invention
    </p>
    <p num="2">This invention relates in general to a direct access storage device (DASD) of the type utilizing magnetoresistive read sensors for reading signals recorded in a magnetic medium and, more particularly, it relates to a DASD having a novel magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ) sensor for minimizing the effect of thermal asperities.</p>
    <p num="3">2. Description of Related Art</p>
    <p num="4">
      Computers often include auxiliary memory storage devices having media on which data can be written and from which data can be read for later use.
      <br/>
      A direct access storage device (disk drive) incorporating rotating magnetic disks is commonly used for storing data in magnetic form on the disk surfaces.
      <br/>
      Data is recorded on concentric, radially spaced tracks on the disk surfaces.
      <br/>
      Magnetic heads including read sensors are then used to read data from the tracks on the disk surfaces.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      In high capacity disk drives, magnetoresistive read sensors, commonly referred to as MR heads, are the prevailing read sensor because of their capability to read data from a surface of a disk at greater track and linear densities than thin film inductive heads.
      <br/>
      An MR sensor detects a magnetic field through the change in the resistance of its MR sensing layer (also referred to as an "MR element") as a function of the strength and direction of the magnetic flux being sensed by the MR layer.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      The conventional MR sensor operates on the basis of the anisotropic magnetoresistive (AMR) effect in which an MR element resistance varies as the square of the cosine of the angle between the magnetization in the MR element and the direction of sense current flowing through the MR element.
      <br/>
      Recorded data can be read from a magnetic medium because the external magnetic field from the recorded magnetic medium (the signal field) causes a change in the direction of magnetization in the MR element, which in turn causes a change in resistance in the MR element and a corresponding change in the sensed current or voltage.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      Another type of MR sensor is the giant magnetoresistance (GMR) sensor manifesting the GMR effect.
      <br/>
      In GMR sensors, the resistance of the MR sensing layer varies as a function of the spin-dependent transmission of the conduction electrons between magnetic layers separated by a non-magnetic layer (spacer) and the accompanying spin-dependent scattering which takes place at the interface of the magnetic and non-magnetic layers and within the magnetic layers.
    </p>
    <p num="8">GMR sensors using only two layers of ferromagnetic material (e.g., Ni--Fe or Co or Ni--Fe--Co of Ni--Fe/Co) separated by a layer of non-magnetic material (e.g., copper) are generally referred to as spin valve (SV) sensors manifesting the SV effect.</p>
    <p num="9">
      FIG. 1 shows a prior art SV sensor 100 comprising end regions 104 and 106 separated by a central region 102.
      <br/>
      A first ferromagnetic layer, referred to as a pinned layer 120, has its magnetization typically fixed (pinned) by exchange coupling with an antiferromagnetic (AFM) layer 125.
      <br/>
      The magnetization of a second ferromagnetic layer, referred to as a free layer 110, is not fixed and is free to rotate in response to the magnetic field from the recorded magnetic medium (the signal field).
      <br/>
      The free layer 110 is separated from the pinned layer 120 by a non-magnetic, electrically conducting spacer layer 115.
      <br/>
      Hard bias layers 130 and 135 formed in the end regions 104 and 106, respectively, provide longitudinal bias for the free layer 110.
      <br/>
      Leads 140 and 145 formed on hard bias layers 130 and 135, respectively, provide electrical connections for sensing the resistance of the SV sensor 100.
      <br/>
      IBM's U.S. Pat. No. 5,206,590 granted to Dieny et al., incorporated herein by reference, discloses a GMR sensor operating on the basis of the SV effect.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      Another type of magnetic device currently under development is a magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ) device.
      <br/>
      The MTJ device has potential applications as a memory cell and as a magnetic field sensor.
      <br/>
      The MTJ device comprises two ferromagnetic layers separated by a thin, electrically insulating, tunnel barrier layer.
      <br/>
      The tunnel barrier layer is sufficiently thin that quantum-mechanical tunneling of charge carriers occurs between the ferromagnetic layers.
      <br/>
      The tunneling process is electron spin dependent, which means that the tunneling current across the junction depends on the spin-dependent electronic properties of the ferromagnetic materials and is a function of the relative orientation of the magnetic moments, or magnetization directions, of the two ferromagnetic layers.
      <br/>
      In the MTJ sensor, one ferromagnetic layer has its magnetic moment fixed, or pinned, and the other ferromagnetic layer has its magnetic moment free to rotate in response to an external magnetic field from the recording medium (the signal field).
      <br/>
      When an electric potential is applied between the two ferromagnetic layers, the sensor resistance is a function of the tunneling current across the insulating layer between the ferromagnetic layers.
      <br/>
      Since the tunneling current that flows perpendicularly through the tunnel barrier layer depends on the relative magnetization directions of the two ferromagnetic layers, recorded data can be read from a magnetic medium because the signal field causes a change of direction of magnetization of the free layer, which in turn causes a change in resistance of the MTJ sensor and a corresponding change in the sensed current or voltage.
      <br/>
      IBM's U.S. Pat. No. 5,650,958 granted to Gallagher et al., incorporated in its entirety herein by reference, discloses an MTJ sensor operating on the basis of the magnetic tunnel junction effect.
    </p>
    <p num="11">
      FIG. 2 shows a prior art MTJ sensor 200 comprising a first electrode 204, a second electrode 202, and a tunnel barrier 215.
      <br/>
      The first electrode 204 comprises a pinned layer (pinned ferromagnetic layer) 220, an antiferromagnetic (AFM) layer 230, and a seed layer 240.
      <br/>
      The magnetization of the pinned layer 220 is fixed through exchange coupling with the AFM layer 230.
      <br/>
      The second electrode 202 comprises a free layer (free ferromagnetic layer) 210 and a cap layer 205.
      <br/>
      The free layer 210 is separated from the pinned layer 220 by a non-magnetic, electrically insulating tunnel barrier layer 215.
      <br/>
      In the absence of an external magnetic field, the free layer 210 has its magnetization oriented in the direction shown by arrow 212, that is, generally perpendicular to the magnetization direction of the pinned layer 220 shown by arrow 222 (tail of the arrow that is pointing into the plane of the paper).
      <br/>
      A first lead 260 and a second lead 265 formed in contact with first electrode 204 and second electrode 202, respectively, provide electrical connections for the flow of sensing current Is from a current source 270 to the MTJ sensor 200.
      <br/>
      A signal detector 280, typically including a recording channel such as a partial-response maximum-likelihood (PRML) channel, connected to the first and second leads 260 and 265 senses the change in resistance due to changes induced in the free layer 210 by the external magnetic field.
    </p>
    <p num="12">
      As mentioned earlier, an MR sensor exhibits a change in resistance when in the presence of a changing magnetic field.
      <br/>
      This resistance change is transformed into a voltage signal by passing a constant sense current through the MR element.
      <br/>
      The value of the DC voltage for a given MR sensor is the product of the constant sense current and the total resistance between the MR sensor leads.
      <br/>
      Since the change in the resistance is the principal upon which the MR sensor operates, the change in resistance can substantially effect the performance of the MR sensor and the disk drive incorporating the MR sensor.
    </p>
    <p num="13">
      A phenomena, known as a thermal asperity (TA), can suddenly increase the MR sensor temperature by more than 100 degrees C. The cause of this sudden temperature rise is a collision or near collision of the MR sensor with a protrusion on the disk surface while reading information from a track.
      <br/>
      The collision causes the DC base voltage of the MR sensor to shift substantially thus making the information unreadable.
    </p>
    <p num="14">
      FIG. 3 is a graph illustrating the DC base (bias) voltage 310, the thermal asperity voltage 320, which is the shift and decay in the base DC voltage 310, the data signal 335 read back from the disk in the absence of the thermal asperity 320, and the data signal 340 read back from the disk in the presence of the thermal asperity 320.
      <br/>
      Note that the thermal asperity 320 comprises a sudden shift 325 in the DC base voltage followed by an exponential decay 330 in the DC base voltage.
      <br/>
      The exponential decay 330 in the DC base voltage continues until the DC base voltage 310 is reached.
      <br/>
      It should be noted that the sudden shift 325 in the DC base voltage could be several times larger than the data signal 335 causing the electrical circuitry connected directly or indirectly to the MR sensor to saturate leading to the loss of the data.
      <br/>
      The loss of the data, depending on the size of the thermal asperity 320, could very easily be several bytes long, each byte being eight bits long.
    </p>
    <p num="15">Known arrangements in disk drives for minimizing the effect of thermal asperity on the read data utilize either a separate asperity reduction circuit (ARC) module which is costly or a complicated data channel (such as modified partial-response maximum likelihood channel) having a normal operating mode and an asperity recovery mode.</p>
    <p num="16">
      MR sensors and spin valve sensors with thermal asperity reduction circuitry to compensate for the effect of thermal asperities are described in IBM's U.S. Pat. No. 5,793,576 to Gill and in IBM's U.S. Pat. No. 5,793,207 to Gill, respectively, the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.
      <br/>
      These applications describe sensors having four leads, two leads for providing sense current to the MR or SV sensor and two leads for providing current to an asperity compensation layer.
      <br/>
      The voltages developed across the MR or SV element (voltages due to the presence of thermal asperities and voltages due to the presence of data fields) and the asperity compensation layer (voltages due to the presence of thermal asperities) are applied to the inputs of a differential amplifier for substantial elimination of the thermal asperity signal.
    </p>
    <p num="17">
      Thermal asperities present similar problems for MTJ sensors as for MR and SV sensors.
      <br/>
      The MTJ sensor resistance changes as the spin dependent tunneling current through the tunnel barrier layer in the sensor changes due to the magnetic field of the data recorded on the disk.
      <br/>
      The base resistance of the MTJ sensor due to a constant bias voltage applied across the tunnel barrier layer decreases when a thermal asperity causes an increase of the temperature of the tunnel barrier layer.
      <br/>
      The resulting exponentially decaying thermal asperity signal interferes with detection of the superimposed data signal.
    </p>
    <p num="18">Therefore, there is a need for an invention that minimizes the effect of thermal asperities for MTJ sensors without utilizing a complicated recording channel or a separate ARC module.</p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="19">It is an object of the present invention to disclose a magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ) sensor for substantially eliminating the thermal asperity phenomena in disk drives utilizing MTJ sensors.</p>
    <p num="20">It is another object of the present invention to disclose a method and means for detecting and substantially eliminating the thermal asperity phenomena in disk drives utilizing MTJ sensors.</p>
    <p num="21">
      These and other objects and advantages are attained in accordance with the principles of the present invention by a magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ) sensor having a first MTJ stack separated from a second MTJ stack by a common electrode.
      <br/>
      Electrodes for providing sense current to the first MTJ stack and to the second MTJ stack are provided by a first shield and a second shield, respectively.
    </p>
    <p num="22">
      The first MTJ stack has a free layer separated from a pinned layer by a tunnel barrier layer.
      <br/>
      An AFM layer adjacent to the pinned layer provides an exchange field to fix (pin) the magnetization of the pinned layer perpendicular to the ABS.
      <br/>
      The magnetization of the free layer is oriented parallel to the ABS and is free to rotate in the presence of a signal magnetic field.
    </p>
    <p num="23">
      Similarly, the second MTJ stack has a free layer separated from a pinned layer by a tunnel barrier layer.
      <br/>
      An AFM layer adjacent to the pinned layer provides an exchange field to fix (pin) the magnetization of the pinned layer perpendicular to the ABS and antiparallel to the magnetization direction of the pinned layer of the first MTJ stack.
      <br/>
      The magnetization of the free layer is oriented parallel to the ABS and is free to rotate in the presence of a signal magnetic field.
    </p>
    <p num="24">With the magnetizations of the pinned layers of the two MTJ stacks fixed perpendicular to the ABS and antiparallel with respect to each other, the magnetoresistive signal generated due to an external field from the disk by the first MTJ stack will differ in phase by 180 (degree)  with respect to the magnetoresistive signal generated due to the same external field by the second MTJ stack.</p>
    <p num="25">
      The free layer of the first MTJ stack and the free layer of the second MTJ stack are both adjacent to the common electrode that is disposed between the first and second MTJ stacks.
      <br/>
      A first current source connected to the first shield and the common electrode provides sense current to the first MTJ stack and a second current source connected to the second shield and the common electrode provides sense current to the second MTJ stack.
      <br/>
      Under DC conditions (no signal field), the currents flowing in each MTJ stack are adjusted so that the product of the current flowing in the first MTJ stack and the resistance of the first MTJ stack is equal to the product of the current flowing through the second MTJ stack and the resistance of the second MTJ stack.
      <br/>
      The voltage developed across the first MTJ stack is fed into the first input terminal of a differential circuit and the voltage developed across the second MTJ stack is fed into the second input terminal of the differential circuit.
      <br/>
      The differential circuit further has an output terminal and a ground (common) terminal.
    </p>
    <p num="26">
      In the presence of a thermal asperity, the resistance of both MTJ stacks change and because the currents were adjusted to give equal products of current and resistance across each MTJ stack, the thermal asperity signal developed across the first MTJ stack and the thermal asperity signal developed across the second MTJ stack are substantially of the same shape, magnitude and phase.
      <br/>
      However, in the presence of a data field from the disk, the magnetoresistive signal generated across the first MTJ stack differs in phase by 180 (degree)  with respect to the magnetoresistive signal generated across the second MTJ stack.
    </p>
    <p num="27">
      Since the thermal asperity signal is present and common at both input terminals of the differential circuit, it will be cancelled by the differential circuit.
      <br/>
      However the magnetoresistive signals due to the data field on the disk differ in phase by 180 (degree)  at the two input terminals resulting in an output signal equal to the sum of the magnetoresistive signals at the two input terminals.

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading>
    <p num="30">
      The following description is the best embodiment presently contemplated for carrying out the present invention.
      <br/>
      This description is made for the purpose of illustrating the general principles of the present invention and is not meant to limit the inventive concepts claimed herein.
    </p>
    <p num="31">
      Referring now to FIG. 4, there is shown a disk drive 400 embodying the present invention.
      <br/>
      As shown in FIG. 4, at least one rotatable magnetic disk 412 is supported on a spindle 414 and rotated by a disk drive motor 418.
      <br/>
      The magnetic recording media on each disk is in the form of an annular pattern of concentric data tracks (not shown) on the disk 412.
    </p>
    <p num="32">
      At least one slider 413 is positioned on the disk 412, each slider 413 supporting one or more magnetic read/write heads 421 where the head 421 incorporates the MTJ sensor of the present invention.
      <br/>
      As the disks rotate, the slider 413 is moved radially in and out over the disk surface 422 so that the heads 421 may access different portions of the disk where desired data is recorded.
      <br/>
      Each slider 413 is attached to an actuator arm 419 by means of a suspension 415.
      <br/>
      The suspension 415 provides a slight spring force which biases the slider 413 against the disk surface 422.
      <br/>
      Each actuator arm 419 is attached to an actuator 427.
      <br/>
      The actuator as shown in FIG. 4 may be a voice coil motor (VCM).
      <br/>
      The VCM comprises a coil movable within a fixed magnetic field, the direction and speed of the coil movements being controlled by the motor current signals supplied by a controller 429.
    </p>
    <p num="33">
      During operation of the disk storage system, the rotation of the disk 412 generates an air bearing between the slider 413 (the surface of the slider 413 which includes the head 421 and faces the surface of the disk 412 is referred to as an air bearing surface (ABS)) and the disk surface 422 which exerts an upward force or lift on the slider.
      <br/>
      The air bearing thus counter-balances the slight spring force of the suspension 415 and supports the slider 413 off and slightly above the disk surface by a small, substantially constant spacing during normal operation.
    </p>
    <p num="34">
      The various components of the disk storage system are controlled in operation by control signals generated by the control unit 429, such as access control signals and internal clock signals.
      <br/>
      Typically, the control unit 429 comprises logic control circuits, storage chips and a microprocessor.
      <br/>
      The control unit 429 generates control signals to control various system operations such as drive motor control signals on line 423 and head position and seek control signals on line 428.
      <br/>
      The control signals on line 428 provide the desired current profiles to optimally move and position the slider 413 to the desired data track on the disk 412.
      <br/>
      Read and write signals are communicated to and from the read/write heads 421 by the recording channel 425.
      <br/>
      Recording channel 425 may be a partial response maximum likelihood (PMRL) channel or a peak detect channel.
      <br/>
      The design and implementation of both channels are well known in the art and to persons skilled in the art.
      <br/>
      In the preferred embodiment, recording channel 425 is a PMRL channel.
    </p>
    <p num="35">
      The above description of a typical magnetic disk storage system, and the accompanying illustration of FIG. 4 are for representation purposes only.
      <br/>
      It should be apparent that disk storage systems may contain a large number of disks and actuators, and each actuator may support a number of sliders.
    </p>
    <p num="36">
      FIG. 5 shows a cross-sectional schematic view of the read/write head 500 embodying the present invention which includes an MTJ read head portion and an inductive write head portion.
      <br/>
      The head 500 is lapped to form an ABS.
      <br/>
      The read head includes an MTJ sensor 540 disposed between first and second shield layers S1 and S2.
      <br/>
      An insulating gap layer G1 is disposed between the first and second shield layers S1 and S2 in the region away from the MTJ sensor.
      <br/>
      The write head includes a coil layer C and an insulation layer IN2 which are disposed between insulation layers IN1 and IN3 which are, in turn, disposed between first and second pole pieces P1 and P2.
      <br/>

      Referring now to FIG. 10, there is shown an air bearing surface (ABS) view, not to scale, of an MTJ sensor 1000 of an alternative embodiment to the present invention.
      <br/>
      MTJ sensor 1000 is substantially the same a MTJ sensor 600 described above except that MTJ sensor 1000 includes a first MTJ stack 1002 formed in the central region 662 having a laminated antiparallel (AP) pinned layer 1013.
      <br/>
      The laminated AP-pinned layer 1013 comprises a first ferromagnetic sublayer (FM1) 1018 of Ni--Fe having a thickness in the range of 20-50  Angstrom , a second ferromagnetic sublayer (FM2) 1014 of Ni--Fe having a thickness in the range of 20-50  Angstrom , and an antiparallel coupling (APC) layer 1016 disposed between the FM1 sublayer 1018 and the FM2 sublayer 1014.
      <br/>
      The APC layer 1016 is formed of a non-magnetic material, preferably ruthenium (Ru), that allows the FM1 sublayer 1018 and the FM2 sublayer 1014 to be strongly coupled together antiferromagnetically.
      <br/>
      The FM2 sublayer 1014 is formed on the first antiferromagnet (AFM1) layer 612.
      <br/>
      The AFM1 layer 612 is exchange coupled to the FM2 sublayer 1014 providing an exchange field to pin the magnetization direction of the FM2 sublayer 1014 perpendicular to the ABS.
      <br/>
      The first tunnel barrier layer 620 is formed on the FM1 sublayer 1018.
    </p>
    <p num="72">
      A novel feature of the MTJ sensor 1000 of the alternative embodiment of the invention using the laminated AP-pinned layer 1013 is that the initialization process needed to fix the magnetization directions of the pinned layers of the first MTJ stack 1002 and the second MTJ stack 604 antiparallel with respect to each other is simplified.
      <br/>
      The initialization process for MTJ sensor 1000 comprises a step in which the magnetization directions of both AFM1612 and AFM2630 are set in the same direction by heating and then cooling the entire MTJ sensor 1000 above the blocking temperatures of both the AFM1 and the AFM2 materials with a 5000 Oe field applied in the desired direction.
      <br/>
      After the initialization process, the FM2 sublayer 1014 and the second pinned layer 628 will have their magnetization directions 1015 and 629, respectively, oriented perpendicular to the ABS and parallel to one another.
      <br/>
      Because of the APC layer 1016, the magnetization direction 1019 of the FM1 sublayer 1018 will be oriented perpendicular to the ABS and antiparallel to the magnetization direction 1015 of the FM2 sublayer 1014 and perpendicular to the magnetization direction 629 of the second pinned layer 628.
      <br/>
      With the magnetizations of the FM1 sublayer 1018 and the second pinned layer 628 fixed perpendicular to the ABS and antiparallel with respect to each other as shown by arrows 1019 and 629 (head and tail of arrows pointing out of and into the plane of the paper, respectively), respectively, the magnetoresistive signal generated due to an external field from the disk by the first MTJ stack 1002 will differ in phase by 180 (degree)  with respect to the magnetoresistive signal generated due to the same external field by the second MTJ stack 604.
    </p>
    <p num="73">
      In the MTJ sensor 1000 of the alternative embodiment of the present invention, because both the AFML layer 612 and the AFM2 layer 630 are initialized by a single heating step, the blocking temperature of the AFM1 material is no longer required to be lower than the blocking temperature of of the AFM2 material.
      <br/>
      Therefore, in the alternate embodiment both the AFM1 layer 612 and the AFM2 layer 630 may be chosen from a group of materials consisting of Mn--Fe, Ni--Mn, Ir--Mn, Pt--Mn and Pt--Pd--Mn.
    </p>
    <p num="74">In the alternative embodiment of the present invention, MTJ sensor 600 in FIG. 7 is replaced by the alternative MTJ sensor 1000 to provide for thermal asperity detection and reduction utilizing the thermal asperity reduction circuitry 700.</p>
