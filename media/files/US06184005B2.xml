    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="3">
      U.S. Pat. No. 5,280,040 discloses a class of 3,4-diarylchromans and their salts useful in the treatment of bone loss.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, PCT/DK96/00014 discloses that these compounds are useful in the treatment of hyperlipoproteinaemia, hypertriglyceridaemia, hyperlipidaemia, or hypercholesterolaemia or arteriosclerosis or for anticoagulative treatment.
      <br/>
      PCT/DK96/00015 discloses that these compounds are useful in the treatment of gynaecological disorders, such as endometriosis, dysfunctional bleedings, endometrial cancer, polycystic ovarian syndrome and anovulatoric bleeding and for the induction of endometrial thinning.
      <br/>
      The compounds are also known to have useful effects on gynaecomastia, obesity, vasodilation (respectively from PCT/DK96/00012, PCT/DK96/00011, and PCT/DK96/00013) and furthermore on e.g. Alzheimers disease (PCT/DK96/00010).
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      A process for the preparation of (+,-)-3,4-trans diarylchromanes is described in U.S. Pat. No. 3,822,287 and by Suprabhat Ray et al. in J.Med.Chem.19,276 (1976).
      <br/>
      The (+,-)-3,4-trans-isomer is obtained by conversion of the (+,-)-3,4-cis-isomer by means of an organometallic base-catalyzed rearrangement as described in U.S. Pat. No. 3,822,287.
    </p>
    <p num="5">The resolvation of (+,-)-3,4-trans-7-methoxy-2,2-dimethyl-3-phenyl-4-+4-�2-(pyrrolidin-1-yl)ethoxy�phenyl}chromane in its optical antipodes is described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,447,622. According to this process the (+,-)-3,4-trans-7-methoxy-2,2-dimethyl-3-phenyl-4-+4-�2-(pyrrolidin-1-yl)ethoxy�phenyl}chromane is reacted with di-p-toluoyl-l-tartaric acid monohydrate in a protic solvent, the reaction mixture is subjected to fractional crystallization and the crystalline salt is subjected to alkaline hydrolysis to produce the desired enantiomer.</p>
    <p num="6">Example 1 of U.S. Pat. No. 4,447,622 describes the preparation of the (-)-3,4-trans enantiomer, shown by the following formula:  (Chemical Structure image '1' not included in text)</p>
    <p num="7">
      When using the process disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,447,622 the desired (-)-3,4-trans enantiomer is only obtained with a low chiral purity, less than 80% ee (enantiomeric excess) after the first crystallization.
      <br/>
      In order to improve the chiral purity the enantiomer has to be crystallized several times.
    </p>
    <p num="8">One object of the present invention is therefore to provide a new process involving an enzymatic resolution step for the preparation of (-)-3,4-trans enantiomers of compounds of formula I which process is adaptable to large scale manufacture, provide good yields and high purity and reduce the cost of manufacture.</p>

      The mixture was heated to reflux while water was distilled from the mixture.
      <br/>
      The reflux was maintained for 6 hours.
      <br/>
      The reaction mixture was cooled down to room temperature, water (200 ml) was added and the mixture stirred until all the salt was dissolved.
      <br/>
      The aqueous phase was separated and extracted with another portion of toluene (135 ml).
      <br/>
      The organic phases were pooled washed with water (2 * 200 ml) and evaporated to an oil.
      <br/>
      The oil was dissolved in ethanol (135 ml) at 40 (degree)  C. and mixed with a solution of fumaric acid (9.1 g) in ethanol (265 ml) at 40-60 (degree)  C. The mixture was stirred for 2 hours at ambient temperature and then for 1 hour at 0 (degree)  C. The crystals were filtered off and dried.
