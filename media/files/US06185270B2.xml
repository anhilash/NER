      In a connection part of vertical transfer registers with respect to a horizontal transfer register, transfer electrodes to which clocks phiV1, phiV2A, phiV3A, phiV2B, phiV3B, and phiV1A are applied are arranged in the cited order.

      By activating clocks, signal charges of a channel denoted by A-A' and channels equivalent thereto are first transferred to undersides of electrodes of phiH1A of the horizontal transfer register.
      <br/>
      The signal charges are transferred in the rightward direction to underside of electrodes of phiH1B.
      <br/>
      Subsequently, signal charges of a channel denoted by B-B' and channels equivalent thereto are transferred to undersides of electrodes of phiH1B of the horizontal transfer register, and mixed with the signal charges previously transferred.
      <br/>

      The present invention relates to a solid state imaging device of all pixel simultaneous read type in which signal charges of unit pixels are read out into a vertical transfer register simultaneously and independently, and relates to a method for driving such a solid state imaging device.

    <p num="4">
      In recent years, it has been demanded to make it possible to display moving pictures on a monitor of a personal computer as well.
      <br/>
      In the current processing capability, however, it is difficult to display moving pictures on personal computers with a resolution close to that of television sets.
      <br/>
      For displaying image data taken in from, for example, a CCD camera, it is necessary to reduce frames and lower the frame rate, or maintain the frame rate and reduce image data.
      <br/>
      In the case where the frame rate has been lowered, however, smooth motions cannot be represented.
      <br/>
      Typically, therefore, pixels are reduced, i.e., the resolution is lowered.
      <br/>
      As for the conventional image change-over method, there was a method of simultaneously reading signal charges of all photodiodes and then reducing in a solid state imaging device, and a method of coping with it by using software processing on the personal computer.
      <br/>
      Prior to describing the conventional image change-over method, the conventional solid state imaging device will first be described.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      FIG. 1 is a schematic top view showing the entire configuration of a conventional solid state imaging device of all pixel readout type.
      <br/>
      As shown in FIG. 1, the conventional solid state imaging device is formed by photodiodes 1 arranged in a matrix form to convert light to signal charges, optical black level regions 2 for forming a reference level of image signals, a vertical surplus charge sweeping out drain 3 and a horizontal surplus charge sweeping out drain 4 for sweeping away the surplus charge, vertical transfer registers 5 for reading out and transferring signal charges stored in the photodiodes 1, and a horizontal transfer register 6 for receiving the signal charges transferred through a vertical transfer register 5 and transferring the signal charges to an output amplifier 7.
      <br/>
      On the photodiodes 1, RGB filters are arranged by using, for example, the Bayer method.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      FIGS. 2 and 3 are diagrams showing an electrode configuration of a connection part between the vertical transfer registers 5 and the horizontal transfer register 6 shown in FIG. 1.
      <br/>
      FIG. 2 is a top view.
      <br/>
      FIG. 3 is a sectional view along a line A-A' of FIG. 2.
      <br/>
      The vertical transfer registers 5 are driven by 4-phase clocks  PHI V1,  PHI V2,  PHI V3, and  PHI V4.
      <br/>
      Transfer electrodes to which the clock  PHI V1 is applied are formed by first polysilicon layer.
      <br/>
      Transfer electrodes to which the clocks  PHI V2 and  PHI V4 are applied are formed by second polysilicon layer.
      <br/>
      Transfer electrodes to which the clock  PHI V3 is applied are formed by third polysilicon layer.
      <br/>
      Transfer electrodes of a final stage to which  PHI V1 is applied form gates for the horizontal transfer register 6.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      The horizontal transfer register 6 is driven by 2-phase clocks  PHI H1 and  PHI H2.
      <br/>
      Each of all transfer electrodes of the horizontal transfer register 6 is formed by the second polysilicon layer and the third polysilicon layer.
      <br/>
      An electrode portion of the second polysilicon layer forms a storage portion, and an electrode portion of the third polysilicon layer forms a barrier portion.
      <br/>
      The signal charge of a vertical transfer register is transferred to the horizontal transfer register in such a state that the clock  PHI H1 of the horizontal transfer register is kept at its high level.
      <br/>
      In other words, if  PHI V1 turns the high level in such a state that  PHI H1 is kept at its high level, then transfer of the signal charge to undersides of the transfer electrodes to which  PHI H1 has been applied is started.
      <br/>
      When  PHI V1 has become its low level, the transfer is completed.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      Operation of the conventional solid state imaging device in the connection part between the vertical transfer registers 5 and the horizontal transfer register 6 will now be described by referring to FIGS. 4 to 6.
      <br/>
      FIG. 4 shows the pulse timing of the 4-phase clocks  PHI V1,  PHI V2,  PHI V3, and  PHI V4 applied to the transfer electrodes of the vertical transfer registers 5 and the 2-phase clocks  PHI H1 and  PHI H2 applied to the transfer electrodes of the horizontal transfer register 6.
      <br/>
      FIG. 5 shows how signal charge in a vertical transfer register 5 is transferred to the horizontal transfer register 6.
      <br/>
      FIG. 6 shows how signal charge in the horizontal transfer register 6 is transferred.
      <br/>
      Signal charges stored under the transfer electrodes to which  PHI V3 and  PHI V4 have been applied during t0 begin to be transferred to the undersides of transfer electrodes to which  PHI H1 is applied, when  PHI V1 becomes its high level during t1.
      <br/>
      If  PHI V3,  PHI V4, and  PHI V1 are changed to the low level in the cited order, signal charges are transferred to the undersides of the electrodes for  PHI H1.
      <br/>
      The signal charges stored under the electrodes for  PHI H1 are successively transferred in the horizontal transfer register by repetition of alternate high/low levels of  PHI H1 and  PHI H2.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      At this time, signals R1, G1, R2, G2, R3, G3, R4 and G4 according to the RGB Bayer arrangement are transferred without destroying the order as shown in FIG. 6.
      <br/>
      An output waveform of an output amplifier 7 is shown in FIG. 7.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      For implementing moving pictures with smooth motions on a personal computer monitor, it is necessary to reduce pixels and lower the image resolution as described above.
      <br/>
      As for methods for lowering the resolution, there are a method of temporarily recording image data in an external memory, then rearranging data so that filter pixels of the same color will adjoin each other, and treating adjoining data of the same color as one pixel, and a method of reducing one of adjoining data of the same color.
    </p>
    <p num="11">
      Means for lowering the resolution in the device itself will now be described.
      <br/>
      For example, in the case where the horizontal resolution is to be reduced to 1/2, there is used a method of, for example, leaving the center of the image and sweeping away half of the image located on the left and right sides as shown in FIG. 8.
      <br/>
      Every horizontal line, in this method, a first 1/4 portion is transferred at a speed twice the normal speed as a sweeping away region 9, and the data are passed through the output amplifier and then thrown away.
      <br/>
      The next central 1/2 portion is transferred at the normal speed as an effective region 8, and image data are obtained.
      <br/>
      A final 1/4 portion is transferred at a high speed in the same way as the first 1/4 portion and then thrown away.
    </p>
    <p num="12">
      In the above described conventional method of lowering the resolution of the horizontal direction by software means, it is necessary to record images temporarily in the external memory and then rearrange data at high speed.
      <br/>
      In the case where the processing speed of the apparatus cannot cope with this, therefore, the frame rate cannot be maintained consequently, resulting in a drawback.
    </p>
    <p num="13">
      Furthermore, in the case where the resolution is lowered in the device itself, it is necessary to transfer the 1/2 image data to be swept away, with high speed drive.
      <br/>
      Therefore, excessive performance is required of the device, resulting in a lowered yield.
      <br/>
      In addition, the power dissipation of the drive circuit becomes large.
      <br/>
      This results in a drawback of degraded performance when viewed as the apparatus.
    </p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="14">An object of the present invention is to provide a solid state imaging device capable of lowering the resolution within a device without requiring high speed drive.</p>
    <p num="15">In order to solve the above described problems, the present invention provides a solid state imaging device including a plurality of photodiodes arranged in a matrix form, first kind of vertical transfer registers and second kind of vertical transfer registers disposed alternately so as to be adjacent to the plurality of photodiodes, and a horizontal transfer register for transferring signal charges transferred from the vertical transfer registers to an output amplifier, wherein in a connection part of the vertical transfer registers with respect to the horizontal transfer register, facing the horizontal transfer register, a first transfer electrode of first layer, a first transfer electrode of second layer, a first transfer electrode of third layer, a second transfer electrode of second layer, a second transfer electrode of third layer, and a second transfer electrode of first layer are disposed nearly in the cited order, and wherein the first transfer electrode of second layer and the first transfer electrode of third layer are disposed, in the first kind of vertical transfer registers, on transfer electrodes of layers lower than itself, and the second transfer electrode of second layer and the second transfer electrode of third layer are disposed, in the second kind of vertical transfer registers, on transfer electrodes of layers lower than itself.</p>
    <p num="16">
      Furthermore, the present invention provides a method for driving a solid state imaging device including a plurality of photodiodes arranged in a matrix form, first kind of vertical transfer registers and second kind of vertical transfer registers disposed so as to be adjacent to the plurality of photodiodes, and a horizontal transfer register for transferring signal charges transferred from the vertical transfer registers to an output amplifier.
      <br/>
      Said method including the step of transferring the signal charges of the vertical transfer registers to the horizontal transfer register.
      <br/>
      Said step of transferring the signal charges has steps of transferring the signal charges of the first kind of vertical transfer registers to the horizontal transfer register in such a state as to pin the signal charges of the second kind of vertical transfer registers; and thereafter transferring only the signal charges of the second kind of vertical transfer registers to the horizontal transfer register.
    </p>
    <p num="17">
      In the present invention as heretofore described, in the connection part of the vertical transfer registers with respect to the horizontal transfer register, other signal charges are previously transferred to the horizontal transfer register while a part of signal charges is being pinned, and thereafter remaining signal charges are transferred to the horizontal transfer register.
      <br/>
      In the horizontal transfer register, therefore, a part of signal charges may be added other signal charges or may be swept out.
      <br/>
      In the present invention, therefore, it becomes possible to decrease the number of pixels in the horizontal direction.
      <br/>
      Without requiring high speed driving, it becomes possible in the solid state imaging device to lower the resolution.
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      In an embodiment in which the signal charges are added in the horizontal transfer register, the signal charge is increased to at least twice after the resolution change-over has been conducted.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the sensitivity and saturation output can be significantly improved.
      <br/>
      If an electronic shutter is used together, however, a resolution change-over can be conducted without changing the sensitivity and dynamic range.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, in an embodiment using a horizontal overflow drain gate, a resolution change-over can be conducted without changing the sensitivity.

    <heading>DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
    <p num="20">Hereafter, preferred embodiments of the present invention will be described by referring to accompanying drawing.</p>
    <p num="21">
      FIG. 9 is a top view showing an electrode configuration of a connection part between vertical transfer registers and a horizontal transfer register in a solid state imaging device of a first embodiment according to the present invention.
      <br/>
      FIGS. 10A and 10B are sectional views seen along a line A-A' and a line B-B' of FIG. 9, respectively.
      <br/>
      In the connection part of vertical transfer registers 5 with respect to the horizontal transfer register, transfer electrodes to which clocks  PHI V1,  PHI V2A,  PHI V3A,  PHI V2B,  PHI V3B, and  PHI V1A are applied are arranged in the cited order.
      <br/>
      Final transfer electrodes to which  PHI V1A is applied form gates for the horizontal transfer register 6.
      <br/>
      On the upstream side of the portion of the vertical transfer registers 5 illustrated in FIG. 9, transfer electrodes to which the clocks  PHI V1,  PHI V2,  PHI V3, and  PHI V4 are applied are arranged repetitively in the cited order in the same way as the conventional device shown in FIG. 2.
    </p>
    <p num="22">
      In the horizontal transfer register 6, transfer is conducted by 3-phase clocks, i.e.,  PHI H1A,  PHI H1B, and  PHI H2.
      <br/>
      Except the former half portion in which charge transfer from the vertical transfer registers to the horizontal transfer register,  PHI H1A and  PHI H1B have pulses of the same phase.
      <br/>
      When  PHI V1A and  PHI H1A are high and  PHI H1B and  PHI H2 are low, the horizontal transfer register 6 receives the signal charge on the undersides of the transfer electrodes to which .O slashed.H1A is applied.
      <br/>
      When  PHI V1A and  PHI H1B are high and  PHI H1B and  PHI H2 are low, the horizontal transfer register 6 receives the signal charge on the undersides of the transfer electrodes to which  PHI H1B is applied.
      <br/>
      At this time,  PHI H1A may be either high or low.
    </p>
    <p num="23">
      As shown in FIGS. 10A and 10B, transfer electrodes to which  PHI V1 and  PHI V1A are applied are formed by first polysilicon layer.

      Transfer electrodes to which  PHI V2A and  PHI V2B are applied are formed by second polysilicon layer.
      <br/>
      Transfer electrodes to which  PHI V3A and  PHI V3B are applied are formed by third polysilicon layer.
    </p>
    <p num="24">
      Each of all transfer electrodes of the horizontal transfer register 6 is formed by polysilicon of the second layer and the third layer.
      <br/>
      An electrode portion of the second polysilicon layer forms a storage portion, and an electrode portion of the third polysilicon layer forms a barrier portion.
      <br/>
      The configuration itself of the transfer electrodes in the horizontal transfer register 6 is not different from that of the conventional device.
    </p>
    <p num="25">
      Operation of the solid state imaging device according to the present invention in the connection part between the vertical transfer registers 5 and the horizontal transfer register 6 will now be described by referring to FIGS. 11 to 13. Hereafter, two channels located on the side extending along a line A-A' of FIG. 9 are referred to as A channels, and two channels located on the side extending along a line B-B' are referred to as B channels.
      <br/>
      FIG. 11 shows pulse timing of clocks  PHI V1,  PHI V2A,  PHI V3A,  PHI V2B,  PHI V3B, and  PHI V1A applied to the transfer electrodes of the vertical transfer registers 5, and pulse timing of clocks  PHI H1A,  PHI H1B, and  PHI H2 applied to the transfer electrodes of the horizontal transfer register 6.
      <br/>
      FIG. 12 shows how signal charge in a vertical transfer register 5 is transferred to the horizontal transfer register 6.
      <br/>
      FIG. 13 shows how signal charge in the horizontal transfer register 6 is transferred.

    <p num="26">
      Immediately before t0 finishes, signal charges transferred through the vertical transfer registers 5 are stored under the transfer electrodes of  PHI V1,  PHI V2A,  PHI V3A,  PHI V2B, and  PHI V3B.
      <br/>
      When  PHI V1 turns low during t1, the signal charges stored under the transfer electrodes of  PHI V1 are transferred to undersides of the transfer electrodes of  PHI V2A,  PHI V3A,  PHI V2B, and  PHI V3B.
      <br/>
      In the A channels, the signal charges are stored under the transfer electrodes of  PHI V2B and  PHI V3B at this time.
      <br/>
      In B channels, the signal charges are stored under the transfer electrodes of  PHI V2A and  PHI V3A at this time.
      <br/>
      Here, signal charges stored under the transfer electrodes of  PHI V2B and  PHI V3B in the two A channels are referred to as R1 and G1.
      <br/>
      Signal charges stored under the transfer electrodes of  PHI V2A and  PHI V3A in the two B channels are referred to as R2 and G2 (see FIG. 13).
      <br/>
      During t2, the clock  PHI V1A turns high.
      <br/>
      Subsequently,  PHI V2B turns low.

      Since  PHI H1A is at its high level and  PHI H2 is at its low level, signal charges R1 and G1 stored under the transfer electrodes of  PHI V2B and  PHI V3B in the A channels begin to be transferred to undersides of the transfer electrodes of  PHI H1A.
      <br/>
      During t3,  PHI V3B turns low.
      <br/>
      Subsequently, during t4,  PHI V1A turns low.
      <br/>
      As a result, the signal charges R1 and G1 in the A channels are completely transferred to the underside of the electrodes of  PHI H1A.
      <br/>
      The signal charges R1 and G1 thus stored under the transfer electrodes of  PHI H1A are transferred within the horizontal transfer register during t5, t6 and t7.
      <br/>
      During t8, respective signal charges arrive at the undersides of the transfer electrodes of  PHI H1B (see FIG. 13).
    </p>
    <p num="27">
      On the other hand,  PHI V3A and  PHI V3B are kept at high levels in the B channels during the interval from t1 to t8.
      <br/>
      As a result, the signal charges R2 and G2 continue to be held under the transfer electrodes of the clocks  PHI V3A and  PHI V3B.
      <br/>
      During t9,  PHI V1A turns high again.
      <br/>
      When  PHI V2A turns low,  PHI H1B is at its high level and  PHI H2 is at its low level.
      <br/>
      As a result, signal charges R2 and G2 stored under the transfer electrodes of  PHI V2A and  PHI V3A begin to be transferred to undersides of the transfer electrodes of  PHI H1B.
      <br/>
      The clock  PHI V3A turns low during tlO and  PHI V1A turns low during t11.
      <br/>
      As a result, the signal charges are completely transferred to the undersides of the transfer electrodes of  PHI H1B.
      <br/>
      At this time, there are the signal charges R1 and G1 already stored under the transfer electrodes of  PHI H1B.
      <br/>
      By this operation, therefore, added signals R1+R2 and G1+G2 are formed under these transfer electrodes.
      <br/>
      In this case, a signal waveform as shown in FIG. 14 is output from the output amplifier.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the number of pixels in the horizontal direction is converted to 1/2.
      <br/>
      As a result, the horizontal resolution is lowered to 1/2.
    </p>
    <p num="28">
      In the above described first embodiment, the pulse amplitude of the clock  PHI V1A is the same as that of other clock.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, the amplitude of  PHI V1A may be made equal to 1/2 of the amplitude of other clocks, and the signal charges may be transferred to the horizontal transfer register via the undersides of the transfer electrodes of  PHI V1A only when  PHI V3B or  PHI V3A turns low.
      <br/>
      In such a case, the clocks  PHI H1A and  PHI H1B can be made pulses of the same phase, and the horizontal transfer register can be made complete 2-phase clock transfer type.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, instead of applying the clock  PHI V1A, a voltage of an intermediate potential may be always applied to the final transfer electrodes of the vertical transfer registers to which the clock  PHI V1A has been applied.

    <p num="29">
      FIG. 15 is a top view showing an electrode configuration of a connection part between vertical transfer registers and a horizontal transfer register in a solid state imaging device of a second embodiment according to the present invention.
      <br/>
      FIGS. 16A and 16B are sectional views seen along a line A-A' and a line B-B' of FIG. 15, respectively.
      <br/>
      In the present embodiment, the vertical transfer registers and the horizontal transfer register themselves in the connection part have a configuration similar to that of the preceding embodiment shown in FIGS. 9, 10A and 10B.
      <br/>
      The present embodiment differs from the preceding embodiment in that an overflow drain gate (hereafter abbreviated to HOFD) is provided in a portion of the horizontal transfer register 6 illustrated in a lower part thereof in FIG. 15. By activating the overflow drain gate, the signal charges in the horizontal transfer register can be transferred to a horizontal surplus charge sweeping out drain 4 provided so as to be adjacent to the horizontal transfer register 6.
    </p>
    <p num="30">Operation of the solid state imaging device of the second embodiment will now be described by referring to FIGS. 17 to 19.</p>
    <p num="31">
      Operation of t0 to t4 is the same as that of the first embodiment.
      <br/>
      In t5 and t6, the HOFD gate is in the on-state.
      <br/>
      As a result, the signal charges R1 and G1 stored under the transfer electrodes of  PHI H1A are swept out and thrown away to the horizontal surplus charge sweeping out drain 4.
      <br/>
      During t8,  PHI H1B turns high.
      <br/>
      During t9,  PHI V1A turns high.
      <br/>
      Subsequently,  PHI V2A turns low.
      <br/>
      Since  PHI H2 is at its low level, the signal charges R2 and G2 stored under the transfer electrodes of  PHI V2A and  PHI V3A begin to be transferred to the undersides of the transfer electrodes of  PHI H1B.
      <br/>
      During t10,  PHI V3A turns low.
      <br/>
      Subsequently, during t11,  PHI V1A turns low.
      <br/>
      As a result, the signal charges are completely transferred to the undersides of the transfer electrodes of  PHI H1B.
      <br/>
      In this way, R1 and G1 among four consecutive pixel signals R1, G1, R2 and G2 are swept and thrown away.
      <br/>
      Under the transfer electrodes of  PHI H1B, only R2 and G2 are stored.
    </p>
    <p num="32">
      In this case, a signal waveform as shown in FIG. 20 is output from the output amplifier.
      <br/>
      In other words, the number of pixels in the horizontal direction is converted to 1/2.
      <br/>
      Without driving the horizontal transfer register at high speed, therefore, the horizontal resolution can be lowered to 1/2.
    </p>
    <p num="33">
      The embodiments have been described assuming that the color filter is arranged in the Bayer form.
      <br/>
      However, the present invention is not restricted to this arrangement, but a color filter having an arbitrary arrangement can be adopted.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, in the embodiments heretofore described, two pixels among four pixels consecutive in the horizontal direction are transferred to the horizontal transfer register in advance.
      <br/>
      In the present invention, however, these numbers of pixels are not limited to the above described values, but are suitably determined according to the whether a color filter is present or not, the configuration of the color filter, and desired degree of lowering in resolution.
