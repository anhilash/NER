    <p num="11">
      Medicines that suppress vascular permeability itself or medicines that prevent the pathological condition that can occur as the result of increased vascular permeability, for example serious symptoms due to retention of carcinomatous ascites or pleural effusion, have not yet been known.
      <br/>
      Therefore, patients with increased retention of carcinomatous ascites or pleural effusion are inevitably treated only with passive means such as removal of ascites or pleural effusion with a syringe, etc., and thus vascular permeability suppressants serving as agents which actively suppress ascites retention or pleural effusion itself have been desired.
      <br/>
      The present inventors discovered in the result of their researches that oxaspirooctane derivatives (I) have an excellent suppressing effect on vascular permeability and that they also prevent retention of carcinomatous ascites or carcinomatous pleural effusion based on the said effect.
      <br/>
      Thus the inventors completed the present invention after extensive researches.

      The total amount of retained pleural effusion (including the cells) was 0.7 ml in the placebo preparation treated group and 0.1 ml in the group treated with the preparation of this invention, demonstrating the significant pleural effusion retention-suppressing effect of the preparation of this invention.
      <br/>
      The amount of pleural effusion after removal of the cells in the thoracic cavity was 0.5 ml in the placebo group and 0.1 ml in the group treated with the preparation of this invention, demonstrating again the significant pleural effusion retention-suppressing effect of the preparation of this invention.

    <p num="78">(2) Formulation</p>
    <p num="79">
      For the preparation of this invention, was used the solution of 105 mg of the test compound in 6.0 ml of physiological saline containing 10% polyoxyethylene hydrogenated castor oil (HCO-60).
      <br/>
      For the placebo preparation, was used the above-mentioned physiological saline containing only 10% polyoxyethylene hydrogenated castor oil.

    <p num="80">(3) Preparation of Tumor Cells and of Tumor Cell-derived Vascular Permeability Promoter</p>
    <p num="81">
      Tumor cells used were Meth A fibrosarcoma (mouse fibrosarcoma) prepared by subculture under the same conditions as for Test Example 1, and implanted in mice.
      <br/>
      From mice 6 days after implantation, ascites was obtained, and the supernatant of the ascites after removal of tumor cells (2000 rpm, 10 min.) was used as the tumor cells-derived vascular permeability promoter.
    </p>
    <p num="82">(4) Administration Schedule</p>
    <p num="83">
      Hartley strain guinea pigs were divided into 2 groups (4 animals per group), and the preparation of this invention was administered subcutaneously in one group (dose: 32 mg/kg).
      <br/>
      In the other group, the placebo preparation of the same volume was administered subcutaneously.
      <br/>
      One hour after administration, 1 ml of the solution of Evans blue in physiological saline (10 mg/ml) was injected intravenously, followed by immediate subcutaneous administration of 0.1 ml of the ascites supernatant.
      <br/>
      Thirty minutes later the skin of each guinea pig with leakage of Evans blue was sampled, and soaked in 1 ml of 0.1N-KOH overnight to be solubilized.
      <br/>
      After solubilization, 4 ml of acetone-2.5N phosphoric acid mixture (17:3) was added to extract Evans blue, and OD620 of the extract was determined.
    </p>
    <p num="84">(5) Test Results</p>
    <p num="85">
      The results of determination of OD620 of the extract are shown in Table 6.

      The OD620 value in the placebo group was 0.117 whereas the value was 0.082 in the group treated with the preparation of this invention, clearly showing that the leakage of Evans blue through the vessels was significantly decreased after administration of the preparation of this invention.
      <br/>
      That is, it was demonstrated that the preparation of this invention can significantly suppress the vascular permeability-promoting effect ascribable to the tumor cells-derived vascular permeability promoter.
