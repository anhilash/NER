    <p num="1">This application is hereby claims priority to, and incorporates herein by reference, provisional Application No. 60/038,108, Low-Cost High Performance No-Flow Underfills For Flip Chip Device Applications filed Feb. 19, 1997, and provisional Application No. 60/069,179, filed Dec. 11, 1997, entitled "Low-Cost High-Performance No-Flow Underfills For Flip Chip Device Applications."</p>
    <heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">
      This present invention is concerned with epoxy materials which can be simultaneously cured during solder bump reflow in applying flip-chip technology.
      <br/>
      After being cured, the epoxy material has relatively high glass transition temperature as well as excellent electrical and mechanical properties.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the present invention provides a new inexpensive polymeric material suitable for no-flow underfilling processes in current industrial production of solder interconnected structures for jointing semiconductor devices to substrates.
      <br/>
      The underfill material can significantly improve the fatigue life of the interconnected structures.
    </p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="3">
      Semiconductor devices are widely used in many products.
      <br/>
      An important trend of developing semiconductor device is the miniaturization of the products using high density semiconductor devices.
      <br/>
      However, competing with this need for smaller dimensions is the increasing need for functionality that the consumers of semiconductor devices demand.
      <br/>
      The increase in functionality tends to increase the size and complexity of the semiconductor devices and the number of semiconductor devices per module.
      <br/>
      This trend consequently results in area distributed I/O terminals and corresponding C4 area bonding technique.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      Another significant factor is maintaining low cost of manufacturing despite the increase in semiconductor device complexity and density.
      <br/>
      One significant cost in manufacturing a semiconductor device is the lead frame.
      <br/>
      As a result, direct chip attach (DCA) type assemblies are gaining popularity.
      <br/>
      In DCA, the pads of a semiconductor device are directly attached to a substrate, such as PCB.
      <br/>
      Thus the cost and size of an individual package for the semiconductor device is reduced.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      While C4 (controlled collapse chip connection) and DCA techniques becomes popular, the problem with thermal coefficient of expansion (TCE) mismatch between chip and substrate carrier becomes serious in particular with the larger integrated circuit (IC) chips, high TCE, low-cost organic substrate, and smaller solder joints.
      <br/>
      Due to the TCE mismatch between the silicon IC (2.5 ppm) and low cost organic substrate, in particularly, the FR-4 (18-24 ppm) printed wiring board, the temperature cycling excursions generate thermomechanical stresses to the solder joints and result in performance degradation of packaged systems.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      Underfill encapsulant is used to reinforce physical, mechanical and electrical properties of the solder joints connecting the chip and the substrate.
      <br/>
      The encapsulant does not only provide dramatic fatigue life enhancement, but also extends its use to a variety of organic and inorganic substrate materials, resulting in ten to hundred fold improvement in fatigue life as compared to an unencapsulated package.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the new technique of underfill encapsulation has been gaining increasing acceptance.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      However, more than 90% of current underfill encapsulants dispense liquid encapsulants on one or two edges of an assembled flip-chip package.
      <br/>
      This allows capillary action to draw the underfill into the gap between the chip and substrate of the assembled package to complete the encapsulation process.
      <br/>
      This process has two disadvantages: (1) The process of reflowing solder bump and the process of underfilling and curing the encapsulants are separated, which result in lower production efficiency. (2) The limit of capillary force results in the limit of flow distance for underfill materials, which further limits the chip size.
      <br/>
      As such it becomes a production bottleneck.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      A no-flow underfilling process was invented to dispense the underfill materials on the substrate or the semiconductor devices at first, then perform the solder bump reflowing and underfill encapsulant curing simultaneously.
      <br/>
      Therefore, no-flow underfilling process not only eliminates the strict limits on the viscosity of underfill materials and package size, but also improves the production efficiency.
      <br/>
      Pennisi et al, in one of their patents �U.S. Pat. No. 5,128,746�, described the similar process as the no-flow underfilling process and herein cited as a reference.
      <br/>
      Till now, however, no-flow underfilling process has not been practically used in industrial mass production.
      <br/>
      The reason mainly lies in lacking of a successful no-flow underfill material.
    </p>
    <p num="9">A successful no-flow underfill encapsulant should meet primary requirements: (1) minimal curing reaction should occur at the temperature below solder bump reflow temperature (.about.190-230 (degree)  C.). (2) rapid curing reaction should take place after the maximum solder bump reflow temperature. (3) good adhesion to passivation layer, chip, substrate, solder mask, and solder joints. (4) reasonable shrinkage of the material during curing. (5) low TCE. (6) self-fluxing ability. (7) exhibit a reasonable modulus to minimize the residual thermal stress resulted from the curing process and sequence temperature cycling condition.</p>
    <p num="10">
      Silica filled epoxy resins were most widely investigated candidates due to their low cost and good integrated properties.
      <br/>
      There are many kinds of epoxy resins in current market, and the formulations based on these epoxy resins and protected by patents are enormous.
      <br/>
      Most of these formulations are based on aromatic epoxy resin such as bisphenol A type epoxy resin and bisphenol F type epoxy resin, and the Tg of these formulations after curing generally ranges from 100 to 140 (degree)  C. Polynuclear aromatic epoxides are now under developing, especially in Japan, and the Tg of cured polynuclear aromatic epoxides generally ranges from 180 to 220 (degree)  C., which is close to the Tg of polyimide (250 (degree)  C.).
      <br/>
      Some research results of polynuclear aromatic epoxides were reported in "Polymeric Materials for Microelectronics Applications" edited by Hiroshi Ito, Seiichi Tagawa, and Kazuyuki Horie.
      <br/>
      However, most of polynuclear aromatic phenols are cancer suspending chemicals and the cost of producing them are relatively high.
      <br/>
      As such, they are not widely used in the industries.
      <br/>
      Cycloaliphatic epoxides has been commercialized many years ago and its market price is relatively inexpensive.
      <br/>
      Cycloaliphatic epoxide attracts increasing attentions due to its lacking of phenylene UV chromophore, low concentration of mobile chlorine ion, and low viscosity.
      <br/>
      Papathomas et al in one of their patents �U.S. Pat. No. 5,194,930� developed cycloaliphatic epoxide/anhydride system for solder interconnection structure application in flip-chip technology and herein cited as a reference.
      <br/>
      But they did not mention any catalyst, fluxing agents and viscosity controlling agents suitable for no-flow underfill formulations.
      <br/>
      Instead, they used glycol as curing accelerator with curing peak temperature around 160 (degree)  C. which is out of useful range for no-flow underfill applications.
      <br/>
      Pennisi et al, in one of their patents �U.S. Pat. No. 5,128,746� developed an epoxy based material for their processing, but they did not realize the importance of the viscosity controlling agents and silane coupling agents for no-flow underfilling process.
      <br/>
      Moreover, their material contains organic acid type fluxing agent, which is corrosive to the solder interconnects.
    </p>

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading>
    <p num="19">The present invention may be understood more readily by reference to the following detailed description of preferred embodiments of the invention.</p>
    <p num="20">
      The term "alkyl" as used herein refers to a branched or unbranched saturated hydrocarbon group of 1 to 24 carbon atoms, such as methyl ("Me"), ethyl ("Et"), n-propyl, isopropyl, n-butyl, isobutyl, t-butyl, octyl, decyl, and the like.
      <br/>
      Preferred alkyl groups herein contain from 1 to 12 carbon atoms.
    </p>
    <p num="21">
      By the term "effective amount" of a compound, product, or composition as provided herein is meant a sufficient amount of the compound, product or composition to provide the desired results.
      <br/>
      As will be pointed out below, the exact amount required will vary from substrate to substrate, depending on the particular compound, product or composition used, its mode of administration, and the like.
      <br/>
      Thus, it is not always possible to specify an exact "effective amount." However, an appropriate effective amount may be determined by one of ordinary skill in the art using only routine experimentation.
    </p>
    <p num="22">
      As used herein, the term "suitable" is used to refer to a moiety which is compatible with the compounds, products, or compositions as provided herein for the stated purpose.
      <br/>
      Suitability for the stated purpose may be determined by one of ordinary skill in the art using only routine experimentation.
    </p>
    <p num="23">
      As used herein, "substituted" is used to refer, generally, to a carbon or suitable heteroatom having a hydrogen or other atom removed and replaced with a further moiety.
      <br/>
      Moreover, it is intended that "substituted" refer to substitutions which do not change the basic and novel utility of the underlying compounds, products or compositions of the present invention.
    </p>
    <p num="24">
      Cycloaliphatic epoxy resins are particularly useful for electronic insulation and microelectronic encapsulation because they do not have aromatic rings and therefore, lack a strong UV chromophore.
      <br/>
      Consequently, they prove to be more durable for outdoor applications.
      <br/>
      Additionally, cycloaliphatic epoxy resins are manufactured by epoxidation of carbon-carbon double bond, not through condensation of epichlorohydrin with phenols.
      <br/>
      This eliminates the possible corrosion of fine wires or electrical interconnections in packaged IC devices by mobile chloride ions.
      <br/>
      Lastly, the viscosity of the cycloaliphatic epoxy resins is generally lower than that of other epoxy resins.
      <br/>
      This allows the preparation of epoxy based formulations with higher filler loading for TCE controll, such as in microelectronic encapsulation and underfill applications.
      <br/>
      Besides the cycloaliphatic epoxy resins, bisphenol-A type epoxy resins, bisphenol-F type epoxy resins, epoxy novolac resins, biphenyl type epoxy resins, naphthalene type epoxy resins and dicyclopentadienephenol type epoxy resins are also used in an underfill formulation.
      <br/>
      These epoxy resins are used to optimize the integrated properties of the cured formulation such as toughness, moisture absorption, elongation and etc.
    </p>
    <p num="25">
      Carboxylic acid anhydride is employed as an epoxy hardener in microelectronic application formulations because the electrical properties such as the dielectric constant, and glass transition temperature (Tg) of cured formulations using anhydride hardener are generally better than those using amine type hardeners.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, anhydride hardener is a type of high temperature curing hardener, which will not react with epoxy resins at room temperature unless catalyzed by other chemicals.
      <br/>
      So that the pot-life of the formulations using these hardeners will be relatively longer.
      <br/>
      However, these compounds can quickly cure the epoxy resins at reasonably elevated temperatures with the aid of catalysts.
    </p>
    <p num="26">
      No-flow underfilling process requires that the underfill material should provide such curing characteristics: that is, minimal curing takes place before solder reflow and rapid curing occurs just after the solder reflow.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the selection of the latent catalysts is critical for the underfill materials.
      <br/>
      These latent catalyst can be selected from the group of alkyl-substituted imidazole, triphenylphosphine, imidazolium salts, onium borate, metal chelates, and the mixture thereof.
    </p>
    <p num="27">
      Since no-flow underfilling process reflows the solder joint and cure the underfill materials at the same time, proper selection of fluxing agent is one of the key parameters in designing a successful no-flow underfill formulation.
      <br/>
      The employed fluxing agent must be able to remove the metal oxide from the copper conductor pads of the PWB and prevent the solder melt from reoxidation during the high temperature curing of a no-flow underfill formulation.
      <br/>
      At the same time, the fluxing agents should not cause noticeable negative effects on the curing profile and final properties of the no-flow underfill materials.
      <br/>
      Various organic acids are suitable as oxide removing agents and various alcohols are suitable as antioxidants (U.S. Pat. No. 5,376,403) which have very low vapor pressure at solder reflow temperature.
      <br/>
      However, since most of the organic acids interfere with the curing profile and cause corrosive to solder interconnects, they can not be used in the no-flow underfill materials.
      <br/>
      Therefore we found a new class of fluxing agents which is basically the chemicals containing one or more than one hydroxyl groups (--OH groups).
      <br/>
      The chemicals can provide excellent fluxing activities with little corrosive effect to the solder interconnects and the IC.
      <br/>
      Ethylene glycol, glycerol, 3-�bis(glycidyl oxy methyl)methoxy�-1,2-propane diol, D-ribose, D-cellobiose, cellulose, 3-cyclohexene-1,1-dimethanol, H2 O are just the examples.
    </p>
    <p num="28">
      Vicosity and rheologic behavior of a no-flow underfill material is another key prarameter for no-flow underfilling process.
      <br/>
      If the viscosity of the no-flow underfill material is too low, the flat or creased surface of the underfill drop can trap air bubbles when the chip is compressed down.
      <br/>
      If the viscosity is too high, the force needed to have the bump penetrate through the underfill material can be out of the function range of a flip-chip bonding machine.
      <br/>
      Moreover, the high viscosity can prevent the formation of good interconnects due to the buoyancy force of the material resulting from the material viscoelastic nature.
      <br/>
      Besides the viscosity, the rheologic behavior (refer to Newtonian, shear-thinning or shear thickening) is also very important to prevent the process voiding.
      <br/>
      Amorphous fumed silica was found to be very effective in controlling the viscosity and rheologic behavior of a no-flow underfill material.
      <br/>
      Treated silylated amorphous fumed silica such as CAB-O-SIL TS-720 from Cabot Corporation and untreated amorphous fumed silica such as CAB-O-SIL M-5 from Cabot Corporation are just the examples.
    </p>
    <p num="29">
      Silane coupling is another key component in designing a successful no-flow underfill material.
      <br/>
      It is used mainly to improve the adhesion between the chip to underfill material and between the underfill material to the substrate.
      <br/>
      Any type of silane coupling agent can be used in a no-flow underfill materials.
      <br/>
      The preferred silane coupling agents used in the invention include amine, epoxy, mercapto, styryl and chloroalkyl type silane coupling agents.
    </p>
    <p num="30">
      Using surfactant in a no-flow underfill material is another way to prevent the process voiding during the flip-chip bonding and subsequent solder joint reflow and material curing.
      <br/>
      These surfactant can be selected from silicones, polyoxyethylene/polyoxypropylene block copolymers, ethylene diamine based polyoxyethylene/polyoxypropylene block copolymers, polyol-based polyoxyalkylenes, fatty alcohol-based polyoxyalkylenes, and fatty alcohol polyoxyalkylene alkyl ethers.
    </p>
    <p num="31">With this in mind, the present invention provides the products consist of: (a) a mixture of a cycloaliphatic epoxide, bisphenol A type epoxide, and a bisphenol F type epoxide, an epoxy novolac resin, a biphenyl type epoxy resin, a naphthalene type epoxy resin and a dicyclopentadiene-phenol type epoxy resin; (b) an organic carboxylic acid anhydride hardener; (c) a curing accelerator, wherein said curing accelerator is selected from the group consisting of alkyl-substituted imidazole, triphenylphosphine, imidazolium salts, onium borates, metal chelates or the mixture thereof; (d) a fluxing agent selected from the group consisting of any chemicals containing --OH group; (e) a Theological viscosity controlling agent; (f) a silane coupling agent; (g) a surfactant.</p>
    <p num="32">
      The cycloaliphatic type epoxides employed as the preferred resin ingredient in the invention are selected from non-glycidyl ether epoxides containing more than one 1,2 epoxy group per molecule.
      <br/>
      These are generally prepared by epoxidizing unsaturated cyclic hydrocarbon compounds, such as cyclo-olefins, using hydrogen peroxide or peracids such as peracetic acid and perbenzoic acid.
      <br/>
