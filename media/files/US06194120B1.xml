      Optical waveguides prepared by irradiating selected regions of positive photochromic polymeric materials with actinic radiation are disclosed.
      <br/>
      The photochromic materials undergo an irreversible photochemical change which results in an increase in the refractive index of light-exposed regions.
      <br/>
      In addition, the materials exhibit negligible second-order polarizability prior to exposure and excellent nonlinear optical properties after exposure and polarization.
      <br/>
      Thus, the exposed regions are particularly useful as the core in active waveguides for use in second-order nonlinear optical applications, as well as the core in passive waveguides.
      <br/>
      In addition, a simple two step process is disclosed for forming optical waveguides from the positive photochromic polymers.
      <br/>
      Optical structures, such as optical integrated circuits, and optical devices which incorporate the waveguides are also disclosed.
      <br/>
      The optical devices may be used as optical modulators, filters, attenuators, amplifiers, frequency converters, and electric field sensors, as well as in other nonlinear optical applications.

    <heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">The present invention relates to photochromic polymer compositions, and more particularly to optical waveguides, waveguide systems, and a process for fabricating optical waveguides from photochromic polymer solutions.</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="3">
      In the rapidly expanding fields of photonics and optoelectronics, optical channel waveguides are becoming increasingly important for on-chip, chip-to-chip, and board-to-board interconnections.
      <br/>
      Optical waveguides are systems or materials designed to direct and/or process light and may be characterized as either passive or active.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      A passive optical waveguide is a physical structure which is-capable of transmitting light while at the same time confining it to a particular region in space.
      <br/>
      In a passive waveguide, this confinement may be achieved by altering the refractive index within the region of the waveguide, the core, so that it is higher than that of the surrounding material, the cladding.
      <br/>
      Light will tend to propagate within the region of higher refractive index and so can be moved from a starting point to an ending point along a path which is defined by the waveguide region.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      In an active optical waveguide, the light is not simply passively transported from one point to another, but is also processed while traveling within the guide.
      <br/>
      More particularly, these waveguides have nonlinear optical properties which are capable of changing the nature of the light (i.e. phase, amplitude, or frequency) as the light passes through the waveguide.
      <br/>
      By altering the properties of the light within a waveguide or a waveguide region, it is possible to encode and decode information and to route it as desired.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      Organic polymeric materials offer important advantages for making both active and passive waveguides because they are thermally stable at high temperatures and may be readily processed and chemically modified to obtain the appropriate linear and nonlinear optical properties necessary to transmit and control light.
      <br/>
      In addition, photochromic organic polymers are of particular interest because of their ability to change refractive index upon irradiation with light at a wavelength within their respective absorption bands.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      Conventional polymeric photochromic compositions include stilbene- and diazobenzene-type dye compounds, which have strong electron donors and acceptors, as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,142,605 to Diemeer et al. and U.S. Pat. No. 5,541,039 to Mcfarland et al.
      <br/>
      These dyes are characterized by their intense absorptions in the visible region and second-order polarizability, making the materials containing them suitable for active waveguides.
      <br/>
      When the materials are irradiated at a wavelength within their corresponding absorption bands, the dyes undergo conformational isomerization.
      <br/>
      This causes the absorption band to shift to shorter wavelengths and is accompanied by a decrease in intensity.
      <br/>
      Consequently, a decrease in refractive index of the polymeric material is observed.
      <br/>
      These photochromic compositions are characterized as "negative systems" due to the decrease in refractive index that occurs upon exposure to light.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      The aforementioned change in refractive index can serve as a mechanism for patterning optical waveguides.
      <br/>
      By exposing some region of the photochromic polymeric film to sufficient intensity within the absorption band, the refractive index of the exposed region is reduced.
      <br/>
      By not exposing a narrow stripe, 1 to 2  MU m for example, a higher index can be maintained in the unexposed area, creating a waveguide, wherein the unexposed area serves as the waveguide core.
      <br/>
      Unfortunately, though, over time, as light propagates through the core, the same irradiation process (often referred to as "photobleaching") that created the waveguide structure in the first place can eventually cause the refractive index of the core to decrease, and the waveguide is "bleached" away.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      Another disadvantage with waveguides formed from conventional negative photochromic compositions is that the waveguides tend to be unstable over time.
      <br/>
      In particular, the photochemical isomerization mechanism discussed above is reversible, and the exposed material will slowly revert to its original state.
      <br/>
      Thus, the refractive index of the exposed region will return to its original higher value, and the usefulness of the material as an optical waveguide will terminate.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      For example, Diemeer et al. reported in Electron.
      <br/>
      Lett. 26, 379 (1990) the use of a polymer containing a dimethylamino nitrostilbene (DANS) electro-optical side chain to fabricate a waveguide.
      <br/>
      By selective photobleaching of the DANS chromophore at 431 nm, the trans form of the DANS was converted to the cis form, thereby reducing the refractive index of the exposed polymer.
      <br/>
      However, this reaction is thermally reversible, and cis-DANS will slowly transform back to the trans form resulting in the loss of optical waveguiding properties.
    </p>
    <p num="11">
      Likewise, Beeson et al. reported in Appl.
      <br/>
      Phys. Lett. 58, 1955 (1991) a system based on the photobleaching of a nitrone compound, 4-N,N-dimethylaminophenyl)-N-phenyl nitrone (DMAPN), at 361 nm.
      <br/>
      Upon irradiation, the nitrone rearranges to an oxaziridine, and the absorption maximum shifts to 274 nm, resulting in a decrease in refractive index.
      <br/>
      However, as discussed by Smets et. al. in J. Polym. Sci. Polym. Chem. Ed. 14, 2983 (1976), the nitrone system is very unstable, and the oxaziridine readily reverts back to the nitrone in the absence of light.
    </p>
    <p num="12">
      More recently, a system based on the photobleaching of o-nitrostilbene at 488 nm was reported by I. A. McCulloch in Macromolecule 27, 1697 (1994), Upon irradiation, the refractive index of the material decreases due to transformation of the dye to isatogen.
      <br/>
      This system was found to be 100 times more photosensitive than the DANS system.
      <br/>
      However, based on a study of the photoreaction by Spitter et al., at J. Org. Chem. 20, 1086 (1955), the exposed region was found to slowly regain its original refractive index resulting in waveguide instability.
    </p>
    <p num="13">
      As is apparent from the prior art, the photobleaching process is not entirely controllable, and waveguides prepared using this method deteriorate over time.
      <br/>
      This is a result of either relaxation of the conformational change back to the original state, or continued bleaching of the core region through normal use.
      <br/>
      Thus, designers have recently turned to alternative methods to create waveguides which have included embossing and reactive ion etching (RIE).
      <br/>
      However, such processes are complex and difficult to perform.
    </p>
    <p num="14">
      Based on the aforementioned problems associated with known techniques for creating optical waveguides, there is an apparent need for the development of more stable photochromic waveguide structures that can be formed using simple photolithographic methods.
      <br/>
      In particular, a need exists for the identification of "positive" photochromic compositions, wherein the refractive index of the light-exposed region increases.
      <br/>
      Waveguide systems formed from such positive photochromic compositions would avoid the "bleaching" problem making them more stable over time.
      <br/>
      In addition, a need exists for positive photochromic compositions that undergo an irreversible photochemical change, thereby eliminating the problems associated with light-initiated isomerizations.
      <br/>
      Replacing traditional procedures for forming, polymeric waveguides which require multi-step processes involving photolithography followed by plasma etching, wet chemical etching, or thermal heating with a simpler process is also highly desirable.
    </p>
    <p num="15">
      Moreover, there is a need for photochromic compositions for use in waveguide systems wherein the materials produced during irradiation have improved second-order nonlinear optical (NLO) properties.
      <br/>
      Larger NLO effects translate into lower power requirements and higher performance in active waveguides.
      <br/>
      Such organic photochromic compositions should exhibit negligible second-order polarizability before irradiation and large second-order polarizability after exposure.
    </p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="16">
      The present invention meets the aforementioned needs and is based on the unexpected discovery that organic polymers appended or doped with moieties or compounds derived from tetracyano compounds, such as tetracyanoquinodimethane (TCNQ)/aniline and its analogues, have utility in the creation of optical waveguide structures and devices.
      <br/>
      Due to the bathochromic shift that occurs during the photochemical reaction of TCNQ/aniline and its analogues to form tricyanoquinodimethane (TCQ)-containing chromophores, the refractive index of these compounds increases upon irradiation.
      <br/>
      The photochemical reaction for TCNQ/aniline is depicted as:  (Chemical Structure image '1' not included in text)
    </p>
    <p num="17">
      The present invention is founded on the discovery that polymeric compositions containing these and similar compounds or moieties make excellent positive photochromic materials for use in the fabrication of optical waveguides.
      <br/>
      In addition, because the photochemical reaction that occurs upon irradiation is an irreversible chemical process, waveguides fabricated from these materials do not suffer from the same type of instability problems apparent in conventional negative photochromic compositions.
      <br/>
      Also, because polymers containing TCQ-like components exhibit excellent second-order nonlinear optical properties after poling, they are particularly useful as the core in active waveguides.
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      The present invention is also directed to the formulation of novel photochromic polymeric materials containing alternative organic chromophores.
      <br/>
      Such materials exhibit negligible second-order polarizability prior to exposure to actinic radiation and excellent nonlinear optical properties after exposure and polarization.
      <br/>
      The present invention also addresses the need for a simple method for preparing high performance optical waveguide systems from the photochromic compositions identified herein.

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="35">
      As stated above, the present invention offers advantages over prior art negative optical waveguide systems and alternate methods of preparation.
      <br/>
      Importantly, the bleaching process, so problematic in negative polymer waveguide systems can be avoided because the present positive photochromic materials use an inverted process.
      <br/>
      That is, the waveguide region is created by exposing the core to actinic radiation and elevating the refractive index of the exposed region.

    <p num="91">
      In the second step of the present method, after the layer of photochromic polymeric material containing compounds or moieties of structure (V) or (III) is formed on the substrate, one or more predetermined regions of the layer is exposed to actinic radiation.
      <br/>
      Control of which areas of the layer are subjected to irradiation is achieved by either: 1) the use of conventional photolithography; or 2) the use of a directed or focused beam light source.
      <br/>
      In the first technique, a mask having the desired waveguide pattern is placed between the photochromic polymeric material layer and the source of actinic radiation.
      <br/>
      The mask has transparent and opaque portions which allow the radiation to pass only through the transparent portions and fall only on the regions of the layer surface where an increase in refractive index is desired.
      <br/>
      Typically, an incoherent light source is used in the photolithographic technique.
      <br/>
      In the second technique, the focused or directed beam source is typically a laser.
      <br/>
      The pattern of the waveguide is accomplished by moving either the substrate or the beam source (while the other remains stationary) in such a way such that the directed beam or focused beam contacts only the desired predetermined regions of the photochromic layer.
      <br/>
      These directed or focused beam techniques are well-known in the art as "direct-writing" methods.
      <br/>
      The use of photolithography or direct-writing simplifies processing requirements and therefore makes the present method ideal for practicing on a commercial scale.
    </p>
    <p num="92">
      The wavelength region and intensity of the actinic radiation must be sufficient to produce a photochemical change in the photoactive compound or pendent sidegroup of structure (III) or (V) of the photochromic material.
      <br/>
      One advantage of the compositions used in the present method is that the photochemical reaction can be carried out using relatively short wavelength radiation so that exposure of the waveguide to radiation normally encountered in processing or in use (i.e. room lights) will not cause degradation of the waveguide over time.
      <br/>
      Suitable sources of ultraviolet light within the 200-400 nm region include incoherent light sources such as high pressure xenon or mercury xenon lamps fitted with appropriate optical filters within the desired wavelength band.
      <br/>
      Coherent light sources include argon-ion lasers or excimer lasers.
      <br/>
      Frequency doubled argon-ion or excimer lasers having an output near 257 nm may also be used.
      <br/>
      Preferably, the actinic radiation is in the form of UV light having a wavelength from about 250 to 350 nm.
      <br/>
      Exposure with a coherent light source involves less time than with an incoherent light source due to increased intensities.
    </p>
    <p num="93">
      Irradiation of predetermined regions of the colorless photochromic polymeric material layer with actinic radiation causes the photoactive component within the regions to undergo a photochemical change, producing a deeply colored dye.
      <br/>
      The maximum of the absorption band corresponding to the dye is red-shifted to about 600-800 nm.
      <br/>
      This dye, referred to herein as an "electro-optical polymeric material", includes appended to or in admixture with the polymer an electro-optical component formed from the photochemical change of structure (V) or (III).
      <br/>
      The electro-optical component exhibits excellent second-order nonlinearity after poling and has the chemical structure (V') or (III') shown above wherein R1 -R4, x, and y are as previously defined.
      <br/>
      The preferred values of R1 -R4, x, and y are the same as those presented above with respect to structures (V) and (III).
    </p>
    <p num="94">
      In addition, the refractive index of the electro-optical polymer increases relative to that of the unexposed, unaltered photochromic polymeric material.
      <br/>
      Because of this increase in refractive index, the actinic radiation is directed to contact only the areas of the photochromic polymeric material where the core of the wavelength is to be produced.
      <br/>
      The surrounding unexposed regions correspond to the cladding of the waveguide.
      <br/>
      Typically, the core is a stripe having a width of about 1-2  MU m.
    </p>
    <p num="95">
      Depending on whether the photoactive component (V) or (III) of the unexposed photochromic polymeric material is a compound or moiety, the electro-optical component (V') or (III') in the exposed regions will likewise be a compound in admixture with the polymer or a moiety appended thereto as a sidegroup.
      <br/>
      Thus, with respect to the core of the waveguide prepared by the present method, when the electro-optical component is a moiety chemically bonded to the backbone of the polymer through R1, structure (V') or (III') is an electro-optical pendent sidegroup on the polymer.
      <br/>
      The polymeric material of the exposed regions or light transmitting core having the electro-optical sidegroup is represented by structural units (VI') and (VIA')  (Chemical Structure image '18' not included in text)
    </p>
    <p num="96">
      B4 is the electro-optical pendent sidegroup of formula (V') or (III'), and A1 and A2 are as previously defined.
      <br/>
      The preferred values of R1 -R4, x, and y are the same as those presented above with respect to structures (VI) and (VIA).
      <br/>
      The more fraction of structural units (VI') in the core is given by p, which has same numeric value as that of structure (VI), from about 0.01 to 1.
      <br/>
      The mole fraction of structural units (VIA') is the same as that for units (VIA), given by 1-p.

    <p num="97">
      Typically, after irradiation, the waveguide layer, which now includes both cladding (photochromic polymeric material) and a light-transmitting core (electro-optical polymeric material), is heated at a temperature and for a time sufficient to remove the solvent.
      <br/>
      It is generally sufficient to dry the optical waveguide structure in an oven overnight at a temperature below the Tg of the polymer, typically about 100 (degree)  C. for polycarbonates and lower for polyacrylates.
    </p>
    <p num="98">
      In the absence of electric field poling, the novel waveguide structures described herein are characterized as passive waveguides.
      <br/>
      However, active waveguides may be formed by positioning at least one electrode onto the waveguide and applying an electric field to "pole", the electro-optical component of the core, as described above.
      <br/>
      Thus, when a polymer contains a dye of structure (V') or (III') and is subsequently subjected to electric field poling, the non-centrosymmetry necessary for nonlinear optical applications, such as modulation, is achieved.
      <br/>
      These polymer compositions also exhibit good thermal stabilities and high glass transition temperatures (up to 191 (degree)  C.), indicating good conformational stability in poled samples.
      <br/>
      In addition, the materials exhibit high electro-optical (EO) coefficients similar to LiNbO3, the most widely used inorganic crystal for NLO applications, indicating the excellent nonlinear efficiency of the dyes.
    </p>
    <p num="99">
      Therefore, in accordance with the present method, the heating step may be conducted in the presence of an applied electrical field so as to orient or pole the electro-optical components of the electro-optical polymeric material.
      <br/>
      After poling, the heating step is followed by a cooling step.

    <p num="100">
      The photochromic polymeric material can be patterned into both slab waveguides and channel waveguides using the above method.
      <br/>
      A planar or slab waveguide is one in which optical energy is confined only to the plane of the layer, i.e. in only one transverse direction.
      <br/>
      For use as an active slab overlay waveguide, the polymeric material can be patterned atop a side-polished fiber to create a side-polished fiber modulator.
      <br/>
      A channel waveguide is one in which optical energy is transversely confined in two transverse directions.
      <br/>
      When used as a channel overlay waveguide atop a side-polished fiber, the dominant loss mechanism or the transverse diffraction of light so prevalent in slab overlays can be significantly reduced or even eliminated.
      <br/>
      As such, channel overlay waveguides may be used as filters where collection of the energy in the overlay is desired or in other devices where eliminating the loss mechanism is advantageous, for example in an amplifier.
      <br/>
      An active channel waveguide is often employed in NLO and electro-optic devices because it permits light to be directed to certain areas of the substrate as well as providing for splitting and combining with optical waves.

      Reference is now made to the drawing figures wherein reference numerals are used throughout multiple figures to designate the same or similar components.
      <br/>
      FIGS. 1a-c illustrate an exemplary optoelectronics device, generally denoted 10, in accordance with the present invention.
      <br/>
      The depicted embodiment is a side-polished/channel overlay compound waveguide device 10 which includes substrate 20 having a portion of a first, elongate waveguide 30 running therethrough.
      <br/>
      First waveguide 30 may comprise, for example, a fiber waveguide, such as a single-mode fiber optic cable having a core 40 encased by cladding 50.
      <br/>
      The fiber transmits or propagates an optical signal through its core along propagation axis ao.
      <br/>
      When such a single-mode optical fiber 30 is side-polished close to its core (e.g., to within 5  MU m), optical coupling is possible to second waveguide 60, which is used as an "overlay" waveguide.
    </p>
    <p num="109">
      Second waveguide 60 comprises one of the novel waveguide structures of the present invention described above and may be a channel overlay waveguide.
      <br/>
      As aforementioned, a channel waveguide differs from a planar or slab waveguide in that the optical energy is transversely confined in two transverse directions in the former, and in only one transverse direction in the latter.
    </p>
    <p num="110">
      FIG. 1b is a cross-sectional view of compound waveguide device 10 showing the generally planar polymeric layer 60 deposited over substrate 20 (through which fiber 30 including core 40 and side-polished cladding 50 is run).
      <br/>
      Second waveguide layer 60 comprises light-transmitting core 80, which comprises an electro-optical polymeric material containing electro-optical component (V') or (III'), and cladding material 70 partially or entirely enclosing the core.
      <br/>
      Cladding 70 comprises a photochromic polymeric material containing a photoactive component of structure (V) or (III).
      <br/>
      The electro-optical polymeric material 80 has a refractive index "r0 " which is greater than the refractive index "r" of the photochromic polymeric material 70 on either of its sides.
      <br/>
      Core 80 is formed by depositing a positive photochromic polymeric material onto a side-polished fiber and exposing a predetermined region of photochromic polymeric material in layer 60 to actinic radiation as described above.
    </p>
    <p num="111">
      In accordance with the invention, second waveguide 60 or channel overlay waveguide 60, is positioned in optical proximity to side-polished portion of first waveguide 30 to provide optical coupling to the evanescent field exposed by the side-polishing of fiber waveguide 30.
      <br/>
      Evanescent coupling of optical energy occurs at least over an optical interaction area 67 (having interaction length LI) between light-transmitting core 80 of polymeric channel waveguide 60 and fiber waveguide 30.
      <br/>
      In exemplary device embodiment 10, optical interaction area 67 is substantially determined by the size of the intersection 65 of the planar polished surface of fiber waveguide 30 and the lower, coupling surface of polymeric channel waveguide 60.
      <br/>
      Interaction length LI, is typically much smaller than the length of channel waveguide 60.
      <br/>
      Those skilled in the art will recognize that this interaction length LI can be controlled, in the side-polished fiber optic embodiment, by careful control of the radius (R) of curvature of the fiber optic cable as it passes through substrate 20 in FIG. 1, as well as the depth of the polishing of the fiber or the design of the overlay.
      <br/>
      In one example, the radius of curvature (R) may be 50 cm, and LI may be 5 mm.
      <br/>
      The elongated shape of channel waveguide core 80 provides a propagation axis a1 therein which is longitudinally aligned with propagation axis a0 of fiber waveguide 30.
      <br/>
      Though FIGS. 1a-c depict a direct contact between waveguides 30 and 60, it will be understood by those skilled in the art that intervening adhesive, transparent electrodes, and/or index matching layers may be present at this interface.
    </p>
    <p num="112">
      Evanescent coupling occurs between waveguide 30 and channel waveguide 60 in the now exposed evanescent field area of the optical signal transmitted along axis a0 of waveguide 30.
      <br/>
      This evanescent coupling causes optical energy to be transferred to light-transmitting core 80 of polymeric channel overlay waveguide 60 from the optical signal propagating in fiber optic 30.
      <br/>
      Core 80 of channel waveguide 60 confines diffraction of coupled optical energy along the axes transverse, or orthogonal, to its axis of propagation a1.
      <br/>
      When amplification, attenuation, or modulation of the optical signal is desired, coupled optical energy remaining in core 80 of the polymeric overlay substantially directly over the fiber optic is available for coupling back into the fiber optic subsequent to being amplified, attenuated, or modulated.
      <br/>
      Exemplary transverse axes are depicted in FIG. 1b, including orthogonal axes a2 and a3.
    </p>
    <p num="113">
      As shown in FIG. 1b, boundaries 62 and 64 between core 80 and cladding 70 of differing indices serve as the optical boundaries which confine the optical energy along the transverse axes.
      <br/>
      Upper boundary 66 and lower boundary 68 similarly confine the optical energy along the vertical axis.
      <br/>
      Thus, transverse or lateral diffraction of the coupled optical energy is limited by the optical boundaries 62, 64, 66 and 68 resulting from the confining, generally rectangular cross-sectional shape of core 80.

    <p num="114">
      FIG. 2 is a cross-sectional view of compound waveguide device 210 similarly including polymeric waveguide layer 260 deposited over substrate 20 having running therethrough fiber 30 including core 40 and cladding 50.
      <br/>
      In this embodiment, channel waveguide core 280 is formed by permitting actinic radiation to penetrate to predetermined depths of the photochromic polymeric layer.
      <br/>
      Channel waveguide core 280 has an index of refraction "r0 " greater than the index "r" of the remaining portions of cladding 270.
      <br/>
      Optical boundaries 262 and 264 are formed on eitherside of core 280 which effect a transverse confinement of the coupled optical energy, and confinement is also effected along the vertical axis by surfaces 266 and 268.

      Optical structure 310 of the present invention may also include optical input 335 and optical output 337.
      <br/>
      Input 335 is optically connected to second portion 361 of optical waveguide 360.
      <br/>
      Thus, optical energy from input 335 enters optical circuit 330 through second portion 361 and then passes to optical device 345.
      <br/>
      This portion 361 of optical waveguide 360 optically connects and physically separates input 335 from optical device 345.
      <br/>
      Optical energy exits optical circuit 330 through optical output 337 which is optically connected to third portion 362 of optical waveguide 360.
      <br/>
      Third portion 362 of the waveguide optically connects and physically separates output 337 from optical device 347 contained in the circuit.
