      An internal voltage generating circuit and method for generating thereof in semiconductor device capable of performing test without any needless transfer between a test equipment and a repair equipment are disclosed.
      <br/>
      The circuit includes a plurality of test power voltage pads, each of which can be selectively applied with the external power voltage and a ground voltage during test; a fuse programmable control signal generator coupled to the plurality of test power voltage pads for generating a control signal according to the signals applied to the plurality of the test power voltage pads during test, and for generating the control signal according to fuse-programmed state after at least one fuse included therein is programmed; a reference voltage generator for receiving the external power voltage so as to produce a reference voltage having a predetermined level; and a voltage trimming unit for trimming the reference voltage in accordance with the output of the fuse programmable control signal generator.

    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="1">The present invention relates to a semiconductor device and, more particularly, to an internal voltage generating circuit of semiconductor device.</p>
    <p num="2">
      Currently, the semiconductor device generally includes an internal voltage generating circuit for generating an internal voltage, the level of which is typically lower than an external power voltage.
      <br/>
      For example, the internal voltage generating circuit in a semiconductor memory device such as EDO DRAM reduces 3.3 V external power voltage to 2.8 V internal power voltage.
    </p>
    <p num="3">
      However, due to deviation in the fabrication process, the voltage level of the internal voltage generating circuit of semiconductor device may not be the desired voltage level.
      <br/>
      For repairing these defects in a test stage of such a semiconductor device, there has been proposed a fuse programmable internal voltage generating circuit.
    </p>
    <p num="4">FIG. 1 is a block diagram for illustrating a general internal voltage generating circuit of semiconductor device, which is programmable.</p>
    <p num="5">Referring to FIG. 1, the internal voltage generating circuit 100 comprises a reference voltage generator 200, a fuse programmable control signal generator 300, a voltage level trimming unit 400 and an internal voltage driver 500 and the generated internal power voltage Vint is applied to an internal circuit 600.</p>
    <p num="6">The reference voltage generator 200 generates a predetermined level of reference voltage Vr1 irrespective of the change of temperature and/or the change of external power voltage, so as to apply the Vr1 to the voltage level trimming unit 400.</p>
    <p num="7">
      The fuse programmable control signal generator 300 includes a plurality of fuses, which are programmed (this means that the fuses are selectively cut) at test stage.
      <br/>
      Thus, according to the programmed fuse state, one of the multiple control signals S is active.
      <br/>
      The voltage level trimming unit 400 trims the level of the reference voltage Vr1 so as to apply its output Vr2 to the internal voltage driver 500.
      <br/>
      At this time, the degree of trimming depends on the multiple control signal S. The internal voltage driver 500 generates the internal power voltage Vint for driving the internal circuit 600, based on the voltage Vr2.
      <br/>
      That is, the output voltage Vr2 of the voltage level trimming unit 400 can be controlled by suitably programming(e.g. selectively cutting) the fuses included in the fuse programmable control signal generator 300 and the level of the internal power voltage Vint can be controlled in turn.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      The test for the semiconductor device having such a fuse programmable internal voltage generating circuit as this must be performed as follows.
      <br/>
      First, the level of the internal power voltage Vint is measured in a test equipment.
      <br/>
      Then, the semiconductor device must be carried to a repair equipment and then the fuses included in the internal voltage generating circuit are selectively cut in the repair equipment so as to trim the internal power voltage Vint.
      <br/>
      After the internal power voltage Vint is trimmed, the semiconductor device must be carried back to the test equipment, so as to pre-test the function of the semiconductor device to determine, for example, whether the memory operation such as data read/write cycle is ordinarily performed or not in the semiconductor memory device.
      <br/>
      If any defect exists, the semiconductor device is carried to the repair equipment again so that the fuses included in the function blocks of the semiconductor device may be selectively cut for repairing.
      <br/>
      This repair, for example, includes the repair for row and column repairs in a semiconductor device.
      <br/>
      After the repair for the function block in semiconductor device is finished, the semiconductor device is carried to the test equipment once again in order to perform the post-test.
    </p>
    <p num="9">As shown, the semiconductor device including the general internal voltage generating circuit has problems in that the semiconductor device must be carried to and from the test equipment and the repair equipment repeatedly and in turn the time for test &amp; repair is needlessly long and the manufacturing process is also needlessly troublesome.</p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="10">

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PRESENT INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="24">Hereinafter, for explaining in detail in such a manner that the present invention may easily be carried out by a person having ordinary skill in the art to which the present pertains invention, the preferred embodiments of the present invention will be described with reference to the accompanying drawings.</p>
    <p num="25">FIG. 2 is a block diagram illustrating an internal voltage generating circuit of semiconductor device, according to one preferred embodiment of the present invention.</p>
    <p num="26">
      Referring to FIG. 2, the internal voltage generating circuit 100 includes a plurality of test power voltage pads TP0, TP1, . . . , TPn, a fuse programmable control signal generator 300, a reference voltage generator 200, a voltage level trimming unit 400, and an internal voltage driver 500.
      <br/>
      The internal power voltage Vint generated from the internal voltage generating circuit 100 is applied to the internal circuit 600.
    </p>
    <p num="27">
      The reference voltage generator 200 generates the reference voltage Vr1 using the external power voltage Vext which is applied from outside of the semiconductor device.
      <br/>
      The external power voltage Vext, for example, may be 3.3 Volts and the reference voltage Vr1 would not depend on the external power voltage Vext and temperature.
      <br/>
      The reference voltage Vr1 is, for example, 0.77 volts.
      <br/>
      The voltage level trimming unit 400 produces the trimmed reference voltage Vr2 by trimming the level of the reference voltage Vr1 according to the control signal S. The trimmed reference voltage Vr2 may be, for example, 2.77 volts.
    </p>
    <p num="28">
      In a specific embodiment, when the external power voltage Vext is lower than a predetermined level Vthl, for example, 2.6 volts, the trimmed reference voltage Vr2 may be controlled to be the same voltage level as the external power voltage Vext.
      <br/>
      In contrast, when the external power voltage Vext is higher than 2.6 volts, the trimmed reference voltage Vr2 may be trimmed to a predetermined level(e.g. 2.77 volts).
    </p>
    <p num="29">
      FIG. 5 is a detailed circuit diagram which illustrates one example of the reference voltage generator 200, which is composed of two PMOS transistors M1 and M2, two NMOS transistors M3 and M4, and a resistor R10.
      <br/>
      In FIG. 5, the gate of PMOS transistor M1 is commonly coupled to the gate of PMOS transistor M2 and the drain thereof.
      <br/>
      The drain of PMOS transistor M2 functions as an output node of the reference voltage generator 200 and is commonly coupled to the drain and the gate of NMOS transistor M4.
      <br/>
      The resistor R10 is coupled between the source of NMOS transistor M3 and the ground voltage Vss.
      <br/>
      The reference voltage generator 200 configured as such, can generate the reference voltage Vr1, the level of which is stable irrespective of the variation of the external power voltage Vext and temperature.
    </p>
    <p num="30">
      Referring back to FIG. 2, the multiple test power voltage pads TP0, TP1, . . . , TPn are coupled to the fuse programmable control signal generator 300.
      <br/>
      At test stage, the multiple fuses included in the fuse programmable control signal generator 300 have not yet programmed.
      <br/>
      In case that the programming is performed, for example, by selectively cutting the fuses, the multiple fuses should remain uncut at the test stage for trimming the internal power voltage Vint.
      <br/>
      In this state, the signals which are the same as those generated when the fuses are programmed (that is as if the fuses were selectively cut) are applied through the test power voltage pads TP0, TP1, . . . , TPn.
    </p>
    <p num="31">
      Specifically, while applying the external power voltage Vext through test power voltage pads TP0, TP1, . . . , TPn, the internal power voltage Vint is produced from the internal voltage driver 500.
      <br/>
      At this time, the level of internal power voltage Vint may be the desired voltage level.
      <br/>
      If the level of internal power voltage Vint is not the desired voltage level, it is determined how much the voltage level is trimmed.
      <br/>
      Then, based on the determined trimming degree, the multiple test power voltage pads TP0, TP1, . . . , TPn are applied with selectively the external power voltage Vext or the internal power voltage Vint.
      <br/>
      By doing this, the multiple control signals S can be selectively activated, as if the fuses were programmed.
    </p>
    <p num="32">
      In addition, the test for function block(s) is performed to account for the condition that the multiple fuses included in the fuse programmable control signal generator 300 are not programmed.
      <br/>
      At this time, the multiple test power voltage pads TP0, TP1, . . . , TPn are selectively applied with one of the external power voltage Vext and the ground voltage Vss depending on the level of trimming degree as described above.
    </p>
    <p num="33">
      Here, the number of the multiple test power voltage pads TP0, TP1, . . . , TPn can be changed depending upon the level of trimming degree.
      <br/>
      For example, the control signal S is 8(=23) and the trimmed voltage level is one of eight voltage levels, in case that the test power voltage pads TP0, TP1, . . . , TPn are three(that is n=3).
      <br/>
      Likewise, if the number of the test power voltage pads TP0, TP1, . . . , TPn is four, the number of the control signals S is 16(=24) and the trimmed voltage level is one of 16 voltage levels.
    </p>
    <p num="34">FIG. 3 is a block diagram illustrating an internal voltage generating circuit of semiconductor device, according to another preferred embodiment of the present invention.</p>
    <p num="35">
      In FIG. 3, the same elements with those of FIG. 2 have the same reference numerals and the explanation thereof will be omitted.
      <br/>
      Referring to FIG. 3, the internal voltage generating circuit 100 further comprises a reference voltage amplifier 700 coupled between reference voltage generator 200 and voltage level trimming unit 400.
    </p>
    <p num="36">
      The reference voltage amplifier 700 may be composed of, for example, a differential amplifier and amplifies the reference voltage Vr1, which is the output of the reference voltage generator 200, so as to produce the amplified reference voltage Vr3.
      <br/>
      In this configuration, the test for level of trimming of the internal power voltage Vint &amp; the test for function blocks may be performed as explained in FIG. 2.
    </p>
    <p num="37">
      In another embodiment of the present invention, the reference voltage amplifier 700 of FIG. 3 may be coupled between the voltage level trimming unit 400 and the internal voltage driver 500.
      <br/>
      In this case, the reference voltage amplifier 700 amplifies the trimmed reference voltage Vr2 so as to apply the amplified reference voltage to the internal voltage driver 500.
    </p>
    <p num="38">
      FIG. 4 is a block diagram illustrating an internal voltage generating circuit of semiconductor device, according to still another preferred embodiment of the present invention.
      <br/>
      In FIG. 4, the same elements with those of FIGS. 2 and 3, have the same reference numerals and the explanation thereof will be omitted.
    </p>
    <p num="39">Referring to FIG. 4, the internal voltage generating circuit 100 includes the reference voltage generator 200, the reference voltage amplifier 700, the fuse programmable control signal generator 300, the plurality of test power voltage pads TP0, TP1, . . . , TPn, the voltage level trimming unit 400, the internal voltage driver 500, a stress voltage generator 800, and a reference voltage modifying unit 900 and the internal power voltage Vint generated from the internal voltage driver 500 is applied to the internal circuit 600 to be driven.</p>
    <p num="40">
      In FIG. 4, the stress voltage generator 800 receives the external power voltage Vext so as to produce the stress voltage Vstress.
      <br/>
      The stress voltage Vstress is substantially the same as the ground voltage Vss when the external power voltage Vext is equal to or lower than a predetermined level(i.e. threshold level Vth1), while the stress voltage Vstress is increased in proportion with the external power voltage Vext when the external power voltage Vext is higher than the threshold level Vth1.
      <br/>
      Here, the threshold level Vth1 is preferably set below the internal power voltage Vint.
      <br/>
      In this case, the stress voltage Vstress has the characteristics in that it is linearly increased with the external power voltage Vext and it may be used for so-called `stress mode` or `burn-in mode`.
    </p>
    <p num="41">
      The reference voltage modifying unit 900 generates the stress reference voltage Vr based on the trimmed reference voltage Vr2 from the voltage level trimming unit 400 and the stress voltage Vstress from the stress voltage generator 800.
      <br/>
      In one preferred embodiment, the stress reference voltage Vr is substantially the same as the trimmed reference voltage Vr2 when the external power voltage Vext is lower than a threshold level Vth2(e.g. 4.6 volts), while the stress reference voltage Vr is substantially the same as the stress voltage Vstress when external power voltage Vext is higher than the threshold level Vth2(e.g. 4.6 volts).
      <br/>
      Here, the threshold level Vth2 is preferable set higher than the internal power voltage Vint.
    </p>
    <p num="42">In FIG. 4, the internal voltage driver 500 includes a operation mode signal generator 510, a standby internal voltage driver 520 and an active internal voltage driver 530.</p>
    <p num="43">
      The operation mode signal generator 510 generates a operation mode signal Pact representing whether the operation mode of the semiconductor device is active mode or standby mode, based on the signals applied from the outside of the semiconductor device, such as /CAS, /RAS, /WE and etc. in a semiconductor memory device.
      <br/>
      In one embodiment, the operation mode signal Pact is "high" level for `active mode` and "low" level for `standby mode`. In the embodiment shown in FIG. 4, the standby internal voltage driver 520 is always activated irrespective of the operation mode, while the active internal voltage driver 530 is activated only when the operation mode signal Pact is "high" level or `active mode`. Thus, only the standby internal voltage driver 520 generates the internal power voltage Vint based on the stress reference voltage Vr in `standby model`, while both the standby internal voltage driver 520 and the active internal voltage driver 530 are activated so as to produce the internal power voltage Vint.
    </p>
    <p num="44">
      Here, the standby internal voltage driver 520 may be composed of a voltage follower for improving the current drivability.
      <br/>
      In standby mode, the internal power voltage Vint, which is the output of the standby internal voltage driver 520, can be used for driving, for example, a/RAS buffer, a/CAS buffer, a bit line precharge voltage VBLP generator, a reference voltage VREF generator, a VBB level generator and so forth in a semiconductor memory device.
    </p>
    <p num="45">
      The active internal voltage driver 530 can be also composed of a voltage follower.
      <br/>
      In this case, it is preferable that the current drivability of the active internal voltage driver 530 is set to be higher than that of the standby internal voltage driver 520.
    </p>
    <p num="46">FIG. 6 is a detailed circuit diagram which illustrates one example of the fuse programmable control signal generator shown in FIGS. 2 to 4.</p>
    <p num="47">Referring to FIG. 6, the fuse programmable control signal generator 300 includes a fuse circuit block 310 and a decoding unit 320.</p>
    <p num="48">

      <br/>
      Each of the fuse circuits 312, 314 and 316 has at least one fuse so that the output thereof can be varied in accordance with the programmed state of the fuse.
      <br/>
      For example, the fuse is connected at initial stage and then can be selectively disconnected (or cut) by programming.
      <br/>
      The fuse circuits 312, 314 and 316 have corresponding positive outputs CUT0, CUT1 and CUT2 and negative outs CUTB0, CUTB1 and CUTB2, respectively.
      <br/>
      The positive outputs CUT0, CUT1 and CUT2 can be varied in accordance with the signals applied to the test power voltage pads TP0, TP1 and TP2, respectively, when the fuses are connected.
      <br/>
      Meanwhile, when the fuses are disconnected by programming, the positive outputs CUT0, CUT1 and CUT2 are substantially the same as the ground voltage Vss.
      <br/>

    <p num="50">The control signals S0, S1, S2, S3, S4, S5, S6 and S7 and the inverted control signals SB0, SB1, SB2, SB3, SB4, SB5, SB6 and SB7 as above, are applied to the voltage level trimming unit 400 as shown in FIG. 7.</p>
    <p num="51">
      FIG. 7 is a detailed circuit diagram which illustrates one example of the voltage level trimming unit, which may be implemented by a so-called voltage divider composed of a plurality of resistors.
      <br/>
      In more detail, the voltage level trimming unit 400 of FIG. 7 includes a plurality of resistors R0, R1, R2, R3, R4, R5, R6, R7 and R8, and a plurality of transfer gates T0, T1, T2, T3, T4, T5, T6 and T7.
      <br/>
      Each of transfer gates T0, T1, T2, T3, T4, T5, T6 and T7 is composed of a PMOS transistor and an NMOS transistor, the drain and source of which are common to each other.
      <br/>
      The resistors R0, R1, R2, R3, R4, R5, R6, R7 and R8 are coupled in series between the input node applied with the amplified reference voltage Vr3, and the ground voltage Vss.
      <br/>
      The transfer gates T0, T1, T2, T3, T4, T5, T6 and T7 are coupled. between the input node and the output node for producing the trimmed reference voltage Vr2; between the connection points of the resistors and the output node, respectively.
      <br/>
      The control signals S0, S1, S2, S3, S4, S5, S6 and S7 and the inverted control signals SB0, SB1, SB2, SB3, SB4, SB5, SB6 and SB7 are applied to the corresponding gate of the transfer gates T0, T1, T2, T3, T4, T5, T6 and T7 for switching control.
      <br/>
      Thus, the amplified reference voltage Vr3 is trimmed according to the activated one of the control signals S0, S1, S2, S3, S4, S5, S6 and S7, so as to produce the trimmed reference voltage Vr2.
      <br/>
      For example, if the control signal S0 is activated to "high", the amplified reference voltage Vr3 is produced as the trimmed reference voltage Vr2 without any trimming.
      <br/>
      In contrast, if the control signal S5 is activated to "high" level, the trimmed references voltage Vr2 has a voltage level according to the following equation (1).  (Equation image '1' not included in text)
    </p>
    <p num="52">Here, if the resistance of the resistors R0, R1, R2, R3, R4, R5, R6, R7 and R8 is the same, the trimmed reference voltage Vr2 is as the following equation (2)  (Equation image '2' not included in text)</p>
    <p num="53">In addition, for accurately performing the voltage level trimming in a specific range, the resistance of R7 and R8 may be set much higher than that of R0 to R6.</p>
    <p num="54">FIG. 8 is a detailed circuit diagram which illustrates one example of the fuse circuit 312 shown in FIG. 6 and the other fuse circuits 314 and 316 can also be implemented with the same configuration.</p>
    <p num="55">
      Referring to FIG. 8, the fuse F0 is coupled between the test power voltage pad TP0 and the node N1.
      <br/>
      The source and the drain of NMOS transistor Q2 are commonly coupled to the ground voltage Vss and the gate thereof is coupled to the node N1, so that the Q2 functions as a capacitor.
      <br/>
      The source-drain path of NMOS transistor Q4 is coupled between the node N1 and the ground voltage Vss and the gate of NMOS transistor Q4 is coupled to the node N2.
      <br/>
      The inverters INV22, INV24 and INV26 are coupled in series and applied with external power voltage Vext and the ground voltage Vss, so as to function as a buffer.
      <br/>
      Also, the output of the inverter INV26 is produced as the positive output CUT0 of the fuse circuit 312 and the output of the inverter INV24 is produced as the negative output CUTB0 of the fuse circuit 312.
    </p>
    <p num="56">
      The operation of the fuse circuit 312 configured like this, will be explained.
      <br/>
      First, we will consider that the fuse F0 is not connected.
      <br/>
      When the fuse F0 is not cut, the node N1 represents the signal which is applied to the test power voltage pad TP0.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, if the test power voltage pad TP0 is applied with the external power voltage Vext, the node N1 represents the same voltage level as that of the external power voltage Vext.
      <br/>
      The inverter INV22 inverts the node N1 so that the output of INV22 is "low" level, which in turn NMOS transistor Q4 is continuously turned off.
      <br/>
      The potential of the node N2 is buffered by the inverters INV24 and INV26 prior to outputting, so that the positive output CUT0 of the fuse circuit 312 is "low" level (e.g. the ground voltage Vss).
      <br/>
      Also, the negative output CUTB0 of the fuse circuit 312 is "high" level (e.g. the external power voltage Vext).
    </p>
    <p num="57">
      On the other hand, if the ground voltage Vss is applied to the test power voltage pad TP0 with the fuse F0 being connected, the potential of the node N1 is "low", which is the same as the ground voltage Vss and the node N2; the output of the inverter INV22 is "high" level.
      <br/>
      Thus, the NMOS transistor Q4 is turned on and the node N1 is stabilized to the ground voltage Vss.
      <br/>
      The signal of the node N2 is buffered by inverters INV24 and INV26 so as to be produced as "high" level of positive output CUT0.
      <br/>
      In addition, the output of the inverter INV24 is "low" level.
    </p>
    <p num="58">
      In contrast, if the fuse 102 is cut, for example, by a laser beam, the node N1 is not affected by the signal applied to the test power voltage pad TP0.
      <br/>
      The potential of the node N1 is determined based on the charge accumulated on the gate of NMOS transistor Q2, which plays a role of capacitor.
      <br/>
      Here, the accumulated charge on the node N1 is discharged as time elapses.
      <br/>
      Thus, if the fuse F0 is cut, the node N1 has no path to be supplied with charge so that the node N1 becomes "low" level.
      <br/>
      When the node N1 is "low" level, the output of the inverter INV22 is "high" level and in turn the NMOS transistor Q4 is turned on and the node N1 is stabilized to "low" level.
      <br/>
      Also, the "high" level of the node N2 is buffered by the inverters INV24 and INV26 so as to be produced as the positive output CUT0 and the "low" level output of the inverter INV24 is produced as the negative output CUTB0.
    </p>
    <p num="59">
      In summary, the output level of the fuse circuit 312 is varied in accordance with the signals applied to the test power voltage pad TP0 when the fuse F0 is not cut, while the positive output CUT0 is "high" level and the negative output CUTB0 is "low" when the fuse F0 is cut.
      <br/>
      Therefore, without programming the fuse F0, the fuse circuit can be operated as if it is programmed, by selectively applying one of the external power voltage Vext or the ground voltage Vss to the test power voltage pad TP0.
