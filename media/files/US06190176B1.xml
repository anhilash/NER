    <heading>TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
    <p num="1">The present invention relates to athletic training equipment and more particularly to a portable dual batter trainer that includes a collapsible support stand, a trainer top plate assembly secured to the collapsible support stand, two tethered batting balls suspended from the trainer top plate assembly, and a removable fabric safety divider securable to the collapsible support stand between the two tethered batting balls; the collapsible support stand including an upper horizontal support assembly, two telescoping, pivoting leg assemblies and a bottom cross brace; each of the two telescoping pivoting leg assemblies including a foot portion including a floor contact tube with two spaced foot tubes extending perpendicularly from the floor contact tube and in parallel with each other and a top pivoting portion having a cross brace receiving tube secured between two foot tube receiving tubes; the two foot tube receiving tubes each having a first receiving tube end pivotally connected to the upper horizontal support assembly and a second pivoting tube end adapted to slidingly receiving one of the two foot tubes; the two foot tubes being adjustably securable in fixed relation to the two foot tube receiving tubes with a height adjustment securing bolt so as to support the trainer top plate assembly at the desired height in use; the bottom cross brace having two brace ends wherein each brace end is insertable into and securable within one of the cross brace receiving tubes by a bolt and nut assembly; the upper horizontal support assembly having three, spaced, parallel oriented, horizontal support tubes; two telescoping, pivoting leg assemblies each pivotally connected to opposite ends of the three spaced parallel oriented, horizontal support tubes of the upper horizontal support assembly and pivotal into an open position oriented perpendicular to the three spaced, parallel oriented, horizontal support tubes and into a closed position folded against the three spaced, parallel oriented, horizontal support tubes; the bottom cross brace being connectable between the two telescoping, pivoting leg assemblies when the two telescoping, pivoting leg assemblies are both positioned in the open position; the two brace ends of the bottom cross brace being each securable to a respective one of the two telescoping, pivoting leg assemblies to maintain the two telescoping, pivoting leg assemblies in the open position; one of the three, spaced, parallel oriented, horizontal support tubes of the upper horizontal support assembly and the bottom cross brace each being provided with tube fastening hook and pile fasteners along a side thereof; the removable fabric safety divider including divider hook and pile fasteners that are companionately attachable to the tube fastening hook and pile fasteners to detachably secure the removable fabric safety divider to the collapsible support stand.</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND ART</heading>
    <p num="2">
      It is often desirable to use training aids when training athletes.
      <br/>
      Although training aids are beneficial in some instances, they are often bulky and difficult to transport to training locations such as little league ball fields.
      <br/>
      It would be desirable, therefore, to have a portable batter trainer that could be easily transported and set up at a training location and just as easily collapsed and transported to a storage location.
      <br/>
      Because it is often necessary for a trainer to supervise more than one athlete at a time, it would be a further benefit to have a portable batter trainer that included two tethered baseballs to allow two athletes to use the batter trainer at the same time.
    </p>
    <heading>GENERAL SUMMARY DISCUSSION OF INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="3">It is thus an object of the invention to provide a portable dual batter trainer that includes a collapsible support stand, a trainer top plate assembly secured to the collapsible support stand, two tethered batting balls suspended from the trainer top plate assembly, and a removable fabric safety divider securable to the collapsible support stand between the two tethered batting balls; the collapsible support stand including an upper horizontal support assembly, two telescoping, pivoting leg assemblies and a bottom cross brace; each of the two telescoping pivoting leg assemblies including a foot portion including a floor contact tube with two spaced foot tubes extending perpendicularly from the floor contact tube and in parallel with each other and a top pivoting portion having a cross brace receiving tube secured between two foot tube receiving tubes; the two foot tube receiving tubes each having a first receiving tube end pivotally connected to the upper horizontal support assembly and a second pivoting tube end adapted to slidingly receiving one of the two foot tubes; the two foot tubes being adjustably securable in fixed relation to the two foot tube receiving tubes with a height adjustment securing bolt so as to support the trainer top plate assembly at the desired height in use; the bottom cross brace having two brace ends wherein each brace end is insertable into and securable within one of the cross brace receiving tubes by a bolt and nut assembly; the upper horizontal support assembly having three, spaced, parallel oriented, horizontal support tubes; two telescoping, pivoting leg assemblies each pivotally connected to opposite ends of the three spaced parallel oriented, horizontal support tubes of the upper horizontal support assembly and pivotal into an open position oriented perpendicular to the three spaced, parallel oriented, horizontal support tubes and into a closed position folded against the three spaced, parallel oriented, horizontal support tubes; the bottom cross brace being connectable between the two telescoping, pivoting leg assemblies when the two telescoping, pivoting leg assemblies are both positioned in the open position; the two brace ends of the bottom cross brace being each securable to a respective one of the two telescoping, pivoting leg assemblies to maintain the two telescoping, pivoting leg assemblies in the open position; one of the three, spaced, parallel oriented, horizontal support tubes of the upper horizontal support assembly and the bottom cross brace each being provided with tube fastening hook and pile fasteners along a side thereof; the removable fabric safety divider including divider hook and pile fasteners that are companionately attachable to the tube fastening hook and pile fasteners to detachably secure the removable fabric safety divider to the collapsible support stand.</p>
    <p num="4">
