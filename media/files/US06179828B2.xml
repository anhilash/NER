    <p num="1">
      1.
      <br/>
      The Field of the Invention
    </p>
    <p num="2">This invention is in the field of catheters, including catheterization systems employing occluding wires for use in perfusion catheters.</p>
    <p num="3">2. The Relevant Technology</p>
    <p num="4">
      Perfusion catheters have become popular in recent years for use in anesthetizing tissues at an insertion site of a catheter and for treating clotted blood vessels, among other uses.
      <br/>
      Perfusion catheters typically feature a cannula having infusion holes in a wall thereof for enabling fluid to flow through the wall onto the sensitive tissues of a patient or adjacent an area in which the practitioner has discovered a clot.
      <br/>
      By positioning the holes of the catheter adjacent the area to be treated, a fluid may be applied to the area, thereby diffusing the clot or anesthetizing the tissues.
      <br/>
      Once the catheter is positioned at the site of the clot, for example, a thrombolytic fluid capable of dissolving the clot, such as urokinase or streptokinase, is delivered to the site of the clot.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      Typical perfusion catheter assemblies comprise a catheter, a fluid supply port, and a hemostasis valve coupled to a proximal end of the catheter which substantially prevents fluid from flowing out a proximal end of the catheter assembly during use.
      <br/>
      Generally, the distal insertion end of the catheter assembly is open and must therefore be occluded prior to irrigating a liquid from a fluid source through the fluid supply port and into an infusion length of the catheter, where the infusion holes are located.
      <br/>
      Occlusion of the distal opening of the catheter assembly may be accomplished by inserting an occluding wire through the valve of the assembly and then inserting the wire further along the length of the catheter.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      The occluding wire substantially seals the distal end of the infusion catheter during use in order to facilitate spray distribution through the holes.
      <br/>
      The occluding wire typically includes a wire body portion and a distal sealing ball portion.
      <br/>
      The sealing ball portion forms a substantially liquid-tight seal at the distal end of the catheter, thereby forcing liquid located proximal to the seal out of the infusion holes of the catheter.
      <br/>
      Because the inner diameter of the catheter is typically larger than the diameter of the wire body portion of the occluding wire, there is ample space within the infusion catheter for the passage of a liquid out of the infusion holes.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      In certain catheters, such as typical 5 French catheters, the inner diameter of the catheter is reduced to a narrow neck at the distal end of the catheter.
      <br/>
      The sealing ball portion of the occluding wire seats against the inner, narrow neck wall portion of the catheter when inserted into the distal end and thereby substantially occludes the distal opening of the catheter.
      <br/>
      Consequently, substantially any liquid forced through the catheter is caused to exit through the infusion holes rather than through the opening.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      In other catheters, such as typical 4 French catheters, the inner diameter of the catheter is constant throughout the catheter, but the diameter of the occluding ball is configured to substantially match the inner diameter of the catheter.
      <br/>
      Thus, the practitioner slides the occluding ball to the distal tip, thereby substantially occluding the passageway of the catheter and forcing fluid to flow out of the side perfusion holes proximal to the occluding ball.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      When the distal end of the occluding wire is positioned in the catheter, the proximal end of the occluding wire is generally positioned within the hemostasis valve of the catheter assembly.
      <br/>
      The valve temporarily prevents the occluding wire from moving until the occluding wire is grasped, pushed, or otherwise moved by a practitioner.
      <br/>
      Consequently, it is generally possible to intentionally or accidentally slide the occluding wire with respect to the catheter, particularly when an adjustable valve is loosened.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      Thus, one ramification of present occluding wire and catheter designs is that during use of the catheter system, the proximal end of the occluding wire is generally slidably movable with respect to the hemostasis valve.
      <br/>
      In addition, the proximal end of the occluding wire generally extends from the proximal end of the catheter assembly and remains exposed to the environment.
      <br/>
      This dynamic results in a variety of different complications.
    </p>
    <p num="11">
      For example, the occluding wire can be inadvertently inserted too far distally through the catheter or retracted proximally from a desired position in the catheter.
      <br/>
      Such inadvertent insertion of the occluding wire may occur when a practitioner accidentally contacts the proximal end of the wire or may be caused by an infusion of fluid under a significant amount of pressure.
      <br/>
      Such inadvertent actions can cause the occluding wire to lose its occluding effect, for example, by causing the occluding ball to exit the distal opening of the catheter or by inadvertently retracting the ball proximally to a distal set of holes, thereby occluding the fluid supply to the distal set of holes.
    </p>
    <p num="12">In addition to the aforementioned drawbacks associated with typical catheterization systems employing occluding wires, other elongate bodies, such as catheters and guidewires can also be inadvertently displaced from or moved within hemostasis valves.</p>
    <p num="13">
      There is therefore a need in the art for an improved catheterization system for percutaneous catheterization of a blood vessel.
      <br/>
      More specifically, there is a need in the art for a catheterization system having an improved occluding wire.

    <heading>SUMMARY AND OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="14">It is therefore an object of the invention to provide an improved occluding wire.</p>
    <p num="15">It is another object of the invention to provide an improved catheterization system.</p>
    <p num="16">It is another object of the invention to provide a catheterization system in which the occluding wire cannot be inadvertently pushed too far into or inadvertently retracted from a catheter.</p>
    <p num="17">It is another object of the invention to provide a catheterization system in which the longitudinal position of the occluding wire is fixed with respect to a catheter of the system.</p>
    <p num="18">It is another object of the invention to provide a catheterization system in which an elongate body of the system is maintained in a fixed position with respect to a hemostasis valve of the system.</p>
    <p num="19">
      The present invention relates to an improved catheterization system.
      <br/>
      In one embodiment, the improved catheterization system comprises a perfusion catheterization system comprising: (i) an occluding wire; (ii) a perfusion catheter, and (iii) a fluid supply port in fluid communication with the catheter.
    </p>
    <p num="20">
      The occluding wire comprises (i) an elongate wire body; (ii) an occluding tip (including an occluding ball or other structure which is larger in diameter than the wire body) coupled to a distal end of the elongate wire body; and (iii) a hub coupled to a proximal end of the elongate wire body.
      <br/>
      The hub of the occluding wire prevents the occluding tip from moving in a longitudinal direction with respect to the catheter once the hub has been coupled to the catheter.
    </p>
    <p num="21">
      The perfusion catheter comprises: (i) a hollow cannula having a cannula wall; and (ii) a hub coupled to the cannula.
      <br/>
      A lumen extends through the cannula from a proximal opening of the cannula to a distal opening of the cannula.
      <br/>
      The cannula wall has a plurality of infusion holes extending therethrough.
      <br/>
      The distal occluding tip of the occluding wire is configured to extend into the lumen of the cannula.
    </p>
    <p num="22">
      The perfusion catheterization system further comprises a fluid supply port.
      <br/>
      The fluid supply port supplies fluid to the cannula for delivery through the infusion holes.
      <br/>
      The fluid supply port can be integral with the catheter or the occluding wire.
      <br/>
      Optionally, an adaptor comprising a fluid supply port and preferably a hemostasis valve is selectively coupled to the catheter hub so as to be in fluid communication with the cannula.
    </p>
    <p num="23">
      The adaptor comprises a hollow tubular body having a proximal end and a distal end.
      <br/>
      The distal end is configured to be coupled to the hub of the catheter.
      <br/>
      A hollow secondary access tube is coupled at one end thereof in fluid communication with the tubular body of the adaptor.
      <br/>
      The secondary access tube is configured to be coupled at an opposing end thereof to a fluid source.
      <br/>
      The secondary access tube thus serves as another example of a fluid supply port for supplying fluid to the cannula.
      <br/>
      The distal occluding tip of the occluding wire is configured to extend through the hollow tubular body of the adaptor and into the lumen of the cannula.
      <br/>
      Thus, the occluding wire is positioned within the tubular body of the adaptor and the cannula of the catheter, while fluid is delivered from the secondary access tube, through the tubular body of the adaptor and into the cannula.
      <br/>
      Upon reaching the distal occluding tip, the fluid is substantially blocked and forced out of the infusion holes proximal to the occluding tip.
    </p>
    <p num="24">
      The hub of the preferred occluding wire comprises a hub body and a gripping flange extending distally from the hub body.
      <br/>
      The gripping flange is configured to be coupled to the hub of the catheter, either directly, or by being coupled to the hub of an adaptor, to thereby couple the hub of the occluding wire in a fixed position with respect to the catheter.
    </p>
    <p num="25">
      The locking hub of the occluding wire of the present invention is particularly useful with straight catheters, i.e., catheters in which the interior surface of the wall of the cannula has substantially the same diameter throughout the length of the cannula.
      <br/>
      As the occluding tip is positioned within a catheter, the hub of the occluding wire couples to the hub of the catheter, thereby fixing the position of the tip of the occluding wire.
      <br/>
      This prevents the tip from being extended distally outside of the catheter or moved proximally past the infusion holes of the catheter.
      <br/>
      Thus, the occluding wire cannot be accidentally pulled from out of the catheter or accidentally pushed through the catheter, thereby insuring a desired fluid flow pattern.
    </p>
    <p num="26">
      The occluding wire is particularly useful with a 4 French catheter or other catheter which typically does not have a narrowing neck at the distal terminus thereof.
      <br/>
      In such straight catheters, the occluding tip is freely movable along or out of the catheter in the absence of the locking hub of the present invention.
    </p>
    <p num="27">
      As another advantage to applicants' system, a substantial variability or tolerance ratio in the distance between the proximal end of the occluding wire and the occluding tip of the wire is allowable.
      <br/>
      Thus, even if the location of the occluding tip is not exactly positioned as designed with respect to the proximal end of the wire, the occluding wire nevertheless achieves a substantial seal between the occluding tip and the interior surface of the catheter.
    </p>
    <p num="28">In other systems which rely solely on the seating of the ball against a narrowing neck, however, variability or error during the manufacturing process can prevent the mating of the ball against the neck, thereby preventing a desired seal.</p>
    <p num="29">
      In the present invention, a substantial seal is possible both (i) in straight catheters which have no narrowing neck; and (ii) in catheters with a narrowing neck regardless of whether the occluding tip mates with the narrowing neck.
      <br/>
      Instead of requiring seating against a narrowing neck, the distal end of the occluding wire is selectively located into a desired position when the hub of the occluding wire is located into a desired position.
      <br/>
      Thus, the catheterization system of the present invention is useful with straight catheters and catheters having a narrowing neck.
      <br/>
      However, the invented system does not rely solely upon the narrowing neck to form a seal.
    </p>
    <p num="30">
      Although the locking hub of the present invention is particularly useful with occluding wires used in catheters having infusion holes in the cannula thereof, the locking hub can also be employed in conjunction with a variety of different elongate members used in a variety of different catheters.
      <br/>
      By locking against a hemostasis valve, for example, the locking hub can assist the valve in blocking fluid flow and can prevent inadvertent movement of the elongate member, such as during the adjustment of an adjustable hemostasis valve.
    </p>

      Lumen 28 is sized to receive occluding tip 26 of wire 12.
      <br/>
      Wall 32 has a plurality of infusion holes 34 extending therethrough.
    </p>
    <p num="38">
      Catheter 16 further comprises a hub 40 coupled in fluid communication with proximal end 36 of cannula 30.

      Hub 40 is configured to receive occluding tip 26 of occluding wire 12 therethrough.
      <br/>
      Hub 40 of catheter 16 may include a male or female lure lock connector or another connector, for example.
      <br/>
      The catheter presently preferred is a single lumen catheter, although a variety of different catheter embodiments may be employed in the present invention.
    </p>
    <p num="39">
      Occluding wire 12 of the present invention is particularly useful when employed in conjunction with a catheter having a substantially straight cannula, i.e., a cannula in which the interior surface of the wall of the cannula has substantially the same diameter throughout the length of the cannula, rather than having a cannula which has a neck or other narrowing of the interior surface of the cannula.
      <br/>
      For example, in FIG. 1, the interior surface 42 of wall 32 of cannula 30 has substantially the same diameter throughout the length of cannula 30.
      <br/>
      Also by way of example, in one embodiment, the catheter used in the system of the present invention comprises a 4 French catheter.
    </p>
    <p num="40">
      Occluding wire 12 may be used in conjunction with catheters having internal necks or narrowing portions.
      <br/>
      However, one major benefit of occluding wire 12 is that such an internal neck is not required to properly seat tip 26 of occluding wire 12 in a desired position within catheter, e.g., distally from infusion holes 34.
      <br/>
      Instead, tip 26 is maintained in a fixed position with respect to the longitudinal axis of cannula 30 without requiring the narrowing of a neck or tip portion of cannula.

      In one preferred embodiment, adaptor 17 comprises a hemostasis valve assembly 60 and hub 52 comprises a rotating knob 59 of hemostasis valve assembly 60.

      The hemostasis valve assembly 60 may comprise a slit valve or a touhy borst valve, for example.
      <br/>
      One primary purpose of the valve assembly 60 is to maintain a fluid seal around elongate wire body 18 or another instrument to prevent the leaking of blood and other bodily fluids as elongate wire body 18 or another instrument is positioned within valve assembly 60.

    <p num="47">
      Once adaptor 17 has been coupled to catheter 16, the process of selectively coupling hub 24 of occluding wire 12 to hub 52 of adaptor 17 immovably fixes the longitudinal position of proximal end 64 of occluding wire 12 and proximal end 43 of adaptor 17 with respect to each other such that distal occluding tip 26 is in a fixed position with respect to cannula 30 of catheter 16.
      <br/>
      Thus, occluding tip 26 is positioned within catheter 16 so as to substantially occlude the passage of fluid within lumen 28 past occluding tip 26.

      <br/>
      The tube and passageway (and a tube or passageway of an adaptor) are also examples of a fluid supply port in fluid communication with the cannula.

      With reference now to FIG. 5, occluding tip 26 has an occluding ball 90 coupled to distal end 22 of wire body 18.
      <br/>
      A spring coil 92 having a distal rounded tip 94 is coupled to occluding ball 90.
      <br/>
      Occluding tip 26 is an example of occluding means coupled to distal end 22 of elongate wire body 18 for substantially occluding the lumen 28 of catheter 16.
      <br/>
      However, a variety of different tips may be employed in the present invention for substantially occluding the lumen 28 of catheter 16, including tips having various shapes and configurations and which are larger in diameter than wire body 18.
    </p>
    <p num="60">
      Tip 26 is configured to have a diameter which will allow sliding of tip 26 through cannula 30, yet enable tip 26 to substantially occlude cannula 30.
      <br/>
      Thus, the practitioner slides tip 26 to a desired position within cannula 30, e.g., past occluding holes 34, to thereby substantially occlude the passageway of cannula 30 and force fluid to flow out of holes 34.
    </p>
    <p num="61">
      Hub 24 maintains at least a portion of tip 26 within cannula 30 during use.

      In one embodiment, for example, the diameter of ball 90 is slightly larger than that of coil 92 and rounded tip 94, but the diameter of tip 26 is nevertheless substantially uniform from proximal end 96 to distal end 98.
      <br/>
      This substantially uniform diameter provides for convenient and smooth sliding of tip 94 through cannula 30, as opposed to systems having a ball which is dramatically larger than the spring coil.

      Additional examples of elongate bodies which can be coupled to hub 24 or hub 116 or another such hub of the present invention include guidewires, catheters, various cannulas, and a variety of other elongate bodies known in the art and yet to be produced.

      In addition to selectively locating the distal end of the elongate body in a fixed position with respect to the catheter, such coupling assists in preventing the flow of liquid from the valve.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, such coupling adds convenience to the use of adjustable valves since the locking hub can assist the valve in blocking fluid flow while the practitioner is still able to manipulate a rotating knob of the valve to adjust the hemostasis valve, for example.
