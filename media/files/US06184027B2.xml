    <heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">The invention generally relates to microbiology and reagents and methods for identifying fungi and bacteria in samples of biological fluids, foods, water, air, solutions and the like; and, specifically, to diagnostic reagents and methods for detecting and quantifying fungi and bacteria, as well as, for distinguishing between bacteria and fungi in a sample.</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="3">
      Rapid tests for identification of pathogenic bacteria, fungi and their products are becoming increasingly important to health care professionals, as well as individuals responsible for water and food safety.
      <br/>
      Timely identification and generic classification of etiologic agents is a key to preventing spread of disease, and is also effective to expedite patient treatment and thereby reduce costs associated with disease management.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      Microbiological stains are diagnostic reagents capable of identifying bacteria and fungi from cultures, but they commonly are not useful as rapid diagnostic tests with patient samples because of cross-reactivity with natural mammalian and plant products and with other non-pathogenic microorganisms.
      <br/>
      While gram-staining for bacteria remains a most useful diagnostic criteria in evaluation of isolated bacterial cultures, the reagents and methods generally lacks sensitivity because many groups of bacteria stain either poorly or not at all.
      <br/>
      Similarly, histological staining of polysaccharides using Grocott methenamine silver nitrate as a test for fungi lacks sensitivity and is subject to confusing non-specific cross-reactions with e.g. connective tissue proteoglycans, glycosaminoglycans and mucins.
      <br/>
      Commonly, definitive identification and confirmation of infection, or contamination, requires multiple tedious steps of culture and multiple different testing methods and often these procedures are not suitable for use in smaller clinical test laboratories.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      Bacterial envelopes are composed of an inner phospholipid bilayer with membrane proteins surrounded by a rigid shell of covalently linked peptidoglycan that is reactive with crystal violet and iodine, i.e., the envelope in gram positive bacteria.
      <br/>
      Gram-negative bacteria have the latter structure, but with lesser amounts of peptidoglycan, and their envelope includes an additional outer membrane characterized by lipopolysaccharide (LPS), porins and transport proteins.
      <br/>
      Peptidoglycan structures vary in different bacteria.
      <br/>
      In E. coli peptidoglycan, N-acetylglucosamine alternates with N-acetylmuramic acid in  BETA (1,4)-glycosidic bonds to form complex polymers with tetrapeptide side chains.
      <br/>
      The latter side chains are composed of L-Ala-D-Glu-mesodiaminopimelic acid-D-Ala.
      <br/>
      Cross-linking between peptidoglycan chains forms a gel that varies in consistency dependent upon the degree of cross-linking.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      In contrast, most pathogenic fungi contain chitin in their cell walls, septa and sporcs, both in hyphal and yeast forms.
      <br/>
      Chitin is a  BETA 1 --&gt; 4 linked polymer of only 2-deoxy-2-acetamindoglucose (N-acetyl glucosamine, abbreviated GlcNAc).
      <br/>
      Chitin is also found in tissues of insects and crustaceans.
      <br/>
      Certain classes of fungi have cell walls that contain both chitins and murein-like compounds.
      <br/>
      However, the murein-like compounds are commonly hidden within thick protective cell wall structures, and/or expressed only in low levels.
      <br/>
      Fungi, as eukaryotes, also have many similarities with mammalian cells, often making it more difficult to distinguish between patient cellular materials and fungal products.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      Immunoassays used in clinical microbiology commonly rely on antibodies that, while highly specific, are also narrowly reactive, e.g., with a single defined epitope in a complex carbohydrate structure of a particular serotype of bacteria.
      <br/>
      Cross-reactivity of reagents with more than one different type of bacteria is often viewed as an undesirable performance attribute.
      <br/>
      Antibody reagents also frequently are unable to distinguish between a whole bacteria and the degradative products of a bacteria, and as a result breakdown products can act as `confounding`, or `interfering, substances` in diagnostic assays.
      <br/>
      Where enzymes are used in immunoassays, they are commonly used to generate a detectable signal.
      <br/>
      For example, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) such as those disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,233,402 and 4,486,530, involve labeling an antibody (or antigen) by covalently linking it to a catalytically active enzyme.
      <br/>
      The presence (or amount) of the labeled compound may be determined in an assay by adding an enzyme substrate that produces a measurable signal (e.g., a colored product or fluorescence.) While certain assay formats rely upon re-activation of an inactivated-enzyme (e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 4,043,872), generation of a signal in an ELISA commonly requires a catalytically active enzyme, and preferably one having giving a rapid production of product (i.e., a high turnover number.) Catalytically active enzymes considered for possible use in diagnostic immunoassays include those hydrolyzing glycosidic bonds (e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 4,208,479 at column 17; U.S. Pat. No. 4,299,916 at column 33.)
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      Enzymes are given names indicating both the principal substrate and the reaction catalyzed.
      <br/>
      However, few enzymes are absolutely specific to the structure of a particular substrate and most can act on closely related structural analogues of their physiological substrates, although usually at reduced rates.
      <br/>
      The Commission on Enzymes of the International Union of Biochemistry has evolved a systematic nomenclature for enzymes based on the reactions catalyzed.
      <br/>
      Lysozyme, classified as a glycoside hydrolase in IUB class EC3.2.1 (i.e., IUB class EC3.2.1.17), has specificity for compounds containing N-acetylmuramic acid and a peptide side chain (i.e., mureins.) Lysozymes from different species catalyze hydrolysis of  BETA (1,4) bonds between N-acetylmuramic acid and adjacent sugar residues in mureins and chitins, but chitins more slowly.
      <br/>
      Chitinase, classified as an N-glycosyl hydrolase (i.e., IUB class EC3.2.1.14), binds and degrades chitin and murein, but murein much more slowly than chitin.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      It would be highly desirable for clinical test laboratories to have access to reagents that, while specifically reactive with many genera of bacteria and fungi, are also useful as reagents in assays that distinguish between bacterial and fungal infection or contamination.
      <br/>
      However, the array of different antigens in bacteria and fungi that are available as potential targets for development of immunoassays is somewhat bewildering.
      <br/>
      Also, increasingly laboratory personnel are being placed at a potential risk of exposure to debilitating or life threatening diseases by contact with infected patient samples.
      <br/>
      While it is commonly an aim to conduct all assays with non-infectious materials, the resultant fixed and killed bacterial samples often contain denatured antigens that are poorly reactive with assay reagents.
      <br/>
      Diagnostic reagents reactive with fixed, and/or killed and dead bacterial and fungal products are highly desirable.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      Bacteria, fungi and their products are often present in samples in vanishingly small amounts.
      <br/>
      Recently, attempts have been made to develop sensitive alternatives to immunoassays by using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and enzyme-linked oligonucleotide probe methods. (InfectioDiagnostics Corporation of Quebec, Canada has disclosed a PCR test method for detection of bacteria.) Unfortunately, these test methods are often time-consuming, e.g. requiring repetitive thermal cycling for amplification, and also requiring highly trained personnel and special laboratory conditions to insure optimal performance.
      <br/>
      Reagents and methods capable of rapidly detecting very small numbers of bacteria and fungi in samples would be of great importance in clinical testing of patient materials, as well as in monitoring food, air and water.
    </p>
    <p num="11">
      Objects of the invention provide reagents and assays for detecting small numbers of killed and treated bacteria and fungi from a wide range of different genera.
      <br/>
      The reagents and assays are unreactive with any products in normal mammalian tissues and are also capable, in certain objects, of distinguishing between bacterial and fungal infection or contamination.
      <br/>
      Other objects provide a variety of methods for detecting eubacteria which do not require any special personnel training or facilities for optimizing their use.

      The diagnostic reagents of the invention contain non-antibody murein-binding polypeptides that are substantially purified and preferably modified from their native structure or amino acid sequence, e.g. through genetic or chemical modification(s), to render them most effective in the disclosed methods.
      <br/>
      Murein-binding polypeptides have amino acid sequences capable of binding to denatured bacterial murein ligands and fungal murein-like ligands as they appear in fixed and denatured bacterial and fungal particles.
      <br/>
      Murein-binding polypeptides are reactive with the latter murein ligands as they appear in alcohol fixed (e.g., 80% ethanol), or alkaline denatured (e.g., 2M NaOH, 60 (degree)  C. for 30 minutes) and/or protease treated (e.g., 0.25% trypsin, 37 (degree)  C., 30 minutes), and/or periodate-treated, and/or acetic anhydride-treated dead bacterial and fungal particles.
      <br/>
      Binding of the murein binding polypeptides to the murein ligands is high affinity and specific with little or no detectable cross-reactivity with mammalian or plant products.
      <br/>
      Non-antibody murein-binding proteins include native and catalytically disabled enzymes selected from among murein biosynthetic and hydrolytic enzymes produced by mammals, insects, bacteria, bacteriophage and fungi.
    </p>
    <p num="13">
      Murein-binding polypeptides are preferably purified substantially for use and may be chemically conjugated to a signal generating compound such as a fluorophore, a magnetic particle, a latex bead or an enzyme, and may also be linked to biotin or avidin.
      <br/>
      In-situ binding, enzyme-substrate (ISBES) assay methods, disclosed herein, employ the murein-binding polypeptide reagents to detect and quantify bacteria and fungi in-situ, i.e. without isolation and culture.
      <br/>
      The assay methods include steps for detection of bacteria and fungi in fixed tissue samples by histochemistry; in samples of bodily fluids such as urine by flow cytometry or by enzyme-linked solid phase methods; in blood by machine assay methods or latex dipstick methods; and, in food, air, water samples by dot-blot methods.
      <br/>
      ISBES sample preparation methods include the step of treating a biological sample to simultaneously effect the following: namely, (i) killing infectious bacterial, fungal or viral agents in the sample to produce dead bacterial and fungal particles; (ii) lysing mammalian cells such as erythrocytes and leukocytes; (iii) disaggregating bacterial and fungal rafts into uniform single cell/particle suspensions; (iv) dissociating bacterial and fungal particles from other possible particulate materials in the samples such as, plant cellulosic and lignin materials; (v) removing exterior fungal cell wall surface layers to expose murein-like compounds in the dead particles; (vi) removing/denaturing mammalian cellular materials that might cross-react in the assay and contribute to nonspecific background; (vii) denaturing bacterial and fungal cell surface polypeptides to increase susceptibility to protease treatments and/or to increase accessibility of murein-like ligands for binding to murein binding polypeptides; and, while (viii) retaining the ability of the dead denatured bacterial and fungal particles to react with natural and modified murein binding polypeptides.
    </p>
    <p num="14">
      Murein binding polypeptide reagents and ISBES assay methods offer cost-savings and other commercial advantages (e.g., shelf life stability) for manufacturers and users of diagnostic test reagents, kits and reagent packages marketed for detecting bacterial and fungal infections.
      <br/>
      In addition, quantitative and qualitative flow cytometry and cytofluorimetric ISBES methods are disclosed for determining the presence, severity and type of microbial infection in a patient by detecting and quantifying the number of bacterial and/or fungi in a biological sample which are reactive with a murein binding polypeptide reagent.
      <br/>
      The latter particle size and light scattering ISBES methods allow rapid quantification and/or discrimination between bacteria and fungi in patient samples, and are not effected by the presence of cell wall fragments.
      <br/>
      Kits are also disclosed for identifying eubacteria and fungi in samples of air, water and biological samples.

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading>
    <p num="16">Documents cited herein by identification number, e.g. (1), are listed in the Citations section which follows the Examples section, below.</p>
    <p num="17">
      In retrospect, few aspects of the present invention could have been expected based on the experience in the art at the time of the invention.
      <br/>
      For instance, Ka 's for binding of native lysozyme to chitotriose are in the range of 1.1 * 105 L/mol (3), 0.9-1.7 * 105 L/mol (4); and for binding of catalytically inactivated lysozymes to chitotriose are in the range of 4.4 * 105 L/mol (Gln35), 4.0 * 105 L/mol (Asp52) (4).
      <br/>
      While chemically inactivated and mutant lysozymes, their methods of preparation, and their binding affinities had been disclosed previously, the compositions in the art were generally not suitable for preparation of a diagnostic reagents for the following reasons: namely,
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      1.
      <br/>
      Catalytically active lysozymes degrade murein compounds;
      <br/>
      2.
      <br/>
      Chemically inactivated lysozyme enzyme preparations were, in many cases, not of sufficient purity for use, and if pure, often contained active enzyme as a contaminant and/or were not stable because they underwent regeneration of enzyme activity (5);
      <br/>
      3. Catalytically inactive lysozyme reportedly binds non-specifically to human rbc, mouse rbc, chicken rbc, and Hep G2 cells as strongly as the lectin wheat gern agglutinin (6) creating an unacceptably high background;
      <br/>
      4.
      <br/>
      Normal human serum, lymphocytes, monocytes and PMNs reportedly
      <br/>
      contain endogenous chitinases (7) that could constitute confounding or interfering substances in a diagnostic assay;
      <br/>
      5.
      <br/>
      Lysozyme known to be present in biological samples, e.g., secretions, at high levels and is also a major cationic protein in the azurophil and specific granules of PMN (7,11) which are released into inflammatory secretions;
      <br/>
      6.
      <br/>
      Bacterial and fungal cell wall components such as (GlcNAc-MurNAc)2 are known inhibitors of lysozymes (5; Ka 4.2 * 103) and capable of inhibiting these enzymes in a diagnostic assay format; and,
      <br/>
      7.
      <br/>
      Bacterial LPS is a reported non-competitive inhibitor of lysozyme which has a Ka for binding in the range of 108 L/mol (11).
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      In consideration of these factors, mammalian cell debris in biological samples would be expected to constitute an unacceptable high background preventing use of lysozymes and chitinases in diagnostic assays.
      <br/>
      In addition, bodily fluids would be expected to contain endogenous lysozymes and chitinases capable of acting as both potential interfering substances in diagnostic assay; and as hydrolases cleaving the analytes in a murein-binding diagnostic assay.
      <br/>
      Bacterial and/or fungal cell wall materials and biosynthetic products would also be expected to inhibit the binding of a murein binding polypeptide to bacterial and/or fungal cell wall analyte.
      <br/>
      Thus, in retrospect, the disclosure in PCT/US92/02593 (Tuse et al.; filed first in April of 1991 and without benefit of present day understanding) was not justified in its prophetic assumptions that chitinase (or lysozyme) could be used in diagnostic assays without significant and undue experimentation.
      <br/>
      Similarly, while Benjaminson (9) and Chamberlain (8), which disclosed use of F-NHS-chitinase for detecting chitin in histologic sections of plant tissues, is not helpful in determining how one might proceed from a plant histochemical assay to a non-histologic diagnostic assay useful with biological samples of air, water, food, or bodily fluids.
      <br/>
      The Tuse international patent application (supra) did not apparently disclose catalytically inactive murein binding proteins.
    </p>
    <p num="20">Binding of lysozyme and other murein binding polypeptides to denatured, fixed and killed bacterial and fungal particles is also believed to have been unknown at the time of the invention, including binding to bacterial murein compounds, or fungal murein-like compounds in dead bacterial and fungal particles after alcohol fixation (e.g., 80% ethanol), alkaline denaturation (e.g., 2M NaOH at 60 (degree)  C. for 30 minutes), and/or protease treatment (e.g., 0.25% trypsin at 37 (degree)  C. for 30 minutes), and/or treatment with periodate, N- or O-glycosidases and/or treatment with acetic anhydride (as disclosed further below); or, that the subject binding with these denatured particles would be of sufficient affinity (e.g., greater than nanomolar binding) and with little or no detectable cross-reactivity (e.g., with mammalian and plant food substances), so as to enable use of the reagents prepared from these murein binding polypeptides in diagnostic assay formats.</p>
    <p num="21">The following properties of the instant in-situ binding enzyme-substrate (ISBES) methods were also believed to be unknown: namely, that treating certain types of biological samples could simultaneously effect the following: namely, (i) killing infectious bacterial, fungal or viral agents in the sample to produce dead bacterial and fungal particles; (ii) lysing mammalian cells such as erythrocytes and leukocytes; (iii) disaggregating bacterial and fungal rafts into uniform single cell/particle suspensions; (iv) dissociating bacterial and fungal particles from other possible particulate materials in the samples such as, plant cellulosic and lignin materials; (v) removing exterior fungal cell wall surface layers to expose murein-like compounds in the dead particles; (vi) removing/denaturing mammalian cellular materials that might cross-react in the assay and contribute to nonspecific background; (vii) denaturing bacterial and fungal cell surface polypeptides to increase susceptibility to protease treatments and/or to increase accessibility of murein-like ligands for binding to murein binding polypeptides; and, while (viii) retaining the ability of the dead denatured bacterial and fungal particles to react with natural and modified murein binding polypeptides.</p>
    <p num="22">
      Embodiments of the invention provide murein-binding polypeptides and peptides (inclusively abbreviated MBP) that are capable of binding to a wide variety of different bacterial mureins and fungal murein-like compounds in a highly specific and saturable manner.
      <br/>
      While mureins are present in higher concentrations in gram-positive bacterial cell walls, they are also present (at lower concentrations) in gram-negative, other eubacteria and murein-like compounds are present in certain fungi.
      <br/>
      The highly sensitive and specific reagents and ISBES assay methods disclosed herein allow detection of bacterial murein compounds and murein-like fungal compounds even when present at relatively low concentrations.
      <br/>
      Preferably, the subject MBP have a binding affinity for diose, triose and tetraose bacterial and fungal cell wall compounds that is in the range of about 10-3 L/mol to about 10-5 L/mol; and, the subject compounds are effective to bind the subject murein or murein-like compound with a association constant (Ka) in the range of about 5 * 10-5 L/mol to about 10-9 L/mol, preferably 5 * 10-7 L/mol to 10-9 L/mol, and most preferably greater than 10-9 L/mol.
      <br/>
      The subject pan-reactive murein-binding proteins are used in a substantially purified form to formulate reagent preparations for use in diagnostic assays.
      <br/>
      Substantial purity may be achieved e.g. by biochemical purification from natural sources, or from selected bacterial, fungal, mammalian, avian, or insect sources; or, from the product of a genetically engineered expression system.
      <br/>
      Preferably, the instant murein-binding polypeptides (or peptides) are synthetic, modified, mutated, chemically inactivated and/or genetically re-engineered non-antibody polypeptides (or peptides) that take their origin from a variety of different wild-type polypeptides exhibiting an intrinsic binding affinities and specificities for bacterial mureins.
      <br/>
      The subject wild type murein-binding polypeptides suffer from certain disadvantages that may discourage their use in diagnostic assay formats, i.e. they may have a binding affinity for murein that are too low to encourage their use as a pan-bacterial reagent; or, they may be cross-reactivity with other bacterial carbohydrates and lack specificity; or, they may have a large and cumbersome molecular size that discourages their use because of the cost of materials required to run an assay ; or, they may be catalytically active and degrade mureins into soluble peptidoglycan products that are not longer detected in a diagnostic assay format.
      <br/>
      Representative examples of wild type catalytically active polypeptides that bind and cleave mureins include, but are not limited to, bacterial, fungal, mammalian, insect and avian bacterial cell wall degrading enzymes: e.g., muramidases, lysozymes, chitinases,  BETA -glucosidases as well as murein biosynthetic and degradative enzymes, (e.g. catalyzing the reverse reaction.) Other representative examples of wild type precursors for the subject murein-binding proteins include lectins, and hybrid molecules, e.g., derived by recombinant or protein cross-linking methods.
      <br/>
      In general, wild-type (i.e., natural) murein-binding polypeptides are tested to determine whether their binding affinity falls within the range requisite for use in an assay according to the instant invention; in particular the subject wild-type murein binding polypeptides are tested to determine whether they will bind to killed and denatured bacteria and fungal particles according to the steps of the instant ISBES method (supra); and, whether the subject wild-type polypeptides contain enzymatic activity and whether that activity can be tolerated in an assay according to the instant ISBES methods (supra.) Preferably, the subject murein-binding polypeptides have less than 10% of the catalytic activity of a wild-type murein parental polypeptide.
      <br/>
      Most preferably, the subject murein-binding polypeptides have less than 5% of the catalytic activity of a wild-type polypeptide.
      <br/>
      However, as illustrated in the Examples section below, the chemical treatment steps (supra) of the instant ISBES assay methods allowed the detection of killed and denatured bacterial and fungal particles in urine sediments using a fluorescent conjugate of wild-type catalytically active hen egg white lysozyme.
    </p>
    <p num="23">
      Binding affinity (supra), choice of MBP (supra) and the steps of the instant ISBES assay method (supra) are considered key factors in achieving success in the commercial diagnostic assays provided by the embodiments of the invention.
      <br/>
      Most preferably, embodiments of the invention provide MBP compositions having binding affinities (Ka) in excess than 10-9 L/mol, and most preferably MBP compositions that are substantially pure preparations consisting of MBP that have a binding site capable of binding several sugar residues constituting the polysaccharide backbone (i.e., a spatial motif) of a murein ligand.
      <br/>
      The subject spatial motif preferably has about 4 to about 8 sugar residues, most preferably about 4 to about 6, with at least 2 of the residues selected from among N-acetylglucosamine and N-acetylmuramic acid.
      <br/>
      Most preferably, the subject spatial motif has about 6 sugar residues, with at least 2 of the residues selected from among N-acetylglucosamine and N-acetylmuramic acid.
      <br/>
      Natural or catalytically inactivated hen egg white lysozyme is a representative example of a murein binding composition having a binding site that recognizes a 6 sugar spatial binding motif in murein, and related compounds, and recognizes murein and murein-like compounds in killed and denatured bacterial and fungal particles prepared according to the instant ISBES assay methods.
      <br/>
      Catalytically inactive chitinase is one representative example of a murein binding composition having a binding site that recognizes a 4 sugar spatial binding motif in chitin and related compounds.
    </p>
    <p num="24">
      Embodiments of the invention provide, uniformity of compositions capable of conferring specificity and sensitivity on diagnostic assay.
      <br/>
      The subject compositions enable preparation of diagnostics reagents within the precise bounds necessary for regulatory compliance according to quality control and quality assurance protocols.
      <br/>
      The subject compositions have high binding affinity and advantageous stability at different temperatures and on a storage shelf-life (i.e., shelf-life stability.) In one presently preferred embodiment, catalytically inactive lysozyme is stable at acid pH (i.e., pH 4) and resists heating at 100 (degree)  C. at pH 4.5 for about 3 minutes.
      <br/>
      The subject high binding affinity and physical stability enables rapid commercially viable assay formats, i.e., requiring less than about 15 minutes to accomplish binding between an MBP and an analyte in a biological sample, preferably less than about 2 minutes to about 40 seconds, and most preferably about 6 seconds to about 1 second.
      <br/>
      The subject high binding affinity MBP also provides a favorable cost of goods, and lower cost-per-assay since only small amounts of reagents and time are necessary to obtain an assay result.
      <br/>
      Shelf-life stability of the subject liquid and powdered compositions of the invention, often problematic in the diagnostics industry, was found to be excellent.
    </p>
    <p num="25">
      Embodiments of the invention provide diagnostic reagent solutions useful for detecting a murein compound in a biological sample according to one or more of the instant assays.
      <br/>
      Reagent solutions are optimized to facilitate specific binding interactions between the subject MBP and a murein ligand by choice of additives, buffers, stabilizers and the like.
      <br/>
      In one presently preferred embodiment, the subject reagent solutions were optimized for use in the instant assays by adding (i) non-polar solvents; and/or (ii) agents displacing water (e.g., polyethylene glycol, sucrose, and the like); and/or (iii) detergents (e.g., NP 40) to a pH balanced buffer salt solution (e.g., Na+, K+, Li+ and the like) of a MBP or MBP-SGC compound.
      <br/>
      MBP compounds having hydrophobic residues inserted into the MBP protein, or having ionically, hydrophobically, and covalently linked polyethylene (PEGylated) may exhibit increased murein binding activity.
    </p>
    <p num="26">
      Embodiments of the invention provide highly sensitive and specific non-antibody diagnostic MBP reagents reactive with a wide range of different bacteria and fungi.
      <br/>
      The subject reagents consist of one or more MBP, each capable of binding a murein compound present in a eubacteria, or a murein-like compound present in fungi and as the subject compounds are present in a killed, fixed and treated biological samples.
    </p>

      Embodiments of the invention also provide pan-bacterial and pan-fungal diagnostic reagents referred to herein as MBP-SGC conjugates, consisting of an MBP compound, preferably having a molecular size of about 55 kilodaltons (KD) to about 12 KD, most preferably about 35 KD to about 12 KD, that is linked through ionic, hydrophobic and covalent bonds to a signal generating compound (SGC.) The subject MBP-SGC conjugates have a high binding affinity for bacteria and fungi; a low catalytic activity for murein substrates as they appear in killed and denatured bacterial and fungal particles according to the instant ISBES methods; and, have a low binding affinity for degraded soluble bacterial and fungal cell wall products.
      <br/>
      The subject MBP-SGC conjugates, contain a non-antibody MBP that, unlike antibody reagents, does not contain an Fc portion capable of binding complement C1q, nor an antigen binding site capable of cross-reacting with related antigens, nor a molecular size of 135-150 KD, nor an antibody structure or charge distribution that can contribute to nonspecific electrostatic or hydrophobic binding interactions.

      Embodiments of the invention provide in-situ binding enzyme-substrate (ISBES) assay methods for detecting and/or quantifying bacteria and fungi in biological samples.
      <br/>
      The instant methods include a step of killing bacteria and/or fungi in a biological sample by treatment with a fixative, or alternatively, a chemical.
      <br/>
      The instant chemical treatment preferably is an alkaline treatment conducted at a temperature of about 20 (degree)  C. to about 100 (degree)  C., preferably about 37 (degree)  C. to about 100 (degree)  C. and most preferably at about 60 (degree)  C. to about 70 (degree)  C. The instant alkaline treatment is conducted using a solution of a base at a concentration and for a time effective to denature a bacterial or a fungal polypeptide.
      <br/>
      Representative examples of the instant fixatives include alcohol solutions such as ethanol, methanol and isopropanol, as well as aldehyde solutions such as formaldehyde, paraformaldehyde and glutaraldehyde.
      <br/>
      Representative examples of the instant chemical base solutions so useful include strong inorganic and organic bases such as about 0.5 M to about 5 M sodium hydroxide; about 0.5 M to about 3 M potassium hydroxide; 1 M to about 2.5 M ammonium hydroxide and the like.
      <br/>
      Preferably the chemical base solution is about 1 M to about 5 M sodium hydroxide, and most preferably about 2 M sodium hydroxide for use at the preferred and most treatment temperature and time (supra.) Illustrative concentrations and treatment times effective to denature a fungal or bacterial polypeptide are disclosed in the Examples section below. "Denature" is intended to mean disrupting secondary and tertiary polypeptide structure involved e.g. in protein folding.
      <br/>
      Methods for determining protein denaturation are known in the art and include at least comparative scanning spectrophotometry e.g., in the UV and near UV, molecular sieve chromatography, sucrose density gradient ultracentifugation, SDS-PAGE under non-denaturing conditions (e.g., Osborne gels) and the like.
      <br/>
      Times effective to denature a fungal or bacterial polypeptide are dependent upon the temperature, determinable by one or more of the subject methods, and will generally be in the range of about 2 minutes to about 30 minutes.
      <br/>
      The instant ISBES assay methods include assay formats in which detection or quantification of bacteria or fungi is conducted in-situ in fixed tissue samples by histochemistry; in samples of bodily fluids such as urine and blood by flow cytometry or by enzyme-linked solid phase methods, machine assay methods or latex dipstick methods; and, in food, air, water samples by dot-blot methods.
      <br/>
      It has been found that the instant step of using a fixative or a chemical base to effect denaturation of a bacterial or a fungal polypeptide, enables the optional use of either a natural murein-binding polypeptide (i.e., catalytically active and not genetically or chemically inactivated), or a catalytically disabled murein-binding polypeptide in the subject ISBES assay.
      <br/>
      Apparently, murein ligands in killed and denatured bacterial and fungal particles function as ligands for enzymatically active natural polypeptides but turnover of the subject substrates in the denatured particles is sufficiently slow to allow their use in certain ISBES assay formats.
      <br/>
      Those skilled in the art will recognize that comparative determinations can be made of natural and catalytically inactive murein-binding polypeptides in a test ISBES assay format, and that a determination can be made of whether the subject natural polypeptides has performance characteristics allowing its use in an assay, e.g. performance including specificity, sensitivity, precision, background, cross-reactivity with non-murein compounds and reproducibility.
      <br/>
      Catalytically disabled murein binding polypeptides are preferred for use in ISBES assay formats, as disclosed further below.
    </p>
    <p num="34">
      In optional embodiments, the instant ISBES assay methods include a step, i.e., conducted after the fixative or alkaline treatment, of washing the denatured biological sample to remove the fixative or chemical base, or neutralizing the base e.g. with HCl, and then treating with a solution of a protease, a glycosidase, a sialidase or a periodate.
      <br/>
      The subject second treatment step is effective to further reduce background non-specific signal generated in an ISBES assay and to increase accessibility of murein and murein-like compounds in bacterial and fungal cell wall for binding to the instant murein binding polypeptide reagents.
      <br/>
      One or more protease treatments hydrolyze bacterial and fungal cell surface proteins exposing murein and murein-like compounds, and at the same time degrade mammalian and plant compounds which might constitute background reactivity in an assay.
      <br/>
      Representative proteases solutions include trypsin at about 0.1% w/v to about 1% w/v, pronase at about 0.25% to about 2% w/v, subtilisin at about 0.05% to about 1% and the like.
      <br/>
      Preferably the protease solution is about 0.25% to about 1% trypsin.
      <br/>
      Glycosidases remove cell surface carbohydrates from bacterial and fungal cells, exposing mureins and murein-like compounds and degrading potential mammalian and plant cross-reacting materials which might contribute to background in an assay.
      <br/>
      Representative glycosidase solutions include both N- and O-glycosidases at concentrations of about 50  MU g/ml to about 10 mg/ml.
      <br/>
      Sialidases remove charged sialic acid from cell surface carbohydrates in mammalian and eubacterial and fungal cells.
      <br/>
      The resultant reduction in cell-surface charge may decrease non-specific background in an assay.
      <br/>
      Representative sialidases include commercially available N-acetyl neuraminidases from several sources (Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, Mo.) Periodate removes sugar residues at vicinal hydroxyl- groups, increases availability of murein-like compounds in fungi for binding to MBP, and decreases background reactivity with complex carbohydrates synthesized by mammalian cells, e.g., erythrocytes, leukocytes, tissue cells, tumor cells and the like.
      <br/>
      Representative periodate solutions include sodium periodate at a concentration of about 0.1% to about 1%.
      <br/>
      In yet other optional embodiments, the instant second treatment step may include sequential treatments with one or more chemical base, one or more protease, one or more glycosidase and/or the periodate, e.g., 1M KOH treatment followed by an optional protease treatment to expose murein and murein-like compounds in bacteria and fungi in histopathologic tissue sections collected from infected animals (i.e., man and domestic animals), as well as, for solubilizing potentially cross-reactive mammalian tissue materials.
    </p>
    <p num="35">
      In yet other optional embodiments, the instant ISBES assay methods include a step, i.e., conducted after the fixative or alkaline treatment or after the instant second step, of washing the denatured biological sample to remove any fixative, chemical base or second treatment step compound, and then treating with a solution of an anhydride effective to accomplish N-acetylation of carbohydrate compounds in the denatured bacterial or fungal particles.
      <br/>
      The subject N-acetylation step is effective to increase the sensitivity, e.g., number of bacteria or fungi required for identification or quantification, of an instant ISBES assay probably by increasing the binding of a murein-binding polypeptide with the a murein or murein-like compound in the subject killed and denatured fungal or bacterial particle.
      <br/>
      Most preferably, the means for N-acetylation consists of conditions suitable for N-acetylation of polysaccharides, e.g., in a suitable buffer pH 8.
      <br/>
      Representative examples of anhydride solutions so useful include about 2% (v/v) to about 5% (v/v) acetic anhydride in sodium bicarbonate buffer at pH 8, and about 0.2 M to about 0.5 M acetyl chloride in sodium bicarbonate buffer at pH 8.

      At binding affinities greater than 10-10 it may be difficult to measure binding by solid phase techniques since binding becomes relative irreversible, but alternative measurement methods such as equilibrium dialysis, or sucrose density gradient ultracentrifugation, i.e., using CsCl banded and sized cell wall fragments.
      <br/>
      Data obtained in these binding assays may be used to construct a Scatchard binding curve allowing determination of an association constant (Ka) that reflects the relative binding affinity of a MBP for a ligand.
      <br/>
      Preferably, the subject MBP have a binding affinity for diose, triose and tetraose bacterial and fungal cell wall compounds (e.g., chitatriose, (NAc-glucosamine)3, and the like) that is in the range of about 10-3 L/mol to about 10-5 L/mol; and, the subject compounds are effective to bind the subject murein or murein-like compound with a association constant (Ka) in the range of about 5 * 10-5 L/mol to about 10-9 L/mol, preferably 5 * 10-7 L/mol to 10-9 L/mol, and most preferably greater than 10-9 L/mol.
      <br/>
      The binding affinity of radiolabeled catalytically disable lysozyme to bacterial mureins covalently bound to CNBr-Sepharose-4B (Pharmacia) was greater than about 10-10 L/mol, i.e., the radiolabled MBP was not easily removed from the resin.

      "Catalytically inactive" murein binding polypeptide (or peptide) is intended to mean that the subject MBP is capable of binding a murein compound or a murein-like compound and it either completely lacks the ability to catalyze cleavage of any bond in the subject murein compound, or it has only about 5% to about 30% of the activity of a corresponding wild-type enzyme, preferably only about 10% to about 15% of wild-type enzyme activity, and most preferably less than about 10% of wild-type enzyme activity.

      Representative examples of catalytically inactive murein binding polypeptides are disclosed in EXAMPLE 1, below, and include at least recombinant, mutant, chemically modified, and chemically inactivated polypeptides that have murein binding capability but are catalytically inactive (as defined supra.)

      <br/>
      Preferably, the subject catalytic site amino acid residues, so modified, are those which are capable in a wild-type enzyme of participating in a catalytic exchange mechanism.

      Illustrative assays for determining catalytic activity are disclosed below (e.g., EXAMPLE 1.) In alternative embodiments, ISBES methods (supra) are provided for producing killed and denatured bacteria and fungal particles having murein ligands that may constitute good ligands but poor substrates.
      <br/>
      The subject ligands are properly reactive with certain wild-type enzymes, i.e., lysozyme and chitinase, so that these wild-type enzymes may be used according to the methods of the ISBES methods described supra and illustrated in the Examples section, below.

      "Non-interfering amino acid", as used herein, is intended to mean any amino acid that when introduced into an MBP does not interfere with binding of a murein ligand, but is effective to render the subject enzyme catalytically inactive.

      For example, non-interfering amino acids may be useful to alter the spacing between adjacent or distant chemical residues, or to change the electrostatic charge distribution, or hydrophobic properties of an enzyme catalytic active site.

In the latter case, the fragments of the MBP are also preferably purified substantially before use in the instant diagnostic reagents and assays, e.g., by reverse-phase HPLC or ligand-affinity chromatography, e.g. on a resin containing one or more covalently bound murein compounds.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, fragments of an MBP may be prepared by expressing e.g. in a recombinant host cell, a portion of a nucleotide sequence of a wild type (or mutant) genomic or cDNA clone capable of expressing the subject MBP.

      An MB peptide may be synthesized by any of a number of automated techniques that are now commonly available.
      <br/>
      Generally speaking, these techniques involve stepwise synthesis by successive additions of amino acids to produce progressively larger molecules.
      <br/>
      The amino acids are linked together by condensation between the carboxyl group of one amino acid and the amino group of another amino acid to form a peptide bond.
      <br/>
      To control these reactions, it is necessary to block the amino group of one amino acid and the carboxyl group of the other.
      <br/>
      The blocking groups should be selected for easy removal without adversely affecting the peptides, i.e., by racemization or by hydrolysis of the formed peptide bonds.
      <br/>
      Amino acids with carboxyl- groups (e.g., Asp, Glu) or hydroxyl- groups (e.g., Ser, homoserine, and tyrosine) also require blocking prior to condensation.
      <br/>
      A wide variety of procedures exist for synthesis of MB peptides, solid-phase synthesis usually being preferred.
      <br/>
      In this procedure an amino acid is bound to a resin particle, and the MB peptide generated in a stepwise manner by successive additions of protected amino acids to the growing chain.
      <br/>
      Modifications of the technique described by Merrifield are commonly used (Merrifield, R. B., J. Am. Chem. Soc., 96: 2989-2993, 1964.) In an exemplary automated solid-phase method, peptides are synthesized by loading the carboxy-terminal amino acid onto an organic linker (e.g., PAM, 4-oxymethyl phenylacetamidomethyl) covalently attached to an insoluble polystyrene resin that is cross-linked with divinyl benzene.
      <br/>
      Blocking with t-Boc is used to protect the terminal amine, and O-benzyl groups are used to block hydroxyl- and carboxyl-groups.
      <br/>
      Synthesis is preferably accomplished in an automated peptide synthesizer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, Calif.).
      <br/>
      Following synthesis, the product may be removed from the resin and blocking groups removed using hydrofluoric acid or trifluoromethyl sulfonic acid according to established methods (Bergot, B. J. and S. N. McCurdy, Applied Biosystems Bulletin, 1987.) A routine synthesis can produce 0.5 mmole of MB peptide-resin.
      <br/>
      Yield following cleavage and purification is approximately 60 to 70%.
      <br/>
      Purification of the product MB peptide is accomplished for example by (i) crystallizing the MB peptide from an organic solvent such as methyl-butyl ether, followed by dissolving in distilled water, and dialysis (if greater than about 500 molecular weight); or, by (ii) reverse HPLC (e.g., using a C18 column with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and acetonitrile as solvents) if less than 500 molecular weight.
      <br/>
      Purified MB peptide is commonly lyophilized and stored in a dry state until use.

      Knowledge of the amino acid sequence of a MB polypeptide (or MB peptide) (i.e., the sequence of amino acids and spatial distribution of amino acids in a sequence motif involved in murein binding permits construction of recombinant host cell expression systems (supra) wherein a cDNA (or genomic DNA) capable of encoding a wild type parental MBP (e.g., an enzyme) is modified (e.g., chemically or by site-directed mutagenesis) to produce a nucleotide sequence capable of encoding a recombinant catalytically inactive MBP.
      <br/>
      A representative example of the subject modification of a cDNA is disclosed in EXAMPLE 1, below.
      <br/>
      For site-directed mutagenesis complementary oligonucleotides may be synthesized, or restriction fragments may be produced and chemically modified, in either case, the methods are available in the art.
      <br/>
      Incorporation of modified cDNAs (or gDNAs) into bacteria, yeast, and insect plasmid DNAs, as well as into mammalian cell viral vectors (e.g., retroviral vectors) may also be accomplished using techniques available in the art.
      <br/>
      Host cell expression systems that may be useful for producing MBP compounds include at least prokaryotic, eukaryotic, yeast, and insect cells.
      <br/>
      In one presently preferred embodiment, the cellular expression system contains a tandem repeat from a sequence capable of coding for the subject MBP and 1 mole of the expressed protein product of the coding sequence is cleavable by cyanogen to yield about 2 mole of the subject MBP protein.

      <br/>
      For example, modification of an MBP may include: (a) covalently modification, e.g. by adenylation, methylation, esterification, acylation, acetylation, phosphorylation, uridylation, fatty-acylation, glycosylation, and the like; (b) stereoisomerization, e.g., replacing a D-amino acid with an L-stereoisomer e.g. during solid phase synthesis; (c) derivatization, wherein one amino acid is substituted for another of like properties by a series of chemical modifications or during solid phase synthesis, i.e., substitution of one neutral polar amino acid for another neutral polar amino acid (e.g., G A, V, I, L, F, P, or M); or, substitution of a neutral nonpolar amino acid for another neutral nonpolar amino acid (e.g., S, T, Y, W, N, Q, or C.); or, substitution of an acidic amino acid for another acid (e.g., D or E), or a basic amino acid for another (e.g., K, R, or H); or, (d) chemically modification, e.g., converting an active site carboxyl group to a carbonyl or aldehyde, or converting an amine to an amide, or introducing a side chain at an active site residue e.g. Sar or gamma-amino butyric acid (GABA); or, (e) chemical coupling, e.g., covalently coupling one active site residue to another residue using e.g. a heterobifunctional cross-linking reagent (Pierce Chemical Co.); (f) or, chemical coupling to accomplish an N- or C-terminal extension (e.g. for an MB peptide); or, (g) replacing one amino acid with another of slightly different properties e.g., to change hydrophobicity of a peptide.

      <br/>
      Chimeric MBP compounds containing multiple copies of two or more different MBP may combine advantageous properties of two different MBP molecules into a single molecule (e.g., combining MBPs having two different anomeric or stereo specificities; or, combining an MBP having specificity for a murein oligopeptide side chain with an MBP having specificity for sugar residues in a glycosyl chain); or, to increase the binding affinity of the subject MB-polypeptides to a ligand through cooperative binding interaction between the respective different respective binding sites within the resultant chimeric molecule.
      <br/>
      In one representative example, lysozyme is coupled to a chitinase to increase MBP binding affinity and broaden ligand binding specificity, as well as, to improve biochemical properties such as hydrophobicity and/or thermal stability.
      <br/>
      In another representative example, a bifunctional murein binding polypeptide consists of a portion of a lysozyme covalently coupled to a portion of a transglycosylase.

      The instant murein-binding assay methods include those having a step effective to simultaneously accomplish binding and signal generation as an analyte binds to an MBP, i.e., a "simultaneous" or "homogeneous" assay format.

      The instant methods also include "heterogeneous" murein-binding assay formats, including one or more steps for separating a "bound" from a free analyte and then generating a signal.

      The instant methods also include those having a step in which analyte is added to compete with the binding of a labeled ligand to an MBP, i.e., a competitive binding (or indirect) assay format, or alternatively, in which binding of an analyte to a MBP is detected by adding a second MBP having signal generating compound, i.e., a non-competitive (or direct) assay format.
      <br/>
      Illustrative methods for separating "bound" analyte, ligand or MBP from "free" include filtration, and column separation , magnetic separation , as well as attaching one or more of the reactants to a solid phase .

      Illustrative murein-binding assay methods for detecting a signal generating compound commonly include: using an enzyme as a SGC that converts a substrate to a visually or spectrophotometrically identifiable product), or alternatively, exciting a fluorescent SGC coupled to an MBP so that a detectable signal is emitted, e.g. at a different wavelength, e.g. fluorimetric analysis.

      The instant flow cytometric assays may be conducted with or without size discrimination (e.g., based on light scatter measurements); with or without a second dye indicator (e.g., propitium iodide, FITC, F-NHS, RITC, and the like); and, with or without quantification (e.g., counting the number of particles positive in the assay for binding of the subject murein binding polypeptide (peptide) conjugates.

      Particle counting may be used to quantify the number analyte particles binding an MBP-conjugate.

      The preferred pretreatment step decreases the viscosity in a sample; or, to increases the solubility of the sample (e.g. a lung lavage, sputum or urine sample); or, to denature endogenous lysozymes or chitinases that can constitute confounding or interfering substances in an assay; or, to inactivate bacterial and fungal cell wall compounds that can constitute background interfering substances in an assay; or, to increase exposure and accessibility of a murein- or murein-like compound in a biological sample for binding by an MBP.

The subject treatment is preferably conducted for about 2 minutes to about 30 minutes, preferably about 10 minutes to about 30 minutes, and most preferably about 20 minutes to about 30 minutes.
      <br/>
      Preferably, the shorter incubation times, i.e., about 2 minutes to about 9 minutes, and/or lower temperatures, i.e., less than 45 (degree)  C., are conducted with about 2M to about 5 M of a strong base solution, e.g. sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, ammonium hydroxide, barium hydroxide, calcium hydroxide, potassium carbonate, sodium carbonate, potassium acetate and sodium barbital and like.

      Preferably, intermediate incubation times, i.e., about 10 minutes to about 14 minutes, are conducted with about 0.2 M to about 3.5 M concentrations of a strong base, e.g., KOH, NaOH and the like.

      Preferably, the longer incubation times, i.e., about 15 minutes to about 30 minutes, are conducted with about 0.2M to about 2M concentrations of a strong base, e.g., KOH, NaOH and the like.

      In all cases, the subject treatment is capable of killing bacteria and fungi, hydrolyzing a test bacterial or fungal polypeptide (supra), and producing killed and denatured bacterial and/or fungal particles containing ligands reactive with the instant MBP compounds.
      <br/>
      Following alkaline treatment(s), a subject urine sediment sample is then optionally washed, neutralized (e.g., using an HCl solution), and/or optionally treated with one or more of a protease, a glycosidase, a sialidase and/or a periodate.
      <br/>
      Most preferably, following alkaline treatment and/or any optional treatment, the subject urine sediment sample is treated with an acetylation solution capable of effecting N-acetylation of sugar residues in the sample.

      Representative N-acetylation solutions so capable, include solutions of pure acetic anhydride at final concentrations of about 0.8% (v/v) to about 5% (v/v), preferably about 1% (v/v) to about 4% (v/v), and most preferably about 2% (v/v) to about 5% (v/v); also, solutions of acetyl chloride at about 2M to about 5M; and solutions of acetylation reagents capable of achieving like effects without destroying the integrity of a killed and denatured yeast particle.

      The combined subject treatments were effective to produce single particle suspensions of killed and denatured fungal cells suitable for use with lysozyme-fluorophore conjugates wherein the presence and number of the particles were determined by counting in a flourescence flow cytometer.
      <br/>
      Other features of the instant murein-binding assay formats are disclosed below.
    </p>
    <p num="95">"Uniform assay format" is intended to mean that the molecule capable of capturing (e.g., MBP -1) a bacterial murein, e.g., on a solid phase, and the molecule capable of detecting the captured bacterial murein (i.e., MBP -2) are the same non-antibody MBP, e.g., MBP-1 and MBP-2 (TABLE 4, above, are both lysozyme.) It is intended within this definition that different forms of the non-antibody MBP (as defined by MBP-1, MBP-2, and MBP-3, supra) may be used for the capture reagent and the detect reagent, i.e., lysozyme polypeptide as MBP-1 and a lysozyme fragment-SGC as MBP-2.</p>
    <p num="96">"Mixed assay format" is intended to mean that in a first step of the assay the molecule capable of capturing a murein compound is different than the molecule capable of detecting the captured murein in a second step, e.g., non-antibody MBP in the first step, (e.g., MBP-1-3, TABLE 4) and a lectin- or antibiotic-MBP (i.e., capable of binding the respective MBP) in the second step (e.g., BP-1-3, TABLE 4.)</p>
    <p num="97">
      In other alternative embodiments the invention provides mixed assay formats in which a MBP is used as a `capture` (e.g., MBP-3; TABLE 4) and an antibody-conjugate specific for the MBP or for the captured murein compound is used as a `detect` (e.g., BP-3, TABLE 4.) The capture reagent may alternatively consist of an antibody and the detect reagent an MBP-SGC conjugate.
      <br/>
      Polyclonal and monoclonal antibody reagents specific for a murein, or MBP, may be prepared by standard methods, including (if necessary) conjugating the subject murein to a carrier (e.g., KLH or BSA) to increase its immunogenicity.
    </p>
    <p num="98">
      In one presently most preferably mixed assay format embodiment antibodies are specifically reactive with an MBP, rather than with a murein compound.

No. 4,596,769, (resulting from immunization of mice with bacteria and bacterial cell wall fractions; column 4, lines 39-42), were tested and not found useful in the instant assays because of high background binding to non-bacterial and fungal materials in biological samples.
      <br/>
      In the latter case, background nonspecific binding may perhaps result from cross-reactivity (i.e., at the antigen binding site); or, binding of compounds to the Fc portion of the antibody (e.g., the C1q complement collagen-motif binding site); or, nonspecific binding to immunoglobulins involving e.g. electrostatic or hydrophobic forces.

      <br/>
      The instant detect reagents contain one or more signal generating compounds conjugated to an MBP.
      <br/>
      Representative methods for covalently linking SGC to MBP include those using hetero-bifunctional cross-linking reagents that are reactive with carbonyl, aldehyde, carboxyl, amino, disulfide and thiol groups of amino acids, e.g., carbodiimide, N-hydroxy succinimide, N-succinimidyl-3-(2-pyridyldithio)propionate (SPDP), maleimide, succinimidyl-pyridylthioproprionate, m-maleimidobenzoyl N-hydroxysuccinimide ester, succinimidyl pyridylthiopropionate, and the like.
      <br/>
      Methods for linking SGC fluorophores to MBP include, e.g., encouraging electrostatic interactions of the subject MBP with the fluorophore by placing the MBP in a buffer having a pH below its isoelectric point (e.g., pH 2.5-3).
      <br/>
      An illustrative method for linking a fluorophore to MBP is disclosed (EXAMPLE 2, below.) Methods suitable for linking phycobiliproteins to MBP are disclosed in Stryer et al. (U.S. Pat. No. 5,055,556).

      The subject buffer solutions may include additives (e.g., stabilizers), emulsifiers (e.g., detergents), and the like for preserving the activity of the instant MBP-conjugate during storage; or, for promoting the binding activity of the instant MBP for a murein ligand or analyte in a murein-binding assay of the invention.

      In a second representative example of a murein-binding assay according to the instant invention, a quantitative simultaneous competitive ELMBSA includes the steps of: (i) coating a solid phase with one or more murein compounds (e.g. bacterial or fungal cell wall fragments); (ii) in a separate container mixing a predetermined amount of an MBP-SGC conjugate with an aliquot of a biological sample for a time sufficient to establish a binding interaction between the MBP-SGC (i.e., an enzyme SGC) and any analyte that may be present in the sample; (iii) adding the analyte/MBP-SGC mixture to the murein-coated solid phase; (iv) determining the amount of MBP-SGC conjugate available for binding to the solid-phase murein coating by separating the analyte/MBP-SGC mixture from the solid phase, e.g. washing to remove unbound analyte-MBP-SGC; and then, (v) incubating the separated solid phase with an enzyme substrate to detect the presence and/or amount of the MBP-SGC-enzyme bound to the murein-solid phase.

      Two resultant mutant lysozyme enzymes were identified, i.e., one having Asp converted to Asn, i.e., D52N, and the second having Glu converted to Gln, i.e., E35Q. The D52N mutant enzyme reportedly exhibited less than 5% of the wild-type catalytic activity against Micrococcus luteus cell wall substrate while retaining some binding affinity for chitotriose (GlcNAc)3. E35Q exhibited no measurable enzyme activity (i.e., less than 0.1.+- 0 (slashed zero) 1% of wild type) but also still bound substrate.

      Most proteins do not contain free sulfhydryls, but this is not the case for the N68C/A93C T4-lysozyme mutant described above, with free Cys68 and Cys93.
      <br/>
      In addition, disulfide cross-linked in inter- or intramolecular bonds in polypeptides are often susceptible to mild reduction (i.e., using 1-20 mM dithiotreitol; DTT) creating one or more reactive sulfhydryl residues, without loss of binding site affinity for a ligand.
      <br/>
      In either case, lysozyme free sulfhydryl groups are reactive with MBS (m-Maleimidobenzoyl-N-hydroxysuccinimide ester) cross-linking agent.
      <br/>
      In one example, a reactive sulfhydryl in HRP is generated by reacting free amino groups with SPDP (N-succinimidyl-3-(2-pyridyldithio)propionate).
      <br/>
      Mild reduction of SPDP removes the pyridyl group exposing a reactive sulfhydryl.
      <br/>
      Conjugation between MBS-MBP and SPDP-HRP is accomplished by reducing (i.e., with DTT) then mixing the compounds under conditions favorable for disulfide bond formation.

      The extent of coupling is determined by taking a 50-100 MU l aliquot of SPDP-HRP, diluting to 1 ml with distilled water and measuring the absorbance at 403 nm and 343 nm against a distilled water blank.
      <br/>
      The amount of 2-pyridyl sulfone released from the test sample is used to quantify the extent of conjugation.

      To this end, DTT is added to a final concentration of 25 mM and the absorbance at 343 nm is read again after about 5 minutes.
      <br/>
      The difference in absorbance before and after addition of DTT represents the amount of 2-pyridyl sulfone released and is stoichiometrically related to the total amount of 2-pyridyl disulfide bound to the HRP in the test sample.

The conditions for alkaline treatment of the urine sediment sample were found to be crucial to obtaining uniform suspensions of killed and denatured particles, and in turn, for obtaining meaningful results in cytometric particle counting assays.

      First, to exclude counting of monomeric beads the lower detection limit of a cytometer (i.e., Coulter Instruments) is set to greater than 0.5 MU . using 0.5 MU  calibration beads.
      <br/>
      Next, measured dilutions of the incubation mixture containing bacteria or fungi bound in multimeric detection beads, is gently vortexed to create a uniform suspension and then introduced into the flow cytometer.
      <br/>
      Multimers having diameters greater than 0.5  MU  are counted, and the number of such particles is an indication of the presence, or amount, of bacterial contamination in a biological sample, or the severity of infection in an animal.

      Endogenous murein binding polypeptides in bacterial cell wall were detected using an antibiotic-SGC conjugate, i.e., ampicillin chemically bonded through its free amino group to F-NHS.
      <br/>
      Briefly, ampicillin was mixed with F-NHS (Pierce Chemical Co.) according to methods described supra in regards to preparation of F-NHS-lysozyme.
      <br/>
      Since only one free amino group was available for binding, the stoicheometry of binding was 1:1.

      Antibiotic-SGC conjugate was separated from free F-NHS and free antibiotic on a P2 sizing column, i.e., the conjugate was about twice the size of the free antibiotic.
      <br/>
      The F-NHS-ampicillin was used to stain endogenous peptidyl transferases in the cell walls of bacteria (i.e., E. coli) and fungi (i.e., Candida albicans) and stained bacterial and fungal cells were detected using flow cytofluorimetry and microscopy.
      <br/>
      Because of its small molecular size F-NHS-ampicillin was able to stain viable bacteria and fungi, as well as killed and denatured bacteria and fungi.

    <p num="187">Enzyme Linked Murein Binding Assay: ELMBA Solid Phase Sandwich Assay</p>
    <p num="188">
      Murein binding polypeptide (MBP) capture reagent, in this case catalytically inactive hen egg white lysozyme from EXAMPLE 1 (above), is dissolved immediately before use in 0.05 M sodium carbonate buffer, pH 9.6 to achieve a final concentration of about 100  MU g/ml.
      <br/>
      A solid phase (supra) is coated with MBP by adding 100  MU l of the MBP-capture carbonate solution to each well in a 96 well microtiter plate (ELISA standard polystyrene; Nunc Inc. or Immulon-II, Dynatech Inc.).
      <br/>
      After coating the plates at 4 (degree)  C. for 16-20 hours, unbound MBP is removed by washing 4-6 times with 00.1M sodium phosphate buffer (PBS), pH 7.0 containing 0.5% Tween 20 (PBS/Tween).
      <br/>
      Unbound sites on the polystyrene are blocked by adding PBS, pH 7.0 containing 10 mg/ml of bovine serum albumin (BSA) and 0.5% Tween-20 (Blocking Buffer), and incubating for 3-4 hours at room temperature.
      <br/>
      Blocking buffer is removed by washing with PBS/Tween and the microtiter plates are covered and stored at 4 (degree)  C. until use. Test samples of biological fluid, i.e., a urine sediment sample (supra), are prepared as serial dilutions in PBS, pH 7.0 and 100  MU l of each dilution is added to a well of the coated microtiter plate containing the bound MBP.
      <br/>
      Binding between the MBP and any bacterial murein, or fungal murein-like, analyte in the test sample is allowed to continue for 45 minutes to 1 hour at room temperature, and then unbound materials are removed by washing 4-6 times with PBS/Tween.
      <br/>
      Bound murein, or murein-like, analyte is detected stepwise: first, by adding 100  MU l/well of a detect reagent HRP-lysozyme-conjugate (EXAMPLE 3, above) dissolved in PBS, pH 7 0 (slashed zero)  The reaction between the detect reagent and the bound-analyte is allowed to continue at room temperature for 30-90 minutes and unbound detect reagent is next removed by washing with PBS/Tween, followed by PBS.
      <br/>
      Second, the bound detect reagent is visualized by adding 100  MU l of a colorimetric substrate for HRP, i.e., a solution of ABTS (2,2'-azino-di(3-ethylbenzthiazoline sulfonic acid) at a concentration of 0.16 mg/ml in PBS, pH 6.0 and containing 0.0004% (freshly prepared) hydrogen peroxide.
      <br/>
      Visible color development is allowed to continue for 10-60 minutes, and absorbance is quantified spectrophotometrically at 405 nm (i.e., in an ELISA plate reader).
      <br/>
      Third, the results are quantified by comparing the absorbance recorded with the absorbance produced by measured amounts of murein ligand standards run in parallel, i.e., in other wells of the MBP-capture microtiter plate during the assay of the test substance.
      <br/>
      The absorbance produced by the standards is used to construct a standard curve, and the absorbance value for the test sample may be compared with the standard curve to determine the bacterial-equivalents of a murein, or murein-like, ligand in the sample.
      <br/>
      The results, may be used to set acceptable cut-off values of reactivity for "normal" in the assay, e.g., an "infection" may indicated if a value obtained with a test sample from an individual is more than one standard deviations greater than a mean background value recorded with a panel of sample from normal healthy individuals.
      <br/>
      Individual cut-off values may also be indicated for different clinical grades (severity's) of infection.

      <br/>
      The aliquots are each subject to pressure filtration (e.g., applied by a syringe) through a separate portion (i.e., a "dot") of the MBP-coated-filter (supra).

    <p num="197">Diagnostic Assay for Fungal Infections</p>
    <p num="198">The following example illustrates the instant diagnostic methods as used to rapidly identify a bacterial or a fungal infection; or, to rapidly differentiate between a bacterial and a fungal infection in a host in need thereof; or, to quantify the severity of a fungal infection in a patient in need thereof, e.g. a urinary tract infection.</p>
    <p num="199">Urinary Tract Infections:</p>
    <p num="200">
      Urinary tract infections (UTI) include urethritis (infection of the urethra), cystitis (bladder infection) and pyelonephritis (kidney infection.) Bacteria and fungi are common etiologic agents in UTI.
      <br/>
      Most bacterial infections are E. coli, Klebsiella or Proteus and fungal infections are yeast of the genus Candida (e.g., C. albicans, C. kruzei, C. glabrata, C. tropicalis and the like) and fungi of the genus Torulopsis (e.g., T. glabrata) and Trichosporon (e.g., T. beigelii.) There are great differences in the assay sensitivity required to detect bacterial or fungal infection.
      <br/>
      For instance, threshold for UTI for bacterial infection is considered to be greater than about 105 colony forming units (CFU), as contrasted with only about 1000 CFU/ml urine to confirm a yeast infection.
      <br/>
      Most antibiotic treatment is initiated before, or without, identification of the etiologic agent because several days are usually required to culture the bacteria or fungi responsible.
      <br/>
      Widespread use of antibiotics has favored emergence of antibiotic resistant bacteria and fungi, and the growing prevalence of resistant microbes (particularly in the clinical environment) has complicated treatment of patients.
      <br/>
      Among patients with fever and pyuria unresponsive to antibiotics the mortality rate is presently greater than 30%.
      <br/>
      In addition, several patient groups are at an increased risk of developing life-threatening ascending infections capable of developing into kidney and/or systemic infections: namely, immunocompromised patients (e.g., transplant, cancer patients, AIDS patients) including patients treated with immunosupppressive drugs (e.g., patients with autoimmune diseases such as IDDM, SLE, RA); indigent, elderly and diabetic patients; and, hospitalized patients (e.g., nosocomial infection, prostate disorders, pregnant women.) As a means for reducing costs, managed healthcare will eventually mandate early diagnosis and use of methods for distinguishing at an early stage between bacterial and fungal UTI infections.
    </p>
    <p num="201">Clinical Diagnostics Laboratorv Testing:</p>
    <p num="202">
      Current methods of plate culture and microscopic examination are too slow (i.e., days) to provide information useful in deciding treatment, and instead are used, (after the fact), to confirm bacterial, and/or fungal, infection.
      <br/>
      Current microscopic wet mount and/or plate culture methods are used to identify yeast in urine sediments.
      <br/>
      For detection by microscopic examination, more than 1000 colony forming units of yeast per milliliter of urine may be required; and, for detection by culture, 2 or more days may be required since yeast are relatively slow growing.
      <br/>
      As a result, false-negative test results and uncertainty are common.
      <br/>
      Alternative methods such as ELISA, calcofluor and PCR are expensive, slow, not easily automated, not pan-fungal reactive, often reactive with mammalian cell elements and bacteria, and have high background non-specific reactivity with non-fungal particulate matter (e.g., cotton lint).
      <br/>
      Performing these assays also commonly requires specially trained personnel.
      <br/>
      Existing techniques also do not commonly aid the physician to identify or determine a severity of infection or provide information useful in deciding whether to treat with an aggressive course of high-dose antibiotic therapy.
    </p>
    <p num="203">Current Limitations to Flow Cytometry Methods</p>
    <p num="204">
      Flow cytometry has limitations when used for automated counting of infectious microorganisms including: high background counting of non-microbial particles; the small numbers of microorganisms present (e.g., &lt;1000 cells/ml yeast) necessitating long counting times at the lower limits of machine counting.
      <br/>
      For a 10 ml urine sample, it is preferable to count about 7,000-10,000 cells to diagnose a yeast UTI, but using e.g. a urine sediment sample of 500  MU l, counting at 20 cells per second at a flow rate of 60  MU l/minute may require 6-7 minutes per sample to record this number of cells.
      <br/>
      As a further complication for cytometric counting, it was discovered that bacteria and fungi in urine tend to aggregate and form into clumps, rafts and aggregates which may be commingled with mammalian cell debris in the samples (FIG. 2A.)
    </p>
    <p num="205">FIG. 2A shows a fluorescence photomicrograph of staining of yeast clusters and aggregates observed when Candida albicans was added to normal urine sediment and stained with F-NHS-catalytically disabled lysozyme.</p>
    <p num="206">
      Filamentous fungi also grow in chains or hyphae that are not conducive to counting by cytometric methods.
      <br/>
      Due to these combined confounding properties, particle counting methods may often under-estimate the actual numbers of cells by more than 5-10 fold.
      <br/>
      Similarly, culture methods may under-estimate the numbers of fungi by at least 2-3 fold because many yeast colonies originate from cell clusters (Perfect, 1991.)
    </p>
    <p num="207">The Instant Assay Methods: Summary Overview</p>
    <p num="208">Since biological samples from infected individuals contain bacterial and fungal aggregates, as well as, `confounding` and `interfering` substances (supra), i.e., murein binding compounds such as endogenous chitinases and lysozymes attempts were made to produce single cell fungal and bacterial suspensions by combinations of acid and/or base hydrolysis and protease treatment.</p>
    <p num="209">
      As detect compounds, F-NHS-labeled catalytically-disabled lysozyme (i.e., Preparation -1 supra) and F-NHS-lysozyme and were prepared according to EXAMPLE 1 and comparisons were made of their effectiveness for detection of alkaline and/or protease killed and denatured bacteria and fungi by flow cytometry.
      <br/>
      Most pathogenic fungi contain chitin in their cell walls, septa and spores, both in hyphal and yeast forms.
      <br/>
      Chitin is a  BETA 1 --&gt; 4 linked linear polymer of 2-deoxy-2-acetamidoglucose (N-acetyl glucosamine, GlcNAc.) Fungi do not contain bacterial murein proteoglycans and chitin is a poor substrate for lysozymes with hydrolysis of chitins proceeding at a much slower rate than mureins.
      <br/>
      Similarly, bacteria do not contain chitin and are not reactive with chitinase.
    </p>
    <p num="210">
      Surprisingly, using fluorescence microscopy and Candida albicans as a test fungi, F-NHS-labeled catalytically-disabled lysozyme and F-NHS-lysozyme both stained yeast cells, and much more brightly than the staining that could be achieved using a chitin-specific binding protein, i.e., chitin glycosyl hydrolase-F-NHS conjugate.
      <br/>
      Neither F-NHS-labeled conjugate stained mammalian or plant cells or their products.
      <br/>
      Also surprisingly, under the conditions of use, staining of bacteria in urine sediments was not as easily detectable as staining of fungi, i.e., because of their size.
      <br/>
      In other words, under the conditions of use in cytofluorimetric assays the method was able to selectively distinguish between the presence of bacteria and/or fungi in a test sample.
      <br/>
      Fluorescence labeling of Candida by both the F-NHS-catalytically disabled lysozyme and the F-NHS-lysozyme depended upon the preparative method (supra) used to prepare a biological sample for analysis.
      <br/>
      Fluorescence signal generation was markedly greater, i.e., as measured by fluorescence intensity in fluorescence cytoinetry, when a test Candida yeast in a urine sediment was subject to alkaline denaturation followed by N-acetylation, but not O-acetylation.
      <br/>
      While not wishing to be tied to any particular mechanism of action, but by way of possible explanation, lysozyme binding specificity for yeast cells may require the presence of murein-like compounds and lysozymes may not effectively bind chitosans in a fungal cell wall with sufficient affinity to generate a signal in the assay.
      <br/>
      Chitosan is present as a natural cell wall material in fungi, or as a possible result from deacetylation following alkaline treatment procedures (supra).
      <br/>
      Chitosan may be converted to murein-like compounds by N-acetylation (supra.) In different experiments, the conditions suitable for N-acetylation, without destroying the killed and denatured yeast particles in urine sediments, were found to be treatments at a final dilution of about 1/20-1/40 acetic anhydride (i.e., 5-10  MU l for 200  MU l to 300  MU l total sample volume; about 1-10% acetic anhydride final concentration); using chemically pure acetic anhydride (e.g., distilled to remove acetic acid); and, in a saturated solution of NaHCO3 at pH 8.0 for 15-30 minutes at room temperature.
      <br/>
      Using the combination of both alkaline hydrolysis and N-acetylation the killed and denatured yeast or bacterial particles in the treated urine sediment were fully reactive with the lysozyme F-NHS-conjugate (EXAMPLE 1, Preparation -1, supra).
      <br/>
      In the absence of an alkaline treatment the signal was dramatically reduced.
      <br/>
      Protease treatment did not increase the signal of a sample exposed to both treatments, but it did increase the signal of a sample with fungal aggregates and subject to only the alkaline treatment.
      <br/>
      However, periodate oxidation (i.e., increasing the number of free sugar residues available for acetylation) followed by acetylation did increase signal strength in certain samples.
    </p>
    <p num="211">
      In comparative studies, killed and denatured fungi in alkaline- and N-acetylation-treated urine samples were as reactive with F-NHS-lysozyme as with the catalytically disabled lysozyme conjugate (Preparation -1, EXAMPLE 1, above.) The mechanism responsible is at present unknown.
      <br/>
      The treatment method seems to produce killed and denatured fungal particles that contain substrates for catalytically active lysozyme conjugates, but, substrate turnover in the particles seems to be at a reduced rate, or turnover may not result in release of substantial free enzyme following the catalytic reaction.
    </p>
    <p num="212">First Illustrative Urine Sediment Sample Treatment Protocol:</p>
    <p num="213">
      One to ten milliliters of urine was centrifuged at 3000 rpm in a clinical centrifuge at room temperature (i.e., 22 (degree)  C.) for 10 minutes.
      <br/>
      The urine sediment was resuspended in 100  MU l 2N NaOH and subject to hydrolysis for about 15-30 minutes at 60 (degree)  C. to kill bacteria and fungi; to hydrolyze and denature polypeptides and cell wall fragments; to expose murein- and murein-like-compounds in the particles; to alkylate cell surface charged residues involved in aggregation; and, to disaggregate bacterial or fungal rafts, aggregates and cell clumps without lysing cells.
      <br/>
      Following alkaline treatment, the killed and denatured particulate suspension was brought to neutrality by adding 30  MU l of 6N HCl and setting it aside at room temperature for 10 minutes.
      <br/>
      If aggregates, rafts or clumps of particles remained, the denatured cellular proteins in the particles were subject to an optional step of enzymatic hydrolysis, i.e., protease treatment with 0.25% trypsin for 30 minutes at 37 (degree)  C. in a volume of about 100  MU l PBS, pH 7 0 (slashed zero)  The chemical treatment alone was usually sufficient to hydrolyze bacterial and fungal intracellular adhesins; degrade potentially confusing polypeptides (e.g., endogenous chitinases, lysozymes and the like); degrade most potentially interfering substances (e.g., mammalian cells, bacterial cells, bacterial cell wall fragments, fungal cell wall fragments and the like); degrade fungal casts (e.g., releasing cells from hyphae); and release individual fungal cells from rafts, clumps, aggregates and the like.
      <br/>
      To increase the reactivity of murein- and murein-like compounds with MBP, i.e. lysozyme, the killed and denatured particles were subject to N-acetylation by adding 100  MU l saturated NaHCO3, pH 8, followed by 5-10  MU l of pure (redistilled) acetic anhydride, i.e., final concentration in the assay of about 2-5% (v/v.) (N-acetylation was used to convert chitosan and other fungal compounds into more murein-like compounds reactive with MBP.) After 2-10 minutes at room temperature 100  MU l of PBS, pH 7.0 was added, followed by 100  MU l of PBS-5% BSA, pH 7.0, i.e., bringing the total volume to about 400-500  MU l. The particles were detected by adding 30-40  MU l of a solution of F-NHS-lysozyme (4-8 mg/ml), and by incubating for 15-30 minutes to effect binding of the MBP to the particles before microscopic examination in a fluorescence microscope or counting in a cytofluorimeter (i.e., FAXSCAN, Becton Dickinson Inc.) Cytofluorimetric counting was at a rate of about 5,000-9,000 killed and denatured particles per second and requiring about 2-30 seconds to count a total of 10,000-20,000 particles.
      <br/>
      The uniformity of the dispersed cells following this sample treatment protocol is illustrated in the fluorescence photomicrograph presented in FIG. 2B, which was prepared from a normal urine sediment sample to which a suspension of Candida albicans had been added.
      <br/>
      As illustrated in FIG. 2B, most yeast forms were present either in single or budding double cell forms, with only about one visible aggregate, clump or raft of cells per 10 visual fields.
    </p>
    <p num="214">
      FIG. 2B shows a photomicrograph of fluorescence staining of Candida albicans grown for 48 hrs./37 (degree)  C. on Sabouraud dextrose agar and then added to normal urine sediment, treated with alkaline treatments (supra), stained with F-NHS-labeled catalytically-disabled lysozyme prepared according to EXAMPLE 1, above (i.e., Preparation -1), and examined as a wet mount using fluorescence microscopy.
      <br/>
      Most yeast forms stained were either single cell or budding double cell organisms with aggregates reduced to only one in every 10 microscopic visual fields.

      For rapid cytometric analysis, this chemical sample pretreatment protocol was found to be crucial.
      <br/>
      In FIG. 2C, is shown a plot of fluorescence intensity (x axis; FSC-H/FSC-Height) against particle size (y axis; SSC-H/SSC-Height) for a urine sediment collected from a normal (healthy) subject, (i.e., without bacteria or yeast particles), and subject to the chemical treatment protocol disclosed above.
      <br/>
      The circle labeled "YG" in FIGS. 2C and 2F indicates the region where fluorescent yeast particles, if present, would appear, i.e., referred to herein as the "yeast gate".
      <br/>
      After cytometry counting, the data was subject to computerized selection and sorting process using Candida albicans as a positive control and normal human urine sediment particles as a negative control.
      <br/>
      The selection process involved sorting the data for those data points having a particle size and a fluorescence intensity that corresponded visually (i.e., by screen display) with the size and fluorescence intensity for the positive yeast particle control while excluding the majority of the negative control urine sediment particles.
      <br/>
      In FIG. 2D, is shown an aliquot of the same urine sediment without the chemical treatment, i.e., urine sediment particles populate the yeast gate, and if yeast were present in the latter situation, they would not be distinguishable from the urine residue particles based on size and fluorescence intensity, as shown from the data presented in FIG. 2E. In FIG. 2E, is shown another aliquot of the same urine sediment to which a suspension of Candida albicans was added.

      The sample was not subjected to chemical treatment and the added yeast and urine particles have similar size distribution and both populate the `yeast gate`. In FIG. 2F, is shown an aliquot of the same urine sample, with Candida albicans added, and after the instant chemical treatment, i.e., yeast populate the `yeast gate` and are separated from other urine sediment particles.

      The experiment was designed to evaluate only the steps of alkaline treatment and F-NHS-lysozyme staining, i.e., without N-acetylation and/or protease treatments.

      FIG. 2G shows the background in a control sample from unstained and untreated yeast particles (i.e., the sample background without chemical treatment.) FIG. 2H depicts the control data collected with unstained untreated aggregated yeast particles in buffer, rather than with urine sediment (i.e., the yeast background).

      The F-NHS-lysozyme stained sample shows two relatively poorly resolved peaks of fluorescence staining, perhaps relating to the presence of doublet and singlet yeast forms in the sample.

      To evaluate the combined advantages of alkaline treatment, acetylation and sorting data for particles conforming with a `yeast gate` (supra), Candida albicans was again used as a test fungi.
      <br/>
      Different numbers of yeast cells, in suspension, were added to aliquots samples of normal human urine, and the samples subject to sedimentation and alkaline and acetylation treatments (supra.) Urine samples were stained by reacting for 10, 15, 20 and 30 minutes at 37 (degree)  C. with 0.01-1 mg/ml of F-NHS-catalytically disabled lysozyme (Preparation -1, above) or of F-NHS-lysozyme (i.e., wild-type enzyme conjugate, supra) and then aliquots were subject to analysis by flow cytometric analysis in a fluorescence cytometer (Beckton Dickinson Model LSYS II) at a flow rate of 1.0  MU l/second and sufficient particles were commonly present so that counting could be concluded in about 3-4 seconds.
      <br/>
      After counting, a software-trolled gate setting was applied to the data and used to visually select the `yeast gate` from a plot of particle size (i.e., SSC) vs. fluorescence intensity.
      <br/>
      The resultant window excluded most of the fluorescence attributable to urine residue particles as well as bacteria.
      <br/>
      The results presented in TABLE 7, below, show the effect of the visual gate selection procedure on the particles counted and peak flourescence of control samples of urine spiked with Candida utilis (i.e., having small bacterial sized cells), Micrococcus lesodeikticus, and urine samples from three patients with UTI of unknown etiology and one with a bacterial UTI.

      The results also seem to confirm the known bacterial UTI infection in patient -A, i.e., all of the particles counted fall outside of the range appropriate for yeast particles; and, in favor yeast infections in patients -B and -C, since 87% and 52%, respectively, of the particles counted fell within the range appropriate for yeast particles.

      Additional experiments were conducted to verify that the alkaline treatment conditions were effective for treatment of clinical samples containing differing numbers of cells; that the assay was functional within the range of analyte (yeast cells/ml) concentrations encountered in clinical practice; and that linearity was preserved when using clinical samples.
      <br/>
      For these experiments a urine sample was collected from patient -1201 with UTI confirmed by culture.
      <br/>
      The biological sample was subject to treatment as follows: namely, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 9 ml of urine were centrifuged in a clinical centrifuge (3000 rpm/10 minutes at 4 (degree)  C.) to prepare a urine sediment.
      <br/>
      Each respective urine sediment was then treated under alkaline conditions only, i.e., 500  MU l/1 N NaOH, and, since some visual aggregates still remained the sample was next treated with 0.25% trypsin for 30 minutes (supra) to disaggregate remaining urine sediment particles.
      <br/>
      The respective killed and denatured urine residue sediments were resuspended in 500  MU l of PBS and then stained with F-NHS-labeled catalytically disabled-lysozyme (Preparation -1, Method 1.) The respective sediments were washed with PBS and resuspending in 500  MU l PBS for flow fluorimetry, and stained for 30 minutes at 37 (degree)  C. with 80  MU g/ml of the catalytically inactive F-NHS-lysozyme.

      Cytometric methods were as described in regard to FIG. 3A, above, with sampling was at 60  MU l/minute using the undiluted treated 500  MU l urine sediment sample (supra.) Sample counting was complete (i.e., 97-99% confidence interval) at 4 seconds for the 1 ml urine sample (i.e., 5,400 fungal cells/sec.) and at 3 seconds for the 2-9 ml urine samples (i.e., 6,500 cells/sec.-8,800 cells/sec.) The results presented in FIG. 8 show that patient -1201 had about 5,400-8,800 cells/ MU l/second in the respective different urine sediments (corresponding to 54,000-2,700,000 yeast/ml in urine), i.e., at the high operating range of the assay.

      The results presented in FIG. 8 show that sufficient particles are present in certain clinical samples to allow for collection of only small urine volumes and/or dilution of urine sediment samples prior to analysis.
      <br/>
      Thus, titration curves may be constructed using differing amounts of urine samples (e.g., as in FIG. 7), or alternatively, by preparing a dilution series from a freshly prepared and stained (or 4 (degree)  C. stored) urine sediment.
      <br/>
      The dilution series can be constructed to bring the number of particles counted/ MU l of urine sediment sample/second within the range of about 1500-3000.
      <br/>
      The data collected in the assay may be plotted as cell counts per microliter urine sediment per second versus the dilution of urine sediment input to the assay (i.e., as in FIG. 8), and the plotted data defines a slope of a curve with a y-intercept.
      <br/>
      Both the value for the slope and for the y-intercept relate to the severity of an infection in the patient from which the urine sample was obtained.

      It is theoretically possible that this patient had developed a low-level secondary yeast infection.

      The data presented in FIGS. 10A, 10B, was recorded after analysis of a urine sample from a patient with a confirmed yeast UTI, and similarly, and data presented in FIGS. 11A, 11B, 11C and 11D was recorded after analysis of urine sediment samples collected one day apart (i.e., FIGS. 11A-B, day 1; FIGS. 11C-D, day 2) from a patient with a UTI of unknown etiology.

      The results presented in FIGS. 10A-B and 11A-D show YG particles in the samples, and support a diagnosis of a yeast UTI.

      Importantly, the fluorescence intensity data presented in FIGS. 11C-D was recorded over a much shorter sampling time (i.e., at a counting rate of 1800 cells/second) than that recorded in FIGS. 11A-B and the total YG particles counted in FIGS. 11C-D were nearly three times greater than those recorded in FIGS. 11A-B. The results presented in FIGS. 11A-D would suggest that if anti-bacterial therapy was administered to this particular patient, it was not effective in eliminating the yeast infection.

      Second Illustrative Urine Sediment Sample Treatment Protocol: As a rapid method for preparing a sample for cytofluorimetry without filtration or centrifugation, (but with a slightly higher background), approximately 100  MU l of well mixed urine is mixed with 100  MU l of acetone, or methanol, or a 1:1 mixture of acetone and methanol.
      <br/>
      The fixed and killed urine sample is then brought up to about 1 ml with PBS and about 10  MU l of MBP-SGC is added.
      <br/>
      The prepared sample is then immediately subject to cytofluorimetric analysis.
      <br/>
      Thus, in less than about 5 minutes of manipulation it is possible to determine whether a biological sample contains bacteria or yeast.

    <p num="240">EXAMPLE 9</p>
    <p num="241">Rapid Detection of Antibiotic Sensitivity Culture in Antibiotic Followed by Cytofluorimetric Quantification</p>
    <p num="242">In a clinical setting it is often important to rapidly determine antibiotic sensitivity, e.g., in septicemic subjects, subjects with antibiotic resistant infections and subjects already undergoing treatment (i.e., to establish therapeutic efficacy).</p>
    <p num="243">
      The methods of EXAMPLE 8, above, were used to determine antibiotic sensitivity of bacteria.
      <br/>
      To illustrate the technique, a single well-isolated colony forming unit of antibiotic-sensitive E. Coli was resuspended in nutrient broth to achieve a final concentration of about 108 bacteria per ml.
      <br/>
      Different volumes of the bacterial suspension were then mixed into 20-30 ml of fresh human urine to achieve final concentrations of about 104 -107 /ml.
      <br/>
      Without sedimenting the urine, 50-200  MU l aliquots of each different bacterial urine suspension were dispensed into each of the wells of a 24 well test microplate and bacterial growth medium, i.e., TSY broth, was added to each well to achieve a final total volume of about 1 ml to 1.5 ml. Assays were conducted in duplicate with 2 wells for a positive control (no antibiotic, just broth), 2 wells for a negative control (e.g., azide) and 2 wells for each different antibiotic concentration.
      <br/>
      Antibiotics (e.g., ampicillin, tetracycline, erythromycin, cephalosporin, vacomycin, a augmentin and fluconazole -for yeasts) were added to each two of the two wells at an IC50 -IC90 concentration in a volume of about 10-50  MU l. Each test plate was then incubated under conditions, and for a time, effective to allow about 4 cell division cycles of the bacteria, i.e., at 37 (degree)  C. for about 2-2.5 hrs. After incubation, the plates were centrifuged for a time and at a speed effective to sediment the bacteria, e.g., about 5 minutes at 2500-2800 rpm in an IEC bench top centrifuge.
      <br/>
      The number of bacteria in each of the test wells was determined by adding an MBP-conjugate, i.e., lysozyme-FITC, incubating for about 40 minutes at 37 (degree)  C. and quantifying stained bacteria in a cytofluorimeter according to the cytofluorimetric assay format disclosed in EXAMPLE 8, above.
      <br/>
      In the presence of the three different concentrations of antibiotics, and in the negative control sample, a very low, but still detectable, bacterial signal was detected, while in the positive (growth) control a significant peak of bacterial fluorescence was recorded.
      <br/>
      At the lower concentrations of certain antibiotics, e.g., ampicillin, a greater signal was recorded suggesting greater bacterial growth at the lower concentration of antibiotics and partial antibiotic-resistance of this particular laboratory strain of E. coli.
      <br/>
      When the experiment was repeated with using a tetracycline-resistant strain of S. aureus, a significant peak of bacterial fluorescence was recorded in all three of the tetracycline wells and in the positive control wells, but not in the negative control (azide) well, or in wells containing higher concentrations of the other antibiotics.
      <br/>
      Thus, the present assay allows detection of antibiotic sensitivity of an unknown bacteria in a patient sample after about 80 minutes of incubation, and about 3 hours of total time.
    </p>
    <p num="244">A diagnostic kit for the latter antibiotic sensitivity testing was assembled containing: a test strip containing 23 test wells; 7-1 ml squeeze dropper bottle containers each filled with one of seven different antibiotics, i.e., Ampicillin, Tetracycline, Erythromycin, Cephalosporin, Vancomycin, Augmentin and Fluconazole; a container (e.g., an 8th squeeze dropper bottle) filled with a negative control inhibiting bacterial growth (e.g., azide); and a container containing bacterial nutrient broth, e.g., TSY broth, in an amount sufficient for addition to all 23 test wells; and, instructions to (a) dispense an antibiotic from a squeeze bottle into three test wells each in one of three different amounts, (i.e., to achieve three different final test concentrations), e.g., one drop, two drops or three drops; (b) repeat "step a" for each of the different antibiotics of interest, e.g., the 7 different antibiotics in the test kit; (c) dispense the negative control into one test well (e.g., azide) and place nutrient broth into another test well for a positive (growth) control; (d) dispense a test sample into each of the 23 wells; (e) dispense nutrient broth into each of the 23 different test wells; (f) incubate at a temperature and for an amount of time sufficient to effect about 2 to about 4 bacterial cell division cycles, e.g., about 2 hrs. at 37 (degree)  C.; (g) collect the bacteria in each of the test wells, e.g., by centrifugation of the test strip for about 5 minutes at 2500-2800 rpm in a bench top IEC; (h) resuspend the collected bacteria into a smaller volume, e.g., about 500  MU l to about 800  MU l of nutrient broth; (i) add a volume of MBP-SGC conjugate effective to produce a signal in the positive control well, e.g., about 10  MU l to about 100  MU l of lysozyme-F-NHS according to EXAMPLE 2, above; (j) incubate at a temperature and for a time sufficient to effect a signal in the the positive control well, e.g., about 40 minutes at 37 (degree)  C.; and, (k) determine the relative number of bacteria in the different samples, e.g., according to a cytofluorimetric assay of EXAMPLE 8, above.</p>
    <p num="245">
      A number of different variations on the assay format are envisaged.
      <br/>
      It is possible to first quantify the signal produced by the bacteria in a sample, then culture in the presence of antibiotic, and re-quantify the signal.
      <br/>
      If the signal has increased, the bacteria were antibiotic resistant; if the signal has not increased, the bacteria were sensitive.
      <br/>
      In the latter case, the signal may be MBP-SGC binding to the bacteria (or yeast) or it may be a DNA stain, antibody-SGC or lectin-SGC.
      <br/>
      One advantage of this assay format is that since it is only important to determine whether the signal increased, or remained unchanged, it is not necessary to carefully subtract any background (e.g., red cells, false positive results, bacterial aggregates, etc.) from the results at each time point.
      <br/>
      Instead, it is only important that the machine baseline not drift extensively within the time frame of the assay, and this favors a relatively simple machine design since it is relatively routine to control for baseline drift.
      <br/>
      This assay format may also prove amenable to machine automation involving the capture and release closed loop methods disclosed in EXAMPLE 10, below.
    </p>
    <p num="246">EXAMPLE 10</p>
    <p num="247">Rapid Concentration of Bacteria and Yeast from Complex Samples Using Solid-Phase Bacterial Capture and Release</p>
    <p num="248">
      Bacterial concentration from complex biological samples is often frustrated by the presence of interfering substance, e.g., mucus, cell debris, collagen and the like.
      <br/>
      While filtration and centrifugation are commonly used, where contamination is an issue, i.e., of laboratory personnel or patient samples, it may be helpful useful to use an MBP-solid phase surface (EXAMPLE 4, above) as a specific extraction method to isolate and concentrate the bacteria (or yeast) from the biological sample.
    </p>
    <p num="249">Solid Phase Strips for Concentration and Extraction:</p>
    <p num="250">
      Preparation of illustrative MBP-solid phases appears in EXAMPLE 4 above.
      <br/>
      Instead of filtration or centrifugation, such an MBP-solid phase may be used to capture, concentrate and isolate bacteria (or yeast) from a biological sample.
      <br/>
      For instance, the solid phase strip may be immersed in a liquid biological sample, e.g., a dipstick suspended in a stirred waste water treatment tank to detect bacteria; or, a dipstick wiped along the surface of a solid biological sample, e.g., chicken or tables in a food processing line; or, a liquid biological sample may be flowed laterally across the solid phase-MBP surface, e.g., in a tubing coated with MBP.
      <br/>
      Representative solid phase MBP capture surfaces are disclosed in EXAMPLE 4, above.
      <br/>
      The latter surfaces are effective to capture bacteria and detection and signal generation may be achieved at the site of bacterial capture, e.g., by adding an MBP-SGC conjugate as a detect reagent, or adding a DNA dye as a detect reagent.
    </p>
    <p num="251">Closed Loop Capture and Concentration Systems:</p>
    <p num="252">
      Where contamination of laboratory personnel or patient samples is of concern, it may prove useful to inject a biological sample directly into an apparatus capable of making the necessary measurements, i.e., a closed loop machine system for detecting bacteria or yeast using MBP reagents.
      <br/>
      For example, bacteria may be captured at a first site, e.g. a capture loop containing MBP bound to a tubing wall.
      <br/>
      As fluid flows through the loop bacteria (or yeast) are concentrated, isolated and washed to remove interfering substances.
      <br/>
      The bacteria may be detected directly in the capture loop, e.g., by flowing MBP-luciferase through the loop, washing, and then measuring the light signal emitted from within the loop following excitation.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, it may prove useful to release the bacteria from the capture loop and conduct the detection and signal generation step at a second site, e.g., in a detect loop.
      <br/>
      In such assay formats it may prove useful to link MBP to the surface of the capture loop-solid phase through a releasable linker, e.g., a disulfide reducible cross-linking agent (MBS, EXAMPLE 3, supra) or a light-releasable leash such as 6-(((4,4-difluoro-5-(2-thienyl)-4-bora-3a,4a-diaza-s-indacene-3-yl)stryryloxy)acetyl)aminohexanoic acid, succinimidyl ester (e.g., available as "D-1000" from Molecular Probes, Inc.).
      <br/>
      When MBP, i.e., Preparation -1, EXAMPLE 1, was attached to polystyrene using D-1000, it was effective to capture, concentrate and isolate bacteria (or yeasts) on the surface and when illuminated with white light the bound MBP-bacteria conjugates were released.
      <br/>
      The released MBP-bacteria were fully viable and determined by growing them in nutrient broth.
      <br/>
      In one alternative use, capture and release may be used in a machine format to concentrate, isolate, detect and then release bacteria (or yeast) into a test assay for determining antibiotic sensitivity (i.e., as illustrated in greater detail in EXAMPLE below).
      <br/>
      For example, one method for determining antibiotic sensitivity of a bacteria or yeast may involve the steps of: (a) capturing, concentrating and isolating the bacteria (or yeast) on an MBP-light releasable leash-solid phase; (b) releasing the MBP-bacteria conjugated from the solid phase using light illumination; (c) culturing the released MBP-bacteria, e.g., in a nutrient broth, in the presence and absence of antibiotic; and, (d) quantifying the number of the bacteria (or yeast) in the cultured samples by detecting a reagent capable of binding to the bacteria (or yeast), e.g., a DNA dye, specific antibody-SGC conjugate, an MBP-SGC and the like.
      <br/>
      For example, cytofluorimetry according to EXAMPLE 8 may prove useful for quantifying the number of bacteria in the cultured samples.

    <p num="254">MBP Dipstick Solid Phase Capture and Detect System for Rapid Quantification of Bacterial Content in a Biological Sample</p>
    <p num="255">
      As disclosed above in regards to urinary tract infections, it is often most helpful for a physician to be able to determine the relative number of bacteria or fungi in a patient sample, i.e., sometimes referred to as the "bacterial or fimgal load" or "bacterial or fungal burden".
      <br/>
      Fluorimetric methods for quantifying the number of bacteria in a biological sample, e.g. as disclosed in EXAMPLE 8, above, require equipment that is often not available in a rural hospital, clinic or doctor's office.
      <br/>
      Detection of a bacteria is possible using a mobile phase dipstick.
      <br/>
      Quantification is also possible using MBP dipstick assay formats.
    </p>
    <p num="256">Size Exclusion Dipstick:</p>
    <p num="257">
      Dipstick assay formats may use size exclusion capillary mobility, i.e., bacteria and MBP-solid phase particles moving in a capillary fluid flow through a polymeric matrix unless their size is restricted by the matrix.
      <br/>
      The assay may be designed so that: (a) the polymeric matrix allows particles having a cross-sectional diameter equal to that of a desired bacteria to pass through it with capillary fluid flow; (b) individual MBP-solid phase particles, e.g., MBP-polystyrene latex particles prepared according to EXAMPLE 4, above, are also able to pass through the matrix; and (c) bacteria containing about 3 to about 10 MBP-solid phase particles are no longer able to pass through the matrix, i.e., they are size restricted.
      <br/>
      For example, in an assay where the polymeric matrix has a size exclusion limit of about 4-11 MU , a theoretical bacteria with a cross-sectional diameter of about 1 micron (1 MU ) will bind about 3 to 10 MBP-solid phase latex beads (1 MU  diameter) and then become trapped and stop migrating with the capillary fluid and solute.
      <br/>
      Examples of size exclusion polymeric matrices include cross-linked agaroses (e.g., Sepharose-CL, Pharmacia Upjohn Corp., Piscatawy, N.J.), cross-linked polyacrylamides (e.g., BioRad Laboratories, Inc., Oakland, Calif.), cross-linked celluloses, hydrogels and the like.
    </p>
    <p num="258">
      Dipstick components and assembly methods are known to those skilled in the art.
      <br/>
      For example, in a rectangular, one-end-open, box-shaped dipstick design it may prove useful to suspend the subject polymeric matrix in a space between an upper member, a lower member, two side piece members and an end piece member; all of which comprise a liquid impervious barrier.
      <br/>
      For components, e.g., the upper member may be composed of polyethylene, vinyl, Mylar, cellophane and the like; the lower, side and end piece members composed of a cardboard, solid bleached sulfite, polycarbonate, Lexan (tm)  and the like.
      <br/>
      A sample is introduced into the polymeric matrix through the open-end of the dipstick.
      <br/>
      For purposes of loading sample and mixing it with MBP-solid phase reagents, or with sample preparation reagents (e.g., chemical or protease reagents according to EXAMPLE 8, above), it may be useful to include a bibulous pad within the open-end of the dipstick and in fluid-continuous-flow apposition with the polymeric matrix.
      <br/>
      Examples of materials useful for this bibulous pad may include filter papers, non-woven synthetic polymers, glass fiber, fleeces and the like.
      <br/>
      Illustrative methods for assembly of dipsticks are disclosed in U.S. Pat. Ser. No. 5,846,838 (Chandler et al.), U.S. Pat. No. 4,168,146 (Grubb et al.), U.S. Pat. No. 4,366,241 (Tom et al.), U.S. Pat. No. 5,780,308 (Ching et al.), U.S. Pat. No. 5,656,448 (Kang et al.), U.S. Pat. No. 5,580,735 (Malick et al.) all of which are incorporated, in their entirety, herein by reference for useful polymeric matrices, dipstick assembly, materials, adhesives, beads, test kit components, enzymes, substrates, and assay fornats.

    <p num="259">
      In practice it may prove desirable to select the size of the polymeric matrix and the size of the particular beads to trap just a particular size of bacteria from out of a mixture of bacteria.
      <br/>
      For example, the theoretical 1 MU  bacteria above; or, the number of MBP-solid phase beads may be adjusted to allow detection of a particular number of bacteria in a biological sample.
      <br/>
      The dipstick format may be used to quantify bacteria present in a biological sample, e.g., where MBP-beads are present in a slight excess over the number of bacteria in a sample, samples containing smaller numbers of bacteria will result in higher numbers of MBP-beads per bacteria than samples containing fewer MBP-beads, thus the distance migrated within a size exclusion dipstick will be related inversely to the number of bacteria.
    </p>
    <p num="260">
      MBP-beads may be present in a zone, e.g., at the immersible bibulous end of the dipstick, or they may be scattered through out the matrix of the dipstick so that bacteria moving in the capillary fluid flow progressively pick up more and more MBP-beads as they migrate, and so that larger numbers of bacteria will more greater distances within the matrix before becoming trapped.
      <br/>
      Thus, the distance of movement within the polymeric matrix may be used as one indication of the relative number of bacteria present in a biological sample.
    </p>
    <p num="261">
      As will be appreciated by those skilled in the art, once the bacteria are trapped within the matrix of a dipstick a variety of reagents may be added to the dipstick, or trapped within the dipstick, for purposes of detecting the trapped bacteria.
      <br/>
      For example, the developed dipstick containing trapped bacteria may be dipped into a solution of a dye that bind to DNA or bacterial cell wall materials, a lectin, an enzyme reactive with a bacterial products, an antibody-SGC conjugate, a fluorophore, or an MBP-SGC reagent such as disclosed in EXAMPLE 3.
      <br/>
      In this context, it will be appreciated that substrates, enzyme co-factors and/or assay signal amplification systems may be incorporated within the polymeric matrix of the dipstick.

The polymeric matrix of dipstick 1 is optionally infiltrated with an indicator capable of detecting the activity of an enzyme SGC, e.g., by immersion of dipstick 1 in a substrate/dye solution such as disclosed supra for alkaline phosphatase-SGC or horse radish peroxidase-SGC.

      <br/>
      In this particular illustration, an enzyme SGC.

      In operation, dipstick 1 is immersed in a biological sample, (e.g., a diluted urine test sample to which a buffer has been added, or a urine sediment sample according to EXAMPLE 8, above), for a time, (e.g., about 2 to about 15 minutes), and under conditions effective to allow capillary movement to a point about 2/3 of the y-axis dimension 3.
      <br/>
      In embodiments containing enzyme-substrate indicator trapped within the polymeric matrix of test dipstick 1 detection of the MBP-SGC solid phase particles bound to bacteria and thereby trapped within the polymeric matrix is accomplished by incubating, preferably under moist conditions, for a time effective to allow conversion of substrate into a visible product.
      <br/>
      In embodiments where enzyme-substrate indicator is not trapped within the polymeric matrix of test dipstick 1, then, test dipstick 1 is removed from the urine sample and moisture is allowed to evaporate for about 2 to about 15 minutes, i.e., not to complete dryness.

      As disclosed above, the distance migrated by the MBP-SGC-solid phase within test dipstick 10 will be related to the number of bacteria in the biological sample, i.e., the fewer the number of bacteria, the more particles which will be bound by bacteria and unavailable for movement in the capillary fluid.
      <br/>
      The fewer the number of bacteria, the fewer the number of MBP-SGC-particles bound and the more mobile the complexes will be within the martix of dipstick 10.

      By having different numbers of capture lines within each different capture zones, a different number of MBP-SGC solid phase capture beads are provided, e.g., 106, then 2 * 106, 4 * 106, etc.
      <br/>
      According to this particular illustrative embodiment, as bacteria in a biological sample progress by capillary flow along the y-axis of the subject dipstick they progressively encounter higher concentrations of capture beads, i.e., within the different capture zones, and when a sufficient number of beads are bound the motion of the bacteria is restricted by the polymeric matrix.
    </p>
    <p num="273">Continuous Gradient Mobile Phase Dipstick:</p>
    <p num="274">
      As a variation of the Zonal Mobile Phase Dipstick disclosed above, the subject "capture zones" may instead consist of a continuously increasing gradient of MBP-SGC solid phase beads applied along the y-axis of the subject dipstick, e.g., using a gradient maker and ink-jet type spray applicator.
      <br/>
      As with the zonal mobile phase dipstick, as bacteria progress along the y-axis of the subject dipstick they encounter progressively greater numbers of capture beads.
      <br/>
      Binding of MBP-beads to the bacteria will progressively increase the cross-sectional diameter until movement is restricted by the pore size of the matrix.
      <br/>
      Again, distance migrated along the y-axis of the dipstick is inversely related to the number of bacteria in the biological sample.
    </p>
    <p num="275">Non-Mobile Phase Zonal Dipsticks:</p>
    <p num="276">
      Dipstick MBP assay formats are also envisaged in which MBP is fixed to the polymeric solid-phase matrix in capture zones having a width of about 0.2 mm to about 1 mm.
      <br/>
      For example, the first capture zone may consist of one capture line, a second zone of two capture lines, a third of three and so on.
      <br/>
      By having different numbers of capture lines within each different capture zones, a different amount of MBP solid phase capture reagent is provided, e.g., 106 molecules, then 2 * 106, 4 * 106, etc.
    </p>
    <p num="277">Test Kits:</p>
    <p num="278">Dipstick test kits commonly contain instructions; one or more dipstick assay devices; optional MBP-SGC detect reagent, e.g., in one or more squeeze bottles; optional substrate solution, i.e., for enzyme SGCs, e.g., in one or more squeeze bottles; an optional sample well, wash well and sample applicator; an optional bottle of wash fluid.</p>
    <p num="279">EXAMPLE 12</p>
    <p num="280">Methods for Determining Bacterial Genus and/or Species</p>
    <p num="281">
      It is possible to use the method of EXAMPLES 8 and 9, above, in combination with reagents for simultaneously determining the genus and species of bacteria (or yeast) present in a biological sample, i.e., referred to herein as "speciation reagents".
      <br/>
      Representative examples of speciation reagents include genus and species specific bacteriophages, genus and species specific antibodies, lectins and the like as coupled to a SGC.
      <br/>
      For example, according to the methods of EXAMPLE 8, a variety of two-color cytofluorimetric assay formats are envisaged where MBP-SGC-1 is used to detect and/or quantify bacteria (or yeast) and a speciation reagent coupled to SGC-2 is used to identify the genus or species of bacteria (or yeast) being counted.
      <br/>
      Similarly, in a dipstick format a MBP may be used as a capture, a MBP-SGC-1 (e.g. HRP generating a red colored reaction product with ABTS) as a detect reagent and a speciation reagent-SGC-2 (e.g., alkaline phosphatase producing a blue reaction product); if bacteria are present a red band will appear, if the speciation reagent is reactive with the bacteria a dark rose, purple or dark blue color will result.
      <br/>
      Multiplex, i.e., multiple channel, dipsticks are envisaged in which each different channel is contains, or is exposed to or dipped in, a different speciation reagent.
      <br/>
      Using the red/blue example, above, a multiple lane dipstick might show red reaction product in all lanes except one, where a purple reaction product would indicate reaction with a specific speciation reagent-SGC-2.
