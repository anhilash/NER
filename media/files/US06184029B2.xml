    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">
      This invention relates to sample preparation devices having small dimensions for facilitating the efficient preparation of microvolume test samples, e.g., of whole blood, for the determination and/or processing of analytes present therein.
      <br/>
      The present invention also relates to test systems including such devices, together with devices of similar dimensions which are designed, for example, to perform various assay protocols as well as analyses involving amplification of pre-selected polynucleotides, such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR).
    </p>
    <p num="3">
      In recent decades the art has developed a large number of protocols, test kits, and devices for conducting analyses on biological samples for various diagnostic and monitoring purposes.
      <br/>
      Immunoassays, immunometric assays, agglutination assays, analyses involving polynucleotide amplification reactions, various ligand-receptor interactions, and differential migration of species in a complex sample all have been used to determine the presence or quantity of various biological molecules or contaminants, or the presence of particular cell types.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      Recently, small, disposable devices have been developed for handling biological samples and for conducting certain clinical tests.
      <br/>
      Shoji et al. reported the use of a miniature blood gas analyzer fabricated on a silicon wafer.
      <br/>
      Shoji et al., Sensors and Actuators, 15: 101-107 (1988).
      <br/>
      Sato et al. reported a cell fusion technique using micromechanical silicon devices.
      <br/>
      Sato et al., Sensors and Actuators, A21-A23: 948-953 (1990).
      <br/>
      Ciba Corning Diagnostics Corp. (USA) has manufactured a microprocessor-controlled laser photometer for detecting blood clotting.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      Micromachining technology originated in the microelectronics industry.
      <br/>
      Angell et al., Scientific American, 248: 44-55 (1983).
      <br/>
      Micromachining technology has enabled the manufacture of microengineered devices having structural elements with minute dimensions, ranging from tens of microns (the dimensions of biological cells) to nanometers (the dimensions of some biological macromolecules).
      <br/>
      Most experiments reported to date involving such small structures have involved studies of micromechanics, i.e., mechanical motion and flow properties.
      <br/>
      The potential capability of such devices has not been exploited fully in the life sciences.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      Brunette (Exper. Cell Res., 167: 203-217 (1986) and 164: 11-26 (1986)) studied the behavior of fibroblasts and epithelial cells in grooves in silicon, titanium-coated polymers and the like.
      <br/>
      McCartney et al. (Cancer Res., 41: 3046-3051 (1981)) examined the behavior of tumor cells in grooved plastic substrates.
      <br/>
      LaCelle (Blood Cells, 12: 179-189 (1986)) studied leukocyte and erythrocyte flow in microcapillaries to gain insight into micro-circulation.
      <br/>
      Hung and Weissman reported a study of fluid dynamics in micromachined channels, but did not produce data associated with an analytical device.
      <br/>

      <br/>
      Masuda et al. and Washizu et al. have reported the use of a fluid flow chamber for the manipulation of cells (e.g., cell fusion).
      <br/>
      Masuda et al., Proceedings IEEE/IAS Meeting, pp. 1549-1553 (1987); and Washizu et al., Proceedings IEEE/IAS Meeting, pp. 1735-1740 (1988).
      <br/>
      The art has not fully explored the potential of using microengineered devices for the determination of analytes in fluid samples, particularly in the area of biological analyses.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      Biological analyses utilizing polynucleotide amplification techniques are well known (See e.g., Maniatis et al., Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, 1989, pp. 14.1-14.35).

      One such technique is PCR amplification, which can be performed on a DNA template using a thermostable DNA polymerase, e.g., Taq DNA polymerase (Chien et al., J. Bacteriol., 127: 1550 (1976)), nucleoside triphosphates, and two oligonucleotides with different sequences, complementary to sequences that lie on opposite strands of the template DNA and which flank the segment of DNA that is to be amplified ("primers").
      <br/>
      The reaction components are cycled between a higher temperature (e.g., 94 (degree)  C.) for dehybridizing double stranded template DNA, followed by lower temperatures (e.g., 65 (degree)  C.) for annealing and polymerization.
      <br/>
      A repeated reaction cycle between dehybridization, annealing and polymerization temperatures provides approximately exponential amplification of the template DNA.
      <br/>
      Machines for performing automated PCR chain reactions using a thermal cycler are available (Perkin Elmer Corp.)

      PCR amplification has been applied to the diagnosis of genetic disorders (Engelke et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., 85: 544 (1988), the detection of nucleic acid sequences of pathogenic organisms in clinical samples (Ou et al., Science, 239: 295 (1988)), the genetic identification of forensic samples, e.g., sperm (Li et al., Nature, 335: 414 (1988)), the analysis of mutations in activated oncogenes (Farr et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., 85: 1629 (1988)) and in many aspects of molecular cloning (Oste, BioTechniques, 6: 162 (1988)).
      <br/>
      PCR assays can be used in a wide range of applications such as the generation of specific sequences of cloned double-stranded DNA for use as probes, the generation of probes specific for uncloned genes by selective amplification of particular segments of cDNA, the generation of libraries of cDNA from small amounts of mRNA, the generation of large amounts of DNA for sequencing, and the analysis of mutations.
      <br/>
      There is a need for convenient, rapid systems for performing polynucleotide amplification, which may be used clinically in a wide range of potential applications in clinical tests such as tests for paternity, and for genetic and infectious diseases.

    <p num="9">
      Current analytical techniques utilized for the determination of microorganisms are rarely automated, usually require incubation in a suitable medium to increase the number of organisms, and generally employ visual and/or chemical methods to identify the strain or sub-species of interest.
      <br/>
      The inherent delay in such methods frequently necessitates medical intervention prior to definitive identification of the nature of an infection.
      <br/>
      In industrial, public health or clinical environments, such delays may have unfortunate consequences.

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="27">
      The sample preparation device of the invention comprises a solid substrate, preferably in the form of a chip having dimensions on the order of less than one to a few millimeters thick and approximately 0.1 to 5.0 centimeters square.
      <br/>
      The substrate is microfabricated to form a sample flow path having an inlet and an outlet as well as a separator disposed intermediate to the inlet and outlet.
      <br/>
      The upstream-facing portion of the separator defines a separation zone in the flow path in which particulate components of the test sample are collected.
      <br/>
      The device may also include a flow channel in fluid communication with the separation zone which functions to discharge collected particulate components from the separation zone.
      <br/>
      The flow channel has an inlet section for directing a carrier fluid into the separation zone and over the upstream-facing portion of the separator and a discharge section for directing the carrier fluid, in which the particulate components are entrained, out of the separation zone.
      <br/>
      At least one of the aforementioned flow path and flow channel sections have at least one mesoscale dimension.
    </p>
    <p num="28">If the particulate components of the sample are not to be analyzed, they can remain in the separation zone, in which case the flow channel is essentially nonfunctional and thus may be eliminated from the device.</p>
    <p num="29">
      As used herein, the term "mesoscale" refers to flow passages or channels and other structural elements, e.g. reaction and/or detection chambers, at least one of which has at least one cross-sectional dimension on the order of 0.1  MU m to 1000  MU m and more preferably 0.2  MU m to 500  MU m. The preferred depth of the flow passages and chambers is on the order of 0.1-100  MU m and more preferably 2-50  MU m. The preferred flow passage width is on the order of 2-200  MU m and more preferably 3-100  MU m. The preferred chamber width is on the order of 0.05-5 mm and more preferably 50-500  MU m. The width of the passageway(s) in the separator is typically on the order of less than 50  MU m which is sufficiently small to separate particulate matter from most biological samples and other test samples of interest.
      <br/>
      The separator passageways will normally have a depth of about 0.1 to about 100  MU m. The length of the separator passageways will typically be within the range of about 0.1  MU m to about 5 mm.
    </p>
    <p num="30">The flow passages and other structures, when viewed in cross-section, may be triangular, ellipsoidal, square, rectangular, circular or any other shape at least one cross-sectional dimension of which, transverse to the path of flow of sample fluid through or into a given structure, is mesoscale.</p>
    <p num="31">
      The mesoscale devices of the invention facilitate sample preparation in a broad range of biological analyses and, together with the analytical devices described herein, enable the rapid determination of microquantities of both molecular and cellular analytes in various test samples.
      <br/>
      At the conclusion of the analysis, the devices typically are discarded.
    </p>
    <p num="32">
      Mesoscale devices having at least one flow passage or other structural element with at least one mesoscale dimension can be designed and fabricated in large quantities from a solid substrate material using various micromachining methods known to those skilled in the art.
      <br/>
      Such methods include film deposition processes, such as spin coating and chemical vapor deposition, laser machining or photolithographic techniques, e.g. UV or X-ray processes, etching methods which may be performed by either wet chemical processes or plasma processes, LIGA processing or plastic molding.
      <br/>
      See, for example, Manz et al., Trends in Analytical Chemistry 10:144-149 (1991).
    </p>
    <p num="33">
      The sample preparation device of the invention may be conveniently constructed by forming the flow passages and separator in the surface of a suitable substrate and then mounting a cover over such surface.
      <br/>
      The solid substrate and/or cover may comprise a material such as silicon, polysilicon, silica glass, thermocouple materials, gallium arsenide, polyimide, silicon nitride and silicon dioxide.
      <br/>
      The cover and/or substrate may also comprise a plastic material, such as acrylic, polycarbonate, polystyrene, polyethylene or other resin materials.
      <br/>
      Optionally, the cover and/or substrate may comprise a transparent material, e.g., a relatively thin, anodically bonded layer of glass or ultrasonically welded plastic sheet material.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, two substrates of like material can be sandwiched together, or a suitable substrate material may be sandwiched between two transparent cover layers.
    </p>
    <p num="34">
      A diagrammatic representation of one embodiment the mesoscale sample preparation device of the invention is shown in FIG. 1.
      <br/>
      The device 10 is microfabricated in a suitable substrate 11, thereby forming a sample flow path 12a and 12b having sample inlet port 14 and outlet port 16.
      <br/>
      A filter-type separator 18 is interposed in the flow path between inlet 14 and outlet 16.
      <br/>
      The upstream-facing portion 20 of the separator defines a separation zone 22 for collecting particulate components of the test sample.
      <br/>
      The device also includes a flow channel 24a and 24b in fluid communication with separation zone 22 for delivering a carrier fluid to, and discharging collected particulate matter from the separation zone.
      <br/>
      Flow channel 24a, 24b has an inlet section 26 for directing carrier fluid, e.g., isotonic buffer, from a source (not shown) over the upstream-facing portion 20 of separator 18.
      <br/>
      Discharge section 28 conveys the carrier fluid from over the upstream-facing surface of the filter element and out of separation zone 22.
    </p>
    <p num="35">
      Separator 18 which is microfabricated in sample flow path 12a and 12b of the sample preparation device serves to remove particulate matter from the test sample passed through the device prior to analysis.
      <br/>
      In one embodiment, shown in FIGS. 2 and 3, the separator comprises a series of mesoscale passageways of reduced dimension in comparison with flow path 12a, 12b.
      <br/>
      In operation, separator 18 functions as a filter, accumulating particulate matter on its upstream surface 18a, while the filtrate exiting passageways 19 continues along flow path 12b.
      <br/>
      The filter passageways 19 are microfabricated with depths and widths on the order of about 5  MU m to about 50  MU m, whereas flow paths 12a, 12b have maximum depths and widths on the order of approximately 1000  MU m. The filter element is preferably microfabricated in the substrate of the device so as to form at least one, and preferably several, generally upstanding projections of the substrate material disposed in the flow path, which serve to restrict the flow of sample fluid through the separation zone.
    </p>
    <p num="36">
      Protuberances p may be provided on the exterior of the upstream-facing portion of separator 18, as depicted in FIG. 2, as an aid in preventing plugging of passageways 19 by particulate matter in the sample fluid.
      <br/>
      Also, a sump (not shown) may be provided adjacent the upstream-facing portion of separator 18 for collecting insoluble debris removed from the sample fluid.
    </p>
    <p num="37">
      Separator 18 preferably is an essentially stationary structure permanently positioned between sample inlet 14 and outlet 16 of the flow path, as can be seen in FIG. 1.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, however, the separator may be transiently disposed in the flow path.
      <br/>
      For example, a mass of magnetic particles may be retained in relatively fixed position in flow path 12a, 12b by means of an applied magnetic field to effect filtration of particulate matter from the test sample.
      <br/>
      The fluid portion of the sample passes through the void spaces between the particles as the filtrate.
      <br/>
      At the appropriate time, the applied magnetic field is removed and the magnetic particles may be transferred from the flow path, together with any particular matter from the test sample accumulated thereon, for analysis or disposal, as desired.
    </p>
    <p num="38">
      Separator 18 may, if desired, comprise a reagent that facilitates removal of particles or formed bodies from the test sample.
      <br/>
      In the case of a biological sample comprising a mixed cell population, for example, a binding substance that releasably binds to a specific target cell type within the mixed population may be adsorbed or otherwise affixed to the separator to effect removal and selective retention of the target cell type.
      <br/>
      Cells which are not retained can be conveyed from the separation zone for disposal.
      <br/>
      The retained cells are subsequently caused to be released for analysis.
    </p>
    <p num="39">
      The sample preparation device of the invention can be used in combination with an appliance, such as appliance 30, shown in schematic cross-section in FIG. 4, for delivering fluids to, discharging fluids from, and transferring fluids between the different devices constituting the analytical systems of the invention.
      <br/>
      Appliance 30, which has a nesting site 32 for holding the device 10, and for registering ports, e.g. port 14 on the device, with a flow line 33 in the appliance.
      <br/>
      The appliance may include an impellent, such as pump 34 shown in FIG. 4, for conveying the sample through the flow passages of the device.
      <br/>
      After a biological fluid sample suspected to contain a particular analyte of interest is applied to the inlet port 35 of the appliance, pump 34 is actuated to convey the sample into port 14 of device 10 and then through flow path 12a,12b.
      <br/>
      Although pump 34 is shown as an element of appliance 30, it may, if desired be incorporated into device 10 according to known microfabrication techniques.
      <br/>
      Economic considerations, however, favor placement of the pump in appliance 30.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, depending on the nature of the analyses to be performed, a sample may be injected into the device, or the sample may enter the flow passages of the device through the inlet port by capillary action.
      <br/>
      In another embodiment, the appliance may be disposed over the sample preparation chip, and may be provided with a flow line communicating with the inlet port in the device, e.g., in the absence of a cover over the device, to allow a sample to be injected into the device.
      <br/>

      When the sample preparation device and analytical devices described above are used together to function as a analytical system, as illustrated in FIG. 5, for example, the system is advantageously combined with an appliance of the type depicted in FIGS. 6A, 6B and 7.
      <br/>
      Like the appliance of FIG. 4, previously described, appliance 50 in FIG. 6A serves to deliver fluid to, discharge fluid from, and transfer fluid between the respective devices.
      <br/>
      Appliance 50 has a nesting site 52 for holding sample preparation device 10 and analytical device 112 and for registering ports in the devices with flow lines in the appliance.
      <br/>
      Specifically, flow line 54a is in registry with inlet port 14 of the sample preparation device, flow line 54b is in registry both with outlet 16 of the sample preparation device and inlet 114, and flow line 54c is in registry with outlet 119 of assay structure 112 of the analytical device.

      As illustrated in FIG. 6A, flow line 54a is in fluid communication with appliance inlet port 56, whereas flow line 54C is in fluid communication with appliance outlet 57.

      The appliance typically includes an impellent, such as pump 58, for forcing sample fluid through the analytical system.
      <br/>
      After applying to inlet port 56 of appliance 50, a particle-containing fluid test sample, e.g., whole blood, the serum phase of which is suspected to contain an analyte of interest, pump 58 is actuated to force the sample through separator 18, providing sample fluid, e.g., serum, of substantially reduced particle content.

      The binding of analyte, per se, or analyte reaction products to a binding substance in the reaction/detection region of the analytical devices can be detected by any number of methods, including monitoring the pressure or electrical conductivity of sample fluids in the device(s), as disclosed in the above-referenced related applications (see, for example, U.S. Ser. No. 877,702), or by optical detection through a transparent cover, either visually or by machine.
      <br/>
      For example, reaction of an analyte with a binding substance in the reaction region 117 of analytical device 112 illustrated in FIG. 6A can be detected by monitoring the pressure of the sample fluids in certain regions of the mesoscale flow passages.
      <br/>
      This is accomplished in the analytical system-appliance combination of FIG. 6A by means of two pressure detectors 59a and 59b for detecting flow pressure of fluids entering and exiting the devices through ports 14 and 119, respectively.
      <br/>
      When, during the performance of an assay, particles agglomerate or molecules chemically interact to form a network causing restricted flow or an increase in the viscosity of the sample liquid passing through the reaction/detection region, such changes can be detected as a pressure change which is indicative of a positive result.

      A hydrophobic environment created in chamber 147, e.g., by virtue of material adhered to the walls of the structure, the capture agent or a component of the reaction mixture, e.g., a surfactant or micelle-forming agent, will improve the fluorescent signal from the bound fluorescein.

      Barrier 173, together with the cover of the device, defines at least one passageway 174, as illustrated in FIG. 10C, which allows fluid flow therethrough, but is of sufficiently small dimension to prevent the passage of particulate components, e.g., cells, of a fluid sample.
      <br/>
      Barrier 173 is positioned such that inlet 171 feeds sample fluid directly into flow path 172a and indirectly into flow path 172b, the fluid passing into flow path 172b having a substantially reduced particle content, as compared with previously unfiltered sample entering inlet 171.

      FIG. 11A diagrammatically depicts an analytical device 191 used to determine the presence of an intracellular polynucleotide in a biological cell-containing fluid sample, and then to perform an assay for a particular nucleotide sequence.
      <br/>
      Microfabricated on substrate 192 is a mesoscale flow path 194a-c which includes a cell separation chamber 196a, a cell lysis chamber 196b, a filter element 197, a polynucleotide amplification chamber comprising sections 198a and 198b, and a detection region 199.
      <br/>
      The mesoscale flow system is also provided with fluid entry/exit ports 193a-d.
      <br/>
      The device can be used in combination with an appliance, such as that described above with reference to FIG. 6A.
    </p>
    <p num="95">
      Initially, the valves in the above-mentioned appliance function to close ports 193c and 193d, while ports 193a and 193b are open.
      <br/>
      A sample containing a mixture of cells, e.g., transferred from the sample preparation device, is directed to the sample inlet port 193a by a suitable impellent, e.g. a pump, (not shown), and flows through the mesoscale flow channel 194a to separation chamber 196a.
      <br/>
      Chamber 196a contains binding moieties immobilized on the wall of the chamber which selectively bind to a surface molecule on a desired cell type in the sample.
      <br/>
      Remaining cellular components exit the substrate via port 193b.
      <br/>
      After binding of the desired cell type in chamber 196a, flow with buffer is continued, to wash and assure isolation of the target cells.
      <br/>
      Next port 193b is closed and 193c is opened.
      <br/>
      Flow is then increased sufficiently to dislodge the immobilized cells from chamber 196a.
      <br/>
      Flow is continued, forcing cells through membrane piercing protrusions 195 in chamber 196b, which tear open the cells releasing intracellular material.
    </p>
    <p num="96">
      Sample flow continues past filter 197, which filters off large cellular membrane components and other debris, with the filtrate passing to mesoscale PCR chamber section 198a, which is connected to PCR chamber section 198b by flow channel 194b.
      <br/>
      Tag polymerase, primers and other reagents required for the PCR assay next are added to section 198b through port 193c from a source thereof (not shown), permitting mixing of the intracellular soluble components from the separated subpopulation of cells and the PCR reagents.
      <br/>
      With the ports closed (to ensure that the reaction mixture does not evaporate, or otherwise becomes lost from the device), an impellent, e.g. a pump, (not shown), applies a motive force to port 193b to cycle the PCR sample and reagents through flow channel 194b between sections 198a and 198b, set at 94 (degree)  C. and 65 (degree)  C., respectively, to implement plural polynucleotide melting and polymerization cycles, allowing the amplification of the polynucleotide of interest.
      <br/>
      Before the next process step, port 193c is closed and port 193d is opened.
      <br/>
      The same impellent force is then used to direct the amplified polynucleotide isolated from the cell population to a detection region 199 in the form of a pattern of flow channels like that described above with reference to FIG. 9C. Flow reduction in the restricted region serves as a positive indicator of the presence of amplified polynucleotide product and may be detected optically through a glass cover disposed over the detection region 199.

      Alternatively, the amplified polynucleotide product may be detected directly in the reaction chamber, using commercially available reagents developed for such purpose, such as the "Taq Man.RTM." reagents, available from Perkin Elmer Corporation.

    <p num="106">
      FIGS. 12A-D illustrate various additional embodiments of microfabricated, restricted flow separators which may be disposed in the flow passages of the devices described herein.
      <br/>
      The separator in FIG. 12A is in the form of a plurality of partitions 251, projecting from opposite surfaces 252a, 252b of channel 253, so as to define a series of passageways 254a, 254b, which are aligned longitudinally along the channel.
      <br/>
      One or more intermediate partitions 255, projecting from the bottom of channel 250 may be disposed adjacent the downstream-facing portion of one or more of partitions 251, to stand as barriers or baffles within the flow path provided by aligned passageways 253.
    </p>
    <p num="107">
      Sample fluid passing through the relatively narrow passageways 254a, 254b at relatively high speed will tend to disperse into the space between consecutive partitions, while reducing in speed and moving into the dead volume corners of such space.
      <br/>
      When sample fluid then passes into the next successive inter-partition space, particulate matter may be relatively retained in the dead volume.
      <br/>
      Thus, for each passage into a subsequent inter-partition space, particulate matter is progressively retained and sample fluid becomes gradually more purified as it flows downstream through the partitions.
      <br/>
      With a sufficient number of partitions in series, progressive reduction in particle concentration would be enabled, the efficiency of which could be predetermined.
      <br/>
      Baffles 255 would assist in directing the sample fluid into the dead volume region.
    </p>
    <p num="108">In FIG. 12C, there is shown a weir-type separator structure formed by barriers 257 projecting up from the bottom 258 of channel 250.</p>
    <p num="109">
      The separator structure shown in FIGS. 12C and 12D takes advantage of the propensity of particles to fall under the influence of gravity.
      <br/>
      This may be particularly useful in the analysis of whole blood, by promoting the sedimentation of erythrocytes.
      <br/>
      The sample fluid passes at high speed over barrier 257, then immediately slows.
      <br/>
      Any particulate matter falling towards the floor of channel 250 will experience a lower supporting velocity and a diminished opportunity of being swirled up over the next succeeding barrier.
      <br/>
      Passage of sample fluid over a series of such barriers may progressively reduce particulate concentration and produce gradually more purified sample fluid.
      <br/>
      One or more lips 259 suspended from cover plate 260 assists in downwardly directing the sample fluid.
