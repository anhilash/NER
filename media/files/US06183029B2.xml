      <br/>
      A specially adapted storage container for use with motorized golf carts.
      <br/>
      Commonly, there is an unused space on motorized golf carts lying horizontally between the rear of the seats and the front of the compartment where golf bags are kept, and vertically between the surface of the chassis and the bottom of a wire basket mounted behind the seats.
      <br/>
      This invention makes this unused space available for storage.
      <br/>
      It is available in either a wire-mesh or fully enclosed version, and, depending on the embodiments, may be accessed either from one of the sides, from the rear, or from the front, via the opening usually found between the seat cushion and the seat back on golf carts.

      Field of the Invention
    </p>
    <p num="3">The present invention relates generally to accessories for motorized golf carts and, more specifically, to storage containers for use with motorized golf carts.</p>
    <p num="4">2. Description of Related Art</p>
    <p num="5">
      Conventional motorized golf carts typically include an open topped wire basket mounted to the cart in a space located between the rear of the seat backs and the location at the rear of the cart intended for the storage of golfbags.
      <br/>
      This wire basket is a convenience intended to enable the storage of articles such as towels, rain gear, and the like.
      <br/>
      Due to the fact that they typically lack a cover, however, such containers are usually not secure.
      <br/>
      Moreover, the containers are often mounted a considerable distance above the surface of the golf cart chassis lying below it.
      <br/>
      As such, the typical golf cart includes a significant amount of unused space, extending vertically from the bottom of the wire basket to the surface of the chassis below, and horizontally from the seatbacks to an aperture in the rear of the cart where golfbags are stored.
      <br/>
      Typically, extra space is often required for shoes, coolers, golf balls, etc. for at least two riders.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      Close examination of the relevant art reveals many types of storage containers adapted for use on specific locations in various vehicles, but no such container has been designed for use in the space behind the seatbacks and below the standard wiremesh basket found on most golf carts.

    </p>
    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
    <p num="15">
      In order to describe the location of the present invention on the upper surface 10 of the golf cart chassis, it is convenient to divide this upper surface into a front portion 12, a middle portion 14, and a rear portion 16.
      <br/>
      The front portion has at least one seat 18 mounted thereupon, with a backrest 20 and the rear 22 of the seat cushion 24 adjacent the middle portion 14.
      <br/>
      The rear portion 16 defines an aperture 26 for storing golf club bags 28 in a vertically disposed manner.
      <br/>
      Within this environment, the present invention consists of a storage container 30 designed to mount on the middle portion 14 of the chassis surface 10, between the backrest 20 and the golf bag aperture 26.
    </p>
    <p num="16">
      Any number of means may be used to secure the container 30 to the cart.
      <br/>
      For example, a plurality of nuts and bolts may be used to secure the bottom of the container to the middle portion of the chassis.
      <br/>
      Another example, includes adhesive backed clips which are easy to install thereby obviating the need for drilled holes for mechanical fasteners.
      <br/>
      One modification of the present invention that is commonly necessary arises because motorized golf carts typically include a wire basket 32 suspended a predefined distance above the middle portion 14.
      <br/>
      The bottom 34 of this preexisting wire basket places an upper limit on the height of the present invention.
      <br/>
      Of course, the precise dimensions of the present invention are widely adaptable, depending on the characteristics of the golf cart with which it is used.
    </p>
    <p num="17">
      A number of other features of the invention may be varied as well.
      <br/>
      To begin, it is possible for the invention to be either an open-topped wire mesh basket, as depicted in FIG. 1, or an enclosed container consisting of solid material, such as hard plastic.
      <br/>
      Different versions of enclosed containers are depicted in FIGS. 2 and 3.
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      The containers also vary in accordance with the manner in which one accesses the interior.
      <br/>
      One embodiment of the fully enclosed version, depicted in FIG. 2, takes advantage of the fact that the seat cushions 24 and the backrest 20 of the seats 18 in motorized golf carts are often positioned so as to define a vertical separation 36.
      <br/>
      As a result, the container may be accessed by reaching through this separation and opening a door 38 which is hingedly attached to the forward-facing portion 40 of the container.
      <br/>
      The wire mesh basket version of the container may also be constructed so as to be accessed from between the seat cushions 24 and the backrests 20, as shown in FIG. 1.
      <br/>
      In yet another embodiment of the present invention, pictured in FIG. 4, the door is replaced by a sliding drawer 60, which may also be equipped with a lock 62.
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      Alternatively, the container in its fully enclosed version may be accessed either from a door 42 located on one of the side faces 44 of the container 30 or from a door 46 on its rear face 48.
      <br/>
      Both these embodiments are depicted in FIG. 3.
      <br/>
      In all cases where there are doors, it would, of course, be advantageous to add a lock 50 so that the contents of the container 30 can be secured.
    </p>
