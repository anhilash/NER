      A negative photosensitive resin composition, which comprises a thermosetting polymer precursor which can be cured through cyclodehydration upon heating, and a photosensitive heat cure accelerator.
      <br/>
      This photosensitive heat cure accelerator may be, a compound having a protective substituent group which can be eliminated upon irradiation of light, an N-oxide compound which is capable of exhibiting a heat cure accelerating property through a transition of an oxide group thereof upon irradiation of light, or a compound which is capable of exhibiting a heat cure accelerating property through generation of an acid upon irradiation of light.
      <br/>
      Further, this photosensitive heat cure accelerator may be formed of a combination of a latent heat cure accelerator which is capable of changing into a compound exhibiting a heat cure accelerating property through a reaction with an acid and a photo-acid generating agent which is capable of generating an acid upon irradiation of light.

    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="1">
      This invention relates to a negative photosensitive resin composition which is suited for use in the formation of pattern of insulation film, passivation film,  ALPHA -ray shielding film, optical waveguide and the like, which are employed in various electronic parts.
      <br/>
      This invention relates also to a method of forming a pattern by making use of the aforementioned negative photosensitive resin composition, and to electronic parts provided with an insulation member or protective film member comprising a patterned polymer resin film.
    </p>
    <p num="2">
      In the ordinary semiconductor device comprising a semiconductor substrate, the surface of the semiconductor substrate bearing semiconductor elements is generally covered with a protective film called a passivation film for the purpose of improving the reliability of the semiconductor device by protecting the semiconductor elements from any influence by the outer environment.
      <br/>
      As a material for this passivation film, polyimide resin is extensively employed in view of its excellent properties such as electric properties, e.g. insulating characteristics, radiation resistance, environmental stability and heat resistance.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, this polyimide is widely employed in a semiconductor device as an  ALPHA -ray shielding film, or as an interlayer insulating film for a multilayered wiring structure or for a multilayered element structure (a multichip module).
    </p>
    <p num="3">
      This polyimide can be easily formed into a film from polyamic acid which is a precursor for the polyimide.
      <br/>
      Namely, a varnish of polyamic acid is coated on the surface of a predetermined substrate and then the coated layer is heated to form a film of polyamic acid, which is then heat-treated at a high temperature thereby to cause a cyclodehydration reaction of the polyamic acid to take place, thus curing the polyamic acid film and forming a polyimide film.
      <br/>
      It is possible, with the employment of this method, to easily form a film of polyimide in spite of the fact that polyimide can be hardly worked since it is not or hardly soluble to most of organic solvents and is high in softening point.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the aforementioned method has been widely adopted in the formation of polyimide film.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      Meanwhile, in the manufacture of a semiconductor device, various workings, for example, for forming a through-hole in a multilayered wiring structure or for forming a pad for effecting an electric connection with an external lead are required.
      <br/>
      In order to carry out these workings, a polyimide film formed as a protective film (passivation film) or an interlayer insulating film as explained above is required to be patterned thereby to form holes or grooves of predetermined patterns.
      <br/>
      Generally, the patterning of polyimide film is performed by making use of PEP (photo-engraving process) using a photoresist.
      <br/>
      Namely, after a polyimide film is formed on the surface of a semiconductor substrate bearing a semiconductor element thereon by the aforementioned method, a photoresist film is formed on the surface of the polyimide film and then subjected to a light exposure process followed by a development process thereby forming a resist pattern.
      <br/>
      Then, the underlying polyimide film is selectively etched by making use of this resist pattern as an etching mask thereby to form a polyimide protective film or interlayer insulating film having a prescribed pattern.
    </p>
    <p num="5">However, the aforementioned method of forming a polyimide pattern requires two independent steps, i.e. a step of forming a polyimide film and a step of the PEP, making the method troublesome to carry out.</p>
    <p num="6">
      With a view to solve the aforementioned drawback in carrying out the method, a method of patterning a polyimide film without employing the PEP has been demanded.
      <br/>
      In response to such a demand, a resin composition comprising a polyimide precursor has been proposed.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      For example, Japanese Patent Unexamined Publication S/49-115541 discloses a polyamic ester which can be obtained through a reaction between a diamino compound and tetra-carboxylic diester dichloride.
      <br/>
      Namely, according to this prior art, instead of using tetra-carboxylic dianhydride which is commonly employed in the synthesis of polyamic acid or a polyimide precursor, tetra-carboxylic diester dichloride wherein a photopolymerizable group is introduced through an ester linkage is employed.
      <br/>
      This polyamic ester exhibits a photosensitivity of negative type so that an exposed portion irradiated with light is insolubilized against a developing solution.
      <br/>
      Therefore, it is possible to carry out a patterning in the course of forming a polyimide film without requiring the conventional step of PEP whereby to obtain a patterned polyimide film.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      However, not only the process of synthesizing tetra-carboxylic diester dichloride having a photopolymerizable group, which is a raw material for the polyamic ester, but also the process of synthesizing the polyamic ester are very complicated.
      <br/>
      Moreover, the end resin product to be obtained contains unavoidably chlorine ions as an impurity.
      <br/>
      Additionally, since an organic solvent is employed as a developing solution in the process of developing a polyamic ester film, a large amount of organic solvent is required in the manufacturing line, which is undesirable in viewpoints of safety, sanitation and environment.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, the polyimide film pattern to be obtained may be accompanied with a swelling of pattern due to the development with an organic solvent, thereby deteriorating the resolution of pattern.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      Further, Japanese Patent Publication S/59-52822 discloses, as a photosensitive resin composition of negative type as in the case of aforementioned prior art, a heat resistant photosensitive material containing a compound having a carbon-carbon double bond which is dimerizable or polymerizable by an actinic radiation and an amino group.
      <br/>
      However, this photosensitive material is defective in that, when it is employed as a passivation film for a resin-encapsulated semiconductor device, the adhesivity thereof to a semiconductor substrate, to a passivation film formed of an inorganic material for protecting the surface of substrate, or to a sealing resin is insufficient.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the employment of this photosensitive material may invite a problem that the reliability of semiconductor device thus obtained would be deteriorated.
      <br/>
      Additionally, this photosensitive material requires the employment of an organic solvent as a developing solution as in the case of the aforementioned polyamic ester, which is undesirable in viewpoint of safety.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      On the other hand, Japanese Patent Unexamined Publication S/60-6365 discloses a photosensitive resin composition wherein the carboxylic group of polyamic acid is attached with a methacrylic acid (N,N-dialkylamine) alkyl ester as a salt.
      <br/>
      However, this photosensitive resin composition is defective in that the solubility thereof to a solvent to be used is poor.
    </p>
    <p num="11">
      Any of these photosensitive resin compositions are featured in that the light exposure portion of polyamic acid is crosslinked via the photo-polymerizable group thereof thereby turning it insoluble to a developing solution.
      <br/>
      This crosslinking however accompanies a volumetric shrinkage of the resultant film so that the film will be markedly thinned as a result of the light exposure and development process, and hence it has been difficult to form a polyimide film pattern with a high precision.
    </p>
    <p num="12">
      As mentioned above, a method of forming a polyimide film pattern without any employment of a photoresist has been recently tried with a view to simplifying the manufacturing process, and as a result, a photosensitive composition exhibiting a photosensitivity through the attachment of a photopolymerizable group in the form of ester or salt to the carboxylic group of polyamic acid has been developed.
      <br/>
      However, these conventional photosensitive compositions are accompanied with problems that, due to a structural restriction of polyamic acid, the synthesis thereof is difficult or the adhesivity thereof to a substrate for example is more likely deteriorated, and that, since the polyimide film to be obtained will be markedly thinned as a result of the light exposure and development process, it is difficult to form a polyimide film pattern with a high precision.

    <p num="194">Followings are detailed explanations on the method of forming a pattern by making use of a negative photosensitive resin composition according to this invention.</p>
    <p num="195">
      First of all, a negative photosensitive resin composition prepared as explained above is coated by way of spin coating method for instance on the surface of a substrate, and then dried by heating it with a hot plate for instance at temperature of not more than 180 (degree)  C., more preferably not more than 120 (degree)  C. thereby to obtain a resin layer.
      <br/>
      Since the patterning of the photosensitive resin composition of this invention is carried out by taking advantage of a difference in cyclodehydration reaction ratio between the exposure portions and non-exposure portions that will be resulted from PEB (post exposure bake), the resin layer may be entirely cured and the resolution of the pattern may be deteriorated if the heat drying step of the resin layer is performed at a temperature exceeding over the aforementioned upper limit.
    </p>
    <p num="196">
      Next, a photomask having a predetermined pattern is superimposed on the resin layer formed as described above, and then a visible light, infrared ray, ultraviolet ray or an energy beam such as EB or X-ray is irradiated to the surface of the resin layer through the photomask, thereby exposing the predetermined regions of the resin layer to light.
      <br/>
      The method of this light exposure may be carried out by means of a contact exposure system or by means of a projection exposure system.
    </p>
    <p num="197">
      As a result of this light exposure, the heat cure-accelerating property (or cyclodehydration reaction-accelerating property) of the photosensitive heat cure accelerator is selectively effected on the light exposure portions of the resin layer, and hence the curing of unexposed portions of the resin layer can be inhibited from being cured even if the heat-treatment is performed after the light exposure.
      <br/>
      Namely, in the case of the photosensitive heat cure accelerator of the Group A type, the heat cure-accelerating property (or cyclodehydration reaction-accelerating property) is effected through the elimination of the protective substituent group blocking the hydroxyl group or imino group; in the case of the photosensitive heat cure accelerator of the Group B type, the heat cure-accelerating property (or cyclodehydration reaction-accelerating property) is effected through the production of a compound or skeleton having a heat cure accelerating property, which is resulted from the transition of the N-oxide group; in the case of the photosensitive heat cure accelerator of the Group C type, the heat cure-accelerating property (or cyclodehydration reaction-accelerating property) is effected through the generation of an acid; and in the case of the photosensitive heat cure accelerator of the Group D type, the heat cure-accelerating property (or cyclodehydration reaction-accelerating property) is effected through the elimination of the protective substituent group blocking the hydroxyl group or imino group by the effect of an acid generated from the photo-acid generating agent.
    </p>
    <p num="198">
      Next, in the course of the light exposure process or in subsequent to the light exposure process, the resin layer is subjected to a heat-treatment at a temperature ranging from 50 to 200 (degree)  C. by making use of a hot plate for instance.
      <br/>
      Since the heat cure-accelerating property (or cyclodehydration reaction-accelerating property) of the photosensitive heat cure accelerator is already effected at the light exposure portions of the resin layer, a thermal cure via the cyclodehydration of polyamic acid is further advanced by this heat treatment if a polyamic acid (a polyimide precursor) is employed as a base polymer, thereby forming a polyimide layer.
      <br/>
      By contrast, the curing of the polyamic acid is substantially suppressed at the unexposed portions, thus bringing about a marked difference in solubility in a developing solution of the polymer layer between the exposure portions and non-exposure portions.
      <br/>
      The temperature of this heat treatment should more preferably be in the range of from 80 to 160 (degree)  C. If the resin layer is heated at a low temperature of less than the predetermined temperature in this heat treatment, it is hardly possible to sufficiently utilize the cure-accelerating property of the photosensitive heat cure accelerator, so that the thermal curing of the polymer would hardly proceed even at the light exposure portions.
      <br/>
      On the other hand, if the resin layer is heated at a temperature higher than the predetermined temperature in this heat treatment, the curing of the polymer would prominently proceed even at the unexposed portions.
      <br/>
      Therefore, if the temperature of this heat treatment falls outside the aforementioned range, the resolution of the resultant pattern would be deteriorated, thus making it difficult to form a fine pattern.
      <br/>
      The time required in this heat treatment is, though dependent on the temperature of this heat treatment, generally in the range of 0.5 to 60 minutes, more preferably in the range of 0.5 to 30 minutes.
      <br/>
      If the time for this heat treatment is too short, the thermal curing at the exposure portions would not proceed sufficiently, whereas if the time for this heat treatment is too long, the thermal curing of the polymer would markedly proceed even at the unexposed portions.
      <br/>
      Therefore, if the time for this heat treatment falls outside the aforementioned range, the resolution of the resultant pattern would be deteriorated, thus making it difficult to form a fine pattern.
    </p>
    <p num="199">
      After this heat treatment, the resin layer is subjected to a development process by means of a dipping method, a spray method or a paddle method, using a suitable developing solution.
      <br/>
      As for the developing solution to be utilized in this method, an organic solvent type developing solution or an aqueous alkaline solution type developing solution may be employed.

      Specific examples of such an organic solvent type developing solution are polar organic solvents such as N,N-dimethylformamide, N,N-dimethylacetamide, N,N-diethylacetamide, N,N-dimethoxyacetamide, N-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone, N-acetyl-2-pyrrolidinone, N-benzyl-2-pyrrolidinone, 1,3-dimethyl-2-imidazolidinone, hexamethylphosphoric triamide, dimethylsulfoxide, N-methyl- EPSILON -caprolactam and N-acetyl- EPSILON -caprolactam.
      <br/>
      These solvents may be employed singly or as a mixed solution together with a poor solvent for the polymer, such as methanol, ethanol, isopropyl alcohol, benzene, toluene, xylene, methyl Cellosolve or water.

      Specific examples of such an aqueous alkaline solution type developing solution are an aqueous solution of organic alkali, such as tetramethyl ammonium hydroxide, tetraethyl ammonium hydroxide, choline, propylamine, butylamine, monoethanolethylenediamine, trimethylenediamine, trimethylammonium hydroxide, hydrazine and trimethylhydroxyethylammonium hydroxide; and an aqueous solution of inorganic alkali, such as sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, lithium hydroxide, sodium carbonate, potassium carbonate, ammonium carbonate, hydrogen potassium carbonate, ammonium phosphate and ammonia.

    <p num="202">
      Although the employment of an organic solvent in the developing process may be advantageous in that the contamination with a metallic impurity can be minimized, it is preferable to employ an aqueous alkaline solution type developing solution in view of safety, sanitation and environment.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, if an aqueous alkaline solution type developing solution is employed, the swelling of a polymer film pattern can be avoided.
    </p>
    <p num="203">
      As a result of the developing process as explained, above, the unexposed portions of the resin layer can be dissolved and remove, thus obtaining a negative polymer pattern.
      <br/>
      In particular, since a photosensitive heat cure accelerator which is capable of exhibiting a heat cure-accelerating property (or cyclodehydration reaction-accelerating property) as it is irradiated with light is mixed in the photosensitive resin composition of this invention, if a polyamic acid (a polyimide precursor) is employed as a base polymer, the cyclodehydration reaction of polyamic acid selectively takes place only at the light exposure portions of the resin layer as a result of the heat treatment after the light irradiation, thereby forming a polyimide layer which is insoluble in the developing solution.
      <br/>
      By contrast, the curing of the polyamic acid is substantially suppressed at the unexposed portions, since the heat cure-accelerating property (or cyclodehydration reaction-accelerating property) of the photosensitive heat cure accelerator cannot be brought about at the unexposed portions.
    </p>
    <p num="204">
      Namely, as a result of the heat treatment after the light irradiation, polyimide is formed at the light exposure portions of the resin layer, while polyamic acid is left unchanged at the unexposed portions, thus giving rise to the generation of much difference in solubility to the developing solution between the light-exposed portions and the unexposed portions of the resin layer.
      <br/>
      As a result, only the unexposed portions of the resin layer is selectively dissolved and removed in the developing process, thereby making it possible to form a fine pattern with high resolution.
    </p>
    <p num="205">
      It is preferable in view of removing any residue of developing solution to perform a rinsing of the resin layer after the developing process by making use of water, alcohol or acetone.
      <br/>
      It is also preferable for the purpose of not only drying the developing solution or rinsing solution but also completing the curing of any remaining uncured portions to perform a heat treatment or a vacuum heat treatment at a temperature in the range of 120 to 400 (degree)  C. It is possible with this heat treatment to accomplish the cyclization reaction of polyamic acid and at the same time to allow any solvent component or decomposed materials of the cure accelerator that may be left remained in the patterned layer to be volatilized or sublimed.
      <br/>
      As a result, it is possible to obtain a desired polyimide pattern which is excellent in electric properties, heat resistance and adhesion.
    </p>
    <p num="206">It is possible according to the method of this invention to form a polyimide film without the employment of photoresist and to perform the development process with an aqueous alkaline solution, thus obviating any problems involving safety and environmental pollution.</p>
    <p num="207">
      The patterned polyimide film formed in this manner can be used as an insulating material for forming an interlayer insulating film between conductive or semiconductive layers or for forming a wiring insulation film, or as a protecting material such as a passivation film in the manufacture of many kinds of device, e.g. various kinds of electronic parts, a semiconductor element such as an LSI, a high-density printed wiring board, a thin film magnetic head, magnetic bubble memory, a solar cell, a thermal head.
      <br/>
      It is also possible to utilize the patterned polyimide film formed according to the method of this invention as an optical material for forming an optical waveguide of an optical device, or as an orienting film of liquid crystal device.
      <br/>
      Since, the patterned polyimide film formed in this manner is excellent in adhesion or bonding to substrate in addition to its inherent properties of high heat resistance and low dielectric constant, it is possible to further improve the reliability of electronic parts.
    </p>
    <p num="208">
      The negative polymer pattern formed in this manner according to this invention is also applicable to a fine working technique using a photolithography.
      <br/>
      For example, a negative photosensitive resin composition of this invention may be used for forming a pattern on a predetermined substrate, and then a dry etching or a wet etching is performed in the conventional manner using the aforementioned pattern as an etching mask thereby to carry out the fine working of the substrate.
      <br/>
      In this case, if a fine working of 3  MU m or less (in line width) is desired, a dry etching method may be preferably employed.
    </p>
    <p num="209">
      In the case of wet etching method, various kinds of etching solution can be employed depending on the kinds of film to be etched; i.e. an aqueous solution of hydrofluoric acid or an aqueous solution of ammonium fluoride may be employed for etching a silicon oxide film; an aqueous solution of phosphoric acid, an aqueous solution of acetic acid or aqueous solution of nitric acid may be employed for etching an aluminum film; and an aqueous solution of ammonium cerium nitrate may be employed for etching an chromium-based film.
      <br/>
      In the case of dry etching method, CF4, C2 F6, CCl4, BCl3, Cl2, HCl, H2, etc. may be employed as a dry etching gas.
      <br/>
      These etching gases may be combined if required.
      <br/>
      The conditions for the etching, i.e. the concentration of a wet etching agent in a reaction chamber, the concentration of a dry etching gas in a reaction chamber, reaction temperature and reaction time are determined depending on the combination of the kind of material on which a pattern is formed and on the kind of a photosensitive resin composition.
      <br/>
      There is not any particular limitation regarding the method of etching.
      <br/>
      The pattern formed with a photosensitive resin composition of this invention and remaining on a substrate after an etching may be removed by making use of a release agent (for example, an aqueous solution of hydrazine) or an oxygen gas plasma.
    </p>
    <p num="210">
      Since a negative pattern is formed through the insolubilization of polymer to developing solution without accompanying the crosslinking of polyamic acid in the method of forming a pattern according to this invention, the thinning of film through the volume shrinkage thereof can be avoided, thereby making it possible to assure the accuracy of pattern.
      <br/>
      Moreover, since there is not any particular restriction regarding the structure of polyamic acid, i.e. a polyimide precursor, it is possible to easily form a polyimide film pattern which is excellent in electric properties, in heat resistance and in adhesion.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the photosensitive resin composition of this invention is useful not only for forming an insulating film for various kinds of electronic parts, but also for conducting a fine working on a predetermined substrate.

      As shown in the following Tables 6 to 9, each of the solution of polyamic acid synthesized in the process as mentioned above is mixed with a photosensitive heat cure accelerating agent at a predetermined mixing ratio, and agitated at room temperature to obtain a homogeneous solution.
      <br/>
      The mixed solution was then filtered with a membrane filter having a pore size of 0.5  MU m, thereby to prepare the photosensitive resin compositions of this invention (Examples I-41 to I-80).

      The photosensitive resin compositions thus obtained were then subjected to patterning under the same conditions as mentioned above to evaluate the resolution thereof, the results being summarized in the following Tables 6 and 7.

      As seen from these results, the photosensitive resin compositions of this invention containing a photosensitive heat cure accelerator having a protective substituent group which can be eliminated upon irradiation of light were all exhibited an excellent resolution.
      <br/>
      Namely, when they were subjected to exposure at a dosage of not more than 300 mJ/cm2, it was possible to form an excellent negative pattern of line-and-space having line width of 2.0 to 3.5  MU m, thus suggesting the usefulness thereof for forming a passivation film or wiring-insulation film with high resolution.
      <br/>
      Moreover, the polyimide films obtained by making use of the photosensitive resin compositions according to this invention indicated a sufficient adhesivity to the silicon wafer, and at the same time, exhibited no weight reduction, that might be resulted from a thermal decomposition of resin, even if they were heated up to 450 (degree)  C. The polyimide films obtained by making use of the photosensitive resin compositions according to this invention were found as having a high heat resistance which was comparable to the polyimide films manufactured in a high temperature heating process according to Comparative Examples 12 to 16 to be illustrated hereinafter.

      As shown in the following Tables 18 to 21, each of the solution of polyamic acid synthesized in the process as mentioned above is mixed with a photosensitive heat cure accelerating agent at a predetermined mixing ratio, and agitated at room temperature to obtain a homogeneous solution.
      <br/>
      The mixed solution was then filtered with a membrane filter having a pore size of 0.5  MU m, thereby to prepare the photosensitive resin compositions of this invention (Examples II-1 to II-40).

      As seen from these results, the photosensitive resin compositions of this invention containing a photosensitive heat cure accelerator consisting of an N-oxide compound which is capable of exhibiting heat cure accelerating property through the transition of the oxide group thereof upon irradiation of light were all exhibited an excellent resolution.
      <br/>
      Namely, when they were subjected to exposure at a dosage of not more than 500 mJ/cm2, it was possible to form an excellent negative pattern of line-and-space having line width of 2.0 to 3.0  MU m, thus suggesting the usefulness thereof for forming a passivation film or wiring-insulation film with high resolution.
      <br/>
      Moreover, the polyimide films obtained by making use of the photosensitive resin compositions according to this invention indicated a sufficient adhesivity to the silicon wafer, and at the same time, exhibited no weight reduction, that might be resulted from a thermal decomposition of resin, even if they were heated up to 450 (degree)  C. The polyimide films obtained by making use of the photosensitive resin compositions according to this invention were found as having a high heat resistance which was comparable to the polyimide films manufactured in a high temperature heating process according to Comparative Examples 12 to 14 to be illustrated hereinafter.

      First of all, the photosensitive resin composition was coated on the surface of a silicon substrate (wafer) bearing thereon a pnp type transistor on which a thermal oxide film and electrodes were formed.

Subsequently, the resin layer was exposed through a quartz mask to the irradiation of light at a dosage of 300 mJ/cm2 by making use of a light exposure apparatus (PLA-501FA, Canon Co.).

      Thereafter, the resin layer was rinsed with water for 20 seconds.
