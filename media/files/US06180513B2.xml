    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="1">The present invention relates to an apparatus and method for manufacturing a semiconductor device, particularly, to a pretreatment in preparation for a selective CVD (Chemical Vapor Deposition) treatment for burying W (tungsten) in a contact hole to achieve an electrical connection between a silicon wafer and a conductive layer formed above the wafer surface.</p>
    <p num="2">
      In the manufacture of a semiconductor device having a multi-wiring layer structure, a conductive plug material, e.g., W, is buried in general in a contact hole such as a via-hole connecting upper and lower wiring layers so as to improve the reliability of the upper wiring layer made of, for example, aluminum.
      <br/>
      On the other hand, where W is buried by selective CVD in a contact hole for electrically connecting a first conductive layer, such as a diffusion region formed in a semiconductor substrate, e.g. a Si layer, to a second conductive layer formed above the first conductive layer, it is necessary to form a barrier metal layer on the surface of the first conductive layer (or bottom of the contact hole) in order to prevent the buried W layer from biting the Si layer.
    </p>
    <p num="3">
      FIGS. 1A to 1F are cross sectional views collectively showing schematically the conventional selective CVD method for burying W in a contact hole.
      <br/>
      On the other hand, FIG. 2 a flow chart schematically showing the flow of the required treatments.
      <br/>
      In the first step, a contact hole 3 is formed in an insulating film 2 formed to cover the surface of a silicon wafer 1, as shown in FIG. 1A. Then, a titanium (Ti) film 4 and a titanium nitride (TiN) film 5 are formed successively by a sputtering method on the entire surface including the contact hole 3, as shown in FIG. 1B. The TiN film 5 acts as a cap material serving to prevent the Ti film 4 from being nitrided or oxidized in the subsequent annealing step.
      <br/>
      Then, annealing is applied under a nitrogen gas atmosphere at 200 (degree)  C. or higher so as to achieve silicidation at the interface between the silicon wafer 1 and the Ti film 4.
      <br/>
      As a result, a barrier metal layer 6 made of TiSix is formed at the bottom region of the contact hole 3, as shown in FIG. 1C.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      After formation of the TiSix film 6, the excess Ti film 4 and TiN film 5, which were not involved in the above-noted silicidation, are removed.
      <br/>
      In the subsequent step, a native oxide (SiO2) film 7 formed on the surface of the TiSix film 6 as shown in FIG. 1D is removed as a pretreatment in preparation for the selective CVD treatment for burying W in the contact hole 3.
      <br/>
      Then, a W film 8 is buried in the contact hole 3 by the selective CVD treatment such that the W film 8 is in direct contact with the TiSix film 6 having the native oxide film 7 removed from the surface, as shown in FIG. 1E. Finally, a second conductive layer 9 acting as an upper wiring layer is formed on the entire surface, as shown in FIG. 1F, thereby to achieve a multi-wiring structure in which the silicon wafer (first conductive layer) 1 is electrically connected to the second conductive layer 9 via the W film 8 filling the contact hole 3.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      In the conventional method, however, it is necessary to remove the excess Ti film 4 and the TiN film 5 after formation of the TiSix film 6, as shown in FIG. 2.
      <br/>
      What should also be noted is that the TiSix film 6 soon after formation is exposed to the air atmosphere before the selective CVD treatment for burying W in the contact hole 3, with the result that the native oxide film 7 is formed on the surface of the TiSix film 6.
      <br/>
      Naturally, it is absolutely necessary to remove the native oxide film 7 before deposition of the W film 8.
      <br/>
      Further, a sputtering method is employed for forming the Ti film 4 and the TiN film 5.
      <br/>
      It should be noted in this connection that, where the contact hole 3 has a high aspect ratio, i.e., a ratio of the height to the diameter, the sputtered particles fail to reach sufficiently the bottom of the contact hole 3, resulting in failure to form a TiSix film of a high quality.
    </p>
    <heading>BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="6">
      As described above, a large number of treating steps are required in the conventional method for forming a TiSix film.
      <br/>
      Also, the conventional method necessitates a pretreatment for removing a native oxide film.
      <br/>
      Further, it is difficult to form a TiSix film of a high quality where the film is formed within a contact hole having a high aspect ratio.
    </p>
    <p num="7">A first object of the present invention is to provide an apparatus and method for manufacturing a semiconductor device, which permit markedly decreasing the number of treating steps required for forming a barrier metal layer and also permit forming a high quality barrier metal layer efficiently even if the barrier metal layer is formed within a contact hole having a high aspect ratio.</p>
    <p num="8">A second object of the present invention is to provide a method and apparatus for manufacturing a semiconductor device, which permit decreasing the number of treating steps and also permit markedly simplifying the construction of the apparatus.</p>
    <p num="9">According to a first aspect of the present invention, there is provided an apparatus for manufacturing a semiconductor device, comprising means for forming a barrier metal layer in a bottom portion of a contact hole made through an insulating film formed on a first conductive layer, the barrier metal layer being formed before burying in the contact hole a conductive material layer connected to a second conductive layer and being formed by a plasma CVD method using, as a source gas, a gas containing a substance capable of self-alignment with the first conductive layer.</p>
    <p num="10">According to a second aspect of the present invention, there is provided an apparatus for manufacturing a semiconductor device, comprising:</p>
    <p num="11">means for forming a barrier metal layer at a bottom portion of a contact hole formed through an insulating film for insulation between a first conductive layer and a second conductive layer, the barrier metal layer being formed before burying a conductive material in the contact hole and being formed by a plasma CVD method using, as a source gas, a gas containing a substance capable of self-alignment with the first conductive layer; and</p>
    <p num="12">means for consecutively forming a film of the conductive material by a selective CVD method on the barrier metal layer formed in the bottom portion of the contact hole.</p>
    <p num="13">According to a third aspect of the present invention, there is provided a method of manufacturing a semiconductor device, comprising the step of forming a barrier metal layer in a bottom portion of a contact hole made through an insulating film formed on a first conductive layer, the barrier metal layer being formed before burying in the contact hole a conductive material layer connected to a second conductive layer and being formed by a plasma CVD method using, as a source gas, a gas containing a substance capable of self-alignment with the first conductive layer.</p>
    <p num="14">Further, according to a fourth aspect of the present invention, there is provided a method of manufacturing a semiconductor device, comprising the steps of:</p>
    <p num="15">forming a barrier metal layer at a bottom portion of a contact hole formed through an insulating film for insulation between a first conductive layer and a second conductive layer, the barrier metal layer being formed before burying in the contact hole a conductive material and being formed by a plasma CVD method using, as a source gas, a gas containing a substance capable of self-alignment with the first conductive layer; and</p>
    <p num="16">consecutively forming a film of the conductive material by a selective CVD method on the barrier metal layer formed in the bottom portion of the contact hole.</p>
    <p num="17">
      The apparatus and method of the present invention permit forming a barrier metal layer by self-alignment with a first conductive layer.
      <br/>
      As a result, formation of the barrier metal layer can be simplified.
      <br/>
      In addition, the barrier metal layer can be formed in a bottom portion of a contact hole without fail regardless of the aspect ratio of the contact hole.
      <br/>
      Further, a conductive material can be buried in the contact hole immediately after formation of the barrier metal layer.
      <br/>
      In other words, the barrier metal layer is not exposed to the air atmosphere before the step of burying the conductive material in the contact hole.
      <br/>
      It follows that it is unnecessary to employ a pretreatment for removing a native oxide film before the step of burying a conductive material in the contact hole.

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="20">
      Let us describe some embodiments of the present invention with reference to the accompanying drawings.
      <br/>
      Specifically, FIG. 3 schematically shows the construction of an apparatus for manufacturing a semiconductor device.
      <br/>
      As shown in the drawing, the apparatus comprises an L/UL chamber 11 for loading/unloading silicon wafers, a Ti chamber 21 for forming a TiSix film acting as a barrier layer in a bottom portion of a contact hole formed through an insulating film covering the surface of the silicon wafer, and a W chamber 31 for burying a plug material of tungsten (conductive material) in the contact hole in direct contact with the TiSix film.
      <br/>
      These Ti chamber 21 and W chamber 31 are connected to each other via a transfer chamber 41.
      <br/>
      Further, a valve 51 for maintaining a high vacuum within the L/UL chamber 11 is arranged between the L/UL chamber 11 and the transfer chamber 41.
      <br/>
      Likewise, other valves 51 are arranged between the Ti chamber 21 and the transfer chamber 41 and between the W chamber 31 and the transfer chamber 41, respectively, for maintaining a high vacuum within each of these Ti chamber 21 and W chamber 31.
      <br/>
      Further, an exhaust port 12 is formed in the L/UL chamber 11.
    </p>
    <p num="21">
      A plasma CVD treatment is performed within the Ti chamber 21 for forming a TiSix film by self-alignment on the surface of a silicon wafer.
      <br/>
      In the plasma CVD treatment, an inert gas, i.e., Ar gas, is used as a carrier gas, and a TiCl4 gas containing Ti is used as a source gas.
      <br/>
      The Ti chamber 21 includes a carrier gas line 22 for supplying the Ar gas, a source gas line 23 for supplying the TiCl4 gas, an exhaust port 24 for releasing the gas remaining within the Ti chamber 21 to the outside, and a heating mechanism 25 for heating the Si wafer to a reaction temperature of at least 300 (degree)  C. required for forming the TiSix film.
      <br/>
      The heating mechanism 25 can be of any desired type as far as the Si wafer can be heated to 300 (degree)  C. or higher.
      <br/>
      For example, it is possible to use an infrared lamp or a hot plate.
      <br/>
      It is also possible to use an infrared lamp and a hot plate in combination for forming the heating mechanism 25.
      <br/>
      In the case of employing a hot plate, it is desirable to use an electrostatic chuck or vacuum chuck for holding the Si wafer in order to improve the uniformity of temperature over the entire region of the wafer.
    </p>
    <p num="22">
      The W chamber 31 is for forming a W film by a selective CVD method on the TiSix film positioned within the contact hole.
      <br/>
      Used for the selective CVD method are a WF6 gas and a SiH4 gas.
      <br/>
      The W chamber 31 includes a gas line 32 for supplying the WF6 gas, another gas line 33 for supplying the SiH4 gas, an exhaust port 34 for releasing the gases remaining within the W chamber 31 to the outside, and a heating mechanism 35 for heating the Si wafer to temperatures required for depositing the W film, said temperature falling within a range of between room temperature and about 400 (degree)  C. The heating mechanism 35 can be of any desired type as far as it is possible to control the temperature of the Si wafer to fall within a range of between room temperature and about 400 (degree)  C. For example, an infrared lamp or a hot plate can be used as the heating mechanism 35.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, an infrared lamp and a hot plate can be used in combination to constitute the heating mechanism 35.
      <br/>
      In the case of employing a hot plate, it is desirable to use an electrostatic chuck or vacuum chuck for holding the Si wafer in order to improve the uniformity of temperature over the entire region of the wafer.
    </p>
    <p num="23">
      The Si wafer set in the L/UL chamber 11 is taken into the transfer chamber 41 and, then, transferred into the Ti chamber 21.
      <br/>
      Also, the Si wafer having a TiSix film formed therein in the Ti chamber 21 is received by the transfer chamber 41 and, then, transferred into the W chamber 31.
      <br/>
      Further, the Si wafer having a W film buried therein within the W chamber 31 is received by the transfer chamber 41 and, then, transferred into the L/UL chamber 11.
      <br/>
      As seen from the drawing, the transfer chamber 41 includes an exhaust port 42.
    </p>
    <p num="24">
      The manufacturing apparatus of the construction described above is used for burying the W film 8 in the contact hole 3 as follows.
      <br/>
      It should be noted that FIGS. 4A to 4D collectively show the steps required for burying the W film 8 in the contact hole 3 as shown in FIG. 4D. In the first step, the Si wafer 1 having the contact hole 3 formed through the insulating film 2 covering the surface as shown in FIG. 4A is set in the L/UL chamber 11 communicating with the air atmosphere.
      <br/>
      Then, the L/UL chamber 11 is evacuated to a high vacuum substantially equal to that in the transfer chamber 41.
      <br/>
      Under this condition, the Si wafer 1 set in the L/UL chamber 11 is transferred via the transfer chamber 41 into the Ti chamber 21 and, then, heated to 300 (degree)  C. or higher by the heating mechanism 25 arranged within the Ti chamber 21.
      <br/>
      Then, a plasma CVD is applied to the wafer 1 using an Ar gas supplied through the carrier gas line 22 as a carrier gas and a TiCl4 gas supplied through the source gas supply line 23 as a source gas.
      <br/>
      As a result, the Si in the wafer 1 is self-aligned with the Ti in the TiCl4 gas at the interface of the wafer 1 so as to form the TiSix film 6 at the bottom portion of the contact hole 3, as shown in FIG. 4B. Incidentally, the plasma CVD causes Ti precipitation.
      <br/>
      However, the TiSix film of high quality can be obtained by finishing the plasma CVD before the Ti precipitation.
    </p>
    <p num="25">
      The wafer 1 having the TiSix film 6 formed therein is transferred without being exposed to the air atmosphere via the transfer chamber 41 into the W chamber 31.
      <br/>
      The temperature of the wafer 1 transferred into the W chamber 31 is controlled by the heating mechanism 35 to fall within a range of between room temperature and about 400 (degree)  C. Under this condition, a selective CVD is performed using a WF6 gas supplied through the gas line 32 and a SiH4 gas supplied through the gas line 33.
      <br/>
      As a result, W is selectively deposited on the TiSix film 6 formed at the bottom portion of the contact hole 3 so as to permit the W film 8 to be buried in the contact hole 3, as shown in FIG. 4C. It should be noted that the wafer 1 after formation of the TiSix film 6 is transferred into the W chamber 31 without being exposed to the air atmosphere, as already pointed out.
      <br/>
      It follows that the W film 8 can be formed immediately after formation of the TiSix film 6.
    </p>
    <p num="26">
      To be more specific, since the TiSix film 6 and the W film 8 are consecutively formed within the chambers 21 and 31, respectively, which are maintained at a high vacuum, it is impossible for a native oxide film to be formed on the surface of the TiSix film 6.
      <br/>
      Needless to say, it is unnecessary to employ a process for removing the native oxide film from the surface of the TiSix film 6.
      <br/>
      It is also unnecessary to use an equipment for removing the native oxide film such as an etching device using BCl3 or an annealing device.
      <br/>
      In addition, since plasma CVD is employed for forming the TiSix film 6, the film 6 can be formed in a perfectly desired form regardless of the aspect ratio of the contact hole.
      <br/>
      In other words, the TiSix film 6 of high quality can be formed even if the contact hole has a high aspect ratio.
    </p>
    <p num="27">
      After deposition of the W film 8, the wafer 1 is transferred via the transfer chamber 41 into the L/UL chamber 11.
      <br/>
      Then, the L/UL chamber 11 is allowed to communicate with the air atmosphere, and the wafer 1 is taken out of the chamber 11.
      <br/>
      Further, after deposition of the W film 8 within the contact hole 3, the second conductive layer 9 made of, for example, Al is formed as an upper wiring layer, as shown in FIG. 4D. As apparent from the drawing, the Si wafer 1 is electrically connected to the second conductive layer 9 via the W film 8 filling the contact hole 3 so as to achieve a multi-wiring layer structure.
    </p>
    <p num="28">
      FIG. 5 schematically shows the flow of the treatments required for depositing the W film 8.
      <br/>
      As already pointed out, the TiSix film 6 is formed by a plasma CVD method in the present invention.
      <br/>
      As a result, the number of treating steps can be markedly decreased, as apparent from comparison between FIG. 5 and FIG. 2 directed to the conventional method.
      <br/>
      Specifically, the method of the present invention makes it unnecessary to employ the annealing treatment for silicidation, and the steps for removing the excess Ti film which is not involved in the silicidation and for removing the cap material of the TiN film.
      <br/>
      Further, the treating steps ranging between formation of the TiSix film 6 and deposition of the W film 8 can be performed within a single apparatus while keeping the state of a high vacuum.
      <br/>
      Naturally, the pretreatment required in the conventional method, i.e., treatment to remove a native oxide film from the surface of the TiSix film 6, need not be employed before the step of burying W in the contact hole by a selective CVD method.
      <br/>
      Needless to say, it is also unnecessary to use an apparatus for removing such a native oxide film.
    </p>
    <p num="29">
      It should be noted that Ti is also precipitated in the step of forming the TiSix film 6 by the plasma CVD method, if the plasma CVD treatment is performed for an unduly long time.
      <br/>
      FIG. 6 shows the relationship between the thickness of each of the TiSix film and the Ti film and the treating time.
      <br/>
      As apparent from FIG. 6, the TiSix film 6 begins to be precipitated immediately after initiation of the plasma CVD treatment.
      <br/>
      On the other hand, the Ti film begins to be precipitated about 90 seconds after initiation of the plasma CVD treatment.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the plasma CVD treatment for forming the TiSix film 6 is performed for less than 90 seconds in the present invention, making it possible to form the TiSix film 6 alone without bringing about precipitation of Ti on the insulating film 2 and on the TiSix film 6.
      <br/>
      In conclusion, the time for the plasma CVD treatment is controlled appropriately in the present invention so as to form very easily the TiSix film 6 of high quality.
    </p>
    <p num="30">
      As described above, the apparatus and method of the present invention make it possible to form a TiSix film without fail in a bottom portion of a contact hole regardless of the aspect ratio of the contact hole.
      <br/>
      To reiterate, a plasma CVD treatment using a TiCl4 gas as a source gas is employed in the present invention.
      <br/>
      As a result, the self-alignment between Si in the substrate and Ti in the source gas is utilized in the present invention to form a TiSix film in a bottom portion of the contact hole.
      <br/>
      The particular technique permits markedly decreasing the number of treating steps required for forming the TiSix film, compared with the conventional method utilizing a sputtering method.
      <br/>
      In addition, a TiSix film of a high quality can be formed in a contact hole, even if the contact hole has a high aspect ratio.
      <br/>
      Further, the wafer having a TiSix film formed therein is transferred into the chamber for subsequently burying a W film in the contact hole.
      <br/>
      What should be noted is that the wafer is not exposed to the air atmosphere during the transfer into the particular chamber, making it unnecessary to employ the pretreatment required in the conventional method for removing the native oxide film.
      <br/>
      It follows that the technical idea of the present invention permits markedly simplifying the construction of the apparatus for manufacturing a semiconductor device.
    </p>
    <p num="31">
      In the embodiment described above, a TiSix film and a W film are formed in a single Si wafer in different chambers so as to prevent the reactant gases for the CVD treatments from being mixed together.
      <br/>
      However, it is also possible to construct the apparatus such that the TiSix film and the W film can be formed within the same chamber.
    </p>
    <p num="32">
      FIG. 7 schematically shows the construction of an apparatus for manufacturing a semiconductor device according to another embodiment of the present invention.
      <br/>
      As apparent from the drawing, the apparatus comprises a Ti/W chamber 61 for successively forming the TiSix film 6 and the W film 8 in addition to the L/UL chamber 11 for loading/unloading the Si wafer 1 and the valve 51 for keeping a high vacuum within each of the Ti/W chamber 61 and the L/UL chamber 11.
      <br/>
      Needless to say, the Ti/W chamber 61 performs the function of the Ti chamber for forming the TiSix film 6 at a bottom portion of the contact hole 3 formed through the insulating film 2 covering the wafer 1 and the function of the W chamber for forming the W film on the TiSix film 6.
    </p>
    <p num="33">
      Connected to the Ti/W chamber 61 are a carrier gas line 62 for supplying a carrier gas such as an Ar gas into the chamber 61, source gas lines 63, 64 and 65 for supplying a TiCl4 gas, a WF gas, and a SiH4 gas, respectively, into the chamber 61, and an exhaust port 66 for discharging the gases remaining within the chamber 61 to the outside.
      <br/>
      Further, a heating mechanism 67 is arranged within the Ti/W chamber 61 for heating the wafer to temperatures required for forming the TiSix film 6, i.e., 300 (degree)  C. or higher, and for forming the W film 8, i.e., room temperature to about 400 (degree)  C. The heating mechanism 67 can be of any desired type as far as it is possible to control the temperature of the Si wafer to meet the requirements given above.
      <br/>
      For example, an infrared lamp or a hot plate can be used as the heating mechanism 67.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, an infrared lamp and a hot plate can be used in combination to constitute the heating mechanism 67.
      <br/>
      In the case of employing a hot plate, it is desirable to use an electrostatic chuck or vacuum chuck for holding the Si wafer in order to improve the uniformity of temperature over the entire region of the wafer.
      <br/>
      Of course, the apparatus shown in FIG. 7 produces prominent effects similar to those produced by the apparatus shown in FIG. 3.
      <br/>
      In addition, the apparatus shown in FIG. 7 is very compact, compared with the apparatus shown in FIG. 3.

      Each of the embodiments described above is directed to formation of a conductive layer within a contact hole.
      <br/>
      However, the technical idea of the present invention can also be used for forming a conductive layer in, for example, a via hole or a through hole so as to achieve an electrical connection between upper and lower wiring layers.
      <br/>
      Further, the present invention can be worked in various other fashions within the technical scope of the present invention.
