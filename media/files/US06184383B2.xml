    <heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="1">
      The present invention relates to a method of producing a compound having an acetal skeleton, with good efficiency and a high yield.
      <br/>
      The compound is useful for a photographic coupler, or as an intermediate in a variety of organic synthesis.
    </p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">
      Hitherto, synthesis of acetals having the structure shown below has not been sufficiently studied.
      <br/>
      One general method therefor is described in JP-A-5-313322 ("JP-A" means an unexamined published Japanese patent application).  (Chemical Structure image '2' not included in text)
    </p>
    <p num="3">Specifically, as shown in scheme (I) below, it was a method wherein (A) was subjected to methylolation with paraformaldehyde, to synthesize (B), and the resultant (B) was reacted with mercapto azole in the presence of zinc iodide, to obtain (C) as an objective product.  (Chemical Structure image '3' not included in text)</p>
    <p num="4">However, the above-described method had such problems that</p>
    <p num="5">
      (i) Two steps are necessary to obtain the object,
      <br/>
      (ii) The yield is low in each of the steps,
      <br/>
      (iii) It is extremely difficult to isolate (B) using a means other than column purification, because (B) of an intermediate is synthesized with a low yield and poor crystallinity,
      <br/>
      (iv) Paraformaldehyde is adhered onto a cooling tube during the synthesis of (B), and
      <br/>
      (v) Unless the purity of (B) is increased, the synthesis reaction of (C) does not go well.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      Compared to such a conventional method, JP-A-5-331145 describes a method in which a reaction is efficiently carried out using a metal salt, whose typical example is copper bromide, as a catalyst.
      <br/>
      However, this method still has such problems that
      <br/>
      (1) The yield is not satisfactory, and
      <br/>
      (2) It causes a heavy load on environment, at the dealing and disposal of metal salt (heavy metal) used as a catalyst.

    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="7">An object of the present invention is to provide a method of producing acetal compounds, with good efficiency and high yield, which method improves the above-mentioned drawbacks of the conventional methods.</p>

      <br/>
      Further, a plurality of solvents may be used in a mixture, or alternatively the reaction may be carried out in the absence of a solvent.
      <br/>
      When a solvent is used, hydrocarbon-series solvents (e.g. benzene, toluene, hexane) and halogen-series solvents (e.g. methylene chloride, chloroform, chlorobenzene, 1,2-dichloroethane) are preferred, in viewpoints of reactivity and suppression of by-products.

      <br/>
      Generally, the reaction is carried out in the range of 1 hour to 15 hours, and preferably in the range of 2 hours to 10 hours.
    </p>
    <p num="36">
      As a post-treatment of the reaction, after completion of the reaction, a reaction solution can be washed, and then the resulting organic layer can be concentrated.
      <br/>
      An object can be frequently isolated by adding a suitable solvent into the thus-obtained residue.
      <br/>
      Further, alternatively the residue obtained by concentrating the organic layer can be purified by usual treatment methods, such as distillation, and a column purification using a silica gel or the like.

      According to the method of the present invention, synthesis can be performed in one step.
      <br/>
      Compared to conventional synthesis method using a metal salt, particularly a heavy metal salt, the method of the present invention not only provides remarkable improvement in yield, it also makes it possible to remove the load of environmental pollution caused by disposal of a heavy metal.
      <br/>
      Further, according to the present invention, a turbidity component that generates when a metal salt is used, does not appear, and therefore post-treatment and purification steps can be simplified or omitted.
