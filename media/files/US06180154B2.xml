      A natural, red-hue colorant that is substantially free of alkaloids and polyphenoloxidase, has good stability, minimal aroma, and does not contain any organic solvent residuals is provided.
      <br/>
      The natural colorant has a red-hue equivalent to the red-hue of FD&amp;C Red No. 40 and is more stable as compared to existing natural colorants.
      <br/>
      Methods for extracting anthocyanin pigments from red-fleshed potatoes without use of an organic solvent, while essentially eliminating alkaloids and polyphenoloxidase from the extract are also provided.
      <br/>
      Potatoes are pressed and filtered and the filtrate (i.e., potato juice containing potato anthocyanin pigments) is concentrated.
      <br/>
      The pH of the concentrate is adjusted with alkali to precipitate alkaloids therein.
      <br/>
      The concentrate is filtered and the pH of the filtrate is adjusted to a pH value of about 3.5 or lower.
      <br/>
      The pH is adjusted in such a manner to obtain a colorant having the desired red-hue color and intensity (i.e., a natural colorant having a red-hue equivalent to FD&amp;C Red No. 40).

    <heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="1">The present invention pertains to a natural red colorant for use as an additive to foodstuffs, beverages, pharmaceuticals, toiletries, and the like.</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND AND SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">
      Colorants in foods are either natural pigments or synthetic compounds.
      <br/>
      There is a need for natural red-hue colorants that can serve as an alternative to the existing red-hue colorants, such as, FD&amp;C Red No. 40, for use as an additive to foodstuffs, beverages, pharmaceuticals, toiletries, and the like.
      <br/>
      Various colorants have been produced by extraction of various fruits and vegetables.
      <br/>
      For example, in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,452,822 and 4,500,556, anthocyanins are extracted from grape pomace to produce a colorant.
      <br/>
      However, such colorant extracts include residual organic compound residues due to the manner of extraction and do not possess a red-hue equivalent to FD&amp;C Red No. 40.
    </p>
    <p num="3">
      Red cabbage and purple carrots have also been extracted to obtain natural colorants.
      <br/>
      Both the red cabbage and purple carrot extracts, however, do not provide a red-hue colorant equivalent to the red hue of FD&amp;C Red No. 40. Anthocyanins have also been extracted from radishes to provide a red-hue colorant.
      <br/>
      However, the radish extracts possess a relatively strong and unpleasant flavor (and odor) due to the presence of glucosinolate break-down products, making the radish colorant undesirable for foodstuffs and beverages.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      There has been some (unsuccessful) research regarding the use of various potato extracts as a source for natural colorants.
      <br/>
      Some of the research has been directed to potato cultivars rich in anthocyanin pigments, but the extract is of a purple hue rather than a red hue.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      Natural fruit and vegetable juices have been approved by the FDA as colorants as long as a physical separation or extraction of the colorants is performed.
      <br/>
      That is, chemical separation means cannot be used to separate the colorants, only physical separation processes, such as by dehydration, concentration, and membrane-separation technology.
      <br/>
      Aqueous fruit and vegetable extractions are also considered physical separations of the colorant.
      <br/>
      Thus, it is relatively easy and inexpensive to obtain FDA approval for such "natural colorants."
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      It may be possible to prepare a relatively stable, red-potato anthocyanin extract by absorption of potato extract on a C-18 silica resin.
      <br/>
      Such extractions, however, have not previously been performed because subsequent extraction with an acidic alcohol is necessary.
      <br/>
      The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has very strict standards and requirements for approval of such a colorant extract for use as food colorants because organic solvents are used for the extraction process (i.e., a chemical separation process is used).
      <br/>
      The organic solvent extraction typically leaves residual amounts of the organic solvent in the extract.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, if such a chemical separation process is used, the FDA requires extensive and costly toxicological and safety tests be performed before such a colorant could be considered and possibly approved by the FDA.
      <br/>
      Even then, it may not be possible to sufficiently remove the organic solvent residuals from the extract such that the extract could be used as a food colorant.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      Potato anthocyanins have not been used as colorants because potatoes, both cultivated and wild potatoes, contain steroidal glycoalkaloids.
      <br/>
      Specifically, steroidal glycoalkaloids ("SGAs" or "alkaloids"), a class of nitrogen containing compounds that possess the C27 skeleton of cholestane, are present in cultivated and wild potatoes.
      <br/>
      The major alkaloids in commercial potatoes are  ALPHA -solanine and  ALPHA -chaconine, which are glycosylated derivatives of the aglycone solanidine.
      <br/>
      Potato breeding typically introduces desired traits (e.g., frost, disease, and pest resistance) but tends to result in increased concentrations of such alkaloids.
      <br/>
      Alkaloids are natural toxins in potatoes that probably evolved as protective compounds in response to tissue invasion.
      <br/>
      Alkaloids have antimicrobial, insecticidal, and fungicidal properties that provide resistance against several insect pests and herbivores.

      A problem in extracting anthocyanin from potatoes is that the anthocyanin extract of the potatoes also contains such alkaloids.

      Further, potatoes contain polyphenoloxidase (PPO) which also presents a problem when extracting anthocyanin pigments from potatoes for use as colorants.
      <br/>
      That is, the extract would likely contain such PPO.
      <br/>
      PPO, polymerized phenolics, react with anthocyanin pigments, accelerating degradation of the anthocyanin colorant to produce an undesirable browning of the extract.

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
    <p num="18">
      The present invention provides a natural, red-hue colorant that is substantially or completely free of alkaloids, polyphenoloxidase, and glucosinolate break-down products.
      <br/>
      The disclosed natural colorant also has good stability, minimal aroma, minimal or no taste, and does not contain any organic solvent residuals.
      <br/>
      The disclosed natural colorant has a red-hue equivalent to the red-hue of FD&amp;C Red No. 40 and is more stable than most existing natural colorants.
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      As defined herein, a "natural colorant" is a colorant suitable for food and beverage applications, is derived solely from natural pigments, contains no synthetic dyes, lakes or residual organic solvents, and is obtained by use of physical separation processes.
      <br/>
      Also as defined herein, a red-hue colorant equivalent to FD&amp;C Red No. 40 is a colorant that has about the same color parameters as FD&amp;C Red No. 40 (but not necessarily at the same colorant concentration levels).
      <br/>
      The color parameters of FD&amp;C Red No. 40 vary with the concentration of the Red No. 40 solution.
      <br/>
      At a concentration of 1.5 mg/100 mL of FD&amp;C Red No. 40, the color characteristics are as follows: lightness value (L*) is equal to about 67, chroma is equal to about 65, and a hue angle of about 38 degrees.
      <br/>
      As used herein, a pH value below 7 is acidic, a pH of 7 is neutral, and a pH over 7 is alkaline or basic.
    </p>
    <p num="20">
      As shown in the process flow chart of FIG. 1, a method of the present invention provides the natural, red-hue colorant of the present invention, through extraction of red-fleshed potatoes.
      <br/>
      Although any red-fleshed potato may be used to practice the method of the present invention, the following types of potato cultivars have been determined to be useful in practicing the methods of the present invention: NDC4069-4, ND5538-2, ND5849-1, 6236-1, 6236-2, 4239, NDOP5847-1, NDOP5847-2, NDOP5849-3, NDOP5589-1, NDOP5589-2, NDOP5538-1, NDOP5538-2, NDOP 5538-3, NDOP5538-4, NDOP5538-5, NDOP5538-6, NDOP5538-7, NDOP5538-8, NDOP5538-9, NDOP5538-10, NDOP5538-11, NDOP5538-12, NDOP5538-13, ND3261-5R, Huckleberry, All Red, Blossom, Levitts Pink, Cherry Jubilee, Wayru, Leque chaki, and Pokko lomocho potato cultivars.
      <br/>
      The concentration of glycoalkaloids in red-flesh potatoes vary among potato cultivars.
      <br/>
      Those cultivars with the highest levels of anthocyanin pigment typically have lower glycoalkaloid content, making such cultivars preferable for use as extract sources for the present natural colorant compositions.
      <br/>
      Potato clones NDOP5847-1 and NDC4069-4 have relatively high anthocyanin concentrations (typically about 40mg/100 g tuber).
    </p>
    <p num="21">
      Suitable fresh potato cultivars are washed with cold water to eliminate extraneous matter.
      <br/>
      The potatoes may be refrigerated at from about 5 (degree)  C. to about 10 (degree)  C. until they are to be extracted or may be extracted immediately following the wash.
      <br/>
      Low temperature storage of the potatoes (i.e., less than about 10 (degree)  C.) helps to control sprout growth, reduces senescent sweetening, and minimizes storage diseases.
      <br/>
      Storage at temperatures less than about 5 (degree)  C. may cause undesirable accumulation of sugars through the hydrolysis of starch.
      <br/>
      Accumulation of sugars will limit the anthocyanin concentration process.
    </p>
    <p num="22">
      Although it may be less efficient to attempt to extract a whole potato, a whole potato may be used if it can be blended by a blender or the like.
      <br/>
      If the potato is cut into smaller pieces for extraction, the pieces are preferably placed in acidified water to prevent enzymatic browning.
      <br/>
      The potato pieces are contacted by acidified water to "inactivate" or "retard" polyphenoloxidase present in the potatoes.
      <br/>
      Inactivation of the polyphenoloxidase avoids browning of the extract (i.e., the potato juice) and provides better pigment colorant stability.
      <br/>
      As defined herein, inactivation of the polyphenoloxidase refers to the minimalizing of browning reactions and pigment degradation due to the polyphenoloxidase.
    </p>
    <p num="23">
      The acidified water is preferably at a pH value of less than 4.5 and more preferably less than 3.5. Good results have been obtained when the acidified water had a pH value of about 3 0 (slashed zero)  Acidified water having higher pH values (e.g., equal to or above about 4.5) tends to cause degradation of the potato anthocyanin pigment.
      <br/>
      The water may be acidified using any suitable acid as known to those persons skilled in the art.
      <br/>
      For example, phosphoric acid or hydrochloric acid may be used to acidify the water.
      <br/>
      For example, good results are obtained when potato slices are blended in a 0.3 NH3 PO4 solution at a 1/1 wt/vol ratio.
      <br/>
      The acidified water should have the buffering capacity to prevent changes in pH value of the potato/acidified water solution.
      <br/>
      Red-fleshed potatoes typically have a pH value of about 6.0, which increases the pH of the solution if the solution is not sufficiently buffered.
      <br/>
      The resulting browning reactions tend to destroy the monomeric anthocyanins present.
    </p>
    <p num="24">
      Following contact with the acidified water, the potato pieces (or blended potato) are pressed using a conventional juice hydraulic press.
      <br/>
      The potato juice pressed from the potatoes is then filtered using conventional filtering techniques, such as diatomeceous earth filtration.
      <br/>
      The filtrate (i.e., the filtered potato juice) is then blanched, preferably at about 93 (degree)  C. (200 (degree)  F.) for about 10 minutes.
      <br/>
      As known to those persons skilled in the art, a range of temperatures and times may be used to blanch the filtrate.
      <br/>
      The filtrate may be blanched by hot water or steam-direct scalding treatment or any other suitable technique as known to persons skilled in the art.
      <br/>
      Blanching the filtrate inactivates any residual polyphenoloxidase and precipitates proteins and colloidal matter present in the filtrate.
    </p>
    <p num="25">
      The blanched filtrate is again filtered to remove precipitants and is also, preferably centrifuged.
      <br/>
      The second filtration and centrifugation removes the precipitated proteins and colloidal matter to provide a filtrate free of any polyphenoloxidase.
      <br/>
      The blanched filtrate still, however, contains undesirable alkaloids along with the desired anthocyanin pigments.
    </p>
    <p num="26">
      Following filtration, the filtrate is examined for the presence of any remaining starch.
      <br/>
      Most, if not all, of the starch present in the filtrate is preferably removed therefrom.
      <br/>
      During the alkaloid precipitation process (discussed below) the concentrated extract is heated under alkaline condition.
      <br/>
      Heating under alkaline conditions causes gelatinization of residual starch.
      <br/>
      As a result, a gel will form upon cooling.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, preferably most (if not all) of the starch is removed from the filtrate using means known to those persons skilled in the art.
    </p>
    <p num="27">
      The resulting filtrate is then concentrated by conventional technique.
      <br/>
      Concentration by thermal evaporation under vacuum conditions using a Alfa-Laval CENTRITHERM (tm)  concentrator has been found to be effective.
      <br/>
      However, the filtrate may be concentrated by any number of methods as known to those persons skilled in the art.
      <br/>
      The concentration of the filtrate should not be at temperatures that are so high, or for periods of time that are so long, that degradation of the anthocyanin pigments takes place.
      <br/>
      Time and temperature conditions for concentration of an extract are variable depending upon the equipment and the technology used for the concentration process.
      <br/>
      Use of a CENTRITHERMTM concentrator at a temperature range of from about 50 (degree)  C. to about 60 (degree)  C. with a residence time of about 10 to 20 minutes has been found to be effective.
      <br/>
      Concentration of the filtrate increases the concentration of the alkaloids in solution, which improves later precipitation of the same.
      <br/>
      Further, concentrated levels of anthocyanins typically have a stabilizing effect on the anthocyanin pigments, likely due to intermolecular co-pigmentation.
    </p>
    <p num="28">
      As stated above, adjustment of the concentrate to a basic pH value has not heretofore been practiced to obtain a natural colorant from a potato extract.
      <br/>
      Such alkaline pH adjustment of an anthocyanin extract has been avoided in the past because alkali is known to saponify the acylated anthocyanins and accelerate degradation of the anthocyanins, such that the anthocyanin pigment extract would no longer be suitable as a colorant.
      <br/>
      In the method of the present invention, however, the conditions for the pH adjustment of the concentrate have been optimized to maximize alkaloid precipitation while minimizing the anthocyanin saponification and degradation, thereby providing a colorant having a red-hue equivalent to FD&amp;C Red No. 40, without the presence of a significant amount of alkaloid.
    </p>
    <p num="29">
      Specifically, the pH of the concentrate is carefully adjusted with alkali to precipitate alkaloids therein but to avoid degradation of the anthocyanin pigments.
      <br/>
      The pH is adjusted to a value of from about 7.6 to about 9 0 (slashed zero)  If the pH value of the concentrate is adjusted to a pH value that is too high, there is significant degradation of the anthocyanin pigment (and, hence, of the eventual colorant obtained).
      <br/>
      At a pH value of greater than about 9.0, there is about a 60% to about a 80% loss in anthocyanin pigmentation (i.e., a 60% to 80% decrease in monomeric anthocyanin pigment concentration or destruction of the pg-3-rut-5-glu acylated with p-coumaric acid).
      <br/>
      At a pH value of about 9.5 or greater, there is severe anthocyanin pigment degradation, resulting in up to 90% destruction of the monomeric anthocyanin pigment concentration (i.e., pg-3-rut-5-glu acylated with p-coumaric acid).
    </p>
    <p num="30">
      If the pH value is too low, however, the alkaloids are not sufficiently precipitated.
      <br/>
      For example, an adjustment to a pH value of about 6 will not result in any significant amount of alkaloid precipitation, while adjustment to a pH value of 7.5 or less typically does not result in a sufficient amount of alkaloid precipitation.
      <br/>
      The alkaloid content of the resulting colorant must be sufficiently low to meet FDA restrictions.
      <br/>
      Adjustment to a pH value of about 8.0 has been found to be especially useful.
      <br/>
      Adjustment of the pH to a value of about 8.0 typically causes precipitation of about 90% of the alkaloids without significant anthocyanin degradation or changes in the pigment profile.
      <br/>
      FIG. 2 illustrates the effect of alkaline treatment on the precipitation of glycoalkaloids in the concentrate. (FIG. 2 does not include fitted regression lines).
      <br/>
      FIG. 3 illustrates the anthocyanin concentrations of the concentrate at different pH levels.
    </p>
    <p num="31">
      The pH of the concentrate may be adjusted with any of a variety of alkaline compounds, e.g., ammonium hydroxide, potassium phosphate, potassium hydroxide, sodium hydroxide, and mixtures thereof.
      <br/>
      Potassium hydroxide and potassium phosphate have proved to be especially useful because these compounds tend to result in an overall lower level of pigment degradation.
      <br/>
      Use of potassium hydroxide to adjust the pH is relatively fast, requires less alkali, and does not tend to precipitate after further concentration.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, use of potassium phosphate (e.g., K3 PO4.12H2 O) tends to cause an overall pigment degradation as compared to potassium hydroxide treatment.
    </p>
    <p num="32">
      The pH-adjusted concentrate is heated to a temperature of from about 40 (degree)  C. to about 50 (degree)  C., using conventional techniques known to persons skilled in the art.
      <br/>
      The concentrate may be heated during alkali adjustment of the pH or after such adjustment.
      <br/>
      Heating of the pH adjusted concentrate aides in the precipitation of the alkaloids.
      <br/>
      Favorable results have been obtained by heating the pH-adjusted filtrate to a temperature of from about 40 (degree)  C. to about 50 (degree)  C. for about 10 to about 15 minutes.
      <br/>
      The precipitated alkaloids are then removed from the alkali pH-adjusted concentrate by conventional technique, such as centrifugation or direct osmotic concentration.
      <br/>
      Centrifugation of the alkali pH-adjusted extract at about 10,000 RPM for from about 10 to about 20 minutes has been found to be effective to separate the precipitated alkaloid from the concentrate.
      <br/>
      Direct osmotic concentration of the alkali pH-adjusted concentrate provides the advantage of removing salt formed during alkali adjustment of the pH of the concentrate.
      <br/>
      The anthocyanin pigment supernatant is then collected.
    </p>
    <p num="33">
      Anthocyanin pigment extracts undergo color changes with changes in the pH value.
      <br/>
      Anthocyanin extracts tend to be a more intense red color (i.e., flavilium form) and are more stable under acidic conditions (i.e., at a pH value of less than or equal to about 3.5).
      <br/>
      At higher pH values of the anthocyanin extract, the anthocyanin extract fades (i.e., decreases in intensity) at a pH of about 4.5 to about 5.5. At a pH value of about 6 or greater, the anthocyanin extract changes to a purple or blue hue (i.e., quinonoidal base form).
    </p>
    <p num="34">
      Accordingly, the pH value of the potato anthocyanin supernatant is subsequently adjusted to a pH of from about 1 to about 4 0 (slashed zero)  Preferably, the pH value of the supernatant is adjusted to from about 2.5 to about 3.5. Adjusting the supernatant to a pH value less than about 2.5 results in a colorant that is typically too acidic for most applications.
      <br/>
      On the other hand, adjustment of the pH of the anthocyanin supernatant to a value of about 4 or greater results in a colorant that may have a sufficient red hue (i.e., a red hue equivalent to that of FD&amp;C Red No. 40) but typically does not display the desired intensity or lightness.
      <br/>
      Good results have been obtained by adjusting the pH value of the anthocyanin supernatant to from about 3 to about 3.5, with a pH value of 3.5 resulting in a colorant of excellent red hue and intensity.
      <br/>
      For example, colorant compositions having superior red hue and intensity have been obtained when the anthocyanin supernatant is collected and immediately acidified with, e.g., phosphoric acid (food grade) to a pH value of about 3 0 (slashed zero)  Ultimately, the pH is adjusted in such a manner as to obtain a colorant having a red-hue and intensity equivalent to FD&amp;C Red No. 40. If a dry colorant concentrate is desired, the anthocyanin supernatant may be dried after the pH is adjusted to the appropriate acidic pH value, by spray drying or by thin-film dehydration.
    </p>
    <p num="35">An especially useful natural, potato colorant composition obtained using the present methods comprise about 250 mg/100 mL anthocyanin pigment (i.e., pelargonidin 3-rutinoside-5-glucoside acylated with p-coumaric acid), about 60 to about 125 mg/100 mL phenolics (about 60-85% of the phenolic acids being chlorogenic acid and its isomers and p-coumaric acid, caffeic acid, and ferulic acid being present), and about 37 g/100 mL sugar (i.e., sucrose, glucose, and fructose).</p>
    <p num="36">The colorant composition may have a pH value of about 2.4 and has less than about 5 mg/100 mL alkaloids.</p>
    <p num="37">
      The color parameters of the colorant compositions vary with the concentration of the colorant composition and the pH value of the composition.
      <br/>
      However, model juices (pH of about 3.5), colored with the potato extract colorant compositions typically have a hue angle ranging from about 18 (degree)  to about 30 (degree)  at levels of about 15 mg/100 mL and 45 mg/100 mL, respectively.
      <br/>
      The hue angle of the natural colorant compositions disclosed herein typically exceed 40 (degree)  at a pH value of about 1, decrease to about 32 (degree)  at a pH value of about 2, and decrease to about 20 (degree)  at a pH value of about 3.
      <br/>
      At pH values of about 4 to about 7, the hue angle of the colorant composition remains at about 20 (degree) . The intensity of the colorant composition, however, drops dramatically at pH values of about 4 to about 7.
      <br/>
      See Table 1 for the color parameters of a natural colorant composition as disclosed herein.

    <p num="39">Anthocyanin Extracts</p>
    <p num="40">
      Red-fleshed potato tuber (cv NDC4069-4) anthocyanins were extracted using both chemical purification and juice processing operations.
      <br/>
      Chemical purification was done by the acetone/chloroform procedure described by Giusti and Wrolstad (1996).
      <br/>
      Pigments were partially purified using a C-18 resin, mini-column (high load C-18 resin tube), having a 20 mL capacity and a 5 g sorbent weight (as available from Alltech Assoc., Inc., IL).
      <br/>
      The purified fractions were labeled potato anthocyanin extract (POT).
      <br/>
      Potato juice concentrate was produced by blending potato tubers with acidified water (0.5 M citric acid) and were concentrated using a Buchi rotovapor at about 40 (degree)  C. The potato juice was blanched at about 100 (degree)  C. for about 5 min, and concentrated.
      <br/>
      The concentrated juice was treated with K3 PO4.12H2 O to precipitate the alkaloids.
    </p>
    <p num="41">Preparation and Storage of Potato Juice</p>
    <p num="42">
      A 10 (degree)  Brix solution containing high fructose corn syrup (HFCS, ISOSWEET (tm)  100, available from Staley Manufacturing Co. of Illinois), 0.1% (w/v) potassium sorbate, 0.1% (w/v) sodium benzoate, and 0.1M citric acid (available from Sigma Chemical Co., of St. Louis, Mo.) was prepared.
      <br/>
      Solutions were separated into separate containers and colored each with 15 mg monomeric anthocyanin per 100 mL of (1) radish anthocyanin extract (RAE), extracted using C-18 resin and organic solvents, (2) radish juice concentrate (RJ), (3) potato anthocyanin extract (POT), extracted using C-18 resin and organic solvents, and (4) potato juice concentrate (PJ) syrup, in duplicates.
      <br/>
      Potassium sorbate and sodium benzoate were added as needed to restore the 0.1% (w/v) level.
      <br/>
      The pH of the syrup was adjusted to a pH of about 3.5 with potassium hydroxide.
      <br/>
      Colored solutions (15 mL) were placed in 20 mL glass vials, flushed with N2, capped and pasteurized in water at about 85 (degree)  C. for about 25 min.
      <br/>
      The vials were stored in the dark, at about 2 (degree)  C. and about 25 (degree)  for about 65 weeks.
    </p>
    <p num="43">Determination of pH and  (degree) Brix</p>
    <p num="44">
      For pH measurements a Brinkman 605 pH-meter (Methrohm Herisan, Switzerland) was used.
      <br/>
      The instrument was calibrated using buffers of pH 4.0 and 7.0 and the pH was directly measured in all samples.
      <br/>
      Degree Brix was measured using an Auto Abbe refractometer 10500 (Reichert-Jung, Leica Inc., NY, USA).
      <br/>
      The instrument was set to measure percent soluble solids in a temperature compensated mode.
    </p>
    <p num="45">Monomeric Anthocyanin Content, Polymeric Color and Color Density</p>
    <p num="46">
      Monomeric anthocyanin content and polymeric color were determined using the well known pH differential method and bisulfite bleaching method, respectively.
      <br/>
      A Shimadzu 300 UV spectrophotometer and 1 cm pathlength disposable cells were used for spectral measurements at 420, 510 and 700 nm.
      <br/>
      Pigment content was calculated as pelargonidin-3-glucoside, using an extinction coefficient of 31, 600 L/cm mol and a molecular weight of 433.2g/mol.
    </p>
    <p num="47">Color Measurements</p>
    <p num="48">
      Color characteristics (Hunter CIE LCh) were measured using a ColorQuest colorimeter (HunterLab, Hunter Associates Laboratories Inc., Reston, Va.).
      <br/>
      The equipment was set for transmittance with (the specular included) Illuminant C and a 10 (degree)  observer angle.
      <br/>
      Samples of colored syrup were placed in a 1 cm pathlength optical glass cell (Hellma, Germany) and color parameters were measured (See Table 1 above).
    </p>
    <p num="49">Results of the Potato Juice Colorant Compositions</p>
    <p num="50">
      In addition to measurement of the colorant compositions' color parameters, the affect of storage on the compositions was studied.
      <br/>
      Color and pigment degradation appeared to depend upon the storage temperature.
      <br/>
      At room temperature (about 25 (degree)  C.) the potato juice colorant compositions had anthocyanin half-lives of 10-11 weeks, while refrigerated temperatures (about 4 (degree)  C.) increased the half-life anthocyanin pigments to over a year.
      <br/>
      The visual appearance of the potato colorant compositions (at 15 mg/100 mL) were very close to that of FD&amp;C Red No. 40, i.e., about 150 ppm at a pH value of about 3.5.
    </p>
    <p num="51">
      The color attributes of the potato colorant compositions showed an increase in lightness (L*) and hue angle values during storage.
      <br/>
      The chroma (color intensity) of the potato colorant compositions decreased during storage.
      <br/>
      The potato colorant compositions showed increased levels of yellowness.
      <br/>
      At room temperature (about 25 (degree)  C.), the color of potato colorant compositions changed from a red color to an orange/red color during the first 10 weeks (giving a color comparable to FD&amp;C Red No. 40).
      <br/>
      After 20-25 weeks, the potato colorant compositions had a light orange/yellow color.
      <br/>
      Refrigeration appeared to reduce the color changes of the colorant compositions.
      <br/>
      Increasing the pigment concentration of the colorant compositions results in increased anthocyanin pigment and color stability and produces colorant compositions having color characteristics even closer to those of FD&amp;C Red No. 40. At the anthocyanin levels present in these example potato colorant compositions (see Table 2) acceptable color characteristics were obtained for up to about 15 weeks at about 25 (degree)  C.
