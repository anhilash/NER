      The invention provides for highly crystalline syndiotactic polypropylene comprising a high percentage of racemic (r) dyads.
      <br/>
      The high crystallinity may be due to the polymerization mechanism of metallocene catalysts of a particular structure which appear to produce syndiotactic polypropylene of a new microstructure.

      Field of the Invention
    </p>
    <p num="3">The invention relates to highly crystalline syndiotactic polypropylene and, particularly, to syndiotactic polypropylene having a syndiotactic index of greater than 75%.</p>
    <p num="4">2. Description of the Prior Art</p>
    <p num="5">
      As known in the art, syndiotactic polymers have a unique stereochemical structure in which monomeric units having enantiomorphic configuration of the asymmetrical carbon atoms follow each other alternately and regularly in the macromolecular main chain.
      <br/>
      Syndiotactic polypropylene was first disclosed by Natta et al, in U.S. Pat. No. 3,258,455. The Natta group obtained syndiotactic polypropylene by using a catalyst prepared from titanium trichloride and diethyl aluminum monochloride.
      <br/>
      A later patent to Natta et al, U.S. Pat. No. 3,305,538, discloses the use of vanadium triacetylacetonate or halogenated vanadium compounds in combination with organic aluminum compounds for producing syndiotactic polypropylene. U.S. Pat. No. 3,364,190 to Emrick discloses a catalyst system composed of finely divided titanium or vanadium trichloride, aluminum chloride, a trialkyl aluminum and a phosphorus-containing Lewis base as producing syndiotactic polypropylene.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      As disclosed in these patent references and as known in the art, the structure and properties of syndiotactic polypropylene differ significantly from those of isotactic polypropylene.
      <br/>
      The isotactic structure is typically described as having long sequences of monomer units with the same relative configuration of the tertiary carbon atoms.
      <br/>
      Using the Fischer projection formula, the stereochemical sequence of isotactic polypropylene is described as follows:  (Chemical Structure image '1' not included in text)
    </p>
    <p num="7">The methyl groups attached to the tertiary carbon atoms of successive monomeric units on the same side of a hypothetical plane through the main chain of the polymer, e.g., the methyl groups are all above or below the plane.</p>
    <p num="8">
      Another way of describing the structure is through the use of NMR.
      <br/>
      Bovey's NMR nomenclature for an isotactic pentad is . . . mmmm . . . with each "m" representing a "meso" dyad or successive methyl groups on the same side in the plane.
      <br/>
      As known in the art, any deviation or inversion in the structure of the chain lowers the degree of isotacticity and crystallinity of the polymer.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      In contrast to the isotactic structure, syndiotactic polymers are those in which long sequences of monomer units have an alternating relative configuration of the tertiary carbon atoms.
      <br/>
      Using the Fischer projection formula, the structure of a syndiotactic polymer is designated as:  (Chemical Structure image '2' not included in text)
    </p>
    <p num="10">The methyl groups attached to the tertiary carbon atoms of successive monomeric units in the chain lie on alternate sides of the plane of the polymer.</p>
    <p num="11">
      In NMR nomenclature, this pentad is described as . . . rrrr . . . in which each "r" represents a "racemic" dyad, i.e., successive methyl groups on alternate side of the plane.
      <br/>
      The percentage of r dyads in the chain determines the degree of syndiotacticity of the polymer.
      <br/>
      Syndiotactic polymers are crystalline and like the isotactic polymers are insoluble in xylene.
      <br/>
      This crystallinity distinguishes both syndiotactic and isotactic polymers from atactic polymer that is soluble in xylene.
      <br/>
      Atactic polymer exhibits no regular order of repeating unit configurations in the polymer chain and forms essentially a waxy product.
    </p>
    <p num="12">
      While it is possible for a catalyst to produce all three types of polymer, it is desirable to produce predominantly isotactic or syndiotactic polymer with very little atactic formed.
      <br/>
      Catalysts that produce isotactic polyolefins are disclosed in European Patent Application No. 87870132.5 (Publication No. 0 284 308) published Oct. 5, 1988 and U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,794,096 issued Dec. 27, 1988 and 4,975,405 issued Dec. 4, 1990. These applications disclosed chiral, stereorigid metallocene catalysts that polymerize olefins to form isotactic polymers and are especially useful in the polymerization of a highly isotactic polypropylene.
      <br/>
      The present invention, however, utilize a different class of metallocene catalyst that are useful in the polymerization of syndiotactic polyolefins, and more particularly syndiotactic polypropylene.
    </p>
    <p num="13">
      The present invention provides highly crystalline syndiotactic polypropylene.
      <br/>
      It was discovered that the catalyst structure affected the formation of a syndiotactic polymer as opposed to an isotactic polymer.
      <br/>
      One theory, without limiting the scope of the claims of the present invention, is that the catalyst structure appears to affect the type and number of deviations in the chain from the principally repeating units in the polymer.
      <br/>
      Previously, the catalyst used to produce syndiotactic polypropylene were believed to exercise chain-end control over the polymerization mechanism.
      <br/>
      These previously known catalysts, such as the ones disclosed by Natta et al in the references cited above, produce syndiotactic polymers which primarily have the following structure:  (Chemical Structure image '3' not included in text)
    </p>
    <p num="14">
      or in NMR nomenclature . . . rrrmrrr . . . The NMR analysis for this structure of syndiotactic polypropylene is shown in Zambelli, et al., Macromolecules, Vol. 13, pp 267-270 (1980).
      <br/>
      Zambelli's analysis shows the predominance of the single meso dyad over any other deviations in the chain.

    <p num="19">
      The present invention provides highly crystalline polypropylene.

      The polymer consists of a high percentage of racemic dyads, i.e., greater than 75%.

    <p num="20">
      When propylene or other alpha-olefins are polymerized using a catalyst consisting of a transition metal compound, the polymer product typically comprises a mixture of amorphous atactic and crystalline xylene insoluble fractions.

      <br/>
      It is important that the catalyst complex be "clean" as the purity will affect the molecular weight and structure of the polymer produced.

      In addition, a complex may be isolated between a metallocene catalyst as described herein and an excess amount of aluminum cocatalyst in accordance with the teachings of European Patent Publication No. 226,463 published on Jun. 24, 1987 assigned to Exxon Chemical Patent Inc. with Howard Turner listed as the inventor.

      The Examples below illustrate the preparation of the polymers of the present invention and its various advantages in more detail.
      <br/>
      The results of the polymerization process and the analysis of the polymer are shown in Table 1 for Examples 1-17 and Table 2 for Examples 18-33.
    </p>
    <p num="39">EXAMPLE 1</p>
    <p num="40">
      The polymerization of propylene was carried out using 0.16 mg of isopropyl(cyclopentadienyl)(fluorenyl) zirconium dichloride produced in accordance with Method A us U.S. Pat. No. 4,892,451. The catalyst was purified using fractional recrystallization.
      <br/>
      The catalyst was precontacted for 20 minutes with a toluene solution containing 10.7% by weight of methylalumoxane (MAO) with an average molecular weight of about 1300.
      <br/>
      The alumoxane serves as a co-catalyst in the polymerization reaction.
      <br/>
      Ten cc of the MAO solution was used in the polymerization.
      <br/>
      The catalyst and co-catalyst solution was then added to a zipperclave reactor at room temperature followed by the addition of 1.2 liters of liquid propylene.
      <br/>
      The reactor contents were then heated to the polymerization temperature, T as shown in Tables 1 and 2, of 20 (degree)  C. in less than about 5 minutes.
      <br/>
      During this time, prepolymerization reaction was allowed to run for 60 minutes during which time the reactor was maintained at the polymerization temperature.
      <br/>
      The polymerization was terminated by rapidly venting the monomer.
      <br/>
      The reactor contents were washed with 50% methanol in dilute HCl solution and dried in vacuo.
      <br/>
      The polymerization yielded 14 gms of polypropylene "as polymerized", i.e., without any further isolations or purification.
    </p>
    <p num="41">Analysis of Polymer</p>
    <p num="42">
      The polymer was analyzed to determine the melting point Tm, the heat of crystallization Hc, the molecular weights (Mp, Mw, and Mn) and the syndiotactic index.
      <br/>
      Unless otherwise noted, the analyses were performed on the xylene insoluble fraction of the polymer which includes the syndiotactic fraction and any isotactic polymer produced.
      <br/>
      The atactic polymer was removed by dissolving the polymer product in hot xylene, cooling the solution to 0 (degree)  C. and precipitating out the xylene insoluble fraction.
      <br/>
      Successive recrystallization performed in this manner result in removing essentially all atactic polymer from the xylene insoluble fraction.
    </p>
    <p num="43">
      The melting points, Tm, were derived using Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) data as known in the art.
      <br/>
      The melting points, Tm1 and Tm2 listed in Tables 1 and 2 are not true equilibrium melting points but are DCS peak temperatures.
      <br/>
      In syndiotactic polypropylene, it is not unusual to get an upper and a lower peak temperature, i.e., two peaks, and both melting points are reported in Tables 1 and 2 with the lower melting point reported as Tm1 and the higher point as Tm2.
      <br/>
      True equilibrium melting points obtained over a period of several hours would most likely be several degrees higher than the DSC lower peak melting points.
      <br/>
      As is known in the art, the melting points for polypropylene are determined by the crystallinity of the xylene insoluble fraction of the polymer.
      <br/>
      This has been shown to be true by running the DSC melting points before and after removal of the xylene soluble or atactic form of the polymer.
      <br/>
      The results showed only a difference of 1-2 (degree)  C. in the melting points after most of the atactic polymer was removed.
      <br/>
      As shown in Table 1, the melting points were determined to be 145 (degree)  C. and 150 (degree)  C. for the polymer produced in Example 1.
      <br/>
      DSC data was also used to determine the heat of crystallization, -Hc as shown in Tables 1 and 2 measured in J/g.
      <br/>
      The melting points and -Hc were determined on the "as polymerized` sample before the atactic polymer was removed.
    </p>
    <p num="44">
      The molecular weights of the polymer were calculated using Gel Permeation Chromatography (GPC) analysis done on a Waters 150C. instrument with a column of Jordi gel and an ultra-high molecular weight mixed bed.
      <br/>
      The solvent was trichlorobenzene and the operating temperature was 140 (degree)  C. From GPC, Mp which is the peak molecular weight, Mn which is the number average molecular weight, and Mw which is the weight average molecular weight were derived for the xylene insoluble fraction of the polymer produced.
      <br/>
      The molecular weight distribution, MWD, is commonly measured as Mw divided by Mn.
      <br/>
      The values determined for this sample are shown in Table 1.
    </p>
    <p num="45">
      The syndiotactic index can be determined from GPC, IR or NMR data.
      <br/>
      The syndiotactic index is calculated from NMR data according to the following equation:
      <br/>
      Syndiotactic index=rrrr+mrrr+mrrm+1/2(mrmr+mmrm+rrmr+mmrr)
    </p>
    <p num="46">
      The syndiotactic index obtained from NMR data is the most accurate indication of the degree of syndiotacticity.
      <br/>
      The syndiotactic index based on IR data is calculated by dividing the area of the IR peak at 11.53 microns by half of the area of the peaks at 2.32 and 2.35 microns represented by the following formula:
      <br/>
      Syndiotactic index=A11.53 /1/2(A2.32 +A2.35)
    </p>
    <p num="47">
      The syndiotactic index calculated from GPC data requires that the syndiotacticity of the syndiotacticity of the polymer be known beforehand.
      <br/>
      Unlike NMR and IR data, GPC data cannot show the tacticity of the polymer,i.e., whether a polymer is isotactic, or syndiotactic.
      <br/>
      The tacticity must be determined by other methods, such as IR or NMR, before the syndiotactic index (or isotactic index) of the polymer can be calculated from GPC data.
      <br/>
      The syndiotactic index is calculated as the area of the GPC peak related to the crystalline polymer divided by the total GPC peak area for the polymer "as polymerized" represented by the following formula:
      <br/>
      Syndiotactic index=Acrystalline /ATotal * 100
    </p>
    <p num="48">
      The syndiotactic index shown in Table 1 was determined from the GPC data.
      <br/>
      The syndiotactic index shown in Table 2 was determined from NMR data on samples which were recrystallized from xylene.
    </p>
    <p num="49">
      NMR analysis was used to determine the microstructure of the polymer.
      <br/>
      A sample of the polymer produced above was dissolved in a 20% solution os 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene/d6 -benzene and run on a Bruker AM 300 WB spectrometer using the inverse gate broad band decoupling method.
      <br/>
      The experimental conditions were: transmitter frequency 75.47 Mhz; decoupler frequency 300.3 Mhz; pulse repetition time 12 seconds; acquisition time 1.38 seconds; pulse angle 90 (degree)  (11.5 microseconds pulse width); memory size 75K points; spectral window, 12195 Hz.
      <br/>
      Seven thousand transients were accumulated, and the probe temperature was set at 133 (degree)  C. The NMR spectrum for the polymer produced and recrystallized from xylene one time is shown in FIG. 3.
      <br/>
      The calculated and observed values for the spectrum are shown in Table 3 with Example 1 representing the data for the sample recrystallized once from xylene and Example 1-A representing the data for the sample recrystallized three times from xylene.
      <br/>
      The calculated values were derived using the Bernouillian probability equations as disclosed in Inoue Y., et al, Polymer, Vol. 25, page 1640 (1984) and as known in the art.
    </p>
    <p num="50">
      The results show that in the sample recrystallized once from xylene the percentage of racemic dyads (r) is 95%. For the sample recrystallized three times from xylene the percentage of r dyads is 98% indicating a polymer that consists of 2% or less of the meso (m) dyad.
      <br/>
      Further, the NMR spectrum shows that the meso dyads occur predominately in pairs, i.e., mm triads, as opposed to the previously known single m dyad structure in the chain.

      The data shown in Tables 1-4 and in FIGS. 3, 4 and 5 show that the polymers of the present invention are predominantly syndiotactic polypropylene that has high crystallinity.
      <br/>
      Particularly, the NMR data shown in Tables 3 and 4 establish that the xylene insoluble fraction consists of a very high percentage of syndiotactic polymer with very little, if any, isotactic polymer being produced.
      <br/>
      Further, the syndiotactic polymer contains a high percentage of "r" groups and "rrrr" pentads indicating that there is only a small percentage of deviations from the ". . . rrrr . . . " structure in the polymer chain.
      <br/>
      The deviations that do exist are predominantly of the "mm" type.
      <br/>
      Indeed, the results for Ex. 1-A in Table 3 show that the only deviation in the chain is of the "mm" type.
      <br/>
      The other NMR samples show the predominance of the "mm" deviation over the "m" deviation.
      <br/>
      Thus, a novel microstructure for syndiotactic polypropylene has been discovered.
    </p>
    <p num="73">
      The data in Tables 1-4 and Examples 1-33 show the high crystallinity of the polymer product.
      <br/>
      The relatively high melting points, TM1 and TM2, and the relatively high heats of crystallization, -Hc, indicate that the polymers are highly crystalline.
      <br/>
      This high crystallinity is demonstrated by the syndiotactic index, (�r� value) which is a measure of the per cent of racemic (r) dyads in the polymer.
      <br/>
      In Tables 1 and 2 the syndiotactic index is shown to be above 50% (�r� 0.50) in twelve of the twenty examples in which results for the syndiotactic index is recorded, eight of the twelve are 83% or above (�r� &gt;= 0.83) and four of the eight are 89% or above (�r� &gt;= 0.89).
      <br/>
      As shown in Table 3, the syndiotactic index increases upon recrystallization.
      <br/>
      The sample from Example 1 has a syndiotactic index of 62% on the polymer "as polymerized" (see Table 1).
      <br/>
      After one recrystallization, the �r� value increased to 95% and after three crystallizations the �r� value increased to 98% (see Table 3).

      The syndiotactic index for Examples 20-22 for the xylene insoluble fraction from a single recrystallization from xylene were "nearly 100%" where �r� would be 1 0 (slashed zero)  Recorded values are up to 0.95. Therefore, the syndiotactic index or �r� value of the present invention ranges from about 0.50 to about 1.0, preferably from about 0.83 to about 1.0 and, most preferably, from about 0.89 to about 0.95.

      Tables 3 and 4 show that there is a high percentage of �rrrr� pentads.
      <br/>
      The values ranges from 74.55 to 94.79. Therefore, the �rrrr� pentads of the present invention range from about 0.75 to about 0.95. The median is about 0.85 and the mean average is about 81.6 with a standard deviation of 6.83.

      The data further indicates a correlation between the polymerization reaction temperature, T, and the melting points, molecular weights and the heats of crystallization of the polymer.
      <br/>
      As the reaction temperature increases, all three of these properties decrease.
      <br/>
      There also seems to be a range of temperature within which the yield of polymer is maximized.
      <br/>
      This reaction temperature range will vary with the type of catalyst used but is typically 50-70 (degree)  C. The concentration of methylalumoxane (MAO) also appears to affect the polymer yield.
      <br/>
      The data indicates that to a point, the greater the concentration of MAO, the higher the yield of polymer.
      <br/>
      The concentration of MAO also seem to have some effect on the amount of atactic polymer produced.
      <br/>
      MAO appears to act like a scavenger for impurities and tends to reduce the amount of atactic polymer produced.

      The data further indicates a difference between the zirconium catalyst and the hafnium catalyst of the present invention.
      <br/>
      The polymers produced with the hafnium catalysts tend to be less crystalline and have lower melting points than the polymers produced with the zirconium catalysts.
      <br/>
      The data in Table 4 also shows that the hafnium catalyst produces a higher percentage of isotactic blocks in the polymer chain as reflected by the presence of the isotactic pentad mmmm.

      Examples 18, 19 and 33 show the ability to achieve a broader molecular weight distribution, MWD=Mw /Mn, by use of a mixture of the catalysts described by the present invention.
      <br/>
      The catalysts in these Examples were prepared using HfCl4 that contained about 4% ZrCl4.
      <br/>
      Therefore, both isopropyl (fluorenyl) (cyclopentadienyl) hafnium dichloride and isopropyl (fluorenyl) (cyclopentadienyl) zirconium dichloride were produced.
      <br/>
      The MWD of the polymer in these Examples with a mixture of two catalysts is significantly higher than the MWD of the polymer produced by an essentially pure hafnium catalyst--see Example 32.
      <br/>
      Thus, a mixture of two different catalysts can be used to produce a polymer with a broad MWD.

    <p num="78">It should be further understood that the syndio-specific catalyst of the present invention are not limited to the specific structures recited in the Examples, but rather, include catalysts described by the general formula given herein in which C5 R4 is substituted in such a manner as to have bi-lateral or pseudo bi-lateral symmetry as described above.</p>

      From the detailed description of the invention just given, it is apparent that the invention provides a novel structure of syndiotactic polypropylene.
      <br/>
      Having described but a few embodiments, it will be apparent to one skilled in the art that various modifications and adaptations may be made to the polymers as described without departing from the scope of the present invention.
