      This application claims the benefit of U.S. provisional patent application Ser.
      <br/>
      No. 60/061,997 filed Oct. 14, 1997 and entitled Self Service Sales and Rental Security System, which is incorporated herein by reference.
    </p>
    <heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">The present invention relates generally to systems and procedures used by retail stores to prevent theft of merchandise and maintain an inventory of items, and, more particularly, to a system and procedure to secure each item of inventory and to automatically identify and track each item of inventory from the point of delivery from the manufacturer to its sale to the ultimate purchaser.</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="3">
      Theft of merchandise presents an ever present problem within the retail sales market, resulting in lost profits to retailers.
      <br/>
      In addition, the loss of merchandise by theft results in inaccurate inventories as the stolen items are often not accounted for until a manual inventory is performed.
      <br/>
      Such thefts may occur at any point in the flow of merchandise from the manufacturer to the point of sale to the ultimate purchaser, and include theft during transit from the manufacturer to the retailer, theft during the process of stocking merchandise, theft by employees, and theft by the public from the retailer's stores.
      <br/>
      Several methods are presently known and employed to identify and prevent such thefts.
      <br/>
      However, such known methods are either limited in their ability to detect all such thefts or are overly burdensome on customers during the process of shopping.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      One such method presently employed to prevent theft of merchandise involves placing the merchandise within locked cases or locked storage rooms.
      <br/>
      When merchandise is locked within cases or storage rooms, an undue burden is placed on the customer, since assistance from a store clerk or manager is required to retrieve the merchandise and the customer is not able to physically examine the merchandise absent this assistance.
      <br/>
      During periods of high customer volume, sales may be lost due to customer impatience; and theft of merchandise may still occur, since during such periods of high customer volume, store clerks and managers may not be able to continually monitor customers for whom they have retrieved merchandise.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      Another method employed to prevent theft of merchandise, often utilized with clothing of greater value, involves physically locking the merchandise to a rack by means of a cable or such.
      <br/>
      In use, such a method, has similar drawbacks to the method of locking merchandise in cases or storage room, in that, a store clerk or manager is required to unlock the item for the customer in the event of purchase, or for the customer to try on.
    </p>
    <p num="6">Although, U.S. Pat. No. 4,920,334 to DeVolpi describes a method to indicate if a cable used in locking merchandise to a rack is severed, the known methods of locking merchandise in a case, storage room, or to a rack are unable to prevent theft when items are received and before they are locked away or by employees who have access to the locked cases, storage rooms or racks.</p>
    <p num="7">
      Still another method currently employed to prevent theft of merchandise involves the utilization of security tags which are secured to items or their packaging by adhesive or mechanical means and will activate sensors at the entrance and exits to a store if not removed or deactivated.
      <br/>
      This method to prevent theft of merchandise is often ineffective, as the tags can often be easily removed or shielded from the sensors.
      <br/>
      Further, theft of the merchandise before it is tagged, or by employees who can deactivate or remove the tags, or by employees who can simply circumvent the sensors is not prevented.
    </p>
    <p num="8">Accordingly, it is the object of the present invention to provide an improved method of preventing and identifying theft of merchandise occurring anywhere between shipment from the manufacturer to sale to the ultimate purchaser, while reducing the burden of security measures on customers, and resulting in increased accuracy of inventory.</p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="9">The objects of the present invention are accomplished by the self service sales and security system which comprises: a continuous loop signaling device which is incorporated within or attached to items in inventory; one or more racks, which may be used to support the items in inventory, and to which continuous loop signaling devices are detachably secured by locking mechanical means and electrically connected thereby at a distinct address; a control center connected to each rack and electrically connected to each continuous loop signaling device through the rack at each distinct address, wherein the control center can perceive the signal of each continuous loop signaling device independent of the other continuous loop signaling devices, and wherein the control center can selectively release the locking mechanical means securing a particular continuous loop signaling device to the rack; and a system controller which receives information from and sends information to the one or more control centers.</p>
    <p num="10">
      The control center has means for input of the identity of the individual seeking authorization to release a particular continuous loop signaling device and therefore a particular item.
      <br/>
      The control center's means for input of an individual's identity may be accomplished through use of a keypad or touch screen utilizing individual pass codes or by insertion of a card encoded with an individual's identity into a card reader incorporated into the control center.
    </p>
    <p num="11">
      The system controller receives information from the control centers indicating which continuous loop signaling devices are secured to the racks and maintains a permanent inventory of such continuous loop signaling devices upon a disk drive, EEPROM or similar recording device.
      <br/>
      Upon entry of a pass code or insertion of a card into a card reader of a control center , the e system controller receives information as to the identity of the individual seeking authorization to release a particular item.
      <br/>
      A permanent record for each individual's identity is maintained by the system controller which record could indicate a determined credit authorization for the individual, an accounting of which items are currently in the individuals possession, and a prior shopping history for the individual, including times and dates and identifying items accessed, returned and purchased.
      <br/>
      By evaluating the record from an individual's identity, the system controller directs the control center, either authorizing or denying access to a particular item and updating the record for the individual upon removal of any items from the rack.
    </p>
    <p num="12">
      In the event that the system controller receives information from a control center that a connection with a continuous loop signaling device has been lost without authorization from the system controller, such as if the continuous loop signaling device were severed, the system controller would maintain a record of the particular item involved, the location of the item and time and date.
      <br/>
      In such an event the system controller can be directed to automatically sound an alarm, contact security or contact law enforcement by radio or telephone transmission.
    </p>
    <p num="13">
      In practice of the current invention, items are ordered from a manufacturer and an invoice of the order is recorded within the system controller.
      <br/>
      The continuous loop signaling devices would preferably be interwoven within or applied to each item by the manufacturer; and in any event, the continuous loop signaling devices are applied to each item in such fashion that removal from an item would require severing the continuous loop signaling device.
    </p>
    <p num="14">
      When a delivery is received from the manufacturer, continuous loop signaling devices are attached to all the items delivered, if not previously attached by the manufacturer, and all the continuous loop signaling devices are secured to individual locations on one or more racks.
      <br/>
      Upon receiving a shipment from the manufacturer, notice of delivery and the identity of the employee or employees stocking the delivery are input into the system controller through a control center; and the location on a rack where a received item is secured and its identity are input into the system controller through a control center.
    </p>
    <p num="15">
      Once all received items are secured to a rack the system controller compares the items newly secured to all racks, with the ordered invoice, to identify any discrepancies.
      <br/>
      Instances of incomplete shipments, inaccurate shipments and theft in transit or during the process of stocking the shipment are therefore identified; and with the assistance of video surveillance equipment in receiving areas, any culpable employee of theft in receiving shipments is easily confirmed by examination of a short period of video tape.
    </p>
    <p num="16">
      Items may be removed form the racks only after an individual's identity is supplied to a control center and authorization for release of the continuous loop signaling device is received by the control center from the system controller.
      <br/>
      Customers utilize a pass code or identity card supplied by the retailer to input their identity to the control center; additionally, employees are supplied with their own pass code or identity card so that items may be released in instances of personal service upon a customer by a particular employee.
    </p>
    <p num="17">
      In the event that a customer does not wish to purchase an item released under their identity, the item may be placed in the charge of an employee authorized to receive items for restocking.
      <br/>
      The item released is then removed from the customer's record as being in their possession, and possession of the item is charged to the record of the particular employee receiving the item for restocking.
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      Should an item not be returned for restocking, the customer who released the item is identified by the system controller and their account is charged or they are billed for the item.
      <br/>
      And in the event that a returned item is not returned to a rack and the item has been input into the system controller as returned through a control center, the employee who received the item for restocking is easily ascertained from the record maintained by the system controller, and any instance of employee theft may be confirmed by use of video surveillance cameras and examining a short span of video tape as the system controller maintains time records and is able to indicate when an item was returned.
    </p>
    <p num="19">Finally, since the records of the system controller are updated and maintained to indicate the quantity and identification of items purchased by customers, as the retailers stock is depleted, the system controller is able to indicate to the retailer when there is a need to place orders with a manufacturer to replenish its inventory.</p>
    <p num="20">
      Although the continuous loop signaling devices of the present invention as described above may be comprised of a simple electrical conductive loop, a preferred embodiment of the present invention utilizes a signaling device that is smart, in that, a microchip or semi conductor circuit is incorporated within signaling device.
      <br/>
      By incorporating a microchip or semi conductor circuit into the signaling device, the signaling device can therefore be selectable or programmable so that the signaling device is able to communicate to the control center and identify the item to which it is attached.
    </p>
    <p num="21">Utilization of a smart signaling device greatly facilitates the use of the present invention as follows: when receiving merchandise for stocking or restocking with smart signaling devices attached, upon securing the item to any location on a rack, the control center and system controller would be able to immediately recognize what item has been received or returned without manual input of the location on a rack where the received item will be secured; and customers would be able to return and secure items to a rack and receive credit to their individual identity record without assistance from an employee.</p>
    <p num="22">
      An additional preferred embodiment of the present invention allows the use of credit and debit cards by customers as a means of input of an individual's identity.
      <br/>
      In such an embodiment, the system controller would receive the credit card information from the control center and through connection to its financial institution authorize the release of an item for billing directly to a customer's credit or debit account.
      <br/>
      This embodiment has the advantage of allowing customers to release items and purchase items without obtaining personal service from an employee or obtaining an individual identity pass code or card from the retailer.
    </p>
    <p num="23">In another preferred embodiment of the present invention, the system controller has the ability to access the internet, and is therefore able to selectively display product information obtained from a product manufacturer's web site on the screen of a control center at a customer's request.</p>

    </p>
    <p num="30">
      FIG. 5 is a plan view illustrating an item of inventory 28 supported by a section of rack 26.
      <br/>
      Attached to the item of inventory 28 is a signaling device 40 having a connector 42, which is detachably secured to rack 26 through an aperture 44 in rack 26.
      <br/>
      Signaling device 40 is constructed with a loop of electrically conductive material which terminates upon a set of electrical contacts disposed upon or within connector 42.
      <br/>
      Disposed within each aperture 44 of rack 26 are a set of electrical contacts, corresponding to the electrical contacts of connector 42, of signaling device 40, such that electrical contacts of connector 42 are in electrical connection with the electrical contacts disposed within aperture 44 when connector 42 is secured to rack 26 through an aperture 44.
      <br/>
      Each set of electrical contacts disposed within each aperture 44 of rack 26 is independently connected to a control center 24 which in turn communicates the continuity status of the loop of electrically conductive material of each signaling device 40 to the system controller 10.
      <br/>
      The system controller 10 is therefore able to perceive the location of each signaling device 40 and the removal or any change in continuity of any signaling device 40.
    </p>
    <p num="31">
      One or more unlocking devices 16 within rack 26 are provided and are controlled by system controller 10 to selectively release a connector 42 within an aperture 44 of rack 26.
      <br/>
      Such unlocking devices might be comprised of an electromagnetic, solenoid operated or motor driven release mechanism which displaces a key within an aperture 44 of rack 26 from a locked to a release position; wherein the key engages a recess formed in connector 42 in the locked position, and disengages from the recess formed in connector 42 in the released position allowing the connector 42 to be removed from aperture 44.

    <p num="34">FIG. 8 illustrates another alternate embodiment of a signaling device 40 with a continuous loop of electrically conductive material attached to a connector 42 and suitable to be incorporated into an item of inventory 28 during the process of manufacturing.</p>
    <p num="35">FIG. 9 illustrates the signaling device 40 of FIG. 8 that has been incorporated into an item of inventory 28 during the manufacturing process, and indicating one possible arrangement, within the item of inventory 28, of the loop of electrically conductive material and connector 42 of signaling device 40.</p>
    <p num="36">FIG. 10 illustrates an alternate arrangement of attachment of the signaling device 40 of FIG. 8 with a loop of electrically conductive material and connector 42 onto an item of inventory 28.</p>
    <p num="37">
      FIG. 11 illustrates another alternate embodiment of a signaling device 40, suitable for incorporation into an item of inventory 28 during the process of manufacturing, which comprises a microchip 50 which is electrically connected to a set of electrical contacts disposed upon or within connector 42 by electric ally conductive material.
      <br/>
      The microchip 50 is programmed with information identifying the particular item of inventory 28 to which it is attached.
      <br/>
      When connector 42 is secured through an aperture 44 of rack 26, the set of electrical contacts of connector 42 are in electrical contact with the corresponding set of electrical contacts disposed within aperture 44 of rack 26; therefore, the microchip 50 is able to communicate its programmed information, identifying the particular item of inventory 28 to which it is attached, to the system controller 10 through the control center 24 and rack 26.
      <br/>
      Since the presence or absence of connections at particular locations is monitored by the system controller 10, the system controller 10 is further able to identify when a item of inventory 28 with a signaling device 40 incorporating a microchip 50 is added or removed from a particular location on a rack 26 and identify that particular item of inventory 28.
    </p>
    <p num="38">FIG. 12 illustrates the signaling device 40 of FIG. 11 that has been incorporated into an item of inventory 28 during the manufacturing process, and indicating one possible arrangement, within the item of inventory 28, of the signaling device 40 with microchip 50.</p>
