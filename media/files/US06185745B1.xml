    <heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="1">
      This invention relates to a clothing combination comprising a shirt and a pair of pants wherein the shirt and the pair of pants are fastened together by a self-releasing bond.
      <br/>
      More particularly, this invention relates to a clothing combination that comprises a shirt and a pair of pants fastened together by at least one hook and loop fastening mechanism.
    </p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND</heading>
    <p num="2">
      In the art of dress clothing, which includes both business and formal wear, appearance is a principal factor governing consumer selection.
      <br/>
      Successful products must remain taught over the body to convey professionalism.
      <br/>
      At the same time, successful products do not exaggerate, and hopefully alleviate, physical imperfections of the wearer, such as an expansive stomach.
      <br/>
      This is a delicate balance that is difficult to achieve.
    </p>
    <p num="3">
      In example, if one has an expansive stomach, it is desirable to firmly attach a shirt to a pair of pants at or near the region of the belly button.
      <br/>
      However, securing a pair of pants this high on the wearer is problematic using conventional fasteners such as belts.
      <br/>
      Gravity and the natural pulling forces of the lower body in motion pull the belt down to the wearer's waist.
      <br/>
      Additionally, no matter how tightly the belt is secured, the shirt eventually crepes out of the pants and requires retucking.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      Appearance is also a major concern in the art of sports clothing.
      <br/>
      However, in the art of sports clothing comfort is equally important in swaying consumers to choose one set of garments over another.
      <br/>
      Because comfort plays such a critical role in purchaser selection, fastening devices that attach sport shirts to sport pants are considered undesirable.
      <br/>
      In example, it is generally accepted that belts constrict an athletes flexibility and, therefore, sport pants are not sold with belts and do not generally contain belt loops.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      However, despite the deficiency of belts as fasteners in both the dress clothing art and the sports clothing art, acceptable alternatives, to date, have not been apparent.
      <br/>
      Fastening devices other than belts are considered undesirable for use in attaching a shirt and pair of pants because the devices do not self-release in a reusable manner when subjected to a tensile or shearing force strong enough to tear one of the garments.
      <br/>
      Instead the fastening devices rip away.
      <br/>
      Even worse, because the fastening devices are sewn into the garments, the garments can be torn when the fastening devices rip away.
      <br/>
      In example, hooks, buttons and zippers do not self-release in a manner that leaves them reusable when they are subjected to a tensile or shearing force strong enough to rip the garments.
      <br/>
      Instead hooks, buttons and zippers rip away, rendering the fastening device useless and often tearing the garments in the process.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      Snaps can self-release in a reusable manner when subjected to a tensile or shearing force strong enough to rip the garments, but only when said force is at an appropriate angle.
      <br/>
      Otherwise, as with hooks, buttons and zippers, the snaps and surrounding material tear away.
      <br/>
      More importantly, snaps have the disadvantage of providing a weak attachment that is easily undone by the small vibrational forces inherent to physical exertion.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      In addition, the metal materials from which most snaps and many buttons and zippers are made are not water and chemical resistant.
      <br/>
      As a result the fasteners rust and become unsightly.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      Finally, all of the previously mentioned fastening devices are made from hard plastic or metal materials that are not readily dyeable in the same dying step and by the same dying means as the garments.
      <br/>
      Fastening devices must be colored separately, by using paint, colored fillers, or some other means, in a manner that matches the garment to which they are to be attached.
      <br/>
      Otherwise, the fastening devices are readily apparent to the viewer and detract from the overall appearance of the garment.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      For all of the above stated reasons, the art teaches away the use of fasteners other than belts to secure a shirt to a pair of pants.
      <br/>
      However, it would still be desirable to fasten a shirt to a pair of pants if a suitable fastening means could be found.
      <br/>
      Fastening a shirt and pair of pants together, whether by means of suspenders or belts or some other device, has long been recognized as the ideal way to maintain the ideal aesthetic appearance of the garments.
      <br/>
      This is especially true when the shirt is tucked taught into the pair of pants.
      <br/>
      In fact, the NBA now requires its athletes to keep their uniform shirts tucked into their uniform pants at all times.
      <br/>
      Other professional and amateur sports associations may have or adopt similar rules.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, in the business community, it goes without saying that dress shirts are always tucked into suit or dress pants.
      <br/>
      In addition, fastening the shirts and pants together provides a means of controlling the manner in which the garments relax, thereby allowing the manufacturer, or the wearer, to tailor the fall of the garments in a manner deemed most comfortable and most suitable for a given physical activity.

    <p num="13">What is needed is a means for fastening a shirt to a pair of pants that self-releases in a reusable manner when subjected to a tensile or shearing force strong enough to rip one of the garments.</p>
    <p num="14">
      For a variety of reasons, Hook and loop fasteners are an ideal way to attach a pair of pants to a shirt.
      <br/>
      For example, the material make-up of hook and loop fasteners does not restrict flexibility.
      <br/>
      Hook and loop fasteners are typically made out of nylon and/or polyester polymers.
      <br/>
      These polymers are often used to make clothing and bend in the same manner as clothing.
      <br/>
      Thus hook and loop fasteners are flexible.
    </p>
    <p num="15">
      In addition, hook and loop fasteners can be made small enough to minimize inflexibility due to the size of the fastener.
      <br/>
      In fact, an effective bond can be made from a hook and loop fastener that has a thickness, width and length, as little as 1/2" or even less.
      <br/>
      The narrow thickness is especially important in lessening the chances that the fastener will hinder movement.
    </p>
    <p num="16">
      Hook and loop fasteners are adjustable by manipulating the size and location of the surface area wherein the hook and loop strips contact.
      <br/>
      Therefore, if a hindrance to movement occurs, the fastener can be adjusted to minimize the hindrance.
    </p>
    <p num="17">
      Most importantly, the bonds provided by hook and loop fasteners self-release in a reusable manner when subjected to a tensile and/or shearing forces strong enough to tear one of the garments.
      <br/>
      The hook strips and loop strips pull apart but remain unbroken, allowing later contact to reform the self-releasing bond.
      <br/>
      This allows the shirt and/or pant maximum movement when subjected to severe forces and, thereby, minirnizes the chances that the shirt and/or pair of pants will tear.
      <br/>
      As stated, this is not the case with existing shirt-pants fastening means, such as buttons, hooks and zippers.
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      However, the bonds provided by hook and loop fasteners are also capable of withstanding the small vibrational forces inherent to physical exertion.
      <br/>
      In fact, such vibrational forces actually increase the strength of the bond because it causes the hooks to

    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="22">
      In the early 1940's, Swiss inventor George de Mestral went on a walk with his dog and noticed that both his pants and his dog returned covered with cockle burrs.
      <br/>
      His curiosity led him to view the burrs under a microscope whereupon he discovered that they contained a natural hook-like shape.
      <br/>
      The hook-like shape easily clung to the woven loops in his nylon pants and the tangled hairs on his dog.
      <br/>
      This became the basis for a unique two-sided fastener one side of which contains stiff hooks, like the burrs, and the other side of which contains soft loops, like the fabric of the pants and tangled hairs of the dog.
      <br/>
      Mestral decided to market this new hook and loop fastening system under the name VELCRO (tm)  taken from the french words "velour," meaning velvet, and "crochet," meaning hook.
      <br/>
      Today there are many companies which produce this type of fastening system, called a hook and loop fastener or a touch fastener.
      <br/>
      However, VELCRO (tm)  produced by Velcro Industries B. V. remains the most prominent product.
    </p>
    <p num="23">
      Hook and loop fasteners have been used in the clothing industry for a variety of purposes.
      <br/>
      In example, hook and loop fasteners have been used as an alternative to shoe laces.
      <br/>
      In further example, hook and loop fasteners have been used as a means for attaching articles to sport clothing, such as attaching hand towels to baseball uniforms so that athletes can remove sweat without coming in from the field. move deeper into the loop entanglements.
      <br/>
      This makes hook and loop fasteners a vast improvement over snaps.
    </p>
    <p num="24">
      In addition, hook and loop fasteners are made of nylon and/or polyester.
      <br/>
      Both nylon and polyester are water resistant, chemical resistant and dyeable using conventional clothing dyes.
      <br/>
      Thus hook and loop fasteners do not rust and are readily dyeable in the same dying step and by the same manner as the pair of pants and/or shirt.
    </p>
    <p num="25">
      Utilizing hook and loop fasteners, a shirt, such as a dress shirt, can be tucked taught inside a pair of pants, such as a pair of suit pants, without creping out and requiring retucking.
      <br/>
      The hook and loop fasteners, because they are sewn into the clothing can be firmly affixed above the waistline at or near the belly button to enable a wearer to present a neat appearance that, simultaneously, hides physical imperfections such as an expansive stomach.
    </p>
    <p num="26">Thus the use of hook and loop fasteners to attach a shirt to a pair of pants gives all of the aesthetic and control benefits of a fastening device without any of the drawbacks typically encountered when the clothes are worn by the modem day businessman, businesswoman and athlete.</p>
    <p num="27">
      A clothing combination has been created comprising a pair of pants and a shirt that are bound together in a taught manner using a self-releasing bond such as the bond created using hook and loop fasteners.
      <br/>
      The clothing combination has the flexibility, vibration strength, and weather resistance needed to serve the needs of the business and sporting communities.
    </p>
    <p num="28">
      The clothing combination comprises a pair of pants having front and back side, an inner and outer surface, a pant waistline, a waistband that encompasses the pant waistline, and one or more pant connecting strips affixed to the waistband.
      <br/>
      The clothing combination also includes a shirt having a front and back side, an inner and outer surface, a shirt waistline, a waist zone that encompasses the shirt waistline and one or more shirt connecting strips affixed to the waist zone.
      <br/>
      The pant and shirt are connected, or capable of being connected, through self-releasing bonds that are formed whenever said pant connecting strips are brought into contact with said shirt connecting strips.
    </p>
    <p num="29">
      In addition, the instant invention embraces multicomponent kits for making said clothing combination.
      <br/>
      The first multicomponent kit comprises a pair of pants or a shirt with preattached connecting strips, unaffixed adhesive connecting strips and, optionally one or more templates.
      <br/>
      The second multicomponent kit comprises several unaffixed adhesive connecting strips and one or more templates.
      <br/>
      In both kits, the templates guide the wearer in applying the unaffixed adhesive connecting strips to create a clothing combination that can be bound together with a self-releasing bond.
    </p>
    <p num="30">Finally, the instant invention is to a process for making said clothing combination.</p>

    <heading>DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
    <p num="39">
      FIG. 1 shows a sample pair of pants 100 for use in the instant invention.
      <br/>
      As used in this application the words "pant" and "pants," and the phrase "pair of pants," mean any pair of pants, pair of shorts, dress, skirt, or any other garment that would generally cover the lower torso of a wearer.
      <br/>
      Nonlimiting examples of acceptable pants include dress pants, sport pants, suit pants, casual slacks and jeans.
    </p>
    <p num="40">
      The pair of pants 100 has a front side 110 that covers the front of the wearer.
      <br/>
      The front side 110 is shown in the figure with a button, a zipper and two front pockets.
      <br/>
      The front side 110 has an outer surface 120 and an inner surface 125 and is symmetrically positioned around a central vertical axis 140.
      <br/>
      The front side 110 contains a pant waistline 105 shown as an imaginary horizontal line.
      <br/>
      The pant waistline 105 marks the location where the pair of pants 100 is supposed to contact the wearer's waist, assuming that the wearer's pant size is identical to the size marked on the pair of pants 100.
      <br/>
      The pant waistline 105 and a region that starts approximately 3" above the pant waistline 105 and ends approximately 1.5" below the pant waistline 105, and any material thereon or therein, constitute the waistband 130.
      <br/>
      Within the region that constitutes the waistband 130, two front pant connecting strips 135' are symmetrically positioned and affixed to the inner surface 125 of the front side 110 of the pair of pants 100.
    </p>

      Alternatively, the total number of pant connecting strips 135 can be less than or greater than three.
      <br/>
      Any number of pant connecting strips 135 will suffice as long as at least one pant connecting strip 135 is employed.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, the pant connecting strips 135 can be positioned in any manner.
      <br/>
      For instance, an acceptable alternative embodiment would include the use of two pant connecting strips - one on each side of the pair of pants.
    </p>
    <p num="43">
      The pant connecting strips 135 are preferably made from a noncorrosive material that can be dyed with conventional clothing dyes.

      Preferably, each self-releasing bond 300 has a tensile strength between 4 psi and 34 psi and a longitudinal shear strength between 5 psi and 40.5 psi. The self-releasing bonds 300 are formed when a connecting means of the pant connecting strips 135 contacts a connecting means on the shirt connecting strips 235.
      <br/>
      The connecting means may be an adhesive, such as a pressure sensitive adhesive, or hooks and loops to a hook and loop fastening device.
    </p>
    <p num="52">
      The self releasing bond 300 in this process is adjustable by manipulating the size and location of the surface area wherein the pant connecting strips 135 and the shirt connecting strips 235 come into contact.
      <br/>
      However, it is preferred that the surface area wherein the pant connecting strips 135 and the shirt connecting strips 235 come into contact remains at its maximum.
      <br/>
      Lowering the surface area naturally lowers the strength of the bond.
      <br/>
      However, lowering the surface area does not affect the self-releasing nature of the bond.

      FIG. 4 shows a pair of pants 100 symmetrically positioned around a central vertical axis 140 that, as in FIG. 1, has a front side 110, a back side 115, an outer surface 120 and a inner surface 125.
      <br/>
      The front side 110 and the back side 115 are horizontally partitioned by a pant waistline 105.
      <br/>
      The pant waistline 105 is shown as an imaginary line and indicates the location where the pair of pants 100 should contact the wearer's waist, assuming that the wearer's pant size is the same as the size marked on the pair of pants 100.
      <br/>
      The pant waistline 105 and a region that starts approximately 3" above the pant waistline 105 and ends approximately 1.5" below the pant waistline 105, and any material thereon or therein, constitute the waistband 130.
      <br/>
      In the area that constitutes the waistband 130, two front pant connecting strips 135' are symmetrically affixed to the front side 110 and one back pant connecting strip 135" is centrally affixed to the back side 115 of the pair of pants 100.
      <br/>
      The pair of pants 100 shown in FIG. 4 differs from that shown in FIG. 1 in that the three pant connecting strips 135 are affixed to the outer surface 120, rather than the inner surface 125 of the pair of pants 100.
    </p>
    <p num="54">
      FIG. 5 shows a shirt 200 symmetrically positioned around a central vertical axis 140 that, as in FIG. 2, has a front side 210, a back side 215, an outer surface 220 and an inner surface 225.
      <br/>
      The front side 210 and the back side 215 are horizontally partitioned by a shirt waistline 205.
      <br/>
      The shirt waistline 205 is shown as an imaginary line and indicates the location where the shirt 200 should contact the wearer's waist, assuming that the shirt size is the same as the size marked on the shirt 200.
      <br/>
      The shirt waistline 205 and a region that starts approximately 3" above the shirt waistline 205 and ends approximately 1.5" below the shirt waistline 205, and any material thereon or therein, constitute the waist zone 230.
      <br/>
      In the area that constitutes the waist zone 230, two front shirt connecting strips 235' are symmetrically affixed to the front side 210 and one back shirt connecting strip 235" is centrally affixed to the back side 215 of the shirt 200.
      <br/>
      The shirt 200 shown in FIG. 5 differs from that shown in FIG. 2 in that the three shirt connecting strips 235 are affixed to the inner surface 225, rather than the outer surface 220 of the shirt 200.
    </p>
    <p num="55">
      FIG. 6 shows the shirt 200 of FIG. 5 in combination with the pair of pants 100 of FIG. 4.
      <br/>
      In FIG. 6, the shirt connecting strips 235 on the shirt 200 have been brought into contact with the pant connecting strips 135 on the pair of a pants 100.
      <br/>
      This contact can occur naturally by allowing the shirt 200 to fall over the pair of pants 100 or can be forced by pressing the shirt 200 against the pair of pants 100.
      <br/>
      As a result of this contact, self-releasing bonds 300 form that bind the shirt 200 to the pair of pants 100.
    </p>
    <p num="56">
      As can be seen in both FIG. 3 and FIG. 6, the pant connecting strips 135 can lie on either the outer surface 120 or the inner surface 125 of the pair of a pants 100 and the shirt connecting strips 235 can lie on either the outer surface 220 or the inner surface 225 of the shirt 200.
      <br/>
      However, in all of the embodiments of this invention, a pant connecting strip 135 cannot lie on the outer surface 120 of the pair of a pants 100 when its corresponding shirt connecting strip 235 lies on the outer surface 220 of the shirt 200.
      <br/>
      Similarly, a pant connecting strip 135 cannot lie on the inner surface 125 of the pair of pants 100 when its corresponding shirt connecting strip 235 lies on the inner surface 235 of the shirt 200.
      <br/>
      Because the corresponding pant connecting strips 135 and shirt connecting strips 235 are on opposing surfaces, the connecting strips are able to connect and form the self-releasing bonds 300.
      <br/>
      It is preferable that the pant connecting strips 135 lie on the inner surface of the waistband 130 and that the shirt connecting strips 235 lie on the outer surface of the waistzone 230 so that they bind the shirt 200 into the pair of pants 100 in the more aesthetically pleasing tucked position.
      <br/>
      In this tucked configuration the fasteners are covered by the clothing and not seen by an observer.
    </p>
    <p num="57">
      As stated, the number of pant connecting strips 135 and shirt connecting strips 235 is not particularly limited in any of the embodiments of this invention.
      <br/>
      All that is required is that at least one pant connecting strip 135 and at least one shirt connecting 235 are present.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, the position of the pant connecting strips 135 around the waistband 130 and the position of the shirt connecting strips around the waistzone 230 is not particularly limited.
      <br/>
      The pant connecting strips 135 may be located only on the front side 110, or only on the back side 115, or may be aligned on both the front side 110 and the back side 115 in either a symmetrical or nonsymmetrical manner.
      <br/>
      Similarly, the shirt connecting strips 235 may be located only on the front side 210, or only on the back side 215, or may be aligned on both the front side 210 and the back side 215 in either a symmetrical or nonsymmetrical manner.
      <br/>
      However, certain numbers and arrangements of pant connecting strips 135 and shirt connecting strips 235 are preferred.
    </p>
    <p num="58">It is preferred that the total number of pant connecting strips 135 be equal to the total number of shirt connecting strips 235 to avoid waste since one of each type of strip is necessary to form a self-releasing bond 300.</p>
    <p num="59">
      It is also preferred that the pair of pants 100 is made to fit a wearer of a given pant size and that the shirt 200 is made to fit a wearer of a given shirt size and that both garments are marked identifying their respective sizes.
      <br/>
      The pant connecting strips 135 and shirt connecting strips 235 are then positioned in a corresponding fashion to naturally align and contact to form the self-releasing bonds 300 when the pair of pants 100 and the shirt 200 are worn by a wearer whose pant size and shirt size matches the pant size and the shirt size indicated on the respective garments.
    </p>
    <p num="60">To balance fastening strength and flexibility, the preferred embodiment has the following characteristics:</p>
    <p num="61">
      i) the number of pant connecting strips 135 and the number of shirt connecting strips 235 are three apiece;
      <br/>
      ii) the three pant connecting strips 135 include two front pant connecting strips 135' that are located on the front side 110 of the pair of pants 100 and one back pant connecting stip 135" that is located on the back side 115 of the pair of a pants 100, and the three shirt connecting strips 235 include two front shirt connecting strips 235' that are located on the front side 210 of the shirt 200 and one back shirt connecting strip 235" that is located on back side 215 of the shirt 200.
    </p>
    <p num="62">
      To optimally balance fastening strength and flexibility, the invention preferably meets the following criteria:
      <br/>
      i) the number of pant connecting strips 135 and the number of shirt connecting strips 235 are three apiece;
      <br/>
      ii) the three pant connecting strips 135 include two front pant connecting strips 135' that are symmetrically located with respect to a central vertical axis 140 on the front side 110 of the pair of pants 100, are about 1" wide apiece, are one twelfth to one half, preferably one sixth to one twelfth, and most preferably one ninth as long as the waistband 130, and are separated from one another by a distance that is one half to one twelfth, preferably one third to one ninth, most preferably one sixth as long as the waistband 130;
      <br/>
      iii) the three pant connecting strips 135 include one back pant connecting strip 135" that is centrally located with respect to a central vertical axis on the rear side 115 of the pair of pants 100, is about 1" wide, and is at least 1/12th, preferably at least 1/9th and most preferably at least 1/6th as long as the waistband 130;
      <br/>
      iv) the three shirt connecting strips 235 include two front shirt connecting strips 235' that are symmetrically located with respect to a central vertical axis 140 on the front side 210 of the shirt 100 and are of corresponding width, length, and separation to the first and second pant connecting strips 135; and
      <br/>
      v) the three shirt connecting strips 235 include one back shirt connecting strip 235" is centrally located with respect to a central vertical axis 140 on the rear side 215 of the shirt 200 and is of corresponding width and length to the third pant connecting strip 135.
    </p>
    <p num="63">
      If the wearer is engaged in any activity that requires frequent bending, such as playing golf, then a preferred embodiment utilizes pant connecting strips 135 located solely on the sides of the pair of pants 100 and shirt connecting strips 235 located solely on the sides of the shirt 200.
      <br/>
      In this manner the amount of shear and torque exerted against the self-releasing bonds as a result of bending, and bending and twisting, respectfully, is minimized.
    </p>
    <p num="64">
      FIG. 7 shows a hook strip 400 comprising hooks 410 located on one side of the hook strip 400, and a loop strip 405 comprising loops 415 located on one side of the loop strip 405.
      <br/>
      The hook strip 400 and the loop strip 405, in combination, form what is known in the art as a"hook and loop fastener" or a "touch fastener." Hook and loop fasteners are the preferred connecting means for forming the self-releasing bonds 300 in the instant invention.
      <br/>
      When the hooks 410 on the hook strip 400 and the loops 415 on the loop strip 405 are contacted, as demonstrated in FIG. 8, a self-releasing bond 300 is formed.
      <br/>
      Various hook and loop fasteners are commercially available under numerous trademarks, the most commonly known being VELCRO (tm) .
    </p>
    <p num="65">Hook and loop are made from the clothing materials such as nylon and/or polyester and create strong bonds using very small amounts of material.</p>
    <p num="66">
      As demonstrated by FIG. 9 hook and loop fasteners are adjustable.
      <br/>
      In FIG. 9, a hook strip 400 is overlapped by a loop strip 405.
      <br/>
      The overlapping surface area 300 can be varied in size and location simply by moving one strip relative to the other.
      <br/>
      Therefore, if any hindrance occurs to the movement of the wearer, the fastener can be adjusted to minimize the hindrance.
    </p>
    <p num="67">
      Most importantly, the bonds provided by hook and loop fasteners self-release in a reusable manner when subjected to a force that below the tensile and/or shearing force required to tear the pair of pants 100 or the shirt 200.
      <br/>
      Typical hook and loop fasteners have a tensile strength between 4 psi and 34 psi and a longitudinal shear strength between 5 psi and 40.5 psi.
    </p>
    <p num="68">
      However, small vibrational forces do not break the bond of a hook and loop fastener.
      <br/>
      In fact, such light shaking causes the hooks to move deeper into the loops and actually improves the bond of hook and loop fastener.
    </p>
    <p num="69">In addition, hook and loop fasteners are generally made of water resistant and chemical resistant materials such as nylon and/or polyester that are dyeable using conventional clothing dyes.</p>
    <p num="70">
      Utilizing hook and loop fasteners, a shirt can be tucked taught inside a pair of pants without creping out and requiring retucking.
      <br/>
      The hook and loop fasteners, because they are sewn into the clothing can be firmly affixed above the waistline at or near the belly button to enable a wearer to present a neat appearance that, simultaneously, hides physical imperfections such as an expansive stomach.
    </p>
    <p num="71">
      It is envisioned, and certainly embraced by this invention, that a entire clothing line of pants 100 containing pant connecting strips 135 and shirts 200 containing shirt connecting strips 235 can be created.
      <br/>
      The wearer can mix and match from a variety of styles and sizes of both pants 100 and shirts 200 to create an entire wardrobe wherein each pair of pants 100 is capable of forming self-releasing bonds with each shirt 200.

      <br/>
      Although the number of unaffixed connecting strips 500 in FIG. 10 is three, the number is not limited as long as it is equal to or greater than the number of affixed pant connecting strips 135 or affixed shirt connecting strips 235.
      <br/>
      Preferably, to avoid waste, the number of unaffixed connecting strips 500 is equal to the number of affixed pant connecting strips 135 or affixed shirt connecting strips 235.

      In addition, or alternatively, the markings or openings 520 on the template 515 illustrate positions for binding one or more of the unaffixed connecting strips 500 to the shirt 200 when the template 515 is properly aligned.
      <br/>
      Proper alignment of the template 515 on a pair of pants 100 requires that the template 515 be placed horizontally across the pair of pants 100 parallel to the pant waistline 105 within the waistband 230.
      <br/>
      Generally, placing the template 515 parallel with the upper rim of the pair of pants immediately above any pockets and zippers will meet this limitation.
      <br/>
      Proper alignment of the template 515 on a shirt 200 requires that the template 515 be placed horizontally across the shirt 200 parallel to the shirt waistline 205 within the waist zone 230.
      <br/>
      Generally, placing the template 515 parallel and a few inches above the lower edge of the shirt, at point where the shirt would first begin to overlap most pairs of pants worn by the wearer, will meet this limitation.

      The process comprises a first step 600 wherein pant connecting strips are affixed to the waistband area of a pair of pants.
      <br/>
      In a second step, shirt connecting strips are affixed to the waistzone of a shirt.
      <br/>
      The first and second steps may be 605 reversed or carried out concurrently.
      <br/>
      In a third step 610, the pant connecting strips are contacted with the shirt connecting strips to form a self-releasing bond.
    </p>
    <p num="84">
      Preferably, to ensure proper positioning of the pant connecting strips onto the pair of pants and the shirt connecting strips onto the shirt, one or more templates is used.
      <br/>
      A template comprises one or more openings therein or markings thereon.
      <br/>
      The markings or openings on the template illustrate the positions for bonding one or more of the pant connecting strips when the template is placed parallel to the pant waistline within the waistband.
      <br/>
      In addition, or alternatively, the markings or openings on the template illustrate positions for binding one or more of the shirt connecting strips to the shirt when the template is placed parallel to the shirt waistline within the waist zone.
    </p>
    <p num="85">
      The pant connecting strips and shirt connecting strips in this process are made from a noncorrosive material that can be dyed with conventional clothing dyes.
      <br/>
      Such materials include nylon and/or polyester.
    </p>
    <p num="86">
      The self releasing bond in this process is adjustable by manipulating the size and location of the surface area wherein the pant connecting strips and the shirt connecting strips come into contact.
      <br/>
      However, it is preferred that the surface area wherein the pant connecting strips and the shirt connecting strips come into contact remains at its maximum.
      <br/>
      Lowering the surface area naturally lowers the strength of the bond.
      <br/>
      However, lowering the surface area does not affect the self-releasing nature of the bond.
    </p>
    <p num="87">When the pair of pants is made to fit a wearer with a given pant size and the shirt is made to fit a wearer of a given shirt size and each garment is marked accordingly, the pant connecting strips and shirt connecting strips naturally align and come into contact to form the self-releasing bonds whenever the pair of pants and the shirt are worn by a wearer whose pant size and shirt size matches the pant size and shirt size indicated on the markers.</p>
    <p num="88">Preferably, the number, size, ratio and positioning of the pant connecting strips and shirt connecting strips used in this process are identical to the preferences discussed previously in this application with regard to the clothing combination embodiments.</p>
    <p num="89">
      Ideally, the pant connecting strips are hook strips and shirt connecting strips are loop strips, or visa versa, so that the pant connecting strips and shirt connecting strips combine to form one or more hook and loop fasteners.
      <br/>
