    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">
      Antiviral agents currently in use are of limited effectiveness in treating dermal infections caused by viruses.
      <br/>
      For example, herpes simplex labialis, commonly referred to as "cold sores" do not respond to the topical treatment with acyclovir (Spruance et al. , Am. J. Med., 73(1A):315-319 (1982); Shaw et al., Br. Med. J. (Clin. Res. Ed.), 291(6487):7-9 (1985); Raborn, et al., Oral Surg.
      <br/>
      Oral Med. Oral Pathol., 67(6):676-679 (1989); Spruance, et al., Antimicrob.
      <br/>
      Agents Chemother., 25(5):553-555 (1984); Raborn, et al., J. Can. Dent. Assoc., 55(2):135-137 (1989)).
      <br/>
      Oral administration of acyclovir for the treatment of cold sores is only partially effective (Spruance et al., J. Infect. Diseases 161:185 (1990)).
    </p>
    <p num="3">
      The limited effectiveness of antiviral agents such as acyclovir applied topically to cold sores and other dermal viral infections is thought to be a consequence of the limited ability of most of these agents to penetrate the skin (Parry, et al., J. Invest. Dermatol., 98(6):856-863 (1992); Spruance, et al., Antimicrob.
      <br/>
      Agents Chemother., 25(1):10-15 (1984)).
      <br/>
      Topical treatments for genital herpes infections are also ineffective for the same reason.
      <br/>
      Consequently, there is a need for new antiviral agents which can penetrate the skin and which are active against viruses which cause dermal infections.
    </p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="4">
      Lipophilic phosphotriester prodrugs of acyclovir, as disclosed in U.S. Ser. No. 08/635,653, filed Apr. 22, 1996, (the entire teachings of which are hereby incorporated by reference), are extremely active topically against herpes virus infection.
      <br/>
      The present invention is based on the discovery that the corresponding phosphodiester prodrugs of acyclovir, which are nonlipophilic and water soluble, are even more effective antiviral drugs than phosphotriesters and more effective than acyclovir.
      <br/>
      For example, treatment of guinea pigs with dermal herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV-1) infections with Prodrug 1 and Prodrug 2 resulted in a dramatic reduction in lesion number, in lesion area and in lesion virus titer (Examples 1 and 3) when compared to its vehicle.
      <br/>
      In contrast, comparable treatment with U.S. ZOVIRAX (acyclovir) provided results that were statistically the same as with placebo.  (Chemical Structure image '2' not included in text)  R=--CO--C(CH3)3  3)

      In one embodiment, the present invention is a prodrug of acyclovir, an analog of acyclovir, acyclovir monophosphate or an acyclovir monophosphate analog.
      <br/>
      The prodrug is represented by Structural Formula (I):  (Chemical Structure image '3' not included in text)

      Another embodiment of the present invention is a method of treating a viral infection in an individual or animal.
      <br/>
      The method comprises administering to the individual or animal a therapeutically effective amount of a prodrug represented by Structural Formula (I).
    </p>
    <p num="11">
      Another embodiment of the present invention is a method of preparing the prodrugs of the invention and intermediate used in the synthesis of phosphate ester prodrugs, including the diester prodrugs represented by Structural Formula (I), phosphotriester prodrugs disclosed in U.S. Ser. No. 08/310,972, filed Sep. 23, 1994, and the phosphotriester prodrugs disclosed in U.S. Ser. No. 08/635,553.

    <p num="14">
      The method for preparing the intermediate comprises reacting Y'--OH, a weak anhydrous organic acid such as tetrazole and (A--O)2 --P(NR21 R22) in an aprotic, polar organic solvent.
      <br/>
      Suitable aprotic, polar organic amide solvents include dialkyl amide solvents (e.g., dimethylformamide (DMF) or N,N-dimethylacetamide), tetraalkylurea solvents (e.g., 1,3-d-methylimidazolinone or 1,3-dimethyl-3,4,5,6-tetrahydro-2(1H)-pyrimidinone); dialkyl sulfoxide solvents (e.g., dimethylsulfoxide and tetramethylene sulfoxides) and phosphoramide solvents (e.g., hexamethylphosphoramide).
      <br/>
      Preferred solvents are dialkyl amides.
      <br/>
      DMF is most preferred.
      <br/>
      R21 and R22 are each independently a lower alkyl, an aryl group or, taken together with the phosphoramide nitrogen, can form a five, six or seven membered nitrogen-containing heterocyclic ring (preferably a saturated heterocyclic ring).
      <br/>
      The lower alkyl, aryl or heterocyclic compound represented by R12 and R22 can optionally be substituted with one or more groups which do not react (or are substantially inert) with the P-N bond or with the weak acid.
      <br/>
      Preferred examples of substituents include non-nucleophilic, non-basic inert groups such as halides, (lower alkyl)--O--, lower alkyl and aryl.
      <br/>
      Preferably, R21 and R22 are each a lower alkyl group such as ethyl.

      The phosphodiester acyclovir prodrugs disclosed herein are more active against dermal herpes simplex virus 1 infections than acyclovir or the phosphotriester prodrugs of acyclovir disclosed in U.S. Ser. No. 08/635,553.
      <br/>
      In addition, the phosphodiester prodrugs or acyclovir disclosed herein are chemically more stable, have longer shelf lives and are generally easier to formulate than the phosphotriester prodrugs disclosed in U.S. Ser. No. 08/635,553.

      FIG. 2 is a schematic showing the synthesis of phosphate triesters by reacting the nucleoside analog Y--OH, (A--O)2 --P--N-(ethyl)2 and tetrazole in a dimethylformamide and oxidizing the resulting phosphite triester product with hydrogen peroxide.
    </p>
    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="17">
      Disclosed herein are novel prodrugs of drugs such as acyclovir, which are nucleoside analogs.
      <br/>
      The disclosed prodrugs show increased effectiveness compared with the parent drugs.
      <br/>
      Also described are improved methods of preparing phosphate triester prodrugs of nucleoside analogs.
      <br/>
      These methods are also useful in the preparation of the disclosed phosphodiester prodrugs.
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      The effectiveness of antiviral agents such as acyclovir and acyclovir analogs can be enhanced by converting the agent into a phosphorus containing prodrug represented by Structural Formula (I).
      <br/>
      Phosphorus containing prodrugs are described in U.S. Ser. Nos. 08/635,553, 07/714,130, 07/537,332 and 08/310,972, the entire teachings of which are hereby incorporated into this application by reference.
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      A prodrug, as used herein, is an agent which can be metabolized in vivo, i.e. undergoes biotransformation, to give the pharmacologically active agent or a monophosphate of the pharmacologically active agent. "Metabolized" refers to chemical or biochemical reactions which the prodrug undergoes in vivo.
      <br/>
      Examples include enzyme catalyzed reactions and reactions which occur in solution such as solvolysis, hydrolysis and elimination reactions.
    </p>
    <p num="20">
      Use of a prodrug for treating an individual can have advantages over the parent drug, e.g. greater lipophilicity to enhance delivery of the pharmacologically active agent across cell membranes or into the stratum corneum of the skin.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, lipid solubility is a desirable property for antiviral drugs.
      <br/>
      The prodrugs of the present invention have a lipophilic portion that allows the prodrug to penetrate into the stratum corneum of the skin and yet are charged molecules which are highly soluble in water and which can be transformed in vivo into acyclovir, an analog of acyclovir, acyclovir monophosphate or an analog of acyclovir monophosphate.
    </p>
    <p num="21">
      As used herein, an "acyclovir analog" is an antiviral purine with a substituted alkyl group (e.g., a C3 to about a C12 substituted alkyl group) bonded to nitrogen nine.
      <br/>
      As used herein, a "purine" has a pyrimidine ring fused to an imidazole ring.
      <br/>
      It will be understood that tautomeric forms of a purine are also included, such as in the structure shown for Prodrug 1.
      <br/>
      Examples of purines include adanine and guanine.
    </p>
    <p num="22">The carbon atoms of the purine can be bonded to or substituted by, for example, a hydrogen, halogen, hydroxy, (lower alkyl)-O--, thio, (lower alkyl)thio, amino, (lower alkyl)amino, di(lower alkyl)amino, (lower alkyl)-CO--NH-- or azide.</p>
    <p num="23">
      The alkyl or substituted alkyl group bonded to nitrogen nine of the purine (nitrogen nine is indicated in Structural Formula (III) can optionally have an ether, thioether or amine moiety linkage within the chain and is straight chained or branched.
      <br/>
      The substituted alkyl group can have one or more substituents, such as, hydroxy, amino, --NH(lower alkyl), (lower alkyl)-O--, (substituted lower alkyl)-O--, aryl, substituted aryl, aryloxy, substituted aryloxy, (lower alkyl)NH--SO2 --O--, (substituted lower alkyl)NH--SO2 --O--, (aryl)NH--SO2 --O--, (substituted aryl)NH--SO2 --O--, phosphate, --NH--CO-(lower alkyl), --NH--CO-(substituted lower alkyl), --NH--CO-aryl, --NH--CO-(substituted aryl), (lower alkyl)-CO--, (substituted lower alkyl)-CO--, --CO-aryl and --CO-(substituted aryl).
      <br/>
      Lower alkyl, substituted lower alkyl, aryl and substituted aryl are defined hereinbelow.

    <p num="25">
      X is sulphur, --NH--, --N(lower alkyl)-, or oxygen;
      <br/>
      Ra is hydrogen, halogen, hydroxy, (lower alkyl)-O--, azide, thio, (lower alkyl)thio, amino, (lower alkyl)amino or di(lower alkyl)amino;

      Aryl is preferably phenyl;

      Re is hydrogen, lower alkyl, substituted lower alkyl, aryl, substituted aryl, (lower alkyl)O--, (substituted lower alkyl)O--, aryloxy and substituted aryloxy; and

    </p>
    <p num="26">In a preferred embodiment, Y is represented by Structural Formula (IV):  (Chemical Structure image '6' not included in text)</p>
    <p num="27">
      As seen from Structural Formula (IV), when acyclovir or an acyclovir analog is used to form a prodrug of the present invention, Rf in Structural Formula (III) is a covalent bond between acyclovir or the acyclovir analog and an oxygen bonded to a phosphorus atom of the prodrug.
      <br/>
      For example, in Structural Formula (I) Rf is a covalent bond between Y and an oxygen bonded to phosphorus, referred to herein as a "phosphoester bond".
      <br/>
      The covalent bond between A and O is also a phosphoester bond.
    </p>
    <p num="28">Specific examples of suitable acyclovir analogs are provided in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,199,574, 4,294,831 and 4,323,573, the entire teachings of which are hereby incorporated into this patent application by reference.</p>
    <p num="29">
      In a preferred embodiment, Ra is --OH, Rb is --NH2 and X is oxygen.
      <br/>
      It is most preferred that Rc, Rd, and Re are each --H and Rf is a phosphoester bond between Y and an oxygen of the phosphate of the prodrug, i.e. Y, together with a hydroxy group, is acyclovir.
    </p>
    <p num="30">The following is a description of the present invention with respect to prodrugs comprising phosphate groups, e.g., prodrugs represented by Structural Formula (I).</p>
    <p num="31">
      A is a group which can be metabolized in vivo to give a chemically modified A (A').
      <br/>
      As a result of the biotransformation, the phosphoester of the prodrug which comprises modified A (A') undergoes cleavage in vivo.
      <br/>
      Cleavage of the phosphoester can result, for example, from the heterolytic cleavage of the oxygen-carbon bond of the phosphoester group comprising a modified A (A').
      <br/>
      In this instance, the phosphate acts as a leaving group.
      <br/>
      Cleavage in vivo of a phosphoester comprising modified A (A') will be enhanced relative to a phosphoester comprising A if biotransformation in vivo results in a greater electron density on the carbon atom to which the phosphate is bonded in modified A (A') than on the carbon atom to which the phosphate is bonded in A.
    </p>
    <p num="32">
      For example, a compound having a structure represented by Structural Formula (I) will be cleaved more rapidly in vivo when A is a benzyl with an electron donating group in the ortho or para position than when A is an unsubstituted benzyl group.
      <br/>
      Thus, A can be, for example, a substituted benzyl croup that undergoes biotransformation in vivo such that groups already present at the ortho and/or para positions are converted into groups that are more strongly electron donating in modified A (A') than in A.
    </p>
    <p num="33">
      Protected hydroxy groups such as acyloxy groups (e.g., lower alkyl-CO--O-- and aryl-CO--O--), carbonate groups (e.g., --O--CO--O-lower alkyl and --O--CO--O-aryl), carbamate groups (e.g., --O--CO--NH-lower alkyl and --O--CO--NH-aryl) and protected aryl amine groups such as acylamine groups (e.g., lower alkyl-CO--NH-- and aryl-CO--NH--) are only very slightly electron donating, but can be converted (e.g. unmasked) in vivo into the strongly electron donating hydroxy or amino groups, respectively.
      <br/>
      For example the Hammett para sigma+constant for the acetoxy group and the acetyl amino group are -0.06 and -0.60, respectively.
      <br/>
      In contrast, the hydroxy group and the amino group are strongly electron donating.
      <br/>
      The Hammett para sigma+constant for the hydroxy and amino groups are -0.92 and -1.7, respectively.
      <br/>
      The ionized hydroxy group (--O-) is even more electron donating with a Hammett para sigma+constant that has been estimated at -2.3. Chapman, N. B. and Shorter, J., Correlation Analysis in Chemistry, Plenum Press, NY, N.Y., page 483-484; Vogel, P., Carbocation Chemistry, Elsevier, NY, N.Y. (1985) page 243; Hansch, C., Comprehensive Medicinal Chemistry, Pergamon Press, NY, N.Y., 4:235.
    </p>
    <p num="34">
      The unmasking of a phenol can be carried out in vivo by enzymnes.
      <br/>
      For example, nonspecific esterase is ubiquitous within the cytoplasm of cells and is able to cleave a wide variety of carboxylate esters.
      <br/>
      Phenolic carbonates and carbamates are degraded by cellular enzymes Lo yield phenols (Ditter et al., J. Pharm. Sci. 57:783 (1968); Ditter et al., J. Pharm. Sci. 57:828 (1968); Ditter et al., J. Pharm. Sci. 58:557 (1969); King et al., Biochemistry 26:2294 (1987); Lindberg et al., Drug Metabolism and Disposition 17:311 (1989); and Tunek et al., Biochem. Pharm. 37:3867 (1988)).
      <br/>
      The unmasking of a phenol can also occur by hydrolysis.
      <br/>
      For example, a wide variety of carbonate and carbamate groups are known which undergo spontaneous cleavage in solution at kinetically favorable rates (Saari et al., J. Med. Chem. 33:97 (1990) and Rattie et al., J. Pharm. Sci. 59:1741 (1970)).
      <br/>
      When A is a substituted benzyl group, cleavage of, for example, a (lower alkyl)-CO--O--, --O--CO--O-(lower alkyl) or --O--CO--NH-(lower alkyl) group in the ortho or para position to give a modified A (A') will trigger heterolytic fission of the C--O bond between modified A (A') and the oxygen of the phosphate.
      <br/>
      Based on the above considerations the conversion of, for example, an ortho and/or papa (lower alkyl)-CO--O--, --O--CO--O-(lower alkyl) or --O--CO--NH-(lower alkyl) group into a hydroxy group will lead to a rate increase of phosphoester fission of at least 7000 fold.
      <br/>
      If the resulting hydroxy group is ionized to an oxyanion, O-, the rate of solvolysis can be further increased about 2 * 1010 fold.
      <br/>
      Based on an intracellular pH of 7 and a pKa of 10 for the phenolic hydroxy group about 0.1% of the hydroxy groups will be ionized under physiological conditions.
      <br/>
      The net result is that overall a rate increase on the order of 2 * 107 fold can occur in the heterolytic cleavage of the C--O bond between modified A (A') and the oxygen of the phosphoester following cleavage of an ortho or para acyloxy group in A by nonspecific esterase.

      In a preferred embodiment, the prodrugs of the present invention are synthesized by replacing one of the hydroxy groups on the phosphorous atoms of the monophosphate parent drug with a group "A--O--", wherein the group "A" is a substituted benzyl derivative with one or more protected hydroxy groups (e.g., (lower alkyl)-CO--O--, aryl-CO--O, --O--CO--O-(lower alkyl), --O--CO--O-aryl, --O--CO--NH-(lower alkyl) and --O--CO--NH-aryl) or protected amine groups (e.g., (lower alkyl)-CO--NH--, (aryl)-CO--NH--, (lower alkyl)-O--CO--NH--, aryl-O--CO--NH--, (lower alkyl)-NH--CO--NH-- and aryl-NH--CO--N--) in ortho or para positions relative to the phosphoester.
      <br/>
      The monophosphate of the parent drug is liberated following conversion of the protected hydroxy group or protected amino group into the corresponding hydroxy group or amino group, respectively.
      <br/>
      The monophosphate of the parent drug can be converted to the parent drug by the action of enzymes such as alkaline phosphatases.

    <p num="36">
      Preferably, A is a substituted benzyl group which is further substituted at the benzylic position by a moiety which facilitates cleavage of the phosphoester bond.

      More preferably, A is substituted at the benzylic position by a moiety such that cleavage of the phosphoester bond between A or A' and the phosphate oxygen will result in an elimination reaction to form a double bond between the benzylic carbon and the moiety.

      Suitable moieties generally comprise a methylene or methine group, wherein said methylene or methine group is 1) bonded to the benzylic position of A and 2) has an acidic hydrogen.
      <br/>
      Upon cleavage of the phosphoester in vivo, A or A' can then undergo an elimination reaction by loss of the phosphate bonded to the benzylic carbon and the acidic hydrogen to form a carbon-carbon double bond at the benzylic position.

      Alternatively or additionally, a preferred prodrug of the invention is degraded to acyclovir monophosphate or an analog of acyclovir monophosphate by an elimination reaction triggered by the spontaneous or enzymatic unmasking of a strongly electron donating group, such as a hydroxy or amino group at the ortho or para positions of a benzyl group represented by A.

      Procedures for preparing phosphate ester prodrugs of nucleoside analogs (e.g., acyclovir) include using phosphoamidites in conjunction with H-tetrazole (see Perich and Johns, Synthesis 1988:142).

      These procedures are described in U.S. Ser. Nos. 07/714,130, 07/537,332 and 08/310,972, the entire teachings of which have been incorporated into this application by reference.
      <br/>
      However, these procedures suffer from a number of shortcomings.
      <br/>
      Nucleoside analogs such as acyclovir are insufficiently soluble in the organic solvents normally used for this reaction, e.g., methylene chloride, chloroform, acetonitrile, tetrahydrofuran and pyridine.
      <br/>
      As a result, the nucleoside analog (e.g., acyclovir) must be protected to enhance its solubility and prevent side reactions, thereby increasing the cost of preparing phosphate ester prodrugs.
      <br/>
      Alternative methods have been reported which use phosphorus oxychloride in conjunction with trimethyl or triethyl phosphate as solvent (see U.S. Pat. No. 4,287,188).
      <br/>
      However, trialkyl phosphates are toxic carcinogens with alkylating activity.

    <p num="56">
      Described below are novel synthetic methods for preparing phosphate esters prodrugs of nucleoside analogs which overcome these disadvantages.

      Using these methods, phosphate esters prodrugs of nucleoside analogs such as acyclovir can be prepared in nearly quantitative yield without protecting acyclovir or the nucleoside analog.
      <br/>
      Acyclovir or a nucleoside analog Y'--OH suspended in an aprotic polar organic solvent reacts rapidly and quantitatively with phosphoramidites (A--O)2 --P--(NR21 R22) in the presence of a weak anhydrous organic acid to produce the corresponding phosphite ester, which can be oxidized without isolation with a phosphite oxidizing agent to the corresponding phosphate triester.
      <br/>
      This reaction sequence is shown schematically in FIG. 2.
      <br/>
      The phosphate triester can be converted to the diester prodrug in the presence of a base, for example, an amine base such as triethyl amine.

      <br/>
      Examples of suitable bases include, but are not limited to, hydroxide, amines (e.g., ammonia, an alkyl amine, a dialkyl amine or a trialkyl amine), alkoxides and hydride bases (e.g., sodium or potassium hydride).
      <br/>
      At least one equivalent of base per mole of phosphate triester is generally used.
