    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="1">
      A farm implement can only be so wide and still be manageable in traveling between fields including use of public highways.
      <br/>
      Thus, multiple implements will be hitched in side-by-side relationship for field use and then positioned one behind the other for transport.
      <br/>
      There are many complicated hitch arrangements that address this need, but they suffer from being overly complex in structure and operation.
      <br/>
      What is needed is a simplified hitch that will readily allow a pair of implements to be quickly moved between a side-by-side field position and a trailing transport position.
    </p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">
      Each of a pair of implements have a tongue assembly and a link extends between the implements connecting them together and pivots from a laterally extending position when the implements are in a field position to a position parallel to the line of travel when the implements are in a transport position.
      <br/>
      The link has posts at opposite ends which connect to the tongue assemblies of the implements.
      <br/>
      The link is telescopically extendable and has a hinge allowing the second implement to follow the contour of the land in both field and transport positions.
    </p>
    <p num="3">The tongue assembly of the second implement is pivotable between a forwardly extending position where it is connected to the tongue assembly of the first implement when the implements are in the field position to a laterally extending storage position when the implements are in a transport position.</p>
    <p num="4">The tongue assemblies of both the first and second implements have hinges allowing the implements to follow the contour of the ground when the implements are in the field position.</p>
    <p num="5">
      While the hitch assembly of this invention is suitable for implements performing a wide variety of different functions, it is particularly suitable for use with hay rake equipment, such as windrow fluffers.
      <br/>
      Windrow fluffers in the tandem side-by-side field position may each receive a windrow of hay and selectively discharge the hay into separate rows to the left, to the right, to the center, to the left and right, and to combine two or more windrows for harvesting two windrows at the same time

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="7">
      The hitch assembly of this invention is referred to generally by the reference numeral 10 in FIG. 4 and includes individual tongue assemblies 12 and 14 for windrow fluffers 16 and 18 respectively.
      <br/>
      A link assembly 20 interconnects the implements 16 and 18 through the tongue assemblies 12 and 14.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      The tongue assembly 12 includes a forward section 22 pivotally interconnected through a hinge 24 to a rear section 26 in turn pivotally connected at 28 to a frame 30.
      <br/>
      A hydraulic cylinder 32 connected to the frame 30 is connected to the rear tongue section 26 for pivoting the tongue assembly 12 between the field position of FIG. 3 and the transport of FIG. 1.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      The forward section 22 of the tongue assembly 12 further includes a ball-type connector 34 to which a socket 36 on the forward end of the forward section 38 of the second implement tongue assembly 14 is connected.
      <br/>
      A rear section 40 is pivotally connected through a hinge 42 to the forward section 38.
      <br/>
      The rear section 40 is in turn pivotally connected at 44 to a frame 46 of the second implement 18.
    </p>
    <p num="10">The link assembly 20 includes at its opposite ends vertical posts 48 and 50 connected to the frames 30 and 46 and as seen in FIG. 5 extends over the front implement 16 when the implements are in the trailing transport position.</p>
    <p num="11">
      The link assembly 20 includes a pair of telescopic members 52 and 54 interconnected by a hydraulic cylinder 56 which allows for varying the distance between the implements 16 and 18 when in both their field and transport positions as shown in FIGS. 1, 4 and 7.
      <br/>
      The link member 54 includes a pivot hinge 58 which allows the trailing implement 18 to follow the contour of the ground when either in the field or transport position.
      <br/>
      A hydraulic cylinder 60 is connected between the frame 30 of the first implement 16 and the link member 52 of the link assembly 20 for pivoting the link assembly and in turn the implement 18 between the field position of FIG. 4 and the transport position of FIG. 1.
      <br/>
      The implement 18 is able to pivot through a three-way hinge 51 interconnecting the link member 52 to the post 50 and thereby move freely without restriction over the ground.
    </p>
    <p num="12">
      It is thus seen in operation that the three hydraulic cylinders 32, 56 and 60 allow for moving the implement 18 between the field position of FIG. 4 and the transport position of FIG. 1.
      <br/>
      The hydraulic cylinder 32 positions the tongue assembly 12 of the implement 16 in the range of positions shown in FIGS. 1, 4 and 7.
      <br/>
      The hydraulic cylinder 60 connected to the link assembly 20 pivots the implement 18 from the side-by-side position to the trailing position while the hydraulic cylinder 56 is operated to provide the desired spacing between the implements 16 and 18.
    </p>
    <p num="13">When the implement 18 is in the transport position of FIG. 1 the tongue assembly 14 is folded into a storage position with the forward section 38 laying on top of the rearward section 40.</p>
    <p num="14">In FIGS. 8-11 the windrow fluffers 16 and 18 can be operated to direct windrows 62 and 64 to any desired position among a number of options as illustrated.</p>
