    </p>
    <p num="13">
      FIG. 2 shows the memory storage device cooler generally designated with the reference numeral 16.
      <br/>
      The memory storage device cooler 16 includes a frame 26 and an electromagnetic interference (EMI) shield 28, a pair of fans 30, an air filter 34 and a cover 36 which attach to the frame 26.
    </p>
    <p num="14">
      The frame 26 has face 38 with a front 40 and a back 42.
      <br/>
      The EMI shield 28 covers a portion of the back 42 to shield EMI which may escape, or enter the housing though the frame 26.
      <br/>
      The EMI shield 28 is fabricated from a magnetically conductive material.
      <br/>
      According to one aspect of the invention, the shield 28 is fabricated from steel sheet metal.
      <br/>
      According to other aspects of the invention, the shield 28 is fabricated from a material selected from the following: magnetically conductive polymer, aluminum, metal mesh, and honeycombed layers of metal.
      <br/>

    </p>
    <p num="16">
      The face 44 of the EMI shield 28 includes a protective grill 48 extending across the vent 46.
      <br/>
      The grill 48 has a pair of cross members 50.
      <br/>
      The cross members 50 align perpendicularly with respect to each other.
      <br/>
      A pair of circular members 52 reinforce the cross members 50.
      <br/>
      The circular members 52 are sheet metal arcs which and concentrically align with respect to each other.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, the grill 48 protects the fans 30 and inhibits electromagnetic interference though the frame 26.
      <br/>
      The frame 26 also includes cross members 82 which separate the air filter 34 from the fans 30.
      <br/>

      <br/>
      The back side 60 and the two other sides 61 of the EMI shield 28 surround the fan 30 on three sides.
      <br/>
      It can be appreciated that this example of an EMI shield configuration is but one of the many possible configurations which shield EMI in accordance with the present invention.
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      The cover 36 has a periphery 70 and a pair of attachment devices 72 extending from the periphery 70 on opposing sides of the cover 36.
      <br/>
      The frame 26 includes detents 74 for receiving the attachment devices 72.
      <br/>
      The attachment devices 72 snap the cover 36 to the frame 26.
      <br/>

      <br/>
      The periphery 70 is oval shaped and has at least a pair of slots 78 aligned within the periphery 70, adjacent the attachment devices 72.
      <br/>
      The slots 78 enable radially inward pressure against the periphery 70 near the slots 78, in the direction of the arrows 80, to flex the periphery 70 radially inwards and thereby release the attachment devices 72 from the frame 26.
      <br/>
      Releasing the attachment devices 72 enables removal of the cover 36 and the air filter 34 so that the air filter 34 can be cleaned.
    </p>
    <p num="20">
