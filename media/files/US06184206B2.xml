      Specifically, the invention provides a method of disaggregating an existing platelet thrombus in a blood vessel in a subject, comprising administering to the subject a compound which dissociates fibrinogen bound to a first site on platelet glycoprotein IIB-IIIa, by binding a second interacting site on the platelet glycoprotein IIB-IIIa, thereby disaggregating the platelet thrombus.
      <br/>
      The present invention also provides a method of screening compounds for the ability to dissociate a ligand from its integrin receptor by binding an interacting second site, comprising contacting the compound with an existing ligand:integrin receptor complex and determining if the complex dissociates.

      Field of the Invention
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      The present invention is related to the field of dissociating ligands from the receptors to which they bind.
      <br/>
      In particular, the present invention relates to dissociating ligands from integrins and thus treating diseases or conditions associated with binding of the ligands.
    </p>
    <p num="5">2. Background Art</p>
    <p num="6">
      Anti-platelet compounds are useful in treating many cardiovascular diseases including myocardial infarction, restenosis, unstable angina and possibly even atherosclerosis.
      <br/>
      One target for anti-platelet drugs is the platelet surface receptor called GPIIb-IIa.
      <br/>
      GPIIb-IIIa is an  ALPHA  BETA  heterodimer present on the platelet surface and is the platelet fibrinogen receptor.
      <br/>
      At wounds or sites of vascular injury, GPIIb-IIIa mediates platelet adhesion and platelet aggregation.
      <br/>
      The formation of these platelet thrombi halt blood loss.
      <br/>
      Unfortunately, platelets can also adhere aberrantly to blood vessel walls, particularly at sites of atherosclerotic plaques.
      <br/>
      These platelet-rich thrombi can cause unstable angina and when activated, can lead to myocardial infarct.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      GPIIb-IIa is a member of the integrin protein family of cell adhesion receptors.
      <br/>
      GPIIb-IIIa is one of the integrins that can bind to the arg-gly-asp (RGD) peptide motif.
      <br/>
      This peptide motif is found within a number of adhesive proteins and also in several of the ligands for IIb-IIIa.
      <br/>
      The primary physiologic ligand for GPIIb-IIIa is fibrinogen, a soluble plasma borne protein that contains two RGD motifs.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      There is now great interest in developing small molecule antagonists of IIb-IIIa.
      <br/>
      Many candidate antagonists of IIb-IIIa have been developed.
      <br/>
      Most of these are structural mimics of RGD.
      <br/>
      Current understanding of IIb-IIIa indicates that it contains a single ligand binding pocket which can bind to both RGD and to the gamma chain sequence of fibrinogen.
      <br/>
      Hence, it is believed that antagonists of IIb-IIIa which bind at this single ligand binding site will be efficacious in preventing the formation of platelet aggregates because they will block the association of fibrinogen with IIb-IIIa.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      The present invention provides evidence that IIb-IIIa contains at least two ligand binding pockets and that these two sites are interacting (FIG. 2).
      <br/>
      The present invention also provides evidence that ligands which bind at Ligand Binding Site I can enact the dissociation of ligand that is already pre-bound at Site II.
      <br/>
      Because of their unique ability to induce the dissociation of fibrinogen from IIb-IIIa, these antagonists are called Integrin-Ligand Dissociators.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, the present invention demonstrates that Integrin-Ligand Dissociators are able to enact the dissolution of pre-formed platelet aggregates.
      <br/>
      These findings indicate a novel approach toward anti-platelet therapy that is a strong departure from the current prophylactic strategy of applying antagonist prior to formation of vascular occlusions.
      <br/>
      Rather, the present invention demonstrates that the Integrin-Ligand Dissociators of this invention can be applied to reverse platelet aggregates that have already formed.

    <heading>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading>
    <p num="14">
      FIGS. 1A and 1B. Fibrinogen and Fab-9 bind distinct sites on IIb-IIIa. Studies were conducted with purified IIb-IIIa to determine whether Fab-9 (an RGD mimic) and fibrinogen bind to the same site on the integrin. IIb-IIIa was immobilized in microtiter plates and was allowed to bind either 125 I-fibrinogen (FIG. 1A) or to 125 I-Fab-9 (FIG. 1B). The binding of 125 I-fibrinogen was challenged with unlabeled Fab-9. Similarly, the binding of 125 I-Fab-9 was challenged with unlabeled fibrinogen. Although Fab-9 blocks the binding of fibrinogen (FIG. 1A), fibrinogen does not interfere with the binding of Fab-9 (FIG. 1B)
      <br/>
      FIG. 2. A proposed model of two interacting ligand binding sites on IIb-IIIa. Ligand Binding Site I interacts with RGD ligands including 52012 and Fab-9. Fibrinogen binds to Ligand Binding Site II.
      <br/>
      FIGS. 3A and 3B. RGD Ligands dissociate fibrinogen from IIb-IIIa. Studies were conducted to determine if RGD ligands like Fab-9 and 52012 can dissociate fibrinogen that is pre-bound to IIb-IIIa. FIG. 3A: 125 I-fibrinogen was allowed to bind to purified IIb-IIIa, and free ligand was removed by washing. Then, the complex was incubated in buffer alone, buffer containing 10 nM Fab-9 or 50 nM 52012. FIG. 3B: A similar experiment was performed to determine if 52012 could dissociate Fab-9 from purified IIb-IIIa.
      <br/>
      FIGS. 4A and 4B. Measuring the ability of 52012 to dissociate fibrinogen and Fab-9 from IIb-IIIa in real time. Studies were performed with Surface Plasmon Resonance to examine the ability of 52012 to induce the dissociation of ligands from IIb-IIIa. Fab-9 (FIG. 4A) or fibrinogen (FIG. 4B) were immobilized on the sensor chip and then allowed to bind to purified IIb-IIIa. At a specific time, 52012 was introduced by injection into the flow cell.
      <br/>
      FIG. 5. 52012 can dissociate a pre-formed platelet aggregate. Platelet-rich plasma was incubated with fibrinogen coated blue beads which absorb light at 650 nM. Upon addition of ADP as agonist, the platelets aggregate along with the blue beads, causing the optical density to change. This system was used to measure the effect of 52012 on pre-formed platelet aggregates. Aggregates were allowed to form for 10 min. following addition of ADP. 52012 was added at the given concentrations. The dissolution of the aggregate was followed as a function of time and was largely complete within 7 minutes.

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="15">As used in the specification and in the claims, "a" can mean one or more, depending upon the context in which it is used.</p>
    <p num="16">
      As used herein, "ILD" refers to Integrin Ligand Dissociator, and indicates an antagonist compound causing the dissociation of a ligand which is already bound to its target integrin at a ligand binding site.
      <br/>
      In particular, an ILD can bind a second binding site on the integrin and thereby result in dissociation of the ligand from its ligand binding site on the integrin.
    </p>
    <p num="17">
      There is strong evidence that the physiologic binding site for IIb-IIIa within fibrinogen is an independent motif in the carboxyl terminus of fibrinogen gamma chain.
      <br/>
      This site is commonly referred to as the gamma chain motif, and it is not structurally related to RGD.
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      The present invention teaches that IIb-IIIa contains at least two ligand binding pockets and that these two sites are interacting (FIG. 2).
      <br/>
      Importantly, the present invention demonstrates that ligands which bind at an alternative binding site, such as Ligand Binding Site I, can enact the dissociation of ligand that is already pre-bound at Site II.
      <br/>
      Because of their unique ability to induce the dissociation of fibrinogen from IIb-IIIa, these antagonists arc called Integrin-Ligand Dissociators.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, Integrin-Ligand Dissociators are shown to be capable of enacting the dissolution of pre-formed platelet aggregates.
      <br/>
      These findings indicate a novel approach toward anti-platelet therapy that is a strong departure from the current prophylactic strategy of applying antagonist prior to formation of vascular occlusions.
      <br/>
      Rather, the current information shows that Integrin-Ligand Dissociators, can be applied to reverse platelet aggregates that have already formed.
    </p>
    <p num="19">Thus, the present invention provides a method of dissociating a ligand bound to its integrin receptor at its ligand binding site, comprising administering to a ligand:receptor complex a molecule capable of binding the receptor at a second binding site and thereby dissociating the ligand from the receptor.</p>
    <p num="20">
      The present invention can be utilized with any integrin having at least two ligand binding pockets.
      <br/>
      Each integrin has an alpha and beta subunit and the subunits are usually named with a number designation (e.g., beta1), although in some cases the subunit is named with a letter which is derived from the historical name of the receptor.
      <br/>
      For example, the integrin can be a human integrin.
      <br/>
      The following is an exemplary list of the human integrins, along with examples of their known natural ligands:

      Examples of such compounds include, but are not limited to, 1) a peptide comprising the sequence gly-arg-gly-asp-ser-pro (GRGDSP, SEQ ID NO:1), or any other peptide, cyclic or non-cyclic, containing the RGD motif; 2) a peptide derived from the carboxyl-terminus of fibrinogen gamma chain with an amino acid sequence: his-his-leu-gly-gly-ala-lys-gln-ala-gly-asp-val (HHLGGAKQAGDV, SEQ ID NO:2); 3) Fab-9, an RGD-containing Fab fragment of a human antibody that was created by phage display �2�; 4) a number of RGD-containing Fab-fragments that were generated from phage display libraries like the one containing Fab-9 �3�; 5) the protein called "Loop-Grafted tissue plasminogen activator LG-tPA, which was engineered to bind to platelet integrin  ALPHA IIb BETA 3 (IIb-IIIa)�4�; and 6) any number of RGD mimetics that have been reported in the literature or used in human clinical trials including, but not limited to, integrilin, lamifiban, fradriban, lefradrifiban, abciximab, sidrafiban (Genentech), tirofiban (Merck), xemlofiban and orbofiban.
    </p>
    <p num="39">An ILD may also be comprised of peptides, or organic molecules with structures that are not related to RGD.</p>
    <p num="40">
      An ILD may be a monoclonal or polyclonal antibody that was generated by immunization with an integrin, or by immunization with a recombinant fragment of integrin, or by immunization with cells expressing an integrin.
      <br/>
      Such ILDs can include antibodies such as 1) the antibody 7E3 �5, 6�, or abciximab, which is a recombinant derivative of antibody 7E3 that is a mouse-human chimera and is sold under the trade name ReoPro, and 2) the antibody LM 609, which binds to the  ALPHA v BETA 3 integrin �7�.
    </p>
    <p num="41">
      In the case of integrins which do not bind the arg-gly-asp (RGD) sequence, an ILD can also be comprised of a fragment, peptide, peptide mimetic, or organic molecule based upon the structure of one of its ligands.
      <br/>
      One such example can include an ICAM mimetic which could be applied to dissociate integrin  ALPHA L BETA 2 from its ligands.
      <br/>
      Alternatively such an ILD can also include a peptide having the amino acid sequence EILDV (SEQ ID NO:3), or its derivatives and mimetics, which can be applied to dissociate ligands from the  ALPHA 4 BETA 1 integrin.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, an ILD can resemble a peptide with a sequence similar to the  ALPHA M BETA 2 binding site within fibrinogen that could be applied to dissociate ligands from  ALPHA M BETA 2.

    <p num="42">
      Any molecule can be screened for effectiveness in dissociating any selected integrin from a selected ligand using standard techniques.
      <br/>
      For example, one can use Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR), a cell-based screen or a ligand binding assay.
      <br/>
      These methods are described below.
    </p>
    <p num="43">
      Method 1.
      <br/>
      Screening for Integrin Ligand Dissociators Using Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR).
    </p>
    <p num="44">
      In most cases, ligand binding to a protein can be described by two kinetic steps.
      <br/>
      The first is ligand association, which is described by the constant k1 and the second is ligand dissociation, which is described by the constant k-1.
      <br/>
      The affinity, or tightness of binding, between a ligand and its receptor is described by an overall affinity constant called kd.
      <br/>
      By definition kd =k-1 /k1.
      <br/>
      The important distinction between ILDs and other integrin antagonists is that ILDs operate by increasing the rate of ligand dissociation (k-1).
      <br/>
      The integrin antagonists that have been described to date are thought to function by decreasing the rate of ligand association (k1).
      <br/>
      Hence, in screening for ILDs it is important to verify that the ILD increases the rate of ligand dissociation.
      <br/>
      This can be accomplished by any number of kinetic studies which involve purified proteins, or even whole cells.
    </p>
    <p num="45">
      In one embodiment, ILDs can be identified by the ability to increase the rate of dissociation between an integrin and its natural ligand, or a known mimic of its natural ligand, with Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR), for example, using the BIACORE Surface Plasmon Resonance (tm)  instrument.
      <br/>
      SPR is a technique that measures ligand association and dissociation in "real time." To screen for an ILD using plasmon resonance, the following steps would be taken:
    </p>
    <p num="46">1) The integrin is immobilized on the surface of the sensor chip;</p>
    <p num="47">
      2) The integrin is allowed to bind a natural ligand, or a known mimic of the natural ligand, by injecting that ligand into the instrument and allowing it to make contact with the receptor immobilized on the BIACORE Surface Plasmon Resonance (tm)  sensor chip.
      <br/>
      The binding between ligand and integrin results in an increase in the mass of the protein complex bound to the sensor chip, which is detected and reported as a change in plasmon resonance.
      <br/>
      This is reported as an increase in Response Units (or RU);
    </p>
    <p num="48">
      3) The rate of dissociation of the natural ligand is measured by changing the buffer of the mobile phase so that it lacks any free natural ligand.
      <br/>
      This change halts the binding reaction and allows the bound ligand to begin dissociating at its native rate.
      <br/>
      This natural dissociation rate must be recorded; and
    </p>
    <p num="49">
      4) The candidate ILD, or a fluid containing a potential ILD, is introduced into the flow cell containing the integrin:ligand complex.
      <br/>
      Then, the rate of ligand dissociation is measured in the presence of the candidate ILD.
    </p>
    <p num="50">Any compound or substance that increases the rate of dissociation between an integrin and its ligand is considered to be an ILD.</p>
    <p num="51">
      It is important to note that the configuration of the assay could take several different forms.
      <br/>
      For example, rather than immobilizing the integrin on the sensor chip, one could immobilize the ligand.
      <br/>
      In such case, the integrin would be allowed to bind the immobilized ligand prior to measuring dissociation rates.
    </p>
    <p num="52">
      The use of plasmon resonance is just one approach toward screening for ILDs, as any method of quantifying ligand dissociation rate in the presence and absence of an ILD would suffice.
      <br/>
      Such methods can include, but are not limited to, stopped flow kinetics, whole cell-based radioligand binding assays, microcalorimetry, fluroimetry, etc., as would be well known in the art.
    </p>
    <p num="53">Method 2: A cell-based Screen for ILDs.</p>
    <p num="54">
      Integrins mediate the adhesion of cells to matrix proteins and to other cells.
      <br/>
      Thus, one desirable property of an ILD is that it be able to reverse cell adhesion.
      <br/>
      Thus, one method of screening for ILDs is to examine the ability to release cells from an adherent surface.
      <br/>
      In one example, this can be accomplished by coating optically active beads with an integrin ligand.
      <br/>
      The beads, which form a relatively mono-disperse solution, are then mixed with cells which express the target integrin.
      <br/>
      As the integrin binds to its ligand, the cells adhere to the ligand-coated beads and cause them to agglutinate.
      <br/>
      Such agglutination results in a clearance of the solution and a decrease in its optical density.
      <br/>
      Such a decrease is conveniently measured by any spectrophotometer.
      <br/>
      Candidate ILDs are introduced into the solution of agglutinated beads.
      <br/>
      Any compound that dissociates the integrin from its ligand (an ILD) will reverse cell adhesion to the ligand-coated beads and reduce agglutination of the beads.
      <br/>
      Such reduction in agglutination results in an increase in optical density of the solution.
    </p>
    <p num="55">
      This method has the advantage that it can identify ILDs that operate via any number of potential biochemical mechanisms.
      <br/>
      For example, an ILD could function by interrupting an important cellular signaling cascade that is required to maintain a tight binding affinity between an integrin and its ligand.
      <br/>
      Thus, an ILD that antagonizes such a signaling cascade would increase the rate of dissociation between an integrin and its ligand, but by a mechanism that is different from binding directly to integrin.
    </p>
    <p num="56">A general method for using a cell-based assay for screening for ILDs is as follows:</p>
    <p num="57">
      1) Coat optically active small diameter polystyrene beads with an integrin ligand, or a ligand mimic.
      <br/>
      Record the optical density of the suspension of beads at an appropriate wavelength of light.

      It is expected that in many cases a measure of the turbidity of the solution will suffice;

    <p num="58">
      2) In solution, add cells expressing a given integrin to a suspension of ligand-coated beads.
      <br/>
      Allow the cells and beads to bind to one another for a time sufficient to cause agglutination of the beads and a reduction in the optical density of the solution.
      <br/>
      Measure and record the optical density of the solution;
    </p>
    <p num="59">
      3) Add a small volume of a solution containing a candidate ILD, or any combination of candidate ILDs, or any series of molecules that may act in concert as ILDs, to the agglutinated beads.
      <br/>
      Generally, the sample should be gently mixed to facilitate the diffusion of the candidate ILD into the sample.
      <br/>
      Allow a sufficient period of time for the ILD to dissociate integrin from its ligand.; and
    </p>
    <p num="60">
      4) Measure the optical density (or turbidity) of the solution and compare it to the optical densities recorded in steps 1 and 2.
      <br/>
      Any candidate molecule that increases the optical density of the solution over that recorded following step 2 is considered an ILD.
      <br/>
      For example, a "good" ILD might be able to completely reverse the adhesion of cells to the ligand coated beads.
      <br/>
      In this case, the optical density of the solution would return to that recorded following step 1.

    <p num="61">
      It should be emphasized that this is only one approach toward using a cell-based assay for screening for ILD's.

      Method 3.

      A Purified Integrin Ligand Binding Assay Adapted to Screen for ILDs.

    <p num="63">
      Many integrins bind to their ligands such that the two molecules do not dissociate rapidly in the presence of buffer or saline.
      <br/>
      This allows screening for ILDs by simply comparing the amount of integrin ligand complex remaining after an exposure to a candidate ILD for a sufficient period of time.
      <br/>
      This type of screen is readily performed using purified integrins and their ligands.
      <br/>
      In most cases, the strategy will function best when the ligands are labeled with radioiodine or with an alternative labeling approach like biotinylation such that the bound ligand can be detected and quantified.
      <br/>
      A general method for such a screen is adapted from methods previously described methods for examining ligand association with integrins �1�. The adaptation is as follows:

      5) Add either buffer (saline) or buffer solution containing a candidate ILD to the microtiter well containing the complex between integrin and its ligand.

    <p num="85">Evidence that GPIIb-IIIa Contains Two Interacting Ligand Binding Sites.</p>
    <p num="86">
      IIb-IIIa can bind to two types of ligands, one of which is RGD and the other being a motif in the carboxyl-terminus of the fibrinogen gamma chain which lacks structural similarity to RGD.
      <br/>
      The binding of IIb-IIIa to the sequence in the carboxyl-terminus of fibrinogen is necessary for platelet aggregation and is of clear physiologic relevance.
      <br/>
      Prior work using small peptide ligands based on the RGD and gamma chain motifs led to the current notion that the two types of ligands bind to an overlapping binding pocket in a mutually exclusive manner.
    </p>
    <p num="87">
      The present studies challenge the idea that IIb-IIIa contains a single ligand binding pocket.
      <br/>
      These studies indicate that IIb-IIIa contains two separate, but interacting ligand binding pockets.
    </p>
    <p num="88">
      Much of the present data makes use of three ligands.
      <br/>
      Fibrinogen, the physiologic ligand for IIb-IIIa; Fab-9, which is an RGD-containing antibody that we engineered to bind IIb-IIIa using phage display and which is considered to be an RGD mimic; and 52012 (another RGD mimetic).
    </p>
    <p num="89">
      To determine if fibrinogen and Fab-9 actually bind the same site on IIb-IIIa, a series of competition binding studies were carried out.
      <br/>
      The ability of the two ligands to compete for binding to IIB-IIIa was measured.
      <br/>
      Fab-9 blocked the binding of fibrinogen to IIB-IIIa (FIG. 1A).
      <br/>
      However, fibrinogen failed to block the binding of Fab-9 to the integrin (FIG. 1B).
      <br/>
      These data prove that the two proteins bind to different sites on the integrin.
      <br/>
      These sites are designated as Site I, which binds to Fab-9 and Site II, which interacts with fibrinogen (FIG. 2).
    </p>
    <p num="90">
      Based on this finding, it was hypothesized that IIB-IIIa contains two ligand binding sites and that one site regulates the affinity of ligand for the other site.
      <br/>
      To test this "interacting site" hypothesis, the effects of Fab-9 and 52012 on the dissociation of pre-bound fibrinogen were examined.
      <br/>
      By definition, ligands that bind a common site on a receptor have no ability to influence the dissociation rate of bound ligand because they cannot bind to the occupied site.
      <br/>
      In contrast, ligands which bind to separate, or allosteric, sites can regulate the affinity for ligands at the second site.
      <br/>
      Both RGD-type ligands, Fab-9 and 52012, promoted the dissociation of between 50 and 60% of the bound fibrinogen within a three hour time period (FIG. 3A).
      <br/>
      As is well known, fibrinogen does not dissociate from purified IIB-IIIa in the presence of buffer.
      <br/>
      Interestingly, 52012 failed to increase the dissociation of Fab-9 from purified IIB-IIIa (FIG. 3B).
      <br/>
      The simplest interpretation of these observations is that both RGD-mimic ligands, Fab-9 and 52012, bind to a common site on IIB-IIIa (Site I) and that this site regulates the rate of dissociation of fibrinogen from Site II.
    </p>
    <p num="91">
      To verify the effect of RGD-type ligands on the dissociation of fibrinogen from IIB-IIIa, dissociation rates were measured in real time using Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR).
      <br/>
      As shown in FIG. 4B, 52012 was able to induce the dissociation of fibrinogen from IIB-IIIa, increasing the off-rate by twenty-fold (from 6 * 10-5 s-1 to 1 * 10-2 s-1) However 52012 did not affect the dissociation of Fab-9 from IIB-IIIa (FIG. 4A), a finding consistent with the result shown in FIG. 3B and also consistent with the idea that 52012 and Fab-9 bind to the same site.
      <br/>
      It is also of note that the concentration of 52012 required to induce dissociation of fibrinogen was virtually identical to that required to prevent association of fibrinogen.
      <br/>
      This observation indicates that fibrinogen binding to Site II has little effect on the binding affinity of 52012 at Site I. Hence, binding of ligands like 52012 and Fab-9 to Site I can regulate both aspects of fibrinogen binding affinity (k1 and k-1), but that fibrinogen does not influence the affinity for ligands at Site I.

      One implication of the two site interacting model is that the binding of ligand (or drug) to Site I on IIB-IIIa may dissociate a platelet thrombus.
      <br/>
      Therefore, studies were conducted in which a platelet aggregate was formed in the presence of optically active fibrinogen-coated blue beads.
      <br/>
      The blue beads act as a tracer as their clearance from the solution during platelet aggregation reports the extent of aggregation.
      <br/>
      When RGD mimics 52012 or Fab-9 were added to platelets prior to platelet stimulation, aggregation was prevented.
      <br/>
      More significantly, both RGD-like ligands could induce the dissociation of a pre-formed platelet thrombus (FIG. 5), a result that is consistent with their ability to induce the dissociation of fibrinogen from IIB-IIIa (FIGS. 1 and 3).
    </p>
    <p num="93">
      These data reveal a previously unappreciated kinetic interplay between two separate ligand binding sites on IIB-IIIa.
      <br/>
      The study indicates that two ligand binding sites are distinct and non-overlapping.
      <br/>
      Binding Site I interacts with Fab-9 and other RGD mimics.
      <br/>
      Binding Site II binds to fibrinogen.
      <br/>
      The two ligand binding sites are linked in a unique manner.
      <br/>
      The binding of fibrinogen at Site II has no effect on the binding affinity for RGD-type ligands at Site I. In contrast, the binding of RGD-type ligands to Site I regulates both the association rate and, more importantly, the dissociation rate of fibrinogen at Site II.
      <br/>
      A model of the two interacting ligand binding pockets on IIB-IIIa is shown in FIG. 2.

    <p num="94">
      These results have several implications.
      <br/>
      First, the findings support a new therapeutic strategy for interfering with the function of IIB-IIIa.
      <br/>
      Prior understanding of the binding sites on IIB-IIIa indicated that the receptor interacted with two classes of ligands in a "mutually exclusive" manner.
      <br/>
      With this mechanism of binding, antagonists of the integrin could only operate by preventing the association of fibrinogen with the integrin.
      <br/>
      Hence, drugs would only be effective when applied prior to the formation of a thrombus.
      <br/>
      The results presented here demonstrate that the binding of RGD-type ligands/antagonists to IIB-IIIa can assist in dissociating existing thrombi.
      <br/>
      Clearly the dissolution of a thrombus is complex and involves many additional factors, but the current findings support the interaction of small molecules with these sites as means of dissociating existing thrombi.
