    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="1">

      <br/>
      Field of the Invention
    </p>
    <p num="2">The present invention relates to a plurality of information devices which are linked by a communication link in an encryption utilization communication system for protecting digital data transmitted on the communication link between the plurality of information devices.</p>
    <p num="3">2. Description of the Prior Art</p>
    <p num="4">
      It has become increasingly common that video productions such as movies are digitized and compressed.
      <br/>
      Such digitized and compressed video productions hardly suffer from picture degradation, so that users can always enjoy video productions with high picture quality.
      <br/>
      While analog video productions which have been repeatedly dubbed have profound loss in picture quality, digitized video productions which have been repeatedly dubbed have no picture degradation.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      In other words, digitized video productions are far more susceptible to copyright infringement acts, such as unauthorized production of dead copies and unauthorized alteration, than analog video productions.
      <br/>
      When such dead copies or altered video productions are distributed, producers of the original digitized video productions will suffer tremendous damage.
      <br/>
      Because of this danger, the producers are cautious of having their video productions digitized.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, the issue concerning the digitization of video productions is whether such productions can be protected against copyright infringements.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      It should be noted that dead copies of a video production can be produced by connecting a video reproduction device for reproducing a recording medium on which the video production is recorded and an information recording device for recording the reproduced video production onto a recording medium.
      <br/>
      On the other hand, unauthorized alteration of a video production can be performed by connecting a video reproduction device for reproducing a recording medium on which the video production is recorded and a video editing device for temporarily storing the reproduced video production onto a hard disc for later editing.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      In order to prevent such infringements, video reproduction devices which reproduce video productions must prevent the video productions from being distributed to unauthorized devices, such as information recording devices or digital information copying devices.
      <br/>
      For this purpose, when a video reproduction device is linked to such a device via a communication link, it is necessary for the video reproduction device to verify the authenticity of the device.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      The most representative techniques used for verifying the authenticity of the device in communication are authentication methods.
      <br/>
      In these methods, a transmitter device verifies the authenticity of a receiver device, and only proceeds to transmit data to receiver devices that have been successfully verified, thereby preventing unauthorized devices from receiving the data.
      <br/>
      It should be noted here that since the receiver device needs to lay claim to its authenticity, it is generally referred to as the "claimant", while the transmitter device needs to verify the authenticity of the claimant, and so is referred to as the "verifier".
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      Predetermined standards have been created for use by devices related to the recording and reproduction of optical discs, in order to protect copyrights.
      <br/>
      Here, the issue is whether a device conforms to the predetermined standard.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, the "verification of the authenticity" described above is performed by "judging whether a device conforms to the predetermined standard".

      An example of a conventional authentication technique is a one-way authentication method using the encryption techniques taught by the ISO/IEC (International Organization for Standardization/International Electrotechnical Commission) 9798-2 Standard.
      <br/>
      This authentication method is based on the claimant having secret data called a claimant key which it uses to prove its authenticity to the verifier without transmitting the claimant key itself.
      <br/>
      In this setup, the verifier selects data and transmits this to the claimant.
      <br/>
      This process is called "challenge", in which the transmitted data (called "challenge data") is set at 64 bits in accordance with the ISO/IEC 9798-2 Standard.
    </p>
    <p num="11">
      The claimant encrypts the challenge data using an encryption algorithm and the claimant key.
      <br/>
      Here, the encryption is such that even if an unauthorized third party obtains both the challenge data and the encryption result, it will still be impossible to derive the claimant key from these values.
      <br/>
      The claimant transmits the encrypted data to the verifier as "response data".
    </p>
    <p num="12">
      The verifier, which receives the response data, is provided with a decryption algorithm corresponding to the encryption algorithm and a verifier key, which it uses to decrypt the response data.
      <br/>
      The verifier then compares the decryption result with the challenge data.
      <br/>
      When these match, the verifier judges that the claimant is in possession of the valid claimant key, and so verifies the authenticity of the claimant.
      <br/>
      This one-way authentication is completed at the point when one device proves its authenticity to the other device, though one-way authentication processing may be repeated by switching the verifier and the claimant so that each device can verify the authenticity of the other device (this method is called "two-way authentication").
    </p>
    <p num="13">
      There are two encryption systems used for authentication methods: a secret key encryption system and a public key encryption system.
      <br/>
      In these encryption systems, a key used for generating response data is referred to as the "claimant key", while a key used for verifying the authenticity of the response data is referred to as the "verifier key".
    </p>
    <p num="14">
      In the secret key encryption system a same key can be used as the claimant key and the verifier key.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, both the claimant key and the verifier key must be kept secret when using secret key encryption.
    </p>
    <p num="15">
      In the public key encryption system, different keys are used as the claimant key and the verifier key.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, while the claimant key should be kept secret, the verifier key does not have to be kept secret (the key which should be kept secret is referred to as the "secret key", and the key which does not have to be kept secret is referred to as the "public key").
    </p>
    <p num="16">
      When performing the secret key encryption using computer software, the processing time can be reduced.
      <br/>
      Also, when performing the secret key encryption using hardware, the apparatus can be realized compactly.
      <br/>
      On the other hand, there is a drawback with the secret key encryption system in that not only the claimant key but the verifier key should be kept secret.
      <br/>
      When, for example, the claimant key is changed, it becomes necessary to change the verifier key, too.
      <br/>
      However, a verifier key corresponding to the new claimant key of the claimant cannot be transmitted to the verifier via the communication link, since data on the communication link is in principle not secure against unauthorized copying and thus its secrecy is not fully protected.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, there is a difficulty in changing the claimant key of the claimant.
      <br/>
      Since all devices in the secret key encryption system have the same secret information (regardless of whether it is nominally a claimant key or a verifier key), once this secret information leaks out, the secrecy of the entire system breaks down.
    </p>
    <p num="17">
      As for the public key encryption system, it is widely known that extensive numerical calculations are required to perform public key encryption.
      <br/>
      To perform the public key encryption using standard computer software requires great amounts of processing time.
      <br/>
      Also, in order to perform the public key encryption using specialized hardware, the hardware needs to be of a large-scale.
      <br/>
      While the public key encryption system has these drawbacks, the system has an advantage in that the verifier key used for verifying the authenticity of the response data does not have to be kept secret but can be made public in an authentication method in challenge-response format.
      <br/>
      Security of the authentication method using the public key encryption can be maintained even when the verifier key is known.
      <br/>
      When, for example, the claimant key is changed, a verifier key corresponding to the new claimant key can be transmitted from the claimant to the verifier via the communication link.
      <br/>
      Thus, the authentication method in challenge-response format using the public key encryption system is more flexible than the authentication method in challenge-response format using the secret key encryption system, as it can change the claimant key without affecting the security of the entire system (due to the reasons described above, authentication methods which use both secret and public keys can be regarded as more secure than authentication methods which use only secret keys).
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      There is a range of choices concerning authentication methods using the public key encryption system.
      <br/>
      For example, there is an inverse relation in the authentication methods between security and processing speed (when using computer software) or hardware scale (when using specialized hardware).
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      Thus, there are an increasing number of verifier methods and claimant methods to choose from, including public key encryption utilization methods and secret key encryption utilization methods.
      <br/>
      As a result, when developing new products related to the recording and reproduction of video productions, it is possible to implement optimum verifier and claimant methods for the hardware scale and processing speed of the new products.
    </p>
    <p num="20">
      While it is desirable for producers who intend to develop new products to have a wide variety of verifier and claimant methods to choose from, there is also a danger of authentication failure when certain types of verifiers are connected with certain types of claimants.
      <br/>
      For instance, when authentication is performed between a verifier which has a verifier method using the public key encryption and a claimant which has a claimant method using the secret key encryption, two devices cannot perform the authentication properly.
      <br/>
      Also, when the verifier and the claimant both perform authentication using the secret key encryption but with different versions of the software or hardware, each device cannot verify the authenticity of the other device.
    </p>
    <p num="21">
      In order to avoid such inconsistencies, producers need to develop verifiers and claimants which are capable of executing as large a number of versions of authentication protocols in challenge-response format as possible.
      <br/>
      For example, a verifier can be provided with hardware for a first verifier method using the public key encryption system and hardware for a second verifier method using the secret key encryption system.
      <br/>
      When a claimant has only a second claimant method using the secret key encryption system, both devices can perform authentication successfully.
    </p>
    <p num="22">
      However, when both the verifier and the claimant are capable of executing a plurality of verifier and claimant methods respectively, a less secure verifier/claimant method may be automatically selected by the verifier and the claimant, so that a more secure verifier/claimant method which is possessed by both devices may not be utilized.
      <br/>
      For instance, when the claimant is provided with a first claimant method using the public key encryption and the second claimant method using the secret key encryption, the verifier and the claimant may choose the less secure second verifier/claimant method using the secret key encryption to perform authentication.
      <br/>
      As a result, the more secure first verifier/claimant method using the public key encryption may not be utilized.
    </p>
    <p num="23">
      The above explanation has focused on authentication techniques, although the problems stated above are not limited to such.
      <br/>
      When there are a plurality of choices of encryption utilization protocols for protecting the copyrights and secrecy of video productions which are to be transmitted between a plurality of devices, the transmitter device and the receiver device may use different versions of an encryption utilization protocol.
      <br/>
      As a result, the receiver device may fail to decrypt the video productions which have been encrypted by the transmitter device.
      <br/>
      Also, the transmitter device may use an encryption utilization protocol which the receiver device does not possess to encrypt the video productions and transmits them to the receiver device, which as a result cannot decrypt the encrypted video productions.
    </p>
    <p num="24">Thus, the danger of "non-communicative state", caused by having a plurality of choices of encryption utilization protocols, is not limited to the authentication techniques, but concerns every communication system which has a plurality of choices of encryption utilization protocols.</p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="25">It is an object of the present invention to provide a communication system for effectively selecting and using an encryption utilization protocol from a plurality of choices of encryption utilization protocols.</p>
    <p num="26">The above object can be fulfilled by a communication system where a plurality of information devices that are capable of executing a plurality of encryption utilization protocols communicate with each other, wherein each information device includes: a notification unit for transmitting type information showing a device type of a present information device, that represents at least one encryption utilization protocol that can be executed by the present information device out of the plurality of encryption utilization protocols, to another information device in the communication system with which communication is to be performed; a determining unit for determining which encryption utilization protocol is to be used in the communication, from a combination of the type information of the present information device and type information received from the other information device with which the communication is to be performed; and a communication unit, equipped with at least one protocol correspondence communication unit that each performs communication using a corresponding encryption utilization protocol out of the encryption utilization protocols that are represented by the device type shown by the type information of the present information device, for having one of the protocol correspondence communication units perform the communication with the other information device using the encryption utilization protocol determined by the determining unit.</p>
    <p num="27">
      With the stated construction, when performing communication, each information device selects the encryption utilization protocol to be used in accordance with the combination of its own type information and the type information of the other information device.
      <br/>
      As a result, even when information devices have different capabilities of executing encryption utilization protocols because of differences in processing capability and hardware scale, each information device can still perform communication successfully.
    </p>
    <p num="28">
      For instance, when there is a huge gap in the capabilities of executing encryption utilization protocols between a first information device which can execute a plurality of encryption utilization protocols and a second information device which can execute only one encryption utilization protocol, the determining unit of the first information device determines the encryption utilization protocol which can be executed by the second information device out of the plurality of encryption utilization protocols.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, regardless of the difference in the capabilities of executing encryption utilization protocols between two information devices, communication can be successfully performed.
      <br/>
      As a result, the "non-communicative state" caused by the difference in the capabilities of executing encryption utilization protocols can be prevented.
    </p>
    <p num="29">Here, the communication system may include n different device types, n being at least two, wherein the determining unit of each information device includes: a table storage unit for storing at least one table where each combination of two device types selected from the n different device types is associated with protocol correspondence information that shows which of the plurality of encryption utilization protocols should be used for the combination; a type information storage unit for storing the type information showing the device type of the present information device out of the n different device types; and a determination unit for determining, on being informed of the type information of the other information device with which the communication is to be performed, an encryption utilization protocol shown by protocol correspondence information that is associated in the table stored in the table storage unit to the combination of the type information of the other information device and the type information of the present information device as the encryption utilization protocol which is to be used in the communication, and wherein the communication unit has a protocol correspondence communication unit that corresponds to the encryption utilization protocol determined by the determination unit perform the communication using the determined encryption utilization protocol.</p>
    <p num="30">
      With the stated construction, when a first information device and a second information device have capabilities of executing a plurality of encryption utilization protocols, an optimum encryption utilization protocol for the combination of type information of the first and second information devices, out of the plurality of encryption utilization protocols, is shown in a table.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, the first and second information devices can use the optimum encryption utilization protocol shown in the table to perform communication.
      <br/>
      As a result, an optimum encryption utilization protocol for a combination of any two information devices can be used with reference to the table.
    </p>
    <p num="31">Here, the plurality of encryption utilization protocols may be a plurality of authentication protocols, wherein each protocol correspondence communication unit in one of the plurality of information devices in the communication system includes: an authentication unit for having another information device in the communication system with which communication is to be performed make an attempt to prove that the other information device is authentic using an authentication protocol determined by the determination unit, and for judging from the attempt whether the other information device is authentic; and a transmission unit for transmitting data that is subject to protection to the other information device only when the authentication unit has judged that the other information device is authentic.</p>
    <p num="32">
      With the stated construction, when a first information device is a transmitter of data, such as digitized video productions, which should be protected against unauthorized acts by unauthorized devices, and when the first information device needs to verify the authenticity of a second information device, the first information device proceeds to transmit the data only after verifying the authenticity of the second information device.
      <br/>
      As a result, unauthorized acts such as copyright infringements can be prevented.
    </p>
    <p num="33">Here, the table storage unit in each information device may store a plurality of different tables in which each combination of two device types selected from the n different device types is associated with protocol correspondence information that shows which of the plurality of authentication protocols should be used for the combination, wherein a first table out of the plurality of different tables stores protocol correspondence information that shows a most secure authentication protocol that should be used for each combination of two device types selected from the n different device types, wherein a second table out of the plurality of different tables stores protocol correspondence information that shows an authentication protocol with a highest processing speed that should be used for each combination of two device types selected from the n different device types, wherein the determining unit in the information device further includes a selection unit for selecting one out of the plurality of different tables stored in the table storage unit with consideration to which of high security and fast processing is desired for the communication to be performed and for informing the other information device of the selected table, and wherein the determination unit in each information device determines the authentication protocol to be used in the communication from the table selected by the selection unit out of the plurality of different tables stored in the table storage unit.</p>
    <p num="34">
      With the stated construction, when a first information device and a second information device are capable of executing a plurality of authentication protocols, a most secure authentication protocol and an authentication protocol with a highest processing speed, out of the plurality of authentication protocols, are shown in the tables corresponding to the combination of the type information of the first and second information devices.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, the first and second information devices can use either the most secure authentication protocol or the authentication protocol with the highest processing speed to perform communication.
      <br/>
      As a result, an optimum authentication protocol for a combination of any two information devices can be used with reference to the tables.
    </p>
    <p num="35">Here, the plurality of authentication protocols may include a plurality of authentication protocols in challenge-response format, wherein the plurality of authentication protocols in challenge-response format include authentication protocols in challenge-response format that use public key encryption and authentication protocols in challenge-response format that use secret key encryption, wherein the protocol correspondence information in the first table shows the authentication protocols in challenge-response format that use the public key encryption as most secure authentication protocols in challenge-response format, wherein the protocol correspondence information in the second table shows the authentication protocols in challenge-response format that use the secret key encryption as authentication protocols in challenge-response format with the highest processing speed, and wherein the communication unit in each information device is equipped with protocol correspondence communication units which perform communication based on the authentication protocols in challenge-response format that use the public key encryption and protocol correspondence communication units which perform communication based on the authentication protocols in challenge-response format that use the secret key encryption.</p>
    <p num="36">
      With the stated construction, for all information devices which are equipped with large-scale hardware or software for executing the authentication protocols in challenge-response format using the public key encryption, the capability of executing the authentication protocols in challenge-response format that use the public key encryption is shown in the tables.
      <br/>
      As a result, when both a first information device and a second information device can execute the authentication protocols in challenge-response format that use the public key encryption, utilization of the hardware or software for executing the authentication protocols in challenge-response format that use the public key encryption can be maximized.

    <heading>DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading>
    <p num="38">
      The following is an explanation of an authentication system of the embodiment of the present invention.
      <br/>
      This authentication system includes two information devices: a verifier and a claimant.
      <br/>
      In this authentication system, a reception device for receiving video productions transmitted via digital satellite broadcasting is used as an example of the verifier.
      <br/>
      A video disc recorder for recording the video productions onto a video recording DVD-RAM (Digital Versatile Disc--Random Access Memory) optical disc is used as an example of the claimant.
      <br/>
      An AV bus, that conforms to predetermined bus standards and is capable of high-speed transmission of stream data specified in MPEG (Moving Picture Expert Group) Standard, is used as an example of a communication link which links the verifier and the claimant.
      <br/>
      A personal computer which has video editing functions is used as an example of an unauthorized device.
    </p>
    <p num="39">FIG. 1 shows the connection between the verifier and the claimant in the authentication system.</p>
    <p num="40">
      It is authorized to link a verifier 101 and a claimant 104 via an AV bus 107, while to link the verifier 101 and a personal computer 108 is an act which may lead to a copyright infringement (hereinafter, "unauthorized act").
      <br/>
      Since video editing software has been installed in the personal computer 108, once a video production transmitted via the digital satellite broadcasting is distributed to the personal computer 108, the video editing software of the personal computer 108 may be used to perform unauthorized alteration of the video production.
    </p>
    <p num="41">FIG. 2 shows how a plurality of verifiers can be freely connected to a plurality of claimants.</p>
    <p num="42">
      It is authorized to link any of verifiers 101-103 and any of claimants 104-106 via the AV bus 107, while it is unauthorized to link any of the verifiers 101-103 and the personal computer 108.
      <br/>
      In order to prevent the video production from being distributed to the personal computer 108, the verifiers 101-103 verifies the authenticity of the device to which they are connected via the AV bus 107.
    </p>
    <p num="43">
      The verifier 101 is a host reception device developed by a producer A, and is provided with the public key encryption utilization algorithms Public_ver. 2.6 and Public_ver. 1.3, and the secret key encryption utilization algorithms Secret_ver. 2.0, Secret_ver. 1.3, and Secret_ver. 1 0 (slashed zero)  Thus, the verifier 101 is capable of verifying the authenticity of various types of video recording devices.
      <br/>
      Among these algorithms, the public key encryption utilization algorithm Public_ver. 2.6 is the most secure, though it requires elaborate hardware.
    </p>
    <p num="44">The verifier 102 is a standard reception device developed by the producer A, and is provided with the public key encryption utilization algorithm Public_ver. 1.3 and the secret key encryption utilization algorithms Secret_ver. 2.0, Secret_ver. 1.3, and Secret_ver. 1.0, though it does not possess the most secure public key encryption utilization algorithm Public_ver. 2.6.</p>
    <p num="45">
      The verifier 103 is a low-cost reception device developed by the producer A. To simplify its hardware, it only has reduced compatibility with claimants.
      <br/>
      The verifier 103 is provided with the secret key encryption utilization algorithms Secret_ver. 2.0 and Secret_ver. 1.3, and it does not have the public key encryption utilization algorithms which are more secure.
    </p>
    <p num="46">The claimant 104 is a host video recording device developed by the producer A, and is provided with the public key encryption utilization algorithms Public_ver. 2.6 and Public_ver. 1.3, and the secret key encryption utilization algorithms Secret_ver. 2.0 and Secret_ver. 1.3. Thus, the claimant 104 is capable of proving its authenticity to various types of reception devices.</p>
    <p num="47">The claimant 105 is a standard video recording device developed by the producer A, and is provided with the public key encryption utilization algorithm Public_ver. 1.3 and the secret key encryption utilization algorithm Secret_ver. 2.0, though it does not possess the most secure public key encryption utilization algorithm Public_ver. 2.6. Thus, the claimant 105 does not have a wide range of choices of authentication protocols.</p>
    <p num="48">The claimant 106 is a portable video recording device developed by the producer A. To simplify its hardware, it is only provided with the secret key encryption utilization algorithm Secret_ver. 1.3, so that the claimant 106 has very poor compatibility with verifiers.</p>
    <p num="49">
      As described above, there are differences in the capability of executing authentication protocols in challenge-response format among the verifiers 101-103 and the claimants 104-106 shown in FIG. 2.

      In Secret_ver. 1.0 and 1.3, the verifier generates a 64-bit random number R and encrypts this using a secret verifier key K1, before transmitting the encryption result E(K1, R) to the claimant as challenge data CHA.
      <br/>
      On receiving the challenge data CHA, the claimant decrypts it using a secret claimant key K1, and transmits the decryption result D(K1, CHA) to the verifier as response data RES.
      <br/>
      On receiving the response data RES, the verifier compares it with the random number R. When these match, the verifier judges that the claimant is in possession of the valid claimant key and so verifies the authenticity of the claimant.
