      Field of the Invention
    </p>
    <p num="2">The present invention relates to coating compositions containing polyisocyanates and aspartate-terminated urea/urethane prepolymers, which may be cured to provide coatings having improved flexibility.</p>
    <p num="3">2. Description of the Prior Art</p>
    <p num="4">
      The reaction of polyaspartates with polyisocyanates to form polyurea coatings is disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,126,170 and 5,236,741.
      <br/>
      The polyisocyanates are blended with polyaspartates and then reacted after the mixture has been applied to a suitable substrate to form a urea group-containing coating.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      One of the deficiencies of these coatings is that they do not possess good flexibility, primarily because both of the reaction components are low molecular weight compounds.
      <br/>
      The reaction of these components results in a high concentration of urea groups, so-called "hard blocks," which are known to result in rigid coatings.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      One possibility for increasing the flexibility of the coatings is to blend the polyaspartates with the known high molecular weight polyols.
      <br/>
      However, when these systems are cured the coatings obtained have a waxy feel, which makes them unsuitable for commercial applications.
      <br/>
      It is believed that this is caused by the fact that aspartate groups react with isocyanate groups much faster than hydroxy groups.
      <br/>
      Therefore, during the curing process the polyisocyanates react with the aspartates, which hardens the coatings to such an extent that the isocyanate groups cannot react with the hydroxy groups of the polyol component.
      <br/>
      The polyols remain in the cured coating as a plasticizer resulting in a waxy feel.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      One method of overcoming this difficulty is to prereact the polyol with the polyisocyanate to form an NCO prepolymer.
      <br/>
      The prepolymer can then be reacted with the polyaspartate to form a fully cured coating composition.
      <br/>
      One disadvantage of this process is that unreacted monomeric polyisocyanate is also present in the NCO prepolymer.
      <br/>
      To remove this free monomer, which is necessary for environmental reasons, requires an expensive stripping process.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      Copending application, overcomes the need for removing unreacted monomer by reacting the NCO prepolymers and any free monomer with polyaspartates to convert the NCO prepolymers to an aspartate-terminated urea prepolymers.
      <br/>
      These prepolymers can subsequently be reacted with a polyisocyanates to form coatings.
    </p>
    <p num="9">Even though the coatings obtained in the copending application have increased flexibility, it is an object of the present invention to further improve the flexibility of these coating, while maintaining the high crosslink density of the coatings.</p>
    <p num="10">
      This object can be achieved with the coating compositions according to the present invention that are described hereinafter.
      <br/>
      The coating compositions contain aspartate-terminated urea/urethane prepolymers, excess polyaspartates and polyisocyanates having a specific range of NCO functionalities.
      <br/>
      By using these specific coating compositions it is possible to obtain an additional increase in flexibility without sacrificing the other valuable properties of polyurethane coatings.
      <br/>
      The use of higher functionality polyisocyanates leads to an increase in the crosslink density of the coatings, which results, e.g., in excellent chemical and solvent resistance.

      <br/>
      Polylactones having hydroxyl groups, particularly poly- EPSILON -caprolactone, are also suitable for producing the prepolymers.
    </p>
    <p num="23">
      Also suitable for preparing the prepolymers are polyether polyols, which may be obtained in known manner by the alkoxylation of suitable starter molecules.
      <br/>
      Examples of suitable starter molecules include polyols, water, organic polyamines having at least two N--H bonds and mixtures thereof.
      <br/>
      Suitable alkylene oxides for the alkoxylation reaction are preferably ethylene oxide, propylene oxide and/or tetrahydrofuran, which may be used in sequence or in admixture.
      <br/>
      Tetrahydrofuran is most preferred.
    </p>
    <p num="24">Other suitable polyols include polycarbonates having hydroxyl groups, which may be produced by the reaction of diols with phosgene or diaryl carbonates such as diphenyl carbonate.</p>
    <p num="25">Further details concerning the low molecular weight compounds and the starting materials and methods for preparing the high molecular weight polyhydroxy compounds are disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,701,480, herein incorporated by reference.</p>
    <p num="26">
      The NCO prepolymers preferably have an isocyanate content of 0.3 to 35% by weight, more preferably 0.6 to 25% by weight and most preferably 1.2 to 20% by weight.
      <br/>
      The NCO prepolymers are produced by reacting the polyisocyanates, preferably monomeric diisocyanates, with the polyol component at a temperature of 40 to 120 (degree)  C., preferably 50 to 100 (degree)  C., at an NCO/OH equivalent ratio of 1.3:1 to 20:1, preferably 1.4:1 to 10:1.
      <br/>
      If chain extension via urethane groups is desired during the preparation of the isocyanate prepolymers, an NCO/OH equivalent ratio of 1.3:1 to 2:1 is selected.
      <br/>
      If chain extension is not desired, an excess of diisocyanate is preferably used, corresponding to an NCO/OH equivalent ratio of 4:1 to 20:1, preferably 5:1 to 10:1.
      <br/>
      The excess diisocyanate may optionally be removed by thin layer distillation when the reaction is completed.
      <br/>
      In accordance with the present invention NCO prepolymers also include NCO semi-prepolymers which contain unreacted starting polyisocyanates in addition to the urethane group-containing prepolymers.
    </p>
    <p num="27">To prepare the aspartate-terminated prepolymers, the previously described NCO prepolymers are reacted with compounds corresponding to formula I:  (Chemical Structure image '2' not included in text)</p>
    <p num="28">wherein</p>
    <p num="29">
      X represents the residue obtained by removing the amino groups from a linear or branched aliphatic diamine,
      <br/>
      R1 and R2 are identical or different and represent organic groups which are inert to isocyanate groups at a temperature of 100 (degree)  C. or less, preferably alkyl groups having 1 to 9 carbon atoms, more preferably methyl, ethyl or butyl groups
      <br/>
      R3 and R4 may be identical or different and represent hydrogen or organic groups which are inert towards isocyanate groups at a temperature of 100 (degree)  C. or less, preferably hydrogen and
      <br/>
      n represents an integer with a value of at least 2, preferably 2 to 4 and more preferably 2.
    </p>
    <p num="30">
      With regard to preceding definitions R1 and R2 may be different when the polyaspartates are prepared from mixed maleates, such as methylethyl maleate.
      <br/>
      In addition, one R1 may be different from another R1.
      <br/>
      For example, when a mixture of maleates, e.g. dimethyl and diethyl maleate, is used to prepare the polyaspartate, one pair of R1 and R2 groups will be methyl and the other will be ethyl.
    </p>
    <p num="31">
      The polyaspartates may be prepared in known manner as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,126,170, herein incorporated by reference by reacting the corresponding primary polyamines corresponding to the formula

    </p>
    <p num="33">
      Suitable diamines, which may optionally contain ether groups, include ethylene diamine, 1,2-diamino-propane, 1,4-diaminobutane, 1,3-diaminopentane, 1,6-diaminohexane, 2-methyl-1,5-pentane diamine, 2,5-diamino-2,5-dimethylhexane, 2,2,4- and /or 2,4,4-trimethyl-1,6-diaminohexane, 1,11-diaminoundecane, 1,12-diaminododecane and ether containing diamines, such as Jeffamine D-230 (available from Huntsman).
      <br/>
      Preferred are 1,4-diaminobutane, 1,6-diaminohexane and 2-methyl-1,5-pentane diamine.
    </p>
    <p num="34">Examples of optionally substituted maleic or fumaric acid esters suitable for use in the preparation of the compounds corresponding to formula I include dimethyl, diethyl and di-n-butyl esters of maleic acid and fumaric acid, the previously discussed mixed maleates and fumarates, and the corresponding maleic or fumaric acid esters substituted by methyl in the 2- and/or 3-position.</p>
    <p num="35">
      The aspartate-terminated urea/urethane prepolymers according to the invention are prepared by reacting the NCO prepolymers with a sufficient amount of the polyaspartates to provide a reaction product containing 10 to 22%, preferably 11 to 19% and more preferably 12 to 16% by weight of aspartate-terminated prepolymers a) and 78 to 90%, preferably 81 to 89% and more preferably 84 to 88% by weight of excess polyaspartates b), wherein these percentages are based on the weight of components a) and b).
      <br/>
      Alternatively, the reaction could be conducted with either no excess or a smaller excess of polyaspartate and the remaining amount could be added after the reaction.
      <br/>
      However, this is not preferred.
    </p>
    <p num="36">
      The reaction is preferably carried out by incrementally adding the polyisocyanate to the polyaspartate.
      <br/>
      After the reaction of the excess polyaspartates remain in the aspartate-terminated prepolymers and function as a reactive diluent.
      <br/>
      When excess polyaspartate is present during the reaction, it reduces the formation of higher molecular weight oligomers.
    </p>
    <p num="37">
      At low reaction temperatures of 10 to 100 (degree)  C., preferably 20 to 80 (degree)  C. and more preferably 20 to 50 (degree)  C., the aspartate groups react with isocyanate groups to form urea groups.
      <br/>
      The urea groups may be converted to hydantoin groups in known manner either by heating the compounds at elevated temperatures, optionally in the presence of an acidic or basic catalyst, or after storage under ambient conditions.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the term "urea groups" is also intended to include other compounds containing the group, N--CO--N, such as hydantoin groups.
    </p>
    <p num="38">
      The conversion of urea groups to hydantoin groups is accelerated at temperatures of 60 to 240 (degree)  C., preferably 80 to 160 (degree)  C. and more preferably 100 to 140 (degree)  C. The hydantoin groups are formed with the elimination of a monoalcohol.
      <br/>
      Instead of forming the urea groups and hydantoin groups in two steps, the reaction may be carried out entirely at elevated temperatures in order to form the urea groups and hydantoin groups in one step.
    </p>
    <p num="39">
      In accordance with the present invention it is preferred to convert urea groups to hydantoin groups at elevated temperatures before the aspartate-terminated prepolymer is mixed with a polyisocyanate.
      <br/>
      Under these conditions the monoalcohol may be removed from the prepolymer, which prevents it from reacting with polyisocyanates that are subsequently added.
    </p>
    <p num="40">
      To prepare the two-component coating compositions according to the invention the aspartate-terminated urea/urethane prepolymers are used in combination with polyisocyanate adducts, which have an average isocyanate functionality of 2.8 to 3.1, preferably 2.85 to 3.05 and more preferably 2.9 to 3 0 (slashed zero)  Suitable polyisocyanate adducts are those containing isocyanurate, uretdione, biuret, urethane, allophanate, iminooxadiazine dione, carbodiimide and/or oxadiazinetrione groups.

      Approximately forty grams of the aspartate component was weighed into a plastic cup.
      <br/>
      The polyisocyanate component was added to the aspartate component in amount sufficient to provide an equivalent ratio of isocyanate groups to aspartate groups of 1.05:1. The following table sets forth the weight ratio between diaspartate 1 and aspartate prepolymer 1.
      <br/>
      The polyisocyanate component is either polyisocyanate 1, polyisocyanate 2 or a blend of these polyisocyanates.

      The table sets forth the weight percent of polyisocyanate 1 in the mixture; the remainder is polyisocyanate 2.

    <p num="72">
      The materials were vigorously stirred for 15 seconds and then poured onto a glass plate.
      <br/>
      A film was made on the glass plate by drawing out a thin film with a 15 mil draw down bar.
      <br/>
      The films were allowed to cure for 21 days at 25 (degree)  C. and 50% R.H.
    </p>
    <p num="73">
      When the curing period was complete, the glass panels were immersed in tap water for about two hours.
      <br/>
      The film was lifted from the glass surface, patted dry with a paper towel and dusted with talc to prevent the polymers from sticking to themselves or other surfaces.
      <br/>
      The free films were stacked alternately with paper towels and allowed to dry overnight.
      <br/>
      Tensile and elongation were then determined.
      <br/>
      Tensile strength and percent elongation were determined on free films according to ASTM D 412.

      The results are set forth in the following table.

    <p num="75">The values from the table have been plotted in the FIGURE in which</p>
    <p num="76">
      Line 1 represents pure aspartate prepolymer 1;
      <br/>
      Line 2 represents a 50/50 blend of aspartate prepolymer 1 and diaspartate 1;
      <br/>
      Line 3 represents a 25/75 blend of aspartate prepolymer 1 and diaspartate 1; and

      Line 4 represents pure diaspartate 1.

    <p num="77">
      It can be seen that once the elongation begins to increase for a given resin, it increases proportionately with the functionality of the polyisocyanate for pure aspartate prepolymer 1, pure disaspartate 1 and the 50/50 blend of these aspartate resins.
      <br/>
      The FIGURE also demonstrates that as the amount of the prepolymer in each of the preceding resins decreases, the elongation also decreases for a given polyisocyanate functionality.
      <br/>
      Based on this data, it would be expected that the 25/75 blend would fall between the 50/50 blend and pure diaspartate 1.
      <br/>
      However, this is not the case.
      <br/>
      For certain blends of aspartate resins and isocyanate functionality, the elongation is surprisingly high and approaches the value for pure aspartate prepolymer 1.
