    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="1">The present invention relates to fasteners, in particular to hook and loop type fasteners.</p>
    <p num="2">
      Arrays of molded male fastener elements, e.g., hooks, are often formed integrally with a sheet-form base, to provide a sheet-form fastener component.
      <br/>
      This component can then be engaged with a similar component of female fastener elements to form a "hook and loop" fastener.
      <br/>
      It is desirable that the fastener elements have good strength and toughness, so as to provide strong engagement during repeated use of the fastener.
      <br/>
      It is, on the other hand, desirable that the sheet-form base be relatively soft and flexible, e.g., to allow the base to flex with a fabric article to which it is attached and to prevent the edges of the sheet-form component from causing discomfort to a wearer.

      The present invention can provide a fastener having both relatively hard, durable regions and relatively softer, more flexible regions.

      The inventor has found that such a fastener can be provided by forming, from a cross-linkable polymer, a plurality of molded fastener elements integral with a sheet-form base, and selectively cross-linking regions of the polymer to form the hard, durable regions.
      <br/>
      The regions that are not cross-linked remain relatively soft and flexible.

    <p num="15">
      Advantageously, the hard and soft regions can be positioned as desired to suit a particular application.
      <br/>
      Thus, in certain cases where it is desired that the fastener elements be relatively stiff and durable, while the base be soft and flexible, the fastener elements are cross-linked to a desired degree while the base is not cross-linked or is cross-linked to a lesser degree than the cross-linking of the fastener elements.

      Alternatively, the fastener elements can be formed of a first, relatively hard polymer, and the base from a second, relatively soft polymer.

      Certain aspects of the invention also enable the formation of fastener products having relatively stretchable (i.e., rubbery or elastic) bases and relatively stiff or rigid fastener elements.
      <br/>
      Such products are useful, for instance, in diaper closures, where the elasticity of the base can help to maintain an engagement shear force on the fastener elements.

    <heading>DESCRIPTION OF THE EMBODIMENTS</heading>
    <p num="18">
      Referring to FIG. 1, fastener 10 includes a plurality of hooks 12 that are integral with, and extend from, a sheet-form base 14.
      <br/>
      The hooks and base may be formed from the same cross-linkable polymer or, alternatively, may be formed of different polymers.
      <br/>
      If they are formed from different polymers the hook-forming polymer is cross-linkable; the other polymer can be either cross-linkable or non-cross-linkable.
      <br/>
      Hooks 12 are cross-linked, while the base 14 is not cross-linked or is cross-linked to a lesser degree than the hooks.
      <br/>
      As a result, the hooks are tough and durable, while the base is soft and flexible.
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      The base should be sufficiently strong to withstand its intended use without tearing or other damage, while also being relatively thin and flexible, to give good "drape".
      <br/>
      Preferably, the base is less than 0.005 inch thick, more preferably from about 0.001 to 0.003 inch thick.
    </p>
    <p num="20">The hooks have a significantly higher flexural modulus than the base, preferably at least 25% higher and more preferably at least 50% higher.</p>
    <p num="21">
      FIG. 2 illustrates a suitable process for forming the fastener shown in FIG. 1.
      <br/>
      As shown in FIG. 2, a cross-linkable polymer 16 is extruded by extruder 18 onto a roll 19 having hook forming cavities 20 (e.g., as described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,872,243, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein), forming hooks 21 extending from a base 22.
      <br/>
      It is noted that this step is shown merely as an example, and can be replaced by any desired method of molding hooks on a base, e.g., the processes described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,894,060, 4,794,028 and 5,441,687, the disclosures of which are incorporated by reference herein.
    </p>
    <p num="22">
      The resulting hook-carrying base 22 then passes to a cross-linking station A, shown in further detail in FIG. 2A. At cross-linking station A, the base 22 passes through a bath of an inert shielding fluid 24, e.g., a solution of salts of heavy metals such as barium, or a cooled bath of liquid mercury, while the hooks 21 remain above the surface 26 of the fluid.
      <br/>
      While the base 22 is in the bath, the hooks are exposed to radiation (arrows E), e.g., electron beam radiation, causing the hooks to cross-link or partially cross-link.
      <br/>
      If it is desired that the base of the hooks remain flexible, the hooks can be partially submerged in the bath along with the base.
    </p>
    <p num="23">
      An alternative process is shown in FIG. 3.
      <br/>
      In this process, the bath of shielding fluid is omitted, and instead the hook-carrying base 22 passes through a series of rolls 28, 30, 32.
      <br/>
      The arrangement of the rolls causes the base 22 to bend around rolls 28 and 32, forming bent areas.
      <br/>
      Electron beams E1, E2, that point in the machine direction (in the plane of the page, in FIG. 3), are then directed at the bent areas.
      <br/>
      Thus, the electron beams will cross-link the hooks without significantly affecting the base.
      <br/>
      If desired, more rolls can be provided downstream of roll 32, in a similar arrangement, to provide more bent areas at which radiation can be directed.
    </p>
    <p num="24">
      Polymers that are suitable for use in this embodiment of the invention are those that can be molded to form fastener elements and can subsequently be selectively cross-linked, as described above.
      <br/>
      Suitable polymers include polyvinyl chloride (PVC), polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF), poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET), polyacrylates, polyamides, thermoplastic elastomers, e.g., HYTREL elastomers and PEBAX elastomers, and mixtures thereof.
      <br/>
      Polyester-based thermoplastic elastomers, e.g., HYTREL elastomers, and polyether/polyamide-based thermoplastic elastomers, e.g., PEBAX elastomers, are preferred.
      <br/>
      Many of these polymers will require suitable cross-linking agents in order to cross-link when exposed to radiation.
      <br/>
      Suitable cross-linking agents are well known to those skilled in the art.
      <br/>
      Suitable polymers that contain electron beam cross-linking agents include thermoplastic elastomers available from Zylon Corp., Monsey, N.Y. 10952, under the trade name "ZYLON EBXL TPE".
      <br/>
      The cross-linkable polymer can also include additives such as fillers, stabilizers, accelerators, and the like, as is well known.
    </p>
    <p num="25">
      Cross-linking can be effected using various techniques, e.g., electron beam or ultraviolet radiation, heat, or any other desired technique suitable for the selected polymer.
      <br/>
      The cross-linking conditions are selected based on the polymer used and the properties desired.
    </p>
    <p num="26">
      In alternative embodiments, a first polymer is used to form the hooks and a second polymer is used to form the base.
      <br/>
      Thus, the hook-forming polymer can be cross-linkable and the base-forming polymer can be non-cross-linkable (or not cross-linkable under the conditions used to cross-link the hook-forming polymer), so that it is not necessary to "mask" the base during cross-linking of the hooks.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, the hook-forming polymer can be harder than the base-forming polymer, and both polymers can have the desired properties without cross-linking.
    </p>
    <p num="27">
      A suitable process for forming such a two-polymer fastener is shown in FIG. 4.
      <br/>
      A first extruder 35 extrudes a first, hook-forming polymer 38 onto mold roll 40, forcing some of the polymer into hook-forming cavities 42 and leaving a layer of polymer on the surface of the mold roll.
      <br/>
      As mold roll 40 rotates in the direction of arrow A, doctoring blade 44 removes some or all of the polymer on the surface of the mold roll without disturbing the polymer in cavities 42.
      <br/>
      The removed polymer, which has been exposed to air while on the mold roll and may have begun to solidify, may be either discarded or returned to the hopper for remelting.
      <br/>
      The thickness of polymer left on the surface of the roll by the doctoring blade will depend, in part, on how close the blade is positioned to the surface of the mold roll (the position is adjustable in the direction indicated by arrow B).
      <br/>
      In some cases, the sharp, distal end of blade 44 rides against the mold roll, thereby literally scraping off essentially all of the polymer on the surface of the roll.
      <br/>
      In such cases it is recommended that the end of the blade be coated with a lubricious material to avoid damaging the surface of the mold roll.
      <br/>
      In other cases, the position of the blade is adjusted to leave a predetermined thickness of polymer on the roll, to become a part of the base of the product.
      <br/>
      In such cases, the doctoring blade effectively trims the polymer thickness rather than actually "scraping" against the surface of the roll.
      <br/>
      Next, a second extruder 47 extrudes a second, base-forming polymer 50 onto the surface of the mold roll (or onto any of polymer 38 left on the surface of the roll by blade 44).
      <br/>
      A gear pump 36, 48, is positioned at the outlet of each extruder, to accurately control the rate of polymer delivered to the mold roll.
      <br/>
      The final thickness of the base of the product is then adjusted by roll 52, rotating in the direction of arrow C, and the finished fastener product 60 is stripped from the mold roll 40 by passing it around exit roll 54.
    </p>
    <p num="28">
      For forming a fastener product having a relatively stretchable base and relatively stiff fastener elements, a urethane may be employed for the hook-forming polymer 38 and a rubber-filled polyethylene or polyester based thermoplastic may be employed for the base-forming polymer 50.
      <br/>
      An example of such a base-forming material is ARNITEL EM400, available from DSM.
    </p>
    <p num="29">Examples of various fasteners that can be formed using the process shown in FIG. 4 (or modifications of this process) are shown in FIGS. 5-5D.</p>
    <p num="30">
      FIG. 5 shows a fastener 62, in which the hooks 64 are formed of a first polymer and the base 66 is formed of a second polymer.
      <br/>
      Using the process shown in FIG. 4, such a fastener can be formed by scraping substantially all of the first polymer off of the surface of the mold roll prior to applying the second polymer.
    </p>
    <p num="31">
      FIG. 5A shows a fastener 68, in which the hooks 70 and the upper portion 72 of the base 74 are formed of a first polymer, and the lower portion 76 of base 74 is formed of a second polymer.
      <br/>
      Using the process shown in FIG. 4, such a fastener can be formed by adjusting doctoring blade 46 away from the mold roll surface so that a thin layer of the first polymer remains on the mold roll surface when the second polymer is applied.
      <br/>
      When using a stiff first polymer and a flexible or stretchable second polymer, the layer of first polymer is preferably sufficiently thin, as determined by the positioning of the doctoring blade, to enable the rupture of the thin layer of first polymer upon the initial stretch of the second polymer layer, such as during the initial engagement of a diaper tab.
      <br/>
      Subsequently, the rigidity of the thin layer of the first polymer does not detract from the stretchability of the base of the fastener product.
    </p>
    <p num="32">
      FIG. 5B shows a fastener 78, in which the hooks 80 are formed of a first polymer 82 and a second polymer 84, and the base 86 is formed of a third polymer 88.
      <br/>
      To form this fastener, the process shown in FIG. 4 is modified so that the first extruder 35 applies an amount of the first polymer that only partially fills the mold cavities, and then another extruder (not shown in FIG. 4) applies the second hook-forming polymer to completely fill the cavities.
      <br/>
      The process then continues as shown in FIG. 4, with scraping and application of the base-forming polymer by extruder 47.
      <br/>
      If the two polymers 82, 84 are not compatible, or do not adhere well to each other, a thin tie layer of adhesive, or a third polymer that adheres well to both polymers 82 and 84, can be applied between polymers 82 and 84.
      <br/>
      This can be accomplished by replacing extruder 47 with a co-extrusion die, or by other known methods of applying tie layers.
    </p>
    <p num="33">
      FIG. 5C shows a fastener 90 in which the hooks 92 are formed of three different polymers 94, 96, 98.
      <br/>
      This fastener would be formed in a manner similar to that described below with reference to FIG. 5D, adding a further extruder to apply the third hook-forming polymer.
      <br/>
      This embodiment can provide combinations of properties difficult to obtain with only two polymers.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, the middle polymer 96 may be used as a "tie layer" to bond polymers 94 and 98 if, for example, these polymers are incompatible or do not adhere well to each other.
    </p>
    <p num="34">
      FIG. 5D shows a fastener 100 in which the base 102 and a lower portion 104 of hooks 106 are formed of a first polymer, and the upper portion 108 of the hooks is formed of a second polymer.
      <br/>
      This fastener would be formed by the process of FIG. 4, by only partially filling the molding cavities using extruder 35, and then completing the filling of the cavities with extruder 47.
    </p>
    <p num="35">
      FIGS. 6 and 7 show alternative processes for forming a two-polymer fastener.
      <br/>
      In the process shown in FIG. 6, the first and second polymers are applied to the mold roll by a coextruder 110.
      <br/>
      In the process shown in FIG. 7, the hook-forming polymer is applied to the mold roll by an extruder 112, and most of the polymer is scraped from the surface of the mold roll by a doctoring blade 114, leaving a thin film of polymer, as described above with reference to FIG. 4.
      <br/>
      The base-forming polymer 116 is then laminated to the thin film of hook-forming polymer while the latter is still on the mold roll, such as in the nip between the mold roll and roll 118, as shown.
    </p>
    <p num="36">
      The hook-carrying base that is formed using any of the processes shown in FIGS. 4, 6 and 7 can be partially cross-linked, if one of the polymers (preferably the hook-forming polymer) is cross-linkable.
      <br/>
      If the other polymer is not cross-linkable, or not cross-linkable under the same conditions, it is not necessary to mask or shield that component.
      <br/>
      Thus, for example, an electron beam can be directed at the entire fastener (positioned so that it hits at least the portions to be cross-linked) at a station (not shown) that is downstream of the processes shown in FIGS. 4, 6 and 7.
      <br/>
      If both polymers have the desired properties for a given application without cross-linking, the hook-carrying base formed by the processes shown in FIGS. 4, 6 and 7 can be used "as-is", without a further cross-linking step.
    </p>
    <p num="37">
      Polymers that are suitable for use in the fasteners shown in FIGS. 5-5D include the above-described cross-linkable polymers, if cross-linking is used.
      <br/>
      If cross-linking is not used, suitable polymers for the relatively hard portions of the fastener include polypropylenes, e.g., PROFAX 7823 polymer, commercially available from Montell USA, Inc., and other relatively hard polymers such as PET and polyamides, e.g., polyamide 6/6 and polyamide 6.
      <br/>
      Preferably, the relatively hard polymer has a flexural modulus of at least 80,000, more preferably at least 120,000 psi.
      <br/>
      Suitable polymers for the relatively soft portions include vulcanized blends of polypropylene and EPDM, e.g., SANTOPRENE polymers, commercially available from Advanced Elastomer Systems, Inc., and other relatively soft polymers such as those commercially available under the trade names HYTREL and PEBAX.
      <br/>
      Preferably, the relatively soft polymer has a flexural modulus of greater than 80,000, more preferably about 10,000 to 60,000 psi.
      <br/>
      It is preferred that the two polymers be compatible, i.e., that they adhere to one another and that they be relatively inert with respect to each other (or, if they are reactive, that such reaction does not have a significant deleterious effect on the desired properties of the polymers).
      <br/>
      If they are incompatible, a tie layer can be used to join them, as discussed above.
    </p>
    <p num="38">
      Other embodiments are within the claims.
      <br/>
      For example, while FIG. 1 shows loop-engageable, hook-shaped fastener elements, the fastener elements may be of any desired shape (e.g., mushrooms, loops, multi-directional hooks, or spikes).
      <br/>
      The touch fastener can also include other raised structures such as veins, ridges, or rip-stopping formations, which would preferably be selectively cross-linked with the fastener elements.
    </p>
    <p num="39">Moreover, while the touch fastener shown in FIG. 1 includes a non-cross-linked base and cross-linked fastener elements, for other applications other regions of the fastener are cross-linked and non-cross-linked.</p>
