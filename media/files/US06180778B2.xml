      The present invention pertains to a process for the chromatographic separation of nucleic acid mixtures into their double-stranded and single-stranded nucleic acid fractions by simultaneously absorbing said nucleic acids as a whole to a mineral support, followed by separation into double-stranded and single-stranded nucleic acids by fractional elution, or by selectively absorbing double-stranded or single-stranded nucleic acid of a liquid sample to a mineral support, as well as solutions and a kit for performing the process according to the invention.

    <p num="2">The present invention pertains to a process for the chromatographic separation of nucleic acid mixtures into their double-stranded and single-stranded nucleic acid fractions by simultaneously absorbing whole nucleic acids to a mineral support, followed by separation into double-stranded nucleic acid and single-stranded nucleic acid by fractional elution, or by selectively absorbing double-stranded nucleic acid or single-stranded nucleic acid of a liquid sample to a mineral support, as well as solutions and a kit for performing the process according to the invention.</p>
    <p num="3">
      The preparation of nucleic acids, both RNA and DNA, has increasingly gained importance.
      <br/>
      This involves, for example, lysing the biological sources from which the RNA or DNA is to be isolated, for instance, by mechanical action or chemical action, such as treatment with detergents etc.
      <br/>
      Thus, the cell lysis for recovery of the nucleic acid is usually followed by a cesium chloride density gradient centrifugation or an extraction with phenol.
      <br/>
      Although useful for the isolation of nucleic acids, these methods have drawbacks which make their use difficult.
      <br/>
      Thus, cesium chloride density gradient centrifugation requires the use of time-consuming and expensive ultracentrifugation while working with phenol is questionable for workers' protection reasons.
    </p>
    <p num="4">Thus, attempts to simplify the isolation of nucleic acids have been abundant in the past.</p>
    <p num="5">
      DE 36 39 949 A1, DE 40 34 036 A1 or DE 41 39 664 A1 are concerned, e.g., with improvements of nucleic acid purification by chromatographic methods while avoiding methods which require much equipment, such as high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC).
      <br/>
      Although these methods already represent a progress over, for example, ultracentrifugation or phenol extraction, they are relatively complicated technically and labor-intensive.
      <br/>
      Since a number of successive purification steps is frequently required for fractionation, processing of small sample quantities is particularly problematic, e.g., due to substance losses.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      EP 0 389 063 A2 also pertains to a process for the isolation of nucleic acids.
      <br/>
      The source containing the nucleic acids is lysed in the presence of chaotropic ions and then treated with a material which will adsorb nucleic acids under such conditions.
      <br/>
      As such materials, there are mentioned diatomaceous earth or other silica-containing mineral supports.
      <br/>
      It is possible according to the method mentioned in EP 0 389 063 A2 to simultaneously isolate RNA and DNA, and RNA and ssRNA.
      <br/>
      A desirable fractionation of the nucleic acids bound to the silicon dioxide support into DNA and RNA fractions is not achieved, however.
      <br/>
      RNA can then be digested by the addition of RNase, leaving the DNA.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      In U.S. Pat. No. 5,155,018, Gillespie et al. disclose a process for the isolation and purification of biologically active RNA from biological sources containing RNA, DNA and other cell contents.
      <br/>
      The source containing RNA is contacted with particles which consist of silica gel containing materials, such as finely divided glass.
      <br/>
      The binding buffer from which the RNA is adsorbed to the material is acidified solutions containing chaotropic salts.
      <br/>
      Under such conditions, RNA is bound to the silica material while DNA is not.
      <br/>
      The use of acidified chaotropic buffers has the drawback that an acidification of binding buffers containing guanidinium thiocyanate (GTC) involves the risk of hydrogen cyanide formation, and thus particular precautions must be taken.
      <br/>
      Also, the DNA is destroyed by the action of acid.
      <br/>
      In addition, DNA purification from the authentic sample cannot be performed by this method.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      In U.S. Pat. No. 5,075,430, Little describes a process for the purification of plasmid and other DNA, both single-stranded and double-stranded, by immobilizing the DNA on diatomaceous earth in the presence of a chaotropic agent, followed by elution of the DNA with water or a buffer of low salt content.
      <br/>
      Purification of DNA/RNA is not possible according to this method.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      In "Analytical Biochemistry" 121, pages 382 to 387 (1982), M. A. Marko et al. describe a process for the isolation of highly purified plasmid DNA on a large scale using alkaline extraction and binding to glass powder.
      <br/>
      A fractionation and separate purification of RNA and DNA from a single sample is not described.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      The raw preparation of the nucleic acids is followed by subsequent reactions.
      <br/>
      These subsequent reactions make certain demands on both the isolation procedure and the purity and integrity of the isolated nucleic acids.
      <br/>
      Especially when followed by enzymatic amplification reactions, such as PCR (polymerase chain reaction), LCR (ligase chain reaction), NASBA (nucleic acid sequence-based amplification), or 3SR (self-sustained sequence replication), the preparation of the nucleic acids should be possible without the risk of cross-contaminations by other samples, and the isolated nucleic acids should be free of interfering cell components and/or metabolites.
      <br/>
      Due to its specificity and sensitivity, enzymatic amplification of DNA (e.g. PCR) or RNA (e.g. RNA-PCR) is gaining importance, not only in basic research, but also increasingly in the medical field for diagnostic use, such as, for example, for the detection of nucleic acid sequences from minute amounts of cells and/or tissues or biopsy materials, or for the detection of viral nucleic acids from blood or plasma.
      <br/>
      In addition to the requirements mentioned, these applications make the highest demands on yields and reproducibility of the process for the isolation of nucleic acids.
    </p>
    <p num="11">
      One object of the invention is to provide a process which is successful not only in separately purifying RNA and DNA from the same biological sample, such as cell lysates and tissue lysates, but generally in separating double-stranded from single-stranded nucleic acids.
      <br/>
      Operation of the process should be as inexpensive as possible, for example, by using inexpensive unmodified separating materials.
      <br/>
      In addition, the process should also be suited for sample preparation for diagnostics and be compatible with various amplification methods.
      <br/>
      Further, the drawbacks mentioned in the discussion of the prior art should be avoided.
    </p>
    <p num="12">Surprisingly, the object of the invention is achieved by a process having the features of four process alternatives; to solutions for use in the process according to the invention or the use of such solutions, and to a kit containing the components necessary for performing the process according to the invention.</p>
    <p num="13">In more detail, the process according to the invention for the fractionation of double-stranded and single-stranded nucleic acid structures from biological sources is represented by the following process alternatives.</p>
    <p num="14">
      The sample containing the nucleic acid types to be separated (single-stranded and double-stranded ones) is treated with at least one mineral support wherein the treatment conditions are adjusted with an appropriate aqueous mixture of salts, especially chaotropic substances, and materials containing alcohol groups, such that the single-stranded nucleic acid fraction is predominantly adsorbed on a first mineral support whereas the double-stranded nucleic acid is not adsorbed.
      <br/>
      Then, the double-stranded nucleic acid flowing out can be further processed with per se known methods.
      <br/>
      After optionally performed washing steps, the single-stranded nucleic acid adsorbed on the first mineral support is eluted under conditions of low ionic strength or with water.
      <br/>
      The non-adsorbed double-stranded nucleic acid collected can be further purified, e.g., by subsequently adjusting the fraction with an appropriate aqueous mixture of salts, especially chaotropic substances, and materials containing alcohol groups to such conditions that the double-stranded nucleic acid becomes adsorbable to a second mineral support and, after optionally performed washing steps, becomes elutable under conditions of low ionic strength or with water.
    </p>
    <p num="15">
      In a second embodiment of the process according to the invention, the treatment conditions for the separation of single-stranded nucleic acid and double-stranded nucleic acid are adjusted such that materials complexing alkaline earth metal ions are contained in the solution in the absence of materials containing alcohol groups wherein said single-stranded nucleic acid is not adsorbed on the first mineral support and can be separated from the rest of the sample.
      <br/>
      The single-stranded nucleic acid separated can then be further processed by per se known methods.
      <br/>
      The double-stranded nucleic acid, however, predominantly binds to the first mineral support and, after optionally performed washing steps, can be eluted under conditions of low ionic strength or with water.
      <br/>
      The double-stranded nucleic acid thus obtained can then be further purified by per se known methods.
    </p>
    <p num="16">The non-adsorbed single-stranded nucleic acid collected can subsequently be adjusted, in particular by addition of materials containing alcohol groups, to such conditions that the single-stranded nucleic acid becomes adsorbable to a second mineral support and, after optionally performed washing steps, becomes elutable under conditions of low ionic strength or with water.</p>
    <p num="17">
      If the treatment conditions are adjusted such that wetting, washing or dispersing agents are contained in the solution in the absence of materials containing alcohol groups, the single-stranded nucleic acid is not adsorbed on a first mineral support under such conditions and thus can be separated from the rest of the sample and further processed.
      <br/>
      The double-stranded nucleic acid, however, predominantly binds to the first mineral support and, after optionally performed washing steps, can be eluted under conditions of low ionic strength or with water.
      <br/>
      The eluted double-stranded nucleic acid can then be further processed by per se known methods.
    </p>
    <p num="18">The non-adsorbed single-stranded nucleic acid collected can subsequently be adjusted, preferably by addition of materials containing alcohol groups, to such conditions that the single-stranded nucleic acid becomes adsorbable to a second mineral support and, after optionally performed washing steps, becomes elutable under conditions of low ionic strength or with water.</p>
    <p num="19">
      Another embodiment of the process according to the invention ensures the fractionation of single-stranded nucleic acid and double-stranded nucleic acid bound in common.
      <br/>
      This involves adjusting the treatment conditions with an appropriate aqueous mixture of salts, especially chaotropic substances, and materials containing alcohol groups, such that the whole nucleic acid consisting of single-stranded nucleic acid and double-stranded nucleic acid becomes adsorbed on a mineral support, followed by fractionation of the double-stranded/single-stranded nucleic acid bound to the first support by selective elution of the double-stranded nucleic acid by treatment with a solution of reduced ionic strength and reduced concentration of a material containing alcohol groups, or elution of the single-stranded nucleic acid with a solution containing a material complexing alkaline earth metal ions and/or a wetting, washing or dispersing agent as well as one or more types of salts, especially chaotropic substances.
      <br/>
      In the first case, the single-stranded nucleic acid then remains bound to the support whereas in the second case the double-stranded nucleic acid remains bound to the mineral support.
      <br/>
      The respective eluted fraction can then be further processed by per se known methods.
    </p>
    <p num="20">Adjusting the treatment conditions with materials containing alcohol groups and salts, especially chaotropic substances, for the separation of the nucleic acids is performed, according to the invention, based on the following physicochemical principles which are formulated here for the first time.</p>

      Described here is the RNA/DNA binding from a tissue lysate to a mineral support as a function of the concentration of a material containing alcohol groups (here, ethanol) and a chaotropic substance (here, GTC).
      <br/>
      Under the condition that the concentration of one of the substances, alcohol or chaotropic substance, is constant, it is found that at a high alcohol concentration and/or amount of chaotropic substance, both types of nucleic acid (RNA/DNA) are bound to the mineral support.
      <br/>
      If the concentration of one or both substances (alcohol or chaotropic agent) becomes less than a defined value, none of the nucleic acids will bind to the mineral support to any substantial extent.
      <br/>
      Surprisingly, in between, RNA and DNA will bind to the mineral support to such different extents as can be made use of for the separation of the nucleic acids.
      <br/>
      Thus, proceeding from cells, and after lysis of the cells with a high concentration of chaotropic substances, the concentrations of chaotropic substance and material containing alcohol groups can be adjusted by subsequent addition of a material containing alcohol groups or a mixture of material containing alcohol groups and water or buffer such that a selective binding of the RNA is achieved while the DNA remains in the break-through.
      <br/>
      In the example according to FIG. 1, concentrations of 1.75 M GTC and 30% by volume of ethanol would be selected in order to achieve a separation of RNA from DNA by fractional binding.
    </p>
    <p num="22">
      On the other hand, simultaneous binding of single-stranded nucleic acid and double-stranded nucleic acid to the mineral support can be achieved under conditions of high concentration of material containing alcohol groups and/or high concentration of chaotropic substance, and desorption of the double-stranded nucleic acid can be initiated first by reducing the concentration of the material containing alcohol groups and/or chaotropic substance.
      <br/>
      The single-stranded nucleic acid remains bound and will elute when the concentration of one or both of the substances is still reduced.
      <br/>
      In the example according to FIG. 1, concentrations of 1.75 M GTC and 45% by volume of ethanol would be selected in order to achieve binding of the whole nucleic acid.
      <br/>
      As illustrated in example 8, concentrations of 0.3 M GTC and 10% by volume of ethanol would be selected for selective desorption of the DNA.
    </p>
    <p num="23">Thus, it is possible to separate RNA and DNA by adsorption to a mineral support, or to adsorb the whole nucleic acid first to the mineral support and then to selectively elute the single-stranded nucleic acid or double-stranded nucleic acid.</p>
    <p num="24">Optionally, washing steps may also be performed prior to the elution of the respective nucleic acid (single-stranded nucleic acid or double-stranded nucleic acid).</p>
    <p num="25">
      Then, the elution will be effected respectively under conditions of low ionic strength or with water.
      <br/>
      The nucleic acid desorbed first from the mineral support is subsequently adjusted by increasing the ionic strength and/or concentration of the materials containing alcohol groups such that the double-stranded nucleic acid or single-stranded nucleic acid is adsorbed to a second mineral support and, after optionally performed washing steps, is eluted under conditions of low ionic strength or with water.
    </p>
    <p num="26">Since nucleic acids will adsorb to mineral supports, for example, in sodium chloride/ethanol mixtures as well and can be eluted under conditions of low ionic strength or with water, it may be supposed that the salt solutions used in the process according to the invention need not necessarily contain chaotropic salts, but that any salt solution in combination with a material containing alcohol groups may be used.</p>
    <p num="27">
      The process according to the invention advantageously enables the processing of small sample quantities, ensures a simple and safe handling and avoids precipitation steps.
      <br/>
      Further, the process according to the invention can be performed in a rather inexpensive and little personnel-intensive way and readily enables the simultaneous processing of numerous samples.
      <br/>
      Due to its versatility and easy handling, the process is also suited for automated operation.
    </p>
    <p num="28">
      By the process according to the invention, double-stranded/single-stranded nucleic acid structures can be separated from sources containing nucleic acid structures.
      <br/>
      The sources which can contain the nucleic acid structures to be separated may include, e.g., the sources mentioned herein.
      <br/>
      These are, in particular, cell cultures, tissues of all kinds, body fluids, such as blood, plasma, serum, urine, faeces; microorganisms, such as bacteria, viruses, such as cytomegaly virus, HIV, hepatitis B, hepatitis C, hepatitis  DELTA  virus; plants, plant parts, embryos, germs, fruits, or mixtures containing nucleic acids following enzymatic reactions, such as in vitro transcription and/or cDNA synthesis and/or reverse transcription with subsequent polymerase chain reaction (PCR).
    </p>
    <p num="29">
      Preferably, cells are first lysed in an aqueous lysis system containing chaotropic substances and/or other salts by, in the simplest case, adding it to the cells.
      <br/>
      Optionally, the lysis process may be promoted by mechanical action.
    </p>
    <p num="30">Thereafter, the sample thus treated is further processed depending on the problem, i.e. which type of nucleic acid is to be separated from the other, as described in the process steps according to the instant invention.</p>
    <p num="31">
      Some of the starting materials mentioned cannot be lysed directly in aqueous systems containing chaotropic substances, such as bacteria, for instance, due to the condition of their cell walls.
      <br/>
      Therefore, these starting materials must be pretreated, for example, with lytic enzymes, prior to being used in the process according to the invention.
    </p>
    <p num="32">Systems for lysing the sources containing the nucleic acids are preferably solutions of chaotropic substances in concentrations of from 0.1 to 10 M. As said chaotropic substances, there may be used, in particular, salts, such as sodium perchlorate, guanidinium chloride, guanidinium isothiocyanate/guanidinium thiocyanate, sodium iodide, potassium iodide, and/or combinations thereof.</p>
    <p num="33">Aqueous solutions containing salts, such as sodium chloride, lithium chloride, potassium chloride, sodium acetate, magnesium chloride, in concentrations of from 0.1 to 10 M, or urea in corresponding concentrations of from 0.1 to 10 M, and/or combinations of such materials may also be used as aqueous systems for lysing or binding the sources containing the nucleic acids.</p>
    <p num="34">
      The materials containing the alcohol groups are preferably lower aliphatic alcohols having from 1 to 5 carbon atoms, such as methanol, ethanol, isopropanol, butanol and pentanol.
      <br/>
      They are preferably employed in concentrations of from 1 to 90% by volume.
    </p>
    <p num="35">The mineral support preferably consists of porous or non-porous metal oxides or mixed metal oxides, silica gel, materials predominantly consisting of glass, such as unmodified glass particles, powdered glass, quartz, alumina, zeolites, titanium dioxide, zirconium dioxide, the particle size of the mineral support material being from 0.1  MU m to 1000  MU m, and the pore size being from 2 to 1000  MU m. Said porous or non-porous support material may be present in the form of loose packings or may be embodied in the form of filter layers made of glass, quartz or ceramics, and/or a membrane in which silica gel is arranged, and/or particles or fibers made of mineral supports and fabrics of quartz or glass wool, as well as latex particles with or without functional groups, or frit materials made of polyethylene, polypropylene, polyvinylidene fluoride, especially ultra high molecular weight polyethylene, high density polyethylene.</p>
    <p num="36">As the substance binding alkaline earth metal ions, there may be used, in particular, ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) or EGTA, and a sarcosinate may be employed as a wetting, washing or dispersing agent.</p>
    <p num="37">If desired, the nucleic acids obtained according to the invention may be further purified by chromatographic methods, such as anion exchange chromatography.</p>
    <p num="38">In the process according to the invention, RNA, in particular, as the single-stranded nucleic acid, may be separated from double-stranded nucleic acid (DNA) . If DNA is present in a single-stranded form, such DNA may also be separated from double-stranded DNA, as well as from double-stranded RNA.</p>
    <p num="39">
      The solutions employed in the process according to the invention are also a subject-matter of the present invention.
      <br/>
      As the lysis buffers and/or binding buffers, there may be used according to the invention, in particular, aqueous solutions containing from 0.5 to 8.0 M of guanidinium isothiocyanate/guanidinium thiocyanate, and/or guanidinium chloride, and from 0 to 50% of ethanol and/or isopropanol.
    </p>
    <p num="40">As the solution for washing out or eluting nucleic acids bound to the mineral support, there may be used an aqueous solution containing from 0.1 to 3 M of guanidinium isothiocyanate/guanidinium thiocyanate, and/or guanidinium chloride, together with from 1 to 30% of ethanol and/or isopropanol.</p>
    <p num="41">
      As an aqueous solution system to be employed for binding double-stranded nucleic acid to mineral supports, there may be used an aqueous solution containing from 1 to 5 M of guanidinium isothiocyanate, and/or from 1 to 8 M of guanidinium chloride, together with from 0.1 to 5% of sarcosinates, or from 5 mM to 200 mM of EDTA.
      <br/>
      For binding double-stranded nucleic acid, there may also be used a solution containing from 1 to 5 M of guanidinium thiocyanate, and/or from 1 to 8 M of guanidinium chloride, and from 5 mM to 200 mM of EDTA or EGTA.
    </p>
    <p num="42">
      The kit of components according to the invention for performing the process contains, in particular, hollow bodies suited for flow-through in which the mineral support or supports is (are) arranged in the form already described above.
      <br/>
      The mineral support may be present in loose packing, fixed between two means, or in the form of membranes which are arranged within the hollow body.
      <br/>
      In addition, the kit may contain solutions, or the components for formulating said solutions may be present in a concentrated form.
      <br/>
      The user will then be able to prepare the solutions respectively needed in the necessary concentrations.
    </p>
    <p num="43">
      Another advantageous component of the kit is a device for homogenizing the solution of cell lysates.
      <br/>
      A particularly preferred device for homogenizing is proposed in the International Patent Application WO 95/18851.
      <br/>
      This device essentially consists of at least two porous layers wherein said porous layers have decreasing pore sizes as seen in the direction of flow through the layers.
      <br/>
      When the cell lysate passes through the decreasing pore sizes, the viscous solutions of the cell lysate are being homogenized.
