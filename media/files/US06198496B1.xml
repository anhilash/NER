      <br/>
      A printer includes LED heads and head controllers.
      <br/>
      Each head controller transfers items of data to a corresponding head over a set of common buses.
      <br/>
      The LED head has a receiver activated by a corresponding head selecting signal.
      <br/>
      In one configuration, the common buses may include a selector bus over a data bus.
      <br/>
      Image data and a group of signals are alternately transferred over the data bus, the group of signals including a latch signal for latching the image data into a corresponding head and a strobe signal for driving a corresponding head in accordance with the image data.
      <br/>
      The selector signal allows the receiver to direct the image data and the group of signals into separate data paths.
      <br/>

      Field of the Invention
    </p>
    <p num="2">The present invention relates to printers and facsimile machines, and more particularly to a printer where multiplexed print data is transferred from control circuits to corresponding one of a plurality of print heads via a common bus line.</p>
    <p num="3">2. Description of Related Art</p>
    <p num="4">
      An electrophotographic color printer incorporates a series of print engines of the same construction.
      <br/>
      Each print engine operates for a corresponding one of yellow, magenta, cyan, and black images.
      <br/>
      Such a system is referred to as tandem system.
      <br/>
      An LED array illuminates a photoconductive drum to form an electrostatic latent image of a corresponding color on the surface of the drum.
      <br/>
      The electrostatic latent image is then developed with a corresponding colored toner into a colored toner image.
      <br/>
      The colored toner image is then transferred to a print medium.
      <br/>
      As the print medium passes through the series of print engines, yellow, magenta, cyan, and black toner images are transferred one over the other on the print medium, thereby producing a full color image.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      However, a tandem system requires a large number of interface cables which increase manufacturing cost.
      <br/>
      For example, a control circuit generates image data for each color and transfers the image data to a corresponding LED print head.
      <br/>
      Therefore, in order to communicate image data and associated control signals, a total of four sets of cables are connected between the respective LED print heads and the circuit board on which the control circuits are built.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      A large number of cables necessarily increases the number of connectors and the number of pins of LSIs that connect cables, and therefore requires large circuit boards.
      <br/>
      This increases the total cost of the printer.
      <br/>
      In addition, a large number of wires radiate more noise, and therefore requires some measure for addressing increased noise radiation.
    </p>
    <p num="7">The aforementioned problems exist not only in a printer having a plurality of LED heads but in thermal transfer type printers, ink jet type printers and the like having a plurality of print heads.</p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="8">An object of the invention is to provide a printer which minimizes the number of cables required for transferring image data and associated control signals such as clock, strobe, and latch.</p>
    <p num="9">
      A printer of the invention includes a plurality of LED heads or the like and a plurality of head controllers.
      <br/>
      Each head controller transfers a plurality of items of data, including image data and control signals associated with the image data, to a corresponding one of the plurality of heads over a set of common buses.
      <br/>
      Each LED head has a receiver that is activated by a corresponding head selecting signal and receives the plurality of items of data.
    </p>
    <p num="10">In the first embodiment, the image data DD is transferred over the data bus and the control signals (clock DK, strobe DS, and latch DL) are transferred over corresponding lines of the set of common buses.</p>
    <p num="11">
      In the second embodiment, the set of common buses include a selector bus over which the selector signal DC is transferred and a data bus over which the image data DD and the a group of signals (strobe DS and latch DL) are alternately transferred.
      <br/>
      The group of signals includes a latch signal DL for latching the image data DD into a corresponding head strobe signals DS for driving a corresponding head in accordance with the image data DD.
      <br/>
      The selector signal DC indicates which of the image data DD and the group of signals is transferred over the data bus.
    </p>
    <p num="12">
      In the third embodiment, encoding the control signals reduces the number of bus lines of the set of common buses.
      <br/>
      In the fourth embodiment, the control signals include a group of signals (strobe DS and latch DL), an image clock, and a control clock.
      <br/>
      The set of common buses include an image clock bus over which the image clock GK is transferred, a control clock bus over which the control clock SK is transferred, and a data bus over which the image data DD and the group of signals are alternately transferred.
      <br/>
      The group of signals is attended by the control clock SK and the image data is attended by the image clock GK.
    </p>
    <p num="13">
      In the fifth embodiment, the image data DD includes a train of image data in which first image data and second image data appear alternately.
      <br/>
      One of two receivers receives the first image data on the rising edges of the image clock GK and the other receivers receives the second image data on the falling edges of the image clock GK.

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="16">The present invention will be described in detail by way of preferred embodiments with reference to the accompanying drawings.</p>
    <p num="17">First Embodiment</p>
    <p num="18">
      FIG. 1 is a cross-sectional view of the printer.
      <br/>
      FIG. 2 is a block diagram showing a printer according to a first embodiment.
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      The printer shown in FIG. 1 is assumed to be a tandem system type electrophotographic printer.
      <br/>
      A total of four photoconductive drums 2A, 2B, 2C, and 2D are provided at a developing/transferring section 1 where images are formed, developed, and transferred to a print medium as the print medium is transported.
    </p>
    <p num="20">
      There are provided four LED heads 3A, 3B, 3C, and 3D which illuminate the corresponding photoconductive drums 2A, 2B, 2C, and 2D to form electrostatic latent images for corresponding color, respectively.
      <br/>
      The four LED heads 3A, 3B, 3C, and 3D are connected to a connection circuit board 6 via connection cables 4A, 4B, 4C, and 4D and connectors 5A, 5B, 5C, and 5D, respectively.
      <br/>
      The connection circuit board 6 is connected to a control circuit board 7 via connectors 8 and 9 and cable 10.
      <br/>
      The data is transferred from the control circuit board 7 to the connection circuit board 6 via the connector 8, cable 10, and connector 9.
      <br/>
      Then, the connection circuit board 6 supplies the data for the respective colors to the corresponding LED heads 3A, 3B, 3C, and 3D.
    </p>
    <p num="21">An object of the present invention is to reduce the number of lines in the cable 10 over which the data and associated signals are transferred from the control circuit board 7 to the connection circuit board 6.</p>
    <p num="22">
      Referring to FIG. 2, the control circuit board 7 has a line timing generator 11, LED head controllers 12A, 12B, 12C, and 12D, and bus buffers 13A, 13B, 13C, and 13D.
      <br/>
      The LED head controllers 12A-12D generate data for corresponding ones of color, yellow, magenta, cyan, and black images, respectively.
      <br/>
      The bus buffers 13A-13D temporarily store the outputs of these LED head controllers and outputs them.
    </p>
    <p num="23">
      The line timing generator 11 includes counters and gate circuits, and generates timings at which the respective LED controllers 12A, 12B, 12C, and 12D output corresponding data, and supply trigger signals 14A, 14B, 14C, and 14D to the corresponding LED heads controllers 12A, 12B, 12C, and 12D, respectively.
      <br/>
      The line timing generator 11 also outputs head selecting signals 15A, 15B, 15C, and 15D to select corresponding LED heads.
    </p>
    <p num="24">
      Each of the bus buffers 13A-13D is connected to a data bus 16, a clock bus 17, a latch bus 18, and a strobe bus 19.
      <br/>
      The data bus 16 and strobe bus 19 are, for example, a 4-bit bus, i.e., each bus requiring four lines.
      <br/>
      Other buses are a one-line bus.
    </p>
    <p num="25">
      The bus buffer 13A receives the head selecting signal 15A at its OE (output enable) terminal.
      <br/>
      The bus buffer 13A receives the data and clock signal from the LED controller 12A and outputs the received data and clock signal to the bus 16 and bus 17, respectively, when the head selecting signal 15A is active.
      <br/>
      When the head selecting signal 15A is not active, the output of the bus buffer 13A becomes a high impedance.
      <br/>
      The other bus buffers 13B-13D operate the same way as the bus buffer 13A.
      <br/>
      The bus buffers 13A-13D are connected one at a time to the data bus 16, clock bus 17, latch bus 18, and strobe bus 19, so that data from a corresponding one of the LED controllers 12A-12D is transferred to the connection circuit board 6 via the corresponding bus buffer.
    </p>
    <p num="26">
      The connection circuit board 6 includes AND gate groups 20A, 20B, 20C, and 20D and connectors 5A, 5B, 5C, and 5D, for LED heads 3A, 3B, 3C, and 3D, respectively.
      <br/>
      Each AND gate group includes two-input AND gates one inputs of which are connected to the data bus 16, clock bus 17, latch bus 18, and strobe bus 19, respectively, and the other inputs of which are connected together and receive the head selecting signal.
      <br/>
      The gates are opened and closed by the head selecting signal which is output from the line timing generator 11 built on the control circuit board 7.
    </p>
    <p num="27">
      FIG. 3 is a block diagram of the LED head controllers 12A.
      <br/>
      The LED controller 12A has an image data transfer section 25 and LED head control signal generator section 27.
      <br/>
      The sections 25 and 27 receive the trigger signal 14A.
      <br/>
      The image data transfer section 25 is connected to an image memory 26 and outputs a necessary address signal to the image memory 26 to read image data for a corresponding color from the image memory 26.
    </p>
    <p num="28">
      The image data transfer section 25 is triggered by the trigger signal 14A to output data DD and clock DK.
      <br/>
      The LED head control signal generator 27 is connected to a counter 28 and outputs signals such as latch DL and strobe DS in timed relation with the CARRY or count of the counter 28.
    </p>
    <p num="29">
      The data DD is a 4-bit multivalue signal, the four bits representing one pixel.
      <br/>
      The clock DK is a control clock on which the data DD is transferred on a bit-by-bit basis.
      <br/>
      The latch DL is a timing signal at which the LED head holds data for one line when the data is transferred to the LED head.
      <br/>
      The strobe DS is a timing signal that causes the LEDs to emit light in accordance with the image data held therein at the timing of the latch DS.
      <br/>
      The LED head includes a plurality of LEDs which are divided into four groups.
      <br/>
      The four groups are energized in turn one group at a time.
      <br/>
      This way of driving LEDs can save drive current since all the groups are not energized simultaneously.
      <br/>
      The aforementioned data DD and timing signals DK, DL, and DS are output to the bus buffer 13A shown in FIG. 1.
      <br/>
      The other LED head controllers 12B, 12C, and 12D are of the same construction as the LED head 12A.
    </p>
    <p num="30">
      FIG. 4 is a flowchart showing the operation of the LED head controller.
      <br/>
      At step S1, a check is made to determine whether the trigger is "1." When the trigger is "1," the program proceeds to step S2 where the image data transfer section 25 reads data for one value of a pixel of the multivalue data of a pixel from the image memory 26 shown in FIG. 3.
      <br/>
      At step S3, the image data transfer section 25 outputs the image data.
      <br/>
      At step S4, the clock DK is set to "1." Then, at step S5, the clock DK remains "1" for a half period and subsequently is set to "0" at step S6.
      <br/>
      At step S7, the clock DK remains "0" for another half period.
      <br/>
      Thus, one value of the multivalue data is output on one clock DK.
      <br/>
      Then, the program proceeds to step S8 where a check is made to determine whether data for one line has been output.
      <br/>
      If the answer is NO, then the program jumps back to step S2.
    </p>
    <p num="31">
      FIG. 5 is a flowchart illustrating how the LED head controller generates the control signals.
      <br/>
      At step S1, a check is made to determine whether the trigger is "1".
      <br/>
      When the trigger is "1," the program proceeds to step S2 where the strobe DS is set to "0001" and the latch DL is set to "0." At step S3, the program waits a time t0 and at step S4 the strobe DS is set to "0010" and the latch DL is set to "0." Thereafter, the program waits a time t1 and at step S6 the strobe DS is set to "0100" and the latch DL is set to "0." At step S7, the program waits a time t2 and at step S8 the content of the strobe DS is set to "1000" and the latch DL is set to "0."
    </p>
    <p num="32">
      At step S9, the program waits a time t3, and at step S10 the strobe DS is set to "0000" and the latch is set to "0.
      <br/>
      At step S11, the program waits a time t4 and at step S12 the strobe DS is set to "0000" and the latch DL is set to "1." Finally, at step S13 the program waits a time t5 and at step S14, the strobe DS is set to "0000" and the latch DL is set to "0."
    </p>
    <p num="33">
      In this manner, the content of the strobe DS is changed in the order of "0001," "0010," "0100," and "1000," thereby driving the four groups of LEDs in the LED head in order.
      <br/>
      Upon completion of the transfer of data for four groups of LEDs, the latch DL is set to "1," thereby latching the data for one line.
      <br/>
      The aforementioned steps are repeated so as to transfer data for four groups of LEDs, latch the data for all four groups, and energize the four groups of LEDs one group at a time.
      <br/>
      The steps S1-S14 are repeated for every line.
    </p>
    <p num="34">FIG. 6 is a flowchart illustrating the operation of generating the times t0-t5.</p>
    <p num="35">
      The aforementioned times t0-t5 have been predetermined taking the operation timings of the apparatus into consideration.
      <br/>
      The times t0-t5 are generated by the counter 28 as follows: At step S1, time data T0 for time t0 is output to the counter 28 and at step S2 the time data T0 is loaded upon a LOAD pulse.
      <br/>
      At step S3, an ENABLE signal of "1" is output to the counter 28.
      <br/>
      Then, the counter 28 begins to count down on the system clock, not shown, and a check is made at step S4 to determine whether CARRY is "1."If the answer is YES at step S4, then an ENABLE signal of "0" is output to the counter 28.
      <br/>
      In this manner, every time the counter 28 is loaded with one of the items of the time data T0, T1, T2, T3, T4, and T5 for times t0, t1, t2, t3, t4, and t5, the counter 28 counts down till the CARRY becomes "1," thereby sequentially generating the respective time data for times t0-t5.
    </p>
    <p num="36">Next, a specific operation of the printer according to the invention will be described.</p>
    <p num="37">FIG. 7 is a timing chart of signals appearing on the buses according to the first embodiment.</p>
    <p num="38">
      The triggers 14A-14D are input to corresponding LED head control circuits 12A-12D at a predetermined timing.
      <br/>
      Each of the head selecting signals 15A-15D opens a corresponding one of four groups of AND gates 20A-20D, one group at a time for the period T.
    </p>
    <p num="39">
      By way of example, the timings will be described with respect to the LED head 3A.
      <br/>
      The head selecting signal 15A is output to the head controller 12A for a time period T and the head controller 12A outputs the data DD for the present one line.
      <br/>
      The data DD is transferred over the data bus 16, and the clock DK for transferring the data is sent over the clock bus 17.
      <br/>
      The strobe DS is also transferred over the strobe bus 19.
      <br/>
      It is to be noted that this strobe DS is used to drive the LEDs in the LED head 3A in accordance with the image data DD which was previously latched.
      <br/>
      The strobe DS "0001," "0010," "0100," and "1000" are shown in decimal expressions "1", "2", "4", or "8" in FIG. 7 for convenience.
      <br/>
      The values "1", "2", "4", and "8" are transferred in order, each value driving a corresponding one of the four groups of the LEDs so that the four groups are driven one at a time.
      <br/>
      After the data DD for the present one line has been transferred, the latch signal DL is transferred over the latch bus 18.
      <br/>
      The latched data will be used to drive the four groups of the LEDs of the LED head 3A for a time period T during which data for the following one line is transferred to the LED head 3A.
    </p>
    <p num="40">In this manner, the data DD is transferred to the respective LED heads over the cable 10 shown in FIG. 1 in time division form.</p>
    <p num="41">FIG. 8 is a timing chart illustrating signals supplied to the respective LED heads 3A-3D.</p>
    <p num="42">
      The respective LED heads 3A-3D receive corresponding data DD, clock DK, latch DL, and strobe DS.
      <br/>
      The data DD and control signals (DK, DL, and DS) are the same as those in the conventional apparatus.
      <br/>
      That is, the circuit in FIG. 1 operates in such a way that the control circuit board 7 communicates with the connection board 6 to transfer data DD and control signals (DK, DL, and DS) to the respective heads, thereby driving the respective heads.
      <br/>
      It is to be noted that as described with reference to FIG. 7, the strobe DS is to drive the LEDs in the respective LED head with the data DD for one line which has been latched at the end of the previous period T during which the data for the previous one line was transferred to the LED head.
    </p>
    <p num="43">Advantages of the First Embodiment</p>
    <p num="44">
      A plurality of items of data for corresponding LED heads are time-division multiplexed and transferred over one set of cable assembly for a single LED head.
      <br/>
      In other words, the cable assembly serves as a set of common buses to transfer the image data DD and control signals DK, DL, and DS to the respective LED heads.
      <br/>
      This way of transmitting signals greatly reduces the number of sets of cable assembly that run between the control circuit board and the connection board.
      <br/>
      The circuit shown in FIG. 1 requires only a set of 10 lines for transferring data DD and control signals DK, DL, and DS from the control circuit board 7 to the connection board 6.
      <br/>
      The 10 lines include 4 lines for the data bus 16, 1 line for the clock bus 17, 1 line for the latch bus 18, and 4 lines for the strobe bus 19.
      <br/>
      Additional 4 lines are required for each LED head in order to transfer the head selecting signals 15A-15D to the connection board 6.
      <br/>
      Thus, a total 26 (=10+4 * 4) lines are required for the control circuit board 7 to communicate the image data DD and control signals DK, DL, and DS with the connection board 6.
      <br/>
      This implies that the total number of lines can be reduced to almost two-thirds of that (10 * 4=40 lines) of the conventional art.
    </p>
    <p num="45">
      Therefore, the construction of the first embodiment eliminates the need for a large number of complicated connectors and high density multi-layer circuit boards made of glass epoxy.
      <br/>
      The construction reduces the total area of the circuit board and the number of connectors, reducing the manufacturing cost.
      <br/>
      The decrease in the number of cables contributes not only to cost reduction but also to reduction of radiated noise.
    </p>
    <p num="46">
      Further, the construction greatly reduces the number of required pins of LSIs which constitute the LED head controller built on the control circuit board 7, thereby reducing the cost of the LSIs.
      <br/>
      Only one connector 9 is required on the connection board 6, making it possible to use inexpensive circuit boards such as a single layer, low density paper phenol board which still reduces the cost.

    <p num="47">
      Although the multiplexing of signals in the first embodiment has been described with respect to the bus buffers 13A-13D, a multiplexer may be used to selectively output the signals DD, DL, DK, and DS over the same signal lines.
      <br/>
      Similar advantages can also be obtained when processors are used instead of hardware in transferring the signals DD, DL, DK, and DS to the respective LED heads by way of software control.
      <br/>
      The first embodiment may also be applicable when transferring data to thermal heads and ink jet heads.

      This way of transferring image data DD reduces the number of cables required.
      <br/>
      In order to alternately transfer the data DD and the control signals DK, DL, and DS for the respective LED heads over the same set of buses, a control bus 31 is added.

      The LED head controller includes an image data FIFO 41 which is used for transferring the image data DD to an image data transfer section 42 in a predetermined sequence.
      <br/>
      The image transfer section 42 is connected to a time information table 43, a control information table 44, and a counter 45, and communicates the data with these sections 43, 44, and 45 to output the clock DK, image data DD, and selector signal DC.

      The counter 45 is loaded with the time data T0.

      At step S6, a check is made to determine whether the CARRY output of the counter 45 is "1" or not; if the answer is NO, then the program proceeds to step S7 where the selector signal DC is set to "0." This completes the preparation of the transfer of the image data DD.
      <br/>
      A step S8, the image data transfer section 42 reads the image data DD from the image data FIFO 41 and outputs the image data DD to the data port.

      If the answer is YES at step S6, then the program proceeds to step S11 where the selector signal DC is set to "1".
      <br/>
      The CARRY output of "1" indicates that the counter 45 has counted down to the end of time data T0.

      The CARRY=1 is a timing at which the next control data should be output from the control information table 44, therefore the next control data is output at step S12 from the control information table 44.

      Then, clocks DK are generated at step S9 and a check is made at step S10 to determine whether all the data for one line has been output to the port.

      The head selecting signal 15A opens the image information gates 34 and 35 and control information gate 36, so that the control signals and image data appear on the output terminals of the corresponding gates.

      Thus, the image data DD can be transferred alternately with the control data DS and DL at predetermined timings, thereby multiplexing the image data DD and control data DS and DL.
      <br/>
      Thus, the fourth embodiment reduces the number of required cables while still providing the same advantages as the first embodiment.

      The image data transfer section 42 outputs 5-bit data, image clock GK, and control clock SK.

      The control data is output at step S3 and a check is made at step S4 to determine whether the CARRY output of the counter 45 is "1"; if the answer is NO, then the program proceeds to step S5 where the image data DD is output, and if the answer is YES, then the program proceeds to step S7 where the control data DS and DL are output.
      <br/>
      In other words, the image data DD is output alternately with the control data DS and DL at predetermined periods.

      The contents of the control information table 44 and time information table 43 are exactly the same as those of the first, second, and fourth embodiments.

      The program waits a quarter period at step S2 and the image clock GK is set to "1" at step S3.

      Thereafter, the image clock GK is allowed to remain "0" for a quarter period at a step S8 before completing the procedure.

      As is clear from FIG. 33, the image clock GK is directly used as the clock signal DK for driving the LED head 3A.
      <br/>
      The LED head 3A reads the image data D01, D03, . . . , D0(n-1), D11, . . . on the rising edges of the clock GK.

      <br/>
      The state "0" of the strobe implies that the strobe is reset and therefore no LED head is specified.
      <br/>
      The image clock GK is supplied to the inverter 55 and an inverted output of the inverter 55 is used as the clock for the LED head 3B.
      <br/>
      The LED head 3B reads the data on the rising edges of the inverted output of the inverter 55.
      <br/>
      This is equivalent to reading the data on the falling edges of the image clock GK, and therefore the LED head 3B reads D02, D04, . . . , D0(n-2), D0n, and D12, . . .

    <p num="118">
      As mentioned above, the data bus 16 transfers the image data DD for LED head 3A alternately with the image data DD for LED head 3B.

      The strobes are the same for the LED heads 3A and 3B.
      <br/>
      The LED head controller 12B also transfers corresponding image data DD and strobes for the LED heads 3C and 3D in the same way as the LED head controller 12A.

      <br/>
      The image clock GK and control clock SK appear alternately on the image clock bus 50 and the control clock bus 51, respectively, so that the image data DD and control data on the data bus 16 are alternately directed to their corresponding circuits.

      The fifth embodiment differs from the first to fourth embodiment in that two LED heads receive corresponding data alternately with each other.

      It can be assumed that the contents of image data and control data are the same throughout the first, second, and fourth embodiments.

    <p num="124">
      The fifth embodiment is effective in reducing the number of required cables.
      <br/>
      Two items of data are transferred alternately over the data bus so that each of the two items of data is transferred to a corresponding LED head, and the receivers for the respective heads receive corresponding data at different timings, i.e., rising edges and falling edges of the image clock.
      <br/>
      This way can transfer the data twice as fast as the conventional conventional data transfer without having to change the timings at which the image data and control data are transferred to a plurality of LED heads, implementing high speed printer at low cost.
