      A coaxial oscillating axisymmetric engine is disclosed.
      <br/>
      The engine is provided with a rotor having a plurality of rotating blades, the blades being movable relative to a plurality of fixed blades of a stator in opposite directions while forming expansion and compression chambers in each cylinder of a housing assembly.
      <br/>
      The rotor thus generates rotational force transmitted to an output shaft through a power transmission unit.
      <br/>
      The transmission unit has two guide rails, inwardly mounted to the rotor at diametrically opposed positions and individually having a guide channel.
      <br/>
      A slider movably engages with each of the guide rails so as to be linearly movable along the guide channel.
      <br/>
      A ball housing is coaxial and axisymmetrically coupled to the slider and is rotatively coupled to each of the drive shaft.

    <heading>TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
    <p num="1">The present invention relates, in general, to coaxial oscillating axisymmetric engines and, more particularly, to a coaxial oscillating axisymmetric engine with a plurality of rotating blades of a rotor being movable relative to a plurality of fixed blades of a cylindrical housing in opposite directions while forming expansion and compression chambers in each cylinder of a housing assembly, thus generating rotational force.</p>
    <heading>DESCRIPTION OF THE PRIOR ART</heading>
    <p num="2">
      The conventional reciprocating engines have been utilized due to their efficient and simple conversion of reciprocating motion of the pistons, to a rotary motion via a crankshaft.
      <br/>
      However, the conventional reciprocating internal combustion engines have fuel efficiency limitations imposed by friction due to the multiplicity of moving parts.
      <br/>
      These moving parts generally include the bearing journals where friction increases with the speed of rotation and the number of bearings, and the piston rings that impose friction by the plurality components operating as a combined system that contributes significant friction to the engine as a whole.
    </p>
    <p num="3">
      In addition, thermal efficiencies of reciprocating internal combustion engines are decreased by the redundancy of the mechanical components, the materials used, the manner of operation and, the use of a common cylinder portion for all the cycle phase.
      <br/>
      Fuel efficient conventional reciprocating internal combustion engines do exist but are highly complex units.
      <br/>
      Such complexity makes manufacturing and assembly cost high.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      The Wankel rotary engine has found application in motor vehicles because of its potential of high performance.
      <br/>
      For various reasons, however, it has not been utilized for general use as a replacement for the conventional piston engines such as commuter vehicles or mass produced small industrial engines.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      Some other types of rotary engines have also been proposed.

      These include toroidal engines having a toroidal cylinder built in the cylinder housing around a driving shaft assembly, rotor supported for rotation about the drive shaft and coupled to pistons in the toroidal shaped cylinder whereby the pistons move cyclically toward and away from one another forming expanding and contracting working chambers within the toroidal cylinder, and, inlet and outlet ports extending through the cylinder housing assembly for entry and exit of fluid to and from the working chambers.

      Typical prior arts of toroidal engines are outlined in "THE WANKEL ENGINE DESIGN DEVELOPMENT APPLICATIONS" by Jan P Norbye published by the Chilton Book Company.
      <br/>
      French patent No. 2498248 and German patent No. 3521593 illustrate prior art toroidal engines.
      <br/>
      Some of these engines utilize external mechanism to effect the cyclic motion of the pistons, which move within the cylinder, while others utilize swash plates and cams and the like in the power train to achieve the desired mechanical coupling of the drive components.

      For the purpose of the production, it is considered that all these prior art engines have disadvantages either in efficiency, configuration, or satisfactory performance under normal working loads such as sustained optimum power delivery.

      Conclusively many of the prior art engines have many shortcomings such as sophisticated manufacturing and inefficient performance.

    <p num="19">
      FIGS. 1 and 2 are views showing the construction of a coaxial oscillating axisymmetric engine in accordance with the one embodiment of the present invention.
      <br/>
      As shown in the drawings, a plurality of parts are integrated into a housing assembly.
      <br/>
      A rotor 30 is set inside the housing assembly, and so forms a plurality of combustion chambers in the housing assembly.
      <br/>
      A power transmission unit is set in the rotor 30, and transmits the power from the combustion chambers to an output shaft 54.
    </p>
    <p num="20">
      Briefly described, the CoReA engine of this invention comprises the housing assembly, the rotor 30, two sliders 56 and 56', and the power transmission unit.
      <br/>
      The housing assembly comprises a rectangular plate 10 having a plurality of internally-threaded bosses 11a to 11d at its comers.
      <br/>
      The housing assembly also has two stators: a first stator 20 provided with the plurality of blades 25a to 25d and a second stator 20'. The position of the above blades 25a to 25d inside of the housing assembly is fixed, so the blades 25a to 25d are preferably called fixed blades.
      <br/>
      The two stators 20 and 20' are placed in a cylindrical housing 40, while a circular sealing member 60 is airtightly coupled to the housing 40.
      <br/>
      A rectangular cover 80, provided with holes 81a to 81d at its corners, is screwed to the bosses 11a to 11d of the plate 10 by conventional bolts or screws, thereby completely forming the housing assembly.
      <br/>
      The rotor 30 is provided with the plurality of blades 32a to 32d and is rotatively set inside the housing assembly.
    </p>
    <p num="21">
      The position of the above blades 32a to 32d inside of the housing assembly is movable, so the blades 25a to 25d are preferably called rotating blades.
      <br/>
      The plurality of combustion, expansion and compression chambers are formed between the fixed blades 25a to 25d and the rotating blades 32a to 32d inside of the housing assembly.
      <br/>
      Two guide rails 33 and 33', individually having a guide channel 33b, 33b', are mounted to the interior surface of the rotor 30 at diametrically opposite positions.
    </p>
    <p num="22">The two sliders 56 and 56' are movably received in the guide channels 33b and 33b' of the guide rails 33 and 33', respectively, thus being linearly movable in the guide channels 33b and 33b'. The power transmission unit comprises two drive shafts 52 and 52', which are respectively coupled to the two sliders 56 and 56'. The two drive shafts 52 and 52' have bevel gears 53, 53' commonly engaging with the output gear 54a of the output shaft 54, in result transmitting the power from the sliders 56 and 56' to the output shaft 54 while converting the linear oscillating motion of the sliders 56 and 56' into a rotary motion of the output shaft 54.</p>
    <p num="23">
      A bolt 12 is fixed to the center of the plate 10 and holds a gear box 50 to which the above drive shafts 52 and 52' are rotatively mounted.
      <br/>
      The bosses 11a to 11d, provided at the corners of the plate 10, respectively have internal threads 14a, 14b, 14c and 14d, so the cover 80 is screwed to the bosses 11a to 11d at the holes 81a to 81d.
      <br/>
      The cover 80, mounted to the housing assembly at a position opposite to the plate 10, has a circular seat 82 on which the sealing means 60 is seated.
      <br/>
      A center opening 83 is formed at the center of the seat 82, thus receiving the output shaft 54.
    </p>
    <p num="24">
      The first stator 20 comprises two discs 21 and 22.
      <br/>
      Of the two discs 21 and 22, the first disc 21 is brought into close contact with the plate 10, while the second disc 22 is arranged in parallel to the first disc 21 with a plurality of spacers 27 (FIG. 1) being interposed between the two discs 21 and 22.
      <br/>
      The blades 25a to 25d, formed on the second disc 22, individually have a locking hole 26a, 26b, 26c, 26d at the outside end, thus allowing the second disc 22 of the first stator 20 to be locked to third and fourth discs 23 and 24 of the second stator 20'.
    </p>
    <p num="25">
      The rotor 30 comprises a cylindrical body 31 which is outwardly provided with the same number of blades 32a to 32d as that of the blades 25a to 25d of the first stator 20.
      <br/>
      The above cylindrical body 31 of the rotor 30 also has a plurality of mounting holes 31a and 31a' at diametrically opposite positions, which permits the two guide rails 33 and 33' to be inwardly and firmly mounted to the cylindrical body 31 at the diametrically opposite positions.
      <br/>
      Of course, the above guide rails 33 and 33' are individually provided with a plurality of holes 33a, 33a' at positions corresponding to the mounting holes 31a, 31a' of the body 31.
    </p>
    <p num="26">
      As described above, the second stator 20', which is arranged at a position opposite to the first stator 20, comprises the two annular discs: the third and fourth discs 23 and 24.
      <br/>
      The two annular discs 23 and 24 are arranged in parallel to each other with the plurality of spacers 27 being interposed between the two discs 23 and 24.
      <br/>
      In order to assemble the two discs 23 and 24 into a single body with the spacers 27, a conventional bolt passes through each smooth hole 24a, 24b, 24c, 24d of the fourth disc 24 and the axial hole 27a of each spacer 27 prior to being screwed into each internally-threaded hole 23a, 23b, 23c, 23d of the third disc 23.
      <br/>
      A plurality of locking holes 28a to 28d are formed on the fourth disc 24 in a way such that the locking holes 28a to 28d and the smooth holes 24a to 24d are alternately arranged on the disc 24.
      <br/>
      The above locking holes 28a to 28d of the fourth disc 24 correspond to the holes 61a to 61d of the sealing member 60a, thus allowing the sealing member 60 to be mounted to the fourth disc 24 by a plurality of conventional screws which pass through the holes 61a to 61d prior to being screwed to the locking holes 28a to 28d.
    </p>
    <p num="27">
      A center opening 63 is formed at the center of the sealing member 60, thus receiving the output shaft 54 which is also fitted into the opening 83 of the cover 80.
      <br/>
      The above sealing member 60 is partially thickened at a position around the center opening 63, thus providing a flat circular boss 62.
      <br/>
      The above boss 62 is tightly seated in the openings of the two annular discs 23 and 24 of the second stator 20', as a result the airtightness of the sealing member 60 is improved.
    </p>
    <p num="28">
      The cylindrical housing 40, surrounding the first and second stators 20 and 20', is provided with a plurality of intake and exhaust ports 40a to 40d and 42a to 42d.
      <br/>
      Each of the intake ports 40a to 40d is connected to an intake pipe, while each of the exhaust ports 42a to 42d is connected to an exhaust pipe.
      <br/>
      One edge of the above cylindrical housing 40 is provided with an annular groove 41 for receiving an O-ring 70.
    </p>
    <p num="29">
      As described above, the two sliders 56 and 56' are movably received in the guide channels 33b and 33b' of the guide rails 33 and 33' inwardly mounted to the rotor 30, respectively.
      <br/>
      Due to the above sliders 56 and 56', the power transmission unit coaxial and axisymmetrically transmits the rotational force from the rotor 30 to the output shaft 54.
      <br/>
      Each of the sliders 56 and 56' has a guide ball 56a, 56a' at one end and opposite guide slots 58, 58' at the other end.
      <br/>
      Each slider 56, 56' thus movably engages with the guide channel 33b, 33b' of an associated guide rail 33, 33' at the slots 58, 58', so the slider 56, 56' is linearly movable along the guide channel 33b, 33b'.
    </p>
    <p num="30">
      A ball housing 55, 55' is coaxial and axisymmetrically coupled to each of the sliders 56 and 56'. The above ball housing 55, 55' comprises a ball seat 55a, 55a' into which a ball 56a, 56a' of each slider 56, 56' is inserted.
      <br/>
      One end of each drive shaft 52, 52' has a flat part 52a, 52a' at which the shaft 52, 52' is hinged to a connection part 57, 57' extending from the ball seat 55, 55'. In order to allow the flat part 52a, 52a' of each drive shaft 52, 52' to be hinged to the connection part 57, 57' of each ball housing 55, 55', the flat part 52a, 52a' and the connection part 57, 57' individually have a locking hole 52a-1, 57b.
    </p>
    <p num="31">
      The two drive shafts 52, 52' have the same construction with the holed flat part 52a, 52a' and the bevel gear 53, 53' at both ends.
      <br/>
      The above drive shafts 52 and 52' are rotatively set in the gear box 50 with the two bevel gears 53 and 53' being opposite and spaced apart from each other.
      <br/>
      The two bevel gears 53 and 53' commonly engage with the output gear 54a of the output shaft 54, so the drive shafts 53 and 53' transmit the rotational force from the rotor 30 to the output shaft 54.
      <br/>
      In such a case, the power transmitting passage from the drive shafts 53 and 53' to the output shaft 54 turns at right angles.
    </p>
    <p num="32">
      FIG. 2 shows the above CoReA engine with the parts being assembled into a single body.
      <br/>
      In the drawing, both the second stator 20' and the cover 80 are shown by the phantom lines for ease of description and comprehension.
      <br/>
      In the above engine, the first stator 20 is fixed to the plate 10.
      <br/>
      Thereafter, the rotor 30 is set on the first stator 20 prior to fixing the second stator 20' to the first stator 20.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, the first and second stators 20, 20' from a stator assembly with the rotor 30 positioned between the two stators 20 and 20'. The housing 40 is fitted over the stator assembly, thus forming a plurality of variable chambers defined between the blades 32a to 32d of the rotor 30, the blades 25a to 25d of the stator assembly and the housing 40.
      <br/>
      Of course, the combustion chambers have to be sealed.
      <br/>
      The gear box 50 is set in the rotor 30.
      <br/>
      The output shaft 54 extends from the gear box 50, thus outputting the rotational force from the rotor 30 during an operational cycle of the engine.
    </p>
    <p num="33">
      FIGS. 3a to 3c are exploded perspective views of the power transmission unit used for coaxial and axisymmetrically transmitting the rotational force from the rotor 30 to the output shaft 54.
      <br/>
      The above power transmission unit comprises two sets of assemblies respectively coupled to the two drive shafts 52 and 52'. However, it should be understood that one of the two assemblies is shown in FIGS. 3a to 3c for ease of description.
      <br/>
      As shown in the drawing, the guide rail 33 is provided with two holes 33a inside the guide channel 33b, so the guide rail 33 is screwed to the interior surface of the rotor 30.
      <br/>
      Meanwhile, the slider 56 has opposite guide slots 58 at one end.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, the slider 56 movably engages with the guide channel 33b of the guide rail 33 at the guide slots 58, so the slider 56 is linearly movable along the guide channel 33b to transmit the rotational force from the rotor 30 to the drive shaft 52.
    </p>
    <p num="34">
      The slider 56 is coupled to the guide rail 33 at right angles.
      <br/>
      The guide channel 33b of the guide rail 33 is provided with opposite guide edges 33a-1 and 33a-2 which movably engage with the opposite slots 58 of the slider 56.
      <br/>
      As a result, the above guide edges 33a-1 and 33a-2 allow the slider 56 to be linearly movable along the guide channel 33b and prevent the slider 56 from being unexpectedly removed from the guide rail 33.
    </p>
    <p num="35">
      FIGS. 4a to 4c are sectional views of the engine of this invention taken along the line 4--4 of FIG. 2, showing the operation of it.
      <br/>
      FIGS. 5a to 5d are views showing a movement of a slider under the guide of a guide channel during each explosion cycle of the engine.
    </p>
    <p num="36">
      Referring first to FIGS. 4a to 4c, the four fixed blades 25a to 25d of the first stator 20 form four cylinders in the housing assembly.
      <br/>
      The above four cylinders are also individually divided into two variable chambers by each rotating blades 32a, 32b, 32c, 32d of the rotor 30, so the housing assembly has eight combustion chambers.
      <br/>
      For ease of description, the operation of the CoReA engine of this invention will be described hereinafter with the first rotating blade 32a of the rotor 30 being movable between the first and second fixed blades 25a and 25b of the stator 20.
      <br/>
      Of course, it should be understood that the remaining rotating blades or the second to fourth blades 32b to 32d of the rotor 30 are operated in the same manner as that of the first rotating blade 32a with regular intervals being formed between the explosion strokes of the blades 32a to 32d.
    </p>
    <p num="37">
      As shown in FIG. 4a, the first rotating blade 32a is positioned between the first and second fixed blades 25a and 25b when the engine is stopped.
      <br/>
      In such a case, the slider 56 is positioned at the upper portion of the guide channel 33b of the guide rail 33 as shown by the solid line in FIG. 5a.
    </p>
    <p num="38">
      When the above engine is started, external force is transmitted from a power source, such as a start motor, to the sliders 56 and 56' through the drive shafts 52 and 52', while air and fuel are introduced into the first chamber C1 of the first cylinder through the first intake port 40a and fuel supplying line which is not shown.
      <br/>
      In such a case, the slider 56 inside the guide channel 33b moves from the position shown by the solid line in FIG. 5a to a position shown by the solid line in FIG. 5b. That is, the slider 56 moves to the lower portion of the guide channel 33b.
      <br/>
      The first rotating blade 32a moves in a direction from the second fixed blade 25b to the first fixed blade 25a as shown in FIG. 4b, thus compressing the mixed fluid of the air and fuel in the chamber C1.
      <br/>
      At the time the first rotating blade 32a reaches the upper dead point or the nearby point in the vicinity of the first fixed blade 25a, the mixed fluid is compressed at the highest pressure.
      <br/>
      In such a case, the slider 56 the inside of the guide channel 33b is positioned as shown by the solid line in FIG. 5c. When the ignition plug (not shown) is ignited, the compressed mixed fluid is fired in the chamber C1, thus the blade 32a returns quickly to the original position as shown in FIG. 4c. In such a case, the slider 56 inside the guide channel 33b moves from the position shown by the solid line in FIG. 5c to the position shown by the phantom line in FIG. 5d. Such compression and explosion strokes are performed in the third chamber C3, which is positioned diametrically opposite to the first chamber C1, at the same time.
    </p>
    <p num="39">
      When the first rotating blade 32a moves in a direction from the first fixed blade 25a to the second fixed blade 25b as described above, the combustion gases are discharged from the first chamber C1 to the atmosphere through the first exhaust port 42a, while the mixed fluid in the mating chamber C1' are compressed.
      <br/>
      That is, each cylinder of the housing assembly comprises a pair of variable chambers, for example, the two chambers C1 and C1'. When each chamber, for example, the chamber C1, performs an expansion stroke, the mating chamber, for example, the chamber C1', performs a compression stroke.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the engine of this invention, with four cylinders, has eight combustion chambers, so the useful combustion volume of the engine is doubled.
      <br/>
      This doubles working efficiency per unit volume of the engine.
    </p>
