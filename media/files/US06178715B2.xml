    <heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="1">
      This invention relates to mortarless retaining wall constructions which may be vertical, set back in whole or in part with regard to the vertical, or set forward in whole or in part with regard to the vertical.
      <br/>
      Standardized block constructions are also provided which enable one to obtain the aforementioned retaining wall structures and combinations thereof.
      <br/>
      This invention finds particular application to a unique standardized block construction and a corner block construction as well as a wedge-shaped construction which allows the user to build retaining walls of various configurations as will be described hereinafter.
    </p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">
      Retaining walls are well known.
      <br/>
      These structures may be built including mortar, or as introduced more recently constructed from mortarless construction.
      <br/>
      The mortarless construction includes building blocks of predetermined design which may be stacked course upon course as a wall including a cap stone.
      <br/>
      Most blocks provided in the prior art are limited in the number of degrees of freedom that they provide the professional landscaper when constructing retaining walls.
      <br/>
      This invention obviates this limitation.
    </p>
    <p num="3">
      Many block constructions provide for only the ability of the contractor to build a set back retaining wall.
      <br/>
      Within a retaining wall system, it would be beneficial to be able to produce wall structures which are set back and or set forward in some portions thereof and vertical in other portions thereof.
      <br/>
      This is heretofore unknown.
      <br/>
      For example, when preparing a set of steps which traverse an incline, when blocks that provide only set back wall structures are provided, the length of the steps which traverse the incline will increase and diverge by necessity.
      <br/>
      That is to say, the lengths of each step will gradually increase as one moves up the incline course upon course.
      <br/>
      It would be advantageous to be able to provide a standard block which may not only be set back when appropriate, but which also may be stacked vertically when appropriate, such as when creating steps to traverse an incline to thereby not alter the step lengths since this may not always be desirable or esthetically pleasing.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      Further, quite often, cribbing is provided to reinforce or tie back a retaining wall back into the incline around which the retaining wall is being built.
      <br/>
      Although this is desirable, it is not always cost effective.
      <br/>
      It would be desirable therefore to reduce the expense by providing a retaining wall which does not require the necessity of cribbing structures being assembled.
      <br/>
      There exists therefore a need for a simple, easy to use number of components which an installer may install course upon course to prepare a reasonable number of attractive options for the building owner without limiting the number of alternatives for which recommendations may be made by the landscaper.
    </p>
    <p num="5">Examples of the prior retaining wall structures and the blocks therefore may be found in the following patents.</p>
    <p num="6">
      U.S. Pat. No. 4,490,075 corresponding to Canadian Patent 1,182,295, and U.S. Pat. No. 4,815,897 corresponding to Canadian Patent 1,204,296 teach the use of a retaining wall system as best seen in FIG. 2 which includes a number of blocks formed into a cribbing as seen in FIG. 3 in order to provide lateral and longitudinal reinforcement of the cribbing as the wall is built.
      <br/>
      Such a construction is, needless to say, very expensive and at times unnecessary.
      <br/>
      Further, referring to FIG. 8, there is illustrated and described a block construction which includes an automatic offset when like blocks are stacked one upon the other.
      <br/>
      The only way for the block can be utilized for retaining walls is if the wall is set back from the vertical.
      <br/>
      The ability to build vertical walls using the same block is described in the claims of U.S. Pat. No. 4,815,897 wherein the blocks are reversed 180 degrees as the courses progress.
      <br/>
      The block does not include the provision of building a retaining wall which may be set forward from the vertical in whole or in part.
      <br/>
      Further unless a structure as seen in FIG. 2 is built including a massive amount of cribbing, there is no tying in of the blocks longitudinally.
      <br/>
      This severely limits the imagination of the landscaper when constructing a retaining wall.
      <br/>
      There therefore exists a need for an improvement to provide more esthetically pleasing retaining walls while using a standard lead configured block.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      Canadian Patent 941,626 issued Feb. 12, 1974 to Risi describes a retaining wall system including projections and grooves which interfit.
      <br/>
      However, unlike the inventions which followed this patent, the projections and recesses are vertically in alignment as opposed to being offset with one another with respect to a vertical axis.
      <br/>
      In all cases, the projections and recesses fit.
      <br/>
      That is to say, there is no ability to stack the courses in any other manner than as provided for with the interfitting of the recesses with the projections.

    <p num="8">
      U.S. Pat. No. 4,860,505 and the equivalent Canadian 1,307,675 to Bender describes a construction block which includes a multiplicity of recesses on the bottom thereof and at least two projections being provided on the top thereof.
      <br/>
      The distance from the face of the block to the first projection is at least equivalent to the distance from the face of the block to the second recess.
      <br/>
      These blocks may therefore be stacked course upon course only in a manner which is best seen in FIG. 5, that is the building of a set back or offset retaining wall.
      <br/>
      No provision is made within this structure to provide longitudinal reinforcement for adjacent blocks as the construction of the wall progresses.

      <br/>
      This may be seen readily in FIG. 5 and FIG. 6.
      <br/>
      It may be said that no flat surface is provided on the top or bottom of the blocks between the ends of the block used in constructing such a retaining wall.
      <br/>
      Further, the structure may or may not be advantageous to a landscaper in that a multitude of blocks of various shapes and sizes as best seen in FIG. 11 is necessary to provide various forms to the retaining wall structures.
      <br/>
      The blocks may be stacked set back, exemplified by FIG. 11 or alternatively as best seen in FIG. 17 in a vertical wall construction.
      <br/>
      Further the individual blocks may be set forward as seen in FIG. 15. Again, as with the prior structures, there is no description of longitudinal reinforcing of adjacent blocks when preparing a wall structure as blocks are stacked course upon course.

      The standardized block construction may be used in forming a retaining wall system in combination with a corner block, said corner block including a top and bottom and having disposed proximate the top and bottom a predetermined number of grooves on both said top and bottom which may engage with one or more of the first, second, third, fourth, fifth and sixth abutment means of said block when a retaining wall is formed.
      <br/>
      In one embodiment, said corner block may be formed to include grooves extending in two directions to tie in with adjacent blocks utilizing supplementary keys provided to assemble the retaining wall.
      <br/>
      In another embodiment, a provision for the grooves is provided with the bottom and top of said corner block, and one of the grooves is extended by the installer during installation.
    </p>
    <p num="68">
      It is important to note that the installer plays a very important role in constructing the retaining wall.
      <br/>
      That is to say that there is no automatic provision when placing course upon course for a predisposition of the blocks.
      <br/>
      The blocks must be set or placed at the desired one of three positions as described above when forming a retaining wall.
      <br/>
      This is unlike the prior art in that specifically the Risi teachings refer to automatic offsetting of the retaining wall when his grooves and ridges interfit.
      <br/>
      Risi does provide for the reversing of the block, that is to say reversing of the faces of the block, when forming a retaining wall to allow for the substantial vertical forming of the retaining wall.
      <br/>
      The present invention, however, does not require for the excessive manhandling of the blocks required such as when blocks are reversed.
      <br/>
      The installer merely needs to position and place the block in its desired position with the abutments in the first, second and/or third positions and combinations thereof.
      <br/>
      This is heretofore unknown.
      <br/>
      The blocks may be formed by any known molding process or block forming process.
      <br/>
      Preferably, said blocks are hollow to improve the handling ability of the block.
      <br/>
      Many colours may be utilized, for example, granite or limestone colours may be utilized to provide an esthetically pleasing retaining wall.
      <br/>
      Typically the keys utilized with the retaining wall may be preferably hollow and formed from a plastic, nylon or other flexible material in an extruded rod-like form which may be cut off as desired by the installer.
      <br/>
      Further, said keys may be formed to be in one piece and providing substantially a right-angled key, including two elements extending substantially 90 (degree)  to one another.
    </p>
    <p num="69">
      According to yet another aspect of the invention, there is provided a block construction for forming a retaining wall, said block comprising a top and a bottom and having disposed proximate the top a plurality of projections, and a plurality of key ways, said block having disposed proximate the bottom thereof a plurality of grooves and/or a plurality of keyways, said keyways for receiving keys in use, wherein when a retaining wall is formed from said standard block, the projections engage with said recesses to provide resistance to shear laterally in relation to the block when stacked course upon course, and wherein the insertion of keys in the key ways in use when a retaining wall is formed and blocks are stacked course upon course provides interconnection of adjacent like blocks on the same course and thereby improves the longitudinal strength of the retaining wall, said block in use providing both lateral and longitudinal reinforcements.
      <br/>
      In a preferred embodiment, said standardized block may be constructed with projections disposed on the top thereof and recesses disposed on the bottom thereof wherein the addition of the key-receiving key ways adds to the ability of the block to be formed into retaining walls which improves the longitudinal stability of the retaining wall so formed by tying adjacent blocks together as a course is stacked upon course.
      <br/>
      In another embodiment, the block only includes one projection and one recess flanked by the key-receiving key ways disposed one on each side of the recess and the projection.
      <br/>
      In this manner, adjacent blocks may be tied in longitudinally with respect to one another as course is stacked upon course when forming the retaining wall.
    </p>
    <p num="70">
      According to yet another aspect of the invention, there is provided a standard block utilized to form a mortarless retaining wall, said block comprising a top and a bottom, two sides and two exposed faces proximate ends of said block, said top of said block having disposed therewith two centrally-disposed projections separated by a space, said space being disposed proximate the center of said block, said top of said block having provided therewith a third and a fourth projection each being spaced toward the faces of said block from said two centrally disposed projections, said two centrally disposed projections and each of said third and fourth projection having disposed there between a second space, the top of the block proximate said second spaces each having provided therewith a first and second key-receiving key way disposed between the two centrally disposed projections and each of said third and fourth projections, the bottom of said block having disposed therewith a centrally disposed recess having a dimension slightly greater than the distance between the distal edges of said two centrally disposed projections, said first recess including a key-receiving key way extending from the bottom of the block, said bottom of said block having disposed therewith and spaced from the centrally disposed recess a pair of recesses each bounded by a first leading and second lagging abutment, and third leading and fourth lagging abutment and for selective engagement respectively with the second and third projection disposed with the top of like blocks, the pair of recesses having disposed therewith a key-receiving key way extending from the bottom of the block, preferably said projections, key-receiving key ways and recesses extending preferably, substantially from side to side of said block, and in another embodiment only in part from side to side of said block (for example, when the block is formed in a wedge shape the projections may be discrete projections extending between the sides of said blocks with said recesses and said key-receiving key ways extending substantially the full side to side dimension of said blocks), the centrally disposed recess and each recess flanking the centrally disposed recess having disposed there between a portion of the bottom of the block also acting as an abutment, wherein when the block is placed course upon course with like blocks to form a retaining wall, the installer may manually place the blocks course upon course with the pair of centrally-disposed projections substantially fitting within the centrally-disposed recess of a superior course of like blocks to thereby provide a first mode within which the blocks may be stacked and thereby forming a substantially vertical retaining wall, wherein the installer may manually place the blocks course upon course so that the space between the centrally disposed projections interfits with the portion of the bottom of the block between said centrally-disposed recess and the first recess and simultaneously, a leading edge of said projections spaced from said pair of centrally-disposed projections abuts with the leading abutments of said pair of recesses flanking said centrally-disposed recess proximate the bottom of said block, and thereby providing resistance to a horizontal shear force applied upon the blocks when the retaining wall is constructed, whereat at the second mode for installation of said blocks when placed course upon course for forming a retaining wall, a substantially uniformly set back retaining wall is constructed, wherein an installer may place like blocks course upon course in a third configuration wherein the space between the two centrally-disposed projections interfits with the portion of the bottom of the block disposed between the centrally disposed recess and the second recess whereat simultaneously a lagging edge of said projections spaced from said pair of centrally-disposed projections abuts the lagging abutment walls of said recesses of said block, whereat the installer when placing blocks course upon course in forming a retaining wall will form in a third mode of installation a substantially set forward retaining wall to the vertical, preferably said key-receiving key ways having installed therewith when like blocks are placed one upon another, course upon course, keys for tying in adjacent blocks and providing longitudinal reinforcement of the retaining wall, wherein the installer may form a wall in three modes in whole or in part using the standard block, namely a substantially, vertically disposed retaining wall, a substantially set back retaining wall from the vertical, and/or a substantially set forward retaining wall from the vertical, or any combination of courses exemplifying the available modes thereof.
      <br/>
      In a preferred embodiment, a first course may extend from a second inferior course in a substantially vertical relation, whereat a third course may extend from said second course in a substantially set-back relation for the vertical courses of the wall being constructed and wherein a fourth course may extend substantially as a set forward course in relation to the vertical for the wall being formed.
      <br/>
      In a preferred embodiment, the standardized block may be hollow.
      <br/>
      Although it is preferred to include the key-receiving key ways proximate the top and bottom of the block as predefined above, it is not absolutely essentially to do so in all embodiments of the block.
      <br/>
      However, in leaving out the key ways, the various forms of the retaining walls may be provided, however, without longitudinal tying in of adjacent blocks to one another.
      <br/>
      Typically, the blocks are of constant cross section near the faces thereof but are not of constant cross section from the first and second recesses of the block structure inward.
      <br/>
      The third and fourth projections do not interfit with the second and third recesses of the block.
      <br/>
      It is important that the leading and lagging edges of the projections engage the leading and lagging abutment walls of the recesses, so that there is simultaneous resistance to horizontal shearing forces at each of the projections and abutment walls thereby providing a greater surface area to resist such horizontal shearing force.
    </p>
    <p num="71">In a preferred embodiment, any of the aforementioned blocks may be constructed in a dual-block module, that is to say, each module includes two blocks joined together proximate one face thereof and comprising substantial mirror images of one another, each block having disposed proximate the opposite faces which are not joined a removable section to present either a smooth face for the block when the removable section is retained, or a rough split face for the block when the removable section is removed, preferably the block including a scoreline prior to the removable section to enable an installer to remove that section as required.</p>

      In another embodiment, the top and/or bottoms of the corner block may further comprise discrete recesses and projections which are mirror images of one another so as to provide for the interfitting of the blocks and enhance the ability of the corner block to resist horizontal sheer forces, preferably said interfitting being substantially when a left-corner block is stacked upon a like left-corner block when the bottom of the block includes only key-receiving key ways or alternatively with a like block set at 90 (degree)  to the original plane of extension of the first block to enable the recesses and pockets to align so as to interfit when a left-hand block is inverted upon a right-hand block and turned at 90 (degree)  to the extension of the right-hand block.
      <br/>
      A retaining wall may therefore be so formed.

      Referring now to FIGS. 1 through 8, there is illustrated a standard block 10 for building a retaining wall.
      <br/>
      The block 10 includes a top 14, a bottom 15, two sides 10a and 10b.
      <br/>
      The block 10 also includes a split face 11 and a smooth face 12.
      <br/>
      The smooth face 12 is disposed at one end of said block 10, and the rough split face is disposed proximate the other end of the block 10.
      <br/>
      A removable portion 12a is separated from the main body of the block by a scoreline 13.
      <br/>
      Should it be desired to have two split faces exposed to an observer, the installer merely cuts along the scoreline 13 to create the second split face 13a.
      <br/>
      The top of the block 10 includes central projections 17 and 18 separated by a space.
      <br/>
      Each projection 17 and 18 has a leading face 17a and 18a, and a lagging face 17b and 18b respectively.
      <br/>
      The top of the block 14 includes spaced at a distance from the projections 17 and 18 a projection 16 and a projection 19.
      <br/>
      The projection 16 is at the end of the block near the split face 11 while the projection 19 is disposed near the face of the block 12.
      <br/>
      Both projections have a leading edge 16a and 19a, and a lagging edge 16b and 19b respectively.
      <br/>
      Key ways 14a and 14b are disposed between the projections 18 and 19, and the projections 16 and 17, respectively.
      <br/>
      These key ways are for receiving a key substantially as shown in FIGS. 19 and 19A or the like.
    </p>
    <p num="88">
      The bottom 15 of the block 10 has provided therewith as best seen in FIG. 3 a centrally disposed channel 21 and two slightly larger channels 20 and 22 spaced therefrom.
      <br/>
      The channel 21 has provided therewith a leading stop or abutment 21a and a lagging stop or abutment 21b.
      <br/>
      The channels 20 and 22 also have provided therewith leading and lagging abutments 20a and 22a, and 20b and 22b, respectively.
      <br/>
      Each of the channels 20, 21 and 22 has a key-receiving key way 15a, 15c and 15b provided therewith.
      <br/>
      Each of the key ways is for mating engagement with the key ways 14a and 14b disposed proximate the top of the block and for interconnecting with adjacent like blocks 10 within the same course of the retaining wall, which will be described hereinafter.
    </p>
    <p num="89">
      The block 10 therefore may be manufactured as a dual block module substantially as shown in FIG. 3 including all of the aforementioned ridges, channels and key-receiving key ways provided therewith and manufactured as mirror images of one another.
      <br/>
      The module 5 therefore includes two blocks 10 which may be cut along the cutting face 11 to provide two blocks 10 with split faces 11.
      <br/>
      A section 12a is provided with each block which may be cut substantially as shown in FIG. 4 to also provide a split face at 12b once the dual block module is separated into its two components.
      <br/>
      Each of the components are identical and may be placed one upon the other to provide courses when assembling a retaining wall system.
      <br/>
      One of the main aspects of the invention is that the aforementioned block may be placed course upon course in defining a retaining wall which may be set forward from the vertical substantially as shown in FIG. 5, or which may be set back from the vertical substantially as shown in FIG. 6, or which may be substantially vertical as shown in FIG. 7.
      <br/>
      In order to accomplish these various wall formations, the installer of the retaining wall will manually place each block course upon course in the desired configuration and pattern.
      <br/>
      Various patterns may be achieved utilizing the standard block as will be described in relation to FIGS. 27 through 33b.
    </p>
    <p num="90">
      Referring now to FIG. 7, in order to construct a retaining wall having a substantially vertical form, the installer would place the centrally-disposed channel 21 of the superior block course over the projections 17 and 18.
      <br/>
      In this position, the walls 21a and 21b of the channel 21 act as abutments and engage with the lagging wall 17b of the projection 17 and the leading wall 18a of the projection 18.
      <br/>
      A key may then be installed within the key way 15c, for example the key of FIG. 19. The projections therefore engaging the abutments of the recess 21 provides the resistance to horizontal shearing forces upon the wall.
      <br/>
      The key inserted within channel 21 provides for longitudinal reinforcement along the length of the wall by tying in adjacent blocks to one another and to the inferior course as best seen in relation to FIG. 26.
    </p>
    <p num="91">
      If it is desired to create a retaining wall having a set-back configuration, as seen in FIG. 6, the installer manually places the superior course block 10 upon the inferior course block 10 so that the leading abutment 20a engages the leading wall of the projection 19 at 19a.
      <br/>
      In this position, the leading wall 17a of projection 17, and the leading wall of 16a of projection 16, will abut the leading abutments 21a and 22a of channels 21 and 22 respectively.
      <br/>
      Concurrently, the space between the projections 18 and 17 will have contained therein in this position the portion of the bottom of the block 10 between the lagging wall 20b of channel 20 and the leading wall 21a of the channel 21.
      <br/>
      The contact of all of these walls and abutments will therefore provide for the resistance to horizontal shearing forces of the superior and inferior courses.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, the key ways 14a and 14b and/or the key ways 15a, 15b and 15c may have selectively provided therewith keys of a design substantially as shown in FIG. 19 or 19A or the like in order to tie in blocks adjacent to one another and to inferior and superior courses in a set-back wall configuration substantially as seen in FIG. 27. The key therefore provides the longitudinal tying in and bolstering of the courses of the retaining wall and the prevention of separation of the blocks in the longitudinal direction.
    </p>
    <p num="92">
      Similarly, should a landscaper require a wall which may be set forward from the vertical, or at least a portion of the wall which may be set forward from the vertical as seen in FIG. 32, the installer is merely to place the block in a position so that the lagging abutment 22b of the channel 22 on the superior course abuts with the lagging wall 16b of the projection 16.
      <br/>
      In this position, the lagging wall 19b of projection 19 will abut to the lagging abutment 20b of channel 20 while the lagging abutment 21b of channel 21 will abut with the lagging wall 18b of projection 18.
      <br/>
      In this regard, the space defined between projections 18 and 17 will capture the portion of the bottom disposed between the lagging abutment 21b and the leading abutment 22a of channels 21 and 22, respectively.
      <br/>
      In this position therefore, the block is maintained in a stable position being set forward from the vertical in a predetermined number of courses or for the entire wall, if necessary.
      <br/>
      As previously discussed, the key-receiving key ways 15a, 15b, 15c, 14a and 14b may include keys substantially as shown in FIG. 19 or 19A or the like to further bolster the retaining wall in the longitudinal direction and for the superior and inferior courses.
    </p>
    <p num="93">
      Referring now to FIGS. 9 through 16B, there is illustrated a corner block 30.
      <br/>
      The corner block 30 includes a top 31a, a bottom 31b, two faces 30a and 30c, and two sides 30b and 30d.
      <br/>
      The corner block 30 may therefore be formed in a dual block module formed substantially as seen in FIGS. 11, 11A and 11B which are joined along the scoreline 30b and which are separated thereat if desired to form two distinct blocks, each block being similar in design and being a left and a right-hand block.
      <br/>
      The bottoms of the blocks 31b include a multiplicity of recesses 35a through 35f which in combination with keys substantially as seen in FIGS. 19 and 19A or the like are used to inter-engage the corners when stacked one upon the other in various patterns and further to tie into adjacent blocks which are not corners.
    </p>
    <p num="94">
      The block of FIG. 9 includes recesses 3, 5 and 6 for receiving projections 1, 2 and 4 from like blocks when stacked one course upon another if desired.
      <br/>
      The top of the block includes recesses 32a through 32f extending from face 30c toward the face 30a.
      <br/>
      The top of the block 30 also has provided therewith smaller channels or recesses 33a through 33c which may be extended by an installer substantially as seen in FIG. 22 in order to provide longitudinal reinforcing of the retaining wall and tying in of the corner block with adjacent blocks, preferably blocks as seen in FIG. 1, and the superior and inferior corner blocks.
    </p>
    <p num="95">
      Alternative block constructions may also be used to interfit with the corner 30 providing that the block construction includes key-receiving key ways disposed on the top and bottom of the blocks.
      <br/>
      This will be described hereinafter in relation to FIGS. 34-37.
    </p>
    <p num="96">
      If desired, the block of FIG. 9 may present two smooth faces at 30a and 30d.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, if the installer removes the removable segment including the face 30a, he will expose a split face as seen in FIG. 22 depending on the esthetic look desired by the installer.
      <br/>
      It will be noted that the left-hand and right-hand blocks of FIG. 9 are identical with the exception of the location of the projections 1, 2 and 4 in the recesses 3, 5 and 6.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the left- and right-hand corner blocks 30 are to be utilized as preferably a right- and a left-hand corner.
      <br/>
      However, this may not always be the case as only one particular block may be available, for example when individual blocks are formed rather than the dual block modules.
      <br/>
      The blocks of FIG. 9 therefore are reversible and may be utilized in the fashion best seen in FIGS. 14, 15 and 16.
      <br/>
      If only one of the style of blocks is available, then the block may be reversed and rotated 90 (degree)  in order to align the projections 1, 2 and 4 with the pockets 3, 5 and 6 in order to provide the necessary corner constructions if desired.
      <br/>
      However, this is not recommended as the best alternative.
      <br/>
      The blocks illustrated in FIGS. 9A and 9B are not reversible.
      <br/>
      As best seen in FIG. 22, when a corner block is installed with a standard block, the channels 33a, for example, of the right-hand block shown in FIG. 11 may be extended using a masonry's chisel C and a mallet M to align the channel which is extended from 33a with the key-receiving key way 14b of the standard block 10.
      <br/>
      In this manner, a key K2 may be placed in the recess 32b and the recess 33a extending from the corner block to tie in adjacent blocks 10 and to inferior and superior courses.
      <br/>
      The recess 14b is tied in, for example, when it is desired to create a square vertical retaining wall.
      <br/>
      When the next course is therefore installed, the block 30 at the corner thereof is reversed substantially as seen in FIG. 32 so that the channels 35b and 35c align with the projections 1, 2 and 4 of the top of the inferior course block while the superior corner block 30 is rotated 90 (degree)  from the inferior course block.
      <br/>
      For FIG. 22, the smooth faces 30a have been removed by the installer.
    </p>
    <p num="97">
      Referring now to FIGS. 9A, 9B, 10A, 10B, 11A, 11B, 12A, 12B, 13A, 13B, 14A, 14B, 15A, 15B, 16A and 16B, there is illustrated a left corner block 30l as best seen in FIG. 9A and 10A, and a right corner block 30r as best seen in FIGS. 9B and 10B.
      <br/>
      These two blocks 30l and 30r may be manufactured from a double-block module as discussed previously.
      <br/>
      For example, the left-hand block 30l may be manufactured in a double block module as best seen in FIG. 11B wherein the block 30l of FIG. 9A would be the bottom block of the double module of FIG. 11B. Further, the block of FIG. 9B may be the bottom block 30r of FIG. 11A being a right-hand block.
      <br/>
      Each of the modules has provided therewith a score line 30b which is utilized by the installer to separate the two blocks of the double-block module.
      <br/>
      Therefore, as seen in FIG. 9A and 9B, the face 30b presents a split face resulting from separating the two blocks constituting the double-block module.
      <br/>
      As best seen in FIG. 11A, the block 30l constitutes a left-hand corner, and the block 30r constitutes a right-hand corner.
      <br/>
      This block is normally manufactured with a rough face 30x and 30y.
      <br/>
      The right-hand corner block 30r therefore as shown in FIG. 9B includes two rough faces 30b and 30x which may be presented to the outside of the finished wall as best seen in relation to FIG. 16A. The corner block 30l of FIG. 9A therefore includes laterally-extending ridges 7a through 7e and longitudinally-extending ridges 8a through 8c.
      <br/>
      Key-receiving keyways 9a and 9b are provided at right angles to one another in order to interconnect the corner block 30l with adjacent standard blocks as previously described with keys as best seen in FIG. 19A. The blocks 30r of FIGS. 9B and 10B include laterally-extending ridges 7f, 7g, 7h, 7i and 7j, and longitudinally-extending ridges 8d, 8e and 8f.
      <br/>
      A pair of keyways 9d and 9c extend at 90 (degree)  to one another adjacent one end and one corner of the corner block.
      <br/>
      Disposed upon the bottom of the block 30l and 30r are longitudinally-extending grooves 35a through 35f for receipt of either the ridges 7a through 7e for block 30l or ridges 7f through 7j for block 30r.
      <br/>
      If the corner block of the superior course is rotated at 90 (degree) , the corner block of the inferior course, as best seen in FIGS. 16A and 16B, then the ridges 7a through 7e and 7f through 7j respectively will be aligned with the grooves 35a through 35f located on the bottom 31b of the corner blocks 30l and 30r respectively.
      <br/>
      The ridges 8a through 8c and 8d through 8f, and the keyways 9a and 9b of block 30l and 9c and 9d of block 30r are utilized as best seen in relation to FIGS. 22 and 25 respectively to tie into the standard blocks as determined by the installer in conjunction with key-receiving keyways 9a and 9b, and 9c and 9d to tie the adjacent standard blocks, as previously described and illustrated in relation to FIGS. 1 and 2, to the corners.
      <br/>
      Therefore, block 30l will be utilized as a left-hand corner with standard adjacent blocks being disposed adjacent the sides 30b and 30c to enable keys, not shown but illustrated in relation to FIGS. 19 and 19A to be inserted within the grooves 9a and 9b and extending beyond the boundaries of the block 30l to standard blocks and the grooves established therein.
      <br/>
      The block 30l as seen in FIG. 11A and 9A illustrate two corner blocks having a split face 30x and 30y which blocks are not interchangeable.
      <br/>
      The block 30l will be used for providing blocks adjacent to side 30c and 30b so as to provide a corner which ties into blocks disposed on the left-hand side 30c and the top side 30b.
      <br/>
      The bottom block 30r is designed to tie into adjacent blocks on the bottom side 30d and the side 30c.
      <br/>
      The blocks of FIG. 11B are designed with a smooth face 30a and a score line 31 and provide the same corners for the installer in an alternative double-block module.
    </p>
    <p num="98">
      Referring to FIGS. 12A and 13A, such a design for a corner block is meant to allow for tying in to blocks disposed adjacent the faces 30c and 30d in a manner as previously described.
      <br/>
      FIG. 12B and 13B are provided with a smooth face 30c to tie into blocks acjacent the ends 30a and 30b.
      <br/>
      Therefore, considering a wall which extends totally around the perimeter of a home, Applicant has provided the ability to tie into left-hand side corners and right-hand side corners at both the extremities of the wall so formed.
    </p>
    <p num="99">
      Referring now to FIGS. 14A, 14B, 15A, 15B, 16A and 16B, there is illustrated a manner in which a superior course of blocks will be fit upon an inferior course of blocks, both representing a corner, similar in respects to FIGS. 14, 15 and 16 with the exception that very positive ridges 7a through 7e, and 7f through 7j are provided to interfit with grooves 35a through 35f in a manner best seen in relation to FIG. 22 and described in relation thereto.
      <br/>
      Referring now to FIG. 22 in relation to FIGS. 14A, 15A and 16A, the corner 30' is to be set upon corner block 30", wherein the inferior course block with regard to the ridges 7f through 7j are inserted within the grooves 35a through 35f of the superior course block 30'. The standard blocks 14 of FIG. 22 therefore will therefore interfit with the appropriate corner block.
      <br/>
      With reference to FIG. 22, the appropriate corner block would be that of FIG. 9A with the split face being exposed by separating the portion 30a at score line 31.
      <br/>
      In this respect, the grooves 9a and 9b would be alignable with compatible keyway-receiving grooves 14b of the standard blocks 14 prior to installing the superior course.
      <br/>
      The superior course corner block 30 would be rotated at 90 (degree)  utilizing the appropriate corner block designed to tie into the adjacent blocks 14.
      <br/>
      Specifically, with reference to FIG. 22 and the embodiments of FIGS. 9A through 19A respectively the installer is not required to extend any of the key-receiving keyways as is the case in describing blocks with respect to FIGS. 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 and 16.
      <br/>
      As can be readily seen from FIG. 14B and 15B, the smooth faces are exposed when providing the corner joint in a similar manner to that of FIGS. 14A, 15A and 16A.
      <br/>
      With respect to defining the corner and interfitting it with the balance of the wall assembly, referring to FIG. 25, such a corner assembly is provided which readily juts out from the main plane of the wall defined by the standard blocks.
      <br/>
      Otherwise the construction is identical.
    </p>
    <p num="100">
      Referring now to FIGS. 17 and 18, there is illustrated a wedge-shaped block similar in all respects to the configuration of the block illustrated in FIG. 1 with the exception that the side walls converge.
      <br/>
      A removable portion 42a therefore is provided with the wedge-shaped block 40 having a removable section 42a which is separated from the body of the block at 43.
      <br/>
      This block may be formed in a dual block module joined at 46 and separable thereat.
      <br/>
      The bottoms of the blocks are illustrated in FIG. 17 or in channels 40, 41 and 42 are illustrated with the details including the leading and lagging walls 40a, 40b, 41a, 41b, 42a and 42b, respectively, for each of the channels 40, 41 and 42 with key-receiving key ways 45a, 45c and 45b disposed there between.
      <br/>
      The structure is therefore identical in side view to that seen in relation to FIG. 3.
      <br/>
      Particularly, this wedge-shaped block may be used when it is desired to create an arc A, as best seen in FIG. 18, wherein like blocks 40 are set adjacent to one another along the arc, with or without the removable section 42a.
      <br/>
      In this embodiment, small key sections of approximately 3" may be utilized to join blocks adjacent to one another.
      <br/>
      It is difficult to provide one entire continuous key length when traversing an arc.
    </p>
    <p num="101">
      Referring now to FIGS. 19 and 19A, there are illustrated keys K1 having a diamond shape, and K2 having a hexagonal shape, and having indeterminate length L and having a hollow H therein.
      <br/>
      The keys may be cut into pre desired lengths in order to assemble the retaining wall system of the preferred embodiments.
      <br/>
      Any particular key such as a plastic cylinder would also be suitable.
      <br/>
      It is not necessary for the cylinder-shaped key to be hollow.
    </p>
    <p num="102">
      Referring now to FIGS. 20 and 21, there is provided another form of a wedge-shaped block 50 having projections centrally disposed 55, 56 and 57 utilized for the same purpose as the projections 17 and 18 of FIG. 1 flanked by projections 54, 53, 59 and 58 equivalent in most respects to the projections 19 and 16 shown in FIG. 1.
      <br/>
      For example, the projections 59 and 58 together provide for the functioning of the equivalent of projection 16 while the projections 53 and 54 together provide the equivalent of projection 19 in cross section.
      <br/>
      Obviously, the projections are not as strong as continuous projections extending from side to side of the block construction.
      <br/>
      However, because of the need to traverse an arc as seen in FIG. 18, it is necessary to provide for the angular movements of the blocks when laying overlapping course upon overlapping courses which are staggered with respect to one another in a typical brick-laying pattern.
      <br/>
      In order to accomplish this task and still have the projections extend within the channels 60, 61 and 62 having leading and lagging edges 60a, 61a, 62a, 60b, 61b and 62b, respectively, for it to function in most respects as described in relation to FIGS. 5 through 8, it is necessary to provide for the shorter projections.
      <br/>
      Those skilled in the art will appreciate that when an arc is set in a retaining wall, the projections cannot be continuous.
    </p>
    <p num="103">
      Referring now to FIGS. 22, 23, 24 and 25, there is illustrated a corner connection for a retaining wall including a superior course and an inferior course wherein the corners 30 illustrated in FIG. 9 are tied into adjacent blocks 10 by the extension of the channel 33a as previously mentioned utilizing a concrete chisel C and mallet M to allow the insertion of a key K2 within key ways 32b, 33a of the corner block 30 and 14b of the standard block 10.
      <br/>
      The corners illustrated in FIGS. 9A and 9B require no extension of preferred channels.
      <br/>
      In this way, the corners 30 are longitudinally tied into the adjacent block 10 and to inferior and superior courses to reinforce the retaining wall.
      <br/>
      The superior course is then installed on the inferior course so that the channels and projections as previously described in relation to FIG. 7 and FIG. 15 are completed.
      <br/>
      The projections 16, 17, 18 and 19 therefore are located and capture the previously described abutments within the channels found on the bottom of the blocks.
      <br/>
      The same is true for the recesses and abutments found on the top of the block of corner block 30 as previously described.
      <br/>
      In engaging the projections with the channel abutments and the keys with the key ways with the recesses and key-receiving key ways, the wall so formed is rigidified laterally and longitudinally.
      <br/>
      The wall of FIG. 22 therefore illustrates cut faces 30b and 31 for the corner block to coincide with the split faces 11 of the standard block configuration.
      <br/>
      The removable extensions having the smooth face 30a have been removed from the corner block 30.
      <br/>
      This is unlike the presentation of FIG. 23 wherein the identical assembly is presented with the exception that smooth faces 30a and 30d are presented at the corners in relation to the rough split faces 11 of the standard blocks.
      <br/>
      In order to accomplish this purpose, a channel extending the recess 33a is prepared by the installer to align with the space between the projections 17 and 18 of the standard block and/or key-receiving recess 14b depending on the groove being aligned therewith of the corner block.
      <br/>
      The example shown is not the only alternative, but in this case, the channel 32b is aligned with the key way of 14b and the channel 33a is also aligned with the same key way to provide for the insertion of K2, the key in the X and Y direction, to reinforce the retaining wall longitudinally as the superior course is placed upon the inferior course.
      <br/>
      Otherwise, the joint is identical to that described in relation to FIG. 22.
    </p>
    <p num="104">
      Referring to FIG. 24, the smooth faces 30a are advanced forward of the plane of the retaining wall in one dimension or the other for the superior and the inferior courses.
      <br/>
      In this manner, a unique corner is prepared and presented.
      <br/>
      The joint of FIG. 24, however, is identical to that illustrated in relation to FIG. 22 and the creation of same is identical other than the fact that the smooth face extends out from the edge of the corner block 30.
    </p>
    <p num="105">
      Referring now to FIG. 25, a capping block 70 is presented having a smooth top and a predetermined number of key-receiving recesses 71 proximate the bottom thereof which are utilized in an identical manner when joining the capping with the corners 30 and the standard blocks 10.
      <br/>
      The only exception is that the block 10X in the configuration of FIG. 25 may be of less width than the block standard 10 in order to compensate for the length of the corner block including the smooth face.
      <br/>
      Otherwise, the creation of the joint using the key K2 substantially at a right angle is identical when inserted within the grooves found on the bottom of the cap stone 70 at 71 to receive the portion X with the second portion of the capping stone extending in the Y direction for receiving the element Y of the key K2.
      <br/>
      Otherwise, the assembly of the wall is very similar to those previously described other than the recessed window-like block presentation at 10'.
    </p>
    <p num="106">
      Referring now to FIG. 26, it may be seen that wall sections W1, W2 and W3 of a retaining wall may be formed using the standard blocks 10 which provide for the alignment of the space between projections 17 and 18 with the key-receiving key way 14a to allow for the key K3 substantially shown in FIG. 19, or the equivalent thereto, to be inserted therein for each course, C1, C2 and C3 to provide for the interlocking longitudinally of adjacent blocks as well as the interlocking of the superior and inferior courses.
      <br/>
      The keys also assist in the interlocking of the superior with the inferior courses C1, C2 and C3.
      <br/>
      The wall portion W2, as is apparent, is recessed from the plane of the walls W1 and W3 to provide an esthetically-pleasing wall construction.
      <br/>
      The alternative, of course, on the other side of the wall is to have an advanced section of the wall presented to the building owner.
      <br/>
      This is done in an identical manner.
    </p>
    <p num="107">
      Referring now to FIG. 27, there is illustrated courses C1, C2, C3 and capping stone 70 assembled in a manner consistent with the embodiment described in relation to FIG. 6.
      <br/>
      The courses C1, C2 and C3 are therefore set back in relation to the vertical from one another as described with the capping stone capping off the top of the wall section in a manner similar to that described in relation to FIG. 25. Further, in FIG. 28, the retaining wall is formed of courses C1, C2 and C3 which are substantially vertical in disposition to one another and are assembled substantially identically as described in relation to FIG. 7.
      <br/>
      Otherwise, the structure is identical to FIG. 27 in manufacture.
      <br/>
      Another embodiment of the invention in relation to a vertical wall may be the presentation of the corners staggered and advanced substantially as shown in FIG. 29 with the corners 30 advanced from the plane of the wall of the blocks 10.
    </p>
    <p num="108">
      A more complicated version therefore of the wall structures seen, for example in FIG. 28, would be the providing of walls such as at FIG. 28 having there between disposed a multitude of steps formed from capping stones 70 and standard block modules 10 with the exception of the corners provided as illustrated.
      <br/>
      In providing the steps within a garden, for example of FIG. 30, it will be noted that the steps do not diverge in length as the wall traverses the incline since the wall can be made in this particular section of the wall from a vertical wall, and it is not required that the wall be set back whatsoever.
      <br/>
      If setting back is desired, this can be accomplished using the same components.
      <br/>
      The only difference would be the use of the components by the installer.
    </p>
    <p num="109">
      Referring now to FIGS. 31, 32, 33A and 33B, there is presented various wall forms which are possible with combinations of the standard block arrangement utilizing the key K3 or the like.
      <br/>
      In wall W4, window like panels are recessed within the retaining wall.
      <br/>
      In wall W5, a predetermined number of blocks are advanced from the plane of the retaining wall.
      <br/>
      In FIG. 33A blocks are advanced and recessed from the plane of the wall substantially as shown creating a wall W6.
      <br/>
      In FIG. 33B, another embodiment illustrating wall W7 with a portion of two courses alternating as advanced and being in the plane of the wall is presented.
      <br/>
      All of these wall formations and many others as shown in FIGS. 27 through 33B are possible because of the ability of the installer to utilize the features described in relation to FIG. 26 with the key to advance or recess a block or courses of blocks or just one particular array of a course of blocks and still tie in the array being advanced or recessed with adjacent blocks to rigidify the block being advanced or recessed and provide a wall having both lateral and longitudinal stability.
    </p>
    <p num="110">
      Referring now to FIGS. 34 and 35, there is shown an improvement for a block by Risi which original block was described in the background of the invention.
      <br/>
      The block 100 includes a projection 101 and a recess 102 which matingly engage and interfit.
      <br/>
      The improvement includes the provision on the top and bottom of said block with key-receiving recesses 120, 121, 110 and 111 which allow for tying in of adjacent blocks substantially as illustrated in FIG. 35 wherein courses C10, C11 and C12 are tied in with adjacent blocks and further with inferior and superior courses utilizing keys K3 to interconnect said blocks with said recesses 110, 111, 120 and 121.
      <br/>
      In providing the improvement to these blocks of FIGS. 34 and 35, it is possible to construct some of the various embodiments previously described and illustrated in relation to a vertical and a set-back wall construction and specifically in conjunction with the aforementioned corner blocks.
    </p>
    <p num="111">
      Referring now to FIGS. 36 and 37, there is illustrated improvements for the block 200 by Bender which original block structure was described above in the background of the invention.
      <br/>
      The block has two projections 210 and 211 disposed therewith for stacking in courses with like blocks including a bottom having a multitude of recesses 220 disposed therewith.
      <br/>
      The improvement includes the provision of key-receiving recesses 230 and 231 on the top of the block which may be utilized with the recesses 220 proximate the bottom of the block which are not utilized for capturing the projections 210 and 211 so as to tie into the superior and inferior courses as best seen in FIG. 37 and as well to tie in longitudinally any adjacent blocks with one another as a retaining wall is built.
    </p>
    <p num="112">A provision for tying in the retaining walls formed above to the surrounding soil may be accomplished by trapping netting such as Geogrid or mesh between courses of the wall as required by the installation without providing the other limitations found therein.</p>
