    <heading>TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
    <p num="1">This invention relates generally to a composition comprising cellulose ester and alkylpolyglycosides (APG) or a mixture of APG and polyether glycol, and, optionally, cellulose.</p>
    <p num="2">
      This invention also relates to paper comprising cellulose fibers, cellulose ester fibers, and APG or a mixture of APG and polyether glycol.
      <br/>
      The process of incorporating APG or the mixture of APG and polyether glycol into the paper comprising cellulose ester fibers and cellulose fibers and to calendaring of such paper is also set forth.
    </p>
    <p num="3">This invention also relates to cellulose ester containing synthetic paper coated or plasticized with APG or a mixture of APG and polyether glycol as a thermoplastic sheet and as medical paper.</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="4">Paper has been used in applications such as bags, wrapping paper, printing paper, photographic paper, and the like.</p>
    <p num="5">In general, specific applications require specific modifications in the paper making process to prepare a paper for that specific application.</p>
    <p num="6">
      For example, different additives are typically added to the fibers to improve the dry and wet strength of paper.
      <br/>
      Other substances are sometimes applied to the surface of the paper to impart water or grease proofing, or to render the paper bondable to other substrates such as a polyethylene plastic sheet.
    </p>
    <p num="7">In this context, it has been desirable to have paper whose composition would allow the sheets of the paper to have both good wet and dry strength.</p>
    <p num="8">
      It has also been desirable to have the same paper sheet exhibit barrier properties or be bondable to another substrate without coating the sheet with another substance such as an adhesive.
      <br/>
      Attempts have been made in the past to construct such a paper sheet.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      Charles Snead and Ralph Peters in U.S. Pat. No. 2,976,205 describe the preparation of webs and sheets from cellulose esters.
      <br/>
      In this patent, the inventors disclose the use of 100% cellulose esters, primarily cellulose acetate, to form sheets.
      <br/>
      The sheets optionally could be treated with a plasticizer.
      <br/>
      Upon treatment with heat and pressure, the sheet became a transparent, homogenous sheet.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      Similarly, Griggs et al., in U.S. Pat. No. 3,103,462, disclose a method for improving the strength characteristics of paper by including greater than 75% of a partially acetylated cellulose fiber and sizing the paper with classical sizing agents.
      <br/>
      Plasticizers were not considered, however.
    </p>
    <p num="11">The methods disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 2,976,205 and U.S. Pat. No. 3,103,462 revolve around the "wet" process of classical paper making.</p>
    <p num="12">
      In U.S. Pat. No. 3,261,899, Coates describes a "dry" process for making synthetic fiber paper which involves web carding cellulose acetate stable fiber that has a length greater than 0.5 inch.
      <br/>
      Optionally, the paper can contain natural fiber such as wood pulp.
      <br/>
      In the method of U.S. Pat. No. 3,261,899, the web is sprayed with a plasticizer and calendared in the temperature range of 65 (degree)  C. to 190 (degree)  C.
    </p>
    <p num="13">
      All of the methods described in U.S. Pat. No. 2,976,205, U.S. Pat. No. 3,103,462, and U.S. Pat. No. 3,261,899 have similar problems.
      <br/>
      All of these inventions disclose very high levels of cellulose acetate which raises the costs of these synthetic papers relative to papers utilized in the market place.
    </p>
    <p num="14">
      The high level of cellulose acetate makes these "synthetic" papers more of a moldable plastic sheet rather than a classical paper sheet.
      <br/>
      That is, these sheets are not really suitable for conventional paper applications.

      The inventors of these previous inventions desired to take advantage of the high cellulose acetate content of these papers and, recognizing the need for plasticization of cellulose acetate, attempted to add plasticizer to the synthetic papers.
      <br/>
      Unfortunately, the classical cellulose acetate plasticizers described in U.S. Pat. No. 2,976,205 and U.S. Pat. No. 3,261,899 are not convenient for use in classical paper making operations.

      <br/>
      This combination gives improved softness and strength.

      In the medical packaging field, medical paper used in medical packaging serves a very important function.
      <br/>
      The medical paper acts as a filter to remove particulates and microorganisms, while at the same time allowing gas and water vapor to enter and escape during the sterilization process.
    </p>
    <p num="28">
      A medical instrument, for example a syringe, is placed in a plastic tray (typically polyethylene or modified polyester) and then the paper is sealed over the opening of the tray.
      <br/>
      The paper is pattern coated with an adhesive in such a manner that spaces on the sheet are not coated.
      <br/>
      This allows the paper to be adhered to the plastic while allowing gases to enter and leave the medical packaging during sterilization.
    </p>
    <p num="29">Because one side of the paper must be easily printed upon, the adhesive is typically applied to one side of the sheet and this application is made in a post paper making step.</p>
    <p num="30">
      In considering this process, it is evident that there is a need for an additive which can be added directly to paper during the paper making process as an aqueous based system.

      The process of applying APG solutions or the mixture of APG and polyether glycol to the cellulose/cellulose ester paper sheets can be done in several ways.
      <br/>
      The process can include calendaring the APG or the mixture of APG and polyether glycol plasticize/coated cellulose/cellulose ester paper sheet.

    <p num="42">The utilization of calendaring, for example, applying some type of thermal treatment to a sheet of paper comprising cellulose, cellulose ester, and APG or a mixture of APG and polyether glycol by passing the sheet of paper through a heated roller, provides a more uniform coating.</p>

      One process for applying an APG solution or a mixture of APG and polyether glycol comprises incorporating APG in a solution of a cellulose ester having from 1 to 10 carbon atoms and precipitating the cellulose ester into a nonsolvent so that a portion of the APG is mixed with the cellulose ester solid.
      <br/>
      The resultant solid can then be spun into fibers.
    </p>
    <p num="45">Another process comprises washing a cellulose ester solid having from 1 to 10 carbon atoms with APG or a mixture of APG and polyether glycol so that a portion of the APG or a mixture of APG and polyether glycol is taken up by the cellulose ester solid.</p>

    <p num="47">A fourth process comprises passing a cellulose ester fiber having from 1 to 10 carbon atoms through a caustic solution to surface hydrolyze the cellulose ester fiber, and passing the surface hydrolyzed cellulose ester fiber through a solution of APG or a mixture of APG and polyether glycol so that APG or a mixture of APG and polyether glycol is absorbed onto the cellulose ester fiber.</p>

      FIG. 3 is a schematic view of one possible arrangement or interaction of APG with cellulose and cellulose ester polymer chains. In this figure, the vertical, oval-shaped elements 2 represent the hydrophilic carbohydrate portion of the APG.

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="51">According to the present invention, a composition comprising (a) about 0% to 98% cellulose, (b) about 1% to 99% of an ester of cellulose having from 1 to 10 carbon atoms, and (c) about 1% to 40% of an alkylpolyglycoside (APG) or (d) about 1% to 40% of a mixture of alkylpolyglycoside and polyether glycol PEG is useful in the preparation of papers having particular utility, such as heat sealable medical paper.</p>
    <p num="52">The APG can be delivered by a number of processes including applying to a preformed sheet that is wet or dry, incorporation into the cellulose ester prior to spinning of the fibers through precipitation of a solution containing both the cellulose ester and APG, or by passing the cellulose ester fiber through a solution containing the APG.</p>
    <p num="53">The cellulose esters of the present invention generally comprise repeating units of the following structure:  (Chemical Structure image '1' not included in text)</p>
    <p num="54">
      wherein R1, R2, and R3 are selected independently from the group consisting of hydrogen or straight or branched chain alkanoyl having from 1 to 10 carbon atoms.
      <br/>
      An alkanoyl is an ester group.
    </p>
    <p num="55">
      The cellulose ester used in formulating the composition can be a cellulose triester or a secondary cellulose ester.
      <br/>
      Examples of secondary cellulose esters include cellulose acetate, cellulose acetate propionate, and cellulose acetate butyrate.
      <br/>
      These cellulose esters are described in U.S. Pat. No. 1,698,049, U.S. Pat. No. 1,683,347, U.S. Pat. No. 1,880,808, U.S. Pat. No. 1,880,560, U.S. Pat. No. 1,984,147, U.S. Pat. No. 2,129,052 and U.S. Pat. No. 3,617,201, incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.
    </p>
    <p num="56">The cellulose esters useful in the present invention can be prepared using techniques known in the art or are commercially available, for example, from Eastman Chemical Products, Inc., Kingsport, Tenn., USA.</p>
    <p num="57">
      The cellulose esters useful in the present invention have at least 20 anhydroglucose rings, typically between 50 and 5,000 anhydroglucose rings, and preferably from about 75 to about 500 anhydroglucose rings.
      <br/>
      Also, such polymers typically have an inherent viscosity (IV) of about 0.2 to about 3.0 deciliters/gram, preferably about 1.0 to about 1.5, as measured at a temperature of 25 (degree)  C. for a 0.25 gram sample in 50 mL of a 60/40 by weight solution of phenol/tetrachloroethane.
    </p>
    <p num="58">In addition, the degree of substitution per anhydroglucose ring (referred to as DS/AGU) of the cellulose esters ranges from about 1.0 to about 3 0 (slashed zero)</p>
    <p num="59">
      Preferred esters of cellulose include cellulose acetate (CA), cellulose propionate (CP), cellulose butyrate (CB), cellulose acetate propionate (CAP), cellulose acetate butyrate (CAB), cellulose propionate butyrate (CPB), and the like.
      <br/>
      The most preferred ester of cellulose is cellulose acetate having an average DS/AGU of about 1.7 to 2.6.
    </p>
    <p num="60">The APG preferred for this invention has the following general formula:  (Chemical Structure image '2' not included in text)</p>
    <p num="61">where R is selected from the group consisting of alkyl, alkylphenyl, hydroxyalkyl, hydroxyalkylphenyl, and mixtures thereof, in which the alkyl groups contain from about 4 to about 18, preferably from about 6 to about 14, carbon atoms; n is 2 to 4, preferably 2, y is from about 0 to about 10, preferably 0; x is from about 1 to about 10, preferably from about 1.3 to about 2.5; and wherein Z is H or is an alkyl with 1-20 carbon atoms, preferably 1.</p>
    <p num="62">
      The glycosyl is derived from carbohydrates or polysaccharides.
      <br/>
      The most preferred carbohydrates or polysaccharides are glucose, starch, or cellulose.
    </p>
    <p num="63">To prepare these compounds, an alcohol is reacted with a carbohydrate or polysaccharide to form the glycoside in which the point of attachment is at position 1.</p>
    <p num="64">Additional glycosyl units can then be attached between their 1-position and the preceding glycosyl units 2-, 3-, 4, and/or 6-positions. optionally, the remaining positions having free hydroxyl groups can be substituted with C1 to C10 esters or with ethers or polyglycol ethers.</p>
    <p num="65">
      The polyether glycols useful for the present invention have the following general formula:
      <br/>
      (Cn (R)H2n-1 O)y OR2
    </p>
    <p num="66">
      where R is selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, methyl, and ethyl, n is 2 to 4, preferably 2, and y is from about 2 to about 25, preferably about 4 to about 15, and R2 is hydrogen, methyl, ethyl, propyl, butyl, acetyl, propionyl, butryl, or phenyl, preferably hydrogen or methyl.
      <br/>
      Examples of such polyether glycols are polyethylene glycol 400 or polypropylene glycol 200 where 400 or 200 refer to the average molecular weight.
    </p>
    <p num="67">
      The APG utilized in the present invention is a non-ionic surfactant, and is characterized by having a long carbohydrate portion (or area) and an alkyl portion (or area).
      <br/>
      This is illustrated in FIG. 4.
      <br/>
      The long carbohydrate portion gives the APG its hydrophilicity.
      <br/>
      The alkyl portion gives the APG its hydrophobicity.
    </p>
    <p num="68">
      Without wishing to be bound by theory, it is believed that the APG or portions of the APG utilized according to the present invention can position itself between the polymer chains of a polymer, allowing the chains of the polymer to slip back and forth.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the APG according to the present invention weakens the interaction between the polymer chains of the polymer.
      <br/>
      In this sense, the APG functions as a classical plasticizer.
      <br/>
      FIG. 3 illustrates this aspect of the present invention.
    </p>
    <p num="69">
      In another sense, the APG can act as a coating.
      <br/>
      When APG or a mixture of APG and polyether glycol is applied to paper in an aqueous solution during the paper making process, it is thought that the APG anchors itself into the paper, and presents its hydrophobic portion as a barrier to liquids at the surface of the paper.
      <br/>
      That is, the carbohydrate portion prefers to associate with the cellulose acetate fibers and the cellulose fibers in the paper, while the hydrophobic alkyl group prefers orientation away from the hydrophilic polysaccharide, toward the paper surface, thus forming a barrier to water, at the surface of the paper.
      <br/>
      In this way, the APG functions as a coating.
    </p>
    <p num="70">
      Since the APG functions as both a plasticizer and coating as discussed above, the terms "plasticizer" and "coating" are used interchangeably in the present invention.
      <br/>
      This is a unique aspect of the present invention.
    </p>
    <p num="71">The paper making cellulose fibers useful for the present invention are typically those derived from wood pulp or from cotton linters.</p>
    <p num="72">Wood pulps considered for this invention include chemical pulps such as those obtained from Kraft, sulfite, and sulfate pulps, as well as mechanical pulps which include, as examples, groundwood, thermomechanical pulp, and chemically modified thermomechanical pulp.</p>
    <p num="73">
      Also applicable to the present invention are fibers derived from recycled paper.
      <br/>
      Of these fibers, chemically modified softwood is preferred.
      <br/>
      Mixtures of these cellulose fibers can be utilized.
    </p>
    <p num="74">A broad composition range exists in the present invention when using APG as the plasticizer/coating.</p>
    <p num="75">
      In the broadest sense, the composition according to one embodiment of the present invention comprises (a) about 0% to 98% cellulose, (b) about 1% to 99% of an ester of cellulose having from 1 to 10 carbon atoms, and (c) about 1% to 40% of an alkylpolyglycoside, said percentages based on the total weight of components (a), (b), and (c).
      <br/>
      A more preferred composition comprises (a) about 10% to 85% cellulose, (b) about 5% to 80% of an ester of cellulose having from 1 to 10 carbon atoms, and (c) about 10% to 30% of an alkylpolyglycoside, said percentages based on the total weight of components (a), (b) and (c).
      <br/>
      The most preferred composition comprises from (a) about 60% to 85% cellulose, (b) about 40% to 5% of an ester of cellulose having from 1 to 10 carbon atoms, and (c) about 10% to 20% of an alkylpolyglycoside, said percentages based on the total weight of components (a), (b) and (c).

    <p num="79">The most preferred composition comprises from (a) about 60% to 85% cellulose, (b) about 40% to 5% of an ester of cellulose having from 1 to 10 carbon atoms, and (c) about 10% to 20% of a mixture of an alkylpolyglycoside and polyether glycol, said percentages based on the total weight of components (a), (b) and (c).</p>
    <p num="80">
      With regard to the APG and polyether glycol mixture as the plasticizer/coating, the APG is present from about 2% to about 98% based upon the total weight of the APG and polyether glycol mixture, and the polyether glycol is present from about 2% to about 98% based upon the total weight of the APG and polyether glycol mixture.
      <br/>
      A more preferred mixture composition is from about 30% to about 70% APG based upon the total weight of the APG and polyether glycol mixture, and from about 30% to about 70% polyether glycol based upon the total weight of the APG and polyether glycol mixture.
      <br/>
      The most preferred mixture composition is from about 40% to about 60% APG based upon the total weight of the APG and polyether glycol mixture and from about 40% to about 60% polyether glycol based upon the total weight of the APG and polyether glycol mixture.

    <p num="81">
      Physical mixing of the components can be accomplished in a number of ways such as mixing in the appropriate solvent (for example, acetone), followed by film casting and evaporation of the solvent.
      <br/>
      Such solvent mixed materials can be thermally processed in a second step as part of the mixing process.
    </p>
    <p num="82">
      Physical mixing of the components can also be accomplished by thermally compounding.
      <br/>
      The most preferred method is by thermally compounding in an apparatus such as a torque remodeler, a single screw extruder, or a twin screw extruder.
    </p>
    <p num="83">
      The mixtures can be converted to films by a number of methods known to those skilled in the art.
      <br/>
      For example, films can be formed by compression molding as described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,427,614, by melt extrusion as described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,880,592, by melt blowing, or by other similar methods.
      <br/>
      The mixtures can also be used for injection molding or for extrusion to form shaped articles.
    </p>
    <p num="84">In the cases where the compositions are obtained by solvent casting or by thermally compounding, it is preferred that the APG or the mixture of APG and polyether glycol contain substantially no water.</p>
    <p num="85">However, in those cases where the APG or the mixture of APG and polyether glycol are part of a paper sheet where a solvent is utilized in delivering the APG or the mixture of APG and polyether glycol to the sheet, water is the preferred solvent.</p>
    <p num="86">
      The concentration of APG or the mixture of APG and polyether glycol in the aqueous solutions is from about 1% to 75% in the aqueous solution based upon the amount of APG or based upon the amount of the mixture of APG and polyether glycol present.
      <br/>
      A more preferred range is from about 3% to about 50%, and the most preferred range is from about 1 to about 30% in the aqueous solution.
    </p>
    <p num="87">The paper making cellulose ester fibers useful for the present invention can be obtained by a number of different processes.</p>
    <p num="88">
      Fibers can be made by spinning reaction solutions of the cellulose ester or by spinning a solution of the cellulose ester from a volatile solvent.
      <br/>
      Examples of, but not limited to, reaction solutions include those obtained at the end of acid catalyzed aqueous hydrolysis of a cellulose acetate.
      <br/>
      Examples of, but not limited to, volatile spinning solvents are acetone, acetone/water, methylene chloride, or methylene chloride/MeOH.

    <p num="102">As is evident from the aforementioned disclosure, paper compositions with APG or with the APG and polyether glycol mixture can be prepared in a number of ways.</p>
    <p num="103">The inventors of the present invention have discovered that the initial distribution of the APG or of the APG and polyether glycol mixture is dependent upon how the APG or the APG and polyether glycol mixture is applied.</p>
    <p num="104">
      Surprisingly, the inventors of the present invention have discovered that when the APG or the APG and polyether glycol mixture is applied to one side of the paper, the APG essentially remains on that side of the sheet.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, the APG or the APG and polyether glycol mixture for the most part remains, or predominately remains, or mostly remains on that side of the sheet.
      <br/>
      Subsequent calendaring, however, changes the distribution of the APG in the paper sheet.
      <br/>
      According to this aspect of the present invention, the APG is acting as a coating which can advantageously be applied to one side of the paper.
      <br/>
      The resultant product from this aspect of the present invention is very different from the materials obtained when the APG is included directly into the fiber prior to the paper making process or into a resin prior to making a shaped object discussed earlier.
      <br/>
      In these cases, the APG acts as a plasticizer.
    </p>
    <p num="105">
      As discussed earlier, the plasticizer utilized in the present invention is referred to as a coating as well as a plasticizer because it does plasticize the cellulose ester, but when applied on one side of the paper, it stays on one side of the paper, and provides barrier properties.
      <br/>
      Without wishing to be bound or limited by theory, it is believed that the carbohydrate portion (or area) of the APG associates with the cellulose ester fibers and cellulose fibers, while the hydrophobic alkyl portion (or area) prefers to orientate to the surface of the paper thereby forming a barrier to liquids, including water.
      <br/>
      However, the APG does interact with the cellulose ester fibers and the cellulose fibers, thus reducing polymer chain interactions.
      <br/>
      The word "associates" utilized herein refers to interaction between APG and the cellulose ester and cellulose by one or more mechanisms, e.g., by hydrogen bonding or dipole-dipole interaction.
      <br/>
      The APG or APG/PEG mixture (the APG and polyether glycol mixture) as utilized in the present invention is therefore characterized as a plasticizer with coating like characteristics.
    </p>
    <p num="106">Because of this unique aspect of the present invention, the term plasticizer and coating are used interchangeably (plasticizer/coating) in the present invention.</p>
    <p num="107">Accordingly, the novelty in terms of the heat sealable paper of the present invention is that when APG or a mixture of APG and polyether glycol is applied in aqueous solution on one side of the sheet, it stays on that side of the sheet.</p>
    <p num="108">
      Therefore, APG or a mixture of APG and polyether glycol is applied without destroying the porosity of the paper, that is, air is able to go back and forth through the heat sealable paper, while maintaining the heat sealable properties of the paper.
      <br/>
      This is unique because, unless very special dot matrix coating techniques are utilized, usually coatings that are applied to a sheet of paper bond the fibers together, and destroy the pores present in the sheet so that air cannot go back and forth through the paper.
      <br/>
      As a result, although such a paper may have a barrier to water, the paper does not maintain its porosity.
    </p>
    <p num="109">
      In heat sealable medical paper, it is important that the paper maintain its porosity in order to ensure that the medical ingredient placed in it is properly sterilized, using, for example, ethylene oxide or steam.
      <br/>
      The paper must allow moisture vapors to go back and forth, since heat and steam are generated during the sterilization process, while keeping the ethylene oxide inside, and at the same time, the paper must be able to repel liquids.
    </p>
    <p num="110">
      For the heat sealable medical paper according to the present invention, a more preferred composition comprises 20-40% cellulose acetate and 3-10% APG or a 3-10% mixture of APG/PEG, the balance being cellulose fibers and paper additive.
      <br/>
      A most preferred composition comprises 25-35% cellulose acetate and 4-6% APG or a 4-6% mixture of APG and polyether glycol, the balance being cellulose fibers and paper additive.
      <br/>
      If too much cellulose acetate is present, the strength of the paper decreases.
      <br/>
      If too little cellulose acetate is present, porosity is not achieved.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, these are the most preferred values for maintaining heat sealability, porosity, and strength of the paper.

      This example illustrates that in the absence of cellulose acetate, the strength (break stress) and stiffness (Young's modulus) of the paper decreases upon coating with APG, but if cellulose acetate is incorporated into the paper sheet, the strength and stiffness of the paper increases, particularly under wet conditions, when coated with APG.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, when no cellulose acetate is present in the paper (top 2 examples of each of the above tables), the Young's modulus and Break Stress decreases when APG is added, but when the cellulose acetate is present (bottom 2 examples of each of the above tables), the Young's modulus and Break Stress actually increases when APG is added.

      This example additionally illustrates that although there is some decrease in strength and stiffness associated with increasing the amount of cellulose acetate in the paper, substantial amounts of cellulose acetate can be added to the paper while maintaining good physical properties when the paper is coated with APG.

      This example also shows that increasing cellulose acetate content in the paper significantly decreases the porosity of the paper.

      The paper was dried and the surface was examined in a Hitachi S4500 field emission gun based scanning electron microscope.

      <br/>
      Uncoated paper side displays numerous fibrils and strands.
      <br/>
      The APG coated side is easily recognized because the APG obscures and covers the fine fibril structures.
      <br/>
      Cross sectional views of the coated and uncoated paper surfaces shows the APG to be restricted to the surface to which it was applied.

    <p num="145">
      This example illustrates that the APG can be delivered to only one side of the paper, allowing for one sided coating.
      <br/>
      The APG does not diffuse to the other side of the paper.
      <br/>
      The carbohydrate portion of the APG anchors itself to the cellulose fibers and cellulose ester fibers, preventing diffusion of the APG to the other side.
