      An eyepiece lens for a display image observation device is disclosed that has only six lens elements with refractive power, in the order from the eye side, as follows: a first lens group G1 formed of two lens elements L1 and L2, both of positive refractive power, with the lens element L1 on the eye side being of positive meniscus shape with its convex surface on the eye side; a second lens group G2 formed of two lens elements L3 and L4 which are either separated by air or cemented together, the first of the lens elements on the eye side (i.e., L3) having negative refractive power and the other having positive refractive power; and a third lens group G3 formed of two lens elements which are either separated by air or cemented together, the first of the lens elements on the eye side (i.e., L5) having positive refractive power and the other having negative refractive power.
      <br/>
      Preferably, one of the surfaces of the lens elements in the first lens group G1 is aspherical, and specified conditions are satisfied in order to achieve favorable aberration correction in an eyepiece lens that is compact.

    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="1">
      Heretofore, various types of display image observation devices have been conventionally known which display a desired image from an image display element, such as a liquid crystal display panel, and which enlarge the image using an eyepiece.
      <br/>
      An example of such an eyepiece used in a display image observation device is the eyepiece disclosed in Japanese Laid-Open Patent Application H6-308396.
      <br/>
      This eyepiece makes it possible to obtain a flat and clear image throughout the periphery of the field while using only a few lens elements by employing an aspherical surface and by making the object surface (i.e., the source image) a curved surface.
      <br/>
      However, this eyepiece is limited to cases where the range for favorably correcting the aberration designates an entrance pupil diameter of less than 4 mm (since the brightest lens disclosed has an FNo. of 3.7).
    </p>
    <p num="2">
      The pupil diameter of most people is in the range from 3 to 4 mm and, when observing in a motionless environment, using a lens with an FNo. of 3.7 gives satisfactory results.
      <br/>
      However, when the observation is accompanied by vibrations or other motion, such as while the observer is riding in an automobile or while walking, the entrance pupil of the eyepiece and the pupil of the observer can be temporarily offset as much as 3 to 5 mm due to the vibrations or other motion.
      <br/>
      Therefore, if the various aberrations are not favorably corrected for an entrance pupil of several tens of millimeters, then the viewed image will deteriorate to an inferior image quality as a result of the vibrations or other motions.
      <br/>
      This breakdown in the image quality causes favorable observation under such conditions to become difficult.
    </p>
    <heading>BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="3">
      The present invention is an eyepiece for a display image observation device used when enlarging and observing images displayed in an image display device.
      <br/>
      More specifically, the present invention relates to an eyepiece for observing an image of an object that is formed at an image display surface of an image intensifier which intensifies low-level light collected by an object lens of a night vision device.
      <br/>
      A first object of the present invention is to provide an eyepiece for a display image observation device that is light in weight.
      <br/>
      A second object of the invention is to provide such an eyepiece that is also compact.
      <br/>
      A third object of the invention is to provide such an eyepiece that enables viewing with high image quality even during unfavorable viewing conditions, such as when the observer is riding in a vehicle or while walking.

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
    <p num="5">
      The eyepiece for a display image observation device of the present invention includes, in the order from the eye side, a first lens group G1 formed of two lens elements L1 and L2, with both lens elements being of positive refractive power; a second lens group G2 formed either of two lens elements or of a cemented lens having two lens elements, where one lens element L3 has negative refractive power and the other L4 has positive refractive power; and a third lens group G3 formed of either two lens elements or a cemented lens having two lens elements, where one lens element L5 has positive refractive power and the other L6 has negative refractive power.
      <br/>
      Further, the lens element L1 nearest the eye is of a positive meniscus shape with its convex surface on the eye side; and at least one surface of the lens elements L1 and L2 of the first lens group G1 is aspherical.
    </p>
    <p num="6">Further, it is preferred that the eyepiece of the invention satisfy the following Conditions (1)-(4).  (Equation image '1' not included in text)</p>
    <p num="7">where</p>
    <p num="8">
      f is the focal distance of the eyepiece lens,
      <br/>
      f1 is the focal distance of the first lens group,
      <br/>
      f2 is the focal distance of the second lens group,
      <br/>
      f3 is the focal distance of the third lens group, and
      <br/>
      Ri is the radius of curvature of the image display surface.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      In general, to hold the lens outer diameter small, it is beneficial not to diverge the light rays while holding positive power on the lens element at the eye side (i.e, the observer side) of the first lens group; however, with the configuration of lens elements as described above, the light rays may be favorably deflected, especially by making this lens element in the shape of a positive meniscus with its convex surface on the eye side.
      <br/>
      On the other band, since spherical aberration and coma are generated when the light ray is deflected so drastically, the configuration described above suppresses the generation of the spherical aberration and coma by employing an aspherical lens surface as a lens surface of the first lens group.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      Further, Condition (1) above regulates the focal distance of the first lens group.
      <br/>
      When falling below the lower limit, the power of the first lens group becomes too strong, thereby making it impossible to correct the spherical aberration and the coma; on the other hand, when exceeding the upper limit, the power of the first lens group becomes too weak, thereby causing the light rays to diverge (since the angle of deflection has become too small).
      <br/>
      Hence, as the outer diameter of the second lens group must be increased, compactness is lost.
    </p>
    <p num="11">
      In addition, Condition (2) above regulates the focal distance of the second lens group.
      <br/>
      When falling below the lower limit, the negative power of the second lens group becomes too strong thereby causing an increase in the positive power of the first lens group and the third lens group.
      <br/>
      Hence, correction of the spherical aberration, coma, and distortion becomes difficult.
      <br/>
      On the other hand, when exceeding the upper limit, the positive power of the second lens group becomes too strong, making correction of the spherical aberration and coma difficult.
    </p>
    <p num="12">
      Furthermore, Condition (3) above regulates the focal distance of the third lens group.
      <br/>
      When falling below the lower limit, the positive power of the third lens group becomes too strong, thereby increasing the negative distortion.
      <br/>
      On the other hand, when exceeding the upper limit, the positive power of the first lens group and the second lens group tends to increase, which makes correction of the spherical aberration and coma difficult.
    </p>
    <p num="13">
      In addition, Condition (4) above regulates the radius of curvature of the image display surface.
      <br/>
      Since an eyepiece serves basically as a positive lens, the image curves as a concave surface.
      <br/>
      The amount of curvature is closely related to the power of the eyepiece, and in this way, the curvature of the image surface is regulated.
      <br/>
      Therefore, when exceeding the upper limit of Condition (4), the image curvature increases.
      <br/>
      More specifically, the focus slippage at the ends of the field of view becomes too large.
    </p>
    <p num="14">Hereinafter, various embodiments of the invention will be described with reference to the drawing figures.</p>

      FIG. 1 shows the basic lens element configuration of Embodiment 1.
      <br/>
      As shown in FIG. 1, the eyepiece of this embodiment is formed of only 6 lens elements L1 through L6, is for observing an image on the image display surface 2 of the image intensifier, and is an eyepiece of a night vision optical device.
      <br/>
      The specific lens element configuration is, in order from the eye side: a first lens group G1 formed of a first lens element L1 and a second lens element L2, each of which are of positive meniscus shape with their convex surfaces on the eye side; a second lens group G2 formed of a third lens element L3 of negative meniscus shape with its convex surface on the eye side and a fourth lens element L4 that is biconvex; and a third lens group G3 formed of a fifth lens element L5 that is biconvex and cemented to a sixth lens element L6 of a negative meniscus shape with its concave surface on the eye side.
      <br/>
      The eye-side surface of the second lens element L2 is aspherical.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, the eyepiece is designed so as to satisfy the above Conditions (1)-(4).
    </p>
    <p num="17">According to the eyepiece for a display image observation device composed in this manner, the object image formed on the image display surface 2 of the image intensifier by way of an object lens is led to the pupil position 1 by way of the lens groups 1, 2 and 3 where it is once again formed on the retina of the eye.</p>

      Moreover, the spherical aberration, astigmatism, and distortion that occur in Embodiments 1-4 are shown in FIGS. 5, 7, 9 and 11 respectively.
      <br/>
      Further, the coma for Embodiments 1-4 is shown in FIGS. 6, 8, 10 and 12, respectively.
      <br/>
      In each of FIGS. 6, 8, 10, and 12, coma in the tangential direction T is illustrated by the four curves in the left column, and coma in the sagittal direction S is illustrated by the three curves in the right column.
      <br/>
      The curves from top to bottom represent the coma at different half-field angles  OMEGA  (i.e., different picture angles), with the angle  OMEGA  as indicated.
      <br/>
      For indicating coma in the sagittal direction S, only three curves are given, since the sagittal coma on-axis (i.e., at  OMEGA =0.0) is identical to the tangential coma T on axis.
