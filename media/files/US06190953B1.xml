      Field of the Invention
    </p>
    <p num="3">
      The present invention relates generally to a connector/connecting technique for semiconductor devices.
      <br/>
      More specifically, the invention relates to a connector/connecting technique for use in a semiconductor memory required to be highly integrated.
    </p>
    <p num="4">2. Description of the Background Art</p>
    <p num="5">
      Referring now to the accompanying drawings, the prior art will be described.
      <br/>
      In recent years, with the miniaturization of semiconductor chips, a local interconnect has beenused for connecting a gate electrode of a transistor to a diffusion layer.
      <br/>
      In particular, the local interconnect is effectively used for a semiconductor memory (SRAM) required to behighly integrated.
    </p>
    <p num="6">Referring to FIGS. 1A through 1D, a conventional method for forming a local interconnect and a contact will be described below.</p>
    <p num="7">
      First, as shown in FIG. 1A, a gate insulating film 3 and a gate electrode 4 are stacked on a semiconductor substrate 1.
      <br/>
      Then, as shown in FIG. 1B, the gate electrode 4 is used as a mask to form diffusion layers 2 serving as sources or drains on the semiconductor substrate 1 using the ion implantation.
      <br/>
      Subsequently, an interlayer insulating film 7 of silicon dioxide is formed on the whole surface using the CVD method.
      <br/>
      The interlayer insulating film 7 is deposited so as to have an elevation higher than that of the gate electrode 4.
      <br/>
      Then, as shown in FIG. 1C, the upper surface of the gate electrode 4 and the upper surfaces of one of the diffusion layers 2 are exposed toform an opening 7A by means of the photo-etching.
      <br/>
      Thereafter, as shown in FIG. 1D, an electrode material 9 is deposited on the inner surface of the opening 7A and the upper surface of the interlayer insulating film 7 using the sputtering or the like.

      Then, as shown in FIG. 2A, the electrode material 9 on the interlayer insulating film 7 is removed by the CMP method.
      <br/>
      In the opening 7A, the gate electrode 4 is electrically connected to one of the diffusion layers 2 to form a local interconnect LIC.
      <br/>
      Subsequently, as shown in FIG. 2B, an interlayer insulating film 8 of silicon dioxide is deposited on the whole surface by the CVD method.

      Thereafter, as shown in FIG. 2C, a contact hole 10A is formed in the interlayer insulating films 7 and 8 so as to reach the diffusion layer 2 by means of the photo-etching.

      Subsequently, an electrode material 10 is embedded in the contact hole 10A, and an upper layer wiring 11 is formed thereon.

    <p num="9">
      In a case where a local interconnect LIC and a contact CT are formed by the above described conventional method, the contact CT is formed (see FIGS. 2B through 2C) after the local interconnect LIC is formed (see FIGS. 1A through 2A).
      <br/>
      That is, the local interconnect structure and the contact are separately produced.
      <br/>
      Therefore, there is a problem in that the number of steps is high to complicate the manufacturing method and to increase the costs.

    </p>
    <heading>DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
    <p num="15">Referring now to the accompanying drawings, the first preferred embodiment of the present invention will be described in detail below.</p>
    <p num="16">As shown in FIG. 3A, a gate insulating film 3 of silicon dioxide having a thickness of about 10 nm and a gate electrode 4 of a polysilicon having a thickness of about 100 nm are stacked on a p-type semiconductor substrate 1.</p>
    <p num="17">
      As shown in FIG. 3B, the gate electrode 4 is used as a mask to implant impurities (boron, phosphorus or the like) into the surface of the p-type semiconductor substrate 1 to form diffusion layers 2 serving as sources or drains.
      <br/>
      By these steps, a MOS transistor is formed.
      <br/>
      Moreover, an interlayer insulating film 5 of silicon dioxide having a thickness of tens nm is formed so as to cover the whole surface by the CVD method.
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      As shown in FIG. 3C, using the photo-etching, openings 50 and 60 are simultaneously formed by patterning the interlayer insulating film 5.
      <br/>
      The opening 50 is used for forming a local interconnect LIC, and the opening 60 is used for forming a contact CT.
      <br/>
      While the contact CT has been formed after forming the local interconnect LIC in the conventional method, the opening 50 used for forming the local interconnect and the opening 60 used for forming the contact are simultaneously formed according to the present invention.
      <br/>
      This is one of the features of the present invention.
    </p>
    <p num="19">As shown in FIG. 3D, an electrode material (e.g., tungsten W) 18 is formed on the upper surface of the interlayer insulating film 5 by means of the sputtering so that the openings 50 and 60 are completely filled with the electrode material 18.</p>
    <p num="20">
      Thereafter, as shown in FIG. 4A, the etch back of the electrode material 18 is carried out by the CMP method or the like until the upper surface of the interlayer insulating film 5 is exposed.
      <br/>
      Thus, the electrode material 8 can remain only in the openings 50 and 60.
      <br/>
      In the opening 50, the gate electrode 4 is electrically connected to the diffusion layer 2, so that a local interconnect LIC is formed.
      <br/>
      In the opening 60, a contact CT reaching the diffusion layer 2 is formed.
    </p>
    <p num="21">As shown in FIG. 4B, an insulating film 9 of silicon dioxide having a thickness of tens nm is formed on the upper surfaces of the interlayer insulating film 5 and the wiring material 8 by the CVD method.</p>
    <p num="22">Then, as shown in FIG. 4C, an opening 10 is formed in the insulating film 9 by means of the photo-etching, and as shown in FIG. 4D, a wiring material 11 (e.g., a metal wiring of aluminum) is formed by means of the sputtering to be patterned as shown in FIG. 4E. Thus, a semiconductor device of the present invention is formed.</p>
    <p num="23">In the above preferred embodiment, the wiring material 18 embedded in the opening 50 used for forming the local interconnect has been the same material as that embedded in the opening 60 used for the forming the contact, different materials may be embedded.</p>
    <p num="24">In addition, as shown in FIG. 5A, a diffusion layer 2 of a MOS transistor may be separated from a diffusion layer 28, to which a contact 18 extends.</p>
    <p num="25">Moreover, as shown in FIG. 5B, a contact 18 may reach an electrode having a laminated structure of an insulating film 33 and a gate electrode 44.</p>
    <p num="26">
      With this construction, according to the above preferred embodiment of the present invention, it is possible to simultaneously form the local interconnect and the contact.
      <br/>
      Therefore, it is not required to form an interlayer insulating film (the interlayer insulating film 8 in FIG. 2B), which is formed after forming the local interconnect by the conventional method, so that it is possible to decrease the number of steps in the manufacturing process.
    </p>
    <p num="27">
      In the conventional method, since the opening for the local interconnect and the opening for the contact are separately formed, the openings must be apart from each other at regular intervals so as to prevent the openings from being overlapped with each other due to non-aligned mask and so forth.
      <br/>
      On the other hand, according to this preferred embodiment of the present invention, since the openings are simultaneously formed, both openings are not overlapped, so that it is possible to miniaturize semiconductor chips.
    </p>
    <p num="28">
      Since the conventional local interconnect has irregularities, the interlayer insulating film 8 (see FIG. 2B) formed thereon is not flat, so that the number of steps must be increased to make the interlayer insulating film 8 flat.
      <br/>
      On the other hand, according to this preferred embodiment of the present invention, since the upper surface of the local interconnect is flat, the layer and wiring formed thereon can be flat, so that the step of removing the difference in level can be omitted.
    </p>
    <p num="29">
      In addition, e.g., as shown in FIG. 4B, the electrode material 18 embedded in the opening 50 and the electrode material 18 embedded in the opening 60 have the same elevation on the surface of the interlayer insulating film 5.
      <br/>
      Therefore, according to the present invention, it is possible to sufficiently insulate the wiring material 11 from the electrode material 18 embedded in the opening 50, by providing the insulating film 9.
    </p>
    <p num="30">While the gate electrode of the transistor has been electrically connected to the source/drain diffusion layer by means of the local interconnect, other elements of a semiconductor device may be connected to each other by means of the local interconnect.</p>
    <p num="31">
      FIG. 6A shows an example of sources/drains of two adjacent MOSFETs electrically connected to each other by means of a local interconnect.
      <br/>
      Specifically, in FIG. 6A, MOSFETs are formed in element forming regions divided by field oxide films 20, and the sources/drains of the MOSFETs are connected by means of the local interconnect.
      <br/>
      In FIG. 6A, the same reference numbers are used for the same elements as those in FIGS. 5A and 5B, so that the detailed descriptions thereof are omitted.
      <br/>
      The field oxide films 20 are formed on a semiconductor substrate 1, and MOSFETs 1, 2 are formed in the element forming regions divided by the field oxide films 20.
      <br/>
      That is, a gate electrode 4 is formed on each of gate insulating films 3, and diffusion layers 2 serving as sources/drains are formed on both sides thereof.
      <br/>
      Then, interlayer insulating films 5 are formed thereon, and openings are formed by means of the patterning.
      <br/>
      Then, electrode materials 18 are embedded in the openings.
      <br/>
      The etch back of the electrode materials 18 is carried out so that the electrode materials 18 in the respective openings are flush with each other as shown in FIG. 6A. Subsequently, an insulating film 9 is deposited thereon, and openings are formed by means of the patterning.
      <br/>
      Then, wiring materials 11 are embedded in the openings, and the patterning is carried out to obtain a semiconductor device of FIG. 6A.
    </p>
    <p num="32">FIG. 6B shows a semiconductor device having substantially the same structure as that of FIG. 6A, except that the MOSFETs 1, 2 are formed as NMOS and PMOS, i.e., an n well 1A and a p well 1B are formed on a semiconductor substrate 1 and a FET is formed therein.</p>
    <p num="33">
      FIGS. 7A-7G and FIGS. 8A-8G are sectional views illustrating preferred embodiments of steps of producing the semiconductor devices shown in FIGS. 6A and 6B, respectively.
      <br/>
      Detail explanations for these figures are omitted, because a person skilled in the art may easily know about them from FIGS. 3A-3D and 4A-4D.
    </p>
    <p num="34">According to the present invention, since it is possible to simultaneously form an interconnect structure and a contact, it is possible to prevent the increase of the number of steps and to simplify the manufacturing process.</p>
    <p num="35">
      While the present invention has been disclosed in terms of the preferred embodiment in order to facilitate better understanding thereof, it should be appreciated that the invention can be embodied in various ways without departing from the principle of the invention.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the invention should be understood to include all possible embodiments and modification to the shown embodiments which can be embodied without departing from the principle of the invention as set forth in the appended claims.
