      The polymerizable cyclodextrin derivatives ("PCDs") of this invention relate to cyclodextrin derivatives wherein substantially each molecule of which contains one or more covalently attached polymerizable group or groups, may also contain one or more other types of functional groups covalently attached, may also have other types of molecules that are complexed or more particularly within the otherwise empty spaces within the cyclodextrin derivatives, and combinations and permutations of these characteristics.
      <br/>
      The PCDs are referred to herein as "MCDs" when only methacrylate groups comprise the polymerizable groups of the PCDs.
      <br/>
      These PCDs are organofunctional monomers that are derivatives of one or more forms of cyclodextrin, hydroxyalkyl cyclodextrins, or both ("CDS"), the molecules of which to a very high probability contain no fewer than one polymerizable group per molecule and also to a very high probability contain no fewer than one ligand group per molecule and optionally may contain molecularly encapsulated molecules within the PCDs.

    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="4">Field of the Invention</p>
    <p num="5">
      This invention generally relates to polymerizable monomers that have a multiplicity of functional groups, which compositions are useful as components of dental and industrial formulations for a number of specific applications.
      <br/>
      The principle focus is on functionalized methacrylated cyclodextrins, preferably beta-cyclodextrins because of availability and economic considerations.
      <br/>
      However, alpha- and gamma-cyclodextrins and the hydroxyalkylated derivatives of all three fall within the scope of this invention, as do mixtures of these various kinds of cyclodextrins and their derivatives (CDS), preferably with the stoichiometric equivalence of hydroxyl groups being taken into account in the preparation of the inventive polymerizable cyclodextrin derivatives ("PCDs").
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      Although there are reported to be over 10,000 citations regarding cyclodextrins and their derivatives in the literature, it was surprising to discover in an extensive search that there was apparently no discovery or teaching of an art relating to the production and use of cyclodextrin derivatives in dental materials such as described in the present invention.
      <br/>
      The present invention relates to preparation methods arid utilizations in a spectrum of dental and other uses.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      On one end of the spectrum are highly substituted or derivatized cyclodextrins containing many polymerizable groups, for example, methacrylate and/or acrylate ester moieties, plus or minus other organophilic groups to provide organophilic characteristics for use in dental sealant resins and dental and other composites.
      <br/>
      These are expected to yield formulations with less polymerization shrinkage in comparison to contemporary materials of equal viscosity.
      <br/>
      The basis for this is the quasi-spherical configuration of these high-volume crosslinking monomers together with the prediction of compactness, or high density, of monomeric formulations containing comonomers that can fit within the monomeric methacrylated cyclodextrin derivative (MCD) or polymerizable cyclodextrin derivative (PCD) molecules while liquid, but become "external" chain segments during polymerization.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      Farther over in this spectrum lie compounds of intermediate hydrophilicity.
      <br/>
      These compounds comprise derivatives of combinatorial syntheses of cyclodextrins containing at least one and preferably more than one polymerizable group on each molecule together with, and also on each of the same molecules, one and preferably more than one ligand group(s) selected from those that can form hydrogen bonds, ionic bonding interactions,  PI  interactions, hydrophobic bonds, and/or van der Waals interactions with corresponding substrate groups.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      On the other hand, a minimal number, one or preferably two or more, of organophilic polymerizable groups, together with a large number of hydrophilic polar ligand groups can be obtained on molecules in the resulting assortment of compounds for applications such as penetration and adhesive bonding to appropriate hydrophilic substrates, the formation of dental and other cements, and other medical and industrials applications.
      <br/>
      For example, on this end of this spectrum, these derivatives of cyclodextrin can have a large number of carboxyl ligand groups and a small number of polymerizable groups for formulations to be used in novel cements, including those resembling dental "glass-ionomer cements," zinc oxide-based cements, calcium ion-based cements, and cements comprising admixtures of di- and polyvalent cations with compounds falling within the scope of this invention.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      The combinatorial syntheses of the present invention yield mixtures of (co)polymerizable cyclodextrin derivatives (PCDs).
      <br/>
      The derived mixture or "library," of combinations and permutations and the configurations of the molecules resulting from syntheses as described herein would, when properly formulated with other comonomers and auxiliary components well known to the art, and applied to dental surfaces, bind preferentially to substrate sites containing some threshold number and/or strength of interactions.
      <br/>
      As the assortment of molecules diffuses into the substrate layers, the particular molecules that find such "docking sites" will be held in that position while molecules of other configurations will continue to diffuse at random through the substrate surface layers until they find different surface sites to which they would be strongly bound.
      <br/>
      Eventually those not finding sites would constitute part of the monomers that would fill the remaining spaces between the intra-substrate, surface-bound monomers.
      <br/>
      With appropriate polymerization initiators, both would subsequently form a three-dimensional crosslinked polymeric network to provide improved bonding between the substrate material and overlying polymers.
    </p>
    <p num="11">
      One of the most problematic substrates for dental adhesive bonding is that of the dentin portion of teeth needing repair.
      <br/>
      Current techniques involve light acid etching to remove material that is weakly attached to the dentin or enamel surfaces.
      <br/>
      This acid treatment also dissolves some of the surface hydroxyapatite and related calcium phosphate minerals, which comprise about one-half of the volume of intact dentin.
      <br/>
      This surface-demineralized layer is then impregnated with monomer solutions to fill and interact with the resulting collagen-rich surface layer.
      <br/>
      The monomers polymerize to form what has become known as a "hybrid layer" comprising interpenetrating synthetic restorative polymers and natural collagen polymers.
    </p>
    <p num="12">
      To date the process has been one of trial and error with specific primer compounds that have a very limited number of configurational groups that can interact with the highly diverse sites within the dentin substrate.
      <br/>
      By contrast the inventive product libraries of multifunctional and multi configurational molecules, the PCDs of the present invention, can interact better by having not only more ligand groups per molecule but also by having a vast variety of conformations of those ligand groups on different molecules of the "product library" used, which molecules, by automatic selection, will find and be "recognized" by docking sites.
      <br/>
      The PCDs can anchor with multiple interactions to collagen fibrils and denatured polypeptide portions of the collagen fibrils remaining exposed upon the removal of the previously reinforcing calcium phosphate crystallites.
    </p>
    <p num="13">
      Although in most contemporary chemical literature it is assumed that the readers know the definitions and limits of the terms "combinatorial synthesis," "combinatorial libraries," and others that are not unrelated to the present specification, it may be well to define and differentiate such as are used herein. "Combinatorial synthesis" herein comprises combining and reacting a specified amount of one or more cyclodextrin compounds with a specified amount of one or more reagent compounds in such a way as to produce a mixture of reaction products having substituents located in quasi-random configurations, having various combinations and permutations, on one or both of the two rims of the cone-shaped rings of the various cyclodextrin molecules.
      <br/>
      The term "quasi-random" is used because "random" would imply that all of the potential reaction sites were equally reactive, which in the case of cyclodextrins, they are not.
      <br/>
      The terms "combinatorial libraries," "product libraries," "PCD libraries," or "libraries" as used herein refers to the mixture of reaction products resulting from the combinatorial synthesis just described, either before or after purification procedures.
    </p>
    <p num="14">
      In contrast to conventional combinatorial organic synthetic procedures, which iteratively use combinatorial syntheses to produce combinatorial libraries together with assays or screening methods to select the one best compound for a particular purpose from the millions that have been synthesized, the procedures in the present invention retain most if not substantially all of the many heterogeneous monomeric molecules in the mixture of reaction products resulting from the combinatorial synthesis.
      <br/>
      This allows for the large variety of these monomeric PCD configurations to interact with the large variety of potential docking or anchoring sites that exist in complex substrates, such as, for example, partially decalcified dentin, enamel, bone, and many industrial and other materials.
    </p>
    <p num="15">
      Three-dimensional computer modeling of typical portions of type I collagen the type found in dentin, and a number of typical members of the anticipated cyclodextrin derivatives, the "PCD libraries" of this invention have indicated that multiple bonding interactions can occur between each of the modeled cyclodextrin derivative molecules and the modeled collagen.
      <br/>
      For example, the PCD's pendant carboxyl groups interacted with amino acid side chains such as lysine and arginine, together with hydrogen bonding and "hydrophobic bonding" along the collagen triple helix.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, some of the ends of teleopeptide groups attached to the triple-helical portion of the collagen molecule and single-chain peptides resulting from ruptured or denatured collagen in the models could fit within the hollow central core of cyclodextrin derivatives of the present invention.
      <br/>
      Thus, the PCDs may encircle ends of single peptide chains.
      <br/>
      According to the models, it was surprising to find that PCD compounds of this invention could also encircle and form "hydrophobic bonds" with the relatively hydrophobic side groups, such as phenylalanine, tyrosine, proline and others, of collagen.
      <br/>
      In the past, the importance of hydrophobic bonding, in an aqueous environment, in the configuring and structural integrity of proteins and of its role in the rates of intra- and intermolecular adaptations has been highly underrated.
    </p>
    <p num="16">
      It is also conceived that these multifunctional monomers, as they penetrate into the surface, can and will form crosslinking bridges with calcium ions by way of intermolecular carboxyl moieties on these polymerizable compounds.
      <br/>
      Binding to etched enamel should also be exceptionally good by a multiplicity of carboxyl groups interacting with calcium and multiple H-bonding with phosphate moieties of the highly mineralized enamel surfaces.
      <br/>
      Individual members within this multifarious collection of derivatives of cyclodextrin, "PCD library" can range from having one or two to substantially a maximum number polymerizable groups and a minimum number of polar ligand groups in the formulation of comonomers and, optionally, fugitive diluents.
      <br/>
      This number is not intended to be limiting and can be increased or decreased by altering the stoichiometries of the reagents used in the synthesis, depending on the proposed use and the best results determined empirically.
      <br/>
      Stoichiometries can be used that yield a distribution having sufficient polymerizable groups per molecule to provide organophilic characteristics and miscibility in comonomers for formulations used as binders for dental and other composites.

    <p num="17">2. Description of the Prior Art</p>
    <p num="18">
      Although there are thousands of references to cyclodextrins and their derivatives in the general literature, e.g., Takeo et al., 1973; Colson et al., 1974; Bender and Komiyama, 1978; Saenger, 1984; Szejtli, 1984; Breslow, 1984; Poudrier, 1995, searches to date have revealed neither reports nor utilization of monomeric methacrylated cyclodextrin derivatives (MCDs) in dental resin formulations, combinatorial synthetic methods, or libraries, or assemblages of monomeric compounds that have multiple permutations of polymerizable and adhesion-promoting groups such as the polymerizable cyclodextrin derivatives (PCDs) conceived and taught herein.
      <br/>
      However, "MCDs" was used to designate methacrylated cyclodextrins when methacrylate groups were used as the polymerizable moieties in dental resin formulations (Bowen, 1996).
      <br/>
      Early work by Bowen (1961) showed that certain surface-active comonomers could compete with water for attachment to hard tooth tissues.
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      An object of this invention comprises discovering many potentially useful dental applications of appropriately modified cyclodextrins.
      <br/>
      One application lies in composites, sealants, cements, and other resin formulations wherein polymerization shrinkage stresses might be reduced with perhaps less diminution of other desirable physical properties than by other means alone.
      <br/>
      As a mechanism, the relatively hydrophobic cavities within (meth)acrylated cyclodextrins house, prior to polymerization, appropriately sized comonomers that have relatively low dielectric constants, which, during polymerization, may become external network chain segments.
      <br/>
      The resulting empty, somewhat rigid cavities (.about.42  Angstrom 3 per PCD molecule) comprise some of the free volume space otherwise lost during polymerization.

      Another problem associated with forming complex derivatives of CDS is an economical method of forming clearly homogeneous solutions so that probability statistics can be applied to form products of the desired characteristics.
      <br/>
      This requires solvated CD molecules that are not just suspensions of crystallites or of gelled aggregates when the reagents are added and mixed at rates lower than reaction rates.

      The present conception includes the experimental use of sterically hindered tertiary alcohols (e.g., t-butyl alcohol) as well as mixtures of appropriate aprotic solvents and amines as solvents to obtain clear and homogeneous solutions of CDS for the syntheses of MCDs and PCDs.
      <br/>
      The rationale is based on the low SN 2 reactivity of tertiary alcohols compared with the primary and secondary alcohols of cyclodextrins.
      <br/>
      The feasibility of including hindered tertiary alcohols and the proportions of reagents to be used when including tertiary alcohols as components in obtaining clear solutions of CDS for combinatorial synthesis reactions to obtain useful PCDs must be determined empirically, and the mildest and most selective conditions and reagents feasible are recommended.

    <p num="23">
      "Eutectic" mixtures can also be used to lower the melting point and increase the solubility of CDS in solvents and/or catalysts; in such cases the stoichiometries and relative reactivity rates must be taken into account.
      <br/>
      Eutectic mixtures of the high-melting, and relatively insoluble, CDS can utilize the relationship: X=100(T2 -Te)/T1 +T2 -2Te, where X is the mole percentage of lower-melting component, T1 is the melting point of the lower-melting component, T2 is the melting point of the higher-melting component, and Te is the eutectic temperature which is the first sign of melting of the mixture.

    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="32">The novel combination of properties of certain polyfunctional monomers and their formulations provides for an unprecedented variety of potential uses in dental, medical and industrial applications where low polymerization shrinkage, adhesiveness, and other valuable properties are in need of improvement, especially where adhesive bonding to dentin is desired.</p>
    <p num="33">
      For adhesive bonding applications, the quintessential monomers have more than one carboxyl or other ligand group per monomeric molecule, more than one methacrylate, acrylate and/or other group that can be polymerized by a free-radical mechanism, and, are controllably hydrophilic.
      <br/>
      The carboxyl groups in the monomers or other ingredients can be used in the form of protonated carboxyl groups, dissociated. carboxylate groups, salts, amine complexes, esters, amides, and/or other derivatives.
    </p>
    <p num="34">
      The high crosslink density of these polymers gives greater strength, durability, and dimensional stability.
      <br/>
      Well-cured polymers prepared from these crosslinking monomers have improved dimensional and adhesive characteristics during and after polymerization.
      <br/>
      This is because monomers and formulations described herein can be soluble or miscible in water and also capable of dissolving water in the monomeric formulations.
      <br/>
      The proportionalities of carboxyl groups and other components determine the desired hydrophilicities for the formulations.
      <br/>
      When the PCDs are applied in proper diluent formulations, the large variety of configurations will allow for individual members, which are discrete compounds of the PCD library of diverse configurations, to bind selectively to their more stable binding sites on the sterically and chemically diverse aspects of the substrate.
    </p>
    <p num="35">
      An important feature is the amorphous nature of the PCD monomers, which distinguishes them from monomers that form crystalline solids.
      <br/>
      The viscosities of the monomer formulations can be adjusted to optimum levels by the use of added comonomers of lower viscosity.
    </p>
    <p num="36">
      The present invention provides means by which a broad spectrum of surface-active, adhesive, crosslinking monomers, which polymerize by a free radical mechanism, can be produced by novel synthesis methods that are described herein.
      <br/>
      The inventive conception includes the use of probability statistics to obtain new and useful mixtures of organofunctional PCD monomers.
      <br/>
      The statistics are used to predetermine the molar proportions of the synthetic reagents to obtain the desired proportions of polymerizable, ligand, and hydrophilic groups on individual members of a very large population of similar but diverse PCD molecules.
    </p>
    <p num="37">Another object of the present invention is to disclose novel complexes of polymerization photo initiators, which are practically water-insoluble, that are molecularly encapsulated (cf. Breslow, 1984) within water-soluble surface-active monomers, which complexes can penetrate and infiltrate into aqueous substrate environments and adsorb by multiple-bond interactions onto diverse substrates, including proteins such as collagen, and then, while bound to the surface, be subject to photoinduced reactions that produce free radicals on these bound complexes, which radicals can then be added onto by double-bonded carbon vinyl groups, or other groups capable of addition and chain-forming polymerization, for growth outward from these surface initiation sites into the bulk of overlying monomers, which will then form crosslinked polymers intimately, multiply and densely bonded to the substrate, surface(s).</p>
    <p num="38">
      It is most advantageous to have surface-bound sources of initiation that will allow mobile monomer molecules to approach, add on to, and polymerize away from a substrate surface.
      <br/>
      The currently available photo initiators do not have surface-binding groups and a polymerizable vinyl group together; therefore, they are not optimal in their capability of bringing about maximally dense populations of linkages between polymers and substrate surface attachment sites.
    </p>
    <p num="39">Another object of the present invention is to disclose novel complexes of polymerization initiators, for example, benzoyl peroxide or NN-dimethyl-p-toluidine, which are practically water-insoluble, that are molecularly encapsulated within the inventive SACs and comonomers, which complexes can penetrate and infiltrate into aqueous substrate environments and adsorb on diverse substrate sites.</p>
    <p num="40">Another object of the present invention is to provide compositions that can reduce polymerization shrinkage and also improve adhesive bonding by complying with the following adhesive bonding factors: (1) members of the composition should have "chameleonic" solubility characteristics by being capable of rearranging intramolecular configurations, with polar groups that can be turned inward or outward relative to organophilic moieties, to allow solubility in both polar liquids like water and relatively nonpolar liquids, like acetone, water-insoluble comonomers, etc., to allow diffusion to "anchor" sites; (2) members should have mutual spacial arrangements of hydrophobic groups or areas that fit, in three dimensions, with complimentary hydrophobic groups or areas on the substrate, e.g., collagen fibrils; (3) members should have complimentary charges (e.g., --NH+-O2 C--) relative, in three dimensions, to accessible regions in the substrate; (4) members should have two or more anionic, e.g., carboxyl, groups arranged appropriately to allow for bridging by Ca++ and/or other divalent or multivalent cations between molecules and with the substrate; (5) members should have structures that allow for multiple H-bonding, after approximation by the other mechanisms, to anchor on "recognition" sites; and, (6) members should contain at least two polymerizable groups to allow for the formation of a "monomolecular (co)polymer."</p>
    <p num="41">The inventive methods and products described herein provide for a broad spectrum of surface-active, adhesive, crosslinking monomers and comonomers, which polymerize by a free radical mechanism, produced by synthesis methods that utilize catalysts for the syntheses, some of which catalysts may be retained in the synthesis reaction products to further serve, at a later time, to aid in the polymerization of these monomers to yield improved adhesion qualities and other desirable characteristics not hitherto available.

    <heading>DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
    <p num="43">
      Of the potential uses of modified cyclodextrins in dental applications, uses also lie in adhesive bonding formulations.
      <br/>
      For example, dentin surfaces that have been superficially demineralized probably have disrupted collagen fibrils with regions of denaturation.
      <br/>
      Ruptures of the collagen molecules' triple-helical portions would probably present oligopeptide chains as end groups.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, at the ends of the triple-helical portions of intact type I collagen molecules, there are nonhelical teleopeptide chain extensions, which are relatively hydrophobic (Fietzek and Kuhn, 1976).
      <br/>
      According to three-dimensional computer scale models, the inside diameters of  BETA CD molecules can accommodate individual peptide chains.
      <br/>
      The outer dimensions are roughly the same as the diameters of collagen triple helixes.
      <br/>
      The ends of peptide chains and the larger, less-polar side groups of collagen's amino-acid segments e.g., phenylalanine, methionine, etc. might therefore allow for novel kinds of hydrophobic bonding contributions from appropriately designed PCDs.
    </p>
    <p num="44">For applications requiring high hydrophile/lipophil ratios (and/or adequate water solubility), such as adhesive bonding to dental and other hydrophilic surfaces, syntheses utilizing appropriate proportions of (meth)acrylic anhydride and/or cyclic anhydrides e.g., succinic, itaconic, maleic, phthalic, tetrabromophthalic, etc. per CD molecule can be used.</p>
    <p num="45">Hydrophilic PCD monomers and formulations described herein can be soluble or miscible in water to an extent between about 1% by weight and infinite miscibility and capable of dissolving at least about 1% by weight of water in the formulations or can be relatively insoluble in water as desired, by virtue of the fact that the proportions of hydrophilic and organophilic groups or components can be predetermined by the use of probability statistics together with the combinatorial synthetic methods disclosed herein.</p>
    <p num="46">
      It was discovered that if a large excess of methacrylic anhydride were used, practically all of the hydroxyl groups of the  BETA CD molecule could be esterified by methacrylate groups, yielding products with very low water solubility.
      <br/>
      However, the use of increased proportions of cyclic anhydrides relative to methacrylic anhydride results in increased hydrophilicity.
      <br/>
      The addition reaction of cyclic anhydrides with hydroxyl groups of CD molecules results in monoester substituents that retain free carboxyl groups.
      <br/>
      These free carboxyl groups provide ligand functions with affinity for substrate sites and also allow for a wide range of miscibility with water, polar fugitive solvents, and hydrophilic monomers and formulations containing them.
      <br/>
      The activity of water in formulations can optionally be made approximately equal to that in biological tissues to promote biocompatibility and enhanced adhesive characteristics of polymers prepared from these formulations.
      <br/>
      One of the primary conceptions is that probability statistics can be used to determine in advance the proportions of hydrophilic ligand groups, e.g., carboxyl groups from the use of cyclic anhydrides, hydrophilic groups from unreacted hydroxyl groups, and organophylic groups, e.g., methacrylate or other polymerizable moieties to obtain PCDs most suitable for a given application.
      <br/>
      It was also conceived and is herein disclosed that catalysts, stabilizers, accelerators, chain-transfer agents, appropriate organophilic monomers, and polymerization initiators can be complexed hosted within the molecules of these PCD compounds so that they will not be separated by partitioning during penetration of the monomers into the substrate adherends, an essential feature of the invention.
    </p>
    <p num="47">
      The following illustrates how probability statistics can be used.
      <br/>
      A first problem was to determine how few moles of methacrylic anhydride or of other reagents, each molecule of which would attach a polymerizable monomeric group, M, per mole of  BETA CD could be used and yet have at least one M group on each  BETA CD product molecule.
      <br/>
      If in the reaction vessel there was a solution containing sufficient  BETA CD (e.g., &gt;1010 molecules, or &gt;.about.10-13 mole) and if Nc represented the number of P BETA CD molecules, with the simplifying assumptions that each of the 21 hydroxyl groups (K=21) on the  BETA CD molecules were equally reactive and that each M-producing reagent molecule would react with and only with  BETA CD hydroxyl groups, then the question became one of determining the number (Nm) of M-producing reagent molecules to add in order to have at least a 95% probability that at least 99% of the  BETA CD molecules would acquire one or more attached polymerizable M group(s).
      <br/>
      If p denotes the very unlikely probability that a given  BETA CD molecule would end up without any Ms, then
      <br/>
      p=(1-Nm /K * Nc)K
    </p>
    <p num="48">
      because Nc and Nm are so large.
      <br/>
      This relationship was based on combinatorial probability arguments that  (Equation image '1' not included in text)
    </p>
    <p num="49">
      If X denotes the insignificant number of  BETA CD molecules that end up without any Ms and X is to be less than 1% of Nc and Nm is large, it follows that the distribution of X is essentially Poisson, which distribution implies that its variance is equal to its mean.
      <br/>
      And because its mean is large (1% of 1010 is still very large), the Normal approximation to its distribution could be used.
      <br/>
      Thus to have Pr(X&lt;0.01 * Nc)=0.95,it was necessary to have Pr((X-Nc * p)/(Nc * p)0.5 &lt;(0.01 * Nc -Nc * p)/(Nc * p)0.5)0.95 so that (from the Normal distribution) (0.01 * Nc -Nc * p)/(Nc * p)0.5 1.645. The solution of the quadratic equation for p, in view of the size of Nc, gave
      <br/>
      p=0.01-0.1645 /Nc.
    </p>
    <p num="50">
      With the equating of these two expressions for p and solving for Nm,
      <br/>
      Nm =K * Nc (1-0.011/K (1-16.45/KNc)))
    </p>
    <p num="51">
      was obtained.
      <br/>
      Therefore in this case (where K=21 ), Nm /Nc &gt;= 4.14.
    </p>
    <p num="52">
      It should be noted, however, that the 21 hydroxyl groups on  BETA CD molecules are not all equally reactive: Initially, the 7 primary hydroxyl groups of C(6) are the most reactive, the 7 secondary hydroxyls on the C(2) ring positions are somewhat less reactive, and least reactive are the 7 secondary hydroxyl groups on the C(3) positions.
      <br/>
      Steric hindrance also becomes a factor as reagents become attached to a given  BETA CD molecule.
      <br/>
      These considerations greatly increase the probability that each product molecule would have at least one polymerizable group when the 4.14/ BETA CD ratio is used and reacts so as to attach.
      <br/>
      Impurities and side reactions would obviously have the opposite effect.
      <br/>
      If reagents and reaction conditions are such that only 7 hydroxyl groups react, for example the primary hydroxyl groups of the C(6) positions, then Nm /Nc &gt;= 3.38. If 14 hydroxyl groups react, Nm /Nc &gt;= 3.93.
    </p>
    <p num="53">To obtain corresponding values for use with alpha-cyclodextrin, 6, 12, or 18 are used for K in the calculations described above. K=8, 16, or 24 are used for gamma-cyclodextrin derivatizations.</p>
    <p num="54">
      In order to be even more certain that crosslinking and multi functionality of ligand groups are possible with every product molecule, it would be desirable to have a minimum of at least two of each kind of groups on all molecules of the heterogeneous assembly of combinations and permutations to be used in the formulations for various applications.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, further statistical probability calculations were carried out to determine the molar ratio of reagent molecules to  BETA CD molecules that should be used to ensure a high probability, &gt;0.95, that at least 99% of each product molecule, in the libraries of PCDs, would have at least two such groups covalently bonded to it.
      <br/>
      The results of these calculations indicated that 5.8 moles of reagent per mole of  BETA CD are needed in order to have a probability of 0.95 that at least 99% of the various PCDs' molecules will have more than one reagent group attached.
      <br/>
      For example, 5.8 moles of methacrylic anhydride per mole of  BETA CD, each molecule of  BETA CD having 21 reactive hydroxyl groups, if there is homogeneous mixing and random reactions with the hydroxyl groups, would yield a family of PCD molecules with an average of 5.8 methacrylate ester groups on the PCDs in general and more than one methacrylate ester group on each of the very small number of PCD molecules having the least number of methacrylate groups per molecule.
      <br/>
      Similar reasoning applies to other reagent compounds providing other types of polymerizable groups, ligand groups, or other functional groups.
    </p>
    <p num="55">On the other hand, to reserve for a special purpose at least one unreacted site (hydroxyl group on at least 99% of the  BETA CD molecules with &gt;0.95 probability), a proportion of 16.86 reagent molecules should be reacted per  BETA CD molecule.</p>
    <p num="56">
      For use in applications wherein the symmetry and structural rigidity ofthe PCD scaffold rings are important, it may be desirable to limit the extent of derivatization of hydroxyl groups so as to conserve hydroxyl groups on the least-reactive C(3) atoms.
      <br/>
      By this means, intramolecular O(3)--H--O(2') hydrogen bonding can be retained so that the molecules' cores retain much of their potential inflexibility by analogy, relative to methylated cyclodextrins described by Harata (1991).

      The present conception includes the utilization as complexes, within as well as external to the  BETA CD and other PCD monomers of the aforementioned compounds, of free-radical polymerization initiators, so that they will migrate and penetrate aqueous and hydrophilic environments along with these monomers or otherwise be favorably affected in their rate or manner of inducing polymerization.
      <br/>
      The initiators may be organophilic and fit within the PCDs or have ionizable groups and/or have surface-active groups or moieties that render them cooperatively or independently substantive to substrates of interest to yield enhanced adhesive bonding characteristics to the formulations by virtue of initiation of polymer chain growth from molecules attached to the substrate.

      <br/>
      Gravity filtering overnight and drying with light vacuum for 10 d yielded a free-flowing, almost white powder (4.9 g).
      <br/>
      Samples from this aliquot were used for most of the procedures described below.
      <br/>
      The total M BETA CD recovered from these 5 trial procedures (.about.27.3 g) corresponded to a yield of about 80% of theoretical.

    <p num="102">The theoretical formula weight of fully methacrylated beta-cyclodextrin is about 2565.</p>
    <p num="103">
      Elemental analysis of a sample from aliquot 5 indicated the following.
      <br/>
      Found: C 58.62, H 6.37, O 34.88, N not detected (&lt;0.5%, the sensitivity of the method used); the theoretical values were C 59.01, H 6.05, O 34.94%. The "missing" 0.13% could represent N from residual pyridine and/or experimental error.
      <br/>
      Agreement within .+- 0 (slashed zero) 40% for C, H, and O is compatible with a M BETA CD product having .about.21 methacrylate groups per molecule.
    </p>
    <p num="104">
      The 13 C, 1 H, and 2-D (2-dimensional heteronuclear correlation of 13 C and 1 H) NMR spectra also suggest that substantially every one of the hydroxyl groups had been esterified in the "purified," twice-precipitated, but substantially amorphous, samples of M BETA CD.
      <br/>
      Although in appropriate shift positions, the peaks in both proton and carbon spectra were often not sharp singlets, which broadening could be attributed to a number of causes (Casu et al., 1968).
    </p>
    <p num="105">
      An estimate of the number of hydroxyl groups on the cyclodextrins that were esterified to form methacrylate ester groups was obtained by integrating the proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1 H NMR) peaks.
      <br/>
      Deuterated chloroform, benzene, or methylsulfoxide (DMSO) solutions of aliquots 2 and 5 provided an isolated peak corresponding to the methacrylate CH3 groups; however, the two protons on the vinyl sp2 carbons gave peaks down field and confounded with the peaks corresponding to the 49 protons located on the 7 dextrose (glucose) rings of the  BETA CD moiety.
      <br/>
      Therefore, calculations were necessary to "subtract" the vinyl protons from the total protons represented by the overlapping down-field peaks.
      <br/>
      The number of methacrylate groups divided by the number of  BETA CD moieties thereby indicated the average degree of esterification.
      <br/>
      About five integrations and calculations were made on each sample solution, and the values were averaged to accommodate individual differences in the integrations.
      <br/>
      The overall average of 30 such integrations gave an estimation number of 24 (s.d. 11), which was slightly above the theoretical 21 methacrylate groups per molecule.

    <p num="107">
      A few granules of the  BETA CD or M BETA CD were placed on a microscope slide, covered with a cover glass, and examined with a polarizing microscope while a drop of liquid was placed to flow under the cover glass.
      <br/>
      These liquids comprised solvents having a wide range of solubility parameters and a number of monomers that might be of interest in dental or industrial formulations.
      <br/>
      Subjective solubility ranged from "practically insoluble," wherein the particles showing Brownian motion did not disappear and the comers of larger ones remained sharp, to "very soluble," in which cases all particles promptly went into a homogenous solution.
      <br/>
      With this method,  BETA CD appeared as birefringent crystals that were very slowly and only slightly soluble in water and that were practically insoluble in methanol and in ethylene glycol dimethyl ether.
      <br/>
      In contrast, the M BETA CD particles appeared to be mostly amorphous and were very rapidly soluble (miscible) in methanol, promptly soluble in hydroxyethyl methacrylate and in benzyl methacrylate, slowly soluble in triethyleneglycol dimethacrylate and in 1,3-glycerol dimethacrylate, very slowly soluble in undiluted BIS-GMA, and practically insoluble in water.

      Some of the M BETA CD product from aliquot 5 (0.2365 g) was dissolved in methanol (0.9850 g).
      <br/>
      Camphorquinone (CQ) (0.0152 g) was dissolved in methanol (0.6141 g).
      <br/>
      These solutions were combined, giving approximately a 1:1 CQ to M BETA CD molar ratio, and allowed to stand for 5 d. The cap of the vial was removed to allow slow evaporation of solvent while the solution was being stirred magnetically.
      <br/>
      When the clear fluid solution became slightly viscous, a one-drop sample was placed on a microscope slide and immediately spread under a cover glass, forming a thin sandwiched film.
      <br/>
      The film was exposed to a dental curing light for 10 s and then checked for cover-glass immobilization with a hand instrument.
      <br/>
      This exposure to light for 10 s was repeated until the cover glass could not be moved.
      <br/>
      In five replications, one sample "hardened," i.e., the cover glass was immobilized, between 10 and 20 s, three between 20 and 30 s, and one between 30 and 40 s.

    <p num="111">
      According to Fisher-Hirschfelder-Taylor and computer-generated scale models, each M BETA CD molecule can have a central hollow space into which a smaller molecule of appropriate size can fit.
      <br/>
      Camphorquinone, benzoyl peroxide, and N,N-dimethyl-para-toluidine have sizes such that each of these could be hosted within M BETA CD molecules.
      <br/>
      M BETA CD was combined and shaken vigorously with BPO in a small vial; the proportions were one molecule of BPO per molecule of M BETA CD.
      <br/>
      Sufficient methanol was added to the sample to slowly form a clear solution.
      <br/>
      The methanol was then allowed to evaporate from the opened vial, while it was rotated slowly at about a 45 degree angle, to promote the "complexation" of the guest BPO molecules within the host M BETA CD molecules.
      <br/>
      After the mixture had dried to a thin glassy film on the inside of the vial, the open vial was placed in a desiccator with partial vacuum for further drying.
      <br/>
      The solid residue was pulverized with a flat-ended glass rod to form a fine white powder.
    </p>
    <p num="112">
      A control material was a physical mixture of the M BETA CD and BPO powders, in the same proportions, combined and shaken vigorously in an identical vial.

      After drying in the desiccator, it was further mixed by stirring and gently triturating with a glass rod.
    </p>
    <p num="113">
      Aliquots of these powders were then placed in a simultaneous Differential Thermal Analyzer (DTA)/Thermogravimetric Analyzer (TGA; Harrop model ST-736).
      <br/>
      Heating rates were 2 or 3 (degree)  C./min to determine the time and temperature of BPO thermal decomposition and/or the exothermic opening of the double bonds of the M BETA CD methacrylate groups.
      <br/>
      DTA/TGA comparisons of these powers were made with each vs. the other and each vs. an alumina control powder, the weights being equal to about .+- 0 (slashed zero) 1 mg.
      <br/>
      When these powders were heated slowly in the DTA/TGA analyzer, the time and temperature of BPO thermal decomposition and/or the exothermic opening of the double bonds of the M BETA CD methacrylate groups were distinctly different.
      <br/>
      The exotherms of the mixed powders preceded those of the "complexed" combination.
      <br/>
      These results are in accord with an interpretation that in the methanol solution the BPO had been substantially complexed as guests within the host M BETA CD molecules and that this complexation had thermally stabilized these BPO molecules relative to the particles of crystalline BPO in the mechanical mixture of the two powders.

    <p num="114">Additional Example 8</p>
    <p num="115">
      A combinatorial synthesis was carried out wherein methacrylic anhydride and cyclic glutaric anhydride were both reacted with a clear solution of dried  BETA CD (F.Wt..about.1135) in a mixture of pyridine, an aprotic solvent, and a nonaromatic amine catalyst.  BETA CD (167.8 g as received, courtesy of American Maize-Products Co., Hammond, Ind., lot G 6020-42) was dried in a vacuum oven (about 30 kPa, 110 (degree)  C., 5 d), cooled and stored in a closed vacuum desiccator containing indicating Drierite.RTM., yielding 145.6 g. A solution of 0.0424 g BHT (butylated hydroxy toluene; 2,6-di-tert-butyl-4-methyl-phenol) in 144 g of.about.anhydrous pyridine was magnetically stirred in a closed round-bottom flask and heated to about 55 (degree)  C. Then 30.0 g (0.0264 mol; 0.555 OH equivalent) of the dried  BETA CD was added, resulting in an almost-clear, translucent suspension that promptly became opaque white and difficult to stir.
      <br/>
      The suspension was at least as viscous at 94 (degree)  C. as it was at 23 (degree)  C. The addition of 32.0 g of N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (1-methylpyrrolidinone) did not give apparent solubility improvement over the same temperature range.
      <br/>
      However, it was surprisingly discovered that when 1,8-diazabicyclo�5.4.0�undec-7-ene (DBU) was added (34.0 g, which was probably more than necessary) at 80 (degree)  C., the suspension immediately became a clear, very light yellow solution.
      <br/>
      As it cooled to about 63 (degree)  C., 25.1 mL of methacrylic anhydride (26.0 g, 6 mol per mol of  BETA CD) was added from a dropping funnel into the stirring solution, the temperature being maintained by a prompt exotherm and the dropping rate during the 17 min of addition.
      <br/>
      Two h later, at 57 (degree)  C., 19.0 g of glutaric anhydride (6 mol per mol of  BETA CD), dissolved in 30 g of chloroform, was added dropwise over a 20 min period with a similar exothermic response.
      <br/>
      The clear, dark-amber solution that formed appeared to remain the same while it stirred in the closed flask for a number of days at about 23 (degree)  C. This mixture of PCDs was purified by adding toluene dropwise while the mixture was stirred, letting the two phases settle, decanting off the toluene phase, thinning to a fluid consistency by the addition of anhydrous ethanol, and then repeating this procedure.
      <br/>
      Numerous one-mL samples were withdrawn, and these aliquots were mixed, in small glass vials equipped with poly(tetrafluoroethylene)-lined screw-caps, with volatile solvents having a wide range of solubility parameters to determine solubility characteristics, which assisted in further purifications as described in "FORMULATION 5." For example, to one of the one-mL samples was added one mL of reagent-grade acetone; the mixture was agitated vigorously, let settle into two equilibrated phases, and then the upper acetone-rich phase was removed by decantation.
      <br/>
      The lower, product-rich phase was heated to about 105 (degree)  C. in the open vial in a vacuum oven (about 30 Kpa or 21 in.
      <br/>
      Hg, gage) for about 3 h, by which time the product had formed a slightly off-white open-cell solid foam.
      <br/>
      It was mechanically comminuted to a powder the particles of which were, when viewed under a polarizing microscope, glassy solids that dissolved immediately when water was added.
    </p>
    <p num="116">The rationale for the proportions of reagents used in the synthesis of this particular product library was that on average it would contain sufficient carboxyl and residual hydroxyl groups to provide sufficient affinity with water to allow its components to diffuse through water to access substrate surface sites, would comprise a PCD library or composition of millions of different combinations and permutations or configurations, have at least two polymerizable groups, hydroxyl groups, and carboxyl groups on virtually every molecule, and have the desired "chamelionic" characteristics for versatility and miscibility in comonomers and fugitive solvents to mix homogeneously with appropriate formulations containing them.</p>
    <p num="117">It is essential that the disparate classes of compounds or compositions be taken together as a whole, for this constitutes a major aspect of the invention, transcending the novelty of individual chemical compositions of matter.</p>
