      <br/>
      An active implantable medical device, particularly a pacemaker, defibrillator and/or cardiovertor of the "multisite" type, in which electrodes are placed in at least two neighboring cardiac sites, e.g., right and left ventricular sites, and/or right and left atrial sites.
      <br/>
      These electrodes are connected to a cardiac signal sensing circuit to detect a potential of depolarization on the corresponding site(s).
      <br/>
      These electrodes also are connected to a stimulation circuit to apply, if necessary, a stimulation impulse on the same site(s).
      <br/>
      The device adjusts the amplitude of stimulation in relation with the capture threshold and a total refractory period comprising an absolute refractory period, in which all detection is inhibited, followed by a relative refractory period.
      <br/>
      The detection of a depolarization during the relative refractory period marks the absence of a capture.
      <br/>
      It is advantageously foreseen to adjust the instant of beginning of the relative refractory period, notably by progressive increase of the duration of the relative refractory period over several successive cycles, until there is a detection of a depolarization in this relative refractory period.
      <br/>
      This indicates a loss of capture and allows for setting the stimulation amplitude above the capture threshold.

    <heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="1">
      The present invention concerns "active implantable medical devices" such as those devices defined by the Jun. 20, 1990 directive 90/385/EEC of the European Community Council, more particularly devices which are able to deliver to the heart electrical impulses of low energy (stimulation impulses) for the processing of troubles of the cardiac rhythm such as cardiac pacemakers, defibrillators and/or cardiovertors.
      <br/>
      It more particularly concerns the so-called "multisite" prostheses, that is to say prostheses in which electrodes are placed in a plurality of distinct respective sites on the heart, typically with at least two ventricular sites.
    </p>
    <p num="2">Such a multisite cardiac prosthesis can be of the type known as "double chamber" (double ventricular stimulation), triple chamber (right atrial stimulation and double ventricular stimulation) or quadruple chamber (double atrial stimulation and double ventricular stimulation).</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="3">
      It is known to treat troubles of the cardiac rhythm (arrhythmias) with cardiac stimulation.
      <br/>
      It also has been proposed to treat troubles of the myocardium contraction observed in patients with cardiac insufficiency (hereinafter "troubles") with cardiac stimulation.
      <br/>
      These latter troubles can originate spontaneously or can be induced by a traditional cardiac stimulation impulse.
      <br/>
      Reference is made to the study of J. C. Daubert et al., Stimu.oe butted.ur, Volume 25, n (degree) 3, pp. 170-176 (1997) which describes the state of the art on this subject.
      <br/>
      It has already been proposed to stimulate simultaneously the right and left ventricles, which is known as a "double stimulation".
      <br/>
      This technique also can be applied to a double stimulation of the atria (i.e., the left and right atria).
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      One of difficulties of the known multisite stimulation is to guarantee the efficiency of the stimulation on the different cardiac sites.
      <br/>
      In particular, one generally observes different stimulation thresholds between the right site and the left site.
      <br/>
      This can result in a defective (e.g., insufficient) stimulation or an erroneous depolarization wave detection (i.e., confusion between an electro-stimulated depolarization originating at the one site and an indirectly sensed depolarization having its origin at the neighboring site).
      <br/>
      The latter is sometimes called a "far-field" detection.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      French patent FR 2 680 093 and its corresponding U.S. Pat. No. 5,411,533, commonly owned by the assignee of this invention, describe a device provided with an automatic adjustment of the stimulation impulse amplitude in relation to a determined capture threshold.
      <br/>
      This adjustment is obtained by a progressive reduction of the stimulation impulse amplitude level over several successive cardiac cycles, detection of the disappearance of the capture, and then reestablishment of the stimulation impulse amplitude at a level slightly greater than the threshold corresponding to the disappearance of capture.

      As is generally understood by persons skilled in the art, "capture" is a cardiac event where there is a depolarization following and responsive to delivery of a stimulation impulse.
      <br/>
      The "capture threshold" is the minimal voltage level of the stimulation impulse that causes capture, namely the desired depolarization of the cardiac tissue at the stimulation site.
    </p>
    <heading>OBJECTS AND SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="7">It is an object of the present invention, therefore, to remedy to this difficulty, by providing an automatic adjustment of the of stimulation impulse amplitude of the neighboring sites, e.g., the left site and the right site, in relation with the "capture threshold", that is to say the minimal level of voltage amplitude allowing for a capture on the considered site.</p>
    <p num="8">
      To this end, the invention broadly proposes an active implantable medical device of the aforementioned multisite type, that is to say in which electrodes are respectively placed at least two neighboring cardiac sites.
      <br/>
      Preferably, the two neighboring cardiac sites are either (1) at least one site in the right ventricle and one site in the left ventricle (also called the "right and left ventricular sites"), or (2) at least one site in the right atrium and one site in the left atrium (also called "the right and left atria sites") or (3) both (1) and (2).
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      These electrodes are respectively connected to one or more circuits for sensing the cardiac signal in order to detect a depolarization potential on the corresponding site(s), and to one or more stimulation circuits to apply, if necessary, a stimulation impulse on the same site(s).
      <br/>
      The device also comprises means to determine a capture threshold, and means to adjust the stimulation impulse amplitude in relation to the capture threshold, and means to fix a total refractory period comprising an absolute refractory period during which all detection is inhibited, followed by a relative refractory period.
    </p>
    <p num="10">According to the present invention, the detection of a depolarization during the relative refractory period marks the absence of a capture (also called a "loss of capture").</p>
    <p num="11">Very advantageously, it is foreseen to provide a means to adjust the instant of the beginning of the relative refractory period, preferably by a progressive increase of the relative refractory period duration over several successive cardiac cycles, until there is a detection of a depolarization in this relative refractory period, without any modification of the duration of the total refractory period.</p>
    <p num="12">Preferably, the duration of the total refractory period is constant and the initial duration of the relative refractory period is null (zero).</p>
    <p num="13">
      It also can be foreseen to provide a means of preliminary detection of the absence of extrasystolic activity, and to condition the implementation of the means for adjusting the stimulation amplitude on the detected absence of extrasystolic activity.
      <br/>
      The preliminary detection means preferably comprises means to evaluate the maximal time of synchronous depolarization of the two neighboring sites, namely the two ventricular sites and/or the two atrial sites.
    </p>
    <p num="14">Finally, to avoid a false detection, the device advantageously optionally comprises means for detecting a "bigeminy" condition, which is able to inhibit the adjustment of the stimulation impulse threshold, even in case of the detection of a depolarization during the relative refractory period.</p>
    <heading>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading>
    <p num="15">
      Further features, characteristics and advantages of the present invention will appear to the person of ordinary skill in the art in view of the following detailed description of a preferred, exemplary implementation of the invention, made with reference to the annexed drawings, in which:
      <br/>
      FIG. 1 shows schematically the division of the refractory period in an absolute part and a relative part, with a variable border (F) therebetween; and
      <br/>
      FIGS. 2 and 3 illustrate a flow chart implementating an algorithm for the automatic adjustment of the stimulation amplitude according to the present invention.
    </p>
    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading>
    <p num="16">An object of the invention, as indicated above, is to ensure the efficiency of the stimulation of the different sites in a multisite pacing system, by taking into account the fact that one observes, in general, different capture thresholds between the right site and the left site.</p>
    <p num="17">The following description refers to right and left ventricular sites (the detection of R waves), but it should be understood that the invention can be applied to the case of two neighboring (left and right) atrial sites, and notably to the case of so called "quadruple chamber" devices including a double ventricular and double atrial stimulation.</p>
    <p num="18">
      According to the invention, one divides the total refractory period PRT (the post-ventricular refractory period in the present example hereafter--the post-atrial refractory period in the case of the atria), into two sub-periods, namely an absolute refractory period PRA, followed by a relative refractory period PRR (FIG. 1).
      <br/>
      The total refractory period PRT is typically a known parameter of the pacemaker, and is generally fixed at a programmed value.
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      During the absolute refractory period PRA, no signal will be detected, regardless of the nature or the origin of the signal.
      <br/>
      This absolute refractory period PRA has to be at least equal to the recovery time TR of the sensing amplifiers, that is typically on the order 50 ms; on the other hand it does not have to be too long, which would risk not detecting possible ventricular extrasystoles, that necessitate the implementation of a particular analysis algorithm.
    </p>
    <p num="20">During the relative refractory period PRR, one will authorize an analysis of the ventricular depolarization for the purpose of the adjustment of stimulation impulse amplitude according to the invention; but a depolarization detected during this relative refractory period PRR will not serve to command delivery of a stimulation impulse (because this period remains a refractory period).</p>
    <p num="21">One is going now to describe the progress of the process of adjustment of the stimulation amplitude according to the invention, with reference to flow charts of FIGS. 2 and 3.</p>
    <p num="22">
      During an initialization phase (stage 10), with delivery of a maximal or programmed stimulation impulse energy, the pacemaker initializes the border F between absolute refractory period PRA and relative refractory period PRR to correspond to the initial duration of the total refractory period PRT and gradually displaces the border F to the left (in the direction of the arrow illustrated in FIG. 1) (stages 12 and 14).
      <br/>
      Typically, the duration of the total refractory period PRT covers the delay of amplifier recovery TR and the duration of the depolarization, which duration is typically initialized to a value greater than about 150 ms.
      <br/>
      The change in the border F results in a gradual increase of the relative refractory period PRR of an increment each cycle, e.g., 8 ms.
    </p>
    <p num="23">
      Furthermore, the multisite capture test is undertaken only if the sinus frequency is between the programmed base frequency and the programmed base frequency increased by 10% (for example), that is to say otherwise the patient is in a rest condition.
      <br/>
      This precaution, that the patient be at rest before conducting the test, is well known in algorithms of this type.
    </p>
    <p num="24">
      As soon as a detection appears in the interval of the relative refractory period PRR (stage 14), one memorizes (i.e., determines or measures and/or stores in memory) either (1) the time period T between a stimulation TSTIM and the following detection TDET as being the maximal time of synchronous depolarization of the two sites, or (2) the recovery time period of the amplifier TR, if the latter is longer (stage 16).
      <br/>
      The duration of the absolute refractory period PRA, that is to say in others terms, the position of the border F, is then fixed to a value slightly greater than the time period memorized, for example, an increment of 31 ms.
      <br/>
      The period corresponding to the difference between the programmed absolute refractory period PRA and the one that is determined in the initialization phase then becomes the relative refractory period PRR.
    </p>
    <p num="25">
      A second phase of capture research (stage 18) then begins.
      <br/>
      This phase will begin, however, only if one is sure that the patient has been free of all extrasystolic activity ESV during the last number of cycles, e.g., ten (10) cardiac cycles (stage 20).
      <br/>
      This is to avoid false detections.
      <br/>
      In other words, detection of extrasystolic activity during a given duration preceding the request to conduct a capture research will inhibit the redetermination of the stimulation amplitude until the condition of an absence of extrasystolic activity for the given duration (e.g., a number of cycles) is satisfied.
    </p>
    <p num="26">
      Referring to FIG. 3, if the capture research phase begins, one decreases the stimulation amplitude gradually (stage 22), in an iterative manner, until it is detected that one of the two ventricular sites no longer produces a capture.
      <br/>
      For this progressive diminution, it is important to be able to have small decrements, for example, of 0.1 V, which decrements are preferably uniform amounts from decrement to decrement.
    </p>
    <p num="27">
      Thus, in the case of progressively incrementing the relative refractory period from an initial duration of zero, if a ventricular detection R occurs in the relative refractory period PRR, after the absolute refractory period PRA (stage 24), then one has detected the highest threshold of the two cavities.
      <br/>
      In other words, as long as the capture of the two ventricles is guaranteed, one does not detect anything in the relative refractory period PRR.
      <br/>
      On the other hand, if a depolarization is detected in the relative refractory period PRR, it is a sign that there has been a loss of capture in one of the two ventricles, and this detection is the sign of a depolarization driven from one ventricle to the other.
    </p>
    <p num="28">Referring again to the example in the Figures, in the following cycle, the pacemaker re-establishes the maximal or the programmed amplitude (stage 28):</p>
    <p num="29">
      a) If an asynchronous R wave detection occurs (stage 30)--that is to say that even if one changes the amplitude of the stimulation impulse, it produces a second depolarization independently of this amplitude, the patient is in "bigeminy" condition (stage 32).
      <br/>
      A bigeminy condition has alternation between a cycle of normal activity and a cycle of an abnormal activity.
      <br/>
      It is in this case strongly probable that the detection of the preceding cycle was not linked to the threshold of capture, and one then waits until the end of the stimulation-detection sequence "R 1/2 "(stage 34) before resuming the test of capture (namely, the procedure returns to stage 18).
    </p>
    <p num="30">b) If no detection occurs in the ventricle (stage 30), then the pacemaker has found the highest capture thresholds of the two cavities, and the pacemaker programs the amplitude of stimulation A to be the threshold found increased by a margin of security, for example, 50% (stage 36).</p>
    <p num="31">c) If the detection has occurred out of the relative refractory period (stages 24 and 26), and in the absence of "bigeminy" (stages 38 to 44 are corresponding equivalents of stages 28 to 34), the pacemaker programs the amplitude of stimulation A to the detected threshold plus a margin of security, for example, 50% (stage 46).</p>
    <p num="32">Eventually, one can re-program the relative refractory period PRT to a duration T equal to the delay between stimulation and detection (TSTIM -TDET) plus 31 ms, the relative refractory period PRR being thus lengthened to minimize, if not avoid all risk of, false detection (the stimulation--detection delay T is memorized at stage 38).</p>
    <p num="33">The test of capture resumes then, in the same manner as set forth above, after N ventricular stimulation cycles (stages 50, 52, 54), N being a pre-programmed value, chosen to correspond to a duration, for example, of approximately six hours.</p>
    <p num="34">
      One skilled in the art will appreciation that the present invention can be practiced by other than the described embodiments, which are presented for purposes of illustration and not of limitation.
      <br/>
      For example, it is to be understood that the invention can be implimented in a software routine for a microprocessor controlled active implantable medical device, or in discreet analog and/or digital circuits for such devices.
      <br/>
      Well known circuits for stimulating cardiac activity, detecting cardiac activity (spontaneous and stimulated) including a capture, and measuring time intervals and processing the same, can be used as a matter of design choice.
      <br/>
      It also should be understood that the specific time periods described herein are merely exemplary, based on relative values corresponding to the times appropriate for use with desired or of normal cardiac behavior, and also are a matter of design choice.
