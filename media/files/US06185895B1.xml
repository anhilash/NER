    <heading>DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading>
    <p num="25">With reference now to the drawings, and in particular to FIGS. 1 through 5 thereof, a new ventilating radiant barrier embodying the principles and concepts of the present invention will be described.</p>
    <p num="26">
      As best illustrated in FIGS. 1 through 5, the ventilating radiant barrier generally comprises a panel that has a pair of faces, a pair of end edges and a pair of side edges extending between the end edges of the panel.
      <br/>
      A first of the faces of the panel that has a spaced apart pair of perforation rows extending between the end edges of the panel.
      <br/>
      The second face of the panel that has a spaced apart pair of perforation rows extending between the end edges of the panel.
      <br/>
      The perforation rows of the second face of the panel are positioned between the perforation rows of the first face of the panel.
    </p>
    <p num="27">
      In closer detail, the ventilating radiant barrier a generally rectangular panel 10 having a pair of substantially planar and generally rectangular faces 11,12, a pair of generally straight end edges 13,14 and a pair of generally straight side edges 15,16 extending between the end edges of the panel.
      <br/>
      The end edges of the panel are preferably extended substantially parallel to one another.
      <br/>
      The side edges of the panel are preferably extended substantially parallel to one another and substantially perpendicular to the end edges of the panel.
      <br/>
      The panel preferably comprises a foamed insulating material.
      <br/>
      A first face 11 of the pair of the faces of the panel preferably has a heat reflecting surface substantially covering the first face of the panel.
      <br/>
      Ideally, as best illustrated in FIG. 4, the heat reflecting surface of the first face of the panel comprises a metallic foil outer layer 17 provided on the first face of the panel.
      <br/>
      The panel preferably has a thickness defined between the faces of the panel between about 1/4 inch and 3 inches.
      <br/>
      Ideally, the thickness of the panel is about 1/2 inch.
    </p>
    <p num="28">
      The first face of the panel that has a spaced apart and substantially parallel pair of perforation rows 18,19 each comprising a plurality of perforation extending between the end edges of the panel.
      <br/>
      A first perforation row of the first face of the panel is positioned adjacent a first of the side edges of the panel while, similarly, a second perforation row of the first face of the panel is positioned adjacent a second of the side edges of the panel.
      <br/>
      As best illustrated in FIG. 4, the first face of the panel is cut along each of the perforation rows of the first face of the panel to form a pair of outer fold lines 20 on a second of the faces of the panel extending between the end edges of the panel.
    </p>
    <p num="29">
      Similarly, the second face of the panel that has a spaced apart and substantially parallel pair of perforations rows 21 each comprising a plurality of perforation extending between the end edges of the panel.
      <br/>
      The perforation rows of the second face of the panel are positioned between the outer fold lines of the panel.
      <br/>
      A first perforation row of the second face of the panel is positioned adjacent a first of the outer fold lines of the panel and a second perforation row of the second face of the panel is positioned adjacent a second of the outer fold lines of the panel.
      <br/>
      Like the first face, the second face of the panel is cut along each of the perforation rows of the second face of the panel to form a pair of inner fold lines 22 on the second face of the panel extending between the end edges of the panel as shown in FIG. 4.
    </p>
    <p num="30">
      These perforation line defined a plurality of strips on the panel extending between end edges of the panel.
      <br/>
      This plurality of strips includes a pair of outer strips 23,24 and a pair of inner strips 25,26.
      <br/>
      A first of the outer strips is defined between the first side edge and the first outer fold line and a second of the outer strips is defined between the second side edge and the second outer fold line.
      <br/>
      A first of the inner strips is defined between the first outer fold line and the first inner fold line and a second of the inner strips is defined between the second outer fold line and the second inner fold line.
    </p>
    <p num="31">
      The inner and outer fold lines adjacent each side edge of the panel are folded accordion fashion (FIG. 4) such that each adjacent pair of inner and outer strips are stacked on the first face of the panel to form a pair of stacks 27,28 (FIG. 3) on the first face of the panel with the inner strips positioned adjacent the first face of the panel in each of the stacks.
      <br/>
      The panel that has a pair of substantially inner sides 29 extending between the end edges of the panel when the inner and outer strips of the panel are formed in the stacks.
      <br/>
      Each stack has a thickness about two times the thickness of the panel.
      <br/>
      Ideally, the thickness of each stack is about 1 inch.
    </p>
    <p num="32">
      A roof structure comprising a plurality of spaced apart and substantially parallel rafters 30,31, a roof decking 32 coupled to the rafters, a plurality of shingles 33 covering the roof decking.
      <br/>
      In use, the panel is positioned between an adjacent pair of rafters such that the first face of the panel faces the roof decking.
      <br/>
      As best illustrated in FIG. 3, the outer strip in each stack of strips abuts an interior surface of the roof decking so that the first face of panel is spaced apart from the roof decking the thickness of the stacks.
    </p>
    <p num="33">
      Each adjacent pair of rafters has a spacing width defined therebetween.
      <br/>
      The panel that has an inner width defined between the inner fold lines of the panel.
      <br/>
      Ideally, the inner width of the panel is slightly less than the spacing width between the adjacent pair of rafters.
      <br/>
      This way, one of the inner sides of the panel abuts one of the rafters of the adjacent pair of rafters and the other of the inner sides of the panel abuts the other of the rafters of the adjacent pair of rafters such that the panel is frictionally held in position between the adjacent pair of rafters.
      <br/>
      In typical constructions the spacing width between rafters is either about 16 inches or about 24 and therefore, in an ideal illustrative embodiment, the inner width the panel should be slightly less than about 16 inches or slightly less than about 24 inches accordingly.
    </p>
    <p num="34">
      A layer of batting-type insulation 34 such as fiberglass batting insulation is positioned between the adjacent pair of rafters.
      <br/>
      The layer of batting-type insulation abuts the second face of the panel such that the panel is interposed between the roof decking and the layer of batting-type of insulation.
      <br/>
      A paper insulating backing sheet 35 is coupled to the layer of batting-type of insulation on a surface of the layer of batting-type of insulation opposite the panel such that the layer of batting-type of insulation is interposed between the panel and the backing sheet.
      <br/>
      A gypsum board 36 may then be coupled to the rafters so that the panel, the layer of batting-type of insulation, and the back sheet are interposed between the roof decking and the gypsum board.
    </p>
    <p num="35">
      As to a further discussion of the manner of usage and operation of the present invention, the same should be apparent from the above description.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, no further discussion relating to the manner of usage and operation will be provided.
    </p>
    <p num="36">With respect to the above description then, it is to be realized that the optimum dimensional relationships for the parts of the invention, to include variations in size, materials, shape, form, function and manner of operation, assembly and use, are deemed readily apparent and obvious to one skilled in the art, and all equivalent relationships to those illustrated in the drawings and described in the specification are intended to be encompassed by the present invention.</p>
    <p num="37">
      Therefore, the foregoing is considered as illustrative only of the principles of the invention.
      <br/>
      Further, since numerous modifications and changes will readily occur to those skilled in the art, it is not desired to limit the invention to the exact construction and operation shown and described, and accordingly, all suitable modifications and equivalents may be resorted to, falling within the scope of the invention.
