    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">
      The present invention relates to the field of information storage and retrieval using integrated circuit technology.
      <br/>
      More specifically, the present invention relates to techniques for storing (and retrieving) analog or digital data, or both, within an integrated circuit using multilevel nonvolatile cells.
    </p>
    <p num="3">
      Among the most important and pioneering innovations in history are devices, techniques, and mediums that have been devised to record and playback sights, sounds, actions, and other information.
      <br/>
      Many of these innovations have led to the rise and growth of the media and entertainment industries, and also the personal and consumer electronics industries.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      For example, among the most notable inventions are Thomas Alva Edison's phonograph and record with which Edison recorded and played his first recording "Mary Had a Little Lamb." Other achievements in this field are the audio tape recorder, cassette tape recorder, motion picture, talking motion picture ("talkies"), video cassette recorder (VCR), compact disc (CD and CD-ROM), video disc, digital video disc (DVD), and many, many more of such innovations.
      <br/>
      In the present day, full-length motion pictures with stereo sound may be contained on a single optical disk.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      Although these technologies have met with substantial success, there is a continuing desire to improve on the techniques, devices, mediums used to record information.
      <br/>
      For example, there is a need to provide techniques that provide dense storage of information.
      <br/>
      Denser storage facilitates storing information in a compact area, and provides a relatively long recording time.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      There is a need to provide reliable and robust techniques.
      <br/>
      The stored reproduction should be a faithful reproduction of the original information.
      <br/>
      Despite repeated use, the stored reproduction should retain its original form, and also not degrade over time.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, the techniques should be compatible with and interface easily with present and emerging technologies in electronics and with devices facilitating electronic commerce (such as the Internet and World Wide Web).
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      Integrated circuit technology has been used to implement many electronic devices including computers, video recorders, digital cameras, microprocessors, DRAMs, SRAMs, Flash memory, and many others.
      <br/>
      As integrated technology continues to improve, it becomes practical to use this technology to record and playback sights, sounds, actions, and other information.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      Data has typically been stored within integrated circuits using a digital or binary format.
      <br/>
      For applications where the input is analog, however, this requires conversion of signals to digital format, generally by an analog-to-digital (A/D) converter or similar means.
      <br/>
      And playback of analog signal from a digital storage format may require a digital-to-analog (D/A) converter or similar means.
      <br/>
      As can be appreciated, these conversions add complexity and extra expense to the entire procedure.
      <br/>
      Further, a conversion of the signal to digital form quantizes the signal and will lead to quantization noise in the reproduced signal.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      Information such as sounds and voices, stereo and multichannel sounds, pictures, video, and others requires many bits of data storage.
      <br/>
      Storage of data in digital format may be inefficient because one bit (i.e., two different levels) of data is stored in a single memory cell.
      <br/>
      Further, it may be desirable to store an input signal using a sampling rate the user selects.
    </p>
    <p num="10">Therefore, techniques are needed for compactly storing (and retrieving) analog and digital information including sights, sounds, and actions using integrated circuit technology.</p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="11">
      The present invention provides an integrated circuit memory capable of storing analog information.
      <br/>
      This integrated circuit may be referred to as an analog memory.
      <br/>
      The integrated circuit has nonvolatile memory cells capable of multilevel or analog voltage level storage.
      <br/>
      In addition to being able to store analog signals in analog form, the integrated circuit can also be used to store digital information in digital form.
      <br/>
      An analog input signal or other data is input to the integrated circuit and is sampled a sampling rate that is user selectable.
      <br/>
      Each sample of the input signal is stored in a memory cell.
      <br/>
      The analog signal is stored without the need for analog-to-digital (A/D) conversion.
      <br/>
      The analog input signal may be from a transducer which converts images, sound, actions, or other real world information into analog electrical impulse.
    </p>
    <p num="12">
      The integrated circuit memory has an internal signal path that is differential.
      <br/>
      This enhances the precision with which the signal is stored in the memory cells.
      <br/>
      Among other advantages a fully differential signal pass has inherently an improved common-mode noise rejection.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, the dynamic range is doubled which may lead to a higher signal to noise ratio and is suitable for low voltage applications.
      <br/>
      To store analog information the analog input to the integrated circuit has a positive (+) and negative (-) input.
      <br/>
      The analog input is connected to a preamplifier to amplify the input signal.
      <br/>
      The preamplifier is fully differential and has a positive and negative output.
      <br/>
      The preamplifier output is connected to a low pass filter.
      <br/>
      The filter has positive and negative outputs.
      <br/>
      These positive and negative outputs are connected to level shifter circuitry.
      <br/>
      The level shifter performs a sample and hold operation, an amplification, a voltage shift, and a differential to single ended conversion.
    </p>
    <p num="13">
      The stored analog information is retrieved by means of a slow ramp circuit.
      <br/>
      The playback level shifter takes the single-ended output of the slow ramp circuit and performs a voltage shift, an attenuation, and a single ended to fully differential conversion.
      <br/>
      The differential playback level shifter output is connected to a low pass filter, which is fully differential.
      <br/>
      The low pass filter has positive and negative outputs.
      <br/>
      These are connected to an output buffer or amplifier to amplify the signal.
      <br/>
      The output amplifier is also fully differential and provides positive and negative outputs.
    </p>
    <p num="14">
      The integrated circuit has a master-slave biasing scheme.
      <br/>
      A master bias generator generates a master bias voltage that is connected to a number of slave bias generators.
      <br/>
      This master bias voltage may be based on a bandgap voltage reference.
      <br/>
      The slave bias generators use the master bias voltage to generate a number of slave bias voltages.
      <br/>
      These slave bias voltages are connected to the various components of the integrated circuit.
      <br/>
      This scheme of connecting different slave bias generators to different components improve the isolation of the bias voltages among the components.
      <br/>
      It is less likely that components which couple noise into its slave bias generator will affect the other components connected to different slave bias generators.
      <br/>
      Also, if a component of the integrated circuit is not being used, its slave bias generator can be disabled to save power.
    </p>
    <p num="15">
      The integrated circuit has a squelch circuit to attenuate its output signal when an input to the squelch circuit is below threshold level.
      <br/>
      The squelch circuit essentially greatly attenuates background noise.
      <br/>
      In effect, there will be a greater signal to noise ratio at the output of the integrated circuit.
    </p>
    <p num="16">
      In an embodiment, the invention is an integrated circuit including an analog data differential input and a preamplifier circuit.
      <br/>
      The preamplifier circuit is connected to amplify an analog signal at the analog data differential input with a first gain, where an amplified output signal is provided at a first differential output of the preamplifier circuit.
      <br/>
      A low pass filter circuit is connected to the preamplifier differential output.
      <br/>
      The low pass filter circuit provides samples of the analog signal at a second differential output.
      <br/>
      A first level shifter circuit is connected to the second differential output, where the first level shifter circuit provides a first level shifter output signal at a first offset voltage above a level of a sample at the second differential output.
      <br/>
      The first level shifter output is connected to an array of analog memory cells.
    </p>
    <p num="17">
      In another embodiment, the invention is an integrated circuit including an array of analog memory cells and a ramp circuit connected to a memory cell of the array.
      <br/>
      The ramp circuit determines a stored threshold voltage of the memory cell.
      <br/>
      A playback level shifter is connected to a ramp output of the ramp circuit, where the playback level shifter provides a first differential output coupled to an output of the integrated circuit.

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
    <p num="20">
      FIG. 1 shows an electronic system in which techniques according to the present invention may be used.
      <br/>
      An integrated circuit according to the present invention may be used in many market segments including, to name a few, the communications market, medical market, consumer market, and industrial market.
      <br/>
      Some applications of such devices include cellular phones, telephone answer machines, mobile radios, telephone announcement systems, pagers and voice pagers, medical monitoring equipment, cash registers, bar code readers, vending machines, security systems, instrumentations, automobiles, interactive media, cameras, calculators, pocket recorders, recordable postcards and greeting cards, toys and games, watches and clocks, consumer recording media, video players and recorders, imaging, personal digital assistants (PDAs), palm-sized PC, desktop and notebook computers, portable electronic commerce devices, internet appliances, electronic information storage media, and many other applications.

    <p num="21">
      FIG. 2 shows an overall flow diagram of a technique for storing or "recording" an analog signal input into a memory cell.
      <br/>
      An analog signal input 210 is provided.
      <br/>
      This analog signal may be amplified or otherwise processed, if desired or needed.
      <br/>
      In step 220, the signal is filtered using a low pass or bandpass filter to filter out or eliminate components of the signal which are not of interest.
      <br/>
      This can help prevent aliasing.
      <br/>
      Multiple stages of filtering can be used.
    </p>
    <p num="22">
      In step 230, the signal is sampled.
      <br/>
      Sampling the signal breaks the signal into a series of discrete analog values or samples.
      <br/>
      In order to prevent aliasing, the signal should be sampled at a rate sufficient to prevent aliasing errors.
      <br/>
      According to Nyquist's Sampling Theorem, the signal should be sampled at a rate at least twice the highest frequency component of the signal output from the filter to allow for a faithful reproduction of the original signal.
      <br/>
      Further, it is desirable to sample the signal at a much higher rate in order to obtain better bandwidth, and hence, a better quality reproduction.
    </p>
    <p num="23">
      A sampled data point is "held" for sufficient time to process this data point.
      <br/>
      The sampled data point may also be held while determining the next sampled data point.
      <br/>
      In a step 240, for each sampled data point, the analog value is level shifted into a voltage range suitable to facilitate storage of the information in a memory cell.
      <br/>
      For example, an analog input in the range from about 0 volts to about 2.5 volts may be shifted to a range from about 3 volts to about 5.5 volts.
    </p>
    <p num="24">In a step 250, the sampled data point is stored into a memory cell.</p>
    <p num="25">
      FIG. 3 shows a flow diagram of a technique for reproducing or "playing back" an analog signal stored in a memory cell.
      <br/>
      The playback process is essentially an inverse of the recording process.
      <br/>
      There may also be amplification or other processing of the output signal.
    </p>
    <p num="26">
      FIG. 4A shows a diagram of an overall block diagram of an integrated circuit 400 of the present invention.
      <br/>
      This integrated circuit stores information in the analog or multilevel memory cells of the integrated circuit.
      <br/>
      The information may be provided in analog or digital form.
      <br/>
      An analog signal 402 to be stored is differentially input at ANAIN+ and ANAIN- inputs.
      <br/>
      Other embodiments may have a single-ended input instead of a differential input.
      <br/>
      A differential input provides greater accuracy when recording the signal.
      <br/>
      The input signal is amplified using a preamplifier 405.
      <br/>
      For example, in one implementation, the preamplifier has a gain of about 25 decibels.
      <br/>
      The gain can be user-selected so the user can match the preamplification needed or desired for a particular input signal.
    </p>
    <p num="27">
      An output 408 of preamplifier 405 is also fully differential.
      <br/>
      A single-ended output can also be provided in addition or instead of the differential output.
      <br/>
      Output 408 is passed to a low pass filter 411.
      <br/>
      Low pass filter 411 can be implemented using a sampled data filter, where the output of filter 411 will be the samples of the input signal.
    </p>
    <p num="28">
      Using a write circuit 414, each sampled data point is stored in a memory cell 412.
      <br/>
      Memory cells such as DRAM, SRAM, EEPROM, EPROM, and Flash cells typically only store or can represent two possible logic levels.
      <br/>
      In a digital system, these levels would represent a logic low or a logic high.
      <br/>
      To store a sampled data point in a digital memory cell, the sampled data point is converted into a binary or digital representation.
      <br/>
      For example, if the sampled data point were converted to a value having 256 different discrete levels, then 8 binary memory cells (i.e., 28) are required.
      <br/>
      However, storing a sampled data signal is inefficient because numerous memory cells are used to store only one sample.
    </p>
    <p num="29">
      In the present invention, however, the sampled data point is stored in a single analog or multilevel memory cell.
      <br/>
      This permits much greater density of storage compared to the binary memory cell.
      <br/>
      Using the memory cell techniques of the present invention, integrated circuits can be designed to store data more compactly than integrated circuits using binary memory cells.
      <br/>
      Techniques of the present invention are also applicable to allow a single digital memory cell to store multiple digital bits by using multilevel storage.
    </p>
    <p num="30">
      The memory cell of the present invention may be referred as an analog or multilevel memory cell since the memory cell can store a relatively large range of analog and digital values.
      <br/>
      The analog values can be thought of as having discrete steps such as, for example, 10 millivolt steps.
      <br/>
      In other embodiments, the analog values are essentially continuous.
      <br/>
      Although an analog memory cell can store an analog (or digital value), a degree of precision for such a memory cell can be quantified by the number of discrete steps the memory cell can store.
      <br/>
      Higher resolutions for an individual memory cell are limited by the process technology.
      <br/>
      Such factors including memory cell's charge, the charge on an electron, leakage to and from the memory cell, and accuracy of other support circuitry are important considerations.
    </p>
    <p num="31">
      Analog and digital storage of data is described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,694,356, 5,680,341, 5,745,409, 5,748,534, 5,748,533, 5,818,757, and U.S. patent application Ser.

      No. 09/324,902, filed Jun. 2, 1999, which are all incorporated by reference.
    </p>
    <p num="32">
      In a specific embodiment of the present invention, the analog or multilevel memory cells are implemented using Flash or EEPROM cells.
      <br/>
      Flash or EEPROM cells are memory transistors with a floating gate, and may be referred to as a floating gate device.
      <br/>
      Flash and EEPROM cells are nonvolatile.
      <br/>
      Once programmed or configured, these floating gate devices will hold their data even when power is removed.
      <br/>
      The Flash or EEPROM transistor can be n-channel or p-channel; n-channel floating gate devices are presently more widely available.
    </p>
    <p num="33">
      Flash and EEPROM cells are configured or programmed by altering a threshold voltage or VT of the device.
      <br/>
      Floating gate devices can have a range of stored VTs.
      <br/>
      This range of stored VTs is used to provide analog or multilevel storage.
      <br/>
      Flash and EEPROM cells can also be erased; the VTs are returned to an initialized state.
    </p>
    <p num="34">
      In an embodiment of the invention, the degree of precision for storing information in a memory cell is selected by the design to be appropriate for a particular application.
      <br/>
      The degree of precision can be a user-selectable option.
      <br/>
      For example, when storing voice signals, relatively less precision is needed since the human voice is understandable and recognizable when less resolution is employed.
      <br/>
      For human voice, the memory cell can be designed to store about 28 or 256 levels.
      <br/>
      For some applications, such as high-resolution color images, photographs, and video, greater precision is typically needed for an accurate reproduction.
      <br/>
      The memory cell or multiple memory cells used in conjunction with another can be designed to store effectively 224 or 16,777,216 levels in order to produce the colors accurately.
      <br/>
      The memory cell or cells will effectively store 216 or 65,536 levels if less color accuracy is acceptable.
    </p>
    <p num="35">
      In short, the memory cell or multiple memory cells of the present invention can be designed to store any number of data levels, for example, 28, 210, and 212 or more levels.
      <br/>
      Other numbers of levels are also possible.
      <br/>
      A greater number of levels permits greater compression of data into a fewer number of memory cells.
      <br/>
      The greater number of levels each memory cell is capable of storing, the more data that can be stored in an array of these memory cells.
      <br/>
      The ultimate precision of the memory cell available with the analog memory cell depends on many factors such as the process technology used and stability and speed of the circuitry used to store and resolve the different levels.
    </p>
    <p num="36">
      Using present technology, it is practical to implement an integrated circuit according to the present invention having memory cells, each capable of storing about 28 levels.
      <br/>
      A memory cell with 8 bits of resolution is readily manufacturable and can be easily interfaced with and processed using the circuitry of the present invention.
      <br/>
      Further, a memory cell with 8-bit resolution provides adequate resolution for recording and playback of voice data with a relatively high fidelity.
      <br/>
      As technology further improves, the present invention may be used to provide an interface with memory cells having greater than 8-bit resolution.
    </p>
    <p num="37">
      Furthermore, instead of storing a data sample of the input signal into a single cell, multiple cells of the present invention can be combined to increase the resolution.
      <br/>
      Additional cells are added until the desired resolution is achieved.
      <br/>
      Generally the relationship for providing greater resolution by using multiple cells is given by 2n*m, where n is the number of memory cells and m is the bit resolution per cell.
      <br/>
      For example, three cells having 10-bit resolution each can be combined to have an effective resolution of 30 bits.
      <br/>
      The number of bits resolution for multiple 10-bit cells is given by the following relationship, 2n*10, where n is the number of cells.
      <br/>
      As a further example, for three cells each having 8-bit resolution, the combined effective resolution is 24 bits (i.e., 2n*8 where n is 3).
      <br/>
      This particular implementation may be useful for imaging applications, where each cell corresponds to the intensity of one of the red (R), green (G), and blue (B) parameters.
    </p>
    <p num="38">
      Although sometimes referred to as an analog memory cell, the memory cell of the present invention can also be used for applications other than analog applications.
      <br/>
      For analog applications, analog values are stored into the memory cell without the need for an analog-to-digital converter.
      <br/>
      The memory cell can also be used in digital applications.
      <br/>
      The analog memory cell capable of storing multiple or continuous levels is equally well suited for digital and analog applications.
      <br/>
      For digital applications, the techniques of the present invention will permit much more compact storage of digital data.
      <br/>
      For example, the present invention can be used to implement nonvolatile mass storage PCMCIA or PC Cards.
      <br/>
      This permits an analog memory integrated circuit to be relatively compact.
      <br/>
      For digital applications, discrete levels may be stored, and an A/D and D/A converter may be utilized.
      <br/>
      Other techniques for storing and retrieving data from analog memory cells are described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,638,320, 5,687,115, 5,694,356, and 5,748,533, which are incorporated by reference.

      FIG. 5 shows an example of a portion of an integrated circuit of the present invention for storing digital information.
      <br/>
      The circuitry of the integrated circuitry is similar to what is shown in FIG. 4.
      <br/>
      In addition to an array 490 of analog memory cells for storing digital or analog information, there is a D/A converter 493 and A/D converter 495.
      <br/>
      To store digital data, D/A converter 493 takes digital information on input 497 and converts this to multilevel or analog information for storage in array 490.
      <br/>
      To retrieve digital data, A/D converter 495 takes the multilevel or analog information stored in array 490 and converts it to digital data on output 499.
      <br/>
      Input 497 may be in the form of parallel or serial bits of data.
      <br/>
      Output 499 can be in the form of parallel or serial bits of data.
    </p>
    <p num="40">
      Returning to FIG. 4, memory cells are organized in an array 416 of memory cells having rows and columns.
      <br/>
      In a specific embodiment, there are about 1.92 million analog or multilevel memory cells.
      <br/>
      With 1.92 million memory cells, this will store about eight minutes of voice data at a 4 kilohertz sampling frequency.
      <br/>
      An integrated circuit embodiment with 1.92 million memory cells is a practical implementation of the present invention using present technology.
      <br/>
      Clearly, an integrated circuit having fewer than 1.92 million memory cells is also be easily manufacturable.
      <br/>
      For example, a reduced-size version of the present invention having 960K memory cells provides half the data storage capacity.
      <br/>
      Given the size of the memory cell of the present invention and the desire to provide a large amount of storage at reasonable cost, an integrated circuit with 1.92 million analog memory cells (e.g., fabricated using Flash technology) is practical.
      <br/>
      As technology improves and memory transistor sizes decrease, it will become possible, and practical, to manufacture integrated circuits having greater than 1.92 million memory cells.
      <br/>
      Rows and columns are addressable by row and column addresses and a row decoder 420 and column decoder 424.
      <br/>
      A master control circuit 429 controls operation of the integrated circuit.
      <br/>
      External or off-chip connections to the master control circuit are made via pins /RESET, BUSY, SAC, /INT, DO, DI, /CS, and SCLK.
    </p>
    <p num="41">
      Operation of the integrated circuit is controlled by the master control circuit.
      <br/>
      Commands or instructions are input to the master control circuit, which will then perform the desired function.
      <br/>
      Some of the functions the integrated circuit provides includes record, playback, cue, and erase.
      <br/>
      In this implementation, the command and data for the command is clocked into the device in serial form using the DI and SCLK pins.
      <br/>
      If there is output data, it is clocked out, also in serial form, through DO.
      <br/>
      The command interface to the integrated circuit is referred to as a serial port interface (SPI).
      <br/>
      The commands are referred to as SPI commands.
      <br/>
      More details of the SPI interface may be found in U.S. provisional application Ser.

      Information stored in array 416 is read or played back using a read circuit 435.
      <br/>
      Read circuit 435 is functionally the inverse of write circuit 414.
      <br/>
      An output of the read circuit has a one-to-one correspondence to the original analog value that was stored in the memory cell using the write circuit.
      <br/>
      The output is passed through a low pass filter 440 to reconstruct the original waveform.
      <br/>
      If recording and playback do not occur at the same time, low pass filter 440 and low pass filter 411 may be implemented using the same on-chip circuit to reduce die size.
      <br/>
      Multiplexers will select whether the low pass filter is coupled to the recording or the playback circuitry.
      <br/>
      This reduces the die size since the same circuitry is used for these two purposes.
      <br/>
      Another benefit of using the same filter is there will be better matching of the electrical characteristics for both recording and playback.

    <p num="43">
      In the particular embodiment of FIG. 4, there is a squelch circuit 445 before an AUDOUT pin or differential ANAOUT+ and ANAOUT- pins.
      <br/>
      The squelch circuit will give the user an impression of a greater signal-to-noise ratio at the output, much like the squelch function of radio receivers or some two-way radios.
      <br/>
      The user sets a particular delay by placing a particular size of capacitor at a SQLCAP input.
      <br/>
      When the signal input to the squelch circuit is above a certain threshold level which is set by squelch circuit 445, the stored signal is output at AUDOUT or ANAOUT+ and ANAOUT-. However, if the signal drops below this squelch threshold level for a period of time set by the value of the capacitor, the output is a greatly attenuated version of the originally stored signal.
      <br/>
      The squelch feature can be used to reduce undesirable background noise from the output.
      <br/>
      Although a squelch feature is provided in FIG. 4, other embodiments of the invention may not include this squelch feature and the associated circuitry.

      <br/>
      In a specific embodiment, when a signal is being recorded at inputs ANAIN+ and ANAIN-, the signal may be monitored at ANAOUT+ and ANAOUT- and AUDOUT pins.

      This monitor feature can be used by a user to ensure the circuitry is operating properly.

    <p num="45">
      A clock for low pass filter 411, write circuit 414, read circuit 435, and low pass filter 440, is selected using a multiplexer 460.
      <br/>
      The clock is either internally generated or provided by an external source.
      <br/>
      This clock provides the sampling frequency at which the analog input is sampled.
      <br/>
      The clock is supplied from a programmable internal oscillator 466 or a programmable divider 471, which is connected to an external clock source EXTCLK.
      <br/>
      The SCLK input may also be selected to provide the clock during operations such as testing.
      <br/>
      In a specific embodiment, programmable internal clock 466 is implemented using a relaxation oscillator and a delay locked loop (DLL) frequency synthesizer.
      <br/>
      However, there are many other techniques to implement the programmable internal clock including a delay, a phase locked loop (PLL), phase frequency loop (PFL), crystal oscillator, and frequency synthesizer.
    </p>
    <p num="46">
      The clock from multiplexer 460 is used to control the sampling frequency of the input waveform.
      <br/>
      Internal oscillator 466 generates a range of clock frequencies.
      <br/>
      For example, internal oscillator may be used to generate a clock frequency from about 4 kilohertz to about 8 kilohertz.
      <br/>
      Depending on the desired application, the frequency ranges may vary.
      <br/>
      The internal oscillator may generate frequencies from the hundreds of kilohertz to the megahertz ranges.
      <br/>
      The user can select the frequency of the internal oscillator.
      <br/>
      To permit even greater flexibility, an external clock source input through the EXTCLK pin can be used instead of the internal oscillator.
      <br/>
      This external clock source is frequency divided using programmable divider 471.
      <br/>
      The user can change the divider ratio to change the frequency of the clock without changing the EXTCLK.
    </p>
    <p num="47">
      Therefore, in the present invention, the user can select the sampling frequency.
      <br/>
      In a specific embodiment of the present invention, the user can select a 4 kilohertz, 5.3 kilohertz, 6.4 kilohertz, or 8 kilohertz sampling frequency.
      <br/>
      The internal oscillator is programmable to provide a range of sampling frequencies.
      <br/>
      And, an even greater range of sampling frequencies is available by having the user supply an external clock.
      <br/>
      This permits the user to control the bandwidth of the signal that is recorded.
      <br/>
      If the user desires greater bandwidth, the user will select a higher sampling frequency.
      <br/>
      A higher sampling frequency also means there will be a greater number of sampled data points, which will require a greater number of memory cells for storage for a given duration of a signal.
    </p>
    <p num="48">
      The programmable internal frequency generator and provision for an external clock source are features of the present invention.
      <br/>
      The user can vary the sampling rate as desired, and as can be appreciated, this provides greater flexibility than a integrated circuit having a fixed sampling frequency.
      <br/>
      In an integrated circuit that only provides a fixed sampling frequency, when different sampling frequencies are desired by customers, there would have to be different versions of the same integrated circuit.
      <br/>
      The user-selectable sampling rate permits the same integrated circuit to be used in various applications.
      <br/>
      The manufacturer of the integrated circuit does not need to fabricate different parts for different customers and applications.
      <br/>
      And, the customer or user does not need to stock different parts having different sampling frequencies.
    </p>
    <p num="49">
      An aspect of the present invention is that as the sampling is increased, the integrated circuit will record at a higher bandwidth, but the maximum duration of the recording will be less.
      <br/>
      If the user selects a sampling rate of 2000 samples per second, this gives a recording time of about 960 seconds or 16 minutes of recording time for 1.92 million cells.
      <br/>
      If the user selects a sampling rate of 8000 samples per second, this results in about 240 seconds or 4 minutes of recording time.
      <br/>
      Using a sampling rate of 8 kilohertz will provide a higher quality recording of the original signal than the case when using a 4 kilohertz sampling rate.

      FIG. 6 shows a block diagram of circuitry for implementing a user-selectable sampling frequency feature of the present invention.
      <br/>
      A feature of the present invention is to provide a user-selectable or user-controllable sampling frequency that can be dynamically changed.
      <br/>
      The sampling frequency can be changed while the integrated circuit is operating.
      <br/>
      The user-selected sampling frequency will be used for recording or playback, or both.
      <br/>
      The sampling frequency may be dynamically changed during the recording or playback operation.
      <br/>
      The sampling frequency can be changed while the memory integrated circuit remains resident on a printed circuit board.
      <br/>
      The user's selection of the sampling frequency is stored internally in the integrated circuit: there is no need to change external components such as the value of an external resistor or capacitor to change the sampling frequency.
      <br/>
      The user configures the analog memory integrated circuit to use the user-selected sampling frequency.
      <br/>
      This selection can be held in logic, volatile, or nonvolatile storage circuitry on the integrated circuit.
      <br/>
      As discussed above, a sampling clock output 625 is provided to internal circuits on the integrated circuit such as the read and write circuitry.
      <br/>
      The source of this sampling clock output may be from an external clock input pad 630, where the user provides an external clock frequency fext.
      <br/>
      Or, the source may be from an internal oscillator 634, providing an internal sampling frequency fint.
      <br/>
      In a specific embodiment of the present invention, fint is 4096 kilohertz, although other frequencies may be used.
    </p>
    <p num="51">
      Although the FIG. 6 implementation provides both internal and external frequencies, in other embodiments, only the internal or external frequencies are provided.
      <br/>
      For example, the integrated circuit can include only a programmable internal oscillator and not provide for input of an external clock frequency, or vice versa.
    </p>
    <p num="52">
      The internal sampling clock fint or external sampling frequency fext is selected by a switch 638 to be passed to sampling clock output 625.
      <br/>
      An output from switch 638 can be further amplified using a buffer 642, if desired or needed.
      <br/>
      Switch 638 can be implemented using one of the many techniques to design a switch on an electronic device.
      <br/>
      For example, switch 638 can be a multiplexer implemented with pass gates or logic gates.
      <br/>
      An alternative to a multiplexer is a summing amplifier, where the unselected signal is set to zero.
    </p>
    <p num="53">
      The control 650 of switch 638 can come from various sources.
      <br/>
      The switch may be controlled by user-programmed cells such as Flash, EEPROM, EPROM, antifuses, SRAM, DRAM, laser trimmable bits, and other similar technologies.
      <br/>
      For example, the user can specify the use of the internal or external clock through the SPI interface.
      <br/>
      In the embodiment of FIG. 6, an activity detector 648 controls switch 638.
      <br/>
      Activity detector 648 is coupled to pad 630 and provides an output 650 to switch 638 to detect and indicate whether there is activity at pad 630.
      <br/>
      If no clock frequency is detected at pad 630, switch 638 will select the internal oscillator path.
      <br/>
      No clock frequency is detected at pad 630 when, for example, pad 630 is set at ground, VDD, or another voltage.
      <br/>
      However, if a clock frequency is detected at pad 630, switch 638 will select the external clock path.
      <br/>
      This feature of the present invention allows a user to use an external sampling frequency without the need to additionally configure special bits to so indicate.
    </p>
    <p num="54">
      The external sampling frequency is provided at pad 630.
      <br/>
      This signal may be amplified by a buffer 655 (if desired or needed).
      <br/>
      Then, fext is coupled to a prescaler circuit 658 that adjusts fext based on a control logic circuit 661.
      <br/>
      For example, the prescaler circuit frequency divides the fext frequency by an amount the user desires.
      <br/>
      The user provides information on how much to frequency divide to the control logic circuit.
      <br/>
      This information may be provided by using the SPI interface discussed in a section of U.S. provisional application Ser.
      <br/>
      No. 60/091,326, filed Jun. 30, 1998. In a specific embodiment, an output of the prescaler circuit is a sampling frequency that is 128 times the user-desired or user-selected sampling frequency fsamp.
    </p>
    <p num="55">
      Internal oscillator 634 is coupled to an internal clock divider 667 that frequency divides fint.
      <br/>
      Similar as to the case for prescaler 658, the amount of frequency division for internal clock divider 667 is user-selectable and controlled by control logic circuit 661.
      <br/>
      The user can select the divider ratio through the SPI interface.
      <br/>
      Also, in a specific embodiment of the invention, an output of internal clock divider 667 will be 128 times the user-desired sampling frequency.
    </p>
    <p num="56">
      The user's selection of the internal sampling frequency is stored internally in the integrated circuit.
      <br/>
      This selection can be stored, for example, in a register, flip-flop, latch, or other storage or logic circuits.
      <br/>
      The user's selection can also be stored into memory cells such as Flash, EEPROM, EPROM, SRAM, DRAM, laser programmable fuse, fuse, antifuse, and other technologies on the integrated circuit.
      <br/>
      For example, there may be trim bits on the integrated circuits that specifically control and determine the internal sampling frequency.
      <br/>
      Trim bits are bits within the integrated circuit that are used to configure characteristics and operating parameters of the integrated circuit.
      <br/>
      The trim bits may be implemented using any memory technology including Flash, EEPROM, analog Flash or EEPROM, or multilevel Flash or EEPROM.
      <br/>
      When the user's selection for the sampling frequency is stored internally using Flash technology, since this is a nonvolatile storage technology, the user's selection for the sampling frequency will be retained even after power is removed from the integrated circuit.
      <br/>
      In this case, the user does not need to configure the integrated circuit with the selected sampling frequency again upon power up.
      <br/>
      When not using a nonvolatile technology, the user needs to input the desired sampling frequency before reading or writing to the memory.
    </p>
    <p num="57">
      Since the user's sampling frequency selection is stored internally on the integrated circuit, this selection may also be changed or adjusted during the operation of the integrated circuit.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the sampling frequency can be dynamically changed.
      <br/>
      No components external to the integrated circuit such as an external register need to be changed or adjusted.
      <br/>
      For example, the user may change (e.g., via the SPI interface) the value stored in a register or latch, one or more memory cells, or other storage circuit to dynamically change the sampling frequency.
      <br/>
      In a specific embodiment, the user value to select the sampling frequency is a digital value (e.g., a binary number).
      <br/>
      However, in other implementations, this value may be an analog value.
    </p>
    <p num="58">
      In one implementation, clock output 625 of the circuitry in FIG. 6 provides a clock that will be 128 times the user-desired sampling frequency (i.e., 128*fsamp).
      <br/>
      This specific multiple of the sampling frequency was selected to permit greater ease in logical manipulation of the signal by on-chip circuitry to generate derivative clock signals.
      <br/>
      In particular, 128*fsamp is the highest common frequency of the clock signals needed for a particular embodiment of the present invention.

      <br/>
      Clock signals 673 can include one or more higher frequency clocks (i.e., higher than fsamp) used, for example, by charge pump circuitry.
      <br/>
      Clock signals 673 can include one or more lower frequency clocks (i.e., equal to or lower than fsamp) used by the write and read circuits.
      <br/>
      For example, a clock at the sampling frequency is used by the write circuit.
      <br/>
      Clock signals 673 can also include one or more clocks that are at a lower or high frequency that may have a desired duty cycle for operating the on-chip circuitry.

      The external clock frequency is divided by a value represented by the 8-bit binary number to obtain 128*fsamp at an FOUT output 682.

      This circuitry has an enable input EN 684 to enable or disable FOUT 682.

      There is typically only one master bias generator.
      <br/>
      The master bias generator has a master enable input 1230 to control whether the master bias generator is enabled.
      <br/>
      When enabled or on, the master bias generator generates the bias voltage or bias voltages.
      <br/>
      When on, the master bias generator consumes power.
      <br/>
      When disabled or off, the master bias generator does not generate the bias voltage or bias voltages and does not consume power.
      <br/>
      It is desirable to have only one or very few master bias generators on the chip in order to provide uniform bias voltages and reduce power consumption.
    </p>
    <p num="79">
      The master bias generator is connected to a number of slave bias circuits, each of which outputs a bias voltage derived or based on the master bias generator.
      <br/>
      Each slave bias circuit 1225 also has a local enable (EN) input 1235.
      <br/>
      The local enable input is used in the same way as the master enable input.
      <br/>
      When the local enable is off, the slave bias circuit will not output a bias voltage and does not consume power.
      <br/>
      When the local enable is on, the slave bias circuit output the bias voltage and consumes power.
    </p>
    <p num="80">
      By using the master-slave bias arrangement of the present invention, local circuits receiving the bias voltage through one slave bias circuit are isolated from other local circuits receiving the bias voltage through a different slave bias circuit.
      <br/>
      Thus, noise and other artifacts generated at a particular location are less likely to be coupled back to the master bias generator, and through other slave bias circuits, to circuits in another location.
      <br/>
      This is especially important in facilitating a stable bias reference voltage.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, individual slave bias circuits 1225 have individual local enable pins 1235.
      <br/>
      This allows power to be saved since the slave circuit can be turned off when particular circuits do not require the bias voltage.
      <br/>
      For example, a particular portion of the circuitry may be used only during the testing of the device.
      <br/>
      To conserve power, the slave bias circuit for that portion of the circuitry will be turned off for operations other than testing.
    </p>
    <p num="81">
      FIG. 26 also shows circuit or functional blocks of the integrated circuit that are connected to individual slave bias circuits.
      <br/>
      The preamplifier, switch capacitor filter or low pass filter, output buffer, VPP and VVFY level shifter, squelch circuit, internal ring oscillator (to run the charge pumps), internal relaxation oscillator (to generate the sampling frequency), and end-of-battery detector are connected to individual slave circuits.
      <br/>
      The functionality of these blocks is described in more detail elsewhere in this specification.
    </p>
    <p num="82">
      While operating the integrated circuit, certain functional blocks are not used when other functional blocks are being used.
      <br/>
      For example, the VPP and VVFY level shifters are not typically used at the same time as the playback level shifter.
      <br/>
      This is because the memory cells are generally not written to and read from at the same time.
      <br/>
      In cases such as this, the slave bias circuit for the unused or nonoperated circuitry can be turned off.
      <br/>
      This will save power and also further enhance the isolation between the bias voltage output lines of the slave bias circuits.
    </p>
    <p num="83">
      Further, it is desirable to have separate slave bias circuits for the circuit blocks where isolation of the bias output lines is important.
      <br/>
      For example, the slave bias circuit for the internal ring oscillator is separate from that for the internal relaxation oscillator.
      <br/>
      This will help prevent noise or other effects of one oscillator from affecting the other oscillator.
      <br/>
      Another example of where separate slave bias circuits are desirable is for the digital and analog circuitry.
      <br/>
      The analog circuit will be connected to different slave bias circuits from the digital circuits.

      FIG. 27 shows a diagram of circuitry that may be used to implement the master bias voltage or other bias voltages.
      <br/>
      The particular circuitry shown in FIG. 27 is for a bandgap reference voltage generator.
      <br/>
      The bandgap reference voltage provides a stable, constant voltage reference relative to changes in power supply voltages, temperature, and pressure, among other factors.
      <br/>
      Other circuitry, other than a bandgap reference, may be used to generate a reference voltage.
      <br/>
      These may also be used to implement the master bias voltage.

      <br/>
      This specific configuration has an enable input EN to control whether bias voltages are generated at outputs VSP, VSPC, VSNC, and VSN.
      <br/>
      When EN is a logic high, bias voltages are generated.
      <br/>
      When EN is a logic low, the slave circuit will not generate bias voltages, and the circuitry will consume essentially zero power.
      <br/>
      A VM input is a bias voltage input used to generate the bias voltages.
      <br/>
      VM is connected to the master bias generator.

      The slave bias circuit used VM to generate multiple bias voltages.

      VSP will be about a VT below VDD.

      VSPC will be about 2*VT below VDD.

      VSNC will be about 2*VT above ground.

      FIG. 29 shows a diagram of a portion of a memory array of the present invention.

      Individual memory cells are arranged in rows and columns.
      <br/>
      FIG. 15 shows eight memory cells M1, M2, M3, M4, M5, M6, M7, and M8.
      <br/>
      The memory-transistors are floating gate memory cells such as EEPROM or Flash.

      Bit lines BL1, BL2, BL3, and BL4 coupled to four different columns of memory cells.
      <br/>
      These memory cells share a common source line SL1.
      <br/>
      Moreover, for example, an array may have 1K, 10K, 100K, 500K, 1M, 2M, 4M, 6M, 8M, 10M, 12M, 16M, 20M, 32M, 64M cells or more.
      <br/>
      As discussed previously, a practical implementation of the present invention using present technology has about 1.92 million or less memory cells.
      <br/>
      As technology advances, it will undoubtedly be possible to have more memory cells on the integrated circuit.
      <br/>
      For example, a chip twice the size will have 3.84 million memory cells.
      <br/>
      This "double sized" memory will store approximately sixteen minutes of voice data when using a 4 kilohertz sampling frequency.
      <br/>
      The cells are organized by rows and columns.

    <p num="87">
      FIG. 29 shows a sector or page of memory cells.

      Since the memory cells have a common source line, all the memory cells in the sector are erased at the same time.
      <br/>
      Memory cells in one sector will have a different source line from memory cells in other sectors.
      <br/>
      The memory is organized in sectors to allow a group of memory cells to be more easily erased.
      <br/>
      It is undesirable to use too large a sector size or else too much data is erased at one time.
      <br/>
      Then, it is likely much of the data will need to be rewritten into the memory.

      In a specific embodiment, the nonvolatile analog memory cells are fabricated using Flash technology.
      <br/>
      Flash technology provides reprogrammable, nonvolatile memory cells.
      <br/>
      Flash transistor may be written, erased, and rewritten an indefinite number of times.
      <br/>
      In this written description, writing the Flash memory cells may also be referred to as "programming" the cells.
      <br/>
      And, programming the cells means a stored threshold voltage (VT) of the memory cells will be increased.
      <br/>
      For example, Flash transistor may be operated for about 300,000 or more erase and write cycles.
      <br/>
      Also, Flash transistors retain their stored value even when power is removed from the integrated circuit.
      <br/>
      It is expected the data retention time is better than 100 years.
    </p>
    <p num="89">
      A memory cell may be a single Flash transistor having a floating gate.
      <br/>
      Electrons are transferred to and from the floating gate.
      <br/>
      The quantity of electrons stored on the floating gate will be representative of the memory cell's stored value.
      <br/>
      The quantity of electronics stored on the floating gate, and hence the cell's stored value is determined by finding a threshold voltage (VT) of the transistor.
      <br/>
      For example, the threshold voltages for a Flash transistor typically range from about 3 volts to about 5.5 volts.
      <br/>
      The voltages or stored VTs in this range are used to represent the different stored values.
      <br/>
      The range for VT is technology dependent and will vary.
      <br/>
      The threshold voltage for the Flash transistor may also be negative in some applications of the present invention.
      <br/>
      For EEPROM cells, the VT range will be from about -2 volts to about 3 volts.
    </p>
    <p num="90">
      A Flash transistor is programmed or written by placing electrons on the floating gate.
      <br/>
      Programming can be accomplished by generating a programming current through the transistor sufficient to generate hot electrons.
      <br/>
      The programming current through a Flash transistor may range from about 200 microamps to about 3 milliamps, or more.
      <br/>
      A typical programming current would be about 0.5 milliamps to about 2 milliamps.
      <br/>
      For some Flash transistors, programming currents of less than 200 microamps are used.
      <br/>
      For example, some Flash transistor are programmed with about 10 microamps.
      <br/>
      Some hot electrons will jump the potential barrier and become embedded in the floating gate of the Flash transistor.
      <br/>
      Flash transistors are erased by removing electrons from the floating gate using such mechanisms as Fowler-Nordheim tunneling.
      <br/>
      Essentially, electrons are attracted out of the floating gate by placing a relatively large positive voltage on the source line.
    </p>
    <p num="91">
      Many other technologies may also be used to implement the memory cells of the present invention.
      <br/>
      For example, EEPROM or EPROM technology may also be used instead of, or in combination with, Flash technology.
      <br/>
      For EEPROM technology, the EEPROM transistors having a floating gate can be programmed using Fowler-Nordheim tunneling.
      <br/>
      Analog memory cells may be implemented using other technologies including dynamic RAM (DRAM) cells by controlling the amount of charge stored on the capacitor; ferroelectric RAM (FRAM) cells by controlling the electric polarization of the ferroelectric material; and antifuses by controlling the resistance or other electrical property of the antifuse link.
      <br/>
      Other technologies may include charge-coupled devices (CCDs) and fuses, among others.
    </p>
    <p num="92">
      Flash transistor technology provides certain advantages compared to EEPROM technology.
      <br/>
      The time for hot electron programming of Flash cells is much shorter than the programming time of EEPROM cells.
      <br/>
      Typically, Flash cells may be programmed about 100 times faster than EEPROM cells.
      <br/>
      The programming time for Flash cells is typically about 125 microseconds, although less time (e.g., 63 microseconds) is often sufficient.
      <br/>
      Since the programming time is shorter with Flash cells, an integrated circuit with Flash technology can be operated with a higher sampling frequency because less time is needed before taking the next sample.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, the samples are "fresher" since less time has elapsed between the time the sample was taken and the sampled data is stored. "Fresher samples" refers to samples that are free of sample and hold "droop" errors, which can be caused by charge loss or leakage during the hold mode.
      <br/>
      By using fresher samples, this results in less distortion.
      <br/>
      Flash cells are also smaller than EEPROM cells, so larger numbers of Flash cells may be fabricated on the same integrated circuit area.
      <br/>
      The circuitry overhead for interfacing with and configuring Flash transistors is also comparatively less than for EEPROM transistors.
      <br/>
      Generally, there are many benefits to using Flash technology as compared to other floating gate technologies including EEPROM technology.
    </p>
    <p num="93">
      In other embodiments of the present invention, the memory cells or a portion of the memory cells may be one-time programmable (OTP) instead of reprogrammable.
      <br/>
      The OTP cells can be used for setting options on the integrated circuit.
      <br/>
      An example of another use of OTP memory is to store prerecorded sound, music, video, or pictures.
      <br/>
      OTP integrated circuits of the present invention may be sold much like prerecorded cassettes, CDs, minidiscs, videotapes, videodiscs, and DVDs.
      <br/>
      OTP cells can be implemented using the same technology used to implement the reprogrammable cells.
      <br/>
      However, OTP cells cannot be erased because the circuitry is designed not to allow erasure.

      A sector of memory cells can have different bit lines, but these memory cells share the same source line (SL).

      There are many different techniques of implementing circuitry for writing or programming information into the memory array.
      <br/>
      Some techniques are discussed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,694,356, which is incorporated by reference.
      <br/>
      FIG. 32 shows an example of a specific implementation of the write circuit 414 of FIG. 4.
      <br/>
      Circuit blocks 1810 and 1815 each contain a combination of voltage level shifter and sample and hold (S/H) amplifier circuit.
      <br/>
      The level shifter and S/H circuit may also be implemented in separate or different circuit blocks.
      <br/>
      For example, the S/H circuit can be part of the low pass filter circuitry 411 of FIG. 4.
      <br/>
      This circuitry holds the data and generates voltage levels for storing the sampled data into a memory cell.
      <br/>
      The S/H circuit samples when the clock runs and holds when the clock is stopped on a low phase.
    </p>
    <p num="102">
      Inputs to the circuit blocks are a signal 1817 (which is typically analog) to be stored or recorded and clock inputs 1819.
      <br/>
      The analog signal comes from an antialiasing filter, such as low pass filter 411 or the Butterworth filter of FIG. 23. The clock inputs are from a nonoverlapping clock buffer such as shown in FIG. 24. Level shifter circuit block 1810 provides an output 1820.
      <br/>
      This level shifter can be referred to as a programming voltage or VPP level shifter circuit.
      <br/>
      Level shifter circuit 1815 provides an output 1825.
      <br/>
      This level shifter can be referred to as a target or verify (VVFY) voltage level shifter circuit.
      <br/>
      Output 1825 provides a level shifted voltage VS1 (or VVFY) corresponding to the target threshold voltage (VT) to be programmed into the memory cell.
      <br/>
      For typical Flash memory cells, the range of target VTs will be from about 2.5 volts to about 6 volts.
      <br/>
      Output 1820 provides a level shifted voltage VS2, which is the target VT plus an offset.
      <br/>
      During programming, VS2 is coupled to the control electrode or control gate of the memory cell so the memory will be programmed to the desired or target VT.
      <br/>
      In a specific embodiment, the offset voltage is about 5 volts.
      <br/>
      In this case, if the desired VT is 3.5 volts and the offset is 5 volts, the VS2 voltage will be 8.5 volts.
      <br/>
      Using two level shifters provides the advantage that the two level shifters may be independently adjusted in order to program memory cells more precisely.
    </p>
    <p num="103">
      The voltages generated and provided by the level shifters may be above the supply voltages for the integrated circuit.
      <br/>
      These high voltages are used to program and verify the memory cells.
      <br/>
      In order for the level shifters to provide these high voltages, high voltages can be generated on-chip using charge pump circuitry (discussed below).
      <br/>
      These high voltages are connected to the amplifiers of level shifters.
      <br/>
      Specifically, the generated high voltages are connected to the supply rails of level shifter circuitry.
      <br/>
      The level shifter will be able to generate a range of output voltages up to its supply voltage.

      The writing techniques of the present invention use two level shifter circuits 1810 and 1815.

      By having the two level shifters, each may be adjusted independently from another to allow for proper and more precise programming of memory cells.
      <br/>
      Other programming methodologies may use a single level shifter or more than two level shifters.
      <br/>
      In a particular embodiment, in order to program multiple memory cells at one time, a number of level shifters are used in conjunction with another at the same time.

      In a technique of programming the analog memory cell according to the present invention, VS1 and VS2 are coupled alternatively to the control electrode or word line of the Flash cell.
      <br/>
      Typically, VS1 will be in a range from about 2 volts to about 7 volts.
      <br/>
      VS2 will be in a range from about 5 volts to about 13 volts.
      <br/>
      As shown in FIG. 33, at the control gate, there will be pulses between a target or desired VT level (VS1 level) and a desired VT level plus an offset voltage level (VS2 level).
      <br/>
      When VS1 is coupled to the control gate of the memory cell, the memory cell is evaluated whether or not it conducts current.

      Programming is completed when the memory cell no longer conducts.
      <br/>
      When VS2 is coupled to the control gate of the memory cell, the memory cell is being programmed.
      <br/>
      And, after repeated pulses of this VS2 voltage, the VT of the memory will eventually reach the desired VT level.
      <br/>
      The larger the offset voltage, the faster the memory cell will program.
    </p>
    <p num="106">
      The VS2 voltage is pulsed at the control electrode until the VT of the memory cell reaches the desired or target VT value.
      <br/>
      FIG. 33 shows a diagram of a waveform at the control gate of the Flash cell.
      <br/>
      A memory cell will be programmed using anywhere from a single pulse to about forty pulses, or more.
      <br/>
      Pulsing of VS2 continues until current stops flowing through the memory cell when VS1 is applied to its control electrode.
      <br/>
      At the point the memory cell no longer conducts current with VS1 at its gate, the memory cell's VT will be at the target VT level.
      <br/>
      As the analog signal varies, the VS1 and VS2 levels will also track the variation.
      <br/>
      A higher voltage analog sample will result in higher VS1 and VS2 voltages.
    </p>
    <p num="107">
      By selecting the appropriate values for the VS1 and VS2 voltages, the resolution and programming time for the memory cells are also adjusted.
      <br/>
      In an embodiment of the present invention, level shifters 1810 and 1815 are trimmable to allow adjustment of the VS1 and VS2 voltages without mask changes.
      <br/>
      The VS1 and VS2 voltages can be adjusted during testing (before or after packaging, or both) of the integrated circuits to account for manufacturing and other variations.
      <br/>
      To provide better resolution, a technique of the present invention is to select the VS1 and VS2 voltages so that about fifty percent or more of the allowed time for programming is used.
      <br/>
      Better resolution is desirable because this results in the most precise storage representation of the original signal.

      Generally, if fewer pulses are required to program a memory cell, this means the cell is programmed using coarser steps.

      A memory cell should be programmed before the next sample.

      Shorter programming times are desirable to facilitate higher sampling frequencies.

      A level shift output 1930 is representative of an output of the level shifter circuit (e.g., either VS1 or VS2 outputs).
      <br/>
      In operation, the level shifter provides a level shifted output 1930 representative of input 1910.
      <br/>
      The sample and hold circuit, samples when the clock runs, and holds when the clock is stopped on a low phase.
      <br/>
      In particular, during a period T1, the input signal 1910 is sampled using the clock signal as a sampling clock.
      <br/>
      Note that during period T1, the output of the level shifter changes to become the level of the input signal v(t) plus a constant, which is the level-shifted value.
      <br/>
      By the beginning of a period T2, the level shifter output has become its target or final value (i.e., v(t) plus a constant).
      <br/>
      During period T2 when the clock is low, the value of the input 1910 which has been sampled is held.
      <br/>
      The output of the level shifter does not change.
      <br/>
      The level shifter output 1930 is used for programming the memory cell or other purposes.
      <br/>
      During period T2, the sampled value is stored into a single memory cell by pulsing the level shifter output 1930 at the control gate of the memory cell.
      <br/>
      After period T2, during a period T3, the analog value is again sampled, similarly as described for period T1.
      <br/>
      This technique of sampling and holding is repeated as many times and for the duration desired to store the input signal into the memory cells.

      For example, to store one minute of an analog signal such as a voice, the process is repeated for the duration of one minute.

      For example, the switching of a switch 2003 is controlled by CLK1, and the switching of a switch 2005 is controlled by a CLK2.

      CLK1 and CLK2 are nonoverlapping because only CLK1 or CLK2 is high at the same time.
      <br/>
      A switch will be "closed" when the controlling clock signal is a high.
      <br/>
      Otherwise, the switch will be "open." For example, when CLK2 is high, and CLK1 is low, the circuitry in FIG. 35 will be in a HOLD mode.

      The circuitry takes as input a fully differential input signal (e.g., input 1817 of FIG. 32) at Vi+ and Vi-. An offset voltage is input at Vos.

      The circuitry provides a level-shifted output depending on the sizes of the capacitances C1, C2, and C3 according to the following equation: (Vout-Vsg)=(C2/C3*(Vi+-Vi-))-(2*C1/C3 (Vos-Vsg)).

      The level shifter can be designed to have a fully differential output if a fully differential memory is used, but a fully differential memory would use about twice the integrated circuit area as a single-ended memory.

      Adjusting C1 adjusts the offset component of the equation.

      FIG. 37 shows offset component 2150.

      The range of voltages for VS2 is technology dependent, varying depending on parameters such as oxide thickness and channel length.

      By adjusting C1, the yield of good die may be improved.

      In a specific embodiment, VS2 ranges from about 5 volts to about 13 volts.

      The offset voltage between VS1 and VS2 is programmably selectable by adjusting C1.

      It is generally desirable for the VS1 and VS2 curves to be parallel because the offset voltage will be constant.
      <br/>
      In some cases, however, it may be desirable to have a relationship between VS1 and VS2 not having a constant offset voltage.

      A number of capacitors C1A, C1B, C1C, C1D, and C1E are programmably connected in parallel.

      For example, the capacitor sizes may be binary weighted.

      The first input is connected through a switch 2420, which is controlled by a signal RAMP, to a current source 2425.
      <br/>
      When RAMP is high, switch 2420 will be closed, coupling the current source to the first input of operational amplifier 2407.

      The circuitry in FIG. 40 is run at the sampling frequency used to store the data.

      A DUMP signal closes the HDUMP switch to reset the circuit to the 1.2-volt level at RAMP OUTPUT.

      The initial starting voltage can be any voltage other than 1.2 volts, as long as it is below the minimum VT range of the memory cells.

      To determine the stored VT of a memory cell, the RAMP OUTPUT is connected to the gate of the memory cell.

      The ramp circuitry continues to ramp the voltage at the gate of the memory cell.

      The memory cell will not conduct when the control electrode voltage is below its stored VT.

      The memory cell will conduct when it is above its VT.

      And, the sense amplifier is low when the memory cell does not conduct, and high when the memory cell conducts, or vice versa.

      Therefore, the ramp circuitry ramps the control electrode until the output of the sense amplifier changes from low to high, or vice versa.

      <br/>
      If the signal level is low for a certain time, the background noise is attenuated by this feature.
      <br/>
      The user can select the defined threshold and defined time, or these parameters may be set by the design.
      <br/>
      This circuitry is active when used during playback and inactive at other times in order to reduce power consumption.

      An output 3010 from the low pass or smoothing filter is input to an output amplifier 3015 and squelch circuit 3005.
      <br/>
      Output amplifier 3015 has an ANOUT signal output that is representative of the information stored in the memory cells.
      <br/>
      For example, if voice or other sounds were stored in the memory cells, ANOUT can be used to drive an external speaker driver 3025 and speaker 3030.

      The voice or other sounds are then played out of the speaker.

      When the SQ input is low, ANOUT will not be attenuated.

      Output amplifier 3015 provides a gain A0.

      The SQ signal can also be provided as an external signal SQUELCH OUT.

      It is contemplated the integrated circuit of the present invention will operate in a relatively wide range of supply voltage conditions.
      <br/>
      For example, the integrated circuit may be battery powered.
      <br/>
      Different types of battery packs (e.g., air, lithium, nickel metal hydride, nickel cadmium, lead acid, gel cell, alkaline, zinc manganese) will provide different voltage levels.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, the voltage levels may also change depending on how much charge remains in the battery.
    </p>
    <p num="141">
      Depending on the voltage level of the power supply, certain on-chip circuitry may need to be adjusted to reflect this change in operating conditions.
      <br/>
      An example of such circuitry is the charge pump circuitry used to provide the voltages to program a memory cell.
      <br/>
      The charge pump voltages are used by the level shifter circuits.
      <br/>
      Since it is desirable to program multiple data levels in a single memory cell, it is important to maintain precise programming voltages in order to ensure information is properly stored.
      <br/>
      For example, when the power supply voltage level is relatively high, fewer charge pump stages may be needed compared to the case when the power voltage level is relatively low.
      <br/>
      By adjusting the charge pump output voltage levels to compensate for supply voltage variation, this allows the integrated circuit to store analog and digital data more precisely--effectively more bits of storage per memory cell.
    </p>
    <p num="142">
      FIG. 47 shows an embodiment of circuitry for power supply level detection and adjustment circuitry of the present invention.
      <br/>
      The circuitry includes three voltage detect circuits 3410, 3415, and 3420 to detect the voltage level of the supply voltage.
      <br/>
      A number of charge pumps 3610, 3615, and 3620 are adjusted based on the voltage level.
      <br/>
      If the voltage level is now too low, an EOB signal will indicate this situation.
      <br/>
      A low supply voltage may mean the battery is low.
      <br/>
      EOB stands for end of battery life.
      <br/>
      Each voltage detect circuit has an input for external voltage (Vext), logic signal to update voltage detection (PH1), /power-on reset (PORN), and internal reference voltage (VREF).
      <br/>
      When PH1 or PORN is asserted, the voltage level detect circuit makes a detection of the supply voltage level at Vext.
    </p>
    <p num="143">
      Vext is an external voltage.
      <br/>
      PH1 is a logic signal used to indicate that the voltage detect circuit will perform an updated check of the external voltage.

      PORN is a power-on reset signal.

      Vref is an internal reference voltage.

      EN�2:0� are three enable signals used to enable respective ones of the charge pumps I, II, and III.

      This voltage may be about 6 volts.

      VSH is an output of charge pump III.
      <br/>
      This voltage may be about 8 volts.

      EOB is a logic signal used to indicate a low battery voltage or end-of-battery life.

      FIG. 49 shows a more detailed schematic of a voltage detect circuit.
      <br/>
      This circuitry can be used to implement the voltage detect circuits 3410, 3415, and 3420 of FIG. 47. The voltage detect circuit performs a comparison of a VIN voltage, connected to Vext, to a VREF voltage.
      <br/>
      The voltage detect circuit provides a high output at node Q when VIN/VREF is greater than C2/C1.
    </p>
    <p num="145">
      In FIG. 47, three voltage detect circuits are coupled together to permit the detection of a number of power supply threshold levels.
      <br/>
      For example, in a specific embodiment of the present invention, a first level for the power supply may be set at 2.4 volts, a second threshold set at 2.7 volts, and a third threshold set at 3.1 volts.
      <br/>
      These threshold levels may be set, for example, by inputting the appropriate bias voltage to the VREF of voltage detect circuits 3420, 3410, and 3415, respectively.
      <br/>
      Another technique of setting the threshold levels is to appropriately select the sizes of capacitors C1 and C2 within the voltage detect circuit.
      <br/>
      Typical values are a C1 of about 1 picofarad and a C2 of about 2.2 picofarads, depending on the threshold level to be set.
    </p>
    <p num="146">
      In operation, the circuitry in FIG. 47 evaluates the power supply level once upon power-up of the integrated circuit.
      <br/>
      For example, after supplying power to the integrated circuit, the integrated circuit will be in a "power down" mode.
      <br/>
      A PWRUP command is input through the SPI interface to initialize the circuitry.
      <br/>
      Within about 100 microseconds of the PWRUP command, the VDD supply level is detected and any adjustments to the charge pump circuitry is made.
      <br/>
      The integrated circuit is ready for functional use.
      <br/>
      In other embodiments of the present invention, the circuitry periodically or continuously evaluates the power supply level.
      <br/>
      For example, in a specific implementation, the VDD supply voltage level is detected upon the entering of a different mode of operation.
      <br/>
      As shown in FIG. 48, the analog memory integrated circuit has operation modes including playback 3430, record 3433, power down 3435, stop or idle 3437, digital read 3439, digital write 3441, and cue or fast forward 3443.
      <br/>
      Therefore, when switching from the idle node to playback, the supply voltage level is detected.
      <br/>
      The supply voltage is detected upon entering any of the modes shown in FIG. 48.
    </p>
    <p num="147">
      Note that in the operational scheme shown in FIG. 48, idle mode 3437 is an intermediate mode when switching from any of the other modes in the figure.
      <br/>
      In other words, there is, for example, no direct path between record and digital read; the idle mode must be entered before switching from record to digital read.
      <br/>
      This ensures the integrated circuit is operated properly.
    </p>
    <p num="148">
      Once the power supply level has been determined, this information may be passed to other circuitry on the integrated circuit.
      <br/>
      The operation of the other circuit can be altered to compensate or account for the power supply level.
      <br/>
      There may also be an external signal indicative of the power supply level.
      <br/>
      For example, if the power voltage level is below 2.4 volts, other circuitry on the integrated circuit will receive the EOB signal indicating a low battery condition.
      <br/>
      Such an EOB signal may also be used to warn the user of the low battery condition.
      <br/>
      The user can then replace or recharge the battery.

    <p num="149">
      Although FIG. 47 shows three voltage detect circuits, other embodiments of a power supply level detection circuit may have any number of voltage detect circuits depending on the number of desired threshold levels.
      <br/>
      For example, the circuitry will have a single voltage detect circuit if there will only be one voltage threshold level.
      <br/>
      The circuitry will have two voltage detect circuits if there will be two voltage threshold levels.
      <br/>
      And, the circuitry may have greater than three voltage detect circuits if it is desirable to have more then three voltage threshold levels.

      The circuitry in FIG. 47 includes three charge pump circuits: a VCP charge pump 3610, a VW charge pump 3615, and a VSH charge pump 3620.

      Other embodiments of the present invention include a single charge pump, two charge pumps, or more than three charge pumps.
      <br/>
      The charge pump circuits 3610, 3615, and 3620 are coupled to different circuitry on the integrated circuit.

      This permits the generation of various voltages for the operation of the circuitry.

      Circuitry for each of the stages is in FIG. 51. The number of stages used in the charge pump depends many factors including the output voltage desired, the process technology used, size of the capacitors, and other considerations.
      <br/>
      A charge pump circuit of the present invention may have fewer than eleven stages, or more than eleven stages.

      The number of stages used during the operation of the charge pump will vary depending on the operating conditions of the integrated circuit.

      The number of stages used will ensure generation of a proper voltage output despite variations in operating conditions such as changes in the voltage supply level.
      <br/>
      The voltage level of the power supply is possibly detected using the power supply level detection circuitry of FIG. 47. Logic circuitry 3423 takes the information from the voltage level detect circuitry and adjusts the charge pump to use only a particular number of stages.
    </p>
    <p num="153">
      A general relationship is that the number of stages to be used will increase as the power supply voltage level decreases.
      <br/>
      Additional stages in the charge pump circuit provide an additional boost in the voltage level and current level at the output of the pump.
      <br/>
      For example, if the power supply voltage level is below about 2.7 volts, all eleven stages of the VCP charge pump are used.
      <br/>
      If the power supply voltage is between about 2.7 volts and about 3.3 volts, nine stages are used.

      The voltage range output of the charge pump circuit may be in any desired range.

      For example, the VCP charge pump circuitry generates a VCP voltage of about 12.8 volts to facilitate the program and erase of Flash memory cells.
      <br/>
      The VCP voltage will range from about 11.8 volts to about 13.8 volts.
      <br/>
      In other embodiments, voltages for programming the memory cells are in a range from about 5 volts to about 16 volts.
      <br/>
      The VW charge pump generates a VW voltage of about 6.4 volts, which can range from about 5.4 volts to about 7.4 volts.

      There are many different ways to implement trim bits including using one-time programmable cells, digital memory cells, analog memory cells, fuses, antifuse, and many others.

      In a specific embodiment, the trim bits are implemented using one-time programmable cells which are formed within or nearby the analog array area of the integrated circuit.

      <br/>
      A sense amplifier generally consumes power while the sense amplifier is actively sensing.
      <br/>
      Therefore, by turning off the sense amplifier after the state of the trim bit has been determined, this conserves power.
      <br/>
      The state of the trim bit is not expected to change during the normal operation of the device.

      <br/>
      This is one particular implementation, among others, of a latch circuit.

      The multiplexer circuit allows the circuitry to be adjusted using user-selected data instead of what is stored in the trim bit.
      <br/>
      Under some cases such as testing, it is desirable to "override" the trim bit with user data.

      In particular, a user may input user-selected data into a register, shift register, or other storage block.
