      Chitin, the chemical structure of which is shown in FIG. 1, is the main constituent in the shells of crustaceans and is the most abundant naturally occurring biopolymer other than cellulose.
      <br/>
      Chitosan, the chemical structure of which is also shown in FIG. 1, is derived from chitin and can be formed by deacetylation of chitin.
      <br/>
      Chitosan is commercially available in a wide variety of molecular weights (i.e., 10-1,000 kDa) and usually has a degree of deacetylation ranging between 70% and 90%.

      These polyelectrolyte compositions with chitosan have been well characterized in terms of optimal complexation conditions (i.e., ionic strength, pH, temperature, and ratios of components), composition morphology, and composition stability.

      Chitosan has also been proposed for use as a biomedical membrane, artificial skin, for delivery of anti-cancer drugs to tumor cells, and as a pharmaceutical delivery system for prescription drugs.
      <br/>
      In addition, chitosan has been shown to be biodegradable, biocompatible, to have very low toxicity, and no thrombogenic activity.

      <br/>
      Chitosan is described as effective in condensing negatively charged plasmid DNA due to charge interactions with the positively charged chitosan.
      <br/>
      Mumper et al., report on the correlation between physicochemical properties of the gene transfer complexes and their in-vitro transfection efficiency.
      <br/>
      Specifically, they report that the use of smaller molecular weight chitosan as a component of the delivery system (i.e., chitosan in the range of 2-4 kDa M.W.) results in the smallest particle of the gene delivery system and also in an increased transfection of cells with the condensed delivery system.

      Chitosan has also been used with a pharmacologically active compound such as insulin in the form of a solution or as a coating on polystyrene microspheres.
      <br/>
      These formulations involved the use of chitosan of molecular weights of 10,000 or greater, preferably at least 100,000 or 200,000 and most preferably about 500,000.
      <br/>
      The chitosan/insulin formulations were prepared by mixing equal volumes of insulin and chitosan in solution.
      <br/>
      The formulation was administered nasally to rats via microsyringe.

      The use of chitosan in microspheres containing naked DNA has been reported by Alexakis et al., Applied Biochemistry and Biotechnology, 50:93-106, 1995, incorporated herein by reference in its entirety, including any drawings and figures.
      <br/>
      The immobilized DNA within chitosan-coated alginate microspheres was designed to test the role of metabolic byproducts of digestion in promoting damage to DNA.
      <br/>
      The microspheres were designed to pass through the digestive system without being taken up by cells in the animal.
      <br/>
      Upon excretion, the intact microsphere can be recovered and the DNA examined to asses the role of metabolic byproducts of digestion in promoting cancer through damage to nucleic acid.
      <br/>
      The microspheres were designed to retain the DNA within their core during transit through the animal.
      <br/>
      The microsphere prevented access to DNA from hydrolytic enzymes but allowed metabolic byproducts of digestion to cross or exit the microsphere shell.
      <br/>
      The reported recovery rate of the microspheres after administration was 97%.
      <br/>
      According to the abstract, leakage of DNA from intact microspheres was not observed.

    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="10">
      The invention features compositions of chitosan-based compounds and nucleic acids or oligonucleotides.
      <br/>
      The compositions are capable of non-viral gene delivery (i.e., delivery of nucleic acid without the use of any genomic viral components) via various routes of administration.
      <br/>
      The invention also features methods for the preparation of chitosan-based compositions and methods for the introduction of the compositions into a cell for expression of nucleic acids, oligonucleotides or gene products transported by the composition.
      <br/>
      The compositions are useful for enhancing the administration to, and uptake of, nucleic acids or oligonucleotides by an organism.
      <br/>
      The compositions are also useful for in vitro transfections and in vivo gene delivery, and among other things for the administration of proteins, polypeptides, or peptides encoded by the nucleic acid or oligonucleotide.
    </p>
    <p num="11">
      An efficient strategy for enhancing nucleic acid delivery in vivo is to present, at the target site, nucleic acid in composition of sufficient size to promote its cellular uptake.
      <br/>
      The compositions of the present invention, which are designed to administer nucleic acid into a cell, comprise a substance which promotes condensation of nucleic acid when the substance is complexed with the nucleic acid.
      <br/>
      The resulting composition is capable of increasing the efficacy of transfecting cells in an organism or cells in vitro cell culture.
    </p>
    <p num="12">
      Chitosan's properties are useful in complexing and condensing nucleic acids or complexing oligonucletides.
      <br/>
      DNA, which is a polyanionic nucleic acid has a high net negative charge due to the presence of two phosphate moieties on each base pair.
      <br/>
      Therefore, DNA is an excellent candidate for complexation with chitosan and chitosan oligomers for non-viral gene delivery.
      <br/>
      Neutralization of the negative charge of DNA by the amine groups of chitosan and chitosan oligomers results in condensation of DNA into a compact particle which protects the DNA from nuclease degradation and delivers the DNA, either specifically or non-specifically, to target cells.
    </p>
    <p num="13">
      Chitosan has structural characteristics similar to glycosamino-glycans (GAGs) and appears to mimic their function (T.

      <br/>
      GAGs are widely distributed among various tissues and, like heparin sulphate proteoglycans (GAGS), may be a component of cell membranes.
      <br/>
      Thus, chitosan may provide natural targeting to cell surfaces (e.g., endothelial cells).
      <br/>
      For example, chitin and chitosan have been reported to selectively distribute to the surface of tumor cells (T.

      By "nucleic acid" is meant both RNA and DNA including: cDNA, genomic DNA, plasmid DNA, antisense molecule, polynucleotides or olignucleotides, RNA or mRNA.
      <br/>
      In a preferred embodiment, the nucleic acid administered is plasmid DNA which comprises a "vector".
      <br/>
      By "vector" is meant a nucleic acid molecule incorporating sequences encoding polypeptide product(s) as well as, various regulatory elements for transcription, translation, transcript stability, replication, and other functions as are known in the art and as described herein.
      <br/>
      Vector can include expression vector.
      <br/>
      An "expression vector" is a vector which allows for production or expressing a product encoded for by a nucleic acid sequence contained in the vector.
      <br/>
      The product may be a protein or a nucleic acid such as an mRNA which can function as an antisense molecule.
      <br/>
      A "transcript stabilizer" is a sequence within the vector which contributes to prolonging the half life (slowing the elimination) of a transcript.

      An "antisense molecule" can be a mRNA or an oligonucleotide which forms a duplex with a complementary nucleic acid strand and can prevent the complementary strand from participating in its normal function within a cell.
      <br/>
      For example, expression of a particular growth factor protein encoded by a particular gene.
      <br/>
      A "gene product" means products encoded by the vector.
      <br/>
      Examples of gene products include mRNA templates for translation, ribozymes, antisense RNA, proteins, glycoproteins, lipoproteins and phosphoproteins. "Post-translational processing" means modifications made to the expressed gene product.
      <br/>
      These may include addition of side chains such as carbohydrates, lipids, inorganic or organic compounds, the cleavage of targeting signals or propeptide elements, as well as the positioning of the gene product in a particular compartment of the cell such as the mitochondria, nucleus, or membranes.
      <br/>
      The vector may comprise one or more genes in a linear or circularized configuration.
      <br/>
      The vector may also comprise a plasmid backbone or other elements involved in the production, manufacture, or analysis of a gene product.
      <br/>
      The nucleic acid may be associated with a targeting ligand to effect targeted delivery.
    </p>
    <p num="28">
      A "targeting ligand" is a component of the delivery system or vehicle which binds to receptors, with an affinity for the ligand, on the surface or within compartments of a cell for the purpose of enhancing uptake or intracellular trafficking of the vector.
      <br/>
      Glucans such as Tris-galactosyl residues, carnitine derivatives, mannose-6-phosphate, monoclonal antibodies, peptide ligands, and DNA-binding proteins represent examples of targeting ligands which can be used to enhance uptake. "Intracellular trafficking" is the translocation of the vector within the cell from the point of uptake to the nucleus where expression of a gene product takes place.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, cytoplasmic expression of a nucleic acid construct utilizing, for example, a T7 polymerase system may be accomplished.
      <br/>
      Various steps in intracellular trafficking include endosomal release and compartmentalization of the vector within various extranuclear compartments, and nuclear entry. "Endosomal release" is the egress of the vector from the endosome after endocytosis.
      <br/>
      This is an essential and potentially rate limiting step in the trafficking of vectors to the nucleus.
      <br/>
      A lytic peptide may be used to assist in this process.
      <br/>
      A "lytic peptide" is a peptide which functions alone or in conjunction with another compound to penetrate the membrane of a cellular compartment, particularly a lysosomal or endosomal compartment, to allow the escape of the contents of that compartment to another cellular compartment such as the cytosolic and/or nuclear compartment. "Compartmentalization" is the partitioning of vectors in different compartments within a defined extracellular or intracellular space.
      <br/>
      Significant extracellular compartments may include, for example, the vascular space, hair follicles, interstitial fluid, synovial fluid, cerebral spinal fluid, thyroid follicular fluid.
      <br/>
      Significant intracellular compartments may include endosome, potosome, lysosome, secondary lysosome, cytoplasmic granule, mitochondria, and the nucleus.

    <p num="29">"Nuclear entry" is the translocation of the vector across the nuclear membrane into the nucleus where the gene may be transcribed.</p>
    <p num="30">
      "Elimination" is the removal or clearance of materials (vectors, transcripts, gene products) from a specific compartment over time.
      <br/>
      This term may be used to reflect elimination from the body, the vascular compartment, extracellular compartments, or intracellular compartments.
      <br/>
      Elimination includes translocation (excretion) from a particular compartment or biotransformation (degradation).

      A "target" is a specific organ, tissue, or cell for which uptake of a vector and expression of a gene product is intended. "Uptake" means the translocation of the vector from the extracellular to intracellular compartments.
      <br/>
      This can involve receptor mediated processes, fusion with cell membranes, endocytosis, potocytosis, pinocytosis or other translocation mechanisms.

    <p num="38">
      By "complexing" is meant a high affinity interaction, based upon non-covalent binding, between the chitosan-based substance and the nucleic acid or oligonucleotide.

      This interaction is most preferably an ionic interaction but may be brought about wholly or in part by hydrogen bonding, Van der Walls interactions or other chemical attractions commonly recognized by those in the art.
      <br/>
      The compounds which complex and condense a nucleic acid may also interact or associate with the nucleic acid by intermolecular forces and/or valence bonds such as: Van der Waals forces, ion-dipole interactions, ion-induced dipole interactions, hydrogen bonds, or ionic bonds.
    </p>
    <p num="39">
      These interactions may serve the following functions: (1) Stereo selectively protect nucleic acids from nucleases by shielding; (2) facilitate the cellular uptake of nucleic acid by "piggyback endocytosis".

      To achieve the desired effects set forth, it is desirable, but not necessary, that the substances which condense and complex nucleic acid have amphipathic properties; that is, the substance has both hydrophilic and hydrophobic regions.
      <br/>
      The hydrophilic region of the substance may associate with the largely ionic and hydrophilic regions of the nucleic acid, while the hydrophobic region of the substance may act to retard diffusion of nucleic acid and to protect nucleic acid from nucleases.
      <br/>
      Additionally, the hydrophobic region may specifically interact with cell membranes, possibly facilitating endocytosis of the composition and thereby nucleic acid associated with the compound.
      <br/>
      This chitosan-based composition may increase the pericellular concentration of nucleic acid.
      <br/>
      Agents which may have amphipathic properties and are generally regarded as being pharmaceutically acceptable are chitin, chitosan, and chitosan oligomers.

      By "condensing" is meant charge neutralization, exclusion of water and compacting into colloidal particles.
      <br/>
      Compositions formed as a result of complexing with chitosan-based compounds are smaller in size than the naked nucleic acids which have not been so treated (e.g., See Example 7 infra).
      <br/>
      The composition which condense and complex nucleic acid may also achieve one or more of the following effects, due to their physical, chemical or rheological properties: (1) Protect nucleic acid, for example plasmid DNA, from nucleases; (2) increase the area of contact between nucleic acid, such as plasmid DNA, through extracellular matrices and over cellular membranes, into which the nucleic acid is to be taken up; (3) concentrate nucleic acid, such as plasmid DNA, at cell surfaces due to water exclusion; (4) indirectly facilitate uptake of nucleic acid, such as plasmid DNA, either increasing interaction with cellular membranes and/or by perturbing cellular membranes due to osmotic, hydrophobic or lytic effects.

      By "increase the efficacy of transfection" is meant that a nucleic acid or oligonucleotide when administered to an organism in a composition comprising such a substance will be more readily taken up into the interior of a cell by translocating across the cellular membrane than if administered in a composition without such a substance, for example when administered in a formulation such as a saline solution.
      <br/>
      The increased efficiency of uptake of nucleic acid, or oligonucleotide into cells could occur, for example, due to a better steric fit between the composition containing the nucleic acid and a pit on the surface of the cellular membrane or due to protection of the nucleic acid from attack by nucleases.
    </p>

      In another preferred embodiment, the composition has a net positive charge ratio.
      <br/>
      By "net charge" is meant the resulting positive, negative or neutral character of a compound which is determined after balancing the total number of positive and negative charges possessed by a molecule or compound.
      <br/>
      For example, the DNA molecule, has a net negative charge due to the presence of two anionic phosphate moieties on each base pair of the molecule.
      <br/>
      The number of negatively charged phosphates exceed in number the total number of positive charges on the DNA molecule.
      <br/>
      Thus the surfeit of negative charges imparts a net negative character or charge to DNA.
      <br/>
      The number of negative charges to positive charges on compositions determines the net charge ratio.
      <br/>
      The net charge ratio is symbolized by (-/+) where a dash, "-", stands for a negative charge and a plus sign, "+", stands for a positive charge.
      <br/>
      A net charge ratio of 1:1(-/+) is neutral; of 2:1(-/+) is negative and of 1:2(-/+) is positive.

    <heading>DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
    <p num="63">
      The following are preferred embodiments of the present invention using compositions of chitosan-based compounds for delivery of nucleic acid and oligonucleotides to a cell.
      <br/>
      These embodiments are offered by way of illustration and are not intended to limit the invention in any manner.
    </p>
    <p num="64">I. Theory and Operation of Invention</p>
    <p num="65">
      An important goal of the current invention is to increase the efficacy of gene delivery and gene expression in target cells.
      <br/>
      Gene delivery is the first step in the process of ultimately obtaining expression of a product encoded by a nucleic acid targeted for delivery to a cell.
      <br/>
      One method of improving gene delivery is to effect the uptake of nucleic acid by cells.
      <br/>
      Uptake of nucleic acid by cells is dependent on a number of factors, one of which is the size of the composition carrying the nucleic acid or oligonucleotide to be expressed in the target cell.
      <br/>
      For instance, some investigators report a positive correlation between the degree of condensation of DNA in a complex to be delivered to a cell and the efficacy of cellular DNA uptake (Wagner et al., PNAS, Vol 88, 1991).
    </p>
    <p num="66">
      Accordingly, it would be desirable to find a substance able to complex and condense nucleic acids, protect them from degradation by nucleases and enable enhanced uptake by the target cell by either non-specific adsorptive mechanisms or receptor mediated endocytosis and also, permit attachment of additional moieties to the composition to enhance the ability of the composition to obtain expression of the product targeted to a cell.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, these substances should be easily available, biocompatible and capable of being modified to alter their physical, chemical and physiological properties.
      <br/>
      Such substances should be able to form compositions suitable for administration to an organism by various means such as, but not limited to, injection or oral delivery while maintaining or regaining the physical characteristics necessary to increase cellular uptake and expression of nucleic acids or oligonucleotides.
    </p>
    <p num="67">
      Chitosan is such a substance.
      <br/>
      However, the majority of pharmaceutically acceptable chitosan products have molecular weights ranging from 100-1,000 kDa.
      <br/>
      They have two distinct properties: i) higher molecular weight chitosans are usually only soluble in dilute acid solutions and are insoluble at pH&gt;6.5, and ii) aqueous acidic solutions of these chitosans are quite viscous.
      <br/>
      The present invention solves these problems by utilizing techniques for reducing the molecular weight of conventional chitosan-based compounds, thereby providing improved solubility and viscosity properties at physiologically relevant pH's.
    </p>
    <p num="68">
      The embodiments and examples below demonstrate how specific chitosan-based compositions stabilize and condense nucleic acid for cell delivery.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, these embodiments and examples demonstrate how surface and nuclear ligands can be used with a delivery peptide to target nucleic acid into the cellular interior and/or the cell nucleus.
      <br/>
      Such targeted delivery can be enhanced by use of a lysis agent and lipophilic peptides.
      <br/>
      It was found that though in vitro transfection results do not necessarily predict effective in vivo delivery, the chitosan-based compounds can be used in compositions which enhance in vivo delivery, as well as in vitro transfection of nucleic acids.
      <br/>
      Thus, the embodiments and examples include in vivo and in vitro techniques, various cellular or animal models and methods for inserting nucleic acid into cells.
    </p>
    <p num="69">
      Also supplied below are embodiments and examples of specific chitosan-based compositions that can be used to provide certain functionalities to the associated nucleic acid in the composition, and thus within a transformed cell or animal containing such a cell.
      <br/>
      Those in the art will recognize that specific moieties of the chitosan-based compounds can be identified as that containing the functional region providing the desirable properties of the composition.
      <br/>
      Such regions can be readily minimized using routine deletion, mutation, or modification techniques or their equivalent.
    </p>
    <p num="70">II. Utility of the Invention</p>
    <p num="71">
      The compositions of the present invention enhance delivery of nucleic acid into the cell preferably by delivering stabilized and condensed nucleic acid into the nucleus of the cell.
      <br/>
      These compositions can be used to treat diseases by enhancing delivery of specific nucleic acid to the appropriately targeted cells.
      <br/>
      These compositions can also be used to create transformed cells, as well as transgenic animals for assessing human disease in an animal model.
    </p>
    <p num="72">
      The present invention also features the use of compositions of chitosan-based compound with nucleic acid noncovalently bound to the chitosan-based compound that is capable of condensing the nucleic acid or oligonucleotide.
      <br/>
      These chitosan-based compounds provide small, condensed compositions, or reduced diameter compositions and more stable nucleic acid particles for delivery, thereby enhancing the transfection efficiency of the nucleic acid into the cell and into the nucleus.
    </p>
    <p num="73">
      By taking advantage of the characteristics of these compositions, the present invention enhances delivery of nucleic acid to a cell.
      <br/>
      The components of the compositions can be used alone, together or with other components of a nucleic acid carrier as disclosed in PCT publication WO 93/18759, Woo et al., entitled "A DNA Carrier System and Method of Use," the whole of which (including drawings) is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.
      <br/>
      The chitosan composition, together with lysis or lipophilic peptides can enhance the delivery of nucleic acid to cells by enhancing the release of stable, condensed nucleic acid from an endosome into the cellular interior.
    </p>
    <p num="74">
      In addition a composition with a chitosan-based compound, nucleic acid, and lysis agent, the present invention also features various compositions which can contain a targeting ligand for a cell surface receptor and a nuclear localization signal as well.
      <br/>
      The targeting ligands are capable of binding to a cell surface receptor and entering a cell through cytosis (e.g., endocytosis, potocytosis, pinocytosis).
      <br/>
      By using targeting ligands specific to certain cells, nucleic acid can be delivered using the chitosan-based compositions directly to the desired tissue.
      <br/>
      The nuclear localization signal are capable of recognizing and transporting nucleic acid through the nuclear membrane to the nucleus of the cell.
      <br/>
      Such nuclear localization signals help enhance the compositions ability to target nucleic acid to the cell nucleus.
    </p>
    <p num="75">
      The abilities of the above chitosan-based compositions to deliver nucleic acid to specific cells and to the nucleus also allows transgenic animal models to be used for the dissection of molecular carcinogenesis and disease, assessing potential chemical and physical carcinogens and tumor promoters, exploring model therapeutic avenues as well as livestock agricultural purposes.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, the above chitosan-based compositions permit methods for administration and treatment of various diseases.
      <br/>
      In addition, the above chitosan-based compositions can transform cells to produce particular proteins, polypeptides, and/or RNA.
      <br/>
      Likewise, chitosan-based compositions can be used in vitro with tissue culture cells.
      <br/>
      In vitro uses allow the role of various nucleic acids to be studied by targeting specific expression into specifically targeted tissue culture cells.

      A variety of proteins and polypeptides can be expressed by the sequence in the nucleic acid cassette in the transfected cells.

      Transfection by ex vivo techniques includes co-transfecting the cells with nucleic acid containing a selectable marker.

      This selectable marker is used to select those cells which have become transfected.

      For example, one approach to nucleic acid delivery for hepatic diseases is to remove hepatocytes from an affected individual, genetically alter them in vitro, and re-implant them into a receptive locus.
      <br/>
      The ex vivo approach includes the steps of harvesting hepatocytes, cultivating the hepatocytes, transducing or transfecting the hepatocytes, and introducing the transfected hepatocytes into the affected individual.
    </p>
    <p num="98">
      The hepatocytes may be obtained in a variety of ways.
      <br/>
      They may be taken from the individual who is to be later injected with the hepatocytes that have been transfected or they can be collected from other sources, transfected and then injected into the individual of interest.
    </p>
    <p num="99">
      Once the ex vivo hepatocyte is collected, it may be transfected by contacting the hepatocytes with media containing the chitosan-based composition and maintaining the cultured hepatocytes in the media for sufficient time and under conditions appropriate for uptake and transfection of the hepatocytes.
      <br/>
      The hepatocytes may then be introduced into an orthotopic location (the body of the liver or the portal vasculature) or heterotopic locations by injection of cell suspensions into tissues.
      <br/>
      One skilled in the art will recognize that the cell suspension may contain: salts, buffers or nutrients to maintain viability of the cells; proteins to ensure cell stability; and factors to promote angiogenesis and growth of the implanted cells.
    </p>
    <p num="100">
      In an alternative method, harvested hepatocytes may be grown ex vivo on a matrix consisting of plastics, fibers or gelatinous materials which may be surgically implanted in an orthotopic or heterotopic location after transduction.

    <p num="102">
      Chitosan-based compositions of the present invention can also be used in reversing or arresting the progression of disease involving the liver, such as liver cancer.
      <br/>
      One embodiment involves use of intravenous methods of administration to delivery nucleic acid encoding for a necessary molecule to treat disease in the liver.
      <br/>
      Chitosan-based compositions which express a necessary protein or RNA can be directly injected into the liver or blood supply so as to travel directly to the liver.
    </p>
    <p num="103">VI. Direct DNA Delivery to Muscle</p>
    <p num="104">
      The muscular dystrophies are a group of diseases that result in abnormal muscle development, due to many different reasons.
      <br/>
      These diseases can be treated by using the direct delivery of genes with the chitosan-based compositions of the present invention resulting in the production of normal gene product.
      <br/>
      Delivery to the muscle using the present invention is done to present genes that produce various antigens for vaccines against a multitude of infections of both viral, bacterial, and parasitic origin.
      <br/>
      The detrimental effects caused by aging can also be treated using the chitosan-based compositions described herein.
      <br/>
      Since the injection of the growth hormone protein promotes growth and proliferation of muscle tissue, the growth hormone gene can be delivered to muscle, resulting in both muscle growth and development, which is decreased during the later portions of the aging process.
      <br/>
      Genes expressing other growth related factors can be delivered, such as Insulin Like Growth Factor-1 (IGF-1).
      <br/>
      Furthermore, any number of different genes may be delivered by this method to the muscle tissue.
    </p>
    <p num="105">
      IGF-1 can be used to deliver DNA to muscle, since it undergoes uptake into cells by receptor-mediated endocytosis.
      <br/>
      This polypeptide is 70 amino acids in length and is a member of the growth promoting polypeptides structurally related to insulin.
      <br/>
      It is involved in the regulation of tissue growth and cellular differentiation affecting the proliferation and metabolic activities of a wide variety of cell types, since the polypeptide has receptors on many types of tissue.
      <br/>
      As a result, the chitosan-based compositions of the present invention can utilize IGF-1 as a ligand for tissue-specific nucleic acid delivery to muscle.
      <br/>
      The advantage of a IGF-1/nucleic acid delivery system is that the specificity and the efficiency of the delivery is greatly increased due to a great number of cells coming into contact with the ligand/composition with uptake through receptor-mediated endocytosis.
      <br/>
      Using the nucleic acid described above in the chitosan-based compositions of the present invention with the use of specific ligands for the delivery of nucleic acid to muscle cells provides treatment of diseases and abnormalities that affect muscle tissues.
    </p>
    <p num="106">VII. Direct DNA Delivery to Osteogenic Cells</p>
    <p num="107">
      There are many other problems that occur during the aging process, but one major problem is osteoporosis, which is the decrease in overall bone mass and strength.
      <br/>
      The direct delivery chitosan-based compositions of the present invention can be used to deliver genes to cells that promote bone growth.
      <br/>
      The osteoblasts are the main bone forming cell in the body, but there are other cells that are capable of aiding in bone formation.
      <br/>
      The stromal cells of the bone marrow are the source of stem cells for osteoblasts.
      <br/>
      The stromal cells differentiate into a population of cells known as Inducible Osteoprogenitor Cells (IOPC), which then under induction of growth factors, differentiate into Determined Osteoprogenitor Cells (DOPC).
      <br/>
      It is this population of cells that mature directly into bone producing cells.
      <br/>
      The IOPCs are also found in muscle and soft connective tissues.
      <br/>
      Another cell involved in the bone formation process is the cartilage-producing cell known as the chondrocyte.
    </p>
    <p num="108">
      A factor identified to be involved in stimulating the IOPCs to differentiate is known as Bone Morphogenetic Protein (BMP).
      <br/>
      This 19,000 MW protein was first identified from demineralized bone.
      <br/>
      Another similar factor is Cartilage Induction Factor (CIF), which also functions to stimulate IOPCs to differentiate thereby initiating cartilage formation, cartilage calcification, vascular invasion, resorption of calcified cartilage, and finally induction of new bone formation.
      <br/>
      Cartilage Induction Factor has been identified as being homologous to Transfecting Growth Factor  BETA .
    </p>
    <p num="109">
      Since osteoblasts are involved in bone production, genes that enhance osteoblast activity can be delivered directly to these cells.
      <br/>
      Genes can also be delivered to the IOPCs and the chondrocytes, which can differentiate into osteoblasts, leading to bone formation.
      <br/>
      BMP and CIF are the ligands that can be used to deliver genes to these cells.
      <br/>
      Genes delivered to these cells promote bone formation or the proliferation of osteoblasts.
      <br/>
      The polypeptide, IGF-1 stimulates growth in hypophysectomized rats which could be due to specific uptake of the polypeptide by osteoblasts or by the interaction of the polypeptide with chondrocytes, which result in the formation of osteoblasts.
      <br/>
      Other specific bone cell and growth factors can be used through the interaction with various cells involved in bone formation to promote osteogenesis.
    </p>
    <p num="110">
      Nonlimiting examples of genes expressing the following growth factors which can be delivered to these cell types are Insulin, Insulin-Like Growth Factor-1, Insulin-Like Growth Factor-2, Epidermal Growth Factor, Transfecting Growth Factor- ALPHA , Transfecting Growth Factor- BETA , Platelet Derived Growth Factor, Acidic Fibroblast Growth Factor, Basic Fibroblast Growth Factor, Bone Derived Growth Factors, Bone Morphogenetic Protein, Cartilage Induction Factor, Estradiol, and Growth Hormone.
      <br/>
      All of these factors have a positive effect on the proliferation of osteoblasts, the related stem cells, and chondrocytes.
      <br/>
      As a result, BMP or CIF can be used as conjugates to deliver genes that express these growth factors to the target cells by the intravenous injection of the nucleic acid/chitosan compositions of the present invention.
      <br/>
      Using the nucleic acid described above in the chitosan-based compositions of the present invention with the use of specific ligands for the delivery of nucleic acid to bone cells provides treatment of diseases and abnormalities that affect bone tissues.

    <p num="111">VIII. Direct DNA Delivery to the Synoviocytes</p>
    <p num="112">
      The inflammatory attack on joints in animal models and human diseases may be mediated, in part, by secretion of cytokines such as IL-1 and IL-6 which stimulate the local inflammatory response.
      <br/>
      The inflammatory reaction may be modified by local secretion of soluble fragments of the receptors for these ligands.
      <br/>
      The complex between the ligand and the soluble receptor prevents the ligand from binding to the receptor is normally present on the surface of cells, thus preventing the stimulation of the inflammatory effect.
    </p>
    <p num="113">
      Therapy consists of the construction of a vector containing the soluble form of receptors for appropriate cytokines (for example, IL-1), together with promoters capable of inducing high level expression in structures of the joint and composition which enables efficient uptake of this vector.
      <br/>
      This composition is then used with the nucleic acid carried by the chitosan-based compositions of the present invention.
      <br/>
      This DNA is injected into affected joints where the secretion of an inhibitor for IL-1 such as a soluble IL-1 receptor or natural IL-I inhibitor modifies the local inflammatory response and resulting arthritis.
    </p>
    <p num="114">
      This method is useful in treating episodes of arthritis which characterize many "autoimmune" or "collagen vascular" diseases.
      <br/>
      This method can also prevent disabling injury of large joints by inflammatory arthritis.
    </p>
    <p num="115">
      In addition to the above, the present invention can also be used with the following method.
      <br/>
      Current therapy for severe arthritis involves the administration of pharmacological agents including steroids to depress the inflammatory response.
      <br/>
      Steroids can be administered systemically or locally by direct injection into the joint space.
    </p>
    <p num="116">
      Steroids normally function by binding to receptors within the cytoplasm of cells.
      <br/>
      Formation of the steroid-receptor complex changes the structure of the receptor so that it becomes capable of translocating to the nucleus and binding to specific sequences within the genome of the cell and altering the expression of specific genes.
      <br/>
      Genetic modifications of the steroid receptor can be made which enable this receptor to bind naturally occurring steroids with higher affinity, or bind non-natural, synthetic steroids, such as RU486.
      <br/>
      Other modifications can be made to create steroid receptor which is "constitutively active" meaning that it is capable of binding to DNA and regulating gene expression in the absence of steroid in the same way that the natural steroid receptor regulates gene expression after treatment with natural or synthetic steroids.
    </p>
    <p num="117">
      Of particular importance is the effect of glucocorticoid steroids such as cortisone, hydrocortisone, prednisone, or dexamethasone which are the most important drugs available for the treatment of arthritis.
      <br/>
      One approach to treating arthritis is to introduce a vector in which the nucleic acid cassette expresses a genetically modified steroid receptor into cells of the joint, e.g., a genetically modified steroid receptor which mimics the effect of glucocorticoids but does not require the presence of glucocorticoids for effect.
      <br/>
      This is termed the glucocortico-mimetic receptor.
      <br/>
      This is achieved by expression of a constitutively active steroid receptor within cells of the joint which contains the DNA binding domain of a glucocorticoid receptor.
      <br/>
      This induces the therapeutic effects of steroids without the systemic toxicity of these drugs.
    </p>
    <p num="118">
      Alternatively, steroid receptors which have a higher affinity for natural or synthetic glucocorticoids, such as RU486, can be introduced into the joint.
      <br/>
      These receptors exert an increased anti-inflammatory effect when stimulated by non-toxic concentrations of steroids or lower doses of pharmacologically administered steroids.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, constitution of a steroid receptor which is activated by a novel, normally-inert steroid enables the use of drugs which would affect only cells taking up this receptor.
      <br/>
      These strategies obtain a therapeutic effect from steroids on arthritis without the profound systemic complications associated with these drugs.
      <br/>
      Of particular importance is the ability to target these genes differentially to specific cell types (for example synovial cells versus lymphocytes) to affect the activity of these cells.
    </p>
    <p num="119">
      As described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,364,791 to Vegeto, et al., entitled "Progesterone Receptor Having C Terminal Hormone Binding Domain Truncations," and U.S. application, Ser.
      <br/>
      No. 07/939,246, entitled "Mutated Steroid Hormone Receptors, Methods for Their Use and Molecular Switch for Gene Therapy," Vegeto, et al., filed Sep. 2, 1992, both hereby incorporated by reference (including drawings), genetically modified receptors, such as the glucocortico-mimetic receptor, can be used to create novel steroid receptors including those with glucocortico-mimetic activity.
      <br/>
      The steroid receptor family of gene regulatory proteins is an ideal set of such molecules.
      <br/>
      These proteins are ligand activated transcription factors whose ligands can range from steroids to retinoids, fatty acids, vitamins, thyroid hormones and other presently unidentified small molecules.
      <br/>
      These compounds bind to receptors and either up-regulate or down-regulate transcription.
    </p>
    <p num="120">
      The preferred receptor of the present invention is modification of the glucocorticoid receptor, i.e., the glucocorticoid-mimetic receptor.
      <br/>
      These receptors can be modified to allow them to bind various ligands whose structure differs from naturally occurring ligands, e.g., RU486. For example, small C-terminal alterations in amino acid sequence, including truncation, result in altered affinity and altered function of the ligand.
      <br/>
      By screening receptor mutants, receptors can be customized to respond to ligands which do not activate the host cells own receptors.
    </p>
    <p num="121">
      A person having ordinary skill in the art will recognize, however, that various mutations, for example, a shorter deletion of carboxy terminal amino acids, will be necessary to create useful mutants of certain steroid hormone receptor proteins.
      <br/>
      Steroid hormone receptors which may be mutated are any of those receptors which comprise the steroid hormone receptor super family, such as receptors including the estrogen, progesterone, glucocorticoid- ALPHA , glucocorticoid- BETA , mineral corticoid, androgen, thyroid hormone, retinoic acid, and Vitamin B3 receptors.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, DNA encoding for other mutated steroids such as those which are capable of only transrepression or of only transactivation are also within the scope of the above embodiment.
      <br/>
      Such steroids could be capable of responding to RU486 in order to activate transrepression.
    </p>
    <p num="122">
      In addition to the above, the present invention can also be used with the following method.
      <br/>
      Drugs which inhibit the enzyme prostaglandin synthase are important agents in the treatment of arthritis.
      <br/>
      This is due, in part, to the important role of certain prostaglandin in stimulating the local immune response.
      <br/>
      Salicylates are widely used drugs but can be administered in limited doses which are often inadequate for severe forms of arthritis.
    </p>
    <p num="123">
      Gene transfer using the present invention is used to inhibit the action of prostaglandin synthase specifically in affected joints by the expression of an antisense RNA for prostaglandin synthase.
      <br/>
      The complex formed between the antisense RNA and mRNA for prostaglandin synthase interferes with the proper processing and translation of this mRNA and lowers the levels of this enzyme in treated cells.
      <br/>
      Alternatively RNA molecules are used for forming a triple helix in regulatory regions of genes expressing enzymes required for prostaglandin synthesis.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, RNA molecules are identified which bind the active site of enzymes required for prostaglandin synthesis and inhibit this activity.
    </p>
    <p num="124">
      Alternatively, genes encoding enzymes which alter prostaglandin metabolism can be transferred into the joint.
      <br/>
      These have an important anti-inflammatory effect by altering the chemical composition or concentration of inflammatory prostaglandin.
    </p>
    <p num="125">
      Likewise, the present invention is useful for enhancing repair and regeneration of the joints.
      <br/>
      The regenerative capacity of the joint is limited by the fact that chondrocytes are not capable of remodeling and repairing cartilaginous tissues such as tendons and cartilage.
      <br/>
      Further, collagen which is produced in response to injury is of a different type lacking the tensile strength of normal collagen.
      <br/>
      Further, the injury collagen is not remodeled effectively by available collagenase.
      <br/>
      In addition, inappropriate expression of certain metalloproteinases is a component in the destruction of the joint.
    </p>
    <p num="126">Gene transfer using promoters specific to chondrocytes (i.e., collagen promoters) is used to express different collagens or appropriate collagenase for the purpose of improving the restoration of function in the joints and prevent scar formation.</p>
    <p num="127">
      Gene transfer for these purposes is affected by direct introduction of nucleic acid into the joint space where it comes into contact with chondrocytes and synovial cells.
      <br/>
      Further, the genes permeate into the environment of the joint where they are taken up by fibroblasts, myoblasts, and other constituents of periarticular tissue.

      Then to different volumes of 0.5 ml of 4 M acetic acid/acetate buffer (pH 5.5) was added the sample (i.e., 100-500 ml).

      Each solution was standardized to a volume of 1 ml with water.

      Then, 2 ml ninhydrin reagent (J. L. Bailey. In: Techniques in Protein Chemistry. (1967) 348-349.

      The samples were incubated at 100 (degree)  C. for 20 minutes and cooled on ice to 0 (degree)  C. The absorbance of each sample was measured at 570 nm against a ninhydrin reagent blank.

      In initial studies designed to show that chitosan could complex and condense DNA into a compact particle, a correlation was found between the molecular weight of the commercially available chitosans and the resulting particle size of the complex formed with DNA, irrespective of the ratio of DNA to chitosan.
      <br/>
      The particle size of the resulting complex increased proportionally to the molecular weight of the chitosan substance used (i.e., SEACURE 340&gt;SEACURE 243&gt;SEACURE 143).
      <br/>
      This effect could be due to solubility differences with the chitosan substances since solubility of chitosan is known to increase as molecular weight of the substance decreases (i.e., SEACURE 143&gt;SEACURE 243&gt;SEACURE 340).
      <br/>
      Further evidence to support the solubility effect was reported by Shiraishi et al., J. Contr. Rel., 25 217-225 (1993); and T. Imai et al., Int. J. Pharm., 67 11-20(1991) both incorporated by reference in their entirety including drawings and figures.
      <br/>
      Shiraishi et al., report that lower molecular weight chitosans interact with indomethacin through hydrophobic and ionic interactions and that the extent of interaction depends on the molecular weight of chitosan.
      <br/>
      However, the intermolecular and intramolecular interactions, which promote complexation, increased with increasing molecular weight of chitosan.
      <br/>
      Nevertheless, the authors demonstrated that the release of indomethacin from the complex with chitosan was dominated by penetration of water into the substance matrix.
      <br/>
      Whereas chitosans of lower molecular weight (having increased solubility), allowed more water penetration.
      <br/>
      Higher molecular weight chitosans (having decreased solubility), caused substantial dehydration of the composition.
      <br/>
      Analogous to this effect, DNA compositions made with higher molecular weight chitosan should theoretically have reduced solubility resulting in aggregation and/or larger particle size.
      <br/>
      Such results were observed by us.
    </p>
    <p num="149">Example 5</p>
    <p num="150">Preparation of Low Molecular Weight Chitosans</p>
    <p num="151">
      As a result of the effect observed with chitosans having different molecular weights in Example 4, we hypothesized that the preparation of even smaller chitosan-based compositions would require the use of even lower molecular weight chitosans which were not commercially available.
      <br/>
      Thus, we modified a process for sodium nitrite de-polymerization of chitosan as described by Peniston et al. U.S. Pat. No. 3,922,260 to produce such lower molecular weight chitosans.
    </p>
    <p num="152">
      Peniston et al., describe the deaminative cleavage of chitosan into reduced chain-length oligomers to reduce viscosity, increase solubility, or to generally alter the molecular characteristics of chitosan as a polyelectrolyte.
      <br/>
      In Peninston et al's. reaction, sodium nitrite is converted to the reactive species nitrous acid by treatment with a strong acid (i.e., 6% acetic acid).
      <br/>
      Nitrous acid reacts only with the glucosamine moieties on chitosan, not the N-acetylglucosamine units.
      <br/>
      The reaction is believed to form a highly unstable diazonium salt which leads to the evolution of nitrogen and the replacement of the original amino group with a hydroxyl group resulting in a 2,5-anhydro-D-mannose residue at the new reducing end.
      <br/>
      In some instances, the reduced end results in the formation of olefins.
      <br/>
      In general, the release of nitrogen is stoichiometric with the loss of the amino group so that quantification of the released nitrogen gas can be directly correlated to the percentage (%) of deamination that has occurred.
    </p>
    <p num="153">
      Peniston et al., note that the nitrous acid reaction with chitosan results in an unexpected marked decrease in viscosity (and thus, molecular weight) with only small changes in percent (%) amine content.
      <br/>
      Thus, we anticipated that the nitrous acid induced deamination of higher molecular weight chitosan may be useful for reducing its molecular weight without causing a large reduction in the amine content which is needed for complexing and condensing DNA.
    </p>
    <p num="154">
      We also considered utilizing an alternative de-polymerization process for chitosan involving the treatment of chitosan with concentrated HCl at elevated temperatures (A. D. Domard and N. Cartier. Glucosamine Oligomers: 1.

      <br/>
      Int. J. Biol. Macromol., 11 (1989) 297-302).
      <br/>
      This chemical method appeared suitable for making very pure chitosan oligomers, however separation of the product is difficult and costly and typically results in oligomers with very low degrees of polymerization (i.e., DP=20-37).

      A decrease in the molecular weight of chitosan was observed with increasing treatment by sodium nitrite.
      <br/>
      The decrease in molecular weight, as determined by gel permeation chromatography, also correlated well with the reduction in viscosity of 4 mg/ml solutions.
      <br/>
      The substantial loss in molecular weight of chitosan was not associated with a corresponding loss of nitrogen or amine content.
      <br/>
      However, we obtained a deacetylation value of 56% using the modified ninhydrin assay for SEACURE 143.
      <br/>
      This value was lower than the deacetylation value for SEACURE 143 specified by the manufacturer (78.9%).
      <br/>
      It is unclear why we obtained this lower value, since complexation and gel retardation assays confirmed the percentage amine content of the SEACURE 143 obtained from the manufacturer as 78.9%.
    </p>
    <p num="160">However, the modified ninhydrin assay did confirm that the amine percentage of chitosans treated with sodium nitrite did not change appreciably, although the molecular weight was markedly reduced.</p>
    <p num="161">
      Support for the creation of olefin byproducts as a result of sodium nitrite treatment of chitosan was supported by the observation of a positive absorbance peak at 280 nm in the treated chitosan compounds.

      The absorbance values were directly proportional to the amount of sodium nitrite treatment.
      <br/>
      Although the presence of the olefin side product reduced the "purity" of the chitosan oligomers, the ability to accurately quantify the concentration of chitosan oligomer in solution proved to be very useful in characterizing solutions and formed compositions.

      These results support the fact that increased solubility of chitosan oligomers led directly to smaller and more stable compositions with increased colloidal solubility.
      <br/>
      The final pH of these DNA:Chitosan compositions ranged from pH 5 (for high molecular weight chitosan-based compositions to pH 7.4 (for lower molecular weight chitosan compositions).

      This effect becomes more pronounced when the concentration of the TVP peptide is increased.

    <p num="204">In Vitro Transfection Using Chitosan/Nucleic Acid Complex</p>
    <p num="205">We assessed in vitro cell transfection using chitosan compositions depicted in FIG. 6A.</p>
    <p num="206">
      Rabbit synoviocytes(HIG-82) plated in 24-well plates (100,000 cells/well) were incubated overnight in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and with compositions prepared in water with and without the inclusion of varying amounts of lytic peptide.
      <br/>
      Final DNA concentration was 200  MU g/ml.
      <br/>
      Media was removed from the cells (40-60% confluent) and fresh media (DMEM with 10% FBS) was added prior to the addition of the compositions.
      <br/>
      For all compositions, 50 ml (10  MU ng CMV-Bgal) was added.
      <br/>
      Cells were incubated with the compositions for 48 hours then removed, and washed with PBS (pH 7.4).
      <br/>
      Galacto-Light (tm)  cell lysate solution was added including 1 mm DTT.
      <br/>
      A chemiluminescence detection system for B-galactosidase (Galacto-Light (tm) ) was used to determine the Relative Light Units (RLU) per mg cell lysate protein (RLU/mg protein).
      <br/>
      Total protein content in cell lysates were measured with a Coomassie Blue G250-based assay (Bio-Rad; Hercules, Calif.).
    </p>
    <p num="207">
      The efficiency of cell transfection of the compositions is shown in FIG. 8.
      <br/>
      The transfection efficiency of the composition was positively correlated with increasing positive charge.
    </p>
    <p num="208">However, the transfection efficiency correlated poorly with the molecular weight of the chitosan used.</p>
    <p num="209">
      Addition of lytic peptide to the composition increased the transfection efficiency only with the addition of small amounts of large molecular weight chitosan (90 kDa and 70 kDa) or the addition of large amounts of smaller molecular weight chitosans.
      <br/>
      This effect may be related to the size of the compositions and the inherent stability in solution.
      <br/>
      The interaction of the compositions with 10% FBS may also be a contributing factor.
    </p>
    <p num="210">Methods of Preparation of Cell Extracts From Tissue Culture Cells</p>
    <p num="211">
      (1) Aliquot the required amount of Lysis Solution.
      <br/>
      Add fresh DTT to 1 mM. (2) Rinse cells 2 times with 1 * Phosphate Buffered Saline (PBS). (3) Add Lysis Solution to cover the cells (250  MU l of Lysis Buffer for a 60 mm culture plate should be adequate). (4) Detach cells from culture plate using a rubber policeman or equivalent.
      <br/>
      Non-adherent cells should be pelleted and lysis buffer should be added sufficient to cover the cells.
      <br/>
      The cells should then be resuspended in the lysis buffer by pipetting. (5) Transfer cells to a microfuge tube and centrifuge for 2 minutes to pellet any debris. (6) Transfer supernatant to a fresh microfuge tube.

    <p num="213">Oral Administration of Chitosan/Nucleic Acid Complex</p>
    <p num="214">
      A preferred route of administration of chitosan-based compositions is orally.
      <br/>
      Oral administration may best utilize the beneficial properties of chitosan (as discussed above).
      <br/>
      Oral administration permits chitosan-based compositions to be taken up by various cell types throughout the entire length of the alimentary canal thereby allowing the expression of therapeutic products locally and/or systemically.
      <br/>
      Chitosan administration has been examined in the gut to determine its bioadhesive properties.

      Additionally, chitosan has been approved by the FDA as a food additive.
