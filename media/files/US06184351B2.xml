      The present invention provides alpha-synuclein mutations which accelerate alpha-synuclein aggregation and can thus be utilized for transgenic animal production and generation of the first progressive PD model.

    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">
      Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive, degenerative neurologic disorder which usually occurs in late mid-life, and is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder, after Alzheimer's disease.
      <br/>
      PD predominantly affects dopaminergic neurons in the nigrastriatal system but also several other regions of the brain, and is clinically characterized by bradykinesia, tremor, and rigidity.
    </p>
    <p num="3">
      Bradykinesia, a slowness or "poverty" of movement, slows the pace of such ultilitarian activities as walking and eating, and also makes movements that were once second nature take on a ponderous and deliberate quality.
      <br/>
      Tremor is a shakiness that generally affects limbs that are not otherwise in motion.
      <br/>
      For those PD patients diagnosed at a relatively young age, tremor is reported as the most disabling symptom.
      <br/>
      Older patients say their greatest challenge is walking or keeping their balance.
      <br/>
      Rigidity is caused by the inability of muscles to relax as opposing muscle groups contract, causing tension which can produce aches and pains in the back, neck, shoulders, temples, or chest.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      PD is pathologically characterized by nerve cell loss in the substantia nigra and by the presence of intracytoplasmic Lewy bodies.
      <br/>
      A presynaptic protein, called  ALPHA -synuclein, has been detected in Lewy bodies and shown to be the major filamentous component in Lewy bodies in PD; Spillantini et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., 95:6469-6473 (1998).
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      Synuclein was originally cloned and identified as a synaptic protein in torpedo; Maroteaux et al., J. Neurosci., 8:2804-2815 (1988) and later bovine; Nakjo et al., Eur. J. Biochem., 217:1057-1063 (1993), rat; Maroteaux et al., Mol. Brain Res., 11:335-343 (1991), and human (precursor of the non-A BETA  component of Alzheimer's disease amyloid(NACP)); Ueda et al., Proc. Natl. Aca. Sci. USA, 90:11282-11286 (1993).
      <br/>
      Subsequent studies showed that there are two types of synucleins,  ALPHA  and  BETA , and NACP is analogous to  ALPHA -synuclein; Iwai et al., Neuron, 14:467-475 (1994).
      <br/>
      The function of  ALPHA -synuclein is unknown, but two naturally occurring mutations in  ALPHA -synuclein, A53T and A30P, have been linked to familial early-onset PD; Polymeropoulos, et al., Science, 276:2045-2047 (1997); Kruger et al., Nat. Genet., 18:106-108 (1998).
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      Baba et al., Am. J. Pathol., 152:879-884 (1998) reported data strongly implicating  ALPHA -synuclein in the selective degeneration of neurons in sporadic PD.
      <br/>
      Baba et al. suggest that the mechanisms leading to the selective incorporation of  ALPHA -synuclein into Lewy bodies probably involve alterations in the metabolism of  ALPHA -synuclein that render it insoluble and prone to aggregation.
      <br/>
      Baba et al. thus postulate that wild type  ALPHA -synuclein probably plays a role in the pathogenesis of sporadic PD, and that the A53T substitution in  ALPHA -synuclein may augment the process.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      Conway et al., Nature Medicine, 4:1318-1320 (1998) then reported that the naturally occurring  ALPHA -synuclein mutations, A53T and A30P, may promote PD pathogenesis by accelerating  ALPHA -synuclein fibril formation, which may be an early step in Lewy body formation.
      <br/>
      Conway et al. utilize an in vitro fibrillization assay; Harper et al., Ann. Rev. Biochem., 66:385-407 (1997), and present data demonstrating that both mutant forms, at high concentrations, form Lewy body-like fibrils and discrete spherical assemblies; most rapidly by the A53T mutant.
      <br/>
      Based on their findings, Conway et al. postulate that inhibiting  ALPHA -synuclein fibrillization may be an effective therapeutic strategy against the disease.
      <br/>
      Conway et al. also state that the in vitro fibrillization assay may allow compound libraries to be screened to identify such  ALPHA -synuclein fibrillization inhibitors.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      Despite these reports and other extensive PD research conducted to date, there is still no known cure for PD.
      <br/>
      Deprenyl (selegiline), begun early in the disorder, can slow progression of the disease, and there is also evidence that "antioxidants" such as vitamin E and selenium may be of some benefit.
      <br/>
      There clearly exists the need for improved means of diagnosis and treatment of PD.
    </p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="9">It is therefore an object of the present invention to address this need by providing artificial  ALPHA -synuclein super-mutants which demonstrate accelerated aggregation as compared to naturally occurring mutants and which can be utilized for transgenic animal production, and subsequent generation of the first progressive PD model.</p>
    <p num="10">Also provided is an in vitro aggregation assay which can be used to evaluate  ALPHA -synuclein super-mutants, and which can be formatted to allow for the high throughput screening for  ALPHA -synuclein nucleation inhibitors for the treatment of PD.</p>

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="12">The term "isolated polypeptide" refers to a polypeptide of the invention that is free from at least one contaminating polypeptide that is found in its natural environment, and preferably substantially free from any other contaminating mammalian polypeptides which would interfere with its therapeutic or diagnostic use.</p>
    <p num="13">
      To perform the studies of the present invention, human  ALPHA -synuclein cDNA; Ueda et al., Proc. Natl. Aca. Sci. USA, 90:11282-11286 (1993) was cloned, and bacterial expression constructs generated for the wild type protein, the A53T mutant, the A30P mutant, a form containing both the A53T and A30P mutations, and various other mutant forms.
      <br/>
      The wild type  ALPHA -synuclein protein sequence used as a template for production of the various mutants of the present invention is that found in SEQ ID NO:1.
    </p>
    <p num="14">
      To perform the analysis on the various  ALPHA -synuclein proteins, an in vitro assay was designed to look specifically for instances of accelerated  ALPHA -synuclein aggregation.
      <br/>
      The assay generally comprises: concentrating the test sample to 2-7 mg/ml; sterile filtering the sample through 0.22 micron filters to remove any particulate matter; incubating the sample over a specified period of time at 37 (degree)  C. with defined agitation; centrifuging aliquots of the incubated samples at predetermined times; and analyzing the pellet and supernatant of the aliquoted sample using various conventional techniques.
    </p>
    <p num="15">
      When the various  ALPHA -synuclein proteins of the prior art were tested in the assay of the present invention, it was demonstrated that wild type  ALPHA -synuclein, the naturally occurring A53T mutant form, and the naturally occurring A30P mutant form of  ALPHA -synuclein can spontaneously form fibrillar  BETA -sheet aggregates.
      <br/>
      It was also observed that in a complete aggregation time course,  ALPHA -synuclein aggregation is slow and displays a distinct lag phase.
      <br/>
      And, importantly, the naturally occurring  ALPHA -synuclein mutants each showed a reduced lag phase with respect to wild type  ALPHA -synuclein, and enhanced the aggregation tendency observed in the wild type protein.
      <br/>
      This is critical, because a pathogenesis model which can cover all known mutants plus the wild type situation is less likely to be based on non disease relevant effects.
      <br/>
      For example, in the Alzheimer's disease field the key evidence for the amyloid hypothesis is the finding that all known early onset familial Alzheimer's disease mutations have one common effect: they increase A BETA 42 production compared to the wild type; Hardy, J., Trends Neurosci., 20:154-159 (1997).
    </p>
    <p num="16">
      We hypothesized that the accelerated aggregation observed with both naturally occurring  ALPHA -synuclein mutants was due to an increased tendency to assume the  BETA -sheet conformation found in the aggregates.
      <br/>
      Thus, other mutations that would cause destabilization of the  ALPHA -helix and stabilization of  BETA -sheet would be predicted to aggregate faster than the wild type protein, possibly even faster than the naturally occurring mutants.
      <br/>
      In view of this hypothesis, various other mutants were designed and tested.
      <br/>
      The first such mutant was a A53T/A30P double mutant, and it was demonstrated that this double mutant aggregated faster than each of the naturally occurring mutants, although the phenomenon was not observed in every instance.
      <br/>
      We then used several secondary structure prediction algorithms to design other artificial super-mutants; looking specifically for mutations which might further destabilize  ALPHA -helix and enhance stabilization of  BETA -sheets, and thus further accelerate aggregation in vitro.
      <br/>
      Standard references which describe algorithms useful for the secondary structure prediction include e.g., Chou and Fasman, Adv. in Enzymol., 47:45-148 (1978) and Garnier et al., J. Mol. Biol., 120:97 (1978).

      We believe that very rapidly aggregating mutant  ALPHA -synuclein is critical for the successful generation of a transgenic model of Lewy body formation, which can then be utilized to see whether such mice develop Parkinsonian symptoms.

      Using the secondary structure prediction algorithms, three mutants, E83Q/A90V (SEQ ID NO:2), H50Y/A53T (SEQ ID NO:3), and H50T/A53T/A76T (SEQ ID NO:4), were designed and tested in the in vitro assay.

      In each instance, the mutants demonstrated enhanced aggregation, with the H50T/A53T/A76T mutant showing the most dramatic effect.

      Each of these super-mutants were used for transgenic animal production with the goal of generating the first progressive Parkinson's disease model.

      It was also observed that the aggregate formation was faster for the mutant forms than for the wild type, and the A53T and A30P/A53T mutations had a more dramatic effect than the A30P mutation.
