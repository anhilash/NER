      Power consumption in medical and battery powered devices is reduced through the use and operation of a data monitor which measures, senses or detects signals, inputs or outputs in a medical device before they are input to a principal or main digital signal processor, controller or microprocessor.
      <br/>
      In response to detecting or measuring such a signal which meets certain amplitude, frequency and/or phase characteristics, the data monitor directs or controls voltage supply circuits to increase or decrease the voltages provided to certain circuits within the medical device.
      <br/>
      The voltages so employed are tailored to reduce the amount of power consumed by the medical device while preserving computational performance.

    <heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">The present invention relates to the reduction of power consumption in integrated circuit designs, such as integrated circuits employed in medical devices, particularly implantable medical devices.</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="3">
      Various devices require operation with low power consumption.
      <br/>
      For example, hand-held communication devices require such low power consumption and, in particular, implantable medical devices require low power capabilities.
      <br/>
      With respect to implantable medical devices, for example, microprocessor-based implantable cardiac devices, such as implantable pacemakers and defibrillators, are required to operate with a lower power consumption to increase battery life and device longevity.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      Generally, such low power devices are designed using complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) technology.
      <br/>
      CMOS technology is generally used because such technology has the characteristic of substantially zero "static" power consumption.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      Power consumption of CMOS circuits consists generally of two power consumption factors, namely "dynamic" power consumption and static power consumption.
      <br/>
      Static power consumption is only due to current leakage as the quiescent current of such circuits is zero.
      <br/>
      Dynamic power consumption is the dominant factor of power consumption for CMOS technology.
      <br/>
      Dynamic power consumption is basically due to the current required to charge internal and load capacitances during switching, i.e., the charging and discharging of such capacitances.
      <br/>
      Dynamic power (P) equals: 1/2CVDD2 F, where C is nodal capacitance, F is the clock or switching frequency, and VDD is the supply voltage for the CMOS circuit.
      <br/>
      As can be seen from the formula for calculating dynamic power (P), such dynamic power consumption of CMOS circuits is proportional to the square of the supply voltage (VDD).
      <br/>
      In addition, dynamic power (P) is proportional to switching or clock frequency (F).
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      In accordance with the formula for dynamic power consumption, it has been effective in conventional CMOS integrated circuit designs to scale down the supply voltage for an entire device (e.g., hybrid) or integrated circuit (IC), i.e., operate the circuit at low supply voltages, to reduce power consumption for such designs.
      <br/>
      For example, in the MEDTRONIC SPECTRAX.RTM. device of circa 1979, IC circuitry was powered by one lithium iodine cell (as opposed to the two cells of the prior art).
      <br/>
      This reduced the supply voltage to 2.8 volts from 5.6 volts, thus reducing overhead current.
      <br/>
      Voltages required to be greater than 2.8 volts were generated by a voltage doubler, or alternatively by a charge pump (e.g., output pacing pulses).
      <br/>
      Further, for example, in the MEDTRONIC SYMBIOS.RTM. device of circa 1983, logic circuitry was powered by a voltage regulator controlling the IC supply voltage to a "sum of thresholds" supply.
      <br/>
      This regulator provided a supply to the IC (i.e., VDD) of several hundred millivolts above the sum of the n-channel and p-channel thresholds of the CMOS transistors making up the IC.
      <br/>
      This regulator was self calibrating regarding manufacturing variations of the transistor thresholds.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      Other devices have reduced power consumption in other manners.
      <br/>
      For example, various device designs have shut-down analog blocks and/or shut-off clocks to logic blocks not being used at particular times, thereby reducing power.
      <br/>
      Further, for example, microprocessor based devices have historically used a "burst clock" design to operate a microprocessor at a very high clock rate (e.g., generally 500-1000 Kilohertz (KHz)), for relatively short periods of time to gain the benefit of a "duty cycle" to reduce average current drain.
      <br/>
      A much lower frequency clock (e.g., generally 32 KHz) is used for other circuitry and/or the processor when not in the high clock rate mode, i.e., burst clock mode.
      <br/>
      Many known processor based implanted devices utilize the burst clock technique.
      <br/>
      For example, implanted devices available from Medtronic, Vitatron, Biotronic, ELA, Intermedics, Pacesetters, InControl, Cordis, CPI, etc., utilize burst clock techniques.
      <br/>
      A few illustrative examples which describe the use of a burst clock are provided in U.S. Pat. No. 4,561,442 to Vollmann et al., entitled "Implantable Cardiac Pacer With Discontinuous Microprocessor Programmable Anti Tachycardia Mechanisms and Patient Data Telemetry," issued Dec. 31, 1985; U.S. Pat. No. 5,022,395 to Russie, entitled "Implantable 25 Cardiac Device With Dual Clock Control of Microprocessor," issued Jun. 11, 1991; U.S. Pat.

    <p num="8">
      FIG. 1 represents a graphical illustration of energy/delay versus supply voltage for CMOS circuits such as a CMOS inverter 10 shown in FIG. 2 for illustrative purposes.
      <br/>
      The inverter 10 is provided with a supply voltage, VDD, which is connected to the source of a PMOS field effect transistor (FET) 12. PMOS FET 12 has its drain connected to the drain of an NMOS FET 14 whose source is connected to ground.
      <br/>
      In this configuration, an input Vi applied to both the gates of FETs 12, 14 is inverted to provide output Vo.
      <br/>
      Simply stated, one clock cycle, or logic level change, is used to invert the input Vi to Vo.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      As shown in FIG. 1, the circuit logic delay increases drastically as the supply voltage is reduced to near one volt, as represented by delay line 16 and energy/delay line 18.
      <br/>
      As such, reducing of the supply voltage (VDD) continuously to lower levels is impractical because of the need for higher supply voltages when higher frequency operation is required.
      <br/>
      For example, generally CMOS logic circuits must periodically provide functionality at a higher frequency, e.g., burst clock frequency.
      <br/>
      However, as the supply voltage (VDD) is decreased, such energy consumption is reduced by the square of the supply voltage (VDD) as is shown by energy consumption line 20.
      <br/>
      Therefore, speed requires a higher supply voltage (VDD) which is in direct conflict with low power consumption.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      Other problems are also evident when lower supply voltages (VDD) are used for CMOS circuit designs.
      <br/>
      When a lower supply voltage is selected, static leakage current losses may arise, particularly at lower frequencies, due to increased static leakage current losses.

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE EMBODIMENTS</heading>
    <p num="18">One embodiment of the present invention is first generally described in reference to FIGS. 3-15. More particularly, at least in part the use of multiple DSP systems to reduce power consumption is shown in those Figures.</p>
    <p num="19">
      FIG. 3 shows a general block diagram of a just-in-time clock system 30.
      <br/>
      Just-in-time clock system 30 includes integrated circuit 32 and clock source 34.
      <br/>
      Integrated circuit 32 includes a plurality of circuits C1-Cn.
      <br/>
      Each circuit when operable is capable of performing one or more circuit functions.
      <br/>
      A function is defined herein as any operation performed on one or more inputs in a plurality of cycles that results in an output.
      <br/>
      Generally, the functions performed by the various circuits C1-Cn are usually, although not necessarily always, performed in a predetermined number of clock cycles.
      <br/>
      Clock source 34 is operable for providing clock signals at a plurality of clock frequencies generally shown as clock1-clockn.
    </p>
    <p num="20">
      Circuits C1-Cn of integrated circuit 32 may include discrete function circuits (e.g., logic circuits for operating upon one or more inputs to implement a particular function to provide one or more outputs therefrom), such as circuits operating on one input from a sensor to provide a representative signal to further functional circuitry, transceiver circuitry, conversion circuitry, etc.
      <br/>
      Moreover, circuits C1-Cn may comprise data processing circuitry capable of performing multiple functions under program control.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, such circuits C1-Cn may implement firmware (software) functions/routines that must complete prior to some succeeding event or prior to the start of the next function.
      <br/>
      For example, as described further herein with respect to illustrative embodiments of implantable medical devices, such circuits may include digital signal processing circuits, telemetry uplink/downlink circuitry, morphology detection circuitry, arrhythmia detection circuitry, monitoring circuitry, pacing circuitry, microprocessors, and so on.
    </p>
    <p num="21">
      The functions performed by each of circuits C1-Cn are typically required to be completed in a particular time period prior to a next functional process being undertaken.
      <br/>
      For example, one logic circuit may perform a function in a predetermined time period to provide an output required by another circuit, or for example, a function may need to be performed by processing circuitry during a particular period of time due to the need for other processing to be performed by such processing circuitry.
      <br/>
      In another example pertaining especially to an implantable medical device, processing to complete a particular function may need to be performed in a portion of a particular time interval such as a blanking interval, an upper rate interval, an escape interval, or refractory interval of a cardiac cycle, or further, such as during a pulse generator/programmer handshake.
    </p>
    <p num="22">
      Clock source 34 may be configured in any manner for providing clock signals at a plurality of frequencies.
      <br/>
      Such a clock source may include any number of clock circuits wherein each provides a single clock signal at a particular frequency, clock source 34 may include one or more adjustable clock circuits for providing clock signals over a continuous range of clock frequencies, and/or clock source 34 may include a clock circuit that is operable to provide clock signals at discrete clock frequencies as opposed to over a continuous range.
      <br/>
      For example, the clock source 34 may include oscillators, clock dividers, timers, clock control circuitry or any other circuit elements required for providing clock signaling according to the present invention.
      <br/>
      Preferably, clock source 34 is configured as a continuously oscillating low frequency clock and a controllable on/off higher frequency clock.
    </p>
    <p num="23">
      Just-in-time controllable clock operation of the just-in-time clocking system 30 of FIG. 3 is described herein in reference to FIGS. 4A-4C. As shown in FIG. 4A, time period (x) represents the time period in which a circuit, e.g., one of circuits C1-Cn, is required to complete one or more functions.
      <br/>
      The same time period (x) is shown in FIG. 4B. The time period x may be equated to any number of different time periods.
      <br/>
      For example, the time period may be the amount of time a processing circuit has to perform a particular detection function due to the need for a detection output by a certain point in time, may be a time period required to complete a particular function by a certain logic circuit so as to provide a timely output to a digital signal processing circuit, may be a time period to complete a firmware (software) routine, etc.
      <br/>
      Moreover, time period x may correspond to a cardiac cycle or a part thereof.
    </p>
    <p num="24">
      As shown in FIG. 4B, and according to conventional processing, circuit functions were typically performed at a burst cycle frequency and, as such, the function performed required a time period 60.
      <br/>
      Therefore, only a small amount of time (e.g., time period 60) of the entire time period x was used to perform the one or more functions requiring n cycles of time to complete.
      <br/>
      In such a case, conventionally, such burst clocks were at a substantially high clock rate, e.g., 500-1000 KHz, for such short periods of time to gain the benefit of a "duty cycle" to reduce average current drain.
      <br/>
      However, such high clock rates may not be required for carrying out such functions, or all functions.
    </p>
    <p num="25">
      With just-in-time clocking according to the present invention, as shown in FIG. 4A, substantially the entire time period x is used to perform the one or more functions which are completed in n cycles.
      <br/>
      In other words, the clock frequency, e.g., one of clock1-clockn, for the circuit performing the one or more functions during the time period x is set such that the one or more functions are completed in the maximum time available for performing such functions, i.e., the clock frequency is at its lowest possible value.
      <br/>
      Stated another way, a lower frequency clock is employed such that the one or more functions are performed just-in-time for other circuit or routine functionality to be performed.
    </p>
    <p num="26">
      In such a just-in-time manner, the clock frequency used to control the performance of such functions by the particular CMOS, CML, SOS, SOI, BICMOS, PMOS and/or NMOS circuitry is lowered resulting in reduced power consumption by such circuitry.
      <br/>
      According to calculations of dynamic power, the lower frequency results in proportional power reduction.
      <br/>
      With the lowering of the clock frequency, the integrated circuit 32 including the various circuits C1-Cn can be designed to operate at a lower frequency, e.g., as opposed to burst frequency, and also at various other frequencies depending upon need.
    </p>
    <p num="27">It is preferred that use of substantially the entire predetermined period of time result in completion of the one or more functions being performed prior to the end of the time period x as is represented by remainder time periods 55 in FIG. 4A. This remainder time period 55, for example, is preferably near or about 0 seconds.</p>
    <p num="28">
      FIG. 4C shows an illustrative timing example for processing circuitry which performs multiple functions.
      <br/>
      For example, the cardiac cycle of a patient is represented in FIG. 4C as time period x. During time period 71, i.e., during a QRS complex of the cardiac cycle, high speed processing is performed at a high clock frequency relative to a lower clock frequency used to control operation of the processing circuitry during time period y. During the time period y, when the processing circuitry is operated at a lower clock frequency, such lower clock frequency may be set such that the functions performed during z cycles are performed in substantially the entire maximum time period available for such processing, i.e., time period y. Once again, a small remainder time period 75 of the cardiac cycle time period x may exist.
      <br/>
      Such time period may be, for example, in the range of about 1.0 millisecond to about 10.0 milliseconds when the cardiac cycle is in the range of about 400 milliseconds to about 1200 milliseconds.
    </p>
    <p num="29">
      FIG. 5 shows a general block diagram of a multiple supply voltage system 100 wherein one or more supply voltages are available and tailored for application to various circuits in an IC.
      <br/>
      The multiple supply voltage system 100 includes integrated circuit 102 and supply voltage source 106.
      <br/>
      Integrated circuit 102 includes circuits C1-Cn.
      <br/>
      Supply voltage source 106 is operable for providing a plurality of supply voltages VI-Vn.
      <br/>
      Each supply voltage from supply voltage source 106 is tailored to be applied to one or more circuits of circuits C1-Cn.
      <br/>
      As illustrated, supply voltage VI is applied to circuit C1, supply voltage V2 is applied to circuit C2 and C3, and so forth.
    </p>
    <p num="30">
      The tailoring of the supply voltages V1-Vn to the particular circuits C1-Cn is dependent upon the frequency at which the circuits C1-Cn are required to be operated.
      <br/>
      For example, and as previously described, the logic delay of such CMOS, CML, SOS, SOI, BICMOS, PMOS and/or NMOS circuitry circuits C1-Cn increases drastically as the supply voltage is reduced to near 1 volt.
      <br/>
      If such logic delay is tolerable, the supply voltage provided to a particular circuit will drastically reduce the power consumption for that particular circuit as the energy is reduced in proportion to the square of the supply voltage (VDD).
      <br/>
      However, if such logic delay is not tolerable, for example, if the logic circuit performs a function that must be completed within a particular period of time, the reduction of the supply voltage (VDD) applied to such a circuit will be limited depending upon the acceptable logic delay.
      <br/>
      However, the supply voltage VDD for any particular circuit can be reduced as low as possible yet meet adequate speed requirements.
    </p>
    <p num="31">
      Integrated circuit 102 may include various different circuits C1-Cn like those described with reference to FIG. 3.
      <br/>
      The supply voltage source 106 may be implemented using a variety of components and may include any number of voltage sources wherein each provides a single supply voltage level, may include one or more adjustable voltage sources for providing supply voltage levels over a continuous range of levels, and/or may include a voltage source that is operable to provide discrete supply voltage levels as opposed to levels over a continuous range.
      <br/>
      The supply voltage source may include a voltage divider, a voltage regulator, a charge pump, or any other elements for providing the supply voltages V1-Vn.
      <br/>
      Preferably, the supply voltage source 106 is configured as a charge pump.
    </p>
    <p num="32">
      In the typical case, supply voltage (VDD) is generally in the range of about 3 volts to about 6 volts.
      <br/>
      Preferably, and in accordance with the present invention, the supply voltages V1-Vn are in the range of about 1 volt to about 3 volts dependent upon the particular CMOS, CML, SOS, SOI, BICMOS, PMOS and/or NMOS technology used.
    </p>
    <p num="33">
      With reduction in supply voltage (VDD), the threshold voltage (VT) for the circuits is also reduced.
      <br/>
      For example, with supply voltages in the range of about 3 to about 6 volts, the threshold voltage for CMOS, CML, SOS, SOI, BICMOS, PMOS and/or NMOS devices is generally in the range of about 0.8 volts to about 1.0 volt.
      <br/>
      Preferably, in implantable medical devices, lithium chemistries are utilized for implantable batteries.
      <br/>
      Such lithium chemistries are generally in the range of about 2.8 volts to about 3.3 volts and generally the CMOS, CML, SOS, SOI, BICMOS, PMOS and/or NMOS circuitry has an associated threshold voltage of about 0.75.
    </p>
    <p num="34">
      By reducing the supply voltages below about 2.8 volts, voltage thresholds for CMOS, CML, SOS, SOI, BICMOS, PMOS and/or NMOS devices may be decreased to as low as about 0.2 volts to about 0.3 volts.
      <br/>
      Currently, there are various ultra low power logic designs operating at a supply voltage as low as about 1.1 volts, as for example logic circuitry for microprocessors for laptop and other portable computer applications.
      <br/>
      By utilizing the tailored supply voltages V1-Vn, low power or ultra low power logic designs may be employed for at least some of the various circuits C1-Cn of integrated circuit 102.
      <br/>
      Other circuits may require higher supply voltages.
      <br/>
      With the use of lower threshold levels due to lower supply voltages, static power consumption losses undesirably increase by several orders of magnitude.
    </p>
    <p num="35">
      Multiple supply voltage system 100 may therefore further optionally include back gate bias source 130 for providing back gate bias voltages BV1-BVn to circuits C1-Cn of integrated circuit 102.
      <br/>
      Generally, back gate bias voltages BV1-BVn are dependent upon the supply voltage V1-Vn applied to the circuits C1-Cn to adjust the threshold voltages for devices of circuits C1-Cn.
      <br/>
      For example, the threshold voltage (VT) for the CMOS, CML, SOS, SOI, BICMOS, PMOS and/or NMOS devices of the circuit may be at a lower value by providing a back gate bias voltage to the particular circuits supplied with the lower supply voltage.
      <br/>
      Moreover, if circuit C1 is supplied with a lower supply voltage V1, then a back gate bias voltage BV1 may optionally be applied to circuit C1 to adjust the threshold voltage (VT) for the CMOS, CML, SOS, SOI, BICMOS, PMOS and/or NMOS devices to a higher threshold voltage (VT) value.
      <br/>
      In such a manner, static leakage current losses can be minimized because the equivalent higher threshold voltage has been restored.
      <br/>
      Moreover, a broader range of supply voltages is possible because the back gate adjustment allows a tailoring of the threshold allowing high/low speed operation and eliminating the static current drain leakage.
    </p>
    <p num="36">
      The back gate bias voltage may be provided by, for example, a fixed voltage source (e.g., a charge pump) connected to the back gate well via a contact.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, an active body bias scheme whereby the voltage source is selectable or adjustable over an appropriate range may be used.
    </p>
    <p num="37">
      Back gate voltages may be applied in manners well know in the art.
      <br/>
      The application of back gate bias voltages is described, for example, in various patent references, including U.S. Pat. No. 4,791,318 to Lewis et al., U.S. Pat. No. 4,460,835 to Masuoka, U.S. Pat. No. 5,610,083 to Chan et al. and U.S. Pat. No. 5,186,535 to Farb et al., all incorporated by reference herein in their respective entireties.

      FIG. 6 shows a general block diagram of a variable supply voltage/variable clock system 150 according to the present invention.
      <br/>
      System 150 includes integrated circuit 152, clock source 156, supply voltage source lo 154, and clock/supply voltage interface 155.
      <br/>
      Supply voltage source 154 is operable for providing a plurality of supply voltages V1-Vn to a plurality of circuits C1-Cn of integrated circuit 152.
      <br/>
      Clock source 156 of system 150 is operable for providing clock signals at a plurality of frequencies, clock1-clockn.
      <br/>
      Circuits C1-Cn are of a similar nature to those described with reference to FIG. 3.
      <br/>
      Clock source 156 is similar to the clock source 34 as described with reference to FIG. 3.
      <br/>
      Supply voltage source 154 is similar to supply voltage source 106 described in reference to FIG. 5.
      <br/>
      In variable supply voltage/variable clock system 150, however, clock/voltage interface 155 is employed to adjust supply voltages V1-Vn applied to the circuits C1-Cn "on the fly," as required by specific timing functions required by or inherent to circuits C1-Cn.
    </p>
    <p num="39">
      As an illustrative example, circuit C1 may be a particular logic circuit for performing one or more particular functions.
      <br/>
      Such functions may be required to be performed, however, in a first time period at a first clock frequency and during a different second time period at a second clock frequency so that such function may be performed within the allowed time of the respective first and second time periods.
      <br/>
      That is, one time period is shorter than the other and, as such, the functions which require performance over a certain number of cycles must be performed at a higher clock frequency if it is to be completed within a time period that is shorter than another time period.
    </p>
    <p num="40">
      In such an example, and according to the present invention, clock/voltage interface 155 detects the clock signal applied to circuit C1 during the first time period in which the higher frequency clock signal is used and accordingly provides supply voltage source 154 with a signal to select and apply a certain supply voltage corresponding to the higher clock frequency.
      <br/>
      Thereafter, when the lower clock frequency is applied to circuit C1 during the second time period, clock/voltage interface 155 senses the use of the lower clock frequency and applies a signal to voltage supply source 154 for application of a certain supply voltage corresponding to the lower clock frequency for application to circuit C1.
    </p>
    <p num="41">In another example, circuit C2 may be a CMOS, CML, SOS, SOI, BICMOS, PMOS and/or NMOS processor which may also have clock frequency and corresponding supply voltage adjustments made "on the fly." Such a system will become readily apparent to those skilled in the art from the following discussion referring to FIG. 7.</p>
    <p num="42">
      FIG. 7 shows a general block diagram of clock controlled processing system 200 according to the present invention.
      <br/>
      Clock controlled processing system 200 includes processor 202 (e.g., a CMOS, CML, SOS, SOI, BICMOS, PMOS and/or NMOS microprocessor or CMOS, CML, SOS, SOI, BICMOS, PMOS and/or NMOS digital signal processor), clock source 204, supply voltage source 206, voltage regulator 212, regulator interface 210, clock control 208, and optional back gate bias source 214.
      <br/>
      In a manner similar to that described in reference to FIG. 6, the supply voltage 206 applied to processor 202 is changed "on the fly," as required by specific circuit timing requirements.
    </p>
    <p num="43">
      Generally, processor 202 is operated under control of clock source 204.
      <br/>
      Depending upon the processing capability required, clock source 204 may operate processor 202 at any one of a plurality of clock frequencies.
      <br/>
      Such clock frequencies may be selected under the control of clock control 208.
      <br/>
      Clock control 208 may be part of any timing and control hardware and/or timing and control software used to control operation of processor 202 as part of a larger system.
      <br/>
      Such clock control may take the form, for example, of a digital controller/timer circuit for performing timing control of an implantable medical device.
    </p>
    <p num="44">
      Processor 202 may perform any number of functions as appropriate for the device in which it is used.
      <br/>
      High frequency processing capabilities (i.e., about 250 KHz to about 10 MHz), low frequency processing capabilities (i.e., about 1 Hz to about 32 KHz), and processing capabilities with regard to frequencies between such limits are contemplated according to the present invention.
      <br/>
      For simplicity purposes, clock control processing system 200 operation shall be described with reference to processor 202 performing only two different functions, each during a predetermined respective period of time.
      <br/>
      For example, with respect to an implantable medical device such as a pacemaker, during the first period of time, a high processing function requiring a relatively high clock frequency may include a function such as telemetry uplink/downlink, morphology detection, initialization, arrhythmia detection, far-field R-wave detection, EMI detection, retrograde conduction, etc.
      <br/>
      On the other hand, low frequency processing functions may include a function such as sensing intrinsic beats, pacing, low speed telemetry, transtelephonic data transfer, remote monitoring, battery checks, etc.

      When processor 202 performs high frequency processing functions during a predetermined time period, a relatively high clock frequency (e.g., about 250 KHz to about 10 MHz) may be supplied by clock source 204 for operation of processor 202.
      <br/>
      Regulator interface 210 will detect the higher clock frequency applied to processor 202 for operation during the high processing function and apply a control signal to voltage regulator 212 for regulation of the supply voltage source 206.
      <br/>
      Supply voltage source 206 is operable under control of voltage regulator 212 to provide a supply voltage within a predetermined range, preferably between about 1.1 volts and about 3 volts.
      <br/>
      When a high clock frequency is employed to operate processor 202 for high frequency processing functions, supply voltage source 206 generally applies a supply voltage in the upper range of the preferred supply voltages to the CMOS, CML, SOS, SOI, BICMOS, PMOS and/or NMOS devices of processor 202.
    </p>
    <p num="46">
      On the other hand, when processor 202 executes low frequency processing functions during predetermined periods of time, clock control 208 signals clock source 204 to apply a lower frequency for operation of processor 202.
      <br/>
      As such, regulator interface 210 detects the lower frequency being used to operate processor 202 and issues a control signal to voltage regulator 212 for regulation of supply voltage source 206 such that a lower supply voltage in the lower end of the preferred range of supply voltages is applied to the CMOS, CML, SOS, SOI, BICMOS, PMOS and/or NMOS devices of processor 202.

    <p num="47">
      It will be recognized by those skilled in the art that any intermediate processing capability may be achieved between the higher frequency and the lower frequency capabilities described hereinabove, and that the scope of the present invention is not limited to processing at only two clock frequencies and at two corresponding supply voltages.
      <br/>
      Instead, multiple levels of processing capability may be achieved according to the present invention with associated clock frequencies and corresponding supply voltages being applied to processor 202.

      As shown in FIG. 4C, during the overall cardiac cycle of predetermined time period x, a high frequency is employed to control operation of processor 202 during time period 71 of the cardiac cycle time period x (e.g., during processing of the QRS complex).
      <br/>
      Thereafter, a lower clock frequency is used during time period y for controlling operation of processor 202 to perform any of a number of other different functions, such as cardiac event/EMI differentiation functions.
      <br/>
      During operation of the processor 202 at the higher clock frequency during time period 71, a higher supply voltage from supply voltage source 206 is applied to the CMOS, CML, SOS, SOI, BICMOS, PMOS and/or NMOS circuitry devices of processor 202.
      <br/>
      Likewise, during operation of the processor 202 at the relatively lower clock frequency, a lower supply voltage from supply voltage source 206 is applied to the CMOS, CML, SOS, SOI, BICMOS, PMOS and/or NMOS devices of processor 202 during time period y of the overall cardiac cycle time period x.
    </p>
    <p num="49">
      Moreover, and as shown in FIG. 7, an optional back gate bias 214 may be used to dynamically adjust the threshold voltage (VT) of CMOS, CML, SOS, SOI, BICMOS, PMOS and/or NMOS circuitry devices of processor 202 as a function of the clock frequency applied to processor 202 by clock source 204.
      <br/>
      The regulator interface 210 detects the clock frequency used to control operation of processor 202 and controls the voltage level of back gate bias 214 to be applied to the CMOS, CML, SOS, SOI, BICMOS, PMOS and/or NMOS devices of processor 202.
      <br/>
      The dynamic adjustment of the threshold voltage may be implemented as an adjustable or selectable voltage source utilizing, for example, a charge pump and a regulator.
      <br/>
      The back gate voltage and the "normal" gate voltage provide a gate bias or voltage to the transistor.
      <br/>
      By adjusting the back gate voltage, the "apparent" voltage is increased with a resultant reduction in leakage current.

      <br/>
      To reduce power, the waveform analysis (DSP) processor 520 is clocked at different speeds, i.e., controlled "on the fly," according to the present invention, depending upon the processing needs.

      Such a processing cycle has been previously described with reference to FIG. 4C. In addition to the lower clock speed utilized for different portions of the cardiac cycle, one skilled in the art will recognize that in accordance with the other aspects of the present invention, as the speed is reduced, the supply voltage level (VDD) may also be reduced accordingly.

      DSP system 500 of FIG. 11 is generally shown in FIG. 12. Generally, DSP systems, such as DSP system 500, may include an input filter, an ADC, a sample and hold circuit (sometimes built into the ADC), and a digital signal processor to provide an output.

      The input filter, ADC, and sample and hold circuit provide data representative of an analog input to the processor.

      The digital signal processor can then be used to implement one of various algorithms, such as, for example, digital filtering, mapping the input, performing morphology detection, functioning as sense amplifiers (P-wave, R-wave, or T-wave), etc., to provide a desired output.

      One skilled in the art will recognize that depending upon the application of the present invention, the components of DSP system 500 may vary.

      As shown in FIG. 12, two or more analog input signals 499 are multiplexed by multiplexer 510 and converted to digital data representative thereof for processing by the digital signal processor of DSP system 500.
      <br/>
      The data representative of the input signals is then operated upon by the digital signal processor of DSP system 500 to perform functions with regard thereto during a predetermined period of time. R-wave detection algorithms and P-wave detection algorithms may be performed, for example, by the same digital signal processor during the predetermined time period using data representative of ventricular and atrial analog input signals, respectively, provided to the multiplexer 510.

    <p num="90">
      Such multiplexing of the input signals and use of a single digital signal processor as shown in FIGS. 11 and 12 to perform multiple functions in a predetermined period of time requires the digital signal processor of the DSP system 500 to be operated at a relatively high clock frequency.
      <br/>
      The clock frequency is relatively high compared to the clock frequencies that would be required if multiple digital signal processors were used to perform the functions in the same time period.
      <br/>
      With operation at a relatively high frequency to accomplish the multiple functions during this predetermined period of time, a relatively high supply voltage must also be applied to the processor for operation.

    <p num="91">
      The supply voltage is relatively high compared to the supply voltage that would be required if multiple digital signal processors were used to perform the functions in the same time period.

      As such, the dynamic power (P) consumed by the single digital signal processor ((P)=1/2CVDD2 F, where C is nodal capacitance, F is the clock or switching frequency, and VDD is the supply voltage for the processor) is rather high.
      <br/>
      The formula for calculating dynamic power (P) indicates that dynamic power consumption of CMOS, CML, SOS, SOI, BICMOS, PMOS and/or NMOS circuits is proportional to the square of the supply voltage (VDD).

      FIG. 13 shows a generalized schematic illustration of such a multiple processor system 600 including multiple DSP systems 602-604 for reducing power consumption according to the present invention.
      <br/>
      DSP system 602 is provided with a first analog input signal 612 and includes conversion circuitry for converting the analog input signal 612 to digital data representative thereof.
      <br/>
      Digital signal processor 622 of the DSP system 602 then operates on the data to perform a function and provide an output 632 (which may be converted back to an analog signal if desired).
      <br/>
      The digital signal processor 622 is operated at a first clock frequency Clk1 and a first supply voltage SV1 is applied to the digital signal processor 622.
    </p>
    <p num="93">
      DSP system 603 is provided with a second analog input signal 613 and includes conversion circuitry for converting the analog input signal 613 to digital data representative thereof.
      <br/>
      Digital signal processor 623 of the DSP system 603 then operates on the data to perform a function and provide an output 633 (which may be converted back to an analog signal if desired).
      <br/>
      The digital signal processor 623 is operated at a second clock frequency Clk2 and a second supply voltage SV2 is applied to the digital signal processor 623.
    </p>
    <p num="94">
      Generally, the first and second clock frequencies Clk1 and Clk2 at which the first and second digital signal processors operate to perform their respective functions in a predetermined time period, are lower relative to the clock frequency necessary for a single processor to perform the same functions in the same predetermined time period.
      <br/>
      The first and second clock frequencies Clk1 and Clk2 are such that the power consumed by the first and second digital signal processors in performance of the respective functions during the predetermined period of time is less than the power that would be consumed if only one of the first and second digital signal processors were to perform both the respective functions within the predetermined time period.
    </p>
    <p num="95">
      Likewise, supply voltages SV1 and SV2 may also be reduced because the digital signal processors 622 and 623 are running at a lower speed and a decrease in clock frequency allows use of lower supply voltages as previously described herein.
      <br/>
      If the clock frequency Clk1 is reduced, for example, SV1 applied to the digital signal processor 622 may also be reduced.
    </p>
    <p num="96">
      By way of example, consider the case in which system 600 includes only DSP system 602 and DSP system 603.
      <br/>
      Each of DSP systems 602 and 603 receives a single analog input 612 and 613, respectively.
      <br/>
      Digital signal processor 622 operates on the data representative of analog input 612 at clock frequency Clk1 to perform a first function.
      <br/>
      Digital signal processor 623 operates on the data representative of the analog input 613 at clock frequency Clk2 to perform a second function.
      <br/>
      In comparison to the power consumed by a system such as that shown in FIG. 12 (where a single processor is used to perform both the functions within the predetermined period of time using multiplexed inputs), multiple digital signal processors may perform the same functions, but while consuming substantially less power.
    </p>
    <p num="97">
      More particularly, by using two digital signal processors in accordance with the present invention, the dynamic power so consumed (P2) may be computed by the formula:
      <br/>
      (P2)=1/2(2C)((VDD /2)2 (F/2)
    </p>
    <p num="98">where C is two times the nodal capacitance because there are two digital signal processors, F/2 is the reduced clock or switching frequency because both the digital signal processors can operate at 1/2 the speed as compared to a single processor attempting to complete both functions in the predetermined period of time, and VDD /2 is the supply voltage because the digital signal processors are running at 1/2 speed as compared to the single processor attempting to complete both functions in the predetermined time period.</p>
    <p num="99">
      Power consumed by the two digital signal processors illustration is given by the formula:
      <br/>
      P2=1/2C(VDD2 /4)F
    </p>
    <p num="100">
      which is 1/4 the power consumed by the single processor using multiplexed inputs as described above in respect of FIG. 12. One skilled in the art will now recognize that the foregoing two digital signal processor embodiment of the present invention occupies more integrated circuit die area than a single processor having multiplexed inputs.
      <br/>
      Power consumption is greatly reduced, however.
    </p>
    <p num="101">
      In the illustrative embodiment described above, the clock frequencies at which the first and second digital signal processors operate are substantially equal.
      <br/>
      Those clock frequencies need not be the same or substantially the same, however, to reduce power consumption, and indeed may be different.
      <br/>
      The first and second clock frequencies Clk1 and Clk2 at which the first and second digital signal processors operate to perform the respective functions are most preferably frequencies selected such that the power consumed by the first and second digital signal processors in performance of the respective functions during the predetermined period of time is less than the power that would be consumed if only one of the first and second digital signal processors were to perform both of the functions within the predetermined time period.
    </p>
    <p num="102">
      Moreover, and as shown in FIG. 13, more than two DSP systems, such as additional DSP system 604, may be employed to reduce power consumption.
      <br/>
      Additionally, each of the digital signal processors, including DSP systems 602-604, may be provided with one or more analog inputs as represented generally by inputs 618 which may be multiplexed as described with respect to FIG. 11, or alternatively may be provided with a single input as shown above with respect to DSP systems 602 and 603.

      Use of multiple DSP systems is particularly beneficial when processing higher frequency analog signals, although such systems may be employed with any analog signal.
      <br/>
      Such multiple DSP configurations find particularly advantageous application, for example, when employed for P-wave, R-wave, and T-wave sensing, EMI detection, sensor signal processing of such signals as pressure, oxygen saturation, blood flow and cardiac contractility signals, telemetry functions, and the like.
      <br/>
      Such functions may be characterized generally by the bandwidth of the analog signals being processed to perform such functions.
      <br/>
      In general, the bandwidth of analog signals such as cardiac sense signals is in the range of between about 10 Hz and about 100 Hz (as opposed to some sensor signals, such as pressure signals, having a bandwidth of between about 1 Hz and about 10 Hz).

      <br/>

      Analog circuitry 704 may include the analog circuits of pacemaker 300 described previously in reference to FIG. 9.

      Such analog circuits may include, for example, atrial and ventricular sense amplifiers for receiving A-sense signals from the atrium of heart 764 and for receiving V-sense signals from the ventricle of heart 764.
      <br/>
      Such sense amplifier circuits are coupled to leads extending to heart 764 via capacitors C1 and C2 to receive the V-Sense (ventricular sense) and A-Sense (atrial sense) signals from heart 764.

      Sense amplifier circuits then communicate an A-event signal to controller 714 when an atrial event (i.e., an intrinsic atrial event or P-wave) is detected, and communicate a V-event signal to controller 714 when a ventricular event (an intrinsic R-wave) is detected.

      FIG. 18 shows an alternative embodiment for at least some of the analog circuitry 704 described in reference to FIG. 17. The functions of some of the analog circuits, for example sense amplifiers, may be implemented using circuitry 780 which includes analog circuits 782 (e.g., preamplifiers, ADC's, etc.) and further includes one or more digital signal processors (DSP's) 784 to perform analysis with respect to data communicated thereto by way of analog circuits 782.

      Charge pump circuit 706 may be implemented, for example, using the techniques described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,387,228 to Shelton.

      Charge pump circuit 706 may, for example, be regulated, such as with use of a charge comparator circuit to regulate the voltage, or charge pump circuit 706 may be unregulated.

      The unregulated voltage may vary as the voltage source V1 varies due to low battery conditions, for example.
      <br/>
      Yet further, one or more supply voltages may be output from charge pump circuit 706 as voltage V1 is pumped to different amplitudes.
      <br/>
      More than one supply voltage may be provided by charge pump circuit 706 or more than one charge pump circuit 706 may be employed to provide multiple supply voltages, where each charge pumped voltage is greater than supply voltage V1.
      <br/>
      That is, one charge pumped voltage may exceed another charged pumped voltage.

      Level shifter 708 may be used to translate logic and/or control signals between analog circuitry 704 and controller and processor 714.

      Such level shifting may be required due to the difference in supply voltages being applied to digital circuitry 702 and analog circuitry 704, respectively.

      Thus, Data or Signal Monitor 600 may monitor or sense signals or data before or after they have been subjected to preliminary or other signal conditioning, filtering, amplification or logic processing, but in any case before they are input to a central or principal data processing device such as Controller 332 or Microcomputer 314.

      Clocks 338 and 322 and voltage sources 612 and 301 are adjusted under the control of Data Monitor 600 to either minimize current drain while clock speed is decreased, or to allow optimum circuit function while clock speed is increased, all in a manner largely similar to that described hereinabove in respect of FIGS. 9, 10 and 11.

      Referring now to FIG. 20, there is shown an exemplary algorithm 700 for controlling the functionality of Data Monitor 600 shown in FIG. 19. At block 702 a measurement is made of activity or signal transitions or changes occurring per unit time.
      <br/>
      The time period over which such measurements are made may be in milliseconds, seconds, minutes, hours or even days depending on the expected range of frequency of data arrival or generation.

      Block 704 periodically senses whether the activity measured in block 702 exceeds a predetermined level or threshold.

      If at block 704 the sensed result is "no", the minimum threshold is compared to the sensed signal at block 710.

      In yet another embodiment of the present invention, pipelining architecture is employed to reduce power consumption.
      <br/>
      Turning now to FIGS. 22 and 23, there are shown two principal types of microprocessor architectures:
      <br/>
      the von Neumann architecture (shown in FIG. 22), and the Harvard architecture (shown in FIG. 23).
    </p>
    <p num="147">
      The von Neumann architecture of FIG. 22 generally has a single unified memory which stores both instructions and data.
      <br/>
      In the von Neumann architecture, a high throughput is required of the data bus.
      <br/>
      That is, all instructions, operand addresses and data must successively occupy the single bus.
      <br/>
      In contrast, the Harvard architecture shown in FIG. 23 has two or more busses which permit instruction, address and data fetching to be done in parallel.
      <br/>
      The Harvard architecture typically has substantially greater processing throughput capability than does the von Neumann architecture.
      <br/>
      Consequently, the Harvard architecture is often employed in DSP's, where processing throughput demands are particularly high.
    </p>
    <p num="148">
      Two methods used to increase the effective processing speed or throughput of a microprocessor or DSP are: (1) to reduce the number of average clock cycles required to execute an instruction; and/or (2) to increase the clock speed (i.e., decrease the clock cycle length).
      <br/>
      One known method of reducing the average number of cycles required to execute an instruction without increasing the length of the clock cycle is to overlap the execution of multiple instructions.
      <br/>
      Such overlapping of instructions is known in the art as "pipelining".
    </p>
    <p num="149">
      Instruction pipelines function by dividing the execution of each instruction into several discrete portions, and then executing one portion of several different instructions simultaneously.
      <br/>
      As shown in FIG. 24, the execution of a single instruction can be subdivided into three discrete portions.
      <br/>
      FIG. 24 shows that each instruction is divided into three discrete portions or stages respectively labelled "Stage 1: fetch"; "Stage 2: Execute 1"; and "Stage 3: Execute 2." Three successive clock cycles are thus required to execute each complete instruction shown in FIG. 24. By creating such an instruction pipeline, a certain amount of operational or computational parallelism is achieved.
      <br/>
      Parallelism here signifies that three instructions are being executed simultaneously for any given clock cycle.
    </p>
    <p num="150">
      Continuing to refer to FIG. 24, it can be seen that during the clock cycle labelled "one phase", the third instruction (i.e., R.vertline.1 --&gt; ROM(PC)) is initiated, the second instruction (i.e., AC1 --&gt; F( . . . ) PC --&gt; ( . . . )V( . . . )) is executed, and storing of the first instruction (RAM --&gt; AC2) is underway.
      <br/>
      Although each instruction still requires three clock cycles to execute, a three-level instruction pipeline like that illustrated in FIG. 24 results in a new instruction being initiated during each clock cycle.
    </p>
    <p num="151">
      When an instruction is being executed in each stage of the pipeline, the pipeline is said to be full.
      <br/>
      Once the pipeline is full, the effective rate of instruction completion is one instruction per clock cycle.
      <br/>
      By breaking down each instruction into three smaller and simpler discrete portions or parts, the individual parts may be executed faster, which in turn permits the individual clock cycles to be shortened.
      <br/>
      As the execution rate for new instructions depends upon the clock cycle, a shorter clock cycle leads to a higher instruction execution rate.
      <br/>
      Of course, maintaining this rate requires that the pipeline be kept full and that nothing delay the advance of instructions through the pipeline.
    </p>
    <p num="152">
      FIG. 25 shows one embodiment of a microprocessor pipeline architecture finding application in the present invention having three stages and three phases for executing instructions.
      <br/>
      Each stage is designed to perform a specific phase of fetching or executing an instruction.
      <br/>
      Stage 1 is used to fetch an instruction from program memory and to load i in an instruction register.
      <br/>
      Stage 2 is used to execute an arithmetic logic unit (ALU) operation and to update a program counter.
      <br/>
      Stage 3 is used to load the result into data memory.

      The prior art describing pipelining processors and pipeline architecture relates to increasing processing speed and computing power.

    </p>
    <p num="154">
      Rather than seeking to increase the speed at which instructions at executed or to increase the number of calculations that can be made in a given unit of time, in the present invention, and completely contrary to the teachings of the prior art, a reduction in clock speed and pipelining architecture are employed in combination to reduce power consumption in medical and other devices.
      <br/>
      That is, instead of utilizing the two-, three-, four- or other-fold increase in speed or computing power gained by utilizing pipelining taught in the prior art, the present invention reduces clock speed the factor permitted by the particular pipeline architecture in question (e.g., clock speed is reduced by a factor of two, three, four or other factor), while processing capabilities roughly similar to those that would obtain if the pipeline architecture were not present or utilized are maintained.
      <br/>
      The reduction of clock speed in the present invention permits a reduction in the voltage of the voltage supply (VDD) provided.
      <br/>
      As a result, the capacity or current drain required of a battery powering an implantable medical device is reduced by the square of the resulting voltage difference in accordance with the teachings set forth hereinabove.

      Application of different voltages to the analog and digital circuitry of the PCD described hereinabove in respect of FIG. 10, for example, may be employed to reduce power consumption.
