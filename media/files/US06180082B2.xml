      Administration of a radioisotopic compound by infusion over a period of time greater than two hours, preferably greater than twelve hours, greatly increases the maximum radioactivity that accumulates in the target cell.
      <br/>
      The efficacy of the administration of the radiolabeled compound can be increased about five times higher than prior bolus injection or short infusion methods.
      <br/>
      This method enhances the tumor to background ratio by increasing the actual radioligand accumulated inside the target cells.
      <br/>
      This technique works for any radiolabeled compound whose cellular uptake is limited by a cellular process of either binding to a cellular receptor or to a transport protein.
      <br/>
      Once the radiolabeled compound is bound and internalized, the ability of an unlabeled compound to compete with the radioligand is markedly decreased.
      <br/>
      The primary factor governing residence time after internalization is the physical half-life of the radioisotope, not biologic half-life.

    <p num="4">
      Radiolabelled compounds are used for both tumor detection and tumor therapy.
      <br/>
      Many tumor cells have a higher density of cell receptors for various circulating compounds than do non-tumor cells; e.g., endocrine tumors show a high density of cell surface receptors for somatostatin, and brain gliomas show a high density of receptors for epidermal growth factor.
      <br/>
      Thus a radiolabeled compound that binds to these cellular receptors preferentially binds to the tumor cells.
      <br/>
      Additionally, angiogenesis, the formation of new blood vessels from established microvasculature, is a critical process for tumor growth.
      <br/>
      Primary tumors and metastases will not grow beyond 2 mm in diameter without an enhanced vascular supply.
      <br/>
      Angiogenic cells also have a higher density of cell receptors for various circulating compounds than do non-angiogenic vascular tissue; e.g., receptors for both somatostatin and vascular endothelial growth factor are higher in angiogenic tissue.
      <br/>
      Thus a tumor can also be detected by radiolabeled compounds binding to the angiogenic cells that are closely associated with the tumor cells.

      An ideal tumor imaging agent would maximize the radioactivity at the target cells, and minimize the background signal, resulting in a well-defined image of the tumor foci.
      <br/>
      For example, 111 In-DTPA-D-Phe-1-octreotide and 123 I-vasoactive intestinal peptide, two receptor-based radioligands, have been used to localize primary endocrine tumors as well as metastatic liver lesions.

      An ideal radioligand therapy agent would accumulate selectively in target cells.

      The effectiveness of radiotherapy is due to the destruction of dividing cells resulting from radiation-induced damage to cellular DNA.

      <br/>
      In both therapeutic and imaging applications, any unbound, circulating radioligand is rapidly cleared by excretory systems, which helps protect normal organs and tissues.
      <br/>
      The radioligand may also be degraded by body processes which will increase the clearance of the free radioisotope.

      In both tumor imaging and therapy, a clinical goal is to maximize the amount of radiolabeled compound taken up by the tumor.
      <br/>
      The amount of radioligand that accumulates in target cells depends on many factors, for example: (1) the concentration gradient of the radioligand between the blood and the targeted tissue; (2) the number of cellular receptors, membrane or intracellular, and the affinity of those receptors for the radioligand; (3) the relative concentrations of labeled and unlabeled ligand competing for a given receptor; (4) the recycling rate for the cellular receptors; (5) the capacity of the cell to store the radioligand; and (6) the degradation of the radioligand inside the cell.

      Radiolabeled compounds have typically been administered by intravenous, bolus injection.

      In a few instances, radiolabeled compounds have been given as infusions over 30 to 60 min, usually to limit side effects of the drug, not to increase efficacy.

      The ability of a cell to take up a radiolabeled compound in the short term is limited by the number of cellular receptors or transport proteins for the compound on the cell membrane or within the cell.
      <br/>
      When the radioligand is administered by bolus injection, the binding pharmocokinetics dictate that uptake of the radioligand is linearly related to the amount injected only at low concentrations of the radioligand.
      <br/>
      At higher concentrations, the receptors for the radioligand become saturated.
      <br/>
      See H. Zhu et al., "Potential and Limitations of Radioimmunodetection and Radioimmunotherapy with Monoclonal Antibodies," The Journal of Nuclear Medicine, vol. 38, no. 5, pp. 731-41 (1997); and R. M. Kessler et al., "High Affinity Dopamine D2 Receptor Radioligands. 1.
      <br/>
      Regional Rat Brain Distribution of Iodinated Benzamides," The Journal of Nuclear Medicine, vol. 32, pp. 1593-1600 (1991).
      <br/>
      These saturated receptors are not able to bind more radioligand until either the receptor releases the radioligand, or the receptor-radioligand complex has been transported to another part of the cell and the receptor has been recycled to again bind a new molecule of the radioligand.
      <br/>
      Because the circulating unbound radioligand is rapidly eliminated, by the time the receptors are free to accept another molecule of the radioligand, the radioligand may no longer be present.
      <br/>
      Thus, the accumulation of radioligand depends on the availability of unbound radioligand, and on the recycling time of the cellular receptors and transport proteins.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      The recycling of the cellular receptors depends on the fate of the ligand-receptor complex.
      <br/>
      Many, if not most, peptide compounds (including peptide and protein hormones) that bind to surface receptors are internalized as a ligand-receptor complex by endocytosis, i.e., invagination of the plasma membrane.
      <br/>
      Examples of peptides that have been shown to be internalized as part of a ligand-receptor complex include nerve growth factor, fibroblast growth factor, epidermal growth factor, platelet-derived growth factor, cholecystokinin, vascular endothelial growth factor, vasoactive intestinal peptide, gastrin-releasing peptide, leukemia inhibitory factor, somatostatin, oxytocin, bombesin, calcitonin, arginine vasopressin, angiotensin II, atrial natriuretic peptide, insulin, glucagon, prolactin, growth hormone, gonadotropin, thyrotropin-releasing hormone, growth hormone-releasing hormone, gonadotropin-releasing hormone, corticotropin-releasing hormone, interleukins, interferons, transferrin, substance P, neuromedin, neurotensin, neuropeptide Y, and various opioids.
      <br/>
      This internalization takes time--minutes or even hours.

      After internalization, many peptides translocate into the nucleus and even bind DNA.
      <br/>
      Peptides that been shown to accumulate in the nuclei of target cells include insulin, growth hormone, prolactin, nerve growth factor, somatostatin, epidermal growth factor, fibroblast growth factor, platelet-derived growth factor, and interferons.

      Nuclear binding sites have been described for gonadotropin-releasing hormone, gonadotropin, growth hormone, angiotensin II, prolactin, transferrin, insulin, various interleukins, glucagon, various opioids, and growth factors (including epidermal growth factor, nerve growth factor, platelet-derived growth factor and fibroblast growth factor).

      One method that has been used to increase the tumor-to-background ratio of radioligand for therapy or imaging is to decrease the uptake of radioactivity by the background tissue by altering the rapidity of degradation or excretion.
      <br/>
      When the background radiation level decreases, the tumor-to-background ratio increases; however, the amount of radioligand accumulated by the tumor cell remains the same.
      <br/>
      Thus the actual therapeutic dose (the dose inside the cell) does not change, even though the tumor image will show more contrast against the background.
    </p>
    <p num="14">
      Methods that have been used to increase tumor cell uptake of the radioligand, and thus increase the therapeutic or diagnostic dose, include the following: using a radioligand more targeted to the tumor cells, using a radioligand with a higher diffusion rate into the tissue, changing the elimination rate of the radioligand, using a radioligand with a longer biologic half-life, using a radioisotope with a longer physical half-life, and using a higher dose of the radioligand.
      <br/>
      The radioligand has been administered either by a single bolus dose or by short infusion of up to 2 hours.
      <br/>
      Models have been developed to try to identify parameters that can be optimized to make the uptake more efficient.
      <br/>
      These models share the basic assumption that the radiolabeled compound is given in a single bolus dose.

      Radioimaging and radiotherapy are increasingly important in identifying and killing unwanted tumor cells.

      The effectiveness of the radioligand depends on the concentration that is accumulated in the target cells.
      <br/>
      Although methods have been developed to increase the tumor to background ratio, few methods have actually increased the concentration of the radioligand inside either the tumor cells or closely associated angiogenic cells.
      <br/>
      Thus, there is a need for a method to increase the accumulation and retention of radioligand inside the target cells without an increase in the destruction of normal body cells.

      We have discovered that administering a radioisotopic compound by infusion over a period of time greater than two hours, preferably greater than twelve hours, greatly increases the maximum radioactivity that accumulates in the target cell.

      Accumulation of the radiolabeled compound in target tissues can be about five times higher than that resulting from bolus injection or short infusion methods.
      <br/>
      This method enhances the tumor-to-background radioactivity ratio by increasing the amount of radioligand accumulated inside the target cells.

      This method may be used with any radiolabeled compound whose cellular uptake rate is limited by binding to a cellular receptor or to a transport protein.

      Once the radiolabeled compound is internalized, the biological half-life plays no more than a minor role in the residence time.

      We have shown that infusion over a period greater than 2 hr, preferably greater than about 12 hr, more preferably 24 hr, greatly increases the measured radioactivity inside the target cells.
      <br/>
      The infusion method increases the accumulated radioactivity in tumor or angiogenic cells for almost all radiolabeled receptor-dependent peptides and steroids.
      <br/>
      Without wishing to be bound by this theory, the underlying mechanism is believed to be as follows.
      <br/>
      Binding to a cellular receptor (whether membrane, cytoplasmic, or nuclear) or to a transport protein, which is necessary for peptides and steroids to affect cellular processes, occurs over a finite period of time.
      <br/>
      If an excess of radiolabeled compound (more than the receptor or the transport protein can bind at any one moment) is administered, the cell's take-up of that compound is limited by the number of available receptors or transport protein molecules.
      <br/>
      The remaining unbound compound is subject to degradation or excretion.
      <br/>
      By the time the receptor is free to bind another molecule, the circulating radiolabeled compound has been partially or completely eliminated.
      <br/>
      However, if the rate of receptor binding and subsequent transport of the radiolabeled compound is matched with the rate of administration of the radiolabeled compound, then circulating unbound radioligand will be available to bind to the recycled receptors.
      <br/>
      Thus, the effective dose of the drug, i.e., its intracellular accumulation, is optimized.
    </p>
    <p num="33">
      This theory is consistent with the observation that compounds that are internalized (e.g., peptides, hormones, cytokines, growth factors, and steroids) are resistant to competition or have a lower rate of competition than compounds that bind only on the cell surface.
      <br/>
      Experiments that have monitored the rate of internalization or translocation of radioligands have all considered short binding periods (0 to 4 hr).
      <br/>
      We have demonstrated in vitro that, for radiolabeled somatostatin analogs for a time up to at least 120 hr, there is a progressive translocation of membrane-bound receptors and cytoplasmic receptors to the nucleus.
      <br/>
      Since the radiolabeled compounds bind not only to nuclear receptors but also specifically to the DNA, effective radiotherapies may use radiolabeled compounds labeled with low-energy emitters, such as Auger electrons, which have a short radius of emitted radioactivity.
      <br/>
      These electrons must be incorporated into the nucleus to damage the DNA.
      <br/>
      Auger emitters inhibit cell division with minimal effect on neighboring cells.
    </p>
    <p num="34">
      To optimize cellular accumulation of a radiolabeled compound, its rate of infusion is matched with its rate of cellular uptake and translocation, preferentially into the nucleus, more preferentially onto the DNA.

      Matching the rate of binding, internalization, and translocation results in more efficient accumulation within the cell than is possible by bolus or short-term infusion therapy.
      <br/>
      The novel long-term infusion technique allows receptors to be recycled over and over again, resulting in increased internalization, translocation, and ultimately, deposition in the cytoplasm, its organelles, the nucleus, or DNA.
      <br/>
      This increase in accumulation of radioactivity provides optimal imaging and optimal in situ radiation therapy.
    </p>
    <p num="35">More efficient uptake of the radiolabeled compound by the cell provides more efficient utilization of the compound, i.e., more compound bound in target cells, and less exposure of a toxic compound to normal cells.</p>
    <p num="36">
      We have demonstrated that once a compound is internalized in the cell, it is less available for competition or degradation.
      <br/>
      Thus, the biologic half-life of the compound becomes less important, and the physical half-life of the radioisotope becomes the rate-limiting step.
      <br/>
      Many peptides, growth factors, and hormones have very short biologic half-lives.
      <br/>
      If radiolabeled peptides, growth factors, or hormones are given by infusion, and are translocated into the cell where they are no longer subject to active competition with unlabeled hormones, and are protected from degradation and excretion, the physical half-life of the isotope becomes more important in determining the amount of radioactivity accumulated in the cell than the biologic half-life.

    <p num="37">
      The uptake of the radiolabeled compound for either radioimaging or radiotherapy can be monitored using nuclear medicine scintigraphy procedures known in the field, for example a nuclear medicine camera.
      <br/>
      Regions of interest can be displayed as computer images to assess uptake of the radiolabeled compound.
      <br/>
      Radioactivity and its duration in the tumor or angiogenic cells may be calculated.

      Infusional therapy provides higher effective doses that remain for a longer time in the tumor or angiogenic cells.

    <p num="63">
      Based on the observations from the final bolus dose and the first two infusion doses, it is evident that an equivalent dose administered by the different methods accumulated at very different rates.
      <br/>
      With a bolus injection of 178.8 mCi, the maximum external gamma dose rate occurred soon after the injection, and decreased to about 34 mR/hr at 24 hr post injection, a 24 hr ratio of 0.19 mR/hr measured external dose for each mCi delivered.
      <br/>
      For Infusion Dose 1, with an infusion rate of 2.5 mCi per hour for 3 days, an increase was seen both in the area under the accumulation curve (the total amount of radiation absorbed by the tumor) and in the peak external radiation dose rate (mR/hr surface contact).
      <br/>
      The dose rate measured about 55 mR/hr after only one-third of the radioligand had been infused, and this rate was maintained or exceeded for the next three days.
      <br/>
      The highest mR/mCi ratio of 1.03 occurred after the first 24 hr infusion, and was almost five times higher than the highest ratio from the bolus injection.
      <br/>
      The slope of the dose accumulation curve was maximal during the first 24 hr, and then flattened over the next 48 to 72 hr, implying that the system had reached a limit with minimal subsequent uptake.
      <br/>
      After 24 hr, the cellular "feedback" mechanisms slowed uptake.
    </p>
    <p num="64">
      When the bulk of the dose was infused in the first 24 hr as in Infusions 2 and 3, 189.8 and 301 mCi respectively, and the infusion rate was then lowered for subsequent 24 hr periods, a greater area under the curve and a higher peak activity (220 and 470 mR/hour) were achieved.
      <br/>
      These data indicate the importance of administering a large dose during the first 24 hr before the internal "feedback" mechanisms slow the rate of uptake.
    </p>
    <p num="65">
      The differences among the four curves are not intuitive.
      <br/>
      The data suggest that the radioligand was protected from removal by degradation, competition, or excretion once it was incorporated into the cell, and that the cellular transport machinery continued to import radioligand despite higher concentrations inside the cell until "feedback" mechanisms slowed uptake at 16 to 24 hr.
    </p>
    <p num="66">By plotting the data on a semi-logarithmic scale, as shown in FIG. 2, and evaluating the total area under the curves, two important concepts are evident:</p>
    <p num="67">
      (1) Initial removal of peptide was far more substantial for bolus administration, leaving less peptide for cellular incorporation.
      <br/>
      The incorporation of radioligand by the cells was demonstrated by exponential decay, in which the half-life approached the physical half-life of the radioligand (67.3 hr).
      <br/>
      The slope of this decay line was remarkably consistent, regardless of dose sequencing.
      <br/>
      (2) When normalized for the dose administered, the area under the curve (or residence time) increased up to five-fold simply by adjusting when and how the dose was administered.
      <br/>
      For the bolus injection, the area under the curve in FIG. 1 is 4,030 mR, corresponding to a ratio of 23 mR accumulated per mCi delivered.
      <br/>
      The comparable areas for the infusion experiments are 10,398 mR, 37,370 mR, and 41,993 mR.
      <br/>
      These data correspond to ratios of radioligand accumulated per mCi delivered of 66 mR/mCi, 96 mR/mCi, and 121 mR/mCi respectively.
      <br/>
      Thus the infusion ratios were 3, 4, and 5 fold higher than the bolus ratio.
      <br/>
      Infusion allowed more of the available radioligand to be incorporated into the tumor cell.
    </p>
    <p num="68">
      For Infusion Dose 3, this same patient was monitored with gamma camera scintigraphy.
      <br/>
      The photographs indicated not only an increase in uptake of the radiolabeled compound, but also more tumor foci could be identified.
      <br/>
      Additionally, the radioactivity remained in the tumor area for a longer period of time than was seen earlier in the bolus administration.
      <br/>
      In this patient, the tumor foci were still identifiable by gamma scintigraphy thirteen days after completion of the last infusion dose.

    <p num="69">EXAMPLE 2</p>
    <p num="70">In vitro experiments using radiolabeled somatostatin analogs and human cell lines were performed to follow the uptake of a radiolabeled peptide over time in multiple cell types.</p>
    <p num="71">Cell Lines</p>
    <p num="72">
      The cells included: (1) IMR-32 (ATCC No. CCL-127), a human neuroblastoma cell line with a very high expression level of somatostatin receptors (SST), predominantly SST-2; (2) SKNSH (ATCC No. HTB-11), a human neuroblastoma bone marrow metastatic cell that lacks somatostatin receptors as defined by either a binding assay or reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RTPCR); and (3) SK-R2, a SKNSH-derived cell line transfected with the gene for the SST-2 receptor.
      <br/>
      The IMR-32 and the SK-R2 cells express somatostatin receptors type 2 (SST-2).
      <br/>
      The SKNSH cells do not express somatostatin receptors and served as a negative control.
      <br/>
      Cell lines were obtained from the ATCC (IMR-32 and SKNSH) or from Ohio State University (Columbus, Ohio) (SK-R2).
      <br/>
      All cells lines were maintained in 5% CO2 at 37 (degree)  C. in media defined by the suppliers of the cell lines.
    </p>
    <p num="73">Peptide Binding and Internalization Assay</p>
    <p num="74">
      Cells were harvested, counted with a hemocytometer, and resuspended in binding buffer (Minimum Essential Medium (MEM), 10 mM Hepes, 0.01% BSA).
      <br/>
      A standard assay used 500,000 cells in 1 ml of binding buffer.
      <br/>
      Radioactive ligand alone (500,000 cpm), or in combination with at least 1,000-fold molar excess (10-6 M) non-radioactive compound (to calculate specific binding), was added to a final volume of 1 ml.
      <br/>
      At the termination of the experiment, the incubation medium was removed, the cells were rinsed twice with Hanks balanced salt solution (HBSS), and the radioactivity in the cells determined using a gamma counter.
      <br/>
      This level of radioactivity represents total binding, which includes both membrane-bound and internalized fractions.
      <br/>
      Specific binding was determined by calculating the difference in the levels of measured radioactivity without the unlabeled competitor minus the radioactivity with the unlabeled competitor.
    </p>
    <p num="75">
      To differentiate between membrane and intracellular binding, cells were subsequently incubated for 10 min at 4 (degree)  C. with acidified HBSS (pH=4-5), rinsed in HBSS, and the radioactivity again determined using the gamma counter.
      <br/>
      Since the acid wash preferentially released the radioactive ligand from the external surface of the cell, remaining radioactivity was attributed to internalized fractions.
      <br/>
      Membrane-associated binding was then calculated as the difference between the total binding and internalized fractions.
    </p>
    <p num="76">Ligand Binding and Internalization as a Function of Time</p>
    <p num="77">
      The times for ligand binding and internalization were analyzed using the standard assay methods described above.
      <br/>
      All radioactive ligands and competitors used were somatostatin analogs that preferentially bind to SST-2 cell receptors.
      <br/>
      The first series of experiments used IMR-32 cells that were exposed to a radioligand for varying periods of time (up to 72 hr).
      <br/>
      The incubation media was replaced at least every 48 hr.
      <br/>
      The radioligands included 125 I-WOC-4a, 131 I-WOC-4a, 125 I-WOC-3b, and 111 In-pentetreotide.
      <br/>
      The unlabeled competitor was octreotide acetate.
      <br/>
      WOC-4a and WOC-3b are multi-tyrosinated, SST-2-preferring somatostatin analogs that can be labeled to a high specific activity (8,800 Ci/mmol) and still retain high biologic activity and receptor binding affinity (Kd=1 nM).
      <br/>
      WOC-3b and WOC-4a have the same structures and synthesis as WOC-3B and WOC-4 described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,597,894.
    </p>
    <p num="78">
      The specific binding and internalization data for 125 I-WOC-4a, 131 I-WOC-4a, 125 I-WOC-3b, and 111 In-pentetreotide radiolabeled compounds are presented in FIGS. 3, 4, 5, and 6, respectively.
      <br/>
      The data indicate that the binding of somatostatin analogs to their cellular receptors increased over time with maximal binding occurring at 48-72 hours.
      <br/>
      Significant fractions of total radioactivity (40-75%) were incorporated into the cell.
    </p>
    <p num="79">EXAMPLE 3</p>
    <p num="80">Determination of Rate of Loss of Radioactivity</p>
    <p num="81">
      Cell lines and assay techniques were as described in Example 2.
      <br/>
      IMR-32 cells were incubated for 48 hr in 125 I-WOC-4a (1 CPM/cell) and washed three times in HBSS.
      <br/>
      Cells were counted to determine baseline radioactivity.
      <br/>
      Cells were maintained in MEM with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), and the media was replaced daily.
      <br/>
      Radioactivity of the replaced media was counted, and the percent loss of radioactivity from the cells was calculated over time.
      <br/>
      These results are shown in FIG. 7, which shows that the retention time of 125 I-WOC-4a was about 11 days.
      <br/>
      This result is highly surprising since the described biologic half-life of somatostatin is measured in minutes, and all known somatostatin analog half-lives are measured in hours (octreotide acetate, 90-120 min; lanreotide, 60-90 min).
    </p>
    <p num="82">
      This experiment demonstrated that once a radiolabeled compound is internalized into the cell, its retention time and thus its ability to deliver radiation to the cell are markedly extended.
      <br/>
      The internalized peptide is protected from degradation, and the physical half-life of the isotope becomes the critical determinant of radiation dose.
      <br/>
      Because the measured loss of radioactivity included any loss due to cell death and subsequent loss of membrane integrity, the actual retention time of the radioligand inside an intact cell might be somewhat longer than the measured 11 days.
    </p>
    <p num="83">The results of Examples 2 and 3 provided three important observations that support the use of this method in radioimaging and radiotherapy: (a) a substantial proportion of the receptor and its associated radioligand were sequestered within the cell; (b) progressive receptor-mediated internalization occurred over an extended period of time (at least 48 hr); and (c) internalization increased the retention time substantially.</p>

      As seen in Table 5, no specific binding was detected with the SKNSH cells, which lack somatostatin receptors.

      However, in the IMR-32 cells, significant levels of specific binding were observed on the cell membrane and inside the cells.
      <br/>
      Specific membrane binding was also observed in the SK-R2 cells (genetically engineered to overproduce the SST-2 membrane receptor).
      <br/>
      In the SK-R2 cell line, 95% of binding was associated with the plasma membrane, and relatively less internalization of ligand occurred.
      <br/>
      Scatchard plot analysis revealed an apparent dissociation constant (a measure of the affinity of the binding between the ligand and the receptor) of 1 * 10-9 M to 4 * 10-9 M for the SK-R2 and IMR-32 cells respectively, which is in the range expected for these receptor-ligand interactions.
    </p>
    <p num="89">This experiment demonstrated that (a) the binding of somatostatin analogs to their receptors and subsequent internalization is specific for cells expressing the somatostatin receptor; and (b) internalization requires other cellular components (probably signal transduction elements not seen in the genetically engineered cells), and is not an intrinsic function of the membrane receptor alone.</p>
    <p num="90">EXAMPLE 5</p>
    <p num="91">Pulse-Chase Studies</p>
    <p num="92">
      To ascertain the role of competition after internalization, IMR-32 cells were incubated with a radioligand for a time sufficient for internalization to occur, and were then incubated with unlabeled radioligand.

      One set of culture tubes was subsequently acid-washed and then incubated for 2 hours with an excess of unlabeled octreotide acetate (a cold chase).

      The levels of radioactivity were then compared to those for tubes that did not undergo the cold chase.
      <br/>
      As indicated in FIG. 8, the levels of radioactivity remaining in the cells were similar for both the control and the cold-chase tubes, indicating that once internalized the radioligand was not competed by a unlabeled compound.
      <br/>
      These observations have significant implications for the use of somatostatin analogs as radiotherapy: intracellular radioactive ligand can not be competed out by an unlabeled competitor, and thus will be retained in the cell.

      <br/>
      The cell homogenate was mixed with Percoll to give a final concentration of 0.292% Percoll and spun at 20,400 rpm in a Beckman 40.2 rotor for 45 min to generate a density gradient.

      <br/>
      The usual assumption was made that the radioactivity measured in fractions rich in a certain cell component was in fact associated with that component; e.g., the radioactivity measured in a fraction rich in plasma membrane was due to association of the radiolabeled compound with the plasma membrane.

      <br/>
      At 24 hr, FIG. 9C, almost all activity was seen in the nuclear fractions, indicating that the 125 I-WOC-4a had been translocated to the nucleus.
      <br/>
      Thus, the data indicated that several hours were required for this radiolabeled compound to bind to membrane receptors, for those receptors to be internalized into the cell, and for the radioligand to be translocated to the nucleus.

      Radiodecaying nuclei will then ionize DNA, resulting in cellular damage.

      FIGS. 11A (1 hr data), 11B (4 hr data), and 11C (24 hr data) indicate that the timing for internalization and translocation for 111 In-pentetreotide was similar to that of 125 I-WOC-4a.

      Overall, the protease treatment removed only 10-13% of total bound CPM, showing that the association of the radioligand with DNA was not due to binding to nonspecific proteins such as histones.

    <p num="108">
      The kinetics of radioligand binding to the DNA was comparable to that seen for the intracellular movement in IMR-32.

      WOC-4a was synthesized by solid-phase synthesis techniques as described previously in Example 2 and U.S. Pat. No. 5,597,894. IMR-32 human neuroblastoma cells (ATCC -CCL-127, American Type Culture Collection, Rockville, Md.), which have been previously shown to express SST-2 receptors, and PANC-1 human pancreatic epithelial carcinoma cells (ATCC -CRL-1469), which are SST-2-negative, were maintained in culture at 37 (degree)  C. in humidified air with 5% CO2.
      <br/>
      IMR-32 cells were cultured in Eagle's Minimum Essential Medium (MEM) with Earle's salts (Gibco, Grand Island, N.Y.) and supplemented with non-essential amino acids, 15% fetal bovine serum (Gibco, Grand Island, N.Y.), and an antibiotic-antimycotic agent (Gibco, Grand Island, N.Y.).

      For short-term cytotoxicity experiments, cells were harvested, washed, and seeded in 96-well cell culture clusters (Costar, Cambridge, Mass.) at a density of 5 * 103 cells/well.
      <br/>
      In the short-term, dose-ranging experiments, cells were incubated in binding buffer (MEM, 10 mM HEPES, 0.01% BSA). 125 I-WOC-4a was added to the appropriate wells in concentrations ranging from 0.1-100 CPM/cell.
      <br/>
      After exposure, the radioactive medium was replaced with culture medium and the cells were maintained for an additional five days.

      After cryopreservation, cells were rapidly thawed, and viability was assessed with trypan blue exclusion (n=3/group).

      Following short-term drug exposure, the effect of each dose of 125 I-WOC-4a on viability of IMR-32 and PANC-1 cells was determined.

      Mean cell viability ( +- SD) was calculated and the dose effect analyzed by analysis of variance (ANOVA).
      <br/>
      Student's t-tests were used when viability was compared for a single drug concentration between the two cell types.
      <br/>

    <p num="115">
      When IMR-32 cells were incubated for 48 hr with 125 I-WOC-4a at doses ranging from 0.1-100 CPM/cell, there was a dose-dependent decrease in cell viability, as measured by the MTT assay. 125 I-WOC-4a induced a 33% decrease in cell viability at a dose of 1 CPM/cell and an 87% decrease in cell viability at a dose of 100 CPM/cell (FIG. 14).
      <br/>
      These differences were statistically different by ANOVA (p&lt;0.05).
      <br/>
      However, when the SST-2 negative cell line (PANC-1) was exposed to the same concentrations of 125 I-WOC-4a, no statistically significant difference in cell viability between control and any treatment group (n=21 per group) was found as shown in FIG. 14. These results indicate that following a short-term (48hr) exposure, 125 I-WOC-4a induces SST-2-dependent cytotoxicity.
    </p>
    <p num="116">
      For evaluating the effect of a long-term (4-week) exposure to 125 1I-WOC-4a on SST-2 expressing cells, IMR-32 cells were exposed to either 1 CPM/cell 125 I-WOC-4a, 1 CPM/cell 125 I-WOC-4a with 106 M octreotide acetate, 106 M octreotide acetate alone, 125 I alone, or 125 I with octreotide acetate.
      <br/>
      Cell viability of each treatment group was compared to control values after a four-week, cryopreserved exposure.
      <br/>
      These data are shown in FIG. 15. 125 I-WOC-4a induced statistically significant cytotoxicity; however, no cytotoxicity was seen following exposure to similar doses of 125 I alone or 125 I with octreotide acetate.
      <br/>
      In addition, 125 I-WOC-4a cytotoxicity was not inhibited by the addition of a 10,000-fold excess of octreotide acetate, implying that intracellular incorporation of small amounts of 125 I-WOC-4a may be cytotoxic to SST-2-positive cells.
      <br/>
      This cryopreserved technique allows a long-term exposure to the radioligand but prevents cell proliferation that might mask the radioligand's cytotoxic effects.
    </p>
    <p num="117">
      These studies demonstrated that 125 I-WOC-4a induced cytotoxicity in neuroblastoma cells that express SST-2 receptors.

A solution was prepared of 12.5  MU g estradiol conjugate (BL-43), 25  MU l methanol, 50  MU l 0.05 M phosphate buffer pH 7.5, 3 mCi Na125 I, and 25  MU l of a mixture of 10 mg chloramine-T and 10 ml 0.05 M phosphate buffer.
      <br/>
      After mixing for 40 sec, 25  MU l of sodium metabisulfite 20 mg/10 ml 0.05 M Phosphate buffer was added and mixed an additional 40 sec.

      The mixture was then added to the Sephadex column and eluted first with 0.1 M PBS. Finally, the radiolabeled estradiol was eluted with 0.1 M PBS and 1,4 Dioxane (70:30).

      Should at least two drug-related NCI Grade IV toxicities occur, treatment will be terminated at that level.
      <br/>
      The number of courses that can be administered will then be determined as dose limiting.
    </p>
    <p num="139">
      Patients will be examined prior to each treatment and monthly for 3 months following therapy.
      <br/>
      Their quality of life will be assessed by clinical benefits, including reduced pain, weight gain, or reduced malaise.
      <br/>
      Clinical responses will be determined as either present, no change, or absent.
      <br/>
      Biochemical responses will be assessed by the measurement of plasma chromogranin A and/or 24 hr urinary 5-HIAA or other elevated disease-related markers.
      <br/>
      A partial response is defined as a 50% or greater decrease in a tumor marker.
      <br/>
      Radiographic responses will be determined by comparing the product of the perpendicular tumor diameters using the following WHO criteria: (a) Complete response: the complete disappearance of disease; (b) Partial response: a 50% or greater decrease; (c) Stable response: less than a 50% decrease and less than a 20% increase; and (d) Progressive disease: greater than a 20% increase.

    <p num="140">Data Analysis</p>
    <p num="141">
      The sample size for the phase I pilot study is determined by the objective of this study as stated above.
      <br/>
      In a preliminary trial, if the drug under investigation is 20% or more effective, one or more treatment successes should be seen in the first fourteen patients treated, with a confidence level of 95%.
      <br/>
      If a success is not seen in the first fourteen patients, the drug does not merit further investigational use.
      <br/>
      Thus, the sample size for this phase I study shall be fourteen evaluable patients.
      <br/>
      An additional 15 subjects will be studied after an interval analysis of the first 14 subjects.
      <br/>
      This latter group will assist in determining toxicity and efficacy.
      <br/>
      It is anticipated that indolent neuroendocrine neoplasms will dominate the first 15 slots since this population has shown the greatest potential of benefit.

    <p num="142">
      To determine whether bolus or continuous 111 In pentetreotide administration is optimal, areas under the 3 curves (mRoentgen/hr vs time) will be compared, and half-lives calculated.
      <br/>
      The optimal method of administration will be that method resulting in the largest area under the curve, with standard statistical tests to compare between and within subjects depending upon the distribution of the variance and whether parametric measures are indicated.
      <br/>
      The statistical software package NCSS or "Number Crunching Statistical Software" will be used.

    <p num="144">Accumulation of Radiolabeled Somatostatin Analogs in Angiogenic Cells</p>
    <p num="145">
      To demonstrate that radiolabeled somatostatin analogs accumulate in angiogenic blood vessels, nude mice were implanted with SKNSH human neuroblastoma tumor cells lacking somatostatin receptors.
      <br/>
      The tumors were allowed to grow to about 1 cm in diameter, a period of approximately three to four weeks.
      <br/>
      The mice were then injected with 50  MU Ci of 125 I-WOC-4a.
      <br/>
      The radioligand was allowed to clear for 1 week.
      <br/>
      On Day 7 the mice were scanned on a photosensitive plate and a standard x-ray plate.
      <br/>
      The resulting photographs were superimposed in register to allow localization of the radioligand.
      <br/>
      The radioligand was localized in the tumor.
      <br/>
      Because the tumor cells did not have receptors for somatostatin analogs and could not bind the radioligand, it was concluded that the radioligand seen in the tumor area was bound by angiogenic blood vessels.
    </p>
    <p num="146">
      Human placental-derived vascular endothelial cells were used to assay for cell binding of the somatostatin analog, 125 I-JIC-2D.
      <br/>
      The radioligand, a somatostatin analog, 125 I-JIC-2D, was made by solid phase peptide synthesis as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,597,894. This peptide has an amino acid sequence of the following: D-Lys-D-Tyr-D-Lys-D-Tyr-D-Lys-C�Cys-Phe-D-Trp-Lys-Thr-Cys�-Thr-NH2.
      <br/>
      The cells were obtained by growing discs of human placental veins in fibrinclots for 14 days.
      <br/>
      In this method, a fraction of discs exhibit an angiogenic response.
      <br/>
      These discs and their angiogenic sprouts are harvested mechanically and dissociated by vortexing.
      <br/>
      The vein discs are then discarded and the endothelial cells pooled.
      <br/>
      Cells were harvested, counted with a hemocytometer, and resuspended in binding buffer (Minimum Essential Medium (MEM), 10 mM Hepes, 0.01% BSA).
      <br/>
      A standard assay used 500,000 cells in 1 ml of binding buffer.
      <br/>
      Radioactive ligand alone (500,000 cpm), or in combination with at least 1,000-fold molar excess (10-6 M) non-radioactive compound (to calculate specific binding), was added to a final volume of 1 ml.
      <br/>
      At the termination of the experiment, the incubation medium was removed, the cells were rinsed twice with Hanks balanced salt solution (HBSS), and the radioactivity in the cells determined using a gamma counter.
      <br/>
      This level of radioactivity represents total binding, which includes both membrane-bound and internalized fractions.
      <br/>
      Specific binding was determined by calculating the difference in the levels of measured radioactivity without the unlabeled competitor minus the radioactivity with the unlabeled competitor.
    </p>
    <p num="147">
      To differentiate between membrane and intracellular binding, cells were subsequently incubated for 10 min at 4 (degree)  C. with acidified HBSS (pH=4-5), rinsed in HBSS, and the radioactivity again determined using the gamma counter.
      <br/>
      Since the acid wash preferentially released the radioactive ligand from the external surface of the cell, remaining radioactivity was attributed to internalized fractions.
    </p>
    <p num="148">As shown in FIG. 17, the radiolabeled somatostatin analog bound to the angiogenic cells and the vast majority of the radioligand was internalized into the cell.</p>

    <p num="150">Radiolabeled Somatostatin Analog Inhibition of Angiogenic Cell Growth</p>
    <p num="151">
      To demonstrate that radiolabeled somatostatin analogs inhibit angiogenic blood vessel growth, the Human Placental Vein Angiogenesis Model was used as described in J. C. Watson et al., "Up-Regulation of Somatostatin Receptor Subtype 2 (SST-2) mRNA Occurs During the Transformation of Human Endothelium to the Angiogenic Phenotype," Paper Presented at the 12th International Symposium on Regulatory Peptides, Copenhagen, Denmark, September 1996; J. C. Watson et al., "SST-2 Gene Expression Appears During Human Angiogenesis," Regulatory Peptides, vol. 64, p. 206 (Abstract) (1996); and J. C. Watson et al., "Breast Cancer Increases Initiation of Angiogenesis Without Accelerating Neovessel Growth Rate," Surgery, vol. 122, pp. 508-14 (1997).
      <br/>
      Human placental veins were cut into discs of 2 mm diameter and were incorporated into a 0.3% fibrinogen gel.
      <br/>
      This gel was then overlaid with tissue culture media containing 10-20% fetal calf serum (FCS).
      <br/>
      Under normal conditions, endothelial cords will begin to sprout from the transected cut edge of the vein discs within six days.
    </p>
    <p num="152">
      These vein discs were placed into wells of three separate culture plates.
      <br/>
      One culture plate, the control sample, was allowed to grow without treatment.
      <br/>
      Another plate was treated with 50  MU Ci/mL of the radiolabeled somatostatin analog, 111 In-pentetreotide; and the third plate treated with equivalent amounts of 111 In-Cl.
      <br/>
      The discs were then incubated for fourteen days.
      <br/>
      After 14 days the culture plates were examined for the number of wells in which angiogenic growth was initiated.
      <br/>
      The percentage initiation is shown in FIG. 18. The % initiation seen in both treated culture plates was substantially less than the control plate.
      <br/>
      The lowest % initiation was seen in the culture plate treated with 111 In-pentetreotide.
      <br/>
      The molar concentration of the radiolabeled somatostatin analog added to the culture plates was in the femtomolar range (10-15).
      <br/>
      This concentration is 1000 *  or more below the concentration of unlabeled somatostatin analog that is known to inhibit angiogenesis; a concentration of 10-5 M to 10-8 M. Thus any effect was due to the radiolabel and not just the presence of the somatostatin analog.
      <br/>
      Any difference between the 111 In-Cl and 111 In-pentetreotide is due to an effect of Auger emission on angiogenic cell growth through Auger effect on the DNA.
      <br/>
      Only the radiolabel connected to the somatostatin analog would be incorporated into the DNA.
      <br/>
      Thus the greater decrease is due to this incorporation and the Auger emission on DNA.
    </p>
    <p num="153">
      Using a digital image analyzer, the mean area of the sprouting tissue surrounding the discs was measured.
      <br/>
      As shown in FIG. 19, the vessel area (mm2) was also substantially less in both treated culture plates.
      <br/>
      Again, the plate treated with the 111 In-pentetreotide showed the least area of new growth.
    </p>
    <p num="154">
      To measure the growth rate of angiogenic vascular tissue, every two days during the 14-day incubation period, the length of sprouts were measured.
      <br/>
      The growth rate as measured by mm/day for all three culture plates is given in FIG. 20. Again, the growth rate in the two treated culture plates is substantially below that of the control.
      <br/>
      However, there is no difference in the growth rate between the two treated samples.
    </p>
    <p num="155">
      Thus, the radiolabeled somatostatin analog inhibited angiogenic vascular growth even at concentrations far lower than that required for the unlabeled analog to inhibit angiogenic growth.
      <br/>
      This indicates that the gamma emission causes some inhibition and the Auger emission by the radiolabeled analog caused additional inhibition.
      <br/>
      The most effective inhibition was the radiolabeled analog, which included both effect of gamma and Auger emission.
    </p>
    <p num="156">
      Other somatostatin analogs will be tested using the same human placental vascular discs.
      <br/>
      These discs will be placed into wells of two separate culture plates.
      <br/>
      One culture plate will be allowed to grow to maturity without treatment.
      <br/>
      The other culture plate will be exposed to various treatments: (1) radiolabeled somatostatin analog (125 I-WOC-4a, 131 I-WOC-4a, 111 In-DPTA-WOC-4a, 111 In-DPTA-JIC-2D, 125 I-JIC-2D, or dual labelled 111 In-DPTA-125 I-WOC-4a or 111 In-DPTA-125 I-JIC-2D,); (2) cold, unlabeled somatostatin analog (WOC-4a or JIC-2D); (3) radioisotope alone (125 I or 131 I); (4) a combination of the radiolabeled somatostatin analog and its corresponding unlabeled analog (e.g., 125 I-WOC-4a and WOC-4a); or (5) a combination of the cold, unlabeled somatostatin analog and the unbound radioisotope (e.g., 125 I and WOC-4a).
      <br/>
      The discs will be incubated for three days with the analog present in a dose ranging from 10 to 1,000,000 counts per well.
      <br/>
      After three days fresh media will be added and the discs observed until maturity.
      <br/>
      The percentage of wells that initiate an angiogenic response will be calculated for non-treated and treated wells.
      <br/>
      The results from the different treatments will be analyzed with ANOVA.
    </p>
    <p num="157">
      Alternatively, to amplify the degree of cell destruction caused by the radioactivity, the vein discs will be cryoprotected and kept frozen in liquid nitrogen after a three day exposure to the radioligand.
      <br/>
      Freezing will inhibit cell division but will not affect radioactivity.
      <br/>
      Another set of plates will be constructed with identically treated vein discs but no radiation source.
      <br/>
      At the end of three days of treatment, these vein discs will be harvested, washed, and cryopreserved in tissue culture media containing 10% dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO).
      <br/>
      These vein discs will be cryopreserved in a controlled-rate freezer and stored in liquid nitrogen for 2 months, or for a period that is six times the physical half-life of the radioisotope used.
      <br/>
      At this time, the vein discs will be thawed and re-planted in fibrinogen gel-containing wells and allowed to grow as described above.
      <br/>
      After two weeks of growth, the treated and non-treated wells will be compared.
    </p>
    <p num="158">
      These experiments demonstrate that radiolabeled somatostatin analogs will selectively inhibit initiation or promotion of the human angiogenic response in a manner similar to inhibition of tumor cell growth in tumor cells with somatostatin receptors.
      <br/>
      Thus, for use of radiolabeled somatostatin analogs in either radioimaging or radiotherapy for angiogenic blood vessels, administration by infusion will be more effective than a bolus injection.

    <p num="160">Upregulation of PDGF Receptors in Human Angiogenic Cells</p>
    <p num="161">
      Using the in vitro human placental vein angiogenesis model described above, we substituted discs taken from human vascular endothelium from aorta and inferior vena cava to assay for presence of platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) and its receptor.
      <br/>
      A similar angiogenic response was seen in fourteen days of incubating the 2 mm discs in a 0.3% fibrin clot, supplemented with fetal bovine serum.
      <br/>
      RNA was extracted from inferior vena cava and aorta that was obtained from organ donors and from the tissue-matched angiogenic explants cultured as above.
      <br/>
      Reverse transcription polymerase chain reactions (RT-PCR) were then conducted on each sample with primers specific for the PDGF A chain, B chain and the receptor using 500 ng of RNA per reaction.
      <br/>
      Primers were made according to published sequence data.
      <br/>
      RT-PCR products were analyzed by gel electrophoresis which revealed bands in the expected positions for these products in the angiogenic explants of both the aorta and inferior vena cava, but not in their native vessel counterparts.
      <br/>
      These results were repeated in blood vessel samples from three patients with identical results.
      <br/>
      This suggests both the PDGF A chain and B chain may play an important role in the regulation of the angiogenic response.
      <br/>
      This indicates that radiotherapy directed toward this growth factor or its receptor may be effective in limiting development of angiogenesis associated with tumor growth.
