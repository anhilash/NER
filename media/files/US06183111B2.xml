      A figurative structure for clamping a decorative lamp string, having a lamp-mounting frame with a plurality of fastening bases.
      <br/>
      Each fastening base has a hollow portion for mounting a socket assembly of the lamp string, every two adjacent fastening bases being connected together by means of connecting arm plates.
      <br/>
      Only a given part of each socket assembly of the lamp string mounted on the lamp-mounting frame is covered by the positioning plates or hooks 20.
      <br/>
      Thus, the front or rear side of the lamp-mounting frame can show the figurative structure formed with the socket assemblies to enable the bulbs on the fastening bases to be seen clearly.
      <br/>
      The figurative structure formed with the lamp-mounting frame can be shown completely by means of the winked bulbs.

      <br/>
      Field of the Invention
    </p>
    <p num="2">This invention relates to a decorative lamp, and particularly to a figurative structure for clamping a decorative lamp string.</p>
    <p num="3">2. Description of the Prior Art</p>
    <p num="4">In the conventional decorative lamp string for Christmas season, a plurality of sockets are mounted therein by using two or more than two power wires twisted together to connect such sockets in series; such a lamp string is subject to swinging or hanging in the air because of the sockets thereof not being fastened in place.</p>
    <p num="5">
      In the conventional decorative lamp string for a given festival, the figurative lamp-mounting frame is usually made of a metal, on which a plurality of socket assemblies connected in series with twisted power wires are mounted thereon.
      <br/>
      The power wires and the figurative lamp-mounting frame are usually not fastened together; as a result, the lamp string and the lamp-mounting frame are subject to separating from each other.
      <br/>
      Some of such lamp strings may be fastened in place with fastening cord; however, the sockets and the power wires are also subject to swinging and hanging in the air.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      In the conventional decorative lamp string for Christmas season, please reference the U.S. Pat. No. 4,802,072, it is a direction fixture for decorative lamp series comprising a socket for a bulb, wires connected to said socket and a retaining ring attached to said socket, said retaining ring being provided with a notch extending longitudinally of the socket with the wires that are connected to said socket being positioned and retained in said socket so as to fixed said socket in a desired orientation and wherein said retaining ring has an outer face which is in registry with an end rim of said socket.
      <br/>
      In the aforesaid invention, the socket assemblies and the power wires are fastened in place with fastening slips, but the socket assemblies and the power wires appear to be out of order; therefore, the lamp string has to be fastened to a lamp-mounting frame with fastening cords.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      In another conventional lamp string for Christmas season, please reference the U.S. Pat. No. 5,526,246, the front part of the figurative structure is provided with a fastening base, which is furnished with a plurality of hooks for clamping sockets respectively; then, the sockets are fastened to the figurative structure.
      <br/>
      When the bulbs wink, the figurative structure will be shown vividly.
      <br/>
      The back of the figurative structure is provided with a connection plate; as a result, such figurative structure can only be used for one-side decoration.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      In still another conventional lamp string for Christmas season, such as U.S. Pat. No. 5,727,872, the bulb-plugging end of the socket assembly has two curved surfaces on both sides thereof, and one side thereof has two symmetrical arm plates extended out; the tail ends of such arm plates have two curved hooks respectively; the inner surface of the hooks each have a curved surface to fit to the figurative lamp-mounting frame.
      <br/>
      The outer ends of the two hooks form into an opening; each socket assembly has two arm plates to form into an opening so as to click to the metal rod of the figurative lamp-mounting frame, i.e., to have the socket assembly clamped to the metal rod of the figurative lamp-mounting frame.
    </p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="9">
      The prime object of the present invention is to provide a figurative lamp-mounting frame, in which every lighting point is furnished with a fastening base, and each fastening base has an open end for plugging a decorative lamp; the open ends of every two adjacent fastening bases face opposite direction; the two adjacent fastening bases are connected together with single arms.
      <br/>
      Each of the fastening bases of the figurative lamp-mounting frame enables one of the socket assemblies to be clicked in place.
      <br/>
      The front and rear sides of each bulb mounted on the lamp-mounting frame are exposed to the air so as to have the winking of every bulb shown to form a vivid figurative structure.

      <br/>
      The socket 15 of the socket assembly 13 can be seen clearly from the front side or rear side of the lamp-mounting frame 12.
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      The open ends of every two adjacent fastening bases 18 are facing in opposite direction; each fastening base 18 includes two single arms 31, a positioning plate 21.
      <br/>
      Both single arms 31 of the fastening base 18 have a suitable thickness, and the space between the two single arms 31 is slightly larger than the maximum outer diameter of the socket 15.
      <br/>
      The front sides of the two single arms 31 are furnished with two symmetrical hooks 20 respectively; each hook 20 extends out of the outer surface of the single arm 31 at a given length.
      <br/>
      The inner surface of the hook 20 is a curved surface 24 so as to fit the curved surface 27 of the upper part of the socket 15.
      <br/>
      There is a distance between two ends of the two hooks 20, which is about equal to the thickness between the two symmetrical flat surfaces on the lower part of the socket 15 so as to form into an open end 30 between the two hooks 20, and to facilitate the socket assembly 13 to click therein.
      <br/>
      On the upper opposite side of the hook 20, there is a positioning plate 19 located between the two single arms 31 of the fastening base 18; the inner surface of the positioning plate 19 is substantially a concave surface 23, which is designed to fit the curved surface 27 on the socket 15.
      <br/>
      Between the two single arms 31 of the fastening base 18, there is a positioning plate 21 located under the hook 20; the inner surface of the positioning plate 21 is substantially a concave surface 25; both ends of the concave surface 25 extend outwards with two flat surfaces 26 respectively to the single arms 31.
      <br/>
      The distance between the two flat surfaces 26 is slightly larger than the thickness between the two symmetrical flat surfaces 28; the concave surface 25 and the two flat surfaces 26 are formed into positioning groove 32.
      <br/>
      The hollow space 22 formed by means of the positioning plate 19, the hooks 20, the positioning plate 21 and the single arms 31 is so designed as to fit the circular size of the socket 15 of the socket assembly 13 in order to let the socket assembly 13 click therein.
    </p>
    <p num="20">
      Each socket 15 of the lamp string 11 is to be clicked into the fastening base 18 by pushing the curved surface 27 of the socket 15 towards the open end 30 of the two hooks 20, or by pushing the symmetrical flat surfaces 28 under the socket towards the open end 30 of the two hooks 20, and then moving the socket assembly downwards so as to have the symmetrical flat surfaces 28 plugged into the positioning groove 32; then, the curved surface 27 of the socket 15 will be in close contact with the concave surface 23 of the positioning plate 19; the curved surface 24 of the hooks 20 will cover around the curved surface 27 on the upper part of the socket 15 so as to prevent the socket 15 from moving out.
      <br/>
      After the socket assembly 13 is fastened to the fastening base 18, the connection sleeve 33 attached to the bulb 14 will be located in a hollow portion 34 above the positioning plate 19; since the hollow portion 34 has no covering except the two arm plates 17, the bulb 14 can clearly and completely be shown on the front and rear sides of the lamp-mounting frame 12.
