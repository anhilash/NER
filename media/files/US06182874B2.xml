    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">
      1.
      <br/>
      Field of the Invention
    </p>
    <p num="3">This invention relates in general to sport and utility bags, and in particular to golf bags having various straps for reducing the stress placed on a user's shoulders and back.</p>
    <p num="4">2. Background</p>
    <p num="5">
      Golfers traditionally use golf bags to carry golf clubs, golf accessories such as golf balls, golf tees, umbrellas, raincoats, golf towels, as well as food and beverage items, among other things.
      <br/>
      A fully loaded golf bag can weigh between 20 to 60 lbs.
      <br/>
      Hence, carrying a golf bag can be physically demanding to the caddie or golfer while golfing.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      Conventional golf bags have a single shoulder strap attached to the central portion and top open portion of the golf bag.
      <br/>
      This shoulder strap permits the golfer to carry the golf bag over one shoulder, which tends to concentrate the weight of the bag on the golfer's shoulder and back.
      <br/>
      Depending on the weight of the bag, carrying a golf bag with a conventional shoulder strap can be uncomfortable and create muscle aches and soreness in the golfer's shoulder and back.
    </p>
    <p num="7">U.S. Pat. No. 5,038,984 teaches a dual strap carrying system for a golf bag which provides two shoulder straps to about a user's waist, and an attachment member is coupled to the hip belt member for attaching the hip belt member to the weight-bearing object.</p>
    <p num="8">
      The attachment member can comprise first and second attachment members, each having an adjustable fastener.
      <br/>
      The attachment members can be attached to the hip belt member at first and second attachment points on the central or hip portion of the hip belt.
      <br/>
      The attachment member may be attached by being directly sewn to the weight-bearing object.
      <br/>
      Alternatively the belt member may be fitted into a slot which may be provided on the golf bag.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      The hip belt member can be padded along the central portion, as well as the first and second hip portions, to conform to the user's hips and improve the user's comfort.
      <br/>
      The first and second waist straps can be adjustable in length so that people having different waist sizes can use the hip belt member.
      <br/>
      The belt fastener can conveniently be a bayonet-type snap clasp having a male end and a female end for simple attachment and removal of the hip belt member about the user's hips, or other suitable fastener.
      <br/>
      The padded hip belt also serves as a cushion between the golf bag and the golfers back so he is cushioned from the clubs in the bag.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      In order to keep the golfer cooler while wearing the hip belt in hot weather, the hip belt member may be made with ventilation holes or slots to allow some air flow through the belt while being worn.
      <br/>
      Integrating an open mesh fabric into the padded belt member may provide such ventilation holes or slots.
      <br/>
      The padded belt member may be made of hand-sewn layers of foam and fabric.
      <br/>
      It may also be made of compression-molded foam and fabric.
      <br/>
      In order to reduce bending and curling downward in the stress concentration areas where the attachment members and weight bearing object are attached, the hip belt may be fitted with stiffeners inside or on the outside of the belt.
      <br/>
      Such stiffening may also be provided by employing stronger, stiffer foam and fabric or a layer of stiff solid material on the outside layers of the belt while softer foam and fabric are used on the inner layers which contact the golfers body.
      <br/>
      Further, the hip belt and shoulder straps may be provided with a thin layer of heat storing material on their surfaces where they contact the user to absorb heat from the user while being worn.
      <br/>
      The heat storing material is cooled when not being worn by natural convection to the ambient air and by evaporation of sweat absorbed from the user on the surfaces.
    </p>
    <p num="11">
      According to another broad aspect of the invention, a system for carrying a weight-bearing object, such as a golf bag, is presented including a hip belt member, a belt fastener, an attachment member, and a shoulder strap.
      <br/>
      The hip belt member is provided for supporting the weight-bearing object, and the belt fastener connects the first end of the hip belt member to the second end of the hip belt member about a user's waist.
      <br/>
      The attachment member is coupled to the hip belt member for attaching the hip belt member to the weight-bearing object, and the shoulder strap is provided for lifting the bag into position and stabilizing the weight-bearing object about the user, the shoulder strap having at least one end coupled to the weight-bearing object.
    </p>
    <p num="12">
      The attachment member can include a first attachment member for coupling the hip belt member to a top portion of the weight-bearing object about a first attachment point, and a second attachment member for coupling the hip belt member to a central portion of the weight-bearing object about a second attachment point.
      <br/>
      The shoulder strap can distribute the weight of the bag onto both shoulders.
      <br/>
      The golf bag is provided with a back cushion or pillow that conforms to the lower back of the golfer.
    </p>
    <p num="13">
      U.S. Pat. No. 5,042,702 teaches a belt member having a hook and loop fastening system which mates with a corresponding piece of hook and loop attached to a golf bag.
      <br/>
      The belt member is intended to be worn at all times during play.
      <br/>
      One of the drawbacks that exist with this belt member is that it is designed to be worn throughout the golfing activity, which could adversely affect the golfer's normal swing or putting stance during play.
    </p>
    <p num="14">
      U.S. Pat. No. 5,419,473 teaches a golf bag with lumbar support and a waistband which is designed to attach to the lower portion of the golf bag.
      <br/>
      The golf bag is carried vertically along the golfer's back centered between the golfer's shoulders.
      <br/>
      A lumbar pad is provided to distribute the weight of the bag to the user's lower back.
      <br/>
      One drawback of this system is that the bag is vertically oriented, which inhibits the golfer's ability to easily remove or insert golf clubs into the golf bag, or access other items stored in the golf bag.
      <br/>
      A golfer may also be inhibited from easily bending forward to, for example, pick up a golf ball, drink from a drinking fountain, or tie shoelaces.
    </p>
    <p num="15">
      What is needed is an apparatus and system for carrying a golf bag which reduces most of the load on the golfer's shoulders and back by transferring the weight of the load to the hips and legs, while maintaining an orientation of the golf bag which permits easy access to the items stored therein.
      <br/>
      The apparatus and system should also permit the golfer to easily remove the bag and its associated components so that the golfer can enjoy a natural golf swing unencumbered by the golf bag carrying apparatus.
    </p>
    <p num="16">It is with the shortcomings of the existing art in mind that the significant improvements and advancements of present invention were developed.</p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="17">
      The hip belt apparatus and system of the present invention has solved the above problems.
      <br/>
      According to one broad aspect of the invention, an apparatus for carrying a weight-bearing object, such as a golf bag, is presented and includes a hip belt member, a belt fastener, and an attachment member.
      <br/>
      The hip belt member is provided for supporting the weight-bearing object about a user's hips, and has a first end and a second end.
      <br/>
      The belt fastener removably connects the first end of the hip belt member to the second end of the hip belt member about the user's waist.
      <br/>
      The attachment member is coupled to the hip belt member for attaching the hip belt member to the weight-bearing object.
      <br/>
      In one embodiment of the invention, the attachment member comprises a first attachment member for coupling the hip belt to the weight-bearing object about a first attachment point, and a second attachment member for coupling the hip belt member to the weight-bearing object about a second attachment point.
      <br/>
      The center of gravity of the weight-bearing object is positioned between the first and second attachment points.
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      According to another broad aspect of the invention, an apparatus for carrying a weight-bearing object, such as a golf bag, is presented and includes a hip belt member for supporting the weight-bearing object about a user's hips.
      <br/>
      The hip belt member has a central portion, a first hip portion, and a second hip portion.
      <br/>
      A first waist strap is coupled to the first hip portion, and a second waist strap is coupled to the second hip portion.
      <br/>
      A belt fastener connects the first waist strap to the second waist strap include a first and second shoulder strap.
      <br/>
      The first shoulder strap has a central portion, a first strap for attachment to the first attachment point, and a second strap member for attachment to the second attachment point.
      <br/>
      The second shoulder strap can have a central portion, a first strap for attachment to the weight-bearing object at a point along the top of the weight-bearing object, and a second strap member for attachment to the second attachment point.
      <br/>
      In this manner, the golf bag will be oriented substantially horizontal so that its contents are readily accessible by the user.
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      Further, the first shoulder strap can be provided with a slot member positioned along the first strap for defining a slot adapted to receive the first strap of the second shoulder strap to prevent tangling of the shoulder straps.
      <br/>
      Another way for preventing the straps from tangling may include threading the two straps through a commercially available clamp-on suspender divider, threading the two straps through a looploc.RTM. member, or sewing the two straps together where they cross.
    </p>
    <p num="20">
      One of the advantages of the present invention is that the load of the golf bag on the golfer's shoulders and back is reduced by transferring most of the load to the golfer's hips and legs.
      <br/>
      At the same time, the golfer's ability to bend over is maintained, while maintaining an orientation of the golf bag that permits easy access to the items stored therein.
      <br/>
      The golf bag is easily removable so that the golfer can enjoy a natural golf swing unencumbered by the golf bag carrying apparatus.

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading>
    <p num="23">
      In accordance with the present invention, a hip belt apparatus and system are presented for carrying a weight-bearing object such as a golf bag.
      <br/>
      The present invention transfers a substantial portion of the load of the weight-bearing object onto the hips of a person through a hip belt member attached to the weight-bearing object.
      <br/>
      By transferring the weight to the person's hips, the load on the person's back and shoulders is reduced for improved comfort and reduced fatigue.
      <br/>
      The hip belt member is adapted to fit snugly about a person's waist and upper portion of their hips to effectively support the weight-bearing object.
      <br/>
      An optional shoulder strap system can be used in conjunction with the hip belt member to allow the bag to be lifted into position and to improve the stability of the system.
    </p>
    <p num="24">
      FIG. 1 shows a hip belt member 20 attached to a weight-bearing object 22, such as a golf bag.
      <br/>
      The hip belt member 20 has a first and second point of attachment 24, 26 to the weight-bearing object, thereby distributing the load of the weight-bearing object to the first attachment point 24 and the second attachment point 26 of the hip belt member.
      <br/>
      The first and second attachment points are respectively coupled to a first and second attachment members, shown in FIG. 2.
    </p>
    <p num="25">
      The first and second attachment points 24, 26 are ideally attached to at least two points on the weight-bearing object 22 so that the weight-bearing object is properly oriented and its center of gravity resides between the first and second attachment points.
      <br/>
      In this manner, the load of the weight-bearing object is positioned between the first and second attachment points and distributed therebetween onto the hips and legs of the user.
    </p>
    <p num="26">
      The hip belt member 20 has a belt fastener 28 to secure the ends of the hip belt member together about the waist and hips of the user.
      <br/>
      In one example, the belt fastener 28 has adjustable ends so that the hip belt member can be snugly positioned about the user's waist.
    </p>
    <p num="27">

      <br/>
      The first and second hip portions are adapted to be positioned about the user's hip (i.e. the lateral parts of the pelvis) to transfer the weight of the weight-bearing object to the hips and the legs of the user.
      <br/>
      The central portion 62 of the hip belt member couples the first hip portion 60 to the second hip portion 64.
      <br/>
      This transfers a portion of the weight to the upper rear part of the pelvis and provides a location at which the first and second attachment members 34, 46 may be secured to the hip belt member.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, the first and second attachment members 34, 46 could be attached to the first and second hip portions 60, 64 to secure the weight bearing object thereto.
    </p>
    <p num="30">
      The hip belt member also has a first waist strap 68 attached to the first hip portion and a second waist strap 70 attached to the second hip portion which secure adjustable male and female ends 72, 74 of the belt fastener.
      <br/>
      A sew attachment or other like method can be used to the connect the first and second waist straps 68, 70 to their respective first and second hip portions 60, 64 of the hip belt member 20.
      <br/>
      The belt fastener, in one embodiment of the invention, is a bayonet-type, side-release snap clasp having an adjustable female end 74 adapted to removably yet securably receive an adjustable male end 72.
      <br/>
      Both the female end and male end are adjustable along their respective waist straps 68, 70 so that persons having different waist sizes can use the hip belt member.
      <br/>
      Different lengths of the hip belt member can also be manufactured to accommodate for different waist sizes within the adjustable dimensions provided by the waist straps 68, 70 with adjustable ends 72, 74.

    <p num="31">
      FIG. 3 illustrates a top view of the hip belt member 20 of the present invention.
      <br/>
      The hip belt member shown in the embodiment of FIG. 3 is a padded material having an interior surface 76 and an exterior surface 78.
      <br/>
      A padding or thickness dimension between 5/8 and 11/2 inch has been found to be desirable and comfortable.
      <br/>
      The waist straps 68, 70 and first and second attachment members 34, 46 are affixed to the exterior surface 78 of the hip belt member so that the interior surface 76 of the hip belt member does not contain any interface surfaces which would uncomfortably contact the user's body.
      <br/>
      As shown in FIG. 3, the first waist strap is attached to the hip belt member through sew or like attachment 80 and the second waist strap is attached through sew or like attachment 82.
      <br/>
      The first attachment member 34 is attached to the hip belt member through the first attachment point 36, while the second attachment member 46 is attached through the second attachment point 48 on the exterior surface.
      <br/>
      For a right-handed golfer, as shown in FIG. 4, the first attachment member 34 is attached to the side of the golf bag near its mouth 84, while the second attachment member 46 is attached to the top center of the golf bag.
      <br/>
      Conversely, for a left-handed golfer, the second attachment member 46 can be attached to the side of the golf bag near its mouth, while the first attachment member 34 can be attached to the top center of the golf bag.
    </p>
    <p num="32">
      FIG. 4 illustrates a person using the hip belt member 20 of the present invention to carry the weight-bearing golf bag 22 with golf clubs therein.
      <br/>
      The hip belt member is secured around the hips of the user with the belt fastener 28 in the closed position.
      <br/>
      As shown in FIG. 4, the shoulder strap 30 of the golf bag can be used to lift the bag into position and to further stabilize the golf bag about the user.
      <br/>
      As can be seen in FIG. 4, the user has easy access to the contents of the golf bag due to the substantially horizontal orientation of the golf bag.
      <br/>
      Further, because the hip belt member 20 has a belt fastener 28, the hip belt member can be easily removed as the user sees fit.
      <br/>
      For instance, if the user was preparing to hit a golf shot, the belt fastener 28 could be disconnected and the hip belt member 20 and shoulder strap 30 could be removed to enable the user to freely move unencumbered by either the hip belt member or the shoulder strap.
    </p>
    <p num="33">Also shown in FIG. 4, the load of the weight-bearing golf bag is now transferred substantially from the user's shoulders and back to the user's hips and legs.</p>
    <p num="34">
      To use the present invention, a user would lift the golf bag and insert an arm into the shoulder strap.
      <br/>
      The hip belt member 20 would then be positioned about the user's waist and the belt fastener 28 would be latched closed.
      <br/>
      The adjustable male and female ends along the waist straps could be adjusted to insure a proper fit of the hip belt member about the user's hips.
      <br/>
      The length of the shoulder strap can be adjusted so that it does not carry a significant amount of the load of the weight-bearing object, but simply acts as a stabilizer, as well as a way to lift the golf bag into position for carrying.
    </p>
    <p num="35">
      Referring to FIGS. 1 and 4, the hip belt member 20 is attached to the side of the golf bag at the center of gravity of the golf bag so that the golf bag will be balanced and properly oriented.
      <br/>
      The hip belt member can be attached to the golf bag by the first and second attachment members (FIG. 2) so that the orientation of the bag is higher at the open end 84 of the golf bag where the clubs are accessible.
      <br/>
      In this manner, any tendency of the golf clubs to fall out of the golf bag will be reduced.
    </p>
    <p num="36">It will be understood that while FIGS. 2 and 3 illustrate two attachment members, the number of attachment members can be varied to accommodate the particular geometry and characteristics of the weight-bearing object to be carried.</p>
    <p num="37">
      A second embodiment of the present invention is shown in FIGS. 5, 6A-6C, and 7, wherein a shoulder support system is used in conjunction with the hip belt member to carry a weight-bearing object such as a golf bag.
      <br/>
      The shoulder support system assists in stabilizing the load of the weight-bearing object particularly during instances when the user is moving the weight-bearing object.
    </p>
    <p num="38">
      Referring to FIG. 5, the hip belt member 100 of the present invention is shown in conjunction with a right shoulder strap 102 and a left shoulder strap 104 which are overlapped and threaded together.
      <br/>
      As with the shoulder strap shown in FIGS. 1 and 4, the right and left shoulder straps of the present invention are adjustable so that most of the load of the golf bag can be transferred to and carried by the hip belt member 100.
      <br/>
      The left and right shoulder straps can be padded where they contact the user's shoulder to improve overall comfort.
    </p>
    <p num="39">
      In the region where the shoulder straps cross, a slot 106 is provided in one of the shoulder straps through which a portion of the other strap securably passes.
      <br/>
      The slot keeps the straps from becoming twisted or entangled and makes it easier for the user to insert their arms within the shoulder straps.
    </p>
    <p num="40">
      In accordance with this embodiment of the present invention, the hip belt member 100 is attached to the weight-bearing object 108 at a first attachment point 110 coupled to the side attachment point 112 near the mouth of the golf bag, and the second attachment point 114 coupled to a central hook 116 of the golf bag.
      <br/>
      Further, one end of the left shoulder strap 104 is attached to the top hook 118 of the golf bag.
      <br/>
      The side attachment point 112 of the golf bag supports the bag and prevents the bag from tipping downward or sideways.
      <br/>
      The side attachment point 112 also provides a point at which the bag can be supported so that the bag is angled upward in its orientation.
      <br/>
      The side attachment point 112 may be integral to the golf bag, or can be added to the golf bag for attachment to the hip belt member.
    </p>
    <p num="41">
      By attaching one end of the left shoulder strap 104 to the top hook 118 of the golf bag, upward lift is provided to support the bag from drooping or sagging away from the user.
      <br/>
      While the top hook attachment point 118 has been shown approximately one quarter of the perimeter of the top portion of the bag away from the side attachment point 112, it is understood that the side attachment point 112 and the top hook attachment point 118 could be located close to one another or opposite of one another along the periphery of the top portion of the golf bag or where needed to keep the bag in balance.
    </p>
    <p num="42">
      FIGS. 6A-6C illustrate the right and left shoulder straps 102, 104 of the shoulder support system in accordance with the present invention to be used in conjunction with the inventive hip belt member.

      FIG. 8A illustrates another embodiment of the present invention wherein the padded hip belt 180 is provided with vent slots 188 to allow air to pass through to improve the user's comfort during hot weather.
      <br/>
      This hip belt 180 is shown with a first hip portion 182, a second hip portion 184, and a central portion 186.
      <br/>
      The belt 180 is shown with molded fabric covered foam pillows 190 and vent slots 188 located between the pillows.
      <br/>
      The belt has the same buckles 72 and 74 and the same straps 34, 40, 46, and 54 as the earlier versions of the belt, for example that shown in FIG.2. In FIG. 8B a longitudinal section view is shown showing the pillows 190, vent slots 188, cover fabric 236, soft molded foam 234 against the users body and denser foam 235 along the back surface to add stiffness to help prevent the belt from curling.
      <br/>
      For the soft molded foam 234, a 1/2 inch thick layer of 2 lb/ft3 polyethylene foam with a terry cloth cover fabric 236 has been found to be effective.
      <br/>
      For the denser foam 235 a 1/4 inch thick layer of 6 lb/ft3 polyethylene foam with a stiff 600D polyester fabric cover has been found to be effective.
    </p>
    <p num="48">
      FIG. 9A illustrates a vented shoulder pad and strap 202 that allows some air to pass through the padded portion 228 while being worn to improve the users comfort during hot weather.
      <br/>
      The padded portion 228 is made of molded fabric covered foam with vent holes or slots 224, open woven mesh 226, ladder lock buckle 232 on one end and strap 222 on the other end with adjustable triloc.RTM. buckle 230.
      <br/>
      A section through the padded portion 228 is shown in FIG. 9B, where soft molded foam 234 has fabric cover 236, vent slots 224 and open mesh 226.
      <br/>
      The open mesh 226, which extends along the length and over the vent slots 224 adds strength to the padded portion 228 while allowing air to freely pass through the slots.
      <br/>
      The open mesh 226 is sewn along its edges 238.
      <br/>
      FIG. 9C illustrates an unfolded section view of the molded foam member 228 shown flattened as it is after manufacturing and before it is folded over the open mesh 226.
      <br/>
      This type of construction is commonly referred to as a clam shell design.
      <br/>
      In FIG. 9C the foam 234 with fabric cover 236 has vent slots 224 formed into it periodically along its length.
      <br/>
      For the soft molded foam 234 a 1/2 inch thick layer of 2 lb/ft3 polyethylene foam with a pique or mouton fabric cover has been found to be effective.
    </p>
    <p num="49">
      Another feature may be added to the invention to increase the user's comfort during hot weather.
      <br/>
      By adding a thin layer or coating of heat storing material 237 to the surfaces of the molded foam pillows 190 and/or fabric 236 of the hip belt 180 and shoulder pads 228 where they contact the user, these surfaces will feel cool to the user.
      <br/>
      When the belt and shoulder pads are not being worn, these surfaces will cool to ambient temperature, particularly if placed in the shade.
      <br/>
      Further, any sweat that has been absorbed by these surfaces will evaporate, when they are not being worn, and further cool the heat storing material to a temperature below ambient.
      <br/>
      Then when the belt and shoulder pads are worn, they will absorb heat and provide cooling to the user.
      <br/>
      A heat storage material 237 such as Isogel.RTM. polyurethane elastomer has a large heat capacity and ability to store sensible heat and may be made in granular form so it may be incorporated into the surface of the foam pillows 190.
      <br/>
      A heat storing material 237, such as a low melting point paraffin that changes phase from solid to liquid when heated, may also be encapsulated in small spheres, for example, and incorporated into the surface of the foam pillows 190.
      <br/>
      Further, a heat storing material may be coated on the fabric 236 where it contacts the user to absorb heat from the user and reject it to the surrounding air.
    </p>
    <p num="50">
      The hip belt may also be made using a clam shell design.
      <br/>
      FIG. 10 illustrates a hip belt of the clam shell design where the hip belt member 240 includes a soft molded foam portion 252 with fabric cover 248.
      <br/>
      Vent holes 242 are formed periodically in the belt between molded foam pillows 244.
      <br/>
      An open mesh 246 extends the length of the belt 240 and covers the vent holes 242 to add strength while allowing air to pass through the holes for ventilation.
      <br/>
      A dense foam backing 254 is added to provide stiffness and strength to the belt 240.
      <br/>
      An optional stiffener backing material 256 may be added to provide increased stiffness, particularly in the areas where the attachments create the greatest stress concentration.
      <br/>
      The belt 240 is sewn along the edges 250 of the mesh 242 to hold the molded foam 252, the mesh 242 the dense foam 254 and the backing material 256 in place.
      <br/>
      It has been found that a 1/2 inch thick layer of 2 lb/ft3 polyethylene foam with terry cloth cover is effective for the soft molded foam 252 with cloth cover 248.
      <br/>
      A nylon mesh with 1/8 inch mesh size has been found to be effective for the woven open mesh 246.
      <br/>
      For the denser foam 254 a 1/4 inch thick layer of 4 to 6 lb/ft3 polyethylene foam has been found to be effective.
      <br/>
      For the stiff backing material 256 a 2 mm thick high density polyethylene material has been found to be effective.

    <p num="51">
      FIG. 11 illustrates an alternate attachment method between the hip belt and the golf bag wherein the hip belt is fitted into a slot or pocket 252 attached to the side of the golf bag 250.
      <br/>
      The advantage of this method of attachment is that the belt may be easily installed by simply sliding it in or out of the slot.
      <br/>
      The hip belt may also have straps and buckles 288 to aid in attaching it to the bag.
      <br/>
      The slot or pocket 252 may be made of fabric sewn to the bag 250 along its top and bottom edges or it may be sewn on just one edge, say the top edge, and the bottom edge may be attached to the bag 250 by buckles, snaps other attachment means.

    <p num="52">
      FIG. 12 illustrates a golf bag that is provided with buckles and hooks for attachment to the hip belt and dual shoulder strap system of the present invention, shown in FIGS. 1, 2, 5 and 7.
      <br/>
      A golf bag 280 with open top 286 is shown with a central hook 282, a top hook 284, and two side attachment buckles 288 and 290.
      <br/>
      The straps of the hip belt shown in FIG. 2, for example, would attach to the bag 280 by attaching strap 34 to buckle 288, strap 40 to buckle 290, and straps 46 and 58 to hook 282.
      <br/>
      By using two buckles 288 and 290 on the bag 280 a more secure and stable attachment is made between the hip belt and the bag which reduces bouncing of the bag while walking.
      <br/>
      The dual shoulder straps may also be attached to the belt and bag as shown in FIG. 7.
    </p>
    <p num="53">
      Using the present invention, the golf bag is carried in an orientation, which is substantially horizontal with the open end of the golf bag angled upwards.
      <br/>
      The golf clubs, golf balls and other accessories are readily accessible to the golfer, and the golfer can easily bend over to pick up golf balls or tees, fix a ball mark on the green, drink from a water fountain, or tie shoelaces, for example.
      <br/>
      Further, since the hip belt member is easily detachable, the golfer can remove the hip belt member, and any associated shoulder straps, from his or her body before each golf shot to enjoy a natural golf swing unencumbered by any golf bag carrying apparatus.
      <br/>
      The hip belt transfers most of the weight of the golf bag to the user's hips, provides back support and serves as a cushion between the bag and the user's back.
    </p>
    <p num="54">While the hip belt member of the present invention and the shoulder support system of the present invention have been shown in conjunction with a golf bag as a weight-bearing object, it is understood that the present invention could be adapted to carry other weight-bearing objects, such as, for example, a musical instrument (i.e., a bass drum or set of drums, a xylophone, an upright tuba), tools (i.e., gas powered leaf blowers, portable vacuums, chain saws), cameras and video equipment including their battery packs, military equipment (i.e., guns, radios), or small children in a suitable infant seat carrier, without departing from the scope of the present invention.</p>
