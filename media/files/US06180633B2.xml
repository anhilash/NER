    <p num="2">
      This invention relates to the field of synthetic organic chemistry.
      <br/>
      Specifically, the invention relates to pharmaceutical compounds that are useful in the field of drug resistance and multidrug resistance.
    </p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="3">
      Among the problems faced in certain types of drug therapy, including cancer chemotherapy and malaria drug regimens.
      <br/>
      The resistance means, for example, that cancerous tumors that have responded well initially to a particular drug or drugs, later develop a tolerance to the drug(s) and cease responding.
      <br/>
      Drug resistance is the name given to the circumstance when a disease (e.g., malaria or cancer, does not respond to a treatment drug or drugs.
      <br/>
      Drug resistance can be either intrinsic, which means the disease has never been responsive to the drug or drugs, or it can be acquired, which means the disease ceases responding to a drug or drugs that the disease had previously been responsive to.
      <br/>
      Multidrug resistance is a specific type of drug resistance that is characterized by cross-resistance of a disease to more than one functionally and/or structurally unrelated drugs.
      <br/>
      Multidrug resistance in the field of cancer, is discussed in greater detail in "Detoxification Mechanisms and Tumor Cell Resistance to Anticancer Drugs," by Kuzmich and Tew, particularly section VII "The Multidrug-Resistant Phenotype (MDR)," Medical Research Reviews, Vol. 11, No. 2, 185-217, (Section VII is at pp. 208-213) (1991); and in "Multidrug Resistance and Chemosensitization: Therapeutic Implications for Cancer Chemotherapy," by Georges, Sharom and Ling, Advances in Pharmacology, Vol. 21, 185-220 (1990).
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      Treatment of drug and multidrug resistance typically involves the coadministration of a drug suitable for treatment of the disease and a compound known as a drug resistance modulator or a multidrug resistance modulator.
      <br/>
      Drug and multidrug resistance modulators act through various mechanisms to cause a drug or drugs suitable for treatment of a disease to begin and/or continue to function as a therapeutic agent.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      One known mechanism by which certain drug and multidrug resistance modulators function is by their interaction with a protein that is variously called Multidrug-Resistance 1 protein (MDR1), Pleiotropic-glycoprotein (P-glycoprotein), Pgp or P170, referred to herein as "P-glycoprotein". P-glycoprotein is endogenous in cell membranes, including certain drug resistant cells, multidrug resistant tumor cells, gastrointestinal tract cells, and the endothelial cells that form the blood brain barrier. P-glycoprotein acts as an efflux pump for the cell.
      <br/>
      Certain substances, undesirably including treatment drugs for various diseases, are pumped out of the cell by the P-glycoprotein prior to their having an effect on the cell.
      <br/>
      Drug and multidrug resistance modulators interact with P-glycoprotein.
      <br/>
      This interaction interferes with the P-glycoprotein "drug efflux pump" action thereby permitting the treatment drug to enter and remain in the cell and have its intended effect.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      In addition to inhibiting the efflux of various drugs from tumor cells, drug and multidrug resistance modulators that interact with P-glycoprotein also function to enhance oral bioavailability of nutrients or drugs, that are affected by the action of P-glycoprotein, through the gastrointestinal tract.
      <br/>
      Oral bioavailability refers to the ability of a drug that is administered orally to be transported across the gastrointestinal tract and enter into the bloodstream.
      <br/>
      A drug or multidrug resistance modulator that interacts with P-glycoprotein should enhance the oral bioavailability of a drug or nutrient by interfering with the efflux pump action of P-glycoprotein.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      P-glycoprotein is believed to be present on both sides of the endothelial cell layer of the capillary tube of the brain.
      <br/>
      It is this capillary tube that functions physiologically as the blood-brain barrier.
      <br/>
      The blood brain barrier is believed to restrict the entry of many different types of compounds, including drugs whose site of action is within the brain, from entering the brain.
      <br/>
      Certain drug and multidrug resistance modulators that interact with P-glycoprotein also can function to enhance bioavailability of a drug to the brain by interacting with P-glycoprotein and thus interfering with the drug efflux pump action of P-glycoprotein on the treatment drug.
      <br/>
      This interference permits more of the treatment drug to cross the blood-brain barrier into the brain and remain there.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      Certain drug or multidrug resistance modulators that interact with P-glycoprotein are known.
      <br/>
      They include: verapamil (a calcium channel blocker that lowers blood pressure and has also been found effective in vitro for treating drug-resistant malaria), certain steroids, trifluoroperazine (a central nervous system agent), vindoline, and reserpine (an  ALPHA -2 blocker with central nervous system properties).
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      U.S. Pat. No. 5,112,817 to Fukazawa et al. discloses certain quinoline derivatives useful for the treatment of multidrug resistance in cancer.
      <br/>
      One of the initially promising active agents, MS-073, was found to be active in in vitro testing.
      <br/>
      However, MS-073 was found to have poor oral bioavailability and to suffer from instability problems in solution.
      <br/>
      Other compounds in the series, such as the biphenylmethylcarbonyl derivative MS-209, have been found to have better stability and oral bioavailability, but require the administration of higher doses to be effective as a multidrug resistance modulator.
    </p>
    <p num="10">PCT Patent Application WO 94/24107 discloses 10,11-cyclopropyldibenzosuberane derivatives which are described as being useful as multidrug resistance modulators.</p>
    <p num="11">
      There remains a need to discover compounds that will interact with P-glycoprotein so that they will act as drug and multidrug resistance modulators to treat drug and multidrug resistance in various diseases.
      <br/>
      Additional compounds that interact with P-glycoprotein are also needed to act to enhance bioavailability of a drug or drugs to the brain and/or to act to enhance oral bioavailability of a drug or drugs.

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="19">The following definitions are set forth to illustrate and define the meaning and scope of the various terms used to describe the invention herein.</p>
    <p num="20">
      The term "alkyl" refers to a fully saturated monovalent radical having the stated number of carbon atoms containing only carbon and hydrogen, and which may be a cyclic, polycyclic, branched or straight chain radical.
      <br/>
      This term is exemplified by radicals containing from 1-6 carbon atoms, such as, but not limited to, methyl, ethyl, propyl, t-butyl, pentyl, neopentyl, hexyl, and cyclohexyl. "Lower alkyl" refers to alkyl radicals of from 1-4 carbon atoms.
    </p>
    <p num="21">The term "acyloxy" refers to the group --O--C(O)--R7 where R7 is C1 -C6 alkyl.</p>
    <p num="22">
      "Polyaryl" refers to monovalent fused ring systems that contain at least two, and at most four fused aromatic rings.
      <br/>
      All the aromatic rings in these systems may optionally be substituted, with the proviso that only one to three of the hydrogens on each ring may be replaced.
    </p>
    <p num="23">
      The term "aromatic" refers to rings containing one or more groups of atoms in a cyclic array that contains clouds of delocalized  PI  electrons above and below the plane of the atoms; furthermore, the  PI  clouds must contain a total of (4q+2)  PI  electrons, where q is any positive integer.
      <br/>
      For purposes of this application "aromatic rings" are defined as unsaturated carbocyclic rings which can optionally be substituted.
      <br/>
      Aromatic rings can contain any number of carbon atoms, as long as they retain their aromatic character and are sterically feasible.
      <br/>
      The preferred ring size is a six carbon ring.
    </p>
    <p num="24">The term "substituted" means one to three hydrogens on the structure have been replaced with one to three moieties independently selected from the group consisting of bromo, chloro, iodo, fluoro, C1 -C6 alkyl, --COOH, amino, cyano, nitro, trifluoromethyl, difluoromethoxy, and hydroxyl groups, with the proviso that any substituted structure must be so configured that it is sterically feasible, affords a stable structure and is capable of reacting as described herein.</p>
    <p num="25">
      Examples of polyaryl ring systems used in the present invention include, but are not limited to, naphthyl, phenanthryl, anthryl, triphenylenyl, and chrysylenyl.
      <br/>
      Representative formulae for some of these polyaryl ring systems include:  (Chemical Structure image '3' not included in text)
    </p>
    <p num="26">The term "carbocyclic" refers to a ring structure which has only carbon atoms in the ring.</p>
    <p num="27">The term "halo" refers to fluoro, bromo, chloro and iodo.</p>
    <p num="28">
      A "Pharmaceutically acceptable salt" may be any non-toxic salt derived from an inorganic or organic acid that is suitable for administration as a drug.
      <br/>
      The salts are derived from inorganic acids, such as hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, sulfuric acid (giving the sulfate and bisulfate as acetic salts), nitric acid, phosphoric acid and the like, and organic acids such as acetic acid, propionic acid, glycolic acid, pyruvic acid, oxalic acid, malic acid, malonic acid, succinic acid, maleic acid, fumaric acid, tartaric acid, citric acid, benzoic acid, cinnamic acid, mandelic acid, methanesulfonic acid, ethanesulfonic acid, salicylic acid, p-toluene-sulfonic acid, hexanoic acid, heptanoic acid, cyclopentanepropionic acid, lactic acid, o-(4-hydroxy-benzoyl)benzoic acid, 1,2-ethanedisulfonic acid, 2-hydroxyethanesulfonic acid, benzenesulfonic acid, p-chlorobenzenesulfonic acid, 2-naphthalenesulfonic acid, camphorsulfonic acid, 4-methylbicyclo�2.2.2�oct-2-ene-1-carboxylic acid, glucoheptonic acid, 4,4'-methylenebis(3-hydroxy-2-naphthoic) acid, 3-phenylpropionic acid, trimethylacetic acid, t-butylacetic acid, laurylsulfuric acid, glucuronic acid, glutamic acid, 3-hydroxy-2-naphthoic acid, stearic acid, muconic acid and the like.
    </p>
    <p num="29">
      A "pharmaceutically acceptable solvate" refers to a form of a compound that has clusters of solvent molecules clinging to the molecules of the compound and which form is suitable for administration as a drug.
      <br/>
      The solvent may be water or any common organic solvent.
    </p>
    <p num="30">The term "bioavailability" refers to the degree and rate at which a drug, or other substance, becomes available to a target tissue within a mammal.</p>
    <p num="31">The term "treatment" or "treating" means administering an appropriate therapeutic or prophylactic amount of a compound to a mammal.</p>
    <p num="32">
      The term "effective amount" means a dosage sufficient to cause a positive change in the disease state being treated.
      <br/>
      The term "positive change" will vary in meaning depending on the patient, the disease and the treatment being undergone.
      <br/>
      For example, an effective amount of an oncolytic can be an amount that causes a reduction in the size of a cancerous tumor, or where no reduction in tumor size occurs, an effective amount of an oncolytic could be that amount that causes a decrease in analgesic consumption for the patient suffering from cancer.
    </p>
    <p num="33">
      The term "coadministering" means a disease treatment drug and a compound of Formula (A), or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or solvate thereof, are given to a mammal.
      <br/>
      The drug and the compound of Formula (A) or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or solvate thereof, are given to a mammal simultaneously or at different times.
    </p>
    <p num="34">
      The term "drug resistance" refers to the circumstance when a disease does not respond to a treatment drug or drugs.
      <br/>
      Drug resistance can be either intrinsic, which means the disease has never been responsive to the drug or drugs, or it can be acquired, which means the disease ceases responding to a drug or drugs that the disease had previously responded to.
    </p>
    <p num="35">
      "Multidrug resistance" means a specific type of drug resistance characterized by cross-resistance of a disease to more than one functionally and/or structurally unrelated drugs.
      <br/>
      Multidrug resistance can be either intrinsic or acquired.
    </p>
    <p num="36">Compounds of the claimed invention are compounds of Formula (A):  (Chemical Structure image '4' not included in text)</p>
    <p num="37">where R1 and R2 are independently hydrogen or halo; A is --CH2 --CH2 --, --CH2 --CHR4 --CH2 --, or --CH2 --CHR5 --CHR6 --CH2 --, where R4 is --H, --OH, or acyloxy; one of R5 and R6 is --H, --OH, or acyloxy and the other is --H; and R3 is a polyaryl; and pharmaceutically acceptable salts and solvates thereof.</p>
    <p num="38">
      The compounds of Formula (A) exist in two isomeric configurations defined by the relationship of the 10,11-cyclopropyl and the 5-piperazinyl substituents on the dibenzosuberane.
      <br/>
      When the 10,11-cyclopropyl and the 5-piperazinyl substituents are both oriented in the same direction vis-a-vis the dibenzosuberane (e.g., both up or both down) the isomeric form is called "syn." When the 10,11-cyclopropyl and the 5-piperazinyl substituents are oriented in opposite directions vis-a-vis the dibenzosuberane (e.g., one up and the other down) the isomeric form is called "anti." In general, the drug/multidrug resistance activity of the compounds of Formula (A) in the "anti" configuration has been found to be far superior to the activity of the compounds of Formula (A) in the "syn" configuration.
    </p>
    <p num="39">
      Certain compounds of Formula (A) will have an asymmetric center within the "A" substituent when R4 is not hydrogen or at whichever one of R5 and R6 is not hydrogen.
      <br/>
      These compounds can exist in two stereochemical forms, called (+) and (-) or called (R)- and (S)-, or as mixtures of the two sterioisomers.
      <br/>
      The (R)- and (S)- designation will be used in this application.
    </p>
    <p num="40">While specific stereoisomers are disclosed and named, the present invention is to be interpreted to include both the "anti" and "syn" configurations, the individual (R)- and (S)- stereoisomers within those configurations, as well as mixtures, racemic and otherwise, thereof.</p>

    <p num="64">
      Compounds are evaluated for their ability to exhibit drug resistance modulation when coadministered with an anti-malarial drug used in the treatment of drug resistant malaria.
      <br/>
      The tests are conducted by placing the drug resistance modulator in the drug resistant malaria species in the presence of an anti-malarial drug.
      <br/>
      The anti-malarial drug is a drug that the drug resistant malaria species is known to be resistant to.
      <br/>
      For example, the malaria species P. lophurae and P. cynumolgi are both resistant to the anti-malarial drug proguanil.

      The test is run twice, once with the drug administered by itself and the second time the drug is administered in the presence of a drug resistance modulator.

      An in vitro test for movement of a compound across the blood-brain barrier is begun by growing a confluent monolayer of either bovine brain endothelial or mouse brain capillary endothelial cells on a porous filter support to form a tight endothelium cell layer.
      <br/>
      The filter support is placed in a vessel containing phosphate buffered saline such that the only way for materials to get from one side of the vessel to another is through the cell layer/porous filter support.
    </p>
    <p num="70">
      A known compound (e.g. mannitol) is placed in the vessel on the serosal side of the cell layer/porous filter.
      <br/>
      Samples are removed from the non-serosal side of the cell layer/porous filter at 15-30 minute intervals over a 3-6 hour time period.
      <br/>
      Standard analytical techniques are used to determine the amount of known compound in the sample.
      <br/>
      This information is used to calculate the base line permeability of the cell layer/porous filter.
    </p>
    <p num="71">
      The drug of interest (e.g., oncolytic or anti-malarial) is then placed on one side of a vessel containing fresh saline and the same type of cell layer/porous filter barrier.

      Samples are removed from the other side at 15-30 minute intervals over a 3-6 hour time period.
      <br/>
      Standard analytical techniques are used to determine the amount of drug of interest in those samples.
      <br/>
      The amount of drug of interest that migrates across the barrier is indicative of the base line permeability of the cell layer/porous filter for that drug.
    </p>
    <p num="72">
      The test is then repeated, only this time the drug of interest and a drug resistance modulator are both placed on one side of a vessel prepared as before.

    <p num="91">
      To a suspension of 48 mg (1.20 mmol) of sodium hydride (60% in mineral oil) in 3 mL of DMF were added 173 mg (1.20 mmol) of 1-naphthol while stirring at 0 (degree)  C. The reaction was allowed to warm to 25 (degree)  C. and stirred an additional 1 hour.
      <br/>
      The reaction was recooled to 0 (degree)  C., and a solution of 260 mg (1.0 mmol) of (S)-(-)-(3-nitrophenylsulfonyl)-glycidol in 1 mL of DMF was added dropwise.
      <br/>
      The reaction was stirred at 0 (degree)  C. for 2 hours, poured into 25 mL of brine and the product extracted into ethyl acetate (5X).
      <br/>
      The combined organic extracts were dried over sodium sulfate and concentrated in vacuo to give 240 mg of the compound of Formula (i) (S) 1-(1-Naphthyloxy)-2,3-epoxypropane, which was used without further purification.
