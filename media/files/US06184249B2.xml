    <heading>TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
    <p num="1">The field of this invention is compounds and their use in the treatment of prostate cancer and hyper-androgenic syndromes including alopecia, hirsutism and acne vulgaris.</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND</heading>
    <p num="2">
      The existence of a number of pathologic syndromes depends on androgen hormones.
      <br/>
      Thus, growth of prostate cancer in early stages is androgen driven and can, at least temporarily, be stopped by androgen deprivation.
      <br/>
      Androgenic alopecia is caused by an unexplained switch from the growth promoting effect of androgens on the hair follicles to hair loss.
      <br/>
      In skin androgen mediated disorders, such as alopecia, acne vulgaris, and hirsutism, excess of the cutaneous androgens were shown to be the major nosological factor.
    </p>
    <p num="3">
      The androgenic hormones can act only via an androgenic receptor (AR), which is a transcription factor, a protein which interacts with a specific region of DNA.
      <br/>
      Thus, the mode of action of testosterone and its much more potent analog, 5-alpha dihydrotestoterone (DHT) depends upon binding to the AR.
      <br/>
      Only then can transcription by RNA polymerase II take place.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      In the treatment of androgenic alopecia, various antiandrogens originally developed for the treatment of prostate cancer were claimed for systemic use, but side effects of chronic therapy with these systemically absorbable substances were of concern.
      <br/>
      In cutaneous afflictions topical anti-androgenic compositions have been tried, but with limited success, possibly because all non-steroidal compounds are resorbed by the skin and elicit systemic effects, which prevents their use in males.
      <br/>
      In the scalp, the precursors to androgens are normally converted into potent androgens, which bind to the AR in the hair follicles and promote hair growth.
      <br/>
      In genetically pre-disposed subjects however androgens at certain age cause hair loss.
      <br/>
      Clearly, a topically active composition capable of cutaneous, but not systemic resorption, and of suppressing or eliminating the AR locally, would be useful in preventing or reversing the incipient hair loss.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      The current state of prostate cancer therapy (CaP), the second most prevalent malignancy in males, is unsatisfactory.
      <br/>
      When detected early, with the tumor strictly confined to the prostate gland, CaP can be often controlled by implantation of radioactive seeds, or by prostatectomy, which often results in incontinence and impotence.
      <br/>
      Locally advanced prostate cancer can often be reasonably controlled when in the pelvis and if encompassed into a single port of an external radiation beam.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      For advanced CaP, the standard treatment is androgen receptor-blockade, usually in combination with LHRH superagonists, which suppresses both adrenal and testicular testosterone.
      <br/>
      The rationale of this approach is that early prostate cancer invariably depends on androgens for growth.
      <br/>
      The activity mechanism of clinically utilized antiandrogens is thought to involve blockade of the AR by binding to it and/or by interference with binding of the AR to the DNA; some agonistic compounds can even promote DNA binding but they do modify the binding domain.
      <br/>
      Thus, cyproterone acetate was found to block about 50% of AR binding to the DNA, while flutamide, bicalutamide or nilutamide, were found to completely block such binding.
      <br/>
      All of these state of the art compositions have nevertheless only limited applicability, as the primary tumor and its metastases eventually become refractory to further anti-androgenic therapy.
      <br/>
      The reason is invariably AR mutation, which can be occasionally found as a genetic deviation, but is usually a result of the AR blockade.
      <br/>
      Even when both suprarenal and testicular androgens are eliminated by chemical castration, LHRH super agonist and/or by surgical castration, the mutated receptor retains the capability to be activated by various steroidal metabolites and even progestins and estrogens.
      <br/>
      A variety of other factors can activate the androgen receptor gene via AR activation, such as insulin-like growth factor, epidermal growth factor, and keratinocyte growth factor and neuroendocrine transmitters, such as serotonin.
      <br/>
      Therefore, blocking the AR is not an ideal treatment and a new approach is needed.
      <br/>
      It has also been shown that as a result of the AR blockade, the AR gene is amplified with the resulting overproduction of the AR.
      <br/>
      In 6 to 24 months the AR mutates and the tumor and metastases became hormone refractory and continue to grow.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      In selecting therapeutic options, a correct decision can only be made if the extent of the disease is known.
      <br/>
      When CaP is confined strictly to the gland, surgery and/or local or external radiation can be curative.
      <br/>
      However, in the case of extracapsular disease, prostatectomy or radiation are not only useless, but noxious, since a high rate of serious side effects, such as impotence, incontinence and chronic inflammation of the adjacent tissues accompanies these interventions.
      <br/>
      Members of the current diagnostic armamentarium comprise digital rectal palpation, serum prostate specific antigen determination and ultrasound, magnetic resonance or x-ray imaging.
      <br/>
      These techniques cannot detect CaP metastases to the lymph nodes and other soft tissues, resulting in clinical understaging of 40 to 60% of the patients.
    </p>
    <p num="8">The prior art of diagnostic localizing agents for CaP teaches specific radioactively labeled antibodies, but widespread use is limited by the complexity of the procedure. 5 ALPHA -dihydrotestosterone labeled with 18 F has been used for PET scanning, a generally inaccessible imaging modality.</p>
    <p num="9">
      There are substantial deficiencies in both therapeutic and diagnostic approaches to the treatment of CaP.
      <br/>
      It is therefore of interest to find compounds which not only block the AR, but also diminish the number of available ARs.
      <br/>
      Another desirable characteristic for topical purposes would be compounds which have low or no systemic resorption.
      <br/>
      Also, the compounds should degrade or be metabolized into components of low or no toxicity and have little or no anti-androgenic activity.
      <br/>
      In addition, radioisotope labeled compounds specific for neoplastic prostate cells would be of importance in order to visualize the pathomorphology of CaP accurately, so that unnecessary and costly surgery and/or radiation is avoided in patients where CaP has progressed beyond the reach of curative surgery or the scope of a single radiation port.
      <br/>
      Other appropriate therapies, such as androgen ablation and/or unspecific chemotherapy, can then be instituted.

    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="12">
      Compositions and their method of use are provided, where the compositions are substituted-phenyl-2-methyl,2-(hydroxy or methyl)-3-heteroatom substituted-propionamide derivatives, having heterolinked perfluoroacyl or haloaryl substituents or being bis-derivatives, where the substituent group may be linked to the heteroatom directly or by a linking group.
      <br/>
      The compounds are active anti-androgenic compounds and find use in the treatment of neoplasms and alopecia dependent on androgen hormones.
      <br/>
      In addition, the compounds may be radioisotope labeled for use in therapy and/or diagnosis.
    </p>
    <heading>DESCRIPTION OF THE SPECIFIC EMBODIMENTS</heading>
    <p num="13">
      Compositions are provided, characterized by having an aniline group which has at least one substituent at the para position, desirably a second substituent at the meta position, and to which the aniline nitrogen is bonded a 2-methyl,2-(hydroxy or methyl)-3-heteroatom substituted-propionyl or N-substituted cabamoyl, particularly thiocarbamoyl.
      <br/>
      The heteroatom (including the nitrogen of the carbamoyl group) is linked through a bond or linking group to a perfluoroacyl, haloaryl, or alkyl substituent or to a divalent linking group to form a bis-compound.
      <br/>
      The compounds have individual or collective characteristics associated with cellular toxicity, diminution of androgen receptors on the surface of cells and low systemic resorption when administered topically.

    <p num="15">
      The two position of the propionamide has two methyl groups or one methyl and one hydroxy group.
      <br/>
      The perfluoroacyl group will be linked to the 3-heteropropionamide through the heteroatom by a bond or a linking group of from 1 to 10, usually 2 to 8 carbon atoms and from 0 to 6, usually 0 to 4, more usually 0 to 2 heteroatoms in the chain of the linking group.

      The subject compounds can be prepared in accordance with conventional ways, varying the particular procedure based on the particular side groups.
      <br/>
      The preparation of hydantoins conveniently involves the use of an isocyanate and a substituted  ALPHA -aminoacetonitrile.
      <br/>
      By appropriate choice of the isocyanate and the  ALPHA -aminoacetonitrile, one may arrive at the final product in a single step.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, one may employ various protective groups, which may be subsequently removed or provide for substituents which become involved in the formation of the hydantoin or may provide for sites for further derivatization.
      <br/>
      Various procedures are described in EPO Publication nos. 0 494 819 and 0 580 459.
      <br/>
      The urea compounds may be prepared using an isocyanate (including thioisocyanate) and an amino compound.
      <br/>
      A significant number of examples are provided for the hydantoins and the propionyl moiety compounds in the experimental section of this application.
    </p>
    <p num="29">
      The subject compounds can be used as antiandrogens, substituting for known antiandrogens in the treatment of proliferative diseases, hirsutisim, acne and androgenetic alopecia.
      <br/>
      The subject compounds display one or more of the following properties: specific binding and high affinity to the androgen receptor; destroying or suppressing the presence of the androgen receptor in a concentration dependent fashion; low or no systemic resorption when applied topically; and limited stability, degrading into components of low toxicity and no androgenic activity.
      <br/>
      The subject compounds may be used individually or in combination and with other antiandrogens or other treatments, such as flutamide, bicalutamide and nilutamide, irradiation, heat, or the like, as may be conventionally employed and as may be moderated for use in conjunction with the subject compounds.
      <br/>
      The treatments may be performed concurrently, consecutively or in accordance with a predetermined regimen to minimize the likelihood of neoplastic cell refractoriness.
    </p>
    <p num="30">
      The subject compounds are found to have high cytostatic and cytotoxic activity, inhibiting cell growth and viability of cells having an androgen receptor.
      <br/>
      They also have substantially greater effect against neoplastic cells, as compared to normal cells.
    </p>
    <p num="31">
      Therapeutic compositions can be formulated in accordance with conventional ways and the indication to be treated.
      <br/>
      The composition may be formulated for oral or parenteral, e.g. intravascular, subcutaneous, intratumoral, intraperitoneally, etc., administration, as a pill, powder, capsule, aqueous or oily solution or dispersion, or the like.
      <br/>
      Conventional carriers include saline, phosphate buffered saline, water, vegetable oils, ethanol, isopropanol, etc.
      <br/>
      Excipients, buffers, stabilizers, flavorings or the like may be employed.
      <br/>
      The concentration may be from about 0.1 to 10 weight % and at a dosage in the range of about 0.10 mg to about 5 g, usually not more than about 2 g/dose.
      <br/>
      One or more doses may be given daily.
    </p>
    <p num="32">
      The subject compounds may be used in conjunction with conventional therapeutic agents for a specified treatment, being used in combination with anti-neoplastic agents, agents for the treatment of alopecia, etc.
      <br/>
      Of particular interest is to employ a regimen where the subject compound is used with an agent for treating alopecia, such as Minoxidil.RTM. or Aminexil.RTM. (a trademark of L'Oreal), where the dosage employed for the known agent may be the same as in the absence of the subject compound or may be reduced based on the observed experience with the combination.
      <br/>
      Determining the optimum dosage for the combination can be done in conventional ways using appropriate clinical studies and varying ratios of the two ingredients, which may be in a common formulation or employed as two independent formulations.
    </p>
    <p num="33">
      The subject compounds may be used in competitive assays or as controls for evaluating other compounds as to their cytostatic or cytotoxic effect or for blocking the androgen receptor.
      <br/>
      Thus, specific cell lines may be employed where the effect of an agent on the activity of a subject compound may be determined in relation to the survival rate or other indicia of the target cells.
      <br/>
      Also, in mixtures of cells containing neoplastic androgenic receptor containing cells, the subject compounds can be used to eliminate the neoplastic cells in the presence of normal cells.
      <br/>
      Thus, in a variety of cultures, where androgenic receptor containing cells may be susceptible to becoming or are tumorous, by maintaining a cytotoxic level of a subject compound in the medium, cells may be selectively killed.
    </p>
    <p num="34">
      In addition, the radiolabeled compounds may be used for therapeutic and/or diagnostic purposes, depending upon the choice of radiolabel.
      <br/>
      The radiolabeled compounds may be formulated in accordance with conventional ways using physiologically acceptable components, exemplified by various liquid dispersants, such as deionized water, PBS, DMSO, ethanol, etc. in conjunction with various additives, e.g. non-ionic detergents, dextrose, stabilizers, antibiotics, etc.
      <br/>
      Normally, the radioactive label will be provided immediately prior to use, so that the radioactive product will be prepared at the site or be shipped to the site of the injection.
      <br/>
      The formulation will normally be administered by intravenous injection.

      It can be seen that not all compounds which showed strong inhibition of LNCaP cells, by XXT assay, were also active in suppressing the AR.

      Unlike the control antiandrogens, i.e. hydroxyflutamide and bicalutamide, compounds BP-521, BP-673, BP-668, BP-713 and BP-735 practically eliminated the AR at 10  MU M concentration.

      The peak serum levels in the oral test was 0.0052% of the injected dose, as compared to the 0.03% reported for bicalutamide (Cockshott ID, et al.

      When male rats were given 10 times subcutaneously 100 mg/kg of BP-521, the average weight of their prostate and seminal vesicles was reduced by about 46%.
      <br/>
      On the other hand, 0.1 mg/kg dose of BP-521 or BP-668 in castrated rats supplemented with testosterone propionate did not reduce the secondary sex organs' weight, while 0.5mg/kg of bicalutamide did, by about 20%. (The dose of 0.1 mg/kg approximates the expected topical daily dose for humans).

      BP-521, 200 mg/kg bw was given 5 times, without mortality or morbidity, while morbidity but no mortality was seen at 350 mg/kg bw.
      <br/>
      For BP-34, the corresponding values were 150 mg/kg bw and 300 mg/kg bw.

    <p num="178">In an orientational test on five male volunteers, 1% solution of BP-521 in isopropanol, 0.5 mL applied twice daily on the affected scalp, effectively arrested incipient hair loss of the forehead line and after 8 weeks, induced copious growth of vellus hair.</p>

      BP-521, due to the low systemic toxicity, lack of absorption from skin and degradability, is suitable for treatment of skin disorder.

      The resulting decomposition products have no antiandrogenic activity, and the other decomposition product and perfluorobutyric acid, was shown to have low toxicity (Takagi A, et al.

      They were formulated in ethanol, DMSO, Tween and dextrose in water and injected intravenously into male nude mice bearing a human prostate cancer tumor.
      <br/>
      After 4 h the mice were sacrificed and iodine determined in blood, prostate, kidney, liver and the tumor relative.

      There was substantial iodine accumulation in the prostate and the tumor vis-a-vis the other tissues.
