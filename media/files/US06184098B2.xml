      Field of the Invention
    </p>
    <p num="3">
      The present invention relates to an insulating gate type field effect transistor (hereinafter referred to as "MOS transistor" but the gate insulating layer thereof is not limited to an oxide layer) and a method of manufacturing the same.
      <br/>
      More particularly, this invention relates to a MOS transistor of a silicon semiconductor having a silicon gate electrode layer and a method of manufacturing the same.
    </p>
    <p num="4">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
    <p num="5">As a metal electrode or a metal interconnection (referred to as "metal electrode" in this specification) in a semiconductor integrated circuit or a single semiconductor element, a metal electrode made of aluminum (Al) has been widely used from a standpoint of workability, electrical conductivity, etc. of the aluminum.</p>
    <p num="6">
      FIG. 1 of the accompanying drawings shows, in cross-sectional form, an example of a conventional MOS transistor of silicon (Si) semiconductor, such as an MOS transistor of a lightly-doped drain type (LDD type) Si semiconductor in which the gate side in the drain thereof is lightly doped.
      <br/>
      In such an MOS transistor of LDD type Si semiconductor, as shown in FIG. 1, a gate electrode layer 3 made of polycrystalline silicon is formed on a silicon semiconductor portion 1 formed of a silicon semiconductor layer or a silicon semiconductor substrate, for example, through a gate insulating layer 2 made of SiO2.
      <br/>
      Then, lightly-doped source and drain portions 4S1 and 4D1 are formed by implanting ions or the like, by employing the gate electrode layer 3 and the gate insulating layer 2 as a mask.
      <br/>
      Thereafter, a side wall 5 of SiO2 is formed on the side surfaces of the gate electrode layer 3 and the gate insulating layer 2 at their lightly-doped source and drain portion 4S1 and 4D1 sides.
      <br/>
      Heavily-doped source and drain portions 4S2 and 4D2 are formed, for example, by implanting ions by using the side wall 5, the gate electrode layer 3 and the gate insulating layer 2 as a mask, thereby a source 4S and a drain 4D being formed, respectively.
    </p>
    <p num="7">Reference numeral 6 depicts an isolating and insulating layer formed on the surface of the silicon semiconductor portion 1 by local oxidation of silicon (LOCOS).</p>
    <p num="8">
      In the aforementioned structure, the upper surface of the resulting structure is covered with an insulating layer 8 of SiO2.
      <br/>
      Through electrode windows bored through the insulating layer 8, a source metal electrode 7S, a drain metal electrode 7D and a gate electrode 7G are formed so as to be ohmically connected to the source 4S, the drain 4D and the gate electrode layer 3 of polycrystalline Si, respectively.
    </p>
    <p num="9">When an aluminum layer is used to form the source, drain and gate electrodes 7S, 7D and 7G, there is the problem that the aluminum penetrates into the p-n junctions in the source and drain.</p>
    <p num="10">
      Particularly, since the depth xj of each of the junctions decreases with the recent advance of scale-reduction of MOS transistor, the aluminum tends to much more penetrate into the junctions.
      <br/>
      A metal electrode made of aluminum generally employs a multilayer structure in which the Al electrode layer is formed on a separating layer 11, for example, formed by a Ti layer 9 and a TiON layer 10, for separating the aluminum from the silicon.
    </p>
    <p num="11">In the case that such a separating layer is provided, however, the resistance of the contact portions of the electrodes is increased if the thickness of the separating layer is increased so as to positively avoid the penetration of the aluminum.</p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="12">In view of the aforesaid aspect, it is an object of the present invention to provide a contact electrode or an insulating gate type field effect transistor and a method of manufacturing the same in which aluminum is prevented from penetrating into a p-n junction when the metal layer containing the aluminum is used as the electrodes for a transistor.</p>
    <p num="13">It is another object of the present invention to provide a contact electrode or an insulating gate type field effect transistor and a method of manufacturing the same in which contact resistance and sheet resistance at contact portions of a metal electrode that is used as an electrode or a contact for a transistor are decreased.</p>
    <p num="14">According to an aspect of the present invention, in order to achieve the above objects, a contact electrode is comprised of a semiconductor substrate, a diffusion region formed in the semiconductor substrate and having an impurity density larger than that of the semiconductor substrate, an Si1-x Gex layer formed on the diffusion region where x is an arbitrary value between 0 and 1, and a deriving metal layer formed on the Si1-x Gex layer for deriving an electrode.</p>
    <p num="15">Preferably, a high melting-point metal layer or a high melting-point metallocompound layer is formed between the Si1-x Gex layer and the electrode deriving metal layer.</p>
    <p num="16">Preferably, the electrode deriving metal layer is formed of aluminum.</p>
    <p num="17">Preferably, the electrode deriving metal layer is formed of aluminum containing Si or Cu.</p>
    <p num="18">Preferably, the high melting-point metal layer or the high-melting point metallocompound layer is made of one material selected from the group consisting of Ti, TiN and TiON.</p>
    <p num="19">According to another aspect of the present invention, in an insulating gate type field effect transistor having metal electrodes ohmically connected to source and drain portions composed at least of a silicon semiconductor, the metal electrodes are ohmically connected to the source and drain portions through an Si1-x Gex layer, respectively.</p>
    <p num="20">Preferably, the metal electrode contains at least aluminum.</p>
    <p num="21">Preferably, a gate electrode is constituted by a polysilicon layer or a polysilicon layer containing a high melting-point metal, an Si1-x Gex layer, and an Al metal layer.</p>
    <p num="22">Preferably, a gate electrode is constituted by a polysilicon layer, an Si1-x Gex layer, a Ti-TiON layer or a Ti-TiN layer, and an Al layer containing Si.</p>
    <p num="23">According to a further aspect of the present invention, in a method of manufacturing an insulating gate type field effect transistor in which a metal electrode is ohmically connected to source and drain portions composed of at least a silicon semiconductor, the method is comprised of the steps of coating an oxide insulating layer having formed with openings at portions on the source and drain portions where the metal electrodes are to be ohmically connected epitaxially growing an Si1-x Gex layer selectively on at least the source and drain portions exposed to the outside through the openings of the oxide insulating layer by vapor growth epitaxy process, respectively, and depositing a metal electrode on the Si1-x Gex layer in an ohmic contact fashion.</p>
    <p num="24">Preferably, the metal electrode is a metal which contains at least aluminum.</p>
    <p num="25">
      According to the present invention, an Si1-x Gex layer is formed before an electrode for a silicon semiconductor is formed and then the electrode is formed on the Si1-x Gex layer.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, even in the case that the metal electrode is formed of aluminum, the aluminum is prevented from penetrating into junctions in the source and drain portions due to the presence of the Si1-x Gex layer.
    </p>
    <p num="26">
      In the manufacturing method according to the present invention, the Si1-x Gex layer is epitaxially grown selectively on the silicon layer by vapor growth epitaxy so that the Si1-x Gex layer can be securely formed through an opening of the oxide insulating layer only in a portion where the electrode is to be formed.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, the Si1-x Gex layer thus formed is of low resistance.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, since the metal electrode can be led out with low resistance, series resistance of the MOS transistor can be reduced, the aluminum can be prevented from penetrating into the junctions, and increase of resistance can be avoided when the depth of the junctions is shallow, whereby reliability of the transistors can be improved.

    <heading>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading>
    <p num="27">
      FIG. 1 is a cross-sectional view of a main portion of an insulating gate type field effect transistor according to the related art; and
      <br/>
      FIGS. 2A to 2E are cross-sectional views showing an insulating gate type field effect transistor according to an embodiment of the present invention and to which reference will be made in explaining processes of a method of manufacturing the same, respectively.
    </p>
    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading>
    <p num="28">A contact electrode, an insulating gate type field effect transistor and a method of manufacturing the same according to an embodiment of the present invention will be described below with reference to FIGS. 2A to 2E, in which case, the present invention is applied to an LDD type MOS transistor.</p>
    <p num="29">As shown in FIG. 2A, a semiconductor portion 1 is formed of a first conductivity type (e.g., n-type or p-type) lightly-doped silicon semiconductor layer or substrate.</p>
    <p num="30">An isolating and insulating layer 6 of SiO2 or the like is formed on the semiconductor portion 1 by LOCUS, for example, by using a resist mask formed at the surface of the semiconductor portion 1 except for portions where elements are to be formed.</p>
    <p num="31">
      Then, after the surface of the LOCUS and the surfaces of the portions where elements are to be formed are etched away, a thin oxide film 2, for example, of SiO2 is newly formed on the etched away portion with high quality.
      <br/>
      This film 2 is used as a gate oxide film for an MOSFET.
    </p>
    <p num="32">A polycrystalline polysilicon layer is epitaxially grown on the gate oxide film 2 by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) or the like and patterned to thereby form a gate electrode 3.</p>
    <p num="33">Then, as shown in FIG. 2B, second conductivity type (e.g., p-type or n-type) low-density source and drain regions 4S1 and 4D1 are formed by ion implantation by using the gate electrode layer 3 as a mask.</p>
    <p num="34">
      Then, an insulating film, for example, of SiO2 is epitaxially grown on the LOCUS 6, the gate insulating oxide film 2 and the gate electrode layer 3 by CVD.
      <br/>
      Thereafter, the insulating film is etched away by RIE (reaction ion etching) to the extent that an upper surface of the gate electrode 3 and surfaces of the source and drain regions are exposed.
      <br/>
      As a result, a side wall 5 is formed on the sides of the gate electrode layer 3.
    </p>
    <p num="35">
      Referring to FIG. 2C, heavily-doped source and drain regions 4S2 and 4D2 of the same conductivity type as that of the lightly-doped source and drain regions 4S1 and 4D1, i.e., the second conductivity type are formed, for example, by ion implantation by using the side wall 5, the gate electrode layer 3 and the gate insulating layer 2 as a mask.
      <br/>
      Thus, a source 4S and a drain 4D are formed that have the lightly-doped source and drain regions 4S1 and 4D1 on the gate portion sides, respectively, and have p-n junctions, respectively, formed relative to the semiconductor portion 1.
    </p>
    <p num="36">
      In particular, according to the present invention, an Si1-x Gex layer is selectively and epitaxially grown at low temperature by vapor growth epitaxy.
      <br/>
      By such expitaxial growth, an Si1-x Gex layer 21 can be formed selectively only on the silicon exposed to the outside.
      <br/>
      By way of example, this selective low-temperature vapor growth epitaxy of Si1-x Gex is carried out by supplying raw-material gas such as SiH4 and GeH4 to the silicon surface at a growth temperature of 550 (degree)  C. This growth process may be performed by employing a well-known method described in Extended Abstracts of the 1993 International Conference on Solid State Devices and Materials, Makuhari, 1993, pp. 380-382, for example.
    </p>
    <p num="37">The Si1-x Gex layer may be selected so that the thickness thereof falls in a range of about 50 to 3000 Angstrom  and that the value of x is an arbitrary value between 0 and 1, preferably, in a range of about 0.01  &lt;=  *  &lt;= 0.85.</p>
    <p num="38">It is preferable that, before the deposition of the Si1-x Gex layer 21, an oxide film formed by natural oxidation on the silicon surface, where the Si1-x Gex is to be deposited selectively, is removed, for example, by heat treatment in an atmosphere Of H2 at 750 (degree)  C. Alternatively, H2 may be contained in the gas supplied for the CVD process of the Si1-x Gex layer 21 or H2 may be supplied before the CVD process of the Si1-x Gex layer 21.</p>
    <p num="39">
      Further, in the selective CVD process of the Si1-x Gex layer 21, impurity gas forming the same conductivity type as that of the source and drain 4S and 4D may be mixed in the raw-material gas thereof.
      <br/>
      That is, for example, B2 H6 or the like may be mixed in the raw-material gas when the conductivity type of the source and drain 4S and 4D is the n-type, or ASH3 or the like may be mixed in the raw-material gas when the conductivity type of the source and drain 4S and 4D is the p-type.
      <br/>
      As a result, the Si1-x Gex layer 21 may be formed as an Si1-x Gex layer in which boron B or arsenic As is doped.
      <br/>
      When an integrated circuit device including two conductivity type transistors, i.e., n-type and p-type transistors such as a complementary MOS (C-MOS) structure is to be formed on the same substrate, however, the Si1-x Gex layer 21 containing no impurity is formed by selective CVD) and then the Si1-x Gex layer 21 is doped with a predetermined conductivity type impurity such as B and As by ion implantation or the like.
    </p>
    <p num="40">
      Thereafter, as shown in FIG. 2D, an insulating layer 8 Of SiO2, for example, is formed on the whole surface of the resulting structure by CVD.
      <br/>
      Then, electrode windows 8WG, 8WS and 8WD are photolithographically formed through portions of the insulating layer where metal electrodes are to be formed on the gate electrode layer 3 of Si and on the source and drain regions 4S and 4D, respectively.
    </p>
    <p num="41">
      Then, as shown in FIG. 2E, gate, source and drain metal electrodes 7G, 7S and 7D are formed by deposition of, for example, aluminum containing Si in a range of 1% to 2% or aluminum containing Cu of 1% through the electrode windows 8WG, 8WS and 8WD, respectively.
      <br/>
      These gate, source and drain metal electrodes 7G, 7S and 7D can be formed simultaneously in a manner that the aluminum layer is formed on the whole surface inclusive of the electrode windows 8WG, 8WS and 8WD by sputtering or the like and then the aluminum layer is patterned by photolithography.
    </p>
    <p num="42">
      In this case, the metal electrodes 7G, 7S and 7D each formed of aluminum may be deposited directly on the Si1-x Gex layer 21.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, however, in order to prevent the aforementioned penetration of Al more reliably, as shown in FIG. 2E, a separating layer 11 may be formed on the Si1-x Gex layer 21 by sequentially forming a Ti layer 9 and a TiON layer (or TiN layer) 10 on the layer 9 by sputtering or the like.
      <br/>
      Then, the aforementioned metal electrodes 7G, 7S and 7D of Al can be formed on the separating layers 11, respectively.
    </p>
    <p num="43">As described above, according to the present invention, since the MOS transistor is arranged so that the metal electrodes containing aluminum is formed on the target silicon through the Si1-x Gex layer 21, the Si1-x Gex layer 21 can prevent the aluminum from penetrating into the silicon, i.e., the p-n junctions in the source and drain.</p>
    <p num="44">Further, the sheet resistivity of the Si1-x Gex layer 21 in this case exhibits a low value of about 50  OMEGA /.quadrature. when the impurity density, thickness and Ge content x thereof are 1020 atoms/cm3, 100 nm and 0.85, respectively, whereby resistance in each of electrode deriving portions can be reduced.</p>
    <p num="45">
      While the present invention is applied to the LDD type MOS transistors as described above, the present invention is not limited thereto.
      <br/>
      Further, the present invention may be applied to various structures, such as MOS transistors in integrated circuits including C-MOS transistors of different conductivity types.
    </p>
    <p num="46">
      While the metal electrodes are formed so as to ohmically contact with the source and the drain that have been formed in advance as described above, the present invention is not limited thereto.
      <br/>
      That is, impurities may be diffused into the semiconductor portion 1 through the Si1-x Gex layer doped with impurities to thereby form the source and the drain, so that the contact portions and the source and drain can be self-aligned.
    </p>
    <p num="47">
      According to the present invention, the Si1-x Gex layer is formed before the electrodes for the silicon semiconductor are formed, and then the metal electrodes are formed on the Si1-x Gex layer.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, even when each of the metal electrodes is formed of aluminum, the aluminum can reliably be prevented from penetrating into the junctions in the source and drain due to the presence of the Si1-x Gex layer.
    </p>
    <p num="48">Accordingly, a desired transistor with high reliability can be formed.</p>
    <p num="49">
      Further, since the penetration of the aluminum can reliably be avoided as described above, the source and drain can be formed as more shallow junctions.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, the scale of the transistor can be further reduced, and integrated circuits can be made higher in density.
    </p>
    <p num="50">
      According to the manufacturing method of the present invention, since the S1-x Gex layer is formed by selective vapor growth onto the silicon, the S1-x Gex layer can reliably be formed only in portions where the electrodes are to be formed that are exposed through openings of the oxide insulating layer.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, since the S1-x Gex layer thus formed is of low resistance, metal electrodes can be derived with low resistance, so that series resistance of the MOS transistor can be reduced.
    </p>
    <p num="51">
      While the present invention is applied to the MOSFET by way of example, it is apparent from FIGS. 2A through 2E that the present invention can also be applied to the deriving of various semiconductor electrodes.
      <br/>
      That is, the present invention may be applied, for example, to IC processes in which an aluminum layer is used generally as interconnection layers or to the deriving of both electrodes of a diffusion resistor.
      <br/>
      Further, the present invention may be applied to leading-out of an electrode from a semiconductor layer equivalent to one electrode plate of an MIS capacitor or to the deriving of emitter and collector electrodes from a bipolar transistor and so on.
    </p>
    <p num="52">Having described a preferred embodiment of the present invention with reference to the accompanying drawings, it is to be understood that the invention is not limited to that precise embodiment and that various changes and modifications could be effected therein by one skilled in the art without departing from the spirit or scope of the invention as defined in the appended claims.</p>
