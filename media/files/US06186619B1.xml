      A drop-on-demand ink-jet printing head provided with an array of a plurality of piezoelectric elements arranged at regular intervals and fixed at their one ends to a base, the other ends of the respective piezoelectric elements being free ends which are disposed in opposition to nozzle respective apertures, the piezoelectric elements being formed by cutting, at predetermined width, a piezoelectric plate obtained by firing a lamination of paste-like piezoelectric material conductive material stacked alternately in layers.
      <br/>
      Since each piezoelectric element is composed of a thin piezoelectric plate interposed between electrodes, if a voltage of only about 30 V, which is sufficient to drive the thin piezoelectric plate, is applied across the electrodes, it is possible to largely flex the whole of the piezoelectric element.
      <br/>
      By this transformation, ink between the top end of the piezoelectric element and the nozzle aperture is discharged to the outside as an ink drop.
      <br/>
      Because the driving voltage required for forming an ink drop is as low as possible, it is possible to simplify a driving circuit, and because of cutting a piezoelectric plate, it is possible to form small-sized piezoelectric elements with the same accuracy as in a process of producing a semiconductor.

    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">The present invention relates to a drop-on-demand ink-jet printing head for jetting ink, in the form of small droplets, from an ink reservoir so as to form printed dots on recording paper.</p>
    <p num="3">
      Drop-on-demand ink-jet printing head can be classified into three main types.
      <br/>
      The first type is a so-called bubble jet type in which a heater for instantaneously vaporizing ink is provided on the top end of a nozzle to thereby produce and jet an ink drop by expansion pressure created during vaporization.
      <br/>
      In the second type, a piezoelectric element provided in a vessel constituting an ink reservoir flexes or expands in accordance with an electrical signal applied thereto so as to jet ink in the form of a drop by a force produced when the element expands.
      <br/>
      In the third type, a piezoelectric element is provided in an ink reservoir in opposition to a nozzle so as to jet an ink drop by dynamic pressure produced in a nozzle area upon expansion of the piezoelectric element.
    </p>
    <p num="4">As disclosed in Japanese Patent Publication No. Sho-60-8953, the above-mentioned third type drop-on-demand ink-jet printing head has a configuration wherein a plurality of nozzle apertures are formed in a wall of a vessel constituting an ink tank, and piezoelectric elements are disposed at the respective nozzle apertures matched in the direction of their expansion and contraction with each other.</p>
    <p num="5">In this printing head, a printing signal is applied to the piezoelectric elements so as to selectively actuate the piezoelectric elements to jet ink drops from the corresponding nozzles by the dynamic force produced when the piezoelectric elements are actuated to thereby form dots on printing paper.</p>
    <p num="6">
      In such a printing head, it is desirable that the efficiency in ink drop formation and the force of ink drop jetting are large.
      <br/>
      However, since the unit length of a piezoelectric element and the rate of expansion/contraction of the same per unit voltage are extremely small, it is necessary to apply a high voltage to in order to obtain sufficient jetting force for printing, and it is therefore necessary to construct a driving circuit and electric insulators so as to withstand such a high voltage.
    </p>
    <p num="7">In order to obtain a high jetting force, European Patent Unexamined Publication No. 372521 discloses a drop-on-demand ink-jet printing head in which a piezoelectric plate is fixedly attached to an elastic metal plate and is cut and divided corresponding to the arrangement of nozzle apertures, with one end of the piezoelectric plate being fixed to a frame while the other end thereof opposite to the nozzle apertures is a free end.</p>
    <p num="8">
      In this printing head, a driving signal is applied to the piezoelectric plate to thereby bend the elastic metal plate to store energy.
      <br/>
      In this state, the application of the driving signal is stopped to thereby release the elastic force stored in the elastic metal plate so that dynamic pressure is applied to ink, creating a repulsion force to thereby discharge the ink in the form of ink drops to the outside through the nozzle apertures.
    </p>
    <p num="9">However, there is a problem in that a high voltage has to be applied to the piezoelectric plate to bend the elastic metal plate to such an extent as to form ink drops.</p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="10">It is an object of the present invention to solve the foregoing problems of the prior art.</p>
    <p num="11">It is another object of the present invention to provide a drop-on-demand ink-jet printing head with which ink drops can be produced at a low voltage and with a high energy efficiency.</p>
    <p num="12">In order to attain the foregoing objects, according to the present invention, a drop-on-demand ink-jet printing head is provided which comprises: an array of a plurality of piezoelectric elements arranged at regular intervals and fixed at their one ends to a base, the other ends of the respective piezoelectric elements being free ends which are disposed in opposition to respective nozzle apertures, the piezoelectric elements being formed by cutting, at predetermined width, a piezoelectric plate obtained by firing a lamination of paste25 like piezoelectric material conductive material stacked alternately in layers; and ink reservoir portions formed between the nozzle apertures and the free ends of the piezoelectric elements.</p>
    <p num="13">
      In the printing head constructed according to the present invention, a piezoelectric plate is formed by firing a lamination of paste-like piezoelectric material and conductive material stacked alternately in layers and is cut at predetermined widths into pieces to thereby constitute the array of piezoelectric elements.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, even if a low voltage is selectively applied to the piezoelectric material layers constituting the respective piezoelectric elements to thereby drive the layers, the sum of the respective force components acts on ink, so that it is possible to produce enough dynamic pressure to jet the ink as ink drops through the corresponding nozzle apertures.
      <br/>
      Since the array of piezoelectric elements can be formed by cutting into strips the piezoelectric plate fixed to a base or the like, extremely small vibration elements can be produced with high working accuracy and with high efficiency.

    <heading>DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
    <p num="15">
      FIGS. 1 and 2 depict a drop-on-demand ink-jet printing head of a first type according to the present invention.
      <br/>
      In the drawings, a base 2 has sidewise extended projection portions 2a and 2a at its one end portion, that is, at its lower portion in the drawings, so that piezoelectric vibrators 12 and 12' (which will be described later) are fixed to the projection portions 2a and 2a.
    </p>
    <p num="16">
      On the upper surface of the base 2 is fixed a vibration plate 4 for separating an ink reservoir and the piezoelectric vibrators 12.
      <br/>
      Concave portions 4a and 4a are formed in the vibration plate 4 in the vicinity of portions where the vibration plate 4 contacts the piezoelectric vibrators 12 so that the vibration plate 4 can respond easily to the vibration of the piezoelectric vibrators 12.
    </p>
    <p num="17">
      A spacer member 6, which acts also as a channel constituent member, is fixed to the surface of the vibration plate 4.
      <br/>
      In the spacer member 6, recess portions 6a constituting ink reservoirs in cooperation with the vibration plate 4 are provided in the areas opposite to the piezoelectric vibrators 12.
      <br/>
      In a nozzle plate 8 (which will be described later) recess portions 6b constituting ink supply channels are formed so that the recess portions 6a constituting the ink reservoirs, nozzle apertures and the recess portions 6b constituting the ink supply channels communicate with each other through respective penetration holes 6c and 6d.
      <br/>
      The nozzle plate 8 is fixed to the surface of the spacer member 6, and in the nozzle plate 8, a plurality of nozzle apertures 10 and 10' are formed so as to accord with the arrangement of the piezoelectric vibrators 12 and 12'. The respective openings of the recess portions 6b formed in the spacer member 6 are sealed by the nozzle plate 8 so as to form the ink supply channels.
    </p>
    <p num="18">The respective one end portions of the above-mentioned piezoelectric vibrators 12 and 12' are fixed to the vibration plate 4, and the respective other end portions of the same are fixed to the projection portions 2a.</p>
    <p num="19">FIGS. 3a to 3f illustrate a method of producing the above-mentioned vibrators.</p>
    <p num="20">
      A thin coating of a piezoelectric material in paste-like form, for example, a titanic-acid/zirconic-acid lead-system composite ceramic material, is applied on a surface plate 20 to thereby form a first piezoelectric material layer 21 (in FIG. 3a).
      <br/>
      A first conductive layer 22 is formed on the surface of the first piezoelectric material layer 21, while a part of the first piezoelectric material layer 21 is left as an exposed portion 21a (in FIG. 3b).
      <br/>
      Further, a thin coating of a piezoelectric material is applied on the respective surfaces of the conductive layer 22 and the exposed portion 21a of the first piezoelectric material layer 21 to thereby form a second piezoelectric material layer 23.
      <br/>
      A conductive layer 24 is further formed on the other surface of the layer 23 (in FIG. 3c).
      <br/>
      The above steps are repeated a required number of times.
    </p>
    <p num="21">
      In the stage where a predetermined number of layers have been formed in the form of a lamination in such a manner as described above, the lamination is dried and fired under pressure at a temperature in a range of 1000 (degree)  C. to 1200 (degree)  C. for about an hour, thereby obtaining a plate-like ceramic member 25.
      <br/>
      One end portion of the ceramic member 25 where the conductive layer 24 is exposed is coated with a conductive paint to thereby form a collecting electrode 26, and the other end portion of the ceramic member 25 where the conductive layer 22 is exposed is coated with a conductive paint to thereby form a collecting electrode 27 (in FIG. 3d) to thereby form a piezoelectric plate 28.
      <br/>
      The thus-formed piezoelectric plate 28 is fixed onto the projection portion 2a of the base 2 through a conductive bonding agent (FIG. 3e).
      <br/>
      Then, the piezoelectric plate 28 is cut, by a diamond cutter or the like, in the vicinity of the surface of the base 2, to thereby divide it in predetermined widths into a plurality of vibrators 30 (in FIG. 3f).
    </p>
    <p num="22">
      Thus, there is formed an arrangement of the piezoelectric vibrators 30 (corresponding to the piezoelectric plate 12 and 12 in FIG. 1), the respective one-end portions of which are fixed to the base 2, and the other free end portions of which are separated by slits 29 produced by the above-mentioned cutting process.
      <br/>
      The steps shown in FIGS. 3e and 3f are also applied to the opposite surface of the base 2, whereupon a vibrator unit as shown in FIG. 4 is formed.
    </p>
    <p num="23">
      Individually separated conductive members are connected to the respective collecting electrodes 26 which are connected to the one-side electrodes of the respective piezoelectric vibrators 30, of the thus-arranged vibration unit, while a common conductive member is connected to the collecting electrodes 27 which are respectively connected to the other-side electrodes.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, in the case where the vibration plate 4 is made of a conductive material, the vibration plate 4 is employed as the common conductive member.
    </p>
    <p num="24">If an electric signal of about 30 V is applied between the conductive members, the piezoelectric vibrators 30, to which the signal is selectively applied through their proper conductive members, expand in their axial directions 26A as a result of application of the actuating voltage to the respective piezoelectric material layers.</p>
    <p num="25">In this embodiment, since the electrodes are disposed parallel to each other in the expansion direction, the energy efficiency is high in comparison with those of other vibration modes.</p>
    <p num="26">
      The vibration plate 4 (see FIG. 1) fixed to the top ends of the piezoelectric vibrators 12 expands so that the vibration plate 4 contacting the piezoelectric vibrators 12 is displaced in the direction toward the recess portions 6a constituting the ink reservoirs, thereby compressing the ink reservoirs.
      <br/>
      The ink on which the pressure is exerted through the volume reduction of the ink reservoirs reaches the corresponding nozzle apertures 10 through the penetrating holes 6c and jets out as ink drops.
    </p>

      When the application of the signal is stopped, the piezoelectric vibrators 12 contract so that the vibration plate 4 also returns to its initial position.

      FIGS. 7a and 7b show an embodiment of the inventive method of producing an array of piezoelectric elements.

      In FIG. 7a, reference numeral 65 represents a member in which the surface of a base plate 66 formed of a plate-like ceramic material is coated with a conductive material 67, which acts also as bonding agent.
      <br/>
      The surface of the conductive material 67 of this base plate 66 is coated with piezoelectric materials 68 and conductive materials 69 alternately in layers in the same manner as in the above-mentioned case (FIGS. 3a to 3c).
    </p>
    <p num="37">
      In the stage where a lamination of a predetermined number of layers has been dried to a state in which it can be fired, the base plate 66, the piezoelectric materials 68 and the conductive materials 69 are fired integrally as they are.
      <br/>
      Consequently, the base plate 66, the piezoelectric materials 68 and the conductive materials 69 are bonded by the conductive layers 67 and formed integrally (in FIG. 7b).
      <br/>
      Subsequent to the firing operation, by forming slits at a constant distance as mentioned above, it is possible to integrally form piezoelectric element arrays on the base plate 66 in which the conductive layers 67 are formed.

    <p num="38">
      Moreover, since the jetting ability of liquid drops jetted from the nozzle apertures depends on the distance between the nozzle plate and the free end surface of the piezoelectric element, the value of the distance can be adjusted by grinding the part forming the free end of the piezoelectric element when the piezoelectric element is formed.
      <br/>
      In order to facilitate such adjustment, a layer S which has no relationship to piezoelectric action may be formed of a piezoelectric or electrode material in advance on the free end surface, as shown in FIG. 8, so that the layer S may be ground to carry out the adjustment working.

      FIG. 9 shows another embodiment of the array of piezoelectric elements according to the present invention.

      As seen in the drawing, inactive portions 76 of a length corresponding to a quarter of the vibration wavelength are formed between a base plate 70 and electrodes 74, which are the closest to the base plate 70, when piezoelectric elements 78 are fixed on the base plate 70 to form a printing head assembly.
      <br/>
      Consequently, of the elastic waves produced within the piezoelectric elements, elastic waves which have propagated to the base plate 70 are reflected on the surface of the base plate 70 because the acoustic impedance of the base plate 70 is different from that of the piezoelectric material so that the elastic waves return to the free ends while their phases are reversed by reciprocal passage through the inactive portions 76, thereby contributing to the ink drop generation.

      FIG. 10 shows another embodiment of the array of piezoelectric elements according to the present invention.
      <br/>
      In this embodiment, a layer 84 of a substance of a high viscoelastic property is interposed between a base plate 80 and an array of piezoelectric elements 82 which are assembled as a printing head, or the piezoelectric elements are fixed to the base plate through a bonding agent which can maintain a high viscoelastic property upon completion of solidification, thereby forming a bonding agent layer.
    </p>
    <p num="41">According to this embodiment, since elastic waves propagating to the base plate 80 are attenuated by the viscoelastic layer 84, not only is it possible to reduce the interference of reflected waves from the base plate 80 to thereby stabilize the generation and jet of ink drops, but also it is possible to absorb the strain produced between the base plate 80 and the piezoelectric elements 82 at the time of expansion of the piezoelectric elements 82 by the viscoelastic layer 84 so as to prevent the piezoelectric elements 82 from being broken off.</p>
    <p num="42">On the other hand, since the piezoelectric elements expand not only in their axial direction but also in their width direction at the time of discharging ink, a large stress acts on the bonding surface thereof with the base plate.</p>
    <p num="43">
      FIG. 11 illustrate a positive measure against such a problem.
      <br/>
      As seen in the drawing, a shallow slit 87 is formed in an array of piezoelectric elements 86 on the side thereof contacting a base plate 85 so that the slit 87 can absorb the strain in the width direction.

      FIG. 12 shows an embodiment of the above-mentioned nozzle plate.
      <br/>
      In this embodiment, a nozzle plate 92 is constituted in a manner so that a nozzle aperture 89 is formed in the area opposite to the free end of each piezoelectric element 88, and an elliptical recess portion 90 is formed so as to surround the nozzle aperture 89.
    </p>
    <p num="45">
      According to this nozzle plate, if a signal is applied so that the free end of the piezoelectric element 88 expands toward the nozzle plate 92, ink present in the elliptical recess portion 90 is surrounded by a wall 94 of the recess portion 90 and covered from the back with the free end of the piezoelectric element 88 upon reception of dynamic pressure caused by elastic waves from the piezoelectric element 88.
      <br/>
      Its escape path being blocked, the ink concentratedly flows into the nozzle aperture 89.
      <br/>
      It is therefore possible to jet ink drops effectively with as low applied voltage as possible.
    </p>
    <p num="46">
      FIG. 13 shows another embodiment of the nozzle plate.
      <br/>
      In the nozzle plate of this embodiment, a groove 98 having a slightly larger width W than the width W' of each piezoelectric element 96 passes a nozzle aperture 100.
    </p>
    <p num="47">
      According to this embodiment, if the piezoelectric element 96 is disposed close enough for its top end to enter the groove 98, elastic waves generated by the piezoelectric element 96 apply a dynamic pressure to ink in the groove 98.
      <br/>
      Then, since the ink in the groove 98 is surrounded by the walls 102 of the groove 98 and covered from the back with the free end of the piezoelectric element 96, the ink in the groove 98 jets out from the nozzle aperture 100 effectively.
      <br/>
      When the driving signal is stopped to thereby allow the piezoelectric element 96 to contract, ink flows from a portion not opposite the piezoelectric element in the groove 98 into an area opposite the piezoelectric element, thereby preparing for the next printing operation.
      <br/>
      Although the width of the groove 98 is larger than that of the piezoelectric element 96 in this embodiment so that the top end of the piezoelectric element 96 can enter the groove 98, the width W of the groove 98 may be made smaller than the width W1 of the piezoelectric element 96 to provide a space between the top end of the piezoelectric element 96 and the surface of the nozzle plate 101.
      <br/>
      In this case, ink receiving elastic waves from the piezoelectric element 96 is prevented from expanding in the direction parallel to the nozzle plate 101 by the walls 102 of the groove 98, so that it is possible to produce ink drops effectively.

      In the nozzle plate of this embodiment, a recess portion 106 having substantially-the same shape as a piezoelectric element is formed so as to surround a nozzle aperture 104, and grooves 108 which are shallower than the recess portion 106 are formed in both sides of the recess portion 106.

    <p num="49">
      According to this embodiment, in the same manner as in FIG. 12, when a piezoelectric element 110 expands, that is, when elastic waves are produced, dynamic pressure is applied to the ink in the recess portion 106 from the piezoelectric element 110.
      <br/>
      Surrounded by the wall of the recess portion 106 and the free end surface of the piezoelectric element 110, the ink jets out through the nozzle aperture 104 effectively.
      <br/>
      On the other hand, when the piezoelectric element contracts, ink flows from the grooves 108 to the recess portion 106 suddenly, preparing for the next ink drop generation.

      In order to form such a nozzle plate, a plate having a three-layer structure in which nickel plates 116 and 118 are pressed and fixed onto the opposite side of a copper plate 114, as shown in FIG. 15, is prepared, and then a recess portion and grooves are formed by an etching agent which dissolves only the nickel plates 116 and 118 selectively.
      <br/>
      Thus, it is possible to form a recess portion having an even bottom portion.

    <p num="54">According to this embodiment, not only it is possible to control the distance between nozzle plate 136 and each of the piezoelectric elements 132 by use of the struts 130, but also it is possible to prevent dynamic pressure from propagating between adjacent piezoelectric elements 132.</p>
    <p num="55">FIG. 19 shows another configuration of the struts 130 shown in FIG. 18. In this embodiment, the foregoing rectangular-prism-like piezoelectric ceramic material is fixed on a base plate 142, and then the ceramic material is cut and separated into portions 144 to form piezoelectric elements and portions 146 to form struts, the portions to form piezoelectric elements being ground a little on the side of their free ends.</p>

      In the thus-formed array of piezoelectric elements, a nozzle plate 148 is disposed so as to be in contact with the portions 146 to form struts as shown in FIG. 20, so that it is possible to make the gap between the nozzle plate and the free end of each of the piezoelectric elements be a predetermined size.
      <br/>
      Accordingly to this embodiment, not only is it possible to form struts in the process of forming an array of piezoelectric elements, but also it is possible to simplify the assembling work because of eliminating the step of attaching the strut members to the base plate.

    <p num="58">
      In this embodiment, a voltage in the direction of contraction is applied to the piezoelectric elements 154 which are in the position of ink drop formation.
      <br/>
      Consequently, a gap G is produced between the nozzle plate 150 and the free end surfaces of the piezoelectric elements 154 (in FIG. 21b), so that ink flows into this gap.
      <br/>
      Then, when the application of the signal is stopped, or if a signal in the direction of expansion is applied, the free ends of the piezoelectric elements 154 expand toward the nozzle plate 150.

      In this process of expansion, the ink in the gap G is pressed to the nozzle aperture 152 and jetted out to the outside as an ink drop.
      <br/>
      Since the nozzle aperture 152 which has no relationship to the formation of an ink drop is made to elastically contact with the free end of the piezoelectric element 154, dynamic pressure from the adjacent piezoelectric elements does not act on the nozzle aperture 152 so that the ink can be prevented from leaking.

      Next, slits 204 and 206 are formed in the thickness of the piezoelectric element plates at predetermined intervals extending parallel to the direction of lamination of the piezoelectric element plates 200 and 202 (FIG. 24c).

      Consequently, piezoelectric elements 205 and 207 separated from each other by the slits 204 and 206 are formed on the base plate 194 in a manner so that electrodes on one side are commonly connected to each other by the spacers 196 and 198.

      <br/>
      Of course, since the force produced by the piezoelectric element 224 is extremely large, the effect of the viscosity of the bonding agent 218 is extremely small, so that the energy produced as the transformation of the piezoelectric element is not absorbed by the bonding agent.

    <p num="79">The thus integrally formed structure constituted by the piezoelectric element plate 292 and the plate 290 is fixed to a spacer member 298 on its one side (FIG. 31b), and slits 300 are formed at regular intervals using a diamond cutter or the like to thereby strip lead pieces 302 with their one ends fixed to the spacer 298 and with their other ends made free (FIG. 31c).</p>
    <p num="80">Accordingly to this embodiment, if an electric signal in the direction of contraction of the piezoelectric element plate 292 is applied to the conductive layers 294 and 296, the free ends of the lead pieces 302 are bent toward the piezoelectric element plate 292 against the elasticity of the plate 290.</p>
    <p num="81">In this state, when the application of the electric signal is stopped, the elastic force stored in the plate 290 is released so that the lead pieces 302 spring and return to their original positions.</p>
    <p num="82">Consequently, ink between the nozzle plate 278 and the lead pieces 270 (FIG. 30a) is pressed out toward the nozzle aperture 280 and jetted out of the nozzle aperture 280 as an ink drop.</p>
    <p num="83">Although the piezoelectric element plate 292 produced in advance is cemented to the plate 290 in the embodiment shown in FIG. 31, high heat-proof ceramics may be used for the plate 290, so that it is possible to omit the cementing process if the piezoelectric element plate is formed on the above-mentioned process (in FIG. 3) thereon.</p>
    <p num="84">FIGS. 32a to 32c show another embodiment of producing a lead piece, in which a piezoelectric element plate 312 produced by the above-mentioned process is cemented to one surface of a plate 310 composed of an elastic metal plate or ceramics and constituting the above-mentioned spring plate 272 with a bonding agent so that conductive layers 314 and 316 of the piezoelectric element plate 312 are perpendicular to the plate 310 (FIG. 32a).</p>
    <p num="85">
      The piezoelectric element plate 312 and the plate 310 arranged integrally is fixed at its one end portion to a spacer member 318 (in FIG. 32b).
      <br/>
      Then, slits 320 are formed in the piezoelectric element plate 312 and the plate 310 at regular intervals using a diamond cutter or the like, so as to form stripped lead pieces 322, one ends of which are fixed to the spacer 318 and the other ends of which are free (FIG. 32c).
      <br/>
      According to this embodiment, if an electric signal in the direction of contraction of the piezoelectric element plate 312 is applied to conductive layers 314 and 316, the respective free ends of the lead pieces 302 are bent toward the piezoelectric element plate 312 against the elasticity of the plate 310.
    </p>
    <p num="86">In this state, when the application of the electric signal is stopped, the elastic force stored in the plate 310 is released so that the lead pieces 322 spring and return to their original positions.</p>
