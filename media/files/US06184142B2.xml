      A simplified method is disclosed for etching low k organic dielectric film.
      <br/>
      A substrate is provided with a hardmask layer and low k organic dielectric layer formed thereon in which hardmask layer is on the dielectric layer.
      <br/>
      A layer of photoresist is formed on the hardmask layer and imaged with a pattern by exposure through a dark field mask.
      <br/>
      As a key step, the pattern is transferred into the hardmask layer by dry etching and then the photoresist is stripped in-situ.
      <br/>
      Then, the interconnect is formed by using dry etching the low k organic dielectric layer using the hardmask layer as a mask, and readying it for the next semiconductor process.

    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="1">

      <br/>
      Field of the Invention
    </p>
    <p num="2">The present invention relates to the application of low k organic dielectric material used in fabrication of semiconductor devices, and more particularly to a method of etching such films.</p>
    <p num="3">2. Description of the Prior Art</p>
    <p num="4">
      As integrated circuit design rules have migrated into the deep submicron regime, both on-chip interconnects and associated fabrication processes have become critical to the performance, reliability, and manufacturing cost of integrated circuits.
      <br/>
      The needs for higher performance and lower cost for each new generation have led to dramatic reductions in wiring pitches, which have made signal propagation delay in the interconnects an appreciable and growing fraction of the total cycle time.
      <br/>
      In order to minimize the interconnect RC delay, low dielectric constant (low k, k&lt;3) materials can be used as the interlevel dielectric (ILD) film, the majority of low k materials are based on spin-on organic polymers, such as FLARE, SILK, etc.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      Because conventional etch blocking layer materials, such as photoresist materials, for example, are typically removed after etching and the characteristic of organic dielectric layer is similar to photoresist, these conventional spin-on organic low k materials will show limitations on process integration.
      <br/>
      The first is low resistance to O2 plasma that requires complicated process sequence to protect these spin-on organic films.
      <br/>
      A method to solve this problem is that after having formed low k organic dielectric film, a hardmask layer is deposited on the dielectric film that can protect the organic dielectric film from ashing damaging.
      <br/>
      However, lateral etching can not stop happening.
      <br/>
      FIGS. 1A to 1C show the steps for detailed process flow of conventional method that damaging side wall of low k organic dielectric film.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      After the photoresist 20 is imaged, dry etch 40 will transfer pattern into hardmask layer 14 and low k organic dielectric layer 12, as shown in FIG. 1A. Then, photoresist layer 20 is stripped by O2 plasma and results lateral etching in organic dielectric layer 12 due to carbon content, as shown in FIG. 1B and FIG. 1C. Such result in dual damascene process will change etch profile, as shown in FIGS. 2A-2D. In this process, low k organic dielectric layers 12 and 13 are separated by a stop layer 16 which can stop trench etching in this layer.
      <br/>
      A cap layer 14 that can prevent moisture absorption is also like hardmask layer.
      <br/>
      After forming a photoresist layer 30, a hole pattern is transferred into photoresist layer 30 through imaging, as shown in FIG. 2A. Then, via is formed by using dry etching cap layer 14, low k organic dielectric layer 13, stop layer 16, and low k organic dielectric layer 12, as shown in FIG. 2B. Next, photoresist 30 is removed by using O2 plasma and low k organic dielectric layers 12 and 13 are etched laterally, as shown in FIG. 2C. The following is trench etch and will cause the poor profile in FIG. 2D.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      One way to solve this problem is choosing a type of low k organic silicon-oxide films with lower carbon-content in the film (between 5% to 20%) which showed better resistance to pure O2 plasma during photoresist strip steps.
      <br/>
      But these low k organic silicon-oxide films still showed other limitations with conventional damascene etching: (1) O2 plasma ashing changes k value, (2) O2 plasma ashing changes etch profile undercut and bowing, (3) low selectivity to PR, and (4) need cap layer on the top of low k film to prevent moisture absorption which need to open before etching.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      Due to high carbon content (&gt;30%) in these spin-on organic low k films, another conventional method that requires multiple films as hardmask layer to avoid direct exposure of low k film to O2 plasma is disclosed in FIGS. 3A-3G. First, a composite insulation layer comprising of low k organic dielectric film 12, SiO2 film 17 and SiON ARC film 18 is deposited on a substrate 10.
      <br/>
      Photoresist 30 is formed on the SiON layer 18 and imaged.
      <br/>
      SiON layer 18 is etched by using dry etch 40, as shown in FIG. 3A. Then photoresist 30 is stripped while low k film 12 can prevent from O2 plasma damage due to SiO2 layer 17; then SiO2 layer 17 is etched using SiON layer 16 as etch hardmask, as shown in FIG. 3B. Next, low k organic dielectric film 13, SiO2 layer 15, and SiON layer 14 is deposited in sequence and then another photoresist layer 31 is deposited with imaged, as shown in FIG. 3C. As the same steps from FIG. 3A to 3B, SiON layer 14 is etched using photoresist layer 31 as a mask, as shown in FIG. 3D. Then, photoresist layer 31 is stripped with avoiding O2 plasma damage on low k film 13 for the same reason mentioned above; then, SiO2 layer 15 is etched using SiON layer 14 as etch hardmask, as shown in FIG. 3E. Then, dual damascene structure is formed by using anisotropically etching low k organic dielectric films 13 and 12, as shown in FIG. 3F. Cross section of dual damascene structure is formed after metal barrier layer and metal layer deposition in sequence and etching excess metal by using chemical mechanical polishing method.
      <br/>
      However, this method has intricate steps in dual damascene technology.

    </p>
    <p num="16">
      Referring to FIG. 5A, substrate 100 is provided with a composite dielectric insulation comprising bottom and top layers 112 and 114, respectively.
      <br/>
      A first layer of photoresist 130 is next formed on the composite layer.
    </p>
    <p num="17">
      The bottom layer 112 is coated spin-on low k organic dielectric film by using any suitable conventional method.
      <br/>
      In this embodiment, the material of this low k organic dielectric film 112 can be selected from FLARE, SILK, etc., and the thickness of this layer 112 is ranged about from 6000 to 10000 angstroms.
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      The top layer 114 is a hardmask layer such as silicon oxide (SiO2) or silicon oxynitride (SiON) and also can be used as cap layer to prevent from moisture absorption.
      <br/>
      It is preferred that top layer 114 is deposited using any conventional method such as plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition and that it has a thickness between about 500 to 1000 angstroms.
      <br/>
      It will briefly be noted here that substrate in FIG. 5A is provided with a substructure of devices formed in the substrate and/or metal layers thereof, and as they are not significant to the invention, they are not described in detail in order not to unnecessarily obscure the present invention.
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      The preferred thickness of photoresist layer 130 shown in FIG. 5A is between about 0.6 to 0.8 micrometers.

      In according with the main feature of this invention, pattern in the photoresist layer 130 is transferred into top layer 114 as shown in FIG. 5B by using any conventional method such as dry etch.
      <br/>
      Then, photoresist layer 130 is removed in-situ by using O2 plasma treatment in the same etcher.
      <br/>
      This plasma treatment will lightly etch the surface of low k organic dielectric layer 112 in FIG. 5B, however, this damaged potion will be removed in the following etching step.
    </p>
    <p num="21">
      Referring to FIG. 5C, the pattern of top layer 114 is transferred into low k organic dielectric layer 112 by using any suitable conventional anisotropically etch method.

      Moreover, a barrier layer (not shown in figures) is used to protect metal formed in substrate 100 from etching damage.
      <br/>
      Up to the present, FIGS. 5A to 5C illustrate the steps in FIG. 4.

      <br/>
      Other barrier layer may be used such as silicon oxynitride (SiON) as long as it has different etch characteristics than low k organic dielectric film and can be used as ARC layer.
