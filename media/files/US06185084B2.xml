    <heading>BACKGROUND</heading>
    <p num="4">
      Transport of particles is fundamental to many instruments including airborne samplers, particle sorters, and electrostatic cleaning apparatuses.
      <br/>
      Specifically, the particle diameter range from 1 to 10  MU m is of significant importance because many airborne pollutants such as biological spores, dust particles, and chemical agents fall into this geometric size range.
      <br/>
      In addition, other airborne pollutants, orders of magnitude smaller than this size range, have also been dispersed in air with the aid of larger carrier particles which are in the 1-10 MU m size scale.
      <br/>
      Therefore, such a particle transport device becomes a vital component of a wide range of instruments.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      Electrostatic particle transportation for 1-10  MU m sized particle has been an unresolved task for engineers.
      <br/>
      Devices for manipulation and transport have been developed for larger size ranges of particles, but not in the 1 to 10  MU m particle scales.
      <br/>
      Surface forces and particle charging become difficult issues in successfully engineering a robust particle transport mechanism.
      <br/>
      For example, Novick, Hummer, and Dunn have noted that the sub-10  MU m range presents a different regime where surface adhesive forces and particle charging hinder the successful engineering of a robust particle transport system.

      <br/>
      Previous MEMS work only reported success on moving larger particles (over 30  MU m) with voltages typically in the kV regime.

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
    <p num="9">
      The present disclosure describes methods and apparatus implementing a technique for electrostatic particle transportation.
      <br/>
      In a preferred implementation, a chip built using micromachining technology includes patterned and insulated electrodes in a grid or arrays.
      <br/>
      The electrodes are specifically designed to electrostatically transport particles from 1-10  MU m in diameter.
      <br/>
      Using conventional techniques, electrostatically transporting particles in this size range is very difficult.
      <br/>
      The technique of the present disclosure shows that such transportation can be done with the right combination of insulation materials, insulation thicknesses, particle sizes, particle compositions, wave-forms, frequencies, and voltages.
      <br/>
      Particle transportation efficiencies as high as 90% have been routinely achieved for 5 and 8 micron glass beads.
      <br/>
      This technology has wide applications.
      <br/>
      For example, a membrane air-filter utilizing this particle transportation technique can be fabricated.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      FIG. 1 shows an electrode panel 100 of an electrostatic particle transportation ("EPT") system including three electrode arrays 105, 110, 115 covered by an insulation layer 120.
      <br/>
      The electrodes 105, 110, 115 are positioned upon a silicon oxide (SiO2) layer 125.
      <br/>
      The silicon oxide layer 125 is formed on a silicon substrate 130.
      <br/>
      The fabrication process is described below.
      <br/>
      A phase shifted electrical signal is applied to the electrode arrays 105, 110, 115 to cause a particle 130 to move in the direction indicated by arrow 135.
    </p>
    <p num="11">
      The components in the EPT system can vary depending upon the application and desired performance characteristics.
      <br/>
      The insulation layer 120 can be made from a variety of insulation materials, such as silicon nitride, photoresist, or polytetrafluoroethylene (i.e., Teflon (tm) ).
      <br/>
      The thickness of the insulation layer 120 can also vary from zero to approximately 12  MU m. The size of the particle 130 which can be used with the system can vary from approximately 1 to 10  MU m. In addition, the particle 130 can be made from various materials, including metal, glass, polystyrene, spores, etc.
      <br/>
      The signal supplied to the electrodes 105, 110, 115 can have a variety of wave-forms, frequencies, and voltages.
    </p>
    <p num="12">
      FIGS. 2A through 2E illustrate a preferred fabrication process for an electrode panel 200 of an EPT chip 200.
      <br/>
      The resulting EPT chip 200 includes two insulation layers and two conductive layers forming a three phase network.
      <br/>
      In alternative implementations having higher order phases, the electrode panel includes more insulation and conductive layers.
      <br/>
      A cross-sectional view of a finished electrode panel is shown in FIG. 1.
    </p>
    <p num="13">
      In FIG. 2A, a silicon substrate 205 is coated with a layer 210 of thermal oxide approximately 1-2  MU m thick.
      <br/>
      The substrate 205 can be made of alterative materials such as glass, quartz or sapphire, and the thermal oxide layer 210 can be formed from materials such as silicon dioxide.
    </p>
    <p num="14">
      In FIG. 2B, approximately 3000  Angstrom  of aluminum is thermally evaporated and patterned to form electrodes 215.
      <br/>
      In FIG. 2C, Silicon nitride ("SiN") is deposited by plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition ("PECVD") to form an insulation layer 220 approximately 1  MU m thick upon the electrodes 215 and thermal oxide layer 210.
      <br/>
      One or more via holes 225 are etched into the silicon nitride layer 220 to provide access to the electrodes 215.
      <br/>
      In FIG. 2D, a second Al layer 230 is deposited upon the silicon nitride layer 220 and patterned.
      <br/>
      In an alternative implementation, a similar process using gold instead of aluminum for the electrodes 215 and aluminum layer 230 and low temperature thermal oxide instead of PECVD silicon nitride for the silicon nitride layer 220 can be used.
    </p>
    <p num="15">
      In FIG. 2E, an insulation layer 235 ranging from approximately 1  MU m to 5  MU m in thickness is deposited to cover the structure shown in FIG. 2D. The insulation layer 235 can be applied in varying thicknesses or omitted entirely to change particle adhesion characteristics.
      <br/>
      Various materials such as photoresist, parylene, and/or Teflon (tm)  can be used for this insulation layer 235.
      <br/>
      The insulation layer 235 can also be modified through hexamethyldisilizane ("HMDS") surface treatment; O2 plasma etching, which causes micro-roughening of the surface; or substrate annealing at 200-400 (degree)  C. (for high temperature coatings such as silicon nitride), which reduce surface moisture.
    </p>
    <p num="16">
      Various electrode geometries can be fabricated using the above process.
      <br/>
      Different designs can be used to transport particles in various areas on the chip.
      <br/>
      FIGS. 3A-3C show examples of different types of electrode geometries: radial (FIG. 3A), zig-zag (FIG. 3B), and linear (FIG. 3C).
      <br/>
      FIG. 4 shows an example of a linear two-dimensional grid 400 of electrodes for two dimensional particle movement.
      <br/>
      The grid 400 is formed from two linear arrays 405, 410 (recall the linear array in FIG. 3C).
      <br/>
      Insulators 415 are positioned between the linear arrays 405, 410 where the arrays 405, 410 overlap.
    </p>
    <p num="17">
      The width of the individual electrodes and the spacing between electrodes are instrumental for optimal particle control.
      <br/>
      FIG. 5 shows a cross-section of an electrode panel 500 with values for width or thickness.
      <br/>
      The width of the electrodes 505 is preferably less than approximately 5  MU m and preferably more than approximately 3  MU m. The spacing between electrodes 505 is preferably based on the diameter of the particles.
      <br/>
      Hence, for particles around 8  MU m, the electrode spacing is approximately 8  MU m, and for particles with a diameter of approximately 5  MU m, the electrode spacing is approximately 5  MU m. These values are optimized for linear and zig-zag transportation structures.
      <br/>
      The insulation layer 510 is preferably approximately 1  MU m to 7  MU m thick, or more preferably 1  MU m to 3  MU m, to ensure minimal adhesion.
      <br/>
      The silicon nitride layer 515 is preferably approximately 1  MU m thick.
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      As noted above, the electrodes of the electrode panel operate in three phases.
      <br/>
      FIG. 6 shows a set 600 of electrodes 605 connected in three separate groups 610, 615, 620.
      <br/>
      Insulators 625 are positioned between electrodes or connections where groups overlap.
      <br/>
      Every third electrode 600 is interconnected so that a "traveling" voltage pattern through the three groups 610, 615, 620 can be utilized to transport particles in the direction of the phase progression.
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      FIG. 7 shows voltage patterns for the three-phase operation of the electrode panel.
      <br/>
      An original signal 700 is phase-shifted to form three waveforms, 705, 710, 715.
      <br/>
      Other voltage patterns such as sinusoidal waves, triangular waves, bi-polar traveling waves, or the inverse of the waveforms shown in FIG. 7 can also be utilized for sustained particle motion.
    </p>
    <p num="20">
      FIG. 8 shows a schematic of a phase circuit 800 for generating the waveforms shown in FIG. 7.
      <br/>
      The phase circuit 700 delivers voltages preferably ranging from approximately 10V to 200V and at frequencies from approximately 0.1 Hz to 10 kHz.
      <br/>
      An input signal of approximately 0 to 9V is output sequentially by phase-shift circuit 805 on three separate lines 810, 815, 820.
      <br/>
      The signals on lines 810, 815, 820 drive corresponding transistors 825, 830, 835 to output a voltage signal from a power supply 840 to output lines 845, 850, 855.
      <br/>
      Hence, the signal on each output line 845, 850, 855 is sequentially phase shifted relative to one another such that output line 845 has the signal 710 shown in FIG. 7, output line 850 has the signal 715, and output line 855 has the signal 720.
      <br/>
      Each of the output lines 845, 850, 855 is connected to a group of electrodes in the electrode panel (recall FIG. 6) to drive the electrodes in phase operation.
      <br/>
      Particles move across the electrodes in according to the phase shifted waveform, as described below.
    </p>
    <p num="21">
      In alternative implementations, particles can be made to change direction by switching phases 1 and 3, and hop (in one place) from one electrode to another by turning off one of the phases.
      <br/>
      Such implementations include a double pole double throw type of switch on the output lines.
    </p>
    <p num="22">
      Understanding stiction forces on the particle helps in analysis of the EPT system.
      <br/>
      It is well known that for particles in the size range of 1-10  MU m, adhesive forces arise from Van der Waals attraction, a meniscus force, and an image force resulting from charges on the particle.
      <br/>
      Gravitational and body forces are negligible for these airborne particles.
      <br/>
      The horizontal or x-component of the electrostatic forces (dielectric and image) due to the voltage wave-form are responsible for particle transport.
      <br/>
      However, the y-component acts downward thus adding to the stiction forces.
      <br/>
      FIG. 9 depicts an electrode panel 900 and the Fx and Fy forces on a particle 905.
      <br/>
      These forces are described below.
    </p>
    <p num="23">
      Fx =FD,x (v)+FI,x (p)
      <br/>
      Fy =FD,y (v)+FI,y (p)+Fm +Fvdw (d)
    </p>
    <p num="24">where FD,x (v) and FD,y (v) are the x and y components of a driving force from applied voltage through the electrodes; FI,x (p) and FI,y (p) are the x and y components of an image force due to charges on the particle; Fm is a meniscus force; and Fvdw (d) is a Van dew Waals force.</p>
    <p num="25">
      FIG. 10 is a chart 100 of 2-d finite element simulation results.
      <br/>
      The simulation parameters are as follows: a 8  MU m SiO2 particle 1005, 8  MU m electrode 1010 width and pitch, 100V, heights of the particle of 1 and 2 microns, and the particle is uncharged.
      <br/>
      The electrodes 1010 and the particle 1005 are drawn to scale on the x-axis.
      <br/>
      The x coordinate of each data point represents the position of the center of the particle 1005 with respect to the electrodes 1010.
      <br/>
      The y-axis shows magnitude of force in Newtons per meter.
    </p>
    <p num="26">
      FIG. 11 is a chart 1100 which shows the magnitude of the image forces as a function of position.
      <br/>
      In this simulation, the parameters are the same as in the simulation for FIG. 10 except that the applied voltage is 0V, and the particle is given a charge density.
      <br/>
      The results show that only a downward component exists, the maximum is on top of the electrode, and this force diminishes as 1/r2 (where r is the distance to the center of the particle).
      <br/>
      Superposition of these forces gives a total driving force.
    </p>
    <p num="27">
      These simulation results corroborate the phenomena observed in experiments.
      <br/>
      In experiments, variation of the vertical distance which is controlled by the thickness of the insulation film, clearly affects the performance.
      <br/>
      If the insulation is too thin, the image forces dominate and efficiency drops.
      <br/>
      If the insulation film is too thick the driving force is not enough to overcome the adhesive forces.
      <br/>
      Therefore a certain ratio between the x and y forces on the particle must be reached in order to maximize transportation efficiency.
      <br/>
      This ratio is controlled with insulation thickness.
      <br/>
      However, each insulation film has its own optimal thickness because Van der Waals and meniscus-type interactions between the particle and the insulation surface differ depending upon the type of film.
    </p>
    <p num="28">Descriptions of experimental results with implementations of the technique of the present disclosure are described below to illustrate examples of application of the technique.</p>
    <p num="29">
      In one set of experiments, a variety of sizes and materials was tested with an implementation of the EPT system operating in air.
      <br/>
      Most of the experiments were performed on various linear electrode arrays with spacings of 5  MU m and 8  MU m, where the pitch and width spacing were identical.

      Particle efficiency data was gathered by noting the ratio of particles transported to the edge of the linear electrode array vs. the total number of particles on the structure.
      <br/>
      Two major trends were noted during testing.
    </p>
    <p num="32">
      The transportation efficiency increases with increasing voltage apparently for each of the types of the final insulation films and for varying thicknesses of the insulation film.
      <br/>
      Secondly, the type of final surface coating appeared to have a significant effect on particle efficiency and threshold voltage, i.e., the minimum voltage level to exhibit particle motion.
      <br/>
      For example, photoresist film (hardbaked AZ 4400) resulted in apparent maximum efficiencies for glass particles of approximately 45%, while Teflon (tm)  films resulted in efficiencies of approximately 80%.
      <br/>

    </p>
    <p num="34">
      In addition to variation with different coating materials, transport efficiency also is a function of final insulation film thickness.
      <br/>
      There is an optimal thickness associated with the resist for maximum efficiency.
      <br/>
      FIGS. 12 and 13 show the variation of transportation efficiency vs. insulation height for 8  MU m glass spheres for photoresist and Teflon (tm) , respectively.
      <br/>
      As the insulation thickness increases, the efficiency decreases because the electrostatic force decreases away from the electrodes.
      <br/>
      However, if the insulation thickness is too thin, then the downward electrostatic force becomes much greater and consequently adds to the adhesive forces.
      <br/>
      As described above, finite element simulation verified this analysis.
      <br/>
      In addition, FIG. 13 also shows the effect of frequency and voltage.
      <br/>
      As frequency increases the efficiency improves, and then stays relatively constant.

      In another set of experiments, a micromachined airborne particle filter was constructed including an EPT system according to the present disclosure.
      <br/>
      FIG. 14 shows a three dimensional view of such a filter 1400 with electrodes 1405.
      <br/>
      Particles are collected from air by a suction fan mounted under the chip.
      <br/>
      The filter 1400 collects particles 1410 whose sizes are larger than the size of filter holes 1415 in the filter 1405.

      After being collected, the particles 1405 are electrostatically transported by traveling voltage wave-forms, as described above, to a particle reservoir (not shown).

      In the particle reservoir, the particles 1410 can be further processes, such as applying wetting and dissolving bio-agents.

      The silicon nitride layer 1505 forms a structural material for the filter 1400 and a mask for etching the backside wafer in potassium hydroxide ("KOH").
      <br/>
      In FIG. 15B, one side 1507 of wafer 1500 is time etched until the thickness of the silicon wafer 1500 is approximately 20  MU m. In FIG. 15C, the silicon nitride layer 1505 on the opposite side 1509 is patterned to prepare holes for the filter (recall the holes 1415 in the filter 1400 in FIG. 14).
      <br/>
      In FIG. 15D, approximately 2500  Angstrom  of aluminum is thermally evaporated and patterned to form electrodes 1510.
      <br/>
      Parylene is deposited to form an insulation layer 1515 over the electrodes 1510.
      <br/>
      As describer above, the insulation layer can also be formed from materials such as photoresist, Teflon (tm) , or a combination.
      <br/>
      In FIG. 15E, the insulation layer 1515 is patterned to expose the silicon substrate 1500 between electrodes 1510 and open a contact hole 1517.
      <br/>
      The insulation layer 1515 also strengthens the eventual silicon nitride filter mechanically.
      <br/>
      In FIG. 15F, a second Al layer 1520 is deposited and patterned over the contact hole 1517.
      <br/>
      In FIG. 15G, the side 1507 of the silicon substrate 1500 is etched away in the central portion with bromine trifluoride to remove the silicon between the electrodes 1510 and open holes 1525 through the resulting filter 1530.
      <br/>
      FIGS. 16A-16C show examples of three types of electrode designs.
    </p>
    <p num="37">
      Particle transport in the resulting filter 1530 is performed using the same three phase circuit described above with reference to FIG. 8.
      <br/>
      An additional Teflon (tm)  coating applied over insulation layer 1515 can improve the movement of 5 or 8  MU m borosilicate glass particles.
    </p>
    <p num="38">
      In addition to particle transport in air, an alternative implementation provides particle transport in liquid using traveling wave-forms of higher frequencies.
      <br/>
      In another set of experiments, transport of Borosilicate glass particles has been done in vacuum pump oil and water.
      <br/>
      The glass particles move well in both liquids.
      <br/>
      The transportation of glass particles in oil is very similar with that in air.
      <br/>
      The yield of transportation is almost 100 %. In oil, glass particles are moved by the positive dielectrophoretic force, i.e., the particles move to the strongest electric field region.
      <br/>
      In water, the glass particles are moved by the negative dielectrophoretic force, i.e., the particles move to the weakest electric field region.
      <br/>
      The particles are levitated between the electrodes.
      <br/>
      The electrode geometry may vary from that described above for air depending upon the type of the liquid, such as varying the spacing between electrodes.
      <br/>
      However, the frequency ranges for particles in oil and water are quite different.
      <br/>
      Preferred operation frequencies are shown in the table below.

    <p num="40">
      A high frequency and voltage circuit is used to transport particles in water.
      <br/>
      A high frequency power supply is necessary to avoid the electrolysis of water.
      <br/>
      An example of such a circuit 1700 is shown in FIG. 17. The high frequency phase circuit 1700 is similar to the phase circuit 800 shown in FIG. 8.
      <br/>
      However frequency circuit 1705 is used in place of the resistors 810, 815, 820 and transistors 825, 830, 835 to phase shift the input signal and increase the frequency to the appropriate level.

    <p num="41">
      In another implementation, combining the implementations described above for air and liquid mediums, an EPT system provides particle transport from an air to liquid medium.
      <br/>
      FIG. 18 shows a conceptual picture of liquid to air EPT system 1800.
      <br/>
      A liquid channel or reservoir 1805 is created by etching a cavity in a glass slide.
      <br/>
      The etched slide is bonded to an electrode panel 1810.
      <br/>
      Alternative ways of creating this liquid interface include using a bulk micromachined, a surface micromachined silicon substrate, or molded silicone such as polydimethylsiloxane ("PDMS") instead of glass.
      <br/>
      As noted above, the electrode geometry and input voltage wave-form requirements can be different for transportation in air and in a liquid medium.
      <br/>
      Accordingly the electrode panel 1810 includes three regions of electrodes: a liquid region 1815, an interface region 1820, and an air region 1825.
      <br/>
      Each region has a different configuration of electrodes.
      <br/>
      Thus, particles 1830 are moved from one region to the next by the EPT process corresponding to the electrode configuration of the region.
      <br/>
      The liquid region 1815 is covered by the reservoir 1805 and includes electrodes configured as described above for a liquid EPT system.
      <br/>
      Similarly, the air region 1825 is exposed to air and includes electrodes configured as described above for an air EPT system.
    </p>
    <p num="42">
      In the interface region 1820, the electrodes for each medium are interdigitated with each other.
      <br/>
      FIG. 19 shows a cross-section of the interface region 1900 and the interdigitated electrodes 1905, 1910.
      <br/>
      A liquid meniscus 1915 is formed by the liquid contacting the reservoir 1920 and the insulation layer 1925 of the electrode panel 1930.
      <br/>
      The position of the liquid meniscus 1915 is not constant, but varies over a range 1917.
      <br/>
      Part of this variation of the meniscus 1915 is represented by dashed lines 1916.
      <br/>
      On the liquid side 1918 of that range 1917, the "liquid" electrodes 1910 are configured for liquid EPT.
      <br/>
      On the air side 1919 of the range 1917 of meniscus movement, the "air" electrodes 1905 are configured for air EPT.
      <br/>
      In the range 1917, the electrodes 1905, 1910 are interdigitated because the medium adjacent the electrodes 1905, 1910 varies between air and water depending upon the position of the meniscus 1915.
      <br/>
      The degree of interdigitation is not limited to a one-to-one ratio as shown in the picture, but can be varied to optimize performance (e.g., to every third or every fifth electrode can be for "liquid").
    </p>
    <p num="43">
      Numerous exemplary implementations of the technique have been described.
      <br/>
      However, the technique is not limited to the examples described above.
      <br/>
      For example, the technique may be applied to alternative media, such as gases other than air or other liquids, with appropriate modification to the electrode panel.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, the technique is limited only by the scope of the following claims.
