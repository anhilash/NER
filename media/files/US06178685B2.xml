      A fishing rod having an integrally formed receptacle for receiving a remote portion of the fishing rod, when the fishing rod is in a disassembled state.
      <br/>
      The receptacle is positioned adjacent the handle member of the rod, and is used to receive one end of a remote portion of a fishing rod.
      <br/>
      The remote portion of the rod is then secured in parallel relation with the base portion of the rod, to facilitate transport and storage.
      <br/>
      In an alternate embodiment, a detachable rod holder may be mounted onto the base portion of the fishing rod, to accomplish the same task.
      <br/>
      The detachable rod holder may be attached in one of several places, including attachment underneath the set screw that holds the rod and reel together, or it may be attached by sandwiching the attachment tab between the rod and reel.
      <br/>
      A stay clip may be used near an upper end of the base portion of the rod, to secure that end of the base portion to the outer end of the remote portion.
      <br/>
      The rod holder itself holds the base portion and the remote portion of the rod in parallel relation, but the stay clip is an option to further secure the portions with relation to each other.
      <br/>
      In a preferred embodiment, the stay clip is integrally formed on the base portion of the rod, toward the upper tip opposite the handle member, and includes a clip for attaching the remote portion removably thereto.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, the stay clip may be removably secured to both the base portion and the remote portion of the rod, which allows the stay clip to be completely removed from the rod when the stay clip is not in use.

    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="1">
      1.
      <br/>
      Field of the Invention
    </p>
    <p num="2">
      The invention described and claimed herein relates generally to fishing rods and accessories.
      <br/>
      More specifically, the present invention allows a fishing rod to be broken down into two parts, where the base portion and the remote portion of the rod may be secured, stored and transported in a compact, secure and organized fashion.
      <br/>
      Many types of fishing rods are made to be broken down into two parts, generally because fishing rods are difficult to transport and store due to their long length.
      <br/>
      A long fishing rod may not fit into the trunk of a car, whereas a disassembled rod will likely fit into the trunk of an automobile.
      <br/>
      One problem associated with these types of fishing rods is that they do not include means for keeping and securing the remote portion of the rod together with the base portion.
      <br/>
      When the fishing rods are disassembled, there are two separate pieces that need to be transported or stored.
      <br/>
      Without any means for attaching one portion of the rod to the other, transport becomes more difficult, and storage is inefficient.
    </p>
    <p num="3">
      Therefore, it would be desirable to provide a rod holder that would allow a remote portion of a fishing rod to be removably secured adjacent to the base portion of the rod, in generally parallel relation.
      <br/>
      This arrangement facilitates transfer and storage of the disassembled fishing rod.

    </p>
    <heading>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading>
    <p num="15">
      The construction designed to carry out the invention will be hereinafter described, together with other features thereof.
      <br/>
      The invention will be more readily understood from a reading of the following specification and by reference to the accompanying drawings forming a part thereof, wherein an example of the invention is shown and wherein:
      <br/>

    </p>
    <heading>DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading>
    <p num="16">
      FIG. 1 illustrates a fishing rod 2 having an integrally formed receptacle 4 for receiving a remote portion of the fishing rod 6, when the fishing rod is in a disassembled state.
      <br/>
      In this embodiment of the invention, the integrally formed receptacle is positioned adjacent the handle member 8 of the fishing rod.
      <br/>
      The receptacle is a female holding tube that receives a lower end of the remote portion of the fishing rod, when the remote portion of the rod is removed from the base portion 10 of the rod.
      <br/>
      This receptacle is disposed so that the remote end of a fishing rod will be positioned parallel to the base member of the fishing rod, when the receptacle is in use.
      <br/>
      It is to be understood that the receptacle may be formed anywhere on or adjacent the handle member, as long as it does not interfere with the use of the rod or reel while fishing.
    </p>
    <p num="17">FIG. 2 illustrates the rod and receptacle assembly from a direct frontal view, where the receptacle is positioned directly on the handle member, and runs parallel to the longitudinal axis of the rod.</p>
    <p num="18">
      FIG. 3 is a perspective view of an alternate embodiment of the present invention, showing a fishing rod having a detachable rod holder 12 mounted adjacent the set screw 18 used to attach the reel 13 to the fishing rod.
      <br/>
      In this embodiment, the detachable rod holder 12, as shown in FIG. 6, comprises a main body member 14 and attachment means in the form of a tab 16.
      <br/>
      The tab may be U-shaped, so that the set screw located on the rod may be used to attach the detachable rod holder thereto.
      <br/>
      The two fingers of the U-shaped tab 16 slide along either side of the loosened screw 18 beneath the head of the screw, so that when the screw is tightened onto the rod, the tab 16 and rod holder 12 are held firmly in place.
      <br/>
      In this embodiment, the detachable rod holder is attached by sliding the U-shaped tab under the set screw and then tightening the screw.
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      FIG. 4 is a perspective view of a fishing rod having a detachable rod holder mounted between the rod and the reel.
      <br/>
      This is an alternate method of attaching the detachable rod holder, and the tab used for attachment is generally in the shape of a solid square or rectangle.
      <br/>
      In this embodiment, the detachable rod holder is attached by loosening the rod from the reel, and sliding the tab between the rod and reel.
      <br/>
      Then, the reel is tightened back down onto the rod, thereby sandwiching the tab for the detachable rod holder therebetween.
      <br/>
      A groove may be cut along an outer longitudinal axis of the detachable rod holder, to form a snug union between the detachable rod holder and the base of the rod handle, in the position shown in FIG. 4.
    </p>
    <p num="20">
      FIG. 5 is a perspective view of the detachable rod holder having a tab member as an attachment means.
      <br/>
      The tab member may be integrally formed with the main body member of the detachable rod holder, or it may be made separately and attached to the main body member by any suitable means, as shown in FIG. 5.
      <br/>
      In a preferred embodiment, the detachable rod holder is made from a strong and lightweight material, such as plastic.
      <br/>
      It is to be understood, however, that any suitable material may be used to manufacture the detachable rod holder.
    </p>
    <p num="21">FIG. 6 shows a slight variation from FIG. 5, where the tab member is formed integrally with the main body member, and the tab is U-shaped for attachment using the set screw on a standard type of fishing rod.</p>
    <p num="22">
      Each embodiment of the present invention allows both elements of a disassembled fishing rod to be held together in parallel relation.
      <br/>
      This arrangement provides a convenient and reliable means of securing, transporting and storing a fishing rod in its disassembled state.
      <br/>
      Further, the present apparatus prevents fishing line from becoming tangled about the disassembled portions of the rod, which is a frequent problem on rods that have no means for securement in a broken down state.
    </p>
    <p num="23">
      A stay clip 20 may be used near an upper end of the base portion of the rod, to secure that end of the base portion to the outer end of the remote portion.
      <br/>
      The rod holder itself holds the base portion and the remote portion of the rod in parallel relation, but the stay clip is an option to further secure the portions with relation to each other.
      <br/>
      In a preferred embodiment, the stay clip is integrally formed on the base portion of the rod (as shown in FIG. 1), toward the upper tip opposite the handle member, and includes a clip for attaching the remote portion removably thereto.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, the stay clip may be removably secured to both the base portion and the remote portion of the rod, which allows the stay clip to be completely removed from the rod when the stay clip is not in use.
    </p>
    <p num="24">While a preferred embodiment of the invention has been described using specific terms, such description is for illustrative purposes only, and it is to be understood that changes and variations may be made without departing from the spirit or scope of the following claims.</p>
