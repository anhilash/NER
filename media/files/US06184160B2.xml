      An implantable medical device such as a defibrillator is described.
      <br/>
      The device includes an hermetically sealed housing containing a flat electrolytic capacitor and an energy source such as a battery.
      <br/>
      The battery is connected to the capacitor and provides charge thereto.
      <br/>
      The capacitor stores the charge at a relatively high voltage.
      <br/>
      The charge stored in the capacitor is discharged through a defibrillation lead to a site on or in the heart when fibrillation of the heart is detected by the implantable medical device.
      <br/>
      Methods of making and using the implantable medical device, the capacitor, and their various components are disclosed.

    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="4">
      Implantable medical devices for therapeutic stimulation of the heart are well known in the art.
      <br/>
      In U.S. Pat. No. 4,253,466 issued to Hartlaub et al., for example, a programmable demand pacemaker is disclosed.
      <br/>
      The demand pacemaker delivers electrical energy, typically ranging in magnitude between about 5 and about 25 micro Joules, to the heart to initiate the depolarization of cardiac tissue.
      <br/>
      This stimulating regime is used to treat heart block by providing electrical stimulation in the absence of naturally occurring spontaneous cardiac depolarizations.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      Another form of implantable medical device for therapeutic stimulation of the heart is an automatic implantable defibrillator (AID), such as those described in U.S. Pat. No. Re. 27,757 to Mirowski et al. and U.S. Pat. No. 4,030,509 to Heilman et al.
      <br/>
      Those AID devices deliver energy (about 40 Joules) to the heart to interrupt ventricular fibrillation of the heart.
      <br/>
      In operation, an AID device detects the ventricular fibrillation and delivers a nonsynchronous high-voltage pulse to the heart through widely spaced electrodes located outside of the heart, thus mimicking transthoracic defibrillation.
      <br/>
      The technique of Heilman et al. requires both a limited thoracotomy to implant an electrode near the apex of the heart and a pervenous electrode system located in the superior vena cava of the heart.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      Another example of a prior art implantable cardioverter includes the pacemaker/cardioverter/defibrillator (PCD) disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,375,817 to Engle et al.
      <br/>
      This device detects the onset of tachyarrhythmia and includes means to monitor or detect the progression of the tachyarrhythmia so that progressively greater energy levels may be applied to the heart to interrupt a ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation.
    </p>
    <p num="7">Another device is an external synchronized cardioverter, such as that described in "Clinical Application of Cardioversion" in Cardiovascular Clinics, 1970, Vol. 2, pp. 239-260 by Douglas P. Zipes. This type of external device provides cardioversion shocks synchronized with ventricular depolarization to ensure that the cardioverting energy is not delivered during the vulnerable T-wave portion of the cardiac cycle.</p>
    <p num="8">Another example of a prior art implantable cardioverter includes the device disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,384,585 to Douglas P. Zipes. This device includes circuitry to detect the intrinsic depolarizations of cardiac tissue and pulse generator circuitry to deliver moderate energy level stimuli (in the range of about 0.1 to about 10 Joules) to the heart synchronously with the detected cardiac activity.</p>
    <p num="9">
      The functional objective of such a stimulating regimen is to depolarize areas of the myocardium involved in the genesis and maintenance of re-entrant or automatic tachyarrhythmias at lower energy levels with greater safety than was possible with nonsynchronous cardioversion.
      <br/>
      Nonsynchronous cardioversion always incurs the risk of precipitating ventricular fibrillation and sudden death.
      <br/>
      Synchronous cardioversion delivers the shock at a time when the bulk of cardiac tissue is already depolarized and is in a refractory state.
      <br/>
      Other examples of automatic implantable synchronous cardioverters include those of Charms in U.S. Pat. No. 3,738,370.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      It is expected that the increased safety deriving from use of lower energy levels and their attendant reduced trauma to the myocardium, as well as the smaller size of implantable medical devices, will expand indications for use beyond the existing patient base of automatic implantable defibrillators.
      <br/>
      Since many episodes of ventricular fibrillation are preceded by ventricular (and in some cases, supraventricular) tachycardias, prompt termination of the tachycardia may prevent ventricular fibrillation.
    </p>
    <p num="11">
      Consequently, current devices for the treatment of tachyarrhythmias include the possibility of programming staged therapies of antitachycardia pacing regimens, along with cardioversion energy and defibrillation energy shock regimens in order to terminate the arrhythmia with the most energy-efficient and least traumatic therapies, when possible.
      <br/>
      In addition, some current implantable tachycardia devices are capable of delivering single or dual chamber bradycardia pacing therapies, as of which are described, for example, in U.S. Pat. No. 4,800,833 to Winstrom, U.S. Pat. No. 4,830,006 to Haluska et al., and U.S. patent application Ser.
      <br/>
      No. 07/612,758 to Keimel for "Apparatus for Delivering Single and Multiple Cardioversion and Defibrillation Pulses" filed Nov. 14, 1990, and incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, and as described in the foregoing '833 and '006 patents and the '758 application, considerable study has been undertaken to devise the most efficient electrode systems and shock therapies.
    </p>
    <p num="12">
      Initially, implantable cardioverters and defibrillators were envisioned as operating with a single pair of electrodes applied on or in the heart.
      <br/>
      Examples of such systems are disclosed in the aforementioned '757 and '509 patents, wherein shocks are delivered between an electrode is placed in or on the right ventricle and a second electrode placed outside the right ventricle.
      <br/>
      Studies have indicated that two electrode defibrillation systems often require undesirably high energy levels to effect defibrillation.
    </p>
    <p num="13">
      In an effort to reduce the amount of energy required to effect defibrillation, numerous suggestions have been made with regard to multiple electrode systems.
      <br/>
      Some of those suggestions are set forth in U.S. Pat. No. 4,291,699 to Geddes et al., U.S. Pat. No. 4,708,145 to Tacker et al., U.S. Pat. No. 4,727,877 to Kallock, and U.S. Pat. No. 4,932,407 issued to Williams where sequential pulse multiple electrode systems are described.
      <br/>
      Sequential pulse systems operate based on the assumption that sequential defibrillation pulses delivered between differing electrode pairs have an additive effect such that the overall energy requirements to achieve defibrillation are less than the energy levels required to accomplish defibrillation using a single pair of electrodes.
    </p>
    <p num="14">
      An alternative approach to multiple electrode sequential pulse defibrillation is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,641,656 to Smits and also in the above-cited '407 patent.
      <br/>
      This defibrillation method may conveniently be referred to as a multiple electrode simultaneous pulse defibrillation method, and involves the simultaneous delivery of defibrillation pulses between two different pairs of electrodes.
      <br/>
      For example, one electrode pair may include a right ventricular electrode and a coronary sinus electrode, and a second electrode pair may include a right ventricular electrode and a subcutaneous patch electrode, with the right ventricular electrode serving as a common electrode to both electrode pairs.
      <br/>
      An alternative multiple electrode, single path, biphasic pulse system is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,953,551 to Mehra et al., which employs right ventricular, superior vena cava and subcutaneous patch electrodes.
    </p>
    <p num="15">
      In the above-cited prior art simultaneous pulse multiple electrode systems, delivery of simultaneous defibrillation pulses is accomplished by simply coupling two electrodes together.
      <br/>
      For example, in the above-cited '551 patent, the superior vena cava and subcutaneous patch electrodes are electrically coupled together and a pulse is delivered between those two electrodes and the right ventricular electrode.
      <br/>
      Similarly, in the above-cited '407 patent, the subcutaneous patch and coronary sinus electrodes are electrically coupled together, and a pulse is delivered between these two electrodes and a right ventricular electrode.
      <br/>
      See also U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,411,539; 5,620,477; 5,6589,321; 5,545,189 and 5,578,062, where active can electrodes are discussed.
    </p>
    <p num="16">
      The aforementioned '758 application discloses a pulse generator for use in conjunction with an implantable cardioverter/defibrillator which is capable of providing all three of the defibrillation pulse methods described above, with a minimum of control and switching circuitry.
      <br/>
      The output stage is provided with two separate output capacitors which are sequentially discharged during sequential pulse defibrillation and simultaneously discharged during single or simultaneous pulse defibrillation.
      <br/>
      The complexity of those stimulation therapy regimens require rapid and efficient charging of high voltage output capacitors from low voltage battery power sources incorporated within the implantable medical device.
    </p>
    <p num="17">
      Typically, the electrical energy required to power an implantable cardiac pacemaker is supplied by a low voltage, low current drain, long-lived power source such as a lithium iodine pacemaker battery of the type manufactured by Wilson Greatbatch, Ltd. or Medtronic, Inc.

      While the energy density of such power sources is typically relatively high, they are generally not capable of being rapidly and repeatedly discharged at high current drains in the manner required to directly cardiovert the heart with cardioversion energies in the range of 0.1 to 10 Joules.
      <br/>
      Moreover, the nominal voltage at which such batteries operate is generally too low for cardioversion applications.
      <br/>
      Higher energy density battery systems are known which can be more rapidly or more often discharged, such as lithium thionyl chloride power sources.
      <br/>
      Neither of the foregoing battery types, however, may have the capacity or the voltage required to provide an impulse of the required magnitude on a repeatable basis to the heart following the onset of tachyarrhythmia.

    <p num="18">
      Generally speaking, it is necessary to employ a DC--DC converter to convert electrical energy from a low voltage, low current power supply to a high voltage energy level stored in a high energy storage capacitor.
      <br/>
      A typical form of DC--DC converter is commonly referred to as a "flyback" converter which employs a transformer having a primary winding in series with the primary power supply and a secondary winding in series with the high energy capacitor.
      <br/>
      An interrupting circuit or switch is placed in series with the primary coil and battery.
      <br/>
      Charging of the high energy capacitor is accomplished by inducing a voltage in the primary winding of the transformer creating a magnetic field in the secondary winding.
      <br/>
      When the current in the primary winding is interrupted, the collapsing field develops a current in the secondary winding which is applied to the high energy capacitor to charge it.
      <br/>
      The repeated interruption of the supply current charges the high energy capacitor to a desired level over time.
    </p>
    <p num="19">In U.S. Pat. No. 4,548,209 to Wielders et al. and in the above-referenced '883 patent, charging circuits are disclosed which employ flyback oscillator voltage converters which step up the power source voltage and apply charging current to output capacitors until the capacitor voltage reaches a programmed shock energy level.</p>
    <p num="20">
      In charging circuit 34 of FIG. 4 in the '209 patent, two series-connected lithium thionyl chloride batteries 50 and 52 are connected to primary coil 54 of transformer 56 and to power FET transistor switch 60.
      <br/>
      Secondary coil 58 is connected through diode 62 to cardioversion energy storage capacitor 64.
      <br/>
      In this circuit, the flyback converter works generally as follows: When switch 60 is closed, current lp passing through primary winding 54 increases linearly as a function of the formula Vp =Lp dl/dt.
      <br/>
      When FET 60 is opened, the flux in the core of transformer 56 cannot change instantaneously, and so complimentary current ls (which is proportional to the number of windings in primary and secondary coils 54 and 58, respectively) starts to flow in secondary winding 58 according to the formula ls =(Np /Ns)lp. Simultaneously, voltage in the secondary winding is developed according to the function Vs =Ls dls /dt, thereby causing charging of cardioversion energy storage capacitor 64 to a programmed voltage.
    </p>
    <p num="21">
      The Power FET 60 is switched "on" at a constant frequency of 32 KHz for a duration or duty cycle that varies as a function of the voltage of the output capacitor reflected back into the primary coil 54 circuit.
      <br/>
      The on-time of power FET 60 is governed by the time interval between the setting and resetting of flip-flop 70, which in turn is governed either by current lp flowing through primary winding 54 or as a function of a time limit circuit containing further circuitry to vary the time limit with battery impedance (represented schematically by resistor 53).
      <br/>
      In both cases, the on-time varies from a maximum to a minimum interval as the output circuit voltage increases to its maximum value.
    </p>
    <p num="22">
      The aforementioned '883 and '006 patents disclose a variable duty cycle flyback oscillator voltage converter, where the current in the primary coil circuit (in the case of the '883 patent) or the voltage across a secondary coil (in the case of the '006 patent) is monitored to control the duty cycle of the oscillator.
      <br/>
      In the '883 circuit the "on" time of the oscillator is constant and the "off" time varies as a function of the monitored current through the transformer.
    </p>
    <p num="23">
      In the '006 patent. a secondary coil is added to power a high voltage regulator circuit that provides V+ to a timer circuit and components of the high voltage oscillator.
      <br/>
      This high voltage power source allows the oscillator circuit to operate independently of the battery source voltage (which may deplete over time).
      <br/>
      The inclusion of a further secondary winding on an already relatively bulky transformer is disadvantageous from size and efficiency standpoints.

    <p num="24">
      Energy, volume, thickness and mass are critical features in the design of implantable cardiac defibrillators (ICDs).
      <br/>
      One of the components important to optimization of those features is the high voltage capacitors used to store the energy required for defibrillation.
      <br/>
      Such capacitors typically deliver energy in the range of about 25 to 40 Joules, while ICDs typically have a volume of about 40 to about 60 cc, a thickness of about 13 mm to about 16 mm and a mass of approximately 100 grams.
    </p>
    <p num="25">
      It is desirable to reduce the volume, thickness and mass of such capacitors and devices without reducing deliverable energy.
      <br/>
      Doing so is beneficial to patient comfort and minimizes complications due to erosion of tissue around the device.
      <br/>
      Reductions in size of the capacitors may also allow for the balanced addition of volume to the battery, thereby increasing longevity of the device, or balanced addition of new components, thereby adding functionality to the device.
      <br/>
      It is also desirable to provide such devices at low cost while retaining the highest level of performance.
    </p>
    <p num="26">
      Most ICDs employ commercial photoflash capacitors similar to those described by Troup in "Implantable Cardioverters and Defibrillators," Current Problems in Cardiology, Volume XIV, Number 12, December 1989, Year Book Medical Publishers, Chicago, and U.S. Pat. No. 4,254,775 for "Implantable Defibrillator and Package Therefor".
      <br/>
      The electrodes in such capacitors are typically spirally wound to form a coiled electrode assembly.
      <br/>
      Most commercial photoflash capacitors contain a core of separator paper intended to prevent brittle anode foils from fracturing during coiling.
      <br/>
      The anode, cathode and separator are typically wound around such a paper core.
      <br/>
      The core limits both the thinness and volume of the ICDs in which they are placed.
      <br/>
      The cylindrical shape of commercial photoflash capacitors also limits the volumetric packaging efficiency and thickness of an ICD made using same.
    </p>
    <p num="27">
      As noted above, electrodes and separators used in the assembly of photoflash capacitors are typically coiled, with a resulting cylindrical capacitor geometry.
      <br/>
      Anodes employed in photoflash capacitors typically comprise one or two layers of a high purity (99.99%), porous, highly etched, anodized aluminum foil.
      <br/>
      Cathode layers in such capacitors are formed of a nonporous, highly etched aluminum foil which may be somewhat less pure (99.7%) respecting aluminum content than the anode layers.
      <br/>
      The thickness of such foils is on the order of 100 micrometers and 20 micrometers for anode foils and cathode foils, respectively.
      <br/>
      The capacitance of the cathode is balanced respecting that of the anode to ensure reliable performance over the life of the device.
      <br/>
      Separating the anode and cathode is a separator material that typically comprises two layers of Kraft paper.
    </p>
    <p num="28">
      Prior art electrolytic capacitors generally include a laminate comprising an etched aluminum foil anode, an aluminum foil of film cathode and a Kraft paper or fabric gauze spacer impregnated with a solvent based liquid electrolyte interposed therebetween.
      <br/>
      A layer of oxide is formed on the aluminum anode, preferably during passage of electrical current through the anode.
      <br/>
      The oxide layer functions as a dielectric layer.
      <br/>
      The entire laminate is rolled up into the form of a substantially cylindrical body and encased, with the aid of suitable insulation, in an aluminum tube or can subsequently sealed with a rubber material.
    </p>
    <p num="29">
      The energy of the capacitor is stored in the electromagnetic field generated by opposing electrical charges separated by an aluminum oxide layer disposed on the surface of the anode.
      <br/>
      The energy so stored is proportional to the surface area of the aluminum anode.
      <br/>
      Thus, to minimize the overall volume of the capacitor one must maximize anode surface area per unit volume without increasing the capacitor's overall (i.e., external) dimensions.
      <br/>
      Separator material, anode and cathode terminals, internal packaging and alignment features and cathode material further increase the thickness and volume of a capacitor.
      <br/>
      Consequently, those and other components in a capacitor limit the extent to which its physical dimensions may be reduced.

      Recently developed flat aluminum electrolytic capacitors have overcome some disadvantages inherent in commercial cylindrical capacitors.
      <br/>
      For example, U.S. Pat. No. 5,131,388 to Pless et. al. discloses a relatively volumetrically efficient flat capacitor having a plurality of planar layers arranged in a stack.
      <br/>
      Each layer contains an anode layer, a cathode layer and means for separating the anode layers and cathode layers (such as paper).

      The anode layers and the cathode layers are electrically connected in parallel.

      In a recent paper "High Energy Density Capacitors for Implantable Defibrillators" presented at CARTS 96: 16th Capacitor and Resistor Technology Symposium, March 11-15, 1996, several improvements in the design of flat aluminum electrolytic capacitors are described.
      <br/>
      Described are the use of a solid adhesive electrolyte for strengthening the separator and allowing use of a thinner separator.
      <br/>
      Also described are a triple anode formed from a non-porous foil disposed between two porous foils.
      <br/>
      By increasing the number of anode foils per anode layer, the total number of separator and cathode layers in a given stack assembly is reduced, thereby decreasing thickness and volume.
      <br/>
      Next described are an embedded anode layer tab, where a notch is cut in the anode and a tab of the same thickness as the center anode is placed in the notch.

      In U.S. Pat. No. 5,522,851 to Fayram, manufacturing improvements in flat capacitors relating to the use of internal alignment elements are disclosed.

      Internal alignment elements are employed as a means for controlling the relative edge spacing of electrode layers and the housing.
      <br/>
      In the absence of such alignment elements, precision assembly by hand may be required, thereby increasing manufacturing costs.
      <br/>
      The housing size must also be increased to provide tolerance for alignment errors, resulting in a bulkier device.

      In assembling a capacitor, it is necessary that the anode and cathode remain separated electrically to prevent short circuiting.
      <br/>
      It is also important that a minimum separation between the anode and cathode be maintained to prevent arcing between the anode and cathode, or between the anode and the case.
      <br/>
      In cylindrical capacitors, such spacing is typically maintained at the electrode edges or peripheries by providing separator overhang at the top and bottom of the anode and cathode winding.

      In addition, the anode and cathode are aligned precisely and coiled tightly to prevent movement of the anode, cathode and separator during subsequent processing and use.

      In flat capacitors, anode to cathode alignment is typically maintained through the use of internal alignment posts (as described, for example, in the '851 patent to Pless et al.) screws (see the '851 patent to Pless et al.) or by using an adhesive electrolyte (see the patents to MacFarlane, supra).

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
    <p num="72">
      FIG. 1 illustrates one embodiment of implantable PCD 10 of the present invention, its associated electrical leads 14, 16 and 18, and their relationship to a human heart 12.
      <br/>
      The leads are coupled to PCD 10 by means of multi-port connector block 20, which contains separate connector ports for each of the three leads illustrated.
      <br/>
      Lead 14 is coupled to subcutaneous electrode 30, which is intended to be mounted subcutaneously in the region of the left chest.
      <br/>
      Lead 16 is a coronary sinus lead employing an elongated coil electrode which is located in the coronary sinus and great vein region of the heart.
      <br/>
      The location of the electrode is illustrated in broken line format at 32, and extends around the heart from a point within the opening of the coronary sinus to a point in the vicinity of the left atrial appendage.
    </p>
    <p num="73">
      Lead 18 is provided with elongated electrode coil 28 which is located in the right ventricle of the heart.
      <br/>
      Lead 18 also includes stimulation electrode 34 which takes the form of an advanceable helical coil which is screwed into the myocardial tissue of the right ventricle.
      <br/>
      Lead 18 may also include one or more additional electrodes for near and far field electrogram sensing.
      <br/>
      A more detailed description of the leads illustrated can be found in the aforementioned '407 patent.
      <br/>
      However, the invention is also believed workable in the context of multiple electrode systems employing different sets of electrodes, including superior vena cava electrodes and epicardial patch electrodes.
    </p>
    <p num="74">
      In the system illustrated, cardiac pacing pulses are delivered between helical electrode 34 and elongated electrode 28.
      <br/>
      Electrodes 28 and 34 are also employed to sense electrical signals indicative of ventricular contractions.
      <br/>
      As illustrated, it is anticipated that the right ventricular electrode 28 will serve as the common electrode during sequential and simultaneous pulse multiple electrode defibrillation regimens.
      <br/>
      For example, during a simultaneous pulse defibrillation regimen, pulses would simultaneously be delivered between electrode 28 and electrode 30 and between electrode 28 and electrode 32.
      <br/>
      During sequential pulse defibrillation, it is envisioned that pulses would be delivered sequentially between subcutaneous electrode 30 and electrode 28 and between coronary sinus electrode 32 and right ventricular electrode 28.
      <br/>
      Single pulse, two electrode defibrillation pulse regimens may be also provided, typically between electrode 28 and coronary sinus electrode 32.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, single pulses may be delivered between electrodes 28 and 30.
      <br/>
      The particular interconnection of the electrodes to an implantable PCD will depend somewhat on which specific single electrode pair defibrillation pulse regimen is believed more likely to be employed.
    </p>
    <p num="75">
      FIG. 2 is a block diagram illustrating the interconnection of high voltage output circuit 40, high voltage charging circuit 64 and capacitors 265 according to one embodiment of the present invention with a prior art implantable PCD.
      <br/>
      As illustrated, the device is controlled by means of a stored program in microprocessor 42, which performs all necessary computational functions within the device.
      <br/>
      Microprocessor 42 is linked to control circuitry 44 by means of bidirectional data/control bus 46, and thereby controls operation of the output circuitry 40 and the high voltage charging circuitry 64.
      <br/>
      On reprogramming of the device or on the occurrence of signals indicative of delivery of cardiac pacing pulses or of the occurrence of cardiac contractions, pace/sense circuitry 78 will awaken microprocessor 42 to perform any necessary mathematical calculations, to perform tachycardia and fibrillation detection procedures and to update the time intervals controlled by the timers in pace/sense circuitry 78.
    </p>
    <p num="76">
      The basic operation of such a system in the context of an implantable PCD may correspond to any of the systems known in the art.
      <br/>
      More particularly, the flat aluminum electrolytic capacitor of the present invention may be employed generally in conjunction with the various systems illustrated in the aforementioned '209, '585, '006, '883 and '817 patents, or in conjunction with the various systems or components disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,693,253 to Adams, 5,188,105 to Keimel, 5,591,212 to Keimel, 5,383,909 to Keimel, 5,354,316 to Keimel, 5,336,253 to Gordon et al., 4,384,585 to Zipes, 4,949,719 to Pless et al., 4,374,817 to Engle et al., 4,577,633 to Berkowitz, 4,880,005 to Pless et al., 4,726,380 to Vollmann et al., 4,587,970 to Holley et al., 5,447,519 to Peterson, 4,476,868 to Thompson, 4,556,063 to Thompson, 4,379,459 to Stein, 5,312,453 to Wybomy, 5,545,186 to Olson, 5,345,316 to Keimel, 5,314,430 to Bardy, 5,131,388 to Pless, 3,888,260 to Fischell, 5,411,537 to Munshi et al. and 4,821,723 to Baker et al.

    <p num="77">
      Control circuitry 44 provides three signals of primary importance to output circuitry 40 of the present invention.
      <br/>
      Those signals include the first and second control signals discussed above, labeled here as ENAB, line 48, and ENBA, line 50.
      <br/>
      Also of importance is DUMP line 52 which initiates discharge of the output capacitors and VCAP line 54 which provides a signal indicative of the voltage stored on the output capacitors C1, C2, to control circuitry 44.
      <br/>
      Defibrillation electrodes 28, 30 and 32 illustrated in FIG. 1, above, are shown coupled to output circuitry 40 by means of conductors 22, 24 and 26.
      <br/>
      For ease of understanding, those conductors are also labeled as "COMMON", "HVA" and "HVB".
      <br/>
      However, other configurations are also possible.
      <br/>
      For example, subcutaneous electrode 30 may be coupled to HVB conductor 26, to allow for a single pulse regimen to be delivered between electrodes 28 and 30.
      <br/>
      During a logic signal on ENAB, line 48, a cardioversion/defibrillation pulse is delivered between electrode 30 and electrode 28.
      <br/>
      During a logic signal on ENBA, line 50, a cardioversion/defibrillation pulse is delivered between electrode 32 and electrode 28.
    </p>
    <p num="78">
      The output circuitry of the present invention includes a capacitor bank, including capacitors C1 and C2 and diodes 121 and 123, used for delivering defibrillation pulses to the electrodes.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, the capacitor bank may include a further set of capacitors as depicted in the above referenced '758 application.
      <br/>
      In FIG. 2, capacitors 265 are illustrated in conjunction with high voltage charging circuitry 64, controlled by the control/timing circuitry 44 by means of CHDR line 66.
      <br/>
      As illustrated, capacitors 265 are charged by means of a high frequency, high voltage transformer 110.
      <br/>
      Proper charging polarities are maintained by means of the diodes 121 and 123.
      <br/>
      VCAP line 54 provides a signal indicative of the voltage on the capacitor bank, and allows for control of the high voltage charging circuitry and for termination of the charging function when the measured voltage equals the programmed charging level.

      The present invention is believed workable, however, in the context of any known R-wave amplification system.
      <br/>
      Pace/sense circuitry 78 also includes a pulse generator for generating cardiac pacing pulses, which may also correspond to any known cardiac pacemaker output circuitry and includes timing circuitry for defining ventricular pacing intervals, refractory intervals and blanking intervals, under control of microprocessor 42 via control/data bus 80.

      Pace/sense circuitry 78 is coupled to helical electrode 34 illustrated in FIG. 1 by means of a conductor 36.

      FIG. 4 shows an exploded view of one embodiment of a single anode/cathode sub-assembly 227 capacitor 265 of the present invention.

      The capacitor design described herein employs a stacked configuration, where anode/cathode sub-assembly 227 comprises alternating substantially rectangularly-shaped anode layers 185 and cathode layers 175, with substantially rectangularly-shaped separator layers 180 being interposed therebetween.
      <br/>
      In one preferred embodiment of the present invention, two individual separator layers 180 are disposed between anode sub-assembly 170 and cathode layer 175.
      <br/>
      One anode layer 185a has anode tab 195d attached thereto, more about which we say below.

      Cathode layer 175d most preferably has cathode tab 176 formed integral thereto and projecting from the periphery thereof.
    </p>
    <p num="96">
      The shapes of anode layers 185, cathode layers 175 and separator layers 180 are primarily a matter of design choice, and are dictated largely by the shape or configuration of case 90 within which those layers are ultimately disposed.
      <br/>
      In a die apparatus according to one preferred method of the present invention, the punch and cavity of the present invention employed in forming those layers should be configured to produce layers having a desired predetermined shape, such as those shown in FIG. 4.
      <br/>
      A principal advantage of the capacitor construction of the present invention is that anode layers 185, cathode layers 175 and separator layers 180 may assume any arbitrary shape to optimize packaging efficiency.

      <br/>
      Cathode layers 175 are preferably high purity and are comparatively flexible.
      <br/>
      Paper separators 180 are most preferably made slightly larger than cathode layers 175 and anode layers 185 to ensure that a physical barrier is disposed between the anodes and the cathodes of the finished capacitor.

      Likewise, a plurality of anode layers 185 and separator layers 180 is most preferably disposed within each sub-assembly, while a single cathode layer 175 is disposed within each sub-assembly 227.

      Anode layers 185 and 190 are formed of anode foil 65 (not shown in the Figures).
      <br/>
      It has been discovered that the anode foil of the present invention is most preferably through-etched, has a high specific capacitance (at least about 0.3, at least about 0.5 or most preferably at least about 0.8 microfarads/cm2), has a dielectric withstand parameter of at least 425 Volts DC, a thickness ranging between about 50 and about 200 micrometers, more preferably between about 75 and 150 micrometers, more preferably yet between about 90 and about 125 micrometers, and most preferably being about 100 micrometers thick, and a cleanliness of about 1.0 mg/m2 respecting projected area maximum chloride contamination.

      Thin anode foils are preferred in the present invention, especially if they substantially maintain or increase specific capacitance while reducing the thickness of electrode assembly 225, or maintain the thickness of electrode assembly 225 while increasing overall capacitance.

      <br/>
      Suitable anode foils for practicing the present invention are commercially available on a widespread basis.
    </p>
    <p num="105">
      Cathode layers 175 are most preferably formed from cathode foil 70 (not shown in the Figures).
      <br/>
      Some preferred parameters of cathode foil have been discovered to include high surface area (i.e., highly etched cathode foil), high specific capacitance (preferably at least 200 microfarads/cm2, and at least 250 microfarads/cm2 when fresh), a thickness of about 30 micrometers, a cleanliness of about 1.0 mg/m2 respecting projected area maximum chloride contamination, and a purity which may be less than corresponding to the starting foil material from which anode foil 65 is made.
    </p>
    <p num="106">In one preferred embodiment of the present invention, cathode foil 70 has an initial purity of at least 99% aluminum, and more preferably yet of about 99.4% aluminum, a final thickness of about 30 micrometers, and an initial specific capacitance of about 250 microfarads per square centimeter.</p>
    <p num="107">In other embodiments of the present invention, cathode foil 70 has a specific capacitance ranging between about 100 and about 500 microfarads/cm2, about 200 and about 400 microfarads/cm2, or about 250 and about 350 microfarads/cm2, a thickness ranging between about 10 and about 150 micrometers, about 15 and about 100 micrometers, about 20 and about 50 micrometers, or about 25 and about 40 micrometers.</p>
    <p num="108">
      It is generally preferred that the specific capacitance of cathode foil 70 be as high as possible, and that cathode layer 175 be as thin as possible.
      <br/>
      For example, it is contemplated in the present invention that individual cathode layers 175 have specific capacitances of about 100 microfarads/cm2, about 200 microfarads/cm2, about 300 microfarads/cm2, about 400 microfarads cm2, about 500 microfarads/cm2, about 600 microfarads/cm2, about 700 microfarads/cm2, about 800 microfarads/cm2, about 900 microfarads/cm2, or about 1,000 microfarads/cm2.

    <p num="109">In still other embodiments of the present invention, cathode foil 70 is formed of materials or metals in addition to aluminum, aluminum alloys and "pure" aluminum.</p>
    <p num="110">
      Separator layers 180 are most preferably made from a roll or sheet of separator material 75.
      <br/>
      In one preferred embodiment, separator material 75 is a pure cellulose, very low halide or chloride content Kraft paper having a thickness of about 0.0005 inches, a density of about 1.06 grams/cm3, a dielectric strength of 1,400 ac Volts per 0.001 inches thickness, and a low number of conducting paths (about 0.4/ft2 or less).
      <br/>
      Separator layers 180 are preferably cut slightly larger than anode layers 170 and cathode layers 175 to accommodate misalignment during the stacking of layers and to prevent subsequent shorting between electrodes of opposite polarity.
    </p>
    <p num="111">
      It is preferred that separator layers 180 be formed of a material that: (a) is chemically inert; (b) is chemically compatible with the selected electrolyte; (c) may be impregnated with the electrolyte to produce a low resistance path between adjoining anode and cathode layers, and (d) physically separates adjoining anode and cathode layers.
      <br/>
      Separator layers 180 may also be formed of materials other than Kraft paper, such as Manila paper, porous polymeric materials or fabric gauze materials.
      <br/>
      For example, porous polymeric materials may be disposed between anode and cathode layers of like those disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,555,369 and 3,883,784 in some embodiments of the present invention.
    </p>
    <p num="112">
      In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, a liquid electrolyte saturates or wets separator layers 180 and is disposed within case 90.

      It will also be understood by those skilled in the art that there exist many different types and methods for making anode 65, cathode foil 70 and separator material 75.

      What we disclose herein, therefore, are only preferred materials, methods and apparatus for making a preferred embodiment of capacitor 265 of the present invention, and its various components, and not all the materials, methods and apparatus suitable for practicing the present invention and falling within the scope thereof.
    </p>
    <p num="114">
      Continuing to refer to FIG. 4, a first preferred step in assembling a flat aluminum electrolytic capacitor is to cut anode layers 185 and 190, anode tabs 195, cathode layers 175 and separator layers 180.
      <br/>
      Those components are most preferably cut to shape using dies having low wall-to-wall clearance, where inter-wall spacing between the substantially vertically-oriented corresponding walls of the punch and die is most preferably on the order of about 6 millionths of an inch per side.
      <br/>
      Larger or smaller inter-wall spacings between the substantially vertically-oriented corresponding walls of the punch and cavity, such as about 2, about 4, about 5, about 7, about 8, about 10 and about 12 millionths of an inch may also be employed in the present invention but are less preferred.
    </p>
    <p num="115">
      Such low clearance results in smooth, burr free edges being formed along the peripheries of anode layers 185 and 190, anode tabs 195, cathode layers 175 and separator layers 180.
      <br/>
      Smooth, burr free edges on the walls of the dies have been discovered to be critical respecting reliable performance of a capacitor.
    </p>
    <p num="116">
      The presence of burrs along the peripheries of anode layers 185 and 190, anode tabs 195, cathode layers 175 and separator layers 180 may result in short circuit and failure of the capacitor.
      <br/>
      The means by which anode foil, cathode foil and separator materials are cut or formed in the present invention may have a significant impact on the lack or presence of burrs and other cutting debris disposed about the peripheries of the formed or cut members.
      <br/>
      We have found that the use of low clearance dies produces an edge superior to that of other cutting methods, such as steel rule dies.
      <br/>
      The shape, flexibility and speed of a low clearance die has been discovered to be superior to that of laser or blade cutting.
    </p>
    <p num="117">Other methods of cutting or forming anode layers 185 and 190, anode tabs 195, cathode layers 175 and separator layers 180 falling within the scope of the present invention include, but are not limited to, steel rule die cutting, laser cutting, water jet cutting and blade cutting.</p>
    <p num="118">
      The preferred low clearance of the die apparatus of the present invention is especially important for cutting thin ductile materials such as cathode foil 70.
      <br/>
      In addition to improving reliability, burr and debris reduction permits reductions in the thickness of separator layer 180, thereby improving energy density of the capacitor.
      <br/>
      Angle cutting, where the face of the punch is not held parallel to the opposing floor of the die during the cutting step, is another less preferred method of cutting or forming anode layers 185 and 190, anode tabs 195, cathode layers 175 and separator layers 180 of the present invention.
    </p>
    <p num="119">
      It is preferred in the present invention to cut or otherwise form separator layer 180 such that its outer periphery conforms closely to that of the corresponding sidewalls of the interior of case 90.
      <br/>
      In preferred embodiments of the present invention, the periphery of separator layer is disposed within plus or minus 0.009 inches of the corresponding sidewalls of case 90.
      <br/>
      Such close conformity between the periphery of separator layer 180 and the corresponding internal sidewalls of case 90 has been discovered to provide the advantage of permitting separator layers 180 to immobilize or secure firmly in place electrode assembly 225 in case 90.
      <br/>
      This immobilization occurs because the separator paper forming separator layers 180 swells after electrolyte is added through fill port ferrule 105 into otherwise assembled and sealed capacitor 265.
    </p>
    <p num="120">
      In a preferred method of the present invention, foil or separator materials are drawn between the punch and cavity portions of a die having appropriate clearances on a roll.
      <br/>
      An air or hydraulically actuated press is then most preferably employed to actuate the punch or cavity portion of the die.
      <br/>
      The punch portion of the die is most preferably formed of hardened tool steel, or has other suitable wear resistant materials or coatings disposed on the cutting surfaces thereof.
      <br/>
      When the cavity of the die is aligned vertically, the punch portion of the die may travel either upwards or downwards towards the die cavity during a cutting cycle.
      <br/>
      In the former case, components are cut and drop downwardly into a container for use in subsequent assembly operations.
      <br/>
      In the latter case, components are cut and may be presented directly to automated assembly equipment, such as robots equipped with vacuum or other pick-up tooling, for subsequent processing.

      Low clearance dies of the type described herein may be supplied by Top Tool, Inc. of Minneapolis, Minn.

      Anode sub-assembly 170 most preferably includes one notched anode layer 190, which facilitates appropriate placement and positioning of anode tab 195 within anode sub-assembly 170.

      It is preferred that the remaining anode layers of anode sub-assembly 170 be non-notched anode layers 185.

      Cold welds 205 and 210 in anode sub-assembly 170 are formed by compression forces generated when cold weld pins 206a, 206b, 211a and 211b are compressed thereagainst.
      <br/>
      See FIG. 6(a), where the preferred regions in which cold welds 205 and 210 are formed are shown.
      <br/>
      Cold welds 205 and 210 may be described as not only cold welds, but forged welds.
      <br/>
      This is because the interfacial boundaries between anode layers 185 are deformed in the region of welds 205 and 210, thereby disrupting oxide layers and bringing base metals into direct contact with one another where metallic bonding occurs.
      <br/>
      Metallic bonding increases the strength of the welds.

      In one embodiment of the method of the present invention, a plurality of pneumatic cylinders function simultaneously in upper actuation apparatus 214 and lower actuation apparatus 215 to drive pins 206a, 206b, 211a and 211b against anode sub-assembly 170.
      <br/>
      Anode layer cold weld 205 and anode tab cold weld 210 are most preferably formed under direct constant load conditions, where pneumatic cylinders are pressurized to a predetermined fixed pressure.
      <br/>
      Anode layer cold weld 205 and anode tab cold weld 210 may also be formed under indirect constant displacement conditions, where pneumatic cylinders are pressurized until a displacement sensor placed across cold welding pins 206a, 206b, 211a or 211b generates a signal having a predetermined value, whereupon those pins are disengaged from sub-assembly 227.

      Anode layer cold weld 205 and anode tab cold weld 210 are formed under direct constant displacement conditions, where cantilever beams are actuated and cause upper and lower members 208 and 207 to engage sub-assembly 227 until a hard stop point is reached.
      <br/>
      An indirect load controlled system may also be employed in apparatus 214 and apparatus 215, where cantilever or other means include a load measuring sensor for controlling the stop point of the cantilever beam, for example, when a predetermined load is measured by the sensor.

      The cross-sectional shape of cold weld pins 206a, 206b, 211a and 211b may be square, circular, oval or any other suitable shape.

      The shape of the ends of cold weld pins 206a, 206b, 211a and 211b may be flat, rounded, domed or any other suitable shape appropriate for selectively controlling the properties of the cold welds produced therein.
      <br/>
      Likewise, more or fewer than four cold weld pins may be employed in the present invention.
      <br/>
      The ends of cold weld pins 206a, 206b, 211a and 211b are most preferably rounded or domed and circular in cross-section.

      In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, cold weld pins 206a, 206b, 211a and 211b have a diameter of about 0.060" and further have a beveled or radiused end.
      <br/>
      Cold weld pins 206a, 206b, 211a and 211b are preferably made from a high strength material that does not readily deform under the pressures obtained during welding, such as stainless steel, titanium, tool steel or HSLA steel.
      <br/>
      The ends or sidewalls of cold welding pins 206a, 206b, 211a and 211b may be coated, cladded or otherwise modified to increase wear resistance, deformation resistance or other desirable tribilogical attributes of the pins.

      The primary function of cold welds 205 and 210 is to provide electrical interconnections between layers 185a, 185b, 185c and 190 and anode tab 195, while minimizing the overall thickness of anode sub-assembly 170 in the regions of welds 205 and 210.
      <br/>
      We have discovered that typical prior art commercial cylindrical capacitors exhibit a significant increase in the thickness of the anode layer in the regions of the cold welds.
      <br/>
      This increase in thickness is typically on the order of about two times the thickness of the tab, or about 0.008 inches.
      <br/>
      In the case of cylindrical capacitors where only one or two non-coincident tab connections are present, the overall effect on anode layer thickness may be minimal.
      <br/>
      In a stacked layer design having many more interconnections and welds, however, increases in weld zone thickness have been found to significantly increase the overall thickness of the anode layer and the capacitor.
    </p>
    <p num="131">
      In one method and corresponding apparatus of the present invention, no or an inappreciable net increase in anode sub-assembly 170 thickness results when cold weld geometries and formation processes are appropriately optimized.

      Several embodiments of anode-assembly 170 have been found to have no more than about a 20% increase in layer thickness due to the presence of cold welds, as compared to about a 200% increase in thickness resulting from cold welds found in some commercial cylindrical capacitors.
      <br/>
      In the present invention, two, three, four, five, six or more anode layers 185 and 190 may be cold-welded to form anode sub-assembly 170.

      <br/>
      Pins 206a and 206b form central depressions 293 and 294, respectively, in anode sub-assembly 170d, and further result in the formation of rims 295 and 296, respectively.
      <br/>
      Rims 295 and 296 project downwardly and upwardly, respectively, from the surrounding surfaces of anode subassembly 170d, thereby increasing the overall thickness T of anode subassembly 170d by  DELTA T in respect of the non-cold-welded surrounding regions or portions thereof.

      Rims 299 and 301 project downwardly and upwardly, respectively, from the surface of anode subassembly 170d, thereby increasing overall thickness T of anode subassembly 170d by  DELTA T in respect of the noncold-welded regions thereof.

    <p num="134">
      Anode subassembly 170d has a thickness defined by the equation:

      <br/>
      The maximum overall thickness of anode subassembly 170d in the region of cold welds 205 or 210 is then defined by the equation:

    <p num="136">T+ DELTA T=nt+ DELTA T</p>
    <p num="137">
      We have discovered that it is highly desirable to form anode subassembly such that the ratio  DELTA T/T is less than or equal to 0.05, 0.1, 0.15, 0.20, 0.25, 0.30, 0.35, 0.40, 0.45 or 0.50. The lower the value of the ratio  DELTA T/T, the greater the volumetric efficiency of capacitor 265.
      <br/>
      Additionally, the overall thickness of capacitor 265 may be reduced when the value of the ratio  DELTA T/T is made smaller.
    </p>
    <p num="138">
      Referring now to FIG. 6(a), we have further discovered that the overall thickness of electrode assembly 225 may be reduced further by staggering or offsetting horizontally the respective vertical locations of tabs 195a through 195h (and corresponding cold welds 210).
      <br/>
      In this embodiment of the present invention, tabs 195a 195b, for example, are not aligned vertically in respect of one another.
      <br/>
      Such staggering or offsetting of tabs 195 permits the increases in thickness  DELTA T corresponding to each of anode subassemblies 170a through 170h to be spread out horizontally over the perimeter or other portion of electrode assembly 225 such that increases in thickness  DELTA T do not accumulate or add constructively, thereby decreasing the overall thickness of electrode assembly 225.
      <br/>
      Cold welds 205 may similarly be staggered or offset horizontally respecting one another and cold weld 210 to achieve a reduction in overall thickness of electrode assembly 225.

      In another embodiment of the present invention, anode sub-assembly 170 comprises a plurality of three, four, five or more anode layers 185 and 190, each sub-assembly most preferably having at least one anode layer having a corresponding anode tab 195 attached thereto or forming a portion thereof, the layers being cold welded together to form anode sub-assembly 170.
      <br/>
      For example, an anode sub-assembly 170 may comprise six anode layers 185 constructed by cold-welding two separate triple anode layers 185 that were previously and separately cold-welded or otherwise joined together.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, anode sub-assembly 170 layer may comprise seven anode layers constructed by cold-welding together one triple anode layer 185 and one quadruple anode layer 185 that were previously and separately cold-welded or otherwise joined together.

      The geometry of base plate 207 and top plate 208 in the regions surrounding cold welding pins 206a, 206b, 211a and 211b has been discovered to affect the properties of cold welds 205 and 210.
      <br/>
      In a preferred method of the present invention, the mating surfaces of plates 207 and 208 surfaces have no radiused break formed in the perimeters of the pin holes.
      <br/>
      We have found that the presence of radiused breaks or chamfers in those regions may cause undesired deformation of cold welds 205 and 210 therein.
      <br/>
      Such deformation may result in an increase in the thickness of anode sub-assembly 170, which may translate directly into an increase in the thickness of capacitor 265.

      Note further that the increase in thickness so resulting is a multiple of the number of anode sub-assemblies 170 present in electrode assembly 225.

    <p num="142">Outer wrap 115 is most preferably die cut from separator material 75 described supra, but may be formed from a wide range of other suitable materials such as polymeric materials, aluminum, suitable heat shrink materials, suitable rubberized materials and synthetic equivalents or derivatives thereof, and the like.</p>

      Outer wrap 115 and wrapping tape 245 together comprise an electrode assembly wrap which has been discovered to help prevent undesired movement or shifting of electrode assembly 225 during subsequent processing.
      <br/>
      It will now become apparent to one skilled in the art that many means other than those disclosed explicitly herein exist for immobilizing and securing electrode assembly 225 during subsequent processing which accomplish substantially the same function as the electrode assembly wrap comprising outer wrap 115 and wrapping tape 245.
      <br/>
      Alternative means for immobilizing and securing electrode assembly 225 other than those described hereinabove exist.
      <br/>
      Such alternative means include, but are not limited to, robotic or other mechanical clamping and securing means not necessarily forming a portion of electrode assembly 225, adhesive electrolytes for forming separator layers 180, and so on.

    <p num="145">
      The stacking process by which electrode assembly 225 is most preferably made begins by placing outer wrap 115 into a stacking fixture followed by placing outer paper or separator layer 165a thereon.
      <br/>
      Next, cathode layer 175a is placed atop separator layer 165a, followed by separator layers 180a and 180b being disposed thereon.
      <br/>
      Cold-welded anode sub-assembly 170a is then placed atop separator layer 180b, followed by placing separator layers 180a and 180b thereon, and so on.
      <br/>
      The placement of alternating cathode layers 175 and anode layers 170 with separator layers 180a and 180b interposed therebetween continues in the stacking fixture until final cathode layer 175h has been placed thereon.

    <p num="146">
      In the embodiment of electrode assembly 225 shown in FIG. 6(a), eight anode sub-assemblies (anode sub-assemblies 170a through 170h) and nine cathode layers (cathode layers 175a through 175i) are illustrated.
      <br/>
      The voltage developed across each combined anode sub-assembly/separator layer/cathode layer assembly disposed within electrode assembly 225 most preferably ranges between about 360 and about 390 Volts DC.
      <br/>
      As described below, the various anode sub-assemblies of electrode assembly 225 are typically connected in parallel electrically, as are the various cathode layers of electrode assembly 225.
    </p>
    <p num="147">
      Consistent with the discussion hereinabove concerning FIG. 4, it will now be understood by one skilled in the art that electrode assembly 225 shown in FIG. 6(a) is merely illustrative, and does not limit the scope of the present invention in any way respecting the number or combination of anode sub-assemblies 170, cathode layers 175, separator layers 180, anode tabs 195, cathode tabs 176, and so on.
      <br/>
      The number of electrode components is instead determined according to the total capacitance required, the total area of each layer, the specific capacitance of the foil employed and other factors.
    </p>
    <p num="148">
      In another embodiment of electrode assembly 225 of the present invention, the number of anode layers 185 employed in each anode sub-assembly 170 is varied in the stack.
      <br/>
      Such a design permits the fabrication of capacitors having the same layer area but nearly continuously varying different and selectable total capacitances that a user may determine by increasing or decreasing the number of anode layers 180 included in selected anode sub-assemblies 170 (as opposed to adding or subtracting full anode/cathode sub-assemblies 227 from electrode assembly 225 to thereby change the total capacitance).
      <br/>
      Following placement of cathode layer 175l in the stack, outer paper layer 165b is placed thereon, and outer wrap 115 is folded over the top of electrode assembly 225.
      <br/>
      Wrapping tape 245 is then holds outer wrap 115 in place and secures the various components of electrode assembly 225 together.

    <p num="149">
      The physical dimensions of separator layers 165 and 180 are most preferably somewhat larger than those of anode sub-assemblies 170 and cathode layers 175 to prevent contact of the electrodes with the case wall or electrical shorting between opposing polarity electrode layers due to the presence of burrs, stray or particulate material, debris or imperfections occurring therein.
      <br/>
      The reliability and functionality of capacitor 265 are compromised if a portion of anode sub-assembly 170 comes into contact with a conducting case wall, if a burr on the periphery of anode sub-assembly 170 or cathode layer 175 comes into contact with an adjoining layer of opposing polarity, or if separator layer 180a or 180b does not provide sufficient electrical insulation between adjoining opposite-polarity electrode layers and conducting particulate matter bridges the gap therebetween.
    </p>
    <p num="150">
      The additional separator material most preferably disposed about the periphery of electrode assembly 225 is referred to herein as separator overhang.
      <br/>
      Decreasing the amount of separator overhang increases the energy density of capacitor 265.
      <br/>
      It is beneficial from an energy density optimization perspective, therefore, to decrease the amount or degree of separator overhang.
      <br/>
      The amount of separator overhang required has been discovered to be primarily a function of the stack-up tolerance characteristic of the stacking method employed.
    </p>
    <p num="151">
      In commercial cylindrical capacitors, we discovered that the amount of separator overhang is typically on the order of 0.050"to 0.100". Fayram et al. in the foregoing '851 patent describe a flat aluminum electrolytic capacitor wherein the housing of the capacitor has at least two internal alignment members.
      <br/>
      Those alignment members necessarily add volume to the capacitor while taking away from the total amount of "active" electrode material available, thereby decreasing the energy density of the capacitor.

      We discovered a method of the present invention for assuring consistent registration of separator layers 165 and 180, anode sub-assemblies 170 and cathode layers 175 in electrode assembly 225: stacking the various elements of electrode assembly 225 using robotic assembly techniques.
      <br/>
      More particularly, the various electrode and separator layers of electrode assembly 225 are stacked and aligned using an assembly workcell comprising four Seiko 4-axis SCARA Model No. TT8800 and TT8500, or equivalent, to pick up and place the various electrode and separator elements in an appropriate stacking fixture.
      <br/>
      Other suitable methods of the present invention for stacking and registering electrode and separator layers include cam driven walking beam assembly machine techniques, rotary table machine techniques, multiple station single stacking machine techniques, and the like.

    <p num="153">
      In a preferred method of the present invention, a pre-formed or cut separator, electrode layer or sub-assembly is presented to a robot arm, which then picks the part up with end-of-arm tooling.
      <br/>
      A Venturi system produces a vacuum in the end-of-arm tooling.
      <br/>
      The system creates a vacuum at an appropriate time such that the part is sucked up onto the end-of-arm tooling.
      <br/>
      The vacuum is next released when the part is placed in the stacking fixture.
      <br/>
      A direct vacuum system, such as rubber suction cups, or other contact or non-contact pick up robotic or manual assembly methods may also be employed in accordance with other methods of the present invention.
      <br/>
      The position of the part is robotically translated from the pickup point into the stacking fixture by the robot arm with an accuracy of 5 thousands of an inch or less, After placing the part in the stacking fixture, part alignment is most preferably verified electronically with a SEIKO COGNEX 5400 VISION System, or equivalent, in combination with a SONY XC-75 camera, or equivalent.
      <br/>
      The camera is mounted on the robot arm to permit the accuracy of part placement to be verified.

      This system can accurately determine the position of each part or element in electrode assembly 225 to within 0.01 millimeters.

    <p num="155">
      We discovered another method for assuring registration of separator layers 165 and 180, anode sub-assembly 170 and cathode layer 175 in electrode assembly 225, wherein alignment elements disposed within the stacking fixture are employed in a manual process which utilizes fixture registration points.
      <br/>
      In such a method, the stacking fixture has several alignment elements such as posts or sidewalls disposed about its periphery for positioning separator layers 165 and 180.
      <br/>
      Because cathode layers 175 and anode sub-assemblies 170 do not extend to the periphery of the separator, an alternative means for accurately positioning those electrodes becomes necessary.

    <p num="156">
      Positioning of alternating cathode layers 175 and anode sub-assemblies 170 is most preferably accomplished using alignment elements such as posts or sidewalls disposed about the periphery of cathode tab 176 and anode tab 195.
      <br/>
      It has been discovered that the accuracy of layer placement and positioning is primarily a function of the length of the electrode tabs.
      <br/>
      The longer the tab, the less significant the alignment error becomes.
      <br/>
      Electrode tab length must typically be balanced against the loss of electrode material which occurs during die cutting, which in turn results primarily due to the longer length of cathode tab 176 in respect of the length of anode tab 195.
      <br/>
      Tabs 176 and 195 may include or contain alignment features therein having any suitable geometry for facilitating registration and positioning in respect of alignment elements.
      <br/>
      Any additional tab length utilized for registration of the electrode layers is most preferably trimmed from electrode assembly 225 during the process of electrode tab interconnection (more about which we say below).

      Another method of the present invention for ensuring registration of separator layers 165 and 180, anode sub-assembly 170 and cathode layer 175 in electrode assembly 225 which does not require the use of internal alignment elements within capacitor 265 is enveloping or covering anode sub-assembly 170 and cathode layer 175 with separator material.
      <br/>
      In this method of the present invention, separator layers 180a and 180b are combined into a single die cut piece part that is folded around either anode sub-assembly 170 or cathode layer 175.
      <br/>
      The free edges of the separator are then secured by doubled-sided transfer tape, another adhesive, stitching or ultrasonic paper welding.

      Construction of an electrode subassembly in this manner secures and registers anode sub-assembly 170 and cathode layer 175 in respect of the periphery of the separator envelope so formed.

    <p num="158">
      Yet another method of the present invention we have found for securing the separator to anode sub-assembly 170 is through the use of pressure bonding techniques.

      Feedthroughs 120 and 125 provide electrical feedthrough terminals for capacitor 265 and gather anode tabs 232 and cathode tabs 233 within basal portions 121 and 126 for electrical and mechanical interconnection.
    </p>
    <p num="161">
      FIG. 16 shows a flow chart corresponding to one method of making tab interconnections and feedthrough terminal connections of the present invention.
      <br/>
      In such a method, feedthrough wire is first provided for construction of feedthroughs 120 and 125, as shown in FIGS. 9 and 10. In one embodiment of the present invention, a preferred feedthrough wire is aluminum having a purity greater than or equal to 99.99% and a diameter of 0.020 inches.
      <br/>
      Wire is trimmed to predetermined lengths for use in anode feedthrough 120 or cathode feedthrough 125.
      <br/>
      One end of the trimmed wire is coiled such that its inside diameter or dimension is slightly larger than the diameter or dimension required to encircle gathered anode tabs 232 or gathered cathode tabs 233.
    </p>
    <p num="162">
      Anode tabs 232 are next gathered, or brought together in a bundle by crimping, and inside diameter 131 of anode feedthrough coil assembly 120 is placed over anode tabs 232 such that anode feedthrough pin 130 extends outwardly away from the base of anode tabs 232.
      <br/>
      Similarly, cathode tabs 233 are gathered and inside diameter 136 of cathode feedthrough coil assembly 125 is placed over cathode tabs 233 such that cathode feedthrough pin 135 extends outwardly away from the base of cathode tab 233.
      <br/>
      Coiled basal portions 121 and 126 of anode and cathode feedthroughs 120 and 125 are then most preferably crimped onto anode and cathode tabs 232 and 233, followed by trimming the distal ends thereof, most preferably such that the crimps so formed are oriented substantially perpendicular to imaginary axes 234 and 235 of tabs 232 and 233.
      <br/>
      Trimming the distal ends may also, but less preferably, be accomplished at other non-perpendicular angles respecting imaginary axes 234 and 235.
    </p>
    <p num="163">
      In some methods of the present invention, a crimping force is applied to feedthrough coils 130 and 135 and tabs 232 and 233 throughout a subsequent preferred welding step.
      <br/>
      In one method of the present invention, it is preferred that the crimped anode and cathode feedthroughs be laser or ultrasonically welded along the top portion of the trimmed edge of the distal ends to anode and cathode tabs 232 and 233.
    </p>
    <p num="164">Following welding of feedthroughs 120 and 125 to anode tabs 232 and cathode tabs 233, respectively, pins 130 and 135 are bent to insertion through feedthrough holes 142 and 143 of case 90.</p>
    <p num="165">
      Many different embodiments of the feedthroughs, and means for connecting the feedthroughs, of the present invention to anode and cathode tabs exist other than those shown explicitly in the Figures.
      <br/>
      For example, feedthroughs of the present invention include within their scope embodiments comprising basal portions having open sides, forming "U" or "T" shapes in cross-section, forming a coil having a single turn of wire, forming a coil having three or more turns of wire, formed from flattened wire, or basal portions formed from crimping sleeves or layers of metal for connecting feedthrough pins 130 and 135 to anode and cathode tabs 232 and 233.
    </p>
    <p num="166">
      FIG. 17 shows a flow chart corresponding to one method of the present invention for making tab interconnections and feedthrough connections.
      <br/>
      In this method, anode feedthrough 120 and cathode feedthrough 125 have no coiled portions.
      <br/>
      Anode tabs 232 and cathode tabs 233 are gathered and trimmed, followed by the basal portions of anode and cathode feedthroughs 120 and 125 being placed propinquant to anode tabs 232 and cathode tabs 233, respectively.
      <br/>
      The basal portions of feedthroughs 120 and 125 are then joined to anode tabs 232 and cathode tabs 233, respectively, most preferably by ultrasonic welding means.
    </p>
    <p num="167">
      In yet another method of the present invention, the basal portions of feedthroughs 120 and 125 are flattened to facilitate welding to anode and cathode tabs 232 and 233.
      <br/>
      In still another method of the present invention, the basal portions of feedthrough pins 130 and 135 are formed such that they engage anode tabs 232 or cathode tabs 233 around the periphery of the tabs by means other than coiling.
      <br/>
      For example, basal portions 121 and 126 of feedthroughs 120 and 125 may be "flag shaped," and the flag portions thereof may be wrapped around tabs 232 and 233.
      <br/>
      In yet other methods of the present invention, feedthrough pins 130 and 135 may be attached to anode and cathode tabs 232 and 233 with resistance welds, cold welds, brazing, friction welds, or an additional feedthrough component such as a crimping sleeve may capture and join tabs 232 and 233 for providing electrical and mechanical connections thereto.
    </p>
    <p num="168">
      It has been discovered that the processes of forming electrical connections between tabs 232 and 233 and feedthrough coil assemblies 120 and 125 can introduce undesirable stress on tabs 176 and 195.
      <br/>
      The resultant strain induced in those tabs has further been found to manifest itself as tears in cathode layer 175 at the base of cathode tab 176, or as fractures in relatively low strength cold welds 205 or 210 within anode sub-assembly 170.
      <br/>
      One advantage of the coiled portions of feedthroughs 120 and 125 is that they can provide strain relief between feedthrough pins 130 and 135 and tabs 232 and 233.
      <br/>
      Thus, the strain relief features of feedthroughs 120 and 125 help minimize or eliminate undesirable stress in feedthrough connections.
    </p>
    <p num="169">The foregoing means for connecting multiple electrode tab elements to feedthroughs may also be employed in other energy storage devices such as batteries, electrochemical cells and cylindrically wound capacitors.</p>

      As employed in the specification and claims hereof, the term "laser welding" means, but is not necessarily limited to, a method of welding wherein coherent light beam processing is employed.

      Various types of crimp and joint configurations for joining the cover 110 to case 90 are illustrated in cross-section in those figures.

    <p num="186">
      The inventors of the present invention have discovered that the particular structural configuration of joint 93 is of the utmost importance in respect of the suitable laser weldability thereof.
      <br/>
      More particularly, it has been discovered that joints for covers of prior art flat capacitors having metal cases and covers and conventional joint structures generally permit laser energy to enter the interior of capacitor 265 through the joints formed between the covers and cases thereof, thereby damaging or heating up components disposed inside case 90.
      <br/>
      Joints of the prior art which permit such undesired penetration of laser energy inside capacitor 265 were discovered to generally have a common feature: a joint geometry wherein a straight or substantially straight line of sight or portion existed or was disposed through the joint between the interior of the capacitor and the exterior of the capacitor.
      <br/>
      Joints having no such straight line of sight or portion through the joint between the exterior and interior of the capacitor were found to eliminate or at least diminish substantially the ill effects attending laser energy penetration to the interior of the capacitor.
    </p>
    <p num="187">
      In one embodiment of the present invention case 90, cover 110, joint 93, upper edge 94, raised portion 95, stepped portion 96, groove 97, stepped portion 98 and outer edge 111 cooperate with one another to cause laser energy entering joint 93 from the exterior of capacitor 265 to be reflected or scattered to the outside of capacitor 265, and further to be contained or absorbed within joint 93 in such a manner that no or substantially no laser energy penetrates joint 93 and enters the interior of capacitor 265 while simultaneously forming a suitable weld in joint 93 between case 90 and cover 110.
      <br/>
      This absorption, containment, backscattering or reflecting of laser energy by joint 93 results at least partially from the multiple orientations of joint 93 as it wends its way from the exterior of capacitor 265 to the interior thereof.
      <br/>
      In other words, and as illustrated in FIGS. 26(a) through 26(p), joint 93 of the present invention has multiple portions that are bent, non-parallel or serpentine respecting one another.

    <p num="188">
      In one method of the present invention for laser welding joint 93, an axis of a laser beam is directed inwardly along or parallel to the surfaces defining a first portion of joint 93 (e.g., parallel to imaginary axis 102 or imaginary axis 101, depending on the particular embodiment of the present invention at hand).
      <br/>
      Upon entering the first portion of joint 93 or a region propinquant thereto, the laser beam encounters at least a second portion of joint 93 defined by surfaces that are bent or not parallel respecting the surfaces defining the first portion of joint 93.
      <br/>

      Consequently, and providing appropriate parameters are selected by a user for operating the laser welding system of the present invention, no portion of the laser beam impinging upon the first portion of joint 93 may penetrate joint 93 sufficiently far such that the laser beam reaches the interior of capacitor 265 without first being absorbed, reflected or scattered.

      FIG. 19 shows a flow chart according to one method of the present invention for sealing case 90 and cover 110.
      <br/>
      Case subassembly 108 is provided with electrode assembly 225 inserted in case 90.
      <br/>
      Cover 110 is disposed atop upper edge 94 formed in case 90.
      <br/>
      In one method of the present invention, raised portion 95 of upper edge 94 extends about 0.014" above upper surface 112 of cover 110 when cover 110 is placed on upper edge 94.
      <br/>
      The assembly is placed within a crimping mechanism or nest, and a clamp is actuated to hold cover 110 against upper edge 94 and stepped portion 96.
      <br/>
      The crimping mechanism is actuated to crimp or fold over inwardly raised portion 95 onto, along or over upper surface 112 of cover 110.
    </p>
    <p num="201">
      In another method of the present invention, crimping of raised portion 95 is accomplished using a die cut to the shape of case 90 and further having angled or ramped sidewalls for engaging and pressing inwardly raised portion 95 over upper surface 112 of cover 110.
      <br/>
      A crimp may also be formed with a moving crimp apparatus that travels around the perimeter of case 90 while continuously crimping raised portion 95 over upper surface 112 of cover 110.
      <br/>
      The foregoing methods may be readily adapted to permit the crimping or folding of edge 111 of cover 110 downwardly over outer sidewall 92.
    </p>
    <p num="202">
      Crimping of raised portion 95 onto cover 110 or outer edge 111 onto sidewall 92 provides several advantages.
      <br/>
      First, laser welding of cover 110 to case 90 may be accomplished using relatively simple tooling, thereby resulting in short process times.
      <br/>
      Laser welding often provides a bottleneck in manufacturing process flow when components such as case 90 and cover 110 typically must be aligned precisely respecting one another.
      <br/>
      The elimination of such alignment steps during the laser welding process has been discovered to help eliminate manufacturing process bottlenecks.
      <br/>
      Folding or crimping raised portion 95 or outer edge 111 prevents a laser beam from entering the interior of capacitor 265.
      <br/>
      Instead, a laser beam is forced to couple with the material of case 90 and cover 110 to thereby induce melting.
      <br/>
      It was discovered that joints 93 not having crimps forming at least a portion thereof may permit a laser beam to damage components inside capacitor 265.
    </p>
    <p num="203">
      Another advantage of the crimped joint of the present invention is that the crimp provides additional metal in the weld zone.
      <br/>
      Aluminum, having a high thermal expansion coefficient, is sensitive to cracking upon rapid cooling from the high temperatures characteristic of welding processes.
      <br/>
      We discovered that the additional metal provided by the crimp decreases cracking sensitivity in joint 93.
      <br/>
      Joint 93 of the present invention is formed such that imaginary axes 101 and 102 are oriented at an angle theta respecting one another where theta is less than 90 degrees but greater than or equal to 0 degrees.
      <br/>
      It is notable that crimping of case 90 and cover 110 to one another helps registration of case 90 and cover 110 in respect of one another prior to the welding of at least portions of joint 93 being undertaken.

    <p num="204">
      Crimped case 90 and cover 110 are next removed from the crimp fixture and placed in a welding fixture.

      Table 2 sets forth an optimized set of parameters under which the crimped case/cover joint may be sealed using a pulsed Nd:YAG laser welding system.

      Centering of the pin through the ferrule assures that the pin does not contact the conducting wall of the ferrule, and also permits a more concentric epoxy seal to be formed around the pin.

      Centering of the pin may also be accomplished through means disposed in or on the epoxy dispensing or curing tools.

      The present invention provides a beneficial means for preventing the escape of solvent and solvent vapor from capacitor 265.

      Adhesion promotion (such as by chemical deposition, etching, corona or plasma treatment of the polymeric wire guide of a polymeric case) may be employed to maximize the reliability of capacitor 265.

      Filling of the ferrule hole with sealing adhesive may be accomplished in several ways, depending largely on the viscosity of the potting agent selected.
      <br/>
      A balance in viscosity characteristics of the sealing adhesive has been found to be desirable.
      <br/>
      More particularly, it is desired that the sealing adhesive be thin enough to fill without voids forming and to wet the surface, yet thick enough not to escape around or through the wire guide.
      <br/>
      The potting adhesive may be B-staged and inserted as a plug; likewise a hot melt adhesive may be applied in similar fashion.

      <br/>
      Channels or voids may be included in the basal portions of connector block 145 to permit potting adhesive to flow between those basal portions and case 90.

      Such a seal between the case and connector block 145 may replace the aforementioned laser welded seal between the ferrule and the case.

      <br/>
      The testing apparatus then pulls a vacuum on the interior of sealed capacitor 265, and the gas pulled from the interior of capacitor 265 is directed past a tuned mass spectrometer.
      <br/>
      Next, the exterior of capacitor 265 is exposed to helium gas, and the leak rate for helium through the materials and joints within capacitor 265 is determined by the mass spectrometer.
      <br/>
      This measure of leaktightness or hermeticity provides a means of assuring the quality of the joints being made.
    </p>
    <p num="223">
      In another embodiment of the present invention, "bombing" or filling of the interior of capacitor 265 with helium gas is accomplished immediately prior to sealing of fill port ferrule 105.
      <br/>
      The exterior of sealed capacitor 265 is then monitored under vacuum conditions with a tuned mass spectrometer to determine the rate of helium leakage past the materials and joints of capacitor 265.
    </p>
    <p num="224">
      Once capacitor 265 is filled with electrolyte, it is preferred that an aging process be undertaken.
      <br/>
      Aging is generally accomplished by applying a current through the capacitor terminals and gradually raising the voltage across those terminals from zero to the peak aging voltage of the capacitor (usually between about 360 and about 390 Volts DC).
      <br/>
      Once the aging voltage is attained, capacitor 265 is held at that voltage until the leakage current stabilizes at an acceptably low value.
      <br/>
      It is preferred that capacitor 265 be aged until a voltage of about 370 Volts is attained during a current limiting process.
    </p>
    <p num="225">
      In one preferred method of the present invention, the aging process is carried out with the voltage set at 370 Volts and the current limited to about 1.5 mA (for capacitor 265 having a capacitance of 214 microfarads).
      <br/>
      We have also found that it is beneficial to increase the temperature of the aging system at higher voltages.
      <br/>
      In one preferred method of the present invention, the temperature is increased to about 70 degrees Celsius when the voltage reaches 230 Volts.
      <br/>
      After aging to 370 Volts, the capacitors are most preferably permitted to continue aging with the voltage held at 370 Volts until the leakage current decreases to a predetermined value, a predetermined time at 370 Volts has elapsed, or until a predetermined rate of decrease in leakage current has been obtained.
    </p>
    <p num="226">
      Following aging, post aging vacuum treatment or filling of the capacitor contributes to significant improvements in capacitance and equivalent series resistance (ESR).
      <br/>
      FIG. 22 shows a flow chart describing one method of vacuum treating the aged capacitor.
      <br/>
      The aged capacitor is placed inside a vacuum chamber and held at 27 inches of mercury for three minutes.
      <br/>
      The chamber is vented and then held at 27 inches of mercury for three minutes for two additional cycles.
      <br/>
      The capacitor is then provided for fill port sealing.
    </p>
    <p num="227">
      FIG. 23 shows a flow chart describing a preferred method for a vacuum refilling operation after aging.
      <br/>
      Aged capacitor 265 is placed inside a vacuum chamber, a temporary fill tube connected to fill port tube 107 being immersed in electrolyte.
      <br/>
      The chamber is then held at 27 inches of mercury for three minutes and vented.
      <br/>
      This step is repeated once with the temporary tube in the electrolyte and a second time with the temporary tube out of the electrolyte.
      <br/>
      The third cycle is intended to draw excess electrolyte from capacitor 265.
      <br/>
      Fillport ferrule tube 107 is now ready for sealing.
    </p>
    <p num="228">
      FIG. 24 is a graph showing the increase in capacitance of five capacitors following the vacuum refilling operation of FIG. 23. The noted increase in capacitance is on the order of about 1 to about 2 microfarads (.about 0 (slashed zero) 3%).
      <br/>
      FIG. 25 is a graph showing the decrease in ESR of the same five capacitors after the vacuum refilling operation of FIG. 23. The noted decrease in ESR is on the order of about 0.2 ohms (.about.20%).
      <br/>
      The vacuum treatments are believed to remove entrapped gas that evolves during aging and refilling, and are also believed to replace electrolyte lost during aging, thereby permitting the microstructural pores of Lhe anode and separator layers to be substantially fully filled and saturated with electrolyte.
      <br/>
      Excess electrolyte may also be removed through vacuum cycling with the fill tube pointing downwardly.
    </p>
    <p num="229">
      After vacuum refilling, distal end 106 of Fill port tube 107 is most preferably crimped shut mechanically by pliers or other suitable means such as compression rollers or welding.
      <br/>
      The crimped or closed joint so formed is next most preferably trimmed with side cutter metal shears or in a metal die, and sealed.
      <br/>
      It is an advantage of the present invention that the fill port thereof may be closed and sealed quickly at minimum cost without any requirement for additional high tolerance, expensive piece parts or components for sealing fill tube 197.
    </p>
    <p num="230">
      Sealing of fill port tube 107 is most preferably accomplished using joining techniques such as ultrasonic welding, cold welding or laser welding.
      <br/>
      See, for example, Tables 2 and 3.
      <br/>
      Sealing of fill port tube 107 may also be accomplished by glueing, epoxying, or any other suitable means.
      <br/>
      For example, fill port tube 107 may be sealed by inserting a compression-fit spherical ball into a corresponding spherical recess disposed inside fill port tube 107 or ferrule 105.
      <br/>
      The ball is most preferably formed from a metal, plastic or ceramic material that is stable in the capacitor electrolyte.
      <br/>
      Dimensional control of the fill port tube or ferrule inside diameter in respect of the diameter of the ball is critical to controlling the quality of the seal being made.
      <br/>
      Ideally, the ball fits in the inside diameter in as tight an interference fit as possible without damaging the fill port ferrule weld or deforming case 90 to any significant extent.
      <br/>
      The "ball" need not conform to a spherical geometry, and may be a fitting that is cylindrically, conically or otherwise-shaped.
    </p>
    <p num="231">
      Still another method for sealing fill port ferrule 105 is to integrate a hydrogen permeable membrane seal into or propinquant to fill port ferrule 105 that does not permit electrolyte components to escape through fill port tube 107 but that does permit hydrogen gas evolved through charge and discharge of capacitor 265 to escape from the interior thereof.
      <br/>
      By sealing fill port tube 107 with a barrier having sufficient chemical resistance, but that is selective to hydrogen gas (such as some silicones, polyphenylene oxides, cellulose acetates and triacetates and polysulfones), no electrolyte is lost.
      <br/>
      Several potting adhesives (such as epoxy or silicone) have the foregoing chemical resistance and hydrogen permeability properties and thus are suitable for use in the present invention.
      <br/>
      Those adhesives most preferably seal feedthroughs while permitting hydrogen gas to escape from otherwise hermetically sealed capacitor 265.
    </p>
    <p num="232">In yet another embodiment of the present invention, the seal of fill port tube 107 is be a simple adhesive strip disposed over distal end 106 of fill port tube 107, similar to the types of seals employed in commercial ethylene glycol coolant canisters.</p>
    <p num="233">
      It is preferred that fill port ferrule 105 and fill port tube 107 form a single integrated piece of metal, although components 105 and 107 may form separate non-integral components and may further be formed of materials other than metal, such as ceramic or plastic.
      <br/>
      Fill port ferrule 105 fits within and is sealingly engaged to an opening disposed in the sidewall of case 90 or in cover 110.
      <br/>
      Additionally, height 109 of fill port tube 107 shown in FIG. 28(c) is most preferably about 0.200 inches with respect to the embodiment of capacitor 265 shown in the drawings hereof, although other heights 109 are contemplated in the present invention such as 0.065 inches, 0.300 inches, and so on.
    </p>
    <p num="234">
      It is preferred that height 109 be sufficiently great to accommodate a fitting of a helium leaktightness testing apparatus, the fitting being fitted in sealing engagement over the fill tube.
      <br/>
      It is preferred that an O-ring be disposed between the fitting and the fill tube as a vacuum of about 50 Tor is pulled on the interior of capacitor 265.
      <br/>
      Helium gas is then emitted about and around capacitor 265, cover 110, case 90, joint 93 between cover 110 and case 90, connector block 145, ferrule 105, tube 107 and other components while the helium leaktightness testing apparatus tests gas and molecules evacuated from the interior of capacitor 265 for the presence of helium gas which has leaked from the exterior of capacitor 265 into the interior thereof.
    </p>
    <p num="235">
      A tuned mass spectrometer is most preferably included in the helium leaktightness testing apparatus.
      <br/>
      The spectrometer is sensitive to the presence of helium atoms or molecules.
      <br/>
      An example of such an apparatus is a LEYBOLD INFICON Model No. UL-200 Helium Leaktester manufactured in East Syracuse, N.Y. An O-ring having a leaktightness rating of about 1 * 10-9 cm3 /sec. is most preferably employed in conjunction with the fill tube and the fitting of the leaktightness testing apparatus.
      <br/>
      A typical fail point specification for the leaktightness testing apparatus when employed with the capacitor of the present invention is about 1 * 10-9 cm3 /sec.

      FIG. 27(a) shows a top view of capacitor 265 with a portion of cover 90 removed and a portion of electrode assembly 225 exposed therewithin.
      <br/>
      Fill port ferrule tube 107 projects outwardly from an end of case 90 from fill port ferrule 105.
      <br/>
      FIG. 27(b) shows an end view of capacitor 265 of FIG. 27(a), and a corresponding end view of fill port tube 107 and fill port ferrule 105.
      <br/>
      FIGS. 28(a) through 28(c) show various views of one embodiment of liquid electrolyte fill port tube 107 and fill port ferrule 105 of the present invention.
    </p>
    <p num="237">
      In another embodiment of fill port tube 107 of the present invention, case 90 is formed of a suitable metal, and a fill port tube 107 is extruded from, punched in or otherwise integrally formed in a sidewall or other portion of case 90.
      <br/>
      Such a design eliminates the need for fill port ferrule 105 disposed in a wall or surface of case 90.
      <br/>
      For example, a tapered punch may be employed to initially punch a small diameter hole in a sidewall of case 90, followed by causing the punch to travel through the hole, causing metal from sidewall 90 to be extruded outwardly from the sidewall, and forming an outwardly projecting cylindrically or otherwise shaped fill port tube 107.

    <p num="238">
      Once sealed, the capacitor is electrically tested.
      <br/>
      Applications in implantable defibrillators may require two capacitors to be connected in series.
      <br/>
      In this case an insulator is provided by a two sided adhesive being disposed between the capacitors.
      <br/>
      Two capacitors are joined along opposing faces with the insulator/adhesive strip disposed therebetween.
      <br/>
      The pair of capacitors is then provided for assembly in PCD 10.
