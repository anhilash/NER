      A liquid crystal display device of this invention includes a substrate having a pixel electrode on one major surface, a liquid crystal layer including first and second liquid crystal microcapsule layers sequentially stacked on the pixel electrode of the substrate, and a counter electrode formed on the liquid crystal layer.
      <br/>
      Each of the first and second liquid crystal microcapsule layers contains a plurality of aspherical liquid crystal microcapsules each formed by encapsulating a liquid crystal material containing a liquid crystal compound and a dichroic dye with a transparent film.
      <br/>
      The major axes of aspherical liquid crystal microcapsules contained in the first liquid crystal microcapsule layer are aligned in a first direction.
      <br/>
      The major axes of aspherical liquid crystal microcapsules contained in the second liquid crystal microcapsule layer are aligned in a second direction different from the first direction.

      Currently, of these liquid crystal display devices, devices using nematic liquid crystals represented by the TN mode (Twisted Nematic mode) disclosed in Jpn.
      <br/>
      Pat. Appln. KOKAI Publication No. 47-11737 and the STN mode (Super Twisted Nematic mode) disclosed in Jpn.
      <br/>
      Pat. Appln. KOKAI Publication No. 60-107020 are popularly used.
    </p>
    <p num="3">
      In TN and STN mode liquid crystal display devices, alignment of liquid crystal molecules are twisted about 90 (degree)  and 260 (degree)  in the initial states, respectively.
      <br/>
      Light incident on a liquid crystal layer emerges with a change in polarization state due to the twisted alignment structure of the liquid crystal molecules and birefringence.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      When a voltage is applied to the liquid crystal layer, the liquid crystal molecules reorient themselves in the direction of electric field, and the above-described twisted structure is lost.
      <br/>
      Consequently, birefringence is lost, and incident light emerges without any change in polarization state.
      <br/>
      More specifically, the optical characteristics of the liquid crystal layer change depending on application/nonapplication of a voltage.
      <br/>
      For this reason, when the liquid crystal device is sandwiched by two linear polarizers, a change in intensity of exit light is observed.
      <br/>
      The TN or STN mode is a display scheme of obtaining contrast in density on the basis of this operation principle.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      A liquid crystal display device of such a display scheme is more advantageous than a CRT (Cathode Ray Tube) because the power consumption is much lower, and a low-profile device can be manufactured.
      <br/>
      The liquid crystal display devices are widely used in office information devices such as personal computers or wordprocessors.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      However, the liquid crystal display device of the above display scheme uses polarizers and may not effectively use incident light.
      <br/>
      Many liquid crystal display devices have light sources (backlights) behind the devices to ensure exit light intensities.
      <br/>
      In a liquid crystal display device having a color filter, the light transmittance further lowers, and therefore, a more powerful light source is required.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      The power for the light source almost equals the power consumption of the liquid crystal display device including a driving circuit.
      <br/>
      For this reason, the liquid crystal display device of the above display scheme is not suitable as a display for a battery-driven portable information device.
    </p>
    <p num="8">More specifically, in the liquid crystal display device of the conventional display scheme, the improvement in brightness and the reduction in power consumption are antinomic independently of color display or monochrome display.</p>
    <p num="9">
      Such a liquid crystal display device normally uses a fluorescent light as a backlight.
      <br/>
      This light is not preferable because it causes considerable eyestrain in long-time viewing on the display.
      <br/>
      A demand has arisen for development of a display scheme with high light utilization efficiency, which is applicable to a reflection liquid crystal display device requiring no backlight.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      In use of a liquid crystal display device as a projection display, a compact device having a long service life and power saving of the entire device can be realized by increasing the light transmittance.
      <br/>
      Hence, for a projection liquid crystal display device as well, a demand for development of a display scheme with high light utilization efficiency has arisen.
    </p>
    <p num="11">
      To meet such requirements, various display schemes using no polarizers have been proposed.
      <br/>
      For example, as a display scheme using no polarizers, a scheme called NCAP (Nematic Curvilinear Aligned Phase) or PDLC (Polymer Dispersed Liquid Crystal) is known.
      <br/>
      In these display schemes, a liquid crystal layer is formed by dispersing a nematic liquid crystal material having a positive dielectric anisotropy in a polymer matrix to form droplets of the liquid crystal material having a diameter of about several micrometers.
      <br/>
      This liquid crystal material is selected such that the refractive index for ordinary rays nearly equals that of the polymer matrix, and the refractive index for extraordinary rays differs from that of the polymer matrix.
    </p>
    <p num="12">
      According to this display scheme, in the initial state, the liquid crystal molecules in each liquid crystal particle have a distorted alignment structure.
      <br/>
      In addition, the alignment direction changes between the liquid crystal particles.
      <br/>
      For this reason, refractive index differences are generated between most liquid crystal particles and the polymer matrix.
      <br/>
      As a result, light scattering occurs, as in frosted glass.
    </p>
    <p num="13">
      When a sufficient voltage is applied to this liquid crystal layer, the liquid crystal molecules reorient themselves in each liquid crystal particle, and the refractive indices of each liquid crystal particle and the polymer matrix equal with respect to light which is perpendicularly incident on the liquid crystal layer.
      <br/>
      Consequently, neither refraction nor reflection occurs on the interface between each liquid crystal particle and the polymer matrix, resulting in a transparent state.
      <br/>
      Note that the incident light need not be linearly polarized light.
    </p>
    <p num="14">
      In the above-described display scheme, a liquid crystal material is dispersed into a medium, unlike a display scheme using liquid crystal microcapsules (to be described later).
      <br/>
      The liquid crystal display device of this display scheme can be easily formed by encapsulating a polymer matrix dispersed with particles of a liquid crystal material in a glass cell to be used for a general liquid crystal display device or applying the polymer matrix on a substrate.
    </p>
    <p num="15">
      However, when the liquid crystal molecules are to be aligned by post-processing such as stretching, to increase the contrast, or a conductive polymer film is to be laminated on the liquid crystal layer, the strength of this liquid crystal layer is insufficient.
      <br/>
      In addition, the light utilization efficiency cannot be increased in color display which requires a color filter, though no problem is posed when a transparent-opaque change is produced for display or when a white-black change is produced for display by adding a black dichroic dye.
    </p>
    <p num="16">
      As another display scheme using no polarizers, a display scheme using a guest-host liquid crystal formed by adding a guest dychroic dye to a host liquid crystal material is known.
      <br/>
      According to this display scheme, the light transmittance is controlled by changing the alignment direction of the dychroic dye molecules.
      <br/>
      M ore specifically, a voltage is applied to the liquid crystal layer to reorient the liquid crystal molecules which aligned themselves parallel to the substrate surface in the initial state to be perpendicular to the substrate surface.
      <br/>
      By changing the direction of the dychroic dye molecules accordingly, the light transmittance is controlled.
    </p>
    <p num="17">
      According to this display scheme, a transparent-coloring change can be realized without using any polarizers.
      <br/>
      In addition, according to this display scheme, when cyan, magenta, and yellow liquid crystal layers are stacked via intermediate substrates, color display can be performed without using any color filter.
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      However, the dychroic dye has only one absorbance axis and cannot absorb a polarized light component perpendicular to the absorbance axis.
      <br/>
      Additionally, since the dychroic dye has low solubility in the host liquid crystal m at erial and low molar extinction coefficient, the above display scheme cannot realize display at high contrast.
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      To realize a liquid crystal display device using a guest-host liquid crystal which can display at higher contrast, various examinations have been made.
      <br/>
      For example, a White-Taylor type guest-host liquid crystal display device is disclosed in "Journal of Applied Physics (J.
      <br/>
      Appl. Phys.), Vol. 45, pp. 4718-4723 (1974)". This liquid crystal display device uses, as a liquid crystal material, a mixture of a liquid crystal compound and a dichroic dye having a chiral nematic phase.
      <br/>
      In this device, light is efficiently absorbed by the dye due to the twisted structure of the chiral nematic phase, so high display contrast can be obtained in principle without using any polarizers.
    </p>
    <p num="20">
      However, to achieve high contrast in this liquid crystal display device, the helical pitch in the alignment of liquid crystal molecules having the chiral nematic phase must be set on the order of the wavelength of light.
      <br/>
      If the helical pitch is decreased, many lines of disclination are formed to degrade the display quality.
      <br/>
      Simultaneously, since the hysteresis phenomenon occurs, the response speed to voltage application excessively lowers.
      <br/>
      Therefore, this liquid crystal display device is of no practical use, as compared to the above-described liquid crystal display device of TN or STN mode.
    </p>
    <p num="21">
      As still another display device using a guest-host liquid crystal, a liquid crystal display device using liquid crystal microcapsules is known.
      <br/>
      An examination has been made to obtain a color liquid crystal display device having a high light utilization efficiency by using the guest-host liquid crystal microcapsules.
      <br/>
      For example, a technique of preparing guest-host liquid crystal microcapsules having different absorption wavelengths and mixing them to form a liquid crystal layer (Jpn. Pat. Appln. KOKAI Publication No. 58-144885) or a technique of stacking three liquid crystal layers having different absorption wavelengths using guest-host liquid crystal microcapsules without using any intermediate substrates of glass or a plastic (Japanese Patent Application No. 7-56086) is known.
    </p>
    <p num="22">
      As described above, the liquid crystal display device using liquid crystal microcapsules need not use polarizers.
      <br/>
      For this reason, the light utilization efficiency increases, and high display contrast can be expected.
      <br/>
      However, the current liquid crystal display device using liquid crystal microcapsules has not achieved high display contrast yet.
    </p>
    <p num="23">
      This is partially because when liquid crystal microcapsules are used, all liquid crystal molecules cannot be aligned in a desired direction in the absence of applied voltage.
      <br/>
      More specifically, in the absence of applied voltage, the liquid crystal molecules in the liquid crystal microcapsules are aligned to be parallel or perpendicular to capsule walls having curved surfaces.
      <br/>
      For this reason, the liquid crystal molecules in the liquid crystal microcapsules are nonuniformly aligned.
      <br/>
      When the liquid crystal molecules are nonuniformly aligned, the light absorbance or light transmittance becomes lower than that of a structure with all liquid crystal molecules aligned in one direction.
      <br/>
      Hence, the liquid crystal display device using liquid crystal microcapsules cannot obtain high display contrast.
    </p>
    <heading>BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="24">As described above, a liquid crystal display device using liquid crystal microcapsules cannot achieve high display contrast.</p>
    <p num="25">It is an object of the present invention to provide a liquid crystal display device capable of display at high contrast and a method of manufacturing the same.</p>
    <p num="26">According to one aspect of the present invention, there is provided a liquid crystal display device comprising a substrate having a pixel electrode on one major surface, a liquid crystal layer including first and second liquid crystal microcapsule layers sequentially stacked on the pixel electrode of the substrate, and a counter electrode formed on the liquid crystal layer, wherein each of the first and second liquid crystal microcapsule layers contains a plurality of aspherical liquid crystal microcapsules each formed by encapsulating a liquid crystal material containing a liquid crystal compound with a transparent film, major axes of the aspherical liquid crystal microcapsules in the first liquid crystal microcapsule layer are aligned in a first direction, and major axes of the aspherical liquid crystal microcapsules in the second liquid crystal microcapsule layer are aligned in a second direction.</p>
    <p num="27">According to another aspect of the present invention, there is provided a method of manufacturing a liquid crystal display device, comprising the steps of forming a first liquid crystal microcapsule layer containing a plurality of liquid crystal microcapsules each having a shape elongated in a first direction, forming a second liquid crystal microcapsule layer containing a plurality of liquid crystal microcapsules each having a shape elongated in a second direction, and forming a structure in which the first liquid crystal microcapsule layer, the second liquid crystal microcapsule layer, and a counter electrode are sequentially stacked on a pixel electrode formed on one major surface of a substrate, wherein each of the plurality of liquid crystal microcapsules contained in the first and second liquid crystal microcapsule layers is formed by encapsulating a liquid crystal material containing a liquid crystal compound with a transparent film.</p>
    <p num="28">
      In the present invention, the liquid crystal material can contain a dichroic dye.
      <br/>
      In this case, when the first and second directions are set in different directions, the first and second liquid crystal microcapsule layers can absorb light components (polarized light components) having different polarization directions (planes of polarization) at a high efficiency.
      <br/>
      That is, display at high contrast can be performed.
    </p>
    <p num="29">
      The light absorbance in each liquid crystal microcapsule layer is maximized when the first or second direction is substantially parallel to the substrate surface.
      <br/>
      When the first direction is substantially perpendicular to the second direction, a light component transmitted through one of the first and second liquid crystal microcapsule layers can be absorbed by the other at a high efficiency.
    </p>
    <p num="30">
      In the present invention, the first direction may be substantially parallel to the second direction, and a  LAMBDA /2-wavelength plate may be inserted between the first liquid crystal microcapsule layer and the second liquid crystal microcapsule layer.
      <br/>
      The  LAMBDA /2-wavelength plate has two different principal refractive indices in the third and fourth directions perpendicular to each other in its plane.
      <br/>
      That is, the  LAMBDA /2-wavelength plate has two optical axes perpendicular to each other in its plane.
      <br/>
      When the  LAMBDA /2-wavelength plate is arranged such that the first and second directions make an angle of substantially 45 (degree)  with the third or fourth direction, the light component transmitted through the first liquid crystal microcapsule layer is rotated in its polarization direction through 90 (degree)  by the  LAMBDA /2-wavelength plate and becomes incident on the second liquid crystal microcapsule layer.
      <br/>
      Hence, the first and second liquid crystal microcapsule layers can absorb light components having different polarization directions at a high efficiency.
    </p>
    <p num="31">
      In the present invention, the major axis of each of the plurality of aspherical liquid crystal microcapsules preferably has a length not less than two times the maximum value of the diameter perpendicular to the major axis.
      <br/>
      More preferably, the major axis has a length not less than three times the maximum value.
      <br/>
      Preferably, in the first liquid crystal microcapsule layer, a variation of the major axes of the liquid crystal microcapsules from the first direction falls within a range of 10 (degree) , and in the second liquid crystal microcapsule layer, a variation of the major axes of the liquid crystal microcapsules from the second direction falls within a range of 10 (degree) . In this case, each of the first and second liquid crystal microcapsule layers can be made to absorb a specific polarized beam at a very high efficiency.
    </p>
    <p num="32">
      In the present invention, the aspherical liquid crystal microcapsule can have various shapes.
      <br/>
      The aspherical liquid crystal microcapsule may have a spheroidal shape.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, the aspherical liquid crystal microcapsule may have a tapered or fibrous shape.
    </p>
    <p num="33">
      The first and second liquid crystal microcapsule layers can be formed using aspherical liquid crystal microcapsules.
      <br/>
      In this case, a plurality of recessed portions aligned periodically are preferably formed in the surface of the substrate having the pixel electrode.
      <br/>
      This recessed portion can be formed into a shape that fits with the aspherical liquid crystal microcapsule or a groove shape.
    </p>
    <p num="34">
      The major axes of the plurality of aspherical liquid crystal microcapsules may be aligned in a desired direction by arranging the plurality of aspherical liquid crystal microcapsules on the pixel electrode of the substrate and vibrating the substrate.
      <br/>
      A pickup head for holding the plurality of aspherical liquid crystal microcapsules by suction to align their major axes in a predetermined direction may be used.
    </p>
    <p num="35">
      The first and second liquid crystal microcapsule layers can be formed using spherical liquid crystal microcapsules.
      <br/>
      For example, when a liquid crystal microcapsule layer is formed using spherical liquid crystal microcapsules and stretched, the first or second liquid crystal microcapsule layer can be formed.
    </p>
    <p num="36">
      A plurality of spherical liquid crystal microcapsules may be aligned in lines on a flat plate and pressed against the flat plate.
      <br/>
      When liquid crystal microcapsules adjacent in a line are in contact with each other, and liquid crystal microcapsules adjacent between the lines are aligned at a predetermined interval, the liquid crystal microcapsules are drawn in a direction perpendicular to the lines.
      <br/>
      That is, the first or second liquid crystal microcapsule layer can be formed.
    </p>
    <p num="37">
      The first or second liquid crystal microcapsule layer can also be formed by applying a liquid crystal microcapsule coating solution containing the plurality of spherical liquid crystal microcapsules and a liquid to a flat plate to form a coat and sequentially drying the coat in a direction parallel to the flat plate.
      <br/>
      In this case, the liquid crystal microcapsule coating solution can contain a photosetting or thermosetting resin which shrinks upon hardening.
      <br/>
      A groove-shaped recessed portion or a band-shaped projecting portion may be formed on the surface of the flat plate.
      <br/>
      When the first liquid crystal microcapsule layer is to be formed by this method, the substrate can be used as the flat plate.
      <br/>
      When the second liquid crystal microcapsule layer is to be formed by this method, a thin film consisting of a transparent resin may be formed on the first liquid crystal microcapsule layer and used in place of the flat plate.
    </p>
    <p num="38">
      In the present invention, the liquid crystal layer can be formed by independently forming the first and second liquid crystal microcapsule layers and bonding them.
      <br/>
      One of the first and second liquid crystal microcapsule layers may be formed on the other.
    </p>
    <p num="39">
      The first or second liquid crystal microcapsule layer can be formed on the substrate having the pixel electrode.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, the first or second liquid crystal microcapsule layer may be formed on a flat plate different from this substrate and transferred from the flat plate to the substrate.
    </p>
    <p num="40">
      In the present invention, the liquid crystal display device preferably has a structure in which three liquid crystal layers having different absorption wavelengths are sequentially stacked.
      <br/>
      In this case, full-color display is made possible by providing intermediate electrodes between the three liquid crystal layers.
    </p>
    <p num="41">
      Additional objects and advantages of the invention will be set forth in the description which follows, and in part will be obvious from the description, or may be learned by practice of the invention.
      <br/>
      The objects and advantages of the invention may be realized and obtained by means of the instrumentalities and combinations particularly pointed out hereinafter.

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="43">The present invention will be described below in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings.</p>
    <p num="44">
      The first embodiment of the present invention will be described.
      <br/>
      In the first embodiment, a liquid crystal microcapsule is formed as an aspherical granule.
    </p>
    <p num="45">
      FIG. 1 is a sectional view of a liquid crystal display device according to the first embodiment of the present invention.
      <br/>
      Referring to FIG. 1, a liquid crystal display device 1-1 has a substrate 2 having an electrode 4 formed on one major surface, a substrate 3 placed to oppose the surface of the substrate 2 with the electrode 4 and having an electrode 5 on the opposing surface, and a liquid crystal layer 7 sandwiched by the substrates 2 and 3.
    </p>
    <p num="46">
      In the liquid crystal display device 1-1, a transparent substrate of glass or a plastic or the like is used as the substrate 2.
      <br/>
      As the electrode 4, a transparent conductive film of ITO or the like or a metal film of aluminum or the like is used.
      <br/>
      The substrate 3 need not always be arranged.
      <br/>
      Instead, a protective film of a transparent resin or the like may be arranged.
      <br/>
      As the counter electrode 5, a transparent conductive film of ITO or the like is used.
    </p>
    <p num="47">
      In the liquid crystal display device 1-1, the liquid crystal layer 7 comprises liquid crystal microcapsules 6 each formed by encapsulating a liquid crystal material 10 with a transparent film 11.
      <br/>
      The liquid crystal microcapsules 6 form liquid crystal microcapsule layers 8 and 9 in the liquid crystal layer 7.
      <br/>
      That is, the liquid crystal layer 7 has a layered structure formed by stacking the liquid crystal microcapsule layers 8 and 9.
    </p>
    <p num="48">
      Each liquid crystal microcapsule 6 has an anisotropic shape, i.e., an aspherical shape.
      <br/>

      FIG. 2A is a sectional view showing an example of a liquid crystal microcapsule used in the liquid crystal display device according to the first embodiment of the present invention.

      In the liquid crystal microcapsule 6 shown in FIG. 2A, reference numeral 12 denotes a liquid crystal molecule.
      <br/>
      The transparent film 11 encapsulates not only the liquid crystal molecules 12 but also a dichroic dye (not shown).
      <br/>
      Referring to FIG. 2A, the liquid crystal microcapsule 6 has an aspherical shape and, more specifically, a spheroidal shape.
      <br/>
      Most liquid crystal molecules 12 lie parallel to an axis 13 corresponding to the major axis of the liquid crystal microcapsule 6.
    </p>
    <p num="63">
      When the liquid crystal microcapsule 6 has an aspherical shape as shown in FIG. 2A, and the major-axis direction of the liquid crystal microcapsules 6 in the liquid crystal microcapsule layer 8 is different from that in the liquid crystal microcapsule layer 9 in the liquid crystal display device 1-1, high display contrast can be obtained.
      <br/>
      The reason for this will be described below.
    </p>
    <p num="64">
      FIGS. 2B to 2D are sectional views of liquid crystal microcapsules used in the conventional liquid crystal display device.
      <br/>
      Each of conventional liquid crystal microcapsules 106-1, 106-2, and 106-3 shown in FIGS. 2B to 2D has a structure in which a liquid crystal material is encapsulated by a transparent film 11.
      <br/>
      According to the conventional manufacturing method, the liquid crystal microcapsules 106-1, 106-2, and 106-3 are formed into a spherical shape, as shown in FIGS. 2B to 2D.
    </p>
    <p num="65">
      In the liquid crystal microcapsules 106-1 to 106-3 shown in FIGS. 2B to 2D, the liquid crystal molecules 12 have different aligned states.
      <br/>
      This difference in alignment results from the degree of interaction between the transparent film 11 and the liquid crystal molecules 12 and the grain size difference between the liquid crystal microcapsules 106-n.
      <br/>
      When an appropriate interaction is present between the transparent film 11 and the liquid crystal molecules 12, bipolar alignment is observed.
      <br/>
      If the interaction is weak, radial or axial alignment is observed.
      <br/>
      When the interaction is weak, and the grain size is sufficiently large, radial alignment is observed.
      <br/>
      When the interaction is weak, and the grain size is small, axial alignment is observed.
    </p>
    <p num="66">
      In the liquid crystal microcapsule 106-1 shown in FIG. 2B, the liquid crystal molecules 12 are radially aligned from the center of the liquid crystal microcapsule to be perpendicular to the transparent film 11, resulting in radial alignment.
      <br/>
      The liquid crystal microcapsule 106-1 with radially aligned liquid crystal molecules 12 has equal light transmittance with respect to incident light from all directions.
      <br/>
      That is, the liquid crystal microcapsule 106-1 is optically isotropic.
      <br/>
      For this reason, when the liquid crystal microcapsule 106-1 is used, light absorbance cannot be improved by optimizing the relationship between the optical axis of incident light and the alignment directions of the liquid crystal molecules 12.
    </p>
    <p num="67">
      In the liquid crystal microcapsule 106-2 shown in FIG. 2C, the liquid crystal molecules 12 are aligned almost perpendicular to the transparent film 11, though no radial alignment is observed.
      <br/>
      In the liquid crystal microcapsule 106-2, the liquid crystal molecules 12 have axial alignment, and the liquid crystal microcapsule 106-2 has optical anisotropy.
    </p>
    <p num="68">
      In the liquid crystal microcapsule 106-3 shown in FIG. 2D, the liquid crystal molecules 12 are aligned parallel to the transparent film 11 from one pole to the other pole of the liquid crystal microcapsule 106-3.
      <br/>
      That is, in the liquid crystal microcapsule 106-3, the liquid crystal molecules 12 have bipolar alignment.
      <br/>
      For this reason, the liquid crystal microcapsule 106-3 has optical anisotropy.
    </p>
    <p num="69">
      In the liquid crystal microcapsules 106-2 and 106-3 with the liquid crystal molecules 12 having axial or bipolar alignment, the liquid crystal alignment has anisotropy.
      <br/>
      Hence, when light is incident perpendicularly to the axis 13 connecting the two poles, the highest light absorbance can be obtained.
    </p>
    <p num="70">
      However, the liquid crystal molecules 12 far from the axis 13 in the liquid crystal microcapsule 106-2 or the liquid crystal molecules 12 near the two poles in the liquid crystal microcapsule 106-3 are not aligned parallel to the axis 13.
      <br/>
      That is, only some liquid crystal molecules 12 are aligned parallel to the axis 13.
      <br/>
      For this reason, relatively low light absorbance is obtained as compared to a case in which all liquid crystal molecules line up in one direction.
    </p>
    <p num="71">
      The light absorbance is increased when the axis 13 is perpendicular to the light incident direction.
      <br/>
      However, it is difficult to arrange the spherical liquid crystal microcapsules 106-2 and 106-3 such that the axis 13 is perpendicular to the optical axis of incident light.

    <p num="72">
      To the contrary, in the liquid crystal display device 1-1, the liquid crystal microcapsule 6 is formed to have a major axis as shown in FIG. 2A. In the liquid crystal microcapsule 6 having this shape and liquid crystal molecules with bipolar alignment, the liquid crystal microcapsules are most stabilized when the liquid crystal molecules 12 lie in the direction of the axis 13.
      <br/>
      The liquid crystal microcapsule shown in FIG. 2A is stretched along the axis 13.
      <br/>
      Therefore, in the liquid crystal microcapsule 6 shown in FIG. 2A, the ratio of liquid crystal molecules 12 aligned parallel to the axis 13 is higher than that in the liquid crystal microcapsules 106-2 and 106-3 shown in FIGS. 2C and 2D.
    </p>
    <p num="73">According to the present invention, since the alignment directions of the liquid crystal molecules 12 in the liquid crystal microcapsule 6 are uniformed, the angle the alignment direction of each liquid crystal molecule 12 makes with the optical axis of incident light can be optimized, so a liquid crystal display device capable of display at high contrast can be obtained.</p>
    <p num="74">
      However, a dichroic dye cannot absorb all light components in a predetermined wavelength range.
      <br/>
      More specifically, a dichroic dye can absorb only a polarized light component parallel to the long axes of the molecules and cannot absorb a polarized light component perpendicular to the long axes of the molecules.
      <br/>
      For this reason, incident light cannot be sufficiently absorbed by only one liquid crystal microcapsule layer.
    </p>
    <p num="75">
      In the liquid crystal display device 1-1, the liquid crystal microcapsule layers 8 and 9 are stacked to form the liquid crystal layer 7.
      <br/>
      In addition, the major-axis directions of the liquid crystal microcapsules 6 are different between the liquid crystal microcapsule layers 8 and 9, and accordingly, the alignment directions of the dichroic dye are also different.
    </p>
    <p num="76">
      With this structure, when light is incident from, e.g., the substrate 3 side on the liquid crystal layer 7, some components of the incident light are absorbed by the liquid crystal microcapsule layer 9, and the remaining light components transmitted through the liquid crystal microcapsule layer 9 are absorbed by the liquid crystal microcapsule layer 8.
      <br/>
      Therefore, according to the liquid crystal display device 1-1, higher display contrast can be obtained.
    </p>
    <p num="77">
      The average alignment direction of the liquid crystal molecules 12 in each of the liquid crystal microcapsule layers 8 and 9 preferably makes an angle of 0 (degree)  to 60 (degree)  with the substrate surface.

      More preferably, the alignment direction is parallel to the substrate surface.
      <br/>
      The average alignment direction of the liquid crystal molecules 12 in the liquid crystal microcapsule layer 8 preferably makes an angle of 80 (degree)  to 90 (degree)  with the average alignment direction of the liquid crystal molecules 12 in the liquid crystal microcapsule layer 9.
      <br/>
      More preferably, the alignment directions form an angle of 90 (degree) . When the alignment direction of the liquid crystal molecules 12 is controlled in this manner, higher display contrast can be obtained.
    </p>
    <p num="78">
      When the major axis of the liquid crystal microcapsule 6 has a length two times or more the maximum value of the diameter perpendicular to the major axis, the above-described effect becomes more remarkable.
      <br/>
      More specifically, the average alignment direction of the liquid crystal molecules 12 can be roughly matched with the major axis of the liquid crystal microcapsule 6.
      <br/>
      Especially, when the major axis of the liquid crystal microcapsule 6 has a length of three times or more the maximum value of the diameter perpendicular to the major axis, the alignment directions of the liquid crystal molecules 12 can be further uniformed in the absence of applied voltage.
      <br/>
      That is, the order parameter of the liquid crystal molecules 12 in the absence of applied voltage can be increased.
    </p>
    <p num="79">
      The projection of the liquid crystal microcapsule 6 on the substrate 2 preferably has a shape with which the average alignment direction of the liquid crystal molecules 12 in the absence of applied voltage is uniquely determined.
      <br/>
      For example, when the projection of the liquid crystal microcapsule 6 on the substrate 2 has a regular hexagonal shape, the alignment direction in the absence of applied voltage is parallel to a diagonal line.
      <br/>
      However, a regular hexagon has a triple rotary axis.
      <br/>
      That is, a regular hexagon has three equivalent diagonal lines.
      <br/>
      In this case, the average alignment direction of the liquid crystal molecules 12 in the absence of applied voltage cannot be matched among the liquid crystal microcapsules 6.

    <p num="80">
      On the other hand, when the projection of the liquid crystal microcapsule 6 on the substrate 2 has no rotary axis or has double rotary axis, the average alignment direction of the liquid crystal molecules 12 in the absence of applied voltage is uniquely determined.

      Hence, the average alignment direction of the liquid crystal molecules 12 in the absence of applied voltage can be matched among the liquid crystal microcapsules 6.

      The above-described liquid crystal display device 1-1 can be manufactured by a method to be described below.

    <p num="86">FIGS. 4A to 4C are perspective views schematically showing a method of manufacturing the liquid crystal display device according to the first embodiment of the present invention.</p>

      To manufacture the liquid crystal display device 1-1, first, as shown in FIG. 4A, spherical liquid crystal microcapsules 6 are aligned in lines on the surface of a substrate 2 having an electrode 4.

      At this time, the liquid crystal microcapsules 6 adjacent to each other in each line are placed in contact with each other.
      <br/>
      After a plurality of lines are formed at predetermined intervals, a pressure is applied to the liquid crystal microcapsules 6 aligned on the substrate 2 from a direction perpendicular to the substrate surface.
      <br/>
      The liquid crystal microcapsules 6 are drawn in a direction perpendicular to the lines, as shown in FIG. 4B. Consequently, the liquid crystal molecules 12 in each liquid crystal microcapsule 6 align themselves along the major axis of the liquid crystal microcapsule 6.
      <br/>
      With this process, a liquid crystal microcapsule layer 8 is formed.
    </p>
    <p num="88">
      By the same method as described above, liquid crystal microcapsules 6 are aligned on a transfer plate consisting of, e.g., Teflon, and a pressure is applied to align the liquid crystal microcapsules 6.

      A liquid crystal microcapsule layer 9 is formed and transferred from the transfer plate to the liquid crystal microcapsule layer 8.
      <br/>
      With this process, a liquid crystal layer 7 is formed as shown in FIG. 4C. This transfer is performed such that the major-axis direction of the liquid crystal microcapsules 6, i.e., the alignment direction of liquid crystal molecules 12 changes between the liquid crystal microcapsule layers 8 and 9, as shown in FIG. 4C.
    </p>
    <p num="89">When the substrate 3 having the electrode 5 is placed on the liquid crystal layer 7, a liquid crystal display device 1-1 can be obtained.</p>

      In the above-described manufacturing method, the liquid crystal microcapsules 6 are deformed using the intervals between adjacent liquid crystal microcapsules 6.
      <br/>
      However, the liquid crystal microcapsules 6 may be deformed using another method.
      <br/>
      For example, the liquid crystal microcapsules 6 are dispersed into a liquid such as water to prepare a liquid crystal microcapsule coating solution.
      <br/>
      Subsequently, the liquid crystal microcapsule coating solution is applied to the substrate 2 to form a coat, which is dried.
      <br/>
      After this, the dried coat is drawn in a predetermined direction parallel to the substrate surface.
      <br/>
      With this process, the liquid crystal microcapsules 6 are elongated, and the liquid crystal molecules 12 in the liquid crystal microcapsules 6 align in the elongating direction.
    </p>
    <p num="91">
      In the above method, the liquid crystal microcapsule coating solution can contain a thermoplastic resin capable of being drawn in the film formation process, such as polyvinyl alcohols, polyvinyl acetates, unvulcanized rubbers, and various types of oligomers.
      <br/>
      In this case, gaps between the adjacent liquid crystal microcapsules 6 are filled with a transparent resin in the liquid crystal microcapsule layers 8 and 9.
      <br/>
      This allows to prevent an increase in light scattering due to residual gaps and also more satisfactorily deform the liquid crystal microcapsules.
    </p>
    <p num="92">
      When the liquid crystal microcapsule coating solution contains a thermoplastic resin, the liquid crystal microcapsule layers 8 and 9 can be formed by the following method.
      <br/>
      First, spherical liquid crystal microcapsules and fine particles of a thermoplastic resin are dispersed into water, an organic solvent, or a solution mixture thereof to prepare a liquid crystal microcapsule coating solution.
      <br/>
      The composition of the liquid crystal microcapsule coating solution is appropriately changed in accordance with the coating apparatus to be used or the surface to which the liquid crystal microcapsule coating solution is to be applied.
    </p>
    <p num="93">
      As an organic solvent, ones that do not cause destruction of the liquid crystal microcapsules or elution of the liquid crystal material from the transparent film is selected.
      <br/>
      To realize sufficient display contrast, the amount of fine particles is controlled such that the ratio of the liquid crystal material to the sum volume of the liquid crystal microcapsules and the fine particles of the thermoplastic resin becomes 60 vol % or more.
    </p>
    <p num="94">
      Subsequently, the liquid crystal microcapsule coating solution is applied to a film or flat plate to form a coat.
      <br/>
      As this film or flat plate, a film or flat plate whose surface is applied with polyethylene, polypropylene, a fluoroplastic, a silicone-based mold release agent, or a fluorine-based mold release agent and imparted with hydrophilic nature, or a film or flat plate having mold release characteristics and hydrophilic nature is used.
      <br/>
      That is, the film or flat plate requires mold release characteristics and hydrophilic nature.
    </p>
    <p num="95">
      After the coat is dried, it is peeled from the film or flat plate and drawn or stretched in a specific direction.

    <p num="96">
      According to the above-described method, a pressure is applied to the liquid crystal microcapsules 6 in aligning the liquid crystal molecules 12.

      To prevent such degradation in display characteristics of the liquid crystal display device 1-1, the liquid crystal molecules 12 may be aligned not by drawing but by sequentially drying the coat from the end portion.
      <br/>
      When the coat is uniformly dried, the contact area between the adjacent liquid crystal microcapsules 6 increases.
      <br/>
      For this reason, a large tensile force acts on the liquid crystal microcapsules 6 from a plurality of directions parallel to the substrate surface.
      <br/>
      Consequently, each liquid crystal microcapsule 6 normally obtains a hexagonal shape when viewed from the direction perpendicular to the substrate surface.
    </p>
    <p num="98">
      To the contrary, when the coat is dried with a temperature gradient, the above-described increase in contact area does not become uniform.
      <br/>
      When the coat is sequentially dried from one end to the other end, the tensile force acting on the liquid crystal microcapsules 6 is nonuniform.
      <br/>
      Hence, substantially all liquid crystal microcapsules 6 can be elongated in a direction perpendicular to the drying direction.
    </p>
    <p num="99">
      To further deform the liquid crystal microcapsules 6 elongated by the above method, a cloth, plate, or roll may be slid or rolled on the dried coat while applying a pressure of 2 kg/cm2 or less.
      <br/>
      When the applied pressure is 2 kg/cm2 or less, the liquid crystal microcapsules 6 are not damaged.
      <br/>
      The surface of the roll or the like is preferably treated with a fluoroplastic.
      <br/>
      In this case, the friction between the roll or the like and the coat is reduced to satisfactorily prevent damage to the liquid crystal microcapsules 6.

      The above-described photosetting or thermosetting resin may be mixed with the liquid crystal microcapsule coating solution.
      <br/>
      More specifically, a coat is formed using a liquid crystal microcapsule coating solution mixed with a photosetting or thermosetting resin, and sequentially dried from one end to the other end.
      <br/>
      When the photosetting or -thermosetting resin shrinks upon hardening, the liquid crystal microcapsules 6 can be more largely deformed.
    </p>
    <p num="101">
      The coat can be dried using, e.g., a far-infrared heater capable of simultaneously heating band-shaped regions.
      <br/>
      More specifically, the substrate 2 and the far-infrared heater are translated relative to each other in a direction perpendicular to the longitudinal direction of the heated regions.
      <br/>
      With this operation, the coat can be sequentially dried from one end to the other end.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, by sending the substrate 2 having the coat to a tunnel-shaped drier such as a continuous furnace, the coat can be sequentially dried from one end to the other end.

      When the coat is sequentially dried from an end portion to align the liquid crystal molecules 12, the liquid crystal layer 7 shown in FIG. 1 can be easily formed.

      For example, when the liquid crystal microcapsule layer 8 is formed on the substrate 2 by the above-described method, and then, the liquid crystal microcapsule layer 9 is sequentially formed by the above-described method, the liquid crystal layer 7 can be obtained.
    </p>
    <p num="103">
      According to the above-described method, the liquid crystal microcapsule layers 8 and 9 can also be formed by the following method.
      <br/>
      First, a liquid crystal microcapsule coating solution containing a thermosetting or photosetting resin is applied to a substrate 2 to form a thicker coat.
      <br/>
      The coat is sequentially dried from an end portion to dry only the surface region of the coat formed on the substrate 2.
      <br/>
      This dried surface region forms a liquid crystal microcapsule layer 9.
      <br/>
      Subsequently, the undried region of the coat between the liquid crystal microcapsule layer 9 and the substrate 2 is sequentially dried from an end portion to form a liquid crystal microcapsule layer 8.
      <br/>
      When the drying directions are perpendicular to each other, liquid crystal molecules 12 can be aligned perpendicular between the liquid crystal microcapsule layer 8 and the liquid crystal microcapsule layer 9.
    </p>
    <p num="104">
      When the alignment direction is to be controlled by sequentially drying the coat from an end portion, the surface of the substrate 2 may be rubbed.
      <br/>
      When the rubbing direction is perpendicular to the drying direction, the liquid crystal microcapsules 6 can be more easily deformed.
      <br/>
      Instead of rubbing the substrate 2, a thin film of a transparent resin may be formed on the substrate 2, and the surface of the thin film may be rubbed.
      <br/>
      In this case as well, the same effect as described above can be obtained.

    <p num="105">
      When the alignment direction is to be controlled by sequentially drying the coat from an end portion, band-shaped projecting portions may be formed on the surface of the substrate 2.
      <br/>
      By forming the band-shaped projecting portions such that their longitudinal direction is perpendicular to that of the liquid crystal microcapsules 6, the liquid crystal microcapsules 6 can be more easily deformed.
      <br/>
      Columnar bodies may be formed in place of the band-shaped projecting portions.
      <br/>
      When columnar bodies are appropriately located on the substrate 2, the same effect as described above can be obtained.
      <br/>
      The band-shaped projecting portions or columnar bodies can be formed from either a conductive material or an insulating material.

      When the band-shaped projecting portions or columnar bodies consist of a conductive material, these elements can be partly used as interconnections.

      Let a1 be the maximum value of the diameter perpendicular to the major axis of the liquid crystal microcapsule 6 shown in FIG. 10A, b1 be the length of the liquid crystal microcapsules 6 in the major-axis direction, and b2 be the longitudinal-direction length of the columnar liquid crystal microcapsule 6 in the liquid crystal microcapsule layer 9.

      Then, if r1 =b1 /a1, r=b2 /a1, and the maximum value of the angle formed by the vertex and side surface portion of the conical liquid crystal microcapsule 6 is represented by  THETA , the ratio of Hx, Lx, Hy, and Ly to a1 can be approximately given by:

      Hx /a1 =(1+r2)/2-�(1+r2) * (1+r2)-1�1/2 /2
      <br/>
      Lx /a1 =1

      Hy /a1 =1/2+r2 * �1-arcsin(45 (degree) - THETA / 2) * sin(45 (degree) + THETA /2)�/2

      To form the liquid crystal microcapsule layers 8 and 9, liquid crystal microcapsules 6 are put into a predetermined solution 18 stored in a container 17.

      <br/>
      A single-layered film of liquid crystal microcapsules 6 is formed on the surface of the solution 18, and then, the single-layered film of liquid crystal microcapsules 6 is dipped up by a porous film 19, as shown in FIG. 11. With this process, a single-layered film of regularly aligned liquid crystal microcapsules 6 can be obtained.

      By vacuum-suction through the holes of the plate, the liquid crystal microcapsule coating solution is removed from the plate surface, and simultaneously, the liquid crystal microcapsules 6 are fixed at the positions of the holes.

    <p num="149">In this case, when the holes are formed at appropriate positions in the plate, the alignment of liquid crystal microcapsules can be controlled.</p>
    <p num="150">In addition, when recessed portions conforming to the liquid crystal microcapsules 6 are formed on the surface of the plate, and holes to be used for vacuum suction are formed in correspondence with the recessed portions, the alignment direction of the liquid crystal microcapsules can be more accurately controlled.</p>

      As still another method, dried liquid crystal microcapsules 6 may be used.
      <br/>
      The liquid crystal microcapsules 6 are subjected to a surface treatment so as not to coagulate, and are dried.
      <br/>
      Subsequently, the dried liquid crystal microcapsules 6 are dispersed on a substrate having regularly formed recessed portions.

    <p num="153">To regularly align the liquid crystal microcapsules 6 formed into an aspherical shape in advance, the liquid crystal microcapsules 6 are aligned in one direction by using a squeegee or the like or applying a sound pressure such as an ultrasonic wave, or aligned downward using the gravitational effect.</p>

      FIG. 12 is a schematic perspective view of a liquid crystal display device according to the second embodiment of the present invention.
      <br/>
      Referring to FIG. 12, a liquid crystal display device 1-2 comprises a substrate 2 having an electrode 4 formed on one major surface, a liquid crystal layer 7 formed on the substrate 2, and an electrode (not shown) formed on the liquid crystal layer 7.
      <br/>
      The liquid crystal layer 7 has a liquid crystal microcapsule layer 8 formed by aligning liquid crystal microcapsules 6 with their major axes parallel to each other, and a liquid crystal microcapsule layer 9 formed by aligning the liquid crystal microcapsules 6 with their major axes parallel to each other.
      <br/>
      The major-axis direction of the liquid crystal microcapsules 6 in the liquid crystal microcapsule layer 8 is different from that in the liquid crystal microcapsule layer 9.
    </p>
    <p num="157">
      FIG. 13 is a schematic perspective view of the liquid crystal microcapsule 6 used for the liquid crystal display device 1-2.
      <br/>
      Referring to FIG. 13, the fibrous liquid crystal microcapsule 6 has a transparent film 11, and liquid crystal molecules 12 and dichroic dye molecules 31 encapsulated by the transparent film 11.
      <br/>
      A fibrous liquid crystal microcapsule means a liquid crystal microcapsule having almost a constant diameter at any positions in the major-axis direction and a length in the major-axis direction 100 times the diameter.
      <br/>
      The section of the fibrous liquid crystal microcapsule 6 taken along a direction perpendicular to the major-axis direction can have any one of a circular shape, elliptical shape, and rectangular shape.
    </p>
    <p num="158">
      As described in the first embodiment, when the liquid crystal microcapsule is formed into an aspherical shape, the alignment directions of the liquid crystal molecules 12 can be uniformed in a direction parallel to the major axis of the liquid crystal microcapsule.
      <br/>
      In the fibrous liquid crystal microcapsule 6 shown in FIG. 13, since the ratio of the length in the major-axis direction to the width in the minor-axis direction is excessively high, most liquid crystal molecules 12 align themselves parallel to the major-axis direction.
      <br/>
      Hence, when the fibrous liquid crystal microcapsules 6 are used, light absorbance in the absence of applied voltage can be increased, so a liquid crystal display device capable of display at high display contrast can be obtained.
    </p>
    <p num="159">
      In the liquid crystal display device 1-2 shown in FIG. 12, the liquid crystal layer 7 has a multilayered structure of the liquid crystal microcapsule layers 8 and 9.
      <br/>
      The major-axis direction of the liquid crystal microcapsules 6 in the liquid crystal microcapsule layer 8 is different from that in the liquid crystal microcapsule layer 9.
      <br/>
      Hence, the liquid crystal display device 1-2 can display at higher display contrast.
    </p>
    <p num="160">
      The section of the fibrous liquid crystal microcapsule 6 preferably has an elliptical shape having major and minor axes or a rectangular shape having long and short sides.
      <br/>
      When the liquid crystal microcapsules 6 having such a section are aligned such that the major-axis direction of the section is parallel to the substrate surface, display at higher display contrast is allowed.
    </p>
    <p num="161">
      The fibrous liquid crystal microcapsule 6 preferably contains 75 vol % or more of a liquid crystal material.
      <br/>
      Preferably, the length of the minor axis or short side of the section of the liquid crystal microcapsule 6 is 2 to 30  MU m, and the length of the major axis or long side of the section is 2  MU m or more.
      <br/>
      When the liquid crystal microcapsule 6 has this structure, the interface area is reduced relative to the volume of the liquid crystal material, so light scattering and the driving voltage can be decreased.
    </p>
    <p num="162">The above-described fibrous liquid crystal microcapsule 6 can be formed by preparing a tube of a polymer fiber and injecting a liquid crystal material into the hollow portion.</p>
    <p num="163">
      The above-described fibrous liquid crystal microcapsules 6 can also be formed by continuously extruding a solution mixture of a liquid crystal compound, a dichroic dye, a polymer precursor, and a radical generator into a coagulating bath of a liquid or gas through nozzles or a porous film.
      <br/>
      According to this method, the fibrous liquid crystal microcapsules 6 can be continuously manufactured at high reproducibility.
      <br/>
      In this case, to form continuous fibrous liquid crystal microcapsules 6, the transparent film 11 must be formed immediately after the mixture is discharged from the nozzle.
      <br/>
      To prompt polymerization of the polymer precursor, the coagulating bath of a liquid or gas preferably has a temperature of 60 (degree)  C. or more.
    </p>
    <p num="164">
      As the liquid for the coagulating bath, water or the like can be used.
      <br/>
      As the gas, an inert gas such as nitrogen or argon can be used.
    </p>
    <p num="165">
      The surface tension of the solution mixture to the porous film is preferably 100 dyn * cm-1 or less.
      <br/>
      When the surface tension falls within the above range, the mixture extruded from the holes of the porous film is supplied into the coagulating bath without sticking to the surface of the porous film.
      <br/>
      This will be described with reference to FIGS. 14A and 14B.

    <p num="166">
      FIG. 14A is a sectional view schematically showing a method of manufacturing the liquid crystal microcapsules according to the second embodiment.

      FIG. 14B is a plan view of a porous film used for manufacturing.

    <p num="167">
      To form the fibrous liquid crystal microcapsules 6, a solution mixture 35 stored in a container 36 is extruded into hot water 18 stored in a container 17 through holes formed in a porous film 37 as shown in FIG. 14A. Holes in equal size are formed in the porous film 37, as shown in FIG. 14B. The flow of the solution mixture 35 extruded into the hot water 18 forms a transparent film on its surface.
      <br/>
      That is, fibrous liquid crystal microcapsules 6 each having the liquid crystal material 10 encapsulated by the transparent film 11 are formed.
    </p>
    <p num="168">
      However, since the solution mixture 35 immediately after extrusion from the porous film 37 has no transparent film, it may therefore stick to the contact surface between the porous film 37 and the hot water 18.
      <br/>
      In this case, the transparent film is formed on the surface of the porous film 37, and liquid crystal microcapsules 6 having a desired shape and desired composition may not be formed.
    </p>
    <p num="169">
      When the surface tension of the solution mixture 35 to the porous film 37 is set within the above range, the solution mixture 35 can be prevented from sticking to the contact surface between the porous film 37 and the hot water 18.
      <br/>
      Hence, liquid crystal microcapsules 6 having a desired shape and desired composition can be formed.
    </p>
    <p num="170">
      A flow of liquid or gas may be formed in the coagulating bath.
      <br/>
      For example, when a flow of liquid or gas parallel to the surface of the porous film is formed near the porous film in the coagulating bath, the fibrous liquid crystal microcapsules 6 can be easily collected.
      <br/>
      In addition, by making the speed of the liquid or gas flow sufficiently higher than the speed for extruding the mixture from the porous film, the length of the fibrous liquid crystal microcapsule 6 can be controlled to a desired value.

      Referring to FIG. 15, a liquid crystal microcapsule aligning apparatus 20-4 comprises a substrate support base 21 for supporting a substrate 2, and a hopper 25 for aligning liquid crystal microcapsules 6 on the substrate 2.

    <p num="173">
      To align the fibrous liquid crystal microcapsules 6 on the substrate 2 using the liquid crystal microcapsule aligning apparatus 20-4, the substrate 2 is mounted on the substrate support base 21 first.

      Subsequently, a pressure is applied into the container 28 to discharge the liquid crystal microcapsules 6 stored in the container 28 from the nozzle 26 onto the substrate 2.

      Simultaneously, the hopper 25 is translated relative to the substrate support base 21.

      FIG. 17 is a schematic sectional view of a liquid crystal display device according to the third embodiment of the present invention.
      <br/>
      Referring to FIG. 17, a liquid crystal display device 1-3 comprises a substrate 2 having an electrode 4 formed on one major surface, a substrate 3 opposing the surface of the substrate 2 with the electrode 4 and having an electrode 5 formed on the opposite surface, and a liquid crystal layer 7 sandwiched by the substrates 2 and 3.
      <br/>
      The liquid crystal layer 7 has a structure in which a liquid crystal microcapsule layer 8, a  LAMBDA /2-wavelength plate 14, and a liquid crystal microcapsule layer 9 are sequentially stacked.
      <br/>
      In the liquid crystal microcapsule layers 8 and 9, liquid crystal microcapsules 6 are aligned with their major axes parallel to each other.
      <br/>
      The directions of the major axes of the liquid crystal microcapsules 6 are equal in the liquid crystal microcapsule layers 8 and 9.
    </p>
    <p num="184">
      The  LAMBDA /2-wavelength plate 14 has two different principal refractive indices nA and nB in the third and fourth directions perpendicular to each other in its plane.
      <br/>
      The speed of light changes depending on the refractive index of a medium through which the light passes.
      <br/>
      Hence, when a linearly polarized light beam enters the  LAMBDA /2-wavelength plate 14 having different principal refractive indices nA and nB, a speed difference is generated between a light component parallel to the third direction and that parallel to the fourth direction.
      <br/>
      Consequently, the incoming linearly polarized light beam on the  LAMBDA /2-wavelength plate 14 emerges as a circularly polarized light beam, an elliptically polarized light beam, or a linearly polarized light beam.
    </p>
    <p num="185">
      The polarization state of the emerging light depends on a wavelength  LAMBDA  of incident light, and the principal refractive indices nA and nB and a thickness d of the  LAMBDA /2-wavelength plate 14.
      <br/>
      For example, as the  LAMBDA /2-wavelength plate 14, a plate having principal refractive indices nA and nB and thickness d with which a phase difference (2 n-1) PI  is formed between the polarized light component in the third direction and that in the fourth direction when a linearly polarized light beam having the wavelength  LAMBDA  is sent on the  LAMBDA /2-wavelength plate 14 is used.
      <br/>
      In this case, the linearly polarized light beam incident on the  LAMBDA /2-wavelength plate 14 leaves the plate as a linearly polarized light beam whose polarization direction is rotated.
      <br/>
      Note that n is a positive integer.
    </p>
    <p num="186">
      When the principal refractive indices nA and nB and thickness d of the  LAMBDA /2-wavelength plate 14 satisfy the above relationship for an incident light beam having the wavelength  LAMBDA , the angle the polarization direction of the incident light beam makes with that of the emerging light beam depends on the angle the third or fourth directions makes with the polarization direction of the incident light beam.
      <br/>
      To make the polarization direction of the emerging light beam perpendicular to the polarization direction of the incident light beam, the angle the third or fourth direction makes with the polarization direction of the incident light beam is set to be 45 (degree) .

    <p num="187">
      Assume that the second liquid crystal microcapsule layer 9 absorbs all light components having a polarization direction parallel to the second direction.
      <br/>
      In this case, only light components having a polarization direction perpendicular to the above light components are incident on the  LAMBDA /2-wavelength plate 14.
      <br/>
      Hence, when the angle formed by the first or second direction and the third or fourth direction is set to be 45 (degree) , the light components transmitted through the second liquid crystal microcapsule layer 9 can be launched on the first liquid crystal microcapsule layer 8 with the polarization direction rotated through 90 (degree) . That is, light components having different polarization directions can be absorbed by the first liquid crystal microcapsule layer 8 and second liquid crystal microcapsule layer 9 at a high efficiency.

      As described above, in the third embodiment, the major axes of the liquid crystal microcapsules 6 in the first and second liquid crystal microcapsule layers 8 and 9 point in the same direction.

      According to the third embodiment, the first and second liquid crystal microcapsule layers 8 and 9 can be easily formed.

    <p num="189">
      For example, a coat is formed on the substrate 2 by using a liquid crystal microcapsule coating solution prepared by dispersing spherical liquid crystal microcapsules into water or the like.
      <br/>
      This coat is dried, and then, the  LAMBDA /2-wavelength plate 14 is placed on the dried coat.
      <br/>
      Another coat is formed on the  LAMBDA /2-wavelength plate 14 using the liquid crystal microcapsule coating solution.
      <br/>
      This coat is dried, and a flat plate is placed on the dried coat.
      <br/>
      This flat plate is slightly translated relative to the substrate 2 while pressing the flat plate against the substrate 2.
      <br/>
      With this process, the liquid crystal microcapsules on and under the  LAMBDA /2-wavelength plate 14 are stretched in the moving direction of the flat plate, so the first and second liquid crystal microcapsule layers 8 and 9 are formed.
    </p>
    <p num="190">
      As described above, the polarization state by the  LAMBDA /2-wavelength plate 14 changes depending on the wavelength  LAMBDA  of incident light, and the principal refractive indices nA and nB and the thickness d of the  LAMBDA /2-wavelength plate 14.
      <br/>
      That is, the  LAMBDA /2-wavelength plate 14 to be used must be appropriately selected in accordance with the wavelength of light components to be rotated in polarization direction, i.e., a specific wavelength.
      <br/>
      This specific wavelength only need be included in the absorption wavelength band of the dichroic dye contained in the liquid crystal microcapsules 6.
      <br/>
      However, the specific wavelength is preferably equal to the maximum absorption wavelength of the dichroic dye.

      As the liquid crystal material, a material prepared by adding 1 wt % of black dichroic dye S-435 available from Mitsui Toatsu Chemicals to Lixon-4033xx having a positive dielectric anisotropy, available from Chisso, was used.
      <br/>
      Eighty parts by weight of this liquid crystal material, 14 parts by weight of methyl methacrylate as a monomer, 1 part by weight of divinyl benzene as a crosslinker, and 0.2 parts by weight of benzoyl peroxide as a crosslinker were mixed and dissolved.
      <br/>
      The resultant solution mixture was extruded from pores of a hydrophilic porous glass tube with an average pore size of 1  MU m into a 0.3 wt % aqueous solution of polyvinyl alcohol at a period of 10 Hz, maximum pressure of 1.5 atm, and minimum pressure of 1.2 atm, thereby obtaining an emulsion.

      After the liquid crystal microcapsules 6 were allowed to settle on the surface of the porous glass plate, vacuum-suction from the lower surface of the porous glass plate was done.
      <br/>
      The solution used to disperse the liquid crystal microcapsules 6 was removed through holes formed in the porous glass plate, so a liquid crystal microcapsule layer was formed on the surface of the porous glass plate.

    <p num="250">
      This liquid crystal microcapsule layer was transferred from the porous glass plate to the surface of the glass substrate 2 with the ITO film 4 to form a liquid crystal layer 7 on the glass substrate 2.
      <br/>
      In addition, the glass substrate 3 was placed on the liquid crystal layer 7 such that the surface having the ITO film 5 came into contact with the liquid crystal layer 7, and pressed against the glass substrate 2 while heating the structure in vacuum, thus completing the liquid crystal display device 1-5.

      When the liquid crystal microcapsules 6 were formed into an aspherical shape, e.g., a spheroidal shape, and the width of the groove was smaller than the length of the major axis of the liquid crystal microcapsule 6, all the liquid crystal microcapsules 6 could be aligned while matching the major-axis directions.

    <p num="326">
      Liquid crystal microcapsules having an average grain size of 10  MU m were prepared using the liquid crystal material used in Example 11.
      <br/>
      The liquid crystal microcapsules were dispersed into a predetermined solution to prepare a liquid crystal microcapsule coating solution.
      <br/>
      This liquid crystal microcapsule coating solution was applied to a glass substrate having an ITO film formed on one major surface, and dried to form a liquid crystal layer.
      <br/>
      A glass substrate having an ITO film formed on one major surface is heated and pressed against the liquid crystal layer in vacuum, thus completing a liquid crystal display device.

      The resultant liquid crystal display device was observed with a microscope.
      <br/>
      In both liquid crystal microcapsule layers 8 and 9, each liquid crystal microcapsule 6 had a major axis with a length about 1.3 times the maximum value of the diameter perpendicular to the major axis.
      <br/>
      In the liquid crystal microcapsule layers 8 and 9, the liquid crystal microcapsules were aligned at random.

    <p num="328">
      In the liquid crystal display device, the contrast ratio measured under the same conditions as in Example 11 was 6:1.
      <br/>
      As one of the reasons for the lower contrast ratio than that of the liquid crystal display device of Example 11, when spherical liquid crystal microcapsules are used, many dichroic dye molecules lie perpendicular to the substrate surface or make certain angles with the substrate surface even in the absence of applied voltage.
      <br/>
      That is, since the ratio of dichroic dye molecules aligned parallel to the substrate surface is low in the absence of applied voltage, the light absorption efficiency is reduced.

    <p num="434">EXAMPLE 27</p>
    <p num="435">
      A liquid crystal display device 1-1 shown in FIG. 1 was manufactured by the following method.
      <br/>
      In this example, the liquid crystal material contains no dichroic dye.
    </p>
    <p num="436">
      Ninety-two parts by weight of a fluorine-based liquid crystal Lixon-5052xx having a large refractive index anisotropy  DELTA n, available from Chisso, 4 parts by weight of di-isobutyl fumarate as a monomer, 0.8 parts by weight of divinyl benzene as a crosslinker, and 0.2 parts by weight of benzoyl peroxide as a crosslinker were mixed and dissolved.
      <br/>
      Using a film emulsifier available from Ise Kagaku, this solution mixture was extruded from pores of a hydrophilic porous glass tube with an average pore size of 1  MU m into a 0.3 wt % aqueous solution of polyvinyl alcohol (molecular weight: 1000) at a static pressure of 1.5 atm, thereby obtaining an emulsion.
    </p>
    <p num="437">
      This emulsion was stirred at a temperature of 90 (degree)  C. and a stirring speed of 50 rpm for 1 hr to polymerize the monomer components.
      <br/>
      After one hour, the product was poured into a porous tube of an ion exchange resin together with pure water to purify the product, thereby obtaining liquid crystal microcapsules 6.
      <br/>
      The liquid crystal microcapsules 6 had excellent dispersion properties for water or the like.
      <br/>
      Even when a dispersion obtained by dispersing the liquid crystal microcapsules 6 into water or the like was left to stand for one day, no coagulation occurred.
    </p>
    <p num="438">
      When the particle size distribution of the liquid crystal microcapsules 6 was measured by laser scattering, the average grain size was 6  MU m, and the distribution width was narrow.
      <br/>
      When the liquid crystal microcapsules were observed with a microscope, the liquid crystal microcapsules had a spherical shape.
    </p>
    <p num="439">
      Subsequently, 80 wt % of the liquid crystal microcapsules and 20 wt % of a solution mixture of water and ethylene glycol were mixed to prepare a liquid crystal microcapsule coating solution.
      <br/>
      In this solution mixture, the weight ratio of water and ethylene glycol was 1.
    </p>
    <p num="440">The liquid crystal microcapsule coating solution was applied to a polyethylene film 53 and dried to form a coat 54, as shown in FIG. 24A. The thickness of the coat 54 was 11  MU m. The coat 54 was peeled from the polyethylene film 53, as shown in FIG. 24B. The coat 54 was stretched until the thickness became 5  MU m while holding the two end portions, as shown in FIG. 24C. With this process, a liquid crystal microcapsule layer 8 was formed.</p>
    <p num="441">
      After formation of the liquid crystal microcapsule layer 8, a liquid crystal microcapsule layer 9 was formed by the same method.
      <br/>
      The liquid crystal microcapsule layers 8 and 9 were inserted between a glass substrate 2 having an aluminum reflection electrode 4 and a substrate 3 having an ITO transparent electrode 5.
      <br/>
      The liquid crystal microcapsule layers 8 and 9 were stacked such that pulling directions 55-1 and 55-2 were perpendicular to each other, as shown in FIG. 26. The substrate 3 was pressed against the substrate 2 at 120 (degree)  C. and 5 Torr, thus completing the liquid crystal display device 1-1 shown in FIG. 1.

    <p num="442">
      The liquid crystal display device 1-1 was observed with a microscope.

      Destruction of the transparent films of the liquid crystal microcapsules 6 was not confirmed.
      <br/>
      The thickness of a liquid crystal layer 7 was 10  MU m. In both the liquid crystal microcapsule layers 8 and 9, the major axis of each liquid crystal microcapsule 6 had a length about 3.5 times the maximum value of the diameter perpendicular to the major axis.
      <br/>
      The alignment direction of liquid crystal molecules was parallel to the substrate surface, and the liquid crystal molecules in the liquid crystal microcapsule layer 8 were aligned to be perpendicular to those in the liquid crystal microcapsule layer 9.
    </p>
    <p num="443">
      When an AC voltage of 10 V at 50 Hz was applied to the liquid crystal display device 1-1, the light scattered state in the absence of applied voltage changed to a light transmitted state.
      <br/>
      The contrast ratio obtained by a reflection densitometer was 20:1.
    </p>
    <p num="444">
      In Examples 1 to 27, the volume percentage of the liquid crystal material in the liquid crystal microcapsules 6 was 70 vol % or more.
      <br/>
      In Examples 1 to 27, the variation in alignment direction of each liquid crystal microcapsule 6 from the average alignment direction of the liquid crystal microcapsules 6 fell within the range of 10 (degree) .
    </p>
    <p num="445">
      As described above, to efficiently absorb light in the absence of applied voltage, the alignment direction of liquid crystal molecules must be parallel to the substrate surface.
      <br/>
      However, when the conventional spherical liquid crystal microcapsules are used, the liquid crystal molecules in the liquid crystal microcapsules are aligned at random.
      <br/>
      More specifically, in many liquid crystal microcapsules, the liquid crystal molecules are not aligned parallel to the substrate surface.
      <br/>
      For this reason, according to the conventional liquid crystal display device, the light absorbance in the absence of applied voltage is insufficient, so no high display contrast can be obtained.
    </p>
    <p num="446">
      According to the present invention, liquid crystal microcapsules are formed into an appropriate shape, so the liquid crystal molecules in the liquid crystal microcapsules in the absence of applied voltage are always aligned in a predetermined direction.
      <br/>
      In addition, according to the present invention, the alignment direction of liquid crystal microcapsules is controlled using the shape of the liquid crystal microcapsules.
      <br/>
      Hence, in the present invention, the alignment direction of liquid crystal molecules in the liquid crystal microcapsules in the absence of applied voltage can be controlled to be, e.g., parallel to the substrate surface.
      <br/>
      That is, the light absorbance in the absence of applied voltage can be increased.
    </p>
    <p num="447">
      In the present invention, the liquid crystal layer has a multilayered structure in which two liquid crystal microcapsule layers are stacked.
      <br/>
      In each liquid crystal microcapsule layer, the liquid crystal microcapsules are aligned in one direction.
      <br/>
      As described above, the shape of the liquid crystal microcapsules has correlation with the alignment direction of liquid crystal molecules.
      <br/>
      Hence, in all liquid crystal microcapsules in each liquid crystal microcapsule layer, the liquid crystal molecules are aligned in the same direction in the absence of applied voltage.
    </p>
    <p num="448">
      According to the present invention, the alignment directions of liquid crystal molecules in each liquid crystal microcapsule layer are uniformed, and the alignment directions of liquid crystal molecules are different between the liquid crystal microcapsule layers.
      <br/>
      More specifically, light incident on the liquid crystal layer is transmitted through at least two liquid crystal microcapsules in which the alignment directions of liquid crystal molecules are different.
      <br/>
      The at least two liquid crystal microcapsules can absorb different polarized light components.
      <br/>
      Hence, according to the present invention, the light absorbance in the absence of applied voltage can be further improved.
    </p>
    <p num="449">
      In the present invention, as described above, the alignment directions of liquid crystal molecules are uniformed in each of the two liquid crystal microcapsule layers stacked.
      <br/>
      With this arrangement, the alignment direction of liquid crystal molecules can be easily changed between the liquid crystal microcapsule layers.
      <br/>
      In addition, the difference in alignment direction of liquid crystal molecules between the liquid crystal microcapsule layers can be uniformed.
    </p>
    <p num="450">In the present invention, when the liquid crystal layer has two or more liquid crystal microcapsule layers, the above-described effect can be obtained.</p>
    <p num="451">As described above, according to the present invention, when the liquid crystal microcapsules are formed into an aspherical shape, the ratio of the liquid crystal material aligned in the major-axis direction of the liquid crystal microcapsule can be increased, so a liquid crystal display device capable of display at high contrast is provided.</p>
    <p num="452">
      In addition, according to the present invention, the liquid crystal layer has a multilayered structure in which first and second liquid crystal microcapsule layers are stacked, and the alignment direction of liquid crystal material is changed between the liquid crystal microcapsule layers.
      <br/>
      With this arrangement, a polarized light component which cannot be absorbed by one liquid crystal microcapsule layer can be easily absorbed by the other liquid crystal microcapsule layer.
      <br/>
      Therefore, according to the present invention, a liquid crystal display device capable of display at high contrast is provided.
