    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="1">
      1.
      <br/>
      Field of the Invention
    </p>
    <p num="2">The present invention relates to an improved structure for connecting the rack of the main circuit board in a computer housing, and particularly to a rack with a slidable structure that facilitates convenient assembly during manufacturing.</p>
    <p num="3">2. The Related Art</p>
    <p num="4">
      The assembly of computers is an extremely competitive industry where the most successful competitors often have the most expeditious assembly process.
      <br/>
      Cheaper and cheaper computer hardware and software continues to be developed, increasing the relative importance of the cost of assembly, and providing an increased portion of profit margin from new developments in assembly.
      <br/>
      A conventional computer housing is shaped like a box enclosed by bottom, top, front, rear and a side panels, its interior containing subsystem components, such as disk drives, a CD-ROM, a motherboard, and a switching power supply.
      <br/>
      A front panel is adapted to expose the face of Floppy Disk Drives (FDD) and Compact Disc Drives (CD), and a rear panel is adapted to accommodate inputs and outputs, while a side panel is adapted to fix the motherboard thereon.
      <br/>
      Such a housing is adapted for assembling in a single assembly line.
      <br/>
      Since assembly can be very complicated and involve numerous components in such a computer, especially for multi-media computers, quality control on the single assembly line can be difficult.
      <br/>
      When problems occur in one of the assembly links, the entire assembly line may be halted.
    </p>
    <p num="5">Further, due to the compact, internal space of the computer and the packed arrangement of the components in the computer, the assembly of a motherboard is the most time-consuming workstation and the most likely to cause delays in the assembly line as a result of inefficiency.</p>
    <p num="6">The present invention overcomes the above disadvantages by providing an improved structure for connecting the main circuit board rack in the computer housing.</p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="7">It is, therefore, an object of the present invention to provide an improved structure for connecting a main circuit board rack in a computer housing, thereby allowing the computer housing to be manufactured in two assembly lines, the main circuit board being assembled to the rack at one workstation to form a module, and then being slidably assembled into the computer housing on a main assembly line, thereby increasing manufacturing efficiency, elevating productivity, and yielding better control over quality, thereby reducing the manufacturing cost.</p>
    <p num="8">It is another object of the present invention to provide an improved structure for guidingly engaging and securing a main circuit board within a computer housing.</p>
    <p num="9">It is a further object of the present invention to provide a main circuit board rack for being mounted in a computer housing by self-guiding interengagements collaborating with only one fastener.</p>
    <p num="10">
      A structure for mounting a main circuit board in a computer housing according to the present invention includes a main circuit board rack, a rail formed on the drive cage of the computer housing, posts defined on the bottom panel of the computer housing and on the rack, and slots defined in the rail and on the rack.
      <br/>
      The upper and the lower edges of the rack are respectively bent into an upper flange and a lower flange for respectively contacting the rail and the bottom panel.
      <br/>
      The lower flange has slots to engage the posts of the bottom panel.
      <br/>
      The upper flange has posts to engage the slots of the rail.
      <br/>
      Each of the slots is in the shape of an L and includes a guiding portion and a main portion to provide the corresponding post with self-guiding interengagement therein.
    </p>
    <p num="11">Other objects, advantages and novel features of the invention will become more apparent from the following detailed description of a preferred embodiment thereof when taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, wherein:</p>

    <p num="14">
      The present invention is applicable to general computer systems including personal computers, servers and other devices mounting main circuit boards.
      <br/>
      To facilitate description of the present invention, a personal computer with a motherboard is used as an example.
      <br/>
      FIGS. 1 and 2 illustrate a structure for mounting a motherboard in a computer housing which comprises a rack 10, a guide rail 12, posts 14a, 14b and corresponding slots 24a, 24b, and a fastener 16.
      <br/>
      The rack 10 is in a planar board shape mounted and retained between two members in the computer housing.
      <br/>
      One of the members is a drive cage 18, the other is a bottom panel 38.
      <br/>
      The guide rail 12 is formed by extending a side edge of the drive cage 18 outwardly and then bending it vertically downward into an L-shape, forming a horizontal flat board portion 20 and a vertical retaining board portion 22.
      <br/>
      A pair of slots 24b is defined in the flat board portion 20.
      <br/>
      The posts 14a, 14b are formed on an inner surface of the bottom panel 38 and on an upper edge of the rack 10.
    </p>
    <p num="15">
      The upper and the lower edges of the rack 10 are respectively bent into an upper flange 32 and a lower flange 34 extending in the same direction.
      <br/>
      The upper flange 32 and the lower flange 34 respectively contact the flat board portion 20 of the rail 12 and the bottom panel 38 and are limited therebetween.
      <br/>
      The upper flange 32 forms two posts 14b extending upwardly for engaging with corresponding slots 24b in the flat board portion 20.
      <br/>
      The lower flange 34 defines two slots 24a to engage with two corresponding posts 14a which are formed on the bottom panel 38.
      <br/>
      The posts 14a, 14b may slide in and self-guidingly interengage with the corresponding slots 24a, 24b, which makes the rack 10 slidably mounted between the rail 12 and the bottom panel 38.
    </p>
    <p num="16">
      Referring to FIGS. 3A-3B, each of the slots 24a, 24b is L-shaped and comprises a guiding portion 26 and a main portion 28.
      <br/>
      The slot 24b of the rail 12 is illustrated in FIG. 3A, where the guiding portion 26 is seen to extend through a wall of the drive cage 18 to a middle of the flat board portion 20, where it connects at a right angle with the main portion 28.
      <br/>
      The slot 24a of the lower flange 34 of the rack 10 is illustrated in FIG. 3B, where it is shown to extend through the body of the rack 10 to a middle of the lower flange 34, where it connects at a right angle with the main portion 28.
      <br/>
      The guide portion 26 of each slot 24a or 24b is wider than the main portion 28, allowing a post 14a or 14b to enter the corresponding slot 24a or 24b at a guide portion 26 and to slidingly move in the main portion 28, where it is restrained from vertical movement.
      <br/>
      Referring to FIG. 3A and FIG. 2, there is a first hole 30 defined in the retaining board portion 22 of the rail 12, and the rack 10 defines a second hole 36 corresponding to the first hole 30 for insertion of the fastener 16 therethrough.
      <br/>
      The hole 30 may be a screw hole and the fastener 16 may be a bolt capable of engaging with the hole 30, allowing it to fasten the rack 10 to the guide rail 12.
    </p>
    <p num="17">
      FIGS. 4-5 illustrate the assembly of the rack 10 in the computer housing.
      <br/>
      Firstly set the rack 10 between the drive cage 18 and the bottom panel 38 and align the posts 14a, 14b with the corresponding guiding portions 26 of the slots 24a, 24b.
      <br/>
      Then push the rack 10 so that the posts 14a, 14b slide along the corresponding guiding portions 26 to the main portions 28, as shown in FIG. 4.
      <br/>
      Finally, as shown in FIG. 5, slide the rack 10 along the rail 12 so that the posts 14b of the upper flange 32 slide in the corresponding main portions 28 of the rail 12 and the posts 14a of the bottom panel 38 slide in the corresponding main portions 28 in the lower flange 34 of the rack 10.
      <br/>
      The first and the second holes 30, 36 should now align with each other.
      <br/>
      By locking the fastener 16 in the first and the second holes 30, 36, the rack 10 is firmly secured in the computer housing.
    </p>
    <p num="18">The primary objective of the present invention is to provide an easily installed main circuit board rack 10 which will allow a main circuit board to be separately assembled to the rack 10 at a separate workstation and which can then be quickly installed in the computer housing in an assembly line, thereby increasing manufacturing efficiency, elevating productivity, and providing better quality control, thereby reducing the manufacturing cost.</p>
