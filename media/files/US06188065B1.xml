    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">The present invention concerns a mass spectrometer combined with a sample separation apparatus used for separation and analysis of mixed biological samples, for example, sugar, peptide and protein.</p>
    <p num="3">
      In the field of analysis, an importance has been attached to the development of mass spectrometry for biological compounds at present.
      <br/>
      Since the biological compounds are usually dissolved as a mixture in a solution, development has been progressed to a mass spectrometer combined with the sample separation apparatus for separating the mixture.
      <br/>
      As a typical example, there can be mentioned a combined apparatus of capillary electrophoresis apparatus-mass spectrometer utilizing capillary electrophoresis for the separation of the sample.
      <br/>
      The capillary electrophoresis is excellent in the separation of the mixture but can not identify substances.
      <br/>
      On the other hand, the mass spectrometer has a high analyzing sensitivity and is excellent for the ability of identifying substances but analysis of the mixture is difficult.
      <br/>
      In view of the above, a sample is separated by the capillary electrophoresis apparatus and the separated sample is analyzed by the mass spectrometer.
      <br/>
      Thus, the mass spectrometer combined with the capillary electrophoresis apparatus is much effective for the analysis of a mixture.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      An existent mass spectrometer combined with the capillary electrophoresis apparatus described above is described in Analytical Chemistry, Vol. 60, No. 18, Sep. 15, 1988, pp. 1948-1952. The existent mass spectrometer will be explained with reference to FIG. 13. In the mass spectrometer of the prior art, an electrospray ionization method is used for ionization of a sample.
      <br/>
      A capillary 1 is a fused-silica capillary having an outer diameter of about several hundreds micrometer and an inner diameter of about several tens micrometer.
      <br/>
      The inside of the capillary 1 is filled with a buffer solution.
      <br/>
      A sample solution is introduced from one end 2a to the inside of the capillary 1.
      <br/>
      After introduction of the sample solution, the end 2a is kept in a buffer vessel 4 filled with a buffer solution 3.
      <br/>
      The other end 2b of the capillary 1 is inserted to the inside of a metal tube 5.
      <br/>
      Generally, a flow rate of a buffer flowing through the capillary is small and it is often difficult to nebulize the sample solution stably and continuously.
      <br/>
      Then, a sheath liquid 6 is introduced in a gap between the capillary 1 and the metal tube 5 for assisting nebulization.
      <br/>
      When a high voltage is applied from a high voltage power source 7a between one end 2a of the capillary 1 and the metal tube 5, since the end 2b of the capillary 1 is electrically connected by way of the sheath liquid 6 with the metal tube 5, a high voltage is applied between both ends 2a and 2b of the capillary 1.
      <br/>
      Thus, the sample is sent to the end 2b while undergoing electrophoretic separation in the capillary 1.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      The sample reaching the end 2b is mixed with the sheath liquid 6 and then electrosprayed by a voltage applied between the metal tube 5 and an opposing electrode 8a by power source 9 for a nebulizer.
      <br/>
      Ions relevant to the sample molecules are contained in droplets formed by the electrospray.
      <br/>
      The ions relevant to the sample molecules are entered through a sampling aperture 10a into a differential pumping region 12 evacuated by an evacuation system 11a and, further, enter a vacuum region 13 evacuated to a high vacuum degree by a vacuum system 11b.
      <br/>
      The ions entering the vacuum region 13 are subjected to mass separation in a mass analysis region 14 and the mass-separated ions are detected by an ion detector 15.
      <br/>
      A detection signal from the detector 15 is sent by way of a signal line 16 to a data processing apparatus 17 and put to data processing to obtain a result of mass spectrometry for the sample substance.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      In the existent mass spectrometer combined with the capillary electrophoresis apparatus described above, electrospray ionization is used for ionization of the sample.
      <br/>
      The electrospray ionization is a method of taking out highly polar substances such as protein or peptide present as ions in a solution as gaseous ions.
      <br/>
      Therefore, neutral substances not possessing charges in the solution can not be detected at a high sensitivity in the mass spectrometer combined with the existent capillary electrophoretic apparatus.
      <br/>
      Since such neutral substances include, for example, amines in various kinds of medicines and neutrotransmitters, it is extremely important to analyze electrically neutral samples for the study in the field of biotechnology or medicine.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      Further, as one of methods for separation of samples by capillary electrophoresis, micellar electrokinetic chromatography has been known.
      <br/>
      In the micellar electrokinetic chromatography, micelles are formed by adding a surfactant to a buffer solution, and a neutral substance not having charges is separated by utilizing the difference of distribution when each of the sample compounds is distributed in the micelles.
      <br/>
      Also in this case, for extending an application range of the mass spectrometer combined with the capillary electrophoresis apparatus, it has been desired for the development of an apparatus capable of analyzing, at a high sensitivity, neutral substances having no charges in the solution.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      Further, the ion intensity obtained by the existent electrospray ionization method is approximately given by the following equation Electrophoresis, Vol. 14, 1993, pp. 448-457:
      <br/>
      I(A+) varies as V(A+)/V(C+)  (1)
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      where I(A+) represents a signal intensity of ion A+ as an object of analysis, V(A+) represents a flow rate of ion A+ to be analyzed, and V(C+) represents a flow rate of contaminant ions other than ion A+ to be analyzed.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, for attaining mass spectrometry at a high sensitivity by using the electrospray ionization method, it is important to remove contaminant ion C+ in the sample solution.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      On the other hand, in the capillary electrophoresis method, a method of adding a salt at high concentration in a buffer solution for electrophoresis is generally used for preventing sample molecules from adsorbing on wall surfaces or the like.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, since contaminant ions (for example, Na+, K+) formed by dissociation of the salt are contained in a great amount in the ions obtained by electrospray, the denominator: V(C+) in the formula increases remarkably to reduce the signal intensity of the ion as an object of the analysis.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, in the existent mass spectrometer employing electrospray for the ionization of the sample, it was difficult to obtain a signal of the ion as an object of analysis at a sufficient intensity.
    </p>
    <p num="11">
      Further, in micellar electrokinetic chromatography, analysis is effected by forming micelles of a surface active agent such as SDS (sodium dodecyl sulfate) in a buffer.
      <br/>
      For forming the micelles, it is necessary to add a surfactant at a concentration exceeding a critical value (critical micelle concentration) in the buffer.
      <br/>
      Under micelle-forming conditions, cations and anions liberated from the surfactant are present in a great amount as contaminant ions in the buffer.
      <br/>
      Therefore, in the existent apparatus using the electrospray ionization method, measurement of the sample molecular ions is difficult by the effect of the contaminant ions.
    </p>
    <p num="12">With the reasons described above, it has been strongly demanded for providing a mass spectrometer combined with a sample separation apparatus such as a capillary electrophoresis apparatus improved so as to less undergo the effect of the salt in the buffer.</p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="13">A first object of the present invention is to provide a mass spectrometer capable of separating an electrically neutral substance present in a solvent which was difficult to be ionized by an existent electrospray ionization method and analyzing the same at a high sensitivity.</p>
    <p num="14">A second object of the present invention is to provide a mass spectrometer capable of using, to a sample separation apparatus, a buffer for electrophoresis which was difficult to be used in an existent mass spectrometer combined with a capillary electrophoresis apparatus.</p>
    <p num="15">
      In accordance with the present invention, a sample solution is separated by using a sample separation apparatus such as a capillary electrophoresis apparatus, the separated sample solution is nebulized by flowing from a capillary, gaseous sample molecules formed by vaporization of liquid droplets resulting from nebulization are ionized by chemical reaction, and the ions of the thus obtained sample molecules are subjected to mass spectrometry in a mass analysis region.
      <br/>
      The nebulization, vaporization and ionization are conducted in an air under an atmospheric pressure or a reduced pressure.
    </p>
    <p num="16">
      FIG. 1 shows a basic constitution of a mass spectrometer according to the present invention by using a capillary electrophoresis apparatus as a sample separation apparatus.
      <br/>
      In FIG. 1, a sample separated in a capillary electrophoresis region 18 is nebulized together with a buffer solution in a nebulization region 19.
      <br/>
      Liquid droplets formed by nebulization are vaporized in a vaporization region 20.
      <br/>
      Gaseous sample molecules formed in the vaporization region 20 are ionized in a chemical ionization region 21 by chemically reacting with ions derived from gaseous molecules present in the ionization region 21.
      <br/>
      For promoting the ionization by the chemical reaction, a corona discharging process to be described later may be used.
    </p>
    <p num="17">
      Ions relevant to the sample molecules obtained in the ionization region 21 enter by way of a sampling aperture 10a into a differential pumping region 12 evacuated by a vacuum system 11a and, further, enters passing through a sampling aperture 10b into a vacuum region 13 evacuated to a high vacuum degree by a vacuum system 11b.
      <br/>
      Ions entering the vacuum region 13 are put to mass separation in a mass analysis region 14 and detected by an ion detector 15.
      <br/>
      A detection signal from the ion detector 15 is sent by way of a signal line 16 to a data processing unit 17 for data processing.
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      The chemical ionization region 21 may be disposed in the differential pumping region 12.
      <br/>
      The inside of the differential pumping region 12 is kept at a pressure from several Pa to several hundred Pa.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, the sample molecules collide against gaseous molecule ions present in the differential pumping region to form ions of the sample molecules by the chemical reaction.
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      As the separation mode in the capillary zone electrophoresis region 18, there can be mentioned various modes such as capillary zone electrophoresis, capillary gel electrophoresis, capillary isoelectric focusing electrophoresis and micellar electrokinetic chromatography.
      <br/>
      In the capillary zone electrophoresis, a free solvent is filled in the capillary and the sample is separated due to the difference of the mobility of the sample.
      <br/>
      In the capillary gel electrophoresis, a gel is filled in the capillary and the specimen is separated by utilizing the molecular sieve effect of the gel.
      <br/>
      In the capillary isoelectric focusing electrophoresis, a gradient is provided to a hydrogen ion concentration in the capillary and the sample is separated depending on the difference of isoelectric point of the sample.
      <br/>
      In the micellar electrokinetic chromatography, micelles formed by adding a surface active agent to the buffer solution, and the sample is separated by utilizing the difference of distribution of the micelles to each of the sample compounds.
      <br/>
      In the present invention any of the separation modes described previously may be used.
    </p>
    <p num="20">
      In the nebulization region 19, the sample solution can be nebulized by using a nebulizing means using an electrospray means, nebulization by heating, pneumatic nebulization means or nebulization means using ultrasonic oscillator.
      <br/>
      In the vaporization region 20, the nebulized sample solution can be vaporized by using vaporization means such as a heated metal block or infrared irradiation.
    </p>
    <p num="21">
      In the chemical ionization region 21, ions relevant to sample molecules A are formed mainly by the following proton addition reaction or proton elimination reaction assuming the sample molecule as an object of analysis as A and gaseous molecules chemically reacting therewith as B:
      <br/>
      A+BH+ --&gt; AH+ +B (proton addition reaction)  (2)
      <br/>
      A+B- --&gt; (A-H)- +BH (proton elimination reaction)  (3)
    </p>
    <p num="22">
      For instance, hydronium ion (H3 O+) or cluster ion thereof �H3 O+ (H2 O)n � are formed by generating corona discharge in atmospheric air.
      <br/>
      The thus formed ions react with the sample molecules A as shown below to form ions AH+ relevant to the sample molecule A:
      <br/>
      A+H3 O+ --&gt; AH+ +H2 O  (4)
      <br/>
      A+H3 O+ (H2 O)n --&gt; AH+ +(n+1)H2 O  (5)
    </p>
    <p num="23">
      In this way, when the sample solution reaching the exit end of the capillary is nebulized and the resultant gaseous sample molecules are ionized by the chemical reaction, ions relevant to the sample molecules not having charges in the solution can be obtained.
      <br/>
      When the thus obtained ions are subjected to mass analysis in the mass analysis region, sample molecules having no charges in the solution can be analyzed.
      <br/>
      As a result, the application range of the mass spectrometer combined with the capillary electrophoresis apparatus can be extended remarkably.
    </p>
    <p num="24">
      Further, in an existent mass spectrometer using the electrospray ionization method, ionic substances ionized in the solution can also be detected at a high sensitivity.
      <br/>
      On the other hand, in the present invention using the chemical ionization method by corona discharge, such ionizing substances are less detected rather.
      <br/>
      This is probably attributable to that since the ionic substances flies as gaseous ions toward the sampling aperture 10a merely by being nebulized (electrosprayed) in the nebulization region 19, the flying trace is bent by an electric field for generating corona discharge in the ionization region 21 and can not reach as far as the sampling aperture.
      <br/>
      That is, the sample molecules carrying no static charges and reaching as far as the ionization region 12 is at first ionized and analyzed by the chemical ionization method in the ionization region 21.
      <br/>
      Namely, the sample molecules that can be analyzed in the mass spectrometer according to the present invention are mainly neutral molecules in the solution, whereas the sample molecules that can be analyzed in the existent mass spectrometer are mainly ionic molecules in the solution.
      <br/>
      As described above, the mass spectrometer according to the present invention and the existent mass spectrometer have a so-called relationship complementary to each other.
      <br/>
      The mass spectrometer according to the present invention combined with the capillary electrophoresis apparatus has a low sensitivity to ions derived from a salt if it is incorporated in a buffer for electrophoresis.
      <br/>
      In addition, the range for the selection of the buffer solution can be extended in the mass spectrometer according to the present invention, compared with the existent mass spectrometer combined with the capillary electrophoresis apparatus.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, the application range of the mass spectrometer combined with the sample separation apparatus such as the capillary electrophoresis apparatus can be extended outstandingly according to the present invention.
      <br/>
      As the sample separation apparatus, liquid chromatographic apparatus can be used in addition to the capillary electrophoresis apparatus described above.
      <br/>
      Further, if separation of the sample solution is not necessary, the sample solution may be introduced by a flow injection method into the capillary and then nebulized from the exit of the capillary.
    </p>
    <p num="25">These and other objects and many of the attendant advantages of the invention will be readily appreciated as the same becomes better understood by reference to the following detailed description when considered in connection with the accompanying drawings.</p>

      When a high voltage at about several tens kV is applied between one end 2a of the capillary 1 and the metal tube 5 from a high voltage power source 7a, since the other end 2b of the capillary 1 is electrically connected with the metal tube 5 by way of the nebulization sheath liquid 6, the voltage is applied between both ends 2a and 2b of the capillary 1.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, the sample is sent toward the end 2b while undergoing electrophoretic separation in the capillary 1.
      <br/>
      The sample, when it reaches the end 2b, is mixed with the sheath liquid 6 and then electrostatically sprayed (nebulized) by a high voltage at several KV applied from a power source 9 for a nebulizer between the metal tube 5 and a metal block 22.
      <br/>
      The metal block 22 is heated by a heater (not illustrated) to about 300 (degree)  C. Liquid droplets of the sample formed by electrospray are heated and vaporized during passage through a through hole 23 in the metal block 22.

      A needle electrode 24 is disposed near the sample aperture 10a of about 0.3 mm diameter disposed to an electrode 8a.

      A high voltage at several KV is applied to the needle electrode 24 from a high voltage power source 7b, by which corona discharge is generated between the needle electrode 24 and the electrode 8a (in atmosphere) to form primary ions such as hydronium ions.
      <br/>
      When the gaseous molecules of the sample formed by vaporization of the liquid droplets of the sample reach the corona discharging region, the gaseous molecules of the sample take place chemical reaction (proton addition reaction or proton elimination reaction) as shown in the formulae (2) and (3) described previously) with the primary ions such as hydronium ions formed by the corona discharge and ionized.

      <br/>
      In this embodiment, an exit end 2b of a capillary 1 is disposed in a vaporization region 20.
      <br/>
      As shown in FIG. 3, a sample solution from a capillary 1 is sprayed to a metal block 22' constituting a vaporization region.
      <br/>
      The sample solution is electrosprayed (nebulized) between a metal tube 5 and the metal block 22' surrounding the capillary 1 by a high voltage applied from a power source 9.
      <br/>
      The metal tube 5 and the metal block 22' are insulated from each other by an insulation tube 25.
      <br/>
      Liquid droplets of the sample blown to the metal block 22' heated to a temperature higher than the boiling point of the sample solution are instantaneously vaporized into a gaseous molecules of the sample.
      <br/>
      When the sample molecules reach a corona discharge region, they take place chemical reaction with primary ions such as hydronium ions formed by corona discharge, and the sample molecules are ionized.
      <br/>
      The thus obtained ions relevant to the sample molecules are introduced passing through a sample aperture 10a into a differential pumping region 12 evacuated to about several tens Pa to several hundreds Pa and, further, taken by way of a sample aperture 10b into a vacuum region 13 evacuated to about 10-3 Pa.
      <br/>
      The ions relevant to the sample molecules taken into the vacuum region 13 are subjected to mass analysis by a mass analysis region 14 and an ion detector 15.
      <br/>
      For improving the efficiency of the sample molecules to reach the ionizing region (corona discharge region), a gas 26 such as nitrogen or air is caused to flow from a gas reservoir to a through hole disposed in the metal block 22'. The gas 26 may also be caused to flow in the through hole under compression by a compressor.
      <br/>
      Gaseous molecules of the sample formed by electrospraying the sample solution to a portion of an inclined wall disposed in the through hole of the metal block 22' are transported efficiently by the flow of the gas 26 to the ionizing region (corona discharging region).

      The gas 26 is desirably heated previously to a temperature higher than a room temperature.

      FIG. 4 shows a third embodiment according to the present invention.
      <br/>
      In the constitution shown previously in FIG. 2, when large liquid of the sample droplets are formed upon electrospray in a nebulization region 19, liquid droplets of the sample are sometimes not vaporized completely in the vaporization region 20 that employs a vaporization method using the heated metal block 22 but liquid droplets of the sample reach as they are to the ionization region (corona discharging region) 21.
      <br/>
      In such an instance, liquid droplets of the sample reaching the corona discharging region may possibly cause electric short-circuit between the needle electrode 24 and the electrode 8a to bring about a trouble, for example, to a high voltage power source 7b.
      <br/>
      In order to avoid this, in this embodiment, an electrode 8b is disposed between the distal end 50 of the metal tube 5 and the needle electrode 24 at a position of interrupting the liquid droplets such that they do not reach a chemical ionization region, and the sample solution is electrosprayed to the electrode 8b.
      <br/>
      In this case, it is desirable that the electrode 8b is heated by a heater 27a for improving the vaporization efficiency of the liquid droplets as shown in FIG. 4.
      <br/>
      With the constitution shown in FIG. 4, only the gaseous molecules going around the electrode 8b are transported to and ionized in the chemical ionization region.
      <br/>
      Since the liquid droplets are captured by the electrode 8b, short-circuit between the needle electrode 24 and the electrode 8a can be avoided.
      <br/>
      In FIG. 4, the shape of the electrode 8b is not restricted only to a plate but any shape, for example, a mesh-form may be adopted, providing that the liquid droplets can be captured.
      <br/>
      For improving the efficiency of the sample molecules to reach the chemical ionization region 21, a gas 26 may be caused to flow to the chemical ionization region 21 like that in FIG. 3.

      <br/>
      Further, in a case of omitted the provision of the vaporization region 20, the needle electrode 24 shown in FIG. 2 to FIG. 4 may be omitted to further simplify the constitution of the apparatus.

      In the embodiment shown in FIG. 5, a high voltage is applied to a metal tube 5 for electrospraying a sample solution to cause corona discharge in a mass spectrometer using chemical ionization method for the ionization of sample molecules by using a capillary electrophoresis apparatus as a sample separation means.
      <br/>
      The sample solution reaching the distal end 2b of the capillary 1 is mixed with a sheath liquid 6 and then electrosprayed by a high voltage applied between a metal tube 5 and an electrode 8a from a power source 9 for nebulizer.

      When the voltage applied from the power source 9 to the metal tube 5 is set to about 6.about.10 kV, corona discharge is generated between the metal tube 5 and the electrode 8a.

      The sample solution is kept to be nebulized even under the condition where the corona discharge is generated.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, the gaseous molecules of the sample obtained by nebulization take place chemical reaction with ions generated due to gaseous molecules present in an atmospheric air by corona discharge, to obtain quasi molecular ions relevant to the sample molecules.

      The structure shown in FIG. 5 is identical with that of the existent apparatus shown in FIG. 13. In the structure of the present invention (shown in FIG. 5) is different from that of the existent apparatus (shown in FIG. 13) in that voltage applied between the metal tube 5 and the electrode 8a from the power source 9 is made higher as about 6 to 10 KV to cause corona discharge between the metal tube 5 and the electrode 8a.

      An electrophoresis voltage at 10 kV was applied from a power source 7a between both ends of the capillary 1.

      A solution comprising an aqueous solution of 30 mM ammonium acetate and acetonitrile at 1:1 mixing ratio and at pH of 7.2 was used as an electrophoresis buffer.
      <br/>
      A mixed solution comprising water and methanol at 1:1 ratio was introduced at a flow rate of 2  MU l/min to a portion between the capillary 1 and the stainless steel tube 5 as a sheath liquid 6 for assisting the nebulization.

      FIGS. 6 and 7 show mass spectrum for the background obtained only when the buffer is nebulized.
      <br/>
      In both of the figures, a value (m/z) obtained by dividing the molecular weight m of the ions by the number of charges z is indicated on the abscissa, while an ion intensity is indicated on the ordinate based on the peak for the maximum intensity assumed as 100.
      <br/>
      FIG. 6 is a mass spectrum measured by an existent apparatus shown in FIG. 13 and FIG. 7 is a mass spectrum measured by the apparatus according to the present invention shown in FIG. 2.
      <br/>
      In the existent mass spectrometer as shown in FIG. 13, an ammonium ion derived from ammonium acetate added to the buffer is intensely detected as shown in FIG. 6.
      <br/>
      This is attributable to that the ammonium ions formed by dissociation of ammonium acetate in the solution are taken out in a gas phase by electrospray and detected.
      <br/>
      Since molecules of an organic solvent have lower polarity compared with ammonia molecules, they can not be detected at a high sensitivity by the existent electrospray method shown in FIG. 13 which is effective to the highly polar substance or ionic substance.
      <br/>
      On the other hand, in the mass spectrometer according to the present invention shown in FIG. 2, ammonium ions are not detected at all, but ions formed by addition of protons to molecules of an organic solvent such as acetonitrile or methanol are intensely detected as shown in FIG. 7.
      <br/>
      Such protonated ions are detected when the molecules of the organic solvent evaporated into a gaseous state are ionized in the chemical ionization region.

      A sample solution of timepidium which is an ionizing substance (concentration: 5 * 10-4 mol/l) and a sample solution of caffeine which is a neutral substance not having charges in the solution (concentration: 5 * 10-4 mol/l) were provided.
      <br/>
      One end 2a of the capillary 1 was inserted into a vessel containing the sample solutions and the sample solution was introduced gravitationally by about 3 nl into the capillary while keeping the end 2a at a position higher than the end 2b of the capillary 1 (hydrostatic injection method).
      <br/>
      Then, analysis was conducted while inserting and holding the end 2a of the capillary 1 in a vessel 4 containing a buffer 3.

      FIG. 8 shows the result of measurement by the existent apparatus shown in FIG. 13, while FIG. 9 shows the result of measurement by the apparatus according to the present invention shown in FIG. 2.
      <br/>
      As can be seen from FIG. 8, the ionic substance timepidium is intensely detected by the existent mass spectrometer shown in FIG. 13, whereas the detection intensity for the caffeine which is a neutral substance is weak.
      <br/>
      On the other hand, in the mass spectrometer according to the present invention shown in FIG. 2, as can be seen from FIG. 9, the caffeine which is a neutral substance is detected much more strongly than that in the case of the existent apparatus (FIG. 8), although the ionic substance timepidium is not detected at all.
      <br/>
      The ionizing substance timepidium is not detected by using the chemical ionization method in FIG. 9, perhaps because the ionizing substance is converted into gaseous ions merely by electrospray, and the gaseous ions can not reach the sample aperture 10a since the trace of the ions during advance to the sample aperture 10a is flexed by the corona discharging electric field formed by the needle electrode 24.
    </p>
    <p num="48">
      As can be seen from comparison between FIG. 6 and FIG. 7 and comparison between FIG. 8 and FIG. 9, the mass spectrometer according to the present invention can form and analyze ion species different from those in the existent mass spectrometer.
      <br/>
      Further, in the existent apparatus, when a salt is added to an electrophoresis buffer in a capillary electrophoresis apparatus combined with the mass spectrometer, a detection signal of the salt appears at a high intensity, and a signal intensity of molecule ions of the sample as an object of analysis is reduced, so that a salt at high concentration can not be added to the buffer.
      <br/>
      On the contrary, in the mass spectrum measured by the mass spectrometer according to the present invention, spectrum derived from the salt added to the buffer can be observed scarcely.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, in the mass spectrometer according to the present invention, a buffer solution containing various kinds of salts can be used in the capillary electrophoresis apparatus and the range for the selection of the buffer solution can be extended.
      <br/>
      As described above, the application range of the mass spectrometer combined with the sample separation apparatus can be extended outstandingly according to the present invention.

      Five components could be separated by capillary electrophoresis and each of the sample compounds could be detected substantially at an identical ion intensity.
      <br/>
      In the capillary electrophoresis, if each of the sample compounds carry identical electric charges in the solution, a sample of lower molecular weight undergoes less resistance from the solution and, therefore, tends to show faster phoresis.
      <br/>
      In FIG. 14, the sample of larger molecular weight is detected earlier (at shorter phoresis time), probably because each of the sample compounds is charged negatively and electrophoretically moved toward the anode (direction to the end 2a).
      <br/>
      In the capillary electrophoresis, a flow is caused toward the cathode by electroosomosis (electroosmotic flow), and the flow rate of the electroosmotic flow is usually greater than the electrophoretic rate under usual phoretic condition in most cases.
      <br/>
      It is, accordingly, considered that since the direction of the electroosmotic flow is opposite to the direction of the electrophoresis of the sample and the sample compounds are sent to the cathode (direction of the end 2b), as a balance so that a molecule of sample compounds having a greater molecular weight of lower electrophoretic rate is detected earlier.

    <p num="62">EXAMPLE 11</p>
    <p num="63">Results of the examination for the effect of salts in the buffer solution for caffeine as an object of analysis using the apparatus of the constitution according to the present invention shown in FIG. 2 and the existent apparatus of the constitution shown in FIG. 13 are explained.</p>
    <p num="64">
      In this embodiment, the constitutions of the apparatus shown in FIG. 2 and FIG. 13 were used respectively in the same manner as in Example 5.
      <br/>
      A sample was introduced by about 2 nl to the capillary 1 by using a hydrostatic injection method.
      <br/>
      A sodium phosphate buffer solution (20.about.40 mM, pH 6.6) was used as the electrophoretic mobile phase.
      <br/>
      In the apparatus shown in FIG. 2 used in this embodiment, methanol was caused to flow (5  MU l/min) between the capillary 1 and the metal tube 5 for assisting nebulization, and a sample solution was electrosprayed by applying a voltage at 2.8 kV between the metal tube 5 and the metal block 22.
      <br/>
      A stainless steel block having a through hole of 5 mm diameter and 60 mm length was used as the metal block 22, and a voltage at 3 kV was applied to the needle electrode 24.
      <br/>
      In the constitution of the existent apparatus shown in FIG. 13 used in this example, a voltage at 3 kV was applied between the metal tube 5 and the electrode 8a, while 50% methanol solution containing 1% formic acid (2  MU l/min) was caused to flow between the capillary 1 and the metal tube 5 for assisting nebulization.
      <br/>
      Other measuring conditions are identical as those in Example 5.
    </p>
    <p num="65">
      Caffeine was used as a sample and the change of the ion intensity of caffeine was measured while varying the concentration of the salt in the buffer solution.
      <br/>
      Electrophoresis was conducted by applying a voltage at 10 kV between both ends of the capillary 1.
      <br/>
      FIG. 16 shows a relationship between a concentration of sodium phosphate in the buffer solution and the ion intensity of protonated caffeine molecule.
      <br/>
      The ion intensity was evaluated by the area of the resultant peak, assuming the ion intensity in a case of using a solvent not containing a salt as 100.
      <br/>
      At the ion intensity 80 measured by the constitution of the apparatus shown in FIG. 2 according to the present invention, there was no strong effect of the sodium phosphate in the buffer solution.
      <br/>
      On the other hand, at the ion intensity 81 measured by the constitution of the existent apparatus shown in FIG. 13, ions of protonated caffeine molecules could not be monitored in a case of using a 20 mM phosphate buffer solution.
      <br/>
      In the constitution of the apparatus according to the present invention, since the ionization progress suffers from no strong effect due to the presence of the salt, a buffer solution containing a less volatile salt at a high concentration can be used as a separation solvent.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, it can be seen that a wider arrange of analysis is possible by the mass spectrometer according to the present invention compared with the existent apparatus using only the electrospraying method.

    <p num="66">
      FIG. 17A and FIG. 17B show electropherograms for caffeine when a 20 mM phosphate buffer solution is used.
      <br/>
      FIG. 17A shows an electropherogram measured by the constitution of the apparatus according to the present invention as shown in FIG. 2, while FIG. 17B shows an electropherogram measured by the constitution of the existent apparatus shown in FIG. 13. The sample concentration was defined as 10-3 M and the amount of the sample introduced was set to 2 pmol.
      <br/>
      Caffeine could not be detected by the constitution of the existent apparatus shown in FIG. 13, whereas a distinct peak of caffeine was obtained in the constitution of the apparatus according to the present invention shown in FIG. 2.
    </p>
    <p num="67">Then, results of measurement for caffeine, as well as theophylline and theobromine as metabolic products thereof using the capillary electrophoresis method or the micellar electrokinetic chromatographic method as the sample separation means will now be explained.</p>
    <p num="68">
      The micellar electrokinetic chromatography is a method of forming micelles of a surfactant in a buffer solution and separating the sample molecules by utilizing the difference of distribution thereof to the micelles.
      <br/>
      Since this method can separate also molecules not having charges, it is known as a separation mode of high general applicability and is expected as a method of measuring environment polluting compounds such as analysis for environmental water containing a lot of contaminant ions.
      <br/>
      For forming the micelles, it is necessary to add a surfactant in an amount exceeding critical micelle concentration (CMC).
      <br/>
      Since sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) as one of surfactants used most frequently in micellar electrokinetic chromatography has about 8 mM of CMC in purified water, it is added under usual analysis conditions at a concentration of several tens mM in the buffer solution.
    </p>
    <p num="69">
      Caffeine, theophylline and theobromine were dissolved each at 1 mg/ml concentration to prepare a sample solution.
      <br/>
      Capillary electrophoresis or micellar electrokinetic chromatography was used for the sample separation and measurement was conducted by using the constitution of the apparatus shown in FIG. 2 which is identical with that used upon measurement in FIG. 16. Electrophoresis was conducted by applying a voltage at 5 kV between both ends of the capillary.
    </p>
    <p num="70">
      Theophylline and theobromine are isomers and have identical molecular weight.
      <br/>
      FIG. 18A shows results of analyzing caffeine, theophylline and theobromine by using a 25 mM phosphate buffer solution and using a capillary electrophoresis method.
      <br/>
      FIG. 18B shows results of analyzing caffeine, theophylline and theobromine by adding 50 mM of SDS to a 25 mM phosphate buffer solution and using micellar electrokinetic chromatography.
      <br/>
      As apparent also from FIG. 18A, the three compounds were not separated substantially and observed substantially at an identical migration time by a capillary electrophoretic method using a 25 mM phosphate buffer solution.
      <br/>
      This is because the three compounds used as the sample have molecular structures closely similar to each other and have no electric charges in the buffer solution used.
      <br/>
      On the other hand, as shown in FIG. 18B, in a case of using micellar electrokinetic chromatography, ions derived from caffeine (m/z.about.195), theophylline (m/z.about.181) and theobromine (m/z.about.181) were distinctly separated and observed at migration times different from each other.
      <br/>
      This is because the capacity factor of each of the sample molecules to the SDS micelles is different.
      <br/>
      That is, since the three compounds used as the sample have no electric charges, they migrate toward the cathode by the electroosmotic flow.
      <br/>
      The SDS micelles migrate toward the anode since they have negative electric charges.
      <br/>
      Under the analysis conditions used herein, since the flow rate of the electroosmotic flow is greater than the migration rate of the micelles, the solvent and the solute (sample molecule, SDS micelle) in the capillary are migrated as a whole toward the cathode.
      <br/>
      In this case, the sample molecules interact with the micelles, and a sample having a greater capacity factor to the micelle reaches the distal end of the capillary at a later time.
    </p>
    <p num="71">
      As apparent from the foregoing description, according to the present invention, molecules of neutral sample not having electric charges in a solution can be ionized and mass analyzed.
      <br/>
      Further, an electrophoretic buffer, which was difficult to be used in the existent mass spectrometer combined with the capillary electrophoretic apparatus, can be used in accordance with the present invention.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the range of application of the mass spectrometer combined with the sample separation means such as the capillary electrophoretic apparatus is widened and more substances can be analyzed.
    </p>
    <p num="72">It is further understood by those skilled in the art that the foregoing description is a preferred embodiment of the disclosed device and that various changes and modifications may be made in the invention without departing from the spirit and scope thereof.</p>
