      The invention refers to an economical carton box for packing and transporting of products that can consist of many pieces of corrugated board or solid paper so as in each case and for each side separately the arrangment of the paper's waves is to be indicated.
      <br/>
      For such an economical carton box the extensions (F1, F2, . . . , F6) of sides (A1, A2, A3) turn internally by 90 degrees so as to be glued with the outside part of the small sides (A4, A5) accordingly and the extensions (F7, F8) to base A2.
      <br/>
      The extensions (N1, N2) rotate and glue externally to sides (A4 and A5) while columns (K1, K2, K3, K4) are formed at the small sides.
      <br/>
      When the height of the sides (A1, A3) is equal to the height of the carton box then the extensions (N1, N2) constitute the covering of the carton box.
      <br/>
      The projections (P1, P2, P3, P4) of sides (A4 and A5) fit into slots (E1, E2, E3, E4) accordingly during the piling of the boxes.

    <p num="1">This application is a national stage of PCT/GR97/00024 filed Jun. 30, 1997 and based upon Greek national application 96 01 00223 filed Jul. 1, 1996 under the International Convention.</p>
    <heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">The invention relates to an economical carton or box which is very strong and useful for the packing and transportation of agricultural and industrial products.</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="3">
      Many boxes are known for use in packing and transportation of agricultural and industrial products which are formed by a single paper blank.
      <br/>
      The blank of this paper, which is usually large, is a problem since during the production of the corrugated board it is not always possible to economically limit the waste.
    </p>
    <p num="4">Also the corrugations of the corrugated board out of which a carton or box is constructed always run in one direction so that certain sides of the box lack strength not because the quality or the paper weight are not satisfactory but due to the inappropriate orientation of the corrugations of the corrugated board.</p>
    <heading>OBJECT OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="5">
      It is the object of the invention to provide an improved cardboard box.
      <br/>
      The advantage of this invention is that a carton, box or tray can be constructed from different pieces of corrugated board or solid paper that are held together with glue.
    </p>
    <p num="6">In this way the combinations in the corrugated board or solid paper productive lines become much easier since the blanks are smaller and moreover at each side of the carton box, papers with the appropriate paper or, extension can be used and to yield a very economical and strong carton box.</p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="7">
      The cardboard box of the invention, which is useful for packing and transportation of agricultural and industrial products, is made up of a number of blanks or pieces including a base, longitudinal walls connected to the base along the longitudinal base thereof and either in one piece with the base or as separate pieces, and end walls connected to the base at end edges thereof.
      <br/>
      The end walls and the base are glued together for extensions on the end walls have sides which can be followed inwardly to form columns of the box, at the corners betweens these side walls and the longitudinal walls.
      <br/>
      The longitudinal walls have extensions which extend around and are glued to the outer surfaces of the end walls at these columns.
      <br/>
      Projections on the end walls and slots formed in the base enable stacks of boxes to be aligned with the projections of one of the boxes engaging in the slots of another box.

    <heading>SPECIFIC DESCRIPTION</heading>
    <p num="9">The reference regards the one fourth or one half of the cardboard box for each case because of its symmetry against both the horizontal and vertical axis that go through its center.</p>
    <p num="10">Each paper member may have different thickness but all of the embodiments show the thicknesses will be considered to be the same and equal to p.</p>
    <p num="11">FIG. 1 shows pieces of corrugated board or solid paper that are being cut and folded according to it so as the sides A1, A2, A3 of the carton box can be formed as well as their extensions F1, F2, . . . , F8 to fi length, the N1, N2 of ni length, the D1, D2, D3, D4 of di width, the K1, K2, K3, K4, which are formed by a relevant refolding of the 1, 2, 3 surfaces a, b, c length and equivalently the projections P1, P2, P3, P4.</p>
    <p num="12">Also at all paper surfaces relevant cuts are made in order finally to provide the slots E1, E2, E3, E4 of a box of FIG. 3 shows and whose dimensions are equivalent to those of the projections P1, P2, P3, P4 so as during the stacking of the boxes their appropriate fixing can be accomplished.</p>
    <p num="13">According to the present invention at A4 and A5 sides the surfaces 3 of c length rotate through 45 (degree)  externally (in cases the triangular column is isosceles), also the surfaces 2 of b length rotate through 135 (degree)  internally and finally the surfaces 1 at length a rotate internally by 90 (degree)  so that the inner side of surfaces 3 touch the sides A4 and A5 and thus the triangular columns K1, K2, K4, K4 are formed.</p>
    <p num="14">
      Also surfaces F7 and F8 of A1 and A3 sides equivalently glue together with A2 side so that a single rectangular parallelogram is formed with A2 side usually above the surface F7 and F8.
      <br/>
      The dimensions of this single surface are �W1+2(H1+ni)� * (l1+2fi).
    </p>
    <p num="15">The A1 and A3 sides rotate internally by 90 (degree)  and afterwards the A4 and A5 sides are brought vertically towards the A1, A2, A3 surfaces with the projections P1, P2, P3, P4 placed upwards and in such position that the surfaces F1, F2, F3 and F4, F5, F6 when rotated internally by 90 (degree)  touch the A5 and A4 sides so that the gluing together of all the box's sides can be finally accomplished by the insertion of the glue.</p>
    <p num="16">Afterwards the N1, N2 sides rotated internally by 180 (degree)  are glued together with A1 and A3 sides equivalently while the D1, D2, D3, D4 tabs are glued on the small sides of the carton box and particularly on their surfaces 2.</p>
    <p num="17">The carton box that is formed by this way has external dimensions with length L=L1+2p, width W=W1+2p=W2+4p and height H (without estimating the height of projections P1, P2, P3, P4).</p>
    <p num="18">With accordance to the ventilation demands of the packed products an air gap is formed which is defined by the difference of height H of the carton and sides A1 and A3 with height H1, that means (H-H1).</p>
    <p num="19">
      Regarding the fi and ni lengths of the extensions Fi/i=1,2, . . . , 8 and Ni/i=1,2, fi&gt;0 and 0 &lt;= ni &lt;= H1-p valid.

    <p num="33">In this case a=2b and 2b &lt;= W2 valid.</p>
    <p num="34">In case that surfaces A4, A5 are the same to each other but not symmetrical to the axis which passes vertically through their center and valid one out of a to be equal to 2p and the other equal to 3p then the sides A4 and A5 are formed by three successive sheets of paper and then valid (W2/2)&lt;b &lt;= W2.</p>
    <p num="35">
      On base A2 are formed grooves O1 and O2 so that projections P1 and P2 fit to them during the box stack.
      <br/>
      When the height of projections P1 and P2 is bigger than p then we have to cut equivalent slots E1 and E2 to the sides A5 and A4.
