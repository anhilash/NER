      <br/>
      A shielded cable connector assembly in which a shielded cable includes an insulating layer formed on an outer peripheral surface of a conductor, and a sheath layer formed on an outer surface of the insulating layer through a braid, and a terminal is pressed to grip the conductor and the insulating layer of the shielded cable, thereby providing the terminal with the shielded cable.
      <br/>
      The terminal with the shielded cable is inserted into a terminal receiving chamber in a housing body.
      <br/>
      One side wall of the housing body is notched to form an operation opening at the terminal receiving chamber.
      <br/>
      A braid contact member projects into the terminal receiving chamber from the operation opening.
      <br/>
      The braid contact member has a size smaller than an outer diameter of the shielded cable.
      <br/>
      When the terminal with the shielded cable is inserted into the terminal receiving chamber, the braid contact member is automatically inserted between the sheath layer and the insulating layer.
      <br/>
      The braid contact member includes an L-shaped contact body, and a contact portion formed on and extending from a free end of the contact body in a direction opposite to a terminal inserting direction, the contact portion being formed into a sharp edge.

    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="1">
      1.
      <br/>
      Field of the Invention
    </p>
    <p num="2">This invention relates to a construction of processing an end portion of a shielded cable.</p>
    <p num="3">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
    <p num="4">
      As shown in FIG. 14, a shielded cable 60 comprises a conductor 61, an insulating layer 62 formed on an outer peripheral surface of the conductor 61, and a sheath layer 64 formed on an outer surface of the insulating layer 62 through a braid 63.
      <br/>
      There has heretofore been proposed a connecting member 65 (see FIG. 15) to which the conductor 61 and the insulating layer 62 of the shielded cable 60 are adapted to be connected (Japanese Utility Model Unexamined Publication No. Hei. 5-15359).
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      The connecting member 65 includes an inner tubular connecting portion 66, and an outer tubular connecting portion 67 provided in surrounding relation to the inner connecting portion 66, the two connecting portions 66 and 67 being integrally connected together.
      <br/>
      The connecting member 65 is press-fitted on an end portion of a shielded cable 60', at which the insulating layer 62 is exposed, as shown in FIG. 16(a), and the braid 63 and the sheath layer 62 are held between the inner and outer connecting portions 66 and 67 as shown in FIG. 16(b), so that the shielded cable 60' and the connecting member 65 are connected together.
      <br/>
      Thereafter, the connecting member 65 is inserted into a connector housing (not shown), so that the braid 63 is connected to a contact (not shown) within the connector housing.
    </p>
    <p num="6">FIGS. 17(a) and 17(b) show another conventional construction using a sheath layer holder member 68 and a shield tube 69 (Japanese Patent Unexamined Publication No. Hei. 6-349532).</p>
    <p num="7">
      As shown in FIG. 17(a), the sheath layer holder member 68, made of an elastic, insulating material, is press-fitted on an end portion of a shielded cable 60" at which a braid 63 is exposed.
      <br/>
      A smaller-diameter portion 68a of the sheath layer holder member 68 is held in intimate contact with an insulating layer 62, with the braid 63 turned over.
      <br/>
      At this time, part or the whole of the braid 63 is received in a larger-diameter portion 68b of the sheath layer holder member 68.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      In this condition, as shown in FIG. 17(b), the shield tube 69, made of metal, is applied to cover the sheath layer holder member 68, and also the shield tube 69 is held in contact with the braid 63.
      <br/>
      Then, the shielded cable 60" is inserted into a connector housing (not shown), and the shield tube is connected to a contact (not shown) provided in the connector housing.
      <br/>
      Reference numeral 68c designates a through-hole in the sheath layer holder member 68.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      However, the efficiency of insertion of the shielded cable 60' into the connecting member 65, as well as the efficiency of insertion of the shielded cable 60" into the sheath layer holder member 68 and the shield tube 69, is very poor.
      <br/>
      Besides, there is a fear that the size of the outer connecting portion 67 increases with the increase of the sheath layer 64 of the shielded cable 60'. There has been encountered a further drawback that since the sheath layer holder member 68 and the shield tube 69 must be mounted on the shielded cable 60", the twofold time and labor have been required.
    </p>

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
    <p num="13">Preferred embodiments of the present invention will now be described with reference to the drawings.</p>
    <p num="14">FIGS. 1 to 6 show a first embodiment of a shielded cable end-processing construction of the present invention.</p>
    <p num="15">
      In FIGS. 1 and 2, in this shielded cable end-processing construction, a terminal 10, pressed to grip a conductor 2 and an insulating layer 3 of a shielded cable 1, is inserted into a terminal receiving chamber 22 in a connector housing 20, and at this time, a braid contact member 30, provided in the terminal receiving chamber 22, is automatically connected to a braid 4 of the shielded cable 1.
      <br/>
      The construction of the shielded cable 1 is the same as that of the conventional shielded cable, and therefore explanation thereof will be omitted.
    </p>
    <p num="16">
      The terminal 10 includes a terminal contact portion 12 of a box-like shape formed at one end thereof, and a shielded cable contact portion 13 formed at the other end thereof.
      <br/>
      An engagement hole 14a is formed through a bottom wall 14 of the terminal contact portion 12.
      <br/>
      The shielded cable contact portion 13 has a pair of conductor clamping piece portions 15 and 15 for gripping the conductor 2 of the shielded cable 1 and a pair of covering clamping piece portions 16 and 16 for gripping the insulating layer 3.
    </p>
    <p num="17">
      The connector housing 20 has the terminal receiving chamber 22 formed through a housing body 21, and an operation opening 23 is formed in that portion of an upper wall 21a of the housing body 21 disposed adjacent to an inlet 22a of the terminal receiving chamber 22.
      <br/>
      The braid contact member 30 extends into the terminal receiving chamber 22 through the operation opening 23.
      <br/>
      An elastic retaining piece portion 24 is formed on an inner surface of the terminal receiving chamber 22.
      <br/>
      A retaining projection 24a for engagement in the engagement hole 14a in the terminal 10 is formed at a free end of the elastic retaining piece portion 24.
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      One end 31a of a conductor plate 31 is fixedly secured to the upper wall 21a of the housing body 21, and the braid contact member 30 is formed integrally with and extends from the other end 31b of the conductor plate 31, and the other end 31b is supported by a holder block 32.
      <br/>
      The holder block 32 is fixedly secured to the upper wall 21a of the housing body 21.
      <br/>
      A lock hole 31c and a resilient mountain-like portion 31d are provided in the middle of the conductor plate 31.
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      As shown in FIGS. 1 and 3, the braid contact member 30 includes an L-shaped contact body 35, and a contact portion 36 formed on and extending from a distal end of a horizontal portion 35a of the contact body 35.
      <br/>
      A vertical portion 35b of the contact body 35 is connected to the other end 31b of the conductor plate 31.
      <br/>
      The contact portion 36 projects from the distal end of the horizontal portion 35a in a direction Q opposite to a terminal inserting direction P. The contact body 35 extends from a peripheral edge portion of the operation opening 23 into the terminal receiving chamber 22, and the contact portion 36 is disposed in the terminal receiving chamber 22.
    </p>
    <p num="20">
      As shown in FIG. 2, the distance D between an inner surface 22b of the terminal receiving chamber 22 and a lower surface 36a of the contact portion 36 is substantially equal to the thickness d of a sheath layer 5 of the shielded cable 1 (D=d), and is slightly smaller than the distance D' between the inner surface 22b of the terminal receiving chamber 22 and the bottom wall 14 of the terminal 10 (D.apprxeq.D').
      <br/>
      With this construction, when the terminal 1' with the shielded cable is to be inserted into the terminal receiving chamber 22, the contact portion 36 and the terminal 10 will not interfere with each other, and besides the time and labor, required for bringing the contact portion 36 into agreement with the boundary between the braid 4 and the sheath layer 5, is omitted.
      <br/>
      The contact portion 36 is formed into a sharp edge, and therefore when the terminal 1' with the shielded cable is inserted into the terminal receiving chamber 22, the contact portion 36 can be easily inserted between the braid 4 and the sheath layer 5.
    </p>
    <p num="21">A method of processing the end portion of the shielded cable 1 will now be described.</p>
    <p num="22">
      As shown in FIG. 4, a desired length of the conductor 2 and a desired length of the insulating layer 3 are exposed respectively at the end portion of the shielded cable 1.
      <br/>
      The conductor clamping piece portions 15 of the terminal 10 are pressed to grip the conductor 2, and the covering clamping piece portions 16 are pressed to grip the insulating layer 3, thereby forming the terminal 1' with the shielded cable.
      <br/>
      The terminal 1' with the shielded cable is inserted into the terminal receiving chamber 22 of the housing body 21 through the inlet 22a thereof, with the bottom wall 14 of the terminal 10 directed upwardly.
    </p>
    <p num="23">
      During this inserting operation, the contact portion 36 of the braid contact member 30 will not contact the bottom wall 14, and abuts against that portion of an end surface 6 defining the boundary between the braid 4 and the sheath layer 5 as shown in FIG. 5.
      <br/>
      When the terminal 1' with the shielded cable is further pushed into the terminal receiving chamber 22, the contact portion 36 of the braid contact member 30 pierces into the area of contact between an outer surface 4a of the braid 4 and an inner surface 5a of the sheath layer 5 as shown in FIG. 6, and gradually advances.
    </p>
    <p num="24">
      The distal end of the contact portion 36 is formed into a sharp edge, and therefore the contact portion 36 can easily pierce into the end surface 6 between the braid 4 and the sheath layer 5.
      <br/>
      The contact portion 36 is inserted between the braid 4 and the sheath layer 5 until the retaining projection 24a of the elastic retaining piece portion 24 becomes engaged in the engagement hole 14a in the terminal 10.
      <br/>
      Therefore, merely by inserting the terminal 1' with the shielded cable into the terminal receiving chamber 22, the contact portion 36 can be easily brought into contact with the braid 4 of the shielded cable 1 (see FIG. 2).
    </p>
    <p num="25">
      FIGS. 7 and 8 show a second embodiment of the shielded cable end-processing construction of the present invention.
      <br/>
      The constituent parts identical to those of the first embodiment will be designated by identical names and reference numerals, respectively, and detailed description thereof will be omitted.
    </p>
    <p num="26">In this shielded cable end-processing construction shown in FIGS. 7 and 8, a resilient contact piece 38 is formed on the contact portion 36 of the braid contact member 30 of the first embodiment.</p>
    <p num="27">
      The resilient contact piece 38 extends from the vicinity of the distal end of the contact portion 36 in a terminal inserting direction P. The thickness of the resilient contact piece 38 is substantially the same as that of the contact portion 36.
      <br/>
      A retaining mountain-like portion 38a is formed at a free end portion of the resilient contact piece 38.
      <br/>
      When the terminal 1' with the shielded cable is inserted into the terminal receiving chamber 22, the retaining mountain-like portion 38a slidingly moves relative to the inner surface 5a of the sheath layer 5, and then is caught by the inner surface 5a.
    </p>
    <p num="28">
      At the same time, the retaining mountain-like portion 38a is spring-biased against the inner surface 5a of the sheath layer 5.
      <br/>
      As a result, the retention force of the contact portion 36 in the shielded cable 1 is increased.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the rearward withdrawal of the contact portion 36 from the shielded cable 1 is prevented, and also the connection between the braid 4 and the contact portion 36 can be effected more positively.
    </p>
    <p num="29">
      FIGS. 9 and 10 show a third embodiment of the shielded cable end-processing construction of the present invention.
      <br/>
      The constituent parts identical to those of the first embodiment will be designated by identical names and reference numerals, respectively, and detailed description thereof will be omitted.
    </p>
    <p num="30">In this shielded cable end-processing construction shown in FIGS. 9 and 10, a vertical contact piece 39 is formed on the contact body 35 of the braid contact member 30 of the first embodiment.</p>
    <p num="31">
      The vertical contact piece 39 is formed at the horizontal portion 35a of the contact body 35 by stamping, and is disposed substantially centrally of the width of this horizontal portion 35a.
      <br/>
      The vertical contact piece 39 is disposed perpendicularly to the contact portion 36.
      <br/>
      That side of the vertical contact piece 39, disposed close to the contact portion 36, is formed into a slanting surface 39a so as to reduce the resistance offered when inserting the terminal.
      <br/>
      The length H of projecting of the vertical contact piece 39 is set smaller than the thickness d (see FIG. 2) of the sheath layer 5 (H&lt;d).
    </p>
    <p num="32">
      FIG. 11 shows a modification of the vertical contact piece 39 in which horizontal contact pieces 40 are formed respectively at opposite side edges of the contact portion 36 in parallel relation to the contact body 35.
      <br/>
      Like the vertical contact piece 39, each of the two horizontal contact pieces 40 and 40 have a slanting surface 40a.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the contact portion 36 has a substantially arrowhead-shape as a whole.
      <br/>
      The length H' of projecting of each horizontal contact piece 40 from the contact portion 36 is so determined that the horizontal contact pieces 40 will not pierce the sheath layer 5 during and after the insertion of the terminal.
      <br/>
      The thickness of the vertical contact piece 39 and the thickness of the horizontal contact pieces 40 are substantially the same as that of the contact body 35 or the contact portion 36 (see FIGS. 9 and 11).
    </p>
    <p num="33">
      As shown in FIGS. 9 to 11, the vertical contact piece 39 (the horizontal contact pieces 40) is formed on the contact body 35 or the contact portion 36 of the braid contact member 30, and with this construction when the terminal 10 is inserted into the terminal receiving chamber 22, the vertical contact piece 39 (the horizontal contact pieces 40) is caused to bite into the sheath layer 5.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the rearward withdrawal of the contact portion 36 from the shielded cable 1 is prevented.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the braid contact member 30 and the braid 4 can be contacted with each other more positively.
    </p>
    <p num="34">
      FIGS. 12 and 13 show a fourth embodiment of the shielded cable end-processing construction of the present invention.
      <br/>
      The constituent parts identical to those of the first embodiment will be designated by identical names and reference numerals, respectively, and detailed description thereof will be omitted.
    </p>
    <p num="35">In this shielded cable end-processing construction shown in FIG. 12, a guide bar 26 for protecting the shielded cable 1 is provided at the operation opening 23 of the first embodiment, and a protection lid 28 is pivotally mounted on a right side wall 21b of a housing body 21 through hinges 27.</p>
    <p num="36">
      The guide bar 26 extends between the right and left side walls 21b and 21c of the housing body 21, and is disposed immediately adjacent to an inlet 22a of a terminal receiving chamber 22.
      <br/>
      One end 28a of the rectangular protection lid 28 is connected to the right side wall 21b of the housing body 21 through the hinges 27.
      <br/>
      Retaining means (not shown) are provided respectively at the other end 28b of the protection lid 28 and the left side wall 21c of the housing body 21.
    </p>
    <p num="37">
      As shown in FIGS. 12 and 13, when the terminal 1' with the shielded cable is inserted into the terminal receiving chamber 22, the retaining projection 24a of the elastic retaining piece portion 24 is engaged in the engagement hole 14a in the terminal 10, and also the guide bar 26 is held in intimate contact with the sheath layer 5 of the shielded cable 1, and therefore the terminal 1' with the shielded cable within the terminal receiving chamber 22 is held stably.
      <br/>
      Then, the protection lid 28 is moved to close the operation opening 23, so that the sheath layer 5 of the shielded cable 1 is pressed inwardly.
    </p>
    <p num="38">
      As a result, the terminal 1' with the shielded cable within the terminal receiving chamber 22 is held more stably.
      <br/>
      Since the terminal 1' with the shielded cable is more stably held within the terminal receiving chamber 22, the connection between the braid contact member 30 and the braid 4 is stable.
      <br/>
      Therefore, even if the shielded cable 1, connected to the terminal, is bent downwardly, the condition of contact between the braid contact member 30 and the braid 4 will not become unstable.
      <br/>
      The operation opening 23 is closed by the protective lid 28, and therefore the braid contact member 30 and the braid 4 are kept stably contacted with each other.
    </p>
    <p num="39">The braid contact members 30 of the first to fourth embodiments may have any suitable configuration in so far as the braid contact member 30 can be connected to the braid 4 simultaneously when the terminal 1' with the shielded cable is inserted into the terminal receiving chamber 22.</p>
    <p num="40">
      As described above, in the invention, the operation opening is formed in one side wall of the housing body, and the braid contact member, having a size smaller than the outer diameter of the shielded cable, projects into the terminal receiving chamber from the operation opening.
      <br/>
      Therefore, when the terminal with the shielded cable is inserted into the terminal receiving chamber, the braid contact member is inserted between the sheath layer and the insulating layer.
      <br/>
      Therefore, merely by inserting the terminal with the shielded cable into the terminal receiving chamber, the braid of the shielded cable can be easily connected to the braid contact member.
