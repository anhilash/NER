      The invention concerns a polyacrylamide-containing composition which is characterized in that it has a molecular weight of between 2,000 and 8,000 g/mol, determined by means of gel permeation chromatography (GPC), and as a 15% aqueous solution still has a Brookfield viscosity of between 100 and 500 mPas at 25° C.
      <br/>
      The invention further concerns the use of this polyacrylamide-containing composition for the flat bonding of water absorbent and hard surfaces and for equipping plastic surfaces with non-slip protection.

    <p num="1">This invention relates to a polyacrylamide-containing adhesive composition having a lower molecular weight than corresponding commercially available adhesive compositions, to a process for the production of such an adhesive composition and to its use in surface bonding processes.</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">DE-OS 43 39 642 describes antislip formulations, i.e. formulations which prevent two articles from unintentionally sliding in relation to one another, which consist of at least one colophony resin and/or a derivative thereof, at least one monohydric or polyhydric alcohol, a water-soluble or water-dispersible thinning agent optionally a propellent and optionally a thickener and--for the rest--water.</p>
    <p num="3">
      It is known from "Encyclopedia of Polymer Science and Engineering", 2nd Edition, Vol. 17, John Wiley &amp; Sons, New York, 1989, pages 730-784, more particularly pages 753 et seq., that polyacrylamide is used in adhesive compositions, more particularly in the paper industry by virtue of its dry strength and in the building industry as a laminate adhesive.
      <br/>
      Unfortunately, the disadvantage of applying such adhesive polymers in the form of an aqueous solution is the high viscosity of such compositions.
      <br/>
      This is attributable to the high molecular weight typical of the polymer which in turn is responsible for the mechanical strength subsequently required.
      <br/>
      Experience has shown that an excessive reduction in molecular weight leads to a considerable reduction in the strength of the bond.
    </p>
    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="4">The problem addressed by the present invention was to provide a new polyacrylamide-containing adhesive composition which would not have the above-mentioned disadvantages of a high viscosity, but which at the same time would show comparable mechanical strength.</p>
    <p num="5">This problem has been solved by the characterizing features of claim 1.</p>
    <p num="6">Accordingly, the present invention relates to a polyacrylamide-containing adhesive composition which is characterized in that it contains a polyacrylamide with a very low molecular weight of 2,000 to 8,000 g/mole and preferably 3,500 to 5,000 g/mole, as determined by gel permeation chromatography (GPC), and in that the polyacrylamide has a Brookfield viscosity of 5 to 500 mPas in the form of a 15% by weight aqueous solution at 25 (degree)  C.</p>
    <p num="7">
      In one preferred embodiment, the polyacrylamide-containing compositions contain viscosity-regulating additives, for example water and/or monohydric or polyhydric alcohols, which are preferably liquid and evaporate from the adhesive system at 25 (degree)  C. in accordance with practical requirements.
      <br/>
      One particular embodiment is characterized by the use of alcohols with a solubility of more than 3 g in 100 g of water at 25 (degree)  C. These alcohols may be aliphatic or cycloaliphatic, saturated or unsaturated alcohols with a linear or branched chain.
      <br/>
      They may also contain other hetero atoms, for example oxygen in the form of an ether group.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      Examples are ethanol, n-propanol, i-propanol, butanol, benzyl alcohol, cyclohexanol, di-, tri- and polyethylene glycol.
      <br/>
      Dihydric and trihydric alcohols are preferred, ethane-1,2-diol, propane-1,2-diol and/or propane-1,2,3-triol (glycerol) being particularly preferred.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      The above-mentioned additives may consist both of pure water and of alcohols.
      <br/>
      This additive is present in the polyacrylamide-containing composition according to the invention in a quantity of generally 50 to 95% by weight and preferably 75 to 90% by weight.
      <br/>
      In one preferred embodiment and providing the polyacrylamide-composition is applied to a water-absorbing surface, an additive mixture of water and 5 to 30% by weight and preferably 5 to 15% by weight of an alcohol, preferably glycerol, is used so that excessive waving of the paper coated with the polyacrylamide composition is avoided.
      <br/>
      The pot life can be adjusted to between 1 and 360 minutes depending on the quantity of glycerol used, i.e. 5 to 45% by weight and preferably 10 to 30% by weight, based on the polyacrylamide composition.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      In addition, a tackifier is also added to the polyacrylamide-containing compositions according to the invention, colophony resin with an average molecular weight below 2,000 g/mole being particularly mentioned in this regard.
      <br/>
      Colophony resin is obtained, for example, from the crude resin of conifers.
      <br/>
      It consists predominately of unsaturated carboxylic acids with the empirical formula C20 H30 O2, such as abietic acid and isomers thereof.
      <br/>
      However, more or less neutral substances, such as fatty acid esters, terpene alcohols and hydrocarbons, may also be present.
      <br/>
      A derivatized colophony resin is preferably used, for example a hydrogenated or disproportionated colophony resin, the object of the derivatization (for example saponification or addition of maleic acid) being above all to increase solubility in water.
      <br/>
      Useful colophony resins and derivatives thereof are balsam, tall oil and wood resins.
      <br/>
      Water-soluble balsam resin derivatives with a solubility of at least 3 g in 100 g of water at 25 (degree)  C., which are marketed under the name of "Flexin.RTM. D", are particularly suitable.
      <br/>
      Water-soluble colophony derivatives, more particularly saponified derivatives, are preferably used.
    </p>
    <p num="11">Suitable thinning agents--another sub-group of additives--are alkali metal or alkaline earth metal benzene sulfonates containing up to 18 and, more particularly, 1 to 4 carbon atoms in the alkyl group, but especially the sodium salt of propyl benzene sulfonate.</p>
    <p num="12">
      In addition, it is also possible--providing the polyacrylamide compositions according to the invention are to be used for spraying, but are not to be sprayed by means of a mechanical pump spray--to use a propellent selected, for example, from the usual hydrocarbon propellent gases known per se, such as propane, butane or mixtures thereof, which are optionally used together with ethanol or dimethyl ether.
      <br/>
      Carbon dioxide may also be used to spray the polyacrylamide compositions.
    </p>
    <p num="13">In addition, there are various other auxiliaries and additives, for example dyes and light stabilizers.</p>
    <p num="14">
      In the context of the present invention, the term "polyacrylamide" is mainly intended to apply to copolymers containing acrylamide and, in the extreme case, to polyacrylamide itself.
      <br/>
      These polyacrylamides have a copolymer content of up to 15% by weight and, more particularly, up to 5% by weight.
      <br/>
      Acrylamide-containing copolymers are understood to be cationic polyelectrolytes with which water-soluble polymers having a positive electrical charge are obtained.
      <br/>
      Examples include diallyl dimethyl ammonium chloride, diallyl diethyl ammonium chloride, diethyl aminoethyl methacrylate, dimethyl aminoethyl methacrylate, methyl acryloyloxyethyl trimethyl ammonium sulfate, methacryloyloxyethyl trimethyl ammonium chloride and 3-(methacrylamido)-propyl trimethyl ammonium chloride and the salts of acrylic acid or methacrylic acid, more particularly sodium acrylate.
      <br/>
      In addition, amphoteric water-soluble polymers, such as the known polybetaines, polyampholytes and interpolymer complexes, may also be added to the polyacrylamide-containing compositions according to the invention.
      <br/>
      Further information on polymers of this type can be found in "Encyclopedia of Polymer Science and Engineering", Vol. 17, 1989, keyword: water-soluble polymers, more particularly pages 770 to 778.
    </p>
    <p num="15">The concentration of the individual components in the polyacrylamide-containing composition according to the invention is generally 5 to 50% by weight and preferably 10 to 25% by weight of at least one polyacrylamide, 50 to 95% by weight and preferably 75 to 90% by weight of a viscosity-regulating additive, 0 to 20% by weight and preferably 0 to 10% by weight of at least one tackifier and 0 to 25% by weight and preferably 5 to 15% by weight of at least one water-soluble or water-dispersible thinning agents.</p>
    <p num="16">The present invention also relates to non-waving adhesive compositions, more particularly spray adhesives and paper adhesives, which contain the polyacrylamide composition mentioned above, i.e. 5 to 50% by weight and preferably 10 to 25% by weight of at least one polyacrylamide, 50 to 95% by weight and preferably 75 to 90% by weight of at least one viscosity-regulating additive, 0 to 30% by weight and preferably 0 to 15% by weight of at least one tackifier, 0 to 10% by weight and preferably 0 to 5% by weight of a water-soluble or water-dispersible thinning agent and 0 to 35% by weight and preferably 0 to 25% by weight of at least one propellent.</p>
    <p num="17">
      The polyacrylamide-containing compositions according to the invention are obtained by subjecting acrylamide to solution polymerization, optionally in the presence of comonomers, and removing the excess water by methods known per se.
      <br/>
      For the applications according to the invention, the copolymer predominantly containing acrylamide is then further processed together with the viscosity-regulating additive and other auxiliaries and additives to form ready-to-apply solutions, the content of polyacrylamide and its copolymers in the case of surface application, for example by brushing or pump-spraying, generally being from 5 to 50% by weight, based on the ready-to-use solution.
      <br/>
      Where the polyacrylamide composition is applied in this way, water is preferably used as the main additive providing no water-absorbing articles are present.
    </p>
    <p num="18">Where the composition is used in adhesives of relatively low water content, glycerol is used as a further additive in a quantity of up to 25% by weight, based on the solution as a whole.</p>
    <p num="19">The invention is illustrated by the following Examples.</p>
    <heading>EXAMPLES</heading>
    <p num="20">Example 1</p>
    <p num="21">Synthesis of a Low Molecular Weight Polyacrylamide</p>
    <p num="22">
      10.1 g of Natrosol 250 G (a hydroxyethyl cellulose marketed by Hercules Inc.) are dissolved while stirring in 270 g of demineralized water. 675 g of acrylamide and 3.4 g of azoisobutyrodinitrile are successively dissolved in 2,470 g of isopropanol and the resulting solution is added to the aqueous solution. 200 g of dry ice are added.
      <br/>
      After it has evaporated, the reaction mixture is heated to 60 (degree)  C. After the polymerization reaction has started, as clearly reflected in the clouding of the solution, the heat of reaction leads to an increase in temperature.
      <br/>
      The internal temperature is kept below 70 (degree)  C. by external cooling.
      <br/>
      After the exothermic reaction has abated, the reaction mixture is stirred for 1 hour at 75 (degree)  C.
    </p>
    <p num="23">The reaction mixture is then cooled to room temperature, the solvent mixture is decanted off from the powder formed and the residue is dried in a water jet vacuum at 60 (degree)  C.</p>
    <p num="24">670 g of a white free-flowing powder with a specific viscosity of 0.45 (1% solution in 1-normal aqueous sodium nitrate solution) are obtained in this way.</p>
    <p num="25">Application Example 1</p>
    <p num="26">
      A 15% aqueous solution of the polyacrylamide produced in accordance with Example 1 was sprayed in a thin layer onto a 50 mm * 80 mm * 4 mm plate of three-ply beech plywood by three strokes from a commercial pump spray can held at a distance of about 10 cm.
      <br/>
      Two wood plates were brought into contact with a 2 cm overlap on the narrow sides, fixed with four clothes pegs and, after 16 hours, were tensile-tested in a Zwick tensile tester (traction rate 15 mm/min.).
    </p>
    <p num="27">Where fixing is carried out immediately, an average tensile shear strength of 2.8 N/mm2 is obtained; where fixing is carried out after airing for 5 minutes, an average tensile shear strength of 5 N/mm2 is obtained.</p>
    <p num="28">Polymers containing 5% by weight of diethyl aminoethyl methacryl sulfate (DMAEMA) or 5% by weight of sodium acrylate show comparable strengths.</p>
    <p num="29">Application Example 2 (Comparison)</p>
    <p num="30">
      A relatively high molecular weight polyacrylamide (molecular weight 15,000 g/mole determined by GPC), which had a specific viscosity of 19.0 in the form of a 1% solution in 1-normal sodium nitrate solution, was investigated at the same time as the above-mentioned polyacrylamides according to the invention.
      <br/>
      With this known relatively high molecular weight polyacrylamide, a Brookfield viscosity of 3,000 mPas practicable for spray application is only obtained at a distinctly lower polymer content of 5% by weight.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, spray application was not possible in the case of the relatively high molecular weight type, even after fairly heavy dilution.
    </p>
    <p num="31">In order to demonstrate the range of application of the polyacrylamide compositions according to the invention, the other Application Examples according to the invention summarized in Table 1 below (formulations 2 to 6) were prepared and compared with market products, such as contact adhesives based on polychlorobutadiene in aqueous solvents with added resins (Pattex.RTM.) and conventional casein dispersions (Optal 702 and Optal 1740).</p>
    <p num="32">
      It can be seen from Table 1 below that the adhesive compositions according to the invention have a higher tensile shear strength than conventional casein dispersions and show adequate adhesive strength and tensile shear strength against Pattex.RTM. despite a lower solids content.
      <br/>
      The waving of paper was visually evaluated, the symbol "--" signifying very serious waving, the symbol "-" significant waving, the symbol "+-" average waving, the symbol "+" relatively little waving and the "++" very little waving.
