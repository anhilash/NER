      This invention relates to an improved silver halide photographic element for silver halide imaging systems.
      <br/>
      More specifically, it relates to such an element comprising at least five separately sensitized light-sensitive silver halide emulsion layers containing, in addition to the three conventional cyan, magenta, and yellow dye-forming layers, a fourth image dye-forming layer comprising a coupler wherein the dye formed by that coupler has a CIELAB hab hue angle in the range of from not less than 355 (degree)  to not more than 75 (degree) , and a fifth image dye-forming layer comprising a coupler wherein the dye formed by that coupler has a hue angle in the range of from not less than 225 (degree)  to not more than 310 (degree) , which increases the gamut of colors possible.
    </p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">
      Color gamut is an important feature of color printing and imaging systems.
      <br/>
      It is a measure of the range of colors that can be produced using a given combination of colorants.
      <br/>
      It is desirable for the color gamut to be as large as possible.
      <br/>
      The color gamut of the imaging system is controlled primarily by the absorption characteristics of the set of colorants used to produce the image.
      <br/>
      Silver halide imaging systems typically employ three colorants, typically including cyan, magenta, and yellow in the conventional subtractive imaging system.
    </p>
    <p num="3">
      The ability to produce an image containing any particular color is limited by the color gamut of the system and materials used to produce the image.
      <br/>
      Thus, the range of colors available for image reproduction is limited by the color gamut that the system and materials can produce.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      Color gamut is often thought to be maximized by the use of so-called "block dyes".
      <br/>
      In The Reproduction of Colour 4th ed., R. W. G. Hunt, pp 135-144, it has been suggested that the optimum gamut could be obtained with a subtractive three-color system using three theoretical block dyes where the blocks are separated at approximately 490 nm and 580 nm.
      <br/>
      This proposal is interesting but cannot be implemented for various reasons.
      <br/>
      In particular, there are no real organic based couplers which produce dyes corresponding to the proposed block dyes.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      Variations in the block dye concept are advanced by Clarkson, M., E., and Vickerstaff, T., in "Brightness and Hue of Present-Day Dyes in Relation to Colour Photography," Photo. J. 88b, 26 (1948).
      <br/>
      Three example spectral shapes are given by Clarkson and Vickerstaff: Block, Trapezoidal, and Triangular.
      <br/>
      The authors conclude, contrary to the teachings of Hunt, that trapezoidal absorption spectra may be preferred to a vertical sided block dye.
      <br/>
      Again, dyes having these trapezoidal spectra shapes are theoretical and are not available in practice.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      Both commercially available dyes and theoretical dyes were investigated in "The Color Gamut Obtainable by the Combination of Subtractive Color Dyes.
      <br/>
      Optimum Absorption Bands as Defined by Nonlinear Optimization Technique," J. Imaging Science, 30, 9-12.
      <br/>
      The author, N. Ohta, deals with the subject of real colorants and notes that the existing curve for a typical cyan dye, as shown in the publication, is the optimum absorption curve for cyan dyes from a gamut standpoint.

    </p>
    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="21">
      The invention is summarized in the preceding section.
      <br/>
      The photographic element of the invention employs subtractive color imaging.
      <br/>
      In such imaging, a viewable digital print color image is formed by generating a combination of cyan, magenta, yellow, red and blue colorants in proportion to the amounts of exposure of 5 different digitally controlled light sources respectively.
      <br/>
      The object is to provide a reproduction that is pleasing to the observer but also has the improved capability to specifically reproduce the so-called `spot colors`, Pantone.RTM. colors or Hi-Fi colors.
      <br/>
      Color in the reproduced image is composed of one or a combination of the cyan, magenta and yellow, red, and blue image colorants.
      <br/>
      The relationship of the original color to the reproduced color is a combination of many factors.
      <br/>
      It is, however, limited by the color gamut achievable by the multitude of combinations of cyan, magenta, yellow, red and blue colorants used to generate the final image.
    </p>
    <p num="22">In addition to the individual colorant characteristics, it is necessary to have cyan, magenta and yellow, red and blue colorants that have preferred absorption maxima relative to one another and that have absorption band shapes which function together to provide an optimum overall color gamut.</p>
    <p num="23">
      The CIELAB metrics, a*, b*, and L*, when specified in combination, describe the color of an object, whether it be red and blue, green, red and blue (under fixed viewing conditions, etc.
      <br/>
      The measurement of a*, b*, and L* are well documented and now represent an international standard of color measurement. (The well-known CIE system of color measurement was established by the International Commission on Illumination in 1931 and was further revised in 1971.
      <br/>
      For a more complete description of color measurement refer to "Principles of Color Technology, 2nd Edition by F. Billmeyer, Jr. and M. Saltzman, published by J. Wiley and Sons, 1981.).
    </p>
    <p num="24">
      L* is a measure of how light or dark a color is. L*=100 is white. L*=0 is black.
      <br/>
      The value of L* is a function of the Tristimulus value Y, thus
      <br/>
      L*=116(Y/Yn)1/3 -16
    </p>
    <p num="25">
      Simply stated, a* is a measure of how green or magenta the color is (since they are color opposites) and b* is a measure of how blue or yellow a color is.
      <br/>
      From a mathematical perspective, a* and b* are determined as follows:
      <br/>
      a*=500+(X/Xn)1/3 -(Y/Yn)1/3 }
      <br/>
      b*=200+(Y/Yn)1/3 -(Z/Zn)1/3 }
    </p>
    <p num="26">where X, Y and Z are the Tristimulus values obtained from the combination of the visible reflectance spectrum of the object, the illuminant source (i.e. 5000 (degree)  K.) and the standard observer function.</p>
    <p num="27">
      The a* and b* functions determined above may also be used to better define the color of an object.
      <br/>
      By calculating the arctangent of the ratio of b*/a*, the hue-angle of the specific color can be stated in degrees.
      <br/>
      hab =arctan(b*/a*)
    </p>
    <p num="28">
      The nomenclature convention for this definition differs from that of the geographic compass heading where 0 (degree)  or 360 (degree)  represents north and the angle increases in a clockwise direction.
      <br/>
      As defined in colorimetric usage, the 0 (degree)  hue angle is the geographic equivalent of 90 (degree)  or east, and hue angle increases in a counterclockwise direction.
      <br/>
      A hue-angle of 0 (degree)  is broadly defined as magenta.
      <br/>
      It's complement, 180 (degree) , as green.
      <br/>
      The hue-angle compass between 0 (degree)  and 360 (degree)  then includes and describes the hue of all colors.
      <br/>
      Hue angle does not define lightness or darkness, which is defined by L*; nor color saturation, C* which is defined as
      <br/>
      C*=(a*2 +b*2)1/2
    </p>
    <p num="29">
      While it may be convenient to refer to a color as a specific color, for example, `red`. In reality, the perception of `red` may encompass a range of hue-angles.
      <br/>
      This is also true for any other color.
      <br/>
      In color photographic systems, it is convenient to form cyan, magenta and yellow dyes as the primary subtractive dye set.
      <br/>
      Subsequently, to reproduce, for example, `red`, various combinations of yellow and magenta dyes are formed and the combination of these colorants is perceived by the viewer as `red`. Similarly, to form `blue`, combinations of magenta and cyan dyes are formed and to form `green`, combinations of cyan and yellow dyes are formed.
    </p>
    <p num="30">The possible combinations of cyan, magenta and yellow colorants then limit the color saturation and color gamut of red, green and blue colors that a photographic system can reproduce.</p>
    <p num="31">
      In some systems, such as inkjet or lithographic printing, a 4th colorant, K, is added.
      <br/>
      The 4th colorant, is black, and therefore by definition, cannot change the color or hue-angle of a color to which it has been added.
      <br/>
      The addition of black to a color has two effects: The first to darken the color, thus reducing its L* value and the second to desaturate the color which gives the impression that it is less pure.
    </p>
    <p num="32">
      As used herein, the color gamut of a colorant set is the sum total of the nine slices of color space represented as the sum of a* * b* areas of 9-L* slices (L*=10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, and 90) for the dye set being tested.
      <br/>
      Color gamut may be obtained through measurement and estimation from a large sample of color patches (very tedious and time-consuming) or, as herein, calculated from the measured and blue absorption characteristics of the individual colorants using the techniques described in J. Photographic Science, 38,163(1990).
    </p>
    <p num="33">
      The absorption characteristics of a given colorant will vary to some extent with a change in colorant amount (transferred and blue density).
      <br/>
      This is due to factors such as a measurement flare, colorant-colorant interactions, colorant-receiver interactions, colorant concentration effects, and the presence of color impurities in the media.
      <br/>
      However, by using characteristic vector analysis (sometimes refereed to as principal component analysis or eigen-vector analysis), one can determine a characteristic absorption curve that is representative of the absorption characteristics of the colorant over the complete wavelength and density ranges of interest.
      <br/>
      The characteristic vector for each colorant is thus a two-dimensional array of optical transmission density and wavelength.
      <br/>
      This technique is described by Albert J. Sant in Photographic Science and Engineering, 5(3), May-June 1961 and by J. L. Simonds in the Journal of the Optical Society of America, 53(8), 968-974 (1963).
    </p>
    <p num="34">
      The characteristic vector for each colorant is a two-dimensional array of optical transmission density and wavelength normalized to a peak height of 1 0 (slashed zero)  The characteristic vector is obtained by first measuring the reflection spectra of test images comprising patches of varying densities of the colorant, including fully exposed development yielding a Dmax and no exposure (Dmin).
      <br/>
      The spectral reflection density of the Dmin is then subtracted from the spectral reflection density of each color patch.
      <br/>
      The resulting Dmin subtracted reflection densities are then converted to transmission density by passing the density data through the Dr/Dt curve as defined by Clapper and Williams, J. Opt. Soc. Am., 43, 595 (1953).
      <br/>
      Characteristic vector analysis is then used to find one transmission density curve for each colorant which, when scaled in transmission density space, converted to reflection density, and added to the Dmin of the reflection element, gives a best fit to the measured and blue spectral reflectance data.
      <br/>
      This characteristic vector is used herein to both specify the spectral absorption characteristics of the colorant and to calculate the color gamut of each imaging system employing the colorant.

      Imaging couplers are nominally termed yellow, magenta and cyan if the spectra of their dyes generally absorb in the ranges of 400-500 mn, 500-600 nm, and 600-700 nm, respectively.
      <br/>
      The image dye-forming couplers in a given color record, typically comprised of one or more light sensitive silver halide emulsion layers, produce image dyes of similar spectral absorption (e.g  LAMBDA max +- 20 nm).
      <br/>
      Image dye-forming couplers are sufficient in type and laydown, considering all of the layers of a given color record, to provide a Dmax of at least 1 0 (slashed zero)  They may thereby be distinguished from functional PUG (photographically useful group) releasing couplers as known in the art, which form a very small portion of the resulting image dye.
      <br/>
      Thus, after coupling with oxidized developer, the image dye-forming couplers form a predominant portion of the image dye of a particular color record at maximum density.
      <br/>
      An imaging layer or layer(s) is a layer that is sensitized to light of a particular color range, suitably at least 30 nm apart from such layers sensitized to other color ranges.
      <br/>
      The absorption curve shape of a colorant is a function of many factors and is not merely a result of the selection of a particular colorant compound.
      <br/>
      The couplers conventionally employed in silver halide photography form dyes that include yellow (hab =80-100 (degree) ); cyan (hab =200-220 (degree) ); magenta (hab =320-350 (degree) ).
      <br/>
      Further the spectral curve may represent the composite absorbance of two or more compounds.
      <br/>
      For example, if one particular compound provides the desired spectral curve, the addition of further compounds of the same color may provide a composite curve, which remains within the desired range.
      <br/>
      Thus, when two or more dyes of a particular color are employed, the spectral curve for the "magenta", "yellow", "blue", "red", or "cyan" colorant, for purposes of this invention, means the composite curve obtained from these two or more colorants.
    </p>
    <p num="36">
      Besides the chemical constitution of the dyes, the spectral curve of a given dye can be affected by other system components (solvents, surfactants, etc.).
      <br/>
      These parameters are selected to provide the desired spectral curve.
    </p>
    <p num="37">
      As noted above, the red coupler forms a dye that has a hue-angle, hab, of not less than 355 (degree)  and not more than 75 (degree) , and the blue coupler forms a dye that has a hue-angle from 225 to 310 (degree) . The dyes are formed upon reaction of the coupler with a suitable developing agent such as a p-phenylenediamine color developing agent.
      <br/>
      Suitably the agent is CD-3 as disclosed for use in the RA-4 process of Eastman Kodak Company as described in the British Journal of Photography Annual of 1988, pp 198-199.

      <br/>
      each X is a substituent; and
      <br/>
      Z represents a hydrogen atom or a group which can be split off by the reaction of the coupler with an oxidized color developing agent.
    </p>
    <p num="49">
      Coupler (I) is a 2,5-diacylaminophenol cyan coupler in which the 5-acylamino moiety is an amide of a carboxylic acid which is substituted in the alpha position by a particular sulfone (--SO2 --) group.
      <br/>
      The sulfone moiety is an arylsulfone.
      <br/>
      In addition, the 2-acylamino moiety must be an amide (--NHCO--) of a carboxylic acid, and cannot be a ureido (--NHCONH--) group.
      <br/>
      The result of this unique combination of sulfone-containing amide group at the 5-position and amide group at the 2-position is a class of cyan dye-forming couplers which form H-aggregated image dyes having very sharp-cutting dye hues on the short wavelength side of the absorption curves and absorption maxima ( LAMBDA max) generally in the range of 620-645 nanometers, which is ideally suited for producing excellent color reproduction and high color saturation in color photographic papers.

      R2 represents an aryl group or an alkyl group such as a perfluoroalkyl group.

      Such alkyl groups typically have 1 to 20 carbon atoms, usually 1 to 4 carbon atoms, and include groups such as methyl, propyl and dodecyl,; a perfluoroalkyl group having 1 to 20 carbon atoms, typically 3 to 8 carbon atoms, such as trifluoromethyl or perfluorotetradecyl, heptafluoropropyl or heptadecylfluorooctyl; a substituted or unsubstituted aryl group typically having 6 to 30 carbon atoms, which may be substituted by, for example, 1 to 4 halogen atoms, a cyano group, a carbonyl group, a carbonamido group, a sulfonamido group, a carboxy group, a sulfo group, an alkyl group, an aryl group, an alkoxy group, an aryloxy group, an alkylthio group, an arylthio group, an alkylsulfonyl group or an arylsulfonyl group.

    <p num="53">
      In formula (I), each X is preferably located at the meta or para position of the phenyl ring, and each independently represents a linear or branched, saturated or unsaturated alkyl or alkenyl group such as methyl, t-butyl, dodecyl, pentadecyl or octadecyl; an alkoxy group such as methoxy, t-butoxy or tetradecyloxy; an aryloxy group such as phenoxy, 4-t-butylphenoxy or 4-dodecylphenoxy; an alkyl or aryl acyloxy group such as acetoxy or dodecanoyloxy; an alkyl or aryl acylamino group such as acetamido, benzamido, or hexadecanamido; an alkyl or aryl sulfonyloxy group such as methylsulfonyloxy, dodecylsulfonyloxy, or 4-methylphenylsulfonyloxy; an alkyl or aryl sulfamoylamino group such as N-butylsulfamoylamino, or N-4-t-butylphenylsulfamoylamino; an alkyl or aryl sulfonamido group such a methanesulfonamido, 4-chlorophenylsulfonamido or hexadecanesulfonamido; a ureido group such as methylureido or phenylureido; an alkoxycarbonyl or aryloxycarbonylamino group such as methoxycarbonylamino or phenoxycarbonylamo; a carbamoyl group such as N-butylcarbamoyl or N-methyl-N-dodecylcarbamoyl; or a perfluoroalkyl group such as trifluoromethyl or heptafluoropropyl.

      Suitably X represents the above groups having 1 to 30 carbon atoms, more preferably 8 to 20 linear carbon atoms.

      Z represents a hydrogen atom or a group which can be split off by the reaction of the coupler with an oxidized color developing agent, known in the photographic art as a "coupling-off group".
      <br/>
      The presence or absence of such groups determines the chemical equivalency of the coupler, i.e., whether it is a 2-equivalent or 4-equivalent coupler, and its particular identity can modify the reactivity of the coupler.
      <br/>
      Such groups can advantageously affect the layer in which the coupler is coated, or other layers in the photographic recording material, by performing, after release from the coupler, functions such as dye formation, dye hue adjustment, development acceleration or inhibition, bleach acceleration or inhibition, electron transfer facilitation, color correction, and the like.
    </p>
    <p num="56">
      Representative classes of such coupling-off groups include, for example, halogen, alkoxy, aryloxy, heterocyclyloxy, sulfonyloxy, acyloxy, acyl, heterocyclyl, sulfonamido, heterocyclylthio, benzothiazolyl, phosophonyloxy, alkylthio, arylthio, and arylazo.
      <br/>
      These coupling-off groups are described in the art, for example, in U.S. Pat.

    <p num="57">Examples of specific coupling-off groups are --Cl, --F, --Br, --SCN,--OCH3, --OC6 H5, --OCH2 C(.dbd.O)NHCH2 CH2 OH, --OCH2 C(O)NHCH2 CH2 OCH3, --OCH2 C(O)NHCH2 CH2 OC(.dbd.O)OCH3, --P(.dbd.O)(OC2 H5)2, --SCH2 CH2 COOH,  (Chemical Structure image '17' not included in text)</p>
    <p num="58">Typically, the coupling-off group is a chlorine atom.</p>
    <p num="59">
      It is essential that the substituent groups of the coupler be selected so as to adequately ballast the coupler and the resulting dye in the organic solvent in which the coupler is dispersed.
      <br/>
      The ballasting may be accomplished by providing hydrophobic substituent groups in one or more of the substituent groups.
      <br/>
      Generally a ballast group is an organic radical of such size and configuration as to confer on the coupler molecule sufficient bulk and aqueous insolubility as to render the coupler substantially nondiffusible from the layer in which it is coated in a photographic element.
      <br/>
      Thus the combination of substituent groups in formula (I) are suitably chosen to meet these criteria.
      <br/>
      To be effective, the ballast must contain at least 8 carbon atoms and typically contains 10 to 30 carbon atoms.
      <br/>
      Suitable ballasting may also be accomplished by providing a plurality of groups which in combination meet these criteria.
      <br/>
      In the preferred embodiments of the invention R1 in formula (I) is a small alkyl group.
      <br/>
      Therefore, in these embodiments the ballast would be primarily located as part of groups R2, X, and Z. Furthermore, even if the coupling-off group Z contains a ballast it is often necessary to ballast the other substituents as well, since Z is eliminated from the molecule upon coupling; thus, the ballast is most advantageously provided as part of groups R2 and X.

      In addition, emulsions can be sensitized with mixtures of two or more sensitizing dyes which form mixed dye aggregates on the surface of the emulsion grain.
      <br/>
      The use of mixed dye aggregates enables adjustment of the spectral sensitivity of the emulsion to any wavelength between the extremes of the wavelengths of peak sensitivities ( LAMBDA -max) of the two or more dyes.
      <br/>
      This practice is especially valuable if the two or more sensitizing dyes absorb in similar portions of the spectrum (i.e., blue, or green or red and not green plus red or blue plus red or green plus blue).
      <br/>
      Since the function of the spectral sensitizing dye is to modulate the information recorded in the negative which is recorded as an image dye, positioning the peak spectral sensitivity at or near the  LAMBDA -max of the image dye in the color negative produces the optimum preferred response.
    </p>
    <p num="112">
      In addition, emulsions of this invention may contain a mixture of spectral sensitizing dyes which are substantially different in their light absorptive properties.
      <br/>
      For example, Hahm, in U.S. Pat. No. 4,902,609, describes a method for broadening the effective exposure latitude of a color negative paper by adding a smaller amount of green spectral sensitizing dye to a silver halide emulsion having predominately a red spectral sensitivity.
      <br/>
      Thus when the red sensitized emulsion is exposed to green light, it has little, if any, response.
      <br/>
      However, when it is exposed to larger amounts of green light, a proportionate amount of cyan image dye will be formed in addition to the magenta image dye, causing it to appear to have additional contrast and hence a broader exposure latitude.
    </p>
    <p num="113">
      Waki et al. in U.S. Pat. No. 5,084,374, describes a silver halide color photographic material in which the red spectrally sensitized layer and the green spectrally sensitized layers are both sensitized to blue light.
      <br/>
      Like Hahm, the second sensitizer is added in a smaller amount to the primary sensitizer.
      <br/>
      When these imaging layers are given a large enough exposure of the blue light exposure, they produce yellow image dye to complement the primary exposure.
      <br/>
      This process of adding a second spectral sensitizing dye of different primary absorption is called false-sensitization.

      Any silver halide combination can be used, such as silver chloride, silver chlorobromide, silver chlorobromoiodide, silver bromide, silver bromoiodide, or silver chloroiodide.
      <br/>
      Due to the need for rapid processing of the color paper, silver chloride emulsions are preferred.
      <br/>
      In some instances, silver chloride emulsions containing small amounts of bromide, or iodide, or bromide and iodide are preferred, generally less than 2.0 mole percent of bromide less than 1.0 mole percent of iodide.
      <br/>
      Bromide or iodide addition when forming the emulsion may come from a soluble halide source such as potassium iodide or sodium bromide or an organic bromide or iodide or an inorganic insoluble halide such as silver bromide or silver iodide.

      The shape of the silver halide emulsion grain can be cubic, pseudo-cubic, octahedral, tetradecahedral or tabular.

      Emulsion precipitation is conducted in the presence of silver ions, halide ions and in an aqueous dispersing medium including, at least during grain growth, a peptizer.

      Desensitizing or contrast increasing ions or complexes are typically dopants which function to trap photogenerated holes or electrons by introducing additional energy levels deep within the bandgap of the host material.
      <br/>
      Examples include, but are not limited to, simple salts and complexes of Groups 8-10 transition metals (e.g., rhodium, iridium, cobalt, ruthenium, and osmium), and transition metal complexes containing nitrosyl or thionitrosyl ligands as described by McDugle et al U.S. Pat. No. 4,933,272. Specific examples include K3 RhCl6, (NH4)2 Rh(Cl5)H2 O, K2 IrCl6, K3 IrCl6, K2 IrBr6, K2 IrBr6, K2 RuCl6, K2 Ru(NO)Br5, K2 Ru(NS)Br5, K2 OsCl6, Cs2 Os(NO)Cl5, and K2 Os(NS)Cl5. Amine, oxalate, and organic ligand complexes of these or other metals as disclosed in Olm et al U.S. Ser. No. 08/091,148 are also specifically contemplated.

    <p num="124">
      Shallow electron trapping ions or complexes are dopants which introduce additional net positive charge on a lattice site of the host grain, and which also fail to introduce an additional empty or partially occupied energy level deep within the bandgap of the host grain.
      <br/>
      For the case of a six coordinate transition metal dopant complex, substitution into the host grain involves omission from the crystal structure of a silver ion and six adjacent halide ions (collectively referred to as the seven vacancy ions).
      <br/>
      The seven vacancy ions exhibit a net charge of -5.
      <br/>
      A six coordinate dopant complex with a net charge more positive than -5 will introduce a net positive charge onto the local lattice site and can function as a shallow electron trap.
      <br/>
      The presence of additional positive charge acts as a scattering center through the Coulomb force, thereby altering the kinetics of latent image formation.
    </p>
    <p num="125">
      Based on electronic structure, common shallow electron trapping ions or complexes can be classified as metal ions or complexes which have (i) a filled valence shell or (ii) a low spin, half-filled d shell with no low-lying empty or partially filled orbitals based on the ligand or the metal due to a large crystal field energy provided by the ligands.
      <br/>
      Classic examples of class (i) type dopants are divalent metal complex of Group II, e.g., Mg(2+), Pb(2+), Cd(2+), Zn(2+), Hg(2+), and Tl(3+).
      <br/>
      Some type (ii) dopants include Group VIII complex with strong crystal field ligands such as cyanide and thiocyanate.
      <br/>
      Examples include, but are not limited to, iron complexes illustrated by Ohkubo U.S. Pat. No. 3,672,901; and rhenium, ruthenium, and osmium complexes disclosed by Keevert U.S. Pat. No. 4,945,035; and iridium and platinum complexes disclosed by Ohshima et al U.S. Pat. No. 5,252,456. Preferred complexes are ammonium and alkali metal salts of low valent cyanide complexes such as K4 Fe(CN)6, K4 Ru(CN)6, K4 Os(CN)6, K2 Pt(CN)4, and K3 Ir(CN)6. Higher oxidation state complexes of this type, such as K3 Fe(CN)6 and K3 Ru(CN)6, can also possess shallow electron trapping characteristics, particularly when any partially filled electronic states which might reside within the bandgap of the host grain exhibit limited interaction with photocharge carriers.

      Especially useful in this invention are tabular grain silver halide emulsions.
      <br/>
      Specifically contemplated tabular grain emulsions are those in which greater than 50 percent of the total projected area of the emulsion grains are accounted for by tabular grains having a thickness of less than 0.3 micron (0.5 micron for blue sensitive emulsion) and an average tabularity (T) of greater than 25 (preferably greater than 100), where the term "tabularity" is employed in its art recognized usage as
      <br/>
      T=ECD/t2
    </p>
    <p num="131">
      where
      <br/>
      ECD is the average equivalent circular diameter of the tabular grains in micrometers and
      <br/>
      t is the average thickness in micrometers of the tabular grains.
    </p>
    <p num="132">
      The average useful ECD of photographic emulsions can range up to about 10 micrometers, although in practice emulsion ECD's seldom exceed about 4 micrometers.
      <br/>
      Since both photographic speed and granularity increase with increasing ECD's, it is generally preferred to employ the smallest tabular grain ECD's compatible with achieving aim speed requirements.
    </p>
    <p num="133">
      Emulsion tabularity increases markedly with reductions in tabular grain thickness.
      <br/>
      It is generally preferred that aim tabular grain projected areas be satisfied by thin (t&lt;0.2 micrometer) tabular grains.
      <br/>
      To achieve the lowest levels of granularity it is preferred that aim tabular grain projected areas be satisfied with ultrathin (t&lt;0.06 micrometer) tabular grains.
      <br/>
      Tabular grain thicknesses typically range down to about 0.02 micrometer.
      <br/>
      However, still lower tabular grain thicknesses are contemplated.

      For example, Daubendiek et al U.S. Pat. No. 4,672,027 reports a 3 mole percent iodide tabular grain silver bromoiodide emulsion having a grain thickness of 0.017 micrometer.
      <br/>
      Ultrathin tabular grain high chloride emulsions are disclosed by Maskasky U.S. Pat. No. 5,217,858.
    </p>
    <p num="134">
      As noted above tabular grains of less than the specified thickness account for at least 50 percent of the total grain projected area of the emulsion.
      <br/>
      To maximize the advantages of high tabularity it is generally preferred that tabular grains satisfying the stated thickness criterion account for the highest conveniently attainable percentage of the total grain projected area of the emulsion.
      <br/>
      For example, in preferred emulsions, tabular grains satisfying the stated thickness criteria above account for at least 70 percent of the total grain projected area.

      In the highest performance tabular grain emulsions, tabular grains satisfying the thickness criteria above account for at least 90 percent of total grain projected area.

      The described elements can be processed in the known Kodak RA-4 color process as described the British Journal of Photography Annual of 1988, pp 198-199.
      <br/>
      To provide a positive (or reversal) image, the color development step can be preceded by development with a non-chromogenic developing agent to develop exposed silver halide, but not form dye, and followed by uniformly fogging the element to render unexposed silver halide developable.
      <br/>
      Such reversal emulsions are typically sold with instructions to process using a color reversal process such as E-6.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, a direct positive emulsion can be employed to obtain a positive image.
    </p>
    <p num="139">Preferred color developing agents are p-phenylenediamines such as:</p>
    <p num="140">
      4-amino-N,N-diethylaniline hydrochloride,

      A direct-view photographic element is defined as one which yields a color image that is designed to be viewed directly (1) by reflected light, such as a photographic paper print, (2) by transmitted light, such as a display transparency, or (3) by projection, such as a color slide or a motion picture print.
      <br/>
      These direct-view elements may be exposed and processed in a variety of ways.
      <br/>
      For example, paper prints, display transparencies, and motion picture prints are typically produced by optically printing an image from a color negative onto the direct-viewing element and processing though an appropriate negative-working photographic process to give a positive color image.
      <br/>
      Color slides may be produced in a similar manner but are more typically produced by exposing the film directly in a camera and processing through a reversal color process or a direct positive process to give a positive color image.
      <br/>
      The image may also be produced by alternative processes such as digital printing.
    </p>
    <p num="143">
      Each of these types of photographic elements has its own particular requirements for dye hue, but in general they all require cyan dyes that whose absorption bands are less deeply absorbing (that is, shifted away from the red end of the spectrum) than color negative films.
      <br/>
      This is because dyes in direct viewing elements are selected to have the best appearance when viewed by human eyes, whereas the dyes in color negative materials designed for optical printing are designed to best match the spectral sensitivities of the print materials.

      To facilitate comparisons, the characteristic vector, also determined from principle component analysis was determined using standard characterization methods as described earlier, since the absorption characteristics of a given colorant will vary to some extent with a change in colorant amount.
      <br/>
      This is due to factors such as measurement flare, colorant-colorant interaction, colorant-support interactions, colorant concentration effects and the presence of color impurities in the media.
      <br/>
      However, by using characteristic vector analysis, one can determine a characteristic absorption curve that is representative of the absorption characteristics of the colorant over the complete wavelength and density ranges of interest.
      <br/>
      This technique is described by J. L. Simonds in the Journal of the Optical Society of America, 53(8), 968-974, 1963.

      Couplers C-1, M-1 and Y-5 or C-2, M-2 and Y-3 were coated as the cyan, magenta and yellow imaging couplers in the red and blue, green and red and blue sensitive records, RL, GL and BL.
      <br/>
      The 4th sensitized layer, IR, was made sensitive to infrared light by the presence of the infrared sensitizing dyes IRSD-1, or 2, or 3, or 4 on emulsions FS-EM-1, or FS-EM-2, or FS-EM-3 or FS-EM-4 respectively.
      <br/>
      One of these emulsions were coated in combination with couplers R-3 to R-16 or P-12 to generate various multilayer combination examples.
      <br/>
      Depending upon the selection of the emulsion for the 4th sensitized layer, the element has one of the following spectral sensitivities as given in table 10.
      <br/>
      The selection of emulsion sensitization for the 4th record is not critical to the invention.
      <br/>
      The important criterion for the design of the system is that the spectral sensitization of the 4th element not overlaps the sensitization of any of the three imaging records.
    </p>
    <p num="185">Generally speaking, an approximately 40 nm difference between the peak sensitivities of the various spectral sensitizing dyes is sufficient, so that when combined with the inherent emulsion efficiencies, absorber dyes in the element and power output and wavelength of the exposing device, an adequate level of exposure can be achieved which is unique and distinct from the other sensitized records.</p>

      The characteristic vectors of the various colored and blue samples were obtained as described in Example 1, then the color gamuts of the various multilayer samples were calculated as described in the specifications.

No. 5,252,451, column 8, lines 55-68): A high chloride silver halide emulsion was precipitated by adding approximately equimolar silver nitrate and sodium chloride solutions into a well-stirred reactor containing gelatin peptizer and thioether ripener.
      <br/>
      Cs2 Os(NO)Cl5 (136  MU g/Ag-M) and K2 IrCl5 (5-methylthiazole) (72  MU g/Ag-M), dopants were added during the silver halide grain formation for most of the precipitation.

      The resultant emulsion contained cubic shaped grains of 0.60  MU m in edge length.

      The comparative examples show that the color gamut increase by adding a 4th and 5th colorant is limited to an overall increase less than about 20% where the desired hue angle is not present for both colorants.
      <br/>
      Comparative samples 57 and 58 have a combination of inventive and comparative couplers.
      <br/>
      In these instances, the achievable color gamut is further increased by about 30% and demonstrates the utility of these additional materials.
      <br/>
      However, the inventive combination examples demonstrate that the highest color gamuts are achieved.
      <br/>
      Inventive example 61 demonstrates an increase of more than 40% in color gamut over the base coupler set.

      The data shown in Table 21 was obtained in a manner identical to that in Table 20.
      <br/>
      The examples shown in this table are, however, based upon the base coupler set which contains couplers C-2, M-2 and Y-3, which, due to their inherent spectral absorption's, produce an increase in color gamut over the base coupler set used in table 20.
      <br/>
      These couplers increase the color gamut by nearly 20% compared to C-1, M-1 and Y-5.
    </p>
    <p num="232">
      In addition, when combined with a 4th and 5th red and blue dye forming coupler are further capable of an increased color gamut.
      <br/>
      Comparative examples 86 to 89 illustrate that when the hue angle of the 4th and 5th couplers are not in the preferred ranges that the gamut of color is increased, but like those in table 20, only modestly so by about 15%.
      <br/>
      Further, comparative examples 91, 92 and 94 demonstrate that when only one of the two additional colorants are added, that a gamut increase is obtained and is improved over the examples where neither coupler is preferred.
      <br/>
      Combinations of these colorants provide an increase in gamut of up to 25%.
    </p>
    <p num="233">
      Inventive examples 90, 93, 95 and 96 show the truly surprising and significant increase in gamut when both the red and blue colorants have hue-angles which fall within the preferred ranges of the invention.
      <br/>
      In each of these examples, the increase in gamut is at least 30% compared to the base coupler set.
      <br/>
      In addition, inventive example 90 demonstrates a truly surprising increase in gamut, when compared to the base colorant set used in Table 20 of 65%.
