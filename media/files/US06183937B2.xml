      Field of the Invention
    </p>
    <p num="2">
      The present invention relates generally to methods for forming patterned layers within microelectronics fabrications.
      <br/>
      More particularly, the present invention relates to methods for forming within microelectronics fabrications patterned layers of linewidth dimension narrower than the linewidth dimension of patterned photoresist layers employed in defining the patterned layers.
    </p>
    <p num="3">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
    <p num="4">Microelectronics fabrications are formed from microelectronics substrates over which are formed patterned microelectronics conductor layers which are separated by microelectronics dielectric layers.</p>
    <p num="5">
      As microelectronics fabrication technology has advanced, and microelectronics device and patterned microelectronics conductor layer density have increased, there has evolved a continuing and correlating trend towards decreasing linewidth dimensions of microelectronics devices and patterned microelectronics conductor layers through which are formed advanced microelectronics circuits within advanced microelectronics fabrications.
      <br/>
      The decreasing linewidth dimensions have typically traditionally been effected principally through decreasing the wavelength of photoexposure radiation employed in forming patterned photoresist layers which are employed in defining the linewidth dimensions of those microelectronics devices and patterned microelectronics conductor layers.
      <br/>
      Currently, photoexposure radiation is typically in the deep ultraviolet (DUV) (ie: 248 nanometer) wavelength region for forming microelectronics devices and patterned microelectronics layers of linewidth dimension typically as narrow as about 0.25 microns, while the most advanced photoexposure tooling typically employs a photoexposure radiation in the x-ray wavelength region for forming microelectronics devices and patterned microelectronics layers of linewidth dimensions in the deep sub-micron region as narrow as about 0.10 micron.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      While the trend towards decreasing wavelength of photoexposure radiation as a means for providing microelectronics devices and patterned microelectronics layers of decreased linewidth dimensions within advanced microelectronics fabrications will most certainly continue, it nonetheless becomes important to provide methods and materials through which the evolution from the current generations of microelectronics fabrications having formed therein microelectronics devices and patterned microelectronics layers defined by photoexposure tooling employing a deep ultra-violet (NUV) (ie: 248 nanometer) photoexposure radiation wavelength to future generations of microelectronics fabrications having formed therein microelectronics devices and patterned microelectronics layers defined by advanced generations of photoexposure tooling employing an x-ray photoexposure radiation wavelength may be smoothly facilitated.
      <br/>
      In that regard, it is typically desirable to characterize to the extent possible, through relevant research and development activities, advanced microelectronics devices and patterned microelectronics layers of decreased linewidth dimensions at the earliest possible opportunity prior to committing production of microelectronics fabrications having formed therein those advanced microelectronics devices and patterned microelectronics layers of decreased linewidth dimensions to advanced photoexposure tooling.
      <br/>
      Among other advantages, such pre-production characterization allows for efficient use of advanced photoexposure tooling when initiating production of the advanced microelectronics fabrications within a manufacturing environment.
    </p>
    <p num="7">In particular, within advanced integrated circuit microelectronics fabrications having formed therein advanced field effect transistors (FETs) defined by gate electrodes of diminished linewidth dimensions, it is typically desirable to fully characterize those advanced field effect transistors (FETs) prior to production of those advanced field effect transistors (FETs) since the gate electrode linewidth within a field effect transistor (FET) defines the channel width within the field effect transistor (FET) which in part defines the operational characteristics of the field effect transistor (FET).</p>
    <p num="8">It is thus towards providing a method for forming within advanced microelectronics fabrications advanced microelectronics devices and patterned microelectronics layers having decreased linewidth dimensions without the need for employing advanced photoexposure apparatus in forming those advanced microelectronics devices and patterned microelectronics layers that the present invention is generally directed.</p>
    <p num="9">Various photolithographic methods, materials and apparatus have been disclosed in the art of microelectronics fabrication for forming patterned photoresist layers within microelectronics fabrications.</p>
    <p num="10">
      For example, Capari, in U.S. Pat. No. 4,625,120, discloses a deep ultraviolet (DUV) flood exposure apparatus for irradiating a deep ultraviolet (DUV) sensitive photoresist layer formed upon a microelectronics substrate such as a semiconductor substrate.
      <br/>
      The apparatus employs a xenon lamp positioned at the focal point of a spherical reflector which in turn is positioned at one end of a cylindrical baffle, where the sidewalls of the cylindrical baffle are fabricated such that the deep ultraviolet (DUV) sensitive photoresist layer formed upon the microelectronics substrate when positioned at the opposite end of the baffle is irradiated with a substantially collimated deep ultraviolet (DUV) radiation beam.
    </p>
    <p num="11">
      In addition, Premlatha et al., in U.S. Pat. No. 5,385,804, disclose a silicon containing negative photoresist material derived from a polysilsesquioxane polymer having incorporated therein aromatic azide side groups.
      <br/>
      The silicon containing negative photoresist material is developable within an aqueous alkaline developer, while simultaneously possessing enhanced oxygen plasma resistance and high sensitivity to deep ultraviolet, i-line and electron beam photoexposure radiation.
    </p>
    <p num="12">
      Further, Okamoto, in U.S. Pat. No. 5,641,715, discloses a photolithographic method employing either a chemical amplification positive electron beam photoresist material layer or a chemical amplification negative electron beam photoresist material layer for forming integrated circuit microelectronics structures within integrated circuit microelectronics fabrications.
      <br/>
      The photolithographic method employs a conductive polymer layer formed upon the chemical amplification positive electron beam photoresist material layer or the chemical amplification negative electron beam photoresist material layer, in order to prevent electrical charging of either of the chemical amplification photoresist material layers and to stabilize either of the chemical amplification photoresist material layers during an electron beam writing process.
    </p>
    <p num="13">
      Finally, Munzel et al., in U.S. Pat. No. 5,650,262, disclose a high resolution negative chemical amplification photoresist material developable with wide process latitude in an aqueous alkaline media.
      <br/>
      The high resolution negative chemical amplification photoresist material comprises: (1) a radiation sensitive acid generator; (2) a compound which reduces the solubility of the resist in aqueous alkaline media in the presence the acid; and (3) a polyhydroxy compound.
    </p>
    <p num="14">
      Desirable in the art of microelectronics fabrication are photolithographic methods through which there may be formed within advanced microelectronics fabrications microelectronics devices and patterned microelectronics layers having decreased linewidth dimensions without employing advanced photoexposure apparatus in forming those advanced microelectronics devices and patterned microelectronics layers.
      <br/>
      It is towards that goal that the present invention is directed.

      The method of the present invention realizes this object by irradiating isotropically a patterned photoresist layer having a first linewidth to form a conformal surface layer decomposed patterned photoresist layer (i.e. a partially decomposed patterned photoresist layer) having a second linewidth narrower than the first linewidth, where the conformal surface layer decomposed patterned photoresist layer is subsequently employed as an etch mask layer when forming a patterned microelectronics layer from a blanket microelectronics layer formed interposed between a substrate and the conformal surface layer decomposed patterned photoresist layer.

    <p num="21">
      The method of the present invention may be employed where the microelectronics fabrication is an integrated circuit microelectronics fabrication.

    <p num="26">First Preferred Embodiment</p>
    <p num="27">
      Referring now to FIG. 1 to FIG. 4, there is shown a series of schematic cross-sectional diagrams illustrating the results of forming within a microelectronics fabrication in accord with a general embodiment of the present invention which comprises a first preferred embodiment of the present invention a patterned microelectronics layer.
      <br/>
      Shown in FIG. 1 is a schematic cross-sectional diagram of the microelectronics fabrication at an early stage in practice of the method of the present invention.
    </p>
    <p num="28">Shown in FIG. 1 is a substrate 10 employed within a microelectronics fabrication, where the substrate has formed thereupon a blanket microelectronics layer 12 which in turn has formed thereupon a blanket photoresist layer 14.</p>
    <p num="29">
      Within the first preferred embodiment of the present invention, the substrate 10 may be a substrate employed within a microelectronics fabrication selected from the group of microelectronics fabrications including but not limited to integrated circuit microelectronics fabrications, solar cell microelectronics fabrications, ceramic substrate microelectronics fabrications and flat panel display microelectronics fabrications.
      <br/>
      Although not specifically illustrated within the schematic cross-sectional diagram of FIG. 1, the substrate 10 may be a substrate itself employed within the microelectronics fabrication, or in the alternative, the substrate 10 may be the substrate employed within the microelectronics fabrication, where the substrate has formed thereupon and/or thereover any of several additional layers as are typically employed within the microelectronics fabrication.
      <br/>
      Such additional layers may include, but are not limited to, microelectronics conductor layers, microelectronics semiconductor layers and microelectronics dielectric layers.

    <p num="30">Similarly, although also not specifically illustrated within the schematic cross-sectional diagram of FIG. 1, the substrate may also have formed therein and/or thereupon any of several microelectronics devices as are conventional and appropriate to the microelectronics fabrication, where such microelectronics devices may include, but are not limited to, resistors, transistors, diodes and capacitors.</p>
    <p num="31">
      With respect to the blanket microelectronics layer 12, the blanket microelectronics layer 12 may be formed from any of several microelectronics materials as are conventional in the art of microelectronics fabrication, such microelectronics materials including but not limited to microelectronics conductor materials, microelectronics semiconductor materials and microelectronics dielectric materials.
      <br/>
      Typically and preferably, the blanket microelectronics layer 12 is formed to a thickness of from about 1000 to about 4000 angstroms.
    </p>
    <p num="32">
      With respect to the blanket photoresist layer 14, the blanket photoresist layer 14 is formed from a photoresist material which is susceptible to radiation induced conformal surface layer decomposition and attendant shrinkage.
      <br/>
      Within the first preferred embodiment of the present invention, the type of radiation employed within the radiation induced conformal surface layer decomposition and shrinkage may be the same type of radiation employed when photoexposing the blanket photoresist layer 14 to form a patterned photoresist layer.

      In the alternative, the type of radiation employed within the conformal surface layer decomposition and shrinkage may be a significantly different type of radiation than the type of radiation employed when photoexposing the blanket photoresist layer 14 to form a patterned photoresist layer.
      <br/>
      In the former circumstance, the blanket photoresist layer 14 as employed within the first preferred embodiment of the present invention is of necessity formed of a positive photoresist material.

      Such photoresist materials may include, but are not limited to, chemically amplified photoresist materials as are disclosed within the references within the Description of the Related Art, the teachings of which are incorporated herein fully by reference.
