      The present invention relates to a novel block copolymer, a rubber composition containing the block copolymer, and methods of producing the same.

      The block copolymer of the present invention can compatibilize mutually incompatible diene rubbers and can further provide a rubber composition having improved tensile strength, abrasion resistance, etc., without decreasing the vulcanization activity and further without changing the inherent properties of the polymer blend, for example, the low fuel consumption, wet braking performance, etc., by blending the block copolymer to a diene rubber.
      <br/>
      The block copolymer and rubber composition of the present invention may be suitably used in the fields of tire rubber etc.

    <p num="2">The present invention further relates to a pneumatic tire improved in abrasion resistance and chipping resistance.</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND ART</heading>
    <p num="3">
      In the past, rubber for use for tires of automobiles etc. has been required to have various performances such as strength, abrasion resistance, low heat buildup, high impact resilience, wet skid resistance, and chipping resistance.
      <br/>
      However it is difficult to satisfy these required performances by a single type of rubber, and therefore, for example, attempts have been made to balance and improve the performances by using blends of several diene rubbers such as blends of natural rubber and styrene-butadiene copolymer rubber (SBR).
      <br/>
      However, even if in the case of diene rubbers, since the rubbers are of different types, they are not necessarily fully compatible and sometimes are incompatible.
      <br/>
      In particular, when diene rubbers are incompatible, even if they are homogeneously mixed, it is difficult to obtain sufficient vulcanized properties.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      Therefore, in recent years, various methods have been proposed for compatibilize incompatible diene based rubbers.
      <br/>
      For example, Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication (Kokai) No. 7-188510 discloses a method of using, as a type of compatibilizing agent, a block copolymer composed of styrene-butadiene copolymer (SBR) block having a bound styrene content of not more than 30% by weight and an amount of vinyl bonds of the butadiene part of not more than 40 mol % and an SBR block with an amount of bonded styrene of not more than 30% by weight and a bound vinyl content of the butadiene part of not less than 70 mol %. However, in this method, there is the disadvantage that, while it is possible to compatibilize natural rubber and SBR, the vulcanization rate becomes slower and further the improvement in the abrasion resistance, tensile strength, and other vulcanized properties is not sufficient.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication (Kokai) No. 64-81811 reports a block copolymer composed of a polyisoprene block having a bound 1,4-cis content of not less than 65 mol % and an SBR block having a bound styrene content of 5 to 40% by weight and a bound vinyl content of the butadiene part of not less than 55 mol %. This block copolymer, when used as a compatibilizing agent for natural rubber and SBR, cannot give a sufficient effect of improvement of the abrasion resistance, tensile strength, etc.
      <br/>
      According to studies by the present inventors, this block copolymer only shows a single transition point in analysis by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC).
      <br/>
      This is deduced to be the cause for why a sufficient compatibilizing action cannot be obtained between different types of rubbers.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      In recent years, improvement of various performances has been sought from rubber compositions for tires of automobiles and the like.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the practice has been to blend several types of polymers in rubbers for tire blends etc.
      <br/>
      When these polymers are incompatible, a phase separation is present at the interface.
      <br/>
      In most cases, it is believed that this interface becomes a starting point of breakage and has an adverse effect on the tensile strength, tear strength, abrasion resistance, etc.
      <br/>
      However, in rubber products such as tires, the unique processing, i.e., vulcanization is involved, and therefore, it is not possible to apply as is the molecular design of block copolymers for controlling a phase structure such as is done in ordinary rubber/resin and resin/resin blends.
      <br/>
      However, the problem of the phase separation at the interface of rubber/rubber blends, has not been sufficiently studied and no method for solving the problem has been discovered either.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      In the past, the decrease in the breaking strength due to the incompatibility of a polymer blend obtained by blending in a block copolymer has not been sufficiently studied.
      <br/>
      Formulating a small amount of a block copolymer of polybutadiene (BR) and polyisoprene (IR) in a blend of natural rubber (NR)/polybutadiene rubber (BR) has only been briefly described in J. Apply. Polym. Sci., 49 (1993) and RCT. 66 (1993).
      <br/>
      The compositions of the block copolymers used in these references are not satisfactory in performance in actual use due to the insufficient compatibility with BR.
      <br/>
      Further, experiments have been made on adding cis-BR to incompatible polymer blends of cis-BR/SBR to improve the abrasion resistance, but there is a limit to the amount of the cis-BR added due to the decrease in the wet braking performance, and therefore, there have been problems in actual use.
    </p>
    <p num="8">In consideration of the above situation, the present inventors previously proposed tire trend compositions containing an A-B type block copolymer (see Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication (Kokai) No. 7-188510 and Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication (Kokai) No. 8-134267).</p>
    <p num="9">
      On the other hand, in the past, blends of several types of polymers have been used for treads of pneumatic tires to improve various aspects of their performance.
      <br/>
      In particular, when trying to improve the abrasion resistance and heat buildup property, a blend of styrene-butadiene copolymer rubber (SBR) or polybutadiene rubber (BR) having a low glass transition temperature (low Tg) is often used with a natural rubber (NR) or polyisoprene rubber (IR).
      <br/>
      However, in such a blend, there is the disadvantage that, while the abrasion resistance and heat buildup property are improved, the chipping resistance is inferior due to the low breaking strength and breaking energy.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      As mentioned above, the breaking strength and breaking energy are low in a blend of polymers due to the failure of the polymers to mix well with each other (incompatible).
      <br/>
      Since they are incompatible, there is a phase separation at the interface in the blend.
      <br/>
      This interface serves as the starting point for breakage and invites a decrease in the breaking energy.
      <br/>
      Further, since they are incompatible, the so-called "islands in the sea" state is present in the blend, and therefore, the carbon black introduced into the blend for reinforcement purposes are localized in different areas and the problem arises that the breaking strength is decreased.
      <br/>
      Therefore, as a measure against this, it has been proposed to add carbon black having a small particle size and low structure into the blend, but in this case as well it has not been possible to secure a sufficient abrasion resistance.
    </p>

    <heading>BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="22">
      The present inventors engaged in intensive studies for achieving the above objects and, as a result, found that a novel block copolymer containing a polymer of a conjugated diene and a copolymer block of a conjugated diene and an aromatic vinyl compound and having at least two transition points measured by differential scanning calorimetry within the range of -150 (degree)  C. to +150 (degree)  C. exhibits a remarkable effect of improvement of the compatibility among different types of diene rubbers.
      <br/>
      We further found that a rubber composition composed of this block copolymer blended in a diene rubber has excellent vulcanization rate, improved property of the abrasion resistance or tensile strength, and further remarkably improved abrasion resistance and chipping resistance when formed into a pneumatic tire.
      <br/>
      Further, the abrasion resistance may be further improved by narrowing the distribution of the molecular weight (Mw/Mn) of the block copolymer.
      <br/>
      By fine tuning the method of production of the block copolymer or the method of preparation of the rubber composition, it is possible to further bring out the above-mentioned characteristic points.
    </p>
    <p num="23">The present invention was completed based on the above findings.</p>
    <p num="24">
      The block copolymer according to the first aspect of the present invention includes a polymer block A composed of a conjugated diene and a random copolymer block B of a conjugated diene and an aromatic vinyl compound and has at least two transition points measured by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) within the range of -150 (degree)  C. to +150 (degree)  C. The number of transition points is preferably two.
      <br/>
      If there is only one transition point measured by DSC, it is not possible to sufficiently bring out the effect of compatibilization of insufficiently compatible or incompatible diene rubbers.
    </p>
    <p num="25">
      The conjugated diene used in the production of the block copolymer is not particularly limited.
      <br/>
      For example, 1,3-butadiene, 2-methyl-1,3-butadiene (that is, isoprene), 2,3-dimethyl-1,3-butadiene, 2-chloro-1,3-butadiene, 1,3-pentadiene, etc. may be mentioned.
      <br/>
      Among these, 1,3-butadiene, 2-methyl-1,3-butadiene, etc. are preferable.
      <br/>
      These conjugated dienes may be used alone or in any combinations of two or more.
    </p>
    <p num="26">
      The aromatic vinyl compound used in the production of the block copolymer is not particularly limited.
      <br/>
      For example, styrene, a-methylstyrene, 2-methylstyrene, 3-methylstyrene, 4-methylstyrene, 2,4-diisopropylstyrene, 2,4-dimethylstyrene, 4-t-butylstyrene, 5-t-butyl-2-methylstyrene, monochlorostyrene, dichlorostyrene, monofluorostyrene, etc. may be mentioned.
      <br/>
      Among these, styrene is preferable.
      <br/>
      These aromatic vinyl compounds may be used alone or in any combinations of two or more.
    </p>
    <p num="27">
      The polymer block A is a polymer block of substantially only a conjugated diene.
      <br/>
      In particular, when a polymer block of 2-methyl-1,3-butadiene, is used, the vulcanization rate, abrasion resistance, and tensile strength are preferably balanced to a high degree.
      <br/>
      If an olefinic monomer such as an aromatic vinyl compound is bonded in a significant amount with the polymer block A, when the block copolymer obtained is used as a compatibilizing agent for two or more types of diene rubbers, the vulcanization rate becomes slower and the effect of improvement of the abrasion resistance, tensile strength, etc. can no longer be obtained.
    </p>
    <p num="28">
      The microstructure of the polymer block A portion is not particularly limited.
      <br/>
      For example, the bound vinyl content (i.e., the amount of 1,2-vinyl bonds+the amount of 3,4-vinyl bonds) is normally in the range of 1 to 80 mol %. The amount of vinyl bonds is preferably 2 to 50 mol %, more preferably 3 to 30 mol %. At this time, the tendency is that the vulcanization rate becomes better and, further, the abrasion resistance, tensile strength, etc. are improved to a high degree.
      <br/>
      The bound vinyl content is particularly preferably often 3 to 15 mol %. The remaining bonds other than the vinyl bonds are 1,4-bonds.
      <br/>
      The ratio of the cis-1,4-bonds and trans-1,4-bonds among them is suitably selected depending upon the purpose of use.

    <p num="29">
      The amount of the bonded aromatic vinyl (S) in the copolymer block B is suitably selected in accordance with the purpose of use, but normally is 1 to 50% by weight, preferably 5 to 45% by weight, more preferably 20 to 40% by weight.
      <br/>
      When the bound aromatic vinyl content is in these ranges, the tensile strength of the rubber composition preferably becomes excellent.

    <p num="30">
      The microstructure of the conjugated diene portion in the copolymer block B is suitably selected depending upon the purpose of use and is not particularly limited.
      <br/>
      For example, the bound vinyl content (V) (i.e., 1,2-vinyl bonds or 1,2-vinyl bonds+3,4-vinyl bonds) is normally 1 to 55 mol % of the bound conjugated diene units in the copolymer block B. The bound vinyl content is preferably 5 to 55 mol %, more preferably 10 to 50 mol %. When the bound vinyl content is within this range, the vulcanized properties and abrasion resistance of the rubber composition are improved.
      <br/>
      The bonds other than the vinyl bonds of the conjugated diene portion are 1,4-bonds.
      <br/>
      The ratio of the cis-1,4-bonds and trans-1,4-bonds in these bonds is suitably selected depending upon the purpose of use.

      stands, the effect of compatibilization of the incompatible diene rubbers is high.
      <br/>
      In particular, the abrasion resistance and tensile strength can be preferably improved to a high degree.
    </p>
    <p num="33">
      Further, the ratio between the amount of 1,4-bonds (A-1,4) in the polymer block A and the amount of 1,4-bonds (B-1,4) in the conjugated diene portion in the copolymer B is not particularly limited and is suitably selected depending upon the purpose of use, but the molar ratio of (A-1,4):(B-1,4) is normally 1:9 to 9:1, preferably 3:7 to 7:3, more preferably 4:6 to 6:4.
      <br/>
      When the ratio of the two is within this range, preferably the vulcanization rate is better and the effect of improvement of the tensile strength, abrasion resistance, etc. is also high.

    <p num="34">
      The distribution of chains of the aromatic vinyl units in the copolymer block B is suitably selected depending upon the purpose of use, but independent chains with one bound aromatic vinyl measured by the ozone degradation method (hereinafter referred to as S1 chains) normally comprise at least 40% by weight of the total amount of bound aromatic vinyl, preferably at least 50% by weight, more preferably at least 60% by weight.

      The weight ratio (A:B) of the polymer block A and the copolymer block B is normally 5:95 to 95:5, preferably 10:90 to 70:30, more preferably 20:80 to 50:50.
      <br/>
      When the ratio of the polymer block A and the copolymer block B is within this range, the vulcanization rate is preferably sufficiently improved.

      If the weight average molecular weight (Mw) is excessively small, it is difficult to sufficiently bring out the effect of compatibilization and the effect of improvement of the abrasion resistance, tensile strength, etc. is also poor, while conversely if excessively large, the processability is decreased.

    <p num="66">
      That is, the present inventors observed that addition of a suitable block copolymer when kneading a phase-separated polymer blend resulted in the block copolymer acting as a compatibilizing agent and increasing the fineness of the phase structure and reinforcing the phase separated interface, but found that, if the cross-linking bonds between the blocks of the block copolymer and the polymer forming the matrix were not effectively caused at the time of vulcanization, the deformation at the time of vulcanization caused the finer phase structure and reinforced interface to return to their original states and the effect of improvement of the breaking strength etc. is decreased.
      <br/>
      They engaged in in-depth studies on prevention of this decrease in the effect of improvement of the breaking strength and, as a result, found that it was possible to solve the above-mentioned problems by specifying the amounts and ratio of the 1,4-bonds contained in the blocks of the block polymer and causing the cross-linking reaction between the blocks and the matrices to proceed at substantially the equivalent rates.
    </p>
    <p num="67">
      The blocks A' and B' of the block copolymers used in the present invention have to be mutually incompatible or else the block copolymer molecules cannot sufficiently invade the matrix phases X' and Y', and therefore, the desired effect of improvement of the breaking properties cannot be obtained.

      Further, in the present invention, the block A' must be compatible with the polymer phase X' and incompatible with the polymer phase Y', while the block B' must be compatible with the polymer phase Y' and incompatible with the polymer phase X'. When this relationship is not maintained, the block copolymer cannot be positioned at the X' and Y' phase separated interface, and therefore, the phase separated interface is not reinforced and a sufficient effect of improvement of the breaking strength cannot be unpreferably obtained.

If the ratio A'/B' is out of this range, a difference in the progress of the cross-linking arises between the blocks A' and B' of the block copolymer and the matrix phases X' and Y' at the time of the vulcanization reaction, the phase separated structure made finer in the kneading process reagglomerates and enlarges, and therefore, the desired effect of improvement of the breaking strength is not unpreferably obtained.</p>

      Further, showing the method of calculation of the amount of 1,4-bonds (when converted to molecular weight), if the styrene content (wt %) of a block measured in the process of polymerization of the block copolymer is St, the content of the vinyl polymerization unit of the conjugated diene polymer portion (total amount of 1,2-vinyl content (mol %) and 3,4-vinyl content (mol %) is Vn, the weight average molecular weight of the block copolymer as a whole is Mw, and the weight ratio of the block i is Wi, the amount of the 1,4-bonds of the block i (converted to molecular weight) is calculated by the following formula:

      Further, the carbon black used in the third aspect of the present invention must be those having a CTAB surface area of more than 125 m2 /g, preferably 125 to 170 m2 /g, and a C-DBP oil absorption of 100 to 150 ml/100 g, preferably 110 to 130 mol/100 g. If a CTAB surface area is not more than 125 m2 /g, the heat buildup property becomes lower, but unpreferably it is not possible to improve both of the properties of the abrasion resistance and the chipping resistance.
      <br/>
      If a C-DBP oil absorption is less than 100 ml/100 g, the improvement of the abrasion resistance is insufficient, while if more 150 ml/100 g, the elongation declines and there is a remarkable reduction in the chipping resistance.
      <br/>
      The CTAB surface area is measured, according to ASTM D 3765-80.

      In the present invention, a pneumatic tire is formed by using, as a tread, a rubber composition composed of 100 parts by weight of a rubber component composed of (i) 50 to 90 parts by weight of NR and/or IR, (ii) 8 to 40 parts by weight of SBR or BR having a Tg of not more than -75 (degree)  C., and (iii) 0.5 to 20 parts by weight of the above X"-Y" (or Y'") type block copolymer in which 35 to 55 parts by weight of carbon black is formulated.

    <p num="102">
      The present invention will now be explained in further detail with reference to Examples, Standard Examples, and Comparative Examples, but, of course, the scope of the present invention is not limited to these embodiments.
      <br/>
      The "parts" and "%" in the following Examples are all based on weight unless otherwise specified.
    </p>
    <p num="103">The methods of measurement of the physical properties were as follows:</p>
    <p num="104">Bound Styrene Content</p>
    <p num="105">The bound styrene content in the block copolymer was measured according to JIS K6383 (refraction rate method).</p>
    <p num="106">Bound Vinyl Content</p>
    <p num="107">The bound vinyl content of the conjugated diene portion in the block copolymer was measured by infrared spectrometry (Hampton method).</p>
    <p num="108">Molecular Weight and Distribution of Molecular Weight</p>
    <p num="109">
      The molecular weight and distribution of molecular weight of the block copolymer were measured by GPC.
      <br/>
      The weight average molecular weight (Mw) converted to standard polystyrene and the ratio (Mw/Mn) of the weight average molecular weight (Mw) and the number average molecular weight (Mn) for each were measured.
      <br/>
      As the columns, two GMH-HR-H made by Toso K.K. were used.
    </p>
    <p num="110">Mooney Viscosity</p>
    <p num="111">The Mooney viscosity (ML1+4, 100 (degree)  C.) was measured according to JIS K6301.</p>
    <p num="112">Transition Points</p>
    <p num="113">
      The transition points of the block copolymers, rubbers, and mixtures of the same were measured by weighing 10 +- 5 mg from each sample, using a differential scanning calorimeter (DSC made by Perkin-Elmer Co.) to measure the differential scanning calories in a nitrogen atmosphere while raising the temperature from -150 (degree)  C. to +150 (degree)  C. at a rate of temperature rise of 80 (degree)  C./minute, and differentiating the obtained endothermic curve to find the points of inflection.
      <br/>
      The points of inflection were used as the transition points.

    <p num="114">Tensile Strength</p>
    <p num="115">The tensile strength was measured according to JIS K6301.</p>
    <p num="116">Abrasion Resistance</p>
    <p num="117">
      The abrasion resistance was measured using a Pico abrasion tester according to ASTM D2228.
      <br/>
      The abrasion resistance was indicated indexed to one of the Comparative Examples as 100 (abrasion resistance index).
      <br/>
      The larger this index, the better.
    </p>
    <p num="118">Vulcanization Rate</p>
    <p num="119">
      The vulcanization rate was determined by measuring the vulcanization density ratio.
      <br/>
      The vulcanization density ratio was obtained using an oscillating disk rheometer (ODR) made by Shimadzu Seisakusho to measure the difference between the minimum torque at 170 (degree)  C. and the torque at 10 minutes time and indexing this to one of the Comparative Examples as 100.
      <br/>
      The slower the vulcanization rate, the longer the vulcanization time required.
      <br/>
      The higher at 10 minutes time (i.e., the larger the index), the faster the vulcanization rate shown.

      From the results of Table I-3, it is learned that if the block copolymer I-1 of the present invention is used, a rubber composition is obtained with an excellent vulcanization rate and superior properties such as tensile strength and abrasion resistance (see Examples I-1 to I-4).
      <br/>
      Further, it was learned that, when mixing two types of incompatible rubbers (SBR and IR) and the block copolymer I-1, the separation mixing method of mixing one rubber (SBR or IR) and the block copolymer I-1, then mixing the mixture and the other rubber has a higher effect of improvement of the tensile strength and the abrasion resistance than the all-at-once-mixing method of mixing the two types of rubbers and the block copolymer all together (comparison of Examples I-1 and I-2).
      <br/>
      According to the separation mixing method, a sufficient effect of improvement is manifested even if the amount of the block copolymer I-1 formulated is slight (Example I-4).
      <br/>
      On the other hand, when a block copolymer 1-3 with a single transition point is used (Comparative Example I-2), it is learned that the vulcanization rate is slow and the improvement of the tensile strength, abrasion resistance, etc. is insufficient.

      From the results of Table I-6, it is learned that the rubber compositions using the block copolymers of the present invention (Examples I-5 to I-11) exhibit a sufficiently fast vulcanization rate and are superior in tensile strength and abrasion resistance as well even compared with the combination of rubbers with fast vulcanization rates (Comparative Example I-3).
      <br/>
      Further, it is learned that the larger the weight average molecular weight (Mw) of a block copolymer, the better the vulcanization rate and the more superior the tensile strength and abrasion resistance as well (comparison of Examples I-5 and I-6), that the narrower the distribution of molecular weight, the more superior the properties of the tensile strength and the abrasion resistance (comparison of Examples I-5 and I-7), that the properties change when the ratio of the amounts of the 1,4-bonds (weight) between the block A and the block B differs and the closer the ratio to 50:50, the more superior the properties of the tensile strength and the abrasion resistance (comparison of Examples I-5, I-9, and I-10), that even if the ratio of the amounts of 1,4-bonds (weight) of the block A and the block B is away from 50:50, it is possible to improve the tensile strength and the abrasion resistance by making the distribution of the amount of molecular weight narrower (comparison of Examples I-7 and I-9), etc.

      Regarding the vulcanization rate, when fabricating a tire, since there are a large number of members involved, the vulcanization times have to match or else some members will become overly vulcanized and there will be a serious effect on the durability and strength.

    <p num="169">
      1) The incompatibility of the polymer phases X' and Y' of a polymer blend is determined by vulcanizing the polymer blend, preparing an ultrathin sliced sample by the freezing method, then dyeing the air phase by a benzene solution of osmium tetroxide at room temperature for about 15 hours.
      <br/>
      This was observed through a transmission type electron microscope at a magnification of about 5000 *  to 10,000 *  to detect the presence of a phase separated structure.
    </p>
    <p num="170">2) The incompatibility of the blocks A' and B' of a block copolymer is determined by preparing a sample in the same way as above from the block copolymer in a nonvulcanized state, then observing it through a transmission type electron microscope at a magnification of about 60,000 *  to detect the presence of a phase separated structure.</p>
    <p num="171">3) The incompatibility of blocks of a block copolymer and the polymer phases of a polymer blend is determined by separately polymerizing and preparing polymers corresponding to the polymers comprising the blocks, mixing these with the various matrix polymers and vulcanizing the same, then preparing samples for observation under an electron microscope in the same way as above, and observing the same at magnifications of about 5000 *  to 10,000 *  to detect the presence of a phase separated structure.</p>
    <p num="172">
      The compatibility and incompatibility may also be determined by the determining method from a temperature dispersion curve of tan DELTA  if a peak is bimodal or not or the determining method by DSC measurement if several glass transition temperatures of the blend polymer are observed or not.
      <br/>
      Further, this can be judged by an optical microscope as well if the phase separated structure extends over several dozen microns.

      Among these, direct observation by an electron microscope is the method with the greatest sensitivity, but the measurement is troublesome.

      At the time of formulation, the compounding agents, other than the vulcanization accelerator and sulfur, and the starting rubber were mixed in a 1.7 liter Banbury mixer for 5 minutes, then the vulcanization accelerator and sulfur were formulated into the mixtures and the resultant mixture was kneaded by an 8-inch test kneading roll machine for 4 minutes to obtain the rubber compositions.
