    <heading>DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
    <p num="7">
      The present invention contemplates a plant packaging system comprising a sleeve having a combination of an protective upper portion and a decorative lower portion having a base and skirt for packaging a potted plant.
      <br/>
      The upper sleeve can be detached from the decorative portion of the package system once the function of the upper sleeve has been completed, thereby exposing the decorative cover and allowing the skirt portion to extend outwardly from the base.
      <br/>
      The upper sleeve and decorative cover components may comprise a unitary construction or may comprise separate components which are attached together by various bonding materials.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      More specifically, the present invention contemplates a plant cover for covering a pot means having an outer peripheral surface.
      <br/>
      The plant cover comprises (1) a base portion having a lower end, an upper end, and an outer peripheral surface, and having an opening extending from the upper end to the lower end, and (2) an upper sleeve portion extending from the upper end of the base portion and detachable therefrom, and wherein when the upper sleeve portion is detached from the upper end of the base portion, a portion of the base portion referred to as a skirt extends outwardly, upwardly or inwardly from the base.
      <br/>
      In general, the base portion is sized to substantially cover the outer peripheral surface of the pot means.
      <br/>
      The upper sleeve portion may be detachable via a detaching means such as perforations, tear strips and zippers.
      <br/>
      The plant cover may have an extended portion extending from the upper portion for serving as a handle or support device.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      A preferred version of the invention is a flexible sleeve which comprises a flattened body having a closed lower end, an open upper end, an outer peripheral surface, and an inner peripheral surface surrounding an inner retaining space.
      <br/>
      The sleeve further comprises a lower portion having an inner retaining space for enclosing the pot, an upper portion connected to the lower portion and sized to substantially surround and encompass the floral grouping when the pot and floral grouping are disposed within the sleeve, the upper portion detachable from the lower portion via perforations positioned in a predetermined pattern, and a bonding material disposed upon a portion of the inner peripheral surface, the bonding material for bondingly connecting a portion of the sleeve to the pot when the sleeve is opened and the pot is disposed within the inner retaining space thereby holding the lower portion of the sleeve in a position about the pot and the upper portion of the sleeve in a position about the floral grouping.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      The upper portion may be constructed from a first material and the lower portion from a second material different from the first material.
      <br/>
      The lower portion of the sleeve may comprise a skirt portion which extends from the base portion when the upper portion of the sleeve is detached.
      <br/>
      The sleeve may further comprise an extended portion of the upper portion for serving as a handle.
      <br/>
      The sleeve may further comprise a release material for preventing the bonding material from bondingly connecting to an opposing portion of the inner peripheral surface.
      <br/>
      A closure bonding material may be disposed upon the upper portion near the upper end for sealing the upper end of the sleeve for enclosing the floral grouping within the upper portion.
      <br/>
      The upper portion may further comprise apertures for enabling ventilation of the enclosed floral grouping.
    </p>
    <p num="11">The flattened body may be further defined as having a first side which has a first edge, a second edge, an upper edge, a lower edge, an outer surface and an inner surface, a second side which has a first edge, a second edge, an upper edge, a lower edge, an outer surface and an inner surface, and wherein in a flattened condition of the sleeve, the inner surface of the first side rests flatwise upon the inner surface of the second side and the first edge of the first side is sealed to the first edge of the second side and the second edge of the first side is sealed to the second edge of the second side.</p>
    <p num="12">
      In another embodiment, the sleeve may have a tab having a connected end and a free end wherein the connected end is connected to the outer peripheral surface of the lower portion of the sleeve, and further may have a bonding material for bondingly connecting the free end of the tab to a portion of the outer peripheral surface of the lower portion for tightening the lower portion of the sleeve about portion of a pot disposed within the sleeve for holding the sleeve in a position about the pot.
      <br/>
      The bonding material may be disposed upon the tab near the free end of the tab.
      <br/>
      Further, the bonding material may be disposed upon a portion of the outer peripheral surface of the lower portion of the flexible sleeve for receiving the free end of the tab.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, the bonding material may be disposed upon the tab near the free end of the tab and upon a portion of the outer peripheral surface of the lower portion of the flexible sleeve in a position to receive the free end of the tab when the tab is tightened.
      <br/>

    <p num="16">Further detail and explanation of the articles and methods of the present invention are forthcoming in the description provided below.</p>
    <p num="17">The Embodiments and Methods of Use of FIGS. 1-15</p>
    <p num="18">
      Shown in FIGS. 1 and 2A-2B and designated therein by the general reference numeral 10 is a flexible bag or sleeve of unitary construction.
      <br/>
      The sleeve 10 initially comprises a flexible flattened piece of material which is openable into the form of a tube or sleeve.
      <br/>
      The sleeve 10 may be tapered outwardly from the lower end toward a larger diameter at its upper end.
      <br/>
      In its flattened state the sleeve 10 may have an overall trapezoidal, modified trapezoidal or contoured (non-linear) shape, and when opened is generally substantially frusto-conical to coniform.
      <br/>
      It will be appreciated, however, that the sleeve 10 may comprise variations on the aforementioned shapes or may comprise significantly altered shapes such as square or rectangular, wherein the sleeve 10 when opened has a cylindrical form, as long as the sleeve 10 functions in accordance with the present invention in the manner described herein.
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      The sleeve 10 has an upper end 12, a lower end 14, an outer peripheral surface 16 and in its flattened state has a sealed first edge 18 and a sealed second edge 20 and a first side 22 and a second side 24.
      <br/>
      The sleeve 10 has an opening 25 at the upper end 12 and preferably has a closed bottom at the lower end 14.
      <br/>
      Preferably the lower end 14 is closed with a gusset 26 but it may be sealed along an edge.
      <br/>
      The first side 22 has a first inner peripheral surface 28 and the second side 24 has a second inner peripheral surface 30 which together, when the sleeve 10 is opened, define and encompass an inner retaining space 32 as shown in FIG. 2.
      <br/>
      When the lower end 14 of the sleeve 10 has a closed bottom, a portion of the lower end 14 may be inwardly folded to form one or more gussets, as noted above for permitting a circular bottom of an object such as a potted plant to be disposed into the inner retaining space 32 of the lower end 14 of the sleeve 10.
    </p>
    <p num="20">
      The sleeve 10 is generally frusto-conically shaped, but the sleeve 10 may be, by way of example but not by way of limitation, cylindrical, frusto-conical, a combination of both frusto-conical and cylindrical, or any other shape, as long as the sleeve 10 functions as described herein as noted above.
      <br/>
      Further, the sleeve 10 may comprise any shape, whether geometric, non-geometric, asymmetrical and/or fanciful as long as it functions in accordance with the present invention.
      <br/>
      The sleeve 10 may also be equipped with drains or ventilation holes (not shown), or can be made from permeable or impermeable materials.
    </p>
    <p num="21">
      The material from which the sleeve 10 is constructed preferably has a thickness in a range from about 0.1 mils to about 30 mils, although in some cases the sleeve may be much thicker, especially when the sleeve is constructed from multiple layers.
      <br/>
      Often, the thickness of the sleeve 10 is in a range from about 0.5 mils to about 10 mils.
      <br/>
      Preferably, the sleeve 10 has a thickness in a range from about 1.0 mil to about 5 mils.
      <br/>
      More preferably, the sleeve 10 is constructed from material which is flexible, semi-rigid, rigid, or any combination thereof.
      <br/>
      The sleeve 10 may be constructed of a single layer of material or a plurality of layers of the same or different types of materials.
      <br/>
      Any thickness of the material may be utilized as long as the material functions in accordance with the present invention as described herein.
      <br/>
      The layers of material comprising the sleeve 10 may be connected together or laminated or may be separate layers.
      <br/>
      Such materials used to construct the sleeve 10 are described in U.S. Patent No. 5,111,637 entitled "Method For Wrapping A Floral Grouping" issued to Weder et al., on May 12, 1992, which is hereby incorporated herein by reference.
      <br/>
      Any thickness of material may be utilized in accordance with the present invention as long as the sleeve 10 may be formed as described herein, and as long as the formed sleeve 10 may contain at least a portion of a pot or potted plant or a floral grouping, as described herein.
      <br/>
      Additionally, an insulating material such as bubble film, preferable as one of two or more layers, can be utilized in order to provide additional protection for the item, such as the floral grouping, contained therein.
    </p>
    <p num="22">
      In one embodiment, the sleeve 10 may be constructed from two polypropylene films.
      <br/>
      The material comprising the sleeve 10 may be connected together or laminated or may be separate layers.
      <br/>
      In an alternative embodiment, the sleeve 10 may be constructed from only one of the polypropylene films.
    </p>
    <p num="23">
      The sleeve 10 may also be constructed, in whole or in part, from a cling material, "Cling Wrap or Material" when used herein means any material which is capable of connecting to the sheet of material and/or itself upon contacting engagement during the wrapping process and is wrappable about an item whereby portions of the cling material contactingly engage and connect to other portions of another material, or, alternatively, itself, for generally securing the material wrapped about at least a portion of a pot.
      <br/>
      This connecting engagement is preferably temporary in that the material may be easily removed, i.e., the cling material "clings" to the pot.
    </p>
    <p num="24">
      The cling material is constructed and treated if necessary, from polyethylene such as Cling Wrap made by Glad.RTM., First Brands Corporation, Danbury, Conn.
      <br/>
      The thickness of the cling material will, in part, depend upon the size of sleeve 10 and the size of the pot in the sleeve 10, i.e., generally, a larger pot may require a thicker and therefore stronger cling material.
      <br/>
      The cling material will range in thickness from less than about 0.1 mils to about 10 mils, and preferably less than about 0.5 mils to about 2.5 mils and most preferably from less than about 0.6 mils to about 2 mils.
      <br/>
      However, any thickness of cling material may be utilized in accordance with the present invention which permits the cling material to function as described herein.
    </p>
    <p num="25">
      The sleeve 10 is constructed from any suitable material that is capable of being formed into a sleeve and wrapped about a pot and a floral grouping disposed therein.
      <br/>
      Preferably, the material comprises paper (untreated or treated in any manner), cellophane, metal foil, polymer film, non-polymer film, fabric (woven or nonwoven or synthetic or natural), cardboard, fiber, cloth, burlap, or laminations or combinations thereof.
    </p>
    <p num="26">
      The term "polymer film" means a man-made polymer such as a polypropylene or a naturally occurring polymer such as cellophane.
      <br/>
      A polymer film is relatively strong and not as subject to tearing (substantially non-tearable), as might be the case with paper or foil.
    </p>
    <p num="27">
      The material comprising the sleeve 10 may vary in color and may consist of designs or decorative patterns which are printed, etched, and/or embossed thereon using inks or other printing materials.
      <br/>
      An example of an ink which may be applied to the surface of the material is described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,147,706 entitled "Water Based Ink On Foil And/Or Synthetic Organic Polymer" issued to Kingman on Sep. 15, 1992 and which is hereby incorporated herein by reference.
    </p>
    <p num="28">
      In addition, the material may have various coloring, coatings, flocking and/or metallic finishes, or other decorative surface ornamentation applied separately or simultaneously or may be characterized totally or partially by pearlescent, translucent, transparent, iridescent, neon, or the like, qualities.
      <br/>
      Each of the above-named characteristics may occur alone or in combination and may be applied to the upper and/or lower surface of the material comprising the sleeve 10.
      <br/>
      Moreover, portions of the material used in constructing the sleeve 10 may vary in the combination of such characteristics.
      <br/>
      The material utilized for the sleeve 10 itself may be opaque, translucent, transparent, or partially clear or tinted transparent.
    </p>
    <p num="29">
      It will generally be desired to use the sleeve 10 as a covering for a potted plant such as is well known in the art.
      <br/>
      The term "pot" as used herein refers to any type of container used for holding a floral grouping or plant.
      <br/>
      Examples of pots, used in accordance with the present invention include, but not by way of limitation, clay pots, wooden pots, plastic pots, pots made from natural mud/or synthetic fibers, or any combination thereof.
      <br/>
      The pot is adapted to receive a floral grouping in the retaining space.
      <br/>
      The floral grouping may be disposed within the pot along with a suitable growing medium described in further detail below, or other retaining medium, such as a floral foam.
      <br/>
      It will also be understood that the floral grouping, and any appropriate growing medium or other retaining medium, may be disposed in the sleeve 10 without a pot.
    </p>
    <p num="30">
      The term "floral grouping" as used herein means cut fresh flowers, artificial flowers, a single flower or other fresh and/or artificial plants or other floral materials and may include other secondary plants and/or ornamentation or artificial or natural materials which add to the aesthetics of the overall floral grouping.
      <br/>
      The floral grouping comprises a bloom or foliage portion and a stem portion.
      <br/>
      Further, the floral grouping may comprise a growing potted plant having a root portion (not shown) as well.
      <br/>
      However, it will be appreciated that the floral grouping may consist of only a single bloom or only foliage, or a botanical item (not shown), or a propagule (not shown). the term "floral grouping" may be used interchangeably herein with both the terms "floral arrangement" and "potted plant".
      <br/>
      The term "floral grouping" may also be used interchangeably herein with the terms "botanical item" and/or "propagule."
    </p>
    <p num="31">The term "growing medium" when used herein means any liquid, solid or gaseous material used for plant growth or for the cultivation of propagules, including organic and inorganic materials such as soil, humus, perlite, vermiculite, sand, water, and including the nutrients, fertilizers or hormones or combinations thereof required by the plants or propagules for growth.</p>
    <p num="32">
      The term "botanical item" when used herein means a natural or artificial herbaceous or woody plant, taken singly or in combination.
      <br/>
      The term "botanical item" also means any portion or portions of natural or artificial herbaceous or woody plants including stems, leaves, flowers, blossoms, buds, blooms, cones, or roots, taken singly or in combination, or in groupings of such portions such as bouquet or floral grouping.
    </p>
    <p num="33">The term "propagule" when used herein means any structure capable of being propagated or acting as an agent of reproduction including seeds, shoots, stems, runners, tubers, plants, leaves, roots or spores.</p>
    <p num="34">In accordance with the present invention, a bonding material is preferably disposed on a portion of the sleeve 10 to assist in holding the sleeve 10 to the pot having the floral grouping therein when such a pot is disposed within the sleeve 10 or to assist in closing the upper end of the sleeve 10 or adhering the sleeve 10 to the pot after the pot has been disposed therein, as will be discussed in further detail below.</p>
    <p num="35">
      It will be understood that the bonding material may be disposed as a strip or block on a surface of the sleeve 10 as is described in more detail herein.
      <br/>
      The bonding material may also be disposed upon either the first side 22, the second side 24, the first inner peripheral surface, or the second inner peripheral surface, of the sleeve 10, as well as upon the pot.
      <br/>
      Further, the bonding material may be disposed as spots of bonding material, or in any other geometric, non-geometric, asymmetric, or fanciful form and in any pattern including covering either the entire inner peripheral surface and/or outer peripheral surface of the sleeve 10 and/or the pot or pot cover.
    </p>
    <p num="36">
      The bonding material may be covered by a cover material or release strip which can be removed prior to the use of the sleeve, pot or pot cover.
      <br/>
      The bonding material can be applied by means known to those of ordinary skill in their art.
      <br/>
      One method for disposing a bonding material, in this case an adhesive, is described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,111,637 entitled "Method For Wrapping A Floral Grouping" issued to Weder et al., on May 12, 1992, which has been incorporated by reference above.
    </p>
    <p num="37">
      The term "bonding material or bonding means" when used herein means an adhesive, frequently a pressure sensitive adhesive, or a cohesive.
      <br/>
      When the bonding material is a cohesive, a similar cohesive material must be placed on the adjacent surface for bondingly contacting and bondingly engaging with the cohesive material.
      <br/>
      The term "bonding material or bonding means" also includes materials which are heat sealable and, in this instance, the adjacent portions of the material must be brought into contact and then heat must be applied to effect the seal.
      <br/>
      The term "bonding material or bonding means" also includes materials which are sonic sealable and vibratory sealable.
      <br/>
      The term "bonding material or bonding means" when used herein also means a heat sealing lacquer or hot melt material which may be applied to the material and, in this instance, heat, sound waves, or vibrations, also must be applied to effect the sealing.
    </p>
    <p num="38">
      The term "bonding material or bonding means" when used herein also means any type of material or thing which can be used to effect the bonding or connecting of the two adjacent portions of the material or sheet of material to effect the connection or bonding described herein.
      <br/>
      The term "bonding material or bonding means" may also include ties, labels, bands, ribbons, strings, tapes (including single or double-sided adhesive tapes), staples or combinations thereof which may be used in accordance with the present invention.
      <br/>
      Some of the bonding materials would secure the ends of the material while other bonding material may bind the circumference of a wrapper, or a sleeve, or, alternatively and/or in addition, the bonding materials would secure overlapping folds in the material and/or sleeve.
      <br/>
      Another way to secure the wrapping and/or sleeve is to heat seal the ends of the material to another portion of the material.
      <br/>
      One way to do this is to contact the ends with an iron of sufficient heat to heat seal the material.
    </p>
    <p num="39">
      Alternatively, a cold seal adhesive may be utilized as the bonding material or means.
      <br/>
      The cold seal adheres only to a similar substrate, acting similarly as a cohesive, and binds only to itself.
      <br/>
      The cold seal adhesive, since it bonds only to a similar substrate, does not cause a residue to build up on equipment, thereby both permitting much more rapid disposition and use of such equipment to form articles and reducing labor costs.
      <br/>
      Further, since no heat is required to effect the seal, the dwell time, that is, the time for the sheet of material to form and retain the desired shape is reduced.
      <br/>
      A cold seal adhesive binds quickly and easily with minimal pressure, and such a seal is not readily releasable.
      <br/>
      This characteristic is different from, for example, a pressure sensitive adhesive.
    </p>
    <p num="40">The term "bonding material or bonding means" when used herein also means any heat or chemically shrinkable material, and static electrical or other electrical means, chemical welding means, magnetic means, mechanical or barb-type fastening means or clamps, curl-type characteristics of the film or materials incorporated in material which can cause the material to take on certain shapes, cling films, slots, grooves, shrinkable materials and bands, curl materials, springs and any type of welding method which may weld portions of the material to itself or to the pot, or to both the material itself and the pot and which functions in accordance with the present invention.</p>
    <p num="41">Certain versions of the sleeve 10 described herein may be used in conjunction with a preformed plant cover as explained in greater detail below.</p>
    <p num="42">
      As shown in FIG. 1, the sleeve 10 is demarcated into an upper portion 36 and a lower portion 38.
      <br/>
      The lower portion 38 of the sleeve 10 is generally sized to contain the potted plant.
      <br/>
      The upper portion 36 may optionally have apertures 39 near the upper end thereof for allowing the sleeve 10 to be supported by a support mechanism such as a pair of wickets (not shown) such as is known in the art.
      <br/>
      The upper portion 36 of the sleeve 10 is generally sized to substantially surround and encompass the floral grouping of the potted plant disposed within the lower portion 38 of the sleeve 10.
      <br/>
      The sleeve 10 is demarcated into the upper portion 36 and the lower portion 38 by a detaching element 40 for enabling the detachment of is the upper portion 36 of the sleeve 10 from the lower portion 38 of the sleeve 10.
      <br/>
      In the version shown in FIG. 1, the detaching element 40 is a plurality of perforations which extend across the outer peripheral surface 16 of the sleeve 10 from the first edge 18 to the second edge 20.
    </p>
    <p num="43">
      The term "detaching element," or "detaching means" as used generally herein, means any element or means, or combination of elements, or features, such as, but not limited to, perforations, tear strips, tear starts, zippers, and any other devices or elements of this nature known in the art, or any combination thereof, which enable or facilitate the tearing away or detachment of one object from another.
      <br/>
      Therefore, while perforations are shown and described in detail herein, it will be understood that tear strips, zippers, or any other "detaching elements" known in the art, or any combinations thereof, could be substituted therefor and/or used therewith.
      <br/>
      The sleeve 10 may comprise drainage or ventilation holes in the upper or lower portions for allowing movement of gases or moisture to and away from the inner space of the sleeve (not shown).
    </p>
    <p num="44">
      In a preferred embodiment, as shown in FIGS. 1 and 2A-2B, the lower portion 38 of the sleeve 10 further comprises a base portion 42, and a skirt portion 44.
      <br/>
      The base portion 42 comprises that part of the lower portion 38 which, when the pot is placed into the lower portion 38, has an inner peripheral surface which is substantially adjacent to and surrounds the outer peripheral surface of the pot.
      <br/>
      The skirt portion 44 comprises that part of the lower portion 38 which extends beyond the upper rim of the pot and adjacent at least a portion of the floral grouping contained within the pot and which is left to freely extend straight from or at angle, inwardly or outwardly, from the base portion 42 when the upper portion of 36 of the sleeve 10 is detached from the lower portion 38 of the sleeve 10 by actuation of the detaching element 40.
      <br/>
      In the intact sleeve 10, the skirt portion 44 comprises an upper peripheral edge 46 generally congruent with the detaching element 40 which is connected to a lower peripheral edge 48 of the upper portion 36 of the sleeve 10 also congruent with the detaching element 40.
      <br/>
      In FIGS. 1 and 2, the upper peripheral edge 46 of the skirt portion 44 is congruent with a series of perforations which together comprise the detaching element 40.
    </p>
    <p num="45">
      The upper portion 36 of the sleeve 10 may also have an additional detaching element (not shown) such as a plurality of vertical perforations for facilitating removal of the upper portion 36 and which are disposed more or less vertically therein extending from the detaching element 40 to the upper end 12 of the sleeve 10.
      <br/>
      When the vertical detaching element is present the upper portion 36 of the sleeve 10 is separable from the lower portion 38 of the sleeve 10 by tearing the upper portion 36 along both the vertical perforations and along the detaching element 40, thereby separating the upper portion 36 from the lower portion 38 of the sleeve 10.
      <br/>
      The lower portion 38 of the sleeve 10 remains disposed as the base portion 42 about the pot and as the skirt portion 44 about the floral grouping which extends from the pot forming a decorative cover which substantially surrounds and encompasses the potted plant.
    </p>
    <p num="46">
      It will be understood that equipment and devices for forming standard floral sleeves are commercially available, and are well known to a person of ordinary skill in the art.
      <br/>
      A preferred method is discussed below.
    </p>
    <p num="47">
      As noted above, the sleeve 10 preferably has a closed lower end 14.
      <br/>
      When the lower end 14 is closed the lower end 14 may have one or more gussets 26 formed therein for allowing expansion of the lower end 14 when an object with a broad lower end such as a pot is disposed therein.
      <br/>
      In another version of the present invention the lower end 14 may be completely or partially open.
    </p>
    <p num="48">
      In the preferred version of the present invention, the sleeve 10 further comprises an area of bonding material 50 disposed upon a portion of the inner peripheral surface 28 of the base portion 42 of the sleeve 10.
      <br/>
      In another version of the present invention, the sleeve may be constructed without a bonding material thereon.
      <br/>
      In the case, the sleeve may be attached to the outer surface of the pot disposed therein by a bonding material applied to the outer surface of the pot.
      <br/>
      The area of bonding material 50, when present, functions to enable the inner peripheral surface 28, or a portion thereof, to be bondingly connected to the outer peripheral surface of the pot disposed therein causing the sleeve 10 to be bondingly connected to the pot.
    </p>
    <p num="49">
      The sleeve 10 in FIG. 2A is shown as partially opened, however, the sleeve 10 is generally provided to the operator in a substantially flattened condition and usually as one of a stack of sleeves.
      <br/>
      During the process of covering the pot, the sleeve 10 is opened, manually or automatically.
      <br/>
      In the flattened condition of the sleeve 10, the pot bonding material 50 may partially adhere to the opposite inner peripheral surface 30 of the sleeve 10.
      <br/>
      Obviously, it is desirable to avoid a situation in which the pot bonding material 50 is permanently or strongly bonded to the inner peripheral surface 30 of the sleeve 10 because this would make it difficult for the sleeve 10 to be manually or automatically opened for insertion of the pot.
      <br/>
      As a result, the pot bonding material 50 may be made of an adhesive composition which has a low degree of tackiness such that if the pot bonding material 50 does adhere to the inner peripheral surface 30 it can be easily separated from the surface 30 when the sleeve is opened up.
      <br/>
      Such adhesives with low tackiness are well known to those of ordinary skill in the art and are commercially available.
    </p>
    <p num="50">
      Alternatively, the pot bonding material 50 can be composed of a cohesive material.
      <br/>
      Since the cohesive is applied to only one of the inner peripheral surfaces (surface 28 as shown in FIG. 2A or 2B), the cohesive will not bond to the opposite surface (surface 30 in FIG. 2A or 2B) as long as there is no opposing cohesive material to which it can bond.
      <br/>
      In this version of the invention, in order for the inner peripheral surface 28 of the sleeve 10 to be bonded to a pot disposed therein, an area of cohesive material to which the pot bonding material 50 can cohere must be present on at least a portion of the outer surface of the pot (not shown).
      <br/>
      Once the pot is inserted into the sleeve, the areas of bonding material can be pressed together to bondingly connect the sleeve to the pot.

    <p num="51">
      In yet another version of the present invention, shown in FIGS. 12-15 of U.S. Ser. No. 08/237,078 which is incorporated by reference herein, a bonding material is disposed on a portion of the outer peripheral surface of the base portion of the sleeve 10.
      <br/>
      After the pot is disposed in the retaining space of the base portion, the sleeve 10 is manually or automatically crimped about the outer peripheral surface of the pot in the vicinity of the bonding material thereby forming overlapping folds in the base portion which are bondingly connected together by the bonding material to add structural integrity to the base portion of the sleeve and to cooperate to hold the base portion in the shape of a pot cover or for causing the base portion of the sleeve 10 to engage the outer peripheral surface of the pot and be held firmly thereabout.
      <br/>
      The bonding material may be disposed on the sleeve 10 at a position below the upper rim of the pot or may be disposed at a position on the base portion of the sleeve 10 above the upper rim of the pot such that the overlapping folds crimpingly formed are located in a position generally above the upper rim of the pot.

    <p num="52">
      A material can be disposed between the pot bonding material 50 and the inner peripheral surface 30 for preventing the adherence of the material 50 to the surface 30.
      <br/>
      Shown in FIGS. 3 and 4 is a sleeve 10a exactly like sleeve 10 except that a piece of release material 52 is disposed within the space 32 of the sleeve 10a wherein the release material 52 serves as a barrier between the pot bonding material 50 which is disposed on the inner peripheral surface 28 and the inner peripheral surface 30 thereby preventing the material 50 from bonding to the surface 30.
      <br/>
      The release material 52 is constructed of a material which will not adhere to the pot bonding material.
      <br/>
      Such release materials are well known to those of ordinary skill in the art and are available commercially.
    </p>
    <p num="53">
      During operation, when the sleeve 10a is opened in anticipation of disposing a pot therein, after opening, the release material 52 can be removed from the space 32 of the sleeve 10a prior to insertion of the pot therein.

      Shown in FIG. 6 is a sleeve 10c exactly like sleeve 10 except that in addition to having a bonding material 50 disposed on inner peripheral surface 28, the sleeve 10c also has an opposing bonding material 50a disposed on the inner peripheral surface 30.
      <br/>
      The bonding materials 50 and 50a are constructed of a material having low tackiness so that in the event the bonding material 50 adheres to the bonding material 50a, the sleeve 10c can still be easily opened for insertion of a pot.

      <br/>
      Sleeve 10h is shown as having four areas of bonding material 62a, 62b, 62c and 62d.
      <br/>
      The areas of bonding material 62a-62d are alternately positioned upon the inner surfaces 28 and 30 of the sleeve 10h as shown in FIG. 13 so that the bonding areas are staggered and so that if the sleeve 10h is flattened no area of bonding material will be pressed against another area of bonding material.
      <br/>
      The sleeve 10h can thus be more easily opened.
    </p>
    <p num="59">FIG. 14 shows a sleeve 10i which is exactly the same as sleeve 10h except that sleeve 10i has a piece of release material 52 inserted into the space 32 so that areas of bonding material 62a and 62c are separated from areas of bonding material 62b and 62d whereby the areas of bonding material 62a-d do not adhere to opposite inner surfaces of the sleeve.</p>

      <br/>
      In fact, it will be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art that the number of areas of bonding material of the inner peripheral surface and their shapes and arrangements on the sleeve can be varied.

      <br/>
      After a pot has been disposed within the sleeve 10k, the upper ends of the sleeve 10k can be pressed together, causing the bonding material 68 to adhere to a portion of the inner surface 28 to effect closure of the upper end 12 of the sleeve 10k.

      Disposed upon the upper end of the inner peripheral surface 30 of side 24 is a closure bonding material 68.
      <br/>
      After a pot is disposed within the sleeve 10m, the upper end portion of side 24 with closure bonding material 68 disposed thereon can be folded in a direction 70 onto an upper end portion of side 22 thereby sealing the upper portion of the sleeve 10m.

    <p num="64">
      Shown in FIG. 17C is a sleeve ion which is exactly the same as sleeve 10m except there is a second closure bonding material 72 which is disposed upon an upper end portion of side 22.
      <br/>
      When the upper end portion of side 24 having the closure bonding material 68 is folded over onto side 22, the closure bonding material 68 bondingly engages closure bonding material 72 thereby effecting a seal in the upper end 12 of sleeve 10n.
      <br/>
      Preferably, in this version, the closure bonding materials 68 and 72 are both cohesive materials so that when another sleeve ion is pressed against the sleeve, neither bonding material 68 nor 72 will cause the adjacent sleeves 10n to be connected to each other thereby facilitating the separation of sleeves ion from the batch.

      FIG. 32 shows a sleeve 10bb which is exactly like sleeve 10 except for the absence of a bonding material on the inner peripheral surface of the lower portion 38.
      <br/>
      Instead, sleeve 10bb comprises a tab 76 having a connected end 78 which is connected to a portion of the lower portion 38 and having a free end 80 which has a bonding material 82 disposed upon a portion thereof.
      <br/>
      The tab 76 functions to tighten the lower portion 38 about a pot disposed within the sleeve 10bb.

      Another version of the present invention shown in FIG. 35 is sleeve 10dd which has a first tab 94 having a free end 96 and a second tab 98 having a free end 100.

      Disposed upon a portion of the outer peripheral surface 16 is a bonding material 102 positioned adjacent the tabs 94 and 98.
      <br/>
      The tabs 94 and 98 can be used to tighten the sleeve 10dd about a pot in substantially the same manner as shown in FIG. 34 except that the tabs 94 and 98 are attached to the sleeve 10dd by pressing the free ends 96 and 100 of the tabs 94 and 98 respectively, against the bonding material 102.
      <br/>
      This scenario is shown in FIG. 36.

    <p num="78">
      FIG. 37 shows a cross-sectional view of a sleeve 10ee which is exactly the same as sleeve 10dd except a release material 104 is disposed over the bonding material 102 for preventing the bonding material 102 from inadvertently connecting to another object, such as another sleeve in a stack of sleeves.
      <br/>
      Shown in FIG. 38 is a sleeve 10ff having a bonding material 102 disposed upon a portion of the outer peripheral surface 16, a first tab 106 having a bonding material 108 thereon and a second tab 110 having a bonding material 112 thereon.
      <br/>
      In a preferred version of sleeve 10ff, the bonding materials 102, 108 and 112 are cohesive materials.
      <br/>
      Thus, when a pot is disposed within the sleeve 10ff the sleeve 10ff can be tightened about the pot by cinching the tab 106 and bondingly connecting bonding material 108 to bonding material 102 and cinching tab 110 and bondingly connecting bonding material 112 to bonding material 102 resulting in a sleeve appearing exactly the same as sleeve 10dd in FIG. 36 as discussed above.
      <br/>
      The advantage in the bonding materials 102, 108 and 112 being cohesive lies in the lack of bonding which will occur between sleeves 10ff when placed in a stack.
    </p>
    <p num="79">Preferably, the sleeves described in FIGS. 32-38 are characterized in that they are substantially without preformed creases, folds, or score lines in the outer peripheral surfaces thereof, except along the sides 18 and 20 of the sleeve, or in the lower end of the sleeve in those versions where the lower end is sealed or closed.</p>
    <p num="80">Said absence of preformed score lines, creases or folds benefits application of the sleeve about the pot in that it allows folds to be formed in positions in the sleeve other than those predetermined by the preformed lines or creases and does not necessarily cause folds to be formed in non-preferred positions in the sleeve.</p>
    <p num="81">Construction of the Sleeves--FIGS. 39-44</p>
    <p num="82">
      It will be readily appreciated by those of ordinary skill in the art that processes for making standard floral sleeves which have open upper and lower ends are well known.
      <br/>
      In the preferred embodiment of the present invention, the sleeve is constructed with a closed bottom which may simply comprise a seal along the lower end of the sleeve or more preferably the closed bottom comprises an infolded portion such as a gusset which when opened enables expansion of the bottom of the sleeve for allowing insertion of a pot therein.
    </p>
    <p num="83">
      One version of the apparatus and process used to construct a sleeve as described herein is shown in FIG. 39. A single web of material 130 from a roll 131 is fed by drive means such as an electric motor (not shown) to a folding assembly 132 which causes the web 130 to fold and double up on itself to form a folded web 134 having an open side 136 and a folded side 138.
      <br/>
      The folded web 134 is supported upon a conveyor or other support surface 140.
      <br/>
      As the folded web 134 is advanced by drive rollers 141 or other advancing means in direction 142, the folded side 138 is caused in a continuous process to be infolded or pouched by an infolding device 144 forming a pouch 146 which extends the length of the web 134.
      <br/>
      The web 134 with the pouch 146 therein continues to be advanced in direction 142 to a sealing position 148.
      <br/>
      A sealing bar (not shown) such as is common in the art is then activated forming a pair of sealed edges 150 and 152.
      <br/>
      The sealed edges 150 and 152 extend from the pouch 146 to the open side 136 and form a sealed bottom or gusset 154.
    </p>
    <p num="84">
      The web 134, now having a sleeve outlined by the sealed edges 150 and 152, is further advanced to a perforating position 155 where perforations 156 are punched into the sleeve and optionally support apertures 158 are also punched into the sleeve for enabling a collection of sleeves to be collected in a stack and held on a support mechanism such as a wicket.
      <br/>
      Ventilation holes may also be punched into the sleeve at this point.
      <br/>
      In the next step the sleeve, now with sealed edges 150 and 152 and with perforations 156, is advanced to a cutting position 159 where the sleeve is cut by a cutting die or blade (not shown), which is well known in the art, from the web 134 to form a completed sleeve 160.
      <br/>
      Excess material 162 may be removed to facilitate removal and storage of the sleeve 160.
      <br/>
      It will be understood by one of ordinary skill in the art that the steps of sealing, perforating and cutting the sleeves may be performed together in a single step, or two steps at one or two positions.
    </p>
    <p num="85">
      The process outlined above describes the construction of a sleeve 160 without a bonding material disposed upon any portion thereof.
      <br/>
      However, as explained above, in a preferred version of the invention, a bonding material for bonding a portion of the sleeve to a pot is located on a portion of the inner surface of the sleeve.
      <br/>
      Shown in FIG. 39 is a bonding material applicator 164 such as a sprayer or pad applicator which can be used to apply an area of bonding material 166 to a portion of the inner surface of a sleeve.
      <br/>
      The bonding material applicator 164 may be reciprocatingly activated by a reciprocating assembly (now shown) which is preferably automatically controlled and construction of which is well within the level of ordinary skill in the art.
      <br/>
      The bonding material 166 is preferably applied to the web 130 prior to the doubling over of the web 130 so that when the web 130 is doubled over to form the folded web 134, the bonding material 166 is oriented on a portion of the inner surface of the sleeve 160, preferably in the lower portion of the sleeve 160.
      <br/>
      The result is the production of a sleeve like sleeve 10 in FIG. 2.
    </p>
    <p num="86">
      The process described herein can be modified to produce sleeves such as any of the other sleeves described elsewhere herein.
      <br/>
      For example, a sleeve such as sleeve 10a in FIG. 3 can be produced by inserting a piece of release material 52 into the sleeve 10a at some point during the sleeve production process, either manually or automatically, for example, after the bonding material 166 has been applied but before the web 130 has been folded over to form the folded web 134.
      <br/>
      The piece of release material 52 may be inserted manually by hand or automatically using a device which automatically shoots or blows or deposits such pieces of material and which is well within the skill of one of ordinary skill in the art.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, the release material may be applied directly upon the bonding material 166 when the bonding material 166 is applied to the web 130, ultimately resulting in a sleeve such as sleeve lob shown in FIG. 5.
      <br/>
      An additional area of bonding material may be applied to another portion of the web with another adhesive applicator (not shown) thereby forming sleeves such as the sleeves shown in FIGS. 6-10, 13, 14 and 16A-17C.
    </p>
    <p num="87">
      FIG. 39 shows both edges of open side 136 of the web 134 as being an equal distance from the folded side 138.
      <br/>
      It will be understood by one of ordinary skill in the art that the two edges which comprise the open side 136 of the web 134 can be offset during the folding process to form a sleeve such as sleeve 10m or 10n in FIGS. 17A and 17B having an upper end flap which can be folded over to close the upper end of the sleeve.
    </p>
    <p num="88">
      FIG. 39 shows a sleeve-forming process in which a single web is doubled over to form the double-layered web.
      <br/>
      The sleeve formed as described herein may also be formed during a process using two or more separate webs as shown in FIG. 40. FIG. 40 shows a first roll of material 170 and a second roll of material 172 from which are unrolled a first web of material 174 and a second web of material 176, respectively.
      <br/>
      These webs 174 and 176 are fed in direction 178 to a position where one side of the two webs 174 and 176 are sealed by a sealing assembly 180.
      <br/>
      If a gusset in the finished sleeve is desired, the sealed side can be infolded to form a pouched side as described in the process of FIG. 39. The remainder of the operation can be formed as described above for the process of FIG. 39.
    </p>
    <p num="89">
      Sleeves formed in accordance with the present invention can also be formed from tubular materials such as are commercially available.
      <br/>
      For example, a sleeve such as sleeve 10s in FIG. 23 can be formed by cutting a portion of a tube, forming a gusset in the lower end of the tube, or sealing the lower end of the tube to form a closed bottom, then sealing and cutting off portions of the lower end of the tube forming a sleeve having a tapered lower end.
      <br/>
      Adhesive may be applied to an interior portion of the sleeve by opening the tube and spraying a bonding material onto a portion of the inner surface of the sleeve, for example.
      <br/>
      In another version of the invention, the process of forming the tubular material from one or more flat webs of material may comprise a step in the process of forming a sleeve.

      FIGS. 41-44 show other configurations of sleeves having sealed lower ends which can be formed.
      <br/>
      Shown in FIG. 41 is a process in which both sides 184 and 186 of the webs are sealed and sleeves 188 formed in the web are positioned in an alternating upward and downward orientation to maximize usage of the web material.
      <br/>
      The sleeve 10gg formed in this method, when severed from the web has an upper gusset 190 in the upper end and a lower gusset 192 and in the lower end of the sleeve and thus is initially closed at both the upper and lower ends.
      <br/>
      Therefore, after severing the sleeve 10gg from the web, the upper gusset 190 of the sleeve must be cut away from the sleeve 10gg to form an open end in the sleeve 10gg.
      <br/>
      This may be done, for example, after the sleeves have been stacked to save time.
      <br/>
      FIG. 42 shows another version of a sleeve 10hh having a different shape, formed in a manner similar to that for FIG. 41 wherein upper and lower gussets are formed during the sleeve forming process.
      <br/>
      FIGS. 43 and 44 show alternate versions of sleeves 10ii and 10jj, respectively, which may be formed in accordance with the present invention, wherein the lower end 194 and 196, respectively, of the sleeves shown in FIGS. 43 and 44 are heat sealed but not gussetted.
      <br/>
      It will be appreciated that all of the sleeves described in FIGS. 41-44 may comprise any of the sleeve embodiments discussed elsewhere herein.
      <br/>
      For example, perforations 200 are shown in sleeve 10jj.
