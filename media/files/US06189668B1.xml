      <br/>
      A gear pump mechanism shown in a variety of applications to control rotational output.
      <br/>
      Control of the output from the gear pump and feed to the gear pump of hydraulic fluid or oil can be controlled to establish conditions from free wheeling to fully locked.
      <br/>
      The gear pump includes a sun gear and planetary gears.
      <br/>
      The sun gear is attached to an output shaft while the planetary gears are rotatably mounted to the pump housing.
      <br/>
      Through rotation of the housing and control of the flow through the gear pump, relative rotation of the output shaft can be determined.
      <br/>
      Applications of rotational output control systems using the gear pump mechanism provide adjustable torque limiters, variable rate clutches, differentials, brakes, CVT transmissions, four wheel drive systems and forward and reverse variable rate clutches with no gear backlash.

    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">The field of the present invention is mechanisms for controlling and transmitting rotational motion and power.</p>
    <p num="3">
      Mechanisms for controlling rotational output using a fluid as a force transmitting means have been widely used as fluid couplings.
      <br/>
      Other designs are known where pumps generate fluid pressure and flow which is then converted to rotational output through fluid motors.
      <br/>
      Continuously variable ratios are even possible with some systems.

    <p num="4">
      A difficulty with the use of fluid for power transmission is that fluid flow can introduce substantial inefficiencies to such systems.
      <br/>
      Efforts have been made to reduce such losses by increasing the pressure with a corresponding decrease in flow rate.
      <br/>
      However, by increasing the pressure, leakage and/or cost can become a significant factor.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      Techniques are also known for mechanically locking up couplings once velocities across the coupling are matched.
      <br/>
      By augmenting the system with a mechanical lock, fluid losses can be greatly reduced.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      Gear pumps are also well known.
      <br/>
      Such pumps typically include a gear set.
      <br/>
      An inlet provides fluid in the area of the pinch where the gear wheels are separating.
      <br/>
      An outlet is provided to the other side of the pinch where the gear wheels are coming into engagement.
      <br/>
      Such pumps are frequently used for system lubrication and the like.

    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="7">The present invention is directed to mechanical systems for controlling the rotational output of a driving element and applications thereof.</p>
    <p num="8">
      Regarding the mechanical systems, a gear pump is employed with at least one gear set including at least one gear wheel mounted to the inlet and at least one gear wheel mounted to the outlet.
      <br/>
      A fluid circuit associated with the gear pump selectively controls flow from the output of the gear pump.
      <br/>
      With such control, the pump may be configured to be effectively locked up, disengaged, controlled by the fluid circuit to provide degrees of torque transfer between the input and the output and/or combinations thereof.
    </p>
    <p num="9">Accordingly, a first, separate aspect of the present invention is to provide a rotational output control system employing a gear pump and a fluid circuit with valve control of the fluid circuit to selectively lock the inlet and outlet together.</p>
    <p num="10">
      A second, separate aspect of the present invention is to provide a rotational output control system employing a gear pump and a fluid circuit with the fluid circuit including valving elements associated with each of the input and the output.
      <br/>
      In addition to locking up the device through closure of the output valve element, closure of the input valve element can starve the gear pump and effect an uncoupled system.
    </p>
    <p num="11">
      A third, separate aspect of the present invention is to provide a structure in association with either the first or the second aspect.
      <br/>
      The structure includes a housing having a body with a cavity open at one end and closed by a cap.
      <br/>
      One of the gear wheels of the gear pump is rotatably mounted to the housing while the other is fixed to a shaft.
    </p>
    <p num="12">
      In a fourth, separate aspect of the present invention, a rotational output control system is contemplated which has a gear pump and a fluid circuit contained within a housing.
      <br/>
      A gear wheel is associated with a shaft rotatably mounted relative to the housing.
      <br/>
      Multiple planetary gear wheels mesh with the gear wheel fixed to the shaft.
      <br/>
      Inlets and outlets are positioned adjacent each meshing point of the planetary gears with the gear wheel on the shaft.
    </p>
    <p num="13">Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide rotational output control systems using the fluid circuit control of gear pumps to define operation.</p>
    <p num="14">Regarding applications of the rotational output control systems, use of multiple such devices, special arrangements and attachments can provide a variety of useful devices and applications.</p>
    <p num="15">
      In a fifth, separate aspect of the present invention, a rotational output control system includes a plurality of gear pumps with one gear pump providing pressurized fluid to a plurality of gear pumps driven by the pressure.
      <br/>
      The driven pumps include one-way clutches.
      <br/>
      A fluid circuit includes valving to selectively close inputs to the driven pumps.
      <br/>
      A progressive ratio transmission is thus defined.
    </p>
    <p num="16">
      In a sixth, separate aspect of the present invention, attachment of the housing of a rotational output control system may provide utility.
      <br/>
      When fixed, a brake mechanism is provided.
      <br/>
      When rotationally mounted in a drive train, a clutch or limited slip mechanism results.
      <br/>
      When combined in a housing with a second rotational output control system and coupled by multiple gear sets, a forward/reverse variable speed clutch may be defined without backlash during reversal.
    </p>
    <p num="17">
      In a seventh, separate aspect of the present invention, the housings of multiple rotational output control systems may be combined to provide differential drive.
      <br/>
      A drive shaft may include one or more rotary clutches to selectively control axle shafts which can extend to wheel discs.
    </p>
    <p num="18">In a eighth, separate aspect of the present invention, rotational output control systems may replace complicated mechanisms for multi wheel drive control.</p>
    <p num="19">In a ninth, separate aspect of the present invention, rational combinations of the foregoing are contemplated.</p>
    <p num="20">
      Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide applications of a rotational output control system which can particularly use characteristics thereof to advantage.
      <br/>
      Other and further objects and advantages pertaining to such applications will appear hereinafter.

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
    <p num="22">
      Turning first to the variable rate clutch illustrated in FIGS. 1 through 10, a housing, generally designated 23 is illustrated as including a body 24 and a housing closure, generally designated 25.
      <br/>
      Bolts 26 retain the housing 23 together.
      <br/>
      Eight such bolts 26 are illustrated which extend through the housing closure 25 into the body 24.
      <br/>
      The body 24 includes a mounting flange 27 having mounting holes 28 equiangularly placed about the flange 27.
      <br/>
      The mounting flange 27 is for attachment to a rotatable drive, schematically illustrated at 30.
      <br/>
      The body 24 is substantially cylindrical to provide a cavity having an opening at one end.
      <br/>
      This opening is closed by the housing closure 25.
    </p>
    <p num="23">
      The housing closure 25 includes an annular rim 32 which is cylindrical to fit within the body 24.
      <br/>
      A central hub 34 includes a central opening 36 and extends outwardly to the annular rim 32.
      <br/>
      A circular flange 38 extends in the opposite direction to the annular rim 32 to define a bearing cavity 40.
      <br/>
      Extending from the central hub 34 in the same direction as the annular rim 32 is an inner sleeve 42.
      <br/>
      An annular reservoir 44 is thus defined between the annular rim 32 and the inner sleeve 42.
      <br/>
      The inner sleeve 42 provides an extension of the central opening 36 as well.
    </p>
    <p num="24">
      An output shaft 46 extends through the central opening 36 in the central hub 34 and the inner sleeve 42.
      <br/>
      The shaft 46 is rotatably mounted by a bearing 48 positioned within the bearing cavity 40.
      <br/>
      A bearing cover 50 closes the outward end of the bearing cavity 40.
      <br/>
      A journal cavity 52 is provided in the end wall of the body 24 to receive the end of the shaft 46.
      <br/>
      A carbide-graphite seal is positioned inwardly of the bearing 48 within the bearing cavity 40.
      <br/>
      The graphite ring 56 rotates with the shaft 46.
      <br/>
      The carbide ring 58 rotates with the central hub 34 of the housing closure 25.
    </p>
    <p num="25">
      A gear pump, generally designated 60, is positioned within the cavity of the body 24.
      <br/>
      The pump 60 includes a pump body defined by a body plate 62, an inlet side plate 64 and an outlet side plate 66.
      <br/>
      Each of the plates 62, 64 and 66 have a cylindrical periphery to fit closely within the interior wall of the body 24.
      <br/>
      The body plate 62 is best illustrated in FIG. 8.
      <br/>
      Adjoining circular cavities 68, 70 and 72 provide space for the gear wheels.
      <br/>
      The fit of the plates 62, 64 and 66 about the cavity 68, 70 and 72 is as precise as possible for commercial production so as to prevent flow bypass within the pump 60.
      <br/>
      The plates 64 and 66 are held against the body plate 62 in compression by the housing 23.
      <br/>
      An inner circular sleeve 74 and an outer circular step 76 extend from the end wall of the body 24 to form a support plane for the outlet side plate 66.
      <br/>
      An annular outlet reservoir 78 is defined therebetween.
      <br/>
      Similarly, the inner sleeve 42 and the annular rim 32 extend to the inlet side plate 64.
      <br/>
      The assembly bolts 26 compress the housing closure 25 into the body 24 which in turn compresses the plates 62, 64 and 66 together both at the outside periphery and at the inner diameter around the shaft 46.
    </p>
    <p num="26">
      The gear pump 60 includes a central gear wheel or sun gear 80 mounted to the shaft 46.
      <br/>
      The gear wheel 80 is fixed to the shaft 46 to rotate therewith.
      <br/>
      There are two outer gear wheels or planet gears 82 and 84 which are engaged with the central gear wheel 80.
      <br/>
      The outer gear wheels 82 and 84 are rotatably mounted to the housing 23 through the inlet side plate 64 and outlet side plate 66.
      <br/>
      Trunions 86 extend axially from the outer gear wheels 82 and 84 to journals 88 and 90 in the inlet side plate 64 and outlet side plate 66, respectively.
      <br/>
      The two outer gear wheels 82 and 84 are shown conveniently to be placed diametrically about the central gear wheel 80.
    </p>
    <p num="27">
      The fluid circuit of the clutch includes a gear pump inlet defined by two inlet passages 92 and 94.
      <br/>
      These inlet passages 92 and 94 extend through the inlet side plate 64 to adjacent the pinch areas between the central gear wheel 80 and the outer gear wheels 82 and 84, respectively.
      <br/>
      The inlet passages 92 and 94 are located to the side of the pinch areas where the gear teeth are disengaging from being meshed together as the gear wheels rotate.
    </p>
    <p num="28">
      A gear pump outlet includes two outlet passages 96 and 98.
      <br/>
      These outlet passages 96 and 98 pass outwardly through the outlet side plate 66 adjacent the pinch areas where the gear wheels are entering into meshing engagement.
      <br/>
      FIG. 8 also illustrates that some cavity space is provided for flow axially of the gear wheels at both sides of the pinch in the plate 62.
      <br/>
      These areas are in communication with either the inlet or outlet passages and form a part thereof.
      <br/>
      The gear pump outlet further includes the annular outlet reservoir 78 which is shown to have a fixed volume and, when filled with incompressible fluid, simply acts as a combined conduit or manifold as part of the outlet passages 96 and 98.
    </p>
    <p num="29">
      Further components of the gear pump outlet include two passages which extend through the pump body between the annular outlet reservoir 78 and the annular reservoir 44.
      <br/>
      These passages effectively form a further part of the outlet passages 96 and 98 and each include a hole 104 drilled normally through the body plate 62 and diagonal holes 106 and 108 extending through the outlet side plate 66, the inlet side plate 64, respectively, and partially through the body plate 62 into communication with the hole 104.
      <br/>
      Thus, the pump has a fluid circuit including the reservoir 44, the pump inlet including the inlet passages 92 and 94, the gear pump 60, the pump outlet including the outlet passages 96 and 98, the annular outlet reservoir 78, and the passages returning to the reservoir 44, in turn including the holes 104, 106 and 108.
    </p>
    <p num="30">
      Included as part of the fluid circuit in the reservoir 44 is a resiliently biased piston 110.
      <br/>
      This piston 110 is annular to accommodate the shape of the annular reservoir 44.
      <br/>
      The piston 110 is resiliently biased by springs 112 positioned uniformly about the housing closure 25, extending from cavities 114 to press against the piston 110.
      <br/>
      Seals are positioned around the inner and outer periphery of the piston 110 to prevent fluid from migrating to the back side of the piston.
      <br/>
      The resiliently biased piston 110 provides a small amount of pressure, two to three PSI is believed appropriate to insure proper operation of the fluid system.
      <br/>
      Rather than including a piston within the reservoir 44, a remote piston in a reservoir which is in communication with the annular reservoir 44 may also be employed.
      <br/>
      Further, rather than a piston, a compressible fluid or a fluid head may be used to create the appropriate pressure.
      <br/>
      Any of these mechanisms makes the reservoir variable volume.
    </p>
    <p num="31">
      Oil or hydraulic fluid is contemplated for the clutch.
      <br/>
      These fluids are incompressible.
      <br/>
      Considerations to the selection of the appropriate fluid and its viscosity include the amount of friction created as a result of viscosity, the need for lubrication, the amount of bypass flow resulting from lack of viscosity and the reaction to anticipated heat generated through use of the system.
    </p>
    <p num="32">
      A valve system controls the variable rate clutch in a range from complete disengagement to full engagement.
      <br/>
      The valve system is arranged within two bores 115 and 116.
      <br/>
      These bores 115 and 116 extend from one end of the housing through the housing closure 25 and into the body 24.
      <br/>
      Valve elements defined as piston control valves 117 and 118 control flow from the outlet of the gear pump.
      <br/>
      These valve elements 117 and 118 are positioned in the holes 104 forming part of the bores 115 and 116 and are slidably arranged such that they can move to completely uncover, partially cover or fully cover the diagonal holes 106.
      <br/>
      In doing so, the passages returning to the reservoir 44 can be controlled.
      <br/>
      It can be seen that the valve elements 117 and 118 have valve stems 120 and 122, respectively.
      <br/>
      The stems are of smaller cross section so that when the valve pistons 117 and 118 are displaced from the diagonal holes 106, flow can pass into the holes 104 and out through the diagonal holes 108.
      <br/>
      Thus, through manipulation of the valve pistons 117 and 118, control over the output of the gear pump 60 can be achieved.
    </p>
    <p num="33">
      The valve stems 120 and 122 are associated with sliding actuator elements 124 and 126, respectively.
      <br/>
      These elements are also linked with a block-off plate 128 employing two valve elements 130 and 132.
      <br/>
      The valve elements 130 and 132 are positioned over the inlet passages 92 and 94 extending through the inlet side plate 64, respectively.
      <br/>
      The block-off plate 128 is able to move with the sliding actuator elements 124 and 126 so as to extend to cover or withdraw to uncover the two inlet passages 92 and 94.
      <br/>
      As the valve elements 117 and 118 and the valve elements 130 and 132 are both associated with the sliding actuator elements 124 and 126, the gear pump inlet is open when the gear pump outlet is closed and visa versa.
      <br/>
      Gradations from those two extreme conditions are also available.
    </p>
    <p num="34">
      A valve actuator system is associated with the sliding actuator elements 124 and 126 and arranged substantially outwardly of the housing 23.
      <br/>
      A slide ring 134 is slidably arranged on the outer periphery of the circular flange 38 on the housing closure 25.
      <br/>
      As seen in FIG. 5, the slide ring 134 is fastened by screws 136 to the sliding actuator elements 124 and 126.
      <br/>
      The slide ring 134 is able to move axially relative to the housing 23 but is unable to rotate relative to the housing 23.
      <br/>
      A slide bearing 138 is positioned on the slide ring 134.
      <br/>
      A ring 140 is mounted to the outer periphery of the slide bearing 138.
      <br/>
      Thus, the ring 140 is able to move with the slide ring 134 axially and is able to rotate relative to the slide ring 134 because of the bearing 138.
      <br/>
      The ring 140 is mounted to a gimbal ring 142 by trunions 146.
      <br/>
      The gimbal ring 142 is in turn mounted to drivers 148 and 150 schematically illustrated in FIG. 5.
      <br/>
      These drivers may conveniently be solenoids which have two positions each.
      <br/>
      The drivers are fixed to the body of the vehicle or other device upon which the clutch is mounted.
      <br/>
      The drivers 148 and 150 are arranged such that they are equidistant between the trunions 146 to accommodate pivotal movement of the gimbal ring 142 relative to the ring 140.
    </p>
    <p num="35">
      Looking to the operation of this variable rate clutch as illustrated in FIGS. 1 through 10, the clutch housing 23 may be affixed to a flywheel 30 of an engine or other drive mechanism.
      <br/>
      Thus, the housing 23 rotates with the input.
      <br/>
      The output shaft 46 might be attached to an output drive line, drive shaft, pulley or the like to convey rotational power as needed.
      <br/>
      The valve actuator system includes the drivers 148 and 150 which are affixed to the supporting frame of a vehicle, stationary equipment or the like.
      <br/>
      Assuming the solenoid drivers 148 and 150 are off, the valve actuator system is pulled against the housing 23.
      <br/>
      In this state, the valve elements 117 and 118 are positioned to open the exhaust passages.
      <br/>
      Further, the valve elements 130 and 132 on the block-off plate 128 close off the inlet passages 92 and 94.
      <br/>
      With the valve system in this configuration, substantially all incompressible fluid is pumped out of the gear pump 60.
      <br/>
      The inlet is closed and the outlet is fully open.
      <br/>
      As there is a void generated by the pump, the volume required within the housing 23 is increased.
      <br/>
      This volume change is accommodated by the resiliently biased piston 110.
      <br/>
      The clutch becomes completely disengaged and very little torque is transferred to the output shaft 46.
    </p>
    <p num="36">
      With both solenoid drivers 148 and 150 activated, the valve actuator system moves the valve system into an orientation where the valve elements 117 and 118 fully close off the exhaust passages by closing the holes 104.
      <br/>
      Further, the block-off plate 128 is moved such that the valve elements 130 and 132 fully open the inlet passages 92 and 94.
      <br/>
      In this circumstance, a full supply of incompressible fluid is provided to the gear pump 60.
      <br/>
      At the same time, the output from the gear pump is fully closed.
      <br/>
      As a result, the gear pump 60 effectively stalls.
      <br/>
      The output shaft 46 is caused to rotate with the housing 23 with very little flow taking place and only then through leakage paths within the gear pump.
      <br/>
      The clutch is fully engaged.
    </p>
    <p num="37">
      An intermediate position of the clutch is also possible.
      <br/>
      This is presented through the activation of only one of the solenoid drivers 148 or 150.
      <br/>
      In this circumstance, the valve system is moved approximately one-half the full stroke length allowing partial flow from the output side of the gear pump 60.
      <br/>
      Some torque is, therefore, transmitted from the housing 23 through the gear pump 60 and to the output shaft 46.
      <br/>
      Naturally, more sophisticated drivers 148 and 150 can provide additional intermediate positions.
      <br/>
      Further, the configuration of the valve elements and the inlet and outlet passageways can be varied to alter and provide more control over the performance of the valving system.
    </p>
    <p num="38">
      The clutch assembly is constructed in a way to reduce bypass flow.
      <br/>

      A threaded plug 272 is positioned behind the spring 270 and may be threaded inwardly or outwardly to adjust the compression on the spring 270.
      <br/>
      The element 268 is positioned such that pressure from either side of the control passage 266 will lift the element 268 away from that pressure beyond a threshold amount determined by the spring 270.

      The pistons 274 are biased by springs 276.

      The pistons 274 are only able to move a certain distance before providing great resistance to further movement.

      In operation, the two-way torque limiter of FIG. 11 is symmetrical for driving in either direction.
      <br/>
      Assuming a rotation such that the forward direction makes the reservoir 212 the low pressure inlet reservoir and the reservoir 224 the high pressure outlet reservoir, flow will be drawn into the gear pump 246 through the passage 262 from the reservoir 212.
      <br/>
      The gear pump 246 will pump the incompressible fluid until the reservoir 224 is expanded to its maximum extent.
      <br/>
      As the valve element 268 is closed, a maximum pressure will be reached and the pump will effectively stall.
      <br/>
      As shock loadings or excessive torque are experienced by the drive train, the threshold pressure in the portion of the control passage 262 connecting the reservoir 224 with the valve element 268 will increase beyond the threshold defined by the compression within the spring 270.
      <br/>
      At this time, the valve element 268 will open and allow flow back to the reservoir 212 through the other side of the control passage 266.
      <br/>
      At this time, the pump will no longer be stalled and the housing 200 and shaft 236 are able to rotate relative to one another.

      Once the torque level drops, the valve element 268 closes.
      <br/>
      The gear pump 246 again stalls and the housing 200 rotates with the shaft 236.

      Naturally, with the axle running in the opposite direction, the passages 316 and 318 function in reverse.

    </p>
    <p num="52">
      The remainder of the fluid circuit includes passages 322 and 324 extending from the four-way valve 320 through a slide plate valve 326.

      Assuming the passage 324 is aligned with the passage 318 with the wheel 302 rotating counterclockwise as seen from the side illustrated in FIG. 14, the slide plate valve 326 is illustrated in a position where there is no braking, i.e., the gear pump 306 is being starved of fluid because the passage 324 is closed.
      <br/>
      At the same time, the passage 322 is open and communicates with the passage 316.
      <br/>
      Thus, flow is free to move out of the gear pump 306.
      <br/>
      It can be noted that the slide plate valve 326 has profile ports to achieve a desired braking response.
      <br/>
      As the valve 326 is moved to the right as best seen in FIG. 14, the inlet at the time, passage 324, begins to open.
      <br/>
      The outlet, passage 322 begins to close.
      <br/>
      In this way, fluid will build up in the gear pump 306 to create a back pressure in the pump.

      The complicated output valve arrangement includes a housing 450 and multiple gear pumps, generally designated 452, 454 and 456.

      <br/>
      The outlet passages 466 all extend to a valve shaft 468.
      <br/>
      The valve shaft 468 includes three annular passages 470, 472 and 474.
      <br/>
      The annular passages are each of different lengths and progressively open or close with longitudinal movement of the valve shaft 468.

      Radial outlet ports 476, 478 and 480 feed the gear pumps 452, 454 and 456.

      Finally, each of the sun gears 460 employs a Sprag clutch allowing one-way rotation relative to the shaft and rigid coupling against rotation in the opposite direction.

    <p num="61">
      In operation, the valve shaft 468 may be considered pulled to a location that all of the annular passages 470, 472 and 474 are open.

      This condition is illustrated in FIG. 17. At the same time, the valve plate 428 is closed over the intake passages 416.
      <br/>
      In this way, the gear pump 402 is starved for fluid and there is no back pressure through the outlet passages.
      <br/>
      The valve plate 428 on the inlet side of the gear pump 402 is opened.
      <br/>
      Consequently, flow begins to progress through the shaft 408 and drives all three gear pumps 452, 454 and 456.
      <br/>
      This provides a first, lower speed range of the shaft 408.

    <p num="62">
      The valve shaft 468 is then drawn longitudinally to close the passage 470.
      <br/>
      With this closure, the gear pump 452 is substantially locked.
      <br/>
      Because of the Sprag clutch associated with the sun gear 460, the shaft 408 is unimpeded in rotation.
      <br/>
      However, inlet flow to the gear pump 452 is terminated and each of the successive gear pumps 454 and 456 experiences increased flow from one-third of the total to one-half of the total flow from the gear pump 402.
      <br/>
      Consequently, the gear pumps 454 and 456 are driven faster.
      <br/>
      At the same time, back pressure to the gear pump 402 increases.
      <br/>
      Consequently, a new speed range is achieved for the output shaft 408.
      <br/>
      The process may be repeated with closure of the output from the gear pump 454.
      <br/>
      A further speed range 408 is achieved for the output shaft.
      <br/>
      Finally, with the closure of the annular passage 474, the gear pump 456 is stalled and flow no longer exits from the gear pump 402.
      <br/>
      At this time, the housing 400 and the shaft 408 have achieved direct drive.
      <br/>
      Naturally, to drop relative speed of the shaft 408, one or more of the gear pumps 452, 454 and 456 would be opened to allow communication through the annular passages associated with the valve shaft 468.

    <p num="69">
      The symmetry of the system provides for operation in either direction of rotation.
      <br/>
      The valve elements 560 and 562 operate the same through movement in opposite directions for opposite shaft rotations.
      <br/>
      Depending on the valve element placements and the rotational direction of the shaft 532, the intake to the gear pump is starved and adequate room is provided for the fluid to accumulate in the output side or the input side is fed and the output side is subjected to back pressure.
      <br/>
      These conditions define free wheeling and full engagement, respectively.

      In FIG. 23, a schematic view of a forward/reverse variable speed clutch is illustrated which is particularly contemplated for work vehicles experiencing frequent reversals of direction.

      A rotational output control system is illustrated that has a case 600.
      <br/>
      A direct clutch, generally designated 602 is rotatably mounted within the case 600.
      <br/>
      The direct clutch 602 includes a housing 604 and an output shaft 606.
      <br/>
      The output shaft 606 is rotatably mounted at the housing 604 and extends outwardly from one end thereof.
      <br/>
      A gear pump 608 is operatively positioned within the housing 604 and coupled between the housing 604 and the output shaft 606 as provided for in the prior embodiments.
      <br/>
      The pump 608 includes planetary gearwheels 610 rotatably mounted to the housing 604 and a sun gear 612 fixed to the output shaft 606.
    </p>
    <p num="72">
      A fluid circuit is associated with the direct clutch to include an inlet 614 and an outlet 616.
      <br/>
      A control valve assembly includes an output valve element 618 controlling the outlet 616.
      <br/>
      An input valve element as shown in the prior embodiments may also be employed.
      <br/>
      The output valve element controls engagement of the direct clutch 602 while the input valve element controls the ability to free wheel.
      <br/>
      Degrees of engagement may be achieved through intermediate positions of these elements.
    </p>
    <p num="73">
      A reverse clutch, generally designated 620 may be conveniently identical to the direct clutch 602.
      <br/>
      A repetitive recitation of the components of the reverse clutch 620 is believed superfluous and reference is simply made to the above disclosure of the direct clutch 602 with corresponding reference numbers applied.
      <br/>
      The reverse clutch 620 is also rotatably mounted within the case 600.
    </p>
    <p num="74">
      An input 622, most appropriately a power takeoff shaft, is coupled with the housing 604 of the direct clutch 602.
      <br/>
      A drive gear set is positioned about the housing 604 of the direct clutch 602 and the reverse clutch 620.
      <br/>
      This drive gear set includes a drive gear wheel 624 and a driven gear wheel 626.
      <br/>
      The gear wheels 624 and 626 are continuously engaged.
      <br/>
      Thus, power through the input 622 causes both the direct clutch 602 and the reverse clutch 620 to rotate.
    </p>
    <p num="75">
      A driven gear set is rotatably mounted relative to the case 600.
      <br/>
      A direct gear wheel 628 is associated with the output shaft 606 of the direct clutch 602.
      <br/>
      A reverse gear wheel 630 is fixed to rotate with the output shaft of the reverse clutch 620.
      <br/>
      An idler wheel 632 is located between the direct gear wheel 628 and the reverse gear wheel 630 and is in constant mesh with both.
      <br/>
      Finally, a drive shaft 634 is constrained to rotate with the direct gear wheel 628.
    </p>
    <p num="76">
      In operation, a forward/reverse variable speed clutch is defined by the foregoing rotational output control system.
      <br/>
      Control of the clutch is exercised through control of the fluid circuits to each of the gear pumps located within the two clutches 602 and 620.
      <br/>
      By locking the gear pump associated with the direct clutch 602, power proceeds directly from the input 622 through the clutch 602 to the drive shaft 634.
      <br/>
      At the same time, the input valve element in the reverse clutch 620 may be closed so that it is near free wheeling.
      <br/>
      Adjustments to the control valve of the direct clutch 602 provides the variability of partial disengagement.
    </p>
    <p num="77">
      To run in reverse, the reverse clutch 620 is locked and the direct clutch 602 is placed in the free wheeling mode.
      <br/>
      Power is then directed from the input 622 through the drive gear set to the reverse clutch 620.
      <br/>
      Power then passes through the driven gear set back to the direct gear wheel 628 and out the drive shaft 634.
      <br/>
      Through the various gears, rotation of the drive shaft 634 will be in reverse.
    </p>
    <p num="78">
      Because of the minimal drag developed by some fluid passing through the gear pump of the reverse clutch 620, minimal resistance to rotation of the direct gear wheel 628 is encountered during direct drive.
      <br/>
      When shifted to reverse drive, the driven gear set is already snug in the reverse drive direction.
      <br/>
      Consequently, backlash with harmful impact is avoided.
    </p>
    <p num="79">
      Turning to the embodiment of FIGS. 24 through 26, a four wheel drive vehicle is illustrated.
      <br/>
      A vehicle layout is illustrated in FIG. 24 having an engine 700, a transmission 702 with a rotatably mounted output shaft 704, four wheels 706 and passenger locations 708.
      <br/>
      The drive is presented in an X pattern as viewed from above.
    </p>
    <p num="80">
      Looking then to the details as provided in FIGS. 25 and 26, a first gear set includes a drive gear wheel 710 which is splined to rotate with the output shaft 704.
      <br/>
      This gear wheel 710 is illustrated to be a Cylkro.RTM. gear made by Crown Gear B.V. in Enschede, Holland.
      <br/>
      This type of gear wheel 710 may be paired with a spur gear wheel.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, a bevel gear set may be employed.
      <br/>
      There are two such driven gear wheels 712 associated with the drive gear wheel 710.
      <br/>
      The two driven gear wheels 712 are associated with two rotatably mounted clutches 714 and 716 which are arranged with axes nonparallel with the output shaft 704.
      <br/>
      At the other end of the output shaft 704, two additional rotatably mounted clutches 718 and 720 are arranged with a second drive gear wheel 722.
      <br/>
      The clutches 718 and 720 similarly include driven gear wheels 724 engaged with the gear wheel 722.
      <br/>
      The configuration as shown, illustrates that the clutches 714, 716, 718 and 720 are directed to each of the four wheels of the vehicle.
      <br/>
      Through rotation of the output shaft 704 under power from the engine 700, controlled rotational power may be directed through each of the clutches as may be desired.
    </p>
    <p num="81">
      The clutches illustrated and contemplated in the preferred embodiment may be taken from those illustrated in the prior embodiments as providing variable engagement.
      <br/>
      Electronic control of the valve elements associated with each clutch may ultimately provide optimum drive characteristics.
      <br/>
      However, even with no active control with all wheels engaged, closure of the output valve elements results in all clutch engagement.
      <br/>
      At the same time, individual drives can be overrun as fluid in the gear pump can flow in reverse where it may be received by an input reservoir.
      <br/>
      To provide some resistance to overrunning, pressurized input fluid to the clutches can resist reverse operation of the gear pumps.
      <br/>
      Mechanical systems based on torque or other controls are also contemplated.
    </p>
    <p num="82">
      Each clutch 714, 716, 718 and 720 is associated with an axle half-shaft 726.
      <br/>
      These half-shafts 726 are directed to the wheel assemblies such as illustrated in FIG. 26. Constant velocity joints 728 and 730 are located at either end of each of the axle half-shafts 726.
      <br/>
      Each wheel includes a wheel hub 732 which is rotatably mounted through an axle shaft 734.
      <br/>
      The axle shaft 734 is in turn mounted to the independent suspension 736.
      <br/>
      A driving shaft 738 again includes either a spur or bevel gear 740 engaged with Cylkro.RTM. or bevel gear 742.
    </p>
    <p num="83">
      The clutches 714, 716, 718 and 720 are represented in FIG. 27 by clutch 714.
      <br/>
      The clutch 714 includes a gear pump 744 within a housing 746.
      <br/>
      An inlet 748 to the housing is coupled with pressurized oil from the transmission 700.
      <br/>
      A control plunger 750 slides within the assembly and is controlled by a plunger activation arm 752 and a return spring 754.
      <br/>
      The control plunger 750 has a central passage 756 in communication with the inlet 748.
      <br/>
      The other end of the central passage 756 is in communication with an inlet 758 of the gear pump 744.
    </p>
    <p num="84">
      On the other side of the gear pump 744, an outlet 760 returns to the periphery of the control plunger 750.
      <br/>
      An outlet valve element 762 on the end of the control plunger 750 controls output flow from the gear pump 744 based on positioning of the control plunger 750.
      <br/>
      When the plunger 750 is depressed against the return spring 754, flow is permitted and the clutch 714 is disengaged.
    </p>
    <p num="85">
      The foregoing drive train provides for easy control with a minimum amount of equipment.
      <br/>
      Further, the half-shafts 726 are extremely long for the size of the vehicle.
      <br/>
      This allows for very substantial suspension travel which can greatly enhance the all terrain character of the vehicle.
      <br/>
      Further, ground clearance may be very high at the center of the vehicle.
    </p>
    <p num="86">
      Thus, a series of mechanisms are defined for controlling rotational output.
      <br/>
      While embodiments and applications of this invention have been shown and described, it would be apparent to those skilled in the art that many more modifications are possible without departing from the inventive concepts herein.
      <br/>
      The invention, therefore is not to be restricted except in the spirit of the appended claims.
