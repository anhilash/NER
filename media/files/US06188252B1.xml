    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">
      1.
      <br/>
      Field of the Invention
    </p>
    <p num="3">The present invention relates to a semiconductor integrated circuit having an oscillation circuit and, more particularly, to a horizontal oscillation circuit which can change the frequency of a horizontal sync signal over a wide range and is applied to a monitor or a television receiver.</p>
    <p num="4">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
    <p num="5">
      A PLL (Phase Locked Loop) circuit is used as a horizontal oscillation circuit in a monitor used for, e.g., a computer, or a television receiver.
      <br/>
      This PLL circuit has a voltage-controlled oscillator (to be referred to as a VCO hereinafter) for generating a clock signal having a frequency n (n is an integer) times higher than the frequency of a horizontal sync signal.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      Conventionally, the VCO is only required to generate clock signals of the same frequency.
      <br/>
      A recently developed monitor called a multi-scanning monitor can switch scanning speeds.
      <br/>
      The frequency of a horizontal sync signal supplied from a computer to a monitor of this type changes, for example, in the range of 20 kHz to 100 kHz.
      <br/>
      For this reason, a VCO applied to a horizontal oscillation circuit is required to be capable of oscillating over a wide range of the frequencies of horizontal sync signals.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      If one VCO is made to oscillate over a wide frequency range, the VCO requires a high oscillation gain.
      <br/>
      If a high gain is set, the frequency response speed increases, resulting in a deterioration in jitter characteristics.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      In order to solve this problem, a plurality of VCOs with different oscillation frequency ranges may be arranged such that the VCOs are switched to operate in accordance with the frequency of a horizontal sync signal.
      <br/>
      In this case, however, in addition to a plurality of VCOs, the oscillation circuit requires a frequency/voltage converter for generating a voltage corresponding to the frequency of a horizontal sync signal, resulting in an-undesirable increase in circuit size.
    </p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="9">It is an object of the present invention to provide a horizontal oscillation circuit which can prevent a deterioration in jitter characteristics by suppressing the oscillation gain of a VCO, and prevent an increase in circuit size.</p>
    <p num="10">In order to achieve the above object, there is provided a semiconductor integrated circuit having an oscillation circuit, comprising:</p>
    <p num="11">
      frequency detection means for detecting a frequency of a horizontal sync signal, the frequency detection means generating a switching signal in accordance with the detected frequency; and
      <br/>
      a voltage-controlled oscillator which has a plurality of oscillation modes obtained by dividing a frequency equal to an integer multiple of the frequency of the horizontal sync signal into a plurality of frequency ranges, and oscillates signals in the respective frequency ranges in accordance with control voltages, the oscillation modes of the voltage-controlled oscillator being switched in accordance with a switching signal output from the frequency detection means.
    </p>
    <p num="12">
      According to the present invention, signals in a wide frequency range can be oscillated by one voltage-controlled oscillator.
      <br/>
      In addition, since the frequency range in each oscillation mode of the voltage-controlled oscillator is narrow, the oscillation gain of the voltage-controlled oscillator can be decreased, and jitter can be reduced.
      <br/>
      Since the frequency detection circuit can be realized by a simple circuit, an increase in the overall circuit size can be suppressed.

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
    <p num="14">Embodiments of the present invention will be described below with reference to the accompanying drawings.</p>
    <p num="15">
      FIG. 1 shows the first embodiment of the present invention.
      <br/>
      Referring to FIG. 1, a PLL circuit 16 is constituted by a phase comparator 11, a loop filter 12 as a low-pass filter, a VCO 13, and a frequency divider 14.
      <br/>
      A horizontal sync signal fH output from, e.g., a computer (not shown) and having a frequency which changes over a wide range is supplied to the first input terminal of the phase comparator 11.
      <br/>
      A reference signal fr output from the frequency divider 14 and having almost the same frequency as that of the horizontal sync signal fH is supplied to the second input terminal of the phase comparator 11.
      <br/>
      The phase comparator 11 detects the phase difference between the horizontal sync signal fH and the reference signal fr.
      <br/>
      A signal corresponding to the detected phase difference is supplied to the loop filter 12.
      <br/>
      The loop filter 12 outputs a control voltage VL corresponding to the input signal.
      <br/>
      The control voltage VL is applied to the VCO 13.
      <br/>
      The VCO 13 generates a signal nfH in accordance with the control voltage VL applied from the loop filter 12.
      <br/>
      This signal nfH has a frequency n times (n is an integer) higher than the frequency of the horizontal sync signal fH.
      <br/>
      As will be described later, the VCO 13 has a plurality of oscillation modes obtained by dividing a wide frequency range into a plurality of ranges.
      <br/>
      The oscillation frequency range in each oscillation mode is set to be narrow to decrease the oscillation gain.
      <br/>
      The signal nfH output from the VCO 13 is supplied to a horizontal drive circuit (not shown) and the frequency divider 14.
      <br/>
      The frequency divider 14 frequency-divides the period of the input signal to 1/n so as to generate the reference signal fr.
    </p>
    <p num="16">
      The horizontal sync signal fH and a clock signal CL are supplied to a frequency detection circuit 15.
      <br/>
      As shown in FIG. 10, the frequency detection circuit 15 is constituted by a counter 15a for counting, e.g., clock signals CL, and a decoder 15b connected to the counter 15a.
      <br/>
      The counter 15a detects the frequency of the horizontal sync signal fH by counting clock signals CL in one period of the input horizontal sync signal fH, i.e., a 1-H interval.
      <br/>
      The decoder 15b outputs a mode switching signal MSn (n=1 to 4) for switching the oscillation modes of the VCO 13 in accordance with the detected frequency.
      <br/>
      In this case, the decoder 15b sets one of mode switching signals MS1 to MS4 at high level in accordance with the detected frequency.
    </p>
    <p num="17">
      The mode switching signals MSn are appropriately set in each embodiment described later.
      <br/>
      That is, the arrangement of the decoder 15b is changed in each embodiment.
      <br/>
      For example, at least one of the mode switching signals MS1 to MS4 can be set at high level or low level in accordance with the detected frequency.
      <br/>
      A decoder of this type can be realized by a known technique using a logic circuit.
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      FIG. 2 shows an example of the VCO 13.
      <br/>
      This VCO 13 is constituted by a ring oscillator 20 and a selector 21.
      <br/>
      The ring oscillator 20 comprises an odd number of series-connected inverter circuits 201 to 20n+1.
      <br/>
      The control voltage VL output from the loop filter 12 is applied to each of the inverter circuits 201 to 20n+1.
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      The output terminals of the inverter circuits 20n-5, 20n-3, 20n-1, and 20n+1 are connected to the input terminals of the selector 21.
      <br/>
      The mode switching signal MSn output from the frequency detection circuit 15 is supplied to the selector 21.
      <br/>
      The selector 21 selects one of output signals from the inverter circuits 20n-5, 20n-3, 20n-1, and 20n+1 in accordance with the mode switching signal MSn.
      <br/>
      That is, the selector 21 switches the numbers of inverter circuits constituting the ring oscillator 20 to switch the oscillation modes in accordance with the mode switching signal MSn.
      <br/>
      The output signal from the selector 21 is supplied to the input terminal of the first inverter circuit 201 of the selector 21.
      <br/>
      The oscillation modes of the VCO 13 are therefore switched in accordance with the mode switching signal MSn, and the signal nfH is output.
    </p>
    <p num="20">
      FIG. 3 shows the operation of the VCO 13.
      <br/>
      The oscillation modes of the VCO 13 are switched in accordance with the mode switching signals MS1 to MS4.
      <br/>
      In each oscillation mode, the VCO 13 oscillates at a predetermined frequency indicated by a solid line in accordance with the control voltage VL output from the loop filter 12.
    </p>
    <p num="21">
      FIG. 4 shows an inverter circuit as a part of the ring oscillator 20.
      <br/>
      A current path constituted by P-channel MOSFETs (to be referred to as PMOSs hereinafter) P1 and P2 and N-channel MOSFETs (to be referred to as NMOSs hereinafter) N1 and N2 is connected in series between a power supply Vdd and ground.
      <br/>
      The gates of the PMOSs P1 and P2 and the NMOSs N1 and N2 are commonly connected, and the node between the PMOS P2 and the NNOS N1 serves as an output terminal.
      <br/>
      PMOSs P3 and P4 are connected in parallel with the PMOS P1.
      <br/>
      The control voltage VL output from the loop filter 12 is applied to the gates of the PMOSs P3 and P4.
      <br/>
      The currents flowing in the PMOSs P3 and P4 change in accordance with the control voltage VL.

      The current flowing in the PMOS P1 therefore changes in accordance with the control voltage VL.
      <br/>
      That is, the dimension of the PMOS P1 is changed in accordance with the control voltage VL, and the oscillation frequency of the ring oscillator 20 is changed in accordance with this change in dimension.

    <p num="22">
      According to the above embodiment, the VCO 13 is constituted by the ring oscillator 20 having a plurality of inverter circuits connected in series, and switches the numbers of inverter circuits constituting the ring oscillator 20 in accordance with the frequency of the horizontal sync signal fH detected by the frequency detection circuit 15, thereby switching the oscillation modes.
      <br/>
      In each oscillation mode, the oscillation frequency of the VCO 13 is changed in accordance with the control voltage VL.
      <br/>
      Therefore, signals having frequencies in a wide range can be oscillated by using one VCO 13.
      <br/>
      In addition, as indicated by the solid lines in FIG. 3, the frequency ranges in the respective oscillation modes are narrow.
      <br/>
      For this reason, the oscillation gain of the VCO 13 can be decreased as compared with the case wherein the frequency range is wide as indicated by the dotted line in FIG. 3, and hence jitter can be reduced.
    </p>
    <p num="23">
      Furthermore, a plurality of VCOs are not required but only the VCO 13 is required, unlike the conventional oscillation circuit.
      <br/>
      In addition, since a frequency detection circuit can be realized by a simple circuit, the circuit size is smaller than that of a conventional frequency/voltage converter.
      <br/>
      An increase in the overall circuit size can therefore be suppressed.

      The flip-flop circuit 61d is reset by the signal D1.

    <p num="45">
      According to this embodiment, oscillation modes can be digitally set.
      <br/>
      In addition, by delaying a mode switching signal output from the frequency detection circuit 15 by a predetermined period of time using the first and second timers 61 and 62, a time difference can be set between the timing at which the oscillation frequencies of the VCO 13 are switched and the timing at which the capacitances of the capacitor in the horizontal drive circuit 64 are switched, when the frequency of a horizontal sync signal is switched.
