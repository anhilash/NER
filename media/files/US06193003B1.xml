      <br/>
      The device is a portable tractor with attachments for powering skiers, skaters, snowboarders, and the like.
      <br/>
      It employs a rigid pole to deliver the thrust to a belt which converts the thrust to a pull on the skier's lower back, leaving the skier's arms, hands, legs and feet free to perform their usual skiing functions.
      <br/>
      The pole also provides leverage to turn the tractor so that it follows the skier's movements.
      <br/>
      The device provides controls over the tractor's engine to the skier's hands, or to other parts of the skier's body.
      <br/>
      The tractor has crawler treads bearing retractable cleats which automatically convert into sled runners so the skier can travel downhill pulling the tractor without dismounting the tractor.
      <br/>
      The tractor can be folded up and transported by backpack.
      <br/>
      Various attachments enable use of the tractor to power skates, sleds, snowboards and similar vehicles.

    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <heading>MORE DETAILED BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">A key task in the development of power devices for skiers is to allow the skier maximum degrees of freedom to control the skis while delivering efficient driving thrust.</p>
    <p num="3">
      The shifting of a skier's weight and posture comprise a principal means of controlling skis.
      <br/>
      It follows that the skier's control task is complicated, and control likely is impaired, to the extent that the operational requirements of a driving device limit the skier's posture and balance on the skis or limit the motion of the skis themselves.
      <br/>
      Of course, any driving device, by adding a new force into the skier's balancing task, necessarily complicates that task to some degree.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      Where the driving thrust is directly applied to the skis themselves, the connection between the skis and the tractor necessarily limits the degrees of freedom of the skis, to the detriment of control.
      <br/>
      There is, of course, an advantage to driving the skis directly because this can reduce the stress on the skier's legs which otherwise are required to transmit the power to drive the skis uphill.
      <br/>
      The instant invention avoids direct drive on the skis, thereby leaving greater freedom of movement to the skis and greater potential control of the skis to the skier, but at the price of some additional stress on the skier's legs to transmit the power to the skis.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      Where the driving thrust is applied to the body of the skier, that necessarily limits the degrees of freedom in the skier's posture and muscular control.
      <br/>
      This problem can be better illustrated by reference to some existing devices to power skiers.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      For example, in the device of Mehne, U.S. Pat. No. 3,826,323, the driving thrust is delivered through rigid frame against the skier's buttocks and requires that the skier shift some body weight away from the skis onto the driving tractor.
      <br/>
      These requirements tend to limit or confine the skier's posture on the skis, thus reducing the degrees of freedom available to the skier's body to control the skis.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      Mehne's device patented in 1974 shows an apparently rigid frame 7 which delivers thrust from a tracked tractor to the buttocks of the skier when the skier rests a portion, but not all, of his body weight onto frame 7.
      <br/>
      Frame 7, when used to drive the skier, is secured in position on the skier's buttocks by a belt 12.
      <br/>
      Frame 7 also is adapted to serve as a backpacking frame to carry the tractor when not in use.
      <br/>
      Mehne discloses that the proportion of the skier's weight which rests upon the tractor, through frame 7, is critical to efficient operation of the tractor.
      <br/>
      This is because the Mehne device alone, without some of the skier's weight, lacked sufficient traction.
      <br/>
      However, Mehne discloses that if the skier rests too much body weight on the Mehne device it requires an excessively heavy engine to achieve adequate speed.
      <br/>
      Mehne's device also includes straps 27 and 28 which attach the skier's ankles or boots to the tractor, for the purpose of limiting the separation between the skis and the tractor.
      <br/>
      Mehne's straps further limit the skier's freedom of movement.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      In Allisio's device, as depicted in U.S. Pat. No. 4,519,470, the skier is delivered dual power thrust from both (A) the driven skis and also (B) rigid "ski sticks" (which apparently are the skier's own ski poles) that extend from the tractor between the skier's legs and bear a "seat" 35 which drives against the back of the skier's thighs.
      <br/>
      Allisio's "ski sticks" 37 are clipped together with a handle 4, and the tips of the ski sticks are inserted into a plate 39 to form a "rigid connection" to the crawler tractor.
      <br/>
      At the same time the tractor also drives the skis directly through plates 16 on the rear end of the skis which connect to plates 19 on an `articulated connection` 15 to the tractor.
      <br/>
      It is apparent that adjusting these dual power thrusts on both the skier's thighs and on the skis may be critical to the skier's own balance, hence to control of the skis.
      <br/>
      It also appears that balancing these dual thrusts on the skier's thighs and the skis must to some extent dictate, and confine, the skier's posture on the skis.
      <br/>
      The skier's balancing task is further complicated by Allisio's disclosure that "a large part of the skier's weight acts on the self-propelled unit".
      <br/>
      Allisio Specification, Column 1, line 25.
      <br/>
      It appears, therefore, not only that the adjustment of the seat 35, relative to the tractor's driving connection to the skis, may be critical, but also that the skier's balancing of body weight between the seat 35 and the skier's feet on the skis may be critical.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      In the Allisio device, the use of dual thrusts on both the skier'Is thighs and on the skis may be viewed as disadvantageous to the extent that it complicates a skier's balance on the skis by confining the skier's posture and compelling weight-shifting, while simultaneously also limiting the degrees of freedom of the skis themselves by the power thrust through a connection to the ski tails.
      <br/>
      In addition, the Allisio device requires use of the skier's hands on the handle 4 and deprives the skier of the normal uses of the hands and ski poles for balance and control.

    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="17">
      The invention has several aspects.
      <br/>
      One aspect is comprised of a rigid pole and belt configured to deliver power to the body of a skier to move the skier uphill, while leaving the skier's hands free to use ski poles and the skier's feet and legs free to balance upon and control the skis.
      <br/>
      Modifications adapt the invention to power persons riding on snow boards, skates, skate boards, or equivalent devices.
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      Another aspect of the invention comprises hinged cleats on a crawler-type tractor, adapted to power skiers.
      <br/>
      The cleats engage the travelling surface when the tractor's forward motion is driven by the rotation of the treads, but the cleats fold back, disengage from the travelling surface and form a sliding surface when the tractor's forward motion is faster than the rotation of the treads.
      <br/>
      Thus, the cleats automatically engage when the treads are the driving force, as when travelling uphill or on the flat, but disengage, turning the tractor treads into sled runners so that the skier can ski downhill pulling the tractor.
      <br/>
      The cleats of the invention thus eliminate the necessity to dismount the tractor, fold it into a backpack, and carry it down slope on the skier's back.
      <br/>
      Of course, the tractor still can be folded into a backpack and carried when desired.
      <br/>
      A similar mechanism which allows a wheeled tractor's driving wheels to `freewheel` downhill can be employed where a wheeled tractor is used to power a person on skates.
    </p>
    <p num="19">OBJECTIVES, FEATURES AND ADVANTAGES OF THE INVENTION</p>
    <p num="20">
      An objective of the invention is to deliver motive power from a tractor to a skier while leaving the skier's hands, feet and legs with freedom to control the skier's balance and the skis.
      <br/>
      It is a feature of the invention that it delivers motive power to a skier from a tractor without any connections delivering motive power from the tractor directly to the skis, or to the skier's hands, feet or legs, thus leaving them more available for use to control the skier's balance and the skis.
      <br/>
      An advantage of the instant invention is that it allows the skier to use hands and ski poles, though at least one hand does have the additional task of manipulating tractor engine controls supplied to the skier's hand(s) through one or more flexible wires or cables.
      <br/>
      In principle, the tractor also could be radio controlled through controls supplied to the skier's hands.
    </p>
    <p num="21">
      A further challenge in delivering motive power to a skier's body is to transmit the motive force to propel the body while minimizing interference with the skier's normal skiing motions.
      <br/>
      Among other things, this tends to retain a larger degree of the sense of `free` skiing, as distinguished from passively riding a powered vehicle.
      <br/>
      The instant invention transmits a single pulling force through a flexible, rotatable connection between the driving pole and the focal point of the pulling force on the skier's body.
      <br/>
      This permits the skier some ability to rotate or swivel about the connection to the power pole.
      <br/>
      The focus of the pulling force on the skier's body preferably is at the lower back, waist or buttocks, which places the force pulling force near the skier's hip joints and near the center of gravity of the skier's body.
      <br/>
      Delivery of the pulling force at this point leaves the skier's body relatively free to rotate about the focal point of the pulling force, in a plane perpendicular to the pulling force.
      <br/>
      The flexible, rotatable connection of the pulling force to the skier's body also permits some freedom to swing from side to side, or up and down, relative to the rigid pole which delivers the pulling force.
      <br/>
      The focal point of the pulling force can be adjusted to some extent on the skier's body, according to the skier's preference.
      <br/>
      Thus, the instant invention allows the skier relatively great freedom to engage in many `normal` or habitual skiing motions with minimal interference from the pulling force imposed at or near the skier's hips or waist.
    </p>
    <p num="22">
      A further feature of the invention is that the rigid pole or other structure which delivers the driving thrust from the tractor to the connection to the skier's belt also acts as a lever which transmits the skier's turning motions to the front of the tractor.
      <br/>
      The pole thus urges the tractor to turn following the skier's hips.
      <br/>
      In effect, the tractor tends to simply follow the skier under the urging of the rigid pole.
      <br/>
      This turning control over the tractor is particularly enhanced in the configuration where the skier is astride the rigid pole so that the skier's thighs apply the turning force directly to the pole.
      <br/>
      Of course, this turning leverage can be readily increased by simply increasing the length of the pole, and the length of the pole can be made adjustable to give a skier individualized control over the amount of this leverage.
    </p>
    <p num="23">
      Another challenge in the development of powered skiing is to keep the driving tractor and the thrust delivery system sufficiently light and compact to be comfortably portable.
      <br/>
      Note that both the Mehne and Allisio devices are designed to fold onto backpacking frames to be carried by the skier.
      <br/>
      Both Mehne and Allisio depict the skier as carrying the tractor in a backpack when skiing down hill.
      <br/>
      It is desirable to avoid having to pack up the tractor unit and carry it downhill, and particularly so where travel is overland, with a mixture of uphill and downhill terrain.
    </p>
    <p num="24">
      An objective of the invention is to enable the skier to travel downhill, as well as uphill, without dismounting the driving connection between the skier and the tractor.
      <br/>
      A feature of one species of the invention is hinged cleats on the treads of a crawler tractor, such that the cleats disengage from the travelling surface and become sled runners when the tractor's forward motion is faster relative to the travelling surface than is the rotation of the tractor's treads.
      <br/>
      The advantage is that the cleats engage the travelling surface when driven under the power of the tractor in uphill or flat conditions, but the cleats disengage so that the tractor treads turn into sled runners when travelling downhill.
      <br/>
      The skier has influence over this cleat-disengagement effect because the tractor has a centrifugal clutch.
      <br/>
      Engine controls are supplied to the skier's hand(s) through one or more cables so the skier can disengage the centrifugal clutch by reducing the engine speed, thereby slowing the tractor tread revolution and allowing the tractor's forward speed to retract the cleats.
      <br/>
      This allows the skier to ski downhill pulling the tractor on sled runners rather than having to dismount the tractor and carry it downhill.
    </p>
    <p num="25">
      Another species of the current invention connects the engine controls to the skier's shoulders or other upper body so that the skier can activate the engine controls by leaning away from or towards the tractor.
      <br/>
      For example, the controls can be set up so that if the skier leans or crouches forward, away from the tractor, the engine throttle is advanced, speeding up the engine, while if the skier leans back, or stands up out of the crouch, the engine is slowed.
      <br/>
      This provides the skier with hands-free control of the engine speed.
    </p>
    <heading>DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
    <p num="26">
      One aspect of the invention is an improved thrust-delivery system for powering skiers, which allows a high degree of freedom to the skier.
      <br/>
      The sole thrust is delivered through a rigid drive pole 8 which passes between the skier's legs and which is flexibly, rotatably connected at the skier's front to a belt worn about the skier's waist or lower back.
      <br/>
      The skier thus is drawn forward by the pull of the guide pole through the flexible, rotatable connection against the belt, with the pole being pushed by a tractor from behind the skier.
      <br/>
      The belt, when combined with harness straps over the shoulders, can be adjusted to deliver the pull from the drive pole over a wide range of positions on the skier's body, from thighs up through mid-back.
      <br/>
      The belt usually is adjusted to focus the pull on the skier's waist or lower back, thus leaving greater degrees of freedom to maneuver hips, legs and feet to control the skis.
      <br/>
      The skier's hands remain free to use ski poles, while controls for the tractor are provided to the skier's hands through flexible wires or cables.
      <br/>
      There is no direct connection between the driving tractor and the skis so that control of the skis comes entirely through the skier's feet.
      <br/>
      This configuration leaves more degrees of freedom for the skier to shift his weight and balance to control the skis and to employ ski poles.
      <br/>
      Persons knowledgeable in the art will perceive that the belt harness can be adjusted by the skier to the best lancing posture for the particular skier's needs and skiing style.
      <br/>
      The length of the drive pole, and the shape of the tab which connects the pole to the belt worn by the skier, also can be adjusted, thereby altering the vector of the force delivered by the drive pole to the belt.
      <br/>
      This adjustment is significant because angle of the drive pole relative to the ground determines, in part, the size of the vertical component of the force which the drive pole imposes downward on the front of the driving tractor.
      <br/>
      This downward component of force is important to the traction and efficiency of the driving tractor.
      <br/>
      Note, for example, that both the Mehne and Allisio devices require such a downward component of force on the driving tractor for it to perform properly.
      <br/>
      Persons having skill in the art will perceive that the drive pole passing between the skier's legs as depicted in the drawings could be replaced by a structure which curves around one or both of the skier's sides, rather than between the skier's legs, to produce equivalent results.
    </p>
    <p num="27">
      In another aspect of the invention, the cleats on the tractor's driving treads are hinged so that when the tractor is not moving forward faster than the treads are revolving, the cleats grip into the snow.
      <br/>
      However, when the tractor is moving forward faster than the treads are revolving the tread cleats automatically rotate backwards, retracting to convert the treads to a smooth sliding surface.
      <br/>
      Thus, when the tractor is moving forward faster than its own treads are revolving, the tractor treads act as sled runners.
      <br/>
      With this improvement, the tractor can be towed downhill by the skier and thus does not need to be dismounted, packed up, and carried downhill on the skier's back.
      <br/>
      The instant invention also can be folded into a backpack and carried on the skier's back when desired.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, the tractor's retractable cleats permit the skier and the deployed tractor to be towed by some other power source which moves faster than the tractor treads revolve under the tractor's own power.
    </p>
    <p num="28">
      In other aspects of the instant invention, it can be modified to power skaters, snow-boarders, and sleds as depicted in the drawings.
      <br/>
      In one version, the tractor is equipped with a lightweight, inflatable sled which can be carried in a pack and deployed as needed.
      <br/>
      The user thus could employ the tractor in an emergency to transport an injured person, or could transport other objects.
    </p>
    <p num="29">Of course, the energy source for the tractor's engine could be combustion, electric batteries, or other energy source.</p>

      Power pole length can be adjusted or the pole can be dismantled by loosening adjustment clamp 12.
      <br/>
      The skier rides astride the power pole over the padded saddle 15 with his belt harness 13 attached to the end of the power pole at eyelet 14 with a quick release clip 16.
      <br/>

      Referring to FIGS. 5, 6, 6A, 6B and, 6C, the chain drive system 7 (FIG. 5) having a centrifugal clutch 7A, drives tracks 5 and 6.
      <br/>
      Each track consisting of a drive belt 21 and a series of hinging snow cleats 22.
      <br/>
      When under power belt 21 rotates in a clockwise direction moving the hinging snow cleats 22 around frame 4, as it moves from the open top of frame 4 it will contact the closed frame bottom at point 4A which will push against stop/support 27 causing the bite leaf 26 to rotate on axis pin 25 to an extended position (FIG. 6B) catching the snow and power the unit forward (power mode).
      <br/>
      As long as bite leaf 26 is under frame 4 (in the power mode), hinge stop 27 will bear on the bottom of frame 4 to support the bite leaf 26 in an extend position pushing against the snow.
      <br/>
      As the belt rotation reaches point 4B there is no longer support for hinge stop 27 and the pressure of the snow will force the stop through belt opening 28 and the bite leaf will rotate to a closed position.
      <br/>
      This allows folded cleat 22 to pass under frame section 3 (FIG. 6A.) . When the system is not under power and belt 21 is no longer moving (FIG. 6A) the forward momentum of the power unit 1 over the snow 30 will force bite leaf 26 to swing to an open position allowing the snow 30 to move uninhibited under cleats 22, putting the system into a sled mode.
      <br/>
      When in a sled mode, a skier can ski down a slope in a normal fashion controlling the power unit's direction with the power pole 8 with no resistance from the snow cleats 22.
      <br/>
      When the power is reapplied the rotation of belt 21 over the snow 30 forces the bite leaf 26 to return to an extended supported position pushing the system forward in a power mode (FIG. 6B) . The skier can then power up the next slope.
