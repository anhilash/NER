    <p num="7">
      The liquid reservoir may be disposed within a housing having a cylindrical shape and composed of a plastic material having a red color so that the housing resembles a fire extinguisher.
      <br/>
      The piece of candy may be provided with a hot flavor so that the potable liquid may be sprayed from the liquid reservoir into the mouth of the person to cool the person's mouth after the hot-flavored piece of candy has been tasted by the person.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      The spray mechanism may be designed to spray the potable liquid from the liquid reservoir into the mouth of the person when the spray mechanism is spaced at least about six inches from the mouth of the person, and the spray mechanism may be positioned and designed to spray the liquid directly into the mouth of the person via a spray path that does not pass through the piece of candy.
      <br/>
      The spray mechanism may include a trigger pivotably attached to the housing of the device so that depression of the trigger causes the liquid to be sprayed.
    </p>
    <p num="9">The apparatus may also be provided with a stopper associated with a hole formed in the housing, the stopper being movable between a first position in which the stopper plugs the hole formed in the housing to prevent the liquid from leaking out of the liquid reservoir and the stopper being movable to a second position in which additional potable liquid may be added to the liquid reservoir through the hole in the housing.</p>

    <p num="16">
      FIG. 4 illustrates a fourth embodiment of a candy-holding and liquid-dispensing apparatus 70 in accordance with the invention.
      <br/>
      Referring to FIG. 4, the apparatus 70 has a housing 72 in which a liquid reservoir 74 (FIG. 8) is disposed.
      <br/>
      The housing 72 is cylindrically shaped to resemble a fire extinguisher.
      <br/>
      The housing 72 may be composed of a red-colored plastic material.
      <br/>
      A trigger-and-nozzle assembly 76 is disposed on top of the housing 72.
      <br/>
      The assembly 76 may also be composed of a plastic material, and may be gray in color to contrast with the red housing 72.
    </p>
    <p num="17">
      The assembly 76 is provided with a trigger 78 that is pivotably connected via a pivot rod 80, a spray nozzle 82, and a simulated fire extinguisher closure member 84.
      <br/>
      A lollipop holder 86 is rotatably coupled to the assembly 76.
      <br/>
      The lollipop holder 86 may be provided with a cylindrical plastic end cap 88 which is mounted to a metal rod 90 (FIG. 6) that passes through a bore 92 (FIG. 6) formed in the assembly 76.
      <br/>
      The lollipop holder 86 may also include a positioning shaft 94, an arm 96 integrally formed with the positioning shaft 94, and a gripping member 98 that is integrally formed with the arm 96.
      <br/>
      The gripping member 98 has a central bore that is sized to firmly grip the end of a lollipop stick 100 on which a spherical piece of candy 102 is formed and enclosed via a wrapper 104.
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      Referring to FIG. 6, the positioning shaft 94 may be provided with a plurality of angularly spaced detent members 106, such as four detent members spaced 90 degrees apart.
      <br/>
      The trigger-and-nozzle assembly 76 may be provided with a plurality of detent grooves 108, spaced similarly to the detent members 106, so that the lollipop holder 86 may be selectively retained at one of a plurality of detent positions, such as the three positions shown in FIG. 5, so that the lollipop may be retained at a first, substantially upright position, a second position in which the lollipop stick 100 is horizontal, and a third position in which the lollipop is disposed downwardly.
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      The positioning shaft 94 may also be provided with a stop member 110, and the trigger-and-nozzle assembly 76 may be provided with a pair of stop members 112, 114.
      <br/>
      The abutment of the stop member 110 against the stop member 112 limits the range of rotation of the lollipop holder 86 in a first rotational direction, and the abutment of the stop member 110 against the stop member 114 limits the range of rotation of the lollipop holder 86 in a second rotational direction opposite the first rotational direction.
    </p>
    <p num="20">
      The internal construction of the candy-holding and liquid-dispensing apparatus 70 is shown in FIGS. 7 and 8.
      <br/>
      Referring to those figures, the liquid reservoir 74, which is disposed in the bottom portion of the housing 72, contains a supply of potable liquid 121, such as water, that is intended to be sprayed into a person's mouth.
      <br/>
      The bottom of the liquid reservoir 74 has a fill hole 122 formed therein, and a stopper 124 is disposed through the fill hole 122.
    </p>
    <p num="21">
      The stopper 124, which may be composed of rubber, has a T-shaped retaining member 126 and a plug portion 128 that is adapted to tightly seal the fill hole 122.
      <br/>
      The stopper 124 is movable between a removed position, shown in FIG. 8, in which liquid may be added to the reservoir 74 through the fill hole 122, and a plugged position in which the plug portion 128 seals the fill hole 122.
    </p>
    <p num="22">
      A generally circular plate 130 is disposed at the top of the liquid reservoir 74.
      <br/>
      The plate 130 has a hole 132 formed therein, and an annular raised seating member 134 is disposed concentrically with respect to the hole 132.
      <br/>
      A bottom portion of a cylindrical bellows 136 is seated around the seating member 134, and a key member 138 is formed in the top portion of the bellows 136.
      <br/>
      The key member 138 is disposed and retained within a locating bore 140 formed in the bottom of a reciprocable linear actuator 142.
      <br/>
      The linear actuator 142 is held in a substantially vertical position via a plurality of bores formed in the apparatus 70.
      <br/>
      The top end of the linear actuator 142 is disposed within a groove 144 formed in the underside of the trigger 78.
    </p>
    <p num="23">
      As shown more clearly in FIG. 7, a bi-directional seating member 146 is formed with the plate 130.
      <br/>
      An upper portion of the seating member 146 seats, such as by being press-fit, a lower end of an upper liquid draw tube 150, and a lower portion of the seating member 146 seats an upper end of a lower liquid draw tube 152.
      <br/>
      The lower end of the lower draw tube 152 is submerged beneath the liquid 121, and the upper end of the upper draw tube 150 is disposed in fluid communication with a flow path formed within the nozzle 82, so that a fluid flow path exists from the lower end of the lower draw tube 152 to the nozzle 82.
    </p>
    <p num="24">
      In operation, when the trigger 78 is pushed downwards from its position shown in FIG. 8, the trigger 78 pushes the linear actuator 142 downwards, which in turn compresses the bellows 136 and forces air from within the bellows 136 into the liquid reservoir 74.
      <br/>
      As the pressure within the liquid reservoir 74 increases, liquid is forced upwardly through the draw tubes 150, 152 and out the nozzle 82.
      <br/>
      When the trigger 78 is released, it is forced upwardly by the linear actuator 142 and the bellows 136, which acts as a spring.
    </p>
    <p num="25">
      Although a particular mechanism has been illustrated, the particular type of spray mechanism utilized is not considered important to the invention, and other types of spray mechanisms could be used.
      <br/>
      For example, the housing in which the liquid reservoir 74 is disposed could be composed of a flexible material, and liquid could be forced out of the liquid reservoir 74 simply by squeezing the walls of the housing in order to force the liquid out of the nozzle 82.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, the type of spray mechanism typically used on plastic bottles of window cleaner could be utilized.
    </p>
    <p num="26">
      The spray nozzle 82 could be designed to spray liquid in a relatively solid stream, or alternatively, the spray nozzle 82 could be an atomizing nozzle which sprays the liquid in the form of mist or small droplets.
      <br/>
      Regardless of how the liquid is sprayed, the nozzle may be designed to spray the liquid into the mouth of the person when the nozzle 82 is held at a distance from the mouth of the person, such as at least about six inches.
    </p>
    <p num="27">
      The candy-holding and liquid-dispensing apparatus 70 may be provided with a piece of candy other than a lollipop.
      <br/>
      The piece of candy may be provided with a hot flavor, such as the flavor of the candy sold under the trademark "RED HOTS." In that case, after the piece of candy is tasted, a cooling spray of water or other cooling liquid may be sprayed into the mouth of the person via the spray nozzle 82.
    </p>
    <p num="28">
      Modifications and alternative embodiments of the invention will be apparent to those skilled in the art in view of the foregoing description.
      <br/>
      This description is to be construed as illustrative only, and is for the purpose of teaching those skilled in the art the best mode of carrying out the invention.
      <br/>
      The details of the structure and method may be varied substantially without departing from the spirit of the invention, and the exclusive use of all modifications which come within the scope of the appended claims is reserved.
