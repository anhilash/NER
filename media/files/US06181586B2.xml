    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">The invention herein relates on one hand to a current-to-voltage converter, in particular for high input voltages, with a primary side, which comprises several serially connected partial systems including, respectively, at least one transistor circuit breaker and at least one separate associate transformer primary winding, and with a secondary side, over which the partial systems arc coupled into a common load output, and relates on the other hand relates to a current-to-voltage converter, in particular for high input currents, with a primary side, which comprises several parallel connected partial systems including, respectively, at least one transistor circuit breaker and at least one separate associate transformer primary winding, and with a secondary side, over which the partial systems are coupled into a common load output, and further relates to an associate closed-loop control circuit comprising a voltage regulator with voltage comparator and voltage amplifier and comprising a current regulator with current comparator and current amplifier, as well as a correction member located between the voltage regulator and the current regulator.</p>
    <p num="3">
      In the case of voltage converters for high alternate input voltages or direct voltage as known from prior art, a peak value of the rectified voltage is impressed on a high-capacity capacitor located directly at the outputs of a rectifier.
      <br/>
      Consequently, very expensive charge circuits with pre-charging capability had to be implemented, for example, by including a resistor and subsequent bridging with ground contacts.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      Also, so-called "double-booster" topologies have been known; these comprise an intermediate circuit including with an electrolyte capacitor in such a manner that the latter or the upstream mains is subjected to a load when the high input voltage is impressed due to the feedthrough, without short circuit limit.
      <br/>
      Therefore, this capacitor must be configured for the peak voltage at the input, whereby this peak voltage is greater than the booster's regulated output voltage.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      Furthermore, in controlling high input voltages and currents, problems occur concerning the components used.
      <br/>
      The semiconductors such as transistors and diodes used must be adapted to the maximum input voltage or current, and the transformers used must be adapted from the viewpoints of power, as well as voltage, to the input voltage to be processed, whereby unacceptable winding and coil voltages occur.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      In the case of known converters, which use power transistors as switching elements, the permissible input voltage is limited by the load capability of the type of power transistor used.
      <br/>
      When several synchronously clocked transistors are connected in series and/or parallel, the problem of voltage and/or current balancing arises, one example of this being the connection of loss-prone RCD line branches parallel to the transistor break distance.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      DE 4,414,677 A1 has suggested a primary switched voltage converter with a primary side composed of several serially connected partial systems, each including a transistor circuit breaker arrangement, whereby each of these systems is associated with a separate transformer primary winding, which, in turn, are coupled into a common load output over the secondary side of the converter.
      <br/>
      Due to the transformer winding voltage, this coupling effects automatic, dynamic and quasi loss-free voltage balancing between the partial systems under load.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      In the case of this form of embodiment the transformer windings are connected "hard" parallel on the secondary side.
      <br/>
      This has the disadvantage that the absence of balances results in dynamic circulating currents--which are not current-limiting--but effect balancing.
    </p>
    <p num="9">Also this circuit layout has the disadvantage that, in the case of converters with alternating current input, a peak value of the rectified voltage is impressed directly on a high-capacity capacitor located directly at the output of a rectifier and that all of these flow-through converter topologies do not permit a power take-up (Power Factor Correction=PFC) adapted to the waveform of the input voltage.</p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="10">Therefore, the problem to be solved by the invention herein provides a converter for high input voltages or input currents, said converter having a simple design and improving voltage or current balancing.</p>
    <p num="11">In accordance with the invention herein, this problem has been solved in the case of a converter, in particular for high input voltages, in that each of the serially connected partial systems comprises a branch with input-side inductance and at least one transistor circuit breaker, whereby the inductances are applied, at least temporarily, over the corresponding transistor circuit breaker electrically in series to the input voltage and result in voltage balancing between the partial systems, and whereby one output of each of the partial systems is connected with the respective transformer primary winding acting as isolating transformer for power supply.</p>
    <p num="12">In accordance with the invention herein, this problem has been solved in the case of a converter, in particular for high input currents, in that each of the parallel connected partial systems comprises a branch with an input-side inductance and at least one transistor circuit breaker which, at least temporarily, is connected electrically parallel to input voltage UE and thereby balances the currents between the partial systems, and that respectively one output of the partial systems is connected with respectively one transformer primary winding acting as isolating transformer for power supply.</p>
    <p num="13">
      As opposed to known systems, this topology results in the supply of power into the transformer.
      <br/>
      This means that each primary winding transmits its current in a flow-through manner and hence impresses it on the secondary load.
    </p>
    <p num="14">
      By time-synchronized activation of all transistor circuit breakers, each partial system works with a partial voltage or partial current, which is obtained by dividing the input voltage UE or the input current IE by the number N of the serially or parallel connected partial systems.
      <br/>
      In so doing, commercially available components can be used for the layout of the transistor circuit breakers, as well as for the layout of inductances such as reactance coils and isolating transformers, whereby these components need not comply with high-voltage requirements.
      <br/>
      This reduces costs considerably.
      <br/>
      When compared with prior art, the essential difference is that voltage and/or current are balanced over the input-side inductance or primary-side inductance or reactance coil of the corresponding partial system.
      <br/>
      Provided that all reactance coils, which are temporarily connected in series or parallel, exhibit the same inductance and synchronous activation is ensured, on one hand a proportional voltage drop occurs on each reactance coil carrying a current for a certain period of time, when the connection is in series, so that also the voltage applied over the circuit elements corresponds to a Nth portion of the input voltage UE, and on the other hand a proportional current drop occurs, when the connection is parallel, so that current flowing through the circuit elements corresponds to a Nth portion of the input current.
    </p>
    <p num="15">In a particularly preferred embodiment the partial systems are configured as SEPIC converters or regenerators, whereby at least one converter, preferably the reference (connected to ground) converter, is connected with only one closed-loop control circuit, the output signal of which is supplied to a trigger circuit associated with all transistor circuit breakers.</p>
    <p num="16">
      In another particularly preferred embodiment the closed-loop control circuit includes a circuit, which is connected to line voltage for the detection of line voltage and/or line frequency, and sends corresponding signals to the closed-loop control circuit, whereby the voltage converter functions either as DC converter or as AC converter with PFC analysis, depending on the input voltage.
      <br/>
      By using a mains-connected detector, the voltage converter can be used in a large number of applications.
      <br/>
      Therefore, this voltage converter system is particularly suitable for continuous path operation using at least four UIC voltages (1000 VAC 162/3 Hz; 1500 VAC 50 Hz; 1500 VDC; 3000 VDC).
    </p>
    <p num="17">
      Therefore, this novel voltage converter system is capable of adapting to various input voltages and/or frequencies with power take-up.
      <br/>
      In addition, the control parameters can be preset to the respective nominal voltage.
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      For PFC analysis, a measuring element such as a shunt is associated with at least one additional reactance coil, which is coupled magnetically with the input-side reactance coil, whereby a value IA ' proportional to the output current IA, preferably a DC value, can be sampled at said shunt.
      <br/>
      Also in this case there is the advantage that a PFC control is possible with any input alternating voltage.
      <br/>
      Preferably, the measuring element is located in the partial system connected with the reference potential.
      <br/>
      The value IA ' may also contain an AC share which occurs proportional to the input current IE, i.e., representing a sinusoidal half-wave function.
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      Another advantage of the use of SEPIC converters in the voltage converter system introduced herein is based on the fact that the otherwise common primary storage capacitor carries out a transformation to the low-voltage side or secondary side at the rectifier output or in the intermediate circuit and is charged there by short-circuit current control.
      <br/>
      As a result, the otherwise available storage capacitor is withdrawn from the primary direct access of the input voltage.
      <br/>
      For this reason, electrolytes can be omitted at the input (high-voltage circuit), and electrolytes can be transformed into the secondary circuit (low-voltage circuit).
    </p>
    <p num="20">Due to the input-side series or parallel connection of the converters activating the isolating transformers, the converters themselves may be designed for 1/N times the total output, whereby N represents the number of partial systems that are connected in series or parallel.</p>
    <p num="21">Therefore, also the voltage or current per turn of the individual current isolating transformers can be correspondingly lower.</p>
    <p num="22">
      In a preferred form of embodiment the output voltage of the current-to-voltage converter system can be adjusted to various output voltages.
      <br/>
      This is achieved specifically by activating the transistor circuit breakers located in the partial systems.
      <br/>
      Also in this case it is possible to associate one primary winding on a core with several secondary windings having different numbers of turns per unit length.
    </p>
    <p num="23">
      In this case the transistor circuit breakers located in the partial systems can be activated over a transmitter provided on one core, thereby ensuring the time-synchronous activation of the transistor circuit breakers that are connected in series or parallel.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, the primary winding of the isolating transformer is coupled over a diode with a corresponding output of the SEPIC converter.
      <br/>
      This ensures that reverse currents of the isolating transformer do not affect the SEPIC converter negatively and that the free demagnetization of the current isolating transformer is possible.
    </p>
    <p num="24">Furthermore, the primary windings are wound on the same core and act on a secondary winding.</p>
    <p num="25">Furthermore, in accordance with the invention herein, a closed-loop control circuit for a current-to-voltage converter has been suggested, which comprises a voltage regulator with voltage comparator and a voltage amplifier, as well as a current regulator with current comparator and current amplifier, as well as a correction member located between the voltage regulator and the current regulator.</p>
    <p num="26">The closed-loop control circuit comprises a circuit for the detection of line voltage and/or line frequency, whereby this circuit is connected with a sampling circuit, which, in turn, is connected with one input to output voltage and with one output to the first input of a voltage comparator, and whereby the voltage regulator is connected on its output side with a preferably multiplying D/A converter, which, in turn, is connected with its second input with an output of the circuit and with its output side with an input of the current comparator of the current regulator.</p>
    <p num="27">
      By detecting the line voltage and the line frequency, the closed-loop control circuit can be set to different input voltages and/or frequencies.
      <br/>
      The said circuit makes corresponding control parameters available.
      <br/>
      Consequently, a PFC analysis may be performed at any input alternating voltage (amplitude, range and frequency).
      <br/>
      As an alternative, the rectified input voltage (downstream of the rectifier) may be sampled or detected.
    </p>
    <p num="28">
      In order to ensure an accurate detection of the line voltage and the line frequency, whereby the line voltage can also be a DC voltage, the circuit is configured as an integrated circuit, preferable as microprocessor or micro-controller.
      <br/>
      Depending on the detected mains parameters, a synthetic function with constant amplitude B (with DC input) or a pulsed sine function Bmax.vertline.sin ( OMEGA t)l (with AC input) may be made available in phase and synchronous to the mains input, the latter representing the actually synchronized line frequency.
      <br/>
      Then the error-amplified voltage difference kU *  DELTA UA can be multiplied with the digital sine function available at the micro-controller output.
      <br/>
      To achieve this, the D/A converter, to which the digital sine of the circuit is supplied, follows downstream the voltage amplifier.
      <br/>
      At the output of the D/A converter a sine-modulated, error-amplified voltage can be sampled, which is available as nominal value to the downstream current-regulating circuit.
    </p>
    <p num="29">
      The advantage of this novel closed-loop control circuit layout is that a correction due to input voltage changes is not necessary.
      <br/>
      In particular, the correction member does not require correction as a function of the input voltage UE.
      <br/>
      In addition, the actual current IA1st supplied to the closed-loop control circuit is independent of the fluctuations of input voltage UE.
    </p>
    <p num="30">Furthermore, pre-programmed sine functions are stored in the circuit, whereby digital values can be multiplied and utilized by the D/A converter downstream the voltage converter.</p>
    <p num="31">Furthermore, the synthetic sine generated in the circuit is utilized as reference for continuous detection of undervoltages and overvoltages.</p>
    <p num="32">And, furthermore, the closed-loop control circuit comprises a comparator circuit integrated in the switching circuit, with which said comparator circuit the synthetic sine applied to the output of the switching circuit is synchronized relative to the power mains.</p>
    <p num="33">If the line voltage does not have zero crossings, i.e., an input voltage is concerned, the switching circuit generates a constant value B so that the closed-loop control circuit functions as DC regulating circuit and a PFC analysis does not occur in this case.</p>
    <p num="34">
      As a result of the above measures, the field of use of the voltage converter system may be expanded considerably, so that specifically in continuous path applications at least four UIC voltages (1000 VAC 162/3 Hz, 1500 VAC 50 Hz, 1500 VDC, 3000 VDC) or 48/60/110/220 VDC and 110/234 VAC 60/50 Hz power mains can be controlled as input voltage range converters.
      <br/>
      Inasmuch as the converter or regenerator pennits very wide input voltage ranges, the problem of determining DC input voltages or AC input voltages with varying frequencies has been solved by the described method, so that all four voltage ranges plus tolerances (+/-30%) and long-term transients can be processed in one input voltage range.
      <br/>
      Also, DC input voltages having a particularly high proportion of alternating voltages can be controlled preferably without peak currents.
      <br/>
      In addition, it is possible to preset a few control parameters to the nominal voltage (TOn time).
    </p>
    <p num="35">
      The method of the invention herein is distinguished in that the primary partial systems are operated with non-pulsating current and such partial systems are cascaded for the first time.
      <br/>
      These partial systems represent so-called "reactance-analyzed" topologies, which do not use pulsating current to the input.
      <br/>
      In addition, in accordance with the invention herein, the PFC analysis of the cascaded partial systems occurs in one stage on only one partial system, whereby, however, the entire system is subjected to PFC analysis.
    </p>
    <p num="36">
      Based on the method herein, control variables or monitoring functions do not require feedback by complex, potential-isolating measures.
      <br/>
      This is achieved in that the output current can be measured as "average" value on the primary side.
      <br/>
      In addition, the output voltage can be measured on the primary side on the primary-side transformer winding during the TOff time.
      <br/>
      Advantageously, the input voltage UE can be measured on the secondary side on a secondary winding during the TOn time.
    </p>
    <p num="37">A correction of the closed-loop control circuit over the input voltage UE, as has been known from prior art closed-loop control circuits, is not necessary in the case of the inventive closed-loop control circuit because the line voltage/input voltage is pre-given by the switching circuit and the value proportional to the output current is not a function of input voltage fluctuations.</p>
    <p num="38">
      Furthermore, a current-to-voltage converter in accordance with claim 25 exhibits independent inventive character.
      <br/>
      On its primary side it has substantially the layout of a partial systems of the already described cascaded current-to-voltage converter, however, on its output side it has multiple outputs with separate secondary windings which are energized through the primary winding over a joint core.
      <br/>
      Inasmuch as the isolating transformer is supplied with power, the output voltages of the multiple outputs are determined solely based on the winding ratio of the numbers of turns per unit length of the primary winding to the secondary winding.
      <br/>
      The individual currents are divided corresponding to the internal impedance of the load acting on the individual outputs.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the output voltages are constant even with changing load currents.
    </p>
    <p num="39">
      Also in this case the current-to-voltage converter is operated with non-pulsating current.
      <br/>
      The output values, again, can be measured on the primary side and fed to the above-described closed-loop control circuit.
    </p>
    <p num="40">As an alternative, an additional winding or a secondary winding and/or the primary winding itself may be configured as a measuring winding in order to produce signals for the closed-loop control circuit.</p>
