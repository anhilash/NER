      A spline for joining two adjacent structural insulated panels each having an insulating core disposed between and joined to first and second outer facings includes a backer member attached to a metal strip by a conventional coupler such as an adhesive.
      <br/>
      The backer member and metal strip form an elongated, linear combination, and the outer surface of the backer member may be provided with a groove or slot extending the length thereof.
      <br/>
      The backer member slot facilitates bending or folding the backer plate and metal strip combination along the length thereof into two connected sections for use as a spline.
      <br/>
      The angled spline is used for connecting adjacent panels which may be oriented at a relative angle alpha, where alpha&gt;0°, by placing each section of the spline in intimate contact with a respective panel along the lengths thereof.
      <br/>
      Conventional connectors such as screws or nails are inserted through each panel and its associated spline section to connect adjacent panels.
      <br/>
      In one embodiment, the angled spline is positioned in abutting contact with and attached to each of the inner and outer facings of a pair of connected panels to increase the strength of the joint.
      <br/>
      The backer member may be comprised of any of the more common building materials such as wood or a gypsum or cement composite.

    <heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="1">This invention relates generally to structural panels for buildings and is particularly directed to the joinder of structural insulated panels having an insulating core where the joined panels may be oriented at virtually any angle relative to one another.</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">
      Structural Insulated Panels (SIPs) are commonly used in building construction and are comprised of two outer rigid faces on either side of a light insulating foam core.
      <br/>
      Panels of this type are generally joined by means of lumber and nails, but are increasingly connected using steel studs rather than the conventional 2 *  dimensional lumber approach.
      <br/>
      The junctures of such panels typically employ a lumber spline with nails and screws for joining.
    </p>
    <p num="3">
      Referring to FIG. 1, there is shown a sectional view of a prior art panel coupling arrangement 10 for connecting adjacent first and second structural insulated panels 12 and 14 which are oriented with an obtuse angle between the planes of each of the panels.
      <br/>
      The relative orientation of the first and second panels 12,14 is such as would be encountered in the ridge of a roof.
      <br/>
      The first structural insulated panel 12 includes first and second outer facings 12a and 12b and an insulating core 12c disposed between and attached to each of the outer facings.
      <br/>
      Similarly, the second panel 14 includes first and second opposed outer facings 14a and 14b and an insulating core 14c disposed between and affixed to the two outer facings.
      <br/>
      The outer facings of each of the panels may be comprised of any of the more conventional construction materials such as wood, waferboard, sheet metal, gypsum, or oriented strand board (OSB).
      <br/>
      Each of the insulating cores 12c and 14c is preferably comprised of a plastic foam such as expanded polystyrene (EPS), extruded polystyrene (XPS) or polyurethanes or polyisocyanurates.
      <br/>
      Each of the outer facings is securely bonded to its inner rigid foam core by conventional means such as mastic, epoxy cement or urethane glue.
      <br/>
      As shown in the prior art panel coupling arrangement 10 of FIG. 1, the ends of the insulating cores 12c and 14c of the first and second panels 12,14 have been omitted or removed from the edge of the panel.
      <br/>
      This permits adjacent edges of the first and second panels 12,14 to each receive a respective panel support beam 16a and 16b between the outer facings of the panel.
      <br/>
      First and second sealant beads or strips 18a and 18b are respectively positioned between beam 16a and insulating core 12c and between beam 16b and insulating core 14c.
      <br/>
      The first and second panels 12,14 are respectively attached to panel support beams 16a and 16b by means of upper connectors 20 and 22, and lower connectors 24 and 26.
      <br/>
      Each of the connectors 20,22,24 and 26 is in the form of either a nail or screw and is inserted through an outer facing of a panel and into one of the panel support beams.
      <br/>
      Thus, connectors 20 and 24 are respectively inserted through outer facings 12a and 12b and into panel support beam 16a.
      <br/>
      Similarly, connectors 22 and 26 are respectively inserted through outer facings 14a and 14b and into panel support beam 16b.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      Referring to FIG. 2, there is shown a sectional view of another common prior art coupling arrangement 30 for connecting adjacent structural insulated panels 32 and 34 such as in forming the ridge of a roof.
      <br/>
      Adjacent edges of the first and second panels 32,34 are positioned on a ridge beam 36.
      <br/>
      First and second threaded connectors 38 and 40 are respectively inserted through the first and second panels 32 and 34 and into ridge beam 36.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      Another prior art panel coupling arrangement 30 for connecting first and second structural insulated panels 48 and 50 which are oriented at 90 (degree)  relative to one another is shown in the sectional view of FIG. 3.
      <br/>
      The panel coupling arrangement 46 shown in FIG. 3 is typical of a connection between adjacent corner wall panels.
      <br/>
      Adjacent ends of the first and second panels 48,50 are hollowed out, or are provided with a channel, to respectively receive wood splines 54 and 58.
      <br/>
      The first wood spline 54 is attached to the outer facings of the first panel 48 by means of connectors 56a and 56b.
      <br/>
      Similarly, the second wood spline 58 is connected to the outer facings of the second panel 50 by means of connectors 60a and 60b.
      <br/>
      Sealant beads 62 and 64 are respectively positioned on the first and second wood splines 54 and 58 between the wood spline and its associated insulating core, and extend the length of the wood spline.
      <br/>
      A threaded coupler 52 is inserted through the end of the first panel 48 and into the second wood spline 58 of the second panel 50 as shown in FIG. 3 for connecting the two panels.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      The panel coupling arrangements described above involve the use of substantial amounts of lumber which increased the cost of the installation.
      <br/>
      These prior art panel coupling arrangements also frequently require the ripping of lumber to special angles in the field, particularly in the case of pitched roofs, which also increases the cost and complexity of the installation.
      <br/>
      In some cases, the lumber spline is in contact with the outer and inner facings of the panel and acts as a through-conductor for heat resulting in energy loss.
      <br/>
      In addition, the panel corner coupling arrangement of FIG. 3 is not easily adapted to receive electrical wiring around the corner.
      <br/>
      Access holes must be cut or drilled in at least two wood splines to accommodate electrical wiring around the corner.
      <br/>
      Finally, the aforementioned panel coupling arrangements employ connectors such as nails and screws extending through plastic panel facings and into wood splines and beams which affords only limited joint strength.
    </p>
    <p num="7">The present invention addresses the aforementioned limitations of the prior art by providing a metal faced angled spline for use in connecting adjacent structural insulated panels arranged at virtually any relative angular orientation in forming a high strength, sealed joint.</p>

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
    <p num="14">
      Referring to FIG. 4, there is shown a perspective view of a spline 70 for connecting adjacent structural insulated panels in accordance with the principles of the present invention.
      <br/>
      Spline 70 is rectangular and generally flat in shape and includes a backing member 72 and a metal facing 74.
      <br/>
      Backing member 72 and metal facing 74 are affixed to each other by means of an adhesive layer 78 disposed therebetween.
      <br/>
      Backing member 72 may be comprised of any of the more conventional building materials such as wood or gypsum or cement composite material.
      <br/>
      Metal facing 74 is in the form of a thin sheet and is preferably comprised of a high strength metal such as steel or aluminum.
      <br/>
      Adhesive layer 78 may be comprised of any of the more conventional adhesive materials such as epoxy cement, urethane glue or mastic.
      <br/>
      Disposed within and extending the length of backing to member 72 is an elongated, linear slot or groove 76 extending the length of spline 70.
      <br/>
      Slot 76 facilitates folding of spline 70 along its longitudinal axis A-A' (shown in FIG. 4 in dotted line form).
      <br/>
      In a preferred embodiment, slot 76 is generally V-shaped and extends through backing member 72 to the inner surface of the metal facing 74.
      <br/>
      Slot 76 divides spline 70 into first and second spline sections 70a and 70b which may be folded relative to one another along axis A-A' and placed in contact with respective adjacent structural insulated panels as described in detail below.
      <br/>
      In a typical installation, spline is 5" wide, 5/8" thick and 96" long, although spline is not limited to these specific dimensions.
    </p>
    <p num="15">
      Referring to FIG. 5, there is shown a partial sectional view of a panel coupling arrangement 80 in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention.
      <br/>
      Panel coupling arrangement 80 connects first and second structural insulated panels 82 and 84 together as well as to a ridge beam 86.
      <br/>
      As in the previously described arrangements, the first panel 82 includes first and second outer facings 82a and 82b and an insulating core 82c disposed between and attached to each of the outer facings by means of an adhesive layer which is not shown in the figure for simplicity.
      <br/>
      Similarly, the second panel 84 includes first and second opposed outer facings 84a and 84b and an insulating core 84c disposed between and affixed to each of the outer facings.
      <br/>
      First and second threaded connectors 92a and 92b are inserted through the outer facings and insulating cores of the first and second panels 82 and 84, respectively.
      <br/>
      Each of the threaded connectors 92a and 92b is further inserted into the ridge beam 86 for securely attaching the first and second panels 82,84 to the ridge beam.
      <br/>
      A metal-faced angled spline 88 in accordance with the present invention is positioned in engagement with adjacent inner portions of the outer facings 82a and 84a of the first and second panels 82, 84.
      <br/>
      As shown in the figure, spline 88 is bent so as to conform with the relative angular orientation of the outer facings 82a, 84a of the first and second panels 82, 84.
      <br/>
      The metal facing 88a of spline 88 is placed in contact with the aforementioned outer facings of the joined panels and the spline's backing member 88b is placed in contact with the respective insulating cores 82c and 84c of the joined panels.
      <br/>
      Each of the insulating cores 82c and 84c of the two panels may be provided with a respective cut-out portion as shown in the figure to receive a respective section of spline 88.
      <br/>
      A slot in spline 88 similar to that in the spline shown in FIG. 4 allows the spline to be folded so as to conform with the relative angular orientation of the facings 82a and 84a of the first and second panels 82,84.
      <br/>
      First and second connectors 90a and 90b are respectively inserted through outer facings 82a and 84a and through spline 88 to securely connect the spline to the first and second panels 82, 84.
      <br/>
      Connectors 90a and 90b may be conventional such as screws or nails.
      <br/>
      Spline 88 preferably extends the full length of the joint between the first and second panels 82,84.
      <br/>
      Similarly, spline 88 may be of virtually any width so long as the two spline sections formed when the spline is folded can be securely affixed to the respective outer facings of the first and second panels 82,84.
      <br/>
      Spline 88 may be folded to the required angle either in the field immediately before application to the joined panels or may be pre-bent to the desired angle at the factory following manufacture.
    </p>
    <p num="16">
      Referring to FIG. 6, there is shown another panel coupling arrangement for connecting first and second structural insulated panels 102 and 104 which form a roof valley.
      <br/>
      The construction of each of the first and second panels 102,104 is the same as those previously described and will not be further discussed herein.
      <br/>
      In joining the first and second panels 102,104, a first metal faced angled spline 106 is placed in contact with and connected to the upper outer facings of these two panels, while a second metal faced angled spline 108 is placed in contact with and connected to a lower pair of outer facings of the two panels.
      <br/>
      In the case of the first spline 106, its backing member 106b is placed in contact with the inner edge portions of the outer facings of the first and second panels 102, 104.
      <br/>
      Metal facing 106a of spline 106 is placed in contact with the insulating core of the two panels.
      <br/>
      In the case of the second spline 108, its metal facing 108a is placed in contact with the outer facings of the first and second panels 102,104, while its backing member 108b is placed in contact with the insulating cores of these panels.
      <br/>
      A first pair of connectors 11a and 110b are inserted through adjacent edges of the outer facings of the panels 102,104 and through respective sections of the first spline 106 for securely connecting the spline to the two panels.
      <br/>
      Similarly, third and fourth connectors 112a and 112b are inserted through edge portions of opposed outer facings of the two panels and through respective sections of the second spline 108 to securely connect the spline to each of the first and second panels 102,104.
    </p>
    <p num="17">
      Referring to FIG. 7, there is shown a partial sectional view of a panel coupling arrangement 120 for coupling two structural insulated panels 122 and 124 oriented at 90 (degree)  relative to one another such as encountered in wall corner connections in accordance with another embodiment of the present invention.
      <br/>
      As in the previously described arrangements, each of the first and second panels 122,124 includes an inner insulating core and first and second outer opposed facings.
      <br/>
      A first metal faced angled spline 126 is shown adjacent the panel coupling arrangement 120 and is shown incorporated in the panel coupling arrangement as element 126'. Similarly, a second metal faced angled spline 128 is shown adjacent the panel coupling arrangement 120 and is also shown as element 128' as incorporated in the panel coupling arrangement.
      <br/>
      As in the previously described embodiments, the first spline 126 includes a metal facing 126a, a backing member 126b and a slot 126c in the backing member.
      <br/>
      Similarly, the second spline 128 includes a metal facing 128a, a backing member 126b and a slot 126c within the backing member.
      <br/>
      In the arrangement shown in FIG. 7, the sections of each of the first and second splines 126' and 128' are oriented at 90 (degree)  when inserted in the panel coupling arrangement 120.
      <br/>
      The metal facing 126a of the first metal faced angled spline 126 is disposed in contact with a first pair of adjacent outer facings of first and second panels 122 and 124.
      <br/>
      Similarly, the backing member 128b of the second spline 128 is disposed in contact with a second, opposed pair of outer facings of panels 122 and 124.
      <br/>
      A first pair of connectors 130 couple the first spline 126' to the panels' outer facings, while a second pair of connectors 132 connect the second spline 128' to the opposed pair of outer facings of the two panels.
      <br/>
      The orientation of the first and second splines in FIGS. 6 and 7 shows that the spline's metal facing may engage the panels' inner or outer facings.
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      Referring to FIG. 8, there is shown a partial sectional view of yet another panel coupling arrangement 134 in accordance with the principles of the present invention.
      <br/>
      Panel coupling arrangement 134 connects first and second structural insulated panels 136 and 138 which are oriented at 900 relative to one another such as encountered in wall corner connections.
      <br/>
      The first panel 136 includes first and second outer facings 136a and 136b and an inner insulating core 136c.
      <br/>
      Similarly, the second panel 138 includes first and second outer facings 138a and 138b and an inner insulating core 138c.
      <br/>
      Disposed within the insulating core 136c of the first panel 136 is an elongated, linear channel 148, while disposed within the insulating core 138c of the second panel 138 is a second elongated, linear channel 150.
      <br/>
      Also disposed within the first panel 136 and continuous with the linear channel 148 therein is a curvilinear channel 152.
      <br/>
      Similarly, disposed within the second panel 138 and continuous with its linear channel 150 is a curvilinear channel 154.
      <br/>
      Adjacent edges of the first and second panels 136,138 are bevelled so that the two panels form a 90 (degree)  angle when placed in edge-abutting contact as shown in the figure.
      <br/>
      With the two panels disposed in edge-abutting contact, the curvilinear channels 152 and 154 of the two panels are in common alignment also as shown in the figure.
      <br/>
      With the first and second panels 136,138 arranged in edge-abutting contact so their respective channels are aligned, the two linear channels 148 and 154 and the two curvilinear channels 152 and 154 form a continuous chase for carrying electrical wiring within the two adjoining panels.
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      The first and second panels 136,138 are securely joined together in edge-abutting contact by means of first and second metal faced angled splines 140 and 142.
      <br/>
      The first spline 140 includes a metal facing 140a and a backing member 140b, while the second spline 142 also includes a metal facing 142a and a backing member 142b.
      <br/>
      To form the first spline 140 in the shape shown in FIG. 8, the spline is bent in a direction of a slot in the spline's backing member 140b.
      <br/>
      Conversely, the second spline 142 is bent away from a slot in the spline's backing member 142b so that the two spline sections are placed in contact with respective adjacent edges of outer facings 136b and 138b of panels 136 and 138.
      <br/>
      A first pair of threaded connectors 144 connect the first spline 140 to the two panels, while a second pair of threaded connectors 146 connect the second spline 142 to the two panels.
      <br/>
      The electrical chase formed in the two coupled panels 136,138 is formed without cutting through panel attachment and supporting splines as in the prior art approach discussed above.
    </p>
    <p num="20">
      There has thus been shown a spline for joining two adjacent structural insulated panels.
      <br/>
      The spline includes a thin metal strip attached to a backing member which may have a slot therein.
      <br/>
      The slot extends the length of the spline and facilitates folding of the spline to form first and second coupled spline sections.
      <br/>
      Each spline section is attached to adjacent edge portions of the outer facings of the coupled panels by conventional connectors such as nails or screws.
      <br/>
      The two spline sections may be angularly oriented relative to one another so as to match the angle of intersection of the two connected panes which permits the metal faced angled spline to connect adjacent, edge-abutting panels which may be oriented at virtually any relative angle.
      <br/>
      The spline's backing member may be wood, a gypsum or cement composite material, or other conventional building material.
      <br/>
      The use of a gypsum or cement composite with the metal strip provides a fire resistant spline for joining adjacent panels at the weakest point in terms of the spread of fire in structural insulated panel construction.
      <br/>
      The gypsum/metal or cement/metal spline is effective in blocking fire at the panel joint.
      <br/>
      The metal strip provides the gypsum or cement composite spline with substantially increased strength and greater screw or power driven fastener holding power which gypsum or cement lacks by itself.
      <br/>
      Screws or power driven fasteners are easily and securely driven into a metal faced composite gypsum or cement spline.
