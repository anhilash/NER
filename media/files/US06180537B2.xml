    <p num="5">
      The purpose of a photolithographic process is to transfer a predetermined pattern onto a wafer.
      <br/>
      In order to transfer the predetermined pattern onto the wafer precisely, it is necessary to align the wafer before a photoresist exposure step takes place.
      <br/>
      In a wafer alignment procedure, trenches are first formed in specific areas of the wafer.
      <br/>
      The trenches are used to define an alignment marker area.
      <br/>
      The wafer alignment is obtained by detecting the reflection lights from the trenches in the alignment marker area.

      The alignment marker area 102 includes trenches 102a and 102b formed in the wafer 100.
      <br/>
      The depth of the trenches 102a and 102b is about 1200  Angstrom .
      <br/>
      A device layer 106, which includes a variety devices (not shown), such as a silicon substrate, a source/drain region, a gate, etc., is formed on the wafer 100 in the device area 104.

      In FIG. 1B, a metallic interconnection fabricating process is performed.
      <br/>
      A dielectric layer 108 is formed over the wafer 100.
      <br/>
      Commonly, the dielectric layer 108 is sufficiently transparent in a photolithographic process.
      <br/>
      The transparency of the dielectric layer 108 is advantageous to the alignment detection for the wafer 100.
      <br/>
      However, when the dielectric layer 108 is too thick, often thicker than 40000  Angstrom , it is difficult to detect trenches 102a and 102b in the alignment marker area 102.

    <p num="14">
      Reference will now be made in detail to the present preferred embodiments of the invention, examples of which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings.
      <br/>
      Wherever possible, the same reference numbers are used in the drawings and the description to refer to the same or like parts.
    </p>
    <p num="15">FIGS. 2A through 2F are schematic, cross-sectional views showing a method of fabricating a dielectric layer in an alignment marker area according to one preferred embodiment of the invention.</p>
    <p num="16">
      In FIG. 2A, a wafer 200 having an alignment marker area 202 and a device area 204 is provided.
      <br/>
      A device layer 206 including a variety of devices (not shown), such as a silicon substrate, a source/drain region, a gate, etc., is formed on the wafer 200 in the device region 204.
      <br/>
      The alignment marker area 202 includes large trenches 202a and small trenches 202b on the wafer 200.
      <br/>
      The large trenches 202a and the small trenches 202b together form a step-height surface on the wafer 200 in the alignment marker area 202.
      <br/>
      The step-height surface in the alignment marker area 202 is used to reflect different reflection lights, which is advantageous to the alignment detection.
      <br/>
      The sizes of the trenches 202a and 202b are determined according to the total thickness of multiple dielectric layers (shown in FIG. 2F) formed thereon.
      <br/>
      Typically, the depth of the trenches 202a and 202b preferably is about 5000 angstroms to 15000 angstroms.
    </p>
    <p num="17">
      In FIG. 2B, a planarized dielectric layer 208 is formed over the wafer 200.
      <br/>
      The planarized dielectric layer 208 can be formed by the following exemplary steps.
      <br/>
      A dielectric layer (not shown), such as an inter-layer dielectric (ILD), is formed over the wafer 200.
      <br/>
      The dielectric layer can be formed by, for example, chemical vapor deposition.
      <br/>
      A planarization process, such as a chemical mechanical polishing process, is performed.
      <br/>
      The dielectric layer is planarized to form the planarized dielectric layer 208.
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      In FIG. 2C, portions of the dielectric layer 208, which are directly above the large trenches 202a (FIG. 2A) in the alignment marker area 202, are removed to form trench structures 210a and 210b.
      <br/>
      A portion of the dielectric layer 208 in the device region 204 is removed to form a contact opening 212.
      <br/>
      The dielectric layer 208 can be removed by, for example, anisotropic etching.
      <br/>
      There can be several contact openings formed in the device region 204, although in this preferred embodiment one contact opening 212 is taken as an example.
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      After the trench structures 210a and 210b are formed, the dielectric layer 208 directly above the small trenches 202b rises above the dielectric layer 208 directly above the large trenches 202a.
      <br/>
      The sidewalls 222 of the trench structures 210a and 210b cannot be close to the sidewalls 220 of the trenches 202a, in order to prevent the alignment marker area 202 from being damaged.
      <br/>
      Additionally, the trench structures 210a and 210b are large.
      <br/>
      Thus, the following chemical mechanical polishing step may cause dishing in the trench structures 210a and 210b.
      <br/>
      Once the dishing occurs, it is easy to damage the alignment marker area 202 if the trenches 210a and 210b and the trenches 202a are close to each other.
      <br/>
      Therefore, a distance between the sidewalls 222 of trench structure 210a and 210b and the sidewalls 220 of the trenches 202a preferably is greater than 0.5 mm.
    </p>
    <p num="20">
      The step of removing the dielectric layer 208 to form the trench structures 210a and 210b and the step of removing the dielectric layer 208 to form the contact opening 212 can be performed in the same step, such as an etching step.
      <br/>
      In this manner, it is not necessary to increase the amount of masks, the fabrication cost, and the fabricating time.
    </p>
    <p num="21">
      In FIG. 2D, a metallic layer 214 is formed over the wafer 200.
      <br/>
      The metallic layer 214 can be formed by, for example, chemical vapor deposition.
      <br/>
      The material of the metallic layer 214 can be tungsten, for example.
    </p>
    <p num="22">
      In FIG. 2E, a chemical mechanical polishing step is performed.
      <br/>
      A portion of the metallic layer 214 and a portion of the dielectric layer 208 are removed.
      <br/>
      A planarized dielectric layer 208a and a metallic plug 214a are formed.
      <br/>
      The refection from the metallic layer 214 (shown in FIG. 2D) causes a misalignment for the wafer 200.
      <br/>
      Thus, in order to prevent reflection from metallic layer 214, the metallic layer 214 in the alignment marker are 202 must be completely removed.
      <br/>
      Because the trench structures 210a and 210b are formed in the dielectric layer 208 in the alignment marker area 202, the polishing rate of the metallic layer 214 and the polishing rate of the dielectric layer 208 in the alignment mask area 202 are higher than those in the device region 204.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the metallic layer 214 in the alignment marker area 202 can be completely removed when the metallic plug 214a is formed.
      <br/>
      The dielectric layer 208a in the alignment mark area 202 is thinner than the dielectric layer 208a in the device region 204.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, the sizes of the trench structures 210a and 210b affect the polishing rate.
      <br/>
      Therefore, controlling the sizes of the trenches 210a and 210b controls the polishing rate.
      <br/>
      The thickness of the planarized dielectric layer 208a in the alignment marker area 202 can be further controlled by a polishing rate during chemical mechanical polishing.
    </p>
    <p num="23">
      In FIG. 2F, a metallic layer 216, which serves as a metallic interconnection, is formed on the dielectric layer 208a in the device area 204.
      <br/>
      The metallic plug 214a and the metallic layer 216 are electrically coupled.
      <br/>
      An inter-metal dielectric layer 218 is formed to cover the dielectric layer 208 and the metallic layer 216.
      <br/>
      The metallic layer 216 can be formed by, for example, first depositing a conductive layer on the dielectric layer 208a, and then removing the conductive layer by a photolithographic process.
      <br/>
      The inter-metal dielectric layer 218 can be formed by, for example, first depositing an isolation layer to cover the metallic layer 216 and the dielectric layer 208a, and then planarizing the isolation layer by chemical mechanical polishing.
      <br/>
      Because the trench structures 210a and 210b are formed in the alignment marker area 202, the polishing rate of the inter-metal dielectric layer 218 in the alignment marker area 202 is higher than the polishing rate of the inter-metal dielectric layer 218 in the device area 204.
      <br/>
      Thus, the inter-metal dielectric layer 218 in the alignment marker area 202 can be more effectively removed than the inter-metal dielectric layer 218 in the device area 204.
      <br/>
      The thickness of the inter-metal dielectric layer 218 in the alignment marker area 202 is thinner than the inter-metal dielectric layer 218 in the device area 204.
      <br/>
      The material of the inter-metal dielectric layer 218 preferably is oxide.
      <br/>
      To the advantage of the subsequent alignment detection, the total thickness of multiple dielectric layers, such as the dielectric layer 208a and the inter-metal dielectric layer 218 in this preferred embodiment, preferably is lower than 4000  Angstrom .
      <br/>
      The thickness is required in order to retain the transparency for detection during the wafer alignment step.
    </p>
    <p num="24">
      In this preferred embodiment, the dielectric layer 208a and the inter-metal dielectric layer 218 together form the multiple dielectric layers.
      <br/>
      However, the present invention is not limited to the formation of the exemplary double dielectric layers.
      <br/>
      There can be multiple dielectric layers formed over the wafer 200.
      <br/>
      The sizes of trenches 202a and 202b are predetermined according to the total thickness, which must be lower than 4000  Angstrom , of the multiple dielectric layers.
      <br/>
      With the predetermined sizes trenches 202a and 202b, the polishing rate of the multiple dielectric layers is controlled.
      <br/>
      The thickness of the multiple dielectric layers thus can be controlled.
    </p>
    <p num="25">
      Reference is now made to FIG. 3, which describes an alignment marker area 302 formed on the edge 304 of the wafer 300.
      <br/>
      In this preferred embodiment, a trench structure 306a and a drainage structure 306b are formed in the alignment marker area by etching.
      <br/>
      If desired, there can be several trenches structure formed over the wafer 300.
      <br/>
      The drainage structure 306b is formed in order to remove the slurry used in the chemical mechanical polishing effectively.
      <br/>
      The drainage structure 306b has an open edge along the edge of the wafer 300, so that slurry used in the chemical mechanical polishing step to polish the dielectric layer 308 can drain off the edge of the wafer 300.
    </p>
    <p num="26">In summary, the invention has at least the following advantages:</p>
    <p num="27">
      1.
      <br/>
      The invention forms the trench structures 210a and 210b in the dielectric layer 208 above large trenches 202a in the alignment marker area 202.
      <br/>
      Thus, the polishing rate of the dielectric layer 208 in the alignment marker area 202 is higher than that in the device area 204.
      <br/>
      The remaining thickness of the dielectric layer 208 in the alignment marker area 202 can be effectively decreased after polishing.
    </p>
    <p num="28">
      2. The step of removing the dielectric layer 208 to form the trench structures 210a and 210b and the step of removing the dielectric layer 208 to form the contact opening 212 can be performed in the same step.
      <br/>
      In this manner, it is not necessary to increase the amount of masks, the fabrication cost, and the fabricating time.
    </p>
    <p num="29">
      3. The sizes of the trenches 202a and 202b affect the polishing rate of the multiple dielectric layers formed in the alignment marker area 202.
      <br/>
      Therefore, controlling the sizes of the trenches 202a and 202b controls the polishing rate of the dielectric layers.
      <br/>
      The total thickness of the dielectric layers in the alignment marker area 202 can be further controlled by the polishing rate during chemical mechanical polishing.
      <br/>
      The total thickness of the dielectric layers preferably is less than 40000  Angstrom , which thickness is required in order to retain a high transparency of the dielectric layers.
      <br/>
      Thus, the alignment mark area 202 can be detected.
    </p>
    <p num="30">
      4. In the invention, a drainage structure 306b is formed when the trench 306a is formed.
      <br/>
      The drainage structure 306b is formed in order to remove effectively the slurry used in the chemical mechanical polishing.
      <br/>
      The drainage structure 306b has an open edge along the edge of the wafer 300, so that slurry used in the chemical mechanical polishing step to polish the dielectric layer 308 can drain off the edge of the wafer 300.
