    </p>
    <p num="3">The specifications of these related applications are hereby specifically incorporated by reference.</p>
    <p num="4">
      The present invention relates to a composition for the care and/or treatment of the skin, including the scalp, and/or the lips of human beings, containing an organopolysiloxane gel as gelling agent.
      <br/>
      This composition can be employed in the cosmetics or dermatological field.
      <br/>
      More particularly, this composition is in the form of a homogeneous anhydrous gel containing one or more treating oils.
      <br/>
      In particular, this composition allows the hydration and the nutrition of the skin, providing it with suppleness and softness.
    </p>
    <p num="5">Anhydrous gels based on crosslinked elastomeric organosiloxane, as described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,789,169, are known to be products intended to be applied to the skin, exhibiting good cosmetic properties like softness, a matte appearance and a nongreasy feel.</p>
    <p num="6">Most homogeneous gels are obtained by swelling resins with oils of silicone character, such as linear polydimethylsiloxanes (PDMS) and cyclomethicones, or nonpolar oils such as volatile or nonvolatile derivatives of paraffin originating from petroleum oil, or synthetic ones such as perhydrosqualane.</p>
    <p num="7">
      Although they impart some properties to the skin (antidehydrating property via a protective action or by opposing imperceptible loss of water--ILW), these oils are not in any case "treating" the skin.
      <br/>
      This is because care oils are of vegetable origin and polar in nature, such as triglycerides.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      Unfortunately, these polar oils are capable of being gelled with elastomeric silicones only with very great difficulty; the mixture is either unfeasible or, if it does form, is unstable with the passage of time and granular and opaque in appearance.
      <br/>
      In addition, when employed as they are, these oils are too fluid to be easily applied to the skin.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, they give the skin a greasy feel, which is not very comfortable, and a shiny appearance.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      The subject-matter of the invention is a composition for the care and/or treatment of the skin and/or of the lips enabling these disadvantages to be overcome.
      <br/>
      Surprisingly, it has been found that the use of fluid alkyldimethicone, also called silicone oil with an alkyl chain, allows the polar treating oils to be made compatible with organopolysiloxane resins and to produce translucent, even transparent, stable gels enabling the treating oils to be conveyed without restriction and in a pleasant manner.
    </p>
    <p num="10">The invention applies not only to the products for the care and/or treatment of the skin, including the scalp and the mucosae such as the lips and the inside of the eyelids, but also to lip make-up products which have care and/or treatment properties, and to make-up products for the skin, both of the face and of the body, which have a care and/or treating function.</p>
    <p num="11">More precisely, the subject-matter of the invention is a composition containing at least one partially crosslinked elastomeric solid organopolysiloxane as gelling agent, associated with a fatty phase containing at least one polar oil and at least one cosolvent with a silicone structure comprising at least one alkyl chain which is pendent and/or at the end of a silicone structure, this chain being linear or branched and containing from 3 to 12 carbon atoms.</p>
    <p num="12">This composition can be employed as it is or else can be incorporated into a more complex composition.</p>
    <p num="13">"Elastomeric" is intended to mean a deformable, flexible material which has viscoelastic properties and which exhibits especially the consistency of a sponge or of a flexible sphere.</p>
    <p num="14">
      The elastomeric organopolysiloxanes of the composition according to the invention have a remarkable oil-gelling power.
      <br/>
      They are not desiccant to the skin and contribute good cosmetic properties.
      <br/>
      These new elastomers produce compositions which are comfortable to apply, soft and which do not feel sticky.
      <br/>
      This softness is due especially to the texture of the organopolysiloxanes.
    </p>
    <p num="15">In addition, by virtue of the presence of polar oil, these compositions have treating and/or care properties.</p>
    <p num="16">
      The composition of the invention may take the form of paste, solid or cream.

      The cosolvent(s) is/are advantageously volatile oils, that is to say oils capable of evaporating at ambient temperature, especially from the skin and/or the lips.
