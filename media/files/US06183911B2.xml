    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="1">(a) Field of the Invention</p>
    <p num="2">The present invention relates to a positive active material for rechargeable lithium batteries and a method of preparing the same and, more particularly, to a manganese-based positive active material for rechargeable lithium batteries which has a good cycle life characteristic.</p>
    <p num="3">(b) Description of the Related Art</p>
    <p num="4">
      Generally, manganese-based compounds such as LiMn2 O4 and LiMnO2 are the positive active material of choice for rechargeable lithium batteries because of their low cost, abundance and environmentally friendly characteristics.
      <br/>
      Among such manganese-based compounds, LiMn2 O4 is particularly stable for the battery use and thus attractive for the electric vehicle application.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      However, as compared to other lithiated transition metal oxides such as LiCoO2 and LiNiO2, LiMn2 O4 has a relatively low discharge capacity.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, when high rate of charge and discharge operations are cycled, the discharge capacity is excessively reduced.
      <br/>
      In particular, when the charge and discharge operations are continuously performed at high temperatures, manganese distributed in the surface of LiMn2 O4 readily elutes to the electrolyte, causing a disproportionation reaction.
      <br/>
      This reaction seriously deteriorates the cycle life characteristic of the battery.
    </p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="6">It is an object of the present invention to provide a manganese-based positive active material for rechargeable lithium batteries which exhibits a good cycle life characteristic at high temperatures.</p>

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="10">
      In a method of preparing a positive active material for rechargeable lithium batteries, a powder, being an active material precursor, is first processed from a manganese-based compound.
      <br/>
      The manganese-based compound is selected from Lix MnO2, Lix MnF2, Lix MnS2, Lix MnO2-z Fz, Lix MnO2-z Sz, Lix Mn1-y My O2, Lix Mn1-y My F2, Lix Mn1-y My S2, Lix Mn1-y My O2-z Fz, Lix Mn1-y My O2-z Sz, Lix Mn2 O4, Lix Mn2 F4, Lix Mn2 S4, Lix Mn2 O4-z Fz, Lix Mn2 O4-z Sz, Lix Mn2-y My O4, Lix Mn2-y My F4, Lix Mn2-y My S4, Lix Mn2-y My O4-z Fz, or Lix Mn2-y My O4-z Sz, where 0&lt;x &lt;= 1.5, 0.05 &lt;= y &lt;= 0.3, z &lt;= 1.0 and M is selected from Al, Co, Cr, Mg, Fe, La, Sr, Ce or other transition or lanthanide metals.
      <br/>
      The powder processing step can be performed with a technique known in the related art.
    </p>
    <p num="11">
      Thereafter, the powder is coated with a vanadium pentoxide (V2 O5) aqueous solution or a vanadium pentoxide alcoholic solution.
      <br/>
      The vanadium pentoxide aqueous solution or the vanadium pentoxide alcoholic solution preferably contains 0.1 to 30 weight percent of vanadium pentoxide.
      <br/>
      The vanadium pentoxide aqueous solution may be formed by mixing and refluxing water and vanadium oxide.
      <br/>
      In contrast, the vanadium pentoxide alcoholic solution may be formed by mixing and refluxing alcohol and vanadium pentoxide.
      <br/>
      The alcohol is preferably selected from methanol or ethanol.
      <br/>
      When vanadium pentoxide is less than 0.1 weight percent of water or alcohol, the coating effect of the vanadium pentoxide solution onto the powder is not induced.
      <br/>
      In contrast, when vanadium pentoxide is more than 30 weight percent of water or alcohol, the coating layer of the vanadium pentoxide solution becomes undesirably thick.
      <br/>
      A sputtering technique, a chemical vapor deposition (CVD) technique, a dip coating technique and other general-purpose coating techniques may be employed for the coating use.
      <br/>
      Among the techniques, the dip coating technique may be preferably used for coating the metallic alkoxide solution onto the powder.
    </p>
    <p num="12">
      The vanadium pentoxide solution-coated powder is then heat-treated at temperatures ranged from 100 to 1000 (degree)  C. for 1 to 20 hours under an oxidation atmosphere where dry air or oxygen is blowing.
      <br/>
      As a result, a vanadium pentoxide-coated active material is prepared.
      <br/>
      When the heat-treating temperature is lower than 100 (degree)  C., the vanadium pentoxide solution coated on the powder is not crystallized so that it prohibits free movement of lithium ions in the active material.
    </p>
    <p num="13">
      The vanadium pentoxide formed on the surface of the power may be derived from a single source of the vanadium pentoxide solution or composite sources of manganese of lithiated transition metal compound and the vanadium pentoxide solution.
      <br/>
      It is preferable that the thickness of the vanadium pentoxide layer reaches up to 1 to 100 nm.
    </p>
    <p num="14">
      This vanadium pentoxide coating method may be also applied to cobalt-based active material such as LiCoO2 and LiCo1-x Mx O2 where x &gt;= 0 and M is metal, and nickel-based active material such as LiNiO2, LiNi1-x Mx O2 where x &gt;= 0 and M is metal.
      <br/>
      However, in these applications, cobalt or nickel is liable to elute to an electrolyte.
    </p>
    <p num="15">The following examples further illustrate the present invention.</p>
    <p num="16">EXAMPLE 1</p>
    <p num="17">
      A vanadium pentoxide (V2 O5) solution was prepared by dissolving a 1 g of vanadium pentoxide powder in per 100 g of distilled water.
      <br/>
      The 50 ml of vanadium pentoxide solution was then mixed with per a 100 g of LiMn2 O4 powder such that an overall surface of the power became wet sufficiently by the solution, and dried.
      <br/>
      Thereafter, the dried mixture was heat-treated at about 600 (degree)  C. for about 10 hours under a dry air atmosphere to thereby prepare a vanadium pentoxide-coated active material.
      <br/>
      Then, the active material was mixed with Super P carbon for a conductive agent, KF-1300 polyvinylidene fluoride for a binder and N-methylpyrrolidone for a solvent to prepare an active material slurry.
      <br/>
      The slurry is cast into a tape shape to act as a positive electrode.
      <br/>
      The positive electrode is then assembled with a lithium metal foil for an opposite pole by using a lithium salt solution for an electrolyte to thereby fabricate a coin cell-type half cell.
      <br/>
      The lithium salt solution contained 1:1 volume ratio of ethylene carbonate and dimethyl carbonate for a solvent and LIPF6 for a solute.
    </p>
    <p num="18">EXAMPLE 2</p>
    <p num="19">The positive electrode preparing procedure was performed in the same way as in Example 1 with the exception that the heat-treating operation was performed at about 200 (degree)  C. A coin-type half cell was fabricated with the resulting positive electrode in combination with other components as described in Example 1.</p>
    <p num="20">EXAMPLE 3</p>
    <p num="21">
      A vanadium pentoxide (V2 O5) solution was prepared by dissolving a 1 g of vanadium pentoxide powder in per 100 g of distilled water.
      <br/>
      The 50 ml of vanadium pentoxide solution was then mixed with per a 100 g of Lix Mn2-y Aly O4-z Fz powder where 0&lt;x &lt;= 1.5, 0.05 &lt;= y &lt;= 0.3, z &lt;= 1.0 (Bell Communication Research, Inc.) such that an overall surface of the power became wet sufficiently by the solution, and dried.
      <br/>
      Thereafter, the dried mixture was heat-treated at about 200 (degree)  C. for about 10 hours under a dry air atmosphere to thereby prepare a vanadium pentoxide-coated active material.
      <br/>
      Then, the active material was mixed with Super P carbon for a conductive agent, KF-1300 polyvinylidene fluoride for a binder and N-methylpyrrolidone for a solvent to prepare an active material slurry.
      <br/>
      The slurry is cast into a tape shape to act as a positive electrode.
      <br/>
      The positive electrode is then assembled with a lithium metal foil for an opposite pole by using a lithium salt solution for an electrolyte to thereby fabricate a coin cell-type half cell.
      <br/>
      The lithium salt solution contained 1:1 volume ratio of ethylene carbonate and dimethyl carbonate for a solvent and LiPF6 for a solute.
    </p>
    <p num="22">EXAMPLE 4</p>
    <p num="23">The positive electrode preparing procedure was performed in the same way as in Example 3 with the exception that the heat-treating operation was performed at about 600 (degree)  C. A coin-type half cell was fabricated with the resulting positive electrode in combination with other components as described in Example 3.</p>
    <p num="24">COMPARATIVE EXAMPLE 1</p>
    <p num="25">
      The positive electrode preparing procedure was performed in the same way as in Example 1 with the exception that the LiMn2 O4 powder was directly used for the active material without the vanadium pentoxide coating operation.
      <br/>
      A coin-type half cell was fabricated with the resulting positive electrode in combination with other components as described in Example 1.
    </p>
    <p num="26">COMPARATIVE EXAMPLE 2</p>
    <p num="27">
      The positive electrode preparing procedure was performed in the same way as in Example 3 with the exception that the Lix Mn2-y Aly O4-z Fz powder was directly used for the active material without the vanadium pentoxide coating operation.
      <br/>
      A coin-type half cell was fabricated with the resulting positive electrode in combination with other components as described in Example 3.
    </p>
    <p num="28">
      The coin type cells fabricated according to Example 1 and Comparative Example 1 were charged and discharged at 25 (degree)  C. from 0.1 C to 1 C rate over the voltage window between 4.3V and 3.0V. The charge and discharge characteristics of the cells in the early cycles were illustrated in FIG. 1.
      <br/>
      Further, the cycle life characteristics of the cells were illustrated in FIG. 2.
      <br/>
      In each of the figures, the charge and discharge characteristic of the cell according to Example 1 is indicated by a parenthesized alphabetic symbol "(a)" and that of the cell according to Comparative Example 1 is indicated by another symbol "(b)". As shown in FIGS. 1 and 2, the cell according to Example 1 exhibited a slightly lower specific capacity but a better cycle life characteristic at ambient temperatures than the cell according to Comparative Example 1.
      <br/>
      In addition, even when the charge and discharge operations of the cells are cycled at a high temperature of about 50 (degree)  C., the cell according to Example 1, as shown in FIG. 3, exhibited a far better cycle life characteristic than the cell according to Comparative Example 1.
      <br/>
      It is presumed that the good cycle life characteristic of the cell is resulted because the vanadium pentoxide layer coated on the surface of the manganese-based active material component prevents elution of manganese to the electrolyte.
      <br/>
      The cells fabricated according to Examples 2 to 4 also exhibited the desired performance characteristic similar to that of Example 1.
    </p>
    <p num="29">
      Meanwhile, a secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) analysis was performed with respect to the positive active material prepared according to Example 1 to measure the component distribution ratio.
      <br/>
      The result was illustrated in FIG. 4.
      <br/>
      In the figure, the relative intensity of the vanadium component is indicated by a parenthesized alphabetic symbol "(a)" and that of the manganese component is indicated by another symbol "(b)". As shown in FIG. 4, it could be known that the vanadium component existed more in the surface portion of the active material and the manganese component existed more in the center portion of the active material.
      <br/>
      This proved that the overall surface of LiMn2 O4 was completely coated with vanadium pentoxide.
    </p>
    <p num="30">As described above, the positive active material for rechargeable lithium batteries has a good high-temperature cycle life characteristic.</p>
