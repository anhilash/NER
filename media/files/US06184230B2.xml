      An anti-Helicobacter pylori pharmaceutical composition containing a 1-hydroxy-3-methyl-quinolone derivative represented by the following formula (I)or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof as an active ingredient.Since it shows antibacterial action upon Helicobacter pylori, this invention is effective for the treatment or prevention of infection with Helicobacter pylori in human and infection with related bacteria belonging to the genus Helicobacter in animals.
      <br/>
      Also, the anti-Helicobacter pylori pharmaceutical composition of the present invention is useful for the prevention (including prevention of relapse) or treatment of diseases of the upper digestive organs, such as peptic ulcers (e.g., gastric and duodenal ulcers), inflammations (e.g., acute or chronic gastritis or duodenitis) and gastric cancer, as well as MALT (mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue) lymphoma or chronic heart diseases.

    <heading>TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
    <p num="1">
      This invention relates to a medicament, particularly an anti-Helicobacter pylori pharmaceutical composition.
      <br/>
      In particular, it relates to an anti-Helicobacter pylori agent which is useful for the treatment and prevention of various diseases caused by the infection with Helicobacter pylori.
    </p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND ART</heading>
    <p num="2">
      Helicobacter pylori is a pathogenic bacterium discovered in 1983, which is regarded as the cause of diseases at the upper digestive organs, such as peptic ulcers (e.g., gastric and duodenal ulcers), inflammations (e.g., gastritis) and gastric cancer, and of MALT (mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue) lymphoma or as a background pathogenic factor of chronic heart diseases.
      <br/>
      Studies on the treatment of Helicobacter pylori infection are active now, and a large number of therapeutic methods have been reported, including those for removing the bacterium or those for preventing relapse, as described below.
      <br/>
      The examples include a single agent administration method using bismuth, an antibiotic, a proton pump inhibitor (PPI), an antitumor agent, or the like and a multiple agent combination method (two agent combination or three agent combination) which uses a combination of these agents, etc. ("Internal Medicine", Special Edition, vol. 78, no. 1 (1996), published by Nankodo).
      <br/>
      However, these therapeutic methods have many problems to be solved, such as high frequency of administration times, requirement of administration in a dose larger than the usual dose in some cases, onset of diarrhea or constipation caused by the drug administration and generation of resistant strains.
    </p>
    <p num="3">
      The compound related to the present invention as a substance useful as an anti-Helicobacter pylori pharmaceutical composition, is disclosed in JP-A-7-189 (the term "JP-A" as used herein means an "unexamined published Japanese patent application") as a substance YL-02729S, and its use is particularly antibacterial activity upon methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
      <br/>
      Said patent application does not suggest or report about antibacterial activity of the substance YL-02729S upon Helicobacter pylori.
    </p>
    <heading>DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="4">The inventors of the present invention have carried out extensive studies on the aforementioned substance YL-02729S and, as a result, found that it has an excellent anti-Helicobacter pylori activity and also that said substance has high selectivity and does not exert influences upon other bacteria.</p>
    <p num="5">The following describes the present invention in detail.</p>
    <p num="6">The present invention relates to an anti-Helicobacter pylori pharmaceutical composition containing a 1-hydroxy-3-methyl-quinolone derivative represented by the following formula (I)  (Chemical Structure image '2' not included in text)</p>
    <p num="7">or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof as an active ingredient, preferably an anti-Helicobacter pylori pharmaceutical composition containing 1-hydroxy-2-(2-trans-nonenyl)-3-methyl-4(1H)-quinolone or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof as an active ingredient, and to the use of a 1-hydroxy-3-methyl-quinolone derivative represented by the following formula (I)  (Chemical Structure image '3' not included in text)</p>
    <p num="8">or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof for the production of an anti-Helicobacter pylori agent.</p>
    <p num="9">
      The present invention also relates to the use of an anti-Helicobacter pylori pharmaceutical composition containing a 1-hydroxy-3-methyl-quinolone derivative represented by the formula (I) or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof as an active ingredient for the prevention or treatment of Helicobacter pylori infection, to a method for the administration of the substance of formula (I) and other agent, preferably an antibiotic, an acid-related agent or an H2 blocker, simultaneously or at an interval and to the use thereof for the prevention of relapse of diseases caused by Helicobacter pylori infection.
      <br/>
      Also included in the present invention is a prodrug of the substance of formula (I) obtained by a usual means.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      Since the active ingredient (I) of the anti-Helicobacter pylori pharmaceutical composition of the present invention has double bonds, cis isomer and trans isomer, as well as tautomers exist therein.
      <br/>
      Existence of the tautomers is disclosed in JP-A-7-189 as follows.  (Chemical Structure image '4' not included in text)
    </p>
    <p num="11">
      Examples of the pharmaceutically acceptable salt include acid addition salts with inorganic acids or organic acids, of which pharmaceutically acceptable salts are desirable.
      <br/>
      Illustrative examples of such salts include acid addition salts with mineral acids such as hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, hydroiodic acid, sulfuric acid, nitric acid and phosphoric acid, with organic acids such as formic acid, acetic acid, propionic acid, oxalic acid, malonic acid, succinic acid, fumaric acid, maleic acid, lactic acid, malic acid, tartaric acid, citric acid, methanesulfonic acid and ethanesulfonic acid or with acidic amino acids such as aspartic acid and glutamic acid.
      <br/>
      Hydrates and various solvates of the active ingredient are also included in the present invention.
      <br/>
      Also, said active ingredient exists in polymorphic forms in some cases, and all of such crystal forms are included in the present invention.
    </p>
    <p num="12">
