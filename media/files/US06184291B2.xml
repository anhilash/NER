    <heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">
      This invention relates to thermoplastic elastomeric compositions containing substantially inert thermoelastic extenders.
      <br/>
      In particular, the invention relates to thermoplastic elastomeric compositions comprising block copolymers in blend combination with substantially inert ethylene interpolymers.
    </p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="3">
      Various thermoplastic elastomeric compositions are well-known and include thermoplastic urethanes, thermoplastic polyesters, amorphous polypropylenes, chlorinated polyethylenes, ethylene/propylene rubbers, crosslinked and uncrosslinked EPDM (ethylene-propylene-nonconjugated diene monomer) systems, and styrene block copolymers.
      <br/>
      Styrene block copolymers, which are sold under the brand names of Vector, Kraton and Solprene as supplied respectively by Dexco Polymers, Shell Oil Company and Phillips Petroleum, are considered to be very versatile thermoplastic elastomers.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      Styrene block copolymers are also recognized as strong, flexible high performance elastomers that do not require vulcanization and yet exhibit excellent elasticity over a wide range of service temperatures.
      <br/>
      Due to their unique molecular structure and versatility, styrene block copolymers are used in a wide spectrum of enduses such as moldable goods, automotive interior and exterior parts, medical devices, and the like.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      Styrene block copolymers are available with linear, diblock, triblock and radial molecular structures.
      <br/>
      Each polymer molecule consists of a styrenic block segment and a rubber monomer block segment.
      <br/>
      The rubber segment may consist of saturated or unsaturated monomer units such as ethylene/butene and ethylene/propylene, or butadiene and isoprene, respectively.
      <br/>
      Styrene block copolymers having saturated rubber monomer segments typically exhibit improved thermal, oxidative and processing stability, better weather resistance, and higher temperature serviceability when compared to copolymers consisting of unsaturated rubber monomer segments.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      Although styrene block copolymers are very useful, they have a number of deficiencies.
      <br/>
      These materials are relatively expensive and due to their fairly difficult manufacturing requirements are often in short supply.
      <br/>
      Moreover, due to the inability of their particles or pellets to expediently melt and fuse together with the application of heat, styrene block copolymers with saturated rubber monomer segments are fairly difficult to formulate and process.
      <br/>
      Processing in conventional equipment such as, for example, a Banbury mixer, is typically characterized by an initial induction or delay period which adds to processing costs.
      <br/>
      As another disadvantage, this delay, which in effect constitutes an additional heat history, can contribute to the overall thermal and processing instability of the copolymer.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      Because of high material costs, shortages and processing difficulties, it is desirable to provide blend components that can extend available quantities of styrene block copolymers without substantially altering the key elastic properties of the latter.
      <br/>
      It is also desirable to provide component materials that function as processing aids or fusion promoters whereby the delay times associated with thermally processing styrene block copolymers having saturated rubber monomer segments can be substantially reduced.
      <br/>
      Further, it is desirable to improve the properties of block copolymers having unsaturated rubber monomer block segments without the higher manufacturing costs typically associated with block copolymers having saturated rubber monomer segments.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      There has been a long felt need to mitigate the above difficulties associated with conventional thermoplastic elastomeric materials but, unfortunately, prior art efforts to do so have not been entirely successful.
      <br/>
      Prior art proposals to facilitate the use of ordinary thermoelastic materials tend to involve curing steps or multicomponent compositions with extensive formulating requirements.
      <br/>
      For example, Shell Oil Company in its Kraton brochure indicates the Kraton materials are highly extendable presumably by specific combinations of involving fillers, resins and oils.
      <br/>
      On page 3 of the brochure, Kraton D compounds and Kraton G compounds are said to contain other suitable ingredients.
      <br/>
      Further, where other ingredients are used, including fillers and oils in combination or alone, it is expected that special handling and equipment would be required for uniform admixing with solid block copolymer resins.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      Where ordinary thermoelastic materials, such as, for example, ethylene/vinyl acetate (EVA) copolymers, are used as single-component extenders for block copolymers, the elastic, rheological, stability or hardness properties of the final composition tend to vary substantially relative to neat compositions of the respective block copolymer.
      <br/>
      Still other prior art disclosures involving ethylene/ ALPHA -olefin interpolymers in combination with block copolymers such as, for example, U.S. Pat. No. 5,272,236, which discloses blends of substantially linear ethylene interpolymers and styrene butadiene copolymers, and Plastics Technology, August 1994, page 54, which mentions similar blends useful for molded goods, do not teach or render obvious the specific requirements that enable the use of such materials as substantially inert extenders, nor disclose the surprising benefits that can be realized by doing so.
    </p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="10">
      It has been discovered that the combination of at least one block copolymer and with specified amounts of at least one particular ethylene interpolymer yields a thermoplastic elastomeric composition having essentially the same elastic and hardness properties as the block copolymer portion of the composition.
      <br/>
      The particular effect of the ethylene interpolymer can be described as a substantially inert thermoelastic extender of the styrene block copolymer.
    </p>
    <p num="11">Thus one aspect of the present invention is a thermoplastic elastomeric composition comprising (a) from about 50 to about 99 percent by weight of the total composition of at least one block copolymer and (b) from about 1 to about 50 percent by weight of the total composition of at least one thermoelastic ethylene interpolymer having a density from about 0.855 g/cc to about 0.905 g/cc, wherein the thermoelastic ethylene interpolymer in the amount employed is a substantially inert thermoelastic extender of the block copolymer and the composition is further characterized as having:</p>
    <p num="12">
      i. storage moduli throughout the range of -26 (degree)  C. to 24 (degree)  C. of less than about 3.5 * 109 dynes/cm2,
      <br/>
      ii. a ratio of storage modulus at -26 (degree)  C. to storage modulus at 24 (degree)  C. of less than about 4, and
      <br/>
      iii. storage moduli at -26 (degree)  C. and 24 (degree)  C. about 0.2 to about 3 times higher than the storage moduli at -26 (degree)  C. and 24 (degree)  C., respectively, of the neat block copolymer portion of the composition.
    </p>
    <p num="13">Another aspect of the present invention is a method of making a fabricated article in the form of a film, fiber and molding from the novel thermoplastic elastomeric composition.</p>
    <p num="14">In still another aspect, the present invention provides a fabricated article in the form of a film, fiber or molding made from the novel thermoplastic elastomeric composition.</p>
    <p num="15">
      In addition to utility as a substantially unaltered neat block copolymer, the novel composition also exhibits the benefit of improved processability.
      <br/>
      Particular ethylene interpolymers, functioning as fusion promoters and processing aids, substantially reduce the processing delay times characteristic of styrene block copolymers having saturated rubber monomer units.
    </p>
    <p num="16">As still another benefit of the present invention, the novel composition also exhibits improved stability when exposed to stresses such as heat, shear and ultraviolet radiation relative to a comparative styrene block copolymer having unsaturated rubber monomer units.</p>
    <p num="17">The functioning of select ethylene interpolymers as substantially inert thermoelastic extenders is surprising since, although such thermoelastic polymers are generally elastic, their properties can differ substantially from those of block copolymers.</p>
    <p num="18">
      While the invention is not limited to any particular theory of operation, the surprising enhancements are believed to be due to the unique compatibility obtainable with elastic and, preferably, compositionally uniform ethylene interpolymers, particularly homogeneously branched ethylene interpolymers.
      <br/>
      Such utility and improvements are not obtainable with ordinary thermoelastic materials such as, for example, ethylene/vinyl acetate (EVA) copolymers even at high vinyl acetate levels, nor with ethylene interpolymers having polymer densities substantially greater than about 0.905 g/cc.

      The terms "ultra low density polyethylene" (ULDPE), "very low density polyethylene" (VLDPE) and "linear very low density polyethylene" (LVLDPE) have been used interchangeably in the polyethylene art to designate the polymer subset of linear low density polyethylenes having a density less than or equal to about 0.915 g/cc. The term "linear low density polyethylene" (LLDPE) is then applied to those linear polyethylenes having a density above about 0.915 g/cc. Only ethylene/ ALPHA -olefin interpolymers having a polymer density less than about 0.905 g/cc are a part of the present invention.

      The terms "heterogeneous" and "heterogeneously branched" are used herein in the conventional sense in reference to a linear ethylene interpolymer having a comparatively low short chain branching distribution index.
      <br/>
      The short chain branching distribution index (SCBDI) is defined as the weight percent of the polymer molecules having a comonomer content within 50 percent of the median total molar comonomer content.
      <br/>
      The short chain branching distribution index of polyolefins that are crystallizable from solutions can be determined by well-known temperature rising elution fractionation techniques, such as those described by Wild et al., Journal of Polymer Science, Poly.

      Heterogeneously branched linear ethylene interpolymers and particularly, heterogeneously branched linear ethylene/ ALPHA -olefin interpolymers typically have a SCBDI less than about 30 percent.

      Suitable unsaturated comonomers useful for polymerizing with ethylene to prepare suitable heterogeneously branched linear ethylene interpolymers include, for example, ethylenically unsaturated monomers, conjugated or non-conjugated dienes, polyenes, etc.

      Examples of such comonomers include C3 -C20  ALPHA -olefins as propylene, isobutylene, 1-butene, 1-hexene, 4-methyl-1-pentene, 1-heptene, 1-octene, 1-nonene, 1-decene, and the like.
      <br/>
      Preferred comonomers include propylene, 1-butene, 1-hexene, 4-methyl-1-pentene and 1-octene, and 1-octene is especially preferred.

      Other suitable monomers include styrene, halo- or alkyl-substituted styrenes, tetrafluoroethylene, vinylbenzocyclobutane, 1,4-hexadiene, 1,7-octadiene, and cycloalkenes, e.g., cyclopentene, cyclohexene and cyclooctene.
      <br/>
      The interpolymer can be amorphous or semi-crystalline with a random, atactic, isotactic or syndiotactic molecular structure, but preferably the interpolymer is a random semi-crystalline polymer.
      <br/>
      Preferred heterogeneously branched linear ethylene interpolymers are ethylene interpolymerized with at least one C3 -C20  ALPHA -olefin and most preferably, ethylene/1-octene copolymers.

    <p num="33">Commercial examples of heterogeneously branched linear interpolymers suitable for use in the present invention include ATTANE ULDPE polymers supplied by the Dow Chemical Company and FLEXOMER VLDPE polymers supplied by Union Carbide Corporation.</p>
    <p num="34">The term "homogeneously branched" is defined herein to mean that (1) the  ALPHA -olefin comonomer(s) is (are) randomly distributed within a given molecule, (2) substantially all of the copolymer molecules have the same ethylene-to-comonomer ratio, (3) the interpolymer is characterized by a narrow short chain branching distribution where the short chain branching distribution index is greater than 30 percent, more preferably greater than 50 percent, and (4) the interpolymer essentially lacks a measurable high density (crystalline) polymer fraction as measured by known fractionation techniques such as, for example, a method that involves polymer fractional elutions as a function of temperature.</p>
    <p num="35">
      The homogeneously branched ethylene interpolymers for useful admixing with block copolymers can be linear ethylene interpolymers, or preferably, substantially linear ethylene interpolymers.
      <br/>
      Both the substantially linear and the homogeneously branched linear ethylene interpolymers are ethylene interpolymers having a short chain branching distribution index (SCBDI) greater than about 30 percent.
      <br/>
      The substantially linear interpolymers have a single melting points as opposed to traditional Ziegler polymerized polymers having two or more melting points as determined using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC).
    </p>
    <p num="36">
      The homogeneously branched linear ethylene interpolymers useful for admixing with block copolymers to prepare the thermoplastic elastomeric composition of the present invention are ethylene polymers which do not have long chain branching, but do have short chain branches derived from the comonomer polymerized into the interpolymer which are homogeneously distributed both within the same polymer chain and between different polymer chains.
      <br/>
      That is, homogeneously branched linear ethylene interpolymers have an absence of long chain branching just as is the case for the linear low density polyethylene polymers or linear high density polyethylene polymers made using uniform branching distribution polymerization processes as described, for example, by Elston in U.S. Pat. No. 3,645,992, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.
    </p>
    <p num="37">
      The homogeneously branched linear ethylene interpolymers are not high pressure, free-radical initiated polyethylene which is well-known to those skilled in the art to have numerous long chain branches, nor are they traditional heterogeneously branched linear low density polyethylene.

      Suitable unsaturated comonomers useful for polymerizing with ethylene to prepare suitable homogeneously branched linear ethylene interpolymers include, for example, ethylenically unsaturated monomers, conjugated or non-conjugated dienes, polyenes, etc.

      <br/>
      Typically, the homogeneously branched linear ethylene interpolymer is a copolymer, wherein ethylene is copolymerized with one C3 -C20  ALPHA -olefin.

      Substantially linear ethylene interpolymers are a completely different class of homogeneously branched ethylene polymers.
      <br/>
      They differ substantially from the well-known class of conventional homogeneously branched linear ethylene interpolymers described by Elston in U.S. Pat. No. 3,645,992, and moreover, they are not in the same class as conventional heterogeneous Ziegler polymerized linear ethylene polymers (e.g., ultra low density polyethylene, linear low density polyethylene or high density polyethylene made, for example, using the technique disclosed by Anderson et al. in U.S. Pat. No. 4,076,698), nor are they in the same class as high pressure, free-radical initiated highly branched high pressure polyethylenes such as, for example, low density polyethylene (LDPE), ethylene-acrylic acid (EAA) copolymers and ethylene-vinyl acetate (EVA) copolymers.
    </p>
    <p num="42">
      The substantially linear ethylene interpolymers useful in this invention have excellent processability, even though they have relatively narrow molecular weight distribution.
      <br/>
      Surprisingly, the melt flow ratio (I10 /I2) of the substantially linear ethylene interpolymers can be varied widely and essentially independently of the polydispersity index (i.e., the molecular weight distribution, Mw /Mn).
      <br/>
      This surprising behavior is completely contra to homogeneously branched linear ethylene interpolymers such as those described, for example, by Elston in U.S. Pat. No. 3,645,992 and heterogeneously branched conventional Ziegler polymerized linear polyethylene interpolymers such as those described, for example, by Anderson et al. in U.S. Pat. No. 4,076,698. Both linear ethylene interpolymer types have rheological properties such that as the polydispersity index increases, the I10 /I2 value also increases.

    <p num="43">The term "substantially linear" means that the polymer backbone is substituted with about 0.01 long chain branch/1000 carbons to about 3 long chain branches/1000 carbons, more preferably from about 0.01 long chain branches/1000 carbons to about 1 long chain branch/1000 carbons, and especially from about 0.05 long chain branch/1000 carbons to about 1 long chain branch/1000 carbons.</p>
    <p num="44">The term "long chain branching" is defined herein as a chain length of at least about 6 carbons, above which the length cannot be distinguished using 13 C nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, yet the long chain branch can be about the same length as the length of the polymer backbone.</p>

      <br/>
      Preferred substantially linear ethylene interpolymers for use in the present invention are interpolymers of ethylene with at least one C3 -C20  ALPHA -olefin and/or C4 -C18 diolefin.

      Copolymers of ethylene and a C3 -C20  ALPHA -olefin of are especially preferred.
    </p>
    <p num="47">
      The density of the ethylene interpolymers for use in the present invention, as measured in accordance with ASTM D-792, is generally in the range from about 0.855 grams/cubic centimeter (g/cc) to about 0.905 g/cc, preferably about 0.86 g/cc to about 0.89 g/cc, more preferably about 0.865 g/cc to about 0.885 g/cc. The density limitation is critical for obtaining the required compatibility and inertness of the ethylene interpolymer.
      <br/>
      At densities above 0.905 g/cc, ethylene interpolymers are generally non-elastomeric.
      <br/>
      At densities below 0.855 g/cc, the interpolymer is fairly tacky and difficult to process and handle.
    </p>
    <p num="48">
      The molecular weight of the ethylene interpolymers is conveniently indicated using a melt index measurement according to ASTM D-1238, Condition 190 (degree)  C./2.16 kilogram (kg), formerly known as "Condition E" and also known as I2.
      <br/>
      Melt index is inversely proportional to the molecular weight of the polymer.
      <br/>
      Thus, the higher the molecular weight, the lower the melt index, although the relationship is not linear.
      <br/>
      The melt index for the ethylene interpolymers useful herein is generally from about 0.01 gram/10 minutes (g/10 min.) to about 100 g/10 min., preferably from about 0.1 g/10 min. to about 40 g/10 min., and especially from about 1 g/10 min. to about 10 g/10 min.
    </p>
    <p num="49">
      Other measurements useful in characterizing the molecular weight of ethylene interpolymers involve melt index determinations with higher weights, such as, for common example, ASTM D-1238, Condition 190 (degree)  C./10 kg (formerly known as "Condition N" and also known as I10). "Melt flow ratio" is defined herein as the ratio of a higher weight melt index determination to a lower weight determination, and for measured I10 and the I2 melt index values, the melt flow ratio is conveniently designated as I10 /I2.
      <br/>
      The I10 /I2 of both heterogeneous and homogeneously branched linear ethylene interpolymers is generally greater than about7.

    <p num="50">
      Unlike the linear ethylene interpolymers of the present invention which possess no substantial long chain branching, for the substantially linear ethylene interpolymers used herein, the melt flow ratio actually indicates the degree of long chain branching, i.e., the higher the I10 /I2 melt flow ratio, the more long chain branching in the polymer.
      <br/>
      The I10 /I2 ratio of the substantially linear ethylene interpolymers is preferably at least about 5.63, and especially from about 5.63 to about 20, and most especially from about 6 to about 15.

      The "rheological processing index" (PI) which is defined herein as the apparent viscosity in kpoise of a polymer measured by a gas extrusion rheometer (GER), can also be used to distinguish substantially linear ethylene interpolymers.
      <br/>
      The gas extrusion rheometer is described by M. Shida, R. N. Shroff and L. V. Cancio in Polymer Engineering Science, Vol. 17, No. 11, p. 770 (1977), and in "Rheometers for Molten Plastics" by John Dealy, published by Van Nostrand Reinhold Co. (1982) on pp. 97-99, both publications of which are incorporated by reference herein in their entirety.
      <br/>
      GER experiments are performed at a temperature of 190 (degree)  C., at nitrogen pressures between 250 to 5500 psig (17-379 bars) using about a 0.754 mm diameter, 20:1 L/D die with an entrance angle of 180 (degree) . For the substantially linear ethylene polymers used herein, the PI is the apparent viscosity (in kpoise) of a material measured by GER at an apparent shear stress of 2.15 * 106 dyne/cm2.
      <br/>
      The unique substantially linear ethylene interpolymers described herein preferably have a PI in the range of about 0.01 kpoise to about 50 kpoise, preferably about 15 kpoise or less.
      <br/>
      The substantially linear ethylene interpolymers used herein have a PI less than or equal to about 70% of the PI of a comparative linear ethylene interpolymer (for example, a homogeneously branched linear interpolymer as described by Elston in U.S. Pat. No. 3,645,992, or supplied by Exxon Chemical Company as EXACT, or supplied by Mitsui Chemical Company as TAFMER) having about the same I2 and Mw /Mn.
    </p>
    <p num="52">
      To more fully characterize the unique rheological behavior of substantially linear ethylene interpolymers, S. Lai and G. W. Knight recently introduced (ANTEC '93 Proceedings, INSITE (tm)  Technology Polyolefins (ITP)--New Rules in the Structure/Rheology Relationship of Ethylene  ALPHA -Olefin Copolymers, New Orleans, La., May 1993) another rheological measurement, the Dow Rheology Index (DRI), which expresses a polymer's "normalized relaxation time as the result of long chain branching." DRI ranges from 0 for polymers which do not have any measurable long chain branching (e.g., TAFMER and EXACT products) to about 15 and is independent of melt index.
      <br/>
      In general, for low to medium pressure ethylene polymers (particularly at lower densities) DRI provides improved correlations to melt elasticity and high shear flowability relative to correlations of the same attempted with melt flow ratios, and for the substantially linear ethylene interpolymers of this invention, DRI is preferably at least about 0.1, and especially at least about 0.5, and most especially at least 0.8. DRI can be calculated from the equation:
      <br/>
      DRI=(3652879* TAU o1.00649 / ETA o -1)/10
    </p>
    <p num="53">
      where  TAU o is the characteristic relaxation time of the material and  ETA o is the zero shear viscosity of the material.
      <br/>
      Both  TAU o and  ETA o are the "best fit" values to the Cross equation, i.e.
      <br/>
      ETA / ETA o =1/(1+( GAMMA * TAU o)1-n)
    </p>
    <p num="54">
      where n is the power law index of the material, and  ETA  and  GAMMA  are the measured viscosity and shear rate, respectively.
      <br/>
      Baseline determination of viscosity and shear rate data are obtained using a Rheometrics Mechanical Spectrometer (RMS-800) under dynamic sweep mode from 0.1 to 100 radians/second at 160 (degree)  C. and a Gas Extrusion Rheometer (GER) at extrusion pressures from 1,000 psi to 5,000 psi (corresponding shear stress from 0.086 to 0.43 MPa) using a 0.754 millimeter diameter, 20:1 L/D die at 190 (degree)  C. Specific material determinations can be performed from 140 to 190 (degree)  C. as required to accommodate melt index variations.

    <p num="55">
      In addition to the onset of draw resonance and various rheological characterizations, ethylene polymers can also be distinguished by melt flow consequences that are manifested as solid state surface defects.
      <br/>
      Unlike draw resonance which is observed during drawing and pertains to irregularities in the extrudate dimension, an apparent shear stress versus apparent shear rate plot is used to identify the "melt fracture" phenomena which pertains to surface irregularities.
      <br/>
      According to Ramamurthy in the Journal of Rheology, 30(2), 337-357, 1986, above a certain critical shear rate (in contrast to a critical draw rate for the draw resonance phenomena), the observed extrudate irregularities may be broadly classified into two main types: surface melt fracture and gross melt fracture.
    </p>
    <p num="56">
      Surface melt fracture occurs under apparently steady flow conditions and ranges in detail from loss of specular film gloss to the more severe form of "sharkskin." In this disclosure, the onset of surface melt fracture (OSMF) is characterized at the beginning of losing extrudate gloss at which the surface roughness of the extrudate can only be detected by 40 * magnification.
      <br/>
      The critical shear rate at the onset of surface melt fracture for the substantially linear ethylene interpolymers is at least 50 percent greater than the critical shear rate at the onset of surface melt fracture of a comparative linear ethylene interpolymer (for example, a homogeneously branched linear interpolymer as described by Elston in U.S. Pat. No. 3,645,992) having about the same I2 and Mw /Mn.
    </p>
    <p num="57">
      Gross melt fracture occurs at unsteady extrusion flow conditions, and ranges in detail from regular (alternating rough and smooth, helical, etc.) to random distortions.
      <br/>
      For commercial acceptability, (e.g., for use as films, coatings and moldings), surface defects should be minimal, if not absent, for good film/molding quality and overall properties.
      <br/>
      The critical shear stress at the onset of gross melt fracture for the substantially linear ethylene interpolymers used in the present invention is greater than about 4 * 106 dynes/cm2.
      <br/>
      The critical shear rate at the onset of surface melt fracture (OSMF) and the onset of gross melt fracture (OGMF) will be used herein based on the changes of surface roughness and configurations of the extrudates extruded by a GER.

      The distribution of comonomer branches for ethylene interpolymers is characterized by its SCBDI (Short Chain Branch Distribution Index) or CDBI (Composition Distribution Branch Index) and is defined as the weight percent of the polymer molecules having a comonomer content within 50 percent of the median total molar comonomer content.
      <br/>
      The CDBI of a polymer is readily calculated from data obtained from techniques known in the art, such as, for example, temperature rising elution fractionation (abbreviated herein as "TREF") as described, for example, by Wild et al., Journal of Polymer Science, Poly.

      The SCBDI or CDBI for the substantially linear ethylene interpolymer and the homogeneously branched linear ethylene interpolymer used in the present invention is preferably greater than about 30 percent and especially greater than about 50 percent.
    </p>
    <p num="59">
      The substantially linear ethylene interpolymer and the homogeneously branched linear ethylene interpolymer used in this invention essentially lack a measurable "high density" fraction as measured by the TREF technique.
      <br/>
      These homogeneously branched ethylene interpolymers do not contain a polymer fraction with a degree of branching less than or equal to 2 methyls/1000 carbons.
    </p>
    <p num="60">
      The "high density polymer fraction" can also be described as a polymer fraction with a degree of branching less than about 2 methyls/1000 carbons.
      <br/>
      Among other benefits, the lack of high density polymer fraction permits enhanced elasticity for the interpolymers themselves and improved compatibility when admixed with the block copolymer of the present invention.
    </p>
    <p num="61">
      The substantially linear ethylene interpolymers are also characterized by a single DSC melting peak.
      <br/>
      However, for substantially linear ethylene interpolymers having a density in the range of about 0.875 g/cc to about 0.905 g/cc, the single melting peak may show, depending on DSC equipment sensitivity, a "shoulder" or a "hump" on it's low melting side that constitutes less than 12 percent, typically, less than 9 percent, and more typically less than of 6 percent of the total heat of fusion of the polymer.
      <br/>
      This artifact is believed to be due to intra-polymer chain variations and is discerned on the basis of the slope of the single melting peak varying monotonically through the melting region of the artifact.
      <br/>
      Such artifacts occur within 34 (degree)  C., typically within 27 (degree)  C., and more typically within 20 (degree)  C. of the melting point of the single melting peak.
      <br/>
      The single melting peak is determined using a differential scanning calorimeter standardized with indium and deionized water.
      <br/>
      The method involves about 5-7 mg sample sizes, a "first heat" to about 180 (degree)  C. which is held for 4 minutes, a cool down at 10 (degree) /min. to -30 (degree)  C. which is held for 3 minutes, and heat up at 10 (degree)  C./min. to 140 (degree)  C. for the "second heat".
      <br/>
      The single melting peak is taken from the "second heat" heat flow vs. temperature curve.
      <br/>
      Total heat of fusion of the polymer is calculated from the area under the curve.
      <br/>
      The heat of fusion attributable to this artifact, if present, can be determined using an analytical balance and weight-percent calculations.

      The columns are supplied by Polymer Laboratories and are commonly packed with pore sizes of 103, 104, 105 and 106  Angstrom .

      Preferred block copolymers contain hard segments of styrenic type polymers in combination with saturated or unsaturated rubber monomer segments.

      The preparation of the block copolymers useful herein is not the subject of the present invention.
      <br/>
      Methods for the preparation of such block copolymers are known in the art.
      <br/>
      Suitable catalysts for the preparation of useful block copolymers with unsaturated rubber monomer units include lithium based catalysts and especially lithium-alkyls. U.S. Pat. No. 3,595,942 describes suitable methods for hydrogenation of block copolymers with unsaturated rubber monomer units to from block copolymers with saturated rubber monomer units.
      <br/>
      The structure of the polymers is determined by their methods of polymerization.
      <br/>
      For example, linear polymers result by sequential introduction of the desired rubber monomer into the reaction vessel when using such initiators as lithium-alkyls or dilithiostilbene and the like, or by coupling a two segment block copolymer with a difunctional coupling agent.
      <br/>
      Branched structures, on the other hand, may be obtained by the use of suitable coupling agents having a functionality with respect to the block copolymers with unsaturated rubber monomer units of three or more.
      <br/>
      Coupling may be effected with multifunctional coupling agents such as dihaloalkanes or alkenes and divinyl benzene as well as with certain polar compounds such as silicon halides, siloxanes or esters of monohydric alcohols with carboxylic acids.
      <br/>
      The presence of any coupling residues in the polymer may be ignored for an adequate description of the block copolymers forming a part of the composition of this invention.

      The styrenic portion of the block copolymer is preferably a polymer or interpolymer of styrene and its analogs and homologs including  ALPHA -methylstyrene and ring-substituted styrenes, particularly ring-methylated styrenes.

      The proportion of the styrenic blocks is generally between about 8 and 65% by weight of the total weight of the block copolymer.

      Samples for dynamic mechanical studies are prepared in the form of thin films (about 15-20 mil thick) from the Haake blend or from melt pressed pellets of the block copolymers as controls (i.e., no Haake torque exposure).
      <br/>
      The samples are prepared at 190 (degree)  C. and are cooled at 15 (degree)  C./min to ambient room temperature of about 23 (degree)  C.

    <p num="98">Procedure for Dynamic Mechanical and Rheological Measurements:</p>
    <p num="99">
      The dynamic rheological properties of the samples are studied using a Rheometrics RMS-800 rheometer.
      <br/>
      The frequency is varied from 0.1 radians/second to 100 radian/second while the sample/unit temperature is maintained at 190 (degree)  C. in a nitrogen atmosphere.
      <br/>
      A strain of about 15% is also used for the dynamic rheology measurement.
      <br/>
      In a few cases where the viscosity of resins or blend composition are high, the strain is maintained at about 5%.
      <br/>
      According to the Cox-Mertz rule, the complex viscosity versus frequency data measured using the dynamic shear rheology is about equivalent to shear viscosity versus shear rate data, and as such, can provide useful information regarding the rheological properties of the resins and resultant blend compositions.
    </p>
    <p num="100">
      The dynamic mechanical properties of the samples are studied using Rheometrics Solids analyzer RSA-II.
      <br/>
      The dynamic mechanical properties of the sample are measured at 5 (degree)  C. increments in a nitrogen atmosphere over a temperature range of about -120 (degree)  C. to highest possible temperature at which sample either substantially melts or deforms.
      <br/>
      The experiments are conducted at a frequency of 10 radians/second and an initial strain of 7.0 * 10-4. The sample dimensions are measured and are used in the calculations.

      The dynamic mechanical data in FIG. 1 surprisingly reveals that addition of 25 and 50 weight percent ENGAGE EG8200 to VECTOR 8508 does not substantially alter the high temperature serviceability of the VECTOR 8508 block copolymer.
      <br/>
      That is, the neat block copolymer (Example 2) and the blend compositions comprising up to 50 weight percent ENGAGE EG8200 (Examples 1 and 3) maintain good integrity as indicated by a stable storage modulus at temperatures at least up to 50 (degree)  C.).
    </p>
    <p num="106">
      FIG. 2 (which indicates the predicted dynamic mechanical response of the compositions based on weight average contributions of the component materials) and Table 1 show that the ratio of storage modulus at -26 (degree)  C. to storage modulus at 24 (degree)  C. does not increase as rapidly as expected based on weight average contribution of the two components.
      <br/>
      In fact these blend compositions are, surprisingly, more elastic than predicted, especially at a concentration of about 25 weight percent ENGAGE EG8200.
    </p>
    <p num="107">
      Table 1 also indicates that the storage modulus measured at -26 (degree)  C. and 24 (degree)  C. for the 25 weight percent ENGAGE EG8200 blend composition (Example 1) does not change significantly relative to neat block copolymer VECTOR 8508 at the same temperatures.
      <br/>
      The storage modulus at -26 (degree)  C. and 24 (degree)  C. for Examples 1 and 3 are only about 0.42 to about 1.64 times higher than the storage modulus at -26 (degree)  C. and 24 (degree)  C. of neat VECTOR 8508.
      <br/>
      Such storage modulus differences are considered insignificant and, thereby, exemplify effective use of ENGAGE EG8200 as an extender for VECTOR 8508.
    </p>
    <p num="108">A low -26 (degree)  to 24 (degree)  C. storage modulus ratio (i.e., less than about 4) in combination with stable, low storage moduli (i.e., less than about 3.5 * 109 dynes/cm2) over the same temperature range indicates that the composition possesses good elasticity in the range of at least about -26 (degree)  C. to about 24 (degree)  C. This attribute is important for products that must maintain their shape, integrity and performance over the selected temperature range.</p>
    <p num="109">
      Similar to the dynamic mechanical storage modulus results, FIG. 3 indicates the addition of amounts less than about 50 weight percent of ENGAGE EG8200 does not substantially alter the dynamic rheological properties of VECTOR 8508, i.e., the response is characteristic of the block copolymer and not that of the ethylene interpolymer.
      <br/>
      FIG. 3 indicates at low shear rates there is essentially no change in dynamic viscosity relative to the neat block copolymer and at high shears rates, there is only a slight decrease in viscosity, particularly when 25 weight percent of ENGAGE EG8200 is admixed with the block copolymer.
    </p>
    <p num="110">By not substantially altering the high temperature serviceability and dynamic mechanical and rheological properties of VECTOR 8508, these results indicate that ENGAGE EG8200 functions as substantially inert extender in blend combinations with the block copolymers.</p>

      Table 5 below indicates that although ATTANE 4403 does not appear to substantially alter the storage modulus/elasticity of block copolymers, it does substantially alter the hardness of the VECTOR 8508 block copolymer at 25 weight percent addition levels and, as such, like EVA copolymers, is not a substantially inert thermoelastic extender within the purview of the present invention.
      <br/>
      Changes in Shore A hardness greater than about  +- 3 units (as measured by ASTM-D2240) is considered to be a substantial alteration.
      <br/>
      The inability of ATTANE 4203 to perform as an inert extender is believed to be due to its higher polymer density (i.e., 0.905 g/cc).
      <br/>
      Similarly, at least for compositions consisting essentially of block copolymers with unsaturated rubber monomer segments, as the density of the ethylene interpolymer used in the present invention decreases, proportionally higher amounts of the ethylene interpolymer are permissible while still maintaining the substantial inertness discovered by the Applicants.

      In still another evaluation the response of KRATON G1650 to thermal processing is determined in a Haake torque mixer.
      <br/>
      As shown in FIGS. 10 and 11, Haake torque evaluation results indicate that ENGAGE EG8200 functions as a fusion promoter and substantially improves the processability of KRATON G1650.
      <br/>
      FIG. 10 shows the Haake torque of neat KRATON G1650 at 240 (degree)  C. At 230 (degree)  C., neat KRATON G1650 (Example 12 block copolymer) does not melt in a Haake torque mixer.
      <br/>
      At 240 (degree)  C., an induction delay time of about 3 minutes is required to melt and fuse KRATON G1650 into a molten processable sample.
      <br/>
      In addition to the increase energy requirement, FIG. 10 indicates an additional processing disadvantage.
      <br/>
      As a consequence of the delay time, FIG. 10 indicates the neat block copolymer is rendered more susceptible to thermal scission (instability) as manifested by significant torque decreases over the test period.
    </p>
    <p num="127">
      However, FIG. 11 indicates the addition of 25 weight percent of ENGAGE EG8200 (Example 11 blend composition) allows melting and fusion after about 1 minute of processing at a lower processing temperature, i.e., below 220 (degree)  C. FIG. 11 also indicates the resultant blend composition is more thermally stable as indicated by a moderate torque increase over an extended test period.
      <br/>
      FIG. 12, where the blend composition comprises 50 weight percent TAFMER P0480 in KRATON G1650 (Example 22), indicates similar results regarding fusion and processibility enhancement are obtainable using TAFMER P0480.

      In still another evaluation, the dynamic mechanical properties of VECTOR 4211 is repetitively determined with and without exposure to a Haake torque mixer as described in the blend composition sample preparation procedures above.
      <br/>
      Table 6 shows the sample descriptions for this evaluation and FIG. 13 shows the storage modulus elasticity data.
      <br/>
      A comparison between Examples 7 and 23 on the one hand and Examples 24-26 as plotted in FIG. 13 indicates VECTOR 4211 is highly sensitive to Haake torque exposure.
      <br/>
      Further, a comparison between Examples 24-26 as plotted in FIG. 13 and Examples 6, 17, 18 and 20 as plotted in FIG. 9 shows various thermoelastic polymers(i.e., ATTANE 4203, TAFMER P0480, EXACT 3027 and ENGAGE EG8200 at 25 weight percent loadings) can significantly improve the Haake thermal shear or processing stability of the KRATON G1650 block copolymer.
      <br/>
      That is, these polymers allow lower storage moduli throughout the temperature range of -26 (degree)  C. to 24 (degree)  C. that better approximates the neat, non-Haake exposed block copolymer (Examples 7 and 23) while the neat block copolymer shows higher storage moduli throughout the same range when processed in the Haake mixer (Examples 24-26).
      <br/>
      However, a comparison between EVA blend compositions at 25 and 50 weight percent in VECTOR 4211 as plotted in FIG. 9 with the neat, Haake expose block copolymers (Examples 24-26) as plotted in FIG. 12 indicates EVA does not provide similar improvements in thermal stability.
