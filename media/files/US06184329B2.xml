    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="1">The invention relates to (per)halogenated polyorganosiloxanes (POS) derived from (per)halogenated olefins (e.g.  ALPHA -olefins) by means of a hydrosilylation reaction, it also being possible to present said reaction as the addition of a hydrogenated silicon compound onto a halogenated reactant having one or more ethylenic or alkynylic units of unsaturation.</p>
    <p num="2">It is known in particular that the effects of fluorination, and more precisely of the introduction of perfluorinated units into polymers, are:</p>
    <p num="3">
      to lower the surface energies,
      <br/>
      to improve the thermal and chemical stability and
      <br/>
      to impart organophobicity and oleophobicity properties.
    </p>
    <p num="4">This type of functionalization by halogenation, and in particular by perfluorination, has been applied to silicone polymers, particularly of the cyclic or non-cyclic polyorganosiloxane type, since the 1970s.</p>
    <p num="5">
      Silicone oils grafted by fluorinated units are thus available which have applications in the textile field as stain or dirt repellents or which can be used as lubricants, as antiadhesives specific for certain adhesives (silicones of high adhesive strength), as grease repellents or else as antifoams.
      <br/>
      Fluorinated silicone fluids can also be formulated with different thickeners to form mastics or any other sealing and/or jointing materials.
    </p>
    <p num="6">In crosslinked form these fluorinated silicones can be shaped into a variety of engineering parts by molding or extrusion.</p>
    <p num="7">For further details on these fluorinated silicones, reference may be made to the article by OGDEN R. PIERCE entitled "Fluorosilicones"--1970--John Wiley &amp; Sons Inc., pages 1 to 15.</p>
    <p num="8">
      A first known strategy for the industrial synthesis of silicones containing perfluorinated units includes "hydrosilylating" a dihalogenohydrogenoorganosilane, such as MeHSiCl2 (Me=methyl), with an unsaturated compound carrying a perfluorinated unit and having the general formula CH2 =CH--Rf (Rf=perfluorinated unit).
      <br/>
      The addition of the silane onto this olefin yields a perfluorinated dihalogenoorganosilane, which can be hydrolyzed to produce a functionalized silicone; this can be a cyclic tetramer, for example.
      <br/>
      It is possible to subject the latter to a redistribution reaction to give a perfluorinated linear polyorganosiloxane (POS).
      <br/>
      The hydrosilylation reactions which are involved in this kind of synthesis, and which use various combinations of silicone hybrids and perfluorinated olefins, are known to be catalyzed by selected metal compounds, particularly certain group VIII metals such as platinum.
      <br/>
      Pt/Sn complexes have thus been employed as hydrosilylation catalysts--cf patent U.S. Pat. No. 4,089,882 (SHINETSU).
      <br/>
      This synthetic strategy appears to be relatively complex and hence expensive.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      With a view to industrial simplification, a second synthetic strategy has been proposed which is based on the direct hydrosilylation of a silicone containing SiH units with an  ALPHA -fluorinated olefin, e.g. of the type CH2 =CH--Rf, this perfluorinated unit Rf being attached directly to the olefinic CH by a carbon atom carrying at least one fluorine atom.
      <br/>
      Here again a variety of group VIII metal catalysts, in particular those based on platinum, are used in this hydrosilylation reaction.
      <br/>
      It has been found, however, that these catalysts do not afford very high yields.
      <br/>
      In particular, the conventional industrial hydrosilylation catalysts based on platinum (for example of the KARSTEDT type) are not very efficient.
      <br/>
      Moreover, it has been observed that substantial amounts of by-product are generated, obviously to the detriment of the perfluorination of the silicones.
      <br/>
      In these known perfluorinated POS, the radical Rf is joined directly to the Si of the silicone chain.
      <br/>
      In other words, the linkage in this case corresponds to --CH2 --CH2 --(CH2)--m where m=0.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      It is these linkages which are used in U.S. Pat. No. 5,233,071. They originate from the hydrosilylation of a-olefins.
      <br/>
      However, to overcome the deficiencies of the hydrosilylation catalysts used in the prior art, the process described in said patent involves cobalt-based organometallic complexes �(Co2 CO8, Co2 CO6)(PR3)3, where R=alkyl, aryl�. Such a technical proposal has appeared unsatisfactory because the reaction times obtained are of the order of a few days and it is essential to use a substantial amount of catalyst (1-2%), which is particularly unfavorable in terms of the economics of the process.
    </p>
    <p num="11">
      One appreciable disadvantage of these cobalt-based complexes is that they catalyze reactions other than hydrosilylation.
      <br/>
      In particular, they are capable of taking part in polymerization processes involving the rupture of epoxy rings.
      <br/>
      This lack of specificity is particularly troublesome.
      <br/>
      Moreover, these are not industrial catalysts.
    </p>
    <p num="12">
      U.S. Pat. No. 5,348,769 discloses linear or cyclic polyorganosiloxanes comprising siloxy units D substituted by a first perfluorinated functional unit of the formula --R3 ZRf, and other siloxy units D carrying a second functional unit of the ether-hydroxyl or alkyl-hydroxyl type.
      <br/>
      The linkage or bridge joining Si to Rf in the first perfluorinated functional unit consists especially of --(CH2)x Z, where x=2, 3 or 4 and Z=NHCO, NHSO2, O2 C, O3 S, OCH2 CH3, NHCH2 CH2 or CH2 CHOHCH2.
      <br/>
      The catalyst used is preferably chloroplatinic acid.
      <br/>
      This is not one of the simplest techniques as it requires the prior preparation of the perfluoroalkylated olefinic reactant.
      <br/>
      This considerably lengthens the synthesis times and hence increases the cost of the process.
    </p>
    <p num="13">
      Apart from these linkages whose precursors are perfluoroalkylated  ALPHA -olefins of the formula CH2 =CH--Rf, the technical literature of the prior art also describes bridges whose olefinic precursors are of the type CH2 =CH)--L--Rf, the chemical bond between L and Rf being an ester bond.
      <br/>
      The latter results from the reaction of a carboxyl group with a perhalogenated alcohol, preferably perfluorinated alcohol, and said carboxyl group is generally the hydrolysis product of an acid anhydride.
    </p>
    <p num="14">
      Thus PCT patent application WO 94/12561 discloses POS grafted by fluorinated units only in the  ALPHA  and  OMEGA  positions at the ends of the silicone chains.
      <br/>
      These POS  ALPHA , OMEGA -perfluorinated on alkyl ester groups do not exhibit optimum properties in respect of surface tension lowering or oleophobicity and hydrophobicity.
    </p>
    <p num="15">
      European patent application No. 0 640 644 describes perfluorinated (Rf) silicone derivatives which can be used in cosmetic formulations.
      <br/>
      These perfluorinated silicone derivatives are characterized by siloxy units D carrying three different types of perfluorinated grafts, namely:  (Chemical Structure image '1' not included in text)
    </p>
    <p num="16">where R2, R3 =alkyl, e.g. CH3 ;</p>
    <p num="17">

      <br/>
      the number of siloxy units D grafted in this way is between 1 and 200; and
      <br/>
      X, Y=single bond, --CO-- or C1 --C6 -alkylene.
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      A common feature of these perfluorinated grafts (1) to (3) is the presence of ether bonds within the linkage joining the perfluorinated radical Rf to the silicon.
      <br/>
      Each of these ether bonds represents a possible point of rupture by chemical attack, under certain conditions.
    </p>
    <p num="19">This is a major disadvantage of these known perfluorinated POS because the labile character of the perfluorinated groups is clearly unacceptable in certain applications.</p>
    <p num="20">This review of the prior art shows that there are no chemically stable, halogenated--preferably (per)fluorinated--POS which comprise on the one hand fluorinated lateral grafts resulting from the hydrosilylation of perfluorinated olefins with SiH units and having alkyl and/or alkyl ester linkages but not ether linkages, and on the other hand other, non-perfluorinated functional units capable of giving them diverse and varied physical and chemical properties and opening up avenues in numerous applications.</p>
    <p num="21">Furthermore, the prior art contains even fewer disclosures of such POS which can be obtained in a simple, economic and hence perfectly industrial manner.</p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="22">Under these circumstances, one of the essential objects of the present invention is to overcome this deficiency of such halogenated--preferably (per)fluorinated--POS and preferably to provide novel perfluorinated POS possessing a first type of non-perfluorinated functional grafts and a second type of perfluorinated bifid grafts each having one or two parallel perfluorinated chains, said POS thus having a crystalline character which makes them particularly suitable for application as dirt repellents.</p>
    <p num="23">Another essential object of the invention is to provide a process for the preparation of halogenated--preferably (per)fluorinated--POS, this process being of the type in which at least one halogenated (e.g. fluorinated) olefin and at least one olefinic precursor having, or capable of having, a different functional group from the fluorinated grafts are reacted with a POS containing at least one SiH unit, in the presence of an effective amount of catalyst, according to a hydrosilylation mechanism, it being necessary for said process to use available or easily preparable starting materials and also to be based on a methodology which is simple to put into effect, does not require sophisticated equipment and makes it possible to achieve high performance characteristics in terms of the yield and purity of the final perfluorinated POS.</p>
    <p num="24">Another essential object of the invention is to offer a perhalogenation (perfluorination) process of the above-mentioned type which is characterized by excellent hydrosilylation kinetics and by a high degree of conversion of the SiH units to SiRoRf units, where Ro=divalent bridge and Rf=perfluorinated unit.</p>
    <p num="25">Another essential object of the present invention is to provide a process for the perhalogenation--preferably (per)fluorination--of SiH-carrying POS which allows the use of traditional hydrosilylation catalysts that are simple to manipulate and inexpensive, for example of the platinic type (KARSTEDT), without sacrificing the essential requirements of optimum efficiency, yield, purity of the final products and specificity.</p>
    <p num="26">Another essential object of the invention is that the above-mentioned process makes it possible simply and economically to obtain perfluorinated POS (e.g. silicone oils) which are at least difunctional.</p>
    <p num="27">These and other objects are achieved by the present invention, which relates principally to novel perhalogenated--preferably perfluorinated--POS and to a novel perhalogenation--preferably perfluorination--process involving the hydrosilylation of SiH-carrying POS, said process being one of those which make it possible to obtain the above-mentioned novel POS.</p>
    <p num="28">The present invention therefore relates firstly to (per)halogenated--preferably (per)fluorinated--polyorganosiloxanes (POS) of the following general formulae (I) and (II):  (Chemical Structure image '2' not included in text)</p>

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="34">It is to the credit of the Applicant to have produced these novel (per)halogenated--preferably (per)fluorinated--POS by the careful selection on the one hand of different species of grafts Gf perfluorinated by Rf, and on the other hand of at least one second functional group carried by lateral grafts E belonging to one or more species which are different from one another but in particular different from Gf due to their lack of perfluorinated radicals.</p>
    <p num="35">
      According to the invention, the species of grafts Gf to be considered in particular are:
      <br/>
      those with an alkylene linkage --(Cm H2m)-- where m &gt;= 2;
      <br/>
      those with an alkylene linkage (Cm H2m)m+2 (m &gt;= 0) extended by a divalent or trivalent hydrocarbon radical W devoid of an ether --O--, and having one or more perfluorinated radicals Rf;
      <br/>
      those with an alkylene linkage (Cm H2m)m (m&gt;2) extended either by W  OMEGA -hydroxylated and alkoxylated by a radical whose free end is Rf, or by W alkoxylated by two radicals carrying Rf;
      <br/>
      those with an alkylene linkage --(Cm H2m)-- (m&gt;0) extended by a divalent or trivalent radical belonging to the general family of the radicals W and joined to or forming part of a cyclic unit whose free valence(s), other than that joined to Si, bonds (bond) with any radical(s) Z3 Rf and/or with alkyl, alkoxy or hydroxyl substituents;
      <br/>
      those with an alkylene linkage --(Cm H2m)-- (m&gt;0) extended by a trivalent silyl radical in which the free valences, other than that joined to Si, bond with any radical(s) Z3 Rf and/or with alkyl, alkoxy or hydroxyl substituents; and finally
      <br/>
      those with a linkage not containing a divalent alkylene radical (h=0) but having a radical W directly connected to Si, and also carrying at least one radical Rf.
    </p>
    <p num="36">All these grafts perfluorinated by Rf have the advantage of being chemically stable.</p>
    <p num="37">
      Another major advantage of the grafts according to the invention is that they can be obtained with the aid of industrial catalysts, for example those based on platinum, such as the KARSTEDT catalyst.
      <br/>
      Apart from the fact that they are used in small amounts, these catalysts are intrinsically economic, thereby contributing to a reduction in the cost of the novel perhalogenated (perfluorinated) silicon compounds according to the invention.
    </p>
    <p num="38">This cost is all the lower because the structure of the linkage affords rapid hydrosilylation kinetics, high yields and high degrees of conversion of the SiH units to SiGf units.</p>
    <p num="39">
      In practice the monovalent radical Rf corresponds to --Cq F2q --CF3, where q is between 2 and 20, preferably between 5 and 12 and particularly preferably between 7 and 10.
      <br/>
      In practice it is also possible to use e.g. mixtures of Rf in which q=7, 8 and 9.
    </p>
    <p num="40">According to one advantageous provision of the invention, the fluorinated polyorganosiloxanes to which it relates comprise one or more grafts Gf in which:</p>
    <p num="41">h=0 or 1 and g=1, Z2 comprising a group W corresponding to a substituted or unsubstituted, saturated, unsaturated or aromatic monocyclic or polycyclic radical preferably selected from the following rings:  (Chemical Structure image '16' not included in text)</p>
    <p num="42">
      One of the essential characteristics of the POS of the invention is therefore that they carry one or more functional radicals E which are of different type and are preferably grafted onto siloxy units D, said radicals E being selected for example from the hollowing groups:
      <br/>
      an epoxy-functional group El preferably selected from the following groups:
      <br/>
      - 3-glycidoxypropyl and 4-ethanediyl (1,2-epoxycyclohexyl);
      <br/>
      and/or an isocyanate group El preferably selected from the following groups:  (Chemical Structure image '17' not included in text)
      <br/>
      and/or an amino-functional group E2 preferably selected:
      <br/>
      - either from the following groups:
      <br/>
      - NH2 --(CH)2 --NH--(CH)3 --; NH2 --(CH2)3 --;
      <br/>
      or from secondary or tertiary amine groups forming part of a cyclic hydrocarbon chain (hals), of the formula:  (Chemical Structure image '18' not included in text)
    </p>
    <p num="43">
      in which:
      <br/>
      .gradient. the radicals R20, which are identical to or different from one another, are selected from linear or branched alkyl radicals having from 1 to 3 carbon atoms, phenyl radicals and benzyl radicals;
      <br/>
      .gradient.
      <br/>
      R21 is selected from a hydrogen atom, linear or branched alkyl radicals having from 1 to 12 carbon atoms, alkylcarbonyl radicals in which the alkyl radical is a linear or branched radical having from 1 to 8 carbon atoms, phenyl and benzyl radicals and a radical O;
      <br/>
      .gradient. t is a number selected from 0 and 1;
      <br/>
      .gradient. the preferred radicals R20 being methyls, the radical R21 being a hydrogen atom or a methyl radical and t advantageously being a number equal to 1; and/or
      <br/>
      .gradient. a hydroxy-functional group E6 preferably selected from the following groups: 3-hydroxypropyl and 3-(2-hydroxyethoxy)propyl.
    </p>
    <p num="44">
      These other functional groups E1 to E13, which are e.g. different from the perfluorinated grafts Gf, offer the possibility of constructing perfluorinated silicones possessing other functional groups, both multiple and varied.
      <br/>
      This is of particular value from the point of view of adapting each POS specifically to a given application.
    </p>
    <p num="45">
      It is clear that, in view of their chemical reactivity, the grafts E can in certain cases be precursors of perfluorinated pendent groups, especially of the type Gf.
      <br/>
      These are then supports for the connection of radicals Rf or, in other words, potential precursors of Rf attachment linkages (Rf prelinkages), e.g. anhydrides, carboxyls, alcohols, isocyanates, etc.
      <br/>
      Naturally, however, the possible substitutions are not restricted to perfluorinated groups.
      <br/>
      It is possible to consider fixing any reactive group (crosslinking) to the grafts E.

      According to the invention, a subgroup of particular grafts Gf called "bifid grafts" are considered which are very especially preferred for the remarkable characteristics which they are capable of imparting to the POS onto which they are grafted.

    <p num="79">possible for the hexyl ring to be substituted; and</p>
    <p num="80">--&gt; mixtures of the above-mentioned radicals.</p>
    <p num="81">
      At this stage of the disclosure it is appropriate to dwell for a moment on the particularly interesting species of POS compounds according to the invention which is represented by the perhalogenated--perfluorinated--POS carrying bifid grafts Gf as defined above.
      <br/>
      More precisely, the bifid Gf of interest here are those in which the two lobes each consist of a perhalogenated--perfluorinated--radical Z3 Rf.
      <br/>
      These bisperfluorinated bifid grafts Gf are crystalline and, in particular, impart a degree of crystallinity to the POS which they substitute.
      <br/>
      This optimizes the water-repelling properties of the latter, which thus make very suitable active products in dirt-repelling compositions, inter alia.
    </p>
    <p num="82">These bifluorinated bifid grafts Gf can be associated especially with monoperfluorinated and/or non-perfluorinated bifid Gf.</p>

    <p num="84">
      (small circle)  at least one perhalogenated--preferably perfluorinated--radical Gf of formula (i), (ii) or (iii) above,
      <br/>
      - the radicals R10 and R11 in the formula in question corresponding to Z3 Rf and preferably to:
    </p>
    <p num="85">.rect-solid.O--Cn H2n --Cq F2q --CF3 (q &gt;= 0)</p>
    <p num="86">
      or

    </p>
    <p num="87">(small circle)  and optionally at least one radical Gf (i), (ii) or (iii) in which one of the radicals R10 or R11 is Z3 Rf and the other radical R10 or R11 is different from Z3 Rf and advantageously corresponds to OH or linear or branched C1 -C6 -alkoxy.</p>
    <p num="88">
      During the synthesis, those skilled in the art are perfectly capable of controlling the degrees of substitution of the POS of this species by bisperfluorinated and/or monoperfluorinated and/or non-perfluorinated bifid Gf.
      <br/>
      It is the intended applications of the grafted POS which determine how these degrees of substitution should be regulated.
    </p>
    <p num="89">Within this species the bifid Gf with an alkylmalonyl linkage (i) are chosen more especially in practice.</p>
    <p num="90">
      By analogy with the bifid grafts Gf described above, the grafts E can be constructed on the same structure.
      <br/>
      As a result, another advantageous characteristic of the POS according to the invention can be that they comprise at least one species (I) and/or (II) substituted by at least one radical E selected from the subgroup of radicals E (ic), (iic) and (iiic) corresponding to the radicals Gf (i), (ii) and (iii), respectively, as defined above, the only difference being that R10 and R11 are identical or different and correspond only to OH and linear or branched C1 -C6 -alkoxy.
    </p>
    <p num="91">All these grafts Gf and E impart novelty and great technical value to the POS to which they are attached.</p>
    <p num="92">On the basis of the details given above in respect of the POS according to the invention and their grafts Gf and E, it can be deduced that the preferred POS according to the invention are e.g. poly(dimethyl,methylperfluoroalkyl)siloxanes or poly(methylalkyl,methylperfluoroalkyl)siloxanes where the first alkyl group is propyl, butyl, pentyl, hexyl etc.</p>
    <p num="93">Certain linear perfluorinated POS compounds of average formula (I.1), (I.1.1) and (I1.2) naturally have their cyclic counterparts of average formula (I1.1); in this case, however, the sum of z'+y'1 +y'+e' is less than or equal to 10, preferably 5.</p>
    <p num="94">According to an optional but nevertheless advantageous provision of the invention, the POS contain, per molecule:</p>

      As far as the functional characteristics of the products according to the invention are concerned, it is necessary to emphasize the fact that the monofunctional or polyfunctional fluorinated polyorganosiloxanes described above have notable properties of surface tension lowering and oleophobicity and/or hydrophobicity, inter alia.
      <br/>
      These properties can be adjusted by controlling the proportions of grafted or non-grafted units D present in the fluorinated POS.
      <br/>
      This corresponds to the molar proportions z, z', y1, y'1, y, y', e and e' given by the formulae defined above.

      It should be noted that m values of 1 or 2 in Z1 of Gf guarantee that the fluorinated POS in question will have a good heat stability.

      This property can be advantageous especially in the context of application of the fluorinated POS as lubricants.
    </p>
    <p num="99">
      It is also interesting to observe that, in the case where the fluorinated POS comprise an amino functional group E4 on a unit D or optionally T, this is not without positive repercussions on the coefficient of friction of the oil in question.

      This again is an advantage which can be exploited in lubrication.

      One of the major advantages resulting from the use of perfluorinated or non-perfluorinated unsaturated compounds of this type (Z1p, Z2p, Gfp, Ep) lies in the possibility of using an industrial catalyst selected from compounds based on Ni, Pd or Pt, preferably based on Pt.
      <br/>
      This can be a KARSTEDT catalyst, for example, which is advantageously employed in small amounts, e.g. of the order of 10 to 50 ppm, relative to the POS in question, before hydrosilylation (Si--H oil).
    </p>
    <p num="128">
      The methodology determined by the process according to the invention is particularly simple.

      The hydrosilylation kinetics are rapid.

    <p num="130">In practice the hydrosilylation takes place in as many stages as there are different olefinic reactants.</p>
    <p num="131">
      The reaction medium is stirred and heated to a temperature between 50 and 150 (degree)  C. The reaction takes place at atmospheric pressure and generally over a period of several hours.
