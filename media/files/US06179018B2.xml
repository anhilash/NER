      <br/>
      An apparatus for replacing transmission fluid in an automatic transmission.
      <br/>
      The apparatus comprises a tank separated into a pair of compartments by a bladder or diaphragm.
      <br/>
      At least one pressure regulator communicates with the tank.
      <br/>
      A vent valve assembly also communicates with the tank.
      <br/>
      A process for cleaning an automatic transmission and for replacing after cleaning used automatic transmission fluid in the automatic transmission with fresh automatic transmission fluid.
      <br/>
      The process includes flowing fresh ATF into a first compartment of a tank and into a pliable tub or bladder member in communication with the first compartment until the pliable tub or bladder member and the first compartment are filled with a volume of fresh ATF.
      <br/>
      A chemical cleaning compound is disposed in the used ATF of the automatic transmission and is circulated through the automatic transmission and its associated components to clean the same and produce contaminated used ATF.
      <br/>
      The process additionally includes flowing the contaminated used ATF from the automatic transmission into a second compartment in communication with the pliable tub or bladder member, causing the fresh ATF to flow from the first compartment and from the pliable tub member into the automatic transmission.
      <br/>
      The pressure of the flowing contaminated used ATF is regulated.

      To maintain the integrity of an automatic transmission in a motor vehicle, automatic transmission fluid should be periodically removed from the automatic transmission and replenished with fresh automatic transmission fluid; especially since transmission fluid properties deteriorate with mileage of the motor vehicle because of heat and pressure of the motor engine.
      <br/>
      As an automatic transmission wears with time, minute particles of metal and the like, as well as carbon and similar substances from various materials in the automatic transmission, mix with the automatic transmission fluid and form deposits.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      Associated components of an automatic transmission include the valve body assembly, the torque converter, external and internal automatic transmission fluid passages and lines and the automatic transmission cooler.
      <br/>
      More often in late model vehicles, these associated components are being subjected to severe heating and cooling cycles.
      <br/>
      The components are smaller in size, have less surface area, and are packed into tight areas that are spaced from the primary air flow, often very close to vehicle exhaust systems including hot catalytic converters.
      <br/>
      In addition, cooling systems are purposely maintained at higher than ever temperatures to improve engine combustion efficiency.
      <br/>
      These cooling systems are the primary source of automatic transmission fluid cooling.
      <br/>
      As previously indicated, the result of these conditions on today's automatic transmission and its associated components, is the formation of deposits throughout the system.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      These deposits are primarily the result of metallic particulates and oxidized ATF.
      <br/>
      They require a chemical cleaner for cleaning purposes because they cannot be removed just by exchanging or transfusing the automatic transmission fluid.
      <br/>
      Oxidation is a normal degradation process on petroleum based oils.
      <br/>
      However, continuous heating and cooling to the extremes, as seen today, will greatly expedite this oxidation process.
      <br/>
      These deposits will form in critical areas such as in the valve body of the transmission where gear shifting is controlled, as well as in automatic transmission fluid lines and in automatic transmission fluid coolers.
      <br/>
      Many original equipment manufactures of the motor vehicles now recommend flushing of the automatic transmission fluid lines and coolers to remove the deposit build up.
      <br/>
      The deposits are coating lines and coolers, thus restricting fluid flow and proper heat transfer for cooling.
      <br/>
      If automobile and truck automatic transmission fluid changes are not made at the designated periods, slippage of the automatic transmission may occur and, eventually, the transmission fails.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      When automatic transmission fluid is drained at recommended periods from a transmission case, the used transmission fluid will typically be found to be dark, indicating contaminants in the transmission fluid.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, the transmission fluid present in the transmission case is only a small portion of the transmission fluid actually in the automatic transmission, as a large quantity of the transmission fluid remains in the torque converter, the transmission fluid cooler, and in other control circuits and components of the automatic transmission.
      <br/>
      It has been estimated that 50% or more of the transmission fluid is not removed by draining only the transmission case.
      <br/>
      Thus, after the traditional method of changing automatic transmission fluid, a significant portion of the transmission fluid still contains contaminants because after the traditional transmission fluid change, the quantity of contaminants in an automatic transmission and its associated components will accumulate with successive fluid changes, especially since the transmission will be forced to operate with a mixture of used or old transmission fluid and new or fresh transmission fluid.
      <br/>
      Such operation will reduce the efficiency and life of the automotive transmission.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      These problems have been recognized by the prior art. U.S. Pat. No. 5,291,968 to Brown teaches a drain pan under a transmission, and the collecting of transmission fluid in the drain pan for disposal.
      <br/>
      Brown then uses an external pump to force new transmission fluid from a reservoir into an outlet of the transmission.
      <br/>
      The engine is subsequently used to pump the remainder of the used fluid out as the fresh fluid is pumped in.
      <br/>
      Brown notes that simply removing the transmission pan allows only about three quarts of fluid to be drained of a transmission fluid capacity of twelve quarts.

      <br/>
      More particularly, the pneumatic cushion is provided intermediate individual receptacles for receiving used transmission fluid and adding new transmission fluid while pressure within the receptacles is maintained at a predetermined level commensurate with the normal operating pressure of the fluid in a given transmission.

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="30">
      Referring in detail now to the drawings wherein similar parts of the present invention are identified by like reference numerals, there is seen an apparatus, generally illustrated as 10 (see FIGS. 1A and 1B), for replacing automatic transmission fluid (ATF) in an automatic transmission generally illustrated as 12.
      <br/>
      The apparatus 10 includes a cabinet 11 and has a pair of hoses 14 and 16 connected thereto and extending therefrom to any number of possible accessible points along an automatic transmission fluid (ATF) route, generally illustrated as 18 in FIG. 2.
      <br/>
      As particularly shown in FIG. 2, the ATF route 18 includes a radiator, generally illustrated as 20, having a pair of conduits 22 and 24 connected thereto and respectively extending to an external cooler, generally illustrated as 28, and to the transmission 12.
      <br/>
      The ATF route 18 also includes a conduit 30 extending between the transmission 12 and the external cooler 28 and has an external filter 32 disposed within conduit 30 for filtering fluid passing between the external cooler 28 and the transmission 12.
    </p>
    <p num="31">
      The possible accessible points along the ATF route 18 where conduits 22 and/or 24 and/or 30 could connect would include the radiator 20 (see FIGS. 3-5), the transmission 12 (see FIGS. 6, 8 and 9), and the external cooler 28 (see FIG. 7).

      If the radiator 20 is of the cross flow type with a cooler on a side, the conduits 22 and 24 would connect to a side of the radiator 20, as best shown in FIGS. 1A and 1B. If the radiator 20 is the top tank type, the conduits 22 and 24 would connect at the bottom (see FIG. 5) of the radiator 20.
      <br/>
      The conduits 24 and 30 could be employed with any type of automatic transmission, such as connecting to the transmission 12 for a rear wheel drive (see FIGS. 8 and 9) or to the transmission 12 for a front wheel drive (see FIG. 6).
      <br/>
      It is apparent to those possessing ordinary skill in the art that hose 14 or hose 16 could be replaced by conduit 24 or conduit 22 or conduit 30.
      <br/>
      Therefore, it would only be necessary to disconnect conduit 24 or conduit 22 or conduit 30 and secure the disconnected conduit to the apparatus 10 and connect either hose 14 or hose 16 (depending on which one is to be used) to the situs where the conduit (i.e. conduit 24 or conduit 22 or conduit 30) was disconnected.
      <br/>
      There are numerous ways of employing hoses 14 and 16 with conduits 22, 24 and 30, none of which are to limit the scope of the present invention.
      <br/>
      Thus, the employment of the apparatus 10 within the ATF route 18 may be in any suitable manner, all readily discernible to those skilled in the art and all within the spirit and scope of the present invention.
    </p>
    <p num="32">
      The apparatus 10 includes a conduit and control assembly, generally illustrated as 36, engaged to and communicating with a cylinder or tank, generally illustrated as 38.
      <br/>
      Tank 38 contains a diaphragm type bladder 40 that separates the tank 38 into compartments 38a and 38b (see FIGS. 11-16).
      <br/>
      Compartment 38a has an internal wall 42 that terminates in a perimeter 44 (see FIG. 16) and is formed with openings or ports 46 and 48.
      <br/>
      Fresh or new ATF 50 passes through openings or ports 46 and 48 for a purpose and in a manner to be described hereinafter.
      <br/>
      Compartment 38b has an internal wall 54 (see FIG. 16 again) that terminates in a perimeter 56.
      <br/>
      Compartment 38b has an opening or port 58 wherethrough used or contaminated ATF 60 passes.
      <br/>
      Preferably, the surface area of the internal wall 42 is approximately equal to the surface area of the internal wall 54.
      <br/>
      A tube 64 (see FIGS. 11, 15 and 16) connects to the compartment 38a such as to communicate with port 48.
      <br/>
      Tube 64 contains a valve 66 (see FIG. 10) that is used to close-off any communication that the insides of compartment 38a may have with the atmosphere.
      <br/>
      Valve 66 may be opened to allow new ATF 50 to be added into the tank 38 through tube 64.
      <br/>
      A cap 68 may be conveniently disposed over the end or top of tube 64 as best shown in FIGS. 17A and 17B to prevent dust and dirt from entering the tube 64 and possibly commingling with new ATF 50.
    </p>
    <p num="33">
      The diaphragm type bladder 40 is preferably a tub-like pliable bladder 40 (see FIG. 11) that is capable of performing the function set forth herein.
      <br/>
      The bladder 40 (see FIGS. 12 and 12B) has a pair of surfaces 40a and 40b, each respectively having surface areas that are at least about essentially equal to the surface areas of the internal walls 42 and 54, respectively.
      <br/>
      The spirit and scope of the present invention would encompass the bladder 40 with surfaces 40a and 40b having respective surface areas that would be larger than the surface areas of the internal wall 42 and 54 respectively, as best shown in FIG. 13. In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the surface areas of surfaces 40a and 40b of the bladder 40 and the surface areas of the internal walls 42 and 54 of the compartments 38a and 38b respectively are all essentially equal.
      <br/>
      In this preferred embodiment of the present invention, surface 40b would be capable of being essentially flushed against the surface of the internal wall 54, as best shown in FIGS. 12 and 15. Likewise, surface 40a would be capable of being essentially flushed against the surface of internal wall 42, as best shown in FIG. 16. As will be further explained below, for this preferred embodiment of the present invention, when the surface areas of surfaces 40a and 40b and of the internal walls 42 and 54 are all essentially equal, there would be an effective transfer of equal volumes of new ATF 50 and used ATF 60 into and out of the tank 38.
      <br/>
      When there is such a transfer of an equal volume, the bladder 40 would move from one essentially flushed position (e.g. a position where surface 40b is essentially flushed against the surface of the internal wall 54 as best shown in FIG. 15) to another or opposed essentially flushed position (e.g. a position where surface 40a is essentially flushed against the surface of the internal wall 42 as best shown in FIG. 16).
    </p>
    <p num="34">
      The bladder 40 has a perimeter 40c that engages and connects to the perimeters 44 and 56 of compartments 38a and 38b respectively.
      <br/>
      More preferably and as best shown in FIGS. 11 and 17, the perimeter 40c of the bladder 40 is sandwiched or compressed between the perimeters 44 and 56 of the compartments 38a and 38b respectively.
      <br/>
      Such an engagement and with the assistance of bolts 43 provides for a steadfast connection of the bladder 40 to the perimeters 44 and 56 and facilitates the movement of the bladder 40 within the tank 38 and particularly between the compartments 38a and 38b.
    </p>
    <p num="35">
      The bladder 40 may be manufactured from any suitable material, such as plastic (e.g. polyethylene, polypropylene, ABS, etc.), rubber, etc.
      <br/>
      Preferably, the bladder 40 is formed of an essentially non-elastic and/or non-rubber material; that is, a material that does not stretch to any significant degree when ATF flows into and out of the tank 38.
      <br/>
      The bladder 40 manufactured from a rubber material (e.g. polychloroprene, polyisoprene, etc.) would exhibit elasticity in that it would recover its original shape at least partially or completely after a deforming force (i.e. the flow of ATF) has been removed.
      <br/>
      The purpose of the bladder 40 is not to necessarily stretch but to act as a separator within the tank 38 between new ATF 50 and used ATF 60 and to preferably insure that the volume of used or contaminated ATF 60 leaving the transmission 12 and passing into the tank 38 is essentially equal to the volume of new ATF 50 leaving the tank 38 and passing into the transmission 12 and/or essentially equal to the volume of the tank 38.
      <br/>
      Stated alternatively, the bladder 40 preferably insures that the volume of new ATF 50 within the tank 38 (which volume of new ATF 50 preferably being essentially equal to the volume of the tank 38 itself) is replaced with an essentially equal volume of used ATF 60 (which volume of used AFT 60 preferably being also essentially equal to the volume of the tank 38 itself).
    </p>
    <p num="36">
      The tank 38 may have any suitable volume or fluid capacity, but preferably has an ATF capacity of approximately four (4) U.S. gallons.
      <br/>
      When the tank 38 is fully charged with ATF, the diaphragm type bladder 40 is against the inside walls of the opposite end from the one being filled.
      <br/>
      More specifically and as best shown in FIGS. 14-16, when the tank 38 is fully charged with new ATF 50, the surface 40b of the bladder 40 is preferably flushed or essentially flushed against the surface of the internal wall 54 of compartment 38b (see FIG. 15).
      <br/>
      As used ATF 60 is removed from the transmission 12 and passes through port or opening 58 of compartment 38b, a pressure equal to the pressure of inflowing used ATF 60 is immediately exerted against side 40b of the bladder 40; and thus exerted pressure instantaneously causes new ATF 50 to be expelled through port or opening 48 of compartment 38a.
      <br/>
      As used ATF 60 flows through port or opening 58 and into compartment 38b and as new ATF 50 is being discharged out of compartment 38a through port or opening 46, the bladder 40 initially has no restraints or defined boundaries and is freely moving between the used ATF 60 and the new ATF 50, such as in the generally sinusoidal pattern set forth in FIG. 14. When essentially all of the used ATF 60 has been removed from the transmission 12 and when essentially all of the new ATF 50 has been discharged from compartment 38a, the surface 40a of the bladder 40 is preferably flushed or essentially flushed against the surface of the internal wall 42 of compartment 38a, as best illustrated in FIG. 16.
    </p>
    <p num="37">
      The diaphragm-type bladder 40 exerts no pressure on the ATF itself.
      <br/>
      As previously indicated, when used ATF 60 is pumped into an end (i.e. compartment 38b) of the tank 38, which end now has no capacity since the surface 40b of the bladder 40 is essentially flushed against the internal wall 54 (see FIG. 15), a pressure is immediately exerted on the fluid side (i.e. surface 40a) of the bladder 40 equal to the pressure applied.
      <br/>
      When a control value (identified as "100" below) is opened, new ATF 50 will be released through the connected hoses (i.e. hoses 14 and 16) at the same rate that used ATF 60 is being pumped into the tank 38 (i.e. compartment 38b) because the pressures are the same on both sides of the bladder 40.
      <br/>
      When it is said that the pressures are the same, it is to be understood that the small amount of resistance created in moving the bladder 40 and the ATF behind it, does consume a small amount of pressure.
      <br/>
      Movement of the bladder 40 and the ATF varies as to the amount of ATF changes in the particular compartment being evacuated.
      <br/>
      Therefore, an average pressure differential over the process of emptying one side of the diaphragm type bladder 40 would be approximately 1-2 psi.
      <br/>
      This small amount of difference is totally insignificant in terms of the volume of ATF in the transmission 12 at any point during the transfusion.
      <br/>
      When the transfusion is complete, the volume in the transmission 12 will be the same as at the beginning of the process.

      The conduit and control assembly 36 contained within cabinet 11 comprises conduits 72 and 74.
      <br/>
      Conduit 72 has opposed ends 72a and 72b respectively engaging a conduit connector 75 and a multi-outlet joint 80 and includes a flow indicator 76 for visually determining the direction of ATF flow within conduit 72.
      <br/>
      For the embodiment of the invention depicted in FIGS. 10B, 17B, 18B 19B, 20B, 21B, 22B and 23A-23B, conduit 72 includes a pressure regulator 222 to regulate the pressure emanating from an engine of a vehicle, more specifically from the transmission 12.
      <br/>
      It is desired that pressure off of the transmission 12 and from incoming used ATF 60 being removed from the transmission 12 does not exceed a certain prescribed pressure, preferably about 75 psi, in order to prevent damage to the tank 38 as well as its associated parts and other elements of the apparatus 10.
      <br/>
      The pressure regulator 222 within (or part of) conduit 72 insures that the tank 38 as well as its associated parts and other elements of the apparatus 10 are not exposed to any pressure greater than the prescribed pressure.

      A strainer/filter 88 is placed within conduit 74 for filtering ATF passing through conduit 74.
      <br/>
      For the embodiment of the invention illustrated in FIGS. 22-25, conduit 74 also includes a pressure regulator 223.
      <br/>
      The pressure regulator 223 within or part of conduit 74 is to protect the tank 38 if an operator inadvertently connects the hoses 14 and 16 (which respectively engage outlet/spigot 84 and conduit connector 75) at wrong accessible points along the ATF route 18 such that conduit connector 75 is receiving therethrough used ATF 60 for passage into conduit 74 as opposed to discharging new ATF 50 from conduit 74.
      <br/>
      In such an instance conduit 74 would be communicating with pressure from an engine of a vehicle, more particularly from the transmission 12.
      <br/>
      As was previously indicated, it is desired that the tank 38 and its associated parts are not exposed to a pressure that would exceed a certain prescribed pressure (preferably 75 psi) in order to prevent damage to the tank 38 and/or other elements associated with the apparatus 10.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the pressure regulator 223 is placed within conduit 74 as a safety precaution to insure that the tank 38 as well as its associated parts and other elements of the apparatus 10 are not exposed to any pressure greater than the prescribed pressure in the event that hoses 14 and 16 are inadvertently connected by an operator to wrong accessible points along the ATF route 18.

      New ATF 50 leaves the tank 38, more specifically the compartment 38a, and passes through port 46 and into conduit 94.
      <br/>
      Valve 66 in tube 64 is presently closed.
      <br/>
      Vent valve 420 of the vent valve assembly 400 is also presently closed.
      <br/>
      New ATF 50 flows through conduit 94 to control valve 100 (i.e. a three-way ball valve) labeled "CHECK FLOW DIR/STOP" and "PROCESS/RECHARGE" (see FIGS. 1C and 1D).
      <br/>
      When the control valve 100 is in the "CHECK FLOW DIR/STOP" position, the used ATF 60 from the vehicle's transmission 12 passes through the flow indicator 76 (i.e. a sight glass) located on the cabinet 11 (see FIGS. 1C and 1D again) of the apparatus 10 so the technician or operator of the apparatus 10 may determine the direction of flow of the used ATF 60.
      <br/>
      If the flow is not in the proper direction for making the transfusion or displacement of ATF, then the connections of the hoses 14 and 16 to connector 75 and outlet/spigot 84 respectively must be reversed before proceeding further with the transfusion.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, hoses 14 and 16 may be disconnected from the wrong accessible points along the ATF route 18 and connected to the correct accessible points to obtain proper flow of used ATF 60.
    </p>
    <p num="55">
      The control valve 100 may also be placed in the "CHECK FLOW DIR/STOP" (see FIGS. 1C and 1D) position at any time the operator wishes to terminate the transfusion process.
      <br/>
      In the "PROCESS/RECHARGE" position, the control valve 100 has two (2) functions.
      <br/>
      This is the position where the transfusion takes place, allowing used ATF 60 to enter the tank 38 at port 58 and new ATF 50 to leave the tank 38 through port 46.
      <br/>
      Also in the "PROCESS/RECHARGE" position, the apparatus 10 can be recharged with new ATF 50 (see FIGS. 20A-21B, and 24A-25B) which automatically expels the used ATF 60 it has stored since the last service.
    </p>
    <p num="56">
      After the new ATF 50 leaves the control valve 100, it enters the 4-way outlet joint 86 that is coupled from one of its associated legs to the inlet side of the conduit 106 and pressure release valve 108 by line 112.
      <br/>
      Release valve 108 is used to relieve pressure accumulated during the recharging process.
      <br/>
      As previously indicated, another associated leg of the 4-way outlet joint 86 is coupled to the by-pass regulator 92, and the pressure relief valve 108 is coupled to gauge 116 by line 120.
      <br/>
      During the transfusion process, gauge 116 will typically register 10-30 p.s.i. depending on the make, model and condition of the transmission 12.
      <br/>
      When the transfusion is complete, gauge 116 will either register "0" p.s.i. or, depending on the type and condition of the transmission 12, it may register approximately "20" p.s.i. below gauge 118.
    </p>
    <p num="57">
      New ATF 50 leaves the 4-way outlet joint 86 through conduit 74 and subsequently passes through strainer/filter 88 and on to the outlet/spigot 84 on the cabinet 11 that houses the apparatus 10.
      <br/>
      For the embodiment of the invention exemplified in FIGS. 22A-25B, new ATF 50 also passes through pressure regulator 223 which is within conduit 74 as previously indicated.
      <br/>
      Outlet/spigot 84 includes a spigot that may be used for the removal of ATF to make room for any chemicals that may be added to the new ATF 50.
      <br/>
      New ATF 50 leaves outlet/spigot 84 and passes into hose 14 for passage into the transmission 12.
      <br/>
      Appropriate couplers (not shown) may be employed in the present invention, such as to make the actual connection of the hose 14 to the outlet/spigot 84.
      <br/>
      As previously mentioned, the tube 64 is attached to the new fluid side of the tank 38 and protrudes through the top of the cabinet 11.
      <br/>
      Tube 64 has the valve 66 to open the tube 64 for manual filling the tank 38.
      <br/>
      At all other times, the valve 66 is closed.
      <br/>
      The cap 68 on top of the tube 64 is to prevent dirt and dust from entering the tank 38 through the tube 64.
      <br/>
      New ATF 50 does not pass through the bypass regulator 92 and into conduit 90 for admixing with used ATF 60 since the bypass regulator 92 is not opened.
      <br/>
      As will be further stated below, pressure regulator 92 does not open to allow passage of ATF therethrough unless a prescribed pressure differential occurs on opposite sides of the pressure regulator 92.
      <br/>
      When new ATF 50 is flowing simultaneously with the flowing of used ATF 60, there is essentially no major discernible pressure differential on opposite sides of the pressure regulator 92.
    </p>
    <p num="58">
      Used ATF 60 is routed into the apparatus 10 by means of special connectors (not shown) designed to either fit on the loosened end of hose 16 or at any other suitable location.
      <br/>
      These adapters are fitted with male quick connects that snap into a length of the hose 16 that runs to the connector 75 on the cabinet 11 that houses the apparatus 10.
    </p>
    <p num="59">
      After passing through connector 75 and into the conduit 72, the used ATF 60 flows through the flow indicator 76 which is used to determine direction of fluid flow.
      <br/>
      For the embodiment of the invention exemplified in FIGS. 22A-25B, used ATF 60 flows through the pressure regulator 222 before passing through the flow indicator 76.
      <br/>
      From the flow indicator 76 the used ATF 60 flows to the multi-outlet joint 80 that connects to the bottom of the tank 38 via conduit 77.
      <br/>
      When the tank 38 is full of used ATF 60, the incoming fluid (which now would essentially be new ATF 50) is routed from this junction (i.e. multi-outlet joint 80) through the bypass regulator 92, through the 4-way outlet joint 86, through conduit 74 and hose 14, and back to the transmission 12.
    </p>
    <p num="60">
      The bypass regulator 92 is preset and is typically not an operator adjustable item.
      <br/>
      Bypass regulator 92 activates only when a predetermined pressure differential (preferably approximately 20 p.s.i.) exists on opposite sides of the bypass regulator 92; that is the difference in the pressure on the 4-way outlet joint 86 side of conduit 90 from the pressure on the multi-outlet joint 80 side of conduit 90.
      <br/>
      In a preferred embodiment of the present invention this condition occurs when the used ATF side (i.e. compartment 38b) of the tank 38 is full.
      <br/>
      Bypass regulator 92 allows the system to operate safely even when the technician or operator is not available to shut down the system.
      <br/>
      As indicated, the fluid coming from the transmission 12 by this time will be new clean fluid (i.e. new ATF 50) and this fluid simply bypasses the conduit 77 and the tank 38 and flows through the multi-outlet joint 80, through conduit 90 including bypass regulator 92, through 4-way outlet joint 86, and through conduit 74 including strainer/filter 88, and back into the transmission 12 via hose 14.
      <br/>
      For the embodiment of the invention depicted in FIGS. 22A-25B, bypassing new ATF 50 would flow through the pressure regulator 223 before passing through the strainer/filter 88.
      <br/>
      The system can essentially operate in this mode indefinitely.
    </p>
    <p num="61">
      As previously indicated, the multi-outlet joint 80 is coupled to the inlet side of the conduit 106 and pressure release valve 108 through line 110.
      <br/>
      The conduit 106 and pressure relief valve 108 are coupled to the gauge 118 via line 122.
      <br/>
      During the transfusion process, gauge 118 will read almost identical to pressure gauge 116.
      <br/>
      When the transfusion process is complete, gauge 118 may read up to 20 p.s.i. above gauge.
      <br/>
      As stated above, multi-outlet joint 80 is also coupled to the control valve 100 (i.e. the valve labeled "CHECK FLOW DIR/STOP" and "PROCESS/RECHARGE") by conduit 94a.
      <br/>
      Conduit 94a is active only when the flow direction is being checked or when the transfusion process needs to be stopped for any reason.
    </p>
    <p num="62">
      Continuing to refer in detail now to the drawings for operation of the invention and the process for cleaning the transmission 12 (and its associated circuits or components) and for replacing used ATF 60 in the transmission 12 with new ATF 50, the engine of a vehicle is started and is run until normal operating temperature is reached.
      <br/>
      The ATF level of the automatic transmission is checked and is adjusted as necessary to hold a desired quantity (e.g. 10-14 ounces per four (4) gallons of used ATF 60) of the chemical cleaning compound.
      <br/>
      The chemical cleaning compound is admixed with the used ATF 60 by pouring the desired quantity of the chemical cleaning compound down the transmission fill tube.
      <br/>
      The engine is run or the vehicle is driven for at least 5 minutes, but preferably no more than 30 minutes.
      <br/>
      For maximum cleaning, the vehicle will preferably be driven during this time, but if the vehicle can not be driven, then it should be placed on a lift where the wheels of the vehicle are off the floor.
      <br/>
      With the engine running, the transmission 12 is shifted through all the gears to be sure the valve body in the transmission 12 is actuated and to insure that the chemical cleaning compound gets to all parts of the associated components of the transmission 12.
      <br/>
      During this procedure, the brake is fully applied between gear changes to prevent damage to the transmission 12 or differential assemblies.
    </p>
    <p num="63">
      The transmission 12 of the vehicle is now ready for the transfusion (i.e. for the removal of used dirty ATF 60 and installation of new clean ATF 50 in the transmission 12, valve body, torque converter, transmission lines, and ATF cooler(s)).
      <br/>
      The engine is shut down and a junction is located at any accessible point along the ATF route 18 (see FIGS. 2-9) that will allow the operator to install one of the included connectors (not shown) to each end of the junction.
      <br/>
      Subsequently, the hoses 14 and 16 are respectively attached to the outlet/spigot 84 and to connector 75 on the cabinet 11 of the apparatus 10.
      <br/>
      It is not necessary to know for certain which way the ATF is flowing at this time.
      <br/>
      The other available end of hose 16 is connected to the aforementioned appropriate adapter located at an accessible point along the ATF route 18.
    </p>
    <p num="64">
      The next step is to check the direction of flow of the ATF through the lines.
      <br/>
      To accomplish this, the control valve 100 on top of the cabinet 11 is turned to "CHECK FLOW/STOP." The vehicle's engine is started and the direction of ATF flow in the flow indicator 76 on the cabinet 11 is detected.
      <br/>
      If the ATF flow is in the wrong direction, the engine is shut off and the hoses 14 and 16 at the quick connect fittings (where the hoses 14 and 16 respectively connect to outlet/spigot 84 and connector 75) are reversed.
      <br/>
      The engine is restarted and the control lever 100 (see FIGS. 18A and 18B) is turned to "PROCESS/RECHARGE." The transmission's own pump will begin the transfusion immediately by pumping the used ATF 60 into the collapsed compartment (i.e. compartment 38b) of the tank 38.
      <br/>
      This instantly exerts pressure on surface 40a of the bladder 40 and on the new ATF 50, which forces new ATF 50 out from compartment 38a through the conduit 94, through control valve 100, through 4-way outlet joint 86, through conduit 74 and through hose 14 and into the transmission 12 at the same rate of flow and pressure that used ATF 60 is being pumped into the tank 38.
      <br/>
      This means that the level of fluid in the transmission and components remains the same at all times during the transfusion.
      <br/>
      The fluid level in the transmission 12 does not require constant monitoring.
    </p>
    <p num="65">
      As the transmission 12 continues to pump used ATF 60 into the tank 38, the bladder 40 is collapsed against the other side (i.e. surface 42 of the compartment 38a) and pressure may begin to build in the used ATF side of the apparatus 10, depending on the placement of the transmission's own internal regulator.
      <br/>
      The preset bypass regulator 92 in the used ATF side of the apparatus will open when a 20 p.s.i. differential exists between the pressure on the new ATF side and the pressure on the used ATF side.
      <br/>
      Incoming fluid which is now new clean ATF 50 will be routed around the tank 38 as previously indicated and back into the transmission 12.
      <br/>
      At this point the transfusion itself is complete, some four to eight minutes after it began.
      <br/>
      The operator will know when the transfusion is complete because there is now about a 20 p.s.i. differential in the pressure readings on the gauges 116 and 118.
      <br/>
      When the transfusion is complete, the engine is shut off and the previously installed connections are removed.
      <br/>
      Subsequently, the operator reconnects the transmission hose, starts the engine and checks the transmission fluid level.
    </p>
    <p num="66">
      The tank 38 in the apparatus 10 must be recharged with new ATF 50 before the next service.
      <br/>
      It can be recharged easily and quickly from any ATF source, and with any factory specification ATF required by the next vehicle to be serviced.
      <br/>
      Recharging the apparatus 10 discharges the captured used ATF 60 from the last service, making the invention even more simple and "user friendly." To recharge the apparatus 10, the control valve 100 is turned to "PROCESS/RECHARGE." A special connector (not shown but is any open end adapter) is attached to an end of the used ATF hose (i.e. hose 16) which is subsequently placed in a used oil receptacle (not shown).
      <br/>
      Next, the new ATF hose (i.e. hose 14) is removed from the outlet/spigot 84 and the recharge adapter 200 is connected directly onto the outlet/spigot 84 protruding from the cabinet 11.
      <br/>
      For the embodiment of the invention illustrated for example in FIGS. 10A, 17A, 18A, 19A, 20A and 21A, the recharge adapter 200 contains the pressure regulator 222A (see FIG. 26) to prevent unnecessary pressure from being applied to the tank 38.
      <br/>
      For the embodiment of the invention illustrated and exemplified in FIGS. 22A-25A, no pressure regulator 222A is connected to recharge adapter 200 as best shown in FIG. 27. In another preferred embodiment of the invention and after removing hose 14 from outlet/spigot 84, recharge adapter 300 (instead of recharge adapter 200) is connected directly onto the outlet/spigot 84 extending upwardly from the cabinet 11 (see FIGS. 1C and 1D).
      <br/>
      Recharge adapter 300 contains no vent valve, such as vent valve 202 on recharge adapter 200.
      <br/>
      When the recharge adapter 300 is employed in the present invention, the vent valve assembly 400 is also preferably employed.
    </p>
    <p num="67">
      In the embodiment of the invention employing the recharge adapter 200, after the recharge adapter 200 is installed to outlet/spigot 84 and after the vent valve 202 (see FIGS. 20A and 26) of the recharge adapter 200 closed, shop air is applied into the end 200a of the recharge adapter 200 until the pressure reading on gauge 118 reads "0".
      <br/>
      In the embodiment of the invention employing recharge adapter 300, after the recharge adapter 300 is installed to outlet/spigot 84 and with the vent valve 420 of the vent valve assembly 400 closed, shop air is applied to check valve end of the recharge adapter 300 until the pressure reading on gauge 118 reads "0".
      <br/>
      Pressurized air flows through conduit 74, through 4-way outlet joint 86, through control valve 100, through conduit 94 and into the compartment 38a to exert air pressure against surface 40a of the bladder 40 to commence the expulsion of used ATF 60 through conduit 77 (see FIGS. 19A and 19B), through multi-outlet joint 80, through conduit 72 and out of connector 75 into hose 16.
      <br/>
      As previously indicated, gauge 118 is capable of detecting the pressure in multi-outlet joint 80 (including conduit 94a and conduit 77) through communication with the multi-outlet joint 80 with line 122, conduit 106, and line 110.
      <br/>
      A "0" reading on gauge 118 indicates that all used ATF 60 has been expelled and that the bladder 40 (see FIG. 12) is collapsed against the bottom of the tank 38 (i.e. against the surface of the internal wall 54 of compartment 38b) and is now ready for manual filling.
      <br/>
      To release any trapped pressure from the new ATF compartment (i.e. compartment 38a) of the tank 38, the pressure relief valve 108 in conduit 106 is opened.
      <br/>
      For the embodiment of the present invention employing recharge adapter 200, the vent valve 202 on the bottom of the recharge adapter 200 is opened.
      <br/>
      As previously indicated and in the embodiment of the invention employing the recharge adapter 300 and the vent valve assembly 400, vent valve 420 is opened.
      <br/>
      This will allow air to escape from the tank 38 as it is being filled.
      <br/>
      Next, cap 68 is removed off of tube 64 and valve 66 is slowly opened.
      <br/>
      A desired quantity (e.g. approximately four gallons) of new ATF 50 is poured down tube 64 to fill the tank 38 including compartment 38a.
      <br/>
      When the desired level of new ATF 50 is attained, valve 66 is closed and cap 68 is replaced over tube 66.
      <br/>
      Subsequently and for the embodiment employing recharge adapter 200, the operator is to close the vent valve 202, remove the recharge adapter 200 and special connectors (not shown), and reconnect the new ATF service hose (i.e. hose 14).
      <br/>
      For the embodiment of the invention using the recharge adapter 300 and the vent valve assembly 400, the operator subsequently closes vent valve 420 of the valve assembly 400 after cap 68 has been replaced over tube 66; and then the operator removes the recharge adapter 300, and subsequently reconnects the new ATF service hose (i.e. hose 14).
    </p>
    <p num="68">
      For pressurized filling (see FIGS. 21A and 21B), adapters are connected the same way as for manual filling.
      <br/>
      If the recharge adapter 200 is being used, pressurized new ATF 50 is applied into end 200a of the recharge adapters 200 with its associated vent valve 202 closed and tank 38 including compartment 38a is filled with new ATF until gauge 118 reads approximately "0".
      <br/>
      If the recharge adapter 300 and the vent valve assembly 400 is being employed, pressurized new ATF 50 is applied into the check valve end of the recharge adapter 300 with vent valve 420 of the vent valve assembly 400 closed, and tank 38 including compartment 38a is filled with new ATF until gauge 118 reads approximately "0".
      <br/>
      This reading indicates all used ATF 60 has been expelled and the tank 38 is now filled with new ATF 50.
      <br/>
      The pressure relief valve 108 in conduit 106 is opened to relieve any pressure trapped in the new ATF side of the apparatus 10.
      <br/>
      Any pressure in the used ATF side of the apparatus 10 is vented back into the used ATF hose (i.e. hose 16) and on the used ATF storage tank (not shown).
      <br/>
      Recharging is now complete and the transfusion apparatus 10 is ready for the next vehicle service.
    </p>
    <p num="69">
      Thus, by the practice of the present invention there is provided an economical system for both cleaning and flushing automatic transmissions 12.
      <br/>
      For use in normal schedule transmission service there is no need to remove the transmission pan or filter, thus saving parts, cost and labor.
      <br/>
      The simplicity of the design of the apparatus 10 itself results in low initial equipment cost.
      <br/>
      There is no power in the apparatus 10, which means no scheduled maintenance is required.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, there are no extra batteries to purchase in order to use the system.
      <br/>
      Some prior art devices use 3-4 times the normal capacity of ATF to insure a good exchange.
      <br/>
      With normal capacity being 8-12 quarts, that equates to as much as 12 gallons of ATF to exchange a 3 gallon system.
      <br/>
      The practice of the present invention particularity addresses this needed improvement and will reach the same range of purity with 4 gallons or less.
      <br/>
      This represents a significant savings in materials.
      <br/>
      The apparatus 10 in the process mode will make the ATF exchange in 3 to 7 minutes on average, depending on the make, model and condition of the transmission 12, making it as quick as any system and faster than most.
      <br/>
      Time equals money in a service center.
    </p>
    <p num="70">
      Practice of the present invention enables the operator to change types of ATF from service to service to accommodate the particular type required by each make or model of vehicle.
      <br/>
      Prior art devices make use of 10-15 gallon storage tanks, thus each transmission serviced will get the same ATF, regardless of the specs required by the manufacturer.
      <br/>
      Misapplication is encouraged by these prior art designs.
      <br/>
      The apparatus 10 can be easily recharged with new ATF 50, and discharge captured used ATF 60 in under 2 minutes, again making it fast and economical.
