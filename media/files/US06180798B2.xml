    <p num="226">
      In practical use for the control of arthropods, especially insects or mites, or nematode pests of plants, a method, for example, comprises applying to the plants o:r to the medium in which they grow an effective amount of a compound of the invention.
      <br/>
      For such a method, the active compound is generally applied to the locus in which the arthropod or nematode infestation is to be controlled at an effective rate in the range of about 0.005 kg to about 15 kg of the active compound per hectare of locus treated.
      <br/>
      Under ideal conditions, depending on the pest to be controlled, a lower rate may offer adequate protection.
      <br/>
      On the other hand, adverse weather conditions, resistance of the pest or other factors may require that the active ingredient be used at higher rates.
      <br/>
      The optimum rate depends usually upon a number of factors, for example, the type of pest being controlled, the type or the growth stage of the infested plant, the row spacing or also the method of application.
      <br/>
      More preferably an effective rate range of the active compound is from about 0.01 kg/ha to about 2 kg/ha.
    </p>
    <p num="227">
      When a pest is soil-borne, the active compound, generally in a formulated composition, is distributed evenly over the area to be treated (i.e., for example broadcast or band treatment) in any convenient manner.
      <br/>
      Application may be made, if desired, to the field or crop-growing area generally or in close proximity to the seed or plant to be protected from attack.
      <br/>
      The active component can be washed into the soil by spraying with water over the area or can be left to the natural action of rainfall.
      <br/>
      During or after application, the formulated compound can, if desired, be distributed mechanically in the soil, for example by ploughing, disking, or use of drag chains.
      <br/>
      Application can be prior to planting, at planting, after planting but before sprouting has taken place, or after sprouting.
      <br/>
      Additionally, a method of control may also comprise treatment of the seed prior to planting with subsequent control effected after planting the seed.
    </p>
    <p num="228">
      Methods of control of pests also comprise application to or treatment of the foliage of plants to control arthropods, especially insects or mites, or nematodes attacking the aerial parts of the plants.
      <br/>
      In addition, methods of control of pests by the invention compounds are provided to control pests which feed on parts of the plant remote from the point of application, e.g., leaf feeding insects which are controlled via systemic action of the active compound when applied for example to the roots of a plant or to the plant seed prior to planting.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, the compounds of the invention may reduce attacks on a plant by means of antifeeding or repellent effects.
    </p>
    <p num="229">The compounds of the invention and methods of control of pests therewith are of particular value in the protection of field, forage, plantation, glasshouse, orchard or vineyard crops, of ornamentals, or of plantation or forest trees, for example: cereals (such as maize, wheat, rice, or sorghum), cotton, tobacco, vegetables (such as beans, cole crops, curcurbits, lettuce, onions, tomatoes or peppers), field crops (such as potatoes, sugar beets, ground nuts, soybeans, or oil seed rape), sugar cane, grassland or forage crops (such as maize, sorghum, or lucerne), plantations (such as tea, coffee, cocoa, banana, palm oil, coconut, rubber, or spices), orchards or groves (such as of stone or pit fruit, citrus, kiwifruit, avocado, mango, olives or walnuts), vineyards, ornamental plants, flowers or vegetables or shrubs under glass or in gardens or parks, or forest trees (both deciduous and evergreen) in forests, plantations or nurseries.</p>
    <p num="230">They are also valuable in the protection of timber (standing, felled, converted, stored or structural) from attack, for example, by sawflies or beetles or termites.</p>
    <p num="231">
      They have applications in the protection of stored products such as grains, fruits, nuts, spices or tobacco, whether whole, milled or compounded into products, from moth, beetle, mite or grain weevil attack.
      <br/>
      Also protected are stored animal products such as skins, hair, wool or feathers in natural or converted form (e.g. as carpets or textiles) from moth or beetle attack as well as stored meat, fish or grains from beetle, mite or fly attack.
    </p>
    <p num="232">
      Additionally, the compounds of the invention and methods of use thereof are of particular value in the control of arthropods, helminths or protozoa which are injurious to, or spread or act as vectors of diseases in man and domestic animals, for example those hereinbefore mentioned, and more especially in the control of ticks, mites, lice, fleas, midges, or biting, nuisance or myiasis flies.
      <br/>
      The compounds of the invention are particularly useful in controlling arthropods, helminths or protozoa which are present inside domestic host animals or which feed in or on the skin or suck the blood of the animal, for which purpose they-may be administered orally, parenterally, percutaneously or topically.
    </p>
    <p num="233">
      Furthermore, compounds of the invention may be useful for coccidiosis, a disease caused by infections from protozoan parasites of the genus Eimeria.
      <br/>
      It is an important potential cause of economic loss in domestic animals and birds, particularly those raised or kept under intensive conditions.
      <br/>
      For example, cattle, sheep, pigs or rabbits may be affected, but the disease is especially important in poultry, particularly in chickens.
      <br/>
      Administration of a small amount of a compound of the invention, preferably by a combination with feed is effective in preventing or greatly reducing the incidence of coccidiosis.
      <br/>
      The compounds are effective against both the cecal form and the intestinal forms.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, the compounds of the invention may also exam an inhibiting effect on oocytes by greatly reducing the number and sporulation of those produced.
      <br/>
      The poultry disease is generally spread by the birds picking up the infectious organism in droppings in or on contaminated litter, ground, food, or drinking water.
      <br/>
      The disease is manifested by hemorrhage, accumulation of blood in the ceca, passage of blood to the droppings, weakness and digestive disturbances.
      <br/>
      The disease often terminates in the death of the animal, but the fowl which survive severe infections have had their market value substantially reduced as a result of the infection.

    <p num="236">
      In practice, the compounds of the invention most frequently form parts of compositions.
      <br/>
      These compositions can be employed to control: arthopods, especially insects or mites; nematodes; or helminth or protozoan pests.
      <br/>
      The compositions may be of any type known in the art suitable for application to the desired pest in any premises or indoor or outdoor area or by internal or external administration to vertebrates.
      <br/>
      These compositions contain at least one compound of formula (I) or a pesticidally acceptable salt thereof, such as described earlier, as the active ingredient in combination or association with one or more other compatible components which are for example, solid or liquid carriers or diluents, adjuvants, surface-active agents, or the like appropriate for the intended use and which are agronomically or medicinally acceptable.

    <p num="240">
      Compositions for oral administration comprise one or more of the compounds of formula (I) , or pesticidally acceptable salts thereof in association with pharmaceutically acceptable carriers or coatings and include, for example, tablets, pills, capsules, pastes, gels, drenches, medicated feeds, medicated drinking water, medicated dietary supplements, slow-release boluses or other slow-release devices intended to be retained within the gastrointestinal tract.
      <br/>
      Any of these may incorporate the active ingredient contained within microcapsules or coated with acid-labile or alkali-labile or other pharmaceutically acceptable enteric coatings.
      <br/>
      Feed premixes or concentrates containing compounds of the present invention for use in preparation of medicated diets, drinking water or other materials for consumption by animals may also be used.

    <p num="243">Solid or liquid baits, suitable for controlling arthropods, comprise one or more compounds of formula (I), or pesticidally acceptable salts thereof, and a carrier or diluent which may include a food substance or some other substance to induce consumption by the arthropod.</p>
    <p num="244">
      The effective use doses of the compounds employed in the invention can vary within wide limits, particularly depending on the nature of the pest to be eliminated or degree of infestation, for example, of crops with these pests.
      <br/>
      In general, the compositions according to the invention usually contain about 0.05 to about 95% (by weight) of one or more active ingredients according to the invention, about 1 to about 95% of one or more solid or liquid carriers and, optionally, about 0.1 to about 50% of one or more other compatible components, such as surface-active agents or the like.
    </p>
    <p num="245">
      In the present account, the term "carrier" denotes an organic or inorganic ingredient, natural or synthetic, with which the active ingredient is combined to facilitate its application, for example, to the plant, to seeds or to the soil.
      <br/>
      This carrier is therefore generally inert and it must be acceptable (for example, agronomically acceptable, particularly to the treated plant).
    </p>
    <p num="246">
      The carrier may be a solid, for example, clays, natural or synthetic silicates, silica, resins, waxes, solid fertilizers (for example ammonium salts), ground natural minerals, such as kaolins, clays, talc, chalk, quartz, attapulgite, montmorillonite, bentonite or diatomaceous earth, or ground synthetic minerals, such as silica, alumina, or silicates especially aluminum or magnesium silicates.
      <br/>
      As solid carriers for granules the following are suitable: crushed or fractionated natural rocks such as calcite, marble, pumice, sepiolite and dolomite; synthetic granules of inorganic or organic meals; granules of organic material such as sawdust, coconut shells, corn cobs, corn husks or tobacco stalks; kieselguhr, tricalcium phosphate, powdered cork, or absorbent carbon black; water soluble polymers, resins, waxes; or solid fertilizers.
      <br/>
      Such solid compositions may, if desired, contain one or more compatible wetting, dispersing, emulsifying or coloring agents which, when solid, may also serve as a diluent.
    </p>
    <p num="247">The carrier may also be liquid, for example: water; alcohols, particularly butanol or glycol, as well as their ethers or esters, particularly methylglycol acetate; ketones, particularly acetone, cyclohexanone, methylethylketone, methylisobutylketone, or isophorone; petroleum fractions such as paraffinic or aromatic hydrocarbons, particularly xylenes or alkyl naphthalenes; mineral or vegetable oils; aliphatic chlorinated hydrocarbons, particularly trichloroethane or methylene chloride; aromatic chlorinated hydrocarbons, particularly chlorobenzenes; water-soluble or strongly polar solvents such as dimethylformamide, dimethyl sulfoxide, or N-methylpyrrolidone; liquefied gases; or the like or a mixture thereof.</p>
    <p num="248">
      The surface-active agent may be an emulsifying agent, dispersing agent or wetting agent of the ionic or non-ionic type or a mixture of such surface-active agents.
      <br/>
      Amongst these are e.g., salts of polyacrylic acids, salts of lignosulfonic acids, salts of phenolsulfonic or naphthalenesulfonic acids, polycondensates of ethylene oxide with fatty alcohols or fatty acids or fatty esters or fatty amines, substituted phenols (particularly alkylphenols or arylphenols), salts of sulfosuccinic acid esters, taurine derivatives (particularly alkyltaurates), phosphoric esters of alcohols or of polycondensates of ethylene oxide with phenols, esters of fatty acids with polyols, or sulfate, sulfonate or phosphate functional derivatives of the above compounds.
      <br/>
      The presence of at least one surface-active agent is generally essential when the active ingredient and/or the inert carrier are only slightly water soluble or are not water soluble and the carrier agent of the composition for application is water.
    </p>
    <p num="249">
      Compositions of the invention may further contain other additives such as adhesives or colorants.
      <br/>
      Adhesives such as carboxymethylcellulose or natural or synthetic polymers in the form of powders, granules or lattices, such as arabic gum, polyvinyl alcohol or polyvinyl acetate, natural phospholipids, such as cephalins or lecithins, or synthetic phospholipids can be used in the formulations.
      <br/>
      It is possible to use colorants such as inorganic pigments, for example: iron oxides, titanium oxides or Prussian Blue; organic dyestuffs, such as alizarin dyestuffs, azo dyestuffs or metal phthalocyanine dyestuffs; or trace nutrients such as salts of iron, manganese, boron, copper, cobalt, molybdenum or zinc.
    </p>
    <p num="250">
      Compositions containing compounds of formula (I), or pesticidally acceptable salts thereof, which may be applied to control arthropod, plant nematode, helninth or protozoan pests, may also contain synergists (e.g. piperonyl butoxide or sesamex), stabilizing substances, other insecticides, acaricides, plant nematocides, antheimintics or anticoccidials, fungicides (agricultural or veterinary as appropriate, e.g. benomyl and iprodione), bactericides, arthropod or vertebrate attractants or repellents or pheromones, deodorants, flavoring agents, dyes, or auxiliary therapeutic agents, e.g. trace elements.
      <br/>
      These may be designed to improve potency, persistence, safety, uptake where desired, spectrum of pests controlled or to enable the composition to perform other useful functions in the same animal or area treated.

    <p num="252">For their agricultural application, the compounds of the formula (I), or pesticidally acceptable salts thereof, are therefore generally in the form of compositions, which are in various solid or liquid forms.</p>
    <p num="253">
      Solid forms of compositions which can be used are dusting powders (with a content of the compound of formula (C), or a pesticidally acceptable salt thereof, ranging up to 80%), wettable powders or granules (including water dispersible granules), particularly those obtained by extrusion, compacting, impregnation of a granular carrier, or granulation starting from a powder (the content of the compound of formula (I), or a pesticidally acceptable salt thereof, in these wettable powders or granules being between about 0.5 and about 80%).
      <br/>
      Solid homogeneous or heterogeneous compositions containing one or more compounds of formula (I), or pesticidally acceptable salts thereof, for example granules, pellets, briquettes or capsules, may be used to treat standing or running water over a period of time.
      <br/>
      A similar effect may be achieved using trickle or intermittent feeds of water dispersible concentrates as described herein.
    </p>
    <p num="254">
      Liquid compositions, for example, include aqueous or non-aqueous solutions or suspensions (such as emulsifiable concentrates, emulsions, flowables, dispersions, or solutions) or aerosols.
      <br/>
      Liquid compositions also include, in particular, emulsifiable concentrates, dispersions, emulsions, flowables, aerosols, wettable powders (or powder for spraying), dry flowables or pastes as forms of compositions which are liquid or intended to form liquid compositions when applied, for example as aqueous sprays (including low and ultra-low volume) or as fogs or aerosols.
    </p>
    <p num="255">
      Liquid compositions, for example, in the form of emulsifiable or soluble concentrates most frequently comprise about 5 to about 80% by weight of the active ingredient, while the emulsions or solutions which are ready for application contain, in their case, about 0.01 to about 20% of the active ingredient.
      <br/>
      Besides the solvent, the emulsifiable or soluble concentrates may contain, when required, about 2 to about 50% of suitable additives, such as stabilizers, surface-active agents, penetrating agents, corrosion inhibitors, colorants or adhesives.
      <br/>
      Emulsions of any required concentration, which are particularly suitable for application, for example, to plants, may be obtained from these concentrates by dilution with water.
      <br/>
      These compositions are included within the scope of the compositions which may be employed in the present invention.
      <br/>
      The emulsions may be in the form of water-in-oil or oil-in-water type and they may have a thick consistency.
    </p>
    <p num="256">The liquid compositions of this invention may, in addition to normal agricultural use applications, be used for example to treat substrates or sites infested or liable to infestation by arthropods (or other pests controlled by compounds of this invention) including premises, outdoor or indoor storage or processing areas, containers or equipment or standing or running water.</p>
    <p num="257">
      All these aqueous dispersions or emulsions or spraying mixtures can be applied, for example, to crops by any suitable means, chiefly by spraying, at rates which are generally of the order of about 100 to about 1,200 liters of spraying mixture per hectare, but may be higher or lower (e.g. low or ultra-low volume) depending upon the need or application technique.
      <br/>
      The compounds or compositions according to the invention are conveniently applied to vegetation and in particular to roots or leaves having pests to be eliminated.
      <br/>
      Another method of application of the compounds or compositions according to the invention is by chemigation, that is to say, the addition of a formulation containing the active ingredient to irrigation water.
      <br/>
      This irrigation may be sprinkler irrigation for foliar pesticides or it can be ground irrigation or underground irrigation for soil or for systemic pesticides.
    </p>
    <p num="258">
      The concentrated suspensions, which can be applied by spraying,. are prepared so as to produce a stable fluid product which does not settle (fine grinding) and usually contain from about 10 to about 75% by weight of active ingredient, from about 0.5 to about 30% of surface-active agents, from about 0.1 to about 10% of thixotropic agents, from about 0 to about 30% of suitable additives, such as anti-foaming agents, corrosion inhibitors, stabilizers, penetrating agents, adhesives and, -,is the carrier, water or an organic liquid in which the active ingredient is poorly soluble or insoluble.
      <br/>
      Some organic solids or inorganic salts may be dissolved in the cardier to help prevent settling or as antifreezes for water.
    </p>
    <p num="259">
      The wettable powders (or powder for spraying) are usually prepared so that they contain from about 10 to about 80% by weight of active ingredient, from about 20 to about 90% of a solid carrier, from about 0 to about 5% of a wetting agent, from about 3 to about 10% of a dispersing agent and, when necessary, from about 0 to about 80% of one or more stabilizers and/or other additives, such as penetrating agents, adhesives, anti-caking agents, colorants, or the like.
      <br/>
      To obtain these wettable powders, the active ingredient(s) is(are) thoroughly mixed in a suitable blender with additional substances which may be impregnated on the porous filler and is(are) ground using a mill or other suitable grinder.
      <br/>
      This produces wettable powders, the wettability and the suspendability of which are advantageous.
      <br/>
      They may be suspended in water to give any desired concentration and this suspension can be employed very advantageously in particular for application to plant foliage.
    </p>
    <p num="260">
      The "water dispersible granules (WG)" (granules which are readily dispersible in water) have compositions which are substantially close to that of the wettable powders.
      <br/>
      They may be prepared by granulation of formulations described for the wettable powders, either by a wet route (contacting finely divided active ingredient with the inert filler and a little water, e.g. 1 to 20% by weight, or with an aqueous solution of a dispersing agent or binder, followed by drying and screening), or by a dry route (compacting followed by grinding and screening).
    </p>
    <p num="261">
      The application dose (effective dose) of active ingredient, also as a formulated composition, is generally between about 0.005 and about 15 kg/ha, preferably between about 0.01 and about 2 kg/ha.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the rates and concentrations of the formulated compositions may vary according to the method of application or the nature of the compositions or use thereof.
      <br/>
      Generally speaking, the compositions for application to control arthropod, plant nematode, helminth or protozoan pests usually contain from about 0.00001% to about 95%, more particularly from about 0.0005% to about 50% by weight of one or more compounds of formula (I), or pesticidally acceptable salts thereof, or of total active ingredients (that is to say the compound of formula (I), or a pesticidally acceptable salt thereof, together with: other substances toxic to arthropods or plant nematodes, antheimintics, anticoccidials, synergists, trace elements or stabilizers).
      <br/>
      The actual compositions employed and their rate of application will be selected to achieve the desired effect(s) by the farmer, livestock producer, medical or veterinary practitioner, pest control operator or other person skilled in the art.
    </p>
    <p num="262">
