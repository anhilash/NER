    <p num="1">
      1.
      <br/>
      Field of the Invention
    </p>
    <p num="2">The present invention relates to motorcycle wheel disk lock reminder systems and more particularly pertains to a new motorcycle wheel disk lock reminder system for reminding a user that a disk lock is mounted to the wheel of the user's motorcycle so that the user does not drive the motorcycle with the disk lock attached to the wheel.</p>
    <p num="3">2. Description of the Prior Art</p>
    <p num="4">
      The use of motorcycle wheel disk lock reminder systems is known in the prior art.
      <br/>
      More specifically, motorcycle wheel disk lock reminder systems heretofore devised and utilized are known to consist basically of familiar, expected and obvious structural configurations, notwithstanding the myriad of designs encompassed by the crowded prior art which have been developed for the fulfillment of countless objectives and requirements.
    </p>
    <p num="5">Known prior art includes U.S. Pat. No. 4,665,728; U.S. Pat. No. 5,563,387; U.S. Pat. No. Des. 270,245; U.S. Pat. No. Des. 326,045; U.S. Pat. No. 4,838,059; and U.S. Pat. No. 1,590,981.</p>
    <p num="6">
      While these devices fulfill their respective, particular objectives and requirements, the aforementioned patents do not disclose a new motorcycle wheel disk lock reminder system.
      <br/>
      The inventive device includes a disk lock adapted for attachment to a wheel of a motorcycle.
      <br/>
      The disk lock has a slot therein into which an insertion tab outwardly extending from an inner face of a reminder unit is removably inserted.
      <br/>
      The insertion tab of the reminder unit is also insertable into an ignition keyhole of the motorcycle subsequent removable of the insertion tab from the slot of the disk lock to prevent insertion of an ignition key into the ignition keyhole without prior removal therefrom of the insertion tab of the reminder unit.
    </p>
    <p num="7">In these respects, the motorcycle wheel disk lock reminder system according to the present invention substantially departs from the conventional concepts and designs of the prior art, and in so doing provides an apparatus primarily developed for the purpose of reminding a user that a disk lock is mounted to the wheel of the user's motorcycle so that the user does not drive the motorcycle with the disk lock attached to the wheel.</p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="8">In view of the foregoing disadvantages inherent in the known types of motorcycle wheel disk lock reminder systems now present in the prior art, the present invention provides a new motorcycle wheel disk lock reminder system construction wherein the same can be utilized for reminding a user that a disk lock is mounted to the wheel of the user's motorcycle so that the user does not drive the motorcycle with the disk lock attached to the wheel.</p>
    <p num="9">The general purpose of the present invention, which will be described subsequently in greater detail, is to provide a new motorcycle wheel disk lock reminder system apparatus and method which has many of the advantages of the motorcycle wheel disk lock reminder systems mentioned heretofore and many novel features that result in a new motorcycle wheel disk lock reminder system which is not anticipated, rendered obvious, suggested, or even implied by any of the prior art motorcycle wheel disk lock reminder systems, either alone or in any combination thereof.</p>
    <p num="10">
      To attain this, the present invention generally comprises a disk lock adapted for attachment to a wheel of a motorcycle.
      <br/>
      The disk lock has a slot therein into which an insertion tab outwardly extending from an inner face of a reminder unit is removably inserted.
      <br/>
      The insertion tab of the reminder unit is also insertable into an ignition keyhole of the motorcycle subsequent removable of the insertion tab from the slot of the disk lock to prevent insertion of an ignition key into the ignition keyhole without prior removal therefrom of the insertion tab of the reminder unit.
    </p>
    <p num="11">
      There has thus been outlined, rather broadly, the more important features of the invention in order that the detailed description thereof that follows may be better understood, and in order that the present contribution to the art may be better appreciated.
      <br/>
      There are additional features of the invention that will be described hereinafter and which will form the subject matter of the claims appended hereto.
    </p>
    <p num="12">
      In this respect, before explaining at least one embodiment of the invention in detail, it is to be understood that the invention is not limited in its application to the details of construction and to the arrangements of the components set forth in the following description or illustrated in the drawings.
      <br/>
      The invention is capable of other embodiments and of being practiced and carried out in various ways.
      <br/>
      Also, it is to be understood that the phraseology and terminology employed herein are for the purpose of description and should not be regarded as limiting.
    </p>
    <p num="13">
      As such, those skilled in the art will appreciate that the conception, upon which this disclosure is based, may readily be utilized as a basis for the designing of other structures, methods and systems for carrying out the several purposes of the present invention.
      <br/>
      It is important, therefore, that the claims be regarded as including such equivalent constructions insofar as they do not depart from the spirit and scope of the present invention.
    </p>
    <p num="14">
      Further, the purpose of the foregoing abstract is to enable the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office and the public generally, and especially the scientists, engineers and practitioners in the art who are not familiar with patent or legal terms or phraseology, to determine quickly from a cursory inspection the nature and essence of the technical disclosure of the application.
      <br/>
      The abstract is neither intended to define the invention of the application, which is measured by the claims, nor is it intended to be limiting as to the scope of the invention in any way.
    </p>
    <p num="15">It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a new motorcycle wheel disk lock reminder system apparatus and method which has many of the advantages of the motorcycle wheel disk lock reminder systems mentioned heretofore and many novel features that result in a new motorcycle wheel disk lock reminder system which is not anticipated, rendered obvious, suggested, or even implied by any of the prior art motorcycle wheel disk lock reminder systems, either alone or in any combination thereof.</p>
    <p num="16">It is another object of the present invention to provide a new motorcycle wheel disk lock reminder system which may be easily and efficiently manufactured and marketed.</p>
    <p num="17">It is a further object of the present invention to provide a new motorcycle wheel disk lock reminder system which is of a durable and reliable construction.</p>

    <p num="19">Still yet another object of the present invention is to provide a new motorcycle wheel disk lock reminder system which provides in the apparatuses and methods of the prior art some of the advantages thereof, while simultaneously overcoming some of the disadvantages normally associated therewith.</p>
    <p num="20">Still another object of the present invention is to provide a new motorcycle wheel disk lock reminder system for reminding a user that a disk lock is mounted to the wheel of the user's motorcycle so that the user does not drive the motorcycle with the disk lock attached to the wheel.</p>
    <p num="21">
      Yet another object of the present invention is to provide a new motorcycle wheel disk lock reminder system which includes a disk lock adapted for attachment to a wheel of a motorcycle.
      <br/>
      The disk lock has a slot therein into which an insertion tab outwardly extending from an inner face of a reminder unit is removably inserted.
      <br/>
      The insertion tab of the reminder unit is also insertable into an ignition keyhole of the motorcycle subsequent removable of the insertion tab from the slot of the disk lock to prevent insertion of an ignition key into the ignition keyhole without prior removal therefrom of the insertion tab of the reminder unit.
    </p>
    <p num="22">Still yet another object of the present invention is to provide a new motorcycle wheel disk lock reminder system that helps prevent injuries to motorcycles and their riders from riders who drive their motorcycles after forgetting to remove a disk lock from a wheel of their motorcycle.</p>
    <p num="23">Even still another object of the present invention is to provide a new motorcycle wheel disk lock reminder system that provides a quick visual reminder and also prevents a user from starting the motorcycle without first being reminded that a disk lock is attached to a wheel of the motorcycle.</p>
    <p num="24">
      These together with other objects of the invention, along with the various features of novelty which characterize the invention, are pointed out with particularity in the claims annexed to and forming a part of this disclosure.
      <br/>

    <p num="34">
      In use, the system is designed for reminding a user that a disk lock is mounted to a wheel of a motorcycle.
      <br/>
      Initially, the disk lock is attached to the brake disk of the wheel of the motorcycle.
      <br/>
      Next, the insertion tab of sad reminder unit is removed from the slot of the disk lock and then inserted the insertion tab of the reminder unit into the ignition keyhole of the motorcycle to thereby prevent insertion of an ignition key into the ignition keyhole without prior removal therefrom of the insertion tab of the reminder unit.
    </p>
    <p num="35">
      When a user is ready to ride the motorcycle, the user removes the insertion tab of the reminder unit from the ignition keyhole and then reinsert the insertion tab of the reminder unit into the slot of the disk lock to attach the reminder unit to the disk lock.
      <br/>
      The disk lock is also removed at this point from the wheel of the motorcycle.
      <br/>
      An ignition key may now be inserted into the ignition keyhole to actuate the motorcycle and so that the user can safely ride the motorcycle unhindered by the disk lock.
