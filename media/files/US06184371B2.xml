    <heading>REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION</heading>
    <p num="1">This application is a continuation-in-part of U.S. Patent application No. 08/867,941 filed Jun. 3, 1997 now U.S. Pat. Ser. No. 5,977,337.</p>
    <heading>FIELD OF INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">The present invention relates to the molecular cloning of genes encoding lactoferrin receptor (LfR) proteins and, in particular, to the cloning of lactoferrin binding protein genes (lbp genes) from Moraxella (Branhamella) catarrhalis.</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="3">
      Moraxella (Branhamella) catarrhalis bacteria are Gram-negative diplococcal pathogens which are carried asymptomatically in the healthy human respiratory tract.
      <br/>
      However, in recent years, M. catarrhalis has been recognized as an important causative agent of otilis media.
      <br/>
      In addition, M. catarrhalis has been associated with sinusitis, conjunctivitis, and urogenital infections, as well as with a number of inflammatory diseases of the lower respiratory tract in children and adults, including pneumonia, chronic bronchitis, tracheitis, and emphysema (refs. 1 to 8). (Throughout this application, various references are cited in parentheses to describe more fully the state of the art to which this invention pertains.
      <br/>
      Full bibliographic information for each citation is found at the end of the specification, immediately preceding the claims.
      <br/>
      The disclosures of these references are hereby incorporated by reference into the present disclosure).
      <br/>
      Occasionally, M. catarrhalis invades to cause septicaemia, arthritis, endocarditis, and meningitis (refs. 9 to 13).
    </p>
    <p num="4">M. catarrhalis colonizes the human upper respiratory tract and is an important cause of otitis media in infants and children as well as lower respiratory tract infections in adults with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.</p>
    <p num="5">
      Otitis media is one of the most common illnesses of early childhood and approximately 80% of all children suffer at least one middle ear infection before the age of three (ref. 14).
      <br/>
      Chronic otitis media has been associated with auditory and speech impairment in children, and in some cases, has been associated with learning disabilities.
      <br/>
      Conventional treatments for otitis media include antibiotic administration and surgical procedures, including tonsillectomies, adenoidectomies, and tympanocentesis.
      <br/>
      In the United States, treatment costs for otitis media are estimated to be between one and two billion dollars per year.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      In otitis media cases, M. catarrhalis is commonly co-isolated from middle ear fluid along with Streptococcus pneumoniae and non-typable Haemophilus influenzae, which are believed to be responsible for 50% and 30% of otitis media infections, respectively. M. catarrhalis is believed to be responsible for approximately 20% of otitis media infections (ref. 15).
      <br/>
      Epidemiological reports indicate that the number of cases of otitis media attributable to M. catarrhalis is increasing, along with the number of antibiotic-resistant isolates of M. catarrhalis.
      <br/>
      Thus, prior to 1970, no  BETA -lactamase-producing M. catarrhalis isolates had been reported, but since the mid-seventies, an increasing number of  BETA -lactamase-expressing isolates have been detected.
      <br/>
      Recent surveys suggest that up to 80 to 85% of clinical isolates produce  BETA -lactamase (ref. 16, 22, 23).
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      Iron-restriction is a general host defence mechanism against microbial pathogens.
      <br/>
      A number of bacterial species including Neisseria meningitidis (ref. 17, 24), N. gonorrhoeae (ref. 25) and M. catarrhalis (ref. 17), express outer membrane proteins which specifically bind human lactoferrin.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      M. catarrhalis infection may lead to serious disease.
      <br/>
      It would be advantageous to provide a recombinant source of lactoferrin binding proteins as antigens in immunogenic preparations including vaccines, carriers for other antigens and immunogens and the generation of diagnostic reagents.
      <br/>
      The genes encoding lactoferrin binding proteins and fragments thereof are particularly desirable and useful in the specific identification and diagnosis of Moraxella and for immunization against disease caused by M. catarrhalis and for the generation of diagnostic reagents.
    </p>

    <heading>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS</heading>
    <p num="34">
      The present invention will be further understood from the following description with reference to the drawings, in which:
      <br/>
      FIG. 1 shows partial sequence of the 2.2 kb PCR amplified fragments of the lbpA genes from M. catarrhalis 4223 or Q8, which were used to probe the phage libraries. In the figure, Tbp1 is the deduced 4223 Tbp1 sequence (as described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08/613,009 filed Mar. 8, 1996, assigned to the assignee hereof and the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference) (SEQ ID No: 19), Lbp1 is the deduced full-length 4223 Lbp1 sequence (SEQ ID No: 3) used here solely for aligning the PCR fragments, PCR4 is the 4223 PCR fragment (SEQ ID No: 20), and PCR5 is a partial sequence of the Q8 PCR fragment (SEQ ID No: 21). Only single strand sequence was obtained for the PCR fragments and "X" has been inserted where there was a doubtful sequence. Dashes have been used for maximum alignment. The underlined sequence in Lbp1 (MVQYTYRKGKENKAH--SEQ ID No: 22) represents the position of a CNBr peptide used to generate the 5'-PCR primer.
      <br/>
      FIG. 2 shows the nucleotide (SEQ ID No: 1, full sequence; SEQ ID No: 2, Lbp2 coding sequence; SEQ ID No: 3, Lbp1 coding sequence, first methionine; SEQ ID No: 4, Lbp1 coding sequence, second methionine; SEQ ID No: 5, ORF3 coding sequence) and deduced amino acid sequences (SEQ ID No: 11, Lbp2; SEQ ID No: 12, Lbp1, first methionine; SEQ ID No: 13, Lbp1, second methionine; SEQ ID No: 14, ORF3) of the putative lfr locus from M. catarrhalis 4223. There are three tandem genes in the putative lfr locus identified as lbpB, lbpA and orf3. Potential promoter elements found upstream of the lbpB and lbpA genes are indicated by underlining.
      <br/>
      FIG. 3 shows a restriction map of clone pLD1-8 containing the lbpA, lbpB, and orf3 genes from M. catarrhalis isolate 4223.

    <heading>GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="35">
      Any Moraxella strain may be conveniently used to provide the purified and isolated nucleic acid, which may be in the form of DNA molecules, comprising at least a portion of the nucleic acid coding for a lactoferrin receptor as typified by embodiments of the present invention.
      <br/>
      Such strains are generally available from clinical sources and from bacterial culture collections, such as the American Type culture Collection.
    </p>
    <p num="36">
      In this application, the terms "lactoferrin receptor" (LfR) and "lactoferrin binding proteins" (Lbp) are used to define a family of Lbp1, Lbp2 and/or ORF3 proteins which includes those having variations in their amino acid sequences including those naturally occurring in various strains of, for example, Moraxella.
      <br/>
      The purified and isolated DNA molecules comprising at least a portion coding for lactoferrin receptor of the present invention also includes those encoding functional analogs of lactoferrin receptor proteins Lbp1, Lbp2 and/or Lbp3 of Moraxella.
      <br/>
      In this application, a first protein is an "analog" of a second protein if the first protein is immunologically related to and/or has the same function as the second protein.
      <br/>
      The analog may be, for example, a substitution, addition or deletion mutant thereof.
    </p>
    <p num="37">
      Lactoferrin receptor proteins were purified from M. catarrhalis membrane preparations by affinity chromatography on biotinylated human lactoferrin.
      <br/>
      Cyanogen bromide fragments were generated and amino acid sequence analysis of a 13 kDa fragment provided an internal Lbp1 sequence of MVQYTYRKGKENKAH (SEQ ID No: 22) underlined in FIG. 6.
      <br/>
      The C-terminus of M. catarrhalis Tbp1 (United States Patent Applicaticn No. 08/613,009), N. meningitidis Tbp1 (ref. 27) and H. influenzae Tbp1 (ref. 31) has a conserved LEMKF (SEQ ID No: 26) sequence.
      <br/>
      Oligonucleotide primers were generated based upon these two sequences and used to PCR amplify an approximately 2.2 kb fragment of the lbpA gene from M. catarrhalis strains 4223, Q8 and VH19.
      <br/>
      Partial sequence analysis demonstrated that the amplified genes were lbpA and not tbpA (see FIG. 1).
      <br/>
      The 2.2 kb PCR fragments were used to screen genomic libraries.
    </p>
    <p num="38">
      Chromosomal DNA from 4223, Q8 and VH19 was partially digested with Sau3A I and 15 to 2:3 kb fragments were purified before cloning into BamH I arms of the lambda vector EMBL3.
      <br/>
      The libraries were screened with the PCR fragment and positive clones were subjected to three rounds of plaque purification.
      <br/>
      Phage clone 4223LfR.17 containing an approximately 16 kb insert from 4223 and phage clone Q8LfR.13 containing an approximately 16 kb insert from Q8 were selected for further analysis.
    </p>
    <p num="39">
      Restriction enzyme and Southern blot analyses revealed that an internal Hind III fragment of approximately 9 kb contained at least a portion of the lbpA gene for both phage clones.
      <br/>
      The approximately 9 kb Hind III fragments were subcloned into pUC or pBluescript-based plasmids and sequenced.
      <br/>
      In each case, they contained the complete lbpA gene as well as an upstream gene identified as lbpB, and a downstream gene designated as orf3.
      <br/>
      The lbpB-lbpA gene arrangement is the same as present for Neisseria strains, but there has been no identification of a third gene for these organisms.
    </p>
    <p num="40">
      The gene arrangement is different than that observed for the M. catarrhalis tfr operon which was tbpA-orf-tbpB (United States Patent Application No. 08/613,009).
      <br/>
      There are promoter elements found upstream of both the lbpB and lbpA genes from strains 4223 and Q8.
      <br/>
      The third ORF is located immediately downstream of lbpA, separated by a single nucleotide.
    </p>
    <p num="41">
      By analogy with the N. meningitidis and N. gonorrhoeae transferrin receptor operons (ref. 26, 27, 28), the lactoferrin receptor operon was presurred to consist of two genes encoding lactoferrin binding proteins 1 and 2 (Lbp1 and Lbp2) (ref. 29).
      <br/>
      However, we report here that, for M. catarrhalis, there also appears to be a third gene located immediately downstream of lbpA encoding a potential lactoferrin binding protein 3 (ORF3).
    </p>
    <p num="42">
      The M. catarrhalis 4223 and Q8 lbpA genes encode proteins of molecular mass about 110 kDa and that are highly conserved with only seven residues difference between them.
      <br/>
      The N-terminal sequence of the native Lbp protein is unknown and there are two possible ATG start codons at positions 1 or 16.
      <br/>
      The first of these is adjacent to consensus sequences for promoter elements and the second is followed by a putative signal sequence.
      <br/>
      The exact peptide sequence used to design the PCR amplification primers was not found.
      <br/>
      When compared with other known Lbp1 sequences from N. meningitidis (refs. 31, 24) or N. gonorrhoeae (ref. 25) there is about 32% sequence identity and about. 50% sequence homology between the M. catarrhalis and the Neisseria proteins.
      <br/>
      There is some homology between the M. catarrhalis Lbp1 and Tbp1 proteins as shown in FIG. 1, but it is very scattered.
    </p>
    <p num="43">
      The M. catarrhalis 4223, Q8 and VH19 lbpB genes encode 898, 894 and 906 amino acid proteins, respectively.
      <br/>
      The M. catarrhalis Lbp2 proteins from strains 4223 and Q8 are 92% identical and 95% homologous while that from VH19 is 77% identical and 84% similar to the 4223 and Q8 Lbp2 proteins (FIG. 7).
      <br/>
      There is a consensus sequence for lipidation at the Cys32 residue, suggesting that Lbp2 is a lipoprotein like Tbp2.
      <br/>
      There is little homology between the M. catarrhalis Lbp2 and Tbp2 proteins (FIG. 8) with the exception of a previously identified peptide sequence (LEGGFY (SEQ ID No: 27)) that is also found in N. meningitidis and H. influenzae Tbp2 (ref. 30).
    </p>
    <p num="44">
      The sequence of the proposed M. catarrhalis lfr-related downstream orf3 is conserved between strains 4223 and Q8.
      <br/>
      The encoded 4223 and Q8 ORF3 proteins when compared to the PIR and Swiss Prot protein databases were found to be previously unknown.
      <br/>
      The ORF3 protein may bind lactoferrin itself or may be an associated or regulatory protein for Lbp1 and/or Lbp2.
    </p>
    <p num="45">Expression vectors have been assembled from the lbpA and lbpB genes and recombinant Lbp1 and Lbp2 proteins isolated and purified, as described in detail in the Examples below.</p>
    <p num="46">
      Results shown in Table 1 below illustrate the ability of anti-Lbp1 guinea pig antiserum, produced by immunization with affinity purified Lbp1, to lyre M. catarrhalis.
      <br/>
      The results show that the antisera produced by immunization with Lbp1 protein isolated from M. catarrhalis isolate 4223 was bactericidal against a homologous non-clumping M. catarrhalis strain RH408 (a strain previously deposited in connection with United States Patent Application No. 08/328,589, assigned to the assignee hereof (WO 96/12733 published May 2, 1996)) derived from isolate 4223.
      <br/>
      In addition, antisera produced by immunization with Lbp1 protein isolated from M. catarrhalis 4223 were bactericidal against the heterologous non-clumping strain Q8.
      <br/>
      The results in Table 3 show that similarly-produced anti-Lbp2 guinea pig antiserum was bactericidal for the homologous strain and for three of five hetrologous strains.
      <br/>
      The ability of isolated and purified lactoferrin binding protein to generate bactericidal antibodies is in vivo evidence of utility of these proteins as vaccines to protect against disease caused by Moraxella.
    </p>
    <p num="47">
      Thus, in accordance with another aspect of the present invention, there is provided a vaccine against Moraxella comprising an immunogenically-effective amount of lactoferrin binding protein or fragment or analog thereof, or a nucleic acid molecule (DNA or RNA) encoding the lactoferrin binding protein or fragment or analog thereof, and a physiologically-acceptable carrier therefor.
      <br/>
      The lactoferrin binding protein or fragment or analog thereof provided herein may also be used as a carrier protein for haptens, polysaccharide or peptides to make conjugate vaccines against antigenic determinants unrelated to lactoferrin binding proteins.
    </p>
    <p num="48">
      In additional embodiments of the present invention, therefore, the lactoferrin binding protein as provided herein may be used as a carrier molecule to prepare chimeric molecules and conjugate vaccines (including glycoconjugates) against pathogenic bacteria, including encapsulated bacteria.
      <br/>
      Thus, for example, glycoconjugates of the present invention may be used to confer protection against disease and infection caused by any bacteria having polysaccharide antigens including lipooligosaccharides (LOS) and PRP.
      <br/>
      Such bacterial 842 pathogens may include, for example, Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Neisseria meningitidis, Salmonella typhi, Streptococcus mutans, Cryptococcus neoformans, Klebsiella, Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
      <br/>
      Particular antigens which can be conjugated to lactoferrin binding protein and methods to achieve such conjugations are described in U.S. patent application No. 08/433,522 filed Nov. 23, 1993 (WO 94/12641), assigned to the assignee hereof and the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference thereto.
    </p>
    <p num="49">In another embodiment, the carrier function of lactoferrin binding protein may be used, for example, to induce an immune response against abnormal polysaccharides of tumour cells, or to produce anti-tumour antibodies that can be conjugated to chemotherapeutic or bioactive agents.</p>
    <p num="50">The lactoferrin binding protein provided herein is useful as a diagnostic reagent, as an antigen or for the generation of anti-lactoferrin protein binding antibodies, antigen for vaccination against disease caused by species of Moraxella and for detecting infection by Moraxella and other such bacteria.</p>
    <p num="51">
      The invention extends to lactoferrin binding proteins or fragments or analogs thereof or nucleic acid molecules encoding the same from Moraxella catarrhalis for use as an active ingredient in a vaccine against disease caused by infection with Moraxella.
      <br/>
      The invention also extends to a pharmaceutical vaccinal composition containing lactoferrin binding proteins or fragments or analogs thereof or nucleic acid molesules encoding the same from Moraxella catarrhalis and optionally, a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and/or diluent.
    </p>
    <p num="52">In a further aspect the invention provides the use of lactoferrin binding proteins or fragments or analogs thereof or nucleic acid molesules encoding the same for the preparation of a pharmaceutical vaccinal composition for immunization against disease caused by infection with Moraxella.</p>
    <p num="53">
      It is clearly apparent to one skilled in the art, that the various embodiments of the present invention have many applications in the fields of vaccination, diagnosis, treatment of, for example, Moraxella infections and the generation of immunological and other diagnostic reagents.
      <br/>
      A further non-limiting discussion of such uses is further presented below.
    </p>
    <p num="54">1. Vaccine Preparation and Use</p>
    <p num="55">
      Immunogenic compositions, suitable to be used as vaccines, may be prepared from immunogenic lactoferrin receptor proteins, analogs and fragments thereof encoded by the nucleic acid molecules as well as the nucleic acid molecules disclosed herein.
      <br/>
      The vaccine elicits an immune response which produces antibodies, including anti-lactoferrin receptor antibodies and antibodies that are opsonizing or bactericidal.
      <br/>
      Should the vaccinated subject be challenged by Moraxella, the antibodies bind to the lactoferrin receptor and thereby prevent access of the bacteria to an iron source which is required for viability.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, opsonizing or bactericidal anti-lactoferrin receptor antibodies may also provide protection by alternative mechanisms.
    </p>
    <p num="56">
      Immunogenic compositions, including vaccines, may be prepared as injectables, as liquid solutions or emulsions.
      <br/>
      The lactoferrin receptor proteins, analogs and fragments thereof and encoding nucleic acid molecules as well as the nucleic acid molecules described herein may be mixed with pharmaceutically acceptable excipients which are compatible with the lactoferrin receptor proteins, fragments, analogs or nucleic acid molecules.
      <br/>
      Such excipients may include water, saline, dextrose, glycerol, ethanol, and combinations thereof.
      <br/>
      The immunogenic compositions and vaccines may further contain auxiliary substances, such as wetting or emulsifying agents, pH buffering agents, or adjuvants, to enhance the effectiveness of the vaccines.
      <br/>
      Immunogenic compositions and vaccines may be administered parenterally, by injection subcutaneously, intradermally or intramuscularly.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, the immunogenic compositions provided according to the present invention, may be formulated and delivered in a manner to evoke an immune response at mucosal surfaces.
      <br/>
      Thus, the immunogenic composition may be administered to mucosal surfaces by, for example, the nasal or oral (intragastric) routes.
      <br/>
      The immunogenic composition may be provided in combination with a targeting molecule for delivery to specific cells of the immune system or to mucosal surfaces.
      <br/>
      Some such targeting molecules include vitamin B12 and fragments of bacterial toxins, as described in WO 92/17167 (Biotech Australia Pty.
      <br/>
      Ltd.), and monoclonal antibodies, as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,194,254 (Barber et al).
      <br/>
      Alternatively, other modes of administration, including suppositories and oral formulations, may be desirable.
      <br/>
      For suppositories, binders and carriers may include, for example, polyalkalene glycols or triglycerides.
      <br/>
      Oral formulations may include normally employed incipients such as, for example, pharmaceutical grades of saccharine, cellulose and magnesium carbonate.
      <br/>
      These compositions may take the form of solutions, suspensions, tablets, pills, capsules, sustained release formulations or powders and contain about 1 to 95% of the lactoferrin receptor proteins, fragments, analogs and/or nucleic acid molecules.
    </p>
    <p num="57">
      The vaccines are administered in a manner compatible with the dosage formulation, and in such amount as will be therapeutically effective, protective and immunogenic.
      <br/>
      The quantity to be administered depends on the subject to be treated, including, for example, the capacity of the individual's immune system to synthesize antibodies, and, if needed, to produce a cell-mediated immune response.
      <br/>
      Precise amounts of active ingredient required to be administered depend on the judgement of the practitioner.
      <br/>
      However, suitable dosage ranges are readily determinable by one skilled in the art and may be of the order of micrograms of the lactoferrin receptor proteins, analogs and fragments thereof and/or nucleic acid molecules.
      <br/>
      Suitable regimes for initial administration and booster doses are also variable, but may include an initial administration followed by subsequent administrations.
      <br/>
      The dosage of the vaccine may also depend on the route of administration and will vary according to the size of the host.
    </p>
    <p num="58">
      The nucleic acid molecules encoding the lactoferrin receptor of Moraxella may be used directly for immunization by administration of the DNA directly, for example, by injection for genetic immunization or by constructing a live vector, such as Salmonella, BCG, adenovirus, poxvirus, vaccinia or poliovirus containing the nucleic acid molecules.
      <br/>
      A discussion of some live vectors that have been used to carry heterologous antigens to the immune system is contained in, for example, O'Hagan (ref. 18).
      <br/>
      Processes for the direct injection of DNA into test subjects for genetic immunization are described in, for example, Ulmer et al. (ref. 19).
    </p>
    <p num="59">
      Immunogenicity can be significantly improved if the antigens are co-administered with adjuvants, commonly used as an 0.05 to 1.0 percent solution in phosphate--buffered saline.
      <br/>
      Adjuvants enhance the immunogenicity of an antigen but are not necessarily immunogenic themselves.
      <br/>
      Adjuvants may act by retaining the antigen locally near the site of administration to produce a depot effect facilitating a slow, sustained release of antigen to cells of the immune system.
      <br/>
      Adjuvants can also attract cells of the immune system to an antigen depot and stimulate such cells to elicit immune responses.
    </p>
    <p num="60">
      Immunostimulatory agents or adjuvants have been used for many years to improve the host immune responses to, for example, vaccines.
      <br/>
      Intrinsic adjuvants, such as lipopolysaccharides, normally are the components of killed or attenuated bacteria used as vaccines.
      <br/>
      Extrinsic adjuvants are immunomodulators which are typically non-covalently linked to antigens and are formulated to enhance the host immune responses.
      <br/>
      Thus, adjuvants have been identified that enhance the immune response to antigens delivered parenterally.
      <br/>
      Some of these adjuvants are toxic, however, and can cause undesirable side-effects, making them unsuitable for use in humans and many animals.
      <br/>
      Indeed, only aluminum hydroxide and aluminum phosphate (collectively commonly referred to as alum) are routinely used as adjuvants in human and veterinary vaccines.
      <br/>
      The efficacy of alum in increasing antibody responses to diphtheria and tetanus toxoids is well established and an HBsAg vaccine has been adjuvanted with alum.
    </p>
    <p num="61">
      A wide range of extrinsic adjuvants can provoke potent immune responses to antigens.
      <br/>
      These include saponins complexed to membrane protein antigens (immune stimulating complexes), pluronic polymers with mineral oil, killed mycobacteria and mineral oil, Freund's complete adjuvant, bacterial products, such as muramyl dipeptide (MDP) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS), as well as lipid A, and liposomes.
    </p>
    <p num="62">
      To efficiently induce humoral immune responses (HIR) and cell-mediated immunity (CMI), immunogens are often emulsified in adjuvants.
      <br/>
      Many adjuvants are toxic, inducing granulomas, acute and chronic inflammations (Freund's complete adjuvant, FCA), cytolysis (saponins and pluronic polymers) and pyrogenicity, arthritis and anterior uveitis (LPS and MDP).
      <br/>
      Although FCA is an excellent adjuvant and widely used in research, it is not licensed for use in human or veterinary vaccines because of its toxicity.
    </p>
    <p num="63">Desirable characteristics of ideal adjuvants include:</p>
    <p num="64">
      (1) lack of toxicity;
      <br/>
      (2) ability to stimulate a long-lasting inmune response;
      <br/>
      (3) simplicity of manufacture and stability in Long-term storage;
      <br/>
      (4) ability to elicit both CMI and HIR to antigens administered by various routes, if required;
      <br/>
      (5) synergy with other adjuvants;
      <br/>
      (6) capability of selectively interacting with populations of antigen presenting cells (APC);
      <br/>
      (7) ability to specifically elicit appropriate TH 1 or TH 2 cell-specific immune responses; and
      <br/>
      (8) ability to selectively increase appropriate antibody isotype levels (for example, IgA) against antigens.

      U.S. Pat. No. 4,855,283 granted to Lockhoff et al on Aug. 8, 1989, which is incorporated herein by reference thereto, teaches glycolipid analogues including N-glycosylamides, N-glycosylureas and N-glycosylcarbamates, each of which is substituted in the sugar residue by an amino acid, as immuno-modulators or adjuvants.
      <br/>
      Thus, Lockhoff et al. 1991 (ref. 20) reported that N-glycolipid analogs displaying structural similarities to the naturally-occurring glycolipids, such as glycophospholipids and glycoglycerolipids, are capable of eliciting strong immune responses in both herpes simplex virus vaccine and pseudorabies virus vaccine.
      <br/>
      Some glycolipids have been synthesized from long chain-alkylamines and fatty acids that are linked directly with the sugars through the anomeric carbon atom, to mimic the functions of the naturally occurring lipid residues.

      <br/>
      Also, Nixon-George et al. 1990, (ref. 21) reported that octadecyl esters of aromatic amino acids complexed with a recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen, enhanced the host immune responses against hepatitis B virus.

    <p num="67">2. Immunoassays</p>
    <p num="68">
      The lactoferrin receptor proteins, analogs and/or fragments thereof of the present invention are useful as immunogens, as antigens in immunoassays including enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA), RIAs and other non-enzyme linked antibody binding assays or procedures known in the art for the detection of anti-Moraxella, lactoferrin receptor protein antibodies.
      <br/>
      In ELISA assays, the lactoferrin receptor protein, analogs and/or fragments corresponding to portions of Lfr protein, are immobilized onto a selected surface, for example, a surface capable of binding proteins or peptides such as the wells of a polystyrene microtiter plate.
      <br/>
      After washing to remove incompletely adsorbed lactoferrin receptor, analogs and/or fragments, a non-specific protein such as a solution of bovine serum albumin (BSA) or casein that is known to be antigenically neutral with regard to the test sample may be bound to the selected surface.
      <br/>
      This allows for blocking of nonspecific adsorption sites on the immobilizing surface and thus reduces the background caused by non-specific bindings of antisera onto the surface.
    </p>
    <p num="69">
      The immobilizing surface is then contacted with a sample, such as clinical or biological materials, to be tested in a manner conducive to immune complex (antigen/antibody) formation.
      <br/>
      This procedure may include diluting the sample with diluents, such as BSA, bovine gamma globulin (BGG) and/or phosphate buffered saline (PBS)/Tween. The sample is then allowed to incubate for from about 2 to 4 hours, at temperatures such as of the order of about 25 (degree)  to 37 (degree)  C. Following incubation, the sample-contacted surface is washed to remove non-immunocomplexed material.
      <br/>
      The washing procedure may include washing with a solution such as PBS/Tween or a borate buffer.
    </p>
    <p num="70">
      Following formation of specific immunocomplexes between the test sample and the bound lactoferrin receptor protein, analogs and/or fragments and subsequent washing, the occurrence, and even amount, of immunocomplex formation may be determined by subjecting the immunocomplex to a second antibody having specificity for the first antibody.
      <br/>
      If the test sample is of human origin, the second antibody is an antibody having specificity for human immunoglobulins and in general IgG.
      <br/>
      To provide detecting means, the second antibody may have an associated activity such as an enzymatic activity that will generate, for example, a color development upon incubating with an appropriate chromogenic substrate.
      <br/>
      Quantification may then achieved by measuring the degree of color generation using, for example, a spectrophotometer.

    <p num="71">3. Use of Sequences as Hybridization Probes</p>
    <p num="72">The nucleotide sequences of the present invention, comprising the sequence of the lactoferrin receptor gene, now allow for the identification and cloning of the lactoferrin receptor genes from any species of Moraxella.</p>
    <p num="73">
      The nucleotide sequences comprising the sequence of the lactoferrin receptor genes of the present invention are useful for their ability to selectively form duplex molecules with complementary stretches of other lfr genes.
      <br/>
      Depending on the application, a variety of hybridization conditions may be employed to achieve varying degrees of selectivity of the probe toward the other lfr genes.
      <br/>
      For a high degree of selectivity, relatively stringent conditions are used to form the duplexes, such as low salt and/or high temperature conditions, such as provided by 0.02 M to 0.15 M NaCl at temperatures of between about 50 (degree)  C. to 70 (degree)  C. For some applications, less stringent hybridization conditions are required such as 0.15 M to 0.9 M salt, at temperatures ranging from between about 20 (degree)  C. to 55 (degree)  C. Hybridization conditions can also be rendered more stringent by the addition of increasing amounts of formamide, to destabilize the hybrid duplex.
      <br/>
      Thus, particular hybridization conditions can be readily manipulated, and will generally be a method of choice depending on the desired results.
      <br/>
      In general, convenient hybridization temperatures in the presence of 50% formamide are: 42 (degree)  C. for a probe which is 95 to 100% homologous to the target fragment, 37 (degree)  C. for 90 to 95% homology and 32 (degree)  C. for 85 to 90% homology.
    </p>
    <p num="74">Such hybridization conditions may be employed to determine DNA sequences which encode a functional lactoferrin receptor of Moraxella and which hybridize under stringent conditions to any one of the DNA sequences (a) or (b), described above.</p>
    <p num="75">
      In a clinical diagnostic embodiment, the nucleic acid sequences of the lfr genes of the present invention may be used in combination with an appropriate means, such as a label, for determining hybridization.
      <br/>
      A wide variety of appropriate indicator means are known in the art, including radioactive, enzymatic or other ligands, such as avidin/biotin and digoxigenin-labelling, which are capable of providing a detectable signal.
      <br/>
      In some diagnostic embodiments, an enzyme tag such as urease, alkaline phosphatase or peroxidase, instead of a radioactive tag may be used.
      <br/>
      In the case of enzyme tags, calorimetric indicator substrates are known which can be employed to provide a means visible to the human eye or spectrophotometrically, to identify specific hybridization with samples containing lfr gene sequences.
    </p>
    <p num="76">
      The nucleic acid sequences of lfr genes of the present invention are useful as hybridization probes in is solution hybridizations and in embodiments employing solid-phase procedures.
      <br/>
      In embodiments involving solid-phase procedures, the test DNA (or RNA) from samples, such as clinical samples, including exudates, body fluids (e. g., serum, amniotic fluid, middle ear effusion, sputum, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid) or even tissues, is adsorbed or otherwise affixed to a selected matrix or surface.
      <br/>
      The fixed, single-stranded nucleic acid is then subjected to specific hybridization with selected probes comprising the nucleic acid sequences of the lfr genes or fragments thereof of the present invention under desired conditions.
      <br/>
      The selected conditions will depend on the particular circumstances based on the particular criteria required depending on, for example, the G+C contents, type of target nucleic acid, source of nucleic acid, size of hybridization probe etc.
      <br/>
      Following washing of the hybridization surface so as to remove non-specifically bound probe molecules, specific hybridization is detected, or even quantified, by means of the label.
      <br/>
      It is preferred to select nucleic acid sequence portions which are conserved among species of Moraxella.
      <br/>
      The selected probe may be at least 18 bp and may be in the range of about 30 to 90 bp.
    </p>
    <p num="77">4. Expression of the Lactoferrin Receptor Genes</p>
    <p num="78">
      Plasmid vectors containing replicon and control sequences which are derived from species compatible with the host cell may be used for the expression of the lactoferrin receptor genes in expression systems.
      <br/>
      The vector ordinarily carries a replication site, as well as marking sequences which are capable of providing phenotypic selection in transformed cells.
      <br/>
      For example, E. coli may be transformed using pBR322 which contains genes for ampicillin and tetracycline resistance and thus provides easy means for identifying transformed cells.
      <br/>
      The pBR322 plasmid, or other microbial plasmid or phage, must also contain, or be modified to contain, promoters which can be used by the host cell for expression of its own proteins.
    </p>
    <p num="79">
      In addition, phage vectors containing replicon and control sequences that are compatible with the host can be used as a transforming vector in connection with these hosts.
      <br/>
      For example, the phage in lambda GEM (tm) -11 may be utilized in making recombinant phage vectors which can be used to transform host cells, such as E. coli LE392.
    </p>
    <p num="80">
      Promoters commonly used in recombinant DNA construction include the  BETA -lactamase (penicillinase) and lactose promoter systems and other microbial promoters, such as the T7 promoter system as described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,952,496. Details concerning the nucleotide sequences of promoters are known, enabling a skilled worker to ligate them functionally with genes.
      <br/>
      The particular promoter used will generally be a matter of choice depending upon the desired results.
      <br/>
      Hosts that are appropriate for expression of the lactoferrin receptor genes, fragments or analogs thereof, may include E. coli, Bacillus species, Haemophilus, fungi, yeast, Moraxella, Bordetella, or the baculovirus expression system may be used.
    </p>
    <p num="81">
      In accordance with this invention, it is preferred to produce the lactoferrin receptor protein, fragment or analog thereof, by recombinant methods, particularly since the naturally occurring LfR protein as purified from a culture of a species of Moraxella may include trace amounts of toxic materials or other contaminants.
      <br/>
      This problem can be avoided by using recombinantly produced LfR protein in heterologous systems which can be isolated from the host in a manner to minimize contaminants, including other proteins of the Moraxella strain, in the purified material.
      <br/>
      Particularly desirable hosts for expression in this regard include Gram positive bacteria which do not have LPS and are, therefore, endotoxin free.
      <br/>
      Such hosts include species of Bacillus and may be particularly useful for the production of non-pyrogenic lactoferrin receptor proteins, fragments or analogs thereof.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, recombinant methods of production permit the manufacture of Lbp1 or Lbp2 or ORF3 or respective analogs or fragments thereof, separate from one another which is distinct from the normal combined proteins present in Moraxella.
    </p>
    <p num="82">Sequence Alignment and Analysis</p>
    <p num="83">
      Sequence alignments were performed using the ALIGN (Trademark) or GENALIGN (Trademark) computer programs (Inteligenetics Suite 5.4, Oxford Molecular).
      <br/>
      ALIGN.RTM. uses the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm (ref. 35) and its later modifications to locate regions of similarity between two sequences.
      <br/>
      Finding regions of maximum similarity between two sequences can be solved in a rigorous manner using the iterative matrix calculation of the Needleman and Wunsch 1997 algorithm.
      <br/>
      The analysis is restricted to regions with no internal deletions or insertions, joined by a minimum number of loop-outs or deletions.
      <br/>
      Sellers (ref. 36) developed a true metric measure of the "distance" between sequences and Waterman (ref. 37) extended this algorithm to include insertions and deletions of arbitrary length.
      <br/>
      Smith (ref. 38) improved the early algorithms to find the subsequences of maximum similarity.
      <br/>
      The algorithm has been used to analyze sequences as long as 5000 bases by dividing these sequences into segments of 200 to 400 bases, and then reassembling them into a final best match.
      <br/>
      This method of dividing the sequence and then reassembling it has proven quite robust.
      <br/>
      The algorithm permits the size of the segment to be specified which the program searches for similarities.
      <br/>
      The program then assembles the segments after checking overlaps of adjacent subsequences.
      <br/>
      The weighting of deletions and the relative size of overlaps may be controlled.
      <br/>
      The program displays the results to show the differences in closely related sequences.
    </p>
    <p num="84">
      GENALIGN.RTM. is a multiple alignment program.
      <br/>
      Up to 99 sequences using the Martinez/Regions (ref. 39) or Needleman-Wunsch (ref. 35) method may be analyzed for alignment.
      <br/>
      GENALIGN places the sequences in an order that puts the most closely aligned sequence pairs adjacent to each other.
      <br/>
      A consensus sequence is displayed under the multiple sequence alignments.
      <br/>
      The sequences used in developing the consensus sequence file for use in other programs.

      GENALIGN allows the parameters of the search to be changed so that alternate alignments of the sequences can be formed.

      A series of Sau3AI restriction digests of chromosomal DNA, in final volumes of 10  MU L each, were carried out in order to optimize the conditions necessary to generate maximal amounts of restriction fragments within a 15 to 23 kb size range.
      <br/>
      Using the optimized digestion conditions, a large-scale digestion was set up in a 100  MU L volume, containing the following: 50  MU L of chromosomal DNA (290  MU g/ml), 33  MU L water, 10  MU L 10 * Sau3A buffer (New England Biolabs), 1.0  MU L BSA (10 mg/ml, New England Biolabs), and 6.3  MU L Sau3A (0.04 U/ MU L).
      <br/>
      Following a 15 min. incubation at 37 (degree)  C., the digestion was terminated by the addition of 10  MU L of 100 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0)-10 mM EDTA-0.1% bromophenol blue-50% glycerol (loading buffer).

      A cysteine residue at position 32 is preceded by a consensus sequence for lipoproteins suggesting that Lbp2, like Tbp2, is a lipoprotein.
