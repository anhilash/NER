    <p num="2">The invention relates to the objects characterized in the claims, i.e., pharmaceutical agents that contain monomeric, perfluoroalkyl-substituted metal complexes and complex salts in tumor therapy and interventional radiology.</p>
    <p num="3">The use of foreign materials--brought by injection into the blood circulation to induce an embolism there--was proposed as early as at the beginning of this century �Dawbarn, Journal of the American Medical Association 43:792, (1904)�.</p>
    <p num="4">
      This idea was taken up seriously again only about 30 years ago (Young, British Medicinal Journal 283, 1144, 1981).
      <br/>
      Embolization was used for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes, especially for the treatment of tumors.
      <br/>
      Embolization of the vascular trunk, which supplies a tumor area with blood, is a technique that is used to bring about either a permanent vascular block and in so doing to promote tumor necrosis or a temporary embolization to increase the therapeutic effect of a simultaneously co-administered chemotherapy agent.
      <br/>
      The last-mentioned technique is referred to as chemoembolization.
      <br/>
      The advantage of such a treatment is its local limit.
      <br/>
      A condition is the presence of a sufficiently large vessel (i.e., a vessel that makes possible a catheterization) that supplies the tumor with blood.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      In humans, tumors in the liver are especially accessible for embolization therapy.
      <br/>
      Liver tumors are supplied with blood via the hepatic artery 80-100%.
      <br/>
      The normal liver parenchyma, however, is supplied mainly (about 75%) by the portal vein.
      <br/>
      Consequently, a selective treatment of primary and metastatic liver cancer can be achieved by embolization of the hepatic arteries.

      Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is an event that occurs rather rarely in Europe and the USA, but it is regarded in Asia (Japan, South Korea) and Africa as the most common malignant tumor disease, which in a large number of cases accompanies cirrhosis of the liver, caused by Hepatitis B and C �Therapie Konzepte Onkologie �Therapy Concept Oncology, see Seber, J. Schutte (Editors) Springer, 536-545, (1995)�. Despite extensive efforts, to date no major improvement in the very poor prognosis has been achieved in the case of this disease.
      <br/>
      Both untreated and after systemic treatment with cytostatic agents (mainly 5-fluorouracil, mitomycin C, cisplatin, doxorubicin), the average survival time is 1-9 months after a diagnosis is established �K.

    </p>
    <p num="7">
      A worthy goal of new therapy principles is mainly an improvement in the quality of life for the patients, since a complete cure is very difficult to achieve owing to the basic primary disease Hepatitis B according to present understanding.
      <br/>
      The surgical removal of the tumor represents high stress just as does systemic chemotherapy.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      In recent years, chemoembolization has emerged as the method of choice.
      <br/>
      It is defined as the simultaneous administration of a cytostatic agent mixed with an embolization agent for the purpose of forming a local, temporary embolus, from which the pharmaceutical substance is released slowly and basically over a long period of time (optimum 5-8 days).
      <br/>
      Because of the limitation of blood flow, it results in an increased pharmaceutical substance exposure of the tumor tissue �P. H. Madoule et al.
      <br/>
      Chemoembolization: Principles and Perspectives, J. Microencapsulation 1, 21-25, (1984)�. The locally developing ischemia supports the control of the tumor.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      In the methods of chemoembolization that are used most often in Japan and South Korea, an emulsion consisting of Lipiodol.RTM. (ethyl ester of iodinated poppyseed oil) and aqueous cytostatic agent solutions are used as a peripheral embolizate and as a depot.
      <br/>
      Since, there are no corresponding ready-to-use preparations on the market, the emulsions are produced in clinics on the spot using "home-made" remedies.
      <br/>
      This causes the quality of the preparations to vary greatly from clinic to clinic, and no precise and reproducible data on the most parameters such as particle size, retention time in the tumor and extractability exist.
      <br/>
      The emulsion is introduced via a percutaneous catheter selectively/superselectively in the tumor-carrying branch of the hepatic artery.
      <br/>
      Generally, the arterial supply is then stopped in addition by Gelfoam.RTM. particles, to prevent too quick flushing of the lipiodol emulsion.
      <br/>
      Lipiodol.RTM. accumulates to a certain extent in HCC (T.

      <br/>
      A problem in this process is that a nonquantifiable portion passes through the capillary bed and then accumulates in the lung or spleen.
      <br/>
      The embolism is present over a lengthy period (1-4 weeks) and, in addition to the lengthy retention time of the cytostatic-agent in the tumor, serves to place an ischemic stress on the tumor.
      <br/>
      Owing to deficient biodegradability, Lipiodol.RTM. is virtually not excreted and remains in the necrotized tumor tissue, which can thus be resorbed only inadequately.
      <br/>
      Generally, this treatment is regularly repeated at an interval of several weeks.
      <br/>
      With this method, survival rates are somewhat below those of surgical removal of the tumor, but significantly above those of chemotherapy alone (T.

    </p>
    <p num="16">
      The high viscosity of the compounds that are suitable for use according to the invention results, in the case of small shearing forces, such as those that prevail in the capillary bed of tissues, in a reliable, temporary sealing of these vessels.

      <br/>
      This is advantageous, since the cytostatic agent that is provided in the formulation is released in this way as from a depot over a prolonged time in direct proximity with the tumor and because after the embolus dissolves, additional administrations are possible.

      To provide neutral complex compounds, enough of the desired bases can be added, for example, to the acid complex salts in aqueous solution or suspension to ensure that the neutral point is reached.
      <br/>
      The solution obtained can then be evaporated to dryness in a vacuum. often, it is advantageous to precipitate the neutral salts formed by adding water-miscible solvents, such as, for example, lower alcohols (methanol, ethanol, isopropanol and others), lower ketones (acetone and others), polar ethers (tetrahydrofuran, dioxane, 1,2-dimethoxyethane and others) and to obtain easily isolated and readily purified crystallizates.
      <br/>
      It has proven especially advantageous to add the desired base as early as during the complexing of the reaction mixture and thus to save a process step.

      <br/>
      Suitable additives are, for example, physiologically harmless buffers (such as, for example, tromethamine), additives of complexing agents or weak complexes (such as, for example, diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid or the Ca complexes that correspond to the metal complexes according to the invention) or--if necessary--electrolytes, such as, for example, sodium chloride or--if necessary--antioxidants such as, for example, ascorbic acid.
    </p>
    <p num="268">
      In principle, it is also possible to produce the pharmaceutical agents according to the invention without isolating the complexes.
      <br/>
      In any case, special care must be used to undertake the chelation so that the complexes according to the invention are practically free from noncomplexed metal ions that have a toxic effect.

    <p num="269">
      This can be ensured, for example, with the aid of color indicators such as xylenol orange by control titrations during the production process.

      The good water-solubility and low osmolality of the agents according to the invention make it possible to produce highly concentrated solutions, so that osmotic effects do not lead to local undesired reactions.
      <br/>
      In addition, the agents according to the invention exhibit not only high stability in vitro, but also surprisingly high stability in vivo, so that a release or an exchange of the ions that are bound to the complexes--and toxic in themselves--is carried out only extremely slowly within the time in which the compounds of formula I are completely eliminated again.

    <p num="273">The complex compounds of formula I can also be used advantageously as susceptibility reagents and as shift reagents for in vivo NMR spectroscopy.</p>
