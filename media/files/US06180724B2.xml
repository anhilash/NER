    <heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">The present invention relates to an absorbing agent suited for use in sanitary goods such as paper diaper (disposable diaper), sanitary napkin, incontinence pad, etc., and a method of manufacturing the same and also relates to an absorbent product containing such absorbing agent.</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="3">Recently, an absorbent resin is widely used in sanitary goods such as paper diaper, sanitary napkin, incontinence pad, etc., for the purpose of absorbing liquid.</p>
    <p num="4">Examples of known absorbent resins include: a partially neutralized crosslinked polymer of polyacrylic acid (Japanese Laid-Open Patent Publication No. 84304/1980 (Tokukaisho 55-84304), Japanese Laid-Open Patent Publication No. 108407/1980 (Tokukaisho 55-108407) and Japanese Laid-Open Patent Publication No. 133413/1980 (Tokukaisho 55-133413)); a hydrolyzed graft polymer of starch-acrylonitrile (Japanese Examined Patent Publication No. 43995/1974 (Tokukosho 46-43995)); a neutralized graft polymer of starch-acrylic acid (Japanese Laid-Open Patent Publication No. 125468/1976 (Tokukaisho 51-125468)); a saponified copolymer of vinyl acetate-acrylic ester (Japanese Laid-Open Patent Publication No. 14689/1977 (Tokukaisho 52-14689)); a hydrolyzed copolymer of acrylonitrile or of acrylamide (Japanese Examined Patent Publication No. 15959/1978 (Tokukosho 53-15959)); a crosslinked polymer of cationic monomer (Japanese Laid-Open Patent Publication No. 154709/1983 (Tokukaisho 58-154709) and Japanese Laid-Open Patent Publication No. 154710/1983 (Tokukaisho 58-154710)).</p>
    <p num="5">
      Notable properties of the absorbent resin include absorbing capacity and absorbency under pressure when it is in contact with an aqueous liquid like a body fluid, gel strength, and absorbing power of absorbing liquid from a base material containing an aqueous liquid, etc.
      <br/>
      Conventionally, the absorbent resins having some of the above-mentioned properties which show desirable properties (absorption properties) in their applications of paper diaper, sanitary napkin, etc., as well as absorbent materials and the absorbent product using such absorbent resins have been proposed.
    </p>
    <p num="6">Examples of such absorbent resins, absorbent materials and absorbent products include: an absorbent resin disclosing a combination of a specific gel capacity, shear modulus and an extraction polymer content (U.S. Pat. No. 4,654,039); an absorbent resin having predeterined ranges of absorbing capacity and absorbency under pressure and gel stability, and a paper diaper and a sanitary napkin using such absorbent resin (Japanese Laid-Open Patent Publication No. 185550/1985 (Tokukaisho 60-185550)), (Japanese Laid-Open Patent Publication No. 185551/1985 (Tokukaisho 60-185551)) and (Japanese Laid-Open Patent Publication No. 185804/1985 (Tokukaisho 60-185804)); a paper diaper using an absorbent resin having predetermined ranges of absorbing capacity, absorbency under pressure and a gel stability (Japanese Laid-Open Patent Publication No. 185805/1985 (Tokukaisho 60-185805)); an absorbent product having predetermined absorbing capacity, absorbing power and water soluble content (Japanese Laid-Open Patent Publication No. 21902/1988 (Tokukaisho 63-21902)); an absorbent sanitary product including an absorbent resin having predetermined ranges of absorbing capacity, absorbing capacity under pressure, and a gel breaking strength (Japanese Laid-Open Patent Publication No. 99861/1988 (Tokukaisho 63-99861)); a paper diaper including an absorbent resin having predetermined ranges of absorbing capacity and absorbency under pressure (Japanese Laid-Open Patent Publication No. 34167/1990 (Tokukaihei 2-34167)); an absorbing agent containing an absorbent resin having predetermined ranges of absorbing capacity under pressure and particle diameter (European Patent No. 339,461); an absorbing agent including at least a predetermined amount of an absorbent resin having predetermined ranges of absorbency under pressure and absorbing capacity under pressure in a short period of time (European Patent No. 443,627); an absorbing synthethic material having at least predetermined amount of absorbent resin having predetermined ranges of deformation and absorbing index when applying a load (European Patent No. 532,002).</p>
    <p num="7">
      Recently, still thinner sanitary goods such as a paper diaper and a sanitary napkin of higher quality have been demanded, and an amount of use of the absorbent resin or weight percent of the absorbent resin in the absorbent material mainly composed of absorbent resin and hydrophilic fiber (hereinafter simply referred to as a resin concentration) has been increasing.
      <br/>
      Namely, by reducing the amount of hydrophilic fiber having a small bulk specific gravity and increasing the amount of the absorbent resin having a large bulk specific gravity, the ratio of the absorbent resin in the absorbent material is raised, and a thinner sanitary material can be achieved without reducing the absorbing capacity.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      However, earnest researches have been made by the inventors of the present invention in order to increase the absorbing amount of the sanitary material, for example, by increasing the resin concentration in the absorbent material.
      <br/>
      As a result, the inventors have found that the absorbent material having a higher resin concentration than conventional absorbent material cannot be used without having problems such as leakage of aqueous liquid from the sanitary goods, etc., only by controlling the described absorbing capacity, absorbency under pressure, gel strength, absorbing capacity, etc.
      <br/>
      For example, as to the absorbent resin which has been viewed with interest in which only absorbing capacity under pressure is large, by raising the resin concentration, the liquid dispersibility of the absorbent material is significantly reduced.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      Further researches have been made by the inventors on absorbing properties of the absorbent material having higher resin concentration than conventional absorbent material.
      <br/>
      As a result, they have found that in the case of using a mixture of a known absorbent resin, a hydrophilic fiber is used as an absorbent material, although when a resin concentration is low, the absorbent material shows a predetermined level of absorbing properties, when a resin concentration is above 40 percent by weight, such unpreferable conditions that the liquid dispersibility is rapidly lowered, the absorbing capacity of weight per unit of the absorbent material is lowered, the water absorbing capacity cannot be ensured for a long period of time; an amount of wet back of the aqueous liquid increases, etc., would occur.
      <br/>
      Namely, when a mixture of the known absorbent resin and the hydrophilic fiber is used as an absorbent material, the above-mentioned problems would arise.
    </p>
    <p num="10">Accordingly, an object of the present invention is to eliminate the above-mentioned problems and to provide an absorbing agent having excellent properties (absorbing properties) such as very high liquid diffusivity and a stability over time of the absorbing capacity irrespectively of the resin concentration or the structure of the absorbent material, for example, when it is used as sanitary goods, etc., as well as a process of manufacturing such absorbing agent and the absorbent product including the absorbing agent.</p>
    <p num="11">Another object of the present invention is to provide an absorbing agent having excellent properties (absorbing properties, etc.,) of maintaining very high liquid diffusivity and absorbing capacity even with high resin concentration.</p>
    <heading>DISCLOSURES OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="12">
      In order to achieve the above object, earnest researches on the absorbing agent and the manufacturing method thereof have been made by inventors of the present invention.
      <br/>
      As a result, an absorbing agent obtained by synthesizing the precursor of the absorbing agent by performing an aqueous solution polymerization of the hydrophilic unsaturated monomer having more than 50 mole percent neutralized acrylic acid as a main component in the presence of the crosslinking agent and dispersant, and applying a heat treatment in a presence of a surface crosslinking agent after adjusting the precursor of the absorbing agent so as to have a predetermined range of water content and a predetermined range of the particle diameter exhibit excellent properties such as very high liquid diffusivity and stable absorbing capacity over time.
      <br/>
      Namely, the absorbing agent obtained by synthesizing the precursor of the absorbing agent and applying the heat treatment in a presence of a specific surface crosslinking agent, the absorbent material and the absorbent product including such absorbing agent exhibit excellent performances such as very high liquid diffusivity, absorbing capacity, etc., even when the amount of use of the absorbent resin and the resin concentration are high.
    </p>
    <p num="13">Namely, in order to solve the above-mentioned problem, an absorbing agent of the present invention is characterized in that the diffusing absorbency under pressure measured when 60 minutes has elapsed after an absorption is started is 25 g/g.</p>
    <p num="14">In order to solve the above-mentioned problem, the absorbent material of the present invention may be characterized by including not less than 40 percent by weight of the absorbing agent.</p>
    <p num="15">In order to solve the above-mentioned problem, the absorbent material of the present invention may be characterized in that its diffusing absorbency under pressure measured when 60 minutes has elapsed after the absorption is started is not less than 25 g/g, and the water soluble content is above 0, and the absorbing agent is not more than 7 percent by weight.</p>
    <p num="16">The following will explain the present invention in details.</p>
    <p num="17">The diffusing absorbency under pressure in the present invention suggests a new property value for evaluating the absorbency under pressure of the absorbing agent and the absorbent material in view of the diffusivity of the aqueous liquid wherein the weighing capacity of the absorbent resin is high and resin particles are tightly linked one another by an external force.</p>
    <p num="18">
      The diffusing absorbency under pressure is computed based on values measured when a predetermined time elapsed after the absorption is started under predetermined conditions, for example, after 20 minutes, 30 minutes, and 60 minutes, etc.
      <br/>
      The method of measuring the diffusing absorbency under pressure will be explained in below-mentioned embodiments.
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      The diffusing absorbency under pressure enables evaluations of new properties of the absorbing agent, the absorbent material, i.e., the absorbent resin.
      <br/>
      Namely, the diffusing absorbency under pressure evaluates the uniformity and the diffusivity of the absorbent resin in the aqueous liquid in a resin layer direction (hereinafter simply referred to as a lateral direction), or an actual absorbing capacity of the absorbent resin as a whole.
      <br/>
      The liquid diffusivity in a lateral direction (liquid diffusivity and liquid transmissivity) is an important factor of absorbing a large amount of aqueous liquid.
      <br/>
      Based on the results of evaluation, for example, the absorbing ability of the absorbent material mainly composed of the absorbing agent (absorbent resin) and hydrophilic fiber can be easily estimated especially in the absorbent resin in the absorbent material having high percent by weight (hereinafter referred to as a resin concentration) of the absorbent resin.
      <br/>
      The configuration of the absorbent material will be explained later.
    </p>
    <p num="20">
      Many prior art applications disclose evaluations of the absorbing capacity under pressure.
      <br/>
      However, in conventional methods, the absorbing capacity is evaluated only in the direction orthogonal to the resin layer direction (hereinafter simply referred to as a longitudinal direction).
      <br/>
      Therefore, in this method, the uniformity and the diffusivity of the aqueous liquid are hardly known.
      <br/>
      Therefore, from the conventional evaluation results, the absorbing capacity of the absorbent material in a paper diaper, etc., adopting the absorbent material having a high resin concentration cannot be estimated accurately.
    </p>
    <p num="21">
      The water soluble content in the present invention suggests property values for evaluating the rediffusivity of the aqueous liquid after a long time elapsed when the absorbent resin has excellent diffusing absorbency under pressure and evaluating the ability of maintaining absorbed aqueous liquid for a long period of time.
      <br/>
      The described water soluble content is measured under predetermined conditions.
      <br/>
      The method of measuring the water soluble content will be described in detail in the below-mentioned embodiments.
    </p>
    <p num="22">
      Even if the absorbent resin has excellent diffusing absorbency under pressure, if the water soluble content thereof is outside the predetermined range of the present invention, the amount of wet back of the aqueous liquid after a long period of time elapsed tends to increase.
      <br/>
      On the other hand, the absorbing agent, i.e., the absorbent resin of the present invention satisfies both the diffusing absorbency under pressure and the water soluble content.
      <br/>
      The absorbing agent having excellent properties such as very high liquid diffusivity and stable absorbing capacity for a long period of time without being much affected by the configuration of the resin concentration or the absorbent material, etc., the process of manufacturing thereof and the absorbent product including such absorbing agent will be explained.
    </p>
    <p num="23">
      The absorbing agent of the present invention has the diffusing absorbency under pressure of not less than 25 g/g and the water soluble content of not more than 7 percent by weight.
      <br/>
      In the absorbing agent, i.e., the absorbent resin having the diffusing absorbency under pressure of less than 25 g/g, i.e., the absorbent resin, the liquid diffusivity in the lateral direction in the absorbent material (high concentration) with an increased resin concentration is deteriorated, and the absorbing capacity of the absorbent material is lowered.
      <br/>
      In the present invention, it is preferable that the diffusing absorbency under pressure is not less than 28 g/g, more preferably not less than 30 g/g, and most preferably not less than 32 g/g.
      <br/>
      Even if the absorbent resin has the diffusing absorbency under pressure of not less than 25 g/g, if the water soluble content is above 7 percent by weight, the amount of wet back of the aqueous liquid after a long time elapsed would increase.
      <br/>
      It is preferable that the water soluble content is not more than 5 percent by weight, and more preferably not more than 3 percent by weight.
      <br/>

      On the other hand, when less than 0.001 part by weight of surface crosslinking agent is used, it is difficult to obtain an effect of improving the diffusing absorbency under pressure of the absorbing agent.
      <br/>
      Therefore, such condition is not preferable.
    </p>
    <p num="54">
      When mixing the precursor of the absorbing agent with the surface crosslinking agent, it is preferable to use water as a solvent.
      <br/>
      The amount of use of water differs depending on the kinds, particle diameter, water content, etc., of the precursor of the absorbing agent.
      <br/>
      However, the amount of use of water is preferably above 0 and less than 20 parts by weight, more preferably in the range of 0.5-10 parts by weight, with respect to 100 parts by weight of the solid portion of the precursor of the absorbing agent.
    </p>
    <p num="55">
      When mixing the precursor of the absorbing agent with the surface crosslinking agent, a hydrophilic organic solvent may be used as a solvent if necessary.
      <br/>
      Examples of such hydrophilic organic solvent include: lower alcohol such as methyl alcohol, ethyl alcohol, n-propyl alcohol, isopropyl alcohol, n-butyl alcohol, isobutyl alcohol, t-butyl alcohol, etc.; ketone such as acetone, etc.; ether such as dioxane, tetrahydrofuran, etc.; amide such as N,N-dimethyl formamide, etc., sulfoxide such as dimethylsulfoxide, etc.
      <br/>
      Suitable amount of use of the hydrophilic organic solvent varies depending on kinds, particle diameter and water content of the precursor of the absorbing agent.
      <br/>
      However, the content of the hydrophilic organic solvent is preferably not more than 20 parts by weight, more preferably in a range of from 0.1-10 parts by weight of 100 parts of the solid portion of the precursor of the absorbing agent.
    </p>
    <p num="56">
      Then, when mixing the precursor of the absorbing agent with the surface crosslinking agent, for example, after dispersing the precursor of the absorbing agent in the hydrophilic organic solvent, the surface crosslinking agent may be mixed.
      <br/>
      However, the mixing method is not especially limited.
      <br/>
      Among various mixing processes, the process wherein the surface crosslinking agent which is dissolved in water and/or hydrophilic organic solvent- when an occasion demands, is mixed with the precursor of the absorbing agent directly or by spraying or dropping it is preferable.
      <br/>
      When mixing with water, fine particles undissolvable in water or the surface active agent, etc., may be used in combination.
    </p>
    <p num="57">
      The mixer for use in mixing the precursor of the absorbing agent with the surface crosslinking agent preferably has a strong mixing force so that both can be mixed homogeneously and surely.
      <br/>
      Examples of such mixer include: a cylindrical mixer, a double wall conical mixer, V-shaped mixer, ribbon type mixer, screw-type mixer, flow-type oven rotary disk mixer, air-flow type mixer, two-arm type kneader, internal mixer, grinding kneader, rotary mixer, screw type extruder, etc.
    </p>
    <p num="58">
      After mixing the precursor of the absorbing agent with the surface crosslinking agent, a heat treatment is applied so as to crosslink around the surface of the precursor of the absorbing agent.
      <br/>
      Suitable temperature of applying the heat treatment varies depending on the surface crosslinking agent to be used.
      <br/>
      However, it is preferably in the range between 80 (degree)  C. and 250 (degree)  C., more preferably in the range between 120 (degree)  C. and 230 (degree)  C. When using the first surface crosslinking agent and the second surface crosslinking agent in combination, the heat treatment is suitably applied at a temperature not less than 160 (degree)  C. When the heat treatment is applied at temperature below 80 (degree)  C. (below 160 (degree)  C. when using both the first and second surface crosslinking agents), a uniform crosslinking structure is not formed.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the absorbent resin having excellent properties such as diffusing absorbency under pressure, etc., cannot be obtained.
      <br/>
      Therefore, such condition is not preferable.
      <br/>
      Besides, as it takes a long time for applying the heat treatment, the productivity is low.
      <br/>
      On the other hand, when the heat treatment is applied at above 250 (degree)  C., properties of the precursor of the absorbing agent are lowered, which results in poor performances of the absorbing agent.
      <br/>
      Thus, such condition is not preferable.
    </p>
    <p num="59">
      The described heat treatment may be applied using general dryer, heating oven, etc.
      <br/>
      Examples of such dryer include: groove type mixing dryer, rotary dryer, disk dryer, fluidized layer dryer, air-flow type dryer, infrared radiation dryer, etc.
    </p>
    <p num="60">
      The absorbing agent resulting from the described manufacturing process has a diffusing absorbency under pressure of above 25 g/g when 60 minutes has elapsed after the absorption started, and a water soluble content in the range between 0 percent by weight and 7 percent by weight.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the absorbing agent has described excellent absorbing properties.
      <br/>
      The reason why the absorbing agent of the present invention shows excellent performances in its diffusing absorbency under pressure, etc., is not specified.
      <br/>
      However, it can be estimated that by using the dispersant as well as a specific amount of the crosslinking agent prepared so as to have a specific range of high-boiling point component, the high-boiling point component is homogeneously dispersed in the reaction system, and the crosslinking ability of the main component thereof disturbed by the high-boiling point component can be fully exhibited.
      <br/>
      In the meantime, the crosslinking reaction by the high-boiling point component can be performed effectively.
      <br/>
      As a result, the content of the water-soluble component can be significantly reduced.
    </p>
    <p num="61">
      The described absorbing agent is provided with excellent absorbing properties.
      <br/>
      Therefore, in the case of applying the absorbing agent to an absorbent material, for example, sanitary goods such as a paper diaper, sanitary napkin, incontinence pad, etc., even when the resin concentration in the absorbent material is high, such excellent properties that high diffusing absorbency under pressure, and low water soluble content can be obtained irrespectively of the structure of the absorbent material.
      <br/>
      In addition, such sanitary goods have small amount of wet back after a long period of time, very high liquid diffusivity, and a stabiity of keeping the amount of water for a long period of time, thereby providing an absorbent product which shows excellent performances.
      <br/>
      Such absorbing agent can be suitably used, especially in sanitary goods, such as paper diaper, sanitary napkin, a so-called incontinence pad, and the like, to meet the demand of higher performances and thinner type thereof.
      <br/>
      Thus, the described process enables the absorbing agent which shows excellent properties to be manufactured.
    </p>
    <p num="62">In addition, deodorant, perfume, inorganic powder, foaming agent, pigment, dye, hydrophilic short fiber, synthetic fiber, fertilizer, oxidizing agent, reducing agent, water, salts, etc., may be added to the resulting absorbing agent and the absorbent material prepared by the process of the present invention, which enables the absorbing agent, absorbent material and absorbent product to have various functions.</p>
    <p num="63">Next, the absorbing agent, the absorbent material and the absorbent product which show excellent properties (absorbing properties) such as high liquid diffusivity and water absorbency under pressure, etc., even if the resin concentration is raised will be explained.</p>
    <p num="64">
      The absorbent material of the present invention includes at least 40 percent by weight of the absorbing agent having the diffusing absorbency under pressure of at least 25 g/g when 60 has minutes elapsed after the absorption is started, preferably 50 percent by weight, more preferably 60 percent by weight, and most preferably 70 percent by weight.
      <br/>
      The absorbing agent having the diffusing absorbency under pressure of at least 25 g/g measured when 60 minutes has elapsed after the absorption is started is unpreferable because the liquid diffusivity in the lateral direction in the absorbent material (high concentration) having an increased resin concentration is lowered, and the absorbing capacity of the absorbent material becomes small.
      <br/>
      It is preferable that the diffusing absorbency under pressure after 60 minutes elapsed is not less than 30 g/g.
      <br/>
      In addition, even when the absorbing agent having the diffusing absorbency under pressure of not less than 25 g/g is included, per unit absorbing capacity of the absorbent material having the ratio of absorbing agent of less than 40 percent by weight would be lowered.
      <br/>
      In the absorbent material of the present invention, in addition to the diffusing absorbency under pressure, when 60 minutes has elapsed after the absorption is started, it is preferable to include the absorbing agent having the diffusing absorbency under pressure of 15 g/g computed based on the value measured when 30 minutes has elapsed after the absorption is started.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, it is most preferable to include the absorbing agent having the diffusing absorbency under pressure of at least 15 g/g computed based on the value measured when 20 minutes has elapsed after the absorption is started.
    </p>
    <p num="65">
      Namely, it is preferable that the absorbing agent of the present invention has the diffusing absorbency under pressure of not less than 15 g/g when 30 minutes has elapsed after the absorption is started and the diffusing absorbency under pressure of not less than 25 g/g when 60 minutes has elapsed.
      <br/>
      It is more preferable that the diffusing absorbency under pressure is not less than 15 g/g when 20 minutes has elapsed after the absorption is started, and the diffusing absorbency under pressure measrued when 60 minutes has elapsed after the absorption is started is not less than 25 g/g.
      <br/>
      It is the most preferable that the diffusing absorbency under pressure measured when 60 minutes has elapsed is not less than 15 g/g, and the diffusing absorbency under pressure measured when 60 minutes has elapsed is not less than 30 g/g.
      <br/>
      The absorbing agent has the diffusing absorbency under pressure of less than 15 g/g when 30 minutes has elapsed after the absorption is started is unpreferable because the liquid diffusivity in lateral direction would be deteriorated, and the absorbing force of the absorbent material is lowered.
    </p>
    <p num="66">
      Other than the absorbing agent, the absorbent material in accordance with the present invention may include the hydrophilic fiber if necessary.
      <br/>
      The structure of the absorbent material may be the aforementioned structure, but is not especially limited.
      <br/>
      However, it is preferable that the absorbing agent and the hydrophilic fiber are homogeneously mixed so as to have the ratio of the absorbing agent in the absorbent material not less than 40 percent by weight.
      <br/>
      It is still more preferable that the absorbing agent and the hydrophilic fiber are uniformly mixed so as to have the absorbing agent used in an amount not less than 50 percent by weight, preferably 60 percent by weight, more preferably 70 percent by weight with respect to the total amount of the absorbing agent and the hydrophilic agent.
      <br/>
      By the described arrangement, the absorbent material can fully exhibit the absorbing properties.
      <br/>
      In addition, the higher is the resin concentration in the absorbent material, the more obvious are the properties of the absorbing agent and the absorbent material of the present invention.

      The absorbing agent of the present invention is obtained by first synthesizing the precursor of the absorbing agent and then applying the heat treatment to the precursor of the absorbing agent in a presence of a specific surface crosslinking agent.
      <br/>
      The precursor of the absorbing agent has an average particle diameter in the range of 200-600  MU m, and includes 10 percent by weight of particles having a particle diameter of 106  MU m. Such precursor of the absorbing agent is a resin for use in forming hydrogel by absorbing a large amount of water.
      <br/>
      For example, the precursor of the absorbing agent is synthesized by the aqueous solution polymerization.
      <br/>
      Examples of the precursor of the absorbing agent include: a partially neutralized crosslinked polymer of polyacrylic acid, a hydrolyzed graft polymer of starch-acrylonitrile, a neutralized graft polymer of starch-acrylic acid, a saponified copolymer of vinyl acetate-acrylic ester, a hydrolyzed copolymer of acrylonitrile or of acrylamide, or a crosslinkied polymer thereof, crosslinked denatured polyvinyl alcohol containing carboxyl group, a copolymer of crosslinked isobutylene-maleic anhydride, and the like.

      The precursor of the absorbing agent may be a copolymer of the monomer and the other monomer which is copolymerizable with the monomer.
      <br/>
      Examples of the other monomer include: the exemplified unsaturated monomer, i.e., the anionic unsaturated monomer and salts thereof; a nonionic unsaturated monomer having a hydrophilic group; a cationic unsaturated monomer, etc.

    <p num="71">
      The precursor of the absorbing agent includes a carboxyl group.

      The amount of the included carboxyl group in the precursor is not especially limited.
      <br/>
      However, it is preferable that the carboxyl group of not less than 0.01 equivalent value exists with respect to 100 g of the precursor of the absorbing agent.
      <br/>
      When the precursor of the absorbing agent is, for example, a crosslinked polymer of partially neutralized polyacrylic acid, it is preferable that the ratio of unneutralized polyacrylic acid in the crosslinked compound is in the range of 1-60 mole percent, more preferably 10-50 mole percent.

    <p num="72">
      It is preferable that the inside of the precursor of the absorbing agent is crosslinked by reacting or copolymerizing with the crosslinking agent including plural polymerizable unsaturated groups and plural reactive groups.

      The precursor of the absorbing agent may be the self crosslinkable type which does not require the crosslinking agent.
      <br/>
      Examples of such crosslinking agent include: N,N'-methylenebis(meth)acrylamide, (poly)ethylene glycol di(meth)acrylate, (poly)propylene glycol di(meth)acrylate, trimethylolpropane di(meth)acrylate, trimethylolpropane tri(meth)acrylate, glycerol tri(meth)acrylate, glycerin acrylate methacrylate, ethylene oxide denatured trimethylolpropane tri (meth)acrylate, pentaerythritol tetra (meth)acrylate, dipentaerythritol hexa(meth)acrylate, triallyl cyanurate, triallyl isocyanurate, triallylphosphate, triallylamine, poly(meth)aryloxyalkane, (poly)ethylene glycol diglycidyl ether, glycerol diglycidyl ether, ethylene glycol, polyethylene glycol, propylene glycol, glycerol, pentaerythritol, ethylenediamine, polyethyleneimine, glycidyl(meth)acrylate, etc.
      <br/>
      Only one kind of the above-listed crosslinking agent may be adopted, or two or more kinds thereof may be suitably mixed and adopted.

      Therefore, it is required to set the crosslinked density in a vicinity of the surface of the precursor of the absorbing agent higher than the inside thereof by adopting the surface crosslinking agent.
      <br/>
      Namely, by crosslinking around the surface of the precursor of the absorbing agent using a specific surface crosslinking agent, the absorbing agent of the present invention can be achieved.

      The absorbing agent in accordance with the present invention is prepared by adjusting the precursor of the absorbing agent obtained by the aqueous solution polymerization so as to have an average particle diameter of 200-600  MU m, and not more than 10 percent by weight of the particle diameter below 106  MU m by classification, etc., and thereafter applying a heat treatment to the precursor of the absorbing agent in the presence of the specific surface crosslinking agent.

      In addition, in the case where the average particle diameter is outside the range of 200-600  MU m, and the case where the ratio of the particles having a diameter of 106  MU m is above 10 percent by weight, absorbing agents having excellent properties such as diffusing absorbency under pressure, etc., cannot be obtained.

      In the case of adopting only the first surface crosslinking agent of at least one kind, or the second surface crosslinking agent of at least one kind, it may be difficult to obtain the absorbing agent having excellent performances of the diffusing absorbency under pressure, etc.

      Suitable temperature of applying the heat treatment varies depending on the surface crosslinking agent.

When the heat treatment is applied at a temperature below 160 (degree)  C., a homogeneous crosslinking structure may not be formed, and an absorbing agent having excellent performances in its diffusing absorbency under pressure, etc., cannot be obtained.

      In addition, since a long time is required for applying the heat treatment, a productivity would be lowered.

      On the other hand, when applying the heat treatment at a temperature above 250 (degree)  C., the properties of the precursor of the absorbing agent are lowered, and the performances of the absorbing agent are poor.

    <p num="88">
      Hereinafter, this invention is illustrated by the following examples of some preferred embodiments in comparison with comparative examples not according to the invention.
      <br/>
      However, this invention is not limited to the undermentioned examples.
      <br/>
      Evaluation methods of properties of absorbing agents, absorbent materials, and absorbent products performed in the examples and comparative examples are as follows.
    </p>
    <p num="89">(a) Absorbency under pressure:</p>
    <p num="90">i) tea bag method</p>
    <p num="91">
      0.2 gram of the absorbing agent (precursor of the absorbing agent) was uniformly placed into a bag like a tea-bag (40 mm * 150 mm) made of nonwoven fabric, and was immersed into a solution of 0.9 percent by weight of sodium chloride (physiological saline solution).
      <br/>
      After leaving it for 60 minutes, the bag was taken out.
      <br/>
      Then, the bag was subjected to hydro-extraction for a predetermined period of time, and the weight W1a (g) of the bag was measured.
      <br/>
      Further, the same processes are carried out without using the absorbing agent, and the weight W0a (g) of the bag was measured.
      <br/>
      The absorbency under pressure (g/g) was calculated from the weights W1a and W0a in accordance with the following equation: Absorbency under pressure (g/g)=(Weight W1a (g)-Weight W0a (g))/Weight of Absorbing Agent (g)
    </p>
    <p num="92">ii) centrifugal separation method</p>
    <p num="93">
      0.2 gram of the absorbing agent was uniformly placed into a bag (60 mm * 60 mm) made of nonwoven fabric, and was immersed into a solution of sodium chloride of 0.9 percent by weight (physiological saline solution).

      After leaving it for 60 minutes, the bag was taken out.
