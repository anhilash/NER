    <heading>TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
    <p num="2">The present invention relates generally to methods of determining analyte concentrations, and more particularly, to photolabile chelators.</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="3">
      Although Ca2+ is a well established intracellular messenger, there are still many unanswered questions concerning the kinetics and spatial localization of its effects.
      <br/>
      Because of the importance of calcium as an intracellular messenger, a variety of methods have been developed for measuring intracellular Ca2+ levels.
      <br/>
      The most successful of these use dye-linked chelators which change absorbance or fluorescence upon binding Ca2+ ions.
      <br/>
      Existing indicators for physiological cations such as Ca2+, as well as, Mg2+, H+, and Na+ change their optical properties reversibly in response to changes in cation concentrations.
      <br/>
      See, for example, U.S. Pat. No. 4,603,209, and EP 314,480.
      <br/>
      Chelating compounds have been developed that facilitate changing the intracellular calcium concentration.
      <br/>
      See, for example, U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,689,432, 4,806,604, and 5,141,627; and EP 177,202, in which a photochemical reaction causes the release or uptake of Ca2+ and thereby alters the ambient Ca2+.
    </p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="4">
      In general, the invention features optical indicators which memorize the spatial location and/or concentration of an analyte at a particular chosen point in time.
      <br/>
      This can allow for time-resolved analysis of analyte concentration.
      <br/>
      Analysis of the temporal and spatial resolution of the intracellular concentrations of physiologically significant analytes, such as calcium and other cations, can be facilitated by freezing a snapshot of the analyte concentration in the intracellular matrix.
      <br/>
      The snapshot can allow one to postpone the analysis of the analyte concentration at that particular moment to a later time.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      In one aspect, the invention features a compound including a chromophore carrying a photolabile group capable of undergoing an irreversible and detectable chemical transformation upon irradiation by light, the chromophore being linked to or including a binding or chelating site for an analyte.
      <br/>
      Binding of the analyte to the binding site alters an optical property of the chromophore, thus altering the ability of the photolabile group to undergo the chemical transformation upon irradiation of the compound.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      The analyte can be a cation, such as calcium and the chelator can be a BAPTA or BAPTA-like derivative.
      <br/>
      The chromophore can be any chemical grouping, such as an aromatic, heteroaromatic, or polyene group which absorbs light.
      <br/>
      One type of photolabile group that photolyzes with high efficiency to an isoxazole is a  BETA -azido,  ALPHA , BETA -unsaturated carbonyl group.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      In another aspect, the invention relates to a method of memorizing an intracellular concentration of an analyte.
      <br/>
      The method includes the steps of: (a) loading a cell with an effective amount of a compound as described above under conditions which do not alter the chromophore; (b) irradiating the cell with a wavelength of light which selectively photolyzes the compound to yield a photolyzed product; (c) detecting the presence of the photolyzed product and/or unphotolyzed compound; and (d) relating the presence of the photolyzed product and/or unphotolyzed compound to the intracellular concentration of the analyte.
      <br/>
      The cell is briefly irradiated.
      <br/>
      The compound can be bound to the analyte when photolyzed to form the product.
      <br/>
      Only one form of the compound (i.e., bound or not bound) forms the photolyzed product.
    </p>
    <p num="8">In another aspect, the invention features kits for practicing the above method.</p>

    <heading>DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
    <p num="36">Memory Indicators</p>
    <p num="37">
      The invention features molecules that can be triggered by appropriate wavelengths of light to memorize the instantaneous spatial pattern of an ambient analyte as a stable snapshot that can be read out later, even after the analyte concentration has changed or the biological tissue has been fixed.
      <br/>
      The advantages of such analyte-memorizing molecules are that analyte concentrations can be simultaneously and instantly recorded in much larger numbers of cells or volumes of tissue and at much higher spatial and temporal resolution than presently possible.
      <br/>
      This improvement is because the final readout or imaging can be performed at leisure by optical cytometry or electron microscopy, after specimen fixation if desired, rather than in real time by imaging of the living tissue.
    </p>
    <p num="38">
      The molecules are composed of a binding site which is capable of binding or coordinating an analyte, a chromophore, and a photolabile group.
      <br/>
      The photolabile group undergoes an irreversible and detectable chemical transformation when the chromophore absorbs light.
      <br/>
      The binding site and the chromophore are linked in such a manner that the absorbance spectrum of the chromophore shifts when analyte binds to the binding site.
      <br/>
      Therefore, analyte binding renders the photolabile group more or less likely to undergo the photochemical transformation by a defined wavelength of light.
      <br/>
      For example, if analyte binding shifts the absorbance spectrum to shorter wavelengths, photolysis at a longer, defined wavelength converts molecules which are unbound by analyte to a different species, whereas molecules which were bound by analyte remain unchanged.
      <br/>
      Either or both of the original compound and reaction product from the photolysis can be detected subsequently.
      <br/>
      Since the reaction ceases when irradiation is stopped, the formation of the photolysis reaction product provides an imprint which freezes into place the analyte concentration which existed at the moment of irradiation, in both a spatial and temporal sense, preserving it for subsequent detection.
    </p>
    <p num="39">
      These compounds include a chromophore incorporating a photolabile group capable of undergoing an irreversible and detectable chemical transformation upon irradiation by light, the chromophore being linked to a binding site capable of binding an analyte, wherein binding of the analyte to the site alters an optical property of the chromophore, thus altering the ability of the photolabile group to undergo the chemical transformation upon irradiation at a defined wavelength of light.
      <br/>
      Such compounds can be represented by the generic formula I:
      <br/>
      P-C-B   I

      Photolabile groups are those groups which undergo an irreversible chemical transformation when irradiated with light.
      <br/>
      In this context, an "irreversible chemical transformation" refers to any transformation which results in the making or breaking of one or more covalent bonds.
      <br/>
      Thus, groups which do no more than undergo cis-trans isomerization of a carbon-carbon double bond are not categorized as photolabile groups in the context of this invention.
      <br/>
      Representative, but non-limiting examples of photolabile groups can be found in "Photolytic Deprotection and Activation of Functional Groups", by V. N. Pillai in Organic Photochemistry, A. Padwa (eds.), 9:225-323 (1987) (Marcel Dekker).
      <br/>
      Preferred photolabile groups for use in biological systems are those which undergo photolysis at wavelengths above 300 nm, preferably above 350 nm, since at these wavelengths most proteins, nucleic acids and other cellular constituents will not strongly absorb light and thus are less likely to undergo degradative or competitive reactions.
      <br/>
      The photolabile group can be attached to or partially or wholly embedded into a chromophore.
    </p>
    <p num="42">
      Azides, particularly aromatic azides, which undergo photolysis with relatively high efficiency are favored photosensitive groups (Reiser, A., Wagner, H. M. (1971) "Photochemistry of the azido group", in The Chemistry of the Azido Group (S.
      <br/>
      Patai, ed.), pp. 441-501. New York: Wiley).
      <br/>
      An example of a photolabile group disclosed herein is a  BETA -azido,  ALPHA , BETA -unsaturated carbonyl group.
      <br/>
      Upon irradiation with light of a suitable wavelength, the azido group extrudes nitrogen and the resulting nitrene cyclizes to an isoxazole.
      <br/>
      An azide can insert into a number of other chemical groups such as, but not limited to, nitro (to form a furoxan), azo (to form a triazole), carbon--carbon double bond (to form an indole), carbon-nitrogen double bond (to form a pyrazole or imidazole).
      <br/>
      Such groups can be incorporated into adjacent heterocyclic (e.g., pyridines or isoxazole) or aryl (e.g. phenyl, substituted phenyl rings).
      <br/>
      In addition, azides which are not adjacent to a suitable functionality will produce characteristic and defined products through well-known ring expansions (e.g., to form benzazirines) or addition reactions to intermediate reactive species such as nitrenium ions formed from nitrenes in aqueous reactions.
      <br/>
      Such products are distinctive and can be differentiated from the unphotolyzed precursor.
      <br/>
      Azides incorporated into carbon-carbon double bonds (e.g. vinyl azides) can also be used as they form distinctive azirine products upon photolysis.
    </p>
    <p num="43">
      Other photolabile groups which can be utilized include diazoketones that produce carboxylic acids on photolysis.
      <br/>
      Suitably attached nitrobenzyl groups photolyze to a nitrosobenzaldehyde or nitrosoacetophenone derivatives often with release of a carboxylic acid, alcohol, phosphate, amine, or amide.
    </p>
    <p num="44">
      As a result of the photolytic transformation, the photolytic reaction product will be different from and thereby distinguishable from the precursor unphotolyzed compound.
      <br/>
      Most conveniently, this distinction will be made based on some optical property of the compound, e.g., absorbance or fluorescence.
      <br/>
      However, as described below, the presence of the photolyzed reaction product can also be detected with specific binding reagents such as antibodies.
    </p>
    <p num="45">Typically, the photolabile group undergoes an irreversible reaction when exposed to light of an appropriate wavelength.</p>
    <p num="46">
      The chromophore can be any chemical grouping which absorbs light.
      <br/>
      Generally, chromophores will have at least one double bond, preferably a series of conjugated double bonds.
      <br/>
      Typical chromophores include aromatic and heteroaromatic groups, optionally substituted with electron donating or electron withdrawing groups.
      <br/>
      Many chromophores are known to those of skill in the art and this invention is not intended to be limited to particular groups of chromophores.
    </p>
    <p num="47">
      The chromophore is attached to an analyte binding site in a manner such that binding of analyte by the binding site alters an optical property of the chromophore thus allowing detection of binding of analyte to the compound.
      <br/>
      Generally, this is accomplished by a linkage between chromophore and binding site which allows for electronic coupling of the chromophore to the binding site.
      <br/>
      Typically, this electronic coupling is maintained by  PI -electron conjugation via carbon-carbon double and triple bonds, aromatic rings and lone pair electrons of heteroatoms.
      <br/>
      If linked by carbon-carbon bonds, as long as there is no more than one sigma bond in a row between the chromophore and the binding site, this electronic coupling will be maintained.
      <br/>
      The binding site may be linked to the chromophore via a single point of attachment or multiple points of attachment as is the case with binding sites which are fused onto the chromophore.
      <br/>
      The link between the chromophore and the binding site of the compound may also be a complex aromatic group or aromatic heterocycle, which in turn can be part of the chromophore or part of the binder or both.

    <p num="60">
      Binding of the analyte to the binding site alters an optical property of the chromophore such that the photolabile group is selectively protected from undergoing the photolytic chemical transformation.
      <br/>
      Typically, this is accomplished by a shift in the absorption spectrum of the chromophore when analyte binds to the binding site.
      <br/>
      For example, if analyte binding shifts the absorbance of the chromophore to a shorter wavelength, irradiation at a longer wavelength will not affect the photolabile group on the chromophore on analyte-bound compounds because they will not absorb the longer wavelength light energy.
      <br/>
      However, compounds which are not bound to analyte will absorb light energy at the longer wavelength and thus photolytic chemical transformation of the photolabile group will occur.
      <br/>
      The converse will hold for compounds in which analyte binding shifts the absorbance spectrum of the compound to longer wavelength.
      <br/>
      Irradiation at shorter wavelengths will result in selective photolysis of compound not bound to analyte.
      <br/>
      Because many chelating optical indicators shift their absorbance maxima to a substantial extent upon analyte binding, it generally will be possible to attach any of a wide variety of photolabile groups to an existing optical indicator and find a band of wavelengths at which there is a large difference in absorbance between the free and analyte-bound forms of the indicator.
      <br/>
      Irradiation at a selected wavelength as described above will result in photolysis and transformation of the photolabile group on the unprotected (i.e., analyte-unbound) indicator, thus allowing the detection of analyte-bound compound.
      <br/>
      One skilled in the art will recognize that one can also detect remaining unphotolyzed compound and derive similar information about analyte concentrations.
      <br/>
      In certain systems, some of which are exemplified below, it is desirable to detect both the photolyzed product and the unphotolyzed compound.
    </p>
    <p num="61">
      Alternatively, binding of the analyte can result in an increase (or decrease) in the absorbance intensity of the indicator, thus rendering the indicator more or less likely to photolyze.
      <br/>
      In compounds of this type, the absorption maxima can remain unchanged, but the intensity of the absorption can be altered.
      <br/>
      When a change in an optical property (e.g., absorbance or fluorescence) between photolyzed and unphotolyzed product is being used to derive an instantaneous snapshot of an analyte concentration, the change is ideally large enough to allow for good discrinmination between them.
      <br/>
      The shift in absorbance maxima or fluorescence excitation or emission maxima is typically at least about 25 nm, preferably about 50 nm and more preferably about 100 nm.
      <br/>
      If the shift in wavelength is not sufficiently large and a high degree of spectral overlap exists between the compounds, one can still achieve good discrimination by irradiating/detecting with selected band pass/cut off filters or using a laser to irradiate at a specific wavelength.
    </p>
    <p num="62">
      The binding sites that are present in the compounds of this invention are determined by the analyte that is being detected.
      <br/>
      In many cases the binding site will be a multidentate ligand which is capable of chelating the analyte.
      <br/>
      Crown ethers and cryptands can be used when the analyte being detected is a cation.
      <br/>
      The precise structural requirements which provide selectivity for one cation over another are known to those of skill in the art and will not be elaborated here.
      <br/>
      A particularly useful class of ligands is based on a octacoordinate tetracarboxylate chelating unit, such as, for example, is contained in an ethylene glycol bis(-beta-aminoethyl ether)-N,N,N',N'-tetracetic acid unit (EGTA).
      <br/>
      BAPTA and BAPTA-like derivatives can also be used as chelating units in memory indicators.

    <p num="63">Methods of Memorizing Analyte Concentrations</p>
    <p num="64">
      The compounds described above can be used to "memorize" the intracellular concentration of an analyte.
      <br/>
      Biologically significant analytes include cations such as Ca2+, as well as, Mg2+, H+, and Na+. The methods include the steps of: (a) loading a cell with an effective amount of a memory indicator described earlier under conditions which do not alter the chromophore; (b) irradiating the cell with a wavelength of light which selectively photolyzes indicator which is not bound to the analyte, to form a chemically transformed product; (c) detecting the presence of the transformed product and/or unphotolyzed indicator; and (d) relating the presence of the transformed product and/or unphotolyzed indicator to the intracellular concentration of the analyte.
    </p>
    <p num="65">
      Most of the memory indicators disclosed by this invention are light sensitive, particularly to visible light and will photodegrade under ambient light conditions.
      <br/>
      Therefore, they typically can be loaded into the cell in the dark and then exposed to light of the appropriate wavelength.
      <br/>
      When carboxylic acid groups are present in the memory indicators, the compounds can be used as their  ALPHA -acyloxyalkylester derivatives (e.g., acetoxymethylesters).
      <br/>
      Alternatively, the compounds can be loaded by direct microinjection, scrape loading, patch clamp techniques and the like.
    </p>
    <p num="66">
      It will frequently be necessary to destroy unphotolyzed indicator prior to detecting the presence and location of the photolyzed product.
      <br/>
      This is particularly true when the method of detection involves another irradiation step, albeit at a different wavelength, such as when one uses absorbance or fluorescence.
      <br/>
      Any convenient method can be used to destroy unphotolyzed indicator and the method will usually be determined by the functionality present in the photolabile group.
      <br/>
      For example, when the photolabile group is an azide, a convenient biologically compatible method which will not destroy the cellular integrity of the sample is reduction, e.g. with a thiol or dithiol such as for example, but not limited to, dithiothreitol (DTT), dithioerythritol (DTT), or a mild inorganic reductant (e.g., a hydride reductant such as for example, sodium cyanoborohydride).

    <p num="71">The Mem-1 Indicator</p>
    <p num="72">
      A suitable class of molecules whose photochemistry is controlled by Ca2+ is shown in FIG. 1 as "mem-1".
      <br/>
      When the molecules are Ca2+ -free, they absorb light at &gt;420 nm and undergo a ready photochemical reaction whose probable course is shown in FIG. 1.
      <br/>
      This reaction proceeds by extrusion of N2 from the azide group to give a nitrene, which attacks the adjacent carbonyl group to give an isoxazole ring.
      <br/>
      Mem-1 when Ca2+ -free has an absorbance peak at 425 nm ( EPSILON =20,000 M-1 cm-1), which shifts to 375 nm ( EPSILON =23,000 M-1 cm-1) when Ca2+ binds (FIG. 2).
      <br/>
      For wavelengths &gt;420 nm, the Ca2+ -free form absorbs much more strongly than the Ca2+ complex, so that the former photolyzes about 20-fold faster than the latter.
      <br/>
      Thus, near 420-440 nm, the sensitivity to light or product of the photolysis quantum efficiency and extinction coefficient is 2700 M-1 cm-1 for the free dye compared to 134 M-1 cm-1 for its Ca2+ complex.
      <br/>
      High �Ca2+ �i can protect mem-1 from visible-light photolysis by shifling the absorbance peak into the ultraviolet.
      <br/>
      Because many optical indicators shift their absorbance maxima to a substantial extent upon cation binding, and because azides attached to chromophores generally photolyze with high efficiency, it should be possible in most cases to attach an azide moiety to such an existing cation indicator and find a band of wavelengths at which there is a large difference in absorbance and photolytic sensitivity between the free and cation-bound forms of the indicator.
      <br/>
      In the case of mem-1, the Ca2+ dissociation constant is about 530 nM, so that in resting unstimulated cells where �Ca2+ �i is &lt;100 nM, mem-1 will be largely Ca2+ -free and photolyzable at wavelengths &gt;420 nb, whereas in activated cells or regions of cells where �Ca2+ �i &gt;1  MU M, the mem-1 will be resistant to such wavelengths.
      <br/>
      Restriction to wavelengths &gt;450 nm will give the highest discriminations between the free and Ca2+ -bound forms at the cost of requiring somewhat higher light intensities.
    </p>
    <p num="73">
      If subcellular resolution is desired, attachment to cell macromolecules is necessary to prevent difflusion of the probe after flashing and during fixation.
      <br/>
      Mem-1 has been prepared with R=NCS (isothiocyanate) and other amine-reactive groups such as N-hydroxysuccinimide esters.
      <br/>
      Other functionalities which can be used to label macromolecules can be found in the Handbook of Protein Conjugation (CRC Press, 1991).
      <br/>
      It has been verified that such molecules label amino acids or proteins such as serum albumin within a few minutes, and that the conjugates retain the relevant properties desired (the above spectral and binding data were obtained on the glycine conjugate, (R=NHCSNHCH2 COO-).
      <br/>
      The isothiocyanate also seems to attach to proteins in real cells, because within a few minutes after injection into cells such as fibroblasts, some dye was retained upon cell permeabilization.
    </p>
    <p num="74">
      Mem-1 would be used by ester-loading or injection or perfusion into cells, then waiting briefly for covalent attachment, all the while avoiding illumination &lt;500 nm.
      <br/>
      In other words, it would be handled only in the dark or under yellow or red safelight illumination.
      <br/>
      At the appropriate moment for �Ca2+ �i to be recorded, at a desired interval after physiological or pharmacological stimulation of the tissue, a flashlamp with appropriate wavelength filters or a laser would be fired to illuminate the tissue at wavelengths of 450-500 nm.
      <br/>
      Spatially uniform illumination will trigger a photochemical change in predominantly those molecules sitting in regions of low �Ca2+ �i, whereas where �Ca2+ �i is high, the molecules will be mostly unaffected because they had bound Ca2+ and could not absorb the triggering photons.
      <br/>
      Finally, the tissue will be frozen and/or fixed by conventional means and prepared for cytometry, fluorescence microscopy, or immunohistochemistry to map the extent of photolysis.
    </p>
    <p num="75">
      Direct fluorescence cytometry or microscopy would rely on the fluorescence of the isoxazole photolysis product of mem-1, whose excitation maximum is 354-385 nm depending on Ca2+, and emission maximum is 490 nm.
      <br/>
      In order to monitor this fluorescence without photolyzing previously unphotolyzed mem-1, the azide groups are removed by reduction to amino groups, for example using a dithiol such as dithiothreitol or 1,3-propanedithiol (Bayley, H., Standring, D. N., Knowles, J. R. (1978) Tetrahedron Lett. 36, 33-3634).
      <br/>
      This step does not affect the isoxazole, and is analogous to the need to put photographic film in fixer to remove unreacted silver halide before turning on the room lights.
      <br/>
      The chemical reduction of the azide takes a few minutes at room temperature and produces an amine that is fairly photostable and also fluorescent.
      <br/>
      Its excitation and emission are at longer wavelengths than those of the isoxazole photoproduct, so fluorescence ratio imaging can distinguish isoxazole photoproduct from unphotolyzed mem-1 reduced to amine.
    </p>
    <p num="76">
      FIG. 3 summarizes the chemistry of photolysis vs. reduction: mem-1 in low Ca2+ takes the left-hand path to the isoxazole, whereas in high Ca2+ it takes the right-hand path to the amine.
      <br/>
      FIG. 4 compares the normalized excitation spectra of the isoxazole photoproduct (solid line, peaking at 376 nm) and the amine reduction product (dashed line, peaking at 408 nm), each separately coupled to bovine serum albumin (R=NHCSNH . . . protein), fixed with dimethyl suberimidate, and measured in Ca2+ -free conditions (excess EGTA).
      <br/>
      FIG. 5 shows the corresponding emission spectra, peaking at 498 nm (isoxazole) and 520 nm (amine) respectively.
      <br/>
      The excitation and emission wavelengths that maximize the distinguishability of the isoxazole from the amine are not the above peaks but are displaced to either side, namely 380 nm excitation, 460 nm emission vs. 440 nm excitation, 550 nm emission.
      <br/>
      The ratio of fluorescences at these two wavelength sets changes from 0.21 for pure isoxazole to 1.74 for the pure amine.
      <br/>
      Intermediate �Ca2+ �i concentrations giving rise to mixtures of isoxazole and amine would give intermediate fluorescence ratios that could be calibrated back to the �Ca2+ �i values.
    </p>
    <p num="77">
      An alternative method for detecting the extent of photolysis would be to expose the tissue sections to specific antibodies (polyclonals or monoclonals) previously raised against protein conjugates of the photolyzed or unphotolyzed indicator.
      <br/>
      Both are the right size to be haptens, are separately available as pure chemical species, and are already conveniently flurnished with reactive groups for conjugate to carrier proteins or to affinity columns for antibody purification by adsorption of cross-reacting species.
      <br/>
      Antibodies are known to make structural discriminations much subtler than the differences between the isoxazole photoproduct and the starting azide or the amine reduction product (Pressman, D., Grossberg, A. L. (1968) The Structural Basis of Antibody Specificity. (New York: Benjamin); Karush, F. (1962) Adv. Immunol. 2:1-40), so raising discriminating antibodies should be possible.
      <br/>
      If necessary, monoclonal antibodies would be generated.
      <br/>
      The antibodies can be labelled with any of a variety of conventional labels and thereby visualized.
      <br/>
      For example, the antibodies would then be labelled and visualized by conventional fluorescein or rhodamine, that are excited or that emit at wavelengths different from the mem-1 products.
      <br/>
      Alternatively fluorescently-labeled antibodies against the first antibodies would be applied as in conventional indirect "sandwich" immunofluorescence.
      <br/>
      If visualization by electron microscopy is needed, this would simply require substitution of electron-dense labels such as ferritin, colloidal gold, iron-dextran complexes, or peroxidase-antiperoxidase complexes (Stemberger, L. A. (1986) Immunocytochemisty, 3rd ed.
      <br/>
      New York: Wiley).
      <br/>
      Ideally one would stain simultaneously and independently for both the photolyzed and unphotolyzed indicator species, for example with a fluorescein-labeled antibody to the photolyzed and rhodamine-labeled antibody to the unphotolyzed.
      <br/>
      The ratio of red to green immunofluorescence would then reflect the �Ca2+ �i during the flash.
      <br/>
      If one stained for only one species, say the photolyzed, an absence of stain could mean either that �Ca2+ �i had been very high or that insufficient indicator had penetrated into that region of cytoplasm.
      <br/>
      Ratio recording removes that ambiguity.
      <br/>
      Ratio recording in electron microscopy is possible with a pair of distinguishable labels such as ferritin and iron dextran (Dutton, A. H.,Tokuyasu, K. T., Singer, S. J. (1979) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 76:3392-3396) or large and small gold particles (DeMey, J. (1983) "Colloidal gold particles in immunocytochemistry", in Immunocytochemistry: Practical Applications in Pathology and Biology (J. M. Polak and S. Van Noorden, eds).
      <br/>
      Bristol: Wright PSG), or one could apply alternate antibodies to alternate serial sections.
    </p>
    <p num="78">
      Regardless of the approach used to measure photolysis, this method will sacrifice continuous recording in favor of spatial resolution during a single photochemical exposure.
      <br/>
      All other methods at present make the opposite choice.
      <br/>
      Spatial resolution would be particularly valuable in neurobiological applications, since adjacent neurons are generally expected to be doing different things while processing information.
      <br/>
      It would also be highly valuable in pharmaceutical screening of large numbers of compounds in parallel, for example arising from combinatorial libraries, because the peak response of cells to each compound could be resolved.
      <br/>
      The limit on time resolution will be set by the rapidity with which the indicator binds and releases Ca2+, which for this class of indicator is typically in the millisecond time domain (Kao, J. P. Y., Tsien, R. Y. (1988) Biophys.
      <br/>
      J 53: 635-639).
      <br/>
      Photodynamic damage should not be important because it can hardly build up significantly in a millisecond of flash illumination.
      <br/>
      This method is much more tolerant of mechanical thickness, light scattering and tissue pulsation than any method trying to measure images of live tissue.
      <br/>
      As long as the photolysis flash can penetrate the tissue, randomization of the photon paths is irrelevant.
      <br/>
      Mechanical thickness and light scattering are also unimportant during readout because the tissue will have been sectioned and cleared.

      The concentration of intracellular dye should not need to exceed a few micromolar, because immunocytochemistry is known to be able to trace proteins whose concentration in cytoplasm is not greater.
      <br/>
      Such low concentrations have usually been easily attained or exceeded by intracellular hydrolysis of membrane- permeant esters.
      <br/>
      Micromolar concentrations of cytoplasmic Ca2+ chelators have generally been without effect on physiological responses because higher concentrations of Ca2+ -binding proteins are already present in vivo.
      <br/>
      To average �Ca2+ �i over a longer period, the illumination could be weakened and prolonged.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, if the stimulus is repetitive, the flashes could be likewise repeated at a given phase delay in order to signal-average the response.
    </p>
    <p num="80">
      If not all the dye molecules are securely anchored when the flash arrives, the mobile molecules should not interfere so long as they do not bind after the flash.
      <br/>
      This is because they should get washed out of the tissue section during the histology.
      <br/>
      Also, if subcellular spatial resolution is not required, covalent reaction with cellular macromolecules should not be necessary, because the indicator molecules should remain trapped in their respective cells.
      <br/>
      Therefore R could be simply H or COO-. One would merely have to avoid membrane permeabilization during the subsequent processing.
    </p>
    <p num="81">
      Calibration of �Ca2+ �i would be easiest with detection of the ratio between the photolyzed and unphotolyzed species, since the absolute amount of indicator would not matter.
      <br/>
      Comparisons would be made with the appearance of protein gels or cells photolyzed while containing known �Ca2+ �i concentrations.
      <br/>
      The method should then tolerate a certain amount of crosstalk, for example incomplete spectra separation between the Ca2+ -free and Ca2+ -bound species, or insufficient light intensity or quantum yield to completely photolyze all the molecules that ought to photolyze, or imperfect antibody specificity.
      <br/>
      While these types of deficiencies would reduce the maximum possible image contrast between very high and very low �Ca2+ �i, they would not invalidate the �Ca2+ �i reading so long as they also apply to the calibration protein gels or cells.

      FIG. 6 shows how the memory indicator concept might be extended to other cations.
      <br/>
      The structure proposed as a memory indicator for H+ is a hybrid of the present azidoketone with the known fluorescent pH indicator "quene-1" (Rogers, J., Hesketh, T. R., Smith, G. A., Metcalfe, J. C. (1983) J Biol.
      <br/>
      Chem. 258:5994-5997).
      <br/>
      Likewise the Na+ - and Mg2+ -memorizing molecules combine the azidoketone with known binding sites for those cations respectively (Minta, A., Tsien, R. Y. (1989) J Biol.
      <br/>
      Chem. 264:19449-19457; Raju, B., Murphy, E., Levy, L. A., Hall, R. D., London, R. E. (1989) Am. J Physiol. 256:C540-C548.
      <br/>
      Ligands which selectively bind to biologically significant analytes are known to those of skill in the art and it is contemplated that indicators made from all such ligands linked to chromophores with a photolabile group as described herein can be used in this invention.
    </p>
    <p num="83">
      The indicator would be loaded into the tissue by standard methods such as membrane-permeant, hydrolyzable esters, microinjection, or dialysis through a patch pipet.
      <br/>
      If subcellular resolution is desired, the indicator molecules should carry chemically reactive groups to covalently attach them to random cellular macromolecules.
      <br/>
      At the moment at which �Ca2+ �i is to be memorized, the specimen is illuminated with a brief flash of light of appropriate wavelengths.
      <br/>
      The local degree of progress of the photochemical reaction constitutes a latent but irreversible image of the �Ca2+ �i levels existing during the flash.
      <br/>
      Subsequent changes in �Ca2+ �i have no influence because the light necessary for the photochemistry is no longer being delivered.
      <br/>
      After stabilization of the tissue, for example by freezing or fixation and sectioning, and chemical removal of any remaining light-sensitive moieties, the latent image is visualized either by the difference in fluorescence of the molecules that have vs. have not undergone the photochemistry, or by standard techniques of immunocytochemistry with tagged antibodies specific for the same two sets of molecules.
