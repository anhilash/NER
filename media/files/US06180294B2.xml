      However, for the further spread of the liquid crystal displays, it is necessary to lower their costs, and particularly with regard to the color filter which largely occupies the cost of each display, request for its cost reduction increases.
      <br/>
      In order to meet the required characteristics of the color filter and to satisfy the above-mentioned demand, various attempts have been heretofore made, but any method which can meet all of the required characteristics has not been established so far.
      <br/>
      Some methods for manufacturing the color filter will be described below.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      A first method which has most often been used is a dyeing method.
      <br/>
      This dyeing method comprises coating a glass substrate with an aqueous polymer material which is a material to be dyed, patterning the material into a desired shape by a photolithography process, and then immersing the thus obtained pattern in a dyeing bath to obtain a colored pattern.
      <br/>
      This operation is repeated three times to form the colored layers of Red (R), Green (G) and Blue (B).
    </p>
    <p num="7">Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 5-288913 has described another example of this dyeing method which comprises forming a photosensitive layer, exposing it to light through a pattern, dyeing unexposed portions, and then repeating this process to manufacture a color filter having three colors of R, G and B.</p>
    <p num="8">
      A second method is a pigment dispersion method, which is now being replaced with the above-mentioned dyeing method.
      <br/>
      This pigment dispersion method comprises first forming, on a substrate, a photosensitive resin layer in which a pigment is dispersed, and then patterning the resin layer to obtain a single-colored pattern.
      <br/>
      Next, this process is repeated three times to form colored layers having three colors of R, G and B.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      A third method is an electrodeposition method.
      <br/>
      This method comprises first patterning transparent electrodes on a substrate, and then immersing it in an electrodeposition coating solution containing a pigment, a resin, an electrolyte and the like to electrodeposit a first color.
      <br/>
      This process is repeated three times to form colored layers of R, G and B, and in the last step, these layers are calcined.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      A fourth method is a printing method.
      <br/>
      This method comprises dispersing a pigment in a thermosetting resin, repeating a printing operation three times to coat with the colors of R, G and B, and then thermosetting the colored resin layers to form colored layers.
      <br/>
      In each of these methods, a protective layer is usually formed on the colored layers.
    </p>
    <p num="11">
      A point which is common to these methods is that a similar process is required to be repeated three times to give the three colors of R, G and B, which increases the cost.
      <br/>
      In addition, these methods having many steps lead to deterioration of a yield.
      <br/>
      Moreover, in the electrodeposition method, the formable patterns are limited, and so it is difficult to apply this method to TFT by an existent technique.
      <br/>
      The printing method has a drawback that resolution properties and smoothing properties are poor, and so it is not suitable for the formation of a pattern having a fine pitch.
    </p>
    <p num="12">
      In order to overcome these drawbacks, techniques for manufacturing a color filter by the use of an ink jet system have been developed, and these techniques have been described in Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open Nos. 59-75205, 63-235901 and 1-217320.
      <br/>
      However, a sufficiently satisfactory method has not been obtained yet.

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
    <p num="36">The present invention will be described in more detail with reference to drawings.</p>
    <p num="37">FIGS. 1A to 1E show a flow sheet of a manufacturing process of a color filter in the present invention, and in this drawing, one example of the constitution of the color filter of the present invention is shown.</p>
    <p num="38">
      In the present invention, as a substrate, a light-transmittable substrate is preferable, and a glass substrate is usually used.
      <br/>
      However, the glass substrate is not restrictive, and any material can be used as the substrate, so long as it has necessary characteristics such as transparency and mechanical strength which the color filter for liquid crystals should have.
    </p>
    <p num="39">
      FIG. 1A shows a glass substrate 1 having light-transmittable portions 7 and black matrices 2 which are shade portions.
      <br/>
      In the first place, the substrate 1 provided with the black matrices 2 is coated with a resin composition which can cure by light irradiation or the light irradiation and heating to reduce an ink-acceptable property of the layer, and if necessary, prebaking is then carried out to form a resin layer 3 (FIG. 1B).
      <br/>
      In forming the resin layer 3, spin coating, roll coating, bar coating, spray coating or dip coating can be used, and this coating means is not particularly restrictive.
    </p>
    <p num="40">
      Next, portions of the resin layer which are shaded by the black matrices 2 are first pattern-exposed through a photomask 4 to cure these portions of the resin layers, thereby forming sites 8 (non-colored portions) which do not absorb an ink (FIG. 1C).
      <br/>
      Thereafter, the same layer is colored in colors of R, G and B by the use of an ink jet head 5 (FIG. 1D), and if necessary, the ink is then dried.
    </p>
    <p num="41">
      The photomask 4 which can be used at the time of the pattern exposure has holes which permit the portions of the resin layer shaded by the black matrices to cure.
      <br/>
      In order to prevent the color skip of the colorant in the portions of the resin layer which are in contact with the black matrices, a relatively large amount of the ink is required to be ejected from ink jet head.
      <br/>
      For this purpose, it is preferable to use the mask having the holes whose diameter is smaller than the shade width of each black matrix.
    </p>
    <p num="42">As the ink for the coloring, a dyestuff-type and a pigment-type ink are both usable, and both liquid inks and solid inks are also usable.</p>
    <p num="43">
      As the curable resin composition which can be used in the present invention, any one is acceptable, so long as it has an ink-receptable property and can cure by at least one treatment of light irradiation or the combination of the light irradiation and heating.
      <br/>
      Examples of the resin include acrylic resins, epoxy resins, silicon resins, cellulose derivatives such as hydroxypropyl cellulose, hydroxyethyl cellulose, methyl cellulose and carboxymethyl cellulose, and modified resins thereof.
    </p>
    <p num="44">
      For the purpose of causing the resin to bring about a crosslinking reaction by light or light and heat, a photoinitiator (a crosslinking agent) can be used.
      <br/>
      Examples of the usable photoinitiator include dichromates, bisazido compounds, radical initiators, cationic initiators and anionic initiators.
      <br/>
      These photoinitiators can be used in combination, or they can be used with another sensitizer, when used.
      <br/>
      Moreover, in order to accelerate the crosslinking reaction, a heat treatment may be carried out after the light irradiation.
    </p>
    <p num="45">The resin layer containing these components is very excellent in fastnesses to heat, water and the like, and it can sufficiently withstand a high temperature and washing in subsequent steps.</p>
    <p num="46">
      As an ink jet system which can be used in the present invention, there can be used a bubble jet type using an electricity-heat converter as an energy-generating element and a piezo jet type using a piezo-electric element.
      <br/>
      A colored area and a colored pattern can be optionally set.
    </p>
    <p num="47">
      In the present embodiment, the black matrices are formed on the substrate, but they can be formed on the resin layer after the formation of the curable resin composition layer or the coloring without any particular problem.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the constitution of the black matrices in this embodiment is not restrictive.
      <br/>
      The black matrices can be preferably prepared by forming a metallic thin film on the substrate by sputtering or vapor deposition, and then patterning the film by photolithography, or alternatively patterning a photosensitive black resin.
      <br/>
      These procedures are not restrictive.
    </p>
    <p num="48">
      Next, the light irradiation and/or the heat treatment is carried out to cure the curable resin composition (FIG. 1E), and if necessary, a protective layer 6 is formed (FIG. 1F).
      <br/>
      The protective layer 6 is made of a second resin composition of a photosetting type, a thermosetting type or a photo-thermosetting type, or an inorganic material with the aid of vapor deposition or sputtering.
      <br/>
      Thus, as the protective layer 6, any material can be used, so long as it does not impede the transparency of the obtained color filter, and can sufficiently withstand subsequent steps such as an ITO formation step and an orientation film formation step.
    </p>
    <p num="49">FIGS. 2A to 2E show a manufacturing process of the color filter for use in a liquid crystal panel in which the black matrices are provided on the opposite substrate.</p>
    <p num="50">The method in which the black matrices are provided on the opposite substrate instead of the side of the color filter is effective as a technique of improving an aperture ratio.</p>
    <p num="51">A glass substrate 1 shown in FIG. 2A is coated with a composition in which the ink absorbency of light irradiation portions deteriorates by the light irradiation or the combination of the light irradiation and the heat treatment, and if necessary, prebaking is then done to form a composition layer 3 in which the ink absorbency of the light irradiation portions deteriorates by the light irradiation or the combination of the light irradiation and the heat treatment (FIG. 2B).</p>
    <p num="52">
      Next, pattern exposure is carried out through a photomask 4 to reduce the ink absorbency of the exposed portions of the composition layer 3 (FIG. 2C), and then non-exposed portions of the same layer are colored in the colors of R, G and B by the use of an ink jet head 5 (FIG. 2D), followed by drying, if necessary.
      <br/>
      In order to prevent color skip, it is important that the width of non-colored portions 8 is smaller than that of the black matrices (not shown) provided on the faced substrate.
    </p>
    <p num="53">
      Afterward, the colored resin composition layer is cured by the light irradiation and/or the heat treatment (FIG. 2E), and if necessary, a protective layer 6 is formed (FIG. 2F) to obtain a color filter.
      <br/>
      As the protective layer, there can be used a resin composition of a photosetting type, a thermosetting type or a photo-thermosetting type, or an inorganic material formed by vapor deposition or sputtering.
      <br/>
      Thus, as the protective layer 6, any material can be used, so long as it does not impede the transparency of the obtained color filter, and can sufficiently withstand subsequent steps such as an ITO formation step and an oriented film formation step.
    </p>
    <p num="54">In consequence, the color filter is manufactured which has the resin layer, the plurality of colored portions having the different colors, and the non-colored portions on the substrate.</p>
    <p num="55">
      FIGS. 3 and 4 show sectional views of TFT color liquid crystal panels incorporated with the color filter of the present invention.
      <br/>
      These embodiments are not restrictive.
    </p>
    <p num="56">
      The color liquid crystal panel can usually be formed by combining a color filter substrate 1 with a glass substrate 14, and then enclosing a liquid crystal compound 12 therebetween.
      <br/>
      On the inside of the one substrate 14 of the liquid crystal panel, TFT (not shown) and transparent pixel electrodes 13 are formed in the state of matrices.
      <br/>
      On the inside of the glass substrate 1, a color filter 9 is arranged so that the color materials of R, G and B are placed at a position opposite to the pixel electrodes, and all over the color filter 9, a transparent common electrode 10 is formed.
      <br/>
      Black matrices are formed on the side of the color filter substrate (FIG. 3), but in the case of a BM on-array type liquid crystal panel, they are formed on the faced TFT substrate side (FIG. 4).
      <br/>
      Moreover, on the surfaces of both the substrates, orientation films 11 are formed and then subjected to a rubbing treatment to arrange liquid crystal molecules in a certain direction.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, polarizing plates 15 adhere to the outsides of the respective glass substrates 1 and 14, and the liquid crystal compound 12 is filled into the space (about 2 to 5  MU m) between these glass substrates.
      <br/>
      As a back light 16, a combination of fluorescent lamps (not shown) and a scattering plate (not shown) is usually used, and display is carried out by utilizing the liquid crystal compound as a light shutter for changing the transmittance of the back light.
      <br/>
      Reference numeral 2 is a black matrix, 3 is an ink receiving layer, 6 is a protective layer, 7 is a colored portion, and 8 is a non-colored portion.
    </p>
    <p num="57">
      According to another method for manufacturing the color filter of the present invention, a substrate on which black matrices are formed is coated with a resin composition layer which has ink-acceptable property and in which the residue of a hydrophilic group in light irradiation portions decreases by light irradiation or the combination of the light irradiation and heating, thereby forming the resin composition layer which has the ink-acceptable properties and in which the residue of the hydrophilic group in the light irradiation portions decreases by the light irradiation or the combination of the light irradiation and the heating.
      <br/>
      This method intends to prevent the mixing of the inks and the excessive diffusion of the ink by the utilization of a difference of ink absorbency between exposed portions and unexposed portions.
      <br/>
      In this method, it is preferable to use the resin composition in which the ink absorbency of the light irradiation portions deteriorate by the light irradiation or the combination of the light irradiation and the heating, and in other words, it is preferable to use the resin composition which can give rise to crosslinking via a hydrophilic group such as an hydroxyl group, an alkoxy group or an amino group, or which brings about an additional reaction with the hydrophilic group.
      <br/>
      In the present embodiment, the absorbency deteriorate only by the light irradiation, but the heat treatment may be used together with the light irradiation to accelerate a crosslinking reaction without any problem.
    </p>
    <p num="58">
      As a typical example of the resin composition which can be used in the present invention, a system utilizing the crosslinking reaction by chemical amplification is preferable.
      <br/>
      Examples of the basic resin include cellulose derivatives such as hydroxypropyl cellulose and hydroxyethyl cellulose, a high-molecular alcohol such as polyvinyl alcohol and its derivatives, a novolak resin such as cresol-novolak and its derivatives, and an acrylic resin containing an acrylic monomer having a hydroxyl group such as hydroxyethyl methacrylate.
      <br/>
      An example of the crosslinking agent includes a melamine derivative such as methylol melamine, and examples of the photoinitiator include an onium salt such as triphenylsulfonium hexafluoroantimonate and a halogenated organic compound such as trichloromethyltriazine.
      <br/>
      These examples are not restrictive.

      In the exposed portions, the residue of a hydrophilic group such as an hydroxyl group, an alkoxy group or an amino group decreases with the progress of the reaction, so that the exposed portions scarcely absorb the ink, whereby the mixture of the inks having the colors can be prevented.

      In this case, in view of the fact that a large amount of the ink is required to be ejected for the prevention of color skip in the portions which are in contact with the black matrices, it is preferable to use the mask provided with the openings having a diameter smaller than the width of the portions shaded by the black matrices.

      Thereafter, openings which are the irradiated portions are colored with colors of R, G and B by the use of an ink jet head 5 (FIG. 5D), and if necessary, the inks are then dried.

    <p num="82">
      In order to prevent the color skip of the color filter, the portions of the composition layer having a larger area than the openings of the black matrices are preferably colored, and for this coloring, it is necessary that the portions of the composition layer having a larger area than the black matrices as the mask take part in reaction.
      <br/>
      For the purpose of causing the reaction, some means are effective, and for example, diffused light can be used as irradiation light at the time of exposure, a large excess of energy can be irradiated, or a heat treatment is carried out for a long period of time after the exposure to diffuse the reaction.
      <br/>
      In this embodiment, there has been described the example where the pattern exposure is carried out by the use of the black matrices as the mask, but the pattern exposure may be done from the upside of the resin composition layer by the use of another photomask.
