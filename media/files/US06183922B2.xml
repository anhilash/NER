    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="1">
      1.
      <br/>
      Field of the Invention
    </p>
    <p num="2">This invention relates to an electrophotographic photosensitive member, a process cartridge and an electrophotographic apparatus, and more particularly to an electrophotographic photosensitive member, a process cartridge and an electrophotographic apparatus which are suited for short-wavelength semiconductor lasers capable of making images have higher resolution.</p>
    <p num="3">2. Related Background Art</p>
    <p num="4">
      In electrophotographic apparatus making use of lasers as light sources as typified by laser printers, semiconductor lasers having oscillation wavelength around 800 nm or around 680 nm are prevailingly used.
      <br/>
      In recent years, various approaches to higher resolution are made with an increase in demand for reproducing images having a higher image quality.
      <br/>
      Wavelengths of lasers also deeply concern the higher resolution.
      <br/>
      As disclosed in Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 9-240051, the shorter oscillation wavelength a laser has, the smaller spot diameter the laser can have.
      <br/>
      This enables formation of latent images having a high resolution.
    </p>
    <p num="5">Some methods are available for making laser oscillation wavelength shorter.</p>
    <p num="6">
      One of the methods is a method in which a non-linear optical material is utilized so that the wavelength of laser light is shortened to half by using secondary higher harmonic generation (SHG) (e.g., Japanese Patent Applications Laid-Open No. 9-275242, No. 9-189930 and No. 5-313033).
      <br/>
      This system can achieve a long life and a large output, since it can use GaAs semiconductor lasers or YAG lasers as primary light sources, which have already established their technique and can achieve a high output.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      Another is a method in which a wide-gap semiconductor is used, and can make apparatus smaller in size than devices utilizing the SHG.
      <br/>
      ZnSe semiconductor lasers (e.g., Japanese Patent Applications Laid-Open No. 7-321409 and No. 6-334272) and GaN semiconductor lasers (e.g., Japanese Patent Applications Laid-Open No. 8-088441 and No. 7-335975) have long been studied in great deal because of their high emission efficiency.
    </p>
    <p num="8">It, however, has been difficult for these semiconductor lasers to be optimized in their device structure, crystal growth conditions and electrodes, and, because of defects in crystals, has been difficult to make long-time oscillation at room temperature, which is essential for putting them into practical use.</p>
    <p num="9">However, with progress of technological innovations on substrates and so forth, Nichia Kagaku Kogyo K.K. reported, in October, 1997, GaN semiconductor laser's continuous oscillation for 1,150 hours (condition: 50 (degree)  C.), and materialization for its practical use stands close at hand.</p>
    <p num="10">
      Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 9-240051 discloses as a photosensitive member suited for 400 to 500 nm lasers a multi-layer photosensitive member in which a single layer or charge generation layer making use of  ALPHA -type titanyl phthalocyanine is formed as the outermost layer.
      <br/>
      Studies made by the present inventors, however, have revealed that the use of such a material brings about such a problem that, because of a poor sensitivity and a very great memory especially for light of about 400 nm, photosensitive members may undergo great potential variations when used repeatedly.
    </p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="11">An object of the present invention is to provide an electrophotographic photosensitive member having high sensitivity characteristics even in a wavelength region of 380 to 500 nm and also having small photomemory and undergoing small potential variations when used repeatedly, and a process cartridge having such a photosensitive member, and also provides an electrophotographic apparatus that is practical and can stably reproduce images with a high image quality by using such a photosensitive member and a short wavelength laser.</p>

      In view of the stability of sensitivity, 3-16 and 3-17 are more preferred.
    </p>
    <p num="72">The electrophotographic photosensitive member of the present invention will be described below in detail.</p>
    <p num="73">
      The photosensitive member may have any known layer configuration as shown in FIGS. 1 to 3.
      <br/>
      Preferred is the configuration as shown in FIG. 1.
      <br/>
      In FIGS. 1 to 3, letter symbol a denotes a support; b, a photosensitive layer; c, a charge generation layer; d, a charge transport layer; and e, a charge-generating material �the azo pigment represented by Formula (1)�. Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 9-240051 reports that, in the photosensitive member comprising the support and superposed thereon the charge generation layer and the charge transport layer in this order as shown in FIG. 1, the 400 to 500 nm light is absorbed in the charge transport layer before it reaches the charge generation layer, and hence no sensitivity is exhibited in theory.
      <br/>
      However, it does not necessarily apply.
      <br/>
      Even the photosensitive member having such layer configuration can have a sufficient sensitivity and can be used, so long as a charge-transporting material having properties of transmitting the light with laser's oscillation wavelength is used as the charge-transporting material used in the charge transport layer.
    </p>
    <p num="74">A function-separated photosensitive member comprising the support and superposed thereon the charge generation layer and the charge transport layer is produced in the manner described below.</p>
    <p num="75">
      The charge generation layer is formed by applying a fluid onto the support by a known method, followed by drying; the fluid being prepared by dispersing as the charge-generating material the azo pigment represented by Formula (1) in a suitable solvent together with a binder resin.
      <br/>
      The layer may preferably be formed in a thickness not larger than 5  MU m, and particularly preferably from 0.1 to 1  MU m.
    </p>
    <p num="76">
      The binder resin used may be selected from a vast range of insulating resins or organic photoconductive polymers.
      <br/>
      It may preferably include polyvinyl butyral, polyvinyl benzal, polyarylates, polycarbonates, polyesters, phenoxy resins, cellulose resins, acrylic resins and polyurethanes.
      <br/>
      Any of these resins may have a substituent, which substituent may preferably be a halogen atom, an alkyl group, an alkoxyl group, a nitro group, a cyano group or a trifluoromethyl group.
      <br/>
      The binder resin may be used in an amount of not more than 80% by weight, and particularly preferably not more than 40% by weight, based on the total weight of the charge generation layer.
    </p>
    <p num="77">
      The solvent used may preferably be selected from those which dissolve the binder resin and do not dissolve the charge transport layer and subbing layer described later.
      <br/>
      It may specifically include ethers such as tetrahydrofuran and 1,4-dioxane, ketones such as cyclohexanone and methyl ethyl ketone, amides such as N,N-dimethylformamide, esters such as methyl acetate and ethyl acetate, aromatics such as toluene, xylene and chlorobenzene, alcohols such as methanol, ethanol and 2-propanol, and aliphatic halogenated hydrocarbons such as chloroform, methylene chloride, dichloroethylene, carbon tetrachloride and trichloroethylene.
    </p>
    <p num="78">
      The charge transport layer is laid on or beneath the charge generation layer, and has the function to accept charge carriers from the charge generation layer in the presence of an electric field and transport them.
      <br/>
      The charge transport layer is formed by applying a solution prepared by dissolving a charge-transporting material in a solvent optionally together with a suitable binder resin.
      <br/>
      It may preferably have a layer thickness of from 5 to 40  MU m, and particularly preferably from 15 to 30  MU m.
    </p>
    <p num="79">
      The charge-transporting material can roughly be grouped into an electron transporting material and a hole transporting material.
      <br/>
      The electron transporting material may include, e.g., electron attractive materials such as 2,4,7-trinitrofluolenone, 2,4,5,7-tetranitrofluolenone, chloranil and tetracyanoquinodimethane, and those obtained by forming these electron attractive materials into polymers.
      <br/>
      The hole transporting material may include, e.g., polycyclic aromatic compounds such as pyrene and anthracene, heterocyclic compounds such as compounds of carbazole type, indole type, oxazole type, thiazole type, oxadiazole type, pyrazole type, pyrazoline type, thiazole type or triazole type, hydrazone compounds, styryl compounds, benzidine compounds, triarylmethane compounds, triphenylamine compounds, or polymers having a group comprising any of these compounds as the backbone chain or side chain as exemplified by poly-N-vinylcarbazole and polyvinylanthracene.
    </p>
    <p num="80">
      These charge-transporting materials may be used alone or in combination of two or more.
      <br/>
      A suitable binder may be used when the charge-transporting material has no film forming properties.
      <br/>
      It may specifically include insulating resins such as acrylic resins, polyarylates, polycaronates, polyesters, polystyrene, acrylonitrile-styrene copolymer, polyacrylamides, polyamides and chlorinated rubbers, and organic photoconductive polymers such as poly-N-vinylcarbazole and polyvinylanthracene.
    </p>
    <p num="81">When used in the photosensitive member constituted as shown in FIG. 1, charge-transporting materials and binder resins which have transmission properties to the light with oscillation wavelength of semiconductor lasers used must be selected.</p>
    <p num="82">
      The support may be those having a conductivity and may include those made of, e.g., aluminum, an aluminum alloy, copper, zinc, stainless steel, vanadium, molybdenum, chromium, titanium, nickel, indium, gold and platinum.
      <br/>
      Besides, it is possible to use supports comprised of plastics (e.g., polyethylene, polypropylene, polyvinyl chloride, polyethylene terephthalate and acrylic resins) having a film formed by vacuum deposition of any of these metals or alloys, supports comprising any of the above plastics, metals or alloys coated with conductive particles (e.g., carbon black or silver particles) mixed with a suitable binder resin, and supports comprising plastics or paper impregnated with the conductive particles.
      <br/>
      The support may be in the form of a drum, a sheet or a belt.
    </p>
    <p num="83">In the present invention, a subbing layer having a barrier function and an adhesion function may be provided between the support and the photosensitive layer.</p>
    <p num="84">A protective layer may also be provided for the purpose of protecting the photosensitive layer from any adverse mechanical and chemical effects.</p>
    <p num="85">Additives such as an antioxidant and an ultraviolet light absorber may also optionally be used in the photosensitive layer.</p>
    <p num="86">
      In the present invention, any exposure means may be used so long as it has as an exposure light source the semiconductor laser having an oscillation wavelength of 380 nm to 500 nm, and there are no particular limitations on other constitution.
      <br/>
      Also, there are no particular limitations on the semiconductor laser so long as its oscillation wavelength is within the above range.
      <br/>
      In the present invention, in view of electrophotographic performance, it is preferable for the semiconductor laser to have an oscillation wavelength of 400 nm to 450 nm.
    </p>
    <p num="87">There are also no particular limitations on the charging means, developing means, transfer means and cleaning means described later.</p>
    <p num="88">FIG. 4 schematically illustrates the construction of an electrophotographic apparatus having a process cartridge having the electrophotographic photosensitive member of the present invention.</p>
    <p num="89">
      In FIG. 4, reference numeral 1 denotes an electrophotographic photosensitive member of the present invention, which is rotatingly driven around an axis 2 in the direction of an arrow at a given peripheral speed.
      <br/>
      The photosensitive member 1 is uniformly electrostatically charged on its periphery to a positive or negative, given potential through a primary charging means 3.
      <br/>
      The photosensitive member thus charged is then exposed to light 4 emitted from an exposure means (not shown) making use of a semiconductor laser having an oscillation wavelength of 380 nm to 500 nm.
      <br/>
      In this way, electrostatic latent images are successively formed on the periphery of the photosensitive member 1.
    </p>
    <p num="90">
      The electrostatic latent images thus formed are subsequently developed by toner by the operation of a developing means 5.
      <br/>
      The resulting toner-developed images are then successively transferred by the operation of a transfer means 6, to the surface of a transfer medium 7 fed from a paper feed section (not shown) to the part between the photosensitive member 1 and the transfer means 6 in the manner synchronized with the rotation of the photosensitive member 1.
    </p>
    <p num="91">The transfer medium 7 to which the images have been transferred is separated from the surface of the photosensitive member, is led to an image fixing means 8, where the images are fixed, and is then printed out of the apparatus as a copied material (a copy).</p>
    <p num="92">
      The surface of the photosensitive member 1 after the transfer of images is brought to removal of the toner remaining after the transfer, through a cleaning means 9.
      <br/>
      Thus, the photosensitive member is cleaned on its surface, further subjected to charge elimination by pre-exposure light 10 emitted from a pre-exposure means (not shown), and then repeatedly used for the formation of images.
      <br/>
      In the apparatus shown in FIG. 4, the primary charging means 3 is a contact charging means making use of a charging roller, and hence the pre-exposure is not necessarily required.
    </p>
    <p num="93">
      In the present invention, the apparatus may be constituted of a combination of plural components integrally joined as a process cartridge from among the constituents such as the above electrophotographic photosensitive member 1, primary charging means 3, developing means 5 and cleaning means 9 so that the process cartridge is detachably mountable to the body of the electrophotographic apparatus such as a copying machine or a laser beam printer.
      <br/>
      For example, at least one of the primary charging means 3, the developing means 5 and the cleaning means 9 may integrally be supported in a cartridge together with the electrophotographic photosensitive member 1 to form a process cartridge 11 that is detachably mountable to the body of the apparatus through a guide means such as a rail 12 provided in the body of the apparatus.

      Each photosensitive member was electrostatically charged by a corona charging assembly so as to have a surface potential of -700 V, and then exposed to monochromatic light of 400 nm isolated with a monochromator, where the amount of light necessary for the surface potential to attenuate to -350 V was measured to determine sensitivity (E 1/2).
      <br/>
      Sensitivities at monochromatic light of 450 nm and 500 nm were also measured in the same way.

    <p num="103">Repetition Performance:</p>
    <p num="104">Next, initial dark-area potential (Vd) and initial light-area potential (Vl) were set at about -700 V and -200 V, respectively, and charging and exposure were repeated 3,000 times using monochromatic light of 400 nm to measure variations of Vd and Vl ( DELTA Vd,  DELTA Vl).</p>
    <p num="105">Photomemory:</p>
    <p num="106">
      The initial Vd and 400 nm monochromatic light initial Vl of the photosensitive member were set at about -700 V and -200 V, respectively.

      Then, the photosensitive member was partly irradiated by 400 nm monochromatic light of 20  MU W/cm2 in light intensity for 15 minutes, and thereafter the Vd and Vl of the photosensitive member was again measured, thus the difference in Vd between non-irradiated areas and irradiated areas ( DELTA VdPM) and the difference in Vl between non-irradiated areas and irradiated areas ( DELTA VlPM) were measured.
