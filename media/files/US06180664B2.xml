    <p num="2">The present invention relates to novel pentaerythritol derivatives, to the preparation and use thereof, especially as drugs, and to intermediates for the synthesis thereof.</p>
    <heading>KNOWN TECHNICAL BACKGROUND</heading>
    <p num="3">
      Organic nitric acid esters such as glycerol trinitrate (GTN) (Murrel, Lancet: 80, 113, 151 (1879)), pentaerythrityl tetranitrate (PETN) (Risemann et al., Circulation, Vol.
      <br/>
      XVII, 22 (1958), U.S. Pat. No. 2,370,437), isosorbide-5-mononitrate (ISMN) (DE-OS-2221080 DE-OS-2751934DE-PS-3028873, DE-OS-2903927, DE-OS-3102947, DE-OS-3124410, EP-A1-045076, EP-A1-057847, EP-A1-059664, EP-A1-064194, EP-A1-067964, EP-A1-143507, U.S. Pat. No. 3,886,186, U.S. Pat. No. 4,065,488, U.S. Pat. No. 4,417,065, U.S. Pat. No. 4,431,829), isosorbide dinitrate (ISDN) (L. Goldberg, Acta Physiolog.
      <br/>
      Scand. 15, 173 (1948)), propatyl nitrate (Medard, Mem.
      <br/>
      Poudres 35: 113 (1953)), trolnitrate (FR-PS 984523) or nicorandil (U.S. Pat. No. 4,200,640) and similar compounds are vasodilators, some of which have been used very widely for decades as major drugs in the therapy of the indication angina pectoris or ischaemic heart disease (IHD) (Nitrangin.RTM., Pentalong.RTM., Monolong.RTM., etc.).
      <br/>
      Other pentaerythrityl nitrates and their preparation have likewise been described (Simecek, Coll.
      <br/>
      Czech. Chem. Comm. 27 (1962), 363; Camp et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc. 77 (1955), 751).
      <br/>
      Organic "nitrates" of a more recent type, for example SPM 3672 (N-�3-nitratopivaloyl�-L-cysteine ethyl ester) (U.S. Pat. No. 5,284,872) and derivatives thereof or 1,4-dihydropyridine derivatives (WO-A1-92/02503), have a comparable and improved pharmacological efficacy when used in the above-mentioned areas of indication.
      <br/>
      In addition to the applications of nitrosating substances which have been known for many years, their use for the treatment and prevention of diseases caused by pathologically increased concentrations of sulfur-containing amino acids in body fluids has been described.
      <br/>
      These pathological conditions, brought about by congenital or acquired defects in the metabolism of these amino acids and characterized by increased blood and urine concentrations of said amino acids (homocystinuria), are collectively described by the term homocysteinaemia (WO-A1-92/18002).
      <br/>
      Other uses of the above substances have recently been described, for instance as endothelium-protecting agents (DE-A1-4410997), agents for the treatment of pathologically increased intraocular pressure (WO-A1-95/13812), agents for the treatment of dysmenorrhoea, dysfunctional uterine bleeding, premature labour or after-pains by reducing the uterine contractility (WO-A1-95/13802), agents for the treatment of menopausal symptoms (WO-A1-95/13800) or agents for the treatment of erectile dysfunctions (Merfort, Munch.
      <br/>
      Med. Wochenschr. 138 (1996), 504-507; Gomaa et al., Br. Med. J. 312 (1996), 1512-1515).
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      On the one hand, the hitherto known organic nitric acid esters have a number of associated therapeutic disadvantages.
      <br/>
      Thus, for example, it is necessary to observe the so-called nitrate tolerance, i.e. the decrease in the action of nitrate at high dosage or when administering longer-acting nitric acid esters.
      <br/>
      Side effects such as headache, vertigo, nausea, feeling of weakness, erythema and the danger of a comparatively large drop in blood pressure with reflex tachycardia have likewise been verified (Mutschler, Arzneimittelwirkungen (Drug actions), Wissenschaftliche Verlagsgesellschaft mbH, Stuttgart, 1991).
      <br/>
      On the other hand, PETN as an active substance possesses a number of outstanding properties, especially occurrence of the above-mentioned side effects to only a small extent, if at all, justifying the preferential use of this compound as a drug over other organic nitric acid esters (series of publications entitled "Pentaerythrityltetranitrat" ("Pentaerythrityl tetranitrate"), Dr.
      <br/>
      Dietrich Steinkopff Verlag, Darmstadt, 1994 to 1996).

    <p num="5">
      The galenical processing of organic nitric acid esters to pharmaceutical formulations for the treatment of angina pectoris or ischaemic heart disease are generally known.
      <br/>
      It is carried out in accordance with the working procedures and rules generally familiar to those skilled in the art of pharmaceutics, the choice of which technologies to apply and which galenical adjuncts to use depending primarily on the active substance to be processed.
      <br/>
      Questions of its physicochemical properties, the chosen form of administration, the desired duration of action and the avoidance of drug/adjunct incompatibilities are of particular importance here.
      <br/>
      Especially peroral, parenteral, sublingual or transdermal administration, in the form of tablets, coated tablets, capsules, solutions, sprays or plasters, is described for drugs indicated for angina pectoris or ischaemic heart disease (DD-A5-293492, DE-AS-2623800, DE-OS-3325652, DE-OS-3328094, DE-PS-4007705, DE-OS-4038203, JP patent application 59/10513 (1982)).

    <heading>DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="9">The object of the invention is to provide novel compounds derived from pentaerythritol which have pharmacologically advantageous actions, in particular with the greatest possible retention of the properties characteristic of pentaerythrityl tetranitrate and superior to those of other nitrates.</p>
    <p num="10">The object of the invention is achieved by compounds of general formula I:  (Chemical Structure image '2' not included in text)</p>
    <p num="11">in which</p>
    <p num="12">
      R1, R2, R3 are identical to or different from one another and are CH2 --ONO2, CH2 --OR4 or R5, at least one of the substituents R1 to R3 being R5,

      X is a halogen or a group capable of anion formation, ps and therapeutically acceptable salts thereof.  (Chemical Structure image '3' not included in text)

      R4 is H or C1 - to C6 -alkenoyl, and
      <br/>
      R6 is OH, OR7, NH2, NHR7, NR72 or N+ R73 X-, i.e. especially the esters and mixed esters, amides, hemiamides, amidoesters and ammonium salts.
    </p>
    <p num="14">
      Other preferred embodiments are compounds having one, two and three hydrophilic groups.
      <br/>
      This relates in particular to the metal and ammonium salts, esters, amides and hydrazides of carboxylic acids.
      <br/>
      Particularly preferred compounds are those of formulae VIII to XIII:  (Chemical Structure image '4' not included in text)
    </p>
    <p num="15">especially 3-nitryloxy-2,2-bis(nitryloxymethyl)propionic acid, 2,2-bis(nitryloxymethyl)malonic acid and 2-carboxy-2-nitryloxmethlmalonic acid.</p>
    <p num="16">
      The readily accessible nitric acid esters of pentaerythritol are used as starting compounds; for the preparation of said esters, reference is made expressly to the process of partial denitration of pentaerythrityl tetranitrate by means of hydrazine (Simecek, Coll.
      <br/>
      Czech. Chem. Comm. 27 (1962), 363 and U.S. Pat. No. 3,408,383).
      <br/>
      Another method is the nitration of pentaerythritol to the trinitrate, followed by its hydrazinolysis to pentaerythrityl dinitrate and mononitrate and by chromatographic separation of the mixture formed.
      <br/>
      Other starting compounds used are 2,2-bis(hydroxymethyl)malonic acid (Gault, Roesch, C. R. Hebd. Seances Acad.
      <br/>
      Sci. (1934), 615; Bull.
      <br/>
      Soc. Chim. Fr. &lt;5&gt;4 (1937), 1432) and 2-carboxy-2-hydroxymethylmalonic acid (Hueckel et al., Lieb. Ann. Chem. 528 (1937), 68).
      <br/>
      Further processing to the individual target compounds is carried out in each case by means of reactions and methods familiar to those skilled in the art.
      <br/>
      Thus, for example, acid-catalyzed reaction of nitryloxymethylated propionic or malonic acids or their acid halides with alcohols, or other esterification methods familiar to those skilled in the art, such as transesterifications, give the corresponding esters in good yields.
      <br/>
      Linear and branched primary, secondary and tertiary C1 -C6 -alkanols and -alkenols and aryl, heteroaryl, aralkyl and heteroaralkyl alcohols are particularly suitable for this purpose.
      <br/>
      The homologous acid amides, hemiamides or hydrazides are obtained by reacting said acid halides and esters with NH3, primary and secondary amines or hydrazine or 1-substituted hydrazines.
      <br/>
      Primary and secondary aliphatic, aromatic and heteroaromatic amines or hydrazine and 1-substituted hydrazines are suitable for this purpose.

    <p num="17">A further embodiment of the invention consists of the compounds of general formula XIV:  (Chemical Structure image '5' not included in text)</p>
    <p num="18">
      in which
      <br/>
      R13 is a group of formula XV:

    </p>
    <p num="20">
      The compounds of formula XIV are obtained in particular from the compounds of formulae VIII to XIII, e.g. 3-nitryloxy-2,2-bis(nitryloxymethyl)propionic acid (Tri-PA), 2,2-bis(nitryloxymethyl)malonic acid (Bis-MA) or 2-carboxy-2-nitryloxymethylmalonic acid (CN-MA), by reaction with pentaeryth derivatives of formula XV.1:
      <br/>
      HO--CH2 C(CH2 OH)q (CH2 ONO2)r.  (XV.1)
    </p>
    <p num="21">
      Likewise. derivatives of the compounds of formulae VIII to XIII, for example of Tri-PA, Bis-MA, CN-MA or XV.1, can be used as starting compounds for the synthesis of the compounds XIV, whose functional groups, as suitable leaving groups, enable those skilled in the art to have access to the target compounds via esterification reactions.
      <br/>
      The reaction is performed by the generally known methods and procedures for the preparation of esters.
    </p>
    <p num="22">
      Compounds of formulae VIII to XIII, for example Tri-PA, Bis-MA, CN-MA and derivatives thereof, are also suitable in analogous manner as acid components for the preparation of esters whose alcohol component is formed by a partially nitrated polyalcohol, especially isosorbide mononitrate, 1-nitroglycerol, 2-nitroglycerol, 1,2-dinitroglycerol, 1,3-dinitroglycerol or partially nitrated erythritols.

      The readily accessible monobromopentaerythritol (Wawzonek et al., Org. Syntheses Coll.

      Vol. IV �1963� 681) and bis�2,2,2-tris(nitryloxymethyl)�ethyl ether (Friedrich et al., B. 63 �1930� 2683) are used as starting compounds.
      <br/>
      Further processing to the individual target compounds is carried out in each case by means of reactions and methods familiar to those skilled in the art.
      <br/>
      Thus there are 2 possible multistep synthetic routes to the preparation of 4-nitryloxy-3,3-bis(nitryloxymethyl)butanoic acid starting from monobromopentaerythritol.
      <br/>
      On the one hand, monobromopentaerythritol reacts in a nucleophilic substitution reaction to give 3,3-bis(hydroxymethyl)-4-hydroxybutyronitrile, which is saponified to 3,3-bis(hydroxymethyl)-4-hydroxybutanoic acid (Govaert et al., Mededeelingen van de Koninklijke Vlaamsche Academie voor Wetenschappen, Letteren en Schoone Kunsten van Belgie, Klasse der Wetenschappen 16 �1954� no. 8, 3-12) and then yields 4-nitryloxy-3,3-bis(nitryloxymethyl)butanoic acid on full esterification with nitric acid (U.S. Pat. No. 3,408,383).
      <br/>
      On the other hand, 4-nitryloxy-3,3-bis(nitryloxymethyl)butanoic acid is obtained by the esterification of monobromopentaerythritol with nitric acid to give 3-nitryloxy-2,2-bis(nitryloxymethyl)propyl bromide (D. E. Elrik et al., Am. Soc. 76�1954� 1374), followed by conversion to a Grignard reagent and reaction with carbon dioxide.

      Diethyl 2,2-bis(nitryloxymethyl)malonate is prepared using the readily accessible diethyl 2,2-bis(hydroxymethyl)malonate (Gault, Roesch, C. R. Hebd. Seances Acad.

      Furthermore, it is obvious to those skilled in the art that, to prepare the compounds according to the invention, they can or must use a variety of derivatives in which reactive centres are inactivated by known protecting groups in order to avoid unwanted secondary reactions and by-products.
      <br/>
      These protecting groups can be removed after completion of the appropriate reaction or in the appropriate final step.
      <br/>
      The use of these derivatives which carry protecting groups is likewise within the scope of the present invention.

      It is also possible to use pharmacologically acceptable derivatives of all the above-mentioned compounds.
      <br/>
      In particular, customary addition compounds, salts or enzymatically or hydrolytically cleavable compounds, such as esters, amides and the like, represent possible variations.
    </p>
    <p num="47">
      Depending on the process conditions and the starting materials, different end products are obtained as the free acid or base, base or acid addition salt or betaine, all of which are within the scope of the invention.
      <br/>
      Thus it is possible to obtain acid, basic, neutral or mixed salts and hydrates.
      <br/>
      On the one hand, the salts in question can be converted in a manner known per se to the free acid or base using appropriate reagents or by means of ion exchange.
      <br/>
      On the other hand, the free acids or bases obtained can form salts with organic or inorganic bases or acids.
      <br/>
      The bases used to prepare base addition salts are particularly those which form suitable therapeutically acceptable salts.
      <br/>
      Examples of such bases are alkali metal and alkaline earth metal hydroxides or hydrides, ammonia, amines and hydrazines or guanidines.
      <br/>
      Likewise, the acids used to prepare acid addition salts are preferably those which form suitable therapeutically acceptable salts.
      <br/>
      Examples of such acids are hydrohalic, sulfonic, phosphoric, nitric and perchloric acids, as well as aliphatic, acyclic, aromatic or heterocyclic carboxylic or sulfonic acids such as formic, acetic, propionic, succinic, glycolic, lactic, malic, tartaric, citric, gluconic, saccharic, glucuronic, ascorbic, maleic, hydroxymaleic, pyruvic, phenylacetic, benzoic, p-aminobenzoic, anthranilic, p-hydroxybenzoic, salicylic, acetylsalicylic, p-aminosalicylic, embonic, methanesulfonic, ethanesulfonic, hydroxyethanesulfonic, ethylenesulfonic, halogenobenzenesulfonic, toluenesulfonic, naphthylsulfonic or sulfanilic acid, and amino acids such as e.g. methionine, tryptophan, lysine or arginine.
      <br/>
      These and other salts of the novel compounds, e.g. picrates, can be used as a means of purifing the free acids or bases obtained.
      <br/>
      Salts of the acids or bases can be formed and separated out from solutions, after which the free acid or base can be obtained in a purer state from a new salt solution.
      <br/>
      Because of the relationship between the novel compounds in the free form and their salts, the salts are within the scope of the invention.
    </p>
    <p num="48">
      Depending on the choice of starting materials and process, some of the novel compounds can exist as optical isomers or as the racemate; alternatively, if they contain at least two centres of asymmetry, they can exist as an isomer mixture (racemate mixture).
      <br/>
      The isomer mixtures (racemate mixtures) obtained can be separated into two pure stereoisomeric (diastereoisomeric) racemates by means of chromatography or fractional crystallization.
      <br/>
      The racemates obtained can be separated by methods known per se, for instance by recrystallization from an optically active solvent, by the use of microorganisms, by reaction with optically active reagents to form compounds which can be separated, or by separation on the basis of the different solubilities of the diastereoisomers.
      <br/>
      Suitable optically active reagents are the L and D forms of tartaric, di-o-tolyltartaric, malic, mandelic, gluconic, saccharic, glucuronic, camphorsulfonic, quininic or binaphthylphosphoric acid, or optically active bases.
      <br/>
      It is preferable to isolate the more active moiety of the two antipodes.
      <br/>
      The starting materials are known or, if novel, can be obtained by methods known per se.
      <br/>
      The racemate mixtures and optically pure isomers, and their salts or addition compounds with optically active reagents, are likewise within the scope of the present invention.

    <p num="49">
      The compounds according to the invention can be put to clinical use on their own or as part of a galenical preparation, either as the sole active substance, or in combination with one another, or combined with known cardiovascular therapeutic agents, for example ACE inhibitors, antiatherosclerotics, antihypertensives, beta-blockers, cholesterol depressants, diuretics, calcium antagonists, coronary dilators, lipid depressants, peripheral vasodilators, platelet aggregation inhibitors or other substances also used as cardiovascular therapeutic agents.
      <br/>
      Galenical formulations are prepared in accordance with the working procedures and rules generally familiar to those skilled in the art of pharmaceutics, the choice of which technologies to apply and which galenical adjuncts to use depending primarily on the active substance to be processed.
      <br/>
      Questions of its physicochemical properties, the chosen form of administration, the desired duration of action, the site of action and the avoidance of drug/adjunct incompatibilities are of particular importance here.
      <br/>
      Those skilled in the art are therefore responsible for selecting the medicinal form, adjuncts and preparative technology, in a manner which is trivial per se, with the aid of known substance and process parameters.
      <br/>
      The appropriate medicinal form should be designed so that, to achieve therapeutic plasma levels, it contains the active substance in question in an amount which makes it possible to divide the daily dose into 1 or 2 individual doses in the case of controlled release systems, or up to 10 individual doses in the case of other medicinal forms.
      <br/>
      Continuous administration by means of long-term infusion is also suitable.
      <br/>
      To achieve endothelium-protecting effects, it will generally be desirable to aim for sustained therapeutic blood levels.
      <br/>
      According to the invention, said compounds can particularly be administered orally, intravenously, parenterally, sublingually or transdermally.
      <br/>
      The medicinal formulation in question is preferably prepared in liquid or solid form.
      <br/>
      Suitable forms for this purpose are solutions, especially for the formulation of drops, injections, aerosol sprays or powder inhalers, as well as suspensions, emulsions, syrups, tablets, film-coated tablets, other coated tablets, capsules, pellets, powders, lozenges, implants, suppositories, creams, gels, ointments, plasters or other transdermal systems.
      <br/>
      The pharmaceutical formulations contain conventional organic or inorganic excipients and adjuncts usable for galenical purposes, which should themselves be chemically inert towards the active substances in question.
      <br/>
      This also includes chemical derivatization when the latter are brought into contact with excipients, relating especially to the formation of adducts with sugar derivatives like crosscarmelloses or cyclodextrins.
      <br/>
      Without implying a limitation, suitable pharmaceutical adjuncts are water, salt solutions, alcohols, vegetable oils, polyethylene glycols, gelatin, lactose, amylose, magnesium stearate, talcum, highly disperse silicon dioxide, paraffin, fatty acid monoglycerides and diglycerides, cellulose derivatives, polyvinylpyrrolidone and the like.
      <br/>
      The formulation can be sterilized and, if necessary, adjuncts like bulking agents, binders, formulation lubricants, mould release agents, mould lubricants, disintegrating agents, humectants, adsorbents, antidisintegrants, preservatives, stabilizers, emulsifiers, solubilizers, salts for influencing the osmotic pressure, buffer solutions, colours, fragrances, flavourings or sweeteners may be added.
      <br/>
      Using the appropriate substance parameters, those skilled in the art of pharmaceutics will have a suitable choice for avoiding drug/adjunct incompatibilities.

    <p num="50">
      In contrast to many known organic nitric acid esters used in therapeutics, a number of the compounds described above are characterized by a surprising hydrophilicity, which makes their galenical processing possible for the first time, simpler or more reliable because, in particular, the use of organic solvents can be largely dispensed with in the manufacture of pharmaceutical preparations, so they are also particularly suitable in general for use in sprays and metered aerosols, as well as solutions.
      <br/>
      Said good to very good water solubility moreover increases their absorption, ultimately leading to an improved bioavailability.
    </p>
    <p num="51">
      It has also been found that, surprisingly, the compounds according to the invention have the desired properties.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, some of them are characterized by an optimized NO release, e.g. by their differentiated content of reductively or oxidatively biotransforming NO precursor groups or by an improved or increased multiphase NO release, and, depending on the intended use, by increased lipophilicity or hydrophilicity, good bioavailability and increased cGMP accumulation, and by pharmacodynamic preload reduction, reduced increase in plasma endothelin, pronounced platelet aggregation inhibition due to platelet-active groups, and endothelium-protecting action.
    </p>
    <p num="52">The described invention thus opens up improved and considerably expanded therapeutic possibilities for the treatment of pathological situations such as cardiac and vascular diseases, especially coronary heart disease, vascular stenoses and circulatory disorders of the peripheral arteries, hypertonia, microangiopathies and macroangiopathies in the context of diabetes mellitus, atherosclerosis, oxidative stress conditions in vessels and tissues, including the secondary diseases resulting therefrom, erectile dysfunctions, increased intraocular pressure, dysmenorrhoea, dysfunctional uterine bleeding, uterine contractility dysfunctions such as premature labour, menopausal symptoms or incontinence.</p>

      Study of the pharmacological action of the compounds:
      <br/>
      a) The study is performed on cultivated cells (RFL-6 fibroblasts, LLC-PKl epithelial cells), which are known as a model for characterizing the action and tolerance profiles of NO donors (Bennett et al., J. Pharmacol. Ther. 250 (1989), 316; Schroder et al., J. Appl. Cardiol. 2 (1987), 301; J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 245 (1988), 413; Naunyn Schmiedeberg's Arch.
      <br/>
      Pharmacol. 342 (1990), 616; J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 262 (1992), 298; Adv.
      <br/>
      Drug Res. 28 (1996), 253).
      <br/>
      The intracellular accumulation of cGMP as a parameter of the nitrate action and bioactivation is measured by means of a radioimmunoassay.
      <br/>
      The intracellular accumulation of cGMP brought about by the tested compounds is two to ten times higher than that of GTN or ISMN.
      <br/>
      b) The platelet aggregation inhibiting action and thrombogenesis inhibiting action of the compounds is determined by the method of Rehse et al. (Arch. Pharm. 324, 301-305 (1991); Arch.
      <br/>
      Pharm. Pharm. Med. Chem. 329, 83 (1996), 191 (1996), 511 (1996)), which is established as a model especially of the extended Born test (Mackie et al., J. Clin. Pathol. 37 (1984), 874; Sharp et al., Thromb. Haem. 64(2) (1990), 211) for describing anticoagulant and antithrombotic properties.
      <br/>
      It is also determined by means of direct inhibition of the platelet function by organic nitrates and their biotransformation (Weber et al., Europ. J. Pharmacol.--Molecular Pharmacol. 247 (1993), 29; Weber et al., Europ. J. Pharmacol. 309 (1996), 209).
      <br/>
      c) The endothelium-protecting action of the compounds is determined by the method of Noack and Kojda described in DE-A1-44 10 997.
      <br/>
      d) Studies on the action against erectile dysfunctions are carried out by the method of Merfort et al. (Munch. Med. Wochenschrift 138 (1996), 504) and Gomaa et al. (Br. Med. J. 312 (1996), 1512).
      <br/>
      e) To test the vasodilating properties, the substances were used in experiments on isolated rabbit aortic rings (Huisgen, Noack, Kojda: Int.
      <br/>
      Confer. "Mediators in the cardiovascular system", p.9, Malta 2-5.6.1994), which were suspended in organ baths and stimulated by vasoconstrictors like phenylephrine.
      <br/>
      After a stable smooth muscular tonus has been established, the influence on the tonus due to the addition of the above-mentioned vasodilators is determined by means of cumulative concentration/effect curves.
      <br/>
      This is done by adding increasing concentrations of between 1 nM and 10  MU M of the vasodilator to the organ bath buffer with no wash-out between the different fractions.
      <br/>
      In all the aortic rings, addition of the substance caused a stepwise reduction of the contraction in the presence of the vasoconstrictor.
      <br/>
      The extent of the relaxation is expressed as a percentage of the contraction still remaining at the particular active substance concentration (residual contraction).
      <br/>
      The 50% effective concentration, EC50, represents the potency and is given as the pD2 value (concentration in log M), compared in each case with the known compound PETN, PETriN, PEDN or PEMN of appropriate comparable hydrophilicity or hydrophobicity.
