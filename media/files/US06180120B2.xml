    <heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="1">Cosmetic methods and compositions for skin care by topical application to the skin of cosmetic compositions containing an alpha hydroxy acid linoleate.</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">
      Alpha hydroxy acids and esters thereof and linoleic acid esters are well known in the cosmetic art.
      <br/>
      The compounds employed in the present invention are different at least in that an ester linkage is between the carboxyl group of linoleic acid and the hydroxy group of the hydroxy acid.
      <br/>
      Alpha carboxylic acids are also known as 2-hydroxy carboxylic acids; thus, the compounds of the present invention may also be called "2-hydroxy carboxylic acid ester of linoleic acid." It has been found, as part of the present invention, that such compounds have a variety of cosmetically beneficial effects on the skin.
      <br/>
      Specifically, some of these compounds control sebum secretion on the skin, even though, when employed separately, linoleic acid and the hydroxy acid do not achieve the same effect.
      <br/>
      In addition, alpha hydroxy acid linoleates increase collagen production by skin cells, which is typically associated with skin anti-aging benefits.
    </p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="3">The present invention includes a cosmetic skin care composition comprising:</p>
    <p num="4">(a) from 0.0001 to 20 wt. % of 2-hydroxy carboxylic acid ester of linoleic acid of Formula I:  (Chemical Structure image '1' not included in text)</p>
    <p num="5">
      wherein R is a hydrocarbon chain containing from 1 to 20 carbon atoms; and
      <br/>
      (b) a cosmetically acceptable vehicle.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      The inventive compositions provide control of sebum secretion from sebocytes, improved oil control and improved skin feel, prevent shine and stickiness, and provide increased collagen production by skin cells.
      <br/>
      These effects are associated with reduced appearance of wrinkles and aged skin, improved skin color, treatment of photoaged skin, improvement in skin's radiance and clarity and finish, and an overall healthy and youthful appearance of the skin.
    </p>
    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="7">Except in the operating and comparative examples, or where otherwise explicitly indicated, all numbers in this description indicating amounts or ratios of material or conditions of reaction, physical properties of materials and/or use are to be understood as modified by the word "about." All amounts are by weight of the final composition, unless otherwise specified.</p>
    <p num="8">The term "skin" as used herein includes the skin on the face, neck, chest, back, arms, legs, hands and scalp.</p>
    <p num="9">The terms "2-hydroxy carboxylic acid ester of linoleic acid" and "alpha hydroxy carboxylic acid ester of linoleic acid" and "alpha hydroxy carboxylic acid linoleate" and the abbreviation "AHAL" are used interchangeably herein and all refer to the following structural formula:  (Chemical Structure image '2' not included in text)</p>
    <p num="10">wherein R is a hydrocarbon chain containing from 1 to 20 carbon atoms.</p>
    <p num="11">AHAL compounds may be prepared by the following general procedure:</p>
    <p num="12">
      Into a round bottomed flask, alpha hydroxy carboxylic acid is mixed with pyridine (molar ratio in the general range of from 1:1 to 1:2) in an anhydrous, typically non-polar, solvent.
      <br/>
      Linoleic acid halide, most preferably chloride, is added at a temperature range of 20 to 45 (degree)  C. The molar range of alpha hydroxy carboxylic acid to linoleic acid halide is typically 1:1 to 1:2.
      <br/>

      Collagen is a predominant skin protein.
      <br/>
      Its synthesis decreases with aging or photodamage.
      <br/>
      The degradation or destruction of collagen increases the tensile strength of the skin causing wrinkles and laxity.
      <br/>
      Many studies involving human subjects have shown that collagen type I is decreased with increasing severity of photodamage (See Kligman, A., JAMA, (1969), 210, pp. 2377-2380; Lavker, R., J. Inv Derm., (1979), 73, 79-66; Smith J. et al., J. Inv. Derm., (1962), 39, pp. 347-350; and Shuster, S. et al., Br. J. Dermatol., (1975), 93, pp. 639-643); and some correlation in the histology of wrinkles and reduction in collagen levels in the sun-exposed skin has been reported.
      <br/>
      See Chen, S.; Kiss, I., J. Inv. Derm., (1992), 98. pp. 248-254. Voorhees and colleagues have supported these findings by showing the restoration of collagen type I in photo-damaged human skin by a topical treatment with tretinoin.

      This example reports an in vitro analysis of sebum suppression by various test compounds. "Oily skin" is an undesirable skin condition which results from the excessive amount of sebum on the skin, Sebum is skin oil which is produced by sebocytes (cells of the sebaceous glands in the skin) and is then secreted to the skin surface.
      <br/>
      Oily skin is associated with a shiny, undesirable appearance and a disagreeable tactile sensation.
