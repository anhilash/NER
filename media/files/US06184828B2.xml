    <p num="2">
      1.
      <br/>
      Field of the Invention
    </p>
    <p num="3">The present invention relates to beam scanning antennas used for radar antennas, mobile communication antennas, satellite broadcasting receiving antennas, satellite-installed-antennas, and so forth.</p>
    <p num="4">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
    <p num="5">
      In antennas used for radars, mobile communications, satellite broadcasting reception, and so forth, a function which freely scans a beam in a desired direction is important.
      <br/>
      For example, when a mobile communication is performed, a mobile station (for example, an automobile or an airplane) is usually moving.
      <br/>
      Thus, a beam radiated from the antenna of the mobile station is not always directed to a predetermined direction.
      <br/>
      In this case, the beam of the antenna should be tracked to the predetermined direction (namely, the direction of an objective station which receives and/or transmits radio waves).
      <br/>
      As a means for scanning the beam of an antenna, the following methods have been employed.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      As a first method, a beam is scanned by a mechanical driving means.
      <br/>
      FIG. 103 shows the construction of an example of a mechanical driving means which scans a beam.
      <br/>
      The mechanical driving means for scanning the beam requires an elevation (vertical plane) driving member and an azimuth (horizontal plane) driving member.
      <br/>
      In the mechanical driving means, the beam scanning process does not adversely affect the electric characteristics (such as radiation directivity) of an antenna 1.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      However, the construction of the driving mechanism becomes complicated.
      <br/>
      In addition, there is a problem on durability of the rotary joint used for the driving mechanism.
      <br/>
      In particular, in a mobile communication, a lower and flat antenna is required.
      <br/>
      Thus, the mechanical driving method is disadvantageous.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      As a second method, an electrical beam-scanning method is known.
      <br/>
      FIG. 104 shows the construction of an example of an electrical beam-scanning method.
      <br/>
      As shown in the figure, a plurality of antenna elements 2 are electrically connected to corresponding phase shifters 3.
      <br/>
      In the receiving operation, signals received from the antenna elements are combined by a feeding circuit 4.
      <br/>
      In the transmitting operation, a signal is distributed to the antenna elements 2 by the feeding circuit 4.
      <br/>
      The exciting phases of the antenna elements are adjusted by the phase shifters so as to scan the beam in a desired direction.
      <br/>
      In this method, since all the antenna elements 2, the phase shifters 3, and the feeding circuit 4 are disposed on the same plane, the beam scanning antenna can be thinly formed.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      However, in this method, since each antenna element requires a phase shifter, the size of the beam scanning antenna becomes large.
      <br/>
      In addition, the cost of the antenna increases.
      <br/>
      Moreover, to control the phases of the phase shifters 3, a control circuit is required.
      <br/>
      Thus, the construction of the antenna becomes complicated.
    </p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="10">A first object of the present invention is to provide a beam scanning antenna whose feeding system is simply constructed.</p>
    <p num="11">A second object of the present invention is to provide a beam scanning antenna which is easily produced.</p>
    <p num="12">A third object of the present invention is to provide a beam scanning antenna which is produced at low cost.</p>
    <p num="13">A fourth embodiment of the present invention is to provide a beam scanning antenna which is very effective for an antenna installed in a mobile station.</p>
    <p num="14">To solve the above problems, the present invention is a beam scanning antenna, comprising: a plurality of unit radiation elements for receiving or transmitting radio waves, a radiation direction of each of said unit radiation elements being discretely selected so as to be along a conical plane, the conical plane being composed of a set of lines which are disposed with a predetermined angle to a reference direction, the radiation elements being disposed so that the received or transmitted radio waves are strengthen by each other.</p>
    <p num="15">
      The present invention is an array antenna having a plurality of antenna elements, each of which has a means for scanning a beam in the direction of a tilt angle  THETA  from a boresight of the beam scanning antenna and electrically varying the direction of a rotation angle  PHI  of the beam.
      <br/>
      By arraying the antenna elements, the beam is formed in the direction of the angle  THETA  to the boresight of the antenna.
      <br/>
      The rotation angle  PHI  of the beam on an antenna element pattern can be electrically varied.
      <br/>
      The present invention is an array antenna having a plurality of antenna elements which form a plurality of antenna arrays, wherein the optical path difference of radio waves transmitted or received by each of the antenna arrays in the directions of a plurality of direction angles  PHI  on the plane tilted for an angle  THETA  to a boresight of the beam scanning antenna is nearly a multiple of the wave length.
      <br/>
      Thus, when the antenna elements are excited in the same phase, the gains in these directions can be increased.
    </p>
    <p num="16">The present invention is a beam scanning antenna having a means for shifting the exciting phases of signals of the radiation elements for every 180 degrees or 90 degrees.</p>
    <p num="17">
      The present invention is an array antenna comprising a plurality of antenna elements, each of which has a means for electrically varying the direction of a beam, the direction of the beam can be controlled for each antenna element.
      <br/>
      When these antenna elements are arrayed, under the control of one-bit or two-bit variable phase shifters connected thereof, the exciting phase can be varied for every 180 degrees or 90 degrees.
      <br/>
      Thus, the beam of the composite radiation field of the array antenna can be scanned to the desired direction.
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      The present invention is a beam scanning antenna, comprising a plurality of antenna elements, each of which has a plurality of operation modes, wherein the antenna elements are microstrip antenna members or horn antenna members, wherein each of the antenna element is connected to a low-bit variable phase shifter, and wherein a feeding circuit or a distributing circuit Us formed for each of the modes, the feeding circuit or the distributing circuit being connected to a high-bit variable phase shifter, so as to combine or distribute radio waves of each of the modes.
      <br/>
      Thus, the beam direction can be controlled for each antenna element.
      <br/>
      In addition, the phase of each mode for each antenna element can be coarsely varied.
      <br/>
      In the receiving operation, the signals received from all the antenna elements are combined by the feeding circuit.
      <br/>
      In the transmitting operation, the signal is distributed to all the antenna elements.
      <br/>
      The signal which has been combined or the signals which have not been distributed are precisely phase-shifted.
      <br/>
      Signals with a phase difference in each mode can be combined or distributed by the combining device or distributing device.
      <br/>
      Thus, the direction of the beam can be controlled for each element antenna.
      <br/>
      Consequently, the phase of each mode for each antenna element can be coarsely varied.
      <br/>
      In addition, when a sub array is constructed of at least two antenna elements, the direction of a beam can be controlled for the sub array.
      <br/>
      When an array antenna has a plurality of such sub arrays, each of which has a means for shifting the exciting phase thereof for every 180 degrees or 90 degrees, the beam of the composite radiation field of the array antenna can be scanned to a desired direction.
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      According to the present invention, a beam scanning antenna which electrically varies the direction of the rotation angle  PHI  on the plane tilted for the elevation angle  THETA  from the boresight can be provided.
      <br/>
      In comparison with the conventional electrically scanning antenna, the number of phase shifters can be remarkably reduced.
      <br/>
      Thus, the construction of the feeding system can be simplified, thereby decreasing the production steps of the antenna.
      <br/>
      Since the number of phase shifters is reduced, the production cost is also decreased.
      <br/>
      Since the antenna which electrically scans the beam can be formed in a plane shape, it is very effective for an antenna installed in a mobile station.
    </p>
    <p num="20">
      According to the present invention, a beam scanning antenna which electrically scan a beam in any direction can be provided.
      <br/>
      Thus, in comparison with a conventional electrically scanning antenna, phase shifters can be simply constructed.
      <br/>
      In other words, most of phase shifters can be low-bit phase shifters.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the control circuit and DC circuit can be shared with most of the phase shifters.
      <br/>
      In addition, the number of low-noise amplifiers which prevents C/N deterioration but result in power loss of the phase shifters can be remarkably reduced.
      <br/>
      Thus, the construction of the feeding system can be simplified, thereby decreasing the production steps.
      <br/>
      Because of simple construction of phase shifters, sharing of control circuit, and decrease of low noise amplifiers, the cost of the beam scanning antenna can be remarkably reduced.
      <br/>
      Since the beam scanning antenna can be formed in a plane shape, it is very effective for an antenna installed in a mobile station.
    </p>
    <p num="21">
      In addition, according to the present invention, an array antenna which forms a conical beam can be thinly formed.
      <br/>
      In addition, the antenna can be optimally designed to have a peak in the direction of a predetermined elevation angle  THETA .
      <br/>
      This antenna is effectively used for an antenna installed in a mobile station which communicates with stationary communicating and/or broadcasting satellites.
      <br/>
      Moreover, according to the present invention, since the degree of freedom in design is high and the frequency band can be widened.
      <br/>
      When a plurality of such antenna elements are used and switched, an antenna which can scan a beam in the  THETA  direction, an antenna which can select or share a polarized wave, an antenna which can select or use transmitting and receiving operations, and so forth can be easily formed.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, when a plurality of such antenna elements are used and radio waves with proper phase differences are combined, a beam scanning antenna which scans the composite beam in the direction of any rotation angle  PHI  can be easily formed.
    </p>
    <p num="22">
      Moreover, according to the present invention, since an array antenna which scans a conical beam can be thinly formed, it can be optimally designed so that the peak of the beam is present in the direction of a predetermined elevation angle  THETA .
      <br/>
      This antenna is effectively used for an antenna installed in a mobile station which communicates with stationary communicating and/or broadcasting satellites.
      <br/>
      In addition, according to the present invention, the degree of freedom in design is high and the frequency band can be widened.
      <br/>
      When a plurality of conical beams with phase differences with respect to the rotation angle  PHI  are combined, a beam scanning antenna with a high gain can be provided.
      <br/>
      With phase shifters whose number is less than the number of conical beams, a beam can be scanned in the direction of the rotation angle  PHI .

      Thus, the number of phase shifters can be remarkable reduced, thereby simplifying the construction of the feeding system and lowering the cost of the antenna.

      Next, with reference to the accompanying drawings, embodiments of the present invention will be described.

      In the following description, unless otherwise specified, the construction for the receiving operation of the antennas according to the present invention will be described.

    <p num="26">
      FIG. 1 is a top view showing a beam scanning antenna according to a first embodiment of the present invention.
      <br/>
      In this embodiment, a vertically polarized radio wave (which has E THETA  component) is received.
      <br/>
      A beam is scanned in the directions of direction angles  PHI =0 degree,  +- 90 degrees, and 180 degrees on a plane tilted for an angle  THETA  to the boresight (z direction) of the antenna.
      <br/>
      In this embodiment, the beam scanning antenna is an array antenna which is constructed of four antenna elements.
    </p>
    <p num="27">
      The antenna is constructed of dominant mode exciting antenna members 11 to 14 and higher-order mode exciting antenna members 15 to 18.
      <br/>
      Each antenna element is constructed of one dominant mode exciting antenna member and one higher-order mode exciting antenna member.
      <br/>
      Each antenna member is a pin-feed (coaxial feed) microstrip antenna member.
      <br/>
      The antenna has feed points 19 to 30.
      <br/>
      Each antenna element can radiate a beam in the direction of with an angle  THETA  to the boresight (z direction) of the antenna as will be described later.
      <br/>
      In addition, the beam can be electrically scanned in the directions of the direction angles  PHI =0 degree,  +- 90 degrees, and 180 degrees by an electric means such as an RF switch.
    </p>
    <p num="28">The optical path difference �a * sin  THETA � of a radio wave received between adjacent antenna elements is set to a multiple of the wave length of the radio wave as in Table 1, where a is the antenna element pitch (spacing) and  THETA  is the elevation angle of the beam to the boresight of the antenna as shown in FIG. 2.</p>

    <p num="30">Thus, in the beam directions of  PHI =0 degree,  +- 90 degrees, and 180 degrees with an angle  THETA  to the boresight, when the antenna elements are excited in the same phase, a high gain can be obtained.</p>
    <p num="31">
      The rotation angle  PHI  of each antenna element can be varied on the plane with an angle  THETA  to the boresight by an electric means such as a phase shifter or an RF switch.
      <br/>
      Now, the way of electric scanning is explained as follows.
    </p>
    <p num="32">
      FIG. 3 is a schematic diagram showing one antenna element of the beam scanning antenna shown in FIG. 1.
      <br/>
      The dominant mode exciting antenna member 11 is a circular microstrip antenna member, whereas the higher-order mode exciting antenna member 15 is a ring microstrip antenna.
      <br/>
      The dominant mode exciting antenna member 11 is excited at the feed points 19 and 20.
      <br/>
      The component excited at the feed point 19 is perpendicular to the component excited at the feed point 20.
      <br/>
      The higher-order mode exciting antenna member 15 is excited at the feed point 21.
      <br/>
      Now, assume that the dominant mode of the circular microstrip antenna member is TM 11 mode, whereas the higher-order mode of the ring microstrip antenna member is TM 21 mode.
      <br/>
      In these modes, the radiation field at each feed point is given by the following equations.  (Equation image '1' not included in text)
    </p>
    <p num="33">where A THETA , A PHI , B THETA , and B PHI  depend on the elevation angle  THETA  and the shape of the antenna element.</p>
    <p num="34">
      FIG. 4 is a graph showing the relation between the E THETA  component of the radiation field and rotation angle  PHI  in each mode.
      <br/>
      In the figure, (a), (b), and (c) represent the dominant mode (feed point 20), the dominant mode (feed point 19), and the higher-order mode (feed point 21), respectively.
      <br/>
      In this figure, the intensity of the radiation fields in these modes is normalized so that their maximum values match each other.
      <br/>
      As is clear from the figure, the dominant mode (feed point 20) has two peaks at  PHI =0 degree and 180 degrees.
      <br/>
      The dominant mode (feed point 19) has two peaks at  PHI = +- 90 degrees.
      <br/>
      The higher-order mode (feed point 21) has three peaks at  PHI =0 degree,  +- 90 degrees, and 180 degrees.
    </p>
    <p num="35">
      Thus, in the condition that the antenna element is tilted for a predetermined angle  THETA , at  PHI =0 degree and 180 degrees, when the dominant mode (feed point 20) and the higher-order mode (feed point 21) are combined with the same amplitude and same phase, radiation directivity with a high gain can be obtained.
      <br/>
      Likewise, at  PHI = +- 90 degrees, when the dominant mode (feed point 19) and the higher-order mode (feed point 21) are combined with the same amplitude and same phase, radiation directivity with a high gain can be obtained.
    </p>
    <p num="36">FIG. 5 shows the composite directivity of the antenna element which scans a beam in the direction of  PHI =0 degree.</p>
    <p num="37">
      Next, the construction of a feeding system of the beam scanning antenna shown in FIG. 1 will be described.
      <br/>
      Each antenna element which scans a beam may be independently controlled.
      <br/>
      However, since the control method for setting the rotation angle  PHI  is in common with all the antenna elements, a feeding system shown in FIG. 6 may be used so as to simplify the construction of the beam scanning antenna.
    </p>
    <p num="38">
      Signals received from the dominant mode feed points and the higher-order feed points of the antenna elements 11 to 14 (which are reference numerals of dominant mode antenna members) are extracted through corresponding RF lines 34 such as microstrip lines or coaxial lines.
      <br/>
      The signals received from the dominant mode feed points 19, 22, 25, and 28 are combined by a feeding circuit 31.
      <br/>
      The signals received from the dominant mode feed points 20, 23, 26, and 29 are combined by a feeding circuit 32.
      <br/>
      The signals received from the higher-order mode feed points 21, 24, 27, and 30 are combined by a feeding circuit 33.
      <br/>
      The output signals of the feeding circuits 31 and 32 are sent to phase shifters 35 and 36 through corresponding RF lines, respectively.
      <br/>
      Since the phase shifters 35 and 36 each shift the phase of the input signal for either 0 degree or 180 degrees, their construction is simple.
      <br/>
      The output signals of the phase shifters 35 and 36 are sent to an RF switch 37 through an RF line.
      <br/>
      The RF switch 37 selects one of the two orthogonal components of the dominant mode.
      <br/>
      The output signals of the RF switch 37 and the feeding circuit 33 are sent to a combining device 38 through corresponding RF lines.
      <br/>
      The combining device 38 combines these signals.
      <br/>
      When a radio wave is received in the direction where the beam is scanned in the direction of the elevation angle  THETA  and the rotation angle  PHI , the combining device 38 sets a combining ratio so that the two output signals received from the RF switch 37 and the feeding circuit 33 are combined with the same amplitude.
      <br/>
      This combining ratio depends on the angle  THETA  to the boresight of the beam scanning antenna.
      <br/>
      In other words, when this combining ratio is properly set, the elevation angle  THETA  of the beam to the boresight of the antenna can be adjusted.
    </p>
    <p num="39">
      Instead of setting the combining ratio, the combining device may be electrically connected to two amplifiers, each of which can set the amplitude of the input signal.
      <br/>
      By properly controlling the amplitude of these amplifiers, the amplitude of these input signals becomes the same.
      <br/>
      When a radio wave is received from the direction where the beam is scanned, the signals sent to the combining device are combined so that the phase of the output signal of the dominant mode feeing circuit becomes the same as that of the higher-order mode feeding circuit when the phases of the phase shifters are set to either 0 degree or 180 degrees.
      <br/>
      This operation can be easily performed by properly setting the length of the RF lines.
      <br/>
      The direction of the beam can be electrically changed by the the phase shifters and the RF switch.
    </p>
    <p num="40">
      For example, assume that when the RF switch 37 is placed in position A and the phase of the phase shifter 36 is set to 0 degree, the beam is scanned in the direction of  PHI =0 degree.
      <br/>
      In this case, when the phase of the phase shifter 36 is set to 180 degrees, the beam is scanned in the direction of  PHI =180 degrees.
      <br/>
      When the RF switch 37 is placed in position B, if the phase of the phase shifter is set to 0 degree, the beam is scanned in the direction of  PHI =+90 degrees.
      <br/>
      In this case, if the phase of the phase shifter is set to 180 degrees, the beam is scanned in the direction of  PHI =-90 degrees.
      <br/>
      The direction of the beam can be varied only by the two phase shifters and the RF switch.
      <br/>
      In this construction, when a phase shifter is disposed on the higher-order mode side, all of the phase shifters on the dominant mode side can be omitted.

      Next, the construction of a practical example of the beam scanning antenna and the feeding circuit will be described.
      <br/>
      FIG. 7 is a top view showing the beam scanning antenna according to the first embodiment of the present invention.
      <br/>
      FIG. 8 shows a sectional view of FIG. 7.
      <br/>
      As shown in FIG. 8, the beam scanning antenna is constructed of seven dielectric substrates 40 to 46.
      <br/>
      On the upper surface of the dielectric substrate 40, circular microstrip antenna members 11 to 14, ring microstrip antenna members 15 to 18, and antenna feed points 19 to 30 are disposed, each of which is made of a conductor film.
      <br/>
      On the lower surface of the dielectric substrate 40, a ground conductor 82 is disposed.
      <br/>
      The ground conductor is made of a conductor film and functions as an antenna member.
      <br/>
      The dielectric substrates 41 and 42 form a first tri-plate line pattern for a dominant mode feeding circuit.
    </p>
    <p num="42">
      The first tri-plate line pattern is formed of the ground conductors 82 and 83 and lines 47 and 48.
      <br/>
      The ground conductor 82 is made of a conductor film which is disposed on the upper surface of the dielectric substrate 41.
      <br/>
      The ground conductor 83 is made of a conductor film which is disposed on the lower surface of the dielectric substrate 42.
      <br/>
      The lines 47 and 48 are made of a conductor film which is disposed on the upper surface of the dielectric substrate 42.
      <br/>
      FIG. 9 shows the construction of an example of these lines.
      <br/>
      The lines 47 and 48 form feeding circuits for orthogonal components of the dominant mode.
      <br/>
      The feed points 19, 20, 22, 23, 25, 26, 28, and 29 of the dominant mode exciting antenna members are electrically connected to line input ports 49, 50, 52, 53, 55, 56, 58, and 59 by corresponding pins or the like, respectively.
      <br/>
      The feeding circuits combine the input signals of the dominant mode antenna members of each antenna element in the same phase.
      <br/>
      The feeding circuits output the orthogonal components of the dominant mode to output ports 61 and 62.
      <br/>
      As with the dominant mode feeding circuits, the dielectric substrates 43 and 44 forms a higher-order mode feeding circuit as a second tri-plate line pattern.
      <br/>
      The second tri-plate line pattern is formed of ground conductors 83 and 84 and a line 64.
      <br/>
      The ground conductor 83 is made of a conductor film which is disposed on the upper surface of the dielectric substrate 43.
      <br/>
      The ground conductor 84 is made of a conductor film which is disposed on the lower surface of the dielectric substrate 44.
      <br/>
      The line 64 is made of a conductor film which is disposed on the upper surface of the dielectric substrate 44.
      <br/>
      FIG. 10 shows the construction of this line.
      <br/>
      The feed points 21, 24, 27, and 30 of the high-order exciting antenna members are electrically connected to input ports 51, 54, 57, and 60 by pins, respectively.
      <br/>
      Vertical lines which pass through the dielectric substrates are coaxial lines which are through-holes.
      <br/>
      These lines are referred to as transverse electromagnetic mode (TEM) mode lines.
      <br/>
      As with the feeding circuits for the dominant mode, the feeding circuit for the higher-order mode combines the output signals of the higher-order mode exciting antenna members of each antenna element in the same phase.
      <br/>
      The feeding circuit outputs the composite signal to an output port 63.
    </p>
    <p num="43">
      The dielectric substrates 45 and 46 form the phase shifters, the RF switch, and so forth as a third tri-plate line pattern.
      <br/>
      The third tri-plate line pattern is formed of ground conductors 84 and 85, and a line 69.
      <br/>
      The ground conductor 84 is made of a conductor film which is disposed on the upper surface of the dielectric substrate 45.
      <br/>
      The ground conductor 85 is made of a conductor film which is disposed on the lower surface of the dielectric substrate 46.
      <br/>
      The line 69 is made of a conductor film which is disposed on the upper surface of the dielectric substrate 46.
      <br/>
      FIG. 11 shows the construction of the line 69.
      <br/>
      As shown in the figure, the output signals of the two feeding circuits for the dominant mode are sent to ports 66 and 67 via through-hole lines from the upper layer.
      <br/>
      The signals of the ports 66 and 67 are sent to the phase shifters 87 and 88 through lines, respectively.
      <br/>
      The phase shifters 87 and 88 shift the phase of the input signals for 0 degree or 180 degrees by changing the line length.
      <br/>
      To change the line length, the phase shifter 87 is constructed of PIN diodes 74, 75, 76, and 77, whereas the phase shifter 88 is constructed of PIN diodes 78, 79, 80, and 81.
      <br/>
      The output signals of the phase shifters 87 and 88 are sent to an RF switch 86 which selects one of these signals.
      <br/>
      The RF switch 86 is constructed of PIN diodes 72 and 73.
      <br/>
      The output signal of the RF switch 86 is sent to a combining device 89.
      <br/>
      The combining device 89 combines the signals received from the RF switch 86 and the port 68 with a predetermined combining ratio.
      <br/>
      The combining device 89 is constructed of a T-branch.
      <br/>
      The output of the combining device 89 is sent to a connector 71 through a port 70.
    </p>
    <p num="44">
      In FIG. 11, for the sake of simplicity, a bias circuit and a control circuit which are formed of PIN diodes are omitted.
      <br/>
      The bias circuit and the controlling circuit may be formed on the plane in any method.
      <br/>
      In this embodiment, instead of the PIN diodes, FETs may be used.
      <br/>
      The phase shifters and the combining device are not limited to those described above.
      <br/>
      In addition, to match signals among the feeding circuits, the lines, and so forth which are described above, a stub, a 1/4 LAMBDA  transformer, or the like may be used.
    </p>
    <p num="45">
      In the above-described construction, a beam scanning antenna can be formed of dielectric substrates being layered.
      <br/>
      Thus, a thin type beam scanning antenna can be provided.
      <br/>
      Conductor films can be easily formed on dielectric substrates by etching process or the like.
      <br/>
      The substrates may be layered by machine screws, adhesive agent, adhesive films, or the like.
      <br/>
      The dielectric substrates each may have different composition and different permittivity each other.
      <br/>
      For example, to widen the band of the antenna, the uppermost dielectric substrate with a permittivity of nearly 1 may be used.
      <br/>
      Instead of the dielectric substrates, a honeycomb substance or the like may be used.
      <br/>
      In this embodiment, the feeding circuits for orthogonal components of the dominant mode are formed on the same layer.
      <br/>
      However, these feeding circuits may be formed on different layers.
      <br/>
      Likewise, the circular microstrip antenna members are formed on a layer different from the ring microstrip antenna members.
    </p>
    <p num="46">The beam scanning antenna in the above-described construction has the following effects and advantages.</p>
    <p num="47">
      First, the beam scanning antenna can be formed thinly and compactly.
      <br/>
      In addition, since the beam direction of a rotation angle  PHI  of the antenna is electrically controlled on the plane with an angle  THETA  to the boresight of the antenna, even if the antenna is installed at a high latitude place as in Japan, it is effectively used for an antenna for receiving and transmitting signals from and to communication and/or broadcasting satellites.
    </p>
    <p num="48">
      Moreover, since feeding circuits for respective modes are formed last and then the modes are selected and combined, the number of phase shifters can be remarkably reduced in comparison with the conventional antenna.
      <br/>
      Since the phase shifters, in particular, PIN diodes and FET used therein, are relatively expensive and the number thereof is decreased, the overall cost of the beam scanning antenna can be reduced.
    </p>
    <p num="49">
      Furthermore, since the number of PIN diodes is decreased, the bonding process using bonding wires or the like can be remarkably simplified.
      <br/>
      Thus, this is convenient for the production of the antenna.
      <br/>
      In the conventional electrically scanning antenna, as the number of antenna elements which construct the antenna increases, the number of phase shifters increases.
      <br/>
      However, according to the construction of this embodiment, even if the number of antenna elements increases, it is not necessary to proportionally increase the number of phase shifters.
      <br/>
      Thus, the more the number of antenna elements increases, the more the construction of the antenna is simplified in comparison with the conventional electrically scanning antenna.
      <br/>
      Thus, the overall cost of the antenna can be reduced.
    </p>
    <p num="50">
      In addition, according to the construction of this embodiment, since the antenna element spacing is larger than the of the conventional antenna, the size of each antenna element can be increased, thereby improving the gain thereof.
      <br/>
      Moreover, in comparison with the conventional electrically scanning antenna, due to a less restriction with respect to the antenna element pitch, the degree of freedom for the construction and type of each antenna element is high.
    </p>
    <p num="51">
      Furthermore, since the antenna element pitch can be increased, the electrical coupling between antenna elements decreases.
      <br/>
      Thus, the exciting distribution of the antenna does not deviate from a predetermined value.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the radiation directivity and the like are not adversely affected.
    </p>
    <p num="52">The embodiment of the present invention may be modified as follows.</p>
    <p num="53">
      In the first embodiment, a beam scanning antenna which receives a radio wave was described.
      <br/>
      However, because of the antenna's reciprocity theorem, the beam scanning antenna which transmits a radio wave can be formed almost in the same construction of the above-described embodiment.
      <br/>
      In the embodiment, as the antenna type, the dominant mode was excited by circular microstrip antenna members and the higher-order mode was excited by ring microstrip antenna member.
      <br/>
      However, the present invention is not limited to such construction.
      <br/>
      Instead, other antenna members having the different shape and different type may be used.
      <br/>
      With another mode, a beam with a angle  THETA  to the boresight may be combined.
    </p>
    <p num="54">
      In addition, to widen the band width of the antenna, parasitic devices being stacked may be used.
      <br/>
      In this construction, the same effect as the present invention may be obtained.
      <br/>
      In the above-described embodiment, as a feeding method for microstrip antenna members, pin feeding was used.
      <br/>
      Instead, another feeding method such as electromagnetic coupling method using slots or the like, direct feeding method using microstrip lines, etc. may be used.
    </p>
    <p num="55">
      As the RF lines, besides the tri-plate line patterns, other lines (such as suspended lines, microstrip lines, coaxial lines) may be used.
      <br/>
      In the first embodiment, a vertically polarized wave was considered.
      <br/>
      However, the present invention can be applied for a horizontally polarized wave in the same construction.
      <br/>
      This also applies to a circularly polarized wave (which will be described in another embodiment).
    </p>
    <p num="56">
      In the first embodiment, the antenna where antenna elements are disposed in a square shape was described.
      <br/>
      However, the present invention does not require that the antenna elements should be disposed strictly in a square shape.
      <br/>
      Instead, when a beam is scanned in a predetermined direction, if the optical path difference between adjacent antenna elements is around 0.20  LAMBDA  of a multiple of the wave length, the difference between the vertical length and the horizontal length of the antenna elements does not affect the characteristics of the antenna.

      In the following description, one antenna element is considered.
      <br/>
      The dominant mode exciting antenna member 90 is a circular microstrip antenna member, whereas the higher-order mode exciting antenna member 99 is a ring microstrip antenna.
      <br/>
      The dominant mode exciting antenna member 90 is excited at the feed points 108 and 109.
      <br/>
      A first component of the dominant mode excited at the feed point 108 is orthogonal to a second component of the dominant mode excited at the feed point 109.

      A first component of the higher-order mode excited at the feed point 110 is orthogonal to a second component of the higher-order mode excited at the feed point 111.

    <p num="66">
      Now, consider the TM 11 mode of the circular microstrip antenna member as the dominant mode and the TM 21 mode of the ring microstrip antenna member as the higher-order mode.
      <br/>
      As with the first embodiment, the variation of component E THETA  of the radiation field in each mode is shown in FIG. 15. In the figure, (a) represents the second component of the dominant mode (feed point 109); (b) represents the first component of the dominant mode (feed point 108); (c) represents a mode where the two components of the dominant mode are combined with the same amplitude and the same phase; and (d) represents a mode where the two components of the dominant mode are combined with the same amplitude and the reverse phase.
      <br/>
      In this figure, the radiation fields of the components and composite modes of the dominant modes are normalized so that the maximum values thereof match each other.
      <br/>
      As shown in the figure, the second component of the dominant mode (feed point 109) has two peaks at  PHI =0 degree and 180 degrees.
      <br/>
      The first component of the dominant mode (feed point 108) has two peaks at  PHI = +- 90 degrees.

      When the two components of the dominant mode are combined with the same amplitude and the same phase, there are two peaks at  PHI =135 degrees and -45 degrees.

      The second component of the higher-order mode (feed point 111) has four peaks at  PHI = +- 45 degrees and  +- 135 degrees.

    <p num="68">
      Thus, unlike with the first embodiment where a beam is scanned at every 90 degrees, according to the second embodiment, a beam can be scanned at every 45 degrees.

      In this embodiment, since the phase shifters 194 and 195 only shift the phases of the input signals for 0 degree or 180 degrees, the construction thereof is simple.

      Since the construction of the feeding system of this beam scanning antenna is simple, many advantages with respect to production and cost can be expected.

      This beam scanning antenna is particularly effective when high gain and narrow beam are required.

      <br/>
      Next, an embodiment of a beam scanning antenna which receives a circularly polarized wave will be described as a fourth embodiment.
    </p>
    <p num="96">
      FIG. 25 shows the operation of an antenna element of a beam scanning antenna which receives a circularly polarized wave according to the fourth embodiment of the present invention.
      <br/>
      The antenna element is constructed of a circular microstrip antenna member 400 and a ring microstrip antenna member 401.
      <br/>
      The circular microstrip antenna 400 excites a dominant mode, whereas the ring microstrip antenna 401 excites a higher-order mode.
      <br/>
      In this embodiment, the higher-order mode is TM 21 mode.
    </p>
    <p num="97">
      The circular microstrip antenna member has two feed points 402 and 403 which excite two orthogonal components of the dominant (TM 11) mode.
      <br/>
      The ring microstrip antenna member has two feed points 404 and 405 which excite two orthogonal components of the TM 21 mode.
      <br/>
      These feed points are pin-feed (coaxial feed) type.
      <br/>
      Radiation field components generated by the modes excited at the feed points are as follows.  (Equation image '2' not included in text)
    </p>
    <p num="98">
      Since A THETA , A PHI , B THETA , and B PHI  of the above equations are functions with respect to  THETA , they depend on the shape of the antenna.
      <br/>
      When two feed points are excited with a phase difference of 90 degrees, radiation field components of a circularly polarized wave are given by the following equations.  (Equation image '3' not included in text)
    </p>
    <p num="99">
      The direction of a circularly polarized wave that the dominant mode generates is the same as the direction of a circularly polarized wave that the higher-order mode generates.
      <br/>
      In this case, A THETA  is approximated to A PHI ( THETA ).
      <br/>
      In addition, B THETA  is approximated to B PHI ( THETA ).
    </p>
    <p num="100">
      Thus,
      <br/>
      A=A THETA ( THETA )=A PHI ( THETA )  (19)
      <br/>
      A=B THETA ( THETA )=B PHI ( THETA )  (20)
    </p>
    <p num="101">Therefore, the components of the circularly polarized waves of these modes can be given by the following formulas.</p>
    <p num="102">
      Dominant mode:Ec=2A exp (j PHI )  (21)
      <br/>
      Higher-order mode:Ec=2B exp (j2 PHI )  (21)
    </p>
    <p num="103">
      As clear from the equations (21) and (22), the intensity (absolute value) of the components of the circularly polarized wave does not depend on the rotation angle  PHI .
      <br/>
      On the other hand, its phase depends on the angle  PHI .
    </p>
    <p num="104">
      FIG. 26 shows the variation of the phases of the components of the circularly polarized wave.
      <br/>
      In the figure, (a) represents the phase of the component Ec of the dominant mode; and (b) represents the phase of the component Ec of the higher-order mode.
      <br/>
      In this figure, the phases of A and B are assumed to be 0.
      <br/>
      In this case, only when  PHI =0, the phase of the radiation field of the circularly polarized wave of the dominant mode matches the phase of that of the higher-order mode.
      <br/>
      Thus, the directivity of this direction becomes strong.
      <br/>
      Consequently, the beam of the antenna is scanned in this direction.
      <br/>
      To scan the beam in a desired direction, the corresponding proper phase difference should be given to A and B. For example, to scan the beam of the antenna in the direction of  PHI =90 degrees, the relation of �arg (A)-arg (B)=90 degrees� should be satisfied.
      <br/>
      To scan the beam of the antenna in the direction of  PHI =180 degrees, the relation of �arg (A)-arg (B)=180 degrees� should be satisfied.
      <br/>
      By controlling the phases of these modes with phase shifters and so forth, the beam can be scanned in any direction.
      <br/>
      FIG. 25 also shows the construction of an example of a feeding system for an antenna element which scans a beam.
      <br/>
      RF signals of two orthogonal components of the dominant mode are received from feed points 402 and 403 and sent to a circular polarizer 406 which generates (receives) a circularly polarized wave.
      <br/>
      Likewise, RF signals of two orthogonal components of the higher-order mode are received from feed points 404 and 405 and sent to a circular polarizer 407 which generates (receives) a circularly polarized wave.
      <br/>
      The output signal of the circular polarizer 407 is sent to a phase shifter 408 through an amplifier 410.
      <br/>
      By controlling the phase difference of the circular polarized waves of the dominant mode and the higher-order mode, the beam is scanned in the corresponding direction.
      <br/>
      The signals of the dominant mode and higher-order mode are sent to amplifiers 409 and 410, respectively.
      <br/>
      The output signal of the amplifier 409 is sent to a combining device.
      <br/>
      The output signal of the amplifier 410 is sent to the combining device 411 through a phase shifter 408.
      <br/>
      The amplifiers 409 and 410 adjust the amplitudes of the signals of the two modes so that the amplitude component of the radiation field in the beam direction of the dominant mode signal becomes the same as that of the higher-order mode signal.
      <br/>
      Thus, the directivity in the direction of the beam becomes strong, whereas the directivity in other directions becomes weak.
      <br/>
      Instead of the amplifiers, attenuators or combining devices which combine signals with a predetermined amplitude ratio may be used.
    </p>
    <p num="105">FIG. 27 is a circuit diagram showing the construction of a beam scanning antenna according to a fourth embodiment of the present invention.</p>
    <p num="106">
      This beam scanning antenna has four antenna elements 412, 413, 414, and 415, each of which has four feed points for a first component of the dominant mode, a second component of the dominant mode, a first component of the higher-order mode, and a second component of the higher-order mode.
      <br/>
      Feed points for the first component of the dominant mode are 416, 420, 424, and 428.
      <br/>
      Feed points for the second component of the dominant mode are 417, 421, 425, and 429.
      <br/>
      Feed points for the first component for the higher-order mode are 418, 422, 426, and 430.
      <br/>
      Feed points for the second component of the higher-order mode are 419, 423, 427, and 431.
    </p>
    <p num="107">
      Signals received from the dominant mode feed points 416 and 417 are sent to a circular polarizer 445.
      <br/>
      Signals received from the dominant mode feed points 420 and 421 are sent to a circular polarizer 433.
      <br/>
      Signals received from the dominant mode feed points 424 and 425 are sent to a circular polarizer 435.

      Signals received from the dominant mode feed points 428 and 429 are sent to a circular polarizer 437.

      Signals received from the higher-order mode feed points 418 and 419 are sent to a circular polarizer 432.
      <br/>
      Signals received from the higher-order mode feed points 422 and 423 are sent to a circular polarizer 434.
      <br/>
      Signals received from the higher-order mode feed points 426 and 427 are sent to a circular polarizer 436.
      <br/>
      Signals received from the higher-order mode feed points 430 and 431 are sent to a circular polarizer 438.
      <br/>
      The output signals of the circular polarizer 445, 433, 435, and 437 are sent to a feeding circuit 439.
      <br/>
      The output signals of the circular polarizer 432, 434, 436, and 438 are sent to a feeding circuit 440.
      <br/>
      Thus, the circular polarizer 439 combines the dominant mode signals received from the antenna elements, whereas the circular polarizer 440 combines the higher-order mode signals received from the antenna elements.
      <br/>
      The output signal of the feeding circuit 439 is sent to an amplifier 442.
      <br/>
      The output signal of the amplifier 442 is sent to a combining device 444.
      <br/>
      The output signal of the feeding circuit 440 is sent to an amplifier 443.
      <br/>
      The output signal of the amplifier 443 is sent to a phase shifter 441.
      <br/>
      The output signal of the phase shifter 441 is sent to the combining device 444.
      <br/>
      Thus, the combining device 444 combines the dominant mode signal and the higher-order mode signal with a phase difference designated by the phase shifter 441.
    </p>
    <p num="108">
      In the above-descried construction, the beam scanning antenna which receives (transmits) circularly polarized waves can be provided.
      <br/>
      When the transmission path difference of a radio wave transmitted or received by adjacent antenna elements in the direction of a predetermined rotation angle  PHI  to the boresight of the antenna is a multiple of the wave length and a proper phase difference between the dominant mode and higher-order mode is designated by the phase shifter 441, the antenna which scan the beam in the direction of the rotation angle  PHI  can be constructed.
      <br/>
      Thus, by arraying the antenna elements in this manner, the gain in the beam direction can be increased.
    </p>
    <p num="109">
      Since the phase shifter which sets the phase difference between the dominant mode and the higher-order mode is disposed downstream of the feeding circuit, the number of phase shifters and amplifiers can be remarkably reduced in comparison with the conventional antenna.
      <br/>
      Thus, the production steps of the beam scanning antenna can be reduced and thereby lowering the cost thereof.

      FIG. 28 is a top view showing the construction of a practical example of the beam scanning antenna according to the fourth embodiment of the present invention.

      In the above-described construction, since plane circuits and plane line patterns are used, a beam scanning antenna which electrically scan the beam in the direction of a predetermined rotation angle  PHI  can be constructed thinly and compactly.

      This beam scanning antenna is effective in particular for an antenna installed in a mobile station which communicates with a communication satellite.
      <br/>
      In addition, the beam scanning antenna according to the fourth embodiment can transmit and receive a circularly polarized wave.

      Since this beam scanning antenna does not require the adjustment of the direction of a polarized wave unlike with an antenna which uses a linearly polarized wave, it can be simply constructed.

      Moreover, after signals of orthogonal components of each mode have been combined by a feeding circuit, a circularly polarized wave may be generated by a circular polarizer.

      Next, an example of the antenna elements according to the fifth embodiment will be described.

      First, an antenna element for a circularly polarized wave will be described.

      The difference between the antenna element according to the fifth embodiment and the antenna element according to the fourth embodiment is in that two antenna members of the antenna element are excited in two higher-order modes.

      For example, one antenna member is excited in TM 21 mode, whereas the other antenna member is excited in TM 31 mode.
      <br/>
      Both the antenna members each radiate a circularly polarized wave with two feed points.
      <br/>
      The radiation directivity of these antenna members is constant in the direction of the direction angle as was descried earlier.
      <br/>
      FIG. 35 shows the relation between phase and rotation angle  PHI .
      <br/>
      In the figure, (a) represents the phase of the directivity of the circularly polarizing antenna member for the TM 21 mode and (b) represents the phase of the directivity of the circularly polarizing antenna member for the TM 31 mode.
      <br/>
      In this case, when  PHI =0, the phase of the radiation directivity of the first antenna member becomes the same as that of the second antenna member.
      <br/>
      In the direction of the rotation angle  PHI =0, the intensity of the radiation becomes strong.

    <p num="125">
      To scan the beam in any direction, the exciting phases of the two antenna members should be adjusted so that the phase of the radiation directivity in the direction of the first antenna member is equal to that of the second antenna member.

      To scan the beam in the directions of the direction angles  PHI  at every 60 degrees, a phase shifter which shifts the phase of the input signal for every 60 degrees is required.
      <br/>
      To scan the beam in the directions of the direction angles  PHI  at every 30 degrees, a phase shifter which shifts the phase of the input signal for every 30 degrees is required.

    <p num="129">
      As is clear from the figure, by selecting one of orthogonal components of the TM 31 mode, peaks of directivity appear at every 30 degrees.
      <br/>
      With respect to the TM 31 mode, by combining the two orthogonal components with the same phase or the reverse phase with a predetermined amplitude ratio in the direction of each rotation angle  PHI , peaks of directivity appear at every 30 degrees.
      <br/>
      By combining the two modes, the antenna can scan the beam in predetermined directions.

      In this example, the TM 21 mode is used instead of the TM 11 mode.

      This is because the combination of the TM 11 mode and the TM 31 mode causes two peaks of directivity appear in two directions.
    </p>
    <p num="130">
      Next, the construction of the feeding system of this antenna will be described.
      <br/>
      Signals of orthogonal components of the TM 21 mode radiated at the feed points 512 and 513 are sent to amplifiers 519 and 518, respectively.
      <br/>
      The amplifiers 519 and 518 amplify their input signals with the above-described amplitude ratio.
      <br/>
      The output signals of the amplifiers 519 and 518 are sent to phase shifters 517 and 516, respectively.
      <br/>
      The phase shifters 517 and 516 shift the phases of their input signals for every 180 degrees.
      <br/>
      Signals of orthogonal components of the TM 31 mode excited at the feed points 514 and 515 are sent to an RF switch 521 which selects one of these signals.
      <br/>
      The output signal of the RF switch 521 is sent to a combining device 522 which combines the TM 21 mode signal and the TM 31 mode signal.
      <br/>
      The basic operation of this antenna is the same as that of the second embodiment.
      <br/>
      The construction of the antenna for a vertically polarized waves (E THETA  component) is the same as that for a horizontally polarized wave (E PHI  components).
    </p>
    <p num="131">
      When an amplifier is disposed downstream of the RF switch 521 or the composing device 522, the overall transmission and/or reception signal can be amplified.
      <br/>
      When the antenna elements are arrayed, each orthogonal component of each mode requires an independent feeding circuit.
      <br/>
      By combining these signals amplified with a phase difference, the feeding system can be simply constructed.
    </p>
    <p num="132">
      In this construction, the antenna can scan the beam in the directions of the direction angles  PHI  at every 60 or 30 degrees for both a circularly polarized wave and a linearly polarized wave.
      <br/>
      This antenna can be constructed thinly and compactly.
      <br/>
      In addition, since the number of phase shifters and amplifiers of this antenna can be reduced, the antenna elements can be arrayed with simple production steps at low cost.
      <br/>
      Thus, this antenna is very useful for an antenna installed in a mobile station such as a car.

    <p num="133">Next, typical examples of the antenna element pitch of each antenna disposition will be described.</p>
    <p num="134">
      In the case of square disposition, when the antenna element pitch a is set so that �a * sin  THETA � nearly becomes a multiple of the wave length of the radio waves, the antenna can scan the beam in the directions of the direction angles  PHI  =0 degree,  +- 90 degrees, and 180 degrees on the plane tilted for the angle  THETA  to the boresight of the antenna by the same phase feeding.
      <br/>
      In addition, when the antenna element pitch a is set so that �(21/2 /2) * a * sin  THETA � nearly becomes a multiple of the wave length of the radio waves, the antenna can scan the beam in the directions of the direction angles  PHI  = +- 45 degrees and  +- 135 degrees on the plane tilted for the angle  THETA  to the boresight of the antenna by the same phase feeding.

      In the case of triangular disposition, when the antenna element pitch b is set so that �(1/2) * b * sin  THETA � nearly becomes a multiple of the wave length of the radio waves, the antenna can scan the beam in the directions of the direction angles  PHI =0 degree,  +- 60 degrees,  +- 120 degrees, and 180 degrees on the plane tilted for the angle  THETA  to the boresight of the antenna by the same phase feeding.
      <br/>
      In addition, when the antenna element pitch b is set so that �(31/2 /2) * b * sin  THETA � nearly becomes a multiple of the wave length of the radio waves, the antenna can scan the beam in the directions of the direction angles  PHI = +- 30 degrees,  +- 90 degrees, and  +- 160 degrees on the plane tilted for the angle  THETA  to the boresight of the antenna by the same phase feeding.

    <p num="136">
      Furthermore, when the transmission path difference of radio waves transmitted or received by adjacent antenna elements nearly becomes a multiple of the wave length of the radio waves in the direction of a predetermined rotation angle  PHI , the antenna can scan the beam on the plane tilted for angle  THETA  to the boresight of the antenna.

      Thus, the antenna can scan the beam in the directions of the direction angles  PHI  at intervals of more smaller degrees.

    <p num="137">By the combination of the antenna in the square disposition and the antenna in the triangular disposition, the antenna can scan the beam in the directions of the direction angles  PHI  at intervals of more smaller degrees.</p>

      By using a means which shifts the phase of a part of antenna elements in a predetermined rotation angle  PHI , the antenna element pitch may be decreased.

      <br/>
      In addition, by reversing the phases of a part of the antenna elements at a predetermined direction angle, the antenna can scan the beam in the directions of the direction angles  PHI =0 degree,  +- 45 degrees,  +- 90 degrees,  +- 135 degrees, and 180 degrees on the plane tilted for the angle  THETA  to the boresight by using a simple feeding system.
      <br/>
      In this case, the size of the entire antenna can be reduced.
    </p>
    <p num="139">
      In the beam scanning antenna according to the fifth embodiment, the antenna element pitch is relatively large.
      <br/>
      With this feature, when a plurality of the beam scanning antennas according to the present invention are disposed, the antennas can scan their beams in the directions at intervals of more smaller degrees.
      <br/>
      Next, this antenna system will be described as a sixth embodiment.
    </p>
    <p num="140">
      FIG. 38 is a top view showing a beam scanning antenna system according to the sixth embodiment of the present invention.
      <br/>
      The antenna system is constructed of a first beam scanning antenna 543 and a second beam scanning antenna 544.
      <br/>
      The first beam scanning antenna 543 is constructed of antenna elements 530 to 535.
      <br/>
      The second beam scanning antenna 544 is constructed of antenna elements 536 to 541.
      <br/>
      These beam scanning antennas 543 and 544 share a part of the region of the antenna elements.
      <br/>
      The antenna elements of the beam scanning antennas 543 and 544 are disposed in a triangular shape.
      <br/>
      Each antenna element of these beam scanning antennas 543 and 544 can scan the beam in the directions of the direction angles  PHI  at every 30 degrees.
      <br/>
      The practical construction of the antenna elements of the sixth embodiment is the same as that of the fifth embodiment.
    </p>
    <p num="141">
      The first beam scanning antenna 543 is disposed so that it can scan the beam in the directions of the direction angles  PHI =0 degree,  +- 30 degrees,  +- 60 degrees,  +- 90 degrees,  +- 120 degrees,  +- 150 degrees, and 180 degrees.
      <br/>
      On the other hand, the second beam scanning antenna 544 is disposed so that it can scan the beam in the directions of the direction angles  PHI = +- 15 degrees,  +- 45 degrees,  +- 75 degrees,  +- 105 degrees,  +- 135 degrees, and  +- 165 degrees.
      <br/>
      Thus, when the direction angles (of the two beam scanning antennas 543 and 544 are properly selected, the antenna system can substantially scan the beam in the directions of the direction angles  PHI  at every  +- 15 degrees.
      <br/>
      FIG. 39 is a circuit diagram showing the construction of an example of a feeding system according to the sixth embodiment.
      <br/>
      In this example, circularly polarized waves are received.
      <br/>
      In the antenna elements 530 to 541, feed points 550, 552, 554, 556, 558, 560, 563, 565, 567, 569, 571, and 573 output signals of one mode.
      <br/>
      In addition, feed points 551, 553, 555, 557, 559, 561, 564, 566, 568, 570, 572, and 574 output signals of the other mode.
      <br/>
      By combining these signals of the two modes with a proper amplitude ratio and a proper phase difference, the antenna system can scan the beam in the directions of the direction angles  PHI  on the plane tilted for the angle  THETA  to the boresight.
      <br/>
      This embodiment can be accomplished regardless of the antenna type, feeding method, and circularly polarized wave generating method.
      <br/>
      In this construction, each beam scanning antenna has an independent feeding system.
      <br/>
      The output signals of the first mode of the first beam scanning antenna 543 are sent to a feeding circuit 575 which combines these signals.
      <br/>
      The output signals of the second mode of the first beam scanning antenna 543 are sent to a feeding circuit 576 which combines these signals.
      <br/>
      The output signals of the first mode of the second beam scanning antenna 544 are sent to a feeding circuit 577 which combines these signals.
      <br/>
      The output signals of the second mode of the second beam scanning antenna 544 are sent to a feeding circuit 578 which combines these signals.
      <br/>
      The output signal of the feeding circuit 575 is sent to an amplifier 581.
      <br/>
      The output signal of the amplifier 581 is sent to a phase shifter 579.
      <br/>
      The output signal of the phase shifter 579 is sent to a combining device 585.
      <br/>
      The output signal of the feeding circuit 576 is sent to an amplifier 582.
      <br/>
      The output signal of the amplifier 582 is sent to the combining device 585.
      <br/>
      The combining device 585 combines the output signals of the phase shifter 579 and the amplifier 582.
      <br/>
      The output signal of the combining device 585 is sent to an RF switch 587.
      <br/>
      The output signal of the feeding circuit 577 is sent to an amplifier 583.
      <br/>
      The output signal of the amplifier 583 is sent to a phase shifter 580.
      <br/>
      The output signal of the phase shifter 580 is sent to a combining device 586.
      <br/>
      The output signal of the feeding circuit 578 is sent to an amplifier 584.
      <br/>
      The output signal of the amplifier 584 is sent to the combining device 586.
      <br/>
      The output signal of the combining device 586 is sent to the RF switch 587 which selects one of the two signals received from the combining devices 585 and 586 corresponding to the rotation angle  PHI  of the beam.
      <br/>
      Thus, the antenna system can scan the beam in the directions of the direction angles  PHI  at every 15 degrees.
    </p>
    <p num="142">
      In the above-described construction, the antenna system can scan the beam in the directions of the rotation angle  PHI  at intervals of smaller degrees.
      <br/>
      In the sixth embodiment, an example of an antenna system where antenna elements are disposed in a triangular shape and which scan the beam in the directions of the direction angles  PHI  at intervals of 15 degrees was described.
      <br/>
      However, when a number of beam scanning antennas are disposed in the same area and these beam scanning antennas are selected by an RF switch, a beam scanning antenna system which scans the beam in the directions of the direction angles at intervals of much smaller degrees can be constructed without an increase of the overall size thereof.
    </p>
    <p num="143">
      In addition to the RF switch which selects one of two beam scanning antennas, when a means which excites the beam scanning antennas in the same phase is provided, the antenna system can have radiation directivity so that the composite beam thereof is scanned at the center of two directions in which the two beam scanning antennas scan their beams.
      <br/>
      Thus, in this case, the intervals of degrees of the direction angles  PHI  can be halved.
      <br/>
      This construction can apply to an antenna system where antenna elements are disposed in a square shape.
    </p>
    <p num="144">
      Thus, the intervals of degrees of the direction angles of the beam can be decreased.
      <br/>
      This antenna system is effectively used for a beam scanning antenna system with a gain of 30 dB or more and a very small beam width as in an antenna which receives signals from satellites.
      <br/>
      In addition, since the antenna system can be constructed lightly and compactly, it can be used for an antenna installed in a mobile station.
    </p>
    <p num="145">Next, another construction of an antenna element will be described.</p>
    <p num="146">
      In the above-mentioned embodiments, as antenna elements, microstrip antenna members were used.
      <br/>
      The radiation directivity was combined by different two modes.
      <br/>
      Thus, the beam was scanned in the directions of predetermined direction angles.
      <br/>
      However, even if the antenna elements are modified in the following manner, the effects of the present invention are not lost.
      <br/>
      For example, even if the antenna elements are constructed by using another antenna type, feeding method, circular polarizing method, and/or line pattern method, the effects of the present invention are not changed.
    </p>
    <p num="147">
      In addition, when antenna elements which combine radiation directivity with two different modes is used, another combination of modes not mentioned in the above-described embodiments may be used.
      <br/>
      For example, when signals of antenna elements are combined with TMmn mode and TMpq mode which are modes for circular microstrip antenna members and ring microstrip antenna members, if signals of two orthogonal modes are combined with a proper amplitude ratio and a proper phase difference, the beam can be scanned in the direction of any direction angle regardless of a circularly polarized wave and a linearly polarized wave.
    </p>
    <p num="148">
      In particular, when .vertline.m-p.vertline.=1, since a peak of radiation directivity combined with the two modes appears in one direction.
      <br/>
      Thus, good sidelobe characteristics can be obtained.
      <br/>
      The lower the values of m, n, p, and q, the more the Q value of resonance decreases.
      <br/>
      Thus, the frequency band can be widened.
      <br/>
      On the other hand, the more the values of m and p increase, the more the angle  THETA  tilted to the boresight increases.
      <br/>
      The modes can be optimally selected corresponding to design values such as the frequency band and the angle  THETA  to the boresight.
    </p>
    <p num="149">
      Moreover, with three or more different modes, antenna elements may be constructed.
      <br/>
      For example, with TM 11 mode, TM 21 mode, and TM 31 mode which are modes for circular microstrip antenna members or ring microstrip antenna members, the radiation directivity of antenna elements can be combined.
      <br/>
      In this construction, sidelobe levels of other than beam direction can be reduced in comparison with the construction using two modes.
      <br/>
      Thus, when three or more different modes are used, injection of disturbing radio waves can be effectively prevented.
      <br/>
      In the case that the antenna elements with three or more different modes are arrayed, when a feeding system is provided for each mode and signals of all the modes are combined with a predetermined amplitude ratio and a predetermined phase difference, the number of phase shifters and amplifiers can be minimized.
      <br/>
      Thus, the beam scanning antenna system can be constructed at low cost.
    </p>
    <p num="150">
      In the above-mentioned embodiments, antenna members which are excited with two modes were formed on the same plane.

      <br/>
      The MMIC module 734 sets a predetermined amplitude and phase so as to scan the beam in the corresponding direction.

      In the above-described construction, the beam scanning antenna which scans the beam in the directions of a plurality of direction angles  PHI  on the plane tilted for the angle  THETA  to the boresight can be formed.
      <br/>
      For example, when the beam is scanned in the directions of the direction angles  PHI  at intervals of 45 degrees, the sub array pitch a is set so that both �a * sin  THETA � and �(21/2 /2) * a * sin  THETA � become a multiple of the wave length of the radio waves.
      <br/>
      In addition, the phase of each phase shifter is is set so that the corresponding sub array can scan the beam in the directions of the direction angles  PHI  at every 45 degrees.
      <br/>
      In this embodiment, since each phase shifter only shifts the phase of the input signal in at most five levels, its construction is simple.
      <br/>
      The phase of each phase shifter depends on the antenna element pitch c and the angle  THETA  to the antenna's boresight.
    </p>
    <p num="174">
      According to the eighth embodiment of the present invention, the number of phase shifters can be reduced.
      <br/>
      Thus, the beam scanning antenna can be produced with simple steps and at low cost.
      <br/>
      In addition, the antenna elements can be also simply constructed of any conventional antenna member and method.
      <br/>
      The antenna elements of the beam scanning antenna according to this embodiment can be used for other purposes (for example, an antenna with a wide band, an antenna with a high gain, an antenna for multi-types of polarized waves, a receiving/transmitting antenna, an antenna with high isolation of polarized waves and of transmission and reception) with high degree of freedom.
      <br/>
      Since the beam scanning antenna according to the eighth embodiment uses plane circuits and lines, it can be constructed thinly and compactly.
      <br/>
      Thus, this antenna is effectively used for an antenna installed in a mobile station which communicates with communication satellites.
    </p>
    <p num="175">According to the eighth embodiment, when the construction of each sub array is the same, the antenna element pitch a is set so that the optical path difference of radio waves received or transmitted by adjacent antenna elements becomes a multiple of the wave length of the radio waves.</p>
    <p num="176">
      In the eighth embodiment, regardless of whether the antenna elements are disposed on a plane or any curved surface such as a spherical surface, the same effects can be obtained.
      <br/>
      In addition, according to this embodiment, a mechanical driving system which precisely adjusts the beam direction may be added to the beam scanning antenna so as to more precisely control the beam direction.
      <br/>
      In this case, since the mechanical driving range accords with the minimum electrical scanning angle, the mechanism can be formed in a relatively simple construction.
    </p>
    <p num="177">
      In the eighth embodiment of the present invention, it is not necessary to form all the antenna elements in the same construction.
      <br/>
      For example, even if a part of antenna elements scan beams in the TM 11 mode and TM 21 mode and the remaining antenna elements scan beams in the TM 31 mode and TM 21 mode, the effects of the present invention are not lost at all.
      <br/>
      In this case, sidelobe levels in other than the beam direction can be lowered, thereby preventing disturbing waves from being injected into the antenna.
    </p>
    <p num="178">
      In addition, when a plurality of beam scanning antennas according to this embodiment are disposed as a system in such a manner that they are tiled for the angle  THETA  to their boresight, the beam can be scanned in the direction of the angle  THETA  by switching among these antennas with an RF switch or the like.
      <br/>
      Since a mobile station is often running on a slop or the like, the antenna installed therein is correspondingly tilted.
      <br/>
      Thus, the adjustment function of the elevation angle  THETA  of the beam is very useful.
    </p>
    <p num="179">
      In the eighth embodiment of the present invention, when signals of two modes are combined, if the amplitude ratios of these signals are varied by a variable amplifier or a variable attenuator, the slop angle  THETA  to the boresight can be precisely adjusted.
      <br/>
      As with the above-described example, this effect is remarkably useful for an antenna installed in a mobile station.
    </p>
    <p num="180">
      In this embodiment, the operation which causes the antenna to scan the beam in the direction of the boresight can be easily performed by slightly modifying the construction thereof.
      <br/>
      For example, in the case that antenna elements have a dominant mode and a higher-order mode, when signals of the higher-order mode are suppressed by an RF switch or the like, the antenna can scan the beam in the forward direction (namely,  THETA =0).
      <br/>
      In the case that sub arrays are used, when the phases of all antenna elements are matched, the antenna can scan the beam in the forward direction.
      <br/>
      These antennas can be effectively used for a mono-pulse sensor or a tracking antenna.

      FIG. 56 is a top view showing a beam scanning antenna according to the tenth embodiment of the present invention.
      <br/>
      The construction of the beam scanning antenna according to this embodiment is basically the same as that according to the ninth embodiment.
      <br/>
      In the tenth embodiment, the beam scanning antenna has nine antenna elements which are disposed in a square shape.
      <br/>
      The nine antenna elements are formed of circular microstrip antenna members 831 to 839 and ring microstrip antenna members 841 to 849.
      <br/>
      As with the beam scanning antenna according to the ninth embodiment, signals of two different exciting modes are combined so as to cause each antenna element to scan the beam in a predetermined direction.
      <br/>
      The difference between the beam scanning antennas according to the ninth and tenth embodiment is the construction of the beam forming circuits.
      <br/>
      Next, the beam forming circuit according to the tenth embodiment will be described.
    </p>
    <p num="194">
      FIG. 57 is a circuit diagram showing the beam forming circuit of the beam scanning antenna according to the tenth embodiment of the present invention.
      <br/>
      The circular microstrip antenna members 831 to 839 are electrically connected to one-bit phase shifters 851 to 859, respectively.
      <br/>
      The ring microstrip antennas 841 to 849 are electrically connected to one-bit phase shifters 861 to 869, respectively.
      <br/>
      These phase sifters shift the phases of the signals of the antenna elements at every 180 degrees.
      <br/>
      When the antenna elements are arrayed, these phase shifters cause the beam to be roughly scanned.
      <br/>
      Thus, for example, the degrees of the phase which is shifted by the phase shifter 851 is the same as those by the phase shifter 861.
      <br/>
      Since these phase shifters are controlled in the same manner, the control circuit and the power supply circuit can be shared with these phase shifters.
      <br/>
      In addition, the one-bit phase shifters can be very simply constructed.
    </p>
    <p num="195">
      The output signals of the phase shifters 861 to 869 are sent to a feeding circuit 871 which combines these signals.
      <br/>
      Thus, the feeding circuit 871 combines the signals of the mode received from the ring microstrip antenna members.
      <br/>
      On the other hand, the output signals of the phase shifters 851 to 859 are sent to a combining device 872 which combines these signals.
      <br/>
      Thus, the feeding circuit 872 combines the signals of the mode received from the circular microstrip antenna members.
      <br/>
      The output signal of the feeding circuit 871 is sent to an amplifier 873 which amplifies the signal.
      <br/>
      The output signal of the amplifier 873 is sent to a phase shifter 875 which shifts the phase of the input signal for predetermined degrees.
      <br/>
      The output signal of the phase shifter 875 is sent to a combining device 877.
      <br/>
      The output signal of the feeding circuit 872 is sent to an amplifier 874 which amplifies the signal.
      <br/>
      The output signal of the amplifier 874 is sent to a phase shifter 876 which shifts the phase of the input signal for predetermined degrees.
      <br/>
      Thus, the phase shifters 875 and 876 control the beam direction of each antenna element.
      <br/>
      The output signal of the phase shifter 876 is sent to a combining device 877 which combines the signals received from the phase shifters 875 and 876.
      <br/>
      Thus, the beam scanning antenna can scan the beam in the predetermined direction.
    </p>
    <p num="196">
      In the construction shown in FIG. 57, the phase of each mode can be shifted.

      FIG. 58 shows an example of beam scanning characteristics in the case that a beam is scanned in the direction of the rotation angle  PHI .

      The connection method of low-bit variable phase shifters and high-bit variable phase shifters differ between the tenth embodiment and the ninth embodiment.

      Although the number of phase shifters used in the tenth embodiment is slightly larger than that of the ninth embodiment, most of the phase shifters used in the tenth embodiment are low-bit phase shifters.
      <br/>
      Thus, the construction of the beam forming circuit according to the tenth embodiment is much simpler than that according to the ninth embodiment.
      <br/>
      In addition, since the low-bit phase shifters are controlled in the same manner, one control circuit can be shared therewith.

      Thus, the construction of the beam forming circuit can be simplified.

    <p num="200">Since the beam forming circuit can be simply constructed, the production steps of the beam scanning antenna can be simplified, thereby remarkably decreasing the production cost thereof.</p>

      In the receiving operation, received signals are amplified by low-noise amplifiers so as to prevent C/N ratio from degrading due to power loss by phase shifters.

      However, in the construction of the tenth embodiment, since the phase shifters on the first stage are low-bit type and less consume power, these low-noise amplifiers can be omitted.
      <br/>
      Low-noise amplifiers are required only for compensating the deterioration of C/N ratio by variable phase shifters disposed on the last stage.
      <br/>
      The number of low-noise amplifiers required is at most two.

      Thus, the construction of the beam forming circuit can be further simplified.

      FIG. 59 is a top view showing a beam scanning antenna according the eleventh embodiment of the present invention.
      <br/>
      The beam scanning antenna has seven sub arrays 891 to 897 which are disposed in a triangular shape.
      <br/>
      Each sub array has four antenna elements (namely, circular microstrip antenna members).
      <br/>
      The antenna elements, antenna element pitch, antenna element disposition, and the like of each sub array are the same.
      <br/>
      The basic operation of the beam scanning antenna according to the eleventh embodiment is the same as those according to the ninth and tenth embodiments.
      <br/>
      In the ninth and tenth embodiments, each antenna element scans the beam.
      <br/>
      In the eleventh embodiment, each sub array scans the beam.
      <br/>
      As with the beam scanning antennas according to the ninth and tenth embodiments, the phases of signals are adjusted by low-bit phase shifters for each sub array.
      <br/>
      Thus, in the eleventh embodiment, with a simple beam forming circuit, excellent beam scanning characteristics can be obtained.
    </p>
    <p num="204">
      FIG. 60 is a circuit diagram showing a beam forming circuit of the beam scanning antenna according to the eleventh embodiment of the present invention.
      <br/>
      As with the tenth embodiment, in the eleventh embodiment, low-bit phase shifters which control the phases of signals for each sub array are disposed on the first stage.
      <br/>
      In addition, high-bit phase sifters which precisely control the phases of signals of the antenna elements are disposed on the last stage.
    </p>
    <p num="205">
      The output signals of antenna elements 8101 to 8128 are sent to one-bit phase shifters 8131 to 8158, respectively.
      <br/>
      These phase shifters 8131 to 8158 shift the phases of the signals of each sub array for the same degrees (0 degree or 180 degrees).
      <br/>
      Thus, the four one-bit phase shifters for each sub array are controlled in the same manner.
      <br/>
      Thus, one control circuit is shared with these phase shifters.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the construction of the phase shifters can be simplified.
      <br/>
      The output signals of the antenna elements in the corresponding positions of the sub arrays are sent to feeding circuits 8161, 8162, 8163, and 8164 which combine these signals.
      <br/>
      For example, the output signals of the antenna elements 8101, 8105, 8109, 8103, 8117, 8121, and 8125 are sent to the feeding circuit 8161.
      <br/>
      The output signals of the feeding circuits 8161, 8162, 8163, and 8164 are sent to low-noise amplifiers 8165, 8166, 8167, and 8168, respectively.
      <br/>
      The low-noise amplifiers 8165, 8166, 8167, and 8168 amplify the input signals.
      <br/>
      The output signals of the amplifiers 8165, 8166, 8167, and 8168 are sent to high-bit variable phase shifters 8169, 8170, 8171, and 8172, respectively.
      <br/>
      The high-bit variable phase shifters 8169, 8170, 8171, and 8172 shift the phases of the received signals for predetermined degrees.
      <br/>
      The angles of the phases which are shifted by the phase shifters 8169, 8170, 8171, and 8172 are angles at which the beam of each sub array is scanned.
      <br/>
      The output signals of the phase shifters 8169, 8170, 8171, and 8172 are sent to a combining device 8173 which combines these signals.
      <br/>
      Thus, the received output of the beam scanning antenna is obtained.
      <br/>
      FIG. 61 is a graph showing an example of beam scanning characteristics where a beam is scanned in the direction of the rotation angle  PHI .
      <br/>
      As is clear from this figure, since the phases of the signals of each sub array are adjusted at every 180 degrees by the one-bit phase shifters, a good scanning gain can be obtained.
    </p>
    <p num="206">
      The beam scanning antenna according to the eleventh embodiment can provide the same effects as those according to the ninth and tenth embodiments do.
      <br/>
      In addition, the beam scanning antenna according to the eleventh embodiment provides the following effects.
    </p>
    <p num="207">
      A beam scanning antenna having sub arrays each of which scans the beam corresponding to the composition of a plurality of modes has high degree of freedom in design.
      <br/>
      In this construction, a high gain can be obtained.
      <br/>
      In addition, since the beam width of each antenna element can be narrowed, the occurrence of grating lobes can be suppressed.
      <br/>
      Thus, the array gain can be increased.
    </p>
    <p num="208">
      Most of phase shifters used in this embodiment are one-bit phase shifters.
      <br/>
      In addition, one control circuit and one power supply circuit can be shared with the one-bit phase shifters which are disposed on the first stage.
      <br/>
      Thus, the construction of the beam forming circuit can be very simplified.
    </p>
    <p num="209">
      Since the beam direction of each sub array is varied, the beam can be scanned in the direction of the elevation angle  THETA  as well as in the direction of the rotation angle  PHI .
      <br/>
      When a mobile station which communicates with a communication satellite or a broadcasting satellite is running on a slope, the antenna installed therein is correspondingly tilted.
      <br/>
      In this case, according to this embodiment, the beam of the antenna can be scanned in the direction of the satellite.
      <br/>
      When the mobile station communicates with a stationary satellite, the elevation angle of the beam varies corresponding to the latitude of the position at which the antenna is installed.
      <br/>
      However, according to the eleventh embodiment, the beam scanning antenna can be use anywhere on the earth.
      <br/>
      Thus, from view points of production steps and cost, this antenna is very convenient.
      <br/>
      In addition to the communication with the stationary satellite, the beam scanning antenna according to this embodiment can be used for communications with an orbiting satellite which orbits around the earth.
    </p>
    <p num="210">
      In the above-mentioned ninth to eleventh embodiments, one-bit phase shifters were used as low-bit phase shifters.
      <br/>
      However, instead of the one-bit phase shifters, even if two-bit phase shifters are used, as an effect of the present invention, the beam forming circuit can be simply constructed.
      <br/>
      In this case, the phases of signals for each array can be more precisely set than those of the above-described ninth to eleventh embodiments.
      <br/>
      Thus, beam scanning characteristics and gain can be improved.

      FIG. 62 is a top view showing an array antenna according to a twelfth embodiment of the present invention.
      <br/>
      FIG. 63 gives the relation between orthogonal coordinates system (x, y, z) and polar coordinates system (r,  THETA ,  PHI ) with respect to an antenna.
    </p>
    <p num="212">
      The array antenna according to the twelfth embodiment of the present invention, shown in FIG. 62, has antenna elements 901 to 908 which are disposed on a periphery of a circle with a radius a. The position of each antenna element is represented position angle  PSI  as well as the radius a. The position angle  PSI  which represents the position of a i-th antenna element is  PSI i, as shown in FIG. 62. The antenna elements are disposed symmetrically with respect to the center point of the circle.
      <br/>
      In this embodiment, the antenna elements are circular microstrip antenna members.
    </p>
    <p num="213">
      In this embodiment, electromagnetic coupling feeding method is used.
      <br/>
      Below the antenna elements 901 to 908, feeding circuits 911 to 918 are disposed, respectively.
      <br/>
      The feeding circuits 911 to 918 are made of a microstrip line pattern.
      <br/>
      In this embodiment, the feeding circuits 911 to 918 are excited by circular polarized waves.
      <br/>
      Each feeding circuit has a T branch which causes the phases of signals at two orthogonal feed points to be shifted for 90 degrees.
      <br/>
      The signals of the feeding circuits 911 to 918 are supplied from feed points 931 to 938, respectively.
      <br/>
      Each feeding point is electrically connected to a beam forming circuit.
      <br/>
      In the receiving operation, the beam forming circuit combines signals received from the antenna elements.
      <br/>
      In the transmitting operation, the beam forming circuit distributes signals to the antenna elements.
    </p>
    <p num="214">
      FIG. 64 is a circuit diagram showing the beam forming circuit of the array antenna according to the twelfth embodiment.
      <br/>
      The phases of signals of the antenna elements 901 to 908 are shifted by phase shifters or phase shifting means 941 to 948, respectively.
      <br/>
      The phase shifting means is formed of a feed line with different line length.
      <br/>
      The phase of the signal of the i-th antenna element is denoted by  ALPHA i. In the case of the transmitting operation, a signal of each antenna element is sent to a distributer.
      <br/>
      In the case of the receiving operation, a signal of each antenna element is sent to a combining device 909.
      <br/>
      The beam forming circuit 910 has the distributor (or combining device) and the phase shifters (or phase shifting means).
    </p>
    <p num="215">
      A feature of the array antenna according to the twelfth embodiment is in that the radiation field of each antenna element has a phase difference m PSI i where the phase  ALPHA i of the signal of each antenna element is equal to position angle  PSI i times m (where m is any positive integer except for 0).
      <br/>
      Next, the operation of the array antenna according to the twelfth embodiment will be described.
    </p>
    <p num="216">
      When the number of antenna elements is 2 m or more, the radiation field in the boresight direction (z axis) of each antenna element is offset each other.
      <br/>
      Thus, a conical beam is formed where the composite radiation field in the boresight direction of the array antenna becomes null.
      <br/>
      This can be mathematically explained by the following equations.
    </p>
    <p num="217">The radiation field of a circularly polarized wave in a dominant mode (TM11 mode) of a microstrip antenna member is given by the following equations.</p>
    <p num="218">
      ER =AR ( THETA ) exp ( +- j PHI )  (23)
      <br/>
      EL =AL ( THETA ) exp ( +- j PHI )  (24)
    </p>
    <p num="219">
      where ER and EL represent right- and left-hand cercularly polarized wave components, respectively.
      <br/>
      The + sign and - sign of the function j PHI  represent right-hand circular polarization excitation and left-hand circular polarization excitation of the microstrip antenna member, respectively.
      <br/>
      Thus, the sign of the function j PHI  depends on the exciting direction of the circularly polarized wave.
    </p>
    <p num="220">
      Now, consider that a right-hand circular polarized wave is excited and the left-circularly polarized wave component is null.
      <br/>
      The composite radiation directivity of the array antenna shown in FIG. 62 can be given by the following equation.  (Equation image '4' not included in text)
    </p>
    <p num="221">
      where k is the wave number (2 PI / LAMBDA ).
      <br/>
      When an infinitude of antenna elements are disposed on the same periphery of a circle, the equation (25) can be expressed by the equation (26).  (Equation image '5' not included in text)
    </p>
    <p num="222">
      As is clear from the equation (26), when m is not equal to 0, the composite radiation field in the boresight direction ( THETA =0) becomes null, thereby forming a conical beam.
      <br/>
      In addition, the direction of maximum radiation is given by the following equation.  (Equation image '6' not included in text)
    </p>
    <p num="223">thus,  (Equation image '7' not included in text)</p>
    <p num="224">
      In other words, to form a conical beam antenna with a peak of the radiation directivity in the direction of the angle  THETA , the radius a of the antenna should be set so that the equations (27) and (28) are satisfied.
      <br/>
      In particular, when the antenna elements do not have directivity (A ( THETA )=constant), the radiation directivity has a peak in the direction of the angle  THETA  which satisfies the following equation.  (Equation image '8' not included in text)
    </p>
    <p num="225">
      When the number of antenna elements disposed on a periphery of a circle is more than around eight and the phase difference of the radiation field between adjacent antenna elements is 90 degrees or less, a conical beam which is similar to the case of an infinitude of antenna elements is radiated.
      <br/>
      In the above-mentioned equations, Jm is a m-th order Bessel function.
      <br/>
      There are a plurality of zero points as the result of the differentiation of the Bessel function which satisfies the equation (28).
      <br/>
      From these, �ka sin  THETA � should be minimized as in the following.
    </p>
    <p num="226">
      when m= +- 1, ka * sin  THETA =1.841
      <br/>
      when m= +- 2, ka * sin  THETA =3.054
      <br/>
      when m= +- 3, ka * sin  THETA =4.201
      <br/>
      when m= +- 4, ka * sin  THETA =5.317
      <br/>
      when m= +- 5, ka * sin  THETA =6.416
    </p>
    <p num="227">
      When a zero point where �ka * sin  THETA � is not minimum is selected, a another maximal point in radiation intensity takes place at a smaller angle e than the desired angle  THETA .
      <br/>
      This also applies to the equation (27).
      <br/>
      To cause a peak of radiation directivity to take place only in a desired direction, the minimum radius a which satisfies the equation (27) should be set.

      Next, the construction of a practical example of the twelfth embodiment of the present invention will be described.

      However, the transmitting operation is performed by the same construction.

      FIG. 65 is a sectional view showing the array antenna according to the twelfth embodiment of the present invention.
      <br/>
      This figure is a sectional view taken along x-z plane of FIG. 62. This array antenna is formed of four dielectric substrates 920, 921, 922, and 923 being layered.
      <br/>
      On the upper surface of the dielectric substrate 920, which is the uppermost layer, circular microstrip antenna members 903 and 907 which are made of a conductor film are formed.
      <br/>
      On the upper surface of the dielectric substrate 921, feeding circuits 913 and 917 which receive signals of circularly polarized waves from the circular microstrip antenna portions are formed.
      <br/>
      These feeding circuits 913 and 917 are made of a conductor film.
      <br/>
      The dielectric substrates 922 and 923 form a tri-plate line pattern.
      <br/>
      On the upper surface of the tri-plate line pattern, a beam forming circuit 952 is formed.
      <br/>
      On the upper surface of the dielectric substrate 922, an outer conductor 950 of the tri-plate line pattern is formed.
      <br/>
      The outer conductor 950 is made of a conductor film.
      <br/>
      On the lower surface of the dielectric substrate 923, an outer conductor 951 of the tri-plate line pattern is formed.
      <br/>
      The outer conductor 951 is made of a conductor film.
      <br/>
      The output signal of the beam forming circuit is sent from an output point 969 to a connector 960 through a through-hole of the substrates.
    </p>
    <p num="230">
      The microstrip antenna members and line pattern according to this twelfth embodiment can be easily formed by etching process or the like.
      <br/>
      The dielectric substrates may be layered by fasteners such as machine screws or dielectric adhesive films.
    </p>
    <p num="231">
      FIG. 66 is a circuit pattern of the beam forming circuit 952 formed on the upper surface of the dielectric substrate 922.
      <br/>
      Output points 931 to 938 of the feeding circuit of the antenna elements are electrically connected to input points 961 to 968 of the beam forming circuit through vertical lines, respectively.
      <br/>
      Signals of the input points are combined by power combining devices 971 to 977 each of which is formed of a T branch.
      <br/>
      The composite output signal is sent from an output point 969 to an outer connector 960.
      <br/>
      In the beam forming circuit 952, to shift the phase of the signal received from each antenna element for  ALPHA i =m PSI i (where m is any positive integer except for 0), the line length is varied corresponding to the wave length of the radio wave.
      <br/>
      Thus, the above-described conical beam is formed.
    </p>
    <p num="232">In this construction, the following effects can be obtained.</p>
    <p num="233">
      The antenna which forms a conical beam can be thinly constructed.
      <br/>
      When an antenna is installed in a mobile station, the volume and weight thereof should be as small as possible.
      <br/>
      Thus, the array antenna according the twelfth embodiment of the present invention is effectively used for an antenna installed in a mobile station.
    </p>
    <p num="234">
      In addition, the array antenna according to this embodiment is effectively used for an antenna which is installed at a relatively high latitude region as in Japan and which receives and transmits signals from and to communication satellites and broadcasting satellites.
      <br/>
      Moreover, when this antenna is used for an antenna installed in a mobile station, even if the mobile station is running and thereby the orientation of the antenna varies time by time, the antenna can properly transmit and receive signals to and from such satellites.
    </p>
    <p num="235">
      Furthermore, according to the twelfth embodiment, since the degree of freedom in design is high, a practical antenna can be conveniently formed.
      <br/>
      For example, by applying the equations (27) and (28), an array antenna can be optimally designed so as to obtain the maximum radiation in a desired direction.
      <br/>
      On the other hand, in a conventional antenna using a higher-order mode, it is necessary to decide a resonance mode where the maximum radiation takes place in a desired direction.
      <br/>
      Moreover, in the conventional array antennas, by a very limited means which adjusts the permittivity of the substrates, the maximum radiation was obtained.
      <br/>
      However, the adjustable range was very narrow.
      <br/>
      Thus, the degree of freedom in design of the array antenna according to the twelfth embodiment is much higher than that of the conventional array antenna.
    </p>
    <p num="236">
      In addition, as described above, the increase of the gain of the array antenna can be easily designed.
      <br/>
      In this case, the the radius a should be increased so as to optimize the value of m.
    </p>
    <p num="237">
      Moreover, in the conventional antenna using a higher-order mode which forms a conical beam, the value of Q increases, thereby narrowing the frequency band.
      <br/>
      However, according to the twelfth embodiment, since antenna members for the dominant mode can be used, the frequency band can be widened.
    </p>
    <p num="238">Even if the array antenna according to the twelfth embodiment of the present invention is modified as follows, the same effects as those of this embodiment can be obtained.</p>
    <p num="239">
      In the twelfth embodiment, circular microstrip antenna members were used as antenna elements.
      <br/>
      However, even if other antenna elements such as horn antenna members, spiral antenna members, helical antenna members, cross dipole antenna members, and slot antenna members are used, the same effects as those of the twelfth embodiment may be obtained.
      <br/>
      As the microstrip antenna members, square microstrip antenna members, ring strip antenna members, or the like may be used.
    </p>
    <p num="240">
      In the twelfth embodiment, electromagnetic coupling method for feeding signals to circular microstrip antenna members was used.
      <br/>
      However, another feeding method such as pin feeding method, coplanar feeding method, slot coupling feeding method, or the like may be used.
    </p>
    <p num="241">
      In the twelfth embodiment, as feeding line patterns, microstrip line patterns and tri-plate line patterns were used.
      <br/>
      However, other line patterns such as suspended line patterns may be used.
    </p>
    <p num="242">
      Moreover, in the twelfth embodiment, circular microstrip antenna members were used in dominant mode.
      <br/>
      However, the antenna elements may be used in a higher-order mode.
      <br/>
      In this case, since each antenna element has radiation directivity of a conical beam, an array antenna thereof can effectively form a conical beam.
      <br/>
      In practice, when each antenna element is used in a higher-order mode, an array antenna thereof can conveniently form a conical beam having a low elevation angle (namely, the direction of maximum radiation is close to the horizontal line).
    </p>
    <p num="243">
      In the twelfth embodiment, circularly polarizing method using two-point feeding was described.
      <br/>
      However, instead, a circular polarizing method using one-point feeding may be used.
    </p>
    <p num="244">
      The array antenna according to the twelfth embodiment shown in FIG. 62 had a total of eight antenna elements.
      <br/>
      However, the number of antenna elements is not limited to eight.
      <br/>
      The more the radiation intensity of a conical beam is stable in the direction of the rotation angle  PHI , the more antenna elements are required.
      <br/>
      When m=1, even if the number of antenna elements is four or six, a conical beam may be formed.
      <br/>
      In this case, the stability of intensity of radiation directivity with respect to the rotation angle  PHI  may be deteriorated to some extend.
      <br/>
      In addition, the optimum radius may deviate from the results of the equations (27) to (29).
    </p>
    <p num="245">Moreover, in the twelfth embodiment, honeycomb substance may be used instead of dielectric substrates.</p>
    <p num="246">
      According to the twelfth embodiment, in the beam forming circuit, feeding lines whose line length was varied was used as a phase shifting means for each antenna element.
      <br/>
      Instead, phase shifters may be used.
      <br/>
      In the twelfth embodiment, the power combining devices (power dividers) which were formed of T branches which combined (diveded) signals of radio waves were used.
      <br/>
      Instead of the T branches, even if hybrid couplers and Wilkinson type power divider are used, the same effects as those of the twelfth embodiment may be obtained.

    <p num="249">
      For the sake of simplicity, in the description of the thirteenth embodiment, the portions which are similar to those of the twelfth embodiment are omitted.

      FIG. 67 is a top view showing an array antenna according to the thirteenth embodiment of the present invention.

      This figure corresponds to FIG. 62 which shows the top view of the array antenna of the twelfth embodiment.
      <br/>
      In the twelfth embodiment, the beam forming circuit shifted the phase of the radiation directivity of each antenna element for  ALPHA i. On the other hand, in the thirteenth embodiment, each antenna element is rotated for  ALPHA i so as to shift the phase of the radiation directivity of each antenna element for  ALPHA i. Thus, the array antenna according to the thirteenth embodiment can form a conical beam similar to that the array antenna according to the twelfth embodiment does.
      <br/>

      A feature of the array antenna according to the fourteenth embodiment of the present invention is in that one of two antenna arrays is selected by an RF switch.

    <p num="268">
      According to the fourteenth embodiment, one of a plurality of conical beams can be selected.
      <br/>
      Thus, when an array antenna is designed to form a plurality of conical beams in the directions of different elevation angles with maximum radiation, the antenna can scan the beam in the directions of these elevation angles.
      <br/>
      Thus, even if a mobile station which has the array antenna according to the fourteenth embodiment is present at an inclined position, the antenna can receive and transmit radio waves for communication and broadcasting.

      As a modification of the fourteenth embodiment, in addition to the antenna arrays disposed on the peripheries of concentric circles, an antenna element which is excited in a dominant mode may be disposed at the center of the concentric circles.
      <br/>
      In this construction, the beam can be scanned in the zenith direction or to the direction of a predetermined elevation angle by the operation of a switch.

      This construction is effectively used in tracking a low-altitude orbiting satellite whose elevation angle varies time by time.

      Next, the operation of the array antenna according to the fifteenth embodiment of the present invention will be described.
      <br/>
      When the exciting phase  ALPHA ai of each antenna element is the direction angle  PSI ai times m (where m is any positive integer except for 0), by applying the equation(26), the radiation directivity of the first antenna array disposed on the periphery of the circle with the radius a is given by the following equation.
    </p>
    <p num="277">
      Ea ( THETA ,  PHI )=P(a,  THETA ) exp (j(m +- k) PHI )  (30)
      <br/>
      where k represents the variation of the phase of the radiation field of each antenna element corresponding to the rotation angle  PHI .
      <br/>
      In this embodiment, microstrip antenna members are used.
      <br/>
      In dominant mode (TM 11 mode), k=1.
      <br/>
      In higher-order mode(TM pq mode), k=p.
      <br/>
      The sign of k depends on whether each antenna element is excited with a left-hand circular polarized wave or right-hand circular polarized wave.
      <br/>
      When there are a proper number of antenna elements (for example, the number of antenna elements is eight or more), P (a,  THETA ) is approximately given by the following equation.
    </p>
    <p num="278">
      P(a,  THETA )=jA( THETA )Jm (ka * sin  THETA )  (31)
      <br/>
      where A ( THETA ) is the radiation directivity with respect to each antenna element.
      <br/>
      Likewise, when the exciting phase  ALPHA bi of each antenna element is the direction angle  PSI bi times n (where n is any positive integer except for 0), the radiation directivity of the second antenna array disposed on the periphery of the circle with the radius b is given by the following equation.
    </p>
    <p num="279">
      Eb ( THETA ,  PHI )=P(b,  THETA ) exp (j(n +- k) PHI )  (32)
      <br/>
      where all the antenna elements which construct the two antenna arrays are excited in the same mode and with the same rotation of polarized waves.
      <br/>
      By applying the equations (30) and (32), it is revealed that the two antenna arrays each form a conical beam having a constant intensity of radiation directivity in the direction of the rotation angle  PHI .
      <br/>
      When P (a,  THETA ) and P (b,  THETA ) are set so that the positions of peaks of the conical beams match in the direction of the elevation angle e (namely, these radiuses are optimally set), the conical beams each have a peak of radiation directivity in the same direction of the elevation angle  THETA .
    </p>
    <p num="280">
      The radiation directivity of two conical beams differs in the variation of the phase with respect to the rotation angle  PHI .
      <br/>
      When m +- k=1 and n +- k=2, the phases of the radiation fields of the two antenna arrays vary as shown in FIG. 76. In the figure, (a) represents the phase of the radiation field of the first antenna array disposed on the periphery of the circle with the radius a, whereas (b) represents the phase of the radiation field of the second antenna array disposed on the periphery of the circle with the radius b. For example, when the phase shifters and the amplifiers are set so that the signals of the two antenna arrays are combined with the same amplitude and the same phase in the direction of the rotation angle  PHI =0, the radiation directivity with a peak in the direction of the rotation angle  PHI =0 can be obtained.

      By varying the phases of the signals with the phase shifters, the beam can be scanned in the direction of any rotation angle  PHI .
      <br/>
      To prevent the beam from being scanned in other than desired direction, m and n should be set in the following conditions.
      <br/>
      .vertline.(m +- k)-(n +- k)=1  (33)
    </p>
    <p num="281">.vertline.m-n.vertline.=1</p>

    <p num="283">In the construction of a practical example according to the fifteenth embodiment of the present invention is the same as that of the fourteenth embodiment except that a circuit which amplifies, phase-shifts, and combines (divides) RF signals of two antenna arrays is formed instead of an RF switch.</p>
    <p num="284">
      In this construction, a circuit as shown in FIG. 78 is formed on the upper surface of the dielectric substrate 9257, which is the lowermost layer.
      <br/>
      The output points 9199 and 9233 of the beam forming circuits 9183 and 9200 of the first and second antenna arrays are electrically connected to the input points 9242 and 9241 through vertical lines, respectively.
      <br/>
      The RF signal of the beam forming circuit 9200 is sent from the input point 9241 to the MMIC module 9258 through the line 9243.
      <br/>
      The RF signal of the beam forming circuit 9183 is sent from the input point 9242 to the MMIC module 9259 through the line 9244.
      <br/>
      Each of the MMIC modules 9258 and 9259 is constructed of a phase shifter and an amplifier.
      <br/>
      The phase shifter shifts the phase of the RF signal of the corresponding beam forming circuit.
      <br/>
      The amplifier amplifies the output signal of the corresponding beam forming circuit.
      <br/>
      The output signals which have been amplified and phase-shifted are combined by a combining device 9304.
      <br/>
      The output signal of the combining device 9304 is sent to the output point 9248 through a line 9260.
      <br/>
      The output point 9248 is electrically connected to a connector.
      <br/>
      In this example, the combining device 9304 has a T branch.

    <p num="285">The effects of the array antenna according to the fifteenth embodiment of the present invention are as follows.</p>
    <p num="286">
      When a plurality of conical beams have the same amplitude but phase differences, these beams can be scanned in the direction of a predetermined rotation angle  PHI .
      <br/>
      Since these beams can be narrowed, a higher gain can be obtained than a simple conical beam.
      <br/>
      Thus, the array antenna according to the fifteenth embodiment is effectively used for an antenna for communications requiring high bit rate (as in pictures) and high C/N ratio.
    </p>
    <p num="287">
      With these phase shifters, the beam can be easily scanned in the direction of the rotation angle  PHI .
      <br/>
      Since this construction requires a phase difference between two RF signals, only one phase shifter may be required.
      <br/>
      Thus, unlike with the conventional array antenna which requires a number of phase shifters, the construction of the array antenna according to the fifteenth embodiment is simple, thereby reducing the production steps and lowering production cost.
      <br/>
      In addition, since the beam of the array antenna can be easily scanned in the direction of the rotation angle  PHI , this array antenna is very effective for an antenna installed in a mobile station.
    </p>
    <p num="288">
      Moreover, since the degree of freedom in design of the array antenna according to the fifteenth embodiment is high, the antenna can be optimally designed.
      <br/>
      For example, with two microstrip antenna members which are excited in a higher-order mode, two beams can be scanned in the similar manner.
      <br/>
      However, two conical beams cannot be easily scanned so that their peaks are matched in the direction of a predetermined elevation angle  THETA .
      <br/>
      Thus, the gain of the composite pattern may decrease.
      <br/>
      In the conventional method, since a higher-order mode is used, the frequency band is narrow.
      <br/>
      However, in the array antenna according to the fifteenth embodiment, since the dominant mode is used, a wide frequency band can be obtained.
    </p>
    <p num="289">Furthermore, with the MMIC modules which contain an amplifier and a phase shifter, the array antenna can be formed thinly and compactly.</p>
    <p num="290">
      Even if the array antenna according to the fifteenth embodiment of the present invention is modified in the same manner as the modification of the twelfth embodiment, the same effects of the fifteenth embodiment can be obtained.
      <br/>
      In addition, the following modifications do not affect the effects of the fifteenth embodiment.
    </p>
    <p num="291">When a combining device which combines two RF signals with the same amplitude is used instead of an amplifier, the same effects of the fifteenth embodiment can be obtained.</p>
    <p num="292">
      In the fifteenth embodiment, two antenna arrays were disposed on peripheries of two concentric circles.
      <br/>
      However, the number of antenna arrays is not limited to two.
      <br/>
      Instead, three or more antenna arrays may be used.
      <br/>
      In this case, a higher gain can be obtained than the fifteenth embodiment.
      <br/>
      In addition, sidelobes in other than a predetermined  PHI  direction can be reduced.
      <br/>
      When signals of three or more antenna arrays are combined, the exciting weight (namely, amplitude and phase) may be set as follows.

      The exciting weight of each antenna array which scans the composite pattern in the direction ( THETA ,  PHI ) is denoted by WN.
      <br/>
      In these conditions, the composite radiation field eARRAY is given by the following equation.

      eARRAY = SIGMA eN wN =EW  (34)

      Each antenna array is excited so that the absolute value and the phase of the exciting weight wN become the exciting amplitude and the exciting phase, respectively.

      These antenna elements 9401 to 9432 are circular polarizing antenna members which are fed from feed points 9441 to 9472, respectively.

      As shown in the figure, this array antenna is formed of three dielectric substrates 9491, 9492, and 9493 being layered.
      <br/>
      On the upper surface of the dielectric substrate 9490, which is the uppermost layer, the above-described microstrip antenna members and microstrip lines which are made of a conductor film are formed.

      The outer conductor 9493 also functions as a base conductor for the microstrip antenna members and the microstrip lines.
      <br/>
      The feed points of the antenna elements are electrically connected to the tri-plate line pattern through corresponding vertical lines.
      <br/>

      Thus, RF signals received from the antenna elements of each antenna array are sent in series.

      The signals of the first antenna array are received from a feed line 9536.

      The signals of the second antenna array are received from a feed line 9535.

      This array antenna uses a radial waveguide.

      The radial waveguide is defined by conductor plates 9681 and 9682.

      A signal is fed from a center conductor 9680 of a connector 9610 disposed at the center of the array antenna.

      The transmitting ratio of the power of each antenna element is adjusted by the length of the corresponding pin which protrudes to the radial waveguide.

      In this embodiment, the array antenna has eight circular antenna arrays disposed on peripheries of concentric circles with different radiuses.

      These antenna arrays are circular arrays 1001 to 1008.

      When each antenna element 1020 is excited with the exciting phase given by the equation (40), a conical beam is formed where a maximum intensity is obtained in the direction of a predetermined elevation angle  THETA  and the intensity of the rotation angle  PHI  is constant.

      FIG. 85 is a circuit diagram showing a feeding system of the array antenna according to the eighteenth embodiment of the present invention.
      <br/>
      The output signals of each of the circular antenna arrays 1001 to 1008 are sent to a feeding circuit 1024.
      <br/>
      The output signal of the feeding circuit 1024 is sent to a low- noise amplifier (LNA) 1021 which amplifies the input signal.
      <br/>
      The output signal of the LNA 1021 is sent to a phase shifter 1022 which shifts the phase of the input signal for predetermined degrees.
      <br/>
      The output signal of the phase shifter 1022 is sent to a combining device 1023.
      <br/>
      Thus, the combining device 1023 combines all the signals received from the antenna elements of the circular antenna arrays 1001 to 1002 through the feeding circuits 1024, the LNAs 1021, and the phase shifters 1022.
    </p>
    <p num="331">In this embodiment, only the construction for the receiving operation of the array antenna is described.</p>
    <p num="332">However, the basic construction for the transmitting operation is the same as that for the receiving operation except that the signal flow is reversed and high output amplifiers (HPAs) are used instead of the LNAs 1021.</p>
    <p num="333">
      In this embodiment, the feeding circuit 1024 combines signals received from the antenna elements which construct the corresponding circular antenna array by shifting the exciting phase for predetermined degrees (fixed degrees).
      <br/>
      The feeding circuits 1024 may be formed of a plane line pattern such as a microstrip line pattern, a tri-plate line pattern, or a suspended line pattern.
      <br/>
      In addition, the feeding method may be tournament feeding method, series feeding method, or the like.
      <br/>
      When the series feeding method is used, all the feeding circuits for the circular antenna arrays can be formed on the same plane.
      <br/>
      Thus, the array antenna can be thinly and simply constructed at low cost.
      <br/>
      When the LNAs 1021 and the phase shifters 1022 are integrally formed as MICs or MMICs, the size thereof can be further reduced.
      <br/>
      As with the feeding circuits 1024 for the circular antenna arrays 1001 to 1008, the combining device 1023 which combines signals received from the circular antenna arrays 1001 to 1008 can be formed as a microstrip line pattern.
      <br/>
      Thus, in this case, the construction of the array antenna can be formed thinly and compactly.
    </p>
    <p num="334">
      The output signals of the circular antenna arrays 1001 to 1008 are combined with proper combining ratio so that the gain in the direction of a predetermined rotation angle  PHI  becomes maximum.
      <br/>
      This combining ratio can be easily obtained by adjusting the power combining ratio and/or the amplitude of each amplifier.

      FIG. 86 is a graph showing an example of radiation directivity of the array antenna according to the eighteenth embodiment of the present invention.
      <br/>
      In this embodiment, the array antenna scans the beam in the direction of direction angles  THETA =50 degrees and  PHI =0 degree.
      <br/>
      By combining signals received from the eight circular antenna arrays 1001 to 1008 with the phase direction coefficient m=1 to 8, a gain of 15 dBi or more can be obtained.
    </p>
    <p num="336">
      FIG. 87 is a graph showing gain characteristics where the array antenna scans the beam in the direction of the rotation angle  PHI .
      <br/>
      As is clear from the figure, the array antenna according to this embodiment provides good scanning characteristics.
      <br/>
      When the beam is scanned in the direction of the rotation angle  PHI , the exciting phase for the antenna elements of each circular antenna array is properly adjusted by the corresponding phase shifter 1022.
      <br/>
      FIG. 88 shows a practical setting example of exciting phases for the circular antenna arrays.
      <br/>
      When the variation of the phase of each circular antenna array with the phase direction coefficient m is denoted by exp(j(m+1) PHI ) (namely, the variation of the phase of the radiation field of each antenna element is denoted by exp(j PHI )), the phase shifted by the phase shifter for each circular antenna array is given by the table shown in FIG. 89. FIG. 89 shows the relation between exciting phases and beam direction angles  PHI  (-180 degrees to +180 degrees).
      <br/>
      In this figure, the line length of the feeding circuits 1024 for the circular antenna arrays 1001 to 1008 are adjusted so that the beam is scanned in the direction of  PHI =0 when the phase shifted by each phase shifter 1022 is 0.
      <br/>
      The phase of each circular antenna array is set based on the phase of the circular antenna array 1001 with the phase direction coefficient m=1.
      <br/>
      Since the the exciting phase of the circular array with the reference phase (as in the circular array 1001) is always 0, the circular antenna array with the phase direction coefficient m=1 does not require the phase shifter.
    </p>
    <p num="337">
      As described above, in the eighteenth embodiment, a plurality of conical beams with nearly same amplitude and different phases are formed.
      <br/>
      With the nature of different phases, a composite pattern is formed so that these beams are scanned in the direction of a predetermined rotation angle  PHI .
      <br/>
      The beams can be scanned in the directions of direction angles  PHI  by setting the phases.
      <br/>
      In this construction, the beams can be scanned in the directions of the direction angles  PHI  by using at most several phase shifters corresponding to the circular antenna arrays.
      <br/>
      Thus, in comparison with the conventional beam scanning method of an array antenna having phase shifters which are connected to all antenna elements, the number of phase shifters of the array antenna according to this embodiment can be remarkably reduced.
      <br/>
      Consequently, the production cost of the array antenna according to this embodiment can be effectively reduced.
      <br/>
      In the eighteenth embodiment, the construction of an antenna which can scan the beam in the direction of the direction angle with the fixed elevation angle can be formed thinly and compactly.
      <br/>
      Since an antenna installed in a mobile station should be as small and light as possible, the array antenna according to the eighteenth embodiment is effectively used for an antenna installed in a mobile station.
      <br/>
      In addition, since a plurality of circular antenna arrays with different direction numbers are disposed, a high gain can be obtained.
      <br/>
      In particular, the array antenna according to the eighteenth embodiment is effective for narrowing the beam width in the direction of the rotation angle  PHI .
      <br/>
      Moreover, the array antenna according to this embodiment has a high degree of freedom in design.
      <br/>
      In other words, the array antenna can be designed to have a maximum gain in a predetermined beam direction or a wide frequency band.
      <br/>
      These features of this embodiment are superior to those of a beam scanning antenna which scans a beam with a combination of higher-order modes of microstrip antenna members.
    </p>
    <p num="338">Even if the array antenna according to the eighteenth embodiment is modified as follows, the same effects of the embodiment can be obtained.</p>
    <p num="339">
      A part of circular antenna arrays may be substituted with microstrip antenna members.
      <br/>
      For example, the variation of the phase of the microstrip antenna member excited in TM mn mode (circularly polarized wave) with respect to the rotation angle  PHI  of the radiation field is denoted by exp( +- jm PHI ) (the sign depends on the rotating direction of the circularly polarized wave), the circular antenna array may be substituted with one antenna element.
      <br/>
      In this case, no feeding system is required.
      <br/>
      Thus, the array antenna can be compactly formed.

    <p num="340">Next, nineteenth and twentieth embodiment of the present invention will be described.</p>
    <p num="341">The construction of the nineteenth and twentieth embodiments is the same as that of the eighteenth embodiment except for the value of phase direction coefficient m for each circular antenna array.</p>
    <p num="342">
      FIG. 90 is a top view showing an array antenna according to the nineteenth embodiment of the present invention.
      <br/>
      The array antenna has five circular antenna arrays 1002, 1004, 1006, 1008, and 1010 disposed on peripheries of concentric circles with different diameters.
      <br/>
      Each of the circular antenna arrays 1002, 1004, 1006, 1008, and 1010 is constructed of antenna elements.
      <br/>
      The direction numbers m of the circular antenna arrays 1002, 1004, 1006, 1008, and 1010 are 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10, respectively.
      <br/>
      As with the array antenna according to the eighteenth embodiment, the phase of a phase shifter for each of the circular antenna arrays 1002, 1004, 1006, 1008, and 1010 is set so that the composite beam of the radiation field of the antenna elements of the corresponding circular antenna array is scanned in the direction of a predetermined rotation angle  PHI .
      <br/>
      In the nineteenth embodiment, since the direction numbers m of the circular antenna arrays 1002, 1004, 1006, 1008, and 1010 are set so that they increment by 4 one after the other, two beams take place in the direction of the rotation angle  PHI  and the opposite direction thereof.
      <br/>
      FIG. 91 shows an example of radiation directivity in this case.
      <br/>
      As is clear from the figure, two beams which are the same take place in the directions of  PHI =0 and 180 degrees.
      <br/>
      Likewise, when the direction numbers m are set so that they increment by 3 one after the other, three beams take place in the directions at every 120 degrees.
      <br/>
      When the direction numbers m are set so that they increment by 3 one after the other, four beams take place in the directions at every 90 degrees.
      <br/>
      In this construction, a multi-beam array antenna which scans beams in the directions of a plurality of direction angles  PHI  can be easily formed.
      <br/>
      This array antenna is effectively used for a transmitting antenna which forms beams scanned in a plurality of directions at a time.

    <p num="343">
      FIG. 92 is a top view showing an array antenna according to the twentieth embodiment of the present invention.
      <br/>
      This antenna has five circular antenna arrays 1002, 1003, 1005, 1008, and 1012 disposed on peripheries of concentric circles with different radiuses.
      <br/>
      Each of the circular antenna arrays 1002, 1003, 1005, 1008, and 1012 is constructed of antenna elements.
      <br/>
      The direction numbers m of the circular antenna arrays 1002, 1003, 1005, 1008, and 1012 are designated 2, 3, 5, 8, and 12, respectively.
      <br/>
      As with the array antenna according to the eighteenth embodiment, the phase of a phase shifter for each of the circular antenna arrays 1002, 1003, 1005, 1008, and 1012 is set so that the composite beam of the radiation field of the antenna elements of the corresponding circular antenna array is scanned in the direction of a predetermined rotation angle  PHI .
      <br/>
      In this embodiment, the difference between the two direction numbers m of any adjacent antenna arrays is unique.
      <br/>
      The practical designating method of the direction numbers m is not limited to that in this embodiment.
      <br/>
      FIG. 93 shows an example of radiation directivity of the array antenna according to the twentieth embodiment.
      <br/>
      In this embodiment, each circular antenna array is designed to form a conical beam in the direction of  THETA =50 degrees.
      <br/>
      In addition, the exciting phase of each circular antenna array is set so that a main beam of a composite pattern is formed in the direction of  PHI =0 degree.
      <br/>
      The construction of the feeding system of the array antenna according to the twentieth embodiment is the same as that according to the eighteenth embodiment shown in FIG. 85. In the twentieth embodiment, since the difference between the direction numbers m of any two adjacent circular antenna arrays is unique, only one beam is formed.
      <br/>
      Thus, the twentieth embodiment provides the effects similar to those of the eighteenth embodiment.
      <br/>
      Thus, the array antenna according to the twentieth embodiment is effectively used for an antenna installed in a mobile station.
    </p>
    <p num="344">The common effects of the nineteenth and twentieth embodiments are as follows.</p>
    <p num="345">
      The pitch of the antenna arrays of the array antennas according to the nineteenth and twentieth embodiments is wider than that according to the eighteenth embodiment.
      <br/>
      Thus, according to the nineteenth and twentieth embodiments, the size of each antenna elements can be increased, thereby improving the degree of freedom in design such as a variety of antenna types.
      <br/>
      For example, although the characteristics of circular polarized waves should be improved on the stage of antenna elements.
      <br/>
      However, when conventional circular microstrip antenna members are used, substrates with a low permittivity of around 1.5 should be used, thereby increasing the diameter of the resultant array antenna.
      <br/>
      Thus, in the construction according to the eighteenth embodiment, the antenna elements cannot be properly disposed.
      <br/>
      On the other hand, in the constructions according to the nineteenth and twentieth embodiments, since the pitches of the circular antenna arrays are large, the antenna elements can be properly disposed.
      <br/>
      In the constructions according to the nineteenth embodiment and the twentieth embodiment, since the pitches of the circular antenna arrays can be increased, the degree of freedom in design such as improvement of characteristics of circular polarized waves is improved.

      The phase shifter 1034-1 to 1034-4 operates with two bits, thereby controlling the phases of the corresponding signals at every 90 degrees.

      <br/>
      For example, when the phase of the array antenna is controlled, the phase of each of the circular antenna elements (m=1, 5, 9, . . . , etc.) becomes constant.
      <br/>
      Generally speaking, when a beam is scanned with p bits in the direction of the rotation angle  PHI  (namely, at every 360/2p), the output signals of a plurality of circular antenna arrays with the relation where the difference between the direction numbers m of these arrays is a multiple of 2p are directly combined.
      <br/>
      The composite output signal is sent to a phase shifter with p bits.
      <br/>
      Thereafter, the output signals of all phase shifters are combined.

      Thus, the composite output signal is obtained.

    <p num="349">
      In the above-described construction, the number of phase shifters can be halved.

      FIG. 95 is a circuit diagram showing a feeding system of an array antenna according to the twenty-second embodiment of the present invention.

      The operation and construction of the array antenna according to the twenty-second embodiment are the same as those according to the eighteenth embodiment except that the number of bits of each of phase shifters electrically connected from feeding circuits to LNAs depend on each circular antenna array.
      <br/>
      In the twenty-second embodiment, a circular antenna array 1001 (phase direction coefficient m=1) is not electrically connected to a phase shifter (namely, a zero-bit phase shifter is connected).
      <br/>
      The circular antenna array 1001 is connected to a combining device 1060 through an LNA amplifier 1052-1.
      <br/>
      A circular antenna array 1002 (m=2) is connected to a three-bit phase shifter 1053 through an LNA amplifier 1052-2.
      <br/>
      A circular antenna array 1003 (m=3) is connected to a two-bit phase shifter 1054 through an LNA 1052-3.
      <br/>
      A circular antenna array 1004 (m=4) is connected to a three-bit phase shifter 1055 through an LNA 1052-4.
      <br/>
      A circular antenna array 1005 (m=5) is connected to a one-bit phase shifter 1056 through an LNA 1052-5.
      <br/>
      A circular antenna array 1006 (m=6) is connected to a three-bit phase shifter 1057 through an LNA 1052-6.
      <br/>
      A circular antenna array 1007 (m=7) is connected to a two-bit phase shifter 1058 through an LNA 1052-7.
      <br/>
      A circular antenna array 1008 (m=8) is connected to a three-bit phase shifter 1059 through an LNA 1052-8.
      <br/>
      The output signals of these phase shifters 1053 to 1059 and the LNA 1052-1 are sent to the combining device 1060.

    <p num="352">
      In this construction, a beam can be scanned with three bits (namely, at every 45 degrees).
      <br/>
      Next, this scanning operation will be described practically.
      <br/>
      FIG. 96 is a table which gives exciting phases of antenna arrays in the case that a beam is scanned in the direction of rotation angle  PHI  at every 45 degrees.
      <br/>
      Now, assume that the phase of the circular antenna array 1001 (m=1) is treated as a reference phase.
      <br/>
      In addition, assume that when the phase of each circular antenna array is 0, a beam is scanned in the direction of  PHI =0 by the feeding system.
      <br/>
      The phase shifted by each phase shifter corresponding to each beam direction angle is determined by the relation shown in FIG. 89. FIG. 96 shows the phases (in degrees) obtained from the table of FIG. 89. In FIG. 96, numerals in parentheses represent values directly obtained from the table of FIG. 89. As is clear from the table of FIG. 96, when the number of bits of each phase shifter is the value shown in FIG. 95, a beam can be scanned with three bits.
      <br/>
      As the effect of such a construction, even if a beam is scanned with three bits, all the phase shifters required are not three-bit phase shifters.
      <br/>
      Half of the phase shifters required can be low-bit phase shifters.
      <br/>
      Thus, the phase shifters can be simplify constructed with low loss and at low cost.

      Thus, the production cost of the array antenna can be reduced.

      As was described in the array antenna according to the twenty-first embodiment, the phases of circular antenna arrays where the difference between the direction numbers m thereof is 4 become the same.
      <br/>
      Thus, the construction of the feeding system as shown in FIG. 94 is required.
      <br/>
      In this construction, no phase shifter is required for the output signals of the circular antenna arrays 1001 and 1005 (m=1 and 5).
      <br/>
      A two-bit phase sifter is required for the output signals of the circular antenna arrays 1002 and 1006 (m=2 and 6).
      <br/>
      A one-bit phase shifter is required for the output signals of the circular antenna arrays 1003 and 1007 (m=3 and 7).
      <br/>
      A two-bit phase shifter is required for the output signals of the circular antenna arrays 1004 and 1008 (m=4 and 8).

      <br/>
      In this case, a three-bit phase shifter is connected to the circular antenna array 1001 (m=1).
      <br/>
      A three-bit phase shifter is connected to the circular antenna array 1003 (m=3).
      <br/>
      A two-bit phase shifter is connected to the circular antenna array 1004 (m=4).

      A three-bit phase shifter is connected to the circular antenna array 1005 (m=5).

      A one-bit phase shifter is connected to the circular array antenna 1006 (m=6).
      <br/>
      A three-bit phase shifter is connected to the circular antenna array 1007 (m=7).
      <br/>
      A two-bit phase shifter is connected to the circular antenna array 1008 (m=8).
      <br/>

      <br/>
      In other words, on the first combining stage, the output signals of two circular antenna arrays where the difference between the direction numbers m thereof is four are combined.
      <br/>
      On the first combining stage, one of the output signals is sent to the one-bit phase shifter 1043.
      <br/>
      On the second combining stage, the output signals where the difference between the phase direction coefficient m is two are combined.
      <br/>

    </p>
    <p num="364">
      In this construction, a beam can be scanned with three bits.
      <br/>
      As with the effects of the twenty-second embodiment, low-bit phase shifters can be used, thereby simplifying the construction of the feeding system and lowering the production cost of the array antenna.
      <br/>
      In the construction according to the twenty-third embodiment, the number of phase shifters are reversely proportional to the number of bits thereof.
      <br/>
      Thus, in the twenty-third embodiment, a beam can be scanned with simpler phase shifters than those of the twenty-second embodiment.
    </p>
    <p num="365">
      The construction of the twenty-third embodiment can be generally expressed as follows.
      <br/>
      When a beam is scanned in the direction of the rotation angle  PHI  at every (360/2p) angles (where p is any positive integer which represents the number of bits), the output signals of each circular antenna array are combined in tournament feeding method.
      <br/>
      On the first stage, the output signals of two circular antenna arrays where the numbers m thereof is 2p-1 are combined.
      <br/>
      When the signals are combined, one of them is sent to a one-bit phase shifter so as to control the phase of the resultant signal at every 180 degrees.
      <br/>
      On the second stage, the output signals of four circular antenna arrays where the difference between the numbers m thereof is 2p-2 are combined.
      <br/>
      When the signals are combined, one of them is sent to a two-bit phase shifter so as to control the phase of the resultant signal at every 90 degrees.
      <br/>
      In this manner, two output signals are combined on each stage.
      <br/>
      One of the output signals is sent to a phase shifter so as to control the phase thereof.
      <br/>
      The number of bits of phase shifters increases as the phase number increases.
      <br/>
      Thus, on the last stage, a p-bit phase shifter is connected.
      <br/>
      In this construction, half of all the phase shifters required are one-bit phase shifters.
      <br/>
      The number of phase shifters with the largest bits is only one.
      <br/>
      Thus, since most of the phase shifters required are inexpensive low-bit phase shifters, the production cost of the antenna can be reduced.

      The output signal of the phase shifter 1069 is sent to a combining device 1076.
      <br/>
      The output signal of the LNA 1062-1 is sent to the combining device 1076.
      <br/>
      In this construction, the combining devices which combine the output signals of each circular antenna array are disposed in series.
      <br/>
      Thus, the construction can be simplified.
      <br/>
      Since the feeding system can be formed of one layer of microstrip line pattern, the antenna can be formed thinly and compactly.
      <br/>
      In this construction, each phase shifter may have the same bits and same phase.
      <br/>
      In the case that the phase shifted by one phase shifter is  BETA , when the phase direction coefficient m of the circular antenna array is 1, the phase is 0.
      <br/>
      When the phase direction coefficient m of the circular antenna array is 2, the phase is  BETA .
      <br/>
      When the phase direction coefficient m of the circular antenna array is 3, the phase is 2 BETA .
      <br/>
      Thus, the phases given by FIG. 89 can be obtained.
      <br/>
      Therefore, with the same phase shifters, a beam can be scanned in the direction of the rotation angle  PHI .
      <br/>
      In this construction, since only one type of phase shifters are used, the array antenna is suitable for quantitative production.
      <br/>
      In addition, since each phase shifter can be controlled in the same manner, the control circuit, power supply circuit, and so forth can be shared.
      <br/>
      Thus, the construction of the feeding system can be remarkably simplified.
    </p>
    <p num="368">
      In the twenty-fourth embodiment of the present invention, when a beam is scanned in the direction of the rotation angle  PHI  with p bits, the feeding system can be constructed of one type of phase shifters.
      <br/>
      Thus, since the control circuit and the power supply circuit can be shared, the production cost of the array antenna can be reduced.
      <br/>
      Generally expressed, 2p circular antenna arrays are connected to (2p -1) phase shifters in series so that the output signals of each circular antenna array flow to the following phase shifters.
      <br/>
      For a circular antenna array (m=k+2p), the output signals thereof flow to no phase shifter.
      <br/>
      For a circular antenna array (m=k+1+2p), the output signals thereof flow to one phase shifter.
      <br/>
      For a circular antenna array (m=k+2p +2p), the output signals thereof flow to two phase shifters.
      <br/>
      For a circular antenna array (m=k+2p -1+2p), the output signals thereof flow to all (2p -1) phase shifters.
    </p>
    <p num="369">
      In the twenty-fourth embodiment, when the power loss of each phase shifter is large, the composite output signal of each antenna array may not be properly amplified by each LNA.
      <br/>
      In this case, amplifiers may be connected to all or part of phase shifters so as to compensate the power loss.
      <br/>
      Thus, since the composite ratio of each circular antenna array is precisely matched, an array antenna with a high gain can be formed.

    <p num="371">
      FIG. 100 is a circuit diagram showing a feeding system of an array antenna according to the twenty-fifth embodiment of the present invention.
      <br/>
      In this embodiment, a matrix type feeding circuit which combines the output signals of each circular antenna array is used.
      <br/>
      In the construction of the feeding system shown in FIG. 100, the output signals of circular antenna arrays 1001 (m=1) to 1008 (m=8) are sent to feeding circuits 1081-1 to 1081-8, respectively.
      <br/>
      The output signal of each feeding circuit 1081 is sent to a corresponding LNA 1082 which amplifies the signal.
      <br/>
      The output of the LNA 1082 is sent to couplers 1083 which are disposed at intersections of matrix-shape transmission lines.
      <br/>
      Each transmission line is terminated with non-reflection terminating resisters 1084 and 1085.
      <br/>
      By adjusting the positions of the couplers 1083, the phase of the output signal of each circular antenna array can be freely set.
      <br/>
      Thus, a plurality of beams can be scanned in the directions of any direction angles  PHI .

      In this construction, a plurality of beams scanned in any directions can be easily formed with a simple circuit using a matrix feeding method.
      <br/>
      In addition, when the composite ratio of each circular antenna array is optimally set, the coupling ratio of each coupler can be newly used.
      <br/>
      Thus, the degree of freedom in design is improved.
      <br/>
      This construction is effectively used for a multi-beam antenna.

      With a switching means for selecting one of these beams, a beam scanning antenna can be formed.

      In this embodiment, the output signals of eight circular antenna arrays 1001 to 1008 (m=1 to 8) are combined.
      <br/>
      Four beams are formed in the directions of the direction angles  PHI  at every 90 degrees.
      <br/>
      As described above-mentioned embodiments, the phases of the output signals of circular antenna arrays where the difference of the direction numbers m thereof is four become the same.
      <br/>
      Thus, as shown in the figure, the output signals of these circular antenna elements are combined on the first stage.
      <br/>
      In the feeding system, four 3-dB hybrid couplers 1094 each of which shifts the phase of the input signal for 90 degrees with the same amplitude are used.
      <br/>
      These hybrid couplers 1094 are disposed on two stages.
      <br/>
      In these hybrid couplers 1094, a fixed phase shifter 1095 is disposed as shown in the figure.
      <br/>
      Thus, four beams are formed in the directions at every 90 degrees.
      <br/>
      The fixed phase shifter 1095 can be formed by varying the line length.
      <br/>
      In addition, the hybrid couplers 1095 of any type may be used.
      <br/>
      Moreover, as the hybrid couplers 1095, 180-degree hybrid couplers which shifts the phase of the signal for 180 degrees may be used.
      <br/>
      When the hybrid couplers are formed of a microstrip line pattern, they can be constructed thinly and compactly.
      <br/>
      In addition, a plurality of beams can be formed in the directions of the direction angles i with the simple construction.
      <br/>
      When each port is selected with a switch, a beam can be scanned in the direction of the rotation angle  PHI .
      <br/>
      Thus, the array antenna according to this embodiment is very effective for an inexpensive, small, and thin antenna installed in a mobile station.

      FIG. 102 is a circuit diagram showing a feeding circuit which combines the output signals of eight circular antenna arrays (phase direction coefficient m=1 to 8) and forms eight beams in the directions of the direction angles  PHI  at every 45 degrees.

      In this construction, 12 3-dB, 90-degree hybrid couplers 1094 are disposed on three stages.
