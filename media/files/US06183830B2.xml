    <heading>TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
    <p num="1">The present invention relates to a digital video disk substrate, and more precisely, to that of a polycarbonate which is cracked little at the time of molding and exhibits small birefringence and excellent transcriptional ability.</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND ART</heading>
    <p num="2">
      The standards of CDs, CD-ROMs and the like which are conventional optical disks are disk diameter=120 mm, disk thickness=1.2 mm, and structure=a single plate utilizing one surface.
      <br/>
      On the contrary, the standards of digital video disks (DVDs) are disk diameter=120 mm, disk thickness=1.2 mm, and structure=both surfaces stuck.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, the thickness of each disk substrate is 0.6 mm. As materials of these disk substrates, polycarbonates are much used in recent years, as having high transparency, good heat resistance, good impact resistance and good water resistance.
    </p>
    <p num="3">
      However, thin disk substrates, of which the thickness is reduced from 1.2 mm to 0.6 mm as so mentioned in the above, are often problematic in that they will be cracked or broken during molding and that their birefringence may increase.
      <br/>
      In order to prevent the disks from being cracked during molding, the molecular weight of the polycarbonate which Ls the substrate material can be increased, but in this case, the birefringence of the disks further increases.
      <br/>
      On the other hand, in order to reduce the birefringence, it has been attempted to mold the digital video disk substrates by the use of techniques such as ultrasonic molding, multi-stage compression molding and high-speed filling molding.
      <br/>
      Even by these techniques, however, the reduction in the birefringence is not sufficient, and what is worse, the breakage of the disks more often occurs as compared with usual molding techniques.
    </p>
    <p num="4">Under such circumstances, the present invention has been attained, and an object of the invention is to provide a digital video disk substrate which is cracked little during molding and which exhibits small birefringence and excellent transcriptional ability.</p>

      If its amount is smaller than 1 * 10-8 mols, the catalyst will be ineffective.
      <br/>
      If larger than 10-2 mols, however, too much catalyst will worsen the physical properties, especially heat resistance andhydrolysis resistance of the final products, polycarbonates, and increases the production costs.
      <br/>
      Addition of a larger amount of the catalyst over the defined range is unnecessary.

      As preferred examples of the combined catalyst system, mentioned are a combination of a nitrogen-containing basic compound and a boron compound; a combination of a nitrogen-containing basic compound and an alkali (alkaline earth) metal compound; a combination of a nitrogen-containing basic compound, an alkali (alkaline earth) metal compound and a boron compound.
      <br/>
      Most preferred is a combination of tetramethylammonium hydroxide and tetraphenylphosphonium tetraphenylborate.
    </p>

      In the combined catalyst system for use in the transesterification, it is desirable that the amount of the nitrogen-containing basic compound is from 10-7 to 10-1 mols, preferably from 10-6 to 10-2 mols, more preferably from 10-5 to 10-3 mols, while that of the nitrogen-tree basic compound is from 10-8 to 10-3 mols, preferably from 10-7 to 10-4 mols, more preferably from 10-6 to 10-5 mols.
      <br/>
      If the amount of the nitrogen-containing basic compound is smaller than 10-7 mols, the catalytic activity of the compound in the initial stage of the reaction will be poor.
      <br/>
      However, use of the compound in an amount of larger than 10-1 mols is unfavorable, as increasing the production costs.
      <br/>
      On the other hand, if the amount of the nitrogen-free basic compound is smaller than 10-8 mols, the catalytic activity of the compound in the latter stage of the reaction will be poor; but use of the compound in an amount of larger than 10-3 mols is unfavorable, as increasing the production costs.

    <p num="32">Regarding the amount of the combined catalyst system to be used, the total of the nitrogen-containing basic compound and the nitrogen-free basic compound is generally from 1 * 10-8 to 1 * 10-2 mols, but preferably from 1 * 10-7 to 1 * 10-3 mols, per mol of the diphenol.</p>
    <p num="33">
      If the amount is smaller than 1 * 10-8 mols, the catalytic effect could not be exhibited.
      <br/>
      If larger than 10-2 mols, however, such a too much amount will worsen the physical properties, especially heat resistance and hydrolysis resistance of the final products, polycarbonates, and increases the production costs.
      <br/>
      Addition of a larger amount of the catalyst compounds over the defined range is unnecessary.
    </p>
    <p num="34">
      The reaction temperature for the transesterification is not specifically defined, and may fall generally between 100 and 330 (degree)  C., but preferably between 180 and 300 (degree)  C. More preferably, the reaction temperature is gradually elevated during the reaction within the range falling between 180 and 300 (degree)  C. If the reaction temperature is lower than 100 (degree)  C., the transesterification will be retarded.
      <br/>
      If higher than 330 (degree)  C., however, the polymers produced will be thermally deteriorated, and such high reaction temperature is unfavorable.
    </p>
    <p num="35">
      The reaction pressure is not specifically defined, and may be suitably determined depending on the vapor pressure of the monomers being polymerized.
      <br/>
      In general, however, it is desirable that the polymerization is effected at a pressure falling between reduced pressure of about 50 mmHg and increased pressure of about 50 atmospheres in the initial stage, then under reduced pressure in the latter stage, and finally at a pressure falling between 0.01 and 100 mmHg.
    </p>
    <p num="36">
      Regarding the reaction time, the reaction may be continued until it gives the polycarbonate having a predetermined molecular weight.

    <p num="37">
      The reaction maybe effected in the presence of no solvent.
      <br/>
      If desired, however, it may be effected in the presence of an inert solvent weighing from 1 to 150% by weight of the polycarbonate to be obtained.

      <br/>
      DVD substrates of polycarbonates having a viscosity-average molecular weight of smaller than 10, 000 will be cracked at the time of molding, while those of polycarbonates having a viscosity-average molecular weight of larger than 17,000 will exhibit increased birefringence.
      <br/>
      In order to prevent the cracking of DVD substrates and in view of the birefringence of DVD substrates, it is preferable that the polycarbonates have a viscosity-average molecular weight of from 12,000 to 16,000, more preferably from 13,500 to 15,500.
      <br/>
      The molecular weight distribution of the polycarbonates is not specifically defined, but it is desirable that the ratio of the weight-average molecular weight (Mw) of the polymer to the number-average molecular weight (Mn) thereof, or that is, Mw/Mn is not smaller than 2.3, more preferably not smaller than 2.5. If the molecular weight distribution is too narrow, or that is, if the ratio Mw/Mn is too small, DVD substrates of the polymers will be cracked or broken at the time of molding.

    <p num="39">
      The method of controlling the viscosity-average molecular weight (Mv) of the polymer to fall between 10,000 and 17,000 is not specifically defined.

      <br/>
      For example, different polycarbonates obtained in a solution method are mixed together, or a polycarbonate obtained in a solution method is mixed with a polycarbonate obtained in a transesterification method.

    <p num="40">
      The method of controlling the ratio, weight-average molecular weight (Mw)/number-average molecular weight (Mn) is not specifically defined.

      Polycarbonates obtained in a transesterification method are easily controlled to have the ratio of not smaller than 2.3. On the other hand, for those obtained in a solution method, two or more polycarbonates that differ in the molecular weight are mixed together, or a polycarbonate obtained in a solution method may be mixed with a polycarbonate obtained in a transesterification method.

      The molding temperature is usually in the range between 300 and 390 (degree)  C., but preferably between 300 to 345 (degree)  C., and the mold temperature may be generally between 80 and 125 (degree)  C. To reduce the birefringence of the moldings, DVD substrates and to improve the transcriptional ability thereof, the fluidity of the resin being molded must be increased.
      <br/>
      However, if the molding temperature is higher than 390 (degree)  C., the polycarbonate being molded will be deteriorated, often resulting in that the transparency of the moldings obtained is lowered.
      <br/>
      High transparency is indispensable to DVD substrates.

      The mold temperature is preferably higher in order to increase the fluidity of the resin being molded, but if it is higher than 125 (degree)  C., the substrates molded will be deformed.

      For injection molding, the injection rate is preferably not smaller than 150 cm3 /sec, more preferably not smaller than 200 cm3 /sec.
      <br/>
      If the rate is smaller than 150 cm3 /sec, the molding material will be so rapidly cooled in the mold that the fluid pressure loss and the resin orientation will increase thereby producing failed moldings with distortion.

      To form DVD substrates from the polycarbonate resin pellets A, B, C, D, E, F and I produced in Examples and Comparative Examples, to evaluate them, and to measure their physical properties, used were the following methods.
      <br/>
      The data obtained in those methods are shown in Table 1, in which "-" indicates "not measured".
    </p>
    <p num="50">Formation of DVD Substrates</p>
    <p num="51">Each sample of polycarbonate resin pellets was injection-molded under conditions of a molding machine=IS80EPN made by Toshiba Machine Co., Ltd., mold clamping force=50 tons, injection rate=250 cm3 /sec, injection pressure=1500 kg/cm2, mold material=duralumin 2024, molding temperature=340 (degree)  C., mold temperature=115 (degree)  C., cooling time=5 seconds and cavity portion=electroless nickel plating to prepare DVD substrates each having a diameter of 120 mm and a thickness of 0.6 mm.</p>
    <p num="52">Evaluation</p>
    <p num="53">(1) Number of Non-cracked Samples:</p>
    <p num="54">In each Example, 100 DVD substrates were molded, of which the number of non-cracked ones was counted.</p>
    <p num="55">(2) Falling Weight Impact Strength:</p>
    <p num="56">
      Having been stored for 48 hours after their molding, the DVD substrates were subjected to a falling weight impact test in which the weight dropped down onto the substrates weighed 3.76 kg, the dropping speed was 1 m/sec, and the supporting bed had a major diameter of 50 mm.
      <br/>
      The energy (J) of the falling weight that struck the DVD substrate at the position of 18 mm of its radius was measured.
    </p>
    <p num="57">(3) Transcriptional ability:</p>
    <p num="58">
      The transcriptional ability is represented by �height of the convex of DVD substrate/depth of the concave of the mold (5  MU m)� * 100.
      <br/>
      The data of 20 samples were averaged.
      <br/>
      For the measurement, used was a measure scope UM-3 made by Nikon Co., Ltd.
    </p>
    <p num="59">(4) Birefringence ( DELTA n):</p>
    <p num="60">
      Using a double refraction measurement systemADR-2000 made by Oak Co., Lt(d., the birefringence ( DELTA n) of each disk sample was measured at randomly selected points on the circle of 30 mm and 50 mm from its center.
      <br/>
      The relationship between the birefringence ( DELTA n) and the retardation (R) is represented by R= DELTA n * t, wherein t indicates the thickness of the disk sample (nm).
      <br/>
      Table 1 shows the absolute value (nm) of the retardation (R= DELTA n * t).
    </p>
    <p num="61">(5) Steaming Resistance:</p>
    <p num="62">To evaluate its steaming resistance, each disk sample was exposed to steam at 121 (degree)  C. for 48 hours, and its outward appearance was macroscopically checked.</p>
    <p num="63">(6) Viscosity-average Molecular Weight (Mv):</p>
    <p num="64">
      Using an Ubbelohde's viscometer, the intrinsic viscosity � ETA � of each polycarbonate sample in a methylene chloride solution at 20 (degree)  C. was measured.
      <br/>
      Mv is calculated according to the following equation.
      <br/>
      � ETA �=1.23 * 10-5 * Mv0.83
    </p>
    <p num="65">(7) Weight-average molecular weight/Number-average molecular weight (ratio of Mw/Mn)</p>
    <p num="66">The weight-average molecular weight (Mw) and the number-average molecular weight (Mn) of each polycarbonate sample was measured through gel permeation chromatography (GPC), and the ratio Mw/Mn was obtained.</p>

      <br/>
      Next, this was kept at 270 (degree)  C. while being further degassed to a vacuum degree of 1 mmHg, and reacted for 30 minutes, and thereafter for 15 minutes after having been still further degassed to a vacuum degree of 0.5 mmHg. After the reaction, the reactor was purged with argon gas to be at atmospheric pressure, and the reaction mixture was taken out of the reactor, and, while it was in melt, fed into a double-screw extruder by the action of a gear pump, and pelletized therethrough to obtain pellets of polycarbonate resin A.
