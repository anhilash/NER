    <heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="3">
      This invention relates to a method of making ar, electronic component using a reworkable underfill encapsulant composition.
      <br/>
      Underfill encapsulant compositions protect and reinforce the interconnections between an electronic component and a substrate.
    </p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="4">
      Microelectronic devices contain millions of electrical circuit components, mainly transistors assembled in integrated circuit (IC) chips, but also resistors, capacitors, and other components.
      <br/>
      These electronic components are interconnected to form the circuits, and eventually are connected to and supported on a carrier or substrate, such as a printed wire board.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      The integrated circuit component may comprise a single bare chip, a single encapsulated chip, or an encapsulated package of multiple chips.
      <br/>
      The single bare chip can be attached to a lead frame, which in turn is encapsulated and attached to the printed wire board, or it can be directly attached to the printed wire board.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      Whether the component is a bare chip connected to a lead frame, or a package connected to a printed wire board or other substrate, the connections are made between electrical terminations on the electronic component and corresponding electrical terminations on the substrate.
      <br/>
      One method for making these connections uses metallic or polymeric material that is applied in bumps to the component or substrate terminals.
      <br/>
      The terminals are aligned and contacted together and the resulting assembly heated to reflow the metallic or polymeric material and solidify the connection.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      During subsequent manufacturing steps, the electronic assembly is subjected to cycles of elevated and lowered temperatures.
      <br/>
      Due to the differences in the coefficient of thermal expansion for the electronic component, the interconnect material, and the substrate, this thermal cycling can stress the components of the assembly and cause it to fail.
      <br/>
      To prevent failure, the gap between the component and the substrate is filled with a polymeric encapsulant, hereinafter called underfill or underfill encapsulant, to reinforce the interconnect and to absorb some of the stress of the thermal cycling.
    </p>
    <p num="8">Two prominent uses for underfill technology are in packages known in the industry as flip-chip, in which a chip is attached to a lead frame, and ball grid array, in which a package of one or more chips is attached to a printed wire board.</p>
    <p num="9">
      The underfill encapsulation may take place after the reflow of the metallic or polymeric interconnect, or it may take place simultaneously with the reflow.
      <br/>
      If underfill encapsulation takes place after reflow of the interconnect, a measured amount of underfill encapsulant material will be dispensed along one or more peripheral sides of the electronic assembly and capillary action within the component-to-substrate gap draws the material inward.
      <br/>
      The substrate may be preheated if needed to achieve the desired level of encapsulant viscosity for the optimum capillary action.
      <br/>
      After the gap is filled, additional underfill encapsulant may be dispensed along the complete assembly periphery to help reduce stress concentrations and prolong the fatigue life of the assembled structure.
      <br/>
      The underfill encapsulant is subsequently cured to reach its optimized final properties.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      If underfill encapsulation is to take place simultaneously with reflow of the solder or polymeric interconnects, the underfill encapsulant, which can include a fluxing agent if solder is the interconnect material, first is applied to either the substrate or the component; then terminals on the component and substrate are aligned and contacted and the assembly heated to reflow the metallic or polymeric interconnect material.
      <br/>
      During this heating process, curing of the underfill encapsulant occurs simultaneously with reflow of the metallic or polymeric interconnect material.
    </p>
    <p num="11">
      For single chip packaging involving high volume commodity products, a failed chip can be discarded without significant loss.
      <br/>
      However, it becomes expensive to discard multi-chip packages with only one failed chip and the ability to rework the failed component would be a manufacturing advantage.
      <br/>
      Today, one of the primary thrusts within the semiconductor industry is to develop not only an underfill encapsulant that will meet all the requirements for reinforcement of the interconnect, but also an underfill encapsulant that will be reworkable, that is, one that will allow the failed component to be removed mechanically without destroying the substrate.
    </p>
    <p num="12">
      Conventional underfill technology uses low viscosity thermosetting organic materials, the most widely used being epoxy/anhydride systems.
      <br/>
      In order to achieve the required mechanical performance, relatively high molecular weight thermoplastics would be the preferred compositions for underfill materials.
      <br/>
      These materials, however, have high viscosity or even solid film form, which are drawbacks to the manufacturing process.
    </p>

    </p>
    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="21">
      The maleimide and vinyl compounds used in the underfil encapsulant compositions of this invention are curable compounds, meaning that they are capable of polymerization, with or without crosslinking.
      <br/>
      As used in this specification, to cure will mean to polymerize, with or without crosslinking.
      <br/>
      Cross-linking, as is understood in the art, is the attachment of two polymer chains by bridges of an element, a molecular group, or a compound, and in general will take place upon heating.
      <br/>
      As cross-linking density is increased, the properties of a material can be changed from thermoplastic to thermosetting.
    </p>
    <p num="22">
      It is possible to prepare polymers of a wide range of cross-link density by the judicious choice and amount of mono- or poly-functional compounds.
      <br/>
      The greater proportion of polyfunctional compounds reacted, the greater the cross-link density, In order to provide thermoplastic properties, the underfill encapsulants of this invention will be prepared from mono-functional compounds to limit the cross-link density.
      <br/>
      However, a minor amount of poly-functional compounds can be added to provide some cross-linking and strength to the composition, provided the amount of poly-functional compounds is limited to an amount that does not diminish the desired thermoplastic properties.
      <br/>
      Within these parameters, the strength and elasticity of individual underfill encapsulants can be tailored to a particular end-use application.
    </p>
    <p num="23">
      The cross-link density can also be controlled to give a wide range of glass transition temperatures in the cured underfill to withstand subsequent processing and operation temperatures.
      <br/>
      For the reworkable underfill encapsulants, the Tg is chosen to be below the reflow temperature of the metallic or polymeric interconnect.
      <br/>
      If the underfill is added after the reflow of the interconnect material, the low Tg will allow the encapsulant material to soften and adhere to both the electronic component and the substrate without affecting the interconnect.
    </p>
    <p num="24">
      If the underfill is added before the reflow, the same effect is achieved.
      <br/>
      The underfill encapsulant will soften and adhere to the electronic component and substrate during the reflow of the interconnect material.
      <br/>
      Intimate contact is maintained with the interconnect after the interconnect solidifies, imparting good stress transfer and long-term reliability.
    </p>
    <p num="25">In those cases where it is necessary to rework the assembly, the electronic component can be pried off the substrate, and any residue underfill can be heated until it softens and is easily removed.</p>
    <p num="26">
      In the inventive underfill encapsulant compositions, the maleimide compounds and the vinyl compounds may be used independently, or in combination.
      <br/>
      The maleimide or vinyl compounds, or both, will be present in the curable underfill encapsulant compositions in an amount from 2 to 98 weight percent based on the organic components present (excluding any fillers).
    </p>
    <p num="27">
      The underfill encapsulant compositions will further comprise at least one free-radical initiator, which is defined to be a chemical species that decomposes to a molecular fragment having one or more unpaired electrons, highly reactive and usually short-lived, which is capable of initiating a chemical reaction by means of a chain mechanism.
      <br/>
      The free-radical initiator will be present in an amount of 0.1 to 10 percent, preferably 0.1 to 3.0 percent, by weight of the maleimide or vinyl compound, or a combination of both maleimide and vinyl compounds (excluding any filler).
      <br/>
      The free radical curing mechanism gives a fast cure and provides the composition with a long shelf life before cure.
      <br/>
      Preferred free-radical initiators include peroxides, such as butyl peroctoates and dicumyl peroxide, and azo compounds, such as 2,2'-azobis(2-methyl-propanenitrile) and 2,2'-azobis(2-methyl-butanenitrile).
    </p>
    <p num="28">
      Alternatively, the underfill encapsulant compositions may contain a photoinitiator in lieu of the free-radical initiator, and the curing process may then be initiated by UV radiation.
      <br/>
      The photoinitiator will be present in an amount of 0.1 to 10 percent, preferably 0.1 to 3.0 percent, by weight of the maleimide or vinyl compound, or a combination of both maleimide and vinyl compounds (excluding any filler).
      <br/>
      In some cases, both photoinitiation and free-radical initiation may be desirable.
      <br/>
      For example, the curing process can be started by UV irradiation, and in a later processing step, curing can be completed by the application of heat to accomplish a free-radical cure.
    </p>
    <p num="29">
      In general, these compositions will cure within a temperature range of 80 (degree)  to 180 (degree)  C., and curing will be effected within a length of time of 5 minutes to 4 hours.
      <br/>
      As will be understood, the time and temperature curing profile for each encapsulant composition will vary, and different compositions can be designed to provide the curing profile that will be suited to the particular industrial manufacturing process.
    </p>
    <p num="30">
      For some underfill operations, inert inorganic fillers are used in the underfill encapsulant to adjust the coefficient of thermal expansion to more closely mirror that of the circuit interconnect, and to mechanically reinforce the interconnect.
      <br/>
      Examples of suitable thermally conductive fillers include silica, graphite, aluminum nitride, silicon carbide, boron nitride, diamond dust, and clays.
      <br/>
      The fillers will be present typically in an amount of 20 to 80 percent by weight of the total underfill encapsulant composition.

      A coupling agent as used herein is a chemical species containing a polymerizable functional group for reaction with the maleimide and other vinyl compound, and a functional group capable of condensing with metal hydroxides present on the surface of the substrate.
      <br/>
      Such coupling agents and the preferred amounts for use in compositions for particular substrates are known in the art.
      <br/>
      Suitable coupling agents are silanes, silicate esters, metal acrylates or methacrylates, titanates, and compounds containing a chelating ligand, such as phosphine, mercaptan, and acetoacetate.
      <br/>
      When present, coupling agents typically will be in amounts up to 10 percent by weight, and preferably in amounts of 0.1-3.0 percent by weight, of the maleimide and other monofunctional vinyl compound.

    <p num="117">Coefficient of Thermal Expansion and Glass Transition Region</p>
    <p num="118">
      The coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) is the change in dimension per unit change in temperature for a given material.
      <br/>
      Different materials will have different rates of expansion, and rates of expansion for any given material will vary with the temperature.
      <br/>
      If the CTE is very different for elements attached together, thermal cycling can cause the attached elements to bend, crack, or delaminate.
      <br/>
      In a typical semiconductor assembly, the CTE of the chip is in the range of 2 or 3 ppm/ (degree)  C.; for organic circuit board substrate, the CTE is greater than 30 ppm/ (degree)  C.; and for the solder interconnect, the CTE is 26-28 ppm/ (degree)  C. In order to reinforce the solder interconnect, the CTE of the underfill encapsulant is best close to that of the solder.
    </p>
    <p num="119">
      When a polymer is subjected to the application of heat, it will move through a transition region between a hard, glassy state to a soft, rubbery state.
      <br/>
      This region is known as the glass transition region or Tg.
      <br/>
      If a graph of expansion of the polymer versus temperature is plotted, the glass transition region is the intersection between the lower temperature/glassy region coefficient of thermal expansion and the higher temperature/rubbery region coefficient of thermal expansion.
      <br/>
      Above this region, the rate of expansion increases significantly.
      <br/>
      Consequently, it is preferred that the glass transition of the polymer be higher than normal operating temperatures experienced during the application, and if reworkability is needed, that the glass transition be lower than any rework temperature.
    </p>
    <p num="120">
      For each of the Compositions 11-A to 11-E, the glass transition temperature (Tg) and the coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) were measured using Thermal Mechanical Analysis on cured samples.
      <br/>
      A 2 ml aliquot of each of the Compositions was injected into the 4 mm cavity of a silica/rubber mold and cured to form a resinous cylinder of 4 mm in diameter and 5 mm in height.

      These samples were heated in a continuum of temperature ranging from -50 (degree)  C. to 200 (degree)  C. at a rate of increase in temperature of 5 (degree)  C./minute.
      <br/>
      The Tg was measured as the temperature in  (degree)  C. at which the sample softened, determined as the breakpoint in the curve of expansion versus temperature.
      <br/>
      The CTE was measured as the slope of the expansion curve in units of ppm/ (degree)  C. The CTE and the Tg for Compositions 11-A to 11-E are reported here:
