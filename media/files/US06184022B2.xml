    <heading>TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
    <p num="2">The present invention relates to a novel metalloproteinase useful in applications such as diagnosis of the presence of tumour cells, diagnosis of the degree of tumour malignancy, or other medical or physiological fields.</p>
    <p num="3">More specifically, the present invention relates to one type of metalloproteinase expressed specifically in human tumour cells and a DNA sequence encoding therefor; a plasmid having a nucleotide sequence which contains said DNA sequence; a host cell harbouring said plasmid; a method for manufacturing said protein using said host cell; a probe which hybridizes with the aforesaid DNA sequence; a method for detecting DNA or RNA containing the aforesaid sequence using said probe; and monoclonal antibodies which bind specifically to the aforesaid protein.</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND</heading>
    <p num="4">A group of enzymes with different substrate specificity and referred to in general as matrix metalloproteinases (hereinafter referred to as "MMPs") contributes to degradation of the extracellular matrix comprising such complex components as collagen, proteoglycan, elastin, fibronectin, and laminin.</p>
    <p num="5">Previously reported MMPs include interstitial collagenase (MMP-1), 72 kDa gelatinase (also known as type IV collagenase or gelatinase A; MMP-2), 92 kDa gelatinase (also known as type IV collagenase or gelatinase B; MMP-9), stromelysin-1 (MMP-3), matrilysin (MMP-7), neutrophil collagenase (MMP-8), stromelysin-2 (MMP10) and stromelysin-3 (MMP-11).</p>
    <p num="6">
      These MMPs are a family of enzymes whose primary structure has been reported previously.
      <br/>
      With the exception of MMP-7, the primary structure among the family of reported MMPs comprises essentially an N-terminal propeptide domain, a Zn+ binding catalytic domain and a C-terminal hemopexin-like domain.
      <br/>
      In MMP-7 there is no hemopexin-like domain.
      <br/>
      MMP-2 and MMP-9 contain an additional gelatin-binding domain.
      <br/>
      In addition, a proline-rich domain highly homologous to a type V collagen  ALPHA 2 chain is inserted in MMP9 between the Zn+ binding catalytic domain and the C-terminal hemopexin-like domain.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      In highly metastatic tumour cells, there are reports of conspicuous expression of type IV collagenase (MMP-2, MMP-9) which mainly degrade type IV collagen (Cancer Res., 46:1-7, 1986; Biochem.
      <br/>
      Biophys. Res. Commun., 154:832-838, 1988; Cancer, 71:1368-1383, 1993).
      <br/>
      Likewise, it has been reported MMP-3 act as an activator of proMMP-9 (J.
      <br/>
      Biol. Chem., 267:3581-3584, 1992).
    </p>
    <p num="8">The degree of matrix metalloproteinase expression serves as an index to diagnosing the degree of cancer malignancy.</p>
    <heading>DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="9">The present inventors discovered a novel matrix metalloproteinase (hereinafter referred to as "MT-MMP") and performed a structural analysis thereof.</p>

    <p num="23">The present invention is described in detail hereafter.</p>
    <p num="24">
      Using highly conserved sequences (SEQ ID NOS:3 and 4) selected from amino acid sequences of the known matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) family, the present inventors designed and synthesized an oligonucleotide primer having the sequences denoted by SEQ ID NOS:5 and 6.
      <br/>
      A PCR was carried out using said oligonucleotide primer and a human placental cDNA library, the PCR products obtained were sequenced, and a 390 bp DNA fragment having a sequence non-homologous to known MMP was obtained.
      <br/>
      Using this 390 bp DNA fragment as a probe, the human placenta cDNA library was screened, and a cDNA in the positive phage clone obtained was sequenced.
      <br/>
      The nucleotide sequence is that denoted by SEQ ID NO:2.
      <br/>
      A sequence identical to the nucleotide sequence in SEQ ID NO:2 did not exist in the Genbank/EMBL DNA database, and DNA having this nucleotide sequence was ascertained to be completely novel.
    </p>
    <p num="25">
      The nucleotide sequence of the aforesaid cloned cDNA in SEQ ID NO:2 had a 3' non-coding sequence and open reading frame that potentially encode 582 amino acid.
      <br/>
      An initiation codon was located at nucleotide number 112, and a stop codon was present at nucleotide number 1858.
      <br/>
      It was determined that this open reading frame encoded the 582 amino acid sequence in SEQ ID NO:1, that a deduced signal sequence continued after the initiation codon, and that a hydrophobic domain (SEQ ID NO:7) specific to a membrane-binding protein of 20 or more linked hydrophobic amino acids was present from C-terminal amino acid number 533 to 562.
    </p>
    <p num="26">
      When homology between the amino acid sequence of MT-MMP and that of the known MMP family was analyzed, MT-MMP had high homology to the known MMP family, as shown in FIG. 2.
      <br/>
      The sequences best conserved in MT-MMP were active site sequences, as well as sequences proximal to processing site between precursor and mature substance conserved in the MMP family.
      <br/>
      The fact that MT-MMP has the structural characteristics of a membrane-binding protein, and the presence in MT-MMP of a sequence of linked hydrophobic amino acids (shown in Sequence Sheet sequence number 7) not found in the rest of the MMP family, strongly suggested that MT-MMP, unlike other MMP family, is a membrane-binding MMP.
    </p>
    <p num="27">
      When MT-MMP expression in various human tissues was studied by Northern Blot analysis with various tissue-derived Poly(A)RNA, high expression was seen in the placenta, lung and kidney (see FIG. 3).
      <br/>
      Likewise, results from Northern Blot analysis performed with RNA extracted from normal and tumour areas of human lung squamous cell carcinoma showed that MT-MMP is expressed peculiarly at tumour sites (see FIG. 4).

    <p num="28">Finally, immunoprecipitation and immunostain experiments using anti-MT-MMP monoclonal antibodies showed that the MT-MMP pertaining to the present invention is expressed on a cell membrane without secretion of a gene product, and MMP-2 activation induced by the expression of MT-MMP was observed in the cells transfected with MT-MMP gene (Nature, 370:61-65, 1994).</p>

      <br/>
      The ends of the cDNA were converted to blunt end with T4 DNA polymerase, and EcoR I sites present in the cDNA were methylated by EcoR I methylase.
      <br/>
      Using T4 DNA ligase, an EcoR I linker �d(pG-G-A-A-T-T-C-C)� and the cDNA were ligated, and cDNA possessing EcoR I sites at both ends was generated by EcoR I digestion.

      The sequences denoted by Sequence SEQ ID NOS:3 (P-1) and 4 (P-2) were selected from among amino acid sequences of the known MMP family as highly conserved amino acid sequences in the MMP family, and oligodeoxynucleotide primers corresponding respectively to oligopeptide P-1 and oligopeptide P-2 were designed.
      <br/>
      Specifically, when amino acids coded by two or more codons were present in an oligopeptide, the sequences were designed as a mixture as shown in SEQ ID NOS:5 (primer 1) and 6 (primer 2).

    <p num="48">
      Host E. coli Y1090 was transfected with the human placenta cDNA library constructed in the  LAMBDA gtll cited in the foregoing section (a) and plaques were formed.
      <br/>
      Specifically, Y1090 was cultured overnight in an L broth containing 0.02% maltose, and bacteria were harvested and suspended in 10 mM MgSO4.
      <br/>
      This cell suspension and a phage solution were mixed, incubated at 37 (degree)  C. for 15 minutes, and then the phages were adsorbed onto the host bacteria.
      <br/>
      Soft agar was added thereto, and the material was spread on an L plate (the above-noted operation is hereinafter termed "plating").
      <br/>
      The plate was incubated overnight at 42 (degree)  C. and a plaque was formed, after which a nylon filter (e.g., Hibond-N, Amersham) or a nitrocellulose filter (e.g., HATF, Millipore) was placed onto the plate and left in place for approximately 30 seconds.
      <br/>
      The filter was gently peeled and immersed in an alkaline denaturant (0.1 M NaOH, 1.5 M NaCl) for 30 seconds, then immersed in a neutralizing solution (0.5 M Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8 containing 1.5 M NaCl) for 5 minutes.
      <br/>
      The filter was then washed with 2 *  SSPE (0.36 M NaCl, 20 mM NaH2 PO4, 2 mM EDTA) and dried.
      <br/>
      The foregoing plaque-to-filter transfer was repeated, and at least two filters were prepared.
      <br/>
      However, plate contact time for the second and subsequent filters was extended to approximately 2 minutes.
      <br/>
      Filters were baked 2 hours at 80 (degree)  C. and DNA was thus fixed.

      The two filters, at a minimum, prepared from one plate were respectively washed 1 hour at 42 (degree)  C. in a wash solution (50 mM Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0 containing 1 M NaCl, 1 mM EDTA and 0.1% SDS), placed in a hybridization bag, and prehybridization was carried out by 6 to 8 hours immersion at 42 (degree)  C. in a prehybridization solution �50% formamide, 5 * Denhardt's solution (0.2% bovine serum albumin, 0.2% polyvinylpyrolidone), 5 *  SSPE, 0.1% SDS, 100  MU g/ml heat-denatured salmon sperm DNA�. Next, the 32 P-labeled probe noted in section (c), heat-denatured for 5 minutes at 100 (degree)  C., was added to the prehybridization solution, and hybridization was carried out overnight at 42 (degree)  C. After hybridization was complete, the filters were washed at room temperature with an excess of 2 *  SSC solution containing 0.1% SDS. Next, the filters were placed for 15 minutes at 68 (degree)  C. in 1 *  SSC solution containing 0.1% SDS. The filters were then dried, layered with X-ray film (Kodak XR), and 1 week autoradiography was then carried out at -70 (degree)  C. The X-ray films were developed, replica filters in duplicate produced from one plate were piled up each other, and signals that appeared precisely same place on duplicate filters were marked.
      <br/>
      Plaques corresponding to marked signals were suspended in SM solution (50 mM Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5 containing 0.1 M NaCl and 10 mM MgSO4).

      Polyethylene glycol was added to a 10% final concentration in the supernatant, and the material was mixed and left at 4 (degree)  C. for 1 hour.
      <br/>
      The material was then centrifuged, the supernatant was discarded, and phage particles were collected.

      The phage particles were suspended in SM solution and purified by a glycerol gradient ultracentrifugation method (see "Molecular Cloning, a Laboratory Manual", T. Maniastis et al., Cold Spring Harbor: Laboratory Press pp. 2.78, 1989).
      <br/>
      The phages obtained were suspended in SM solution and treated with DNase I and RNase A. A mixture of 20 mM EDTA, 50  MU g/ml proteinase K, and 0.5% SDS was then added, and the material was incubated at 65 (degree)  C. for 1 hour.
      <br/>
      The material was then subjected to phenol extraction and diethylether extraction, and DNA was precipitated by ethanol precipitation.

      The culture was centrifuged and the bacteria were removed, and PEG/NaCl was added to precipitate the phages.
      <br/>
      The precipitate was suspended in TE solution, and single-stranded DNA was extracted with phenol and recovered by ethanol precipitation.
      <br/>
      The single-stranded DNA was sequenced using a fluorescence DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Model 373A) and a Taq dye-primer cycle sequencing kit (Applied Biosystems).

      The total length of the sequence determined was 3403 base pairs, and the sequence thereof is denoted by SEQ ID NO:2.

      On Days 2, 3, 5 and 8, half of each culture medium (approx. 0.1 ml) was replaced with fresh HAT medium, and on Day 11, half of each culture medium was replaced with fresh HT culture medium (HAT culture medium not containing aminopterin).
      <br/>
      On Day 14, for all the wells in which hybridoma growth was observed to the naked eye, positive wells were investigated by enzyme-linked immunoadsorbent assay (ELISA).
      <br/>
      Specifically, the polystyrene 96-well plate was respectively coated with polypeptides A, B and C serving as antigens, washed using PBS for washing (containing 0.05% Tween 20), and unadsorbed peptides were thus removed.
      <br/>
      In addition, the uncoated portion of each well was blocked with 1% BSA. 0.1 ml of supernatant from wells in which hybridoma growth was confirmed was added to each polypeptide-coated well, and the plate was stood at room temperature for approximately 1 hour.

    <p num="76">
      Horseradish peroxidase-labeled goat anti-mouse immunoglobulin was added as a secondary antibody, and the plate was again stood at room temperature for approximately another 1 hour.

    <p num="78">
      Hybridomas in wells positive with respect to individual antigen peptides, as obtained in the foregoing section (e), were monocloned according to the limiting dilution method.
      <br/>
      Specifically, hybridomas were diluted to 5, 1 and 0.5 per well and were respectively added to 36, 36 and 24 wells of a 96 microwells.
      <br/>
      On Day 5 and Day 12, approximately 0.1 ml NS-1 medium was added to each well.
      <br/>
      Approximately 2 weeks after cloning began, the ELISA noted in section (e) was performed for groups in which sufficient hybridoma growth was visually confirmed and 50% or more wells were negative for colony formation.
      <br/>
      If all tested wells were not positive, 4 to 6 antibody-positive wells in which the number of colonies was 1 were selected, and recloning was performed.
      <br/>
      Finally, as shown in Table 1 and Table 2, 12, 20 and 9 hybridomas were obtained which produced monoclonal antibodies against polypeptide A, polypeptide B or polypeptide C, respectively.

      In addition, BALB/c mice given an one week prior intraperitoneal administration of pristane were given a similar intraperitoneal administration of 1 * 107 cells of obtained hybridomas, and after 1 to 2 weeks, abdominal fluid containing 4 to 7 mg/ml of monoclonal antibody was successfully obtained.
      <br/>
      The abdominal fluid obtained was salted out by 40% saturated ammonium sulfate, and IgG class antibodies were adsorbed to Protein A Affigel (Bio-Rad) and purified by elution with a 0.1M citric acid buffer, pH 5.

    <p num="82">
      In accordance with the above-discussed ELISA, the supernatant of monoclones obtained in section (f) were added to microtitration plates respectively coated with polypeptide A, polypeptide B or polypeptide C. After washing with PBS, isotype-specific rabbit anti-mouse IgG antibodies (Zymed Lab.) were added.
      <br/>
      After washing with PBS, horseradish peroxidase-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG (H+L) was added, and class and subclass were determined using hydrogen peroxide and 2.2'-azino-di(3-ethylbenzthiazolinic acid) as a substrate.

      By means of EcoR I cleavage, an insertion fragment was excised from the recombinant pBluescript containing a cloned MT-MMP gene, constructed in section (f) of Working Example 1.
      <br/>
      Cloning was then carried out at an EcoR I site of the eukaryotic expression vector pSG5 (Stratagene) Then, human fibrosarcoma cells (HT1080) were transfected with said recombinant pSG5 by a calcium phosphate method.
      <br/>
      Specifically, 20  MU g of recombinant pSG5 and 62  MU l of 2M CaCl2 was added to distilled water, and 2 *  HBSP solution (50 mM HEPES buffer, pH 7.1 containing 1.5 mM Na2 HPO4, 10 mM KCl, 280 mM NaCl and 12 mM glucose) was added to the bottom of the tube to form a total volume of 1 ml.
      <br/>
      This material was mixed, stood at room temperature for approximately 30 minutes, and thorough precipitate formation was carried out.
      <br/>
      The precipitate was dispersed by pipetting, added dropwise to HT1080 cells and incubated for approximately 4 hours in a CO2 incubator.
      <br/>
      Next, the culture medium was removed, a 15% glycerol solution was added and treated for 1 to 3 hours, the glycerol was discarded by suction, washed with PBS and fresh culture medium containing 35 S-methionine was added.
      <br/>
      Culturing was continued, and cellular proteins were labeled by 35 S. Incidentally, expression of MT-MMP genes in HT1080 cells cannot be detected by Northern Blot analysis.

      Sepharose-4B (Pharmacia) coupled with a monoclonal antibody obtained in Working Example 3 was added to the supernatant, the material was incubated at 4 (degree)  C. for 2 hours with agitation, and immunoprecipitation was carried out.
      <br/>
      Monoclonal antibodies against polypeptide A used in immunoprecipitation were two of the 12 obtained in Working Example 3 which had low non-specific reactivity (monoclone numbers 114-1F2 and 114-2F2 �Assignment No. FERM BP-4743�).
      <br/>
      Next, Sepharose 4B coupled with monoclonal antibodies subjected to immunoprecipitation were precipitated by centrifugation, washed three times with a washing solution (0.01 M Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8 containing 1% Triton X-100, 1% bovine hemoglobin and 0.14 M NaCl), and lastly, washed with 0.05 M Tris-HCl buffer, pH 6.8. A sample buffer for SDS polyacrylamide electrophoresis was added to washed Sepharose-4B coupled with a monoclonal antibody, boiled 5 minutes at 100 (degree)  C., and SDS polyacrylamide electrophoresis was carried out.

      The electrophoresed gel was layered with X-ray film (Kodak XR), 1 week autoradiography was then carried out at -70 (degree)  C., and the developed X-ray films were traced by a densitometer to measure signal intensity.
      <br/>
      With each of the anti-MT-MMP monoclonal antibodies used (monoclone numbers 114-1F2 and 114-2F2), the immunoprecipitate contained a 63 kDa protein.

      In cells transfected with a pSG5 vector alone not containing an MT-MMP gene as a control, anti-MTMMP monoclonal antibodies (monoclone numbers 114-1F2 and 114-2F2) did not precipitate a 63 kDa protein.
      <br/>
      The 63 kDa molecular weight of the protein detected by immunoprecipitation nearly matched a molecular weight of 65.78 kDa calculated from the amino acid sequence denoted by SEQ ID NO:1.
      <br/>
      In addition, a variant MT-MMP expression plasmid was constructed in which amino acids from position 13 to position 101 were deleted from the amino acid sequence denoted by SEQ ID NO:1, HT1080 cells was transfected with said variant as stated above, and immunoprecipitation was carried out.
      <br/>
      With HT1080 cells to which the variant MT-MMP gene was introduced, a 63 kDa protein was not detected, and a 55 kDa protein was detected.

      This suspension was ultracentrifuged (100,000x g, 1.5 hours, 4 (degree)  C.) to remove insoluble residue, and the supernatant obtained was taken as a cell membrane fraction.
    </p>
    <p num="101">
      Cell membrane fractions (protein content 20  MU g) respectively prepared from untreated COS-1 cells or from COS-1 cells transfected with pSG5 vector alone or pSG5 vector with an MT-MMP gene were incubated with HT1080 cell culture supernatant at 37 (degree)  C. for 2 hours.
      <br/>
      Using these samples, the zymography noted in the above section (a) was performed.
    </p>
    <p num="102">
      In the results, new 64 kDa and 62 kDa bands appeared and the activation of proMMP-2 present in HT1080 cell culture supernatant was observed only when cell membrane fractions derived from MT-MMP gene-transfected COS-1 cells were used (see FIG. 7), and the activation of proMMP-2 was inhibited by the addition of recombinant (r) human TIMP-2.
      <br/>
      These results exhibited the activation of proMMP-2 by MT-MMP expressed on a cell membrane.

    <p num="103">(c) Stimulation of cellular invasion in vitro due to MT-MMP expression</p>
    <p num="104">Invasion of cells was assayed by modified Boyden Chamber method (Cancer Res., 47:3239-3245, 1987), and operations were carried out in accordance with the manufucture's instructions for a Biocoat Matrigel Invasion Chamber (Becton Dickinson).</p>
    <p num="105">
      In a manner similar to that noted in the foregoing section (a), HT1080 cells or NIH3T3 cells were transfected with recombinant pSG5 carrying a cloned MT-MMP gene, or a control pSG5 vector alone, by a calcium phosphate method, and each of these host cells secreted proMMP-2.
      <br/>
      The resulting transfectants were then suspended in DMEM medium containing 0.1% BSA, and 2 * 105 cells were seeded onto an uncoated filter (pore size 8  MU m) or a preswelled Matrigel Coat filter in a Biocoat Matrigel Invasion Chambers.
      <br/>
      After 24 hours incubation in a CO2 incubator at 37 (degree)  C., the filters were fixed by 10 seconds immersion in methanol.
      <br/>
      The filters were then stained by hematoxylin for 3 minutes, washed, and stained by eosin for 10 seconds, and the number of cells invaded the bottom surface of the filters were counted under a light microscope (at a magnification of  * 400).
    </p>
    <p num="106">
      In the MT-MMP gene-transfected HT1080 cells and NIH3T3 cells, more than twice as many invading cells were seen compared to cells transfected with the control vector alone (See FIG. 8 Matrigel).
      <br/>
      Specifically, MT-MMP expression was seen to stimulate cellular invasion.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, the addition of 10  MU g/ml of r-human TIMP-2 to this assay system clearly suppressed cellular invasion (see FIG. 8 Matrigel+r-human TIMP-2).
