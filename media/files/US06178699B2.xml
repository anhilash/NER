      Field of the Invention
    </p>
    <p num="2">The present invention relates to an open/close control system for controlling the opening and closing operations of a slide door, which is mounted on the side of a vehicle body and driven by a drive source, e.g., a motor, in accordance with an inclination of the slide door produced when the vehicle is vertically inclined with respect to the longitudinal axis of the vehicle body, viz., when the vehicle stops on a sloping road.</p>
    <p num="3">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
    <p num="4">
      There is known an open/close control system for a vehicle slide door in which a slide door is mounted on the side of a vehicle body while being slidable in the lengthwise direction of the vehicle body, and is opened and closed by a drive source, e.g., a motor.
      <br/>
      An operating means is provided close to the driver's seat or a door handle.
      <br/>
      To open or close the slide door, a driver or any other occupant operates the operating means.
      <br/>
      In turn, the drive source is driven to move the slide door for its opening and closing.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      The slide door is heavy, and moves linearly and in the lengthwise direction of the vehicle body.
      <br/>
      Therefore, when the vehicle body is vertically inclined with respect to the longitudinal axis of the vehicle body, the drive force to move the slide door is greatly varied.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      When the vehicle is on a steep upward slope, a large drive force is required to move or slide the slide door in the upward direction.
      <br/>
      When the vehicle is on a flat road, a little force is required for the same purpose.
      <br/>
      When the vehicle is on a steep downward slope, a braking force, not the drive force, is required for sliding the slide door.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      When the force, which is capable of moving the slide door being located on a steep slope in the upward direction, is used for moving the slide door in the upward direction, the force is too large to move the slide door in the horizontal or downward direction.
      <br/>
      A measure taken for this problem by the conventional technique is to control the force for moving or sliding the slide door in accordance with a door moving speed detected.
      <br/>
      This prior control usually uses a time delay technique for suppressing a hunting in the door movement.
      <br/>
      In a situation where the vehicle stops on a steep downward slope and its slide door is slid or moved downward direction, upon the start of door movement, the door rushes forward before the open/close control system operates.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      When the vehicle is on a steep upward slope, to move its slide door in the upward direction, it is desirable to use a small drive force from the first in controlling the opening/closing operation of the door.
      <br/>
      To this end, it is very important to know an inclination of the vehicle body in the opening/closing control.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      An open/close control system for a vehicle slide door is known in which when the slide door is manually moved, the control device detects the manual operation for the slide door and drives the drive motor to move or slide the door for its opening or closing.
      <br/>
      Specifically, the control device detects that a distance the slide door is manually moved reaches a preset value of distance or a moving speed of the slide door reaches a preset value of speed, and drives the motor to turn in such a direction as to move the door in the same direction as the moving direction of the manually moved door.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      When the vehicle equipped with such a control device stops on a slope, a large force is required to manually move the slide door of the vehicle upward.
      <br/>
      Therefore, when the door is moved in the upward direction on the slope, it is desirable to quickly shift a control mode of the control device to a motor-driven control mode.
      <br/>
      One possible measure to obtain a quick shift of the control mode is to set the preset distance and the preset speed at small values.
      <br/>
      To this end, the necessity is to know a degree of inclination of the vehicle body before the open/close control for the slide door is exercised.
    </p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="11">Accordingly, an object of the present invention is to provide an open/close control system which detects a vertical inclination of the vehicle body with respect to its longitudinal direction during the course of the movement of the slide doe, not using a sensor or a suitable device provided exclusively for the inclination sensing purpose, and controls the opening and closing of the slide door on the basis of the inclination of the vehicle body thus detected.</p>
    <p num="12">According to the present invention, there is provided an open/close control system for a vehicle slide door, comprising: a drive source; an opening/closing mechanism for moving the slide door being mounted on a side of a vehicle body for opening and closing; clutch means for transmitting a drive force of said drive source to said opening/closing mechanism interruptively; movement signal generating means for generating a signal dependent on a moving direction of said slide door; and slide door control means for controlling the drive force to be transmitted to said opening/closing mechanism by controlling said drive source and said clutch means, wherein said slide door control means stops an operation of said drive source and thereby stops said slide door, declutches said clutch means to allow said slide door to be movable, detects a movement of said slide door caused by weight by use of an output signal of said movement signal generating means, and determines an inclination of a vehicle according to a detection result.</p>
    <p num="13">
      In the open/close control system, the movement signal generating means preferably comprises an encoder rotating in a direction dependent on the moving direction of said slide door, and said slide door control means detects a moving state of said slide door by use of a phase relationship between two-phase pulse signals derived from said encoder.
      <br/>
      Hereupon, the slide door control means can detect an inclination of the vehicle body at a position where the vehicle stops, by counting number of pulses of a pulse signal output from said encoder for a fixed time.
      <br/>
      Or the slide door control means can detect an inclination of the vehicle body at a position where the vehicle stops, by detecting an acceleration of said slide door by use of a period variation of the pulse signals output from said encoder.
    </p>
    <p num="14">Further, it is preferable that, when said slide door control means detects that said slide door is moved in an opening direction by weight, by use of an output signal from said movement signal generating means, said slide door control means judges that the vehicle body is on an upward slope, when said slide door is moved in a closing direction, said slide door control means judges that the vehicle body is on an downward slope, and when said slide door is not moved, said slide door control means judges that the vehicle is on a flat road.</p>
    <p num="15">Still further, the slide door control means detects an inclination of the vehicle body at a position where the vehicle stops, by use of a distance said slide door moves and a door speed at that time, or a moving time of said slide door and a door speed at that time.</p>
    <p num="16">
      The open/close control system for a vehicle slide door, which is thus constructed according to the present invention, detects a phase relation of an output signal produced from the movement signal generating means (e.g., a two-phase pulse signal output from a rotary encoder), to thereby detect a moving status of the slide door, and detects a vertical inclination of the vehicle body with its longitudinal axis on the basis of the detected phase relation.
      <br/>
      Specifically, when the slide door moves in the opening direction, the open/close control system recognizes that the vehicle is on an upward sloping-road; when it moves in the closing direction, the control device recognizes that-the vehicle is on a downward sloping road; when it is standstill, the control device judges that the vehicle is on a flat road.
    </p>
    <p num="17">
      A state that the slide door moved down by its weight may be analogous to a state that a spherical body rolls down on and along a slope.
      <br/>
      An acceleration of the door can be derived from any of a distance the door moved and a moving speed of the door at that time, a moving time of the door and a moving speed thereof at that time, and a variation of a pulse period.
      <br/>
      Therefore, a degree of the inclination of the slide door can analogously be obtained using the acceleration of gravity.
    </p>
    <p num="18">The inclination information thus obtained is utilized for controlling the opening and closing of the slide door attached to the side of a vehicle in accordance with an inclination of the vehicle.</p>

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
    <p num="20">
      FIG. 1 is a perspective view showing an external appearance of a motor vehicle incorporating an open/close control system for a vehicle slide door which is constructed according to the present invention.
      <br/>
      As shown, a slide door 3 is mounted on the side of a vehicle body 1 while being longitudinally slidable for its opening and closing.
      <br/>
      FIG. 2 is an enlarged, perspective view showing the vehicle body 1 when the slide door (indicated by a chain line) is removed.
      <br/>
      FIG. 3 is a perspective view showing the slide door 3 alone.
    </p>
    <p num="21">
      In those figures, the slide door 3 is mounted on the vehicle body 1 while being longitudinally slidable in the following way.
      <br/>
      An upper sliding coupler 31 is fastened on the upper end of the inner side of the slide door 3, and a lower sliding coupler 32 is fastened on the lower end of the door inner side.
      <br/>
      An upper track 12 is provided along the upper edge of an door opening portion 11 of the vehicle body 1, and a lower track 13 is provided along the lower edge thereof.
      <br/>
      The upper sliding coupler 31 and the lower sliding coupler 32 are coupled with the upper track 12 and the lower track 13, respectively.
    </p>
    <p num="22">
      A hinge arm 33 is mounted on the rear end of the inner side of the slide door 3.
      <br/>
      A guide track 14 is fastened to a portion near the waist of the rear part of the vehicle body 1.
      <br/>
      The slide door 3 is guided along the guide track 14 in a state that the hinge arm 33 is slidably engaged with the guide track 14.
      <br/>
      The slide door 3 is moved from a closed position to an open position, while being protruded slightly outward from the outer panel of the vehicle body 1 and in parallel with the outer surface of the outer panel of the vehicle body 1.
      <br/>
      At the closed position, the door opening portion 11 is tightly closed with the slide door, and at the open position the door opening portion 11 is fully opened.
    </p>
    <p num="23">
      Further, the slide door 3 is held at the full close position at the certain closed state so that a door lock 34 provided in the end portion of the opening engages with a striker fixed on a side of the vehicle body 1 at the full close position.
      <br/>
      A door handle 35 is mounted on the outer surface of the slide door 3.
      <br/>
      The door handle is used for manually opening and closing the slide door 3.
    </p>
    <p num="24">
      As shown in FIG. 4, a slide door drive mechanism 5 is provided in a space between the outer and inner panels of the vehicle body 1.
      <br/>
      The outer panel demarcates the outside of the vehicle body 1, and the inner panel is located within the vehicle.
      <br/>
      In the slide door drive mechanism 5, a cable 51, which is disposed within the guide track 14, is coupled with the slide door 3 and a motor.
      <br/>
      In operation, the slide door 3 is moved for its opening and closing by the cable 51, which is moved by the motor.
    </p>
    <p num="25">
      In the present embodiment, either open/close switches attached to the inside of the vehicle or a wireless remote switch 9 (FIG. 1) is selectively used for generating open and close instructions.
      <br/>
      The construction for the open/close instruction generation will be described subsequently.
    </p>
    <p num="26">
      FIG. 5 is a perspective view showing a principal portion of a slide door drive mechanism.
      <br/>
      As shown, the slide door drive mechanism 5 includes a drive means 52.
      <br/>
      The drive means 52 includes an open/close motor 54, a drive pulley 55, and a reduction means 57, these being all fastened onto a base plate 53 that is fixed to within the vehicle body 1 by means of bolts, for example.
      <br/>
      The open/close motor 54 is reversible and operates to open and close the slide door.
      <br/>
      The cable 51 is wound on the drive pulley 55.
      <br/>
      The reduction means 57 contains an electromagnetic clutch 56 therein.
    </p>
    <p num="27">
      The drive pulley 55 includes a reduction mechanism whose rotation transmission force is reversible; it reduces the number of revolutions of the open/close motor 54, and increases an output torque; and it transmits a turning effort of the motor to the cable member 51.
      <br/>
      The electromagnetic clutch 56 is magnetically excited at proper timings when the motor 54 is driven, to thereby couple the motor 54 with the drive pulley 55 mechanically.
    </p>
    <p num="28">
      A pair of guide pulleys 58 are provided on the rear side of the guide track 14.
      <br/>
      An upper channel 14a and a lower channel 14b are formed in the guide track 14 while being parallel to each other.
      <br/>
      The upper channel 14a is shaped like U while being opened outward.
      <br/>
      A reversal pulley 59 is provided at the front end of the guide track 14.
      <br/>
      The cable 51 is wound at one end around the drive pulley 55 and at the other end around the reversal pulley 59 in an endless fashion.
      <br/>
      The upper cable of the endless cable 51 is put at the mid point on the guide pulleys 58 and passes through the upper channel 14a of the guide track 14, while the lower cable thereof is put at the mid point on the guide pulleys 58 and passes through the lower channel 14b.
    </p>
    <p num="29">
      A moving member 36 is secured to an appropriate position of the upper cable of the endless cable 51, which travels through the upper channel 14a of the guide track 14.
      <br/>
      The moving member 36 is secured so as to secure its smooth travelling through the upper channel 14a.
      <br/>
      The fore part of the upper cable with respect to the moving member 36 serves as a door-opening cable 51a, while the rear part of the same serves as a door-closing cable 51b.
    </p>
    <p num="30">
      The moving member 36 is coupled with the rear end of the inner side of the slide door 3 through the hinge arm 33.
      <br/>
      It is moved forward or backward within the upper channel 14a by a pulling force of the door-opening cable 51a or the door-closing cable 51b to thereby move the slide door 3 in the door closing or opening direction.
      <br/>
      An opening/closing mechanism (slide door drive mechanism 5) is constituted by the aforementioned parts.
    </p>
    <p num="31">
      A rotary encoder 60 as movement signal generating means is coupled with the rotary shaft of the drive pulley 55.
      <br/>
      The rotary encoder measures a rotation angle of the rotary shaft at a high resolution.
      <br/>
      With a turn of the drive pulley 55, the rotary encoder 60 generates a pulse signal containing the number of pulses that depends on an rotation angle of the drive pulley 55.
      <br/>
      The pulse signal represents an amount of the movement of the cable 51 that is wound on the drive pulley 55, viz., an amount of the movement of the slide door 3.
      <br/>
      The number of pulses that are generated from the rotary encoder 60 are counted over a range from the closed position of the slide door 3 to the open position, by a proper counter (not shown).
      <br/>
      Then, a count N of the counter represents a current position of the moving member 36, viz., a current position of the slide door 3.
    </p>
    <p num="32">
      FIG. 6 is a plan view schematically showing a movement of the slide door.
      <br/>
      As already stated, the upper sliding coupler 31 and the lower sliding coupler 32 are slidably coupled with the upper track 12 and the lower track 13, respectively, to thereby hold the fore part of the slide door 3.
      <br/>
      The hinge arm 33 is secured to the cable 51 through the moving member 36, to thereby hold the rear part of the slide door 3.
    </p>
    <p num="33">
      FIG. 7 is a perspective view showing a full-open check mechanism provided on the lower-track 13.
      <br/>
      The full-open check mechanism includes a full-open check member 13a.
      <br/>
      The full-open check member 13a has a plate spring member shaped like a V of which one side is steeply slanted and the other side is gently slanted.
      <br/>
      The full-open check member 13a is put in a hole 13c of the lower track 13, and the gently slanted side of the V-shaped full-open check member 13a is secured, in a cantilever fashion, to the lower track 13.
      <br/>
      The hole 13c is formed in the upper end face 13b of the opening of the lower track 13 as shown.
    </p>
    <p num="34">
      When the slide door 3 is moved rearward from a position shown, a vertical roller 32a rotates on the bottom surface 13d of the lower track 13, while a horizontal roller 32b rotates in contact with the inner surface of the upper end face 13b.
      <br/>
      The vertical roller 32a and the horizontal roller 32b are coupled with the slide door 3 through the lower sliding coupler 32.
    </p>
    <p num="35">
      When the horizontal roller 32b reaches the full-open check member 13a, it pushes aside or outward the gently slanted side of the full-open check member 13a and reaches the full open check position.
      <br/>
      At the full open check position, a movement of the horizontal roller 32b in closing direction is blocked by the steeply slanted side of the full-open check member 13a, and therefore the slide door 3 is held at the full open check position.
      <br/>
      At this time, the steeply slanted side of the full-open check member 13a is slightly slanted.
      <br/>
      Therefore, if a strong force is applied to the door, the horizontal roller 32b pushes outward the steeply slanted side of the full-open check member 13a and moves forward.

      A phase relationship between both the speed signals V PHI 1 and V PHI 2 is used for detecting the direction of rotation of the rotary encoder 60, i.e., the direction of movement of the slide door 3.
      <br/>
      Specifically, when the pulse signal  PHI 2 is in a low (L) level at the leading edge of the pulse signal  PHI 1 (as illustrated), the slide door control unit 7 judges that the door is moving in its opening direction; when it is in a high (H) level at the same time point, the control unit judges that the slide door is moving in its closing direction.

    <p num="48">
      The speed calculating portion 78 generates an interrupt pulse g1 at the leading edge of the speed signal V PHI 1.
      <br/>
      During the period of the interrupt pulse g1, the speed calculating portion 78 counts the number of clock pulses C1 the period of which is much shorter than that of the interrupt pulse g1.
      <br/>
      A count value gained is used as a period count value T. Therefore, the period count value T is equivalent to a digitized value of the period of the pulse signal  PHI 1 output from the rotary encoder 60.

      The open/close control system under discussion is designed so as to recognize a speed of the slide door 3 on the basis of the period count value of four successive periods of the speed signal V PHI 1.

      For this reason, four period registers 1 to 4 are included for storing the period count values of four periods.

      How the slide door control unit 7 performs opening and closing controls for the slide door 3 in the open/close control system thus constructed will be described with reference to flow charts shown in FIGS. 11 to 14. Those controls are valid under when following conditions are satisfied: the main switch 18 has been turned on and power source voltage has been supplied to various circuit components and units including the slide door control unit 7; the parking switch 17 has been turned on and a shift position has been set at a P (parking) range, viz., the vehicle is standstill; it has been sensed by speed sensor 23; and the door lock knob has been operated for its unlocking and the slide door 3 is ready for opening.
      <br/>
      When any of those conditions is not satisfied, a manual open/close operation is permitted, but the automatic opening/closing control for the slide door is not performed.
    </p>
    <p num="58">An automatic door opening control will be described with reference to the flow charts shown in FIGS. 11 and 12. In the opening control, an instruction to open the slide door is given by the door open switch 19 or the wireless remote switch 9, and the slide door 3 is moved up to the full open position.</p>
    <p num="59">
      The automatic door opening control starts when the slide door control unit 7 receives a door open signal DO or a remote door-open signal RO.

      In this control mode, the slide door control unit 7 obtains a current position of the slide door 3 by utilization of a position count value N (step S10), and judges whether or not the door is at the full open position (step S11).

      <br/>
      If it is not at a position before the full-open check position (step S13), the control unit judges whether the door is at the full close position or a half-latch position (step S13).
      <br/>
      If the door is at the full close position or a half-latch position, the control unit checks if the closure motor (CM) 38 has terminated its operation (step S14); if the answer is YES (terminated), the control unit drives the actuator (ACTR) 39 and pulls the door lock 34 from the striker 25 (step S15); and the control unit confirms that the half latch switch 40 is in an off state and judges if the slide door 3 is in a half-latch state (step S16).

      Subsequently, the control unit controls the number of revolutions of the open/close motor 54 through the control of the power switch element 88 so that the slide door 3 is moved at a proper speed in the opening direction (step S29).

      Through the control, the control unit detects if something to obstruct the movement of the slide door 3 is caught by the door (step S30).
      <br/>
      During the control, if the control unit detects that the slide door 3 reaches the before-full-open check position (step S31), it stops the open/close motor 54 through the power switch element 88 (step S32), and controls the clutch drive circuit 91 to declutch the electromagnetic clutch 56 and to thereby remove the mechanical coupling of the open/close motor 54 with the drive pulley 55 (step S33).

      When pulse signals  PHI 1 and  PHI 2 are generated, the control unit judges whether the slide door 3 moves in the opening or closing direction on the basis of a phase relationship (step S40); if the door moves in the opening direction (step S40), the control unit judge that the vehicle is on the upward sloping-road; and it sets a upward sloping road flag (step S41), and ends the control process.

      If the door moves in the closing direction, the control unit judges that the vehicle is on the downward sloping-road and sets an downward sloping-road flag (step S42).

      And to prevent the slide door 3 from moving in the closing direction by its weight, the control unit controls the clutch drive circuit 91 again to drive the electromagnetic clutch 56 to couple the open/close motor 54 with the drive pulley 55 (step S43), and it controls the power switch element 88 and the polarity reversing circuit 89 to turn the open/close motor 54 in the door opening direction (step S44).

    <p num="70">In turn, the slide door 3 moves in the opening direction again; the sliding coupler 32 moves over the full-open check member 13a and passes a full-open check position (step S45); the control unit controls the power switch element 88 to stop the turn of the open/close motor 54 (step S46); it controls the clutch drive circuit 91 to remove the coupling of the open/close motor 54 with the drive pulley 55 by the electromagnetic clutch 56 (step S47); and it ends the control process.</p>
    <p num="71">
      In this way, the open/close control system of the invention controls a stop position of the slide door 3 on the basis of an inclination of the vehicle body.

      In other words, the slide door does not move over the full-open check member 13a.

      On the other hand, when the vehicle is on a downward sloping-road, the slide door 3 is moved over the full-open check member 13a and then is stopped.

      <br/>
      Specifically, the control unit judges that something stands in the moving path of the slide door 1) if a current value I detected by the current detector 86 is large, and 2) if the relative periods of the speed signals V PHI 1 and V PHI 2 stop or remarkably decelerate the drive pulley 55 even though the current is fed to the open/close motor 54.

      In the above-mentioned embodiments, the detection of an inclination of the vehicle body is carried out at the before full-open check position when the open/close control system is in the automatic door opening control mode.

    <p num="122">
      As seen from the foregoing description, the motor is temporarily stopped when the opening and closing operations of the slide door is under control, and the electromagnetic clutch is instantaneously turned off to allow the slide door to be movable.
      <br/>
      In this state, a movement of the slide door caused by its weight is observed, and a vertical inclination of the vehicle body with respect to the axial direction of the vehicle body is detected on the basis of the result of the door movement observation.

      The movement of the door by its weight may be detected by utilization of a sensor or device, e.g., a rotary encoder for detecting door moving speed and door position.
