      <br/>
      Field of the Invention
    </p>
    <p num="2">The present invention relates to an alkaline battery separator, i.e., a separator for an alkaline battery, and a process for producing the same.</p>
    <p num="3">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
    <p num="4">An alkaline battery separator composed of a hydro-entangled nonwoven fabric containing fine fibers derived from dividable composite fibers has many fine voids formed between the fine fibers, and accordingly has an excellent electrolyte-holding capacity.</p>
    <p num="5">
      For example, Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication (Kokai) No. 7-147154 discloses an alkaline battery separator prepared by imparting a hydrophilic property to a hydro-entangled nonwoven fabric composed of polyolefin fibers, which are mainly fine fibers, derived from polyolefin dividable composite fibers, and an alkaline battery separator prepared by adhering the hydro-entangled nonwoven fabric with polyolefin heat-sensitive-adhesive fibers having a lower melting point.
      <br/>
      The alkaline battery separators composed of mainly fine fibers derived from the dividable composite fibers have an excellent electrolyte-holding capacity.
      <br/>
      Further, the alkaline battery separator adhered with the polyolefin heat-sensitive-adhesive fibers has an excellent tensile strength.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      Nevertheless, the breaking strength of the alkaline battery separators disclosed in Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication (Kokai) No. 7-147154 is insufficient.
      <br/>
      For example, when the alkaline battery separators are rolled together with electrode plates upon assembling an alkaline battery, the separators are easily broken by the edges of the electrode plates.
      <br/>
      The separators also have the disadvantages of a low yield and an inconsistent battery performance.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      Further, Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication (Kokai) No. 7-29561 discloses an alkaline battery separator composed of wet-laid hydro-entangled nonwoven fabric prepared by hydro-entangling (1) 60 to 80% by weight of dividable composite fibers (fiber length=5-15 mm) consisting of polyolefin polymer and ethylene vinyl alcohol polymer, (2) 20 to 30% by weight of heat-sensitive-adhesive fibers, and (3) 10-20% by weight of synthetic fibers (fiber length=5-15 mm) having a denier larger than those of fine fibers derived from the dividable composite fibers and the heat-sensitive-adhesive fibers.
      <br/>
      The alkaline battery separator has an excellent electrolyte-holding capacity and tensile strength, but the hydrophilic nature of the alkaline battery separator is imparted only by the dividable composite fibers.
      <br/>
      Therefore, it is necessary to raise the ratio of the dividable composite fibers, and thus, the ratio of the synthetic fibers having a denier larger than those of the fine fibers and heat-sensitive-adhesive fibers is lower.
      <br/>
      As a result, some alkaline battery separators have an insufficient breaking strength.
    </p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="8">Accordingly, the object of the present invention is to provide an alkaline battery separator having an excellent breaking strength, as well as practically sufficient tensile strength and electrolyte-holding capacity properties.</p>

    <heading>DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
    <p num="14">
      The polyolefin dividable composite fiber which may be used for the alkaline battery separator according to the present invention is composed of two or more polyolefin resin components which are orientated almost in parallel with a lengthwise direction of the composite fiber, in such a manner that the different resin components are brought into contact with each other.
      <br/>
      The polyolefin dividable composite fiber may be divided into fine fibers of different resin components by a treatment with a water jet or the like.
    </p>
    <p num="15">
      The arrangement of the resin components in the polyolefin dividable composite fiber which may be used for the alkaline battery separator of the present invention is not limited.
      <br/>
      Examples of the arrangement of resin components will be described with reference to the drawings, when the polyolefin dividable composite fiber which may be used in the present invention is composed of two resin components.
      <br/>
      FIGS. 1 and 2 illustrate a polyolefin dividable composite fiber 1 which is composed of a polyolefin resin component 11 and a different polyolefin resin component 12 and has a cross-sectional structure wherein the components are divided by straight (FIG. 1) or curved (FIG. 2) lines radiating from the center portion; FIGS. 3 and 4 illustrate a polyolefin dividable composite fiber 1 which is composed of a polyolefin resin component 11 and a different polyolefin resin component 12 and has a cross-sectional structure wherein the components are divided by straight (FIG. 3) or curved (FIG. 4) lines radiating from the center portion, and one of the polyolefin resin components 11 and 12 is located in the center portion; and FIG. 5 illustrate a polyolefin dividable composite fiber 1 having a cross-sectional structure wherein polyolefin resin components 11 and 12 are laminated.
      <br/>
      The polyolefin dividable composite fibers having the cross-sectional structures as shown in FIGS. 1 to 4 are preferable, because of a uniformity in the diameter of the fine fibers derived therefrom.
    </p>
    <p num="16">
      The polyolefin resin components of the polyolefin dividable composite fiber may be, for example, polyethylene, polypropylene, ethylene-propylene copolymer, ethylene-butene-propylene copolymer, or ethylene-vinyl alcohol copolymer.
      <br/>
      The polyolefin dividable composite fiber may contain two or more polyolefin resin components and one or more other resin components, particularly only two or more polyolefin resin components.
      <br/>
      The combination of the polyolefin resin components is not limited, but the combination of polyethylene and polypropylene is preferable, and the combination of high-density polyethylene and polypropylene is more preferable, because of an excellent resistance to alkalis and acids thus are provided.
      <br/>
      The polyolefin dividable composite fiber containing ethylene-vinyl alcohol copolymer as one of the polyolefin resin components can enhance electrolyte-holding capacity, adsorbability of oxygen in an overcharged state, and thus, performance with respect to an internal pressure of the battery.
      <br/>
      It is preferable to combine ethylene-vinyl alcohol copolymer, which enhances the internal pressure performance, with polypropylene having an excellent resistance to alkalis.
    </p>
    <p num="17">
      An average fiber length (prior to division) of the polyolefin dividable composite fiber which may be used for the alkaline battery of the present invention is 20 to 60 mm, preferably 25 to 45 mm.
      <br/>
      When the average fiber length is less than 20 mm, some fibers may be broken when a fiber web is formed, or fine fibers cannot always be sufficiently entangled, and thus a sufficient tensile strength cannot always be obtained.
      <br/>
      When the average fiber length is more than 60 mm, the formation of a uniform fiber web becomes difficult, or sometimes even the formation of a fiber web becomes difficult.
      <br/>
      The term "average fiber length" used herein with regard to the fibers, such as the polyolefin dividable composite fiber, means a mean value of fiber lengths of 100 fibers, such as 100 polyolefin dividable composite fibers, randomly sampled.
      <br/>
      The fiber length of the polyolefin dividable composite fiber is not changed after the division, and thus the average fiber length thereof is not changed after the division.
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      An average fiber diameter of the polyolefin dividable composite fiber which may be used for the alkaline battery of the present invention is not limited, but may be determined in accordance with the desired average fiber diameter of the fine fibers derived therefrom.
      <br/>
      The term "average fiber diameter" used herein with regard to the fibers, such as the fine fiber, means a mean value of fiber diameters of 100 fibers, such as 100 fine fibers, randomly sampled.
      <br/>
      The diameter of the fiber, such as the fine fiber, having a non-circular cross-sectional shape, means a diameter of a fiber having a circular cross-sectional shape with an area the same as the non-circular cross-sectional area thereof.
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      The average fiber diameter of the fine fiber is not limited, but is preferably 1 to 10  MU m, more preferably 2 to 7  MU m. When the average fiber diameter is less than 1  MU m, division of the polyolefin dividable composite fiber may sometimes be insufficient.
      <br/>
      When the average fiber diameter is more than 10  MU m, a sufficient electrolyte-holding capacity cannot always be obtained.
    </p>
    <p num="20">
      The content of the polyolefin dividable composite fibers which may be used for the alkaline battery of the present invention is not limited.
      <br/>
      The polyolefin dividable composite fibers may account for 30 to 60 mass %, preferably 35 to 55 mass %, more preferably 40 to 50 mass % with respect to a total mass of the polyolefin dividable composite fibers, the high-strength fibers and the polyolefin heat-sensitive-adhesive fibers.
      <br/>
      When the content is less than 30 mass %, a sufficient electrolyte-holding capacity cannot always be obtained.
      <br/>
      When the content is more than 60 mass %, the ratios of other fibers drop, and thus the tensile and the breaking strengths may be lowered.
      <br/>
      When the polyolefin dividable composite fiber containing ethylene-vinyl alcohol copolymer is used, such a polyolefin dividable composite fiber preferably accounts for 5 to 40 mass %, more preferably 5 to 35 mass %, most preferably 10 to 30 mass %, with respect to a total mass of the polyolefin dividable composite fibers, the high-strength fibers and the polyolefin heat-sensitive-adhesive fibers.
      <br/>
      When the content is more than 40 mass %, a resistance to alkalis may be lowered.
    </p>
    <p num="21">
      The high-strength fiber which may be used for the alkaline battery of the present invention is not limited, as long as the average fiber length is 30 to 60 mm, preferably 35 to 45 mm, and the fiber strength, i.e., the tensile strength of fiber, is 5 g/denier or more, preferably 7 g/denier or more, more preferably 9 g/denier or more.
      <br/>
      As the high-strength fiber, general-purpose synthetic fibers, such as polypropylene, polyethylene, or polyamide, may be used.
      <br/>
      Polypropylene may be preferably used, because of a long-term resistance to alkalis and acids, surface modifiability, fiber performance or the like.
      <br/>
      The fiber strength (the tensile strength of fiber) is measured in accordance with JIS (Japanese Industrial Standard) L1015, a testing method for man-made staple fibers.
    </p>
    <p num="22">
      When the average fiber length is less than 30 mm, fibers may be insufficiently entangled, and a sufficient break strength cannot always be obtained.
      <br/>
      When the average fiber length is more than 60 mm, a fiber web may be difficult to form.
    </p>
    <p num="23">When the fiber strength is less than 5 g/denier, a sufficient break strength cannot always be obtained.</p>
    <p num="24">
      An average fiber diameter of the high-strength fiber is not limited, but preferably 8 to 30  MU m, more preferably 12 to 25  MU m. When the average fiber diameter is less than 8  MU m, a fiber web may be difficult to form.
      <br/>
      When the average fiber diameter is more than 30  MU m, the number of the high-strength fibers is decreased, and therefore, the break strength may be lowered or the thickness may be difficult to adjust.
    </p>
    <p num="25">It is preferable to use an ultra-high-strength polyethylene fiber having the fiber strength of 25 g/denier or more, more preferably 30 g/denier or more, as the high-strength fiber, because such an ultra-high-strength polyethylene fiber has also an excellent elasticity, and therefore, the separator may effectively avoid breakages caused by a tension applied during the assembly of the battery, a short circuit caused between electrodes via an electrode flash which breaks through the separator from one electrode to another electrode, or tearing by an electrode edge.</p>

      <br/>
      As the polyolefin adhesive portion, there may be used, for example, polyethylene, polypropylene, ethylene-propylene copolymer, or ethylene-butene-propylene copolymer.

      Low density polyethylene is preferable, because it has a low melting point and does not affect other fibers.

      As the wholly fusible fiber, there may be mentioned, for example, polyethylene or polypropylene fibers.

When the average fiber diameter is less than 12  MU m, the formation of a fiber web may become difficult.
      <br/>
      When the average fiber diameter is more than 25  MU m, the number of heat-sensitive-adhesive fibers is decreased, and the number of fused sites is decreased, and thus the tensile strength sometimes is lowered.

      The content of the polyolefin heat-sensitive-adhesive fibers which may be used for the alkaline battery of the present invention is not limited.

    <p num="33">The alkaline battery of the present invention is composed of a hydrophilic nonwoven fabric which may be produced, for example, by the following process.</p>
    <p num="34">The polyolefin dividable composite fibers, the high-strength fibers and the polyolefin heat-sensitive-adhesive fibers are substantially uniformly mixed to form a fiber web; the resulting fiber web is subjected to heat-fusion and hydro-entangling treatments in any sequence, to obtain a heat-fused and hydro-entangled nonwoven fabric; and a hydrophilic property is imparted to the resulting heat-fused and hydro-entangled nonwoven fabric to obtain the hydrophilic nonwoven fabric.</p>
    <p num="35">
      The fiber web may be formed, preferably by a dry-laid method.
      <br/>
      The dry-laid method may be a conventional method such as a carding or air-laid method.
      <br/>
      The constitutional fibers may be uniformly mixed by the dry-laid method.
      <br/>
      In the dry-laid method, longer fibers may be used as the constitutional fibers and therefore an excellent entanglement may be achieved and a high tensile strength obtained.
    </p>
    <p num="36">
      In the step of forming the fiber web, it is preferable to prevent the polyolefin dividable composite fibers from dividing, and to prevent the polyolefin heat-sensitive-adhesive fibers from fusing.
      <br/>
      In general, however, it is very difficult to uniformly card the polyolefin dividable composite fibers, the high-strength fibers and the polyolefin heat-sensitive-adhesive fibers used in the present invention, in the dry-laid method.
      <br/>
      For example, if the polyolefin dividable composite fibers, particularly the polyolefin dividable composite fibers capable of producing fine fibers having a diameter of 1 to 10  MU m, are simply carded in the dry-laid method, the fibers are divided and entangled to sometimes result in obtaining only a fiber web having an unsatisfactory texture or figure.
      <br/>
      Further, if the polyolefin heat-sensitive-adhesive fibers are simply carded in the dry-laid method, the fibers are fused by frictional heat and pressure to sometimes result in obtaining only a fiber web having an unsatisfactory texture or figure.
      <br/>
      The high-strength fibers have a high strength and a high stiffness.
      <br/>
      Therefore, if the high-strength fibers are simply carded in the dry-laid method, fiber lumps are liable to be produced to sometimes result in obtaining only a fiber web having an unsatisfactory texture or figure.
    </p>
    <p num="37">
      In the preferable embodiment of the process of the present invention, the carding of the fibers is carried out after adding a lubricating oil to the fibers, and a fiber web having an excellent texture or figure can be formed in the dry-laid method.
      <br/>
      The amount of lubricating oil added is preferably 0.5 to 3 mass %, more preferably 0.6 to 2 mass %, with respect to a total mass of the fibers.
      <br/>
      When the amount of lubricating oil added is less than 0.5 mass %, a sufficient enhancement of the carding workability cannot always be obtained.
      <br/>
      When the amount of lubricating oil added is more than 3 mass %, it sometimes becomes difficult to obtain a fiber web.
      <br/>
      The lubricating oil which may be used in the present invention is not limited, as long as it can achieve the desired purpose, but preferably an anionic lubricating oil, such as polyethylene glycol ester of a higher aliphatic acid, is used.
    </p>
    <p num="38">
      Then the resulting fiber web may be optionally pre-fused as a part of the fusing step, or as a pre-treatment independently of the fusing step.
      <br/>
      The resulting fiber web, without or with pre-fusion, is hydro-entangled, whereby the polyolefin dividable composite fibers are divided into fine fibers composed of each resin component, and at the same time, the polyolefin dividable composite fibers and/or the fine fibers derived therefrom are entangled with the high-strength fibers and the polyolefin heat-sensitive-adhesive fibers to obtain a hydro-entangled nonwoven fabric or a pre-fused and hydro-entangled nonwoven fabric.
      <br/>
      When the fiber web is pre-fused before hydro-entangling, the fibers in the fiber web are tentatively fused to each other, and therefore, the movement of the polyolefin dividable composite fibers is more or less limited and the polyolefin dividable composite fibers can be easily divided.
    </p>
    <p num="39">
      The hydro-entangling conditions are not particularly limited, but the hydro-entangling may be carried out under conventional conditions.
      <br/>
      For example, a nozzle plate containing one or more lines of nozzles having a diameter of 0.05 to 0.3 mm and a pitch of 0.2 to 3 mm may be used with a water jet under a pressure of 1 to 30 MPa.
      <br/>
      The hydro-entangling treatment may be carried out once, twice, or more times, if necessary, to one side or both sides of the web.
      <br/>
      If the fiber web is hydro-entangled on a support, such as a net or a perforated panel containing large pores, the resulting hydro-entangled nonwoven fabric also has large pores.
      <br/>
      The alkaline battery containing such a nonwoven fabric is liable to cause a short circuit.
      <br/>
      Therefore, it is preferable to uses a square-weave or plain weave fabric net having fine pores (for example, 50 mesh or more), or a perforated panel having a pore-to-pore distance of 0.4 mm or less.
    </p>
    <p num="40">
      The heat-fusing can be carried out by heating the fiber web or the hydro-entangled nonwoven fabric at a temperature which is higher than a melting point of the polyolefin adhesive portion in the polyolefin heat-sensitive-adhesive fibers, but lower than a melting point of the polyolefin dividable composite fiber, and lower than a melting point of the high-strength fiber.
      <br/>
      The heat-fusing can be carried out once, or more times, if necessary.
      <br/>
      When the heat-fusing is carried out two or more times, each treatment may be conducted under the same conditions, or partially or wholly different conditions.
      <br/>
      When the heat-fusing is carried out two or more times, a first fusing step corresponds to, or two or more steps with a first fusing step but without a final fusing step correspond to, the pre-fusing treatment.
      <br/>
      When the high-strength fiber used contains the ultra-high-strength polyethylene fiber, the heat-fusing is preferably carried out at a temperature below a softening point of the ultra-high-strength polyethylene fiber, for example below 125 (degree)  C.
    </p>
    <p num="41">
      The sequence of the heat-fusing treatment and the hydro-entangling treatment is not specified.
      <br/>
      The heat-fused and hydro-entangled nonwoven fabric can be obtained by carrying out one treatment, and subsequently the other treatment, or one treatment and then the other treatment, and thereafter, the first treatment under the same conditions or partially or wholly different conditions.
      <br/>
      For example, it is preferable to carry out the first pre-fusing treatment, then the hydro-entangling treatment, and thereafter the heat-fusing treatment, because the polyolefin dividable composite fibers in the pre-fused web can be then easily divided, and the tensile strength and stiffness can be enhanced in the second fusing treatment.
    </p>
    <p num="42">The resulting heat-fused and hydro-entangled nonwoven fabric is fused with the polyolefin heat-sensitive-adhesive fibers, and thus has a high tensile strength and stiffness.</p>

      The hydrophilic nonwoven fabric which may be used as the alkaline battery separator according to the present invention can be obtained by imparting a hydrophilic property to the heat-fused and hydro-entangled nonwoven fabric.
      <br/>
      The treatment used for imparting a hydrophilic property may be a sulfonating treatment, a treatment with fluorine gas, a graft polymerization treatment with vinyl monomers, a treatment with a surface-active agent, a treatment used to adhere hydrophilic resins, a discharging treatment, or the like.
    </p>
    <p num="44">
      The sulfonating treatment contains, for example, but is not limited to, a treatment with fuming sulfuric acid, sulfuric acid, sulfur trioxide, chlorosulfuric acid, sulfuryl chloride, or the like.
      <br/>
      Of these treatments, the sulfonating treatment with fuming sulfuric acid is preferable, because of a high reactivity and an easier sulfonation obtained.
    </p>
    <p num="45">
      The treatment with fluorine gas contains, for example, but is not limited to, a treatment with a gas mixture of fluorine gas diluted with an inactive gas (such as nitrogen or argon gas) and at least one gas selected from a group consisting of oxygen, carbon dioxide and sulfur dioxide gases.
      <br/>
      The hydrophilic property can be effectively and permanently imparted by adsorbing sulfur dioxide gas to the heat-fused and hydro-entangled nonwoven fabric, and then bringing the fabric into contact with fluorine gas.
    </p>
    <p num="46">
      Examples of the vinyl monomer which may be used in the graft polymerization treatment are acrylic acid, methacrylic acid, acrylate, methacrylate, vinyl pyridine, vinyl pyrrolidone, styrene, or the like.
      <br/>
      When styrene is grafted, it is preferable to further carry out the sulfonation treatment to impart an affinity to the electrolyte.
      <br/>
      Acrylic acid has a good affinity with an electrode and may be preferably used.
    </p>
    <p num="47">
      The vinyl monomers can be polymerized, for example, by dipping the heat-fused and hydro-entangled nonwoven fabric in a solution containing the vinyl monomers and an initiator, and heating; by coating vinyl monomers on the heat-fused and hydro-entangled nonwoven fabric and applying radiation; by applying radiation to the heat-fused and hydro-entangled nonwoven fabric and then bringing the fabric into contact with the vinyl monomers; by impregnating the heat-fused and hydro-entangled nonwoven fabric with a solution containing vinyl monomers and a sensitizing agent, and applying ultraviolet rays.
      <br/>
      The graft polymerization can be effectively carried out by treating the surface of the heat-fused and hydro-entangled nonwoven fabric with ultraviolet radiation, a corona discharge or a plasma discharge before bringing the nonwoven fabric into contact with the vinyl monomer solution, to enhance the affinity with the vinyl monomer solution and easily generate radicals through polar hydrophilic groups produced in the pre-treatment.
      <br/>
      The graft polymerization treatment with vinyl monomers can be carried out under mild conditions in comparison with the sulfonation treatment, and the treatment per se has very little affect on the fiber strength, and therefore, is preferable in view of the fiber strength.
    </p>
    <p num="48">The treatment with a surface-active agent may be carried out by applying, for example, spraying or coating, a solution of an anionic surface-active agent (such as an alkali metal salt of a higher fatty acid, alkyl sulfonate, or a salt of sulfosuccinate) or a nonionic surface-active agent (such as polyoxyethylene alkyl ether, or polyoxyethylene alkylphenol ether) to the heat-fused and hydro-entangled nonwoven fabric, or dipping the nonwoven fabric in the solution.</p>
    <p num="49">
      The treatment by which a hydrophilic property is imparted can be carried out by adhering hydrophilic resins, such as carboxymethyl cellulose, polyvinyl alcohol, or polyacrylic acid, to the heat-fused and hydro-entangled nonwoven fabric.
      <br/>
      The hydrophilic resins may be adhered to the nonwoven fabric by spraying or coating a solution or dispersion of the hydrophilic resins in an appropriate solvent or dispersant, or dipping the nonwoven fabric in the solution or dispersion, and then drying.

    <p num="50">
      Further, the treatment by which a hydrophilic property is imparted can be conducted by adhering cross-linked polyvinyl alcohols to the nonwoven fabric.

      <br/>
      This is not only because they have an excellent resistance to alkalis, but also because they contain functional groups, i.e., hydroxyl groups, which can form a chelate with an ion, and thus the functional groups can form chelates with ions before the ions deposit on electrodes in the form of branches, during charging and/or discharging, to thereby effectively prevent a short circuit between the electrodes.
      <br/>
      The amount of hydrophilic resins adhered is preferably 0.3 to 1 mass % with respect to the mass of the separator, so as not to affect the air-permeability.
