    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="1">The present invention relates to a frog target game and more particularly pertains to attempting to throw chips into a frog's mouth in order to score maximum points.</p>
    <p num="2">
      The use of games is known in the prior art.
      <br/>
      More specifically, games heretofore devised and utilized for the purpose of providing amusement are known to consist basically of familiar, expected and obvious structural configurations, notwithstanding the myriad of designs encompassed by the crowded prior art which have been developed for the fulfillment of countless objectives and requirements.
    </p>
    <p num="3">By way of example, U.S. Pat. No. 5,435,570 to Labrasseur discloses a game apparatus using a projectile shaped as an amphibian, such as a frog. U.S. Pat. No. Des. 86,836 to Gibbs, U.S. Pat. No. Des. 160,350 to Vunck, and U.S. Pat. No.Des. 333,492 to Paredes each disclose various ornamental designs for game devices.</p>
    <p num="4">While these devices fulfill their respective, particular objective and requirements, the aforementioned patents do not describe a frog target game for attempting to throw chips into a frog's mouth in order to score maximum points.</p>
    <p num="5">In this respect, the frog target game according to the present invention substantially departs from the conventional concepts and designs of the prior art, and in doing so provides an apparatus primarily developed for the purpose of attempting to throw chips into a frog's mouth in order to score maximum points.</p>
    <p num="6">
      Therefore, it can be appreciated that there exists a continuing need for a new and improved frog target game which can be used for attempting to throw chips into a frog's mouth in order to score maximum points.
      <br/>
      In this regard, the present invention substantially fulfills this need.
    </p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="7">
      In the view of the foregoing disadvantages inherent in the known types of games now present in the prior art, the present invention provides an improved frog target game.
      <br/>
      As such, the general purpose of the present invention, which will be described subsequently in greater detail, is to provide a new and improved frog target game which has all the advantages of the prior art and none of the disadvantages.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      To attain this, the present invention essentially comprises a housing having a generally rectangular configuration.
      <br/>
      The housing has a top wall, a bottom wall, an open front face, a rear wall, and opposed side walls.
      <br/>
      The rear wall extends above the top wall and has a curved upper portion with a cut-out formed therein.
      <br/>
      The opposed side walls each extend above the top wall.
      <br/>
      The housing includes a pair of wheels secured to the opposed side walls inwardly of the rear wall.
      <br/>
      The housing includes a support stand foldably secured to the bottom wall thereof.
      <br/>
      The top wall has a plurality of apertures therethrough in a spaced relationship.
      <br/>
      The plurality of apertures include a central aperture.
      <br/>
      The central aperture has a frog disposed thereover.
      <br/>
      The frog has an open mouth aligned with the central aperture.
      <br/>
      The top wall has a plurality of spinning wheels disposed therein inwardly of the open front face.
      <br/>
      A plurality of chips are provided that are dimensioned for being received within the plurality of apertures of the top wall of the housing.
      <br/>
      A drawer is provided that is dimensioned for being received within the open front face of the housing.
      <br/>
      The drawer is comprised of a front wall, a back wall, opposed side walls, a bottom wall, and an open top.
      <br/>
      The front wall has a handle secured thereto.
      <br/>
      The bottom wall has a plurality of compartments formed therein corresponding with the plurality of apertures of the housing.
      <br/>
      Each of the compartments have an assigned point value.
      <br/>
      The plurality of compartments include a central compartment corresponding with the central aperture of the housing.
      <br/>
      The central compartment has a highest assigned point value.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      There has thus been outlined, rather broadly, the more important features of the invention in order that the detailed description thereof that follows may be better understood, and in order that the present contribution to the art may be better appreciated.
      <br/>
      There are, of course, additional features of the invention that will be described hereinafter and which will form the subject matter of the claims appended hereto.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      In this respect, before explaining at least one embodiment of the invention in detail, it is to be understood that the invention is not limited in its application to the details of construction and to the arrangements of the components set forth in the following description or illustrated in the drawings.
      <br/>
      The invention is capable of other embodiments and of being practiced and carried out in various ways.
      <br/>
      Also, it is to be understood that the phraseology and terminology employed herein are for the purpose of description and should not be regarded as limiting.
    </p>
    <p num="11">
      As such, those skilled in the art will appreciate that the conception, upon which this disclosure is based, may readily be utilized as a basis for the designing of other structures, methods and systems for carrying out the several purposes of the present invention.
      <br/>
