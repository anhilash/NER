    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">
      This invention is directed to the field of shipping, storage and delivery of materials.
      <br/>
      In particular, the invention is directed to a box for storing objects and materials which is capable of being stacked while filled and then collapsed for convenient storage and return shipping when not filled.
    </p>
    <p num="3">
      Various materials and objects require special packaging when shipping.
      <br/>
      These objects can be too small to carry efficiently by themselves or may be too delicate to survive the travails of shipping unprotected.
      <br/>
      This can be particularly true when the objects are transported as freight in trains, planes or ships.
      <br/>
      Due to the nature of these vehicles, a certain amount of jostling is unavoidable.
      <br/>
      Further, skilled laborers are required to load these vehicles.
      <br/>
      Consequently, convenient packaging will reduce the loading and unloading time, thus reducing overall costs.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      While it is important to provide sturdy packaging for transported objects, these containers can themselves create difficulties.
      <br/>
      In particular, the containers often must be returned via the same vehicles.
      <br/>
      Although the vehicles are capable of carrying the weight of a great number of empty containers, the large size of the containers requires a large amount of storage space, restricting the number of containers which can be returned and resulting in the inefficient use of storage space on a return trip.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      Various containers have been developed over the years in an effort to provide a collapsible container for different materials. U.S. Pat. No. 4,742,951 is directed to a container for bulk flowable materials.
      <br/>
      An octagonal-shaped cardboard sleeve is attached to a bottom end cap.
      <br/>
      The adjacent panels of the sleeve are connected along elongate edges.
      <br/>
      A tubular inner member which is designed to withstand the pressure of the contained material is inserted inside the octagonal sleeve.
      <br/>
      A top end cap is attached to the top of the sleeve.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      U.S. Pat. Ser. No. 4,927,026 is directed to pallet box.
      <br/>
      Side walls of a container are hinged to the surface of a pallet.
      <br/>
      A tubular cardboard sleeve is positioned about the side walls and maintains the container shape.
      <br/>
      The container can be formed by criss-crossing panels attached to the pallet.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      U.S. Pat. Ser. No. 5,178,275 is directed to an eight-sided columnar container for supporting bulk materials in sacks.
      <br/>
      An eight-sided collapsible sleeve is mounted to pallet.
      <br/>
      Tabs are positioned along the bottom edge of each side of the container.
      <br/>
      Alternating tabs are bent inward or outward.
      <br/>
      The sacks of materials are disposed within the sleeve and a cap may be positioned on top of the sleeve.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      U.S. Pat. Ser. No. 5,441,154 is directed to a integrated paperboard container and pallet system.
      <br/>
      The wall portion of the container has a polygonal-shaped interior cavity.
      <br/>
      At least one tab is formed at the bottom of one of the walls.
      <br/>
      The deck portion has a planar member with an upper side forming a floor surface and a lower side forming a support surface.
      <br/>
      Edges are mounted to the planar member and have the same polygonal shape as the wall portion.
      <br/>
      Openings are positioned in the planar member to receive any tabs.
      <br/>
      The planar member is designed to be mounted to a pallet, if desired.

    <heading>DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
    <p num="25">
      Referring to FIG. 1, the box 1 of the instant invention includes an upper sleeve 30 attached to a base 9.
      <br/>
      A lid 40 is selectively engaged to the upper sleeve at its top.
      <br/>
      The upper sleeve is composed of a front panel 36 and a rear panel 31 attached by a left side panel 101 and a right side panel 102 (see also, FIG. 2).
      <br/>
      As discussed more fully below, central hinges are provided in the side panels, allowing them to fold in half onto the front and rear panels.
      <br/>
      Consequently, it is preferred that the total length of each side panel does not exceed the length of the rear panel or the front panel.
      <br/>
      In FIG. 1, the box is in an assembled condition, with the upper sleeve open and the lid attached.
      <br/>
      An interior cavity 100 for the storage of material is thus formed within the sleeve between the lid and the base.
      <br/>
      As discussed below with respect to FIGS. 7 and 8, when not in use, the sleeve can be collapsed into the base and the lid attached to the base, enclosing the folded sleeve.
      <br/>
      The base and the lid can then be latched together securely.
    </p>
    <p num="26">
      Preferably, the base 9, upper sleeve 30 and lid 40 are made of a rigid material, such as steel or aluminum.
      <br/>
      Of course, other materials, such as plastic and the like, can be employed and still practice the invention.
      <br/>
      The material should be selected such that the assembled box can withstand the weight of another box and its contained load stacked on the lid.
    </p>
    <p num="27">
      Referring to FIG. 2, the upper sleeve includes a rear panel 31 connected to a front panel 36 by a right side panel 102 and a left side panel 101.
      <br/>
      The rear panel has a rectangular shape with a top edge 311, a bottom edge 310, a left edge 312 and a right edge 313.
      <br/>
      A bottom hinge 316 is attached to the rear panel along the bottom edge.
      <br/>
      As discussed below, the bottom hinge is attached to the rear lip 15 of the base 9.
      <br/>
      The bottom hinge is an interior hinge allowing the rear panel to fold inward onto the base.
      <br/>
      However, as the rear panel is rotated upward, it will engage the rear lip, preventing rotation much beyond a vertical position (i.e., a position perpendicular to the bottom panel 10 of the base).
    </p>
    <p num="28">
      The left side panel 101 has a rectangular shape with a central vertical axis 103 and is composed of a left rear panel 32 and a left front panel 33 which are attached by a left central hinge, such that the left rear panel can fold onto the left front panel about the central axis.
      <br/>
      The left rear panel 32 has a rectangular shape and is attached at its rear edge 320 to the rear panel 31 along the left edge 312 of the rear panel by an internal hinge 314.
      <br/>
      The internal hinge permits the left rear panel to fold onto the rear panel.
      <br/>
      However, as the left rear panel is rotated outward, the rear panel and the right rear panel engage or abut, restricting further rotation.
      <br/>
      Preferably, the internal hinge 314 is positioned to restrict the left rear panel from rotating beyond a position perpendicular to the rear panel.
    </p>
    <p num="29">
      Similarly, the right side panel 102 has a rectangular shape with a central vertical axis 104 and is composed of a right rear panel 34 and a right front panel 35 which are attached by a right central hinge, such that the right rear panel can fold onto the left front panel about the central axis.
      <br/>
      The right rear panel 34 has a rectangular shape and is attached at its rear edge 340 to the rear panel 31 along the right edge 313 of the rear panel by an internal hinge 315.
      <br/>
      Again, the internal hinge 315 restricts the movement of the right rear panel to a perpendicular orientation with respect to the rear panel while permitting the right rear panel 34 to fold flat onto the rear panel 31.
    </p>
    <p num="30">
      The left front panel 33 is attached along its rear edge 330 to the left rear panel 32 along its front edge 321 by an external hinge (not shown).
      <br/>
      The external hinge permits the front and rear left side panels 32, 33 to fold together or "accordion" (see FIG. 7).
      <br/>
      The external hinge is positioned such that it otherwise restricts the movements of the left side panels 32, 33 to a parallel, coplanar position, as shown in FIG. 2.
      <br/>
      In particular, when the left side panels are rotated to a parallel, coplanar position, they abut, preventing further rotation about the external hinge.
    </p>
    <p num="31">
      Similarly, the right front panel 35 is attached along its rear edge 350 to the right rear panel 34 along its front edge 341 by an external hinge 353.
      <br/>
      The external hinge permits the right side panels to fold together (see FIG. 7).
      <br/>
      The external hinge 353 is positioned such that it otherwise restricts the movement of the right side panels 34, 35 to a parallel, coplanar position, as shown in FIG. 2.
      <br/>
      In particular, when the right side panels are rotated to a parallel, coplanar position, they abut, preventing further rotation about the external hinge 353.
    </p>
    <p num="32">
      Referring to FIGS. 5 and 6 as well, the front panel 36 is attached at its left edge 362 to the front edge 331 of the left front panel 33 by an internal hinge 401.
      <br/>
      The front panel is also attached at its left edge 363 to the front edge 351 of the left front panel 35 by an internal hinge 402.
      <br/>
      The internal hinges allow the front side panels 33, 35 to fold flat against the front panel.
      <br/>
      The internal hinges are positioned such that, when the angle between the front panel and each side panel exceeds 90 (degree) , the front panel abuts the side panel, preventing further relative rotation (similar to internal hinges 314 and 315 on the rear panel).
    </p>
    <p num="33">
      Draw latches 362, 365 are attached to the front panel near the bottom edge 360: one at the left side, one at the right side.
      <br/>
      The latches are designed to selectively engage the clips 23, 24 on the base 9, discussed below.
      <br/>
      The latches are preferably external spring latches shown in FIGS. 9A and 9B. Of course, other latches can be employed and practice the invention.
    </p>
    <p num="34">
      The upper sleeve 30 is designed such that the panels can be folded to an open or "assembled" position, thereby forming a tube having a rectangular cross section and defining a central cavity 100.
      <br/>
      As seen in FIG. 7, when the sleeve is not in use, the side panels are folded inward, closing the external hinges 353.
      <br/>
      The rear side panels 32, 34 are folded flat between the front side panels 33, 35, respectively, and the rear panel.
      <br/>
      The front side panels 33, 35 are themselves folded flat against the front panel 36.
      <br/>
      Consequently, the rear panel, the front panel, the rear side panels and the front side panels are all maintained in parallel planes.
    </p>
    <p num="35">
      Referring to FIG. 3, the base 9 includes a bottom panel 10 having a rectangular shape with a rear edge 11, a front edge 14, a left edge 12 and a right edge 13.
      <br/>
      A raised lip 150, composed of a rear lip 15, a front lip 18, a left lip 16 and a right lip 17, extends upward around the periphery of the bottom panel.
      <br/>
      Preferably, the lip forms a water tight seal at the bottom panel, preventing any fluids from leaking between the lip and the bottom panel.
      <br/>
      The lip may be integrally formed with the bottom panel.
    </p>
    <p num="36">
      Channels 21, 22 are mounted to the bottom panel opposite the lip.
      <br/>
      The channels are sized to receive fork lift prongs and the like.
      <br/>
      The channels may have a U-shaped or an L-shaped cross section, as is desired for a particular application.
      <br/>
      Apertures are provided in the channels, as discussed below, which permit locking the channel of one box with the lid 40 of a second box.
      <br/>
      Side bolt latches 600, as shown in FIGS. 10A and 10B, can be attached to the lid.
      <br/>
      The bolts can be selectively engaged to the apertures in the channels.
    </p>
    <p num="37">
      Guide plates 25, 26 are mounted to the base 9 at the front lip 18.
      <br/>
      The guide plates help align the front panel 36 with the front lip.
      <br/>
      The top of the guide plates may be curved outward, away from the bottom panel 10, thereby allowing the guide plates to direct the bottom edge 360 of the front panel downward toward the interior of the front lip.
    </p>
    <p num="38">
      Risers 19, 20 are attached to the bottom panel 10 and the left lip 16 and the right lip 17, respectively.
      <br/>
      The risers prevent the folded panels of the upper sleeve 30 from lying flat on the bottom panel 10.
      <br/>
      Thus, it is easier for a workman to reach in and grasp the sides of the folded panels, rotating them out of the base 9.
    </p>
    <p num="39">
      Referring to FIG. 4, the lid 40includes a top panel 55 having a rectangular shape with rear edge 41, a front edge 44, a left edge 42 and a right edge 23.
      <br/>
      A rim 400 extends around the periphery of the top panel and includes a rear rim 45, a left rim 46, a right rim 47 and a front rim 48.
      <br/>
      Clasps 49-52 are mounted to the rim at the exterior.
      <br/>
      Again, it is preferred that the clasps are external spring draw latches shown in FIGS. 9A and 9B, but other clasps can be employed.
      <br/>
      These clasps are designed to engage clips attached to the front and rear panels.
      <br/>
      Flanges 53-54 are mounted to the top panel and are curved downward and inward.
      <br/>
      When the lid is mounted to the upper sleeve 30, the flanges engage the side panels 32,33 and 34,35, pushing them outward and securing them against the side rims 46, 47.
      <br/>
      This adds stability to the assembled box.
    </p>
    <p num="40">
      When not in use, the box 1 is maintained in a folded and locked position, as seen in FIG. 8.
      <br/>
      The front panel 36 is folded onto the bottom panel 10.
      <br/>
      The side panels 32, 33 and 34, 35 are folded together and disposed between the rear panel 31 and the front panel.
      <br/>
      The lip 150 preferably extends high enough to enclose the folded sleeve 30 completely.
      <br/>
      The lid 40 is secured directly to the base 9 by the clasps 49-52.
      <br/>
      Steel loops 500 may be provided for securing the box during shipping.
      <br/>
      Further, a handle, castors or the like can be provided to make carrying the box easier.
    </p>
    <p num="41">
      To use the box 1, the clasps 49-52 on the lid 40 are released from the clips 23, 24 on the base 9.
      <br/>
      The lid is removed.
      <br/>
      The folded panels are then rotated upward about the bottom interior hinge 316.
      <br/>
      The side panels 101, 102 are then free to "accordion" outward (see FIG. 7), displacing the front panel 36 from the rear panel 31, and creating the central cavity 100.
      <br/>
      Once the rear panel 31 is rotated to a position substantially perpendicular to the bottom panel 10, the rear panel starts to abut the rear lip 15, preventing further rotation.
      <br/>
      The front panel 36 is then displaced forward until it abuts the front lip 18.
      <br/>
      If the front panel is too high, it may pass over the front lip.
      <br/>
      However, the guide plates 25, 26 extend above the front lip.
      <br/>
      Thus, the front panel will engage the guide plates.
      <br/>
      Once engaged, the front panel can be slid along the surface of the guide plates until the bottom edge 360 of the front panel 36 contacts the bottom panel 10.
      <br/>
      Once the front panel is in position, the clasps 364,365 on the front panel are engaged to the clips 23, 24 on the base 9.
      <br/>
      The side panels 32, 33 and 34, 35 will extend along the side lips 17, 18 between the rear panel and the front panel.
      <br/>
      However, at this point, the side panels will be somewhat loose.
      <br/>
      Of course, clips or other locking mechanisms can be provided to secure the side panels in position.
      <br/>
      Further, sliding rods can be provided to secure the right side panels 34, 35 and the left panels 32, 33 into a coplanar position, such as seen in FIG. 2, preventing rotation about the right external hinge 353 or the left external hinge, respectively.
      <br/>
      As discussed below, this is not believed necessary to practice the invention.
    </p>
    <p num="42">
      Once the upper sleeve 30 is in place on the base 9, the box 1 can be loaded from the top.
      <br/>
      When doors 366, 367 are provided in the front panel 36, the door bolt 370 can be unlocked.
      <br/>
      The left door and the right door can then be opened, providing access to the interior cavity 300.
      <br/>
      When desired, shelves 501 can be mounted in the box between the panels (see FIG. 1).
      <br/>
      This may be particularly useful when the box is of a size large enough for a man to walk into.
    </p>
    <p num="43">
      Once the box 1 has been loaded, the lid 40 is positioned along the top edges of the upper sleeve 30.
      <br/>
      Once the lid is in place, the clasps 49-52 are engaged to the clips on the top of the front panel and the rear panel.
      <br/>
      The rim 400 is located outside of the panels of the upper sleeve, thereby limiting their outward movement.
      <br/>
      The juncture of the right rear panel 34 and the right front panel 35 is positioned between the right flange 54 and the right rim 47.
      <br/>
      Similarly, the juncture of the left rear panel 32 and the left front panel 33 is positioned between the left flange 53 and the left rim 46.
      <br/>
      The side panels are thus held in position and prevented from rotating about the exterior hinges.
      <br/>
      This adds great stability to the box, allowing other loaded boxes to be stacked, shipped and stored thereon.
    </p>
    <p num="44">
      Once the box is secured in the assembled condition, fork lift prongs can be directed under the bottom panel, engaging the channels 21, 23.
      <br/>
      In this way, additional pallets are not required for the box.
      <br/>
      The loaded box can be placed on top of another such box.
      <br/>
      Apertures are provided in the channels and the top tabs.
      <br/>
      A locking bolt or ring can be slipped through the apertures, securing the lid of one box to the channels of a second box.
