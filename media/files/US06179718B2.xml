      A hole forming apparatus comprises a workpiece transfer mechanism that transfers one unformed workpiece at a time into a workpiece gripper and drives completed workpieces out of the workpiece gripper and onto an exit path.
      <br/>
      A compound hydro-pneumatic cylinder moves the gripper and one workpiece at a time downward into contact with a rotating forming tool.
      <br/>
      The forming tool includes a tool adapter head that holds various forming implements such as cutting blades or drill bits.
      <br/>
      The head also accommodates broachers and reamers, in which case a precision logic control detects and rejects defective workpieces that have no holes to broach or ream.
      <br/>
      The apparatus may also include a positive stop that prevents workpieces from overshooting the end of a forming stroke.

    <heading>TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
    <p num="2">This invention relates generally to a fastener-forming machine and, more particularly, to a secondary fastener-forming machine.</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="3">
      Secondary fastener forming machines take cylindrical workpieces, such as headed fastener blanks that have been formed in a primary fastener forming process, and perform additional operations on the workpieces such as tapering the ends.
      <br/>
      To perform additional operations such as pointing on the blanks, some secondary forming machines drive the blanks axially along a linear forming stroke into engagement with cutters mounted on a cutting head.
      <br/>
      It is highly desirable that secondary fastener forming machines of this type include means for adjusting the length of each forming stroke to accommodate fastener blanks and other workpieces of various lengths.
      <br/>
      It is also desirable that such machines include a mechanism that senses when a blank has reached the end of its forming stroke and causes the machine to reverse and disengage the formed workpiece from the forming tool.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      Optical Boring Company, the assignee of the present invention, manufactures a secondary fastener forming machine (the OBC machine) that forms pointed ends onto headed fastener blanks.
      <br/>
      The OBC machine includes a reciprocator in the form of a 2-piston hydro-pneumatic cylinder that reciprocates a reciprocating portion of the assembly including a fastener gripper upward to a fully retracted "remote" position and downward through a cutting stroke to a fully extended "proximate" position.
      <br/>
      During the lower portion of the cutting stroke the lower end of a fastener blank held in the gripper axially engages a rotating cutting tool at a cutting tool rotational axis.
      <br/>
      The cutting tool includes carbide cutting blades that are positioned around the cutting tool axis to cut a tapered conical tip on the fastener blank.
      <br/>
      One piston within the cylinder is hydraulically dampened leaving no hard linkages between the forming machine and the fastener blank being worked.
      <br/>
      This lack of hard linkages allows the downward travel of the fastener blank and gripper to slow with increased resistance during the cutting stroke and to slow further or even stop completely in response to excessive resistance.
      <br/>
      After cutting, the cylinder lifts the gripper and extracts the fastener from the cutting tool, completing a cutting cycle.
      <br/>
      The OBC machine also includes a part transfer mechanism that inserts and ejects parts.
      <br/>
      The reciprocal motion of one of the pistons within the hydro-pneumatic cylinder drives the part transfer mechanism.

    <p num="5">
      An adjustable screw axially engages a limit switch whenever a fastener has reached the end of its forming stroke.
      <br/>
      When the limit switch is thus activated it signals the reciprocator to reverse the reciprocating portion of the assembly and disengage the newly-tipped fastener from the cutters.
      <br/>
      The screw may be advanced or retracted to adjust the reversal point of the cylinder at the end of the cutting stroke.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      While a reciprocator of this type provides many advantages it cannot consistently terminate the downward forming/cutting stroke at the same proximate position within acceptable tolerances.
      <br/>
      If cycle speed is increased for any reason, the reciprocating portion of the assembly and the fastener blank can overshoot the proximate position resulting in a deeper cut on the fastener.
      <br/>
      Conversely, if cycle speed decreases for any reason, the reciprocating portion may undershoot the desired reversal point resulting in a shallower cut on the fastener.
      <br/>
      Cycle speed will tend to decrease over time as the cutters begin to get dull from repeated cutting cycles.
      <br/>
      The cycle speed slows because the force required to advance each fastener blank into the cutters increases while the pneumatic pressure supply remains relatively constant.
      <br/>
      In addition, small variations in pneumatic pressure supply are common with most industrial air compressor systems and can result in cutting depth variations that are unacceptable in certain applications.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      What is needed is a hydro-pneumatically driven fastener forming machine that, without hard linkages, moves fastener blanks through a forming stroke while positively and consistently maintaining the end-of-stroke stopping position, i.e., the "proximate" position of each workpiece relative to the forming tool.
      <br/>
      What is also needed is such a machine that can accommodate bolts of various lengths.

    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="8">
      In accordance with the present invention a hydro-pneumatically driven fastener forming apparatus for forming fasteners from cylindrical workpieces comprises a positive stop.
      <br/>

      <br/>
      The ring is pre-selected to have an inner diameter slightly larger than an outer diameter of a series of workpieces to be sorted.
      <br/>
      The ring is configured to encircle a portion of a relatively straight workpiece held in the gripper when the gripper and ring are in the proximate position, the workpiece being withdrawn from the ring when the gripper and ring are in the remote position.

      The ring, support frame 36, reciprocator, gripper and a workpiece held in the gripper define an open electrical circuit that is closed only when a workpiece contacts the ring.
      <br/>
      An electrical power source is connected into the circuit.
      <br/>
      An electrically actuated workpiece diverter is also connected into the circuit and is mechanically supported adjacent the workpiece exit path.
      <br/>
      The workpiece diverter is operable to shunt bent workpieces away from the exit path when the bent workpieces contact the ring and complete the electrical circuit.

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading>
    <p num="27">
      A fastener forming apparatus for forming fasteners from headed cylindrical workpieces 16 is generally shown at 10 in FIG. 1.
      <br/>
      The apparatus 10 comprises a workpiece gripper or grip chuck, generally indicated at 12 in FIGS. 1, 2 and 7-9.
      <br/>
      The grip chuck 12 is supported for reciprocal movement along a forming axis shown at 14 in FIGS. 1-9. The reciprocal movement includes alternating downward cutting strokes and upward return strokes.
      <br/>
      The grip chuck 12 is configured to releasably grip and carry a generally cylindrical workpiece 16 in a coaxial disposition along the forming axis 14.
      <br/>
      A forming tool, generally shown at 18 in FIGS. 1, 2, 4, 5 and 9, is spaced vertically below the grip chuck 12 along the forming axis 14.
      <br/>
      The grip chuck 12 is supported for reciprocal motion along the forming axis 14 between a remote position shown in FIG. 7 and a proximate position shown in FIG. 9.
      <br/>
      As shown in FIGS. 7 and 9, the grip chuck 12 and forming tool 18 are disposed farther apart in the remote position than in the proximate position.
      <br/>
      In the proximate position shown in FIG. 9 the workpiece is engaged with the forming tool 18 and is at the end of its downward cutting stroke.
    </p>
    <p num="28">
      The apparatus 10 also includes a workpiece transfer mechanism 20 generally indicated at 20 in FIGS. 1-3. The workpiece transfer mechanism 20 is configured to sequentially drive formed workpieces 16 out of the grip chuck 12 by transferring unformed workpieces 16 into the grip chuck 12 when the grip chuck 12 is in the remote position.
      <br/>
      The formed workpieces 16 are driven from the grip chuck 12 onto an exit chute shown at 22 in FIG. 3.
      <br/>
      The transfer mechanism 20 receives workpieces 16 from a spiral track (not shown) in a vibrating bowl 24 that feeds the workpieces 16 into a downwardly sloping load chute 26.
      <br/>
      The workpieces slide by gravitational force down the sloping load chute 26 to a level "landing" portion 28 of the load chute 26.
      <br/>
      The landing portion 28 of the load chute 26 is disposed adjacent the transfer mechanism 20, tangential to the forming axis 14 and is spaced from the forming axis 14.
    </p>
    <p num="29">
      A reciprocator in the form of a compound hydro-pneumatic cylinder, generally indicated at 30 in FIGS. 1, 2 and 7-9, is operatively connected to a reciprocating portion of the apparatus 10 generally indicated at 32 in FIGS. 1, 2 and 7-9.
      <br/>
      The reciprocating portion 32 of the apparatus 10 comprises the grip chuck 12.
      <br/>
      The hydro-pneumatic cylinder 30 drives the grip chuck 12 and workpiece 16 between the extended and retracted positions.
      <br/>
      Reciprocal motion driven by the compound cylinder 30 also operates the workpiece transfer mechanism 20.
      <br/>
      The compound hydro-pneumatic cylinder 30 has a stationary end shown at 34 in FIGS. 1, 2 and 7-9 that is connected to a stationary support frame 36.
      <br/>
      The compound hydro-pneumatic cylinder 30 has a reciprocating end in the form of a piston rod shown at 38 in FIGS. 2 and 7-9. The piston rod 38 is operatively connected to the reciprocating portion 32 of the apparatus 10 at the grip chuck 12.
      <br/>
      As is described in greater detail below, the piston rod 38 is hydro-pneumatically coupled to the support frame 36 through the compound hydro-pneumatic cylinder 30 for a portion of its downward travel on the forming stroke.
      <br/>
      Therefore, for that portion of the forming stroke, the motion of the piston rod 38 and the grip chuck 12 is hydraulically dampened.
    </p>
    <p num="30">
      The apparatus 10 also comprises a down-stroke positive stop generally indicated at 40 in FIGS. 2 and 7-9. The positive stop 40 includes a reciprocating stop surface and a stationary stop surface shown at 42 and 44, respectively, in FIGS. 2 and 7-9. The reciprocating stop surface 42 is disposed on the reciprocating portion 32 of the apparatus 10 in a position to engage the stationary stop surface 44.
      <br/>
      The stationary stop surface 44 is supported on a portion of the stationary support frame 36 in vertical alignment with the reciprocating stop surface 42 when the grip chuck 12 and tool 18 are in the proximate position.
      <br/>
      The positive stop 40 prevents the compound hydro-pneumatic cylinder 30 from causing the reciprocating portion 32 of the apparatus 10 to overshoot the extended position which prevents workpieces 16 from advancing too far into the forming tool 18 and being over-cut.
    </p>
    <p num="31">
      The compound hydro-pneumatic cylinder 30 is connected between the stationary support frame 36 and the reciprocating end of the reciprocator, i.e., the piston rod 38.
      <br/>
      The compound pneumatic-hydraulic cylinder 30 reciprocates the workpiece 16 and the grip chuck 12 through the downward forming stroke and the upward return stroke with the workpiece 16 moving along the forming axis 14.
      <br/>
      The compound hydro-pneumatic cylinder 30 is pneumatically driven through an upper piston shown at 46 in FIGS. 7-9. The upper piston 46 is mounted within a pneumatic cylinder 48 of the compound cylinder 30 and is hydraulically dampened for a portion of the forming stroke by an annular lower piston generally indicated at 50 in FIGS. 2 and 7-9. The lower piston 50 is slidably supported within a hydraulic cylinder 52 of the compound cylinder 30.
    </p>
    <p num="32">
      As best shown in FIG. 2, the piston rod 38 extends downward from the upper piston 46 and operatively connects to the grip chuck 12.
      <br/>
      The piston rod 38 is fastened to the upper piston 46 and is slidably disposed through upper and lower tubular channels 54, 56 of the annular lower piston 50.
      <br/>
      The upper tubular channel 54 is shown in FIGS. 7-9 and the lower tubular channel is shown in FIG. 2.
      <br/>
      The tubular channels 54, 56 each includes at least one O-ring seal 57.
      <br/>
      The O-ring seals 57 provide fluid-tight seals between the lower piston 50 and the piston rod 38.
      <br/>
      As shown in FIGS. 7-9, a lower end 58 of the piston rod 38 passes through an upper guide hole 60 in a generally rectangular bronze guide plate 62 that is supported on the support frame 36.
      <br/>
      The lower end 58 of the piston rod 38 then passes through a lower guide hole 64 in a steel cross bar portion 66 of the grip chuck 12 and connects to a plunger 68.
    </p>
    <p num="33">
      As shown in FIGS. 2, 3 and 7-9, the plunger 68 is slidably disposed within the lower guide hole 64 in the cross bar portion 66 of the grip chuck 12.
      <br/>
      The plunger 68 is configured to engage both a top surface or head of the unformed workpiece 16 and laterally inwardly extending arm portions 70 of a pair of opposing grip jaws 72.
      <br/>
      The grip jaws 72 are mounted to the cross bar 66 via parallelogram-type linkages 74.
      <br/>
      The parallelogram linkages 74 support the grip jaws 72 in such a way that downward pressure from the plunger 68 forces the jaws 72 downward in relation to the cross bar 66 and inward in relation to each other and into an over-center "gripped" position.
      <br/>
      In the gripped position, the grip jaws 72 clamp onto the shaft portion of an unformed workpiece 16 positioned between them.
      <br/>
      The grip jaws 72 are shown in the gripped position in FIGS. 2, 3, 8 and 9.
      <br/>
      Conversely, the plunger 68 is configured to draw upward on the laterally inwardly extending arm portions 70 of the grip jaws 72 on the return stroke, moving the grip jaws 72 over-center to their open position and releasing the workpiece 16 positioned between them.
      <br/>
      The grip jaws 72 are shown in their open position in FIG. 7.
    </p>
    <p num="34">
      An upper air supply tube shown at 76 in FIG. 1 connects a solenoid air diverter valve 78 to an upper portion of the pneumatic cylinder 48 above the upper piston 46.
      <br/>
      A lower air supply tube 80 connects the solenoid air diverter valve 78 to a lower portion of the pneumatic cylinder 48 below the upper piston 46.
      <br/>
      The diverter valve 78 is electrically actuated to alternately direct pressurized air through the upper and lower air supply tubes 76, 80 and into upper and lower portions of the pneumatic cylinder 48, respectively.
      <br/>
      Air directed to the upper portion of the pneumatic cylinder 48 forces the upper piston 46 downward on the forming stroke.
      <br/>
      Air directed to the lower portion of the pneumatic cylinder 48 forces the upper piston 46 upward on the return stroke.
    </p>
    <p num="35">
      A cylinder wall 82 of the hydraulic cylinder 52 is supported on a portion of the support frame 36 that is connected to the stationary bronze guide plate 62.
      <br/>
      The lower piston 50 includes a generally disk-shaped portion 84 and a cylindrical portion 86 that extends concentrically and integrally downward from the disk-shaped portion 84 to the cross-bar portion 66 of the grip chuck 12.
      <br/>
      The cylindrical portion 86 of the lower piston 50 concentrically surrounds the piston rod 38 and is fastened to the cross-bar portion 66 of the grip chuck 12 at a lower end of the cylindrical portion 86.
    </p>
    <p num="36">
      The outer circumference of the cylindrical portion 86 of the lower piston 50 is smaller than an outer circumference of the disk-shaped portion 84 and defines a hydraulic oil-filled annular chamber 88.
      <br/>
      The annular chamber 88 is disposed between an outer cylinder wall 90 of the hydraulic cylinder 52 and an outer surface of the cylindrical portion 86 of the lower piston 50.
      <br/>
      An upper O-ring seal 57A is supported in a recess formed into the outer circumference of the lower piston 50.
      <br/>
      The upper O-ring seal 57A seals the disk-portion 84 of the lower piston 50 against the hydraulic cylinder wall 90.
      <br/>
      A lower O-ring seal 57B is supported in a recess formed into an inner circumference of a circular aperture 92 in the support frame 36.
      <br/>
      The lower O-ring seal 57B seals the circular aperture in the support frame 36 against the cylindrical portion 86 of the lower piston 50.
      <br/>
      The upper and lower O-ring seals 57A, 57B cooperate to prevent hydraulic oil from escaping the annular chamber 88.
    </p>
    <p num="37">
      As shown in FIGS. 1, 2 and 7-9, a metal hydraulic tube 94 connects the annular chamber 88 of the hydraulic cylinder 52 and a pneumatically-pressurized hydraulic reservoir 98 that is supported on the pneumatic cylinder 48.
      <br/>
      The hydraulic tube 94 provides a fluid channel between the annular chamber 88 and the hydraulic oil reservoir 98.
      <br/>
      The hydraulic oil reservoir 98 is pressurized by air delivered from a pressurized air source (not shown) through a reservoir air supply tube shown at 100 in FIG. 1.
      <br/>
      A manually-adjustable Parker hydraulic dampening valve (part no. F600B) 102 is connected approximately midway along the length of the hydraulic tube 94.
      <br/>
      The dampening valve 102 is configured to adjustably restrict only the flow of hydraulic oil from the annular chamber 88 to the reservoir 98.
      <br/>
      The dampening valve 102 does not restrict oil flow from the reservoir 98 to the annular chamber 88.
      <br/>
      Because the lower piston 50 is hydraulically dampened and no hard linkages exist between the stationary support frame 36 and the workpiece 16, the reciprocal motion of the compound hydro-pneumatic cylinder 30 slows with increased resistance and stops with too much resistance rather than jamming or breaking.
    </p>
    <p num="38">
      As explained above, a vibrating bowl 24 feeds unformed workpieces 16 into a downwardly sloping load chute 26.
      <br/>
      The workpieces 16 come to rest in a level landing portion 28 of the load chute 26 adjacent the workpiece transfer mechanism 20.
      <br/>
      The workpiece transfer mechanism 20 includes a separator rod shown at 104 in FIGS. 11 and 3.
      <br/>
      The separator rod 104 is supported adjacent the landing portion 28 of the load chute 26.
      <br/>
      The separator rod 104 pushes each unformed workpiece 16, one at a time, from the landing portion 28 of the load chute 26 into a staging position 106 adjacent the grip jaws 72.
      <br/>
      The separator rod 104 then retracts and an injector assembly, generally indicated at 108 in FIGS. 1 and 3, pushes each unformed workpiece 16, one at a time, from the staging position 106 into a grip position between the open grip jaws 72 .
      <br/>
      Each newly injected workpiece 16 strikes a newly formed workpiece 16 still disposed between the grip jaws 72 and forces the newly formed workpiece 16 onto the declined exit chute 22.
      <br/>
      Each newly formed workpiece 16 slides down the declined exit chute 22 and into a bin.
    </p>
    <p num="39">
      The injector assembly 108 includes between one and four horizontal inserter rods 110 removably attached along a vertical support rod 112.
      <br/>
      After each unformed workpiece 16 has been deposited in the staging position 106, the inserter rods 110 are driven axially into the unformed workpiece 16, pushing the unformed workpiece 16 into the grip position between the grip jaws 72.
      <br/>
      The number of inserter rods 110 used depends on the length of the workpieces 16 in a given parts run.

      The workpiece transfer mechanism 20 also includes a pivot linkage, shown at 114 in FIG. 1, that connects the separator rod 104 and injector assembly 108 to the piston rod 38 through a rectangular window (not shown) in the cylindrical portion 86 of the lower piston 50.
      <br/>
      This pivot linkage 114 uses the downward motion of the upper piston 46 to drive the separator 104 and inserter rods 110 of the transfer mechanism 20.
      <br/>
      Driven by the pivot linkage 114, the transfer mechanism 20 simultaneously introduces an unformed workpiece 16 between the jaws 72 of the grip chuck 12 and ejects a completed workpiece 16 to the exit chute 22.
    </p>
    <p num="41">
      It is the first portion of the downward motion of the piston shaft 38 that the pivot linkage 114 transfers to the separator 104 and inserter rods 104, 110.
      <br/>
      Because the pivot linkage 114 uses the first portion of the downward forming stroke motion, the transferred motion is relatively rapid.
      <br/>
      This is because the motion of the upper piston 46 and piston rod 38 are not hydraulically dampened during the first portion of the forming stroke and the workpiece 16 is not yet in contact with the forming tool 18.
      <br/>
      Therefore, although the upper piston 46 slows in its downward movement when the forming tool 18 contacts and is forming the workpiece 16, this resulting slower motion of the piston rod 38 does not limit the speed at which the transfer mechanism 20 inserts individual workpieces 16.

      A rotator, generally indicated at 116 in FIGS. 1 and 2, is operatively connected to the tool 18 to rotate the tool 18 about the forming axis 14.

      The rotator 116 includes a cylindrical spindle and case, shown at 118 and 120, respectively, in FIG. 2.

      The forming tool 18 includes a generally flat-based dome-topped circular tool adapter head generally indicated at 126 in FIGS. 1, 2, 4, 5 and 9.
      <br/>
      As is best shown in FIGS. 4 and 5 the tool adapter head 126 is configured to releasably engage forming implements 128.

      When cutter blocks are fastened into the receptacles, the cutting blades 134 are disposed adjacent the forming axis 14 in a position to cut one end of a workpiece 16 held in the grip jaws 72 as the grip chuck 12 approaches the proximate position.
      <br/>
      The cutting blades 134 are positioned to cut a tapered conical tip on a cylindrical workpiece 16 inserted axially downward between the blades 134 as shown in FIG. 9.

      The tool adapter head 126 accepts cutter blocks 132 having cutting blades 134 that are twice the size of standard cutting blades used with workpiece-pointing machines.

      The larger cutting blades 134 produce bigger chips &amp; less heat while cutting.
      <br/>
      The larger cutting blades 134 absorb more heat energy during cutting than would small cutter blades because the larger blades 134 cut larger chips from the workpieces 16.
      <br/>
      By cutting larger chips there is less friction and therefore less frictional heat generated for a given mass of chips.
      <br/>

      The reciprocating stop surface 42 is a flat annular surface disposed on a reciprocating stop in the form of a metallic knurled ring shown at 152 in FIGS. 2 and 7-9. The knurled ring 152 is adjustably connected to the reciprocating portion 32 of the apparatus 10.

      The lower limit switch 156 is actuable by contact with the knurled ring 152 when the reciprocating portion 32 of the apparatus 10 is in the extended position.

      The top surface of the block 158 is also the stationary stop surface 44 of the positive stop 40.

      The diameter of the circular shaft 160 is sufficiently large to prevent the block 158 from contacting the cylindrical portion 86 of the lower piston 50 as the lower piston 50 travels up and down along the forming axis 14.

      The block 158 has a rectangular channel 162 formed into its bottom surface.

      The block 158 is fastened to the bronze guide plate 62 by four fasteners (not shown) through four fastener holes 164.

      As explained above, the presence of the positive stop 40 prevents workpiece overshoot.

      The positive stop 40 also prevents workpiece undershoot by allowing the lower limit switch 156 to be supported in a higher position.
      <br/>
      Higher placement of the lower limit switch 156 insures that the reciprocating stop surface 42 will always hit the stationary stop surface 44 before the compound hydro-pneumatic cylinder 30 reverses--even at extremely slow reciprocation rates.
      <br/>
      Without the positive stop 40, the lower limit switch 156 must be placed at a lower intermediate position where an average reciprocating speed will result in a desired forming depth on each workpiece 16.
      <br/>
      With no positive stop to force a consistent reversal position, as the forming tool 18 dulls and the compound hydro-pneumatic cylinder 30 slows, the forming stroke will grow gradually shorter resulting in shallower workpiece 16 forming depths.

      <br/>
      The actuator fork 176 and upper limit switch 174 are positioned so that the pivot linkage 114 will cause the actuator fork 176 to actuate the upper limit switch 174 when the upper piston 46 reaches the top of its return stroke.

      In operation, the air diverter valve 78 responds to upper limit switch 174 actuation by directing air through the upper air inlet tube 76 into the upper portion of the pneumatic cylinder 48 above the upper piston 46.
      <br/>
      This pneumatic pressure forces the upper piston 46 downward, initiating the forming stroke.
      <br/>
      During an initial portion of the forming stroke the upper piston 46 is driven rapidly downward without hydraulic dampening and with the lower piston 50 and grip chuck 12 remaining stationary.
      <br/>
      During this rapid undampened portion of the forming stroke the piston rod 38 and plunger 68 are driven downward and the pivot linkage 114 between the piston rod 38 and the transfer mechanism 20 positions an unformed workpiece 16 between the jaws 72 of the grip chuck 12.
      <br/>
      As the plunger 68 continues downward it forces the grip jaws 72 downward and into the gripped position--driving the jaws 72 over-center and clamping the unformed workpiece 16 between the jaws 72.
      <br/>
      As the jaws 72 clamp the workpiece 16 a lower surface of the plunger 68 may be brought to bear on the head of the unformed workpiece 16.

      As the lower piston 50 is drawn downward, hydraulic fluid is forced from the annular chamber 88 into the air-pressurized hydraulic reservoir 98 through the hydraulic tube 94 and valve 102.
      <br/>
      Therefore, during the final portion of the forming stroke the motion of the unformed workpiece 16 is hydraulically dampened as the workpiece 16 engages the forming tool 18.

      At the completion of the downward forming stroke the knurled ring 152 of the positive stop 40 depresses the lower limit switch actuator button 170, actuating the lower limit switch 156.

      The lower limit switch 156 sends an electrical signal to the solenoid within the air diverter valve 78, causing the diverter valve 78 to direct pressurized air through the lower air inlet tube and into the lower portion of the pneumatic cylinder 48.
      <br/>
      Either simultaneous with lower limit switch 156 actuation or shortly thereafter, the knurled ring 152 contacts the stationary stop surface 44, ending the downward forming stroke.
      <br/>
      The pressurized air flowing into the lower portion of the pneumatic cylinder 48 then begins to drive the upper piston 46 upward, initiating the return stroke.

      As the lower piston 50 moves upward it draws hydraulic oil through the hydraulic line from the hydraulic reservoir 98 and into the expanding annular chamber 88.
      <br/>
      After the lower piston 50 and grip chuck cross bar 66 have reached the upper limit of their travel, and with the grip chuck cross bar 66 contacting the stationary bronze guide plate 62, the plunger continues to pull the jaws 72 of the grip chuck 12 upward.
      <br/>
      The plunger pulls the jaws 72 over-center which causes the jaws 72 to release the newly-cut workpiece 16.

      As the upper piston 46 reaches the end of the return stroke, the upper limit switch 174 is actuated through the pivot linkage 114, re-initiating the downward forming stroke and workpiece transfer.

      During the fastener forming process, the compound hydraulic-pneumatic cylinder 48 provides vertical workpiece 16 movement that is substantially faster than the movement that the cams or chains of standard mechanical devices can provide.
      <br/>
      Because the forming process is faster, the forming tool 18 does not require lubricant.
      <br/>
      The hydraulic cylinder 52 also extends the life of the forming tool 18 by acting as a shock-absorbing cushion during the forming process and during downward movement of the workpiece into the forming tool 18.

      Cycle time is the sum of the total time it takes to load and cut each workpiece 16.
      <br/>
      The cutting feed rate is preset and is limited by the maximum speed at which a workpiece 16 can be fed into the forming tool 18 and effectively formed.
      <br/>
      However, the non-forming, or "workpiece transfer" portion of the cycle is both manually adjustable and self-regulating.
      <br/>
      An operator can, therefore, change the overall cycle speed by increasing or decreasing the part transfer speed, i.e., the speed at which the workpiece transfer mechanism 20 feeds individual unformed workpieces 16 into the forming tool 18.
      <br/>
      The speed of the workpiece transfer portion of the cycle is dependent on cutting load, pneumatic pressure, and the size of a one-way restricting variable orifice within the dampening valve 102.
      <br/>
      Workpiece transfer rate is increased by higher pneumatic input pressure to the compound cylinder 30, reduced cutting load, and/or increased dampening valve 102 orifice size.
      <br/>
      Conversely, workpiece transfer rate is decreased by lower pneumatic input pressure, higher cutting loads, and/or decreased dampening valve orifice size.
      <br/>
      The pneumatic input pressure is typically set at 100 psi.
      <br/>
      However, the system will operate with input pressures as low as 60 psi.
      <br/>
      Operators typically adjust the workpiece transfer rate by adjusting the dampening valve 102.
      <br/>
      This changes the size of the orifice in the dampening valve 102 and therefore the rate at which the lower piston 84 can force hydraulic oil from the annular chamber 88 of the hydraulic cylinder 52 into the air-pressurized oil reservoir 98 as the reciprocating portion 32 of the apparatus 10 moves downward on a forming stroke.

      A threaded height adjustment stop rod 190 is threaded through a portion of the support frame 36 and extends vertically downward to abut an upper surface 192 of the slide bracket 188.
      <br/>
      As is explained in greater detail below, the slide bracket 188 is upwardly biased by pressurized air 193 and hydraulic fluid 194 within the cylinders 182, 184 and is adjustably held down by the stop rod 190, i.e., an upwardly directed hydro-pneumatic biasing force.
      <br/>
      When an operator screws the rod downward using a ratchet shown at 196 in FIGS. 1 and 10, the slide bracket 188 is moved downward against the upward hydro-pneumatic biasing force.
      <br/>
      When an operator uses the ratchet 196 to screw the stop rod 190 upward, the biasing force drives the slide bracket 188 upward.

The center support cylinder 198 is connected between the base 186 and the slide bracket 188 between the air holding cylinder 182 and the pneumatic cylinder 184 as shown in FIG. 10. The air holding cylinder 182, pneumatic cylinder 184 and a lower stationary portion 200 of the telescoping center support cylinder 198 are fixed to the base 186.
      <br/>
      The support frame 36 is vertically supported on an upper telescoping portion 202 of the center support cylinder 198.
      <br/>
      The upper telescoping portion 202 of the center support cylinder 198 is slidably supported on the lower stationary portion 200.
      <br/>
      A fluid seal is disposed between the upper telescoping portion 202 and the lower stationary portion 200.
      <br/>
      The pneumatic cylinder 184 contains a single annular piston 204 disposed between an upper cylinder region 206 filled with pressurized air and a lower cylinder region 208 filled with hydraulic oil.
      <br/>
      The air holding cylinder 182 serves as an air reservoir and is in fluid communication with the upper cylinder region 206 through a solenoid operated air valve 210.
      <br/>
      A hydraulic channel 212 between the lower cylinder region 208 and the telescoping support cylinder 196 allows hydraulic oil to flow freely between the lower cylinder region 208 and the support cylinder 196.
      <br/>
      When the stop rod 190 is retracted upward, the constant downward pressure exerted by the air from the air holding cylinder 182 causes hydraulic oil to flow from the lower cylinder region 208 and into the telescoping center support cylinder 196.
      <br/>
      As the oil passes into the support cylinder 196 it forces the upper telescoping portion 202 of the center support cylinder 196 to move upward, carrying with it the slide bracket 188.
    </p>
    <p num="70">
      The forming tool 18 and rotator 116 may be lowered to a fully down position shown in FIG. 1 without advancing the stop rod 190 downward.
      <br/>
      This is accomplished by releasing the air charge from the air holding cylinder 182 and opening the solenoid air valve 210 to allow air to flow out of the upper cylinder region 206.
      <br/>
      This allows the piston 204 to move upward in the pneumatic cylinder 184 which allows hydraulic oil to move from the support cylinder 196 to the lower cylinder region 208 of the pneumatic cylinder 184.
      <br/>
      As a result, the telescoping portion 202 of the center support cylinder 196 moves downward, carrying with it the slide bracket 188 and rotator 116.

      The apparatus 10 includes a removable sorter attachment comprising an electrically-conductive detection ring coaxially supportable on the forming tool 18 in a position coaxially aligned with and spaced from the part gripper 12.
      <br/>
      The detection ring is pre-selected to have an inner diameter slightly larger than an outer diameter of workpieces 16 to be sorted.
      <br/>
      The detection ring is configured to encircle a portion of a relatively straight workpiece 16 held in the gripper 12 when the gripper 12 and detection ring are in the proximate position, the workpiece 16 being withdrawn from the detection ring when the gripper 12 and detection ring are in the remote position.
      <br/>
      The detection ring, the support frame 36, the reciprocator, the gripper 12 and a workpiece 16 held in the gripper 12 define an electrical circuit.
      <br/>
      The circuit is completed when a workpiece 16 contacts the detection ring.
      <br/>
      An electrical power source is connected into the circuit.
      <br/>
      An electrically actuated bent workpiece diverter is also connected into the circuit.
      <br/>
      The workpiece diverter includes the wastegate 147, the solenoid air valve 153 and the air cylinder 155 shown in FIG. 13. The workpiece diverter is operable to shunt bent workpieces 16 away from the exit chute 22 (as described above in connection with the PLC description) when the bent workpieces 16 contact the detection ring and complete the electrical circuit.
