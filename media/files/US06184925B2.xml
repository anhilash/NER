    <p num="1">
      1.
      <br/>
      Field of the Invention
    </p>
    <p num="2">The present invention relates to a photographing lens having data on colors of light before and after light passes through the photographing lens or a similar lens.</p>
    <p num="3">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
    <p num="4">
      In recent image recording technologies, an image can be recorded as a digital image signal.
      <br/>
      In a digital image recording system, it is important to reproduce the same color as the color perceived through the human eye on a display, a printing sheet, and the like, and the degree of significance of accurate color rendering in digital reproduction is increasing.
      <br/>
      There are various recording means for digital images.
      <br/>
      For example, an image picked up by an image pick-up device such as a CCD may be converted to an electrical image signal and recorded as a magnetic signal on a magnetic tape, or other medium, may be displayed on a display, may be printed on paper using a color printer, or may be copied.
      <br/>
      In any of these implementations, an optical image formed through a lens is converted to an analog or digital image signal, and is retrieved from the pick-up device and stored.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      A photographing lens is not completely transparent or achromatic, and lens materials have an inherent color (inherent spectral transmittance) which varies in accordance with any applied coating (see FIG. 2).
      <br/>
      Consequently, the color perceived by the human eye through the photographing lens is different from the color directly perceived by the human eye (without looking through the photographing lens).
      <br/>
      Consequently, when the image formed by the photographing lens is converted and reproduced using an image signal, it is necessary to correct the image signal in order to obtain the same color as that directly perceived by the human eye without looking through the photographing lens (which will be referred to as the true color).
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      However, in the prior art in which an image of an object formed by the photographing lens is converted to image signals and recorded on a recording medium, no color data is available to show the change in color depending on the photographing lens.
      <br/>
      Consequently, in a known solution to correct the color, the digital image signal recorded on the recording medium is read therefrom and is indicated on a display, and the displayed image is directly compared with the object to be recorded or printed.
    </p>
    <p num="7">It is an object of the present invention to enhance the degree of coincidence of color between a manuscript and recorded image data, and to facilitate the correction of the color, by providing necessary data (to make colors before and after recording identical) to a photographing lens when the color image is recorded through an optical element such as the photographing lens.</p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="8">To achieve the object mentioned above, according to the present invention, there is provided a lens having color correction data, comprising a storage means for storing the color correction data necessary to make the color of an image of an object to be recorded, formed by the lens, coincident with the color of the object perceived through the naked eye.</p>
    <p num="9">The color correction data can be spectral transmittance data of the lens, chromaticity coordinates of red, green, blue and white of the lens, or a deviation from a reference value.</p>
    <p num="10">The lens can be a photographing lens such as that used on a digital still camera, a TV camera and the like.</p>
    <p num="11">
      Another concept of the present invention, there is provided a digital camera including a camera body and a photographing lens detachably attached to said camera body.
      <br/>
      The photographing lens having a storage means for storing the color correction data necessary to make the color of an image of an object to be recorded, formed by the photographing lens, coincident with the color of the object perceived through the naked eye.
      <br/>
      The camera body having an image pickup device for converting the image formed by the photographing lens to digital image data; a recording device for recording the digital image data on a recording medium; and a controller which writes the color correction data read from the storage means of said photographing lens in the recording medium, together with the digital image data.

      The digital camera includes a camera body 21 and a photographing lens 11, which is detachably attached to the camera body 21.
      <br/>
      The photographing lens 11 is provided with a color correction data memory 13 which stores therein color correction data that is used when the photographing operation is carried out using the photographing lens 11.
    </p>
    <p num="15">
      The color correction data includes data necessary to correct the color of the object image formed by the photographing lens 11 to be coincident with the color of the object image formed by an ideal (achromatic or transparent) photographing lens.
      <br/>
      For instance, the color of the object image is divided into three primaries RGB (red, green, blue), and is converted to values of CIE chromaticity coordinates.
      <br/>
      RGBW chromaticity coordinate correction values necessary to make the lens-altered color of the object (viewed through the photographing lens 11) coincident with the true color of the object (viewed with the naked eye) define color correction data which is stored in the color correction data memory 13.
      <br/>
      The color correction data stored in the color correction data memory 13 is output to the camera body 21 through an input/output (I/O) interface 15.
    </p>
    <p num="16">
      The object image is formed on a light receiving surface of a CCD (image pickup device) 23 by the photographing lens 11.
      <br/>
      The CCD 23 is provided with a large number of pixels which are regularly located in a matrix arrangement.
      <br/>
      Each pixel is composed of three photoelectric transducers which are sensitive to the three primaries of R, G, and B, respectively.
      <br/>
      Upon photographing, the CCD 23 integrates the color components of the object image using the photoelectric transducers, and outputs the integral values as RGB color signals.
    </p>
    <p num="17">
      The CCD 23 usually has a spectral sensitivity distribution.
      <br/>
      If the CCD 23 has RGB filters, the spectral transmittances of the RGB filters are, for example, as shown in FIG. 3.
      <br/>
      The values of the chromaticity coordinates of R, G, B (in the case of the CCD 23 having the R, G, B filters) are measured and stored in advance in accordance with the outputs of the R, G, B pixels of the CCD 23.
      <br/>
      This procedure simplifies the subsequent calculations.
      <br/>
      In the illustrated embodiment, the values of the R, G, B chromaticity coordinates and the values of the W chromaticity coordinates are written in the CCD color component data memory 35 as spectral sensitivity data of the R, G, B pixels of the CCD 23.
      <br/>
      It should be noted that if the values of the chromaticity coordinates of the photographing lens 11 or the variation of the values of the chromaticity coordinates by the photographing lens 11 are stored in the color correction data memory 13, it is possible to store the values of the R, G, B, W chromaticity coordinates only in the CCD color component data memory 35.
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      The analog color signals of R, G, and B output from the CCD 23 are converted to digital signals (of, for example, 8 bits) by an A/D converter 25, and are successively written in the image memory 27.
      <br/>
      When the writing of the R, G, B color signals for one line (one field or one frame) is completed, the stored data is successively read from the image memory 27 and is converted to a predetermined image format (for example, "TIFF"-Tag Image File Format) by an image format circuit 29.
      <br/>
      The converted data is stored in the memory card 31 as the R, G, B color signals.
      <br/>
      The memory card 31 can be a flash memory, SRAM, or other memory means.
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      The R, G, B chromaticity coordinate values stored in the color correction data memory 13 are fetched by the chromaticity coordinate value generation circuit 33 of the camera body 21 through the I/O interface 15.
      <br/>
      The chromaticity coordinate value generation circuit 33 fetches the R, G, B, W chromaticity coordinate values of the CCD 23 from the CCD color component data memory 35, and calculates the R, G, B, and W chromaticity coordinate values of the image pickup system of the digital camera in accordance with the R, G, B, W chromaticity coordinate values of the CCD 23.
      <br/>
      Thereafter, the R, G and B color signals output from the CCD 23 are converted to digital values.
      <br/>
      These digital values, and the R, G, B, W chromaticity coordinate values of the image pickup system, are written in the card memory 31.
    </p>
    <p num="20">
      In general, each time the image data of each frame or field is recorded, the R, G, B, W chromaticity coordinate values corresponding thereto are recorded.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, it is also possible to record the R, G, B, W chromaticity coordinate values when the memory card 31 is mounted to the digital camera 21, or it is possible to record one color correction data set when the first image data is recorded.
    </p>
    <p num="21">The operations of the CCD 23, the A/D converter circuit 25, the image memory 27, the image format circuit 29, the memory card 31, and the chromaticity coordinate value generation circuit 33 are controlled by a system controller 37.</p>
    <p num="22">
      To process the stored image data, the memory card 31 is detached from the camera body 21 and is mounted to an image reader of an image processor (not shown).
      <br/>
      The image processor reads the RGB image data and the R, G, B, W chromaticity coordinate data from the memory card 31 and corrects the RGB image data.
      <br/>
      Thus, images of the same color as the true color (i.e., the color of the object viewed with the naked eye) can be produced.
    </p>
    <p num="23">In a digital still camera according to the present invention, when an image of a sheet of manuscript or a three-dimensional object as an object to be recorded or photographed is picked up by the CCD 23 and converted to digital image data, the chromaticity coordinate data of the three primaries R, G, B based on the CIE chromaticity diagram and the chromaticity coordinate value of white (W) are used as final color correction data.</p>
    <p num="24">
      If a silver halide film, in which data can be recorded on a magnetic recording layer of the film, is used (as in the "APS"-Advanced Photo System which has been recently developed) the R, G, B, W chromaticity coordinate correction values which are recorded on the magnetic recording layer of the film can be fetched using a film scanner.
      <br/>
      The R, G, B, W chromaticity coordinate correction values can be read and used when converted to digital image data.
      <br/>
      Thus, true color can be obtained.
    </p>
    <p num="25">The color correction data and the calculation to obtain the the color correction data in the first embodiment mentioned above, applied to a digital still camera, will be discussed below in more detail.</p>
    <p num="26">
      The following discussion is, as an example, applied to one common format of digital image data, i.e., TIFF. It is assumed that the digital image data of a pixel (R, G, B pixels) of the CCD 23 is represented by P(r, g, b). "r", "g", "b" represent the luminance of red, green, and blue, respectively and are each converted to 256 gradients (8 bits) for so-called 24-bit "full color".
      <br/>
      Although no default of the chromaticity coordinate value of R, G, B is set, the chromaticity coordinate values of NTSC are used as defaults, since the chromaticity coordinate values of the NTSC (or PAL or SECAM) television standard are used in most cases.
      <br/>
      The chromaticity coordinate values of r, g, b of the defaults based on NTSC are as follows.
    </p>
    <p num="27">r (0.67, 0.33), g (0.21, 0.71), b (0.14, 0.08)</p>
    <p num="28">
      White (W) is a color of luminance P (255, 255, 255), but it is represented by W (0.310, 0.316) in accordance with the chromaticity coordinate.
      <br/>
      The light source having the characteristics corresponding to the chromaticity coordinate W (0.310, 0.316) is referred to as a C-light source.
    </p>
    <p num="29">
      In the illustrated embodiment, the object 43 having a uniform spectral reflection factor  RHO ( LAMBDA ) is illuminated with light from the C-light source 41, so that an image of the object 43 formed by the photographing lens 11 is picked up by the CCD 23, as shown in FIG. 5.
      <br/>
      The chromaticity coordinates of the R, G, B pixel signals output from the CCD 23 are measured.
      <br/>
      The chromaticity coordinate correction data (e.g., difference) is obtained based on reference chromaticity coordinates (reference color data) and the measured chromaticity coordinates.
      <br/>
      The chromaticity coordinate correction data thus obtained and the reference chromaticity coordinates are written as color correction data in the CCD color component data memory 35.
      <br/>
      The chromaticity coordinate correction data includes color correction data of the image pickup system from the photographing lens 11 to the CCD 23.
      <br/>
      It is possible to obtain and store the chromaticity coordinate correction data for the photographing lens 11 and the CCD 23 in the respective memories 13 and 35, as mentioned above.
    </p>
    <p num="30">The R, G, B image data of the object image picked up by the photographing lens 11 and output from the CCD 23 is written in the memory card 31 together with the chromaticity coordinate correction data which has been read from the CCD color component data memory 35.</p>
    <p num="31">Moreover, the R, G, B image data of the object image picked up by the photographing lens 11 and output from the CCD 23 is corrected in accordance with the chromaticity coordinate correction data which has been read from the CCD color component data memory 35, and the corrected R, G, B image data is written in the memory card 31 together with the reference chromaticity coordinates.</p>
    <p num="32">The chromaticity coordinates are calculated as follows.</p>
    <p num="33">
      In the following discussion, it is assumed that the spectral power distribution of the C-light source 41 is S( LAMBDA ) wherein  LAMBDA  represents the wavelength (mm) (see FIG. 4); the spectral reflection factor of the object 43 which is illuminated with light from the C-light source 41 is  RHO ( LAMBDA ); and the spectral transmittance of the photographing lens 11 is L( LAMBDA ).
      <br/>
      The spectral power distribution W( LAMBDA ) when the image of the object 43 illuminated with light from the C-light source 41 is picked up by the CCD 23 is given by:
      <br/>
      W( LAMBDA )=S( LAMBDA ) *  RHO ( LAMBDA ) * e( LAMBDA )
    </p>
    <p num="34">Note that the object 43 has a uniform reflectance through the entire wavelength band.</p>
    <p num="35">
      Since the spectral sensitivity e( LAMBDA ) of R, G, B differ from each other, the spectral sensitivity e( LAMBDA ) is divided into er( LAMBDA ), eg( LAMBDA ), and eb( LAMBDA ), corresponding to R, G, and B, respectively.
      <br/>
      The values of er( LAMBDA ), eg( LAMBDA ), and eb( LAMBDA ) are integrated with the wave length, as follows.
    </p>

      To obtain the integrated chromaticity coordinates of R, G, B, the coordinates are converted to the x-y-z coordinates, using spectral tristimulus values x( LAMBDA ), y( LAMBDA ), z( LAMBDA ).

      Thus, the values of the coordinates X, Y, Z of R are given by:
