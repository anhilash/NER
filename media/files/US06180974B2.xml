    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="1">
      The present invention relates to a semiconductor storage device and a method of manufacturing the same.
      <br/>
      More particularly, the present invention relates to an electrode construction for a capacitor section in a cell of a ferroelectric memory and that of a high dielectric memory.
    </p>
    <p num="2">
      In recent years, dynamic random access memory (DRAM) cells each constructed of one MOS (metal oxide film semiconductor) transistor and one capacitor are mainly manufactured.
      <br/>
      With demands for high integration and fine processability in recent years, it has become more and more difficult to secure the capacity of a cell in the DRAMs having such a construction.
      <br/>
      Therefore, generally, efforts are made to develop methods of increasing the area of an electrode to secure the cell capacity.
    </p>
    <p num="3">
      Increasing the area of the electrode to secure the capacity of the cell is realized by constructing the electrode in a three-dimensional structure.
      <br/>
      However, because this method causes the manufacturing process to be very complicated, attempts to increase the area of the electrode by this method have almost reached the limit.
      <br/>
      Therefore, if a circuit integration further progresses, it will be difficult to secure the capacity of the cell using this method.
      <br/>
      Further, attempts to make dielectrics thinner have almost reached the limit, too.
      <br/>
      Therefore, in order to secure the cell capacity, researches are being made to develop new methods of using an oxide having a high dielectric constant (hereinafter referred to as "high dielectric") such as (Bax Sr1-x) TiO3 (0 &lt;= x &lt;= 1) as a dielectric material.
    </p>
    <p num="4">In the meantime, with the progress of a thin film-forming technique, ferroelectric non-volatile memories (FeRAM) operating at a high density and speed are being developed by combining the thin film-forming technique and a semiconductor memory-fabricating technique with each other.</p>
    <p num="5">The researches of such ferroelectric non-volatile memories are energetically made for practical application because it is considered that due to their properties of high-speed write/read, operations at low voltages, and resistance to repeated write/read operations, the ferroelectric non-volatile memories will be able to replace not only the conventional non-volatile memories such as EPROMs (Erasable Programmable ROMs), EEPROMs (Electrically Erasable ROMs), and flash memories, but also SRAMs (static RAMs) and DRAMs (Dynamic RAMs).</p>
    <p num="6">the following substances have been investigated as a ferroelectric substance to be used in a capacitor section of such a non-volatile memory: PbZrx Ti1-x O3 (0 &lt;= x &lt;= 1) (hereinafter referred to as "PZT"), and SrBi2 Ta2 O9 and Bi4 Ti3 O12 which each have fatigue characteristics more favorable than the PZT and can be driven at low voltages.</p>
    <p num="7">However, in order to allow these ferroelectrics and the high dielectrics to display their characteristics fully, it is necessary to heat-treat them in an oxidizing atmosphere at a temperature of as high as 400 (degree)  C.-800 (degree)  C.</p>
    <p num="8">
      When forming a highly integrated DRAM or FeRAM having a stack construction by using the ferroelectric or high dielectric material, generally, a plug formed of polysilicon or the like is used to electrically connect a CMOS (complementary metal oxide semiconductor) section and a capacitor with each other.
      <br/>
      FIG. 17 shows an example of such a construction.
      <br/>
      Reference numeral 5 in FIG. 17 denotes a plug.
      <br/>
      A lower electrode 10 of the capacitor is formed of platinum (Pt) having a high degree of resistance to an oxidation reaction in forming a film at high temperatures.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      In this case, it is necessary to form a barrier metal 11 made of a nitrided metal such as titanium nitride (TiN) between the lower electrode 10 of the capacitor and the plug 5.
      <br/>
      The barrier metal 11 serves to prevent Pt of the lower electrode 10 and polysilicon of the plug 5 from reacting with each other and also to prevent elements composing a ferroelectric film 8 (or a high dielectric film) from diffusing through the lower electrode 10 to the CMOS section in a heat-treating process.
    </p>
    <p num="10">In FIG. 17, reference numeral 1 denotes a silicon substrate, reference numeral 2 denotes a gate electrode, reference numeral 3 denotes a source region, reference numeral 4 denotes a drain region, reference numeral 6 denotes a LOCOS (LOCal Oxidation of Silicon) oxide film, reference numerals 7 and 9 denote interlaminar insulation films, and reference numeral 12 denotes an upper electrode of the capacitor section.</p>
    <p num="11">However, the semiconductor storage device having the CMOS section and the capacitor section electrically connected by the plug 5 as shown in FIG. 17 has the following problems:</p>
    <p num="12">
      That is, it is necessary that the barrier metal 11 has a thickness of about 2000  Angstrom  to prevent the elements of the ferroelectric film 8 from diffusing into other films in a heat-treating process.
      <br/>
      Consequently, the total of the thickness of the barrier metal 11 and that (1000  Angstrom ) of the lower electrode 10 is about 3000  Angstrom .
      <br/>
      Therefore, the total thickness of the capacitor section including the thickness of the dielectric substance 8 is very great, so that there is necessarily a big difference in level, or unevenness, in the capacitor section.
    </p>
    <p num="13">
      Therefore, in forming a contact hole in the interlaminar insulation film 9 and forming metal wiring after the interlaminar insulation film 9 is formed, errors occur due to a great difference in level, or unevenness, of the capacitor in a photolithographic process used for the fine processing.
      <br/>
      Thus, materials cannot be processed submicroscopically.
    </p>
    <p num="14">
      Further, in the case of the barrier metal 11 formed of TiN, as described above, Tin is easily oxidized by oxygen included in an atmosphere and permeating through Pt of the lower electrode 10 during the heat=treatment of the ferroelectric substance 8 (or a high dielectric).
      <br/>
      Consequently, a volume change and a film stress occur, which results in separation of the TiN (barrier metal 11) from the Pt (lower electrode 10) and which will cause hillocks and cracks in the Pt (lower electrode 10).
    </p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="15">
      It is an object of the present invention to provide a semiconductor storage device having a structure which allows the lower electrode of the capacitor section and the plug to tightly contact each other and which can eliminate the drawbacks caused by a difference in level, or projection, of the capacitor section in the processing time.
      <br/>
      It is also an object of the invention to provide a method of manufacturing such a semiconductor storage device.
    </p>
    <p num="16">
      In order to achieve the object, the present invention provides a semiconductor storage device having a stack construction and comprising a capacitor section having an upper electrode, a dielectric layer, and a lower electrode, and a transistor section connected with the capacitor section with a plug.
      <br/>
      The lower electrode is formed directly on the plug, and formed of at least one of platinum, a platinum-rhodium alloy, and an oxide of the platinum-rhodium alloy.
      <br/>
      The at least one is the oxide of the platinum-rhodium alloy.
    </p>
    <p num="17">
      According to this construction, the oxide of the platinum-rhodium alloy constituting a part of the lower electrode of the capacitor section prevents an oxygen atmosphere from permeating through the lower electrode to the polysilicon plug in forming the dielectric layer on the lower electrode.
      <br/>
      Thus, the surface of the polysilicon plug is prevented from being oxidized and thus a close contact is obtained between the transistor section and the capacitor section.
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      Consequently, it is unnecessary to provide the capacitor section with a barrier metal used to prevent the lower electrode and the polysilicon plug from reacting with each other.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, the capacitor section has a reduced unevenness.
      <br/>
      This allows the fine processing for the capacitor section to be accomplished with high accuracy.
    </p>
    <p num="19">Materials of the plug may include polysilicon and tungsten.</p>
    <p num="20">The semiconductor storage device having the above construction can be manufactured by a method comprising, for example, the steps of:</p>
    <p num="21">
      forming a transistor on a silicon substrate and covering the transistor with an interlaminar insulation film;
      <br/>
      forming a contact hole communicating with a drain region of the transistor in the interlaminar insulation film and filling the contact hole with a material of a plug so as to form the plug;
      <br/>
      forming directly on the plug a lower electrode of at least one of platinum, a platinum-rhodium alloy and an oxide of the platinum-rhodium alloy, the at least one being the oxide of the platinum-rhodium alloy;
      <br/>
      performing heat treatment in a nitrogen atmosphere; and
      <br/>
      forming a dielectric layer on the lower electrode and then forming an upper electrode on the dielectric layer.
    </p>
    <p num="22">
      According to the manufacturing method, the lower electrode is heat-treated in the nitrogen atmosphere.
      <br/>
      Thus, the lower electrode has an improved crystallizability and the dielectric layer formed on the lower electrode has a reduced leakage current.
    </p>
    <p num="23">It is preferable that the above heat treatment of the lower electrode in the nitrogen atmosphere is carried out at 400 (degree)  C.-700 (degree)  C. to improve the crystallizability of the lower electrode reliably.</p>
    <p num="24">In an embodiment, the plug is formed of polysilicon, and the lower electrode includes a film of the oxide of platinum-rhodium alloy, a film of the platinum-rhodium alloy, and a film of the oxide of the platinum-rhodium alloy which are sequentially stacked in this order on the plug.</p>
    <p num="25">According to this construction, the two layers each consisting of the film of the oxide of the platinum-rhodium alloy prevent the permeating of an oxygen atmosphere efficiently in forming the dielectric layer.</p>
    <p num="26">
      The semiconductor storage device according to the above embodiment can be manufactured by a method comprising, for example, the steps of:
      <br/>
      forming a transistor on a silicon substrate and covering the transistor with an interlaminar insulation film;
      <br/>

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
    <p num="53">The present invention will be described in detail below with reference to the drawings.</p>
    <p num="54">
      Rhodium oxide (RhOx) has a high degree of electrical conductivity (electric resistivity: 50-200  MU  OMEGA cm) and has the property of preventing diffusion of impurities.
      <br/>
      In particular, the rhodium oxide serves as a barrier to oxygen diffusion.
    </p>
    <p num="55">
      Therefore, according to the present invention, a lower electrode of a capacitor section is formed of at least an oxide of a platinum-rhodium alloy (PtRhOx) to prevent a plug from being oxidized in forming a ferroelectric layer (or a high dielectric layer).
      <br/>
      In addition to the essential PtRhOx, platinum (Pt) and/or an alloy of platinum and rhodium (PtRh) may be used as materials of the lower electrode.
      <br/>
      The structure allows the capacitor section and a CMOS section to contact each other preferably and eliminates the need for the formation of a barrier metal such as TiN between the lower electrode and the plug, thus allowing the difference in level, or a surface unevenness, of the capacitor section to be small.
    </p>
    <p num="56">First Embodiment</p>
    <p num="57">FIG. 1 is a sectional view showing a semiconductor storage device of the first embodiment.</p>
    <p num="58">
      In the semiconductor storage device, a MOS transistor (which is one of MOS transistors constituting a CMOS transistor, and the other MOS transistor is not shown) having a gate electrode 22, a source region 23, and a drain region 24 is formed on a silicon substrate 21 and covered by an interlaminar insulation film 26.
      <br/>
      Reference numeral 25 denotes a LOCOS (Local Oxidation of Silicon) oxide film 25.
      <br/>
      A polysilicon plug 27 connecting the CMOS with a capacitor section is formed in the interlaminar insulation film 26.
    </p>
    <p num="59">
      The capacitor section has three films 28, 29, and 30 (hereinafter each film referred to as lower electrode) composing a lower electrode LE thereof and sequentially laminated over the interlaminar insulation film 26 such that the lower elected LE is positioned on the polysilicon plug 27.
      <br/>
      The capacitor section also has a ferroelectric thin film 31 formed on the uppermost-layer lower electrode 30.
      <br/>
      An interlaminar insulation film 32 covers walls of the lower electrodes 28, 29, and 30 and the ferroelectric thin film 31, and an upper surface of the interlaminar insulation film 26.
      <br/>
      Films 33, 34, and 35 (hereinafter each film referred to as upper electrode) composing an upper electrode UE are sequentially laminated in an upper position of the capacitor section.
    </p>
    <p num="60">The semiconductor storage device having the above construction is formed by the following procedure.</p>
    <p num="61">
      Initially, the LOCOS oxide film 25 for element isolation is formed to a thickness of 5000  Angstrom  on the P-type silicon substrate 21.
      <br/>
      Then, by ion implantation, the source region 23 and the drain region 24 of the CMOS transistor are formed.
      <br/>
      Then, the gate electrode 22 is formed.
    </p>
    <p num="62">
      In order to form the capacitor section having a stack structure, a silicon oxide film having a thickness of 5000  Angstrom  is formed by a CVD (chemical vapor deposition) method to form the interlaminar insulation film 26.
      <br/>
      Thereafter, a contact hole having a diameter of 0.5  MU m is formed in the interlaminar insulation film 26 and then polysilicon is filled in the contact hole using the CVD method.
      <br/>
      Then, the surface of the polysilicon is flattened by a chemical mechanical polishing (CMP) method.
      <br/>
      Thus, the polysilicon plug 27 is completed.
    </p>
    <p num="63">
      As the lowermost-layer lower electrode 28, a PtRhOx film having a thickness of 100  Angstrom -500  Angstrom  (preferably, 200  Angstrom ) is formed directly on the polysilicon plug 27 at 250 (degree)  C. by means of a DC magnetron reactive sputtering method.
      <br/>
      As the intermediate-layer lower electrode 29, a PtRh film having a thickness of 200  Angstrom -1000  Angstrom  (preferably, 800  Angstrom ) is formed on the lowermost-layer lower electrode 28 at 250 (degree)  C. by means of the DC magnetron reactive sputtering method.
      <br/>
      As the uppermost-layer lower electrode 30, a PtRhOx film having a thickness of 200 Angstrom -1000  Angstrom  (preferably, 300  Angstrom ) is formed on the intermediate-layer lower electrode 29 at 250 (degree)  C. by means of the DC magnetron reactive sputtering method.
      <br/>
      The three lower electrodes 28, 29, and 30 are successively formed by changing the flow ratio of argon to oxygen.
    </p>
    <p num="64">The optimum thickness of the lower electrode EL consisting of the lower electrodes 28, 29, and 30 is as thin as 1300  Angstrom , about half of 3000  Angstrom  which is the sum of the barrier metal 11 made of TiN and the lower electrode 10 of the conventional semiconductor storage device shown in FIG. 17. Even the greatest thickness, namely, 2500  Angstrom  of the lower electrode EL is smaller than 3000  Angstrom  which is the sum of the barrier metal 11 made of TiN and the lower electrode 10 of the conventional semiconductor storage device.</p>
    <p num="65">Accordingly, the difference in level of the capacitor section is allowed to be smaller than that of the conventional capacitor section, which prevents errors from occurring in a photolithographic process carried out for finely processing a contact hole in the interlaminar insulation film 32 and metal wiring for the upper electrodes 33, 34, and 35.</p>
    <p num="66">
      Thereafter, a PZT thin film having a thickness of 200  Angstrom  is formed as the ferroelectric thin film 31 by a sol-gel method.
      <br/>
      Then, the PZT thin film is annealed in an atmosphere of combined oxygen and nitrogen at 600 (degree)  C. for 30 seconds, using a rapid thermal annealing (RTA) device.
    </p>
    <p num="67">
      Then, the ferroelectric thin film (PZT thin film) 31 and the lower electrodes 28, 29, and 30 thus formed are processed by a dry etching method into the size of, for example, 3.0  MU m square.
      <br/>
      Then, a silicon oxide film is formed as the interlaminar insulation film 32 by the CVD method.
      <br/>
      Then, a contact hole is formed through the interlaminar insulation film 32 such that the contact hole is positioned on the ferroelectric thin film 31.
    </p>
    <p num="68">
      Then, as the lowermost-layer upper electrode 33, a PtRhOx film having a thickness of 200  Angstrom -1000  Angstrom  (preferably, 300  Angstrom ) is formed in an upper position of the capacitor section at 250 (degree)  C. by means of the DC magnetron reactive sputtering method.
      <br/>
      As the intermediate-layer upper electrode 34, a PtRh film having a thickness of 200  Angstrom -1000  Angstrom  (preferably, 800  Angstrom ) is formed on the upper electrode 33 at 250 (degree)  C. by means of the DC magnetron sputtering method.
      <br/>
      As the uppermost-layer upper electrode 35, a PtRhOx film having a thickness of 100  Angstrom -500  Angstrom  (preferably, 200  Angstrom ) is formed on the upper electrode 34 at 250 (degree)  C. by means of the DC magnetron reactive sputtering method.
    </p>
    <p num="69">
      Then, the upper electrodes 33, 34, and 35 are processed by the dry etching method.
      <br/>
      Finally, a lead electrode of the source region 23 of the CMOS section is formed.
    </p>
    <p num="70">
      If the PtRhOx film forming the lowermost-layer lower electrode 28 has a thickness of less than 100  Angstrom , an oxygen gas atmosphere permeates into the polysilicon plug 27 and oxidizes the polysilicon in forming the ferroelectric thin film 31 by the sol-gel method.
      <br/>
      Thus, a good contact between the CMOS section and the capacitor section is not obtained.
      <br/>
      If the PtRhOx film forming the lowermost-layer lower electrode 28 has a thickness of more than 500  Angstrom , the total thickness of the capacitor section increases, which is unpreferable.
      <br/>
      If the film-forming temperature is 450 (degree)  C. or more, the surface of the polysilicon plug 27 is oxidized in an oxygen plasma atmosphere in forming the PtRhOx film.
      <br/>
      Consequently, it is impossible to obtain a good contact between the polysilicon plug 27 and the lowermost-layer lower electrode 28.
    </p>
    <p num="71">
      If the percentage of an oxygen content to all the elements in the PtRhOx film is over 30%, the morphology of the PtRhOx film becomes unfavorable rapidly and thus the crystallizability of the ferroelectric thin film 31 formed thereon becomes unfavorable.
      <br/>
      As a result, the leakage current characteristic of the capacitor section becomes very bad.
      <br/>
      If the percentage of the oxygen content is below 2%, the oxygen gas atmosphere used in forming the ferroelectric thin film 31 permeates into the polysilicon plug 27, thus oxidizing the polysilicon and preventing a preferable contact between the CMOS section and the capacitor section from being obtained.
    </p>
    <p num="72">
      If the PtRh film forming the intermediate-layer lower electrode 29 has a thickness of less than 200  Angstrom , the leakage current characteristic value of the ferroelectric thin film 31 becomes greater by about one figure.
      <br/>
      If the PtRh film forming the intermediate-layer lower electrode 29 has a thickness of more than 100  Angstrom , the entire thickness of the capacitor section increases, which is unpreferable.
    </p>
    <p num="73">The ratio between the elements of the PtRh film thus formed is 90:10.</p>
    <p num="74">
      If the PtRhOx film forming the uppermost-layer lower electrode 30 has a thickness of less than 200  Angstrom , an oxygen gas atmosphere used in forming the ferroelectric thin film 31 permeates to the polysilicon plug 27 side, thus oxidizing the polysilicon and preventing a good contact from being made between the CMOS section and the capacitor section.
      <br/>
      Further, the fatigue characteristic caused by polarization inversion was as low as 42% of an initial value after 1011 cycles when a stress pulse having a frequency of 100 kHz, a duty ration of 5%, and a voltage of 5 V was applied to the ferroelectric thin film 31.
      <br/>
      If the uppermost-layer lower electrode 30 is formed of a PtRhOx film in a thickness of 1000  Angstrom  or more, the total thickness of the capacitor section increases, which is unpreferable.
    </p>
    <p num="75">
      A voltage pulse was applied between the lead electrode of the source region 23 and the upper electrodes 33, 34, and 35 of the ferroelectric substance-provided capacitor section of the semiconductor storage device formed by the above method in order to determine the ferroelectric characteristic (the electric field-polarization characteristic).
      <br/>
      As a result, as shown in FIG. 2, a hysteresis loop was obtained which has a ferroelectric characteristic value great enough to be used as the ferroelectric capacitor which has a favorable symmetry.
    </p>
    <p num="76">The above result indicates that such a separation as seen between the TiN (barrier metal 11) and the Pt (lower electrode 10) in the conventional semiconductor storage device shown in FIG. 17 does not occur in the semiconductor storage device of the present invention, and that the polysilicon plug 27 and the lower electrodes 28, 29, and 30 contact each other closely.</p>
    <p num="77">
      FIG. 3 shows the fatigue characteristic of the device caused by polarization inversion when a stress pulse having a frequency of 100 kHz, a duty ratio of 5%, and a voltage of 5 V was applied between the upper electrodes 33, 34, and 35 and the lead electrode of the source region 23.
      <br/>
      The result was that the residual polarization value Pr was 96% of an initial value PrO even after 1011 cycles.
      <br/>
      This proves that the semiconductor storage of the present embodiment device has a considerably improved fatigue characteristic, as compared with the conventional semiconductor storage device in which the residual polarization value Pr drops to the low as 36%.

      As described above, because the lower electrode LE formed directly on the polysilicon plug 27 consists of the three layers of the PtRhOx film, the PtRh film, and the PtRhOx film, the PtRhOx film prevents the oxygen gas atmosphere from diffusing to the polysilicon plug 27 when forming the ferroelectric thin film 31.

      Therefore, the surface of the polysilicon plug 27 is prevented from being oxidized and a close contact is accomplished between the CMOS section and the capacitor section.

    <p num="214">That is, in a procedure similar to that of the first embodiment, the LOCOS oxide film 185, the source region 183, the drain region 184, the gate electrode 182, the interlaminar insulation film 186, the polysilicon plug 187, and the lower electrodes 188-190 are sequentially formed on the P-type silicon substrate 181.</p>
    <p num="215">Then, to form the high dielectric thin film 191, a film of (Bax Sr1-x)TiO3 is deposited in a thickness of 2000  Angstrom  on the uppermost-layer lower electrode 190 at a substrate temperature of 450 (degree)  C. by means of a sputtering method using a sintered substance of (Bax Sr1-x)TiO3 as a target.</p>
    <p num="216">
      Then, in a procedure similar to that of the first embodiment, the interlaminar insulation film 192 is formed, and a contact hole is formed in the interlaminar insulation film 192 such that the contact hole leads to the high dielectric thin film 191.
      <br/>
      Then, the upper electrodes 193-195 are formed.
      <br/>
      Then, these upper electrodes 193-195 are processed by dry etching method.

      Finally, a lead electrode of the source region 183 of the CMOS section is formed.

      FIG. 12 shows the dependence of the capacitance on the frequency of the high dielectric film 191 of the semiconductor storage device formed as described above.
      <br/>
      The area of the capacitor is 0.09 mm2. As indicated in FIG. 12, the capacitance value is constant, namely, about 4.5 nF in a frequency range of 102 Hz-106 Hz.
    </p>
    <p num="218">
      FIG. 13 shows the dependence of the leakage current density on the voltage of the high dielectric thin film 191.
      <br/>
      As indicated in FIG. 13, the leakage current density is of the order of 10-6 A/cm2 at 2 V, which indicates that the high dielectric thin film 191 has low leakage current characteristics.
    </p>
    <p num="219">
      As is obvious from the above, the high dielectric thin film 191 provides preferable electric characteristics.
      <br/>
      This proves that the polysilicon plug 187 and the lower electrodes 188-190 contact each other closely.
    </p>
    <p num="220">
      The optimum total thickness of the lower electrodes 188-190 is 1300  Angstrom , thus allowing the difference in level of the capacitor section to be smaller than in the conventional semiconductor storage device in which a barrier metal is interposed between the lower electrode and the polysilicon plug.
      <br/>
      Hence the inaccuracy in the photolithographic process can be suppressed.
    </p>
    <p num="221">
      In the above embodiments, the upper electrode UE of the capacitor section is formed of a combination of the PtRh film and the PtRhOx film, the PtRhOx film alone, or the PtRh film alone, or a combination of the Pt film and the PtRhOx film, similarly to the lower electrode LE.
      <br/>
      However, the same effects are obtainable even though the upper electrode UE is formed of only the Pt film having a thickness of 1000  Angstrom .
    </p>
    <p num="222">
      In the above-mentioned embodiments and also in embodiments to be described later, if the lower electrode LE of the capacitor section is heat-treated in a nitrogen atmosphere at 400 (degree)  C.-700 (degree)  C. (preferably, 550 (degree)  C.), the crystallizability of the lower electrode is improved.
      <br/>
      Consequently, it is possible to reduce the leakage current of the ferroelectric thin film or the high dielectric thin film formed on the lower electrode LE.
      <br/>
      However, if the heat-treatment is performed at a temperature of lower than 400 (degree)  C., the crystallizability of the lower electrode is not improved.
      <br/>
      Also, if the heat-treatment is performed at a temperature of more than 700 (degree)  C., the flatness of the surface of the lower electrode LE is damaged.
    </p>
    <p num="223">In the fourth embodiment or the seventh embodiment, a PtOx film or a PtRhOx film may be further formed by annealing the uppermost-layer lower electrode consisting of the PtRh film or the Pt film in an oxygen atmosphere to thereby oxidize the surface thereof, as done in the second and sixth embodiments.</p>
    <p num="224">
      In the fourth through eighth embodiments, the lowermost-layer lower electrode consisting of the PtRh film or the Pt film is formed directly on the polysilicon plug.
      <br/>
      By thus forming directly on the polysilicon plug a film of Pt or an alloy of Pt which are highly reactive with the polysilicon, contact between the polysilicon plug and the lower electrode is improved.
      <br/>
      Due to the close contact between the polysilicon plug and the lower electrode, the surface of the polysilicon plug is prevented from being oxidized by oxygen diffused from the PtRhOx film forming the lower electrode in the process of heat-treatment of the ferroelectric thin film.
    </p>
    <p num="225">
      However, because Pt in the PtRh film or the Pt film forming the lowermost-layer lower electrode is highly reactive with the polysilicon, a reaction tends to take place to form a silicide or the like in the process of forming the lower-most-layer lower electrode and in a later heat-treating process.
      <br/>
      Thus, it is necessary to set the film-forming temperature of the lower electrode to 250 (degree)  C., which temperature is much lower than an optimum temperature.
      <br/>
      Therefore, it is difficult to obtain the lower electrode of a good film quality.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, the contact resistance between the polysilicon plug and the lower electrode is apt to be unstable or high.

      Then, a contact hole having a diameter of 0.5  MU m is formed in the interlaminar insulation film 206, using the photolithographic method and dry etching method.
      <br/>
      Then, tungsten is filled in the contact hole by the CVD method.
      <br/>
      Thereafter, the surface of the tungsten is flattened by the CMP method to thereby form the tungsten plug 207.
    </p>
    <p num="236">
      Then, using the DC magnetron sputtering method, a PtRh film having a thickness of 700  Angstrom  is deposited directly on the tungsten plug 207 at 450 (degree)  C. to form the lower-layer lower electrode 208.
      <br/>
      Then, using the DC magnetron reactive sputtering method, a PtRhOx film having a thickness of 300  Angstrom  is formed on the lower-layer lower electrode 208 at 450 (degree)  C. to form the upper-layer lower electrode 209.
    </p>
    <p num="237">
      In the tenth embodiment, because the plug is formed of W which is less reactive with Pt than Si is, a film-forming temperature for forming the lower electrodes 208 and 209 is able to be set to an optimum value.
      <br/>
      Therefore, in the tenth embodiment, the temperature for forming the lower electrodes 208 and 209 is set to 450 (degree)  C., which temperature allows a good film quality to be achieved.
      <br/>
      Thus, the contact resistance between the tungsten plug 207 and the lower electrodes 208 and 209 is made a low, stable value.
    </p>
    <p num="238">
      The thickness of the PtRh film as the lower-layer lower electrode 208 is required to be 200  Angstrom  or more to prevent oxygen from permeating the PtRh film to the tungsten plug 207 to thereby oxidize the surface of the tungsten plug 207 in a later process of forming the PtRhOx film.
      <br/>
      The thickness of the PtRhOx film as the upper-layer lower electrode 209 is required to be 300  Angstrom  or more to prevent the oxygen atmosphere from permeating to the tungsten plug 207 in forming the ferroelectric thin film 210.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, the entire thickness of the lower electrodes is required to be 500  Angstrom  or more.
      <br/>
      On the other hand, the entire thickness of the lower electrodes is required to be 2000  Angstrom  or less because a fine processing is performed in a later stage.

    <p num="239">
      The ratio between the elements of the PtRh film 208 is Pt:Rh=80:20.

      The ratio between the elements of the PtRhOx film 209 is Pt:Rh:O=70:15:15.
      <br/>
      The PtRh film 208 and the PtRhOx film 209 are formed by adjusting the gas flow rates of all gases so that the flow ratio of argon to oxygen is Ar:O=2:1 and that the atmospheric pressure inside a reaction chamber is 10 mTorr.
    </p>
    <p num="240">
      If a Rh content in the PtRh film 208 is above 80%, the crystallizability of the Pt having an orientation of (111) as its main peak becomes unfavorable.
      <br/>
      Consequently, it is difficult for the PZT ferroelectric thin film 210 formed on the upper-layer lower electrode 209 to crystallize.
      <br/>
      In addition, the capacitor leakage current of the PZT film disadvantageously increases.
      <br/>
      Thus, it is necessary that the content of Rh in the PtRh film 208 is 80% or less.
    </p>
    <p num="241">
      If the content of Rh in the PtRhOx film 209 is less than 10%, oxygen cannot be blocked off sufficiently during the heat treatment.
      <br/>
      Further, if a content of oxygen in the PtRhOx film 209 is more than 40%, the crystallizability and morphology of the PtRhOx film 209 deteriorate and thus the PZT film 210 cannot be sufficiently crystallized.
      <br/>
      On the other hand, if the oxygen content in the PtRhOx film 209 is less than 5%, the oxygen stocking effect of the PtRhOx film 209 is reduced.
      <br/>
      More, specifically, when the ferroelectric thin film 210 is repeatedly subjected to polarization inversion, oxygen shortage occurs in the ferroelectric thin film 210 at a site in the vicinity of the upper-layer lower electrode 209.
      <br/>
      Thus, the ferroelectric thin film 210 does not display the ferroelectricity.
      <br/>
      Therefore, if the oxygen content in the PtRhOx film 209 is less than 5%, the oxygen stocking effect of the PtRhOx film 209 is reduced.

      <br/>
      Further, the PtRhOx film 209 is formed on the PtRh film 208.
      <br/>
      The PtRhOx film 209 functions as a block or barrier for preventing the diffusion of oxygen to the tungsten plug 207 in heat-treating the ferroelectric thin film 210 in an oxygen atmosphere.
      <br/>
      On the other hand, the PtRh film 208 functions as a block for preventing the diffusion of the oxygen to the tungsten plug 207 in forming the PtRhOx film 209.

      <br/>
      Accordingly, the PtRh film 208 and the PtRhOx film 209 can be continuously formed, which simplifies the process.

    <p num="244">
      Thereafter, a sol-gel method is used to form the PZT ferroelectric thin film 210 having a thickness of 2000  Angstrom .

      The method of forming the PZT film is described below in detail.
    </p>
    <p num="245">
      Initially, a sol-gel feed solution consisting of 2-methoxyethanol serving as a solvent, lead acetate, titanium isopropoxide, and zirconium isopropoxide is prepared such that the content ratio among Pb, Ti, and Zr in the solution becomes 100:52:48.
      <br/>
      Then, using a spinner rotating at 3000 r.p.m., the solution is applied to a silicon wafer having the lower electrodes 208 and 209 formed thereon.
      <br/>
      Then, the applied film is dried in the atmosphere at 150 (degree)  C. for 10 minutes and then, sintered temporarily in the atmosphere at 400 (degree)  C. for 30 minutes.
      <br/>
      This process is repeated three to five times until the thickness of a resulting film becomes 2000  Angstrom .
      <br/>
      Then, using the RTA method, heat treatment for crystallization of the film is carried out at 650 (degree)  C. for 30 seconds in an atmosphere of combined nitrogen and oxygen.
      <br/>
      The ratio of the flow rate of nitrogen to that of oxygen is set to 4:1.

    <p num="246">
      Then, the thus formed ferroelectric thin film (PZT film) 210 and the lower electrodes 208 and 209 are processed to the size of 2.6  MU m square by the dry etching method.

      Then, a silicon oxide film is formed as the interlaminar insulation film 212 by the CVD method.
      <br/>
      Then, a contact hole is formed through the interlaminar insulation film 212 formed on the ferroelectric thin film 210.
    </p>
    <p num="247">Then, a Pt film having a thickness of 1000  Angstrom  is formed as the upper electrode 213 on the capacitor section by the DC magnetron sputtering method.</p>
    <p num="248">
      Then, the upper electrode 213 is processed by the dry etching method, using a chlorine gas.
      <br/>
      And then, a silicon oxide film as the insulation film 214 is formed by the CVD method.
      <br/>
      Then, a contact hole is formed above the source region 203 of the CMOS section, and the lead electrode 215 of the source region 203 is formed of aluminum by the DC magnetron sputtering method.
    </p>
    <p num="249">
      A triangular wave was applied between the lead electrode 215 and the upper electrode 213 of the capacitor section having the ferroelectric substance to determine the ferroelectric characteristics.
      <br/>
      The peak values of the triangular wave were 1 V and 5 V, and the frequency thereof was 78 Hz.
      <br/>
      The result was that as shown in FIG. 15, a saturated polarization value Ps at 5 V was 15.2  MU C/cm2 and Pr=8.8  MU C/cm2.
      <br/>
      That is, the ferroelectric characteristic value was large enough to be used as the ferroelectric capacitor.
      <br/>
      Further, a symmetric hysteresis loop was obtained.

      This proves that the tungsten plug 207 and the lower electrodes 208 and 209 contact each other closely.

    <p num="250">
      As described above, in the tenth embodiment, because the lower electrode LE formed on the tungsten plug 207 consists of the PtRh film 208 and the PtRhOx film 209, the PtRhOx film blocks the diffusion of oxygen to the tungsten plug 207 in forming the ferroelectric thin film 210.
      <br/>
      Thus, the surface of the tungsten plug 207 is prevented from being oxidized, which allows the capacitor section and the CMOS section to contact each other closely.

    <p num="251">
      Consequently, it is unnecessary to provide the semiconductor storage device with a barrier metal of TiN which was required in the conventional semiconductor storage device.

      Hence, the difference in level, or unevenness, of the capacitor section is allowed to be small.
    </p>
    <p num="252">
      Further, because the PtRh film 208 is formed directly on the tungsten plug 207, it is possible to prevent oxygen from diffusing to the tungsten plug 207 in forming the PtRhOx film 209.

      Therefore, the contact between the capacitor section and the CMOS section is further improved.
    </p>
    <p num="253">
      In this case, because W is less reactive with Pt than Si is, the W of the tungsten plug 207 and the Pt of the PtRh film 208 do not react with each other in forming the PtRh film 208 and in heat-treating the ferroelectric thin film 210.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, the film-forming temperature of the lower electrodes 208 and 209 can be set to 450 (degree)  C., so that the lower electrodes 208 and 209 having a fine film quality are obtained.
      <br/>
      That is, in the tenth embodiment, the contact resistance between the tungsten plug 207 and the lower electrodes 208 and 209 is set to a low and stable value.

      However, the PtRh film 208 may be replaced with the Pt film.

      As a result, a symmetric hysteresis loop having values of Ps=43.4  MU C/cm2 and Pr=23.4  MU C/cm2 was obtained.
      <br/>
      That is, ferroelectric characteristic values large enough to be used as the ferroelectric capacitor was obtained.
      <br/>
      This proves that the tungsten plug 227 and the lower electrodes 228, 229, and 230 contact each other closely.
    </p>
    <p num="268">
      The optimum sum of the thicknesses of the lower electrodes 228, 229, and 230 is 1500  Angstrom .
      <br/>
      Thus, the difference in level of the capacitor section is allowed to be smaller than that of the conventional capacitor section in which a barrier metal is interposed between the polysilicon plug and the lower electrode.
      <br/>
      Hence the errors occurring in the photolithographic process are reduced.
    </p>
    <p num="269">
      As described above, in the eleventh embodiment, because the plug for contacting the capacitor section and the CMOS section each other is formed of W, the W of the tungsten plug 227 and the Pt of the PtRh film 228 hardly react with each other in forming the PtRh film 228 and in heat-treating the ferroelectric thin film 231.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, the film-forming temperature for the lower electrodes 228, 229, and 230 can be set to 450 (degree)  C. to obtain the lower electrodes having a good film quality.
      <br/>
      That is, the contact resistance between the tungsten plug and the lower electrodes is set to low and stable values.
    </p>
    <p num="270">In addition, because the Pt film having an orientation (111) is formed as the uppermost layer of the lower electrode, it is possible to form the PZT film having a favorable crystallizability and hence improve the ferroelectric characteristics and the leakage current characteristics.</p>
    <p num="271">
      In the eleventh embodiment, the PtRh film 228 is formed as the lowermost-layer lower electrode to prevent oxygen from diffusing to the tungsten plug 227 in forming the PtRhOx film 209.
      <br/>
      Further, the Pt film 230 is formed as the uppermost-layer lower electrode to improve the characteristics of the ferroelectric thin film 231.
      <br/>
      However, it is possible to obtain similar effects even though the lower electrode LE is formed of the Pt film, the PtRhOx film and the Pt or PtRh film laminated in this order from the tungsten plug 227 side.
    </p>
    <p num="272">
      In the first through eighth embodiments, and the tenth and eleventh embodiments, a ferroelectric substance of PZT is used to form the ferroelectric thin film, but alternatively it is also possible to use the following substances: PbTiO3, (Pbx La1-x)TiO3 (0 &lt;= x &lt;= 1), (Pbx La1-x) (Zry Ti1-y)O3 (0 &lt;= x &lt;= 1, 0 &lt;= y &lt;= 1), Bi4 Ti3 O12, BaTiO3, BaMgF4, LiNbO3, LiTaO3.
      <br/>
      SrBi2 Ti2 O9, YMnO3, Sr2 Nb2 O7, La2 Ti2 O7, and SrBi2 (Tax Nb1-x)2 O9 (0 &lt;= x &lt;= 1).
      <br/>
      With these substances, similar effects are obtained.
      <br/>
      Further, it is possible to obtain similar effects even though (Bax Sr1-x)TiO3 (0 &lt;= x &lt;= 1), a high dielectric substance, is used as in the ninth embodiment.
    </p>
    <p num="273">Although the sol-gel method and the sputtering method are used in the above embodiments as the film-forming method, the MOD (metal organic deposition) method, the vacuum vaporization method, the MOCVD (metal organic CVD) method, or the reactive magnetron sputtering method may be used.</p>
    <p num="274">Further, although the P-type silicon substrate is used as the silicon substrate in the above embodiments, similar effects are obtained even though an N-type silicon substrate is used.</p>
    <p num="275">
      The invention being thus described, it will be obvious that the same may be varied in many ways.
      <br/>
      Such variations are not to be regarded as a departure from the spirit and scope of the invention, and all such modifications as would be obvious to one skilled in the art are intended to be included within the scope of the following claims.
