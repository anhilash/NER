      A method of forming non-spherically shaped solder interconnects, preferably conical, for attachment of electronic components in an electronic module.
      <br/>
      Preferably, the solder interconnects of the present invention are cone shaped and comprise of depositing a first solder followed by a second solder having a lower reflow temperature than the first solder.
      <br/>
      Warm placement of the electronic component at a somewhat elevated temperature than room temperature but less than the solder reflow temperature reduces the force required during placement of a semiconductor chip to a substrate.
      <br/>
      After warm placement, reflow of the module occurs at the lower reflow temperature of the second solder.
      <br/>
      The conical shape of the solder interconnects are formed by a heated coining die which may also coin a portion of the interconnects with flat surfaces for stand-offs.
      <br/>
      The ability of the cone shaped solder interconnects to meet the opposing surface of a chip or substrate at different heights accommodates the camber typically associated with chip and substrate surfaces.

      Field of the Invention
    </p>
    <p num="3">
      This invention relates to the manufacture of electronic modules, namely flip chip packaging, utilizing an improved method of assembling the module.
      <br/>
      The improved method allows for enhanced contact with less stressing on the solder joints used to electrically interconnect a chip and a substrate resulting in an electronic module having higher integrity and reliability.
    </p>
    <p num="4">2. Description of Related Art</p>
    <p num="5">
      Multi-layer ceramic electronic components are typically joined together by soldering pads on a surface of one of the electronic components to corresponding pads on the surface of the other component.
      <br/>
      Controlled Collapse Chip Connection is an interconnect technology developed by IBM as an alternative to wire bonding.
      <br/>
      This technology is generally known as C4 technology or flip chip packaging.
      <br/>
      Broadly stated, one or more integrated circuit chips are mounted above a single or multi-layer ceramic substrate and pads on the chip are electrically and mechanically connected to corresponding pads on the substrate by a plurality of electrical connections such as solder bumps.
      <br/>
      The integrated circuit chips may be assembled in an array such as a 10 * 10 array on the multi-layer ceramic surface.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      One of the key features in using flip chip packaging is the ability to accommodate a considerable distortion in pattern between the chip and the substrate.
      <br/>
      This accommodation is due to a self-alignment capability produced by surface tension minimization of the solder joints.
      <br/>
      What cannot be tolerated, however, is any significant deviation from planarity between the chip surface and the substrate surface since electrical interconnection cannot occur unless the solder bump on the chip physically contacts the substrate.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      Multi-layer ceramic (MLC) chip carriers with flip chip technology often possess, due to design, the tendency to have localized bulges at the location of underlying substrate vias.
      <br/>
      In addition, residual camber (non-planarity) from sintering the substrate can lead to further non-planarity across the chip site.
      <br/>
      A camber magnitude much greater than about 25 to 30 microns will lead to non-contact opens after a chip join attempt.
      <br/>
      Thus, it is desirable to find a way of overcoming the non-planarity typically found on a chip and substrate used in flip chip packaging resulting in better solder interconnections.

      Both surfaces are flat which would not overcome the non-planarity of a chip and substrate when joining such components in flip chip packaging.

    <p num="51">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT(S)</p>
    <p num="52">
      In describing the preferred embodiment of the present invention, reference will be made herein to FIGS. 1-9 of the drawings in which like numerals refer to like features of the invention.
      <br/>
      Features of the invention are not necessarily shown to scale in the drawings.
    </p>
    <p num="53">
      In FIG. 1, a semiconductor chip 20 has been processed through all prior processes such as device formation, and wiring layers as shown.
      <br/>
      At this stage, the wafer 20 has a deposited blanket seed layer 22 such as a chromium copper alloy or a titanium copper alloy.
      <br/>
      Upon the seed layer 22, a thick film resist 24 is deposited, patterned and developed according to a desired array for solder interconnections.
      <br/>
      A typical photoresist used in this process is Riston (tm) .
    </p>
    <p num="54">
      Once the photo resist 24 has been developed, a solder preform is formed in the exposed areas of the resist.
      <br/>
      Preferably, a two layer solder preform 26 is plated or otherwise deposited as shown in FIGS. 2 and 3.
      <br/>
      The first solder layer 260 may be a high melting solder alloy such as 97% lead/3% tin having a melting point of about 317 (degree)  C. The second solder layer 262 may comprise a lower melting solder alloy such as a eutectic tin/lead alloy, tin/bismuth alloy or tin/indium alloy with melting points in the range of about 118 to 183 (degree)  C. After these layers are deposited, the resist 24 is stripped off and the seed layer 22 is etched off.
    </p>
    <p num="55">
      The dimensions appropriate for certain high density solder preforms are shown in FIG. 3.
      <br/>
      The first solder layer 260 has a height of approximately 0.13 mm. The second solder layer 262 has a thickness of approximately 0.025 mm. The angle alpha of the solder pyramid is determined by the type of resist used, the exposure parameters, and the development parameters utilized.
      <br/>
      Typically, the angle alpha of the solder pyramid will be in the range of about 75 to 80 (degree)  for a negative resist such as Riston (tm) .
    </p>
    <p num="56">
      According to a method of the present invention, once the solder interconnect 26 has been formed, a coining tool is used to form or mold the cone shaped solder as shown in FIGS. 4 and 5.
      <br/>
      A coining tool 30 is used which has an array of cavities 34 fabricated into a metal plate.
      <br/>
      The metal plate may be made from molybdenum, nickel alloy, titanium, titanium/tungsten alloy, stainless steel, or any such material not wettable by the solder.
      <br/>
      The cavity array 34 is made such that each cavity is shaped with an opening whose slope is close to the slope of the desired solder preforms made by the process described above.
      <br/>
      In addition, the inner part of the cavity 34 has a cone shape, whose slope is less steep than the entrance hole.
    </p>
    <p num="57">
      The metal plate of the coining tool may also contain a heating coil 32 or other similar heating device to heat the plate to a temperature in the range of about 140 to 170 (degree)  C. This coining tool 30 is aligned to, and pressed down upon the solder preforms.
      <br/>
      With the combination of heat and applied pressure, the lower melting solder layer 262 will undergo a plastic deformation, and flow into the cone shape cavity array 34 of the coining tool 30.
      <br/>
      FIG. 5 depicts a solder preform 26 which has been shaped into a cone shape.
      <br/>
      The angle alpha of the first solder layer 260 will still be about 75 to 80 (degree)  while the angle alpha of the second solder layer 262 will have an angle of about 65 to 70 (degree)  if the cavity 34 has a slope of about 80 (degree) .
    </p>
    <p num="58">
      The main use of these cone shape solder preforms is for joining silicon chips to substrates with camber such that the cone tips will make contact with substrate pads at different z axis heights from the device surface.
      <br/>
      To assure that the cone shape solders are not deformed too much during the placement of chips, standoffs at four corner locations on the chips may be required.
      <br/>
      The metal die used to fabricate the cone shape solder preforms can also be used to create standoffs.
      <br/>
      This is shown in FIGS. 6 and 7.
      <br/>
      The four corner locations of the cavities in the die 30 will have a flat surface rather than of the conical shape.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, polyimide standoffs may be formed on either of the chip or substrate surfaces according to known methods in the art.
    </p>
    <p num="59">
      In FIG. 6 is shown a chip 20 with solder preforms 26 and 36.
      <br/>
      A coining tool 30 having a heating element 32 has cavities 34 for shaping a portion of the solder preforms into a conical shape.
      <br/>
      Cavities 36 have a truncated conical shape for coining solder preforms into a truncated cone shape with a flattened surface.
      <br/>
      The resulting truncated cone shape solder preforms become standoffs during assembly of the electronic module to control the collapse of the cone shape solder preforms of chip 20 onto a substrate, package or board.
    </p>
    <p num="60">
      The cone shaped solder preforms 26 will typically be 25-40 microns higher than the standoff solder preforms 36 (referring to Ht).
      <br/>
      The standoff height Hs will typically be about 0.13 mm for the dimensions of the solder preforms described above.
      <br/>
      As a result of these differences in height between the cone shape solder preforms and the standoff solder preforms, the placement of these devices will accommodate up to about 25-40 microns of height differential in the z axis direction between the substrate surface and the chip surface to which these solder preforms are attached to.
      <br/>
      This alleviates the problems associated with the camber found on many substrate sites.
    </p>
    <p num="61">
      In assembling an electronic module according to the present invention, FIG. 8 shows a partial cross-sectional view of electronic components comprising a chip 4 having cone shape solder interconnections 8 formed on its surface with a polyimide standoff 10.
      <br/>
      The chip 4 will be interconnected to substrate 2 having bonding pads 6 corresponding to the solder interconnections 8 on the chip 4.
      <br/>
      Chip 4 will be placed over substrate 2 in the direction of arrow A. The polyimide standoff 10 will contact the substrate 2 surface in the vicinity of arrow B while the solder interconnections 8 will contact the corresponding bonding pad 6 on substrate surface 2 in the vicinity of arrow C. Of course, the cone shape solder interconnections and standoffs may be formed on the substrate 2 as well.
    </p>
    <p num="62">
      The resultant electronic module 90 is shown in FIG. 9 where the conical shapes of the solder interconnections 8 and the polyimide standoff 10 limit the extent of collapse of the solder preforms 8 during placement.
      <br/>
      Preferably, placement of chip 4 onto substrate 2 is done at a somewhat elevated temperature greater than room temperature but less than the solder reflow temperature, most preferably about 100 to 150 (degree)  C. to reduce the force required during placement.
      <br/>
      This type of warm placement reduces the stresses placed on all the components during the assembly of the electronic module while the conical shape of the solder interconnections also allow increased stability and reliability of the solder interconnections.
      <br/>
      After warm placement, the electronic module is taken through a furnace reflow cycle with a peak temperature such that the lower temperature solder layer 262 is reflowed.
      <br/>
      Typically for Sn eutectic solder the reflow temperature is in the range of 190-210 (degree)  C.
    </p>
    <p num="63">
      The present invention achieves the objects recited above.
      <br/>
      The use of the solder preforms of the present invention provides a solution to overcome the non-planarity of electronic components used in assembling electronic modules.
      <br/>
      The ability of the solder preforms, preferably having a cone shape, to meet the opposing surface of a chip or substrate at different heights accommodates the non-planarity typically found on chip and substrate surfaces.
      <br/>
      This improves the solder interconnections and results in electronic modules with increased reliability and integrity.
      <br/>
      The ease in producing standoffs while also forming the solder preforms reduces the number of steps in an already cumbersome manufacturing process.
      <br/>
      Additionally, joining the chip and substrate at a reduced temperature further reduces the thermal stresses placed on the components during assembly while providing controlled placement of the components.
    </p>
    <p num="64">
      While the present invention has been particularly described, in conjunction with a specific preferred embodiment, it is evident that many alternatives, modifications and variations will be apparent to those skilled in the art in light of the foregoing description.
      <br/>
      It is therefore contemplated that the appended claims will embrace any such alternatives, modifications and variations as falling within the true scope and spirit of the present invention.
