      Field of the Invention
    </p>
    <p num="2">The present invention relates to a system and method for monitoring the departure of a child from a retail store or other area having an electronic article surveillance system.</p>
    <p num="3">2. Description of the Prior Art</p>
    <p num="4">
      A lost or abducted child is a parent's greatest fear.
      <br/>
      While shopping with a small child, a parent or guardian remains constantly on watch to make sure that the child does not wonder off.
      <br/>
      From the store's perspective, this constant concern presents a major distraction, leading to loss of sales.
      <br/>
      Many retail stores have installed a children's play area to minimize the shopping parent's distraction.
      <br/>
      These play areas do not effectively prevent a child from wandering unless the play area is supervised.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      Alternative measures directed to solving the wandering child dilemma have been the subject of much investigation.
      <br/>
      Numerous devices have been disclosed over the years to tackle this problem. U.S. Pat. No. 5,848,567 to Colaianni discloses a leash adapted to attach a child to the guardian. U.S. Pat. No. 5,510,771 to Marshall employs a cable that alarms if it is broken.
      <br/>
      These devices put sever limitations on the mobility of child and guardian. U.S. Pat. No. 4,694,284 to Leveille et al. transmits an alarm signal when a collar is removed from a child. U.S. Pat. No. 5,617,074 to White discloses a button having a transmitter and adapted to be attached to a child's clothing or wrist strap.
      <br/>
      The button actuates an alarm if it is tampered with.
      <br/>
      Such devices may help deter abduction, but provide a less than satisfactory solution to the problem presented by a wondering child.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      Generally, electronic devices designed either to monitor children within an enclosed area, or within the framework of an individual system.
      <br/>
      In the first case, the system alarms when the child leaves the monitored area.
      <br/>
      In the second case, the child wears a tag and the guardian carries a control unit.
      <br/>
      When the child strays too far from the unit, the distance between the two causes the sounding of an alarm carried by either or both of the control unit and the tag.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      U.S. Pat. No. 5,337,041 to Friedman employs a tag worn by a child and adapted to be triggered by the guardian to sound an alarm when the child is out of sight. U.S. Pat. No. 5,307,763 to Arthur et al. places a loop antenna around the border of an area appointed for confinement of a child and tag alarms adapted to be worn by a child when appointed for transport outside the protected area.
      <br/>
      This device is expensive, requiring purchase of a monitoring system and wiring of an entire monitored area. U.S. Pat. No. 5,640,147 to Chek et al. discloses a tag adapted to be worn by a child.
      <br/>
      The tag is provided with a microphone and transmitter which enables a parent to listen in and thereby monitor the child's activity.
      <br/>
      These devices may help deter abduction, but they fail to solve the problem presented by the wondering child.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      Numerous devices are adapted to trigger an alarm when a battery powered tag worn by the child exceeds a predetermined distance from a transmitter carried by the guardian.
      <br/>
      Representative of these devices are those disclosed by: DE Patent 19,608,348 to Whitehurst; U.S. Pat. No. 5,661,460 to Budzyna et al.; WO Patent 9,618,913 to Budzyna et al.; WO Patent 9,627,173 to Campana; WO Patent 9,614,625 to Edwards; U.S. Pat.

No. 4,899,135 to Gharariiran; U.S. Pat. No. 5,557,259 to Musa; U.S. Pat. No. 5,461,365 to Baringer et al.

      <br/>
      Retail stores oftentimes generate large amounts of electronic noise.
      <br/>
      Such noise typically eminates from point of sale equipment and electronic article surveillance systems.
      <br/>
      These devices frequently exhibit extreme performance variability with differing electronic noise environments. U.S. Pat. No. 5,629,678 to Gargano et al. employs a tag that is implanted in the child; and which has obvious shortcomings.
      <br/>
      In each of these devices there is imposed an additional restriction that impedes the performance thereof.
      <br/>
      The additional restriction requires that the store install special monitoring equipment or that the guardian carry a monitoring unit.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      Additional variations of a child monitoring system have been disclosed.
      <br/>
      British Patent 2,291,303 to Duffy provides direction to a transmitter worn by the child.
      <br/>
      In U.S. Pat. No. 4,785,291, the tone changes with distance changes. U.S. Pat. No. 5,119,072 to Hemingway discloses a weak signal alarm with a microphone. U.S. Pat. No. 5,021,794 to Lawrence uses transmitter/receiver and works through the cellular phone system.
      <br/>
      GB Patent 2,218,245 to Hoyle et al. discloses a device that protects babies from unauthorized removal from a hospital.
      <br/>
      GB Patent 2,248,330 to Seeman uses infrared or sonic signals.
      <br/>
      WO Patent 8,703,404 to Royoux has LEDS indicating direction and distance.
      <br/>
      In each of these devices there is imposed the further requirement that the store install special monitoring equipment or the guardian carry a monitoring unit.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      EP Patent 323,041 to Newman et al. uses a magnetic strip in a wrist or ankle strap to protect against unauthorized removal of an infant.
      <br/>
      This is one of the technologies used in electronic article surveillance (EAS) systems.
      <br/>
      Numerous EAS patents exists that employ a magnetic strip.
      <br/>
      Representative of these EAS patents is U.S. Pat. No. 4,553,136 to Anderson, et al.
      <br/>
      Unfortunately, devices utilizing EAS technology have a very short detection range, typically three feet, and suffer from a low detection rate.
      <br/>
      Such systems are also susceptible to false alarms.
    </p>
    <p num="11">
      When EAS systems are used, markers are attached to articles to be protected.
      <br/>
      The markers are responsive to an electromagnetic field generated at the store's exit by the EAS system's transmitter.
      <br/>
      Each marker must be removed or deactivated before an article to which it is affixed leaves the store.
      <br/>
      Otherwise, upon exiting the store, the marker disturbs the field.
      <br/>
      This disturbance is detected by the EAS system, and an alarm is triggered. U.S. Pat. No. 4,510,489 discloses a technology used in EAS systems that have been employed to protect infants from unauthorized removal from hospitals.
      <br/>
      EAS markers are generally inexpensive and operate as a passive device, without their own power.
      <br/>
      As a result, the operating range of EAS markers is limited and their detection rate, though acceptable for some applications, is much too low to assure protection of children.
    </p>
    <p num="12">
      Implementation of a child monitoring system within a retail environment in the conventional way would require the store to purchase and maintain a system.
      <br/>
      If the retail facility already possessed an EAS system, it would have to maintain both systems.
      <br/>
      This is a costly solution.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, with conventional child monitoring systems, protection of each child would require the responsible parent to provide his own individual system.
      <br/>
      The shear number of teachings directed to child monitoring systems and the consipcuous absence from the marketplace of such systems strongly suggests that the problem remains to be solved.
    </p>
    <p num="13">Accordingly, there remains a need in the art for a cost-effective system that exhibits an extremely high detection rate and which accurately and reliably monitors and protects against the unauthorized departure of children from retail stores.</p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="14">The present invention provides a system and method for monitoring the departure of a child from a retail store or other area wherein an electronic article surveillance system has previously been installed.</p>
    <p num="15">
      A large number of retail stores currently have electronic article surveillance systems, and more stores are employing them every year.
      <br/>
      The present invention is especially suited for and leverages the use of these electronic article surveillance systems by adding child monitoring functionality.
    </p>
    <p num="16">
      Generally stated, the present invention provides an apparatus for monitoring the departure of a child from an exit, comprising: an electronic article surveillance system for generating an electromagnetic field at the exit; and a tag worn by the child, the tag being responsive to the electromagnetic field; whereby an alarm carried by the tag is triggered upon departure of the child from the exit.
      <br/>
      Optionally, the tag is provided with alarm means for triggering an alarm carried by the electronic article surveillance system upon departure of the child from the exit.
    </p>
    <p num="17">The invention further provides a tag for monitoring the departure of a child from an exit having an electronic article surveillance system, comprising: antenna means for receiving an electromagnetic field generated by the electronic article surveillance system; alarm means for sounding an alarm; detecting means for detecting the electromagnetic field, the detecting means causing the alarm means to sound an alarm upon detection of the electromagnetic field; power means, for powering the tag; housing means for encasing the antenna means, the detecting means, the alarm means, and the power means; and attaching means for attaching the housing means to the child.</p>
    <p num="18">
      Optionally, the tag further comprises: generating means for generating a signal mimicking an electronic article surveillance marker, and switching means for switching the antenna between the detecting means and the generating means, whereby upon detection of the electromagnetic field, detecting means causes the alarm means to sound an alarm and the switching means to connect the antenna to the generating means causing the electronic article surveillance system to alarm.
      <br/>
      As a further option, the tag comprises resetting means for resetting the alarm.
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      Still further, the invention provides a method for detecting the departure of a child from an exit provided with an electronic article surveillance system, comprising the steps of: (a) attaching a tag to the child, the tag being responsive to the electromagnetic field generated by the electronic article surveillance system at the exit; receiving the electromagnetic field; and sounding an alarm on the tag, the alarm being triggered by departure of the child from the exit.
      <br/>
      Optionally, the method further comprises the step of sounding the alarm of electronic article surveillance system upon departure from the exit of a child to which the tag is attached.
    </p>
    <p num="20">In another embodiment of the invention, the tag comprises: a first passive marker having an elongated axis; and a second passive marker having an elongated axis, where the elongated axis of the first passive marker is fixed in a position substantially perpendicular to the elongated axis of the second passive marker.</p>
    <p num="21">
      Advantageously, the present invention leverages a store's preexisting EAS system by adding thereto a child monitoring functionality.
      <br/>
      Stores without EAS systems can obtain the benefits of the theft protection and child monitoring functions by employing this invention.
      <br/>
      In addition, the method and apparatus of the invention are much more cost effective, efficient, and reliable than devices wherein the child monitoring function is approached in the conventional way.

    <heading>DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
    <p num="23">
      A significant number of retail stores presently utilize electronic article surveillance systems, and more stores and store chains are employing them every year.
      <br/>
      The present invention leverages the extant use of EAS systems by adding thereto child monitoring functionality.
    </p>
    <p num="24">
      Many retail stores employ EAS systems to protect against theft.
      <br/>
      Conventional EAS systems comprise a transmitter for generating an electromagnetic field at the exit of a retail establishment, a marker attached to an article to be protected from theft, and a receiver.
      <br/>
      The marker is responsive to the electromagnetic field.
      <br/>
      It is designed to be removed or deactivated before the article leaves the store.
      <br/>
      Otherwise, upon exit of the article, the marker disturbs the field.
      <br/>
      The disturbance is detected by the receiver and the EAS system's alarm is triggered.
    </p>
    <p num="25">
      Referring to FIG. 1 of the drawings, there is shown an apparatus for monitoring the departure of a child from an exit.
      <br/>
      Electronic article surveillance system 9 comprising transmitter 10 and receiver 12 is set across exit 14.
      <br/>
      Transmitter 10 generates an electromagnetic field at exit 14; and tag 20, worn by a child, is responsive to the electromagnetic field causing tag 20 to alarm on departure of the child from exit 14.
      <br/>
      Optionally, tag 20 is provided with means for alarming receiver 12.
    </p>
    <p num="26">Referring to FIG. 2, tag 20 comprises antenna means 42 for receiving the electromagnetic field generated by electronic article surveillance system 9; alarm means 46 for sounding an alarm; detecting means 44 for detecting the electromagnetic field, the detecting means 44 causeing alarm means 46 to sound an alarm upon detection of the electromagnetic field; power means 48, for powering tag 20; and housing means for encasing antenna means 42, detecting means 44, alarm means 46, and power means 48.</p>
    <p num="27">
      Antenna means 42 consists of a coil of wire and a capacitor tuned at the operating frequency of EAS system 9.
      <br/>
      Preferably, alarm means 46 is a piezoelectric or electromagnetic speaker.
      <br/>
      Detecting means 44 receives and identifies the field generated by transmitter 10 and is known in the art.
      <br/>
      Power means 48 is a battery, preferably a rechargeable type.
    </p>
    <p num="28">
      Optionally, as shown in FIG. 3, tag 20 further comprises: generating means 50 for generating a signal mimicking an electronic article surveillance marker; and switching means 52 for switching antenna means 42 between detecting means 44 and generating means 50.
      <br/>
      Upon detection of the electromagnetic field, detecting means 44 causes alarm means 46 to sound an alarm and switching means 52 to connect antenna means 42 to generating means 50 causing electronic article surveillance system 9 to alarm.
      <br/>
      As a further option, tag 40 further comprises resetting means 49 for resetting said alarm.
      <br/>
      Generating means 50 is a controlled oscillator generating a modulated carrier wave.
      <br/>
      The carrier wave frequency is that of transmitter 10 and the modulation mimics the anti theft marker of EAS system 9.
      <br/>
      Preferably, resetting means 49 is a momentary switch.
    </p>
    <p num="29">
      Alternatively, switching means 52 is eliminated and generating means 50 and detecting means 44 are both directly connected to antenna means 44.
      <br/>
      In this embodiment, the output impedance of generating means 50 needs to be sufficiently high that antenna means 42 does not appear as a short circuit to detecting means 44, but low enough to allow sufficient signal from generating means 50 to couple to antenna means 42.
    </p>
    <p num="30">The invention further encompasses a method for detecting the departure of a child, from exit 14 provided with an electronic article surveillance system 9, comprising the steps of: attaching tag 20 to the child, tag 20 being responsive to the electromagnetic field generated by electronic article surveillance system 9 at exit 14; receiving of the electromagnetic field; and sounding an alarm on tag 20.</p>
    <p num="31">Optionally, the method of this invention further comprises the step of sounding the alarm of electronic article surveillance system 9 upon departure of the child from exit 14.</p>
    <p num="32">
      As shown in FIGS. 4(a) and 4(b), tag 20 is housed in housing 22 and has opening 24 for alarm means 46.
      <br/>
      Preferably, tag 20 is provided with locking means 28 for receiving pin 29.
      <br/>
      Locking means 28 and pin 29 are known in the art for attaching EAS markers to clothing or other soft goods.
      <br/>
      Tag 20 is secured to garment 27 by pin 29 and locking means 28.
    </p>
    <p num="33">
      Alternatively, as shown in FIGS. 5 and 5(b) tag 20 is housed in housing 30 and has opening 32 for alarm means 46.
      <br/>
      Preferably, tag 20 is provided with locking means 38 for receiving pin 39.
      <br/>
      Locking means 38 and pin 39 are known in the art for attaching EAS markers to clothing or other soft goods.
      <br/>
      Tag 20 is secured to the wrist or ankle of the child using strap 33.
    </p>
    <p num="34">
      In another embodiment of the invention, shown in FIG. 6, the marker of EAS system 9 is modified for use in a child monitoring system.
      <br/>
      Tag 51 comprises; first passive marker 55 having an elongated axis; and second passive marker 56 having an elongated axis; whereby the elongated axis of first passive marker 55 is fixed perpendicular, or near perpendicular, to the elongated axis of second passive marker 56.
      <br/>
      EAS markers have preferred orientation with respect to the EAS system for best detection.
      <br/>
      By adding a second marker at a different orientation, the detection rate of an ordinary EAS marker is significantly enhanced to yield tag 51.
    </p>
    <p num="35">Having thus described the invention in rather full detail, it will be understood that such detail need not be strictly adhered to but that further changes and modifications may suggest themselves to one skilled in the art, all falling within the scope of the invention as defined by the subjoined claims.</p>
