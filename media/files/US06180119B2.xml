      It is known that light radiation with wavelengths ranging from 280 nm to 400 nm makes it possible for the human skin to brown and that radiation with wavelengths more particularly from 280 to 320 nm, known under the name of UV-B, cause erythemas and skin burns which can harm the development of natural tanning.
      <br/>
      For these reasons and for aesthetic reasons, there exists a continual demand for means for controlling this natural tanning, for the purpose of thus controlling the colour of the skin; it is thus advisable to screen out this UV-B radiation.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      It is also known that UV-A radiation, with wavelengths ranging from 320 to 400 nm, which causes the skin to brown, are capable of leading to a detrimental change in the lafter, in particular in the case of sensitive skin or skin which is continually exposed to solar radiation.
      <br/>
      In particular, UV-A radiation causes a loss of skin elasticity and the appearance of wrinkles, leading to premature skin ageing.
      <br/>
      It promotes the triggering of the erythemal reaction or accentuates this reaction in certain subjects and can even be the cause of phototoxic or photoallergic reactions.
      <br/>
      Thus, for aesthetic and cosmetic reasons, such as preservation of the natural elasticity of the skin, for example, more and more people wish to control the effect of UV-A radiation on their skin.
      <br/>
      It is thus desirable to screen out the UV-A radiation as well.
    </p>
    <p num="6">Thus, with the aim of providing protection of the skin and hair against all UV-A radiation which is as complete and as efficient as possible, use is generally made, in the manufacture of anti-sun compositions, of combinations of screening agents active in the UV-A and of screening agents active in the UV-B.</p>
    <p num="7">
      In this respect, a particularly advantageous family of UV-B screening agents is currently composed of cinnamic acid derivatives, and in particular 2-ethylhexyl p-methoxycinnamate, because these compounds exhibit a high intrinsic absorption power.
      <br/>
      In addition, other cinnamic acid derivatives have highly advantageous properties in cosmetics, such as, for example, caffeic acid, which is well known as a depigmenting agent.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      Now, some cinnamic acid derivatives exhibit the disadvantage of chemically degrading under certain conditions, in particular when they are exposed to UV radiation.
      <br/>
      When they are subjected to such degradation, these active principles, derived from cinnamic acid, lose their potential for activity.
    </p>
    <p num="9">Use is frequently made, in anti-UV compositions, of tocopherol derivatives, which are known for their properties in combating free radicals and which contribute, via these properties, to retaining the youthfulness of the skin.</p>
    <p num="10">
      However, the inventors have found that cinnamic acid derivatives, in particular 2-ethylhexyl p-methoxycinnamate, when they are in the presence of tocopherol derivatives and under UV irradiation, chemically degrade to a significant extent.
      <br/>
      Under these conditions, the combination of the two compounds no longer allows prolonged broad anti-sun protection of the skin and hair.
    </p>
    <p num="11">
      Such a degradation reaction is particularly significant when the cinnamic acid derivative is used in combination with another organic screening agent, in particular screening agents of the dibenzoylmethane family, which are anti-UV-A screening agents.
      <br/>
      In particular, the combination of cinnamic acid derivatives with 4-tert-butyl-4'-methoxydibenzoylmethane is highly advantageous.
      <br/>
      These screening agents are very often used in combination in skin and hair products because their spectra of activity are complementary.
    </p>
    <p num="12">Now, following significant research carried out in the field of the photoprotection mentioned above, the inventors have now discovered that the introduction of certain polyamino polymers, which will be defined more specifically hereinbelow, into a composition containing a cinnamic acid derivative, in particular 2-ethylhexyl p-methoxycinnamate, made it possible to improve, in an entirely remarkable way, the photostability of this compound within such compositions and thus the overall efficiency of these compositions.</p>

    <p num="20">A further subject-matter of the present invention is the use of a polyamino polymer in, or for the manufacture of, cosmetic and/or dermatological compositions containing a cinnamic acid derivative as defined above (formula (I)), in particular 2-ethylhexyl p-methoxycinnamate, optionally in combination with at least one derivative of formula (II) as defined above and/or in combination with at least one dibenzoylmethane derivative as defined above (formula (III)), with the aim of improving, in these compositions, the stability to UV radiation (photostability) of the cinnamic acid derivative.</p>

    </p>
    <p num="23">Other characteristics, aspects and advantages of the present invention will become apparent on reading the detailed description which will follow.</p>
    <p num="24">The polyamino polymers which can be used in the present invention can be in the linear polymer, hyperbranched polymer or dendrimer form.</p>
    <p num="25">
      Hyperbranched polymers are molecular constructions having a branched structure, generally around a core.
      <br/>
      Their structure is generally devoid of symmetry: the base units or monomers which have been used in the construction of the hyperbranched polymer can be different in nature and their distribution is irregular.
      <br/>
      The branches of the polymer can be different in nature and in length.
      <br/>
      The number of base units, or monomers, can be different depending on the different branching.
      <br/>
      While being asymmetric, hyperbranched polymers can have: an extremely branched structure, around a core; successive layers or generations of branching; a layer of terminal chains.
    </p>
    <p num="26">
      Hyperbranched polymers generally result from the polycondensation of one or more monomers ABx, A and B being reactive groups capable of reacting together and x being an integer greater than or equal to 2, but other preparation processes can be envisaged.
      <br/>
      Hyperbranched polymers are characterized by their degree of polymerization DP=1-b, b being the percentage of non-erminal functionalities in B which have not reacted with a group A. As the condensation is non-systematic, in contrast to the synthesis of dendrimers, the degree of polymerization is less than 100%.
      <br/>
      Usually, by known synthetic methods, DP is between 15 and 90%.
      <br/>
      A terminal group T on the hyperbranched polymer can be made to react in order to obtain a specific functionality at the chain end.
    </p>
    <p num="27">Such polymers are described in particular in B.I. Voit, Acta Polymer., 46, 87-99 (1995); EP-682,059; WO-9614346; WO-9614345; WO-9612754, the disclosures of which are specifically incorporated by reference herein.</p>
    <p num="28">
      Several hyperbranched polymers can be combined with one another, via a covalent bond or another type of bond, by means of their terminal groups.
      <br/>
      Such so-called bridged polymers come within the definition of hyperbranched polymers according to the present invention.
    </p>
    <p num="29">
      Dendrimers are highly branched polymers and oligomers, which are also known, having a well defined chemical structure and they are said to be "perfect" hyperbranched polymers.
      <br/>
      As a general rule, dendrimers comprise a core, a defined number of generations of branches, or spindles, and terminal groups.
      <br/>
      The generations of spindles are composed of structural units which are identical for the same generation of spindles and which can be identical or different for different generations of spindles.
      <br/>
      The generations of spindles extend radially in a geometrical progression from the core.
      <br/>
      The terminal groups of a dendrimer of the Nth generation are the terminal functional groups of the spindles of the Nth generation or terminal generation.
      <br/>
      Such polymers are described in particular in D. A. Tomalia, A. M. Naylor and W. A. Goddard III, Angewandte Chemie, Int.

      Dendrimers can also be defined more particularly by the following formula (DI):
      <br/>
      C�A1 B1 (A2 B2 ( . . . (An-1 Bn-1 (An Bn (T)rn)rn-1)rn-2 . . . )r2)r1 �s  (DI)

      C represents the core, connected via a number s of functionalities to s spindles A1 B1 via groups A1 ;
      <br/>
      s is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to the number of functionalities in C;
      <br/>
      the index i (i=1, 2 . . . n) is an integer which denotes the generation of each spindle;
      <br/>
      ri (i=1, 2 . . . n-1) represents the number of functionalities in the group Bi belonging to the spindle (Ai Bi), ri being an integer greater than or equal to 2;
      <br/>
      for each spindle (Ai Bi) (i=1, 2 . . . n), the group Bi is connected to ri groups Ai+1 of a spindle (Ai+1 Bi+1);
      <br/>
      each group Ai (i &gt;= 2) is connected to only one group Bi-1 of the spindle (Ai-1 Bi-1);
      <br/>
      the spindle of nth generation An Bn is chemically bonded to a number rn of terminal groups T, rn being an integer greater than or equal to zero.
    </p>
    <p num="32">The definition of dendrimers given above includes molecules with symmetrical branching; it also includes molecules with non-symmetrical branching, such as, for example, dendrimers in which the spindles are lysine groups, in which the branching of one generation of spindles on the preceding generation takes place on the  ALPHA  and  EPSILON  amines of the lysine, which results in a difference in the length of the spindles for the different branching.</p>
    <p num="33">
      Dense star polymers, starburst polymers and rod-shaped dendrimers are included in the present definition of dendrimers.
      <br/>
      The molecules known as arborols and cascade molecules also come within the definition of dendrimers according to the present invention.
