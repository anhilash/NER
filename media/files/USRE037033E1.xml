    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="1">
      The present invention relates to a pigment-dispersed composition for a color-filter (to be referred to as "pigment-dispersed color-filter composition" hereinafter).
      <br/>
      More specifically, it relates to a pigment-dispersed color-filter composition useful for the production of color filters of a liquid crystal display and a charge coupled device.
    </p>
    <p num="2">
      For producing a color filter of a liquid display, a dyeing method, a printing method and an electrodeposition method are known.
      <br/>
      In recent years, a photolithographic method using a pigment-dispersed photosensitive composition is particularly attracting attention in terms of color purity, dimensional accuracy and process resistance ("Color Liquid Crystal Display" page 173, edited by Shunsuke Kobayashi, published by Sangyotosho, 1990).
    </p>
    <p num="3">
      However, the photolithographic method using a pigment-dispersed photosensitive composition having a variety of advantages is still required to have further improved performances for stably producing highly accurate and fine color filters.
      <br/>
      That is, a highly accurate and fine pixel is liable to peel off a substrate in a development step when a colored pixel of a color filter is formed by applying a pigment-dispersed photosensitive composition to the substrate, exposing the coating and developing it, and the color filter is thus liable to have a deficiency.
      <br/>
      On the other hand, when an attempt is made to improve the adhesion of a highly accurate and fine pixel to a substrate, the solubility of a non-pixel portion which should be dissolved away in a developer solution tends to decrease, and a so-called surface soiling and resin-remaining are liable to occur.
      <br/>
      In this case, it is general practice to apply a physical stimulus by rubbing the coating with a soft substance such as sponge or the like for removing the surface soiling and remaining resin.
      <br/>
      However, this practice is undesirable, since it involves toughening and occurrence of dust on the color filter surface, which ends up in a decrease in the yields of color filters.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      When a color filter is produced from a radiation-sensitive composition, it is conventionally produced as follows.
      <br/>
      A light shielding layer in a desired pattern is formed on a glass substrate on which an SiO2 film or the like has been formed to prevent the elution of sodium ion.
      <br/>
      A radiation-sensitive composition is spin-coated on the light shielding layer to form a coating, and the coating is heated (prebaked) and dried.
      <br/>
      The so-prepared dried coating (to be sometimes referred to as "dry coating" hereinafter) is exposed and developed to form a pixel of each color.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      In the so-obtained dry coating formed on the substrate, the thickness of its central portion and the thickness of its marginal portion sometimes differs by 0.2  MU m or more, and striation (streaks) sometimes occurs.
      <br/>
      It is therefore difficult to produce a dry coating having a uniform thickness.
      <br/>
      Further, an unevenness having a depth of approximately 300 to 500 Angstrom  is sometimes formed on the dry coating surface, and the dry coating surface is inferior in surface smoothness.
      <br/>
      When the surface of the coating formed by spin coating has a nonuniform thickness or fine evenness, a color filter obtained by developing the dry coating has inferior transparency.
    </p>
    <p num="6">For this reason, in forming a color filter on a substrate surface, it is therefore desired to develop a radiation-sensitive composition for a color fitter, which is capable of forming a dry coating having a uniform thickness and having an excellently smooth surface.</p>
    <p num="7">
      When a conventional color filter is produced from a radiation-sensitive composition, a coating of the composition is developed with an alkaline aqueous solution.
      <br/>
      In this case, an undissolved substance from the radiation-sensitive composition sometimes remains on a non-pixel portion of the substrate.
      <br/>
      When an undissolved substance from the radiation-sensitive composition remains on the non-pixel portion of the substrate, the color filter shows a decline in transmittance or a decrease in contrast.
      <br/>
      When a color filter is produced, generally, pixels of three colors are consecutively produced by consecutively forming coatings of radiation-sensitive compositions each of which has a hue of red, blue or green.
      <br/>
      However, when an undissolved substance of the radiation-sensitive composition for forming a pixel of one of the colors remains on the substrate, a pixel of other color subsequently formed on the substrate where the undissolved substance remains is inferior in adhesion to the substrate and hence, it may peel off.
      <br/>
      The so-remaining undissolved radiation-sensitive composition on a non-pixel portion of the substrate surface is one of the reasons for decreasing the yields of color filters.
    </p>
    <p num="8">It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a novel pigment-dispersed color-filter composition.</p>
    <p num="9">It is another object of the present invention to provide a novel pigment-dispersed color-filter composition which gives pixels having excellent adhesion to a substrate and is free of surface soiling and a remaining composition in development.</p>
    <p num="10">It is further another object of the present invention to provide a pigment-dispersed color-filter composition which gives a color filter having little difference in thickness between its central portion and its marginal portion and having excellent surface smoothness.</p>
    <p num="11">Further, it is another object of the present invention to provide to a pigment-dispersed color-filter composition which is capable of uniformly forming pixels having excellent adhesion to a substrate without leaving an undissolved substance of the composition on a non-pixel portion when a color filter is produced.</p>
    <p num="12">It is still further another object of the present invention to provide a novel pigment-dispersed color-filter composition useful for producing a color filter for a liquid crystal display and a charge coupled device.</p>
    <p num="13">Other objects and advantages of the present invention will be apparent from the following description.</p>
    <p num="14">According to the present invention, the above objects and advantages of the present invention will be achieved, first, by a novel pigment-dispersed color-filter composition (to be referred to as "first composition" hereinafter) comprising:</p>
    <p num="15">
      (A) an alkali-soluble block copolymer composed of a block having an acid group and a block having no acid group,
      <br/>
      (B) a radiation-sensitive compound, and
      <br/>
      (C) a pigment.
    </p>
    <p num="16">In the first composition of the present invention, an alkali-soluble block copolymer (A) composed of a block having an acid group and a block having no acid group is used as a binder.</p>
    <p num="17">The block having an acid group is composed of a homopolymer formed from at least one monomer having an acid group such as an ethylenically unsaturated carboxylic acid and ethylenically unsaturated sulfonic acid, a copolymer of these or a copolymer formed from the above monomer having an acid group and a monomer having no acid group and being copolymerizable with the above monomer.</p>
    <p num="18">In view of ease in controlling the polymerization degree, preferred as the block having an acid group is a homopolymer of an ethylenically unsaturated carboxylic acid or a copolymer formed from an ethylenically unsaturated carboxylic acid and a monomer having no acid group and being copolymerizable therewith.</p>
    <p num="19">The ethylenically unsaturated carboxylic acid preferably includes acrylic acid, methacrylic acid, crotonic acid, iraconic acid, maleic acid, fumaric acid, monomethyl maleate and monomethyl fumarate.</p>
    <p num="20">The ethylenically unsaturated sulfonic acid includes isoprenesulfonic acid and styrenesulfonic acid.</p>
    <p num="21">The monomer having no acid group and being copolymerizable with the above monomer includes aromatic vinyl compounds such as styrene,  ALPHA -methylstyrene and vinyltoluene; ethylenically unsaturated carboxylic acid esters such as methyl (meth)acrylate, ethyl (meth)acrylate, butyl (meth)acrylate, 2-hydroxyethyl (meth)acrylate and benzyl (meth)acrylate; carboxylic acid vinyl esters such as vinyl acetate and vinyl propionate; vinyl cyanides such as (meth)acrylonitrile and  ALPHA -chloroacrylonitrile; and aliphatic conjugated dienes such as 1,3-butadiene and isoprene.</p>
    <p num="22">The block having no acid group is formed of a polymer or copolymer composed from one of, or a plurality of, the above monomers such as aromatic vinyl compounds, ethylenically unsaturated alkyl carboxylic acid esters, vinyl carboxylic acid esters, vinyl cyanides and aliphatic conjugated dienes; ethylenically unsaturated carboxylic acid aminoalkyl esters such as aminoethyl acrylate; unsaturated aliphatic glycidyl esters such as glycidyl (meth)acrylate; macromonomers having a terminal (meth)acryloyl group such as polystyrene having a terminal (meth)acryloyl group; polymethyl (meth)acrylate having a terminal (meth)acryloyl group, polybutyl (meth)acrylate having a terminal (meth)acryloyl group and polysilicone having a terminal (meth)acryloyl group.</p>
    <p num="23">Of polymers or copolymers formed from the above monomers, preferred is a copolymer formed from a macromonomer containing polystyrene, polymethyl (meth)acrylate, polybutyl (meth)acrylate or polysilicone.</p>
    <p num="24">The block copolymer can be produced by one of well known polymerization methods such as a living polymerization method, a method in which different blocks are bonded by a functional group reaction and a method using the macromonomer �"Kobunshi Gosei" (Polymer Synthesis), Essence of Polymer and Topics 2, Chapter 12, Junji Furukawa, published by Kagaku Dojin, 1986�. When the macromonomer is used, advantageously, the intended block copolymer can be obtained by a simple radical polymerization method.</p>
    <p num="25">
      When the block copolymer is produced, the amount of the monomer having an acid group is preferably 15 to 50% by weight based on the total amount of the monomers.
      <br/>
      When this amount is less than 15% by weight, the solubility of the block copolymer in an alkali developer solution is insufficient, and a surface soiling and a resin-remaining are liable to occur on a non-pixel portion.
      <br/>
      When it exceeds 50% by weight, the solubility of the block copolymer in an alkali developer solution is too high, and pixels are liable to peel off a substrate.
      <br/>
      The amount of the monomer having an acid group is particularly preferably 20 to 40% by weight.
    </p>
    <p num="26">Concerning the molecular weight of the block copolymer, the weight average molecular weight of the block copolymer as a polystyrene measured by gel permeation chromatography (to be abbreviated as GPC hereinafter) using tetrahydrofuran (THF) as a carrier is preferably 10,000 to 500,000, particularly preferably 20,000 to 300,000.</p>
    <p num="27">
      When the above molecular weight of the block copolymer exceeds 500,000, a scumming is liable to occur around developed pixels, a pattern edge is liable to show insufficient sharpness, and a surface soiling and resin-remaining are liable to occur on a non-pixel portion.
      <br/>
      When the molecular weight of the block copolymer is less than 10,000, the solubility of the block copolymer in an alkali developer solution is too high under optimum development condition, and the time span for the development is small (for example about 20 to 40 seconds), and the so-called development time margin is liable to decrease.
    </p>
    <p num="28">The radiation-sensitive compound (B) can be selected, for example, from (1) a compound whose molecule is decomposed under irradiation with radiation to free an active compound, generate a chain reaction of unsaturated double bonds and form a three-dimensionally crosslinked compound and (2) a compound whose molecule is decomposed under irradiation with radiation to bond to a C--C bond or a C--H bond by an insertion reaction and form a three-dimensionally crosslinked structure.</p>
    <p num="29">The above (1) compound is selected from those compounds which generate radicals, carbene or nitrene, i.e., a photopolymerization initiator and a compound which has polyvalent unsaturated double bonds and is polymerized under irradiation with radiation, i.e., a photopolymerizable monomer and oligomer.</p>
    <p num="30">Examples of the photopolymerization initiator include a carbonium compound, an azo or azide compound, an organic sulfur compound, peroxide and a trihalomethane compound.</p>
    <p num="31">Specific examples of the carbonium compound include diacetyl, benzyl, benzoin, 2-hydroxy-2-methyl-1-phenylpropan-1-one, 1-(4-isopropylphenyl)-2-hydroxy-2-methylpropan-1-one, 4-(2-hydroxyethoxy)phenyl-2-(hydroxy-2-propyl)ketone, 1-hydroxycyclohexylketone, 2,2-dimethoxy-2-phenylacetophenone, 2-methyl�4-(methylthio)phenyl�-2-morpholino-1-propan-1-one, 2-benzyl-2-dimethylamino-1-(4-morpholinophenyl)-butan-1-one, benzophenone, 4,4'-bis(dimethylamino)benzophenone, 4,4'-bis(diethylamino)benzophenone, 2,4-diethylthioxanthone and 3,3-dimethyl-4-methoxybenzophenone.</p>
    <p num="32">Specific examples of the azo or azide compound include azoisobutyronitrile, diazonium, 4-azidobenzaldehyde, 4-azidoacetophenone, 4-azidobenzalacetophenone, 4-azidobenzalacetone, azidopyrene, 4-diazodiphenylamine, 4-diazo-4'-methoxydiphenylamine and 4-diazo-3'-methoxydiphenylamine.</p>
    <p num="33">Specific examples of the organic sulfur compound include mercaptan disulfide.</p>
    <p num="34">Specific examples of the peroxide include diethyl ether peroxide.</p>
    <p num="35">Specific examples of the trihalomethane include 1,3-bis(trichloromethyl)-5-(2'-chlorophenyl)-s-triazine and 1,3-bis(trichloromethyl)-5-(4'-methoxyphenyl)-s-triazine.</p>
    <p num="36">Examples of the photopolymerizable monomer or oligomer include polyacryloyl compounds such as trimethylolpropane triacrylate, pentaerythritol triacrylate, trisacryloyloxyethyl phosphate, pentaerythritol tetraacrylate, dipentaerythritol pentaacrylate and dipentaerythritol hexaacrylate; a condensate of 4-azidobenzaldehyde and polyvinyl alcohol, a condensate of 4-azidobenzaldehyde and a phenol novolak resin, and a polymer or copolymer of 4-acryloylphenylcinnamoyl ester.</p>
    <p num="37">The above (2) compound is selected from those compounds having at least two functional groups which generate carbene or nitrene under irradiation with radiation, i.e., photo-crosslinking agents.</p>
    <p num="38">Examples of the photo-crosslinking agents include diazidochalcone, 2,6-bis(4'-azidobenzal)cyclohexanone, 2,6-bis(4'-azidobenzal)-4-methylcyclohexanone, 1,3-bis(4'-azidobenzal)-2-propane, 1,3-bis(4'-azidocinnamylidene)-2-propanone, 4,4'-diazidostilbene and ammonium bichromate.</p>
    <p num="39">Of the above radiation-sensitive compounds, it is preferred to use a compound which generates radicals under irradiation with radiation as a photopolymerization initiator and a polyacryloyl compound as a photopolymerizable monomer or oligomer.</p>
    <p num="40">
      For example, 2-methyl�4-(methylthio)phenyl�-2-morpholino-1-propan-1-one or 2-benzyl-2-dimethylamino-1-(4-morpholinophenyl)-butan-1-one is used as a photopolymerization initiator, and pentaerythritol triacrylate or dipentaerythritol hexaacrylate is used as a photopolymerizable monomer or oligomer.
      <br/>
      In this case, the amount of the photopolymerization initiator per 100 parts by weight of the photopolymerizable monomer or oligomer is 0.01 to 200 parts by weight, preferably 1 to 120 parts by weight.
    </p>
    <p num="41">
      The radiation-sensitive compound may be used in any amount as far as the first composition can form a coating having an adhesion under irradiation with radiation, and yet the amount of the radiation-sensitive compound per 100 parts by weight of the alkali-soluble block copolymer (A) is preferably 5 to 500 parts by weight, more preferably 20 to 200 parts by weight.
      <br/>
      When this amount is less than 5 parts by weight, the clearness of pixels is liable to be insufficient.
      <br/>
      When it exceeds 500 parts by weight, a resin is liable to remain on a non-pixel portion.
    </p>
    <p num="42">The pigment (C) is selected from both organic pigments and inorganic pigments.</p>
    <p num="43">
      As organic pigments, preferred are dyes and pigments which are insoluble in water or an organic solvent.
      <br/>
      Specific examples of the organic pigments are described in chapter "Pigment" under "Color Index" (published by The Society of Dyers and Colourists).

      When the liquid medium (D) contains more than 50% by weight of a solvent whose boiling point is higher than 200 (degree)  C., the liquid medium (D) is not sufficiently evaporated in prebaking a coating and remains in the dry coating.
      <br/>
      As a result, the dry coating surface may have the property of adhesion and cause sticking, and the heat resistance of the dry coating may decrease.
      <br/>
      Further, when a large amount of the liquid medium (D) remains in the dry coating, the dry coating may peel off a glass substrate, particularly a glass substrate having an SiO2 film on the surface, during the development.
