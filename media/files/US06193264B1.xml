      A collapsible golf trolley has a collapsible frame device and a bag disposed on the collapsible frame device.
      <br/>
      The collapsible frame device has an outer pipe, an inner pipe inserted in the outer pipe, a lower joint disposed on a middle portion of the outer pipe, two support frames connected to the lower joint, each support frame connected to a wheel connector, the wheel connector connected to a wheel, and two pull rods.
      <br/>
      Each pull rod is connected to a slide block of the outer pipe and the respective support frame.
      <br/>
      A rope is connected to the support frames.
      <br/>
      A releasing device is disposed on the outer pipe.

    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="1">
      The present invention relates to a collapsible golf trolley.
      <br/>
      More particularly, the present invention relates to a collapsible frame device of a golf trolley.
    </p>
    <p num="2">
      Referring to FIGS. 1 and 2, a conventional collapsible golf trolley has an upper frame 11, a lower frame 12, and a generally U-shaped upper joint 18 connected to a lower end of the upper frame 11 and an upper portion of the lower frame 12.
      <br/>
      A shaft 111 is disposed on an upper end of the lower frame 12.
      <br/>
      A positioning fastener A is disposed on a lower portion of the upper frame 11.
      <br/>
      An upper bracket 132 is disposed on the upper portion of the lower frame 12.
      <br/>
      A lower seat 131 is disposed on a lower end of the lower frame 12.
      <br/>
      A handle 19 is disposed on an upper end of the upper frame 11.
      <br/>
      A lower joint 14 is disposed on a middle portion of the lower frame 12.
      <br/>
      Two support frames 15 are connected to the lower joint 14.
      <br/>
      Each support frame 38 is connected to a wheel connector 10 which is connected to a wheel 16.
      <br/>
      Two pull rods 17 are connected to the upper frame 11 and the respective support frames 15.
      <br/>
      When the upper frame 11 is rotated downward, it is necessary to provide a large room.
      <br/>
      When the upper frame 11 is extended, the positioning fastener A engages with the shaft 111 in order to position the upper frame 11 stably.
      <br/>
      However, the upper frame 11 cannot be positioned stably while the upper frame 11 is folded.
    </p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="3">An object of the present invention is to provide a collapsible golf trolley which is easily folded.</p>
    <p num="4">Another object of the present invention is to provide a collapsible golf trolley which is easily operated.</p>
    <p num="5">
      In accordance with a first preferred embodiment of the present invention, a collapsible golf trolley comprises a collapsible frame device and a bag disposed on the collapsible frame device.
      <br/>
      The bag has an upper cap, two protective pads, and two belts.
      <br/>
