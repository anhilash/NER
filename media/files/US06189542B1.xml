    <heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="1">This invention is directed to hair accessories and, in particular, to a hair clip having storage capabilities.</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">
      Hair accessories of many types have been developed to help women maintain a variety of hairstyles.
      <br/>
      Some hair accessories, like bobby pins, are almost purely functional.
      <br/>
      Other such accessories, including ornate combs and barrettes, can be as decorative as they are functional.
    </p>
    <p num="3">
      Still other hair accessories are designed accomplish a single task in operation.
      <br/>
      Elastic bands enclosed in fabric, so-called "scrunchies," are one simple device often used for holding hair in a ponytail-type arrangement.
      <br/>
      Another relatively-simple hair accessory is known simply as a "hair clip." Hair clips typically involve spring biased elements that cooperatively hold hair in a desired position.
      <br/>
      This type of device is disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,873,377 and 5,862,815.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      Some hair accessories have been designed not only to hold hair, but to perform secondary functions, as well.
      <br/>
      For example, U.S. Pat. No. 5,533,533 discloses a foldable hair clip that includes a comb to allow hairstyle retouching during use. U.S. Des. Pat. No. 378,817 discloses a hair clip adapted to hold a scarf in a decorative manner.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      While each of the known hair accessories may address a particular set of needs, there is still room for improvement.
      <br/>
      For example, many individuals who wear hair accessories are active women who wish to keep their hair tidy while engaged in various activities.
      <br/>
      A hair accessory that would not only keep hair in place, but that would also provide a way of carrying cosmetics or other relatively-small items would prove beneficial.
      <br/>
      Such a device would be especially useful for women engaged in sports, workouts, attending social, sporting events, or other times when carrying a purse might prove cumbersome such as a trip to the beach.
      <br/>
      The known hair accessories do not address this need, nor do they provide this type of enhanced functionality.
      <br/>
      This type of device would represent a step forward in this field and would allow an individual to carry a variety of items, while largely eliminating the need to carry such items in a purse.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      Thus, what is needed is a hair accessory that includes advantages of the known devices, while addressing the shortcomings they exhibit.
      <br/>
      The hair accessory should keep hair tidy while providing a way of carrying cosmetics or other relatively-small items.
      <br/>
      The device may also include an alarm mechanism to provide notification of unwanted attempts to remove the device.
      <br/>
      The device should be modular in design to accommodate several interchangeable components as desired.
      <br/>
      The accessory should also provide enhanced storage capacity in a manner that is attractive and in a format that is easy to use.
    </p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="7">
      The instant invention is a multipurpose hair clip accessory capable of storing cosmetics and other small items, while keeping hair in a preset position and largely eliminating the need to carry a purse.
      <br/>
      The hair clip includes a pair of pivotally-connected main members that are spring biased to cooperatively adopt a hair-holding orientation.
      <br/>
      Each of the main members is essentially "S" shaped and includes a first end spaced apart from a second end by a middle portion.
      <br/>
      The first end of each main member includes an articulation tab that facilitates selective movement of the main members from a hair engaging orientation to a hair releasing orientation.
      <br/>
      An alarm assembly associated with the articulation tabs will signal movement of the main members into the hair releasing orientation, thereby indicating attempted theft of the device.
      <br/>
      Removably attached storage sleeves accommodate a variety of interchangeable accessory tubes.
      <br/>
      The storage sleeves may also be used without accessory tubes and may be capped to hold loose items.
      <br/>
      A cosmetics case and a mirror are removably secured to the main member first ends.
    </p>
    <p num="8">Thus it is an objective of the instant invention to provide a multipurpose hair accessory that keeps hair tidy while providing a way of carrying cosmetics such as lipstick, lip gloss, chap stick, lip liner, perfume, mascara, sun screen, nail polish, mouth spray (BINACA), mouthwash, or other relatively-small items such as paper money, make-up brushes, hair pins, safety pins, writing pens, and the like.</p>
    <p num="9">An additional objective of the instant invention is to provide a hair accessory that includes an alarm mechanism to provide notification of unwanted attempts to remove the device.</p>
    <p num="10">
      Yet another objective of the instant invention is to provide a hair accessory that is modular in design to accommodate several interchangeable components as desired.
      <br/>
      The handles may include detachable mirrors wherein the mirrors may couple together to form an enlarged viewing surface.
    </p>
    <p num="11">Still a further objective of the instant invention is to provide a hair accessory that provides enhanced storage capacity in a manner that is attractive and in a format that is easy to use.</p>
    <p num="12">
      Other objects and advantages of this invention will become apparent from the following description taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings wherein are set forth, by way of illustration and example, certain embodiments of this invention.

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading>
    <p num="14">
      It is to be understood that while a certain form of the invention is illustrated, it is not to be limited to the specific form or arrangement of parts herein described and shown.
      <br/>
      It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that various changes may be made without departing from the scope of the invention and the invention is not to be considered limited to what is shown in the drawings and described in the specification.
    </p>
    <p num="15">
      Now with reference to FIG. 1, the hair clip 10 of the present invention is shown.
      <br/>
      By way of overview, the hair clip 10 of the present invention includes a pair of pivotally-connected main members 12,14 that are biased by a spring assembly 16 into a hair engaging orientation.
      <br/>
      Each of the main members is contoured and includes a first end 18,20 spaced apart from a second end 22,24 by a middle portion 26,28.
      <br/>
      As will be described more fully below, the first main member first end 18 provides a mounting location for a mirror 30, and the second main member first end 20 provides a mounting location for a cosmetics case 32, such as a foldable compact.
      <br/>
      The middle portion 26,28 of each main member 12,14 provides a mounting location for a corresponding storage sleeve 34,36, also described more fully below.
      <br/>
      Interchangeable accessory tubes 38,40,42,44, seen with additional reference to FIGS. 3A, 3B, and 3C, may be selectively secured within the storage sleeves 36,36, as desired.
      <br/>
      The hair clip 10 of the present invention also includes an alarm assembly that will indicate unwanted attempts to remove the device.
      <br/>
      The invention will now be described in detail.
    </p>
    <p num="16">
      As seen with combined reference to FIGS. 1, 2A, 2B, and 2C, each main member 12,14 of the present invention 10 has an essentially S-shaped cross section.
      <br/>
      As mentioned above, each main member 12,14 is characterized by first end 18,20 spaced apart by a second end 22,24 by a middle portion 26,28.
      <br/>
      The main members 12,14 are pivotally connected via a hinge construction 48 that extends between the main member middle portions 26,28.
      <br/>
      A spring assembly 16 associated with the hinge construction 48 includes leverage fingers 50,52 that engage the main member first ends 18,20 to urge the main members 12,14 into a hair engaging orientation.
      <br/>
      The second end 22,24 of each main member 12,14 includes a row of teeth 54 which cooperate to releasably engage a selected portion of an individual's hair, not shown, thereby keeping the hair tidy and the clip 10 removably secured in place.
      <br/>
      The clip 10 may be removed by squeezing the main member first ends 18,20 towards one-another to temporarily overcome the spring constant of the spring assembly 16, thereby forcing the second ends 22,24 apart and placing the clip 10 in a hair releasing orientation.
    </p>
    <p num="17">
      The first ends 18,20 not only serve as articulation tabs that aid in opening and closing the present clip 10, the first ends also serve as mounting locations for a mirror 30 and a cosmetics case 32, respectively.
      <br/>
      More particularly, and with additional reference to FIG. 4, the first end 18 of the first main member 12 includes a contoured channel 56 sized and shaped to engage the leading edge 58 of a mirror removably inserted therein.
      <br/>
      The first end 20 of the second main member 14 includes a pair of post apertures 60 sized and shaped to releasably engage corresponding case mounting posts 62 that extend from the exterior of the included cosmetics case 32, thereby securing the case 32 to the second main member 14.
      <br/>
      It is noted that the relative position of the posts 62 and apertures 60 may be reversed without adverse affect.
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      With continued reference to FIGS. 1 and 4, the storage sleeves 34,36 will now be described.
      <br/>
      Each storage sleeve 34,36 resembles a hollow tube having a circular cross section.
      <br/>
      Each sleeve has an open end 64,66, shown in FIGS. 2A, 2B and 2C, that allows an accessory tube 38,40,42,44 to be placed therein.
      <br/>
      The accessory tubes 38,40,42,44 are interchangeable and each tube includes a different type of product.
      <br/>
      FIG. 1 shows a lipstick accessory tube 38; FIG. 3A shows a nail polish accessory tube 40; FIG. 3B shows a perfume accessory tube 42; and FIG. 3C shows a mascara accessory tube 44.
      <br/>
      It is noted that the accessory tubes may contain other items as desired such as lipstick, lip gloss, chap stick, lip liner, sun screen, mouth spray (BINACA), mouthwash, or other relatively-small items such as paper money, make-up brushes, hair pins, safety pins, writing pens, and the like.
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      In keeping with the objectives of the present invention, the storage sleeves 34,36 need not be used with accessory tubes, at all.
      <br/>
      The storage sleeves 34,36 may be used to store loose items, such as change or rolled-up bills, not shown.
      <br/>
      For use without an accessory tube, the storage sleeves 34,36 may simply be closed via a removable end cap 68 sized and shaped to selectively seal the sleeve open ends 64,66, as shown in FIG. 4.
    </p>
    <p num="20">
      It is also noted that while the storage sleeves 34,36 may be made from a variety of materials, a preferred material is plastic.
      <br/>
      If the storage sleeves 34,36 are translucent or transparent, a chemiluminescent light source, not shown, may be placed therein to provide a decorative glow of light.
    </p>
    <p num="21">
      Although the storage sleeves 34,36 may be permanently attached to the main members 12,14, the storage sleeves are preferably detachable.
      <br/>
      To this end, several methods of releasable attachment arrangements may be used, as exemplified in FIGS. 2A, 2B, and 2C.
      <br/>
      Referring to FIG. 2A, the storage sleeves 34,36 may be attached to corresponding main member middle portions 26,28 via a post-and-aperture arrangement More specifically, sleeve mounting posts 70,72 extend orthogonally from each sleeve 34,36 and each main member first end 18,20 includes mounting post apertures 74,76 disposed therein.
      <br/>
      Each of the sleeve mounting posts 70,72 is sized and positioned to frictionally engage a corresponding mounting post aperture 74,76.
      <br/>
      With this arrangement, the storage sleeves 34,36 may each be releasably attached to a corresponding main member 12,14.
      <br/>
      The number of posts 70,72 and apertures 74,76 is dependent upon the length of the sleeves 34,36.
      <br/>
      In a preferred embodiment, each sleeve 34,36 employs two posts 70,72.
      <br/>
      It is also noted that the relative position of the posts 70,72 and apertures 74,76 may be reversed if desired.
    </p>
    <p num="22">
      Now with respect to FIG. 2B, the storage sleeves 34,36 are shown to be releasably attached to corresponding main member 12,14 via hook-and-loop type fastening material 78,80, such as that available under the trademark VELCRO.
      <br/>
      More particularly, first portions 78 of hook-and-loop fastening material are disposed on the storage sleeves 34,36, and corresponding second portions 80 of hook-and-loop fastening material are disposed on the main member middle portions 26,28.
      <br/>
      With this arrangement, the storage sleeves 34,36 may be releasably attached to the main members 12,14 by pressing the corresponding portions 78,80 of fastening material together.
    </p>
    <p num="23">
      With respect to FIG. 2C, the storage sleeves 34,36 may be releasably attached to the main members via a magnet-and-plate arrangement.
      <br/>
      In this embodiment, magnets 82 are affixed to the storage sleeves 34,36 and corresponding magnet-attractive plates 84 are affixed to the main member middle portions 26,28.
      <br/>
      With this arrangement the storage sleeves 34,36 may be releasably attached to the main members 12,14 by placing the magnets 82 against the magnet-attractive plates 84.
      <br/>
      It is noted that the position of the plates 84 and magnets 82 may be reversed if desired.
      <br/>
      The plates 84' may alternatively be formed from resiliently-deformable plastic and shaped with a C-shaped cross section.
      <br/>
      In this manner, the plates 84' will act as clips to hold a variety of cylindrical items placed therein, including the sleeves 34,36, as shown in FIG. 5.
    </p>
    <p num="24">
      In keeping with the objectives of the present invention, the present hair clip 10 includes an alarm assembly 46 that indicates unwanted attempts to remove the device.
      <br/>
      In a preferred embodiment, the alarm assembly 46 includes a pair of electrical contacts 86,88 that, when brought together, cause an included battery-operated speaker 90 to emit an audible tone.
      <br/>
      As seen in FIG. 5, the contacts 86,88 are positioned to touch as the main member first ends 18,20 are brought together to release the clip 10.
    </p>
    <p num="25">
      Although the invention has been described in terms of a specific embodiment, it will be readily apparent to those skilled in this art that various modifications, rearrangements and substitutions can be made without departing from the spirit of the invention.
