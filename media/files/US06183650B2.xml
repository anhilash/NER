    <heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">
      This invention relates to synthetic mineral microparticles, specifically metallic microparticles.
      <br/>
      This invention additionally relates to the production of such synthetic mineral microparticles, particularly to precipitation production of such microparticles by mixing metal salts and materials having precursor compounds.
    </p>
    <p num="3">This invention further relates to the use of both the synthetic mineral microparticles in water treating systems and the method of using such synthetic mineral microparticles in retention aid systems in paper-making systems.</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="4">
      Traditional paper-making systems include the provision of a water-based slurry, termed a "paper furnish", containing wood fibers, fines, and other ingredients to a moving web on a paper machine to facilitate the formation of a paper matrix, which is drained, dried and pressed into a final paper sheet product.
      <br/>
      A desire in such a process is to drain the excess water in an efficient manner to form a heterogeneous matrix without also unnecessarily removing desired fibers, fines and other solids.
      <br/>
      Retained undesired water burdens the downstream processes, such as, for example, a wet sheet in the dryer section.
      <br/>
      However, removal of desired solids endangers acceptability of the final paper sheet.
      <br/>
      Also, the act of draining water can adversely affect sheet formation.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      Retention aid systems have been developed to increase retention of desired fibers, fines and solids, to improve paper sheet formation, and to drain better the paper matrix in the paper sheet forming section of paper machines.
      <br/>
      Such systems benefit, in part, the papermaker by allowing the paper machine to run more cleanly while producing a better sheet at higher machine speeds.
      <br/>
      Among the retention aid systems are those which utilize natural and synthetic microparticle systems.
      <br/>
      Certain of these retention aids include colloidal aluminum hydroxide, colloidal magnesium silicate, bentonite, colloidal silica, and organic polymer based systems.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      Depending upon cost, quality, customer requirements and other considerations, the papermaker may employ a number of differing strategies of retention aid use.
      <br/>
      One typical strategy is to add an agglomerating agent to a thin stock precursor to the paper furnish.
      <br/>
      Such agent acts to agglomerate or flocculate the fibers, fines and solids.
      <br/>
      Typical agents are starch and/or polymers.
      <br/>
      However, such systems often subsequently subject the agglomerated material to a shearing force in screening equipment to produce smaller agglomerates with an intended purpose to obtain better sheet formation.
      <br/>
      A retention aid to help retain the fiber, fines and other desired solids can be added to the system before the furnish is passed through the paper machine head box to begin the paper matrix formation on the paper machine web.
      <br/>
      This retention aid causes a second agglomeration differing from the previous agglomeration.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      Such aids have varying degrees of effectiveness due to the numerous variables in the paper-making process.
      <br/>
      One strategy is to formulate in a remote production facility various aids having a variety of relative percentages of the components.
      <br/>
      These differing percentages in the retention aid's composition are intended to match the requirements of the furnish for overall system performance.
      <br/>
      Such strategy often makes performance a result of art and happenstance rather than of engineered control.
      <br/>
      What are needed are better drainage aids and retention aids and methods of using such aids in the paper-making process.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      Further, a system of agglomerating particles is sometimes useful in the treatment of water in trapping or otherwise removing undesired particles and oils or other globules from water.
      <br/>
      While many systems for water treatment exist based upon agglomeration principles, new and useful agglomerants are still desirable.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide synthetic mineral microparticles, specifically metallic microparticles, which are new to the paper-making art and which provide equal or enhanced performance compared to present retention and drainage aids.
      <br/>
      It is a further object to provide a method for the production of such synthetic mineral microparticles.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      Another object is to use the synthetic mineral microparticles in a novel method of production in paper-making systems by providing such particles as drainage and retention aids.
      <br/>
      In another aspect of the present invention, it is an object to provide a system of agglomeration useful in water treatment.

    <p num="11">
      International Publication No. WO 92/20862 discloses a process for improving the production of paper and paper products by adding a cationic polymer and an amorphous metal silicate separately to the papermaking furnish with sufficient mixing between additions.
      <br/>
      The order of addition of these components is not critical, however, the preferred order of addition is to add the polymer prior to the last high shear point.
      <br/>
      Subsequently the amorphous metal silicate is added before feeding the resultant mixture to the headbox of a paper making machine without subjecting the mixture to any further substantial shear.
      <br/>
      Products produced according to the process of this invention are useful for increasing retention, drainage, and formation in the production of paper from pulp slurries.

    <p num="26">
      Preferably the metal salt and the component selected from silicates, phosphates and borates are reacted to form the reaction product of step (1) before exposure to the paper furnish or polymer in steps (2), but need not be.
      <br/>
      For example, the metal salt and silicate, phosphate, and/or borate components or the reaction product thereof could be admixed simultaneously with either the furnish and/or the polymer.
      <br/>
      This admixing the metal salt; silicate, phosphate and/or borate component; reaction product; paper furnish; and polymer can be performed in a variety of sequences at one of several addition points for a paper machine or in process lines entering a paper machine to produce the modified paper furnish.
      <br/>
      For instance, the admixing of either the paper furnish or the polymer may be done with the reaction product before the addition of the other.
      <br/>
      The invention likewise includes an optional step of recycle of a portion of the paper machine product to the process.
      <br/>
      Such recycled material can be the source of one of the above components in the various steps.
      <br/>
      As a further example of the variation in the sequence of the steps or parts thereof, in one embodiment, the polymer and the paper furnish in step (2) are pre-mixed together before the addition of the reaction product of step (1).
      <br/>
      In another embodiment, the reaction product of step (1) and the paper furnish in step (2) are pre-mixed before the addition of the polymer.

      <br/>
      For example, a homopolymer, copolymer or terpolymer; but not limited to only three differing types of structurally repeating units.
      <br/>
      Variation in the polymer can occur so that a distribution of polymer molecules may be present within the "polymer".
      <br/>
      The polymer may be initially supplied in a variety of forms, such as powder, granules, aqueous solutions, gels, and emulsions.
      <br/>
      Preferred among the nonionic polymers are poly(acrylamide) and poly(ethylene oxide).
      <br/>
      Preferred among the anionic polymers are carboxyl group containing polymers and sulfonic acid group containing polymers.
      <br/>
      Preferred among the cationic polymers dialkylamino alkyl acrylic and methacrylic ester polymers, N-(dialkylamino alkyl) acrylamide polymers, carbamoyl polymers, poly(diallyldimethylammonium chloride) polymers, poly(hydroxyalkylene polyamines) polymer, poly (ethyleneimine) polymers, and cyanamide derivative polymers.

      In another embodiment, the present invention is a method for treating water comprising the steps of
      <br/>
      (1) admixing a first amount of a soluble metal salt and a second amount of one or more components selected from silicates, phosphates and borates, to form a reaction product; and
      <br/>
      (2) admixing the reaction product and water comprising a polymer to produce water comprising floccule.
    </p>
    <p num="33">
      The following optional steps may be performed:
      <br/>
      (3) providing the sedimentation of the floccule in the water to produce clarified water; and/or
      <br/>
      (4) filtering the water comprising floccule to remove effectively remove the floccule.
    </p>
    <p num="34">
      The formed floccule act to treat the water by electrostatically binding or by physically entraining undesired materials such as solids or oils or suspensions which are desired for removal.
      <br/>
      Removal is then effected by sedimentation or filtration of the floccules.
      <br/>
      The steps may be performed sequentially or simultaneously in any combination of order.
      <br/>
      For example, in one instance effluent process water, such as from a paper mill, is treated to remove suspended fibers or other solids before discharge into the environment.
      <br/>
      The components are added to result in a floccule formation, which entraps the suspended fibers or solids in a clarifying operation.
      <br/>
      Although this example deals with a paper mill effluent process water; the invention is applicable to incoming mill water to remove naturally present solids or to process any water stream where clarification is desired.

      A 10,000 gallon reservoir of water with solids in suspension is dosed with 0.1 to 10 pounds of a polyacrylamide flocculant.
      <br/>
      Such dosing can be performed by mechanical mixing or injection of the flocculant with singular or multiple points of injections.
      <br/>
      Additional agitation could be performed.
      <br/>
      The zinc silicate product of Example 2 is then added to the reservoir at a dosage of 0.1 to 10 pounds.
      <br/>
      Additional or continuing means of mixing or dispersion can be performed.
      <br/>
      Flocculation of the solids in suspension occurs.
      <br/>
      The flocculated solids are allowed to settle and the solids in suspension with the water is reduced.
