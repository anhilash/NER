      This invention generally relates to brewing machines, and specifically to an improved apparatus and methods for brewing and dispensing single servings of hot or cold tea or coffee which is attractive, compact, simple to use, and easy to maintain.
      <br/>
      The invention will find particular use in convenience stores, restaurants, offices, or wherever it is desirous for a business to provide beverage-dispensing machines to consumers and where space, money, and time are precious commodities.
      <br/>
      The preferred machine is generally portable and can be readily used anywhere there is a supply of water and electricity.
    </p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">
      During the past several years, coffee and tea consumption has been increasing, as demonstrated by the rapidly increasing number of specialty coffeehouses and teashops around the nation.
      <br/>
      Among other things, studies have shown that tea has several substances that can benefit people's health.
      <br/>
      The surge in popularity has been particularly noteworthy in the convenience store market through the growth in sales and consumption of "ready-to-drink" beverages.
      <br/>
      Consumers shopping in convenience stores, like consumers in specialty shops, appreciate a high quality, flavorful product at a reasonable price.
      <br/>
      Thus, the invention described herein is directed to a brewing system that provides fresh, high quality, flavorful beverage products and affords numerous conveniences to consumers and owners.
    </p>
    <p num="3">
      Traditionally, coffee or tea machines, both for personal and business use, brew large quantities (e.g. pots) of coffee or tea that are designed to serve multiple individuals.
      <br/>
      Because these beverages are made in such large quantities and are usually maintained in a brewed, liquid state, their flavor and consistency degrade over time making the beverages less desirable or even undrinkable, and thus, the remaining pot of coffee or tea typically gets discarded.
      <br/>
      With the increasing prices of these commodities, the wasted coffee or tea results in significant amounts of wasted money.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      With these prior art machines, it is inconvenient or impossible to brew smaller, fresh individual servings of coffee or tea.
      <br/>
      Even if a prior art machine is designed to brew small batches (rather than multiple cups), the machines typically require the user to invest a significant amount of time and effort to clean the components of the machine from the previous pot of coffee or tea, to attempt to measure the proper amount of the coffee or tea to be brewed, and to wait for the entire brewing process to complete for a single serving.
      <br/>
      As indicated, typical prior art machines do not have components that are suitable for properly brewing smaller quantities of beverages.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      In addition, if the user wishes to flavor his drink with any suitable additive (such as cream, sugar, honey, syrup, fruit flavoring, etc.), he will have to keep a supply of the additive nearby and add it to the cup as he prepares his drink.
      <br/>
      This can present significant problems where space is not readily available, and it increases costs by requiring the maintenance, cleaning, and inventory of not only the additives but the various equipment needed to store and mix the additives.
      <br/>
      These problems directly affect the profitability for any retailer (especially retailers such as convenience stores) attempting to provide drinks for consumers.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      Some machines have attempted to overcome some of these shortcomings.
      <br/>
      For example, U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,211,342 (to Jamgochian et al.), and 4,649,809 (to Kanezashi), describe machines that are capable of preparing individual servings of various beverages including hot or cold coffee, tea, hot chocolate, and cold soda.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, these machines permit the consumer to choose from a variety of items to add to the beverage to alter the flavor of the drink.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      Unfortunately, these machines are relatively complicated, and typically require a substantial investment of money to purchase or lease, and maintain; thus making them impractical if not impossible for small businesses to use them.
      <br/>
      Moreover, these machines typically occupy a relatively large amount of space, making them inconvenient (and less profitable) for use in businesses such as convenience stores and restaurants where space is crucial.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      In addition, the mixing of the beverage additives in such prior art machines typically occurs at some stage prior to final dispense of the beverage.
      <br/>
      This increases the possibility of decreasing the quality of subsequent beverages from the machine (such as by flavor contamination by different and unwanted additives), and correspondingly makes cleaning of those areas more crucial and typically more difficult.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      Another prior art machine (U.S. Pat. No. 5,724,883 to Usherovich) teaches a smaller brewer that brews both hot or cold drinks.
      <br/>
      However, this machine, much like traditional brewers, suffers from various shortcomings, including the inability to properly and rapidly brew single-servings, and also suffers from the inability to be easily cleaned or maintained.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      To overcome the shortcomings of prior art brewing machines, the invention described herein preferably is a compact, easily used and maintained, brewing machine that freshly and quickly brews a single serving of tea or coffee.
      <br/>
      Each time a user or customer activates the preferred machine, the machine places tea leaves or coffee grounds in a brewing chamber, adds hot water, and brews the tea or coffee.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, the invention preferably permits the brewing of either hot or cold beverages as well as enables the user to select from a wide variety of flavors when choosing his single serving of coffee or tea.
      <br/>
      The preferred embodiment of the invention is also programmable to, among other things, assign unique flavor combinations, brewing times, water level, and other attributes to each beverage selection button.
      <br/>
      In addition, the invention preferably includes a display screen that displays messages, such as instructing a consumer on how to make his cup of tea or coffee, and instructing and assisting the machine's owner or operator to modify and program the operation and other aspects of the machine (such as by leading the owner through a series of menu choices).

      As described above, the preferred embodiment of the invention includes four additive storage bins 135 and two mixing assemblies 1300.
      <br/>
      For convenience, only one of the mixing assemblies 1300 will be described with the understanding that the other is preferably identical in composition and operation and only differs with respect to the specific additive storage bins from which it receives ingredients.
      <br/>
      Persons of ordinary skill in the art will further appreciate that mixing assemblies 1300 can also constitute part of an additive dispensing means to facilitate the dispense and outflow of additives into the container receiving the brewed beverage.
    </p>
    <p num="58">
      Mixing assembly 1300 preferably includes an ingredient receiving element or funnel 1310 to receive and direct a dispensed ingredient from storage bin 135.
      <br/>
      The ingredient is directed to a mixing bowl 1330 wherein the ingredient is mixed with an inflow of water from a water tank 300 (see FIGS. 4 and 6).
      <br/>
      The ingredient and water are actively blended in a mixing chamber 1370 where they subsequently descend into tubing 1130 via connector 1134.
      <br/>
      The resulting liquid form of the ingredient is preferably dispensed from tubing 1130 via outflow spout 1132 where the flavored liquid can mix with a brewed beverage in a container.
    </p>
    <p num="59">
      Throughout the description of the invention, persons of ordinary skill in the art will realize that the tubing used for the invention can consist of any appropriate material.
      <br/>
      In the preferred embodiment, the tubing is made of plastic material to permit a high degree of flexibility and still provide an easy system for cleaning and or replacing.
      <br/>
      However, if necessary, tubing can also be made from metal such as copper or aluminum without departing from the spirit of the invention.
    </p>
    <p num="60">Although the ingredients stored in storage bins 135 are preferably dry and are water soluble, e.g. they are in powder form, in alternative embodiments, the ingredients can be stored as liquids that, depending on their concentration, can be further diluted by water in mixing chamber 1370 as described above, or can not be diluted and can thus be directly dispensed from bins 135 into a container for the brewed drink via tubing 1130 and outflow spout 1132.</p>
    <p num="61">
      As mentioned above, the preferred embodiment of the invention dispenses either hot or cool beverages.
      <br/>
      To obtain a hot beverage, persons of ordinary skill in the art will understand that when water is mixed with an ingredient, the water is preferably hot.
      <br/>
      To prepare a cool beverage, the brewing portion of the process preferably still occurs with hot water, but the resulting hot brewed beverage is mixed in the user's container or cup with ambient temperature water, which is dispensed through tubing 1120 and spout or outlet 1122.
      <br/>
      Tubing 1120 preferably receives ambient temperature water from a water tank 400 (see FIGS. 4 and 7) situated at the rear of the machine.
      <br/>
      Consumers can additionally cool the beverage by adding ice to the beverage container either prior to the dispense of the drink or after.
    </p>
    <p num="62">
      Persons of ordinary skill in the art will, therefore, understand that the brewing system can preferably brew and dispense a condensed form of the beverage that is diluted either with flavored hot water originating from mixing assembly 1300 or with hot water without any additive from mixing assembly 1300, or with room temperature water from tubing 1120.
      <br/>
      However, as described herein, the proper brew strength, brew volume, temperature, and dilution are all preferably controlled by programmable components that contribute to the versatility of the invention, and therefore, the settings can even be programmed to permit suitable brewing of a beverage without the addition of an unflavored dilutant.
      <br/>
      In the preferred embodiment, any of these features can be further adjusted and controlled by the operator of the machine.

      Preferably, these remnants or dregs fall behind the hoses 1120 and 1130 and into waste container 1400.
      <br/>
      Waste container 1400 is also preferably configured to provide easy removal from the cabinet assembly 100 for periodically emptying the contents within the waste container.
    </p>
    <p num="64">
      Among other things, the aforementioned control system can be programmed to monitor and alert the machine's operator as to when the waste container needs to be emptied.
      <br/>
      In the preferred embodiment, this occurs via tracking the number of beverages brewed by the machine, but alternative embodiments can include sensor elements operably positioned to sense the fullness of the waste container and to correspondingly transmit a signal to the control means to alert the operator, temporarily shut down the machine, or take other appropriate action.
    </p>
    <p num="65">
      Further details of the preferred embodiment of the invention are illustrated in the accompanying FIGS. 3 through 15.
      <br/>
      Because several of the components (e.g. connecting elements such as nuts, bolts, washers, or clamps), are repeated throughout the drawings and would be obvious to one of ordinary skill in the art to use those elements to assemble the inventive apparatus, they are not specifically noted and described in further detail.
