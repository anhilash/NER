      Therapeutic complexes comprising plural therapeutic compounds self assembled into high axial ratio microstructures are described.
      <br/>
      The therapeutic complexes satisfy the formula HARM-Th, wherein HARM is a high axial ratio forming material and Th is a therapeutic coupled to or associated with the HARM.
      <br/>
      The therapeutic complexes also can satisfy the formula HARM-S-Th, wherein S is a spacer.
      <br/>
      Release of the therapeutic by the complex generally follows either 0-order kinetics or psuedo-first order kinetics.
      <br/>
      A method for delivering therapeutics to oransims, particularly humans, also is described.
      <br/>
      The method comprises administering an effective amount of (1) a ligand, such as a therapeutic, self-assembled into a HAR microstructure, or (2) a ligand, such as a therapeutic, coupled to or associated with a material capable of thereafter self-assembling into a high axial ratio microstructure, to the mammal.
      <br/>
      Nucleic acids are an example of a ligand that can be administered effectively according to this method through noncovalent attachment to the HARM-forming materials.

    <heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">The present invention concerns compounds, compositions and methods useful for delivering therapeutics.</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="3">
      Two current issues in drug delivery concern the spatial and temporal attributes of therapeutic delivery systems.
      <br/>
      Targeting the therapeutic to limit its exposure to the desired site of action is the spatial aspect.
      <br/>
      Controlling the delivery of the therapeutic over time is the temporal aspect.
      <br/>
      Continuous drug release often is preferable to periodically administering bolus doses to the entire organism.
      <br/>
      Bolus administration results in a spike of drug concentration, followed by a decrease in concentration to baseline.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      Moreover, patients often fail to comply with bolus drug administration procedures, one example being outpatients who do not complete their course of antibiotics.
      <br/>
      This is a key problem in controlling emerging drug-resistant strains of tuberculosis, and is probably a factor contributing to an increase in the appearance of many other drug-resistant strains of bacteria.
      <br/>
      The cost in morbidity and mortality from inadequate frequency of dosing with insulin is known to be in the billions of dollars in the United States alone.
      <br/>
      Reach et al.'s Can Continuous Glucose Monitoring be used for the Treatment of Diabetes, 64:381A-386A (Analytical Chemistry, 1992).
      <br/>
      Restricting ambulatory patients to a hospital setting to insure compliance (or establishing some other system of enforced compliance) is not a practical solution.
      <br/>
      Patient noncompliance with bolus administration procedures therefore is an important impetus for developing continuous drug delivery systems.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      At present there are several approaches to controlled or continuous drug delivery, some of which are still in the research phases, and some of which have been successfully used in commercial products for some time.
      <br/>
      Prevost et al.'s New Methods of Drug Delivery, 249:1527-1533 (Science, 1990).
      <br/>
      The delivery approaches include: (1) external delivery systems, such as external mechanical pumps and osmotic patches; (2) internal osmotic pumps; and (3) implantable or ingestible polymeric structures that can include erodible hydrogels.
      <br/>
      With pumps, continuous release can be set by the pump design or by controlling the motor.
      <br/>
      Continuous drug delivery using continuous infusion with an i.v. line (the only viable method for some chemotherapeutic drugs) is costly and restricts the patient's movement.
      <br/>
      Implanted catheters and pumps are an expensive solution, the considerable risk of which is only balanced by the importance of continuous delivery of the drug in question.
      <br/>
      Using implantable macroscopic devices for drug delivery restricts the site of delivery to one that can accommodate the object.
      <br/>
      The NORPLANT.RTM. contraceptive system, effective though it is, requires a large insertion site and must be surgically recovered after use.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      With polymeric structures the rate of delivery can be controlled by the shape and permeability-erodability of the polymer.
      <br/>
      Dermal patches are very simple and relatively noninvasive.
      <br/>
      However, dermal patches have been effective only for a few drugs that are relatively permeant through the skin.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      Some of the approaches discussed above work well for some classes of drugs, and are inapplicable to others.
      <br/>
      The chemically labile nature of peptide drugs, for example, results in their incompatibility with many polymeric delivery systems.
      <br/>
      Those polymers in which they can be immobilized have yet to be approved for general use.
      <br/>
      And, the common feature of all the existing delivery systems listed above is that they control diffusion or effusion by a macroscopic mechanical object.
      <br/>
      This limits their usefulness and makes using the delivery systems a nuisance and perhaps even requires invasive surgical implanting.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      Drug distribution can be controlled by the microstructures into which the drug self-assembles.
      <br/>
      Liposomes are one example of a self-assembled microstructure, and encapsulating drugs in liposomes has proven useful in some circumstances.
      <br/>
      Ostro, Liposomes: From Biophysics to Therapeutics, Marcel Dekker, Inc. (1987).
      <br/>
      For instance, liposomes can be used to deliver drugs to skin.
      <br/>
      Yager et al's Conjugation of Phosphatidyl-ethanolamine to poly(n-isopropylacrylamide) for Potential Use in Liposomal Drug Delivery Systems, 33:4659-4662 (Polymer, 1992).
      <br/>
      Phosphatidylglycerols have been modified with a wide range of peptide and non-peptide drugs (in particular AZT) with the assumption that they would self-assemble into liposomes, and would be trapped by macrophages in the reticuloendothelial system after injection into the bloodstream.

      <br/>
      Am. Chem. Soc., 1993).
      <br/>
      Beyond the general assumption that liposomes would be formed, how hydrophobically modified drugs self-associate, and how the self-association affects the conformation of the drugs themselves, is largely unknown.

      Lipid tubules are a recently discovered self-organizing system in which lipids crystallize into tightly packed bilayers that spontaneously form hollow cylinders less than 1  MU m in diameter.
      <br/>
      The basic subunit of the tubule is a helical ribbon of lipid bilayer and, in some cases, open helical structures of the same diameter can be seen.
      <br/>
      In 1983, polymerizable diacetylenic phosphatidylcholines such as 1,2-di-(10,12-tricosadiynoyl)-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (referred to as DC8,9 PC) were discovered by Yager and Schoen to form novel hollow tubular microstructures.
      <br/>
      See, for instance, Yager et al.'s Formation of Tubules by a Polymerizable Surfactant, 106:371-381 (Mol. Cryst. Liq. Cryst., 1984).
      <br/>
      Diacetylenic lipid tubules are straight, rigid, about 0.75  MU m in diameter, and can be made to range in length from a few pm to nearly 1 mm, depending on the conditions used to form the microstructure.
      <br/>
      Further, the walls of the tubules may be as thin as a single bilayer.
      <br/>
      The lumen (the open space in a tubular organ or device) is generally open, allowing free access by diffusion from the ends of the microstructures.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      Kunitake et al. demonstrated that a positively charged chiral amphiphile based on glutamate forms structures similar to those formed by DC8,9 PC.
      <br/>
      Kunitake et al.'s Helical Superstructures are Formed from Chiral Ammonium Bilayer Membranes, 1709-1712 (Chem. Lett., 1984).
      <br/>
      Helices and tubules of much smaller diameters (.about.300  Angstrom ) were found by Yamada et al. to form from related synthetic two-chain amphiphiles with oligopeptides (such as 12-14-mers of glutamic and aspartic acid) as hydrophilic headgroups.
      <br/>
      Yamada et al.'s Formation of Helical Super Structure from Single-Walled Bilayers by Amphiphiles with Oligo-L-Glutamic Acid-Head Group, 10:1713-1716 (Chem. Lett., 1984).

      Relationship Between Formation of Helical Bilayer membranes and Chemical Structures of Dialkyl Amphiphiles with Polypeptide-Head Groups, 48:327-334 (Kobunshi Ronbunshu, 1991).
      <br/>
      Recent work by Shimizu and Hato on similar lipids with polypeptide headgroups, including (Pro)3 -tripeptide, produced similar tubules and helices.
      <br/>
      Later studies by the Yamada group ascertained that both positive, negative and neutral amino acids could be incorporated into block copolymers as headgroups for glutamate-based lipopeptides.
    </p>
    <p num="11">
      However, fully charging the headgroups prevented tubule and helix formation.
      <br/>
      This is presumably because charging the polypeptide side chains increases the headgroup excluded volume to the point that close packing of the hydrocarbon chains is no longer possible in a planar bilayer.
      <br/>
      Further, there was evidence that the secondary structure of the polypeptide varied with the nature of the microstructure and that  BETA -sheet formed between headgroup polypeptides.
    </p>
    <p num="12">
      It recently was determined that helical and tubular structures, as well as rod-like cochleate cylinders, can be formed quantitatively from the n-fatty acyl and  ALPHA -hydroxy fatty acyl fractions of bovine brain galactocerebrosides, designated NFA-cer and HFA-cer, respectively.
      <br/>
      Yager et al.'s Microstructural Polymorphism in Bovine Brain Galactocerebrosides and its Two Major Subfractions, 31:9045-9055 (Biochem., 1992).
      <br/>
      Tubular and helical structures have now bee(n observed in samples of aged suspensions of saturated-chain phosphatidylcholines and as transient intermediates in the crystallization of cholesterol from mixed micellar suspensions.
      <br/>
      See, for instance, Konikoff et al.'s Filamentous, Helical, and Tubular Microstructures During Cholesterol Crystallization from Bile, 90:1155-1160 (J.
      <br/>
      Clin. Invest., 1992).
    </p>
    <p num="13">
      There appear to have been no commercialized uses for tubules to date.
      <br/>
      Lipid tubules have been "decorated" with inorganic materials, including metals �See, for instance, Schnur et al.'s U.S. Pat. No. 4,911,981, entitled Metal Clad Lipid Microstructures� and salts �Yager et al.'s Formation of Mineral Microstructures with a High Aspect Ratio from Phospholipid Bilayer Tubules, 11:633-636 (J.
      <br/>
      Mat. Sci. Lett., 1992), although a practical use for these materials has not yet been reported.
      <br/>
      Some preliminary work has been undertaken to use the lumen of diacetylenic lipid tubules as a reservoir for the encapsulation of drugs for delivery in wound dressings.
      <br/>
      See, for instance, Cliff et al.'s The Use of Lipid Microcylinders as Release Vehicles; Release Rates of Growth Factors and Cytokines, Fourth World Biomaterials Conference (1992).
      <br/>
      These procedures have yet to realize and exploit the beneficial physical characteristics of tubules.
    </p>
    <p num="14">
      There also are patented approaches to using cochleate cylinders as drug delivery systems.
      <br/>
      For example, Mannino et al. have used cochleates cylinders, formed by the addition of calcium ions to some negatively charged phopholipids, to encapsulate materials.
      <br/>
      See, for example, U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,663,161 and 4,871,488, and international patent application, No. PCT/US96/01704.
      <br/>
      Mannino's cochleate cylinders apparently undergo a transformation to a liposomal intermediate prior to drug release.
    </p>
    <heading>SUMMARY</heading>
    <p num="15">
      The ligand delivery approach described herein is distinctly different, and potentially much more widely applicable, than any of the prior known methods for continuously delivering ligands, such as therapeutics.
      <br/>
      The invention provides ligand materials, which are themselves capable of forming high axial ratio microstructures, particularly tubules, cochleate cylinders, helical ribbons and twisted ribbons.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, compounds according to the formula
      <br/>
      HARM-Lg
    </p>
    <p num="16">
      are provided wherein "HARM" refers to molecules, e.g., lipid molecules, that are capable of self-assembling into high axial ratio microstructures. "Lg" is a ligand, such as a diagnostic or a therapeutic, coupled to or associated with the HARM.
      <br/>
      The ligand can be any agent now known or hereafter developed that does not interfere with the formation of high axial ratio (HAR) microstructures.
      <br/>
      By way of example, and without limitation, the Lg may be selected from the group consisting of peptides, nucleic acids, antigens and conventional pharmaceuticals.
    </p>
    <p num="17">
      Certain HARMs used for working embodiments of the invention satisfy the formula
      <br/>
      R1 R2 CH--X
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      wherein R1 and R2 are alkyl, alkenyl (i.e., compounds that include at least one double bond), alkynyl (i.e., compounds that include at least one triple bond) or heteroalkyl, heteroalkenyl or heteroalkynyl chains having from about 10 to about 25 carbon atoms.
      <br/>
      Heteroalkyl, heteroalkenyl and heteroalkynyl compounds are compounds that include heteroatoms, such as, without limitation, nitrogen, oxygen and sulfur.
      <br/>
      X is a hydrophilic group.
      <br/>
      R1 and R2 preferably include at least one site of unsaturation, and generally are coupled to the carbon atom by functional groups that include heteroatoms, particularly but not necessarily, esters and amides.
      <br/>
      R1 and R2 also can be attached to a chiral carbon.
      <br/>
      Certain compounds according to this formula have been made wherein X is a polypeptide, such as polyglutamate or polyaspartate.
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      Moreover, spacers can be used to couple ligands to HARMs.
      <br/>
      One example, without limitation, of a class of suitable spacers are polypeptides that include enzyme cleavage sites, such as protease cleavage sites recognized by trypsin, trypsin-like enzymes and elastase.
    </p>
    <p num="20">
      Still another embodiment of the invention provides HARM-Lgs which generally satisfy *he formula
      <br/>
      R1 R2 --Y--CH--Lg
    </p>
    <p num="21">
      wherein R1 and R2 are hydrophobic alkyl, alkenyl or alkynyl chains having from about 10 to about 25 carbon atoms, Y is selected from the group consisting of --CO--NH--, --NH--CO--, --O--CO--, and --CO--O--, and wherein Lg is selected from the group consisting of peptides, nucleic acids, antigens and conventional pharmaceuticals.
      <br/>
      R1 and R2 may both include at least one site of unsaturation.
    </p>
    <p num="22">
      The present invention also provides compositions useful for delivering ligands, such as therapeutic agents.
      <br/>
      The compositions comprise plural constituent molecules self-assembled into HAR microstructures.
      <br/>
      Each constituent molecule satisfies the formula
      <br/>
      HARM-Lg
    </p>
    <p num="23">
      as discussed above.
      <br/>
      The ligand may be coupled to the HARM using a spacer (S), i.e. HARM-S-Lg.
    </p>
    <p num="24">
      The compositions may self assemble so that only a portion of the plural constituent molecules have therapeutics coupled to HARMs.
      <br/>
      Moreover, the plural constituent molecules self-assembled into HAR microstructures can have plural different Ligands.
      <br/>
      The result is a microstructure having plural different ligands associated therewith.
    </p>
    <p num="25">
      The present invention also provides a method for delivering ligands, such as therapeutic agents, particularly in a steady, continuous manner.
      <br/>
      The method comprises administering to a person or animal effective amounts of compounds or compositions made in accordance with the present invention comprising plural constituent molecules self-assembled into HAR microstructures.
      <br/>
      The method can comprise administering effective amounts of compounds satisfying the formulas discussed above, including the use of spacers.
      <br/>
      The compounds or compositions may be administered by any number of methods including, but not limited to, topically, orally, such as in the case of vaccines, intramuscularly, intranasally, subcutaneously, intraperitoneally, intralesionally or intravenously.
      <br/>
      And, the compositions may further comprise conventional materials known in the pharmaceutical field, including materials selected from the group consisting of buffers, stabilizers, diluents and adjuvants.
    </p>
    <p num="26">
      Complexes comprising noncovalent association of ligands, such as nucleic acids, with HARM forming materials recently have proved important.
      <br/>
      A working embodiment comprises a complex self-assembled into high axial ratio microstructures, the complex satisfying the formula HARM-Lg. "HARM" is a high axial ratio microstructure forming material and Lg is a ligand, particularly a therapeutic, noncovalently associated with the high axial ratio microstructure forming material.
      <br/>
      The HARM is selected from the group consisting of tubules, cochleate cylinders, helical ribbons, twisted ribbons, and mixtures thereof.
      <br/>
      These complexes also can further comprise ligands covalently bonded to the high axial ratio microsrtucture forming material, ligands entrapped in the lumen of the high axial ratio micrstructure, or both.
    </p>
    <p num="27">
      Both nuclear and plasmid DNA have been administered in vivo using such complexes.

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
    <p num="37">
      The present invention provides ligands, and compositions comprising such ligands, particularly therapeutics, that are capable of self assembling into HAR microstructures.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, the ligand may be coupled to or associated with materials capable of forming HAR microstructures. "Coupled to or associated with" includes, but is not limited to, covalent bonding, hydrogen bonding, ionic bonding, electrostatic interactions, electron donor-acceptor interactions, etc.
      <br/>
      Nucleic acids, for example, have been electrostatically associated with HAR microstructures, including glutamic acid dialkyl amides, and these complexes have been used to deliver and protect (such as from nucleases) nuclear and plasmid DNA.
      <br/>
      The lipid structural components are generally intended to be completely metabolized into nontoxic products.
    </p>
    <p num="38">
      As used herein, "HAR microstructure" refers to microstructures where the ratio of the major axes is from about 2 to 5,000, and more typically from about 2 to 1,000.
      <br/>
      For example, with an HFA-cerebroside cochleate cylinder having a diameter of about 0.1  MU m, there are about 20 lipid bilayer "wraps" in the structure.
      <br/>
      This means that at the end of the cochleate cylinder there is about 3  MU m of linear bilayer edge exposed.
      <br/>
      This cochleate cylinder would have an axial ratio of greater than 300 (30  MU m in length divided by 0.1  MU m in diameter=300).
      <br/>
      Examples, without limitation, of suitable HAR microstructures include tubules, cochleate cylinders, helical ribbons, twisted ribbons, and mixtures thereof.
      <br/>
      FIG. 1 provides a schematic representation of tubules and cochleate microstructures.
    </p>
    <p num="39">
      HARMs solve many continuous ligand delivery problems, and are useful for the continuous release of ligands.
      <br/>
      One reason for this is that the geometry of ligand particles affects the kinetics of ligand release.
      <br/>
      Moreover, the environment in which the compounds undergo hydrolysis or enzymatic cleavage also can effect the kinetics of the reaction.
      <br/>
      This is discussed in more detail below.
    </p>
    <p num="40">
      There are at least two methods for using HAR microstructures to produce continuous release of ligands.
      <br/>
      The first depends only on the dissolution of the ligand from the ends of HAR microstructures.
      <br/>
      This mechanism is illustrated in FIG. 2.
      <br/>
      In the second mechanism, the ligand is released from the HAR microstructure by the influence of an enzyme-catalyzed hydrolysis reaction.
      <br/>
      This is illustrated in FIG. 3.
      <br/>
      See the "Kinetics" section below for more discussion.
    </p>
    <p num="41">
      The present method of controlled release avoids pumps or incorporation of ligand into a macroscopic rigid matrix of a particular shape.
      <br/>
      The small diameter of HARMs allows them to be placed into cavities in the body using a needle or catheter, whereas their length immobilizes them after injection.
      <br/>
      For example, a wide range of HARM-based antitumor drugs could be injected into tumors (intralesionally) using small needles.
    </p>
    <p num="42">The following paragraphs (1) discuss the complexes, i.e., HARMs-Lg or HARMs-S-Lg, of the present invention and compositions comprising these complexes, (2) provide detail concerning how such compounds and complexes can be made, as well as the kinetics of dissolution and enzymatic cleavage, and (3) describe using HARM complexes for administering therapeutics in vivo.</p>
    <p num="43">I. HARM-FORMING MATERIALS AND THERAPEUTICS</p>
    <p num="44">
      HARM-forming materials might themselves be useful, such as being therapeutics.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, ligands, such as therapeutics, are coupled to or associated with HARMs to produce composite compounds, also referred to herein as complexes.
      <br/>
      These composite compounds can satisfy the formulas HARM-Lg or HARM-S-Lg, where "HARM" refers to molecules that form high axial ratio microstructures, "Lg" is a ligand, such as a therapeutic, and "S" is a spacer.
      <br/>
      Complexes according to the present invention, such as HARM-Lg and HARM-S-Lg compounds, form suitable high axial ratio microstructures when subjected to microstructure-forming regimens.
      <br/>
      HARMs, therapeutics and spacers are discussed below.

      By way of example only and without limitation, specific materials that can be used to form high axial ratio microstructures for producing composite compounds for the delivery of therapeutics include amino-acid based amphiphiles, phospholipid-based amphiphiles, sphingosine-based amphiphiles (two types) and aldonamide-based amphiphiles.
      <br/>
      Generic structural formulas for these materials are provided below as Formulas 1-5, respectively.  (Chemical Structure image '2' not included in text)

    <p num="47">where n=1-10, preferably 1-2; m=1-10, preferably 1-2; R1 is an aromatic ring or rings, typically 1-3 rings, or an aliphatic organic or heteroaliphatic organic chain having from about 1-30 atoms, 0-6 sites of unsaturation, such as double bonds, triple bonds, and combinations of double and triple bonds, and 0-6 heteroatoms, such as O, S, N, and combinations of such heteroatoms, R2 is H, R1 or R4 ; R3 is a functional group that allows noncovalent bonding of Lg to HARM; R4 is an aromatic ring or rings, typically 1-3 rings, or an aliphatic organic or heteroaliphatic organic chain having from about 1-30 atoms, 0-6 sites of unsaturation, such as double bonds, triple bonds, and combinations of double and triple bonds, and 0-6 heteroatoms, such as O, S, N, and combinations of such heteroatoms.</p>
    <p num="48">Particular examples of these general materials include glutamate-based amphiphiles (Formula 6), polyglutamate-based amphiphiles (Formula 7), phosphatidylcholine with tricosadiynoyl fatty acyl chains, referred to as DC8,9 PC (Formula 8), NFA-Galactocerebroside (NFA-Gal-cer) (Formula 9), and analogs of these compounds.

    <p num="49">
      The compound s represented by Formulas 6-9 are commercially available or can be synthesized according to published procedures.

      <br/>
      NFA-Gal-cer and HFA-Gal-cer are commercially available from Sigma Chemical Company.
      <br/>
      Glutamate-based amphiphiles (represented by Formula 6) can be synthesized using procedures published by Kunitake.
      <br/>
      See, for instance, Kunitake et al.'s Helical Superstructures are Formed from Chiral Ammonium Bilayers, 1709-1712 (Chem. Lett., 1984). gee, also, Lee, et al., Formation of High Axial Ratio Microstructures from Peptides Modified with Glutamic Acid Dialkyl Amides, Biochemica et Biophysica Acta, 1371:168-184 (1998), which is incorporated herein by reference.

    <p num="50">
      Compounds according to Formula 7, and derivatives thereof, can be synthesized according to the methods described by Yamada, such as in Yamada et al.'s Formation of Helical Super Structure from Single-Walled Bilayers by Amphiphiles with Oligo-L-Glutamic Acid-Head Group, 10:1713-1716 (Chem.

      Briefly, hexadecylamine was coupled to both of the free carboxyl groups of N-carbobenzoxy-L-glutamic acid with diethyl cyanophosphonate in the presence of triethylamine to form amide linkages.
      <br/>
      The carbobenzoxy protecting group was removed by hydrogenation using 10% Pd on activated carbon.

    <p num="51">
      Analogs of the compounds represented by Formulas 6-9 also have proved useful for forming HARMs.
      <br/>
      For instance, the alkyl chains in each of the compounds shown in Formulas 6-9 can be changed to have different numbers of carbon atoms, as long as these modifications do not prevent such compounds from forming HARMs.
      <br/>
      The alkyl chain lengths, for example, of compounds satisfying Formula 7 have been varied to be other than C-12.
      <br/>
      The number of carbon atoms in such chains typically varies from about 8 carbon atoms to about 30 carbon atoms, typically from about 10 carbon atoms to about 20 carbon atoms, with the best results being achieved to date by compounds having from about 10 carbon atoms to about 14 carbon atoms.
    </p>
    <p num="52">
      Functional-group changes to compounds satisfying Formulas 6-9 also can be made to form additional analogs useful for form HARM-Th complexes.

      Peptides also can be used to form vaccines, such as orally administered vaccines. "Vaccine" generally refers to systems that deliver an antigen, generally a peptide, protein, or nucleic acid that codes for a peptide or protein, in a controlled manner to elicit an immune response.

    <p num="78">
      Another example of a class of compounds commonly used as therapeutics are steroids.

      Examples of candidate steroids for forming high axial ratio microstructure complexes include estrogen, progesterone and testosterone.

      Synthetic and/or semi-synthetic derivatives (eg estrone or methyl-testosterone) also can be used.
      <br/>
      Combinations of these steroids also may be used, such as are used in birth control formulations, and methylprednisolone, which is used as an anti-inflammatory corticosteroid.

    <p num="82">4. Nucleic Acids</p>
    <p num="83">
      Nucleic acids encoding biologically-active peptides and proteins are being used more often as potential therapeutics and vaccination tools.
      <br/>
      Nucleic acids useful in the practice of the present invention comprise isolated nucleic acids.
      <br/>
      An "isolated" nucleic acid has been substantially separated or purified away from other nucleic acid sequences in the cell of the organism from which it naturally occurs, i.e., other chromosomal and extrachromosomal DNA and RNA.
      <br/>
      The term thus encompasses nucleic acids purified by standard nucleic acid purification means.
      <br/>
      It also embraces nucleic acids prepared by recombinant expression in a host cell and chemically synthesized nucleic acids.
      <br/>
      Also included are nucleic acids that are substantially similar to such nucleic acids.
      <br/>
      Methods for chemical synthesis of nucleic acids are discussed, for example, in Beaucage and Carruthers, Tetra.
      <br/>
      Letts. 22:1859-1862, 1981, and Matteucci et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc. 103:31835, 1981.
      <br/>
      Chemical synthesis of nucleic acids may be performed, for example, on commercial automated oligonucleotide synthesizers.
    </p>
    <p num="84">
      Without an adequate delivery system, nucleic acids cannot be used as therapeutics due to their low permeability through cell membranes, excretion and enzymatic degradation.
      <br/>
      Glutamic acid dialkylamide-based HARMs have been used both as a depot vehicle as well as a material for internalizing DNA.
      <br/>
      Glutamic acid dialkylamides (GADs) are positively charged under physiological conditions.
      <br/>
      Phase transition temperatures and solubilities of GAD-based HARMs can be varied by altering the hydrocarbon chain length and head group structure of the constituent glutamic acid derivatives, allowing their physical properties to be tailored for a particular purpose.
    </p>
    <p num="85">
      DNA-HARM complexes slowly release DNA into the interstitial space of tissues due to dissolution of a HARM-forming GAD.
      <br/>
      This provides a sustained source of naked DNA.
    </p>
    <p num="86">
      HARMs formed from GADs with a chain melting temperature close to physiological temperature enhances fusion with cell membranes because of their own membrane rearrangements upon injection.
      <br/>
      Such fusion transfers HARM-incorporated DNA through the membranes.
      <br/>
      Additionally, fine tuned HARM-based DNA delivery systems can be constructed employing GADs with peptide head groups with specific properties such as affinity to certain type of cells, peptides facilitating lipid membranes fusion, etc.

    <p num="87">C. SPACERS</p>
    <p num="88">
      Ligands can be directly coupled to HA?Ms or materials that when coupled to the ligands can still form the high axial ratio microstructures.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, the ligand can be coupled to the HARM, or material used to form the HARM, using a spacer (spacers also are referred to as tethers and linkers), i.e., HARM-S-Lg.
      <br/>
      Spacers uncouple the steric interactions of the agents from the packing of the HAR-forming lipids.
      <br/>
      The spacer also can provide a cleavage site recognized by an enzyme that is either dispensed in combination with the HARMs-Lgs compounds, or is endogenous to the environment in which the HARMs-Lgs are administered.
      <br/>
      See FIG. 4, which provides a schematic representation illustrating the use of spacers for coupling ligands to HAR microstructures.
    </p>
    <p num="89">
      Polypeptides are an example of a class of spacers.
      <br/>
      Such polypeptides generally will include a sequence known to be susceptible to attack by a protease, such as, without limitation, trypsin and trypsin-like enzymes (trypsin cleaves on the carboxyl side of lysine and arginine residues) and elastase (which recognizes Ala-Ala-Ala sequences) at the site of use.
      <br/>
      For instance, compounds similar to that shown in Formula 6 have been made which include trypsin cleavage sites at different positions along the chain.
      <br/>
      Packing of the drugs at the surface of the microstructure generally is tight enough to prevent access by a protease.
      <br/>
      Only at the disordered ends of the HAR microstructures is there access to the cleavage site for enzyme activity.
      <br/>
      As a result, drug release is controlled by the constant number of intact spacers exposed at the advancing front.
    </p>
    <p num="90">
      Polypeptides are not the only compounds potentially useful as spacers for the purpose of separating the steric interaction between the HARM and ligands.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, the spacer might include a functional group of limited stability against cleavage at the site of use.
      <br/>
      For example, the spacer might simply comprise alkyl, alkenyl or alkynyl carbon chains having a functionality that is readily cleaved in the environment in which the composite compounds are administered.
      <br/>
      Such compounds might be esters, as long as the ester functionality is sufficiently labile in the environment in which the composite compounds are administered to release Lg upon hydrolysis.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, the spacers might comprise carbohydrates or polyoxyalkylenes, particularly polyoxymethylene and polyoxyethylene.

    <p num="91">II. Forming Complexes Comprising HARM-Lg and HARM-S-Lg</p>
    <p num="92">
      The following paragraphs discuss bonding or associating particular classes of compounds to HARMs to form the composite HARM-Lg or HARM-S-Lg.
      <br/>
      Specific guidance as to the means for bonding or associating Lg to a particular HARM depends upon several factors, including the nature of the HARM, the Lg, and on the environment in which the composite compounds will be administered.
      <br/>
      For covalent, electrostatic or hydrogen bonding, the head group of the HARMs described herein include nucleophilic and/or polar groups, such as amine and hydroxyl groups.
      <br/>
      For covalent bonding, these nucleophilic groups can be reacted with electrophilic species to couple the agents to the HARMs.
    </p>
    <p num="93">A. PEPTIDES</p>
    <p num="94">
      Peptides, such as insulin and enkephalins, are an important class of compounds that can be delivered using HARMs.
      <br/>
      Peptides of any desired sequence can be synthesized using standard synthetic techniques, such as solid-phase synthesis using Applied Biosystems Peptide Synthesizers or other available devices.
      <br/>
      In order to couple the peptide to the  ALPHA -amino group of dialkylated glutamine compounds or glutamic acid lipids, the peptide is prepared with its N-terminus and all of its reactive side chains in protected form.
      <br/>
      Moreover, the peptide includes a free C-terminal carboxyl group.
      <br/>
      This is accomplished using a special peptide synthesis resin called super acid-sensitive resin, known as SASRIN, which is available from Bachem, Inc.
      <br/>
      The fully protected peptide is cleaved from the resin with mild acid, such as 1% trifluoroacetic acid in methylene chloride.
      <br/>
      This leaves the side chain and N-terminus protecting groups intact.
    </p>
    <p num="95">
      Peptide synthesis is accomplished with the a-amino groups of the amino acids protected, such as with a fluorenylmethyloxycarbonyl (FMOC) protecting group, and bearing standard side-chain protecting groups that are removed with strong acid (i.e., trityl, t-butyl, etc.).
      <br/>
      After the N-terminal amino acid is attached to the polypeptide, the FMOC group can be left on and removed along with the side chain protecting groups after the peptide is coupled to the lipid.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, the FMOC protecting group can be removed while the peptide is still bound to the resin.
      <br/>
      This allows modifications of the N-terminus, such as by modifying the N-terminus with probes.
      <br/>
      Probes containing an N-hydroxylsuccinimide ester or an isothiocyanate can be used for attachment to the peptide N-terminus.
    </p>
    <p num="96">
      After the polypeptide is cleaved from the SASRIN resin, it is then coupled to the a-amino group of dialkylated glutamine compounds or glutamic acid lipids using either dicyclohexylcarbodiimide or diethyl phosphorylcyanate in a solvent such as DMF or methylene chloride.
      <br/>
      Coupling is monitored by observing the loss of the lipid NH2 group using the Kaiser test.
      <br/>
      Kaiser et al.'s Color Test for Detection of Free Terminal Amino Groups in the Solid-Phase Synthesis of Peptides, 34:595-598 (Anal. Biochem., 1970).
      <br/>
      After coupling, the crude material is treated with neat trifluoroacetic acid containing the appropriate scavengers (thioanisole, 1,2-dithioethane, etc., depending on the structure of the side-chain protecting groups).
      <br/>
      The crude Lipidic-peptides are purified by HPLC on a reverse-phase column.

      Desired nucleic acid compounds can be attached to the HARMs by a variety of methods.
      <br/>
      However, by way of example only and without limitation, nucleic acids can be covalently coupled to HARMs using the 5'-hydroxyl group.
      <br/>
      This hydroxyl group can be used to link nucleic acids to the HAR-forming lipids via an ester functionality.
      <br/>
      Because a number of the HAR-forming lipids used for the present invention have amines at the head group (See, for instance, the compounds of Table 1), an additional group containing a free carboxyl group must be used to couple the nucleic acids tc the HARM-forming lipids.
      <br/>
      For example, peptide spacers comprising amino acids having a side-chain carboxyl group can be used to couple nucleic acids to the HARMs.
      <br/>
      Aspartic and glutamic acid are examples of amino acids having a carboxyl functionality that could be included in the peptide spacer to link nucleic acids to the HARM-forming molecules.

    <p num="99">
      It also has been demonstrated that nucleic acids can be associated noncovalently with materials to form complexes having high axial ratio microstructures.

      Furthermore, the complexes protect the DNA from enzymatic degradation.

    <p num="101">
      Conventional pharmaceuticals also can be attached to the HARMs.
      <br/>
      The method for attachment depends on the particular HARM and therapeutic selected.
      <br/>
      However, solely by way of example, the following provides a discussion concerning the attachment of particular classes of conventional therapeutics to HARMs.
    </p>
    <p num="102">1. Steroids</p>
    <p num="103">
      Steroids generally have a hydroxyl group in the A ring (the first 6-membered ring).

      This hydroxyl group can be used to link steroids to the HAR-forming lipids via an ester functionality as discussed above for nucleic acids.
      <br/>
      Because a number of the HAR-forming lipids used for the present invention have amines at the head group (See, for instance, the compounds of Table 1), an additional group containing a free carboxyl group must be used to couple the steroid to the HAR-forming lipids.
      <br/>
      Amino acids having a carboxyl group in a side chain could be included in peptide spacers to link steroids to the HAR-forming molecules.

    <p num="104">2. Acetylsalicylic Acid</p>
    <p num="105">
      Acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin) is an additional example of a conventional therapeutic that could be delivered using HAR-forming lipids.
      <br/>
      Acetyl-salicylic acid includes a carboxyl group that could be used to form an amide with an amine or an ester with a hydroxyl group.
      <br/>
      As stated above, a number of the HTR-forming lipids have amines at the head group of the lipid.
      <br/>
      The amine could be used to form an amide with the carboxyl group of acetylsalicylic acid.
    </p>
    <p num="106">
      HAR-forming lipids that include hydroxyl groups could be directly attached to acetylsalicylic acid via an ester.
      <br/>
      HAR-forming lipids that have amines at the head group generally will be coupled to compounds such as acetylsalicylic acid using spacers.
      <br/>
      For example, polypeptide spacers could be used for this purpose wherein at least one of the amino acids in the polypeptide includes a side chain having an hydroxyl group, such as serine.
      <br/>
      The side-chain hydroxyl group could be coupled to the carboxyl group of acetylsalicylic acid via an ester functionality.

      Therapeutics can be coupled to or associated with compounds self assembled into HARMs.

    </p>
    <p num="128">V. Kinetics of Dissolution and Enzymatic Cleavage</p>
    <p num="129">
      There at least two mechanisms for dissolution and enzymatic cleavage of HAR therapeutic agents made in accordance with the present invention.
      <br/>
      In the first scenario, the HARM comprises an HAR-forming surfactant with a therapeutic coupled to or associated with its headgroup.
      <br/>
      The surfactant would be a lipidated drug if it were active in its intact form.
      <br/>
      However, if the therapeutic is released or activated by cleavage, such as enzymatic cleavage, after entering the target cell, then the compounds of the present invention function as lipidated prodrugs.
      <br/>
      The constant rate of Cylinder dissolution appears to be controlled largely by the solubility of the lipidated drug in the surrounding medium.
      <br/>
      The greater the ratio of head-group area to hydrocarbon chain surface area, the more rapid will be the dissolution and delivery.
    </p>
    <p num="130">
      In the second approach, the drug moiety is attached to the HAR-forming surfactant via a cleavable spacer (sometimes referred to as a tether).
      <br/>
      In general, spacers might be a polypeptide with a sequence known to be susceptible to attack by a protease at the site of use, or a functional group of limited stability against cleavage when exposed to the solution at the site of use.
      <br/>
      The drugs are packed tightly enough at the surface of the HARM microstructure too prevent access by a protease.
      <br/>
      Only at the disordered ends of the HARMs would there be access for the enzyme to interact with the HAR microstructures so that the release of the drug would be controlled by the constant number of intact spacers exposed at the advancing front of spacer cleavage.
      <br/>
      While this approach seems more complex, it allows using a single HARM and spacer for coupling to a wide range of water-soluble molecules, including biomolecules such as polypeptides and nucleic acids.
    </p>
    <p num="131">
      HARMs, particularly tubules and cochleate structures, generally are crystalline materials and tend to dissolve only from the surfaces and ends thereof, or perhaps from regions of imperfection in the HAR microstructure.
      <br/>
      The end-dominated dissolution model and lysis was evaluated both theoretically and empirically.
    </p>
    <p num="132">A. Theoretical Evaluation</p>
    <p num="133">
      Theoretical dissolution rates of three structures--a solid sphere, an infinitely long solid cylinder, and a slab were used to model the kinetics for dissolution at HAR microstructures, particularly tubule and cochleate ends.
      <br/>
      In all cases the dissolution rate is proportional to the exposed surface area.
      <br/>
      The three are drastically different when considering one particle or a homogeneous population of particles.
      <br/>
      However, heterogeneity in particle size softens the distinction between the models.
    </p>
    <p num="134">
      As shown in FIG. 6, the nature of the dissolution can be distinguished by the number and position of inflection points in the delivery rate curve.
      <br/>
      FIG. 6 shows that the relative release rate depends upon the morphology of the system.
      <br/>
      Both the sphere and the infinitely long solid cylinder exhibited dissolution rates that varied from relative rates of 2 or greater to 0 over the time period tested.
      <br/>
      On the other hand, the solid slab, which was used to model dissolution from tubules and cochleate structures, had a relative dissolution rate of about 1 over virtually the entire period tested.
    </p>
    <p num="135">
      The rate of appearance of dissolved surfactant or surfactant breakdown products from tubules appears to remain substantially constant until the number of tubules (and ends) declines.
      <br/>
      The rate of drug release to the tissue is limited by the rate of release from the ends of tubules, so that drug release rate generally is constant (0-order), as opposed to the more conventional first-order kinetics found with a wide range of other geometries.

      Cochleate cylinders therefore have two types of "free edges"; those at the microstructure ends, and one or two bilayer edges along the length of the microstructure.
      <br/>
      As a result, an appropriate model for the dissolution or enzymatic degradation of cochleate cylinders is the unrolled flat sheet that comprises the microstructure.
      <br/>
      In this model, very long and very short cochleate cylinders both can degrade with kinetics similar to those of the lipid tubules.
      <br/>
      If the sheet that wraps to form the cochleate cylinder has an axial ratio of about 10:1, there is only an 180 decrease in the hydrolysis or degradation rate before the microstructure is completely hydrolyzed or degraded (if the ratio is greater than 10:1, then the decrease in the hydrolysis rate or degradation rate is concomitantly decreased).
      <br/>
      As stated above, the cochleate cylinder formed by wrapping such a sheet has an axial ratio of greater than 300 (30  MU m in length divided by 0.1  MU m in diameter=300).
      <br/>
      However, if the sheet is nearly square then the rate of hydrolysis or degradation will decrease linearly until the cochleate microstructure is completely hydrolyzed or degraded.

      The rate of drug release generally will only be constant to the extent that the HAR microstructure population is homogeneous in length.
      <br/>
      While it is possible to form HAR microstructures with unimodal length distributions using particular crystallization methods �See, for instance, the crystallization protocol discussed in Yager et al.'s Helical and Tubular Microstructures Formed by Polymerizable Phosphatidylcholines, 109:6169-6175 (J.
      <br/>
      Am. Chem. Soc., 1987)� there is always a distribution of lengths about the mean.
      <br/>
      Storing the HAR microstructures often results in the smaller HAR microstructures converting to longer ones.
      <br/>
      It is possible to remove the extremes of the length distribution using filtration and sedimentation.

      Proof-of-Principle Experiment
    </p>
    <p num="140">
      A proof-of-principle experiment was performed on DC8,9 PC which is commercially available (Avanti Polar Lipids, Birmingham Ala.).
      <br/>
      The experiment was performed to prove that tubules could be enzymatically cleaved (and release fatty acid) at a constant rate.
      <br/>
      The enzyme phospholipase A2 (PLA2) is known to hydrolyze the fatty acid at the 2 position of the glycerol backbone of phospholipids.
      <br/>
      It is also known that PLA2 only binds tightly to bilayers in the presence of negatively charged lipids such as fatty acids; once some hydrolysis has occurred, the proportion of membrane-bound enzyme increases.
      <br/>
      PLA2 is known to hydrolyze the well-studied dipalmitoyl phosphatidylcholine (DPPC) below its Tm.
      <br/>
      An experiment was designed to determine whether PLA2 can work on DC8,9 PC below its TM in tubule form.
    </p>
    <p num="141">
      Small unilamellar vesicles (SUVs) were prepared from 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DPPC).
      <br/>
      The TM of DPPC at 41.3 (degree)  C. is similar to that of DC8,9 PC, and is only slightly depressed in SUVs.
      <br/>
      Because they have identical head groups, comparison of hydrolysis of DPPC vesicles and DC8,9 PC tubules allows isolation of those effects unique to a tubular microstructure.
      <br/>
      FIG. 8 shows the progress curves for the hydrolysis of 0.5 mM dispersion of DPPC SUVs and of multi lamellar DC8,8 PC tubules at 30 (degree)  C. by 2.24  MU g/ml PLA2 as determined by the production of free fatty acid.
      <br/>
      The hydrolysis progress curve for the control SUV dispersion of DPFC was biphasic, as expected.
      <br/>
      An initial rapid hydrolysis stage, which ends after roughly 50% of the total lipid has been hydrolyzed, is followed by a period of slower, nearly constant hydrolysis.
      <br/>
      In a unilamellar liposome, only the outermost layer is initially accessible to enzyme.
      <br/>
      The rapid initial hydrolysis rate of 0.88 s-1 reflects the hydrolysis of lipids in the other monolayer.
      <br/>
      The onset of the subsequent slower hydrolysis stage is caused by substrate depletion in the outer monolayer.
      <br/>
      Hydrolysis proceeds to completion at about 0.044 s-1, limited by access to new substrate either from the bursting of partially hydrolyzed vesicles or from slow phospholipid flip-flop between the inner and outer vesicle monolayers.
    </p>
    <p num="142">
      The progress of tubule hydrolysis is markedly different.
      <br/>
      After a 120 minute lag, the hydrolysis proceeds with a slow, nearly constant rate of 0.041 s-1 for most of the reaction.
      <br/>
      The rate of hydrolysis of tubules after the initial lag is 20 times slower that for the outermost DPPC vesicle monolayer, and, in contrast to all other reported PLA2 reaction profiles, it remains constant after the initial lag until nearly 100% hydrolysis.
      <br/>
      This constant hydrolysis rate is consistent with end-dominated tubule hydrolysis.
    </p>
    <p num="143">
      However, the microstructures observed by TEM reflect a more complex process.
      <br/>
      Shortly after addition of enzyme, helical ribbons emerging from what appear to be fractured tubules are visible.
      <br/>
      Even though a few intact tubules are still present at the 50% hydrolysis point, the types of microstructures present include small filaments, helical ribbons, and elongated sheets.
      <br/>
      Tubules appear to remain intact until certain fraction of reaction products is reached within a local region of the tubule bilayer.
      <br/>
      The point when product accumulation can no longer support the specific asymmetric curvature required to form a one micrometer diameter tubule, the product regions fracture and unwrap to form smaller helices, filaments and flat sheets.

      Moreover, fluorescent dye studies have been completed, wherein the cationic fluorescent dye 1,1,3,3,3',3'-hexamethyl-indocarbocyanine iodide was added to visualize the region of negative charge accumulation.
      <br/>
      Early in the reaction, fluorescent regions appear at several points along intact tubules.
      <br/>
      Hydrolysis, therefore is not limited to tubule ends.
      <br/>
      Instead, local defects in molecular packing within the bilayer appear to function as initiation sites for hydrolysis.
    </p>
    <p num="145">
      Fluorescent PLA2 also has been used to track reaction progress. 5-carboxyfluorescein-tagged PLA2 was used.
      <br/>
      Immediately after addition, enzyme appears to distribute uniformly over the tubule surface.
      <br/>
      By the completion of hydrolysis, the product microstructures show strong fluorescence, which implies enhanced PLA2 binding to product-risk microstructures.
    </p>
    <p num="146">
      Although enzyme reaction with tubules is not limited to reaction at the end of tubules, the reaction progress nevertheless is still more constant and slower than that of SUVs.
      <br/>
      This makes the tubules attractive drug delivery agents.

      2. Detergent Dissolution Kinetics Bile salts occuring naturally in humans act similarly to detergents.
      <br/>
      Thus, the kinetics of HAR microstructure dissolution in detergents is; a good model for the oral administration of therapeutics and vaccines for delivery to the gastrointestinal tract.
      <br/>
      The kinetics of dissolution in detergent solutions has been investigated.
      <br/>
      The commercially-available tubule-forming phospholipid 1,2-bis(10,12-tricosadiynoyl)-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DC8,9 PC) and the non-ionic detergent octyl  BETA -D-glucoside (OG) were used as the model system.
      <br/>
      Upon precipitation from ethanol, DC8,9 PC forms multi-lamellar tubules with an average diameter of 0.75  MU m, a length distribution ranging from 30-50  MU m, and a melting temperature (Tm) of 43.8 (degree)  C. The tubule morphology is composed of helically-wrapped lipid bilayers that close to form straight, hollow, rigid tubes.
      <br/>
      Tubules can appear, however, in the presence of minority structures such as open helical ribbons.
      <br/>
      If given time to anneal, the lipids form closed and uniform tubules.
      <br/>
      Presumably, the tight crystalline packing of the tubule wall will hinder release of monomeric lipid from the microstructure and insertion of detergent into the tubule except at regions of defects in the crystalline packing such as must occur at tubule ends c)r at "helical" defects.
    </p>
    <p num="148">
      FIG. 9 shows the concentration of DC8,9 PC solubilized into OG detergent micelles as a function of time.
      <br/>
      To start solubilization, an aqueous suspension of DC8,9 PC tubules was added to an aqueous suspension of OG detergent micelles to create a final solution having a 0.5 mM concentration of DC8,9 PC and a 50 mM concentration of OG.
      <br/>
      The reaction vessel was at room temperature (approximately 21 (degree)  C.).
      <br/>
      Tubule microstructures were much larger than detergent micelles so a 0.2  MU m filter was used to separate the two phases prior to analysis.
      <br/>
      DC8,9 PC absorbs strongly from 190 to 254 nm because of the diacetylene groups present in the hydrocarbon tails.
      <br/>
      The amount of micellar DC8,9 PC was determined with a UV-Vis spectrometer by calculating the second derivative of the optical density with respect to wavelength at 250 nm, which was a mathematical step that reduced errors introduced from scattering artifacts.
      <br/>
      The concentration could be determined by comparing this value to those obtained from a calibration curve.
      <br/>
      Throughout the course of solubilization, aliquots of the suspension were removed, passed through a 0.2  MU m filter, and assayed for the amount of solubilized DC8,9 PC.
      <br/>
      FIG. 10 shows the mole fraction of DC8,9 PC remaining within a tubule as a function of time and depicts the nature of the solubilization process.
      <br/>
      The logarithm of the DC8,9 PC tubule concentration depends linearly with time, which suggests that tubule disintegration is a first order process.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, changes in solution turbidity, as determined by measuring the optical density at 400 nm, correlates well (e.g. linearly) with the amount of DC8,9 PC within the tubule.
    </p>
    <p num="149">
      Multilamellar PC tubules, L, interact with detergent, OG, to form mixed micelles, M. If, however, the effective concentration of detergent that is available for solubilization does not change throughout the course of the reaction (e.g. detergent is not consumed by the reaction, mixed micelles can contain many phospholipids, etc.), then the kinetics can be described as a first order process.
      <br/>
      If this view is correct, then the effective rate constant, k1, should depend linearly on the concentration of detergent (e.g. k1 =k2 �OG�).
      <br/>
      FIG. 11 shows the time course of solubilization as a function of OG concentration.
      <br/>
      An estimate for the value for the second order rate constant, k2, can be determined from the slope of the line created when the measured first-order rate constant k1, is plotted against detergent concentration.

      k2 =0.124.+- 0 (slashed zero) 012 mol-1 s-1

      Temperature strongly affects the rate of HAR solubilization.
      <br/>
      FIG. 12 shows the concentration of DC8,9 PC within a tubule as a function of time as determined from measuring the O.D. at 400 nm. A solution containing a 100-fold molar excess of OG (40 mM) was added to a stirred quartz cuvette and placed in a temperature-controlled UV-Vis spectrometer.
      <br/>
      Once the detergent suspension had reached thermal equilibrium, an aqueous suspension of DC89 PC tubules (0.4 mM) was quickly added.
      <br/>
      The temperature dependence of the rate of tubule solubilization was determined by measuring the decrease in turbidity (e.g. changes in O.D.) with time.
      <br/>
      As shown in FIG. 15, the kinetics of solubilization were strongly temperature dependent and first order.
      <br/>
      FIG. 13 is an Ahhrenius plot of the solubilization rate constant that shows the energy barrier to solubilization is high, Eact =460 kJ mole-1.
    </p>
    <p num="151">
      The microstructural form into which phospholipids self-assembly does not appear to influence the kinetics of detergent solubilization.
      <br/>
      Egg PC vesices also show first order kinetics (Mimms, et al., 1981).
      <br/>
      The rates are very sensitive to the aggregation "state" of the phospholipid, and under these circumstances the right crystalline packing in tubules may be advantageous for slow solubilization of the drug by bile salts and other biological detergents.

    <p num="152">VI. Administering the Composite Compounds</p>
    <p num="153">
      HAR microstructures are used for the continuous administration of ligands to organisms, including both plants and animals, particularly mammals such as humans.
      <br/>
      HAR microstructure-based continuous release can be used for administering therapeutics, for example and without limitation, topically, orally, intramuscularly, intranasally, subcutaneously, intraperitoneally, intralesionally, intravenously, or any other administration means now known or hereafter developed that allows for the compounds to remain in HAR microstructures.
      <br/>
      Moreover, the safety and comfort of the patient also must be considered.
      <br/>
      Larger diameter HAR microstructues (about 1  MU m diameter) may be too large for injecting into the circulatory system because of the potential to clog capillaries.
      <br/>
      All other internal and external sites of drug delivery are possible, however, for those HAR microstructures having diameters greater than about 1  MU m. And, for HAR microstructures having diameters less than about 1  MU m, injection into the circulatory system can be used to administer the therapeutic/HARM complexes.
    </p>
    <p num="154">
      Moreover, most of the tubule mass is :n the wall.
      <br/>
      This means that there is a large "wasted" central lumen in the tubules, which reduces the possible drug loading.
      <br/>
      Multi-bilayer tubules or cochleate cylinders thus are well suited for circumstances where high drug loading is necessary.
      <br/>
      Smaller and more flexible tubules and cochleate cylinders have less wasted space and also may be small enough to pass through the capillary beds.
      <br/>
      HAR-microstructure-based therapeutic delivery systems can provide controlled release in topical or subcutaneous applications.
      <br/>
      The relatively long length of some of the microstructures immobilizes them without using a rigid polymeric matrix.
      <br/>
      HAR microstructures also can be used in mucosal and oral delivery.
      <br/>
      The tight packing of the lipid molecules in the HAR microstructure could afford protection of certain drugs such as peptides from the premature enzymatic hydrolysis that now plagues peptide delivery systems as has been shown for calcium-induced cochleate cylinders.
      <br/>
      While there are often ample concentrations of proteolytic and lipolytic enzymes present in the interstitial fluid in vivo, these enzymes are often inhibited to prevent uncontrolled cell damage.
      <br/>
      To ensure that the therapeutic will be enzymatically released from the HAR microstructures in an extracorporeal site, such as in topical applications or in vitro, HAR microstructures can be co-suspended with hydrolytic enzymes.
    </p>
    <p num="155">
      While there is nothing inherently antigenic about a lipid HAR microstructure, subcutaneous injection of some drug-coated HAR microstructures might be used to induce an inflammatory response, as demonstrated by the adherence of some cells to DC8,9 PC cylinders.
      <br/>
      The cellular environment in the presence of such a response provides ample proteolytic enzymes to cleave prodrugs from the HAR microstructure surfaces, which could be an advantage.
      <br/>
      Some vaccination protocols require repeated dosing with vaccines because a single bolus dose does not raise an adequate immune response.
      <br/>
      HAR microstructures placed in subcutaneous sites could act as long-acting vaccines that deliver antigen long enough to create a strong immune response.
      <br/>
      Because the rate of degradation of lipidated drugs depends on whether the surfactant morphologies are HAR microstructures or liposomes, raising the local temperature above Tm, which converts the HAR microstructures to liposomes, provides a method for greatly increasing the delivery rate from implanted microstructures on demand.
    </p>
    <p num="156">
      Even if in vivo use of HAR microstructures is restricted for some reason, continuous therapeutic release using HAR microstructure is still important in such in vitro applications where delivery of some chemical is required over a long period of time at a constant rate.
      <br/>
      A biotechnologically important example is the delivery of growth factors or antibiotics to cells being cultured in containers too small to merit continuous infusion of such factors.
    </p>
    <p num="157">
      In order to provide steady, continuous therapeutic release, the rate of dissolution or enzymatic cleavage of the therapeutic from the HAR microstructures must be relatively constant.
      <br/>
      This steady, continuous therapeutic release has been confirmed using a variety of methods.
    </p>

      Protein encoding plasmids, such as the green fluorescent protein encoding plasmid pEGFP--N1 and the breast cancer endocing plasmid pcDNA3HumHer2 Neu(pCXI), can be incorporated into HARMs such as (Pro)3 -Glu(NHC16 H33)2 and (Pro)3 -Glu (NHC12 H25)2 HARMs.

      Optical microscopy revealed HARMs with approximately the same morphology after overnight co-incubation of DNA and (Pro)3-Glu(NHC16 H33)2 in the presence of 40 mM OG regardless of the lipopeptide/DNA ratio.
      <br/>
      No particles were detected in the samples that lacked either lipopeptide or DNA.
      <br/>
      Observed differences in the appearance of samples with and without DNA suggests that DNA interacts with the (Pro)3 -Glu (NHC16 H33)2, which results in the precipitation of a DNA/(Pro)3 -Glu (NHC16 H33)2 complex.

      <br/>
      OG removal does not change the morphology of DNA/(Pro)3 -Glu (NHC16 H33)2 complexes, but does induce formation of amorphous aggregates in the sample containing (Pro)3 -Glu (NHC1 6H33)2 without DNA.

Most of the DNA from the sample containing both DNA and the lipopeptide sediments upon centrifugation.
      <br/>
      Apparent sedimentation of the control DNA was very low and determined to be non-specific adsorption on the test tube walls.
      <br/>
      A260 values of all fractions obtained from the (Pro)3 -Glu (NHC16 H33)2 or lipopeptide (1) sample containing no DNA were negligible, demonstrating that the presence of (Pro)3 -Glu (NHC16 H33)2 or lipopeptide (1) does not interfere with estimation of DNA concentrations.

      See, FIG. 16, where: sample "A" was 200  MU g/ml DNA, no lipopeptide; sample "B" was 200  MU g/ml DNA, 0.4 mM (Pro3)-Glu(C16 H33)2 ; and sample "C" was 0.4 mM (Pro3)-Glu(C16 H33)2. FIG. 17 presents data from a control experiment and demonstrates that the DNase used for this example was active.
      <br/>
      Negligible A260 in all fractions obtained from the lipopeptide sample containing no DNA (sample 3, FIG. 16) shows that possible adsorption of the DNase to the HARMS does not contribute to A260, and hence does not effect estimating DNA concentration.
      <br/>
      Individual nucleotides apparently cannot form stable complexes with the lipopeptide.
      <br/>
      Hence, FIG. 16 shows that incorporating DNA, into lipopeptide complexes protects the DNA against enzymatic degradation.

    </p>
    <p num="283">
      As shown by Table 6, the supernatants obtained after centrifugation of pCX1/(Pro)3 -Glu (NHC12 H25)2 and pCX1/(Pro)3 -Glu (NHC16 H33)2 complexes have very low DNA concentrations.
      <br/>
      This indicates that DNA was incorporated into the lipopeptide complexes in both cases with close to 100% efficiency.
      <br/>
      However, the concentration of DNA in the pCX1/(Pro)3 -Glu(NHC12 H25)2 preparation itself was slightly lower than 0.9 mg/ml (100% yield), which may reflect some loss during sample handling (using a syringe) rather than the efficiency of incorporation.
      <br/>
      Such a loss is easy to explain by the relatively large size of the complexes (see, for example, FIG. 20).
      <br/>
      Still, the data show that the loss in syringes is minimal, suggesting that the preparations may be administered to animals with acceptable accuracy.
    </p>
    <p num="284">
      To confirm that the produced pCX1/lipopeptides formed HARMs, TEM images of samples were obtained.
      <br/>
      Aliquots of each sample (20  MU l) were applied to Formvar-coated 150 mesh copper TEM sample grids.
      <br/>
      No stain was used.
      <br/>
      Samples were dried in air for at least 24 hours before observation with a Phillips EM 410 transmission electron microscope.
      <br/>
      As shown in FIG. 20, HARMs were observed in pCX1/glutamic acid dialkyl amide complexes.
      <br/>
      Lipopeptides prepared in the absence of pCX1 also were examined with TEM.
      <br/>
      Interestingly, (Pro)3 -Glu(NHC12 H25)2 formed HARMs with lower yield and different. morphology from pCX1/lipopeptide complexes, while (Pro)3 -Glu(NHC16 H33)2 formed no HARMs.
    </p>
    <p num="285">EXAMPLE 24</p>
    <p num="286">
      This example concerns the generation of a humoral immune response against HER-2/neu in HER2 transgenic mice injected with the pCX1/lipopeptides described in Example 23.
      <br/>
      HER2 transgenic mice, FVB/N-TgN(MMTVneu) 202 (Jackson Lab, Bartlaubou, Me.), carry the non-transforming rat neu gene on an MMTV (mouse mammary tumor virus) promotor.
      <br/>
      Mice with this gene develop breast cancer, histologically similar to human breast cancer, 100-200 days after birth.
      <br/>
      This breast cancer in the transgenic mice is mediated by rat neu overexpression.
      <br/>
      Thus, HER2 is a nonmutated tumor antigen in these animals.
      <br/>
      The ability to immunize animals to HER2 should demonstrate the ability to immunize patients whose tumors overexpress HER2.
    </p>
    <p num="287">
      HER2 transgenic mice were immunized (8-12 wks) with preparations (described in Example 23) containing 45 Ag of pCX1/lipopeptides, pCX1 alone or (Pro)3 -Glu(NHC12 H25)2 alone, in 50  MU l of HBS.
      <br/>
      Injections were administered intermuscularly (IM) or interdermally (ID).
      <br/>
      Immunized mice were sacrificed 30-days post injection and their sera were analyzed by ELISA for the presence of antibodies against HER2.
      <br/>
      Indirect ELISA was performed in 96-well plates, Immuon 4 (DynexTech, Chanthy, Va.).
      <br/>
      The wells were coated with recombinant human HER2 protein (Corixa, Seattle, Wash.) overnight at room temperature.
      <br/>
      Carbonate buffer (50 mM Na-carbonate pH 9.5) containing no protein was used as a control.
      <br/>
      After blocking with PBS-20 mM Na-phosphate, 140 mM NaCl pH 7.4 and washing with PBS 10/050 Tween 1% BSA for one hour, the mouse sera were added at dilutions of 1:100, 1:200, 1:400, and 1:800.
      <br/>
      The plates were incubated for one hour at room temperature and washed with PBS/0.50 Tween. The secondary antibody goat-anti-mouse-IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Zymed, San Francisco, Calif.) diluted 1:5000 in PBS/0.5% Tween was added to the wells, incubated for 45 minutes at room temperature, then washed three times with PBS/0.5% Tween. TMB developing reagent (Kirkeyaard and Perry Laboratories, Gaithersburg, Md.) was added.
    </p>
    <p num="288">
      After the wells developed colors (5-10 min at room temperature), OD values were read at 450 nm.
      <br/>
      As shown in FIG. 21, mice immunized with either of the two pCX1/lipopeptides, administered either IM or ID, generated a significant humoral immune response.
      <br/>
      This is indicated by the significant generation of antibodies against HER2.
      <br/>
      In contrast, neither the plasmid (pCX1) nor the lipoprotein alone generated an immune response.
    </p>
    <p num="289">
      Therefore, the pCX1 plasmid alone cannot generate a significant immune response against HER2, if only administered once.
      <br/>
      This could be due to the short survival time of the plasmid in vivo, since it was not protected from nucleases.
      <br/>
      In addition, the lipopeptide itself was also unable to generate specific immune response.
      <br/>
      This is advantageous since it would be detrimental to a patient if they developed an immune response to the lipopeptide.
      <br/>
      Importantly, this data demonstrates that an immune response can be generated to the HER2 protein if the pCX1 plasmid is administered as coupled to or associated with HARMs.
      <br/>
      The HARMs protect the DNA from degradation by nucleases, thus allowing for expression of the DNA for a long enough period to generate an immune response.
