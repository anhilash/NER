      A method is provided for reducing contact resistances in semiconductors.
      <br/>
      In the use of fluorocarbon plasmas during high selectively sub-quarter-micron contact hole etching, with the silicon dioxide(SiO2)/silicon nitride(Si3N4)/silicide(TiSix) layers, polymerization effects have been discovered to be crucial.
      <br/>
      The process includes using a high etch selective chemistry, to remove SiO2 first, then switching to another chemistry with high selectivity of Si3N4-to-TiSix.
      <br/>
      To obtain good etch selectivity of SiO2-to-Si3N4, fluorocarbon plasmas containing high C/F ratio are employed.
      <br/>
      This results in the formation of reactive unsaturated polymers which stick easily to contact hole sidewalls and bottoms.
      <br/>
      Fluorine from the polymer was discovered to severely degrade the etch selectivity of Si3N4-to-TiSix.
      <br/>
      Different polymer removing methods to restore etch selectivity of Si3N4-to-TiSix are provided which can be applied to any highly selective etching of oxide versus nitride.

    <heading>TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
    <p num="1">The present invention relates generally to formation of contact holes and vias in the manufacture of semiconductor and more particularly to reducing contact resistance while forming the contact holes and vias.</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">
      In the fabrication of integrated circuits, polysilicon gates are deposited on silicon substrates and source/drain junctions implanted into the silicon substrates to form the transistors.
      <br/>
      Various interlayer dielectric materials are deposited on the gates and junctions for the formation of various layers of metal interconnections.
      <br/>
      Then various etching steps are used to form holes through the interlayer dielectric materials into which conductive materials will be deposited to form the contacts and interconnections of the integrated circuits.
    </p>
    <p num="3">
      The etching steps need to take place in a highly selective fashion with respect to the underlying layer, i.e., the etch for a layer should remove that layer relatively quickly while not removing or very slowly removing the underlying layer.
      <br/>
      To obtain good etch selectivity, fluorocarbon plasmas containing high carbon to fluorine (C/F) ratios are usually employed.
    </p>
    <p num="4">Unfortunately, polymerization readily occurs in chemistries having high C/F ratios.</p>
    <p num="5">
      This tends to generate quantities of polymers that are not easily removed.
      <br/>
      Even the ion bombardment is insufficient to remove the polymers.
      <br/>
      The mechanism for obtaining high etch selectivity is the difference in formation of polymers on different materials.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      For example, with a silicon dioxide (SiO2) dielectric layer and a silicon nitride (Si3 N4) etch stop layer, a dual-frequency driven plasma source may be used for the contact etch process because it can achieve high etch selectivity of SiO2 -to-Si3 N4.
      <br/>
      The plasma contains a high C/F ratio which creates reactive unsaturated polymers which can stick easily to contact hole sidewall and bottom and, then, create thick polymer layers.
      <br/>
      Once the SiO2 dielectric layer is cleared over the Si3 N4 stop layer, and oxygen is no longer being brought into the local environment from the SiO2 etch process, the polymer tends to accumulate at a significant rate.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      In SiO2 etch, using Cx Fy as etchant, free fluorine is made responsible for the etch, forming SiF in the reaction with silicon.
      <br/>
      CF and CF2 are precursors for the formation of the fluorocarbon polymers.
      <br/>
      This fluorocarbon layer deposition is reduced on oxide surfaces by the reaction between the oxygen released by dissociation during SiO2 etching and the carbon in the deposited polymer.
      <br/>
      Volatile compounds such as CO, CO2 or COF2 are formed during the etch.
      <br/>
      On non-oxide surfaces (or Si3 N4 surface) polymer layers should be formed, protecting the surface from free fluorine.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      However, a potential drawback of leaving a thick polymer layer over Si3 N4 is to lower the etch selectivity of Si3 N4 -to-silicide (TiSix).
      <br/>
      The silicide is formed on the polysilicon gate to provide low contact resistance bonding to the conductive contact metals.
      <br/>
      Fluorine from the deposited polymer can reduce, substantially, the etch selectivity of Si3 N4 -to-TiSix on fully processed wafers.
      <br/>
      This can cause open or high contact resistances.
    </p>
    <p num="9">A method for increasing the etch selectivity and the process window for etching semiconductor contacts has been long sought, but has long eluded those skilled in the art.</p>
    <heading>DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="10">
      The polymerization effects in fluorocarbon plasmas during high selectively sub-quarter-micron contact hole etching create thick polymer layers.
      <br/>
      It has been discovered that these thick polymer layers, formed during the dielectric removal step, reduce the etch selectivity to various underlayer dielectric layers, and which could increase contact resistance.
      <br/>
      The present invention provides for removal of the polymer after dielectric etch prior to the etch step for the next underlying layer to improve the etch selectivity and reduce the contact resistance.
    </p>
    <p num="11">
      The polymerization effects in high C/F ratio fluorocarbon plasmas during high selectively sub-quarter-micron contact hole etching of silicon dioxide layer create thick polymer layers.
      <br/>
      It has been discovered that these thick polymer layers reduce the etch selectivity of the etching of silicon dioxide to nitride layers, and possibly nitride to silicide layers as well, and it results in contact resistance increase.
      <br/>
      The present invention provides for removal of the polymer after silicon dioxide etch prior to the etch step for the next underlying layer to improve the etch selectivity and reduce the contact resistance.

      This polymerization effect is even more important when the technology goes to sub-quarter-micron because of the thinner underlying layers of silicon dioxide layers, such as nitride etch stop and silicide layers.

    <heading>BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="27">
      Referring now to FIG. 1, therein is shown a partial close-up section of a portion of a semiconductor wafer (not shown) with a semiconductor device 10 on a semiconductor substrate 12 having a gate oxide 14 and a polysilicon gate 16 formed thereon.
      <br/>
      The polysilicon gate 16 has a silicide layer 20 formed on top and a sidewall spacer 18 is formed around it.
    </p>
    <p num="28">
      An etch stop or nitride layer 22 is deposited over the silicon substrate 12, the spacer 18, and the silicide layer 20.
      <br/>
      Above the nitride layer 22 is a conformal dielectric or oxide layer 24 that roughly parallels the shape of the polysilicon gate 16.
      <br/>
      The oxide layer 24 is deposited by HDP (High Density Plasma) source.
      <br/>
      A planar interlayer dielectric or PSG oxide layer 26 is deposited on the oxide layer 24.
    </p>
    <p num="29">
      A photoresist 28 is deposited on the oxide layer 26.
      <br/>
      During processing, the photoresist 28 is photolithographically exposed and developed to form the hole 32.
    </p>
    <p num="30">
      During the semiconductor manufacturing process, the photoresist 28 is subject to a plasma etch and plasma is directed through the opening 32 to etch the holes 34, 36, and 38.
      <br/>
      The hole 38 has a bottom 40, which is shown slightly etched into the nitride layer 22 as will later be explained.
      <br/>
      It would be understood by those skilled in the art that the term "hole" refers to the contact hole from an interconnect to the transistor while the term "via" encompasses holes and connections between different levels of interconnect.
      <br/>
      While etching the holes, a polymer layer 30 forms over the sides of the holes 34, 36, and 38 and the bottom 40 of the hole 38 (for simplicity, the polymer layer 30 is shown only where it is the thickest).
    </p>
    <p num="31">
      In the preferred embodiment, the silicide layer 20 is titanium silicide (TiSix), the oxide layers 24 and 26 are of silicon dioxide (SiO2), and the nitride layer 22 is of silicon nitride (Si3 N4).
      <br/>
      A plasma with a gas mixture of C4 F8 /CF4 /CO/Ar is used for the SiO2 etch chemistry and selective gas mixture of CHF3 /O2 for the Si3 N4 etch chemistry.
      <br/>
      When a conductive metal fills the contact holes, the contact resistance will be high if the Si3 N4 is not etched away and the metal is not in contact with the TiSix.
      <br/>
      Similarly, if the TiSix is etched away and the metal is in contact with the polysilicon of the gate 16, the contact resistance will be high.
      <br/>
      The time between the etching away of the Si3 N4 and the etching away of the TiSix is called the "process time window" and is the period during which the contact resistance will be low for all the gate and diffusion contacts.
      <br/>
      A long process time window, generally measured in seconds, is highly desirable to increase process tolerances.

      High-density plasma etching employing fluorocarbon gases has been reported to have difficulty obtaining a high SiO2 -to-Si3 N4 etching selectivity.
      <br/>
      This problem is considered to be caused mainly by the increase in fluorine atom density relative to fluorocarbon radical densities in the plasma.
      <br/>
      A fluorocarbon plasma containing high C/F ratio is usually employed to obtain good etch selectivity of SiO2 -to-Si3 N4.
      <br/>
      Unfortunately, polymerization readily occurs in chemistries having high C/F ratios.
      <br/>
      Scanning electron microscope (SEM) analysis of semiconductor wafers revealed the formation of highly reactive, unsaturated polymers represented by the polymer layer 30 shown in FIGS. 1 through 4.
      <br/>
      This polymer layer 30 effects the selectivity of the SiO2 such that the plasma etch to the diffusion contact 62 in FIG. 3 which is at the center of the wafer will stop exactly at the etch stop layer 22.
      <br/>
      However, the etch stop layer 22 will be progressively penetrated for etching of holes at the edge of the wafer, such as shown in FIGS. 4 and 1, and will be the worst for the etch to the gate 46 at the edge of the wafer.
      <br/>
      The process time window will be shortened because the following nitride etch would penetrate the thin nitride layer 22 of FIG. 2 and etch the silicide layer 20 over the gate 46 almost before the nitride etch would penetrate the fill nitride layer 22 of FIG. 3 over the diffusion contact 62.
      <br/>
      This would cause a high number of open or high contact resistance transistors.
    </p>
    <p num="64">
      A number of experiments were performed.
      <br/>
      Initially, 165 seconds of SiO2 etch, including 50% over etch, and a selective Si3 N4 etch of CHF3 /O2 with different etch time splits were used.
      <br/>
      Process conditions of the Si3 N4 etch were as follows: top power was 200 watts, bottom power was 100 watts, and chamber pressure was 60 mTorr.
      <br/>
      Chamber temperature was unchanged from the previous process step likewise clamping and backside helium cooling conditions were unchanged.
      <br/>
      Small amounts of oxygen are introduced in the fluorocarbon based plasmas during Si3 N4 etch since oxygen deficiency causes a fluorocarbon layer (not shown) to form on the Si3 N4 surface that inhibits the active species, fluorine atoms, from reaching this surface.
      <br/>
      This causes the etch rate to slow down, and sometimes an etch stop phenomenon to occur.
      <br/>
      Oxygen gas is used to suppress the formation of the fluorocarbon layer, resulting in a constant Si3 N4 etch rate.
    </p>
    <p num="65">
      The results showed a rather limited process time window of Si3 N4 etch where good, low contact resistances could be obtained for the polysilicon gates 16 and 46 and the diffusion contacts 62 and 92, simultaneously.
      <br/>
      Specifically, the process time window increased from 25 to 50 seconds.
      <br/>
      Thus, the process time window for plasma etching was 25 seconds.
      <br/>
      The viable process time window was also affected by SiO2 etch time.
    </p>
    <p num="66">
      Tests run at 180 seconds showed zero process time window of Si3 N4 etch in which the contact resistances were simultaneously low.
      <br/>
      There were some sites on the wafers that exhibited "conductive" resistances after 10 seconds of Si3 N4 etch, although the resistances were high.
      <br/>
      Where 1200 kohm is defined as the contact "open", this phenomenon showed most of the polysilicon gate contacts had good resistances, 100-150 kohms, after 10 seconds of Si3 N4 etch.
    </p>
    <p num="67">
      Efforts of understanding the differences between 165 and 180 second conditions and the extremely fast Si3 N4 etch rates inside the contact holes were carried by comparing the SEM micrographs of two processed wafers.
      <br/>
      The Si3 N4 layer lost around 300  Angstrom  over the polysilicon gate on both wafers, however, the process windows between these two wafers are unexpectedly different.
    </p>
    <p num="68">
      In trying to determine the reason for the differences between 165 seconds and 180 seconds of SiO2 etch, it was theorized that the deposited polymer is thicker after 180 seconds SiO2 etch and that the polymer 30 was a factor.
      <br/>
      It was speculated that, during the Si3 N4 etch step, fluorine might be released from the thicker polymer and might act as an additional etchant for the Si3 N4 layer 22.
      <br/>
      This additional fluorine source could enhance, significantly, the etch rate.
    </p>
    <p num="69">
      It was estimated that the Si3 N4 etch rate is 2400  Angstrom /min inside the contact hole.
      <br/>
      Nevertheless, the etch rate of Si3 N4 by itself is only 1000  Angstrom /min measured from the wafer (contact-mask-patterned single-Si3 N4 -film test wafer).
      <br/>
      A similar test was performed on other wafers to verify the polymerization effects.
      <br/>
      The test wafers were etched for 36 seconds of SiO2 etch followed by 40 seconds of Si3 N4 etch.
      <br/>
      The Si3 N4 etch rate was, therefore, measured being 1350  Angstrom /min, and which is larger than the 1000  Angstrom /min obtained by using only Si3 N4 etch step.
      <br/>
      Hence, the presence of fluorocarbon polymer could violate the designed etch formula, and be responsible for unexpected etch results.
    </p>
    <p num="70">
      The polymer 30, left by the SiO2 etch, acting as an effective fluorine source was verified by testing an in-situ removal using the fluorine-less Ar/O2 plasma with a limited lower electrode power as shown in FIGS. 5 through 8.
      <br/>
      Extra Si3 N4 layer loss was evident over polysilicon gate and diffusion contact regions across the wafer, especially the Si3 N4 layer 22 over the polysilicon gate 46 at the edge of the wafer tended to be punched through to the TiSix, as shown in FIG. 6.
      <br/>
      Since there was no fluorine source from the input gasses, this supported the theory of the polymer 30 as a detrimental fluorine source.
    </p>
    <p num="71">
      In order to test the process time window of the Si3 N4 etch in the absence of the polymer it was necessary to remove the polymer, after SiO2 etch, in an environment that would not etch the underlying Si3 N4.
      <br/>
      A 30 seconds ash process in a microwave stripper using water vapor as the ashing agent accomplished this removal.
      <br/>
      Process conditions were as follows: power 1 KW, paddle temperature 250 (degree)  C., and water vapor flow 300 sccm.
      <br/>
      As shown in FIGS. 9 through 12, the ashing process did not attack the Si3 N4.
    </p>
    <p num="72">
      Further and most important, the contact resistance data indicates the process time window yielding good contact resistance in all contacts is increased from 70 to 110 seconds.
      <br/>
      This expands the usable process time from a window of 25 seconds to a window of 40 seconds increasing breadth of the window by 60%.
      <br/>
      The impact of this process as it interacts with the etch time is expected to be favorable as well.
    </p>
    <p num="73">
      For the present invention, a conventional dual-frequency plasma reactor is used, but with excitation frequencies of 27 and 2 MHz applied to the upper and lower powered electrodes, respectively.
      <br/>
      The 27 MHz is used to generate higher density plasmas than achieved with the conventional 13.56 MHz, and the 2 MHz is used to enhance the ion bombardment energy.
      <br/>
      The wafer backside helium pressure is 15 Torr, and the process chamber wall and electrostatic chuck temperatures are both 40 (degree)  C.
    </p>
    <p num="74">
      The SiO2 etch step was optimized to give a good selectivity of SiO2 -to-Si3 N4.
      <br/>
      Generally, the ratio of C/F in the etch gas has always been taken as a measure for the etch selectivity.
      <br/>
      A gas mixture of C4 F8 /CF4 /CO/Ar was used for the SiO2 etch chemistry of the present invention.
      <br/>
      The selectivity dependence on the ratio of C4 F8 /CF4 was studied for a 60 mTorr, top RF power was 800 watt, and Ar flow was 300 sccm process.
      <br/>
      A ratio of C4 F8 CF4 =0.85 provided sufficient SiO2 -to-Si3 N4 selectivity to allow the SiO2 to be etched while leaving a majority of the Si3 N4 layer thickness behind even over the polysilicon gates at the edge of the wafer.
    </p>
    <p num="75">
      The main decomposition path of C4 F8 is C4 F8 -C2 F4 -CF2 -CF+F, and CF is the polymer forming precursor.
      <br/>
      The increase of C4 F8 gas flow effectively reduces the etch rate of the Si3 N4 etch stop layer in the contact hole resulting an increased selective ratio.
      <br/>
      However, it may eventually cause etch-stop.
      <br/>
      Thus, the balance of deposition and etching must be controlled precisely.
      <br/>
      The addition of CO is also used to improve the etch selectivity of SiO2 -to-Si3 N4 ; the free fluorine reacts with CO to form COF2.
      <br/>
      The SiO2 etch time was fixed to 165 seconds in order to minimize any deposition of polymer over the contact area, mainly the polysilicon gate contacts.
    </p>
    <p num="76">In an alternate mode, the polymer 30 can be removed by placing the wafer 100 on a hot plate and heating it to around 250 (degree)  C. in an ozone ambient just before the nitride etch.</p>
    <p num="77">In a further alternate mode, the polymer 30 can be removed using a downstream oxygen plasma at a radio frequency operating range.</p>
    <p num="78">In a still further alternate mode, the polymer 30 can be removed using microwave energy in a downstream oxygen plasma.</p>
    <p num="79">
      In various modes, the oxygen for the plasma is obtained by the disassociation of water so that hydrogen will be available to react with the fluorine released during the removal of the polymer 30.
      <br/>
      The fluorine reacts to form hydrogen fluoride, which is a gas which can be easily removed from the contact hole and the downstream plasma chamber.

    <p num="80">
      While the invention has been described in conjunction with a specific best mode, it is to be understood that many alternatives, modifications, and variations will be apparent to those skilled in the art in light of the aforegoing description.
      <br/>
      For example, high-density plasma sources operating at low-pressure regime, such as electron cyclotron resonance (ECR) and inductively coupled plasma (ICP) are alternative plasma sources because of their highly anisotropic etching with a high etching rate.
