      Field of the Invention
    </p>
    <p num="3">The present invention relates to an image processing system and a color image processing apparatus for processing image signals by encrypting the signals.</p>
    <p num="4">2. Related Arts</p>
    <p num="5">Recently, as the performance of color copying machines has been improved, crimes of forging documents, such as paper monies or securities, by using these copying machines illegally have increased in number.</p>
    <p num="6">
      To prevent such crimes, a system has been studied in which data of image patterns representing documents, such as paper monies and securities, are registered in a copying machine itself beforehand, and an image identifying circuit identifies these registered data, thereby forcibly inhibiting illegal copying in accordance with the identification result.
      <br/>
      However, since the number of registrable image patterns is limited in a forgery preventing circuit of this type, it is impossible to register all available documents, such as paper monies and securities.
    </p>
    <p num="7">In addition, in the case of a color copying machine separable into a reader unit and a printer unit, even when a document consistent with a registered image pattern is to be copied, the circuit of the above sort cannot function if the original reader unit is replaced with another reader unit.</p>
    <p num="8">
      Also, connecting an unsuitable apparatus to the copying machine, even though it is not an illegal use as described above, lowers the signal level due to impedance mismatch between the two apparatuses, resulting in an adverse influence, such as an increase in noise of an image signal.
      <br/>
      This may interfere with the operation of the color copying machine main body and consequently introduce disadvantages to users.
    </p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="9">It is an object of the present invention to provide an image processing apparatus or system capable of solving the above conventional problems.</p>
    <p num="10">It is a principal object of the present invention to provide an image processing apparatus or system capable of preventing, with an inexpensive arrangement, illegal uses which may be caused by connecting an image processing apparatus with an inadequate interface in performing transmission/reception of image signals between the image processing apparatuses, thereby eliminating adverse influences on the main image processing apparatus to introduce no disadvantages to users.</p>
    <p num="11">It is another object of the present invention to provide an encrypting method suitable for multivalued image data.</p>
    <p num="12">It is still another object of the present invention to provide an image processing apparatus for constituting the above image processing system.</p>
    <p num="13">It is still another object of the present invention to provide an interface or image processing system with a novel function.</p>
    <p num="14">In order to achieve the above objects, a preferred embodiment of the present invention discloses an image processing system in which an image processing apparatus on the transmission side comprises encrypting means for encrypting image signals, and an image processing apparatus on the reception side comprises decrypting means for decrypting encrypted signals, thereby performing encrypting for signals being transmitted.</p>

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
    <p num="17">A preferred embodiment of the present invention will be described in detail below with reference to the accompanying drawings.</p>
    <p num="18">1st Embodiment</p>
    <p num="19">
      FIG. 1 is a block diagram showing an image processing system according to the first embodiment of the present invention.
      <br/>
      Referring to FIG. 1, this system is separated into a color copying apparatus 5 incorporating a scanner unit 12 and a printer unit 13, and an external controller 4 as an interface for performing input/output of color images with respect to an external image processing apparatus.
      <br/>
      The color copying apparatus 5 may, of course, be constituted by a scanner and a printer independent of each other.
    </p>
    <p num="20">
      The color copying apparatus 5 and the external controller 4 are electrically connected to each other through a signal line for transmitting an image information signal 1 as color image data and a signal line for transmitting an encryption information signal 2 as information concerning encryption.
      <br/>
      The encryption information signal 2 is a signal for transmitting information concerning encryption as described above and is exchanged through a bidirectional signal line.
      <br/>
      When color image data is input from the scanner unit 12 of the color copying apparatus 5, the encryption information signal 2 is supplied from the color copying apparatus 5 to the external controller 4.
      <br/>
      The encrypted image information signal 1 is decrypted in accordance with the encryption information signal 2 by an encrypting circuit 21 and an image processing circuit 20 of the external controller 4.
      <br/>
      When color image data is output from the external controller 4 to the printer unit 13 of the color copying apparatus 5, the encryption information signal 2 is supplied from the external controller 4 to the color copying apparatus 5.
      <br/>
      The encrypted image information signal 1 is decrypted by an encrypting circuit 11 and an image processing circuit 10 of the color copying apparatus 5.
    </p>
    <p num="21">Note that image clocks, image sync signals, communication lines for performing condition control of the apparatus, and the like are omitted from FIG. 1.</p>
    <p num="22">
      The color copying apparatus 5 incorporates the encrypting circuit 11 for controlling the image processing circuit 10.
      <br/>
      The encrypting circuit 11 performs encryption in transmitting color image data to the external controller 4 and decryption upon receiving color image data from the external controller 4.
    </p>
    <p num="23">That is, in sending color image data read by the scanner unit 12 to the external controller 4, the encrypting circuit 11 generates data related to encryption to be supplied to the external controller 4.</p>
    <p num="24">When color image data is supplied from the external controller 4 to the printer unit 13, the encrypting circuit 11 generates data for decrypting the data from the external controller 4.</p>
    <p num="25">
      In the color copying apparatus 5, encryption is performed when color image data is to be supplied to the external controller 4, and decryption, which is the inverse process of encryption, is performed when color image data is supplied from the external controller 4 to the printer unit 13; these two modes are executed by a combination of the encrypting circuit 11 and the image processing circuit 10.
      <br/>
      There is another mode, a forgery preventing mode of the color copying apparatus itself.
      <br/>
      A configuration for this mode is incorporated in the image processing circuit 10.
      <br/>
      That is, a determining circuit is incorporated as a forgery preventing function to be executed when the printer unit 13 is to copy an image read by the scanner unit 12.
      <br/>
      If this determining circuit determines that copying is for forgery, the printer unit 13 is disabled to perform a copying operation.
    </p>
    <p num="26">
      The external controller 4 includes the encrypting circuit 21 and the image processing circuit 20, which performs decryption of the image information signal 1 directly or indirectly upon receiving the encryption information signal 2.
      <br/>
      When the external controller 4 is connected to a host computer, the image processing circuit 20 directly encrypts color image data supplied from the host computer.
      <br/>
      In this case, the image processing circuit executes the encryption by receiving an encrypting instruction from the encrypting circuit 21.
      <br/>
      The external controller 4 performs encryption in sending color image data to the color copying apparatus 5 and decryption upon receiving color image data from the color copying apparatus 5.
      <br/>
      These encryption and decryption are executed by a combination of the encrypting circuit 21 and the image processing circuit 20.
    </p>
    <p num="27">It should be noted that a plurality of types of encrypting methods are used in this embodiment.</p>
    <p num="28">The operation of this embodiment will be described in detail below.</p>
    <p num="29">FIG. 2 is a timing chart showing control timings for the image information signal 1, the encryption information signal 2, an image clock, and a sync signal.</p>

      According to the first embodiment as described above, a cryptogram understandable only between the external controller 4 and the color copying apparatus 5, which have the same specifications, is used.
      <br/>
      The use of this cryptogram can prevent replacement with an illegal external controller incapable of decrypting the cryptogram, for example, an external controller for forgery purposes.
      <br/>
      This can effectively make it very difficult for a third person to use the system for forgery purposes.
    </p>
    <p num="32">An operation related to forgery prevention will be described first.</p>
    <p num="33">
      FIG. 3 is a flow chart for explaining the operation of the color copying apparatus 5 according to the first embodiment.
      <br/>
      Note that the operation explained below is controlled entirely by a CPU (not shown) of the color copying apparatus 5.
    </p>
    <p num="34">In steps S10, S12, and S14, any of a copy instruction from a copy start key (not shown), a print instruction from the external controller 4, and an original read instruction from the external controller 4 is detected.</p>
    <p num="35">
      If the copy instruction is detected, the scanner unit 12 reads an original (step S16), and a determining circuit (not shown) executes forgery determination based on the color image data read from the original (step S18).
      <br/>
      If the determining circuit determines that the read image is an image, the copying of which is prohibited, the use of the printer unit 13 is inhibited (step S22).
      <br/>
      If the determining circuit determines that the image is not an object of copy prohibition, the read color image data of the original is transferred to the printer unit 13 and recorded on recording paper (step S24).
    </p>
    <p num="36">
      If the print instruction from the external controller 4 is detected in step S12, as shown in the timing chart of FIG. 2, the encryption information signal and the color image data are supplied and at the same time decryption is performed (steps S26 and S28).
      <br/>
      In the processing operations in steps S26 and S28, if the cryptogram input processing and the decryption cannot be performed normally, as when an encryption information signal of another specification is input to disable decryption, for example, when the number of digits of data concerning encryption is detected to be different from a predetermined number, the printer unit 13 prints out an abnormal image (step S34).
      <br/>
      On the other hand, when the encryption information signal input and the decrypting are performed normally, the color image data is acquired from the external controller 4 and recorded on a recording paper by the printer unit 13 (step S32).
    </p>
    <p num="37">Note that whether the cryptogram input processing and the decryption are performed normally may be detected by another method.</p>
    <p num="38">
      If the original read instruction from the external controller 4 is detected in step S14, the scanner unit 12 reads an original image (step S36), and an encryption information signal is formed.
      <br/>
      The encryption information signal and the color image data are output to the external controller 4, as shown in the timing chart of FIG. 2 (step S38).
    </p>
    <p num="39">
      When the external controller 4 performs decryption normally, the external controller 4 is allowed to send the color image data decryption normally to an external device, such as a host computer connected to the external controller 4; if not normally, the external device, such as a host computer, will receive unreproducible data.
      <br/>
      This eventually results in an inability to perform normal printing and hence in failing of forgery.
    </p>
    <p num="40">In the above operation, even if a user does not have a strict security as to the management of the color copying apparatus and the external controller so that no other third person is allowed to operate the apparatuses, forgery prevention can be realized satisfactorily without using the internal determining circuit of the color copying apparatus.</p>
    <p num="41">In particular, since the color copying apparatus 5 or the external controller 4 arbitrarily determines the type of encryption, the printer unit can be controlled to be inoperable even if the image processing circuit of the color copying apparatus 5 or the external controller 4 is replaced with another.</p>

    <p num="43">
      The above first embodiment employs a method using an encryption information signal and an image information signal which are independent of each other.

      In this embodiment, an external controller 34 as one apparatus comprises an encrypting circuit 51 and an image processing circuit 50, as in the first embodiment, while a color copying apparatus 35 as the other apparatus comprises an encrypting circuit 45, an image processing circuit 40, a scanner unit 42, and a printer unit 43.
      <br/>
      A composite image information signal 31 which is a combination of the encryption information signal 2 and the image information signal 1 described above with reference to FIG. 1 is exchanged between the image processing circuits 50 and 40.
    </p>
    <p num="48">Since the signals are combined in the external controller 34 and the color copying apparatus 35, the interconnection between the image processing circuit 10, the encrypting circuit 11, the image processing circuit 20, and the decrypting circuit (not shown) shown in FIG. 1 is altered to an interconnection between the image processing circuit 40, the encrypting circuit 45, the image processing circuit 50, and a decrypting circuit (not shown).</p>

      Referring to FIG. 5, in contrast to the timing chart of FIG. 2 explained above in the first embodiment, a pattern (1) or (2), i.e., information such as a number indicating the type of encryption and numerical information associated with synchronization are output during an effective period (period of level HIGH) of the sync signal, and an image information signal is output during an ineffective period (period of level LOW) of the sync signal, thereby performing decryption.
      <br/>
      In this manner, the image information signal and the encryption information signal can be transmitted together through a single signal line, so the number of signal lines is reduced.
    </p>
    <p num="51">
      In using the color copying apparatus 35 as an independent scanner or printer, the image processing circuit 40 and the encrypting circuit 45 operate in association with each other to mix the encryption information signal with the image information signal or to put the encryption pattern into the image, thereby outputting the composite image information signal to the external controller 34.
      <br/>
      When the image information signal (color image data) as a portion of the composite image information signal 31 is to be supplied from the scanner unit 42 to the external controller 34, the signal is sent from the color copying apparatus 35 to the external controller 34; when this portion is to be supplied to the printer unit 43, the signal is sent from the external controller 34 to the color copying apparatus 35.
      <br/>
      That is, bidirectional data transmission is performed.
      <br/>
      In the external controller 34, regardless of whether the color copying apparatus 35 is used as an independent scanner or printer, the image processing circuit 50 and the encrypting circuit 51 operate in association with each other to separate the encryption information signal, which is mixed in the composite image information signal 31 supplied from the color copying apparatus 35, from the composite image signal 31, thereby performing encryption and decryption.

    <p num="52">The overall operation of this embodiment is the same as that of the first embodiment described above with reference to FIG. 3 and a detailed description thereof will be omitted.</p>
    <p num="53">
      According to the second embodiment as described above, a composite information signal which is not easy to be separated or decrypted can be obtained by combining signals.

      FIG. 6 is a block diagram showing the circuit configuration of a main part of an image processing system according to the third embodiment.

      Referring to FIG. 6, a printer unit comprises a sync signal generating circuit 130, a random number generating circuit 131, a synchronous counter 132, and a first-in first-out memory (to be referred to as a "FIFO" hereinafter) 133.
      <br/>
      A controller unit comprises a synchronous counter 140 and a FIFO 141.

      Connections to the controller unit and the printer unit, each for use in the processing described above in the previous embodiments, an image processing unit for actually performing image processing in an image processing circuit, and a recording unit for actually performing recording in the printer unit are shown without reference numerals.
    </p>
    <p num="58">Also shown are a sync signal 150, an image information signal 151, and an encryption information signal 152.</p>
    <p num="59">The operation of the above arrangement will be described below.</p>

      The sync signal generating circuit 130 generates the sync signal 150 corresponding to the sync signal shown in FIG. 2.

      The random number generating circuit 131 randomly generates, in synchronism with the sync signal 150, a clock number by which an effective image information signal is sent after the sync signal becomes effective.
      <br/>
      For example, the random number generating circuit 131 generates an integer, such as a numeric value "10" or "15", in synchronism with the sync signal 150.
      <br/>
      This numeric value is information to be sent as the encryption information signal 152.

    <p num="61">
      The synchronous counter 140 temporarily stores color image data supplied from the image processing unit of the image processing circuit into the FIFO 141 and changes, in accordance with the encryption information signal 152, a timing at which this color image data is read out from the FIFO 141.
      <br/>
      That is, the synchronous counter 140 receives the encryption information signal 152 at its initial value set input terminal, counts a timing at which data is to be read out from the FIFO 141, and changes the read timing in accordance with data generated by the random number generating circuit 131, i.e., the image information signal 151.
    </p>
    <p num="62">In this manner, the image information signal 151 shown in FIG. 6 is output to the recording unit as a signal having sync timings different between lines.</p>
    <p num="63">
      In the printer unit, on the other hand, in storing the image information signal 151 in the FIFO 133, the signal is stored from color image data corresponding to the leading end of an image in accordance with the timing signal generated by the synchronous counter 132.

      The operation of the decrypting circuit will be described below with reference to FIG. 12. The encryption method data supplied from the control unit on the scanner side is stored in the FIFO 502.
      <br/>
      In accordance with the clock from the control unit 503, the encryption method data is transmitted from the FIFO 502 to the control unit on the scanner side via the control unit 503.
      <br/>
      If the control unit on the scanner side determines that the encryption method data from the control unit on the printer side is adequate, an encrypted signal is transmitted to the LUT 501, and at the same time the control unit of the encrypting circuit transmits the encryption method data.
      <br/>
      The LUT 501 performs decryption by allowing the function in the memory area determined by the encryption method data to act on the encrypted signal.
      <br/>
      Note that the function in the memory area of the LUT 501 corresponding to the encryption method data is the inverse function of the function in the memory area of the LUT 401 shown in FIG. 11(a) corresponding to that data.
    </p>
    <p num="91">
      FIG. 13 shows a panel for a through mode in which no encryption is performed.
      <br/>
      An example of the through mode will be described below with reference to FIG. 13. Referring to FIG. 13, S601 indicates a regular screen for accepting copying, and, when a predetermined key operation is performed on an operation unit (not shown), the regular screen is switched to a through mode screen as indicated by S602.
      <br/>
      The through mode is useful in checking whether an abnormal portion exists in the encrypting unit or the decrypting unit if an abnormal image is output.
      <br/>
      Note that a table for the through mode is assigned to a predetermined memory area in each of the LUT 401 of FIG. 11(a) and the LUT 501 of FIG. 12. In addition, if a disconnection is determined by a signal line (not shown) for monitoring the connection between the scanner unit and the printer unit, a cryptogram generating unit (not shown) in the scanner unit sends to the encrypting circuit a signal for selecting a mode except the through mode in order to prevent an illegal use of the scanner unit.
    </p>
    <p num="92">The same processing is also performed for the decrypting circuit in the printer unit.</p>
    <p num="93">
      Timings at which encryption method data is transmitted between the scanner unit and the printer unit will be described below with reference to FIGS. 14 to 16. An example of transmitting encryption method data at the start of an image read operation will be described first with reference to a flow chart shown in FIG. 14. Referring to FIG. 14, when a power supply of the main body is switched on, a wait state display is performed until the printer unit becomes usable (S702 and S703).
      <br/>
      When the use of the printer unit is enabled, copy OK is displayed (S704).
      <br/>
      The system stands by until an image read operation is started, i.e., a copy button is depressed.
      <br/>
      If the copy button is depressed (S705), the image scanner unit generates a command (command data designating that encryption method data+transmission data is encryption method data) to the printer unit through the terminal 3 shown in FIG. 11(a) (S706).
      <br/>
      In this case, encryption method data other than that for the through mode is transmitted to the encrypting circuit as described above unless otherwise designated on the operation unit.
      <br/>
      Subsequently, the scanner unit receives data corresponding to the command from the printer (S707).
      <br/>
      If the data transmitted from and received by the scanner unit equal each other, a copy operation is performed (S708); if not, no copy operation is performed (S709).
    </p>
    <p num="94">
      FIG. 15 is a flow chart for transmitting encryption method data each time a frame sequential exposure for image reading is performed by the scanner unit.
      <br/>
      Referring to FIG. 15, a wait state display is performed after the power supply of the main body is switched on and before the printer unit is operable (S802 and S803).
      <br/>
      When the printer unit becomes operable, copy OK is displayed (S804).
      <br/>
      When a copy operation is started to feed paper and the scanner detects a paper leading end signal (ITOP signal), the scanner generates a command (command data designating that encryption method data+transmission data is encryption method data) to the printer (S806).
      <br/>
      Here again, a signal indicating a mode except the through mode is selected as a table select signal.
      <br/>
      The scanner receives data corresponding to the transmission data from the printer (S807).
      <br/>
      If the transmission data from and the reception data to the scanner equal each other, the scanner immediately executes scanning (S808); if not, the scanner stops the operation (S809).
      <br/>
      This embodiment in which a command is supplied for each scanning is excellent in transmitting an image not only to the printer but also to external equipment, such as an image memory.
    </p>
    <p num="95">
      FIG. 16 is a flow chart for sending a command at the time the power supply of the main body is switched on and at each predetermined time interval after the switching ON.
      <br/>
      When the power supply of the main body is switched on (S902), the scanner generates a command (command data designating that encryption method data+transmission data is encryption method data) to the printer (S903).
      <br/>
      The scanner receives data corresponding to the command from the printer (S904).
      <br/>
      If the reception data equals the transmission data, the scanner repeatedly transmits data to the printer at each predetermined time interval (S905 to S907).
      <br/>
      The scanner repeats this operation until the reception data does not equal the table select data from the scanner any longer or the print operation is finished (S908).
    </p>
    <p num="96">An operation of edit processing will be described below with reference to FIGS. 17(a) to 17(c).</p>
    <p num="97">
      The edit processing 109 shown in FIG. 8 includes MTF processing (edge emphasizing or smoothing processing), trimming processing (for forcibly converting each pixel signal other than a designated region into a signal of "white") shown in FIG. 17(a), texture processing (for executing, for an original, addition/subtraction or multiplication of a signal of a processing pattern stored beforehand in a memory, thereby obtaining an output image) shown in FIG. 11(b), and color conversion processing (for converting a given color in an original image into another color) shown in FIG. 17(c).
      <br/>
      In the fifth embodiment, the color conversion processing is performed by the block 109-a in FIG. 8, and the other processing operations are performed by the block 109-b in FIG. 8.
      <br/>
      In other words, the fifth embodiment can perform edit processing with high quality because the processing is performed before encryption.
    </p>
    <p num="98">Note that the edit processing can also be performed after encryption.</p>
    <p num="99">
      If the edit processing is performed after an image signal is encrypted, the original image signal cannot be restored.
      <br/>
      In this case, therefore, the encrypted signal is decrypted first, and then edit processing is performed.
    </p>
    <p num="100">
      In the fifth embodiment, the memory area designation data of the LUTs shown in FIGS. 11(a) and 12 are used as the encryption method data, but the present invention is not limited to this embodiment.
      <br/>
      That is, any signal including those of the other embodiments can be used as long as the signal is for decrypting an encrypted signal.
    </p>
    <p num="101">The present invention is not limited to a color copying machine but can be applied to any system where signals are transmitted/received between image processing apparatuses, for example, between an image reading apparatus, such as a scanner or a camera, and an image storage apparatus, and between an image storage apparatus and an image forming apparatus, such as a printer or a CRT.</p>
    <p num="102">As many apparently widely different embodiments of the present invention can be made without departing from the spirit and scope thereof, it is to be understood that the invention is not limited to the specific embodiments thereof except as defined in the appended claims.</p>
