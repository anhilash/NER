      Field of the Invention
    </p>
    <p num="3">This invention relates to a polymer electrolyte which includes a sulfonated polystyrene resin, further to a polymer aggregating agent and a disposal of waste water.</p>
    <p num="4">2. Description of Prior Art</p>
    <p num="5">
      The polystyrene resin is transparent, and is excellent in electric properties, rigidity, and resistance to water.
      <br/>
      In addition, it requires less cost for production.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, the polystyrene resin is used alone, or as copolymers and alloys in combination with other resins to serve as a material of buffering members (foamed styrol), packing materials, or cabinets and parts of electric appliances and automobiles, and has been used as widely as polyolefin resins represented by polyethylene.
    </p>
    <p num="6">The polystyrene resin is used not only as a structural element as described above, but can be used, for example, as an agglutinating agent after it has been converted to a polymer electrolyte.</p>
    <p num="7">
      Recently, a world-wide attention has been directed to protection of natural environment, and preservation of clean water resources is thought as a key to the problem.
      <br/>
      Under these circumstances, legal regulations controlling liquid waste discharged from plants and general households as are specified in the sewage control law become more strict.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      To control waste water, recourse has been made to purification by a variety of polymer aggregating agents.
      <br/>
      The polymer aggregating agent widely used includes non-ionic/anion types for industrial water wastes, and cationic types for general sewage and human excretions.
      <br/>
      Although these aggregating agents are chosen as appropriate according to a given application, they are required of, in common, having properties to clean liquid waste, concentrate it and remove water content from it.
      <br/>
      Of these properties, the cleaning activity of a suspension is most important, and demand for that activity has been increasingly strengthened from the viewpoint to protect environment from pollution because the filtrate produced after sewage has been treated with an aggregating agents discharged into rivers, lakes and the sea in local areas.
    </p>
    <p num="9">Under these circumstances, trials have been made in which two kinds of polymer aggregating agents are combined or a polymer aggregating agent is combined with a metal compound, to give a product capable of reducing the chemical oxygen demand (COD) and turbidity of a filtrate.</p>
    <p num="10">However, conventional technologies have not produced yet any aggregating agents that can satisfactorily clean a suspension, and improvement of conventional technologies involved in water treatment has been desired.</p>
    <heading>OBJECTS AND SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="11">This invention intends to provide a polymer electrolyte which dissolves sufficiently readily into water.</p>
    <p num="12">In addition, this invention intends to provide a polymer aggregating agent which is highly potent in purifying a suspension, and to provide further a liquid waste disposal which is highly effective for the purification of a suspension.</p>
    <p num="13">Furthermore, this invention intends to provide a polymer aggregating agent which is highly potent in purifying a suspension and can reduce the water content of produced cakes.</p>
    <p num="14">The polymer electrolyte of this invention contains a sulfonated polystyrene resin as a principal ingredient, in addition to an inorganic pigment, and is water soluble.</p>
    <p num="15">
      The presence of the inorganic pigment, during sulfonation of the polystyrene resin, inhibits cross-linking reactions, thereby suppressing gelation of the product.
      <br/>
      Through this maneuver, unnecessary polymers are not generated in water, and water-soluble polymer electrolytes can be stably obtained.
    </p>
    <p num="16">
      The polymer aggregating agent of this invention contains a polymer compound as a principal ingredient, and, in addition, carbon black.
      <br/>
      The liquid waste disposal this invention provides consists of adding the polymer aggregating agent to liquid waste, aggregating suspended matters, and removing the aggregated matters by filtration.
    </p>
    <p num="17">Use of a polymer aggregating agent supplemented with carbon black or use of a polymer aggregating agent together with carbon black will enhance the purification activity of that agent towards a suspension.</p>
    <p num="18">The polymer aggregating agent of this invention contains a sulfonated styrene polymer as a principal ingredient and has a molecular weight of 150,000-600,000.</p>
    <p num="19">Use of a styrene polymer having a comparatively large molecular weight will enhance the purification activity of the product towards a suspension, and reduce the water content of resulting cakes.</p>
    <p num="20">The polymer electrolyte of this invention contains, in addition to an inorganic pigment, a sulfonated polystyrene resin as a principal ingredient, and is water soluble.</p>
    <p num="21">The inorganic pigment may include either carbon black or titanium oxide, or both, and the content may be 1 * 10-5 -15 wt %, or more preferably 5 * 10-4 -5 wt %.</p>
    <p num="22">
      Carbon black and titanium oxide can be chosen from any general products that are used as a colorant of resins, a reinforcing agent or an agent conferring electroconductivity.
      <br/>
      For example, carbon black can be chosen from any products that have been produced by a channel method, furnace method or thermal method.
    </p>
    <p num="23">
      A carbon black product which has been produced by any one of those methods may be used, or carbon black products which have been produced by different methods may be used in combination.
      <br/>
      It preferably has an average particle size of 5-500 nm, or more preferably 10-50 nm.
      <br/>
      Titanium oxide may have a rutile, anatase, or ultra-fine structure.
      <br/>
      Titanium oxide with any one structure may be used or titanium oxide crystals with different structures may be used in combination.
      <br/>
      It preferably has an average particle size of 0.01-50 nm, or more preferably 0.05-10 nm.
    </p>
    <p num="24">
      The polystyrene resin may consist of a single polystyrene compound, or a copolymer of a styrene with other monomers.
      <br/>
      When the polystyrene resin consists of a copolymer, the styrene unit preferably occupies 30 mol % or more.
      <br/>
      The polystyrene resin may be alloys or blends which result after the styrene unit has been combined with other polymers.
      <br/>
      In this case, the polystyrene resin preferably occupies 20 wt % or more of the total product.
    </p>
    <p num="25">
      The styrene copolymer may include styrene-butadiene, styrene-acrylonitrile, styrene-butadiene-acrylonitrile, styrene-(metha)acrylate (aliphatic hydrocarbons with 1-4 carbons), styrene-acrylonitrile-(metha)-acrylate esters (aliphatic hydrocarbons with 1-4 carbons), styrene-butadiene-(metha) acrylate ester (aliphatic hydrocarbons with 1-4 carbons), styrene-anhydrous maleate, and styrene-an hydrous itaconic acid.
      <br/>
      Of them preferred are styrene-butadiene, styrene-acrylonitrile, styrene-butadiene-acrylonitrile, styrene-acrylonitrile-(metha)acrylate esters (aliphatic hydrocarbons with 1-4 carbons), and styrene-butadiene -(metha)-acrylate esters (aliphatic hydrocarbons with 1-4 carbons), and styrene-a nhydrous maleate.
      <br/>
      Of them, styrene-butadiene, styrene-acrylonitrile, styrene- butadiene-acrylonitrile, and styrene-anhydrous maleate are particularly preferred.
      <br/>
      These styrene copolymers may be used alone or in combination with polystyrene or other styrene copolymers.
      <br/>
      The polystyrene resin preferably has a molecular weight of 5,000-10,000,000, more preferably 50,000-100,000, or further more preferably 100,000-500,000.
    </p>
    <p num="26">
      When the polystyrene resin is made into an alloy, or used as a blend, other polymers to be combined with the alloy or blend may include polyphenylene ether, polycarbonate, polyphenylene sulfide, polyamide (nylon), polyethylenetelephthalate, and polybutylenetelephthalate.
      <br/>
      Of them particularly preferred are polyphenylene ether and polycarbonate.
      <br/>
      Any one of them may be used alone, or two or more of them may be used in combination.
    </p>
    <p num="27">
      The above-described polymer electrolytes can be used as an aggregating agent for the treatment of liquid waste, dispersant for cement production, thinning agent for paper production, electroconductive agent for copying machines, and anti-static electricity agent.
      <br/>
      They are particularly well suited for the treatment of liquid waste, dispersal of cement particles, thinning of paper fibers and electroconduction of the toner particles of copying machines.
    </p>
    <p num="28">The manufacture of the polymer electrolyte of this invention is to produce the polymer electrolytes as described above, and consists of converting a polystyrene resin into a water-soluble polymer electrolyte by sulfonating the resin in the presence of an inorganic pigment.</p>
    <p num="29">
      The polystyrene resin may be chosen from among those described above, and can be also adopted from a new material (virgin material) specially prepared for the production of the polymer electrolyte of this invention, or from wastes (waste materials) from plants, shops and households.
      <br/>
      Or, a combination of virgin and waste materials may be used.
      <br/>
      As seen from above, this invention can recycle polystyrene resins which have been mass-produced as a general-purposes in and wasted, and hence is very beneficial for the protection of global environment from artificial pollutants.
      <br/>
      From this point of view, it is desirable for this invention to adopt waste materials as a source of polystyrene resins rather than virgin materials.
      <br/>
      As a source of polystyrene resins, it is desirable to resort to wastes from plants and shops than those from general households, because the wastes from plants and shops may be more or less homogenous in composition.
    </p>
    <p num="30">
      Prior to sulfonation, the polystyrene resin is dissolved in an organic solvent, or dispersed therein, to which is added a sulfonating agent.
      <br/>
      When a polystyrene resin is used in combination with another polymer, the two compounds are dissolved or dispersed in an organic solvent.
    </p>
    <p num="31">
      The organic solvent preferably includes halogenated aliphatic hydrocarbons with 1-2 carbons, particularly 1,2-dichloromethane, chloroform, dichloromethane, and 1,1-dichloroethane.
      <br/>
      To this organic solvent is preferably added the polystyrene resin at 0.5-50 wt %, or more preferably 2-20 wt %, though the addition is more or less dependent on the molecular weight of the resin.
    </p>
    <p num="32">
      Saturated or unsaturated cyclic hydrocarbon compounds may be used.
      <br/>
      The saturated cyclic hydrocarbon compound may include cyclopenthane, methylcyclopenthane, cyclohexane, methylcyclohexane, ethylcyclohexane, p-menthane, bicyclohexyl, dekalin, sabinane, etc.
      <br/>
      The unsaturated cyclic hydrocarbon compound may include cyclohexane, monocyclic monoterpene (limonene, sylvestrene, and terpinene), dicyclic monoterpene (carene, pinene, sabinene, and camphene), and terpinorene.
      <br/>
      Of these cyclic hydrocarbons, saturated cyclic hydrocarbons are more preferred.
    </p>
    <p num="33">
      The solvent which can coexist with such a cyclic hydrocarbon may include, in addition to above-described aliphatic hydrocarbons, paraffin hydrocarbons with 1-7 carbons, acetonitrile, carbondisulfide, tetrahydroflan, tetrahydrobilan, acetone, methylethylketone, thiophene, etc.
      <br/>
      Of them particularly preferred are paraffin hydrocarbons, acetonitrile, tetrahydroflan, and acetone.
    </p>
    <p num="34">
      The sulfonating agent may include anhydrous sulfuric acid, fuming sulfuric acid, chlorosulfonic acid, and concentrated sulfuric acid.
      <br/>
      The addition of the sulfonating agent is preferably set to 0.5-2.0 mol for every benzenering in the branched chain of the polystyrene resin, or preferably 0.7-1.5 mol. When a polyphenylene ether or polycarbonate resin is used in combination, benzene rings in the backbone of this resin and benzene rings in the above-described polystyrene resin should be taken into account, to determine the amount of the sulfonating agent to be added.
      <br/>
      If addition of the sulfonating agent is too little, the product would be insufficiently sulfonated and its solubility to water would be also insufficient.
      <br/>
      On the contrary, if addition of the sulfonating agent is too much, cross-linking reactions within and among molecules would be enhanced, which would lead to increased production of by-products, and solubility of the product to water would be also impaired.
    </p>
    <p num="35">
      The sulfonating agent may be used in combination with a Lewis base.
      <br/>
      In this case, the Lewis base may include alkyl phosphates such as triethylphosphate and trimethylphosphate, dioxane, anhydrous acetic acid, ethyl acetate, diethylether, thioxane, etc.
    </p>
    <p num="36">The sulfonating reaction preferably takes place at 0-80 (degree)  C., or more preferably at 10-60 (degree)  C.</p>
    <p num="37">
      It is important to allow either carbon black or titanium oxide or an inorganic pigment to coexist during the sulfonation.
      <br/>
      During the sulfonation, either carbon black or titanium oxide, or both are preferably allowed to exist at a concentration of 1 * 10-5 -25 wt %, or more preferably at 5 * 10-4 -10 wt %.
    </p>
    <p num="38">
      The inorganic pigment may be added to the reaction system prior to sulfonation so that it can coexist during sulfonation occurring subsequently, or inorganic pigment remains in the polystyrene resin may be used instead.
      <br/>
      Typically, polystyrene resin waste contains carbon black or titanium oxide as an additive, and when the content satisfies the above-described requirement, the polystyrene resin waste can undergo sulfonation without any deliberate addition of an inorganic pigment.
      <br/>
      The resin supplemented previously with an inorganic pigment disperses more readily in a reaction system.
      <br/>
      The resin supplemented with an inorganic pigment in advance preferably contains the pigment at 0.002-50 wt %, particularly at 0.01-10 wt %.
    </p>
    <p num="39">
      When an inorganic solvent is allowed to coexist during the sulfonation of a polystyrene resin as described above, it improves the dispersibility of the resin so that reaction proceeds evenly.
      <br/>
      This inhibits cross-linking reactions within and among involved molecules, thereby suppressing the production of by-products insoluble to water.
      <br/>
      Thus, presence of an inorganic solvent in the reaction system ensures stable production of water-soluble polymer electrolytes, improves the dispersibility of polymer electrolytes, and allows stable production of polymer electrolytes even in quality.
    </p>
    <p num="40">
      The reaction system, after sulfonation as described above, is allowed to react with a basic compound to be neutralized.
      <br/>
      The basic compound may include hydroxides and carbonates of alkali metals and alkali earth metals, ammonia, and primary to tertiary alkyl amine compounds.
      <br/>
      It may be added neat or as a solution gradually until the system is completely neutralized.
      <br/>
      When it is added as an aqueous solution, its addition varies according to the molecular weight of the polystyrene resin, but preferably is 1-100 times, or more preferably 2-50 times the total weight of the resin.
      <br/>
      When the neutralization reaction is completed, the solvent may be removed by fractional distillation or evaporation.
    </p>
    <p num="41">
      Above procedures produce a water-soluble polymer electrolyte containing an inorganic pigment.
      <br/>
      Although generally the polymer electrolyte containing an inorganic pigment is excellent in its homogenous dispersibility when dissolved in water, it may be removed of the inorganic pigment by filtration as needed.
    </p>
    <p num="42">In addition, this invention enables disposal of liquid waste by utilizing the polymer electrolyte containing carbon black as an aggregating agent, or by utilizing the polymer aggregating agent in combination with carbon black.</p>
    <p num="43">
      Carbon black to be used in this invention may include the products generally used as a coloring agent or a reinforcing agent of resins, or as a conductivity-conferring agent.
      <br/>
      Carbon black can be chosen from any products that have been produced by a channel method, furnace method or thermal method.
      <br/>
      A carbon black product which has been produced by any one of those methods may be used alone, or carbon black products which have been produced by different methods may be used in combination.
      <br/>
      It preferably has an average particle size of 5-500 nm, or more preferably 10-50 nm.
    </p>
    <p num="44">
      When carbon black is placed in waste water, minute particles and organic elements suspending in the water cluster together around carbon black particles as nuclei, to form aggregates.
      <br/>
      These tiny aggregates, thanks to the polymer aggregating agent, cluster further together to form larger aggregates, which are then removed by filtration.
      <br/>
      This will result in reduction of the turbidity and COD of the filtrate.
    </p>
    <p num="45">
      In above procedure, whether carbon black is added after having been combined with the polymer aggregating agent, or it is added independently of the polymer aggregating agent, the resulting effect will be the same.
      <br/>
      However, it is preferable for carbon black to be combined with the polymer aggregating agent prior to use, because then the polymer aggregating agent will disperse more evenly in waste water, and require no complicated processes as would be necessary if these agents were added separately.
    </p>
    <p num="46">If they are added separately, any one of the two may come first, but it is more preferable to add carbon black first.</p>
    <p num="47">
      When carbon black is combined with the polymer aggregating agent, its addition is preferably set to 0.01-20 wt %, or more preferably 0.05-10 wt % with respect to the polymer content of the polymer aggregating agent.
      <br/>
      When carbon black is added independently of the polymer aggregating agent to waste water, its added amount is typically 0.005-1000 ppm, or preferably 0.01-200 ppm, although the amount may be adjusted more or less according to the concentration of suspended particles (SS) in the water.
      <br/>
      If the added amount is too little, the filtrate, even after being removed of aggregates, will still hold a considerable fraction of turbidity and COD.
      <br/>
      On the contrary, if the added amount is too much, carbon black will remain in the filtrate, or interfere with aggregation of suspended particles.
    </p>
    <p num="48">
      The polymer compound constituting the polymer aggregating agent may include sulfonates of polystyrene resins, non-ionic or anionic acrylamide resins, or cationic resins.
      <br/>
      They may be used alone or in combination.

      The thus-obtained polymer aggregating agent must have a molecular weight of 150,000 to 600,000, or more preferably 200,000 to 500,000.
      <br/>
      The polymer aggregating agent of which the sulfonated styrene polymer has a molecular weight less than 150,000 will lose the activity to aggregate suspended particles in a suspension, and rather disperse those suspended matters into the solvent.
      <br/>
      On the contrary, if the sulfonated styrene polymer has a molecular weight of 600,000 or more, it will cause suspended particles to aggregate into coarse masses, not being able to purify water sufficiently, and the resulting cake will contain too much water.
    </p>
    <p num="83">
      For this polymer aggregating agent, 40 mol % or more, or preferably 50 mol % or more sulfone group is introduced into the styrene polymer.
      <br/>
      The polymer aggregating agent, of which the styrene polymer contains 40 mol % or less sulfone group, will become less soluble to water, and thus greatly lose the aggregating activity towards suspended matters in a suspension.
    </p>
    <p num="84">
      As discussed above, for the desired amount of sulfone group to be introduced into the styrene polymer to produce a proper polymer aggregating agent, the styrene unit preferably occupies 60 mol %, or more preferably 80 mol % or more of the styrene polymer.
      <br/>
      If the fraction of styrene unit in the styrene polymer were less than 60 mol %, it would be difficult to obtain a polymer aggregating agent in which the desired amount of sulfone group can be introduced through sulfonation.

      The thus-obtained polymer aggregating agent may be used in combination with another aggregating agent consisting of acrylamide polymer with non-ionic and/or anionic activity, for the treatment of waste water.

      When a mixture including carbon black and an aqueous solution of polymer aggregating agent was added to the test substrate (Example 9), or when the aqueous solution of polymer aggregating agent was added following the addition of carbon black (Example 10), the sewage treatment activity was more enhanced, or more specifically the test substrate became more effectively purified than was possible with the single use of the aqueous solution of polymer aggregating agent not being supplemented with carbon black (Comparative Example 5).

      From Table 3 it is obvious that all the samples from Examples 11-15 have a basic property as a polymer aggregating agent, and are far more active in reducing the turbidity of the filtrate after sedimentation than the sample from Comparative Example 7 whose molecular weight is outside the range of 150,000-600,000.
      <br/>
      This result demonstrates that a polymer aggregating agent which contains a sulfonated styrene polymer as a principal ingredient and has a molecular weight in the range of 150,000-600,000 is greatly improved in its treatment activity towards waste water, especially in its purification of suspensions.

      It was also found that the samples of Examples 11-15 are more effective in reducing the water content of dehydrated cakes than those from Comparative Examples 6 and 7 or the polymer aggregating agents with a molecular weight being outside the range of 150,000-600,000.
      <br/>
      This result demonstrates that a polymer aggregating agent with a molecular weight in the range of 150,000-600,000 is greatly improved in its treatment activity towards waste water, especially in its recovery of purified water from sewage which will be served for reuse.

    <p num="177">It was further ascertained that the polymer aggregating agent may include partially hydrolyzed polyacrylamide, and that polystyrene sodium sulfonate may include materials prepared from used polystyrene resins.</p>

      Mixed slurry discharged from a sewage treatment plant (pH 6.6, and having an SS concentration of 2.8 wt %) was sampled to be used as a test substrate with which to evaluate the performance of the samples.
      <br/>
      The samples from Examples 16 and 17, and Comparative Examples 8 and 9 were separately put into jars containing the test substrate while the substrate being stirred.
      <br/>
      The added amount was so adjusted as to give 0.6 wt % quaternary compound of dimethylaminoethylacrylate with methylchloride for every percent of SS.
      <br/>
      Then, polystyrene sodium sulfonate specific to Examples 16 and 17 and to Comparative Examples 8 and 9 was added at a ratio of 0.15 wt % to every percent of SS.
      <br/>
      The mixture, after being stirred, was left to stand, and the sedimentation rate, turbidity of the filtrate after sedimentation, and the water content of cakes were determined.
      <br/>
      The results are shown in Table 4.
