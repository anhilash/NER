      Thermoplastic and elastomeric polyolefin mixture including from 3 to 25% by weight of crystalline or partially crystalline isotactic poly(1-butene), and from 75 to 97% by weight of a heterophasic polyolefin composition; the latter containing a crystalline propylene polymer and an elastomeric copolymer of ethylene with propylene and/or an alpha-olefin.

  <description format="original" lang="en" id="desc_en">
    <p num="1">This application is a U.S. National Stage application of International application PCT/EP98/03029, filed May 28, 1998.</p>
    <p num="2">
      This invention concerns an elastomeric and thermoplastic polyolefin mixture.
      <br/>
      More particularly, it concerns a mixture comprising a heterophasic polyolefin composition and some crystalline or partially crystalline poly(1-butene), and the articles produced with said mixture.
    </p>
    <p num="3">The mixture of this invention can be used in many sectors, for example in the production of laminates, roofing materials, and articles manufactured by way of coinjection and injection molding, as well as blow molding, such as biomedical articles.</p>
    <p num="4">
      At the present time the main disadvantage of the heterophasic compositions with good flexibility and softness characteristics that are used in the above mentioned sectors, such as the ones described in published European patent application EP-A-472946 (Himont Inc.), is the tendency of being tacky.
      <br/>
      Said property is undesirable for some applications, for example, because it has a negative effect on the aesthetic aspect of the article, and does not ensure a good welding seal due to the presence of low molecular weights that rise to the surface of the sides to be welded.
      <br/>
      Moreover, highly tacky materials make storing difficult and the use of laminates more troublesome.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      Also known are heterophasic compositions comprising crystalline poly(1-butene), crystalline propylene, and EPR or EPDM rubber.
      <br/>
      Examples of said mixtures are described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,078,020 in the name of Ciba Geigy Corporation.
      <br/>
      Said compositions present good flexibility and low hardness values.
    </p>
    <p num="6">Now a mixture of the above mentioned composition has been found which is very flexible, and displays very low hardness as well as low tackiness values.</p>
    <p num="7">
      In addition, the above mentioned mixture presents good tensile strength.
      <br/>
      As shown by the stress-strain curve, the specimen prepared with the above mentioned mixture shows greater strain resistance compared to the mixture without poly(1-butene).
      <br/>
      Said improvement does not have an adverse effect on other properties, particularly on flexibility.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the balance of the other mechanical properties is not significantly different from that of the mixture without poly(1 -butene).
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      Considering said properties, the mixture of this invention is specifically adequate for use in the production of geomembranes, for example.
      <br/>
      In fact, among the properties that are most desirable for geomembranes are good flexibility and good strain resistance.
      <br/>
      Flexibility is important because it makes it easier to handle the membranes during their transport and laying, and because the membranes can conform as much as possible to the undulations and roughness of the ground.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      Moreover, as mentioned above, said mixtures also present the additional advantage of having reduced and delayed surface tackiness.
      <br/>
      The gradual increase in surface tackiness of an arcicle manufactured from elastomeric polymers is an undesired phenomenon that inevitably manifests itself after a period of time.
      <br/>
      The mixtures of the present invention, on the other hand, allow the manufacture of articles with satisfactory optical properties, such as gloss for example, as well as articles with strong welds.
      <br/>
      Moreover, low tackiness, for example, avoids the difficulties related with the storage and use of the laminates.
    </p>
    <p num="10">Therefore, object of the present invention is a thermoplastic and elastomeric polyolefin mixture comprising the following fractions (weight percentage):</p>
    <p num="11">
      I. from 3 to 25%, preferably 5-20%, of crystalline or partially crystalline isotactic poly(1-butene); and
      <br/>
      II. from 75 to 97%, preferably from 80 to 95%, of a heterophasic polyolefin composition comprising:
    </p>
    <p num="12">
      - A. 4-40%, preferably 8-38%, of a crystalline propylene homopolymer, or a crystalline copolymer of propylene with ethylene or a CH2.dbd.CHR  ALPHA -olefin, where R is a C2 -C8 alkyl radical, or a crystalline copolymer of propylene with ethylene and said CH2.dbd.CHR  ALPHA -olefin, said copolymers containing over 85% of propylene, and having a fraction insoluble in xylene greater than 80%;
      <br/>
      - B. 0-20%, preferably 0-15%, of a crystalline copolymer of ethylene with propylene or a CH2.dbd.CHR  ALPHA -olefin, where R is a C2 -C8 alkyl radical, or a crystalline copolymer of ethylene with propylene and said  ALPHA -olefin, said copolymers being insoluble in xylene at ambient temperature; and
      <br/>
      - C. 40-96%, preferably 50-75%, of an elastomeric copolymer of ethylene with propylene or a CH2.dbd.CHR  ALPHA -olefin, where R is a C2 -C8 alkyl radical, and optionally minor quantities of a diene, or a copolymer of ethylene with propylene and said  ALPHA -olefin, and optionally minor quantities of a diene, said copolymers containing ethylene in a quantity lower than 40%, preferably from 20 to 38%, and being soluble in xylene at ambient temperature.

    <p num="14">In the present description ambient temperature refers to a temperature around 25 (degree)  C. As a way of example, the total quantity of ethylene in heterophasic composition (II) ranges from 15 to 35% by weight.</p>
    <p num="15">Examples of heterophasic compositions (II) are described in the above mentioned European patent application U.S. Pat. No. 5,286,564, whose content is incorporated in this patent application for reference purposes.</p>
    <p num="16">
      In the mixture of the present invention it is preferable that fraction (A) of heterophasic composition (II) be a copolymer instead of a homopolymer.
      <br/>
      Preferably the propylene content in the copolymers of fraction (A) ranges from 90 to 99% by weight.
    </p>
    <p num="17">The fraction insoluble in xylene of the polymers of fraction (A) preferably ranges from 85 to 99% in the case of homopolymers, and from 85 to 95% in the case of copolymers, and is defined as fraction insoluble in xylene at 25 (degree)  C. (see note 1 below).</p>
    <p num="18">
      Preferably the content of ethylene in fraction (B) is at least 75% by weight, more preferably at least 80% by weight with respect to the total weight of (B).
      <br/>
      Preferably the copolymer constituting fraction (B) is an essentially linear copolymer of ethylene with propylene, such as linear low density polyethylene (LLDPE).
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      Examples of the above mentioned CH2.dbd.CHR  ALPHA -olefins present in heterophasic composition (II) are 1-butene, 1-pentene, 4-methyl-1-pentene, 1-hexene, and 1-octene.
      <br/>
      Whenever present, the diene in fraction (C) of composition (II) preferably ranges from 1 to 10% by weight with respect to the total weight of fraction (C).
      <br/>
      Examples of dienes are butadiene, 1,4-hexadiene, 1,5-hexadiene, and ethylidene-1-norbornene.
    </p>
    <p num="20">
      The above mentioned heterophasic composition (II) can be prepared by mixing fractions (A), (B), and (C) in the fluid state, i.e., at temperatures greater than their softening or melting point, or, more preferably, by sequential polymerization in two or more stages in the presence of a highly stereospecific Ziegler-Natta catalyst.
      <br/>
      In particular the catalyst system used comprises (i) a solid catalytic component containing a titanium compound and an electron-donor compound supported on magnesium chloride, and (ii) an Al-trialkyl compound and an electron-donor compound.
    </p>
    <p num="21">
      The above mentioned sequential polymerization process for the production of heterophasic composition (II) comprises at least two stages, where in the first stage the propylene is polymerized optionally in the presence of ethylene and/or said  ALPHA -olefin as comonomer(s) to form fraction (A), and in the subsequent stages the mixtures of ethylene/propylene and/or an other  ALPHA -olefin and optionally a diene are polymerized to form fractions (B) and (C).
      <br/>
      The polymerization processes are carried out in either liquid, gas, or liquid/gas phase.
      <br/>
      The reaction temperature in the various stages of polymerization can be equal or different, and generally ranges from 40 (degree)  to 90 (degree)  C., preferably from 50 to 80 (degree)  C. for fraction (A), and from 40 to 60 (degree)  C. for fractions (B) and (C).
    </p>
    <p num="22">
      Examples of sequential polymerization processes are described in European patent application EP-A472946.
      <br/>
      When heterophasic composition (II) is prepared by way of sequential polymerization, fraction (B) is present in a quantity greater than or equal to 1% by weight.
      <br/>
      If said fraction (B) is present, it is preferable that the (B)/(C) weight ratio be lower than 0.4, in particular from 0.08 to 0.3. It is also preferable that the weight percentage of fraction (C), or the sum of fractions (B) and (C) be from 50 to 90%, preferably from 60 to 80%, with respect to heterophasic composition (II).
    </p>
    <p num="23">
      The Melt Index (MI) values (according to ASTM D 1238, condition L) of heterophasic composition (II) generally range from 0.1 to 100 g/10 min, preferably from 0.2 to 50 g/10 min.
      <br/>
      The heterophasic composition (II) with said MI values can be obtained directly during the polymerization process; as an alternative, said composition (II) can be subjected to a chemical visbreaking process carried out in the presence of the appropriate visbreaking agents, such as peroxides.
      <br/>
      Said chemical visbreaking process is carried out using well known methods.
    </p>
    <p num="24">
      The 1-butene polymers adequate for the use in this invention are both the homopolymers or copolymers of 1-butene with an olefin comonomer selected, preferably, from ethylene and propylene.
      <br/>
      As a way of example, the quantity of comonomer in the copolymers ranges from 0.5 to 30% by weight, preferably from 1 to 20% by weight.
      <br/>
      The homopolymers are preferred.
    </p>
    <p num="25">
      Said poly(1-butene) is a crystalline or semicrystalline isotactic polymer with an isotactic index of at least 60%, preferably 90%; in the case of poly(1-butene) homopolymers the isotactic index is preferably at least 95%.
      <br/>
      Said isotactic index is expressed as a percentage of mmmm pentads, and is determined by analysis of spectra 13 C-NMR (see note 2).
    </p>
    <p num="26">Preferably, the poly(1-butene) used to prepare the mixtures of the present invention has an intrinsic viscosity ( ETA ) ranging from 1 to 4 dl/g, preferably from 1.3 to 3 dl/g.</p>
    <p num="27">Said 1-butene polymers can be obtained using known methods, processes, and polymerization catalysts; for example, the polymerization of the 1-butene, optionally in the presence of an olefin comonomer such as ethylene or propylene, can be carried out using Ziegler-Natta or metallocenic catalysts.</p>
    <p num="28">
      As a way of example, in order to produce the 1-butene polymers described above one can use TiCl3 based catalysts, and aluminum derivatives, such as aluminum halides for example, as cocatalysts, as well as the catalytic systems described in allowed U.S. application Ser.
      <br/>
      No. 08/469,735 and U.S. Pat. No. 4,971,937, and those mentioned above for the production of heterophasic composition (II), or catalytic systems with metallocenic catalysts, such as the ones described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,769,510.
    </p>
    <p num="29">
      The mixtures of this invention can also contain various additives generally used in thermoplastic polymer compositions, such as stabilizers, antioxidants, anti-corrosion agents, anti-UV agents, carbon black, pigments, plasticizing agents, etc.
      <br/>
      Other types of additives optionally present are flame retardants and fillers, such as mineral fillers, capable of conferring specific properties to the manufactured articles.
    </p>
    <p num="30">
      The mixtures of the present invention can be prepared by mixing the components in an apparatus equipped with mixing elements, such as an internal mixer or an extruder.
      <br/>
      For example, one can use a Banbury mixer, or a Buss single-screw extruder, or a Maris or Werner twin-screw extruder.
      <br/>
      The mixing is carried out at high temperatures, generally greater that 180 (degree)  C., preferably ranging from 180 (degree)  to 240 (degree)  C.

      The chemical visbreaking of heterophasic composition (II) using the proper agents can be carried out in the presence of poly(1-butene), i.e., in the presence of component (I), and optionally other additives, as well as before the addition of component (I).
      <br/>
      Preferably the visbreaking of heterophasic composition (II) occurs in the presence of poly(1-butene).
      <br/>
      The visbreaking process is carried out according to known methods, and using visbreaking agents known in the art.
      <br/>
      Generally speaking, said agents are organic free-radicals initiators, particularly organic peroxides.
      <br/>
      Specific examples of the latter are di(tert-butyl)peroxide isopropyl benzene, dicumyl peroxide, monocumyl (tert-butyl)peroxide, and 2,5-bis(tert-butyl peroxide)-2,5- dimethylhexane.
    </p>
    <p num="32">
      As an alternative, the production of the mixtures of this invention can be carried out by sequential polymerization of said fractions (I) and (II) in three or more stages, in the presence of the above mentioned catalysts, and according to known methods and processes, such as the ones described in above mentioned European patent application EP-A-472046.
      <br/>
      The sequential polymerization can be carried out, for example, as described above for the production of heterophasic composition (II).
      <br/>
      Preferably, the poly(1-butene) is produced in gas phase.
      <br/>
      In said stage an inert gas, preferably nitrogen, is used as the diluent of the gas monomer.
      <br/>
      The sequence of the polymerization stages in the various fractions for the production of the mixture of the present invention is not binding.
      <br/>
      However, it is preferable to first conduct the polymerization process to produce fraction (A) of heterophasic composition (II), then produce the poly(1-butene), and finally fractions (B) and (C) of heterophasic composition (II).
    </p>
    <p num="33">The MIL values of the mixtures of this invention have a wide range, such as for example from 0.1 to 100 g/10 min, more preferably from 0.2 to 50 g/10 min.</p>
    <p num="34">
      The mixtures of the present invention are generally obtained in the form of pellets.
      <br/>
      The latter are then transformed and shaped into articles by way of known processes, such as injection and coinjection molding, sequential injection molding, and blow molding, or are transformed into laminates by way of extrusion, where the term �laminates� comprises film and sheets.
      <br/>
      The following examples are given in order to illustrate, but not limit the present invention.

      Determination of percentage soluble in xylene: a solution of the sample in xylene is prepared at a concentration of 1% by weight, maintaining the sample in xylene under agitation for 1 hour at 135 (degree)  C. Continuing to stir, the solution is allowed to cool to 95 (degree)  C., after which it is poured in a 25 (degree)  C. bath, where it is allowed to rest for 20 minutes without agitation, and then the stirring resumes for an additional 10 minutes.
      <br/>
      The solution is filtered, and acetone is added to a portion of the filtrate in order to precipitate the dissolved polymer.
      <br/>
      The polymer obtained in this manner is recovered, washed, dried, and finally weighed to determine the percentage soluble in xylene.

      The visbreaking of the composition is carried out until a MIL of 8 dg/min is obtained.

    <p num="63">
      Comparative example 2c was repeated, with the only difference being the use of a heterophasic composition (II), 53% by weight soluble in xylene, with the following composition:
      <br/>
      A. 45% by weight of a propylene crystalline random copolymer with 2% by weight of ethylene, 4% by weight soluble in xylene;
      <br/>
      B. 4% by weight of an essentially linear ethylene-propylene copolymer totally insoluble in xylene at 25 (degree)  C.; and

      C. 51% of an ethylene/propylene amorphous copolymer containing 26.3% of ethylene, totally soluble in xylene at 25 (degree)  C.
    </p>
    <p num="64">
      The visbreaking of the composition is carried out until a MIL of 8 dg/min is obtained.
      <br/>
      The specimens produced from the above mentioned composition show a MEF value of 220 MPa, and gloss value of 31.7.
    </p>
    <p num="65">
      The data of the examples show that the gloss of the mixtures of the present invention is clearly superior to that of the mixtures of the comparative examples.
      <br/>
      The gloss phenomenon, as well as the tackiness one, are connected with the surfacing of the low molecular weight polymer fraction: the more said surfacing is reduced, the greater the gloss, and at the same time the tackiness of the product surface diminishes.
    </p>
    <p num="66">
      Moreover, the data in Table 1 show that compared to the composition of comparative example 1c, the mixtures of the present invention have increased tenacity since the tensile strength values are higher; at the same time, compared to other mechanical properties the mixture of the present invention shows a behavior very similar to that of the composition used for comparison.
      <br/>
      In particular, the curves of FIGS. 1-5 subtend an area corresponding to the energy necessary for an elongation of the specimen equal to 800% ca.
      <br/>
      The tests were carried out according to method ASTM D 638.
      <br/>
      From the above mentioned curves one can clearly deduce that the energy required to cause said elongation is greater for the curves of FIGS. 1-4 compared to the curve of FIG. 5, i.e., the specimens associated with the curves of FIGS. 1-4 require a greater strength in order to deform compared to the strength that is used with the specimen associated with the curve of FIG. 5.
