      <br/>
      The invention provides a small-sized low-cost spread spectrum communication device including a narrow-band interference signal elimination circuit capable of covering all the frequency band of a spread signal.
      <br/>
      A spread signal is received by an antenna and supplied to a level detection circuit via a variable amplifier and a divider.
      <br/>
      The level detection circuit controls the variable amplifier so that the spread signal is amplified to a fixed level.
      <br/>
      The signal containing a narrow-band interfering signal is then passed through a plurality of magnetostatic filters connected in series such that the saturation level thereof successively decreases, thereby limiting the narrow-band interfering signal having a level greater than the level of the spread signal in a step-by-step fashion.
      <br/>
      Thus, the narrow-band interfering signal contained in the spread signal is limited to a low level without encountering a significantly large incidental reduction in the spread signal.
      <br/>
      The narrow-band interference signal elimination circuit according to the invention may be realized in the form of a small size.

      <br/>
      Field of the Invention
    </p>
    <p num="2">The present invention relates to a spread spectrum communication device, and more particularly to a spread spectrum communication device having the capability of removing a narrow-band interfering signal present in a frequency band of a spread signal.</p>
    <p num="3">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
    <p num="4">FIG. 12 illustrates an example of a narrow-band interference signal elimination circuit used in a conventional spread spectrum communication device.</p>
    <p num="5">
      As shown in FIG. 12, the narrow-band interference signal elimination circuit 100 comprises a switch 101, a band-rejection filter 102, a bandpass filter 103, a detector 104, a maximum level detection circuit 105, a switch control circuit 106, an input signal terminal 107, and an output signal terminal 108.
      <br/>
      The bandpass filter 103 comprises a plurality of filters BPF1, BPF2, . . . , BPFn. The input of each of these filters is connected to the input signal terminal 107, and the output of each of these filters is connected to the maximum level detection circuit 105 via the corresponding one of the detectors DFT1, DFT2, . . . , DFTn. The output of the maximum level detection circuit 105 is connected to the switch 101 via the switch control circuit 106.
      <br/>
      The input terminal of the switch 101 is connected to the input signal terminal 107.
      <br/>
      The switch 101 has a plurality of output terminals which are connected to the filters BEF1, BEF2, . . . , BEFn, respectively, of the band-rejection filter 102.
      <br/>
      The outputs of the filters BEF1, BEF2, . . . , BEFn are combined together and connected to the output signal terminal 108.
      <br/>
      The band-rejection filter 102, the bandpass filter 103, and the detector 104 are each include an equal number of elements.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      In the narrow-band interference signal elimination circuit 100, the frequency bands of the respective filter elements of the band-rejection filter 102 and those of the respective filter elements of the bandpass filter 103 correspond to the frequency subbands used in the spread spectrum communication.
      <br/>
      When a signal is input to the input signal terminal 107, the input signal is applied to the switch 101 and also to the detector 104 via the bandpass filter 103.
      <br/>
      The detector 104 detects the signal level for each frequency band.
      <br/>
      The maximum level detection circuit 105 evaluates the signals output from the respective elements of the detector 104, and determines the frequency band having a maximum signal level.
      <br/>
      The maximum level detection circuit 105 operates the switch 101 via the switch control circuit 106 so that the input signal is coupled to a band-rejection filter element having a frequency band corresponding to that of the bandpass filter element regarded as having the maximum signal level and thus the input signal components except for the signal component corresponding to the frequency band of the selected band-rejection filter element are output via the output signal terminal 108.
      <br/>
      When a narrow-band interfering signal is present within a communication frequency band, the signal component having a frequency band including the frequency of the interfering signal is removed by the narrow-band interference signal elimination circuit 100 described above.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      The narrow-band interference signal elimination circuit 100 described above has a problem that a great number of bandpass filter elements and band-rejection filter elements are required, and thus a large installation area for them is required.
      <br/>
      This causes an increase in cost.
      <br/>
      Another problem is that when there are two or more narrow-band interfering signals having different frequencies, only one narrow-band interfering signal having the highest signal level is removed.
    </p>
    <p num="8">Thus it is an object of the present invention to provide a small-sized low-cost spread spectrum communication device having a narrow-band interference signal elimination circuit capable of covering all spread signal frequency bands.</p>

    <heading>DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
    <p num="18">
      An embodiment of a spread spectrum communication device according to the present invention is described below with reference to FIG. 1.
      <br/>
      The spread spectrum communication device 1 comprises an antenna 2 for receiving a spread signal, a bandpass filter 3, an amplifier 4, a narrow-band interference signal elimination circuit 5 for removing interference from the spread signal, a local oscillator 6, and a mixer 7.
      <br/>
      The narrow-band interference signal elimination circuit 5 comprises a variable amplifier 8, a divider 9, a level detection circuit 10, and magnetostatic filters 11, 12, and 13.
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      The antenna 2 is connected to the mixer 7 via the bandpass filter 3, the amplifier 4, and the narrow-band interference signal elimination circuit 5.
      <br/>
      The mixer 7 is also connected to the local oscillator 6.
      <br/>
      The output of the mixer 7 is connected to a demodulator (not shown).
      <br/>
      In the narrow-band interference signal elimination circuit 5, the input is connected to the divider 9 via the variable amplifier 8.
      <br/>
      One of the outputs of the divider 9 is connected to the output terminal via the three magnetostatic filters 11, 12 and 13, and the other output is connected to the variable amplifier 8 via the level detection circuit 10.
    </p>
    <p num="20">
      The operation of the spread spectrum communication device 1 is described below with reference to FIGS. 1 and FIGS. 2(a)-2(e).
      <br/>
      FIGS. 2(a)-2(e) illustrate spectra of the spread signal and the narrow-band interfering signal contained in the spread signal at various positions in the spread spectrum communication device 1.
    </p>
    <p num="21">
      Referring to FIG. 1, the spread signal including a narrow-band interfering signal received by the antenna 2 is applied to the bandpass filter 3 so as to remove unnecessary frequency components.
      <br/>
      The signal is amplified by the amplifier 4 by a fixed amplification factor.
      <br/>
      The output of the amplifier 4 is applied to the narrow-band interference signal elimination circuit 5.
    </p>
    <p num="22">
      FIG. 2(a) illustrates the spectrum of the signal applied to the narrow-band interference signal elimination circuit 5.
      <br/>
      In FIGS. 2(a)-2(e), r1, r2, and r3 denote the saturation levels of the magnetostatic filters 11, 12, and 13, respectively.
    </p>
    <p num="23">
      The signal includes a spread signal al and also a narrow-band interfering signal b1 having a signal level higher than that of the spread signal al.
      <br/>
      The ratio of the power of the interference to the power of the spread signal may vary.
    </p>
    <p num="24">
      The signal is amplified by the variable amplifier 8, and further the signal is divided by the divider 9 into two signals, one of which is applied to the magnetostatic filter 11 and the other is applied to the level detection circuit 10.
      <br/>
      The level detection circuit 10 detects the level of the spread signal, and controls the variable amplifier 8 so that the level of the spread signal applied to the magnetostatic filter 11 is maintained at a fixed level as shown in FIG. 2(b).
      <br/>
      The amplification factor of the variable amplifier 8 is controlled so that the spread signal a2 output from the variable amplifier 8 has a level which is lower than the saturation level r1 of the magnetostatic filter 11.
      <br/>
      The narrow-band interfering signal b2 is also amplified by the same amplification factor, and the signal level of narrow-band interfering signal b2 becomes greater than the saturation level r1.
    </p>
    <p num="25">
      When the signal applied to the magnetostatic filter 11 includes a component having a level higher than the saturation level r1, the magnetostatic filter 11 limits the level of such a component to the saturation level r1.
      <br/>
      FIG. 2(c) illustrates the spectrum of the signal output by the magnetostatic filter 11.
      <br/>
      As can be seen in FIG. 2(c), the portion of the narrow-band interfering signal b3 higher in level than the saturation level r1 is cut off by the magnetostatic filter 11.
    </p>
    <p num="26">
      An incidental reduction c3 in the spread signal a3 occurs when the excess power of the narrow-band interfering signal b3 is cut off.
      <br/>
      The incidental reduction refers to a reduction in the signal level which occurs at frequencies near the band for which the above power level reduction is performed by the magnetostatic filter.
      <br/>
      The incidental reduction increases with the amount of interference power reduced by the filter.
    </p>
    <p num="27">
      Accordingly, it is preferable to limit the interference gradually.
      <br/>
      In other words, it is preferable to divide interference reduction process into two or more.
      <br/>
      In one of the processes, relatively little amount of interference is reduced, thereby reduction of spread signal can be small through the processes.
      <br/>
      As a result, interference can be removed from the spread signal with little amount of incidental reduction.
    </p>
    <p num="28">In FIG. 2(c), although the narrow-band interfering signal b3 has a high power level before being subjected to the limitation in the power level, the incidental reduction is small because the power level of the narrow-band interfering signal b3 is higher than the saturation level r1 by a small amount.</p>
    <p num="29">
      The signal output from the magnetostatic filter 11 is input to the magnetostatic filter 12.
      <br/>
      If the signal applied to the magnetostatic filter 12 includes a component in the frequency domain having a level higher than the saturation level r2, the magnetostatic filter 12 reduces the level of such a component to the saturation level r2.
      <br/>
      FIG. 2(d) illustrates the spectrum of the signal output by the magnetostatic filter 12.
      <br/>
      As can be seen in FIG. 2(d), the portion of the narrow-band interfering signal b4 higher in level than the saturation level r2 is cut off by the magnetostatic filter 12.
    </p>
    <p num="30">
      In the above operation, an incidental reduction c4 occurs in the spread signal a4.
      <br/>
      However the incidental reduction c4 is small enough because the amount of the reduction of the power level of the narrow-band interfering signal b4 performed by the magnetostatic filter 12 is smaller than the amount of the power reduction performed by the magnetostatic filter 11.
    </p>
    <p num="31">
      The signal output from the magnetostatic filter 12 is input to the magnetostatic filter 13.
      <br/>
      If the signal includes a component in the frequency domain having a level higher than the saturation level r3, the level of such a component is reduced to the saturation level r3.
      <br/>
      FIG. 2(e) illustrates the spectrum of the signal output from the magnetostatic filter 13.
      <br/>
      As shown in FIG. 2(e), the portion of the narrow-band interfering signal b5 higher in level than the saturation level r3 is cut off by the magnetostatic filter 13 so that the resultant level of the narrow-band interfering signal b5 becomes equal to the level of the spread signal a5.
    </p>
    <p num="32">
      In the above operation, an incidental reduction c5 occurs in the spread signal a5.
      <br/>
      However, the incidental reduction c5 is small enough, because the amount of the reduction in the power level of the narrow-band interfering signal b5 performed by the magnetostatic filter 13 is further lower than the amount of the power reduction performed by the magnetostatic filter 12.
    </p>
    <p num="33">
      The output of the magnetostatic filter 13 is applied to the mixer 7.
      <br/>
      The mixer 7 converts the received signal to a signal having a frequency equal to the difference between the original frequency and the frequency of the local signal supplied from a local oscillator 6.
      <br/>
      The converted signal is supplied to a demodulator (not shown).
    </p>
    <p num="34">In the spread spectrum communication device 1 having the structure described above, the saturation levels r1, r2 and r3 of the three magnetostatic filters 11, 12 and 13 are set to values decreasing in the order from r1 to r3 so that the narrow-band interfering signal is finally suppressed to a level equal to the level of the spread signal.</p>
    <p num="35">
      As described above, it is possible to limit the narrow-band interfering signal contained in the spread signal to a particular level while maintaining the incidental reduction to a sufficiently low degree, thereby achieving an improvement in the signal-to-noise ratio associated with the demodulated signal.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, it is possible to limit the narrow-band interfering signal across the entire frequency band of the spread signal using only one magnetostatic filter, and thus it is possible to realize a small-sized narrow-band interference signal elimination circuit.
    </p>
    <p num="36">
      In the specific embodiment described above with reference to FIG. 1, three magnetostatic filters are employed.
      <br/>
      However, the advantages and features of the invention may also be achieved by employing two or more magnetostatic filters.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, although in the above embodiment, the level of the narrow-band interfering signal is limited to the same value as the level of the spread signal, it may also be limited to a value higher or lower than the level of the spread signal.
    </p>
    <p num="37">
      FIG. 3 illustrates another embodiment of a spread spectrum communication device according to the present invention.
      <br/>
      In FIG. 3, elements similar or equivalent to those in the embodiment shown in FIG. 1 are denoted by similar reference numerals, and they are not described in further detail here.
      <br/>
      In the spread spectrum communication device 20 shown in FIG. 3, a narrow-band interference signal elimination circuit 21 comprises a variable amplifier 22, a divider 23, a level detection circuit 24, magnetostatic filters 25, 27, and 29, and amplifiers 26 and 28.
    </p>
    <p num="38">
      In the narrow-band interference signal elimination circuit 21, the input is connected to the divider 23 via the variable amplifier 22.
      <br/>
      One of the outputs of the divider 23 is connected to the output terminal via the magnetostatic filter 25, the amplifier 26, the magnetostatic filter 27, the amplifier 28, and the magnetostatic filter 29, while the other output is connected to the variable amplifier 22 via the level detection circuit 24.
    </p>
    <p num="39">
      The operation of the spread spectrum communication device 20 is described below referring to FIG. 3 and FIGS. 4(a)-4(g).
      <br/>
      FIGS. 4(a)-4(g) illustrate the spectrum of the spread signal and also that of the narrow-band interfering signal contained in the spread signal for various blocks of the spread spectrum communication device 20.
    </p>
    <p num="40">
      In FIG. 3, the spread signal received via the antenna 2 and containing the narrow-band interfering signal is applied to the bandpass filter 3 so as to remove unnecessary frequency components.
      <br/>
      The resultant signal is amplified by the amplifier 4 by a fixed amplification factor, and then applied to the narrow-band interference signal elimination circuit 21.
      <br/>
      FIG. 4(a) illustrates the spectrum of the signal input to the narrow-band interference signal elimination circuit 21.
      <br/>
      As can be seen, the signal applied to the narrow-band interference signal elimination circuit 21 includes a spread signal f1 having a frequency component spread across a wide frequency band and also a narrow-band interfering signal g1 having a signal level higher than that of the spread signal f1 and having a frequency component within the same frequency band.
      <br/>
      In FIGS. 4(a)-4(g), r4, r5 and r6 denote the saturation levels of the magnetostatic filters 25, 27 and 29, respectively.

      <br/>
      The level detection circuit 24 detects the level of the spread signal from the input signal, and controls the variable amplifier 22 so that the level of the spread signal input to the magnetostatic filter 25 becomes different by a fixed amount from the saturation level of the magnetostatic filter 25.
      <br/>
      FIG. 4(b) illustrates the spectrum of the signal input to the magnetostatic filter 25.
      <br/>
      That is, the amplification factor of the variable amplifier 22 is controlled so that the spread signal f2 has a particular level lower by a predetermined amount than the saturation level r4 of the magnetostatic filter 25.
      <br/>
      The narrow-band interfering signal g2 contained in the spread signal f2 is also amplified by the same amplification factor, and thus the signal level thereof becomes greater than the saturation level r4 of the magnetostatic filter 25.

    <p num="43">
      In the above operation, an incidental reduction h3 occurs in the spread signal f3.
      <br/>
      However, the incidental reduction h3 is small enough because there is a great difference between the saturation level r4 of the magnetostatic filter 25 and the level of the spread signal f3 although the narrow-band interfering signal g3 has a large power level before being limited in the power level.

      <br/>
      As shown in FIG. 4(d), the spread signal f4 is amplified to a level different by a predetermined amount from the saturation level r5 of the magnetostatic filter 27.

      This difference in the level is set so that it becomes smaller than the difference between the spread signal input to the magnetostatic filter 25 and the saturation level of the magnetostatic filter 25.

      <br/>
      However, in the present embodiment, unlike the narrow-band interference signal elimination circuit 5 according to the embodiment described above with reference to FIG. 1, the saturation levels of the two magnetostatic filters 27 and 29 may be set to arbitrary values by properly adjusting the amplification factors of the two amplifiers 26 and 28.

      In FIG. 5, the spread signal received via the antenna 2 and containing the narrow-band interfering signal is applied to the bandpass filter 3 so as to remove unnecessary frequency components.

      As shown in FIG. 6(a), the signal applied to the signal input to the narrow-band interference signal elimination circuit 31 includes a spread signal i1 having a frequency component spread across a wide frequency band and also a narrow-band interfering signal j1 having a signal level higher than that of the spread signal i1 and having a frequency component within the same frequency band.
      <br/>
      In FIGS. 6(a)-6(g), r7, r8 and r9 denote the saturation level of the magnetostatic filters 36, 38 and 40, respectively.

      The signal input to the narrow-band interference signal elimination circuit 31 is divided by the divider 32 into two signals, one of which is supplied to the variable amplifier 35 and the other is supplied to the level detection circuit 33.

      The level detection circuit 33 evaluates the received signal and detects the level of the spread signal and the maximum level of the narrow-band interfering signal.

      The result is applied to the amplification factor control circuit 34.
      <br/>
      From the level of the spread signal and the maximum level of the narrow-band interfering signal, the amplification factor control circuit 34 calculates the levels to which the narrow-band interfering signal should be limited by the respective magnetostatic filters and also calculates the amplification factors of the respective variable amplifiers required to achieve the these limitations.

      According to the calculation result, the amplification factor control circuit 34 controls the variable amplifiers 35, 37, and 39.

      In the above operation, an incidental reduction k3 occurs in the spread signal i3.

      In the spread spectrum communication device 30 having the structure described above, the saturation levels r7, r8, and r9 of three magnetostatic filters 36, 38, and 40 and the amplification factors of three variable amplifiers 35, 37, and 39 are selected such that the level of the narrow-band interfering signal is finally equal to the level of the spread signal.
      <br/>
      However, in the present embodiment, unlike the narrow-band interference signal elimination circuit 21 according to the previous embodiment described above with reference to FIG. 3, the level of the narrow-band interfering signal can be limited to an optimum value using all three magnetostatic filters regardless of the difference in level between the input spread signal and the maximum narrow-band interfering signal.
      <br/>
      That is, in the case of the narrow-band interference signal elimination circuit 21, when the maximum level of the narrow-band interfering signal is very high compared to the level of the spread signal, the amount of the power level reduction of the narrow-band interfering signal performed by the magnetostatic filter 25 at the first stage is greater than the amount of the power level reduction performed by the magnetostatic filter 27 or 29 at the second or third stage.
      <br/>
      Conversely, when the level of the narrow-band interfering signal is low, the amount of the power reduction performed by the magnetostatic filter 25 at the first stage can become very small.
      <br/>
      In contrast, in the narrow-band interference signal elimination circuit 31, the amounts of the power reductions performed by the respective magnetostatic filters are determined properly by the calculation so that the power level reduction of the narrow-band interfering signal is performed by an optimum amount at each magnetostatic filter.

      As described above, it is possible to limit the narrow-band interfering signal contained in the spread signal to a particular level while maintaining the incidental reduction in the spread signal to a sufficiently low degree thereby achieving an improvement in the signal-to-noise ratio associated with the demodulated signal.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, it is possible to limit the narrow-band interfering signal across the entire frequency band of the spread signal using only one magnetostatic filter, and thus it is possible to realize a small-sized narrow-band interference signal elimination circuit.

      In FIG. 7, elements similar or equivalent to those in the embodiment shown in FIG. 1 are denoted by similar reference numerals, and they are not described in further detail here.
      <br/>
      In the spread spectrum communication device 50 shown in FIG. 7, a narrow-band interference signal elimination circuit 51 comprises a variable amplifier 52, a divider 53, a level detection circuit 54, and a gradient saturation magnetostatic filter 55.

    </p>
    <p num="74">
      Referring to FIG. 8, the construction of the gradient saturation magnetostatic filter 55 is described below.
      <br/>
      As shown in FIG. 8, the gradient saturation magnetostatic filter 55 comprises: a YIG (yttrium iron garnet) film 55a formed on a GGG (gadolinium gallium garnet) substrate 55x; an input transducer 55b and an output transducer formed on the YIG film 55a; an input signal terminal 55d; an output signal terminal 55e; a ground terminal 55f; and bonding wires 55g.
      <br/>
      The width of the YIG film 55a decreases from the maximum width at the location where the input transducer 55b is formed to the minimum width at the location where the output transducer is formed.
      <br/>
      The input transducer 55b and the output transducer 55c are connected to the input signal terminal 55d and the output signal terminal 55e, receptively, via the bonding wires 55g.
      <br/>
      In FIG. 8, L denotes the distance and the direction in which magnetostatic waves propagate in the YIG film 55a.
    </p>
    <p num="75">
      In the gradient saturation magnetostatic filter 55 having the structure described above, an electric signal input via the input signal terminal 55d is converted by the input transducer 55b to a magnetostatic wave, and propagates in the YIG film 55a toward the output transducer 55c.
      <br/>
      The magnetostatic wave is again converted by the output transducer 55c into an electric signal, and is output via the output signal terminal 55e.
    </p>
    <p num="76">
      FIG. 9 illustrates the saturation characteristic of the gradient saturation magnetostatic filter 55 shown in FIG. 8.
      <br/>
      In FIG. 9, the horizontal axis represents the direction (distance) L in which the magnetostatic wave propagates, and the vertical axis represents the saturation level.
      <br/>
      The saturation level r10 of the gradient saturation magnetostatic filter 55 decreases with the propagation of the magnetostatic wave from the saturation level r11 at the location of the input transducer 55b to the saturation level r12 at the location of the output transducer 55c.
      <br/>
      As a result, signal components higher than the saturation level r12 are successively limited to the saturation level r12 as the magnetostatic wave propagates along the YIG film 55a.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the amount of incidental reduction of the spread signal can be significantly reduced.

      FIG. 10 illustrates another embodiment of a gradient saturation magnetostatic filter.

      As shown in FIG. 10, the YIG film 55g gradually decreases in thickness in the direction in which the magnetostatic wave propagates.

      <br/>
      The level detection circuit 54 detects the level of the spread signal from the input signal, and controls the variable amplifier 52 so that the level of the spread signal m2 applied to the gradient saturation magnetostatic filter 55 becomes equal to the level r12 of the minimum saturation level of the gradient saturation magnetostatic filter 55.
      <br/>
      FIG. 11(b) illustrates the spectrum of the signal input to the gradient saturation magnetostatic filter 55.

      As can be seen, the magnification factor of the variable amplifier 52 is controlled so that the level of the spread signal m2 becomes equal to the minimum saturation level r12 of the gradient saturation magnetostatic filter 55.
      <br/>
      The narrow-band interfering signal n2 contained in the spread signal m2 is also amplified by the same amplification factor, and thus the level of the narrow-band interfering signal n2 becomes greater than the maximum saturation level r11 of the gradient saturation magnetostatic filter 55.
    </p>
    <p num="81">
      The narrow-band interfering signal contained in the signal applied to the gradient saturation magnetostatic filter 55 is limited in the order from higher to lower levels successively as the magnetostatic wave propagates along the YIG film, and finally limited to a level equal to the level of the spread signal.

      FIG. 11(c) illustrates the spectrum of the signal output from the gradient saturation magnetostatic filter 55.

      As shown in FIG. 11(c), the level of the narrow-band interfering signal n3 becomes equal to the level of the spread signal m3.
    </p>
    <p num="82">
      In the above operation, an incidental reduction occurs in the spread signal m3.
      <br/>
      However, in this gradient saturation magnetostatic filter 55, the incidental reduction in the spread signal is not very great because the reduction of the narrow-band interfering signal is performed gradually.

      The signal output from the gradient saturation magnetostatic filter 55 is applied to the mixer 7.
      <br/>
      The mixer 7 converts the received signal to a signal having a frequency equal to the difference between the original frequency and the frequency of the local signal supplied from the local oscillator.

      As can be understood from the above description, the spread spectrum communication device according to the present invention has the following advantages.

      That is, when the spread signal includes a narrow-band interfering signal having a level in the frequency domain higher than the predetermined value, the level of the narrow-band interfering signal is limited to a value equal to the level of the spread signal thereby achieving an improved signal-to-noise ratio in the demodulated signal.
      <br/>
      The incidental reduction in the spread signal can be minimized by performing the operation of limiting the narrow-band interfering signal in a step-by-step fashion or a gradual fashion.

      Because the power level is limited in the frequency domain, a wide band operation is possible.
