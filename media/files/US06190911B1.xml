      A method for fabricating a semiconductor device having a wiring part connected via an opening portion formed in an insulting film on a semiconductor region to the semiconductor region.
      <br/>
      The wiring part includes a polycrystalline semiconductor layer and a metal or metal silicide on the semiconductor layer.
      <br/>
      A polycrystalline semiconductor layer is deposited over the opening portion of the semiconductor region.
      <br/>
      First and second impurities are respectively ion injected into the polycrystalline semiconductor layer, wherein the ion injecting range of the first impurities is longer than that of the second impurities, thereby forming a high concentration region at least on a surface side of the polycrystalline semiconductor layer.
      <br/>
      Following the ion injection of the first and second impurities, a heat treatment is conducted to grow crystals of the polycrystalline semiconductor layer.
      <br/>
      After the heat treatment, a metal or a metal silicide is deposited on the polycrystalline layer using a low melting point method.

      1.
      <br/>
      Field of the Invention
    </p>
    <p num="3">The present invention relates to semiconductor devices and fabrication methods thereof, and more particularly to semiconductor devices wherein the connection of the semiconductor device with the wiring is improved and to fabrication methods thereof.</p>
    <p num="4">2. Related Background Art</p>
    <p num="5">
      In recent years, as the higher integration of semiconductor devices has been made, the area of each part within a chip has been reduced, wherein it is an important problem to reduce the area of the wiring part because it occupies a large percentage of the chip area.
      <br/>
      Concerning the lead-out part to the wiring of a semi-conductor device or a so-called contact part, while it was conventionally practiced that after an ohmic contact material composed of group IV polycrystalline semi-conductor material was laid down at a position directly above the element, the electrode of a metal or metal silicide containing a low-melting metal such as Al and the group IV polycrystalline semiconductor material were joined off the position directly above the element.
      <br/>
      It is contemplated that a metal or metal silicide is also joined directly above the element at the same time.
    </p>
    <p num="6">On the other hand, a polycrystalline semiconductor material (e.g., group N) is undesirable to use as the lead-out wiring, because as the operation frequency of the element increases, the movement of carriers for carrying electric current can not follow it, whereby such a constitution is now being adopted that the electrode of metal or metal silicide is contacted directly above the element from the viewpoint of high speed operation.</p>
    <p num="7">
      However, a low-melting metal in the metal or metal silicide for use as low resistive wiring material greatly diffuses into polycrystalline semiconductor material, and when a metal or metal silicide contact is made directly above the element, the low-melting metal will diffuse into the element portion, bringing the above degradation of element characteristics in some cases.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, to suppress the diffusion of low-melting metal, a barrier metal may be disposed between the metal or metal silicide and polycrystalline semiconductor material.
      <br/>
      With this constitution, the diffusion of a low-melting metal is surely suppressed, and there is no degradation of element characteristics, but because of a step of depositing and patterning the barrier metal interposed, the process is more complex, with increased cost.
    </p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="8">An object of the present invention is to provide a semiconductor device and a fabrication method thereof, wherein with a structure and a method not involving any complex process and increased cost at the contact part of the semiconductor device, the diffusion of a low-melting metal can be suppressed without degradation of the element characteristics.</p>
    <p num="9">Also, it is another object of the present invention to provide a semiconductor device without degradation of the characteristics by preventing the diffusion of wiring metal to the element area of the semiconductor device, while simplifying the process by disposing wiring metal directly above the element area to eliminate unnecessary wiring.</p>
    <p num="10">Also, it is a further object of the present invention to provide a method for fabricating a semi-conductor device having a wiring part connected via an opening portion formed in an insulating film on a semi-conductor region to said semiconductor region, including the steps of:</p>
    <p num="11">
      depositing a polycrystalline semiconductor layer over said opening portion on said semiconductor region,
      <br/>
      ion injecting impurities having a large range into said polycrystalline semiconductor layer,
      <br/>
      ion injecting impurities having a small range into said polycrystalline semiconductor layer,
      <br/>
      conducting heat treatment after ion injection of said impurities, and
      <br/>
      depositing a metal or metal silicide containing a low-melting metal on said polycrystalline semi-conductor layer after said heat treatment.
    </p>
    <p num="12">
      Also, it is another object of the present invention to provide a semiconductor device comprised of a semiconductor region, an insulating film applied on said semiconductor region, and a wiring part connected via an opening portion formed in said insulating film to said semiconductor region,
      <br/>
      wherein said wiring part has disposed a metal or metal silicide at least containing a low-melting metal on an upper layer, and a polycrystalline semiconductor material containing p-type impurities on a lower layer, and at least one of the elements of germanium, tin, phosphorus, arsenic, antimony, gallium, and indium is injected into a group IV polycrystalline semiconductor material layer.

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
    <p num="14">The present invention can accomplish the aforementioned objects by using a fabrication method including the steps of ion injecting impurities having a large range into a polycrystalline semiconductor layer, and ion injecting impurities having a small range there-into.</p>
    <p num="15">Thereby, the impurity concentration near the surface of polycrystalline semiconductor layer can be especially raised.</p>
    <p num="16">Hence, the crystal having large crystal grain diameter can be formed particularly near the surface by heat treating the polycrystalline semiconductor layer such as polycrystalline silicon having such an impurity concentration distribution.</p>
    <p num="17">
      Typically, the diffusion of low-melting metal in the polycrystalline silicon can be made mostly through the grain boundary.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, as the crystal grain diameter increases, metal diffusion passages are reduced and the amount of diffusion is suppressed to a smaller value.

      FIG. 1 is a typical cross-sectional view showing the longitudinal structure of a contact part of a semi-conductor device.

      In this example, AlSi is used as one metal or metal silicide electrode 205, and polycrystalline silicon (polysilicon) is used as a polycrystalline semiconductor layer 203.

      FIG. 2A shows the Al concentration change from the surface of polycrystalline silicon 203 to semiconductor region 201 in the contact part made by a conventional fabrication method.
      <br/>
      Al has a concentration of 1 * 1018 atoms/cm3 or more within polycrystalline silicon 203, increasing at the interface between polycrystalline silicon 203 and semiconductor region 201.
      <br/>
      Also, it can be found that Al is also greatly diffused in the semiconductor region 201.

    <p num="26">
      On the contrary, FIG. 2B shows a distribution of the Al concentration at the contact part made by the fabrication method of the present invention.
      <br/>
      As shown in the figure, Al is blocked on the surface side of the polycrystalline silicon 203, wherein the Al concentration in the polycrystalline silicon 203 decreases toward the semiconductor region 201.
      <br/>
      Also, within the semiconductor region 201, the Al concentration can be suppressed to 1 * 1017 atoms/cm3 or less, i.e., a lower concentration by one order of magnitude.

    <p num="27">
      As described above, the diffusion of low-melting metal in polysilicon is typically made mostly through the grain boundary.
      <br/>
      Therefore, as the crystal grain diameter increases, metal diffusing passages are reduced, so that the amount of diffusion can be suppressed to a small value.
    </p>
    <p num="28">
      In the present invention, since the grain diameter of polysilicon which is a polycrystalline semiconductor material is greater than the conventional, the diffusion of metal has been suppressed.
      <br/>
      The grain diameter of polysilicon is determined by the recrystallization of polysilicon which occurs with the heat treatment after the injection of impurities, although recrystallization into a large grain diameter is more likely to occur if polysilicon is more amorphous in the state before recrystallization.
    </p>
    <p num="29">
      However, polysilicon will become amorphous upon impact of ion injection, but in the case of B which is a typical p-type impurity, for example, polysilicon does not greatly become amorphous only by the injection of B, because the mass of that ion is light.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, in the present invention, when a p-type is made, polysilicon is made more amorphous by injecting in advance germanium, tin, phosphorus, arsenic, antimony, gallium, or indium having a greater mass than B and not producing many defect levels in the semiconductor, and then the crystal of large grain diameter is produced with the heat treatment after the injection of p-type impurities.
      <br/>
      Further, the channeling of B can be suppressed by making polysilicon more amorphous before the injection of B, wherein there is an additional effect that the region to be made p-type may not be deeper than necessary.
    </p>
    <p num="30">
      Also, if the concentration of germanium, tin, phosphorus, antimony, gallium, or indium within polysilicon is 1 * 1019 atoms/cm3 or more, amorphous conversion will significantly progress to make polysilicon having a large grain diameter, and if the amorphous conversion is made to a depth of about 1000  Angstrom , the diffusion of low-melting metal can be suppressed.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, to realize the present invention more securely, it is desirable to add at least one of the elements of germanium, tin, phosphorus, antimony, gallium and indium such that the amount is 5 * 1019 atoms/cm3 or more at a depth of 1000  Angstrom  from the surface of polysilicon, and the concentration of the element does not exceed the concentration of B over the entire area of polysilicon.

    <p num="31">The low-melting metal contained in a metal or metal silicide for use with the present invention may be typically any of the metals belonging to groups IIB to IIIA, examples of which may include Al, Mg, Cu, Ag, Au, Zn and Cd.</p>
    <p num="32">For the injection of n-type impurities into polycrystalline silicon or polycrystalline silicon germanium, the injection impurity having a large range may be preferably high energy P, and the injection impurity having a small range may be preferably low energy P, as well as As, Sb, and Bi.</p>
