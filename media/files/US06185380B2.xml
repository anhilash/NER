      <br/>
      An image forming apparatus which is able to form either single or double sided copies on a recording medium while achieving an excellent image quality in either a matted or glossy finish.
      <br/>
      The image forming apparatus includes a fixing portion in which a first roller includes a first temperature and hardness for forming a matted image, whereas a second roller includes a higher temperature and hardness for forming a glossy image.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, or in addition, to different hardness and temperatures, the recording medium can be conveyed at a first speed to form a matted image, and a slower speed to form a glossy image.
      <br/>
      The image forming apparatus further includes an inverse and re-fixing sub-mode, which utilizes an inverting and returning passage, for reducing the curl in a recording medium, and thus also reducing the instances in which clogging takes place.
      <br/>
      The inverting and returning passage has a length sufficient to accommodate a plurality of recording mediums.
      <br/>
      Moreover, the image forming apparatus is provided with first and second discharge passages so that if one passage is clogged, the other can be used to discharge recording mediums.
      <br/>
      A switching means selects, based on detection sensors, through which discharge passage a recording medium is fed.
      <br/>
      The operations of the image forming apparatus are coordinated by a control unit.

      In general, image forming apparatuses have widely been known which incorporate a fixing unit for conveying a recording medium while heating and applying pressure to the recording medium.
      <br/>
      The apparatus is arranged such that a non-fixed image formed by a developer, such as toner, is formed on the surface of the recording medium after which the recording medium is allowed to pass through a fixing unit having a pair of rollers so that an image is fixed to the recording medium.
    </p>
    <p num="7">Devices for use with an image forming apparatus of the above-mentioned type have been known, for example, as in Japanese Patent Publication No. 5-48917 and Japanese Patent Publication No. 6-68646. These devices attempted to improve the fixing characteristic by selectively (as necessary) allowing a recording medium to pass through a fixing unit two times.</p>
    <p num="8">
      One of the two types of the image forming apparatuses which has been disclosed in Japanese Patent Publication No. 6-68646 has a double-side mode for forming images on two sides of a recording medium and a single-side mode for forming an image on either side of the recording medium.
      <br/>
      When a glossy image is formed on an OHP film in the single-side mode, the OHP film is allowed to pass through the fixing unit two times.
      <br/>
      Thus, a glossy image can be obtained.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      Specifically, the apparatus disclosed in Japanese Patent Publication No. 6-68646 has a structure in which a plurality of recording mediums, on which images are formed on one side, are temporarily accumulated in an intermediate tray so that images can be formed on both sides of the recording medium, in the double-side mode.
      <br/>
      Each recording medium is again supplied from the intermediate tray to the image forming portion so as to form an image on the other side.
      <br/>
      Thus, images are formed on both sides of each recording medium.
      <br/>
      However, when a glossy image is formed on an OHP film, a plurality of the OHP films are temporarily accumulated in the intermediate tray.
      <br/>
      Then, each OHP film is again fed to the fixing unit from the intermediate tray.
      <br/>
      But, when a plurality of OHP films are stacked and accumulated in the intermediate tray, the OHP films easily adhere to one another.
      <br/>
      Because the OHP films easily adhere to one another, there arises a clogging problem in the feeding operation, or undesirable stacking easily takes place.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      Further, when a separating agent is applied to the fixing roller, in Japanese Publication No. 6-68646, the separating agent adheres to the surface of the recording medium.
      <br/>
      Since the recording medium in the form of a resin sheet, such as an OHP sheet, has a poor oil absorbing characteristic, the OHP sheets furthermore easily adhere to one another when the OHP sheets are stacked on the intermediate tray.
      <br/>
      Thus, problems easily arise in the feeding operation, or stacking easily takes place.
      <br/>
      Also, since a space for the paper feeding tray is required, there arises another problem in that the size of the apparatus cannot be reduced.
    </p>
    <p num="11">
      When a color image is formed, toner images in a plurality of colors (for example, yellow, magenta, cyan and black) superimposed on the recording medium must be melted and fixed.
      <br/>
      Since a great heat capacity is required, a known fixing unit is structured such that a recording medium is allowed to pass through the fixing unit at relatively low speed.
      <br/>
      See for example, Japanese Patent Publication No. 6-40235.
    </p>
    <p num="12">An image forming apparatus capable of forming images on two sides of paper sheets, a two-side copying machine as disclosed in Japanese Patent Publication No. 61-11865, for example, has been known.</p>
    <p num="13">
      As shown in FIG. 9(a), a typical double-side copying machine has a structure that an original document 1 is irradiated with a lamp 2.
      <br/>
      Reflected light is imaged on a photosensitive drum 3 so that an electrostatic latent image is formed on the photosensitive drum 3.
      <br/>
      The electrostatic latent image is visualized into a powder image or the like by a developing unit 4 so as to be transferred to copying paper 7 fed from paper feeders 5 and 6.
      <br/>
      The powder image is then fixed to the copying paper 7 by a fixing unit 8.
      <br/>
      The copying paper 7 is allowed to pass through a passage 9, and is then moved to a right-side/reverse-side converting unit 10.
      <br/>
      If a single-side final copy is desired, the copying paper 7 is allowed to pass through a paper-discharge passage 11 and a deflector 12.
      <br/>
      The copying paper 7 is then discharged to the upper surface of a paper-discharge tray 13 disposed on the body of the apparatus.
    </p>
    <p num="14">
      If a double-side final copy is desired, the copying paper 7 having a powder image formed by the fixing unit 8 is allowed to pass through the passage 9, and is then moved to the right-side/reverse-side converting unit 10.
      <br/>
      After the leading end of the copying paper 7 has temporarily been introduced into the paper-discharge passage 11, the copying paper 7 is moved inversely such that the copying paper 7 is allowed to pass through an inverse passage 14.
      <br/>
      Thus, the copying paper 7 is stacked and accommodated in an accommodating portion 15.
      <br/>
      The operation for stacking copying paper in the accommodating portion 15 continues until images are copied on one side of a predetermined number of paper sheets.
    </p>
    <p num="15">
      After the operation for copying one side of all of the copying paper sheets has been completed, the copying paper 7 stacked in the accommodating portion 15 is allowed to pass through a re-feeding passage 17 by a paper-supply roller 16 so as to again be moved to the photosensitive drum 3.
      <br/>
      A powder image is then formed on the other side, after which the copying paper 7 passes through the fixing unit 8 as well as the right-side/reverse-side converting unit 10 and is moved to the paper-discharge passage 11.
    </p>
    <p num="16">
      FIG. 9(b) is a diagram showing an example of the right-side/reverse-side converting unit described above.
      <br/>
      The right-side/reverse-side converting unit has a drive roller 18 and conveying rollers 19, 20 disposed at the inlet and outlet portions thereof.
      <br/>
      A drive roller 21 and a movable roller 22 are disposed in the rear of the right-side/reverse-side converting unit.
      <br/>
      A deflecting plate 23 is disposed between the drive roller 18 and the drive roller 21.
      <br/>
      The deflecting plate 23 is rotatively supported by a shaft 23a such that the deflecting plate 23 is always urged clockwise by a spring (not shown).
    </p>
    <p num="17">The operation of the right-side/reverse-side converting unit will now be described.</p>
    <p num="18">
      (i) When the copying paper 7 moved from the fixing unit 8 through the passage 9 is moved to the paper-discharge passage 11, all of the rollers are rotated in a direction (forward direction) indicated by an arrow shown in the drawing.
      <br/>
      Thus, the copying paper 7 discharged from the fixing unit 8 is moved to the paper-discharge passage 11 by the drive roller 18, the conveying roller 19, the drive roller 21 and the movable roller 22.
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      (ii) When passage of the trailing end 7a2 of the copying paper 7a moved in the forward direction through the leading end of the deflecting plate 23 has been detected by the detecting portion 24, the drive roller 21 and the movable roller 22 disposed in the rear of the detecting portion 24 are reversely rotated.
      <br/>
      The trailing end 7a2 of the copying paper 7a is guided by the deflecting plate 23 so as to be introduced into a position between the drive roller 18 and the conveying roller 20.
    </p>
    <p num="20">(iii) When the trailing end 7a2 of the copying paper 7a is detected by detecting portion 25, thereby indicating that the copying paper 7 has reached a position between the drive roller 18 and the conveying roller 20, the movable roller 22 is moved upwards to separate it from drive roller 21.</p>
    <p num="21">
      Once a space is formed between the drive roller 21 and the movable roller 22, the next copying paper 7b is conveyed to the paper-discharge passage 11 by the drive roller 18 and the conveying roller 19.
      <br/>
      At this time, a leading end 7b1 of the next copying paper 7b is guided by the upper surface of the preceding copying paper 7a.
    </p>
    <p num="22">
      (iv) When the leading end 7a1 of the preceding copying paper 7a has been allowed to pass through the position between the drive roller 21 and the movable roller 22, the movable roller 22 is moved downwards.
      <br/>
      Moreover, the drive roller 21 is rotated forward so that the next copying paper 7b is conveyed until the trailing end 7b2 of the copying paper 7b is allowed to pass through the detecting portion 24.
    </p>
    <p num="23">The above-mentioned operation is then repeated as necessary.</p>
    <p num="24">
      After the image has been formed on either one or both sides of a paper sheet, it must be discharged from the apparatus.
      <br/>
      An image forming apparatus therefore not only incorporates an image forming portion, but also incorporates a paper supply portion, a paper discharge passage and a receiving portion.
      <br/>
      The paper supply portion may include a paper feeding cassette or a paper supply tray, for supplying paper sheets to the image forming portion.
      <br/>
      The paper discharge passage discharges the paper sheet on which an image has been formed by the image forming portion.
      <br/>
      The receiving portion, such as a paper discharge tray, receives the paper sheet discharged from the paper discharge passage.
    </p>
    <p num="25">
      In a typical apparatus, a paper-sheet conveying passage (including the paper discharge passage) is formed from the paper supply portion to the receiving portion through the image forming portion.
      <br/>
      The paper sheet is sometimes clogged in the paper-sheet conveying passage.
    </p>
    <p num="26">
      If paper sheets are still conveyed after one paper sheet has been clogged, the clogging is exacerbated.
      <br/>
      The clog may be exacerbated to the point where there is a risk of breaking the apparatus.
      <br/>
      Therefore, an apparatus of the foregoing type is usually provided with a detection means for detecting clogging of a paper sheet.
      <br/>
      If the detection means detects clogging of a paper sheet, the operation of the apparatus is interrupted.
      <br/>
      Moreover, a message (alarm sound and/or display on a display portion of an operation panel) indicates occurrence of clogging to a user.
      <br/>
      Then, the apparatus awaits removal of the clogged paper sheet, whereupon the apparatus again becomes operational.
    </p>
    <p num="27">
      Some apparatuses are capable of forming images at high speed.
      <br/>
      These image forming apparatuses mainly use electrophotographic technology and sometimes encounter continued conveyance of paper sheets in the conveying passage even when a paper sheet is clogged therein.
      <br/>
      In this case, the user is undersirably caused to remove paper sheets which are not clogged.
      <br/>
      Removal of the sheets which are not clogged is a demanding task.
    </p>
    <p num="28">
      To overcome the problem of requiring a user to remove the sheets which are not clogged, a copying machine has been suggested in Examined Japanese Patent Publication No. 6-1394. There, a drive mechanism of a conveying system is started to discharge the paper sheets, which are not clogged, to a tray.
      <br/>
      The discharge of sheets occurs after clogging has taken place and a copy start button is again depressed.
    </p>
    <p num="29">&lt;Problem 1&gt;</p>
    <p num="30">In a conventional image forming apparatus, a recording medium allowed to pass through a fixing unit is undesirably curled.</p>
    <p num="31">
      The conventional image forming apparatuses disclosed in Japanese Patent Publication No. 5-48917 and Japanese Patent Publication No. 6-68646 have a structure in which the recording medium is not turned inside out when the recording medium, having an image formed on one side thereof, is allowed to pass through the fixing unit two times.
      <br/>
      Therefore, curls of the recording medium are accumulated and enlarged, causing the recording medium to easily clog in the conveying passage.
      <br/>
      As noted above, a clogged conveying passage is undesirable.
    </p>
    <p num="32">
      In recent years, users have required an apparatus for fixing a matted image (delustered image) or a glossy image (a bright image) upon demand.
      <br/>
      A matted image is obtained by preventing complete melting of the toner image.
      <br/>
      A matted image can thus be obtained by fixing the matted image with a relatively small quantity of heat.
      <br/>
      A glossy image is obtained by completely melting the toner image.
      <br/>
      Therefore, a glossy image can be obtained by fixing the toner image with a relatively large quantity of heat.
    </p>
    <p num="33">The conventional technologies also encounter problems in meeting user requirements for both matted and glossy images as follows.</p>
    <p num="34">
      A first type of apparatus is structured such that the recording medium selectively passes through the fixing unit two times.
      <br/>
      Examples of the type of apparatus are disclosed in Japanese Patent Publication No. 5-48917 and Japanese Patent Publication No. 6-68646).
      <br/>
      This type of apparatus attempts to form a matted image by passing the recording medium, having a non-fixed image formed thereon, through the fixing unit only one time when a matted image is required.
      <br/>
      When a glossy image is required, this type of apparatus passes the recording medium through the fixing unit two times.
      <br/>
      However, in both cases, image (either matted or glossy) which is formed on the recording medium is brought into contact with only the same roller.
    </p>
    <p num="35">
      When a matted image having an excellent image quality is required, it is preferable that the surface of the image be somewhat rough by not completely melting the toner particles on the surface of the image.
      <br/>
      To cause a somewhat rough state in the toner particles, it is preferable that the surface layer of the roller, which is brought into contact with the surface of the image, have a relatively low hardness.
    </p>
    <p num="36">
      When a glossy image having an excellent image quality is required, it is preferable that the toner on the surface of the image be completely melted and smoothed.
      <br/>
      To smooth the surface of the toner it is preferable that the hardness of the surface layer of the roller, which is brought into contact with the surface of the image, have a relatively high hardness.
    </p>
    <p num="37">
      Thus it can be seen that the above-mentioned conventional technologies having a structure in which the image (either matted or glossy) formed on the recording medium is brought into contact with the same roller, cannot easily and selectively form a matted image and a glossy image.
      <br/>
      If the hardness of the surface layer of the roller is made to be relatively low, a glossy image having a satisfactory image quality cannot be obtained even though an excellent matted image can be obtained.
      <br/>
      Similarly, if the hardness of the surface layer of the roller is made to be relatively high, a matted image having an excellent image quality cannot be obtained even though a satisfactory glossy image can be obtained.
    </p>
    <p num="38">The above-mentioned problems are also experienced with the conventional technology disclosed in Japanese Patent Publication No. 6-40235. Thus, the conventional technologies based on one roller having a set hardness, cannot selectively form a matted image or a glossy image having an excellent image quality.</p>
    <p num="39">&lt;Problem 2&gt;</p>
    <p num="40">
      Apparatuses arranged such that the recording medium is allowed to selectively pass through the fixing unit two times are disclosed in Japanese Patent Publication No. 5-48917 and Japanese Patent Publication No. 6-68646. These apparatuses have a structure in which the recording medium is allowed to pass through the fixing unit one or two times under the same fixing condition (fixing pressure, fixing temperature and fixing speed).
      <br/>
      Therefore, a matted image or a glossy image cannot selectively be obtained.
    </p>
    <p num="41">
      If a fixing condition is set such that a matted image can be obtained in one pass, a glossy image cannot easily be obtained after the passing operation is performed two times under the same fixing condition.
      <br/>
      The reason is that heat is radiated from the recording medium and the toner image during the period between the first pass and the second pass.
      <br/>
      Although a glossy image can be obtained by performing the passing operation two or more times, there is risk that an excessively large number of times may be required to do so.
    </p>
    <p num="42">If the fixing condition is set such that a glossy image can be obtained by performing the passing operation, for example, two times, the quantity of heat is too much to obtain a matted image after the passing operation has been performed one time under the same fixing condition.</p>
    <p num="43">As can be understood from the foregoing description, the conventional technologies, based on the number of times a sheet is fed, cannot easily and selectively obtain a matted image or a glossy image.</p>
    <p num="44">
      Another conventional technology, disclosed in Japanese Patent Publication No. 6-40235, attempts to form a matted image by allowing a recording medium having a non-fixed image formed thereon to pass through a fixing unit at relatively high speed.
      <br/>
      When a glossy image is required, the apparatus attempts to form such glossy image by passing the recording medium through the fixing unit at relatively low speed.
      <br/>
      However, this type of conventional apparatus is arranged such that the recording medium is allowed to pass through the fixing unit only one time and thus cannot easily obtain a glossy image having a high image quality although a matted image can be obtained.
    </p>
    <p num="45">
      Where a glossy image is obtained by allowing a recording medium to pass through a fixing unit at low speed, a large quantity of heat is supplied.
      <br/>
      If a large quantity of heat is supplied over a long period of time, so-called offset easily takes place wherein toner adheres to the fixing unit (for example, a fixing roller).
      <br/>
      Thus, the quality of the image easily deteriorates.
    </p>
    <p num="46">
      Therefore, the above-mentioned conventional technology, based on sheet feeding speed, cannot easily and selectively obtain a matted image or a glossy image having an excellent image quality.
      <br/>
      When a glossy image is required, another problem arises in that the conveying speed of the recording medium, is reduced undesirably.
    </p>
    <p num="47">&lt;Problem 3&gt;</p>
    <p num="48">
      The double-side copying machine disclosed in Japanese Patent Publication No. 61-11865 as shown in FIG. 9 (b) is structured such that when the next copying paper 7b is introduced simultaneously with the discharge of the preceding copying paper 7a from the right-side/reverse-side converting unit 10, the leading end 7b1 of the next copying paper 7b is guided by the upper surface of the preceding copying paper 7a.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the reverse side (the side on which no image has been formed) of the next copying paper 7b and the upper surface (the side on which an image has been formed) of the preceding copying paper 7a are brought into slidable contact with each other.
    </p>
    <p num="49">This structure gives rise to a problem in that both the reverse side of the next copying paper 7b and the upper surface of the preceding copying paper 7a are contaminated (as a result of which both of the sides of copying paper sheets following the copying paper 7b are contaminated).</p>
    <p num="50">
      If the copying paper is plain paper which has been electrostatically charged or thin paper, or if the copying paper is paper, such as a postcard or an envelope, which can strongly be curled, the leading end 7b1 of the next copying paper 7b cannot appropriately be guided by the upper surface of the preceding copying paper 7a.
      <br/>
      As a result, there arises a problem in that clogging of paper easily takes place.
    </p>
    <p num="51">
      The copying machine disclosed in Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 6-1394 is structured to simply discharge paper sheets, that follow the paper sheet which has caused clogging, to the tray.
      <br/>
      Similarly to the conventional and usual image forming apparatuses, the copying machine in Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 6-1394 has a structure in which the operation for forming images is temporarily interrupted if a paper sheet is clogged.

      The conveying means is provided downstream of the introducing and discharging means in a direction in which the paper sheet is introduced.
      <br/>
      Therefore, introduction and discharging of recording mediums can furthermore reliably be performed.
      <br/>
      As a result of increased reliability, the rate of occurrence of clogging is reduced.

    <p num="74">
      The introducing and discharging means incorporates a drive roller disposed between the first and second passages, a first follower roller pressed against the drive roller at a position adjacent to the first passage, a second follower roller pressed against the drive roller at a position adjacent to the second passage and a switching guide disposed rotatively about a shaft disposed between the first and second passages and having a leading end facing the first follower roller or the second follower roller.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the recording medium which must be introduced into the first passage or the second passage is reliably guided by the switching guide.

      Therefore, the structure of the conveying means is simplified and more compact, thus saving space.

    <p num="76">To achieve the above-mentioned a fourth object, an image forming apparatus of the present invention includes:</p>
    <p num="77">a receiving portion for receiving recording mediums discharged after images have been formed on the recording mediums;</p>
    <p num="78">a first paper-discharge passage for discharging, to the receiving portion, the recording medium on which images have been formed;</p>
    <p num="79">a second paper-discharging passage for discharging, to the receiving portion, the recording mediums on which images have been formed such that the recording mediums are discharged independently from the first paper-discharge passage;</p>
    <p num="80">switching means for introducing the recording mediums, on which images have been formed, to either of the first paper-discharge passage or the second paper-discharge passage;</p>
    <p num="81">inlet-portion detection means for detecting when the trailing end of the recording medium introduced into the first paper-discharge passage or the second paper-discharge passage has passed through an inlet portion of the paper-discharge passage;</p>

    <p num="83">control means for switching the switching means to the other paper discharge passage when clogging of the recording medium has been detected by the clogging detection means and passage of the trailing end of the paper sheet has been detected by the inlet-portion detection means.</p>
    <p num="84">To achieve the above-mentioned objects, an image forming apparatus of the present invention includes:</p>
    <p num="85">a nipping portion, between the first and second rollers, is formed into a recess facing a roller which is brought into contact with an image forming surface of the recording medium which is allowed to finally pass through the fixing unit in: a) the inverse and re-fixing sub-mode; or b) a case where the recording medium having an image formed on either side thereof is allowed to pass through the fixing unit plural times; when the recess is viewed from an axial direction of the recess.</p>
    <p num="86">
      The image forming apparatus of the present invention also has a structure in which a non-fixed image is formed on the surface of a recording medium.
      <br/>
      Then, the recording medium is allowed to pass through the fixing unit so as to be conveyed while being heated and applied with pressure by the fixing unit.
      <br/>
      Thus the non-fixed image is fixed to the recording medium such that a plurality of the number of times is selected.
    </p>
    <p num="87">
      The image forming apparatus has an image forming portion for forming a non-fixed image on the recording medium.
      <br/>
      The recording medium is conveyed by the first and second rollers of the fixing unit while being heated and applied with pressure.
      <br/>
      The first and second rollers each have a surface layer.
      <br/>
      Thus, the non-fixed image is fixed to the recording medium.
    </p>
    <p num="88">
      In the case of a double-side mode, images are formed on both sides of the recording medium.
      <br/>
      In the case of a single-side mode, an image is formed on only one side of the recording medium, but that one side may be either side of the recording medium.
    </p>
    <p num="89">
      When the inverse and re-fixing sub-mode is selected in the single-side mode, the recording medium allowed to pass through the fixing unit one time is turned inside out and allowed to again pass through the fixing unit at least one more time.
      <br/>
      The recording medium may thus be allowed to finally pass an even number of times.
      <br/>
      Therefore, accumulation of curls of the recording medium is prevented.
    </p>
    <p num="90">
      The image forming apparatus of the present invention has a double-side mode and a single-side mode.
      <br/>
      Although a recording medium can be allowed to pass through the fixing unit several times in the single-side mode, clogging of the recording medium does not easily take place.
    </p>
    <p num="91">
      The first roller is a roller which is brought into contact with the non-fixed image on the recording medium when the recording medium is allowed to pass through the fixing unit at the first pass.
      <br/>
      The second roller is a roller which is brought into contact with the image on the recording medium when the recording medium is allowed to pass through the fixing unit at the second pass.
      <br/>
      The hardness of the surface layer of the second roller is higher than that of the surface layer of the first roller.
      <br/>
      As an alternative, or in addition to the difference in surface hardness, the temperature of the surface of the second roller is higher than the temperature of the surface of the first roller.
      <br/>
      Therefore, a matted image or a glossy image having an excellent image quality can selectively be obtained.
    </p>
    <p num="92">
      More specifically, the image forming apparatus of the present invention enables a matted image to be obtained by allowing a recording medium having a non-fixed image formed in, for example, the single-side mode (except for the inverse and re-fixing sub-mode), to pass through the fixing unit one time.
      <br/>
      As the recording medium passes through the fixing unit, the non-fixed image on the recording medium is brought into contact with the first roller having the surface layer with a relatively low hardness and/or a relatively low temperature.
      <br/>
      Therefore, a somewhat rough state is realized by toner particles which have been left on the surface of the image and have not completely been melted.
      <br/>
      As a result, a matted image having an excellent image quality is obtained.
    </p>
    <p num="93">
      To obtain a glossy image, the recording medium having a non-fixed image formed in the inverse and re-fixing sub-mode is allowed to pass through the fixing unit one time so that a matted image is formed.
      <br/>
      Then, the recording medium is turned inside out, and is allowed to again pass through the fixing unit at least one more time (i.e., two or more times in total).
      <br/>
      Thus, a relatively large quantity of heat is supplied so that the matted image is formed into a glossy image.
      <br/>
      Thus, a glossy image is obtained.
      <br/>
      Since the matted image on the recording medium is brought into contact with the second roller incorporating the surface layer with a relatively high hardness and/or a relatively high temperature, the surface of the toner image which has completely been melted is smoothed.
      <br/>
      As a result, a glossy image having an excellent image quality is obtained.
    </p>
    <p num="94">
      Specifically, the foregoing image forming apparatus enables the matted image by allowing a recording medium having a non-fixed image formed in, for example, the single-side mode (except for the inverse and re-fixing sub-mode) to pass through the fixing unit one time.
      <br/>
      Since the non-fixed image on the recording medium is brought into contact with the first roller having the relatively low temperature, a matted image having an excellent image quality is easily obtained.

    <p num="95">
      When a glossy image is desired, a recording medium having a non-fixed image formed in the inverse and re-fixing sub-mode is allowed to pass through the fixing unit one time so that a matted image is formed.

    <p num="96">
      In contrast to the conventional technology disclosed in Japanese Patent Publication No. 6-40235, it is not necessary to reduce the speed at which the recording medium is allowed to pass through the fining unit of the present invention.
      <br/>
      Therefore, a glossy image having an excellent image quality can be obtained at a relatively high speed if desired.
    </p>
    <p num="97">
      However, a glossy image can also be produced by varying the speed of conveyance as follows.
      <br/>
      When the recording medium is allowed to pass through the fixing unit plural times, the conveying speed at which the recording medium is conveyed by the fixing unit at second and following conveying operations is lower than the conveying speed at a first conveying operation.
      <br/>
      Therefore, a glossy image having an excellent image quality can easily be obtained.
    </p>
    <p num="98">Specifically, the foregoing image forming apparatus enables a matted image to be obtained by allowing a recording medium having a non-fixed image formed thereon to pass through the fixing unit one time at relatively high speed.</p>

      When a glossy image is desired, the recording medium having a non-fixed image formed thereon is allowed to pass through the fixing unit one time at relatively high speed.

      Then, the recording medium is allowed to pass through the fixing unit at relatively low speed at the second and following conveying operations.
      <br/>
      Thus, a great quantity of heat is supplied so that the matted image is formed into a glossy image.
      <br/>
      Thus, the glossy image is obtained.
    </p>
    <p num="100">
      When the recording medium is allowed to pass through the fixing unit at the second or following time, the recording medium has already been allowed to pass through the fixing unit one time.
      <br/>
      Since the developer, such as toner, is melted to a degree with which the matted image can be obtained at the first fixing operation, cohesive force between developers and the bonding strength between the developer and the recording medium have considerably been enlarged as compared with those of the non-fixed image.
      <br/>
      Therefore, even when a large quantity of heat is supplied by the second roller having the relatively high temperature, or low conveying speed, offset does not easily take place.
    </p>
    <p num="101">
      Therefore, when a glossy image, in particular, a color image, is formed by the image forming apparatus of the present invention, a greater quantity of heat is supplied by the second roller so that a glossy image having excellent color developing characteristic, transparency and luster is obtained.

      Therefore, a glossy image having an excellent image quality is easily obtained with a small number of fixing operations.

    <p num="102">
      The present invention also prevents clogging of the recording medium.
      <br/>
      When the recording medium is allowed to pass through the fixing unit plural times, the recording medium is allowed to pass through the fixing unit one time, and then the recording medium is turned inside out at the second and following conveying operations.
      <br/>
      Therefore, accumulation of curls of the recording medium is prevented although the recording medium is allowed to pass through the fixing unit plural times.
      <br/>
      Therefore, clogging of the recording medium is satisfactorily prevented.
    </p>
    <p num="103">
      In the related art, by contrast, a recording medium allowed to pass through a fixing unit is curled.
      <br/>
      The technologies disclosed in Japanese Patent Publication No. 5-48917 and Japanese Patent Publication No. 6-68646 have a structure in which the recording medium having an image on either side thereof is allowed to pass through the fixing unit two times.
      <br/>
      However, the recording medium is not turned inside out.
      <br/>
      Therefore, there arises a problem in that the recording medium is curled excessively, causing recording mediums to easily clog in a conveying passage.
    </p>
    <p num="104">
      The image forming apparatus of the present invention is structured such that when the recording medium is allowed to pass through the fixing unit plural times, the recording medium is first allowed to pass through the fixing unit one time in a first orientation.
      <br/>
      The recording medium is then turned inside out for the second and following conveying operations.
      <br/>
      Therefore, accumulation of curls of the recording medium is prevented although the recording medium is allowed to pass through the fixing unit multiple times.
      <br/>
      Therefore, clogging of the recording medium does not easily take place.

    <p num="105">
      In the image forming apparatus of the present invention, the inverse and re-fixing sub-mode is a mode in which the recording medium is allowed to pass through the fixing unit an even number of times, and the shape of a nipping portion between the first and second rollers is formed into a recess facing the second roller when the recess is viewed from the axial direction of the nipping portion.
      <br/>
      Therefore, when the recording medium is finally allowed to pass through the fixing unit, the recording medium is moved such that the recording medium is caused to face a direction in which the recording medium is separated from the surface of the second roller which is brought into contact with the image forming surface of the recording medium.
    </p>
    <p num="106">
      Moreover, the second roller is made of resin having a releasing characteristic.
      <br/>
      Therefore, winding of the recording medium around the second roller in the inverse and re-fixing sub-mode can satisfactorily be prevented.
    </p>
    <p num="107">
      Therefore, winding of the recording medium around the second roller is satisfactorily prevented by the present invention.

      The inverse and re-fixing sub-mode is selected in accordance with the type of the recording medium or the type of the image which is obtained after a fixing process has been completed.
      <br/>

      The image forming apparatus further includes an inverting and returning passage for turning inside out the recording medium allowed to pass through the fixing unit one time in the double-side mode and again returning the recording medium to the image forming portion.
      <br/>
      The inverting and returning passage is employed as a passage through which the recording medium is turned inside out and again returned to the fixing unit.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the structure of the passage is simplified and the size of the apparatus is reduced.

    <p num="110">
      The inverting and returning passage has a length sufficient to accommodate a plurality of recording mediums.

      <br/>
      Moreover, clogging of the recording medium in the inverse and re-fixing sub-mode is satisfactorily prevented.

      In contrast, the apparatus disclosed in Japanese Patent Publication No. 6-68646 has a structure in which the double-side mode for forming images on both sides of the recording medium is performed such that a plurality of recording mediums each having an image on either side thereof are accumulated in an intermediate tray.
      <br/>
      Then, the recording medium is again supplied from the intermediate tray to the image forming portion so as to form an image on the other side.

      However, when a glossy image is formed on an OHP film in the single-side mode in which an image is formed on either side of the recording medium, a plurality of OHP films are temporarily accumulated in the intermediate tray.
      <br/>
      Then, the OHP film is again supplied from the intermediate tray to the fixing unit.

      The recording medium having an image on either side is, by the introducing and discharging means, temporarily introduced into the first passage or the second passage, and then discharged.
      <br/>
      The discharged recording medium is allowed to pass through the returning passage so as to be returned to the image forming portion.

      <br/>
      The image forming apparatus of the present invention incorporates guide means disposed between the first passage and the second passage.
      <br/>
      The guide means makes the first passage and the second passage independent passages, separated from each other.
      <br/>
      Therefore, slidable contact between recording mediums which are introduced into the first passage or the second passage or discharged from the same is prevented.

      The recording medium which is introduced into the first passage or the second passage or discharged from the same is guided by the guide means.

      The first and second passages are composed of first and second paper-discharge passages capable of independently discharging the recording medium.
      <br/>
      Therefore, a recording medium introduced into the first passage or the second passage is moved to the returning passage or discharged to the receiving portion.
    </p>
    <p num="118">
      Moreover, the recording medium introduced into the first passage or the second passage can be selectively moved to the returning passage or discharged to the receiving portion.

      If the inlet-portion detection means is not provided and therefore the switching means is switched to the other paper discharge passage though the trailing end of the recording medium has not passed the inlet portion of the paper discharge passage, the trailing end of the paper sheet exists in the inlet portion (a position adjacent to the inlet portion of the other paper discharge passage) of each paper discharge passage which is the branching portion between the first and second paper-discharge passages.
      <br/>
      Therefore, there is a risk that the foregoing trailing end is brought into contact with the leading end of the following recording medium, thereby preventing the following recording medium from always and reliably being introduced into the other paper discharge passage.

      Therefore, interference between the trailing end of the clogged recording medium and the following recording medium is prevented.

      The switching means is automatically switched if either a recording medium is clogged in the first paper-discharge passage or the second paper-discharge passage.

In other words, the hardness of overall body of the second roller 420 is made to be lower than that of the overall body of the first roller 410.

      Therefore, even if the hardness of the surface layer 420c of the second roller 420 is higher than that of the surface layer 410c of the first roller 410, the overall body of the nipping portion N is formed into the recess shape recessed toward the second roller 420 as described above.

      Immediately before the leading end of the recording medium S reaches the second transfer portion or after the same has reached the second transfer portion (that is, when the toner image on the intermediate transfer belt 360 is transferred to a required position on the recording medium S1), the secondary transfer roller 380 is pressed against the intermediate transfer belt 360.

      Thus, the toner image (basically a full color image) on the intermediate transfer roller 360 is transferred to the recording medium S.

      Since a non-fixed image on the recording medium S is brought into contact with the first roller 410 having the surface layer 410c which is of relatively low hardness and having a relatively low temperature, a matted image having an excellent image quality can easily be obtained.

    <p num="198">(In a Case of Paper Clogging)</p>
    <p num="199">
      When recording mediums on each of which an image has been formed, are sequentially discharged through the second passage 93b, a recording medium sometimes clogs in the second passage 93b.
      <br/>
      Clogging of the recording medium is detected by photosensors 81, 82b and 83b.
    </p>
    <p num="200">
      As described above, the photosensors 81, 82b, 83b are turned on if a recording medium exists in an opposite position and turned off if no recording medium exists.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the photosensors are turned on when the leading end of a recording medium passes through the opposite portions, while the photosensors are turned off after the trailing end of a recording medium has passed through the opposite portions.
    </p>
    <p num="201">
      Therefore, if no clogging takes place and the recording mediums are normally discharged, each sensor is turned on.
      <br/>
      Then, the sensor is turned off after predetermined time has elapsed (after the trailing end of a recording medium has passed).
      <br/>
      If a recording medium is clogged, at least one of the photosensors 81, 82b, 83b is continuously turned on even if the predetermined time has elapsed.
      <br/>
      The control unit 80 then determines that clogging has taken place.
    </p>
    <p num="202">
      When clogging has taken place, the control unit 80 detects whether or not the photosensor 81 serving as the inlet-port detection means has been turned off.
      <br/>
      If the inlet-port detection means 81 is turned off, the control unit 80 determines that the trailing end of the recording medium has been allowed to pass through the inlet portion (of the first conveying roller portion 95 in this case) of the second paper-discharge passage 93b.
      <br/>
      Thus, the control unit 80 operates the solenoid 513 so as to switch the first switch guide 510 to the other paper-discharge passage, that is the first paper-discharge passage 93a, as indicated by the imaginary line shown in FIG. 1.
      <br/>
      Moreover, the separating mechanism is operated so that the following rotations of the follower rollers 96b, 97b and 98b following the corresponding drive rollers in the second and third conveying roller portions 96 and 97 and the paper-discharge roller portion 98 are suspended.
      <br/>
      Moreover, the foregoing drive rollers are inversely rotated.

    <p num="203">
      Thus, the following recording medium having an image formed thereon and allowed to pass through the fixing unit 400 is introduced into the first paper-discharge passage 93a, and then discharged to the receiving portion 51 through the first paper-discharge passage 93a.
      <br/>
      Since the following rotations of the follower rollers 96b, 97b and 98b following the drive rollers have been suspended at this time, inverse movement of the clogged recording medium can be prevented.
    </p>
    <p num="204">
      If the photosensor 81 is turned on when clogging has occurred, it means that the trailing end of the recording medium has not passed through the inlet port of the second paper-discharge passage 93b.
      <br/>
      That is, the trailing end exists in the inlet portion.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the control unit 80 does not switch the first switch guide 510 to the position shown in imaginary lines in FIGS. 1 and 2.
      <br/>
      The control unit 80 instead interrupts the operation of the apparatus, at least, the paper conveying operation.
      <br/>
      Moreover, a message (alarm sound or display on a display portion of the operation panel) indicating clogging of the recording medium is communicated to a user.

      In the other cases, the control unit 80 does not switch the first switch guide 510.
      <br/>
      The control unit 80 interrupts the operation of the apparatus, at least the paper conveying operation.
      <br/>
      Moreover, the control unit 80 communicates a message (alarm sound or display on the display portion of the operation panel) indicating clogging of the recording medium.
      <br/>
      Then, removal of the clogged recording medium is waited for, and then the control unit 80 again operates the apparatus.

    <p num="233">
      The above-mentioned image forming apparatus has the first paper-discharge passage 93a for discharging, to the receiving portion 51, the recording mediums on which images have been formed, the second paper-discharge passage 93b for discharging the recording mediums on which the images have been formed such that the recording mediums are discharged independently from the first paper-discharge passage 93a and switching means 510 for introducing the recording mediums, on which images have been formed, to either of the first paper-discharge passage 93a or the second paper-discharge passage 93b.
      <br/>
      Therefore, if a recording medium is clogged in the first paper-discharge passage or the second paper-discharge passage, the switching means 510 introduces the recording medium to another paper discharge passage.
      <br/>
      Thus, the recording mediums, on which images have been formed, can be discharged to the receiving portions without interruption of the image forming operation.
    </p>
    <p num="234">
      The foregoing image forming apparatus comprises inlet-portion detection means 81 for detecting a fact that the trailing end of the recording medium introduced into the first paper-discharge passage 93a or the second paper-discharge passage 93b has passed through an inlet portion of the paper-discharge passage; clogging detection means 82b for detecting clogging of the recording medium, on which the image has been formed, in the paper discharge passage; and control means 80 for switching the switching means 510 to the other paper discharge passage when clogging of the recording medium has been detected by the clogging detection means and passage of the trailing end of the recording medium has been detected by the inlet-portion detection means 81.
      <br/>
      Therefore, if a recording medium introduced into the first paper-discharge passage or the second paper-discharge passage clogs such is detected by the detection means 82b.
      <br/>
      When a fact that the trailing end of the recording medium has passed the inlet portion of the foregoing paper discharge passage has been detected by the inlet-portion detection means 81, the control means 80 automatically switches the switching means 510.
      <br/>
      Thus, the following recording mediums are introduced into the other paper discharge passage to be discharged.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the following recording mediums each having an image formed thereon can be discharged.
    </p>
    <p num="235">
      If the foregoing inlet-portion detection means 81 is not provided and therefore the switching means 510 is switched to the other paper discharge passage though the trailing end of the recording medium has not passed the inlet portion of the paper discharge passage, the trailing end of the recording medium exists in the inlet portion (a position adjacent to the inlet portion of the other paper discharge passage) of each paper discharge passage which is the branching portion between the first and second paper-discharge passages.
      <br/>
      Therefore, there is apprehension that the foregoing trailing end is brought into contact with the leading end of the following recording medium.
      <br/>
      Therefore, there is apprehension that the following recording medium cannot always and reliably be introduced into the other paper discharge passage.
    </p>
    <p num="236">
      On the other hand, the image forming apparatus according to this embodiment has the structure that the switching means 510 is switched when the fact that the trailing end of the recording medium is passing the inlet of the paper discharge passage has been detected (or is being detected) if the recording medium introduced into the first paper-discharge passage or the second paper-discharge passage is clogged.
      <br/>
      Therefore, interference between the trailing end of the clogged recording medium and the following recording medium can be prevented.
      <br/>
      Thus, the following recording mediums each having an image formed thereon can reliably be introduced into the other paper discharge passage so as to be discharged.
      <br/>
      The image forming apparatus thus has the structure in which the switching means 510 is automatically switched so as to reliably introduce the following recording mediums into the other paper discharge passage so as to be discharged if a recording medium is clogged in the first paper-discharge passage or the second paper-discharge passage.
      <br/>
      Therefore, if a recording medium is clogged, images can be formed on the following recording mediums so as to discharge the recording mediums normally.

      The basic operation in this mode is similar to that in the double-side mode.

      The difference lies in that the recording medium allowed to pass through the fixing unit 400 one time is turned inside out in the paper-discharge passage 93.
      <br/>
      When the recording medium is again moved to the fixing unit 400 through the returning passage 94, the non-fixed toner image is not transferred to the other surface.

      In an alternative embodiment, the speed of conveyance can be varied, instead of varying roller temperatures, to selectively produce matte or glossy images.

      The second recording medium S2 is in a state in which the trailing end (the leading end in the direction of movement) S2b has passed through the gate roller pair 91b.

    <p num="259">
      An image finally obtained in the inverse and re-fixing sub-mode is a glossy image.
      <br/>
      Since the image on the recording medium is brought into contact with the second roller 420 incorporating the surface layer 420c having relatively high hardness and a relatively high temperature, a glossy image having an excellent image quality can easily be obtained.
    </p>
    <p num="260">The image forming apparatus having the above-mentioned structure attains the following operation and effects.</p>
    <p num="261">
      (a) A non-fixed image is formed on the recording medium S by the image forming portion, and then the recording medium S is moved while being heated and applied with pressure by rollers in the fixing unit 400 each having a surface layer.
      <br/>
      Thus, the non-fixed image is fixed to the recording medium S.
    </p>
    <p num="262">When the mode is the double-side mode, images are formed on both sides of the recording medium S. When the mode is the single-side mode, an image is formed on only one side of the recording medium S.</p>
    <p num="263">
      When the inverse and re-fixing sub-mode is selected in the single-side mode, the recording medium S allowed to pass through the fixing unit 400 one time and is turned inside out.
      <br/>
      Then, the recording medium S is allowed to again pass through the fixing unit 400.
      <br/>
      Therefore, accumulation of curls of the recording medium S is prevented.
    </p>
    <p num="264">Also, the image forming apparatus according to this embodiment having the double-side mode and the single-side mode is able to satisfactorily prevent clogging of a recording medium although the recording medium S is allowed to pass through the fixing unit several times in the single-side mode.</p>
    <p num="265">
      The first roller 410 is a roller which is brought into contact with the non-fixed image on the recording medium S when the recording medium S is allowed to pass through the fixing unit 400 a first time.
      <br/>
      The second roller 420 is a roller which is brought into contact with an image on the recording medium S when the recording medium S is allowed to pass through the fixing unit 400 a second time.
      <br/>
      Since the hardness of the surface layer 420c of the second roller 420 is higher than that of the surface layer 410c of the first roller 410, a matted image or a glossy image having an excellent image quality can selectively be obtained.
    </p>
    <p num="266">
      More specifically, the foregoing image forming apparatus is arranged to obtain a matted image such that a recording medium S having a non-fixed image formed in the single-side mode (except for the inverse and re-fixing sub-mode) is allowed to pass through the fixing unit 400 one time.
      <br/>
      Since the non-fixed image on the recording medium S is brought into contact with the first roller 410 incorporating the surface layer 410c having relatively low hardness, a somewhat rough state realized by toner particles which have not been completely melted is left on the surface of the image.
      <br/>
      Therefore, a matted image having an excellent image quality is obtained.
      <br/>
      When the recording medium S is plain paper or bond paper having rough surfaces and a matted image is attempted to be formed on the surface of the foregoing recording medium S, deformation of the cross sectional shape of the toner image on the recording medium must be prevented.
      <br/>
      As an alternative to this, the toner image must be fixed along the shape of the fiber in the paper.
    </p>
    <p num="267">
      When a glossy image is desired, the recording medium S having the non-fixed image formed in the inverse and re-fixing sub-mode is allowed to pass through the fixing unit 400 one time so that a matted image is formed.
      <br/>
      Then, the recording medium S is turned inside out, and then allowed to again pass through the fixing unit 400 at least one (two or more times in total) time.
      <br/>
      Therefore, a relatively large quantity of heat is supplied so that the matted image is formed into a glossy image.
      <br/>
      Thus, the glossy image is obtained.
      <br/>
      Since the matted image on the recording medium S is brought into contact with the second roller 420 incorporating the surface layer 420c having relatively high hardness, the surface of the toner image which has completely melted can be smoothed.
      <br/>
      As a result, a glossy image having an excellent image quality is obtained.
    </p>
    <p num="268">
      When the recording medium S is an OHP sheet, glossy paper or paper for only a color image (a special sheet having the surface of a sheet-shape base member (PET or paper) coated with a thermoplastic resin which serves as an image receiving layer), the toner image on the recording medium must be smoothed simultaneously with melting or embedded in the image receiving layer.
      <br/>
      Thus the foregoing image forming apparatus having the inverse and re-fixing sub-mode causes the matted image on the recording medium S to be brought into contact with the second roller 420 incorporating the surface layer 420c having relatively high hardness when the recording medium S is allowed to again pass through the fixing unit 400.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the surface of the toner image which has completely been melted can be smoothed or embedded in the image receiving layer.
      <br/>
      As a result, a glossy image having an excellent image quality is obtained.

      As described above, the image forming apparatus according to this embodiment having the double-side mode and the single-side mode is able to satisfactorily prevent clogging of the recording medium S although the recording medium S can be allowed to pass through the fixing unit 400 several times when the mode is the single-side mode.
      <br/>
      Moreover, a matted image or a glossy image having an excellent image quality can selectively be obtained.
    </p>
    <p num="270">
      (b) Because the surface layer 420c of the second roller 420 is made of the resin having a separating characteristic, winding of the recording medium S around the second roller 420 which takes pace in the inverse and re-fixing sub-mode is satisfactorily prevented.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the quantity of the separating agent which must be applied to the surface of the second roller 420 can be reduced.
      <br/>
      When the recording medium is an OHP sheet, deterioration in the transparency and color developing characteristic occurring because of the separating agent is prevented.
      <br/>
      Thus, a glossy image having satisfactory transparency and a color developing characteristic is obtained.
    </p>
    <p num="271">(c) Since the temperature of the surface of the second roller 420 is higher than that of the surface of the first roller 410, a matted image or a glossy image having an excellent image quality can selectively be obtained.</p>

      Specifically, the foregoing image forming apparatus is able to obtain a matted image such that a recording medium S having a non-fixed image formed in, for example, the single-side mode (except for the inverse and re-fixing sub-mode), is allowed to pass through the fixing unit 400 one time.
      <br/>
      Since the non-fixed image on the recording medium S is brought into contact with the first roller 410 having relatively low temperature, a matted image having an excellent image quality is easily obtained.

      <br/>
      Subsequently, the recording medium S is allowed to pass through the fixing unit 400 at least one more time (two or more times in total) so that a relatively large quantity of heat is supplied.
    </p>
    <p num="274">Thus, the matted image is formed into a glossy image.</p>
    <p num="275">
      As a result, a glossy image is obtained.

      Since the matted image on the recording medium S is brought into contact with the second roller 420 having a relatively high temperature, a glossy image having an excellent image quality can easily be obtained.

    <p num="276">
      When the recording medium is allowed to pass through the fixing unit at the second or following time, the recording medium has been allowed to pass through the fixing unit 400 one time.
      <br/>
      Since the developer, such as toner, is melted to a degree with which the matted image can be obtained at the first fixing operation, cohesive force between developers and the bonding strength between the developer and the recording medium have considerably been enlarged as compared with those of the non-fixed image.
      <br/>
      Therefore, even if a large quantity of heat is supplied by the second roller 420 having the relatively high temperature, offset does not easily take place.
    </p>
    <p num="277">
      Therefore, the foregoing image forming apparatus has a structure in which a glossy image is obtained, in particular, a color image, is obtained by supplying a great quantity of heat by the second roller 420.

    </p>
    <p num="278">In particular, a satisfactory effect can be obtained when the recording medium is an OHP sheet, glossy paper or paper for only a color image (a special sheet having the surface of a sheet-shape base member (PET or paper) coated with a thermoplastic resin which serves as an image receiving layer).</p>

      <br/>
      Moreover, a matted image or a glossy image having an excellent image quality can selectively be obtained.
    </p>
    <p num="281">Thus, reduction in the speed at which the recording medium is allowed to pass through the fixing unit is not required as has been required for the conventional technology disclosed in Japanese Patent Publication No. 6-40235.

      (d) A non-fixed image is formed on the recording medium S by the image forming portion, and then the recording medium S is moved while being heated and applied with pressure by rollers in the fixing unit 400 wherein each roller has a surface layer.

      Thus, the non-fixed image is fixed to the recording medium S. The fixing operations are performed selectively by conveying the recording mediums a plurality of times.

    <p num="283">
      When the recording medium S is allowed to pass through the fixing unit 400 plural times, the conveying speed of the recording medium S, realized by the fixing unit 400, is made lower in the second and following fixing operations as compared with that of the first conveying operation.
      <br/>
      Therefore, a glossy image having excellent image quality can easily be obtained.

      When the recording medium is allowed to pass through the fixing unit 400 at the second and following operations, the recording medium S has already been allowed to pass through the fixing unit 400 one time.

      Since toner is melted to a degree with which the matted image can be obtained at the first fixing operation, cohesive force between toner and the bonding strength between the toner and the recording medium have considerably been enlarged as compared with those of the non-fixed image.

      Therefore, even when a large quantity of heat is supplied as a result of the relatively low conveying speed, offset does not easily take place.

      Therefore, the foregoing image forming apparatus has the structure that a glossy image is obtained, in particular, a color image, by supplying a great quantity of heat.

      In particular, a satisfactory effect can be obtained when the recording medium is an OHP sheet, glossy paper or paper for only a color image (a special sheet having the surface of a sheet-shape base member (PET or paper) coated with a thermoplastic resin which serves as an image receiving layer).

      (f) The fixing unit 400 incorporates the first and second rollers 410 and 420 for conveying the recording medium S having a non-fixed image formed thereon while heating and applying pressure to the recording medium S.

      Since the temperature of the first roller 410 is relatively low, toner is not excessively melted.

    <p num="345">&lt;Oil Rollers 414 and 424&gt;</p>
    <p num="346">
      Each oil roller has an oil retention layer made of heat resisting fiber (felt or the like) or sponge which can be impregnated with offset-preventive solution (silicon oil or the like) having appropriate viscosity.
      <br/>
      Moreover, an application-quantity-limiting layer made of a porous film made of tetrafluoroethylene or the like is formed on the surface of the oil retention layer.
    </p>
    <p num="347">The quantity of oil which is applied (the quantity of the same which is discharged) can be adjusted by adjusting the viscosity of oil, diameters of pores of the porous film and density.</p>
    <p num="348">&lt;Oil Roller 414 with Respect to First Roller 410&gt;</p>
    <p num="349">The diameter is about 30 mm.</p>
    <p num="350">Oil is dimethyl silicon oil having viscosity (cst) of about 1000.</p>
    <p num="351">The quantity of oil which is applied to the surface of the first roller 410 is about 0.005 (mg/cm2).</p>
    <p num="352">&lt;Oil Roller 424 with Respect to Second Roller 420&gt;</p>
    <p num="353">The diameter is about 19 mm.</p>
    <p num="354">Oil is dimethyl silicon oil having viscosity (cst) of about 1000.</p>
    <p num="355">The quantity of oil which is applied to the surface of the second roller 420 is about 0.0005 (mg/cm2).</p>
    <p num="356">Although the invention has been described in its preferred form with a certain degree of particularity, it is understood that the present disclosure of the preferred form can be changed in the details of construction and in the combination and arrangement of parts without departing from the spirit and the scope of the invention as defined in the appended claims.</p>
    <p num="357">For example,</p>
    <p num="358">
      (1) An above-mentioned embodiment has a structure such that only the double-side mode/single-side mode can be selected by operating the mode selection switch 84.
      <br/>
      Thus alternatively, the inverse and re-fixing sub-mode may be permitted to be selected.
      <br/>
      When the inverse and re-fixing sub-mode is selected, the inverse and re-fixing operation is then performed regardless of the type of the recording medium.
    </p>
    <p num="359">
      (2) An above-mentioned embodiment is provided with the paper selection switch 85 and the image-quality selection switch 86.
      <br/>
      In an alternative arranged, only one of the above-mentioned switches 85, 86 may be provided for switching the mode.
      <br/>
      When, for example, plain paper is selected by operating the paper selection switch 85, the usual single-side mode is automatically started so that a matted image is formed.
      <br/>
      When an OHP sheet or the like (glossy paper, a lustered film or paper for only a color image) is selected, the inverse and re-fixing sub-mode is automatically started so that a glossy image is formed.
    </p>
    <p num="360">
      (3) An above-mentioned embodiment has a structure in which the recording medium is allowed to pass through the fixing unit two times in the inverse and re-fixing sub-mode.
      <br/>
      However, the number of times may be four or more by repeating the operation for inverting and re-fixing the recording medium.
      <br/>
      The recording medium may thus be allowed to pass through the fixing unit an odd number of times in the inverse and re-fixing sub-mode.
    </p>
    <p num="361">
      (4) The inlet detection means for detecting when the trailing end of a recording medium has passed through the inlet portion of the paper-discharge passage 93 may comprise various different structures.
      <br/>
      For example, the means may comprise the photosensor 82a or 82b constituting the clogging detection means.
      <br/>
      That is, if the size of the recording medium is detected, the foregoing photosensors may be employed to detect the trailing end of the recording medium in accordance with the elapsed time after detection of the leading end of the recording medium.
    </p>
    <p num="362">(5) The fixing pressure for the second and following fixing operations may be raised or the fixing temperature may be raised in the inverse and re-fixing sub-mode.</p>
    <p num="363">
      (6) Although the discharge passage for discharging recording mediums in the single-side mode is the second paper-discharge passage 93b when the state is a normal state, the foregoing discharge passage may be the first paper-discharge passage 93a.
      <br/>
      When clogging has taken place, the following recording mediums may then be introduced into the second paper-discharge passage 93b.
