    <heading>BACKGROUND OF INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="1">
      This invention is heat-curable silicone rubber compositions.
      <br/>
      More particularly, this invention is heat-curable silicone rubber compositions that cure rapidly to give very mechanically strong, nondiscoloring silicone rubber.
    </p>
    <p num="2">
      The silicone rubber compositions known as millable silicone rubbers as a general rule cure in the presence of organoperoxide and heat to give highly heat-resistant, highly weather-resistant silicone rubbers that have excellent electrical properties, and this good property set has resulted in the frequent use of these compositions in applications where these properties are critical.
      <br/>
      This notwithstanding, a drawback to silicone rubber compositions of this type has been their slow cure rate.
      <br/>
      There have already been attempts at raising the cure rate of these silicone rubber compositions.
      <br/>
      For example, Japanese Laid Open (Kokai or Unexamined) Patent Application Number Hei 9-95612 (95,612/1997) teaches a cure rate-enhancing method in which dimethylsiloxy-endblocked dimethylsiloxane-methylhydrogensiloxane copolymer is blended into a silicone rubber composition that can be cured by 2,5-dimethyl-2,5-di(tert-butylperoxy)hexane.
    </p>
    <p num="3">
      However, the silicone rubber moldings afforded by this method have a pronounced tendency to stick to the mold or die and thus suffer from poor mold-release properties.
      <br/>
      Thick silicone rubber moldings prepared by this method also fail to undergo cure in all sections, which prevents the production of silicone rubber moldings of uniform mechanical strength.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      As a result of extensive investigations directed to solving the problems described above, the inventors discovered that these problems could be solved by the admixture of a specific type of carbosiloxane dendrimer into organoperoxide-curing silicone rubber compositions.
      <br/>
      More specifically, the object of the present invention is to provide a heat-curable silicone rubber composition that cures rapidly to give very mechanically strong, nondiscoloring silicone rubber.

    <heading>DESCRIPTION OF INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="7">The present invention is a heat-curable silicone rubber composition comprising</p>
    <p num="8">
      (A) 100 weight parts organopolysiloxane with an average unit formula RX SiO(4-x)/2 containing at least 2 silicon-bonded alkenyl groups in each molecule, where each R is independently selected from the group consisting of hydroxyl and substituted and unsubstituted monovalent hydrocarbon groups and x has a value of from 1.9 to 2.1,
      <br/>
      (B) 10 to 100 weight parts reinforcing filler,
      <br/>
      (C) 0.1 to 10 weight parts carbosiloxane dendrimer that contains at least 3 silicon-bonded hydrogen atoms in each molecule, and
      <br/>
      (D) 0.1 to 10 weight parts organoperoxide.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      To explain the preceding in greater detail, the organopolysiloxane (A), which is the base component of the present composition, is defined by the average unit formula RX SiO(4-x)/2. The group R in this formula can be the hydroxyl group or a substituted or unsubstituted monovalent hydrocarbon group as exemplified by alkyl such as methyl, ethyl, propyl, butyl, and octyl; alkenyl such as vinyl, allyl, butenyl, and hexenyl; aryl such as phenyl; 3,3,3-trifluoropropyl; 2-phenylethyl; and 2-cyanoethyl.
      <br/>
      The subscript x is a number from 1.9 to 2.1. Each molecule of this component must contain at least 2 silicon-bonded alkenyl groups.
      <br/>
      This alkenyl group can be bonded in pendant or chain terminal position or in both positions.
      <br/>
      Component (A) can have a straight-chain or partially branched straight-chain molecular structure.
      <br/>
      While the viscosity of component (A) is not crucial, a preferred viscosity at 25 (degree)  C. is from 1,000 to 20,000,000 mPa.s. Component (A) can be a homopolymer, copolymer, or a mixture of these polymers.
      <br/>
      The siloxy units making up component (A) are exemplified by the dimethylsiloxy unit, methylvinylsiloxy unit, and 3,3,3-trifluoropropylmethylsiloxy unit.
      <br/>
      The group present at the molecular terminals of component (A) are exemplified by trimethylsiloxy, silanol, dimethylvinylsiloxy, and methylvinylhydroxysiloxy.
      <br/>
      The organopolysiloxane under consideration can be exemplified by dimethylvinylsiloxy-endblocked dimethylsiloxane-methylvinylsiloxane copolymers, dimethylvinylsiloxy-endblocked dimethylpolysiloxanes, silanol-endblocked dimethylsiloxane-methylvinylsiloxane copolymers, and methylvinylhydroxysiloxy-endblocked dimethylsiloxane-methylvinylsiloxane copolymers.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      The reinforcing filler (B) used in the present composition is an essential component that imparts high levels of mechanical strength to the silicone rubber moldings afforded by cure of the composition.
      <br/>
      This reinforcing filler is exemplified by dry-process silicas such as fumed silicas and by wet-process silicas such as precipitated silicas and by the microparticulate silicas afforded by hydrophobicizing the surface of a silica as listed above with an organosilicon compound such as an organosilane, organosilazane, organopolysiloxane, or diorganocyclopolysiloxane.
      <br/>
      This component should have a particle diameter no greater than 50  MU m and preferably has a specific surface area of at least 50 m2 /g and more preferably of at least 100 m2 /g.
      <br/>
      Component (B) is admixed at from 10 to 100 weight parts of component (A) per 100 weight parts component (A).
      <br/>
      The use of less than 10 weight parts will result in an inadequate mechanical strength after cure of the composition, while at more than 100 weight parts it becomes quite difficult to blend component (B) into component (A).

    <p num="11">
      The SiH-functional carbosiloxane dendrimer (C) used in the present composition is the component that characterizes this composition and must contain at least 3 silicon-bonded hydrogens in each molecule.

      As used herein, SiH-functional carbosiloxane dendrimer denotes a high-molecular-weight compound with a predictable and highly branched structure that elaborates radially from a single core.
      <br/>

      Then, 141.0 g of 1,1,3,3-tetramethyldisiloxane, 100 mL of concentrated hydrochloric acid, 200 mL of water, and 200 mL of isopropanol were placed in a 1-liter four-neck flask equipped with a stirrer, thermometer, reflux condenser, and an addition funnel and were stirred. 80.6 g Of the very light brown liquid prepared as described above was then gradually added dropwise from the addition funnel over 1 hour.
      <br/>
      After the completion of addition, the reaction solution was stirred at room temperature for an additional 1 hour.
      <br/>
      The reaction solution was then transferred to a separatory funnel, the lower layer was separated off, and the remaining upper layer solution was washed twice with 200 mL of water, then washed once with 50 mL of saturated aqueous sodium bicarbonate solution, and finally dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate.
      <br/>
      The produced solids were filtered off and the resulting solution was transferred to an evaporation flask and concentrated under reduced pressure on a rotary evaporator to yield carbosiloxane dendrimer with the following average compositional formula.
