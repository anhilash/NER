    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="1">The present invention relates to a chain link used to form an energy conducting guide chain, and wherein the chain link can be adapted to a plurality of use configurations.</p>
    <p num="2">
      Supply lines for the feed of consumables of all kinds to movable machine apparatuses are laid in so-called energy guide chains.
      <br/>
      The energy guide chains have a plurality of pivotably interconnected chain links which form a passage for accommodating supply lines.
      <br/>
      The operation of laying supply lines in energy guide chains must be effected with a very high degree of care.
      <br/>
      In particular, laying a plurality of lines one upon the other and laying lines of different diameters in directly juxtaposed relationship should be avoided in order to ensure that the lines do not rub against each other, which can cause the lines to be damaged.
      <br/>
      Furthermore when laying supply lincs which involve pressure hoses, account must be taken of the fact that they can move freely as they decrease or increase in length when subjected to varying pressure loadings.
      <br/>
      Electrical lines are also laid in an energy guide chain.
      <br/>
      If electrical lines are laid in the form of a bundle in an energy guide chain, there is the risk of the lines and possibly the energy guide chain being ruined if the energy guide chain comprises plastics material as electrical lines disposed in a bundle heat up during operation.
    </p>
    <p num="3">
      Different proposals have already been put forward for resolving those problems when laying supply lines in energy guide chains.
      <br/>
      An optimum solution is achieved by means of so-called apertured webs through which the laid lines are guided in mutually separated condition.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      A further proposed solution is known from utility model No. G 91 02 121.9 U1. In accordance with that proposal an energy guide chain involves a division of the energy guide passage, and such division can be altered in a simple manner and using a few components of a simple construction.
      <br/>
      For that purpose it is proposed that separating webs and crossbar members are arranged between the transverse portions and the chain side plates.
      <br/>
      Each separating web has at least one opening which is arranged transversely to its longitudinal direction and which is open towards its web side.
      <br/>
      The crossbar member can be inserted into the opening, with the opening having an undercut configuration.
      <br/>
      Division of the energy guide passage with a separating web-crossbar member system is possible by means of two separating webs and a crossbar member.
      <br/>
      The energy guide passage can be divided into further portions by using a plurality of crossbar members and separating webs.
      <br/>
      In that case the crossbar members are held in the openings having an undercut configuration, in such a way that the crossbar members are prevented from unintentional release from the separating webs.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      Utility model No. G 91 09 241.8 discloses an energy guide chain in which the space within the energy guide passage can be subdivided by separating bodies and partitions.
      <br/>
      The partitions have elastically deformable eyes which each have an inwardly facing retaining projection co-operating with corresponding retaining recesses in the separating bodies.
      <br/>
      The elastically deformable eyes embrace the separating body in question.
      <br/>
      Due to the configuration of the eyes in particular subsequent installation of the separating bodies with partitions in an energy guide chain is a relatively complicated and expensive operation.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      A further proposal for a separating web-crossbar member system for an energy guide chain is known from EP 0 343 192.
      <br/>
      In accordance with EP 0 343 192 each separating web has on both sides one or more holding grooves which are distributed over its height and which are in mutual alignment on respective sides.
      <br/>
      At their ends the crossbar members have retaining noses which can each be selectively inserted into a respective one of the holding grooves.
      <br/>
      This embodiment requires a particular configuration in respect of the holding grooves and the retaining noses in order to ensure that the separating webs and the crossbar members do not already fall apart during the assembly operation.
      <br/>
      During operation of an energy guide chain the lines exert additional forces on the crossbar members and indirectly on the separating webs which must carry such forces.
      <br/>
      By virtue of the construction involved the separating webs must be of a suitable thickness whereby the space available in the guide passage is reduced.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      Taking that state of the art as its basic starting point the invention is based on the problem of providing a kit for a chain link, whereby the chain link can be equipped for different situations of use.
      <br/>
      A further object of the invention is to provide a chain link and an energy guide chain which can both be adapted to varying situations of use.
    </p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="8">
      The above and other objects and advantages of the invention are achieved by the provision of a chain link which comprises two spaced apart and parallel side plates and at least one transverse number extending transversely between and interconnecting the side plates.
      <br/>
      At least two separating bodies are mounted to the one transverse member, and the separating bodies are transversely spaced apart and have edge portions which extend in the upright direction.
      <br/>
      Each of the edge portions has a plurality of supports which are spaced apart from each other in the upright direction.
      <br/>
      At least one partition is also provided, which is configured so that it can be releasably connected between the two separating bodies with the partition being supported on a selected one of the supports along the edge portion of each separating body, and so that the partition lies in a generally transverse plane.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      Preferably, the partition can be secured to the two separating bodies by securing elements which at least partially embrace a holding portion of the separating bodies.
      <br/>
      Also, the two separating bodies are preferably mounted between two transverse members of the chain link which are spaced apart in the upright direction and are releasably securable thereto.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      The two separating bodies and the partitions may thus serve as a kit which affords a possible way of adapting a chain link to a plurality of situations of use.
      <br/>
      The kit components can be assembled in such a way that this provides a separating system for lines which can be fitted into a chain link.
      <br/>
      The partitions can be of different lengths whereby adaptation to different situations of use is improved.
      <br/>
      Assembly of the kit components is a relatively simple matter as the securing elements of the partitions can be connected to the edge portions in a structurally simple fashion.
      <br/>
      The separating bodies have a plurality of supports which extend substantially transversely to the longitudinal extent of the separating bodies and on which the partitions at least partially lie.
      <br/>
      That provides that the force generated by the weight of the line or lines is carried by the partitions and is transmitted to the separating body.
      <br/>
      That situation in terms of force relieves the load on the securing elements so that they are required to carry essentially only the force exerted by a line in the longitudinal direction of a chain link.
    </p>
    <p num="11">
      In order to facilitate positioning of the assembled kit components between two chain side plates of a chain link which are connected together by a transverse portion, it is proposed that the separating bodies, at their respective oppositely disposed end portions, have at least one projection extending in the longitudinal direction of the separating body.
      <br/>
      The projection can be caused to bear against the transverse portion.
      <br/>
      That prevents displacement of the assembled kit components in the longitudinal direction of the chain link.
      <br/>
      In accordance with a further advantageous development it is proposed that each separating body has only one projection at its respective end portion.
      <br/>
      A preferred configuration of the separating bodies is one in which the projections are diametrally displaced relative to each other.
    </p>
    <p num="12">
      If the separating bodies are individually arranged on a transverse portion, it is proposed that each separating body has two spaced projections at each of its respective end portions.
      <br/>
      The spacing between the projections in that arrangement is preferably such as to afford a positively locking connection between the projections and the transverse portion, in which case the separating bodies permit displacement on the transverse portion in the longitudinal direction thereof.
    </p>
    <p num="13">
      For stationarily positioning the separating bodies on a transverse portion, a further advantageous embodiment of the separating bodies proposes that at at least one end portion said separating bodies have at least one retaining nose which extends in the longitudinal direction of the separating web and which co-operates with the holding region of the transverse portion.
      <br/>
      That provides an arresting action for arresting the separating bodies on the transverse portion.
    </p>
    <p num="14">
      In accordance with a further advantageous concept it is proposed that the separating body has abutments which are provided above the supports.
      <br/>
      That prevents the partition from lifting off a support.
    </p>
    <p num="15">
      In order to be able to subdivide the free cross-section of the chain side plates by a minimum possible number of kit components, it is proposed that the supports and possibly the abutments are provided in aligned relationship on both sides of the separating body.
      <br/>
      That affords a separating body which can be fitted with partitions on both sides.
      <br/>
      The supports and possibly the abutments are preferably provided on a substantially plate-shaped carrier element with longitudinal edges.
      <br/>
      The supports and possibly the abutments extend over the entire transverse extent of the carrier element.
      <br/>
      A preferred configuration of the separating body however is one in which the supports and possibly the abutments are provided only over a part of the transverse extent of the carrier element.
      <br/>
      The supports and possibly the abutments extend from the longitudinal edges inwardly into the carrier element.
    </p>
    <p num="16">
      In accordance with a further advantageous configuration of the kit it is proposed that each holding portion of a separating body is of a columnar configuration.
      <br/>
      In the case of a separating body which has two columnar holding portions, between which the carrier element is arranged, a partition can be connected to the edge portions both from the one side and also from the other side.
    </p>
    <p num="17">
      In order to achieve a relatively high level of stability for the separating body, it is proposed that each columnar holding portion is connected to the carrier element by way of at least one connecting element.
      <br/>
      The holding portions are preferably of a substantially at least part-circular cross-section.
      <br/>
      The internal width of the holding portions in the region of the support is preferably less than the thickness of the separating body, in particular the carrier element.
      <br/>
      A suitable configuration in respect of the securing elements provides a connection between the separating bodies and the partitions, in which the connecting location does not further reduce the intermediate space.
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      The partitions can be of a plate-like configuration.
      <br/>
      They rest on the supports.
      <br/>
      A preferred configuration of the partitions is one which has support tongues.
      <br/>
      The length of the support tongues preferably substantially corresponds to the length of the supports.
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      The partitions are preferably secured to the holding portions of the separating bodies by way of securing elements which are at least partially resilient.
      <br/>
      The partitions are connected to the separating bodies by way of the securing elements virtually by clipping engagement.
      <br/>
      In that respect a preferred embodiment of the securing elements is one in which they have an open passage portion through which a holding portion can be introduced into a receiving means for at least partially embracing same.
      <br/>
      In that case the internal width of the passage portion is preferably smaller than the internal width of the holding portion.
    </p>
    <p num="20">
      To solve the above-indicated problem there is also proposed a chain link having two chain side plates and which has at least one pivotal portion for pivotal connection to another chain link, which is distinguished in that it is completed with the kit components according to one of claims 1 to 19.
      <br/>
      There is also proposed an energy guide chain according to the invention with chain links which each have chain side plates and at least one pivotal portion for pivotal connection to another chain link, which chain is distinguished in that it is completed with at least one chain link according to claim 20.
