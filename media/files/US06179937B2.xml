    <p num="3">
      The present invention relates to stabilizers for hydroxylammonium nitrate (HAN), HAN derivatives, and their precursor, hydroxylamine and compositions comprising HAN, an HAN derivative or hydroxylamine.
      <br/>
      The present invention further relates to stabilized HAN, HAN derivatives and hydroxylamine, as well as stabilized compositions containing HAN, an HAN derivative or hydroxylamine.
      <br/>
      HAN, HAN derivatives or hydroxylamine and compositions comprising HAN, an HAN derivative or hydroxylamine are stabilized against decomposition by the addition of a stabilizing effective amount of a stabilizer(s) within the scope of the present invention.
      <br/>
      More specifically, the present invention relates to stabilized compositions, such as liquid propellants (also referred to herein as "LP") that contain HAN, an HAN derivative or hydroxylamine and a fuel.
      <br/>
      HAN derivatives referred to within the scope of the present invention are compounds prepared by substituting a functional group on the amine in place of a hydrogen ion--i.e. diethylhydroxylammonium nitrate.
    </p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="4">
      HAN, HAN derivatives and hydroxylamine are useful oxidizers in various propellant formulations such as, for example, those used for guns, rockets, satellites, gas generators, and the like.
      <br/>
      HAN, specifically, is an oxidizer for propellants that has recently become available in commercial quantities.
      <br/>
      Processes for preparing HAN are set forth in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,510,097 and 5,258,104.
      <br/>
      HAN, its derivatives and hydroxylamine have many desirable properties, such as high oxygen content, high water solubility as well as containing no halogen atoms.
      <br/>
      Unfortunately, the storage stability for HAN, HAN derivatives or hydroxylamine, and compositions containing them has been, and continues to be, a concern for which solutions are sought.
      <br/>
      The need exists to enhance the storage stability of HAN, HAN derivatives or hydroxylamine and compositions containing them.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      Certain stabilizers for HAN, HAN derivatives and hydroxylamine are known.
      <br/>
      Some have been used to protect compositions containing HAN, HAN derivatives and hydroxylamine from unwanted degradation during storage prior to use.
      <br/>
      As disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 3,145,082, chelating agents, such as the tetrasodium salt of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) have been used as stabilizers for hydroxylamine.
      <br/>
      The prior art further teaches the use of aminophosphonic acids as stabilizers for HAN-based liquid propellant (LP) compositions.
      <br/>
      This is set forth in a technical report by R. Hansen et al., entitled "Processes for Assessing the Thermal Stability of HAN-Based Liquid Propellants, Final Report," BRL-CR-635, Ballistic Research Laboratory, Aberdeen Proving Ground, Md. (Jul., 1990).
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      There exists a continuing need to develop and provide means for which to provide enhanced stability to HAN, HAN derivatives and hydroxylamine, as well as for compositions comprising these.
      <br/>
      Being able to accomplish this in a cost-effective fashion is further desirable.
      <br/>
      The present invention provides a solution to meet the needs described.

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="17">
      The stability of HAN, HAN derivatives or hydroxylamine, and compositions comprising these, has been found to be considerably enhanced by adding/mixing into said HAN, HAN derivative or hydroxylamine or composition comprising these, a stabilizing effective amount of a stabilizer selected from (a) a pyridine or pyridone salt, or an acid thereof (Type I stabilizer); (b) a diphosphonate or methylenephosphonate salt, or an acid thereof (Type II stabilizer); or (c) a mixture of two or more stabilizers, wherein at least one is selected from (a) and at least one is selected from (b), above (Type III stabilizer).

    <p num="21">
      As already noted, storage stability is not only a problem for HAN, HAN derivatives and hydroxylamine, but it is also an issue for compositions containing them, such as propellants of the type described above.
      <br/>
      The storage stability issue can be demonstrated, for illustration purposes only, as follows: Hydroxylamine cations are present in a propellant composition comprising HAN.
      <br/>
      These cations are susceptible to, i.e., iron catalyzed decomposition.
      <br/>
      This decomposition results in the production of nitrogen oxides and nitric acid which causes the composition to become unstable.
      <br/>
      Due to this decomposition, the shelf life of the propellant composition is detrimentally affected.
      <br/>
      It is, therefore, desirable to control the generation of nitric acid or inhibit the formation of nitric acid in these compositions in order to improve their stability.
    </p>
    <p num="22">
      The present invention provides a solution to this problem, and provides for compositions comprising HAN, an HAN derivative and/or hydroxylamine, i.e. propellant compositions, having enhanced storage stability.
      <br/>
      The storage stability is enhanced by employing the stabilizers within the scope of the present invention.
      <br/>
      A process for producing such stabilized compositions is further described.
    </p>
    <p num="23">
      Ideally, all propellants, including those containing HAN, HAN derivatives and/or hydroxylamine, should have a shelf life of approximately 20 years.
      <br/>
      The present invention provides a means to achieve or exceed this shelf life goal.
    </p>
    <p num="24">(a) Pyridine or Pyridone Salt, or an Acid thereof as Stabilizers (Type I Stabilizers).</p>
    <p num="25">
      It has now been surprisingly found, in accordance with the present invention, that the stability against chemical degradation of HAN-, HAN derivative--and hydroxylamine-containing compositions is considerably enhanced by the incorporation into the compositions of a stabilizing effective amount of a select pyridine or pyridone stabilizer.
      <br/>
      Although numerous pyridine or pyridone type stabilizers within the scope of the present invention accomplish the stabilizing effect sought, the preferred pyridine or pyridone type stabilizer is the sodium salt of 2-hydroxypyridine-N-oxide ("NaHPNO"), which is commercially available.
      <br/>
      Without wishing to be bound by any particular theory, it is believed that the sodium ion in the stabilizer transchelates with soluble iron present in, or entering the HAN-, HAN derivative- or hydroxylamine-containing composition or propellant formulation from an outside source, to form a stable iron complex with the pyridine-N-oxide.
      <br/>
      As additional soluble iron enters the composition, for example from a storage container during storage and prior to use of the composition, additional formation of iron complex with the pyridine-N-oxide occurs.
    </p>
    <p num="26">
      The inventors have found that iron contaminated LP XM46, when treated with NaHPNO, exhibited a decomposition onset temperature significantly greater than that of pure LP XM46 as measured by Accelerated Rate Calorimetry (ARC).
      <br/>
      Note Example 1, below.
      <br/>
      This illustrates the significant stabilizing effect of the stabilizer additive to said HAN-containing propellant composition.
    </p>
    <p num="27">
      Other, pyridine or pyridone type stabilizers within the scope of the present invention include: 2-hydroxy4-methoxy-pyridine-N-oxide; 1,2-dimethyl-3-hydroxy-pyridine4-one; 4-methyl-pyridine-N-oxide; 6-methyl-pyridine-N-oxide; 1-methyl-3-hydroxypyridine-2-one; and combinations thereof.
      <br/>
      The stabilizers within the scope of the present invention may be employed in their acid form, or in their salt form, such as an alkali metal or alkaline earth metal salt, as well as salts made using Group IA metals, Group IIA metals and the transition metals, especially iron, nickel, chromium, copper and zinc.
      <br/>
      Other useful salt forms of these various stabilizers include the amine salts, lower alkylamine salts and alkanolamine salts.
    </p>
    <p num="28">Additional pyridine or pyridone type stabilizers within the scope of the present invention include zinc pyrithione, copper pyrithione, manganese pyrithione, nickel pyrithione, cobalt pyrithione, bismuth pyrithione, zirconium pyrithione, 1-hydroxy-6-substituted pyridiones having a 6-position substituent selected from --O--R and --S--R, wherein R is a substituted or unsubstituted hydrocarbon radical having between 1 and 20 carbon atoms, and combinations thereof.</p>
    <p num="29">Representative structural formulas for various pyridine and pyridone stabilizers further within the scope of the present invention may be represented by the structural formulas set forth below as Formulas I, II and III.  (Chemical Structure image '1' not included in text)</p>
    <p num="30">wherein X is a moiety selected from the group consisting of --SH, --OH, and --NH2, n is an integer of 1 or 2, and R is hydrogen, a lower alkyl or a lower alkoxy group having from one to six carbon atoms;  (Chemical Structure image '2' not included in text)</p>
    <p num="31">wherein R' is a moiety selected from the group consisting of hydrogen and a lower alkyl group having from one to six carbon atoms; and  (Chemical Structure image '3' not included in text)</p>
    <p num="32">wherein R" is a moiety selected from the group consisting of hydrogen and a lower alkyl group having from one to six carbon atoms, and R" is a lower alkyl or lower alkoxy group having from one to six carbon atoms.</p>
    <p num="33">
      The pyridine or pyridone stabilizers within the scope of the present invention are to be employed into the composition to be stabilized in a stabilizing effective amount.
      <br/>
      They are suitably employed at a concentration range of approximately 0.0001% to 2% by weight of said composition.
      <br/>
      The preferred concentration level of the pyridine or pyridone stabilizer is 10 to 1000 parts per million (milligrams per kilogram) of the HAN-, HAN derivative- or hydroxylamine-containing composition to be stabilized.
    </p>
    <p num="34">(b) Diphosphonate or Methylenephosphonate Salt, or Acid thereof as Stabilizers (Type II Stabilizers).</p>
    <p num="35">
      Stability against chemical degradation of HAN-, HAN derivative- and hydroxylamine-containing compositions can also be accomplished within the scope of the present invention by employing into said compositions a stabilizing effective amount of a diphosphonate or methylenephosphonate salt, or an acid thereof as a stabilizer.
      <br/>
      Preferred stabilizers of this type include 1-hydroxyethylidene-1,1-diphosphonic acid and the corresponding tetrasodium salt thereof.
      <br/>
      These stabilizers are commercially available and are manufactured by Monsanto and marketed under the tradenames of Dequest 2010 and Dequest 2016D, respectively.
      <br/>
      Note Formula IV herein.
      <br/>
      Additional preferred stabilizers are hexamethylenediaminetetra(methylenephosphonic acid) and the corresponding hexapotassium salt, commercially available and manufactured by Monsanto, as well, and marketed under the tradenames Dequest 2051 and Dequest 2054, respectively.
      <br/>
      Note Formula V herein.
    </p>
    <p num="36">
      Diphosphonate or methylenephosphonate type stabilizers within the scope of the present invention also include: aminotri(methylenephosphonic acid) and its corresponding pentasodium salt, commercially available and manufactured by Monsanto and marketed under the tradenames Dequest 2000 and Dequest 2006, respectively (note Formula VI); diethylenetriaminepenta(methylenephosphonic acid) and its corresponding hexasodium salt, commercially available and manufactured by Monsanto and marketed under the tradenames Dequest 2060 and Dequest 2066, respectively (note Formula VI); and combinations thereof.
      <br/>
      These stabilizers may be employed in either their acid or salt form.
    </p>
    <p num="37">
      Phosphonic acids and their corresponding phosophonates are multifunctional metal ion control agents.
      <br/>
      They may be used as metal sequestrants, as deflocculants for resulting precipitates, and as surface coating or passive film on metal alloys having components with an affinity to phosphonates.
      <br/>
      By definition, phosphonic acids contain at least one --PO3 H2 functional group attached to a carbon atom.
      <br/>
      When the above stabilizers are added to a propellant composition comprising HAN, an HAN derivative or hydroxylamine, for example, they form a chelate with any undesired contaminating metal ion, i.e. Fe, that may be present to form a water soluble complex.
      <br/>
      Metal ions may be present in the propellant composition from either the propellant composition itself or they may have been inadvertently introduced into the propellant by accident or contact with other materials.
    </p>
    <p num="38">
      The dispersive properties of diphosphonate or methylenephosphonate salts or acids make the agglomeration of growing crystals and other particulates more difficult.
      <br/>
      Diphosphonate or methylenephosphonate salts or acids thereof are strongly adsorbed onto surfaces, thus imparting repulsive charges and dispersion of solids.
      <br/>
      In addition to the ability of these stabilizers to deflocculate and disperse solids, they have the added characteristic of being able to maintain such systems in a dispersed state for an extended period of time because of their excellent hydrolytic stability.
    </p>
    <p num="39">The inventors have found that iron-contaminated LP XM46, when treated with a stabilizing effective amount of Dequest 2010, Dequest 2016D, Dequest 2051 or Dequest 2054, for instance, exhibited a decomposition rate that was significantly reduced from that of merely LP XM46 contaminated with iron as measured by titrimetric analysis of nitric acid buildup generated as the HAN in the LP XM46 decomposes.</p>

      These diphosphonate or methylenephosphonate type stabilizers are employed in the present invention at concentration levels of between approximately 0.0001% wt. to 2% wt. of the solution to be stabilized.
      <br/>
      The preferred concentration level of these stabilizers is between 10 to 3,000 parts per million (milligrams per kilogram) of the HAN-, HAN derivative- or hydroxylamine-containing composition to be stabilized.

    <p num="54">(c) Combination of Pyridine or Pyridone Type Stabilizers (Type I) with Diphosphonate or Methylenephosphonate Type Stabilizers (Type II) Provide Enhanced Stabilizing Effect (=Type III Stabilizers).</p>
    <p num="55">
      It has been determined within the scope of the present invention that the stability of HAN, HAN derivatives and hydroxylamine and compositions containing HAN, an HAN derivative or hydroxylamine is more greatly enhanced by employing a stabilizer mixture (Type III stabilizer) comprising effective stabilizing amounts of (a) at least one pyridine and/or pyridone type stabilizer described above (Type I stabilizer), and (b) at least one diphosphonate or methylenephosphonate type stabilizer also described above (Type II stabilizer).
      <br/>
      Specific combinations, in specific proportions, of said Type I stabilizers and Type II stabilizers have been found to provide an unexpected, synergistic stabilizing effect when added to HAN, HAN derivatives and hydroxylamine or compositions comprising HAN, an HAN derivative or hydroxylamine.
    </p>
    <p num="56">
      As previously noted, controlling the generation of strong acid (i.e., nitric acid) in compositions comprising HAN, an HAN derivative or hydroxylamine improves the stability of these compositions.
      <br/>
      The alkali metal salts, for example, of both Type I and Type II stabilizers have been observed to act as weak bases in compositions comprising HAN, an HAN derivative or hydroxylamine.
      <br/>
      The presence of these stabilizers neutralizes excess strong acid which may be present in said compositions as a result of slow decomposition or due to the manufacturing process itself.
      <br/>
      If a stabilizing effective amount of these stabilizers, either individually or together, is employed, prolonged shelf life of the composition is observed.
      <br/>
      However, it has also been noted that if sufficient alkali metal salts, or combinations thereof, of these stabilizers are added to said compositions, an undesirable condition of apparent negative acidity may be produced, as determined by titrimetry.
      <br/>
      This condition of negative acidity is due to the liberation of free bases, such as hydroxylamine, triethanolamine or diethylhydroxylamine, depending on the initial composition of the HAN-, HAN derivative or hydroxylamine-containing composition (i.e., propellant).
      <br/>
      The negative acidity further leads to the decomposition of the far less stable free bases, such as hydroxylamine, and generation of N2 O and N2 gases in a quantity commensurate with the negative acidity content of the composition.
      <br/>
      In this negative acidity condition, the response of the HAN-, HAN derivative-, or hydroxylamine-containing propellant, for example, to the stimuli provided by Hazard Classification, Insensitive Munition and Vulnerability/ Survivability testing is seriously degraded.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, it is desirable to employ appropriate amounts of stabilizers such that a desirable, controlled level of acidity is attained.
    </p>
    <p num="57">
      It has been demonstrated that mixtures of Type I and Type II stabilizers can be formulated so that they can be used to control the initial acidity of these compositions to the desired level.
      <br/>
      Being able to control the initial acidity of said compositions translates to a composition having greater stability.
      <br/>
      Moreover, it has been determined and demonstrated that employing these types of stabilizer mixtures, in specific proportions, provide enhanced, synergistic, stabilizing effect to these compositions.
    </p>
    <p num="58">
      Using Type III stabilizers, one having ordinary skill in the art will be able to produce, for example, a propellant having an acid content, by specification, in the range of approximately 0% wt.&lt;apparent acidity&lt;0.05% wt. calculated as nitric acid.
      <br/>
      The lower apparent acidity level is selected to prevent the liberation of free amines, such as hydroxylamine, which are not very stable and decompose and provide serious problems when mechanical stimuli are applied.
      <br/>
      The upper apparent acidity level is selected to provide flexibility in attaining a propellant with desirable properties.
    </p>
    <p num="59">
      As set forth above, the undesirable property of negative acidity can result by employing excess Type I or Type II stabilizers into these propellant compositions.
      <br/>
      Any negative acidity may be countered by knowing the change in acidity produced by the single Type I or Type II stabilizer and then tailoring the initial propellant formulation to suit.
      <br/>
      For example, 0.1% wt. NaHPNO (Type I stabilizer) causes the apparent acidity of a tested propellant to move 0.045% wt. in the negative direction.
      <br/>
      Similarly, 0.2% wt. NaHPNO causes the apparent acidity to move 0.09% wt. in the negative direction.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, if a propellant composition contained 0.1% wt. NaHPNO, the manufacturer of the propellants would need to produce an initial propellant mixture having an apparent acidity of 0.045% wt. so that the final stabilized propellant composition employing NaHPNO would meet specification.
      <br/>
      If the propellant composition contained 0.2% wt. NaHPNO, the initial propellant mixture should be produced to have an apparent acidity of 0.09% wt. Employing the Type III stabilizers within the scope of the present invention, as can be seen in Example 3, provides a manufacturer of compositions comprising HAN, an HAN derivative or hydroxylamine (i.e., propellants) with a simple, very effective processing tool to control the apparent acidity of these compositions while at the same time provide enhanced stability to them.
      <br/>
      Use of the stabilizer herein provides a manufacturer with great flexibility in attaining a propellant, for example, with desirable properties.
    </p>
    <p num="60">
      The Type III stabilizers are employed in the present invention in the concentration level of between approximately 0.0001% to 2% by weight of the solution to be stabilized.
      <br/>
      The preferred concentration level of these Type III stabilizers is such that the pyridine or pyridone salt component (Type I) is present in said composition in an amount of from about 10 to about 1,000 parts per million, and the diphosphonate or methylenephosphonate salt component (Type II) is present in said composition in an amount of about 10 to about 3,000 parts per million (milligrams per kilogram) of the HAN-, HAN derivative- or hydroxylamine-containing composition to be stabilized.
    </p>
    <p num="61">
      In addition to the stabilizers within the scope of the present invention, ingredients such as those expected to form buffering solutions in acid media may be mixed with, for example, diphosphonate or methylenephosphonate salts, or the acids thereof.
      <br/>
      Examples of suitable buffer-forming compounds include dibasic ammonium citrate and bis(2-hydroxyethyl)iminotris(hydroxymethyl)-methane.
    </p>
    <p num="62">
      In accordance with the present invention, the stabilizers described above (Type I, Type II and Type III) may be suitably employed to stabilize HAN, HAN derivatives and hydroxylamine, as well as compositions comprising HAN, an HAN derivative or hydroxylamine.
      <br/>
      More specifically, the stabilizers within the scope of the present invention may be suitably employed in propellant compositions comprising HAN, an HAN derivative or hydroxylamine and various fuels, such as, for example only, triethanolammonium nitrate, diethylhydroxylammonium nitrate, or the trinitrate salt of tris(2-aminoethyl)amine.

      Sample Preparation: LP XM46+NaHPNO+Fe
    </p>
    <p num="68">
      A stock solution of iron-containing LP XM46 was prepared by weighing out 18.4 mg of ferric nitrate nonahydrate �Fe(NO3)3 * 9H2 O� and placing it into a 50 mL volumetric flask which was then filled to the 50 mL line with LP XM46 (specific gravity=1.45).
      <br/>
      An evaluation sample was prepared by weighing out 14.5 mg of NaHPNO.
      <br/>
      The 14.5 mg NaHPNO was placed in a one ounce Teflon PFA (perfluoroalkoxy) bottle to which 10 mL of the stock solution of iron-containing propellant, LP XM46+Fe, was pipetted in.
      <br/>
      The evaluation sample corresponds to a propellant composition comprising 0.1% wt. NaHPNO and 35 ppm of iron as a contaminant.
      <br/>
      This sample was shaken well and submitted for evaluation by Accelerated Rate Calorimetry (ARC).
      <br/>
      A separate sample of Neat LP XM46 and a sample of iron-containing LP XM46 stock solution were evaluated by ARC as well.
    </p>
    <p num="69">1) Accelerated Rate Calorimetry</p>
    <p num="70">
      In an ARC evaluation, a sample is placed in a sealed tantalum container in the adiabatic chamber of the instrument.
      <br/>
      The sample is heated to a predetermined temperature and held, while watching for any temperature exothermic reaction.
      <br/>
      If none is observed, the sample is further heated to the next predetermined temperature level.
      <br/>
      This process is repeated until an exothermic reaction is detected.
      <br/>
      The ARC method is very precise, having a detection level of 0.02 degrees per minute.
      <br/>
      The ARC evaluation was conducted for neat LP XM46 (no Fe), LP XM46 containing 35 ppm iron (as prepared above) and for the NaHPNO stabilizer evaluation sample (as prepared above), which contains 0.1% wt. NaHPNO, LP XM46 and 35 ppm iron.
    </p>
    <p num="71">The ARC onset temperature for neat LP XM46 was 125 (degree)  C., while the onset temperature for LP XM46 with 35 ppm Fe was 112 (degree)  C. ARC evaluation of the NaHPNO stabilizer evaluation sample had an onset temperature of 150 (degree)  C.</p>
    <p num="72">
      It is clear from this ARC evaluation that NaHPNO has a stabilizing effect on LP XM46 with 35 ppm Fe.
      <br/>
      The fact that the NaHPNO sample composition which comprises NaHPNO, LP XM46 and 35 ppm Fe had an onset temperature higher than that for neat LP XM46 suggests that more than simple chelation of the iron is occurring, since the onset temperature is significantly higher than that for the neat LP XM46.
      <br/>
      This suggests that the iron complex of NaHPNO may be acting as a stabilizer in some additional, unanticipated fashion.
    </p>
    <p num="73">2) Acid Generation Rate Screening Test</p>
    <p num="74">
      Iron catalyzed decomposition of HAN-based propellants is accompanied by an increase in the nitric acid level, which further destabilizes the propellant composition.
      <br/>
      Hence, it is within the interest of the present invention to control the nitric acid level or inhibit the formation of nitric acid in these propellants; therefore, increasing their stability.
      <br/>
      The increase in acid as a function of time and iron content can be determined titrimetrically using standard techniques.
      <br/>
      This can be used to indirectly follow the effect of iron on the propellant system and of iron chelators, stabilizers, that inhibit the decomposition of the propellant.
    </p>
    <p num="75">
      The samples used were prepared as set forth in A, above, except that the iron concentration was adjusted to 50 ppm, as opposed to 35 ppm, in order to accelerate the rate of the experiment.
      <br/>
      Moreover, the stabilizers used to chelate the iron, so as to inhibit acid formation, were NaHPNO and the sodium salt of 2-mercaptopyridine-N-oxide (NaMPNO).
      <br/>
      Obviously when the sample using NaMPNO was prepared, NaMPNO was substituted for NaHPNO in A above.
      <br/>
      The samples were each placed in an oven at 65 (degree)  C. for a total of 260 hours.

      Evaluation of the samples was conducted at various time intervals.

      The onset of decomposition of the resulting composition, as determined by ARC, was between 140 (degree)  C. and 150 (degree)  C. HAN, without the addition of NaMPNO, was determined to decompose at 126 (degree)  C. The increased decomposition temperature provided by the NaMPNO-containing HAN composition illustrates the stabilizing effect of NaMPNO on said HAN containing composition.

      The bottles containing the samples were then placed in a 50 (degree)  C. water bath.

      Heating samples of LP XM46 at elevated temperatures is a standard technique for simulating the effect of long-term aging on the propellant as well as accelerating the rate of propellant decomposition.

    <p num="91">
      Decomposition of HAN-containing propellants, whether the propellants start out as containing iron or not, is accompanied by an increase in nitric acid concentration.
      <br/>
      In the propellant samples containing iron, the iron acts as a catalyst in the decomposition of the propellant and accordingly in the generation of nitric acid.
      <br/>
      As the nitric acid level increases, further destabilization of the HAN-containing propellant occurs.
      <br/>
      The increase in the concentration of nitric acid, as a function of time, can be used to follow the effect of iron on the propellant stability and on the effectiveness of the stabilizer (i.e., NaHPNO) used in inhibiting or reducing the generation of the acid, and therefore, inhibiting the decomposition of the sample propellant.
      <br/>
      The sample compositions comprising the stabilizer were evaluated for excess acid by taking monthly aliquots of approximately 10 ml from each sample and analyzing them for excess acid using standard titrimetric techniques.
      <br/>
      The results of the analysis and the relative rates of acid generation for the test samples comprising the stabilizer and those not are plotted in FIG. 2.
      <br/>
      Note from FIG. 2 that the presence of NaHPNO in the propellant compositions, both with and without iron, dramatically reduced the generation of acid.

    <p num="111">(Type III Stabilizers)</p>
    <p num="112">
      It has been discovered, and within the scope of the present invention, that a mixture of said Type I (pyridine or pyridone type) and Type II (Dequest type) stabilizers, described above, provides for an enhanced stabilizing effect on HAN, HAN derivatives and hydroxylamine and compositions comprising at least one of said HAN, HAN derivatives or hydroxylamine.
      <br/>
      The combination of said stabilizers, in specific proportions provides for a synergistic stabilizing effect on the types of compositions described herein.
      <br/>
      Moreover, it has been found and demonstrated by the present invention that a mixture of Type I and Type II stabilizers, specifically a mixture of Dequests and NaHPNO, can be used to adjust the initial acid level of LP XM46 during its manufacturing process so as to provide effective storage stable properties to the propellant.
      <br/>
      Samples of various stabilizer combinations were evaluated and prepared as set forth below.
    </p>
    <p num="113">
      Type III stabilizers comprise effective stabilizing amounts of Type I and Type II stabilizers.

      A method for determining the amounts of each Type I and Type II stabilizer to employ into said HAN-, HAN derivative-, or hydroxylamine-containing composition to provide an enhanced stabilizing effect is described herein.

      Method to Adjust Initial Acidity of LP XM46 and Determine the Amounts of NaHPNO, Dequest 2010 and Dequest 2016D to Employ to Stabilize LP XM46
    </p>
    <p num="116">
      It has been specifically demonstrated that a mixture of NaHPNO, Dequest 2010, and Dequest 2016D can be used to adjust the initial acid level of LP XM46 during its manufacturing process.
      <br/>
      Adjusting the initial acid level of LP XM46 using this mixture has been found to provide for a propellant composition having greater stability properties.
      <br/>
      This combination of Type I and Type II stabilizers has been demonstrated as providing greater stability to propellant compositions than use of the individual stabilizer components themselves.
    </p>
    <p num="117">
      The synergistic effect has been demonstrated for compositions having specific proportions of said stabilizers.
      <br/>
      These proportions can be determined, for instance, in the following manner:
    </p>
    <p num="118">
      For example purposes only, when a solution of LP XM46 is made containing 0.1% wt. NaHPNO, the apparent acidity of the propellant decreases according to the following equation �1�:
      <br/>
      %Apparent Acidity=%Initial Acidity-0.045%   �1�
    </p>
    <p num="119">
      Since the specification limits for acidity in acceptable propellants are 0&lt;apparent acidity&lt;0.05%, a "desired shift" is defined.
      <br/>
      The "desired shift" in acidity is the change in acidity required, as a result of applying equation �1�, to adjust the total acidity back into this acceptable range.
      <br/>
      The "desired shift" may be obtained by simultaneously solving the following equations, �2� and �3�, to determine the weight ratio of Dequest 2010 to Dequest 2016D to be added to the LP XM46 propellant composition already containing 0.1% wt. NaHPNO:
      <br/>
      x+y=82  �2�
    </p>
    <p num="120">(Equation image '1' not included in text)</p>
    <p num="121">
      wherein x equals the number of parts by weight of Dequest 2010 and y equals the number of parts by weight of Dequest 2016D in an 82 part mixture of Dequest 2010 and Dequest 2016D.
      <br/>
      It is important to note that either x or y may equal zero, in which case the Type III stabilizer composition would comprise NaHPNO and a single Dequest component.
    </p>
    <p num="122">
      Use of these equations can be demonstrated as follows: If the desired shift in acidity is +0.01%, then solving equations �2� and �3� yields 46 parts by weight of Dequest 2010 of the 82 part mixture of Dequest 2010/Dequest 2016D and 36 parts by weight of Dequest 2016D.
      <br/>
      Stated differently, of the 82 parts of the Dequest 2010/Dequest 2016D mixture, 56.1% would be Dequest 2010 and 43.9% would be Dequest 2016D.
    </p>
    <p num="123">
      If the desired target of Dequest 2016D alone had been 0.1% (amount of active anion to sequester approximately 100 ppm Fe), only 0.048% of Dequest 2016D is added.
      <br/>
      Similarly, if the desired target of Dequest 2010 alone had been 0.118% (equivalent to the same number of moles of anion as 0.1% Dequest 2016D), only 0.062% of Dequest 2010 is added.
      <br/>
      To meet the desired shift in acidity of 0.01%, 165 mg of NaHPNO, 102 mg of Dequest 2010, and 80 mg of Dequest 2016D is added to 165 grams of LP XM46.
    </p>
    <p num="124">Given the interrelationship set forth above between the specific stabilizer ingredients in this Type III stabilizer and depending on the initial acid content of a propellant, one skilled in the art would be able to adjust the concentration of stabilizer components needed to achieve a stable propellant composition.</p>

      To said container, 1460 grams of LP XM46 was added.

      This was prepared by adding 330 mg of NaHPNO, 204 mg of Dequest 2010 and 160 mg of Dequest 2016D to 330 grams of LP XM46.

    <p num="128">
      An evaluation sample was prepared by mixing 80 grams of the first stock solution containing Fe with 80 grams of the second stock solution containing the stabilizers in a polyethylene bottle.

      It has been specifically demonstrated that a mixture of NaHPNO, Dequest 2051, and Dequest 2054 can be used to adjust the initial acid level of LP XM46 during its manufacturing process.

      As with the previous Type III stabilizer composition, adjusting the initial acid level of LP XM46 using this mixture provides for a propellant composition having greater stability properties.

      Stabilization of HAN and HAN Derivative Based Propellants
    </p>
    <p num="157">
      It has been demonstrated above that a stabilizer mixture of NaHPNO with Dequests can be successfully used to adjust the initial acid level of LP XM46 during its manufacturing process.
      <br/>
      It has further been demonstrated that these stabilizer mixtures were even more effective as stabilizers in LP XM46 than their individual component ingredients--synergy was observed.
      <br/>
      This example will illustrate that mixtures of these stabilizers are effective as stabilizers when used in other high energy propellant systems containing HAN and an HAN derivative.
      <br/>
      Propellant systems having higher energy than LP XM46 were selected for further evaluation of these stabilizers.
      <br/>
      The selected propellants are LGP 4640 and LGP 4440.
      <br/>
      The composition of these propellants is set forth in Table 1.

      Double strength stock solutions of LGP 4640 and LGP 4440 containing 20 ppm Fe and 40 ppm Fe were prepared using Fisher A.C.S. Certified Fe (NO3)3 * 9H2 O in a fashion similar to that described in Example 2 for LP XM46.
    </p>
    <p num="160">
      To these propellant compositions, double strength stock solutions of candidate stabilizers to be evaluated were added.
      <br/>
      Candidate stabilizers used are mixtures comprising NaHPNO, Dequest 2010 and Dequest 2016D; and mixtures comprising only Dequest 2010 and Dequest 2016D (without NaHPNO).
