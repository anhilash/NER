    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">This invention relates to compounds and pharmaceutical compositions containing such compounds useful for treating diseases by raising the level of cyclic adenosine-3',5'-monophosphate (cAMP) through the inhibition of phosphodiesterase IV (PDE 4).</p>
    <p num="3">
      Many hormones and neurotransmitters modulate tissue function by elevating intra-cellular levels of 3',5'-cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP).
      <br/>
      The cellular levels of cAMP are regulated by mechanisms which control synthesis and breakdown.
      <br/>
      The synthesis of cAMP is controlled by adenyl cyclase which may be directly activated by agents such as forskolin or indirectly activated by the binding of specific agonists to cell surface receptors which are coupled to adenyl cyclase.
      <br/>
      The breakdown of cAMP is controlled by a family of phosphodiesterase (PDE) isoenzymes, which also control the breakdown of guanosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (cGMP).
      <br/>
      To date, nine members of the family have been described (PDE 1-9) the distribution of which varies from tissue to tissue.
      <br/>
      This suggests that specific inhibitors of PDE isoenzymes could achieve differential elevation of cAMP in different tissues, �for reviews of PDE distribution, structure, function and regulation, see Beavo &amp; Reifsnyder (1990) TIPS, 11: 150-155, Nicholson et al (1991) TIPS, 12: 19-27 and Houslay et al (1998) Adv. Pharmacol. 44: 225-342�.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      The availability of PDE isotype selective inhibitors has enabled the role of PDEs in a variety of cell types to be investigated.
      <br/>
      In particular it has been established that PDE 4 controls the breakdown of cAMP in many inflammatory cells, for example, basophils (Peachell P. T. et al., (1992) J. Immunol. 148 2503-2510) and eosinophils (Dent G. et al., (1991) Br. J. Pharmacol. 103 1339-1346) and that inhibition of this isotype is associated with the inhibition of cell activation.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, elevation of cAMP in airway smooth muscle has a spasmolytic effect.
      <br/>
      Consequently PDE 4 inhibitors are currently being developed as potential anti-inflammatory drugs particularly for the prophylaxis and treatment of asthma, by achieving both anti-inflammatory and bronchodilator effects.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      The application of molecular cloning to the study of PDEs has revealed that for each isotype there may be one or more isoforms.
      <br/>
      For PDE 4, it is has been shown that there are four isoforms (A, B, C and D) each coded for by a separate gene in both rodents (Swinnen J. V. et al., (1989) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 86 5325-5329) and man (Bolger G. et al., (1993) Mol. Cell Biol. 13 6558-6571).
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      The existence of multiple PDE 4s raises the prospect of obtaining inhibitors that are selective for individual isoforms, thus increasing the specificity of action of such inhibitors.
      <br/>
      This assumes that the different PDE 4 isoforms are functionally distinct.
      <br/>
      Indirect evidence in support of this comes from the selective distribution of these isoforms in different tissues (Swinnen et al., 1989; Bolger et al., 1993; Obemolte R. et al., (1993) Gene 129 239-247, ibid) and the high degree of sequence conservation amongst isoforms of different species.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      To date full length cDNAs for human PDE 4A, B, C and D (Bolger et al., 1993 ibid; Obernolte et al., 1993 ibid; Mclaughlin M. et al., (1993) J. Biol. Chem. 268 6470-6476, Owens et al (1997) Cell. Signal., 9: 575-585) and rat PDE 4A, B and D (Davis R. et al., (1989) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 86 3604-3608; Swinnen J. V. et al., (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266 18370-18377), have been reported, enabling functional recombinant enzymes to be produced by expression of the cDNAs in an appropriate host cell.
      <br/>
      These cDNAs have been isolated by conventional hybridisation methods.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      The design of PDE 4 inhibitors for the treatment of inflammatory diseases such as asthma, has met with limited success to date.
      <br/>
      Many of the PDE 4 inhibitors which have been synthesised have lacked potency and/or inhibit more than one type of PDE isoenzyme in a non-selective manner.
      <br/>
      PDE 4 inhibitors that are relatively potent and selective for PDE 4, are reported to be emetic as well.
      <br/>
      Indeed this side effect has been so universal that experts have expressed their belief that the emesis experienced upon administration of a PDE 4 inhibitor, may be mechanism based.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      One object of the present invention is to provide heterosubstituted pyridines derivatives that are inhibitors of PDE 4 at concentrations at which they have little or no inhibitory action on other PDE isoenzymes.
      <br/>
      These compounds inhibit the human recombinant PDE 4 enzyme and also elevate cAMP in isolated leukocytes.
      <br/>
      The compounds thus prevent, alleviate or reduce inflammation in the lungs, such as that induced by carrageenan, platelet-activating factor (PAF), interleukin-5 (IL-5) or antigen challenge.
      <br/>
      The compounds also suppress the hyperresponsiveness of airway smooth muscle seen in inflammed lungs.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      Another object of the present invention is to provide compounds that have good oral activity and that at orally effective doses, exhibit a reduced incidence of the side-effects associated with known PDE 4 inhibitors, such as rolipram.
      <br/>
      The compounds of the invention are therefore of use in medicine, especially in the prophylaxis and treatment of asthma and other inflammatory conditions.

    <p num="101">LPS AND FMLP-INDUCED TNF- ALPHA  AND LTB4 ASSAYS IN HUMAN WHOLE BLOOD</p>
    <p num="102">
      Whole blood provides a protein and cell-rich milieu appropriate for the study of biochemical efficacy of anti-inflammatory compounds such as PDE 4-selective inhibitors.
      <br/>
      Normal non-stimulated human blood does not contain detectable TNF- ALPHA  and LTB4.
      <br/>
      Upon stimulation with LPS, activated monocytes expresss and secrete TNF- ALPHA  up to 8 hours and plasma levels remain stable for 24 hours.
      <br/>
      Published studies have shown that inhibition of TNF- ALPHA  by increasing intracellular cAMP via PDE 4 inhibition and/or enhanced adenylyl cyclase activity occurs at the transcriptional level.
      <br/>
      LTB4 synthesis is also sensitive to levels of intracellular cAMP and can be completely inhibited by PDE 4-selective inhibitors.
      <br/>
      As there is little LTB4 produced during a 24 hour LPS stimulation of whole blood, an additional LPS stimulation followed by tMLP challenge of human whole blood is necessary for LTB4 synthesis by activated neutrophils.
      <br/>
      Thus, using the same blood sample it is possible to evaluate the potency of a compound on two surrogate markers of PDE 4 activity in the whole blood.
    </p>
    <p num="103">
      Fresh blood was collected in heparinized tubes by venipuncture from healthy human volunteers (male and female).
      <br/>
      These subjects had no apparent inflammatory conditions and had not taken any NSAIDs for at least 4 days prior to blood collection.
      <br/>
      Five hundred  MU L aliquots of blood were pre-incubated with either 2  MU L of vehicle (DMSO) or 2  MU L test compound at varying concentrations for 15 minutes at 37 (degree)  C. This was followed by the addition of either 10  MU L vehicle (PBS) as blanks or 10  MU L LPS (1  MU g/ml final concentration, Sigma Chem, -L-2630 from E. coli, serotype 0111:B4; diluted in 0.1% w/v BSA (in PBS)).
      <br/>
      After 24 hours of incubation at 37 (degree)  C., another 10  MU L of PBS (blank) or 10  MU L of LPS (1  MU g/ml final concentration) was added to blood and incubated for 30 minutes at 37 (degree)  C. The blood was then challenged with either 10  MU L of PBS (blank) or 10  MU L of fMLP (1  MU M final concentration, Sigma Chem -F-3506; diluted in 1% w/v BSA (in PBS)) for 15 minutes at 37 (degree)  C. The blood samples were centrifuged at 1500 * g for 10 minutes at 4 (degree)  C. to obtain plasma.
      <br/>
      A 50  MU L aliquot of plasma was mixed with 200  MU L methanol for protein precipitation and centrifuged as above.
      <br/>
      The supernatant was assayed for LTB4 using an enzyme immunoassay kit (Cayman Chemicals -520111) according to the manufacturer's procedure.
      <br/>
      TNF- ALPHA  was assayed in diluted plasma (in PBS) using an ELISA kit (Cistron Biotechnology) according to manufacturer's procedure.

    <heading>ANTI-ALLERGIC ACTIVITY IN VIVO</heading>
    <p num="104">
      Compounds of the invention have been tested for effects on an IgE-mediated allergic pulmonary inflammation induced by inhalation of antigen by sensitised guinea pigs.
      <br/>
      Guinea pigs were initially sensitised to ovalbumin under mild cyclophosphamide-induced immunosuppression, by intraperitoneal injection of antigen in combinations with aluminium hydroxide and pertussis vaccine.
      <br/>
      Booster doses of antigen were given two and four weeks later and at six weeks, animals were challenged with aerosolised ovalbumin whilst under cover of an intraperitoneally administered anti-histamine agent (mepyramine).
      <br/>
      After a further 48 h, bronchial alveolar lavages (BAL) were performed and the numbers of eosinophils and other leukocytes in the BAL fluids were counted.
      <br/>
      The lungs were also removed for histological examination for inflammatory damage.
      <br/>
      Administration of compounds of the Examples (0.001-10 mg/kg i.p. or p.o.), up to three times during the 48 h following antigen challenge, lead to a significant reduction in the eosinophilia and the accumulation of other inflammatory leukocytes.
      <br/>
      There was also less inflammatory damage in the lungs of animals treated with compounds of the Examples.

    <heading>SPA BASED PDE ACTIVITY ASSAY PROTOCOL</heading>
    <p num="105">Compounds which inhibit the hydrolysis of cAMP to AMP by the type-IV cAMP-specific phosphodiesterases were screened in 96-well plate format as follows:</p>
    <p num="106">
      In a 96 well-plate at 30 (degree)  C. was added the test compound (dissolved in 2  MU l DMSO), 188 ml of substrate buffer containing �2,8-3 H� adenosine 3',5'-cyclic phosphate (cAMP, 100 nM to 50  MU M), 10 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EDTA, 50 mM Tris, pH 7.5. The reaction was initiated by the addition of 10 ml of human recombinant PDE-IV (the amount was controlled so that .about.10% product was formed in 10 min.).
      <br/>
      The reaction was stopped after 10 min. by the addition of 1 mg of PDE-SPA beads (Amersham).
      <br/>
      The product AMP generated was quantified on a Microbeta 96-well plate counter.
      <br/>
      The signal in the absence of enzyme was defined as the background. 100% activity was defined as the signal detected in the presence of enzyme and DMSO with the background subtracted.
      <br/>
      Percentage of inhibition was calculated accordingly.
      <br/>
      IC50 value was approximated with a non-linear regression fit using the standard 4-parameter/multiple binding sites equation from a ten point titration.
