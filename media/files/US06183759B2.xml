    <heading>PRIOR ART</heading>
    <p num="2">
      In recent years, there has been a progressive increase in the damage to hair, such damage includes an increase in the hydrophilic nature of the surface of hair, the damage by hair cuticles on the surface and even structural change in the cortex of the hair, damage due to various chemical treatment and beauty treatment, including permanent wave, hair-dyeing and so on, and also damage due to the effect of ultraviolet rays and waste gases.
      <br/>
      Such damage to hair may cause split hair, broken hair, poor gloss and color, poor feel to the touch and the like.
      <br/>
      As a measure for preventing such damage to hair or recovering the original nature of damaged hair, there have been proposed various cosmetic compositions for hair, including shampoo, hair rinse, hair treatment and the like, which contain acylated peptides imparted with an ability of surface-activation and an ability of decreasing friction on the surface of hair by acylating, with a higher fatty acid, a hydrolysate of a protein which is known to have an ability to retain moisture.
      <br/>
      For example, the patent publication JP-A-63-105000 discloses various cosmetic compositions for hair containing an acylated peptide which is obtained by the acylation of a casein-derived peptide with an acyl group having 8-20 carbon atoms.
      <br/>
      The patent publication JP-B-4-60086 discloses a shampoo containing an acylated peptide obtained by acylating a peptide having an average molecular weight of 200-1,000 with a fatty acid halide having 8-22 carbon atoms.
    </p>
    <p num="3">It is also proposed to incorporate these acylated peptides into cosmetic composition for skin in order to give protection of and retention of moisture in the skin.</p>
    <p num="4">
      Satisfactory effects for the prevention of damage to hair and recovery from damaged hair, however, has not been obtained by incorporating these known acylated peptides into a cosmetic composition for hair.
      <br/>
      Particularly unsatisfactory are the effects on the feel of the hair, the feeling during use or the like.
    </p>
    <p num="5">In addition, unsatisfactory is the feel to the touch, the feeling during use or the like has been shown for cosmetic compositions of the poor art for skin.</p>
    <p num="6">As a result of extensive studies for solving the problems of the known cosmetic composition for hair and cosmetic composition for skin, the present inventors have found that satisfactory effect for the prevention of damage to hair and the recovery from damaged hair, and further, a drastic improvement in feel to the touch, moist feel, gloss and the like can be obtained by incorporating, in a cosmetic composition for hair, an acylated peptide or a salt thereof which is obtainable by condensing a protein-derived peptide produced by hydrolysis of a protein, with a specific lanolin fatty acid.</p>
    <p num="7">
      The present inventors have further found the fact that a cosmetic composition containing such acylated peptide or a salt thereof has sufficient ability to protect and retain skin and excellent feeling upon use.
      <br/>
      Thus, the present invention has been completed.

      <br/>
      That is, they can be obtained by converting a known lanolin fatty acid or a lower alcohol ester thereof to a orate thereof which is then distilled to separate the non-hydroxyl lanolin fatty acid or a lower alcohol ester thereof from the borate of a hydroxyl lanolin fatty acid or a lower alcohol ester thereof.
      <br/>
      Hoverer, the process for the production thereof is not limited and may be any process that can give a fatty acid having the above-described composition.
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      The protein-derived peptide used in the present invention can be obtained by hydrolyzing a protein with an acid, an alkali or a proteolytic enzyme.
      <br/>
      The molecular weight of the protein-derived peptide is usually 100-30,000 and preferably 200-5,000. (Molecular weight of protein-derived peptide in this specification means number average molecular weight unless otherwise indicated.) It is possible to adjust the molecular weight of the protein-derived peptide by appropriately selecting the amount of an acid, an alkali or a proteolytic enzyme, the reaction temperature or the reaction time.
      <br/>
      The production of the protein-derived peptide used in the present invention can be carried out by a process and under conditions similar to those described in the patent publication JP-A-63-105000, JP-B-4-60086 and others.
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      The protein used for the production of the peptide is preferably a natural protein.
      <br/>
      Among natural proteins, collagen, keratin, silk protein, casein, soybean protein and wheat protein are particularly preferred.
      <br/>
      Soybean protein is a protein obtained from soybean and the like, which can be obtained, for example, by extracting defatted soybean seed with water, followed by precipitation at isoelectric point at pH 4-5.
      <br/>
      Wheat protein is a protein obtained from wheat and the like, which can be obtained, for example, by extracting defatted wheat seed with water, followed by precipitation at isoelectric point.
      <br/>

    </p>
    <p num="20">
      Various peptides commercially available can also be used as the protein-derived peptide used in the present invention.
      <br/>
      Examples of the peptides commercially available include collagen-derived peptide (Crotein A, manufactured by Croda Japan Co., Ltd.), keratin-derived peptide (Promois WK-HP, manufactured by Seiwa Kasei Co., Ltd.), silk protein-derived peptide (Promois Silk-700SP, manufactured by Seiwa Kasei Co., Ltd.), casein-derived peptide (Promois Milk-P, manufactured by Seiwa Kasei Co., Ltd.), soybean protein-derived peptide (Hydrosoy 2000SF, manufactured by Croda Japan Col., Ltd.) and wheat protein-derived peptide (Hydrotriticum 2000, manufactured by Croda Japan Co., Ltd.).
    </p>
    <p num="21">
      The condensation of the non-hydroxyl lanolin fatty acid with the protein-derived peptide can be carried out according to the following manner.
      <br/>
      That is, a protein-derived peptide is most generally acylated according to Schotten-Baumann reaction with a non-hydroxyl lanolin fatty acid halide in an aqueous solution under an alkaline condition at pH 7-14, preferably at pH 8-10, to give an acylated peptide.
      <br/>
      In this reaction, pH is maintained by adding an alkali, such as sodium hydroxide or potassium hydroxide, little by little in order to avoid the lowering of pH during the progress of the reaction.
      <br/>
      The reaction is carried out at a temperature of 0-60 (degree)  C., preferably of 20-40 (degree)  C., for 1-6 hours.
      <br/>
      Acid halide is most generally acid chloride but may be another acid halide such as acid bromide or acid iodide.
    </p>
    <p num="22">
      Other methods than the above-described Schotten-Baumann reaction can also be adopted, such as a method in which anon-hydroxyl lanolin fatty acid or a lower alcohol ester thereof is subjected to dehydration-condensation or dealcoholization-condensation with a protein-derived peptide at an elevated temperature of 150-200 (degree)  C. under an elevated pressure.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, a method can be adopted in which a protein-derived peptide is reduced to give a product having a thiol group and then said product is heated together with a non-hydroxyl lanolin fatty acid in the presence or absence of an acid or an alkaline catalyst to give an ester.
    </p>
    <p num="23">
      The acylated peptide obtained in this manner can be incorporated as it is into a cosmetic composition after neutralization.
      <br/>

      <br/>
      The acylated peptide thus obtained may be used either in the free form or may be converted into a salt form by neutralization.
      <br/>
      The acylated peptide may be used in the form of a solution in water, alcohol or a polyhydric alcohol such as propyleneglycol and the like or in the form of a dried powder.
      <br/>
      The concentration of the solution is preferably 10 to 60% by weight and more preferably 20 to 40%.
      <br/>
      Preferred alkali used for neutralization includes caustic alkali such as sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide and the like, ammonia, or an organic alkanolamine such as monethanolamine, diethanolamine, triethanolamine, 2-amino-2-methyl-1,3-propanediol and the like.
