    <heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">The present invention relates to the field of security systems and, more particular, to a security system for installation in a vehicle.</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="3">
      Vehicle security systems are widely used to deter vehicle theft, prevent theft of valuables from a vehicle, deter vandalism, and to protect vehicle owners and occupants.
      <br/>
      A typical automobile security system, for example, includes a central processor or controller connected to a plurality of vehicle sensors.
      <br/>
      The sensors, for example, may detect opening of the trunk, hood, doors, windows, and also movement of the vehicle or within the vehicle.
      <br/>
      Ultrasonic and microwave motion detectors, vibration sensors, sound discriminators, differential pressure sensors, and switches may also used as sensors.
      <br/>
      In addition, radar sensors may be used to monitor the area proximate the vehicle.
      <br/>
      The controller also typically operates to give an alarm indication in the event of triggering of a vehicle sensor.
      <br/>
      The alarm indication may typically be a flashing of the lights and/or the sounding of the vehicle horn or a siren.
      <br/>
      In addition, the vehicle fuel supply and/or ignition power may be selectively disabled based upon an alarm condition.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      A typical security system also includes a receiver associated with the controller that cooperates with one or more remote transmitters typically carried by the user as disclosed, for example, in U.S. Pat. No. 4,383,242 to Sassover et al.
      <br/>
      The remote transmitter may be used to arm and disarm the controller in the vehicle or provide other remote control features from a predetermined range outside the vehicle.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      As disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,049,867 to Stouffer and U.S. Pat. No. 5,146,215 to Drori, the controller may include features to store and compare unique codes associated with a plurality of remote transmitters, each remote transmitter having its own unique code initially programmed therein.
      <br/>
      Transmitter codes may be added or deleted from the controller corresponding to the number of remote transmitters desired by the user.
      <br/>
      Unfortunately, a would-be thief gaining access to the controller may readily enter the programming or learn mode and install the code of an unauthorized remote transmitter.
      <br/>
      The owner would thus be unaware of such activity, until the thief returns with the unauthorized remote transmitter to disarm the security system and steal the vehicle.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      A vehicle security system sold by Clifford under the trademark INTELLIGUARD 900 includes random code encryption of messages sent by a remote transmitter.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, a would-be thief who records a transmitted code cannot simply retransmit the same code to gain access to the vehicle.
      <br/>
      Rather, a different code is sent with each transmission of the remote transmitter.
      <br/>
      In other words, the security system is somewhat resistant to being disarmed by a code grabber or a code scanner.
      <br/>
      However, the security system simply ignores signals other than properly encrypted signals.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      In addition, a typical security system includes a valet switch, for example, to permit the system to enter the so-called valet mode, wherein the alarm functions are disabled.
      <br/>
      The valet mode permits authorized use the vehicle by a technician or valet without concern for the vehicle alarm inadvertently being triggered.
      <br/>
      Typically, the valet switch is positioned away from plain view in the vehicle.
      <br/>
      A vehicle security system sold under the mark VIPER included the ability to enter the valet mode via a remote transmitter.
      <br/>
      The remote activation disabled security features of the system, but left convenience features still operable.
    </p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="8">In view of the foregoing background, it is therefore an object of the invention to provide a vehicle security system and related method having a more secure valet operation.</p>
    <p num="9">
      This and other objects, features and advantages in accordance with the invention are provided by a vehicle security system comprising a controller being switchable to a valet mode based upon determining a plurality of successive activations of a valet switch with each activation comprising at least one operation of the valet switch, and with at least one change in ignition switch position between successive activations of the valet switch.
      <br/>
      The security system also preferably includes at least one vehicle sensor, an ignition monitor for determining whether a vehicle ignition switch is in an off position or an on position, an alarm indicator for indicating an alarm, and all of which are preferably connected to the controller.
      <br/>
      The controller may be switchable to an armed mode in which the controller is capable of generating an alarm responsive to triggering of the at least one vehicle sensor.
      <br/>
      The controller when switched as explained above stops or prevents the generation of an alarm indication so that the user may still use the vehicle despite failure or loss of a remote transmitter, for example.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      The controller may be switchable to the valet mode based upon determining the ignition switch being in the on position during each activation of the valet switch.
      <br/>
      In addition, the at least one change in ignition switch position may comprise a change to the off position.
    </p>
    <p num="11">
      The vehicle security system may also comprise at least one remote transmitter to be carried by the user, and a receiver at the vehicle for receiving signals from the at least one remote transmitter.
      <br/>
      The controller may be connected to the receiver for switching between an armed mode and a disarmed mode responsive to the at least one remote transmitter.
      <br/>
      In addition, the at least one remote transmitter may use a pseudorandom code.
    </p>
    <p num="12">
      A method aspect of the invention is for switching a vehicle security system to a valet mode responsive to activation of a valet switch and based upon the ignition switch position to provide enhanced security.
      <br/>
      More particularly, the method may include switching the controller to a valet mode based upon determining a plurality of successive activations of the valet switch with each activation comprising at least one operation of the valet switch, and at least one change in ignition switch position between successive activations of the valet switch.

    <p num="14">
      The present invention will now be described more fully hereinafter with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which preferred embodiments of the invention are shown.
      <br/>
      This invention may, however, be embodied in many different forms and should not be construed as limited to the embodiments set forth herein.
      <br/>
      Rather, applicants provide these embodiments so that this disclosure will be thorough and complete, and will fully convey the scope of the invention to those skilled in the art.
      <br/>
      Like numbers refer to like elements throughout.
    </p>
    <p num="15">
      Referring first to the schematic block diagram of FIG. 1, the vehicle security system 10 according to the invention is first described.
      <br/>
      The security system includes a controller 11 which, in turn, in the illustrated embodiment, includes a central processing unit or microprocessor 12 operating under stored program control.
      <br/>
      A receiver 13 is connected to the microprocessor 12 for receiving signals from a remote transmitter as will be described in greater detail below.
      <br/>
      An antenna 13a is illustratively connected to the receiver 13.
      <br/>
      In the illustrated embodiment, the microprocessor is also operatively connected to a memory (EEPROM) 14 and a conventional input interface 15 and an output interface 16.
    </p>
    <p num="16">
      In the illustrated embodiment, the input interface 15 is connected to various vehicle inputs including: an ignition switch 20; a key in the ignition sensor 21; two zone sensors 22a, 22b; and conventional trunk hood and door pin switches 23, 24, and 25, respectively.
      <br/>
      In addition, a pre-warn sensor 26 and valet switch 27 also provide inputs to the controller 11 in the illustrated embodiment.
      <br/>
      As would be readily understood by those skilled in the art, other inputs are also contemplated by the present invention and are generally described herein by the term sensor.
    </p>
    <p num="17">
      The output interface 16 of the controller 11 may preferably be connected to a plurality of outputs.
      <br/>
      As shown in FIG. 1, the outputs may include auxiliary relay outputs 30, such as for window control or remote starting, as would be readily understood by those skilled in the art.
      <br/>
      A siren and/or lights 31, and green and red light emitting diodes (LEDs) 32, 33 for dashboard mounting are also connected to the controller 11.
      <br/>
      Other outputs are directed to a valet LED 34, a dome light 36, and indicator 37, a central lock 41, a starter kill circuit 42, and an armed relay output 43.
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      Referring now additionally to FIG. 2, a remote transmitter 50 in accordance with the invention is described.
      <br/>
      The remote transmitter 50 includes a housing 51 and a plurality of first momentary contact switches 52a-52d carried by the housing.
      <br/>
      A second momentary contact switch 53 and an indicating light, such as the LED 54 are also carried by or mounted on the housing 51.
      <br/>
      As would be readily understood by those skilled in the art, the remote transmitter 50 is typically relatively small and includes an opening 55 for facilitating connection to a vehicle keyring.
      <br/>
      In addition, the remote transmitter 50 includes a central processing unit or microprocessor 56 operatively connected to the plurality of first switches 52a-52d, the second switch 53, and the LED 54.
      <br/>
      The microprocessor is also connected to a transmitter circuit 57 and its associated antenna 57a for transmitting signals to the controller 11 of the vehicle security system 10.
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      The controller 11 preferably includes remote transmitter adding means for permitting addition of a coded remote transmitter 50 capable of switching the controller between armed and disarmed modes.
      <br/>
      In the armed mode the controller 11 is capable of generating an alarm via alarm indication means, such as the siren and/or flashing lights 31.
      <br/>
      The controller 11 generates the alarm responsive to at least one of the vehicle sensors, such as the trunk, hood and door switches 23, 24 and 25, or the other sensors 22a, 22b as would be readily understood by those skilled in the art.
      <br/>
      In the disarmed mode the controller 11 does not generate an alarm responsive to the vehicle sensors.
    </p>
    <p num="20">
      Referring now additionally to FIG. 3, an aspect of the vehicle security system 10 relating to protection against unauthorized disarming of the vehicle security system 10 is described.
      <br/>
      The controller 11 preferably comprises remote transmitter verification means for generating a signal based upon a number of coded remote transmitters 50 capable of switching the controller from the armed mode to the disarmed mode.
      <br/>
      The remote transmitter verification means preferably comprises indicating means for indicating to a user a number of coded remote transmitters.
      <br/>
      In other words, indicating means, such as a dashboard mounted light emitting diode 32, 33 may be flashed a number of times corresponding to the number of coded remote transmitters.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, the user is ensured that only the coded remote transmitters 50 under his control may operate the vehicle security system 10.
      <br/>
      Should the user determine that an unauthorized remote transmitter has been added or coded to operate the controller 11, the controller also preferably includes means for deleting the newly added transmitter or all of the coded remote transmitters capable of switching the controller between the armed and disarmed modes.
    </p>
    <p num="21">
      The controller 11 preferably includes ignition monitoring means 20 for determining whether a vehicle ignition switch is in an off position or an on position as monitored at Block 61 and when the controller is in the disarmed mode (Block 60).
      <br/>
      If the ignition is switched on (Block 63), the number of coded transmitters is determined (Block 65).
      <br/>
      The controller 11 also preferably includes activating means for activating an LED 31, 32 to indicate the number of coded transmitters 50 at Block 67 responsive to turning the vehicle ignition to the on position and when the controller is in the disarmed mode.
      <br/>
      The number of coded transmitters 50 may be repeated for a predetermined time, such as ten seconds, at Block 68.
      <br/>
      The verification feature is then stopped (Block 69).
      <br/>
      If unsure, the driver could turn the ignition off, and then back to the on position, to again verify the number of coded remote transmitters 50.
    </p>
    <p num="22">
      Another aspect of the invention relates to receiving coded transmission from the remote transmitter 50.
      <br/>
      The controller 11 further preferably comprises decoding means, such as for switching the controller from the armed mode to the disarmed mode responsive to receiving a predetermined coded signal from a remote transmitter 50.
      <br/>
      The controller 11 also preferably includes unauthorized code detecting means for generating an alarm based upon receipt of a coded signal other than the predetermined coded signal from the remote transmitter 50.
    </p>
    <p num="23">
      Referring additionally to the flow chart of FIG. 4, the decoding means of the controller 11 may comprise pseudorandom decoding means for monitoring received signals (Block 83) and switching the controller 11 between the armed mode (Block 80) and the disarmed mode (Block 82) responsive to receiving a correct pseudorandomly coded signal from the remote transmitter 50 (Block 85).
      <br/>
      Accordingly, the unauthorized code detecting means may comprise means for detecting a previously received pseudorandomly coded signal as determined at Block 87.
    </p>
    <p num="24">
      The unauthorized code detecting means may also comprise means for detecting a code having a length greater than a predetermined length of the coded signal from the remote transmitter as determined at Block 88.
      <br/>
      Whether the code is a repeat of the pseudorandom code or a relatively long code stream, the controller will go to the alarm mode (Block 89) and sound the siren and/or flash the lights, and/or initiate a pager to thereby indicate an alarm.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, not only does the vehicle security system 10 protect the vehicle in which it is installed, but protection may also be provided for nearby vehicles when a would-be thief is using a code grabber or a code scanner.
    </p>
    <p num="25">
      As would be readily understood by those skilled in the art the code grabber records and repeats a previously transmitted code, such as to switch the security system to the disarmed mode, thereby enabling theft of the vehicle.
      <br/>
      The code scanner may be used to try a sequence of codes in the hopes that the disarm code will be generated and received by a vehicle security system, as would also be understood by those skilled in the art.
    </p>
    <p num="26">
      The microprocessor 56 of the remote transmitter 50 preferably generates a pseudorandom code associated to a different function.
      <br/>
      All buttons 52a-52d on the transmitter that control the various functions will transmit a different code or protocol each and every time one of the buttons on the transmitter is pressed.
      <br/>
      The table defined below shows how the assignment of the four illustrated buttons may be related to the functioning of the vehicle security system 10 in one embodiment.
      <br/>
      The microprocessor 56 will have the ability to distinguish the time that each of the buttons 52a-52d has been depressed.
      <br/>
      Hence, two functions will be available per button and the following remote control functions may be readily implemented:

      The second switch 53 carried by the transmitter housing 51 may increment to the next bank of features when momentarily depressed.
      <br/>
      If held depressed, the transmitter causes display of the current bank as indicated by flashing of the LED 54.
      <br/>
      In addition, once a bank besides bank -1 has been selected and no further input is detected by the microprocessor 56, the transmitter 50 may revert back to bank -1 after thirty seconds.
    </p>
    <p num="29">
      The bi-state LED 54 carried by the remote transmitter housing 51 may display information in the following format.

      For buttons 52a-52d, the LED is illuminated steady RED for the duration of transmission whether depressed less than or more than two seconds.
      <br/>
      If the second switch 53 is depressed less than two seconds, the LED flashes GREEN in accordance with bank selected, i.e., if bank 1 is selected, the GREEN LED will flash once.
      <br/>
      Similarly, of the second switch 53 is depressed more than two seconds, the LED 54 indicates the current bank that the transmitter is in, i.e., if bank 4 is selected, the LED will flash GREEN 4 times.
      <br/>
      As long as the second switch is held depressed, the LED will continue to flash its current bank with pauses between flashes.
    </p>
    <p num="30">
      The last feature bank selected may alternately be stored in memory along with its associated coding protocols, and remain stored until such time that the bank is changed.
      <br/>
      Each and every time that the transmitter buttons are activated, the transmitter will transmit the code associated with the bank selected.
      <br/>
      Transmission of a code occurs when the button is released.
      <br/>
      The LED will remain on even once the transmitter button has been released, and until such time that the transmission is complete.

      If the system is disarmed with ignition off and panic activated (driver inside vehicle), the doors of the vehicle will lock, and the system will enter the panic cycle.
      <br/>
      If the system 10 is in drive mode (ignition on) and the panic activated (vehicle being driven), the doors will lock if the doors have not been locked, and the system will enter the panic cycle.
      <br/>
      If the system 10 is armed and the panic activated (doors will be locked, system armed and the driver outside of the vehicle), the doors will unlock and the system will enter the panic cycle.
      <br/>
      Upon closing of the last door, all doors will be locked.
      <br/>
      If a siren has been activated by a trigger condition and the remote panic button is pressed, the system will revert to the panic mode.
      <br/>
      The doors will unlock and the system will enter the panic mode.
    </p>
    <p num="62">
      In all cases, upon the entry into a panic mode, the system 10 will sound the siren for 15 seconds, thereafter look at the ignition switch to check whether it has been switched on.
      <br/>
      If it has been switched on within 15 second period, then the system 10 will revert to whatever mode the system was in prior to the panic mode being initiated.
      <br/>
      If the ignition switch has not been switched on during the 15 second period, then the siren will sound for a further 15 seconds whereafter it will return to its previous mode.
    </p>
    <p num="63">
      In the panic mode, the vehicle security system 10 will allow the driver of the vehicle to start the vehicle.
      <br/>
      This is provided to allow the driver of the vehicle to make a quick escape.
      <br/>
      In all the cases mentioned, the momentary pressing of the arm/disarm button on the remote transmitter 50 will cancel the panic state.
      <br/>
      If the vehicle is being driven, pressing the arm/disarm button momentarily will revert the system to free mode.
      <br/>
      If the panic state has been activated accidentally while the system is in the armed state, upon expiry of the panic cycle, the system will revert to the passive arming cycle for 30 seconds and then revert to the armed state and lock the doors.
      <br/>
      In the panic cycle whenever activated, the hazards will flash in unison with the siren.
    </p>
    <p num="64">
      The remotely activated valet (partial valet) operates as follows.
      <br/>
      When button -4 52d on the transmitter 50 is pressed for 2 seconds while in the disarmed mode (steady RED LED), the system will enter into a partial valet condition.
      <br/>
      Upon entering the partial valet condition, the system bi-state LED will flash GREEN.
      <br/>
      Upon this mode being entered, the system 10 will maintain full operational status with the exception of the following trigger functions:
      <br/>
      Sensor trigger -1
      <br/>
      Sensor trigger -2
      <br/>
      Pre-Warn
      <br/>
      Door switches
      <br/>
      Ignition input
    </p>
    <p num="65">
      Should the trunk and hood be tampered with in the partial valet mode, the system 10 will sound the siren and flash the hazards for the programmed siren duration.
      <br/>
      The following functions will still be available in the partial valet condition:
      <br/>
      Auxiliary -1--4 outputs
      <br/>
      Key in sensor
      <br/>
      Trunk input
      <br/>
      Hood input
      <br/>
      Siren output
      <br/>
      Bi-state LED
      <br/>
      Pager output
      <br/>
      Dome light output
      <br/>
      Indicator output
      <br/>
      Central lock output
      <br/>
      Armed output 500 mA
    </p>
    <p num="66">To exit the partial valet condition, button -4 52d on the transmitter 50 is pressed again when the system is in the partial valet mode (flashing GREEN LED).</p>
    <p num="67">
      A full valet condition in the disarmed state may be entered as follows.
      <br/>
      The full valet condition is achieved by depressing the valet button for 4 seconds while the system 10 is disarmed with the ignition switch of the vehicle in the on position.
      <br/>
      If the ignition switch of the vehicle is off, the system 10 will not register the valet button 27 but instead detect valet forgery.
    </p>
    <p num="68">
      Once the full valet condition has been entered into, the system LED will light up STEADY GREEN and no operational functions will be available from the system.
      <br/>
      When the ignition switch of the vehicle is turned to the on position, the system LED will light up orange.
      <br/>
      To revert the system back to its original condition, the valet button 27 is once again depressed momentarily while the ignition of the vehicle is in the on position.
    </p>
    <p num="69">
      Entering the full valet condition while the system is in the armed state occurs normally when the owner of the vehicle has lost the remote controls 50 to the system, or the remote controls to the system are not functional.
      <br/>
      In this case, the system will be armed and the operator unable to deactivate the system.
      <br/>
      Upon entering the vehicle in the armed state a full alarm trigger to the system will occur.
      <br/>
      A signature valet code is programmed into the system in the installer programming set-up.
      <br/>
      The default of the system is 3 counts.
      <br/>
      During this cycle the user must observe the following procedure to enter the system into a full valet condition:
      <br/>
      1.
      <br/>
      The ignition switch of the vehicle must be turned to the on position.
      <br/>
      2. The valet button must be momentarily pressed either the default 3 times, or the programmed n times that was selected in the installer set-up mode.
      <br/>
      3. The system will now enter the full valet mode condition, or another iteration of turning the ignition off then on, followed by pressing the valet switch for a second number of times may be optionally selected.
      <br/>
      4. All functions on the system will now be overridden and the system bi-state LED will revert to a STEADY GREEN state.
    </p>
    <p num="70">To revert the system back to its original condition, the valet button is depressed momentarily while the ignition of the vehicle is in the on position.</p>
    <p num="71">
      The vehicle security system may also include signature valet forgery detect and alert features for attempting to initiate a full valet condition with the ignition switch in the off position with the system disarmed.
      <br/>
      If the system is in the disarmed state, and attempt is made to initiate a full valet condition without first turning the ignition switch to the on position, the system will respond as following:
      <br/>
      1.
      <br/>
      The system will flash the interior and hazard lights for 30 seconds.
      <br/>
      During this period the system will not recognize the valet switch 27.
      <br/>
      2. Upon expiry of the 30 second period an attempt can once again be made to initiate a full valet condition.
      <br/>
      3. If upon the second attempt at attempting to initiate a full valet condition without first turning on the ignition switch, the system will once again flash the interior and hazard lights for 30 seconds.
      <br/>
      4. If upon the third attempt at trying to initiate a full valet condition without first turning on the ignition switch, the system will flash the interior lights and hazards for 1 minute after which the system will automatically begin passive arming after which the system will enter the fully armed state.
    </p>
    <p num="72">If attempt is made to initiate a full valet condition while the system 10 is in the armed mode without adhering to the conditions of a full valet system in the armed mode, i.e., not entering the correct valet code, and without activating the alarm condition, the system will start a timer for 60 seconds, and flicker the dome light and not the hazards, as these have already been switched on by the activation of the alarm condition, i.e., the opening of the doors.</p>
    <p num="73">
      During the 60 second period, the system 10 will not switch to the valet mode.
      <br/>
      Upon the expiry of the 60 second timer, the system will switch off the dome light, pager and siren, return the system to the armed state, (slow flashing red LED), and flash the interior and hazard lights for 1 minute and turn on the siren for 1 minute.
    </p>
    <p num="74">Upon the expiry of the alarm cycle, the system 10 will revert to passively arming the system followed by fully arming the system.</p>
    <p num="75">
      An intrusion attempt warn away feature can be initiated in the following cases: if the system 10 is disarmed, and the system detects an attempt at intrusion from a shock sensor, the system will immediately begin to passively arm the system.
      <br/>
      If the system is armed (slow flashing RED LED), and an attempt at intrusion is detected, the system will chirp the siren 3 times accompanied by 3 flashes on the hazards.
      <br/>
      In both the above cases, upon disarming the system the system will chirp the siren 3 times and flash the hazards 3 times.
    </p>
    <p num="76">
      Upon selecting the intrusion attempt retention feature from the user program mode, this feature allows the user to determine whether or not the alarm was activated in their absence, and if so, which input triggered the alarm condition.
      <br/>
      The system 10 will store the 5 most current events that activated the alarm condition.
      <br/>
      Once 5 events have been stored, the sixth event will cause the system to erase the first event (LIFO--Last In First Out).
      <br/>
      While in this mode, the number of flashes and color of the bi-state LED will indicate what input triggered the alarm.
    </p>
    <p num="77">Outlined below is a table indicating the number of flashes of the LED and color versus the input that caused the trigger.</p>

      Entry into the User Program Mode is achieved by the following procedure: turn the ignition switch of the vehicle to the on position, press the valet switch 27 and hold for four seconds and release.
      <br/>
      The vehicle security system 10 is now in the full valet mode indicated by a steady ORANGE LED.
      <br/>
      The valet switch 27 is pressed and held for a further four seconds and released.
      <br/>
      The system 10 will confirm audibly via the siren and visually via the bi-state LED that the system is in the User Program Mode.
      <br/>
      While in this mode, the valet button 27 is kept depressed and button -4 52d on the transmitter is pressed to enter the installer program mode.
      <br/>
      In either program mode, the system will revert to a steady GREEN LED which is the first mode in the program.
      <br/>
      An alarm chirp confirms the number.
    </p>
    <p num="80">
      Momentarily pressing the valet switch 27 and releasing it will increment the program mode to the next feature.
      <br/>
      The net result is that the valet switch is used to scroll down the customer or installer set-up menu.
      <br/>
      Each time the valet switch 27 is pressed, the LED 34 mounted in the valet switch housing will change color associated with the feature selected.
      <br/>
      Button -1 52a on the transmitter 50 may then be used to select between the factory default settings and the programmable setting.
      <br/>
      Once the customer program mode has been accessed, and no input is selected by the microprocessor for a period of 30 seconds, the system will revert to the disarmed state.
      <br/>
      In addition, to exit the program mode, the valet switch 27 may be depressed for 4 seconds.
      <br/>
      The system will indicate visually and audibly that the system us out of the program mode.
      <br/>
      The user can exit the program mode at any given time by following the above procedure.
