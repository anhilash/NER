      <br/>
      A semiconductor device geometrical pattern correction process, semiconductor device manufacturing process and geometrical pattern extraction process are provided, which make it possible to eliminate the adverse effect of corner rounding accompanying miniaturization, that is, a decrease in the projection amount of a gate, while avoiding increased chip area.
      <br/>
      The correction process comprises a step 102 of detecting a concave diffusion layer corresponding portion and a step 103 of correcting either the concave diffusion layer corresponding portion or a transistor gate corresponding portion which projects from the concave diffusion layer corresponding portion in order to ensure the projection of the gate from the concave diffusion layer corresponding portion against possible corner rounding.

    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="1">
      1.
      <br/>
      Field of the Invention
    </p>
    <p num="2">
      The present invention relates to a semiconductor device geometrical pattern correction process for making advance changes, in a mask geometrical pattern for use in the manufacture of semiconductor devices or the like in order to obtain a transferred image that is close to a desired design pattern.
      <br/>
      The invention also relates to a semiconductor device manufacturing process and a geometrical pattern extraction process adapted for use in the above correction process.
    </p>
    <p num="3">2. Prior Art</p>
    <p num="4">Current techniques for manufacturing semiconductor devices and the like essentially require a photographic step in which a mask geometrical pattern for semiconductor devices is transferred to a resist material on a semiconductor substrate by use of an exposure light source.</p>
    <p num="5">
      In recent years, miniaturization in semiconductor device manufacturing processes is advancing at a pace faster than that of reduction in the wavelengths of exposure light sources.
      <br/>
      This has brought about a strong need for a photographic step in which transferring is carried out with a pattern having a size equivalent to or less than the wavelength of an exposure light source.
      <br/>
      As a result, there often arises the problem of the difference between a geometrical pattern obtained after transferring and its associated mask geometrical pattern initially designed.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      One of the causes of such a difference in pattern is "corner rounding" which causes, after transferring, depressions in irregular geometry designed as a mask geometrical pattern.
      <br/>
      If a depression occurs in a convex gate portion of a transistor or in a concave diffusion layer portion which receives the projection of a gate, a desired amount of projection of the gate from the diffusion layer can be no longer ensured.
      <br/>
      This leads to electrical continuity between the source and drain of the transistor, resulting in increases in the current of the power source and even a failure in operation in the worst case, where a semiconductor device formed from such a pattern is used.
      <br/>
      As a matter of course, it is necessary to devise a measure to prevent such problematic depressions in semiconductor devices.
    </p>
    <p num="7">With reference to the accompanying drawings, there will be explained one attempt that has been previously made to eliminate the adverse effect of corner rounding on the projection amount of a gate.</p>
    <p num="8">FIGS. 21 and 22 show one example in which no measure is taken to ensure a satisfactory gate projection amount.</p>
    <p num="9">
      In the mask geometrical pattern shown in FIG. 21, a transistor gate 511 projects from a diffusion layer 513.
      <br/>
      In this pattern, a measure to compensate for a decrease in the projection amount of the gate is not taken, and therefore another pattern 512 can be made.
      <br/>
      However, the gate of the mask geometrical pattern shown in FIG. 22 obtained after transferring stands back because of corner rounding so that the source and drain of the diffusion layer are short-circuited.
    </p>
    <p num="10">FIGS. 23 and 24 show one example of conventional techniques for preventing a decrease in the projection amount of a gate.</p>
    <p num="11">
      According to the conventional technique depicted in FIG. 23, a portion which is likely to decrease in projection amount after transferring because of corner rounding is detected at the stage of designing a mask geometrical pattern and the mask geometrical pattern is modified to compensate for possible decreases.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the mask geometrical pattern obtained after transferring has an appropriate gate projection amount in spite of a depression in the gate atributable owing to corner rounding.
    </p>
    <p num="12">
      The above conventional technique, however, reveals the problem that since the projection amount of the gate in the mask geometrical pattern is increased, there is no space to accommodate another pattern 512 because of the occupation of the increased gate portion.
      <br/>
      More specifically, the mask geometrical pattern shown in FIG. 23 which has been modified to compensate for a decrease in gate projection amount does not have a space for the placement of the pattern 512, while the mask geometrical pattern shown in FIG. 21 which has not undergone such modification can include the pattern 512.
      <br/>
      This is a disadvantage to the conventional technique in view of effective space utilization and reduction in chip area.
    </p>
    <p num="13">The area of chips is the most critical factor in determining the cost of chips as well as in developing economically competitive chips.</p>
    <p num="14">The present invention is directed to overcoming the above problems presented by the prior art and one of the objects of the invention is therefore to provide a semiconductor device geometrical pattern correction process, semiconductor device manufacturing process and geometrical pattern extraction process, which are capable of compensating for a decrease in the projection amount of a gate due to corner rounding which accompanies miniaturization, while avoiding increased chip area.</p>
