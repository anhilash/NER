      Field of the Invention
    </p>
    <p num="2">The present invention relates to a golf ball which follows a straight trajectory and has a good run and an increased total distance of travel.</p>
    <p num="3">2. Prior Art</p>
    <p num="4">
      Golf balls have hitherto been provided on the surface with numerous planar circular depressions, or recessed dimples, in order to enhance their aerodynamic properties.
      <br/>
      It is well known that, other factors being equal, golf balls with projections fly better than golf balls which are smooth and lack dimples.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      When a full shot with a driver is taken with a dimpled golf ball, friction with the club head causes the ball to spin, which tends to lower the launch angle.
      <br/>
      To increase the distance traveled by the ball, the spin must be reduced so as to afford a higher launch angle.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      Golf balls are manufactured in accordance with the Rules of Golf, which are the same throughout the world.
      <br/>
      The Rules hold that a regulation ball, meaning an official tournament ball, must have a ball diameter of not less than 42.67 mm (large-size ball).
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      However, a ball with a greater diameter has a larger cross-sectional surface area which, when subjected to the influence of the wind, results in a steeper angle of descent.
      <br/>
      This shortens the run of the ball after it lands and the total distance traveled.
      <br/>
      In addition, the trajectory is more likely to deviate laterally.
    </p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="8">The object of the present invention is thus to provide a golf ball which reduces spin, achieves a high launch angle and a straight trajectory, and has a good run and an increased total distance of travel.</p>
    <p num="9">
      To attain this object, the invention provides a golf ball having a substantially spherical surface.
      <br/>
      It is assumed that an imaginary circle with a radius of 5 mm is traced on the spherical surface and centered at any point on that surface.
      <br/>
      In a first embodiment, 3 to 25 raised projections of at least two types which are different in diameter and/or height and at least 0.01 mm high are contained in the circle.
    </p>
    <p num="10">In a second embodiment, raised projections of at least one type and at least 0.01 mm high and recessed dimples of at least one type are contained in a total number of 3 to 25 in the imaginary circle.</p>
    <p num="11">
      In the golf ball of this invention, the raised projections preferably account for at least about 30% of the surface area of the imaginary circle.
      <br/>
      Moreover, these raised projections, when projected onto the spherical surface, preferably have planar shapes which are circular and 1 mm to 4.2 mm in diameter, and preferably have a total projected surface area that accounts for 30 to 90% of the overall surface area of the golf ball.
      <br/>
      The golf ball of the invention typically has a surface hardness of 50 to 70 in Shore D. The spherical surface serves as land areas around the raised projections, and the ball preferably has a land diameter of not more than 42.66 mm.
    </p>
    <p num="12">
      In the inventive golf ball, from 3 to 25 raised projections of at least two types which are different in diameter and/or height and at least 0.01 mm high are encompassed in an imaginary circle with a radius of 5 mm traced on its spherical surface and centered at any point thereon, or raised projections of at least one type and at least 0.01 mm high and recessed dimples of at least one type are encompassed in a total number of 3 to 25 in the same imaginary circle.
      <br/>
      Preferably, the ball is provided with numerous raised projections such that the ratio of the total projected surface area when these projections are projected onto the ball's spherical surface to the overall surface area of the golf ball (sometimes referred to herein as the "raised projection coverage") is 30 to 90%.
      <br/>
      With this construction, when a full shot with a driver is taken of the ball, the surface area of contact with the club head is much smaller.
      <br/>
      This enables a high launch angle and low spin rate to be achieved, resulting in a very long run and thus a significant increase in the total distance traveled by the ball.
    </p>
    <p num="13">Moreover, the large number of raised projections provided on the golf ball of this invention enable the diameter requirement for large-size balls to be satisfied while allowing the ball to essentially have a smaller diameter which leaves it less subject to influence by the wind and gives it straighter flight characteristics.</p>
    <p num="14">However, since raised dimples and recessed projections are alike other than being raised or recessed with respect to the spherical surface, it is convenient herein to treat both as falling under the concept of a dimple.</p>
    <p num="15">The objects, features and advantages of the invention will become more apparent from the following detailed description.</p>

    </p>
    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="17">
      According to the invention, by providing a large number of raised projections on the spherical surface of a golf ball, the surface area of contact with the club head upon a full shot with a driver is decreased.
      <br/>
      This has the effect of lowering the spin rate, resulting in a higher launch angle and a greater total distance.
    </p>
    <p num="18">First embodiment</p>
    <p num="19">
      In the inventive golf ball, when an imaginary circle with a radius of 5 mm is traced on the ball's spherical surface and centered at any point on that surface, from 3 to 25, preferably from 3 to 12, and more preferably 4 to 8, raised projections are contained in the circle.
      <br/>
      Fewer than 3 raised projections results in a large variability in the launch angle, spin rate, and initial velocity when the ball is struck, whereas more than 25 raised projections adversely affect the lift-drag characteristics thereof so that the ball flies less well.
      <br/>
      The containment of projections "in an imaginary circle with a radius of 5 mm" signifies that at least half of the surface area of the respective projections lies in a circle with a radius of 5 mm.
    </p>
    <p num="20">
      The raised projections preferably occupy at least about 30%, and more preferably about 50 to 90%, of the surface area of the imaginary circle.
      <br/>
      If the raised projections occupy less than about 30% of the imaginary circle, the ball would be hit at a largely varying launch angle, spin rate and initial velocity.
      <br/>
      Any point on the spherical surface of the ball may serve as the center of the imaginary circle having a radius of 5 mm.
      <br/>
      For example, this may even be a point near the poles or near the equator of the ball.
    </p>
    <p num="21">
      Referring to FIG. 1, one raised projection is depicted at 1 on the spherical surface 2.
      <br/>
      The raised projection 1 has a height DP of at least 0.01 mm, and preferably 0.05 to 0.30 mm. When the height of the raised projection is less than 0.01 mm, the difference with the land areas becomes too insignificant for the desired effects of the invention to be achieved.
      <br/>
      Moreover, it is preferred that the raised projections be circular in planar shape, when projected onto the spherical surface of the golf ball.
      <br/>
      The circular raised projections preferably have a diameter DM of 1 mm to 4.2 mm, and more preferably from 2.0 to 3.8 mm. It is also preferred that the raised projections be of at least two types, and especially two to four types, which are different in diameter and/or height.
      <br/>
      The total number of raised projections (which is equal to the total number of dimples if all dimples are raised ones) is generally from 180 to 600, preferably from 372 to 550.
      <br/>
      No particular limit is imposed on the arrangement of these raised projections.
      <br/>
      For example, use may be made of known arrangements which are employed for the recessed dimples.
    </p>
    <p num="22">
      The ratio of the total projected surface area of the raised projections when projected onto the spherical surface of the golf ball to the overall surface area of the ball (raised dimple coverage) is preferably 30 to 90%, and more preferably 50 to 85%.
      <br/>
      If the total projected surface area is less than 30%, the ball would be hit at a largely varying launch angle, spin rate, and initial velocity.
      <br/>
      A total projected surface area of greater than 90% would adversely affect the lift-drag characteristics, causing the ball to fly less well.
    </p>
    <p num="23">Second embodiment</p>
    <p num="24">
      In the golf ball according to the second embodiment, when an imaginary circle with a radius of 5 mm is traced on the ball's spherical surface and centered at any point on that surface, both raised projections of at least one type and at least 0.01 mm high and recessed dimples of at least one type are contained in the circle.
      <br/>
      The total number of raised and recessed dimples in the circle is from 3 to 25, preferably from 3 to 12, and more preferably 4 to 8.
      <br/>
      The objects of the invention are more effectively achieved by the interdispersion of projections raised and recessed dimples in a suitable proportion.
    </p>
    <p num="25">
      The raised projections are of at least one type, preferably one to four types, the number of raised projections is preferably 2 to 24, more preferably 2 to 11 in the circle, and the diameter and height of raised projections are as defined in the first embodiment.
      <br/>
      On the other hand, the recessed dimples are of at least one type, preferably one to three types, the number of recessed dimples is preferably 1 to 12, more preferably 1 to 3 in the circle, and the recessed dimples usually have a diameter of 1.5 to 3.6, preferably 2.0 to 3.6 mm and a depth of 0.08 to 0.20 mm. Areas of recessed dimples account for preferably 5 to 40%, more preferably 7 to 15% of the areas of the raised and recessed projections combined on the ball's surface.
      <br/>
      The remaining parameters are the same as in the first embodiment.
    </p>
    <p num="26">The following description is common to the first and second embodiments.</p>
    <p num="27">Because the golf ball of this invention preferably has a diameter in the land areas of not more than 42.66 mm, and especially 42.3 to 42.6 mm, it satisfies the diameter specification for large-size balls while allowing the diameter of the ball to be essentially smaller than this.</p>
    <p num="28">
      More particularly, even if the ball's "land diameter" (defined herein as the distance, through the center of the ball, from one point on a land area to a point on a land area on the opposite side of the ball; this distance is the diameter of the ball when there are no recessed dimples on the surface) has been made smaller, as in the range mentioned above, than the diameter specified for large-size balls, the ball diameter (defined herein as the distance, through the center of the ball, from the peak of one raised projection to the peak of a raised projection on the opposite side of the ball) is not less than 42.67 mm, and preferably 42.68 to 42.80 mm, because a large number of raised projections are provided on the spherical surface of the ball.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, the ball can be made to satisfy the diameter specification for large-size balls while essentially having a diameter that is smaller, thereby reducing the cross-sectional surface area of the ball so that it is less subject to influence by the wind and able to achieve straighter flight characteristics.
    </p>
    <p num="29">
      So long as the golf ball of the invention is provided with the features described above, other constituent elements and features of the ball are not subject to any particular limitations.
      <br/>
      The art disclosed herein may thus be applied to all types of golf ball, including solid golf balls such as one-piece golf balls, two-piece golf balls, and multi-piece golf balls having three or more layers, as well as thread-wound golf balls.
    </p>
    <p num="30">The surface hardness of the inventive golf ball (generally the surface hardness of the cover, although this refers to the surface hardness of the ball itself in one-piece golf balls) is typically in a range of 50 to 70 Shore D, and especially a range of 58 to 68 Shore D.</p>
    <p num="31">
      The golf ball according to the present invention can be manufactured from known materials by a conventional method.
      <br/>
      Weight and other characteristics of the ball may be set as appropriate under the Rules of Golf.

      As is apparent from the results in Table 4, because all the projections on the golf ball in Example 1 are raised projections, this ball had a much smaller surface area of contact at the time of impact, allowing it to achieve a high launch angle and low spin rate.
      <br/>
      Although this golf ball had a shorter carry than the ball in Comparative Example, it had a very long run, resulting in an increase in the total distance.
      <br/>
      Moreover, the flight time was short, indicating that the ball is less subject to wind effects.
    </p>
    <p num="54">In the golf ball of Example 2, the suitable interdispersion of recessed dimples and raised projections on the surface of the ball enables it to achieve an even higher launch angle and a lower spin rate than when all of the dimples are raised dimples as in Example 1.</p>
    <p num="55">Also, the raised projections provided on the golf balls in Examples 1 and 2 allowed the diameter of these balls in the land areas to be made smaller than the diameter specification for large-size balls (not less than 42.67 mm), giving balls which were less subject to wind effects and had straighter flight characteristics.</p>
    <p num="56">The golf balls of the present invention thus provide a straighter trajectory and a significantly increased run and total distance of travel.</p>
    <p num="57">
      Although some preferred embodiments have been described, many modifications and variations may be made thereto in light of the above teachings.

      It is therefore to be understood that the invention may be practiced otherwise than as specifically described without departing from the scope of the appended claims.
