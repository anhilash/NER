    <heading>PRIOR ART</heading>
    <p num="2">
      The development of innovative pharmaceutical forms for drugs administration to humans and animals has lately been a source for considerable research effort in pharmaceutical technology.
      <br/>
      One of the major innovations in this sector is the targeting of drugs release to a specific site of treatment and/or the release of said drug at a programmed rate.
      <br/>
      The applications thereof are of consequence not only to human and animal health but also to agriculture.
      <br/>
      Very many are the pharmaceutical forms already developed and disclosed in patents, which are capable of releasing the drug at zero-order kinetics.
    </p>
    <p num="3">
      As well known to those skilled in the pharmaceutical art, this means that the pharmaceutical form liberates the drug at a constant rate and over a scheduled period of time.
      <br/>
      In particular, drug release may occur according to the following empirical relation
      <br/>
      Mt/M (infinity)  =Ktn
    </p>
    <p num="4">where Mt/M (infinity)  is the fraction of released substance, K is a constant depending on the diffusion coefficient in the matrix and n is a constant depending on polymeric chains swelling and relaxation rate in swelling front.</p>
    <p num="5">
      Examples of said pharmaceutical forms are amply documented, e.g. in "Novel drug delivery and its therapeutical application" by L. F. Prescott and W. S. Nimmo, J. Wiley, New York, 1989.
      <br/>
      Examples refer to pharmaceutical forms that may be administered by different routes, i.e. oral, transdermic, vaginal, and ocular.
      <br/>
      Obviously, due to the great importance and wide utilization of oral drug administration, many and diverse embodiments are for gastroenteric administration.
      <br/>
      Among the widely known and used embodiments the OROS system, disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,160,020 (1979), should be cited.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      A further achievement in the area is the pharmaceutical form disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,839,177 (1989) and in the subsequent U.S. patent application Ser.
      <br/>
      No. 07/620,577 dated Dec. 3, 1990. Said patents claim the preparation of pharmaceutical forms for oral administration capable of liberating a drug at a constant release rate, i.e. according to zero-order kinetics.
      <br/>
      In particular, the aforesaid patents disclose and claim the preparation of a tablet which, in its simplest form, consists of a hydrophilic matrix containing a drug and suitable excipients allowing the sustained release of the drug.
      <br/>
      The drug sustained release is brought about by gelable hydrophilic polymers, which swell by contact with water and/or aqueous fluids, giving a gelled layer wherefrom the drug is liberated according to Fick's type kinetics.
      <br/>
      The pharmaceutical form claimed in the aforementioned patents is characterized by the matrix being partly coated with a drug-impermeable barrier consisting of a polymeric film insoluble in water or in an aqueous medium, Alternatively, said barrier consists of polymeric mixtures or granular masses with technological adjuvants, applied by compression (Italian patent application No. 22694/89).
      <br/>
      The barrier obtained is drug-impermeable for at least 4-8 hrs and, therefore, hinders drug dispensing from the coated surface.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the hydrophilic drug is exclusively released from the free area, generally at a constant rate.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      However, the prior art does not envisage the possibility of obtaining products capable of releasing one or more drugs at different rates or else of releasing two different drugs sequentially, i.e. releasing the second drug only after releasing the first drug, both being contained in the same pharmaceutical form.
      <br/>
      Several treatments require a sequential administration of two drugs and, therefore, involve complex posologic schemes and scrupulous patient's compliance therewith.
      <br/>
      Obviously, since such compliance is hardly obtainable, the above requirements can often be met only by hospitalized patients, carefully controlled by physicians and paramedical specialists.
      <br/>
      As well known, complex therapeutic schemes are reluctantly accepted and scarcely followed by cut-patients, the correct compliance with posologic schemes being inversely proportional to the treatment complexity and to the number of daily administrations.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      In particular very many are the conditions to be treated with sequentially acting drugs.
      <br/>
      For example, rheumatic night pain is to be treated with two drug doses, one on pain onset and the other at a later time, or with a pharmaceutical form slowly releasing the second dose so that a sufficiently high plasmatic level be maintained.
      <br/>
      In these cases, the pharmaceutical form should be capable of releasing the drug at the same rate as drug elimination.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      As known, steroid and non-steroid anti-inflammatory agents can induce pyrosis and/or gastric mucosa irritation.
      <br/>
      A prior protection of the gastric mucosa by agents, such as sucralphate, aluminium glycinate, activated attapulgite or hydrotalcite, followed by the administration of the potentially gastrolesive drug, can increase the patients' tolerance for said drug.
      <br/>
      Identical remarks can be made about the antibiotic posology, which usually are to be administered at sequential daily doses.
      <br/>
      The same problems are also co be faced with drugs whose active ingredient is a metabolite thereof, the metabolism occurring at different rates in the various organs.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      A typical example is L-dopa used in treating Parkinson's disease.
      <br/>
      In the organism, L-dopa is metabolized to dopamine, which is the drug active ingredient.
      <br/>
      However, only the unmodified form, i.e. L-dopa, is capable of crossing the blood-brain barrier. L-dopa is rapidly absorbed into the gastroenteric tract and spreads out in the various organs and tissues, including the CNS. L-dopa has plasmatic half-life of approx. 1 hr and is converted into dopamine mainly by decarboxylation. L-dopa is rapidly decarboxylated to dopamine also in the gastroenteric tract: hence, the quantity of L-dopa reaching the CNS is extremely low.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, the presence of excess dopamine deriving from peripheral decarboxylation in organs external to the CNS may produce massive side effects.
      <br/>
      Should drugs inhibiting peripheral decarboxylation, such as benserazide or carbidopa, be administered with or before L-dopa administration, the peripheral conversion of L-dopa into dopamine would be drastically reduced and higher amounts of L-dopa would reach the systemic circulation and the brain, where conversion into dopamine produces the desired therapeutic effect.
      <br/>
      Thus, much lower L-dopa doses can have a high therapeutic effect and, at the same time, produce lesser side effects.
    </p>
    <p num="11">In such complex pathological situations, the availability of pharmaceutical compositions capable of liberating different drugs at successive times would solve a therapeutic problem also involving a serious social impact, the treatments being mainly addressed to elderly persons.</p>
    <heading>SUMMARY</heading>

      Various types of all aforesaid polymers, characterized by different physico-chemical, solubility and gelling properties, are commercially available.
      <br/>
      In particular, various types of hydroxypropyl methylcellulose having different molecular weight (from 1,000 to 4,000,000) and different degree of substitution can be used.
      <br/>
      They show different characteristics because, depending on the degree of substitution of the polymeric chain, they are either prevailingly erodible or prevailingly gelable.
      <br/>
      Said adjuvants of the slow release layer are selected from the same group as reported for the immediate or controlled release layer.
      <br/>
      The barrier-type layer formulation consists of polymeric substances, adjuvants, and prasticizers.
      <br/>
      The polymeric substances of the barrier-type layer are selected from the group consisting of hydroxypropyl methylcellulose having molecular weight from 1,000 to 4,000,000, hydroxypropyl cellulose having molecular weight from 2,000 to 2,000,000, glucans, scleroglucans, mannans, xanthans, carboxymethylcellulose and derivatives thereof, ethylcellulose, methylcellulose.

    <p num="21">
      As will be illustrated in more detail in the examples reported hereinafter, also diluents, lubricants, buffers, antiblock and gliding agents, and other substances capable of bringing about the desired characteristics in said layer may be used, as described in the following examples.
      <br/>
      Plasticizing agents are selected from this group consisting of hydrogenated castor oil, fatty acids, substituted triglycerides and glycerides, polyoxyethylene glycols and derivatives thereof having a different molecular weight generally ranging from 400 to 60,000.
      <br/>
      They serve the purpose of making the barrier-type layer as elastic as required.
      <br/>
      The polymeric substances used, in combination with the other adjuvants, to prepare the barrier-type layer, make said layer impermeable to the drug of the adjacent layer for at least 4-6 hrs.

    <p num="22">
      Several drugs may be present in the formulation of the three layers of the compressed tablet of the invention, e.g. anti-inflammatory steroids and non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID), such as diclofenac sodium, indomethacin, ibuprofen, ketoprofen, diflunisal, piroxicam, naproxen, flurbiprofen, tolmentin sodium; antibiotics such as ampicillin, amoxycillin, ceahradine, clavulanic acid, cephachlor, cephalexin, cloxacillin, erythromycin, their salts and derivatives; urogenital antimicrobial agents, such as nitrofurantoin, nalidixic acid, oxolinic acid, pipemidic acid and its derivatives, sleep producing drugs and tranquilizers, such as diazepam, nitrazepam, flurazepam, oxazepam, chlordiazepoxide, medazepam, lorazepam; drugs for the prevention of anginal and hypertensive attacks, such as diltiazem, trapidil, urapidil, benziodarone, dipiridamole, lidoflazine, naphthydrofuryl oxalate, perhexeline maleate, oxyfedrine hydrochloride; and antihistaminics and/or antiasthmatics, such as ephedrine, terfenadine, theophylline, chlorpheniramine.
      <br/>
      The compressed tablets of the invention can be prepared from granular mixtures according to current production techniques: therefore, their production on a commercial-scale can be immediate.
    </p>
    <p num="23">
      For example, compressed tablets can be obtained by rotary presses operating at a pressure of 1000 to 5000 kg/cm2.
      <br/>
      The finished compressed tablets may be further coated with a polymeric film, which passes through the stomach unaltered and is disintegrated in the intestine: the drug can be thus activated and released after reaching the intestinal tract.
    </p>
    <p num="24">The immediate release layer is 0.5 to 5.0 mm thick and has a drug content of 1 to 90% by wt.</p>
    <p num="25">The slow release layer is 0.5 to 5.0 mm thick and has a drug content of 0.5 to 80% by wt.</p>
    <p num="26">The barrier-like layer is 0.1 to 4.3 mm thick and generally does not contain any drug.</p>
    <p num="27">
      As illustrated in the figures, the barrier-type layer may coat one base of the compressed tablet or the side surface and one base.
      <br/>
      The tablets, as per the invention, offer the advantage of releasing the drug or drugs according to a prefixed schedule; therefore lower amounts of drug--in respect of the traditional sustained release tablets--can be administered.
      <br/>
      Dose dumping is thus avoided and specific therapeutic requirements are met by active ingredients sequential liberation.
      <br/>
      The tablets under the invention find very important therapeutic applications, e.g. when one or more drugs are to be administered at different times and when one drug must act immediately and another drug must be long-acting.

      The press was set to feed the first loading station with 235 mg of granular mass A4, equalling 100 mg of drug, the second loading station with 201 mg of granular mass C4, equalling 100 mg of drug, and the third loading station with 60 mg of granular mass B4.
