    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">
      1.
      <br/>
      Field of the Invention
    </p>
    <p num="3">This invention relates to an optical recording medium, and more particularly to an optical recording medium of the heat mode.</p>
    <p num="4">2. Description of Prior Art</p>
    <p num="5">
      The optical recording medium by nature requires no direct contact between the medium itself and the writing/reading head and, therefore, features perfect freedom of the recording medium from degradation by abrasion.
      <br/>
      This salient feature has encouraged a large amount of research and development activities on a wide variety of optical recording media.
    </p>
    <p num="6">Among other optical recording media, the optical recording media of the heat mode are attracting considerable attention from those engaged in research and development activities owing to advantages such as, for example, obviating the necessity for developing recorded images in a dark room.</p>
    <p num="7">
      The optical recording media of this heat mode are designed to operate by making use of the recording beam as the source of heat.
      <br/>
      For example, the recording beam such as the laser beam is utilized to melt, remove, or otherwise incise part of the medium so as to write data in the medium in the form of small holes called "pits".
      <br/>
      By thus inserting pits in prescribed patterns in the medium, information is recorded as desired.
      <br/>
      The information thus recorded in the medium is read out by causing the reading beam to sense the patterns in which pits are arranged.
    </p>
    <p num="8">To cite examples of the optical recording media involving formation of such pits, the type which has a recording layer of a light-absorbing dye superposed on a substrate so that pits are formed by causing the dye to be melted by the recording light, the type which has a recording layer incorporating an autoxidizable compound such as nitrocellulose and a light-absorbing dye superposed on a substrate so that pits are formed by causing nitrocellulose and other materials to be decomposed by the recording light, and the type which has a recording layer of a thermoplastic resin and a light-absorbing dye deposited by spreading on a substrate so that pits are formed by melting the resin and dye are known.</p>
    <p num="9">Incidentally, it has been observed that with a dye such as, for example, the cyanine dye which is used with a light of long wavelength, particularly a laser diode beam, there occur detrimental phenomena such as the degradation of the dye due to the oxidation caused by the red to near infrared light present in ambient light and degradation of the S/N ratio 9 or C/N ratio of the read signal retrieved from the written information (degraded reading signal) owing to repeated exposure of the dye to the reading light.</p>
    <p num="10">
      One plausible explanation of these phenomena is based on a theory that when the dye is excited by the red to near infrared light of long wavelength, energy transfer and consequent formation of singlet oxygen ensue and this singlet oxygen degrades the dye by oxidation.
      <br/>
      The inventors have found that occurrence of these phenomena is abated by incorporating a quencher in addition to the dye in the recording layer.
      <br/>
      They have already disclosed this information to the art.
    </p>
    <p num="11">
      In this case, the quencher assumes an excited state by relieving the singlet oxygen or the dye of the burden of electron transfer or energy transfer and consequently enables itself to resume its normal state.
      <br/>
      When the dye excites itself by absorbing the reading beam and induces formation of singlet oxygen, the quencher converts the singlet oxygen into its triplet state or impedes the formation of singlet oxygen, with the result that the aforementioned degradation of reading signal is notably abated.
    </p>
    <p num="12">With the dye of the type described above, although the degradation due to the oxidation caused by red to near infrared color occurs preponderantly, degradation caused by the ultraviolet to visible light also occurs.</p>
    <p num="13">Even when the recording layer contains a quencher, the disadvantage that the sensitivity of the recording layer to the writing beam and the C/N or S/N ratio of the read signal are degraded after prolonged standing of the recording layer under the room light still persists.</p>
    <p num="14">One well-known optical recording medium of the type involving the formation of pits has a recording layer of tellurium or a tellurium-selenium-arsenic mixture, for example, deposited by the vapor-phase coating technique on a substrate so that formation of pits is accomplished by causing tellurium or a tellurium mixture to be melted.</p>
    <p num="15">In a recording medium of this operating principle, a groove for tracking is formed on the substrate, the recording layer is deposited in a substantially uniform thickness to cover the groove and the uncut surface of the substrate separated by the groove, the portion of the recording layer which overlies the uncut surface separated by the groove, for example, is used as a recording track for formation of pits thereon, and the writing of information is effected on the recording track from the surface side of the recording layer, for example.</p>
    <p num="16">In this case, the thickness of the recording layer is limited to within the range of about 0.01 to 2  MU m so as to maximize the sensitivity of recording and the C/N ratio of the reading signal.</p>
    <p num="17">The groove is formed to detect the beam under polarizing the direction of reflected ray to one direction by interference effect of phase difference based on depth of the groove, when the beam spots for writing/reading starts to come off from the recording track, so it is usually about  LAMBDA 8n ( LAMBDA is a wavelength of the beam light). n is the reflective index of a substrate.</p>
    <p num="18">
      To cite other optical recording media involving formation of pits, the type which has a recording layer of a light-absorbing dye applied by spreading on a substrate so that formation of pits is effected by causing the dye to be melted by the recording beam, the type which has a recording layer of an autoxidizable compound such as nitrocellulose and a light-absorbing dye deposited by spreading on a substrate so that the formation of pits is obtained by causing nitrocellulose and other component to be decomposed, and the type which has a recording layer of a thermoplastic resin and a light-absorbing dye deposited by spreading on a substrate so that the formation of pits is attained by causing the resin and the dye to be melted have become popular �Appl.

    <p num="19">These media which have such various recording layers deposited by spreading on their respective substrates are easy to manufacture because they do not require the vacuum deposition technique.</p>
    <p num="20">
      When a recording layer is superposed on a substrate which has a tracking groove as described above, however, since the recording layer, because of the behavior of any applied fluid coat, is necessarily produced in the form of flat surface film without reference to the presence of absence of the groove, the thickness and the reflectance of the recording layer are different on the depressed surface of the groove and on the surface above the groove.
      <br/>
      As a natural consequence, the deviation of the reflected beam owing to the interference caused by the phase difference is small.
      <br/>
      The optimum thickness of the recording layer which maximizes the writing sensitivity and the C/N ratio, the optimum dimensions of the groove which permits still better control of tracking, and the optimum magnitudes of other physical attributes remain yet to be found.

      When a cyanine dye is selected, this invention manifests its effect to an outstanding extent.
    </p>
    <p num="147">
      Among the cyanine dyes, those represented by the following general formula Ia prove to be particularly: advantageous.
      <br/>
      PHI "'-L= PSI "'(X-)m  (Ia)
    </p>
    <p num="148">In the foregoing general formula Ia,  PHI "' and  PSI "' each denote an aromatic ring such as a benzene ring, a naphthalene ring, an indole ring which may be polycondensed with a phenanthrene ring, a thiazole ring, an oxazole ring, a selenazole ring, an imidazole ring or a pyridine ring, for example.</p>
    <p num="149">
      These  PHI "' and  PSI "' may be the same or different although they are generally similar.
      <br/>
      These rings may each have a varying substituent bonded thereto.
      <br/>
      In this case,  PHI "' has a plus (+) electron charge in the nitrogen atom of the ring and  PSI "' has a neutral nitrogen atom in the ring.
    </p>
    <p num="150">These  PHI "' and  PSI "' are each desired to have any of the backbone rings represented by the aforementioned formulas V through VIII, the formulas XXII through XXXII, and the following formula IX.  (Chemical Structure image '31' not included in text)</p>
    <p num="151">In any of the various rings, the group R5 R5 or R11 bonded to a nitrogen atom of the imidazole ring is a substituted or unsubstituted alkyl group or aryl group.</p>
    <p num="152">
      The number of of carbon atoms in the groups R5, R11 which are bonded to the nitrogen atoms in the ring is not specifically limited.
      <br/>
      If the groups are substituted, examples of the substituent advantageously bonded to the group are sulfonic acid groups, alkylcarbonyloxy groups, alkylamide groups, alkylsulfonamide groups, alkoxyoxy groups, alkylamino groups, alkylcarbamoyl groups, alkylsulfamoyl groups, hydroxyl groups and halogen atoms.
    </p>
    <p num="153">When the symbol m which will be described hereinfater is 0, the group R5 which is bonded to the nitrogen atom in  PHI "' is a substituted alkyl or aryl group and has a minus (-) electron charge.</p>
    <p num="154">
      Where the rings of  PHI "' and  PSI "' are a polycondensed or unpolycondensed indole ring (formula V through VIII), two substituents R6, R7 are desired to be bonded to the 3 position thereof.
      <br/>
      The two substituents R6, R7 which are bonded to 3 position in this case are each desired to be an alkyl group or an aryl group.
      <br/>
      In the alkyl groups and the aryl groups available for this purpose, an unsubstituted alkyl group having one or two, preferably one, carbon atoms proves particularly advantageous.
    </p>
    <p num="155">
      Separately, yet another substituent R8 or R' through R" may be bonded to a prescribed position in any of the rings represented by  PHI "' and  PSI "'. Examples of substituents which proves advantageous in this case include alkyl groups, aryl groups, heterocyclic groups, halogen atoms, alkoxy groups, alkylthio groups, alkyloxycarbonyl groups, alkylcarbonyloxy groups and carboxylic acid groups.
      <br/>
      Generally the number of such substituents (p, q, r, s, t, u, v, w, x, y and z) is either 0 or from 1 to 4.
      <br/>
      Where p, q, r, s, u, v, w, x, y and z each denote an integer of 2 or more, the plurality of R8 's or R' through R"'s may be the same or different.
    </p>
    <p num="156">
      In all the dyes described above, those having a polycondensed or unpolycondensed indole ring as represented by the formulas V through VIII prove to be particularly advantageous.
      <br/>
      This is because they excel in coating property and stability, exhibit very high magnitudes of reflectance, and permit the C/N ratio of read signal to be notably increased.
    </p>
    <p num="157">The symbol L denotes a combining group for formation of a mono-, di-, tri- or tetra-cyanine dye.</p>
    <p num="158">
      It is particularly desired to be any of the combining groups represented by the aforementioned formulas X through XXI preferably the formulas X through XV and formula XVII, and most preferably formulas X and XI. X- denotes an anion.
      <br/>
      Preferred examples of the anion are I-, Br-, ClO4--, BF4--,  (Chemical Structure image '32' not included in text)

    <p num="174">The quenchers for singlet oxygen indicated above can be synthesized in accordance with an ordinary method known to the art.</p>
    <p num="175">Such a quencher for singlet oxygen is incorporated in the recording layer generally in an amount of 0.05 to 12 moles, preferably 0.1 to 1.2 moles, per mole of the aforementioned dye.</p>
    <p num="176">The quencher for singlet oxygen thus used is required to have a maximum absorption wavelength at least 50 nm greater than the maximum absorption wavelength of the dye used in the recording layer.</p>
    <p num="177">
      Even if the quencher for singlet oxygen has no such absorption spectrum characteristic as described above, the singlet oxygen which is generated during the exposure of the recording medium to the reading beam owing to the transfer of energy or electron from the dye to be caused when the dye is excited by the light absorbed from the reading beam is converted by the quencher for singlet oxygen into a triplet state and, consequently, the degradation of the dye owing to the oxidation by the singlet oxygen is precluded and the degradation of reading signal after the recording is also prevented.
      <br/>
      When the optical recording medium using the same quencher is exposed for a long time to the ambient light such as the room light, however, the excitation of the quencher for singlet oxygen predominates over the quencher's expected effect upon the singlet oxygen and, consequently, the dye undergoes degradation by oxidation.
      <br/>
      Thus, the preservability of the optical recording medium in its original state under the ambient light and the preservability of the recorded information in the medium are lower than can be tolerated.
    </p>
    <p num="178">
      By contrast, when the maximum absorption wavelength of the quencher for singlet oxygen is at least 50 nm greater than the maximum absorption wavelength of the dye, the excitation of the quencher for singlet oxygen under the room light, for example, is negligibly small.
      <br/>
      Thus, the preservability of the optical recording medium under such ambient conditions is conspicuously high.
    </p>
    <p num="179">
      To permit size reduction of the whole device, it is desirable to use as the light source for the writing and reading beam either a laser diode rated for 750, 780 or 830 nm or a He--Ne laser rated for 633 nm, for example.
      <br/>
      In this connection, therefore, the maximum absorption wavelength of the quencher for singlet oxygen is required to be not less than 680 nm, desirably to be in the range of 680 to 1500 nm, and preferably to be in the range of 800 to 1500 nm.
    </p>
    <p num="180">The relation between the absorption coefficients of the dye (the actually available value where two or more dyes are used) and the quencher for singlet oxygen is required to be such that, where  EPSILON D denotes the absorption coefficient of the coloring matter and  EPSILON Q the absorption coefficient of the quencher, the ratio of  EPSILON D / EPSILON Q is desired to be not less than 3.</p>
    <p num="181">In case where two or more dyes are simultaneously used in one recording layer, the maximum absorption wavelength and the absorption coefficient  EPSILON D of the combined dyes are actual values of additive averages proportionate to the concentrations of the plurality of dyes involved.</p>
    <p num="182">When this particular ratio is satisfied, the excitation of the quencher for singlet oxygen during the exposure of the optical recording medium to the reading beam is notably adapted and the degradation of reading signal by the singlet oxygen is immensely curbed.</p>
    <p num="183">The quencher possessing such an absorption spectrum characteristic is suitably selected to meet the conditions of the light source and the dye actually used.</p>
    <p num="184">When the optical recording medium is destined to be operated with a laser diode as its light source, the quencher for singlet oxygen which possesses such a desirable absorption characteristic may be one member selected from the group consisting of Q7, Q8, Q17, Q18, Q19, Q38, Q39, Q40 Q41, Q49 and Q47.</p>

      <br/>
      In this case, the dye, the autoxidizable compound, the thermoplastic resin, and the quencher for singlet oxygen are as already described above.
      <br/>
      The reason for the use of two or more quenchers for singlet oxygen in the recording layer is that such use notably diminishes such undesirable phenomena as crystallization, bleed at, and recoagulation of the components used in the recording layer, decreases the decline of S/N ratio or C/N ratio to a remarkable extent during the preservation, and notably improves the preservability of the medium in its original state and the preservability of recorded information.
    </p>
    <p num="186">In this case, although any number of quenchers for singlet oxygen above 2 may be used, it generally suffices to use only two such quenchers.</p>

      The autoxidizable resin which is incorporated in the recording layer is intended to induce oxidative decomposition when it is heated to an elevated temperature.
      <br/>
      Among other autoxidizable resins, nitrocellulose proves to be particularly advantageous.
    </p>
    <p num="253">
      The thermoplastic resin, when incorporated in the recording layer, is intended to soften when the dye is heated by the absorption of the recording beam.
      <br/>
      Any of various known thermoplastic resins can be used for this purpose.
    </p>
    <p num="254">Of the various thermoplastic polymers available at all, those which prove particularly advantageous are as already described above.</p>
    <p num="255">The autoxidizable resin and the thermoplastic resin to be used herein may have any molecular weight.</p>
    <p num="256">The autoxidizable or thermoplastic resin and the dye are generally incorporated in the recording layer in a weight ratio in the range of 1:0.1-100, preferably 1:5-20.</p>
    <p num="257">
      The recording layer is desired to contain additionally a quencher for singlet oxygen.
      <br/>
      The incorporation of the quencher effects notable abatement of the degradation of the medium by the action of the light of long wavelength.
      <br/>
      Examples of the quencher for singlet oxygen are as already described above.
    </p>
    <p num="258">
      The deposition of the recording layer described above on the substrate may be accompoished by spreading the dough prepared for the recording layer on the substrate by an ordinary method known to the art.
      <br/>
      The thickness of the recording layer is generally in the range of 0.03 to 2  MU m. When the recording layer is formed solely of a dye, the deposition of the recording layer may be accomplished by vacuum evaporation, spattering, etc.
    </p>
    <p num="259">This invention also relates to an optical recording medium which has deposited on a substrate a recording layer incorporating therein a light absorbing dye represented by the general formula IV.  (Chemical Structure image '75' not included in text)</p>
    <p num="260">
      wherein A and A' each denote a thiazole ring, an oxazole ring, a selenazole ring, an imidazole ring or a pyridine ring which may have a be condensed with an aromatic ring, R4 and R4 ' each denote a substitutted or unsubstituted alkyl group having not less than four carbon atoms, L denotes a combining group for formation of a mono-, di-, tri- or tetra-cyanine, X- denotes an anion, and m denotes 0 or 1.
      <br/>
      This recording layer may additionally incorporate therein a resin or a quencher for singlet oxygen or both.
    </p>
    <p num="261">
      In the foregoing general formula IV, A and A' each denote an atomic group necessary for the formation of a thiazole ring, an oxazole ring, a selenazole ring, an imidazole ring or a pyridine ring which may have an aromatic ring such as, for example, a benzene ring, a naphthalene ring, or a phenanthrene ring polycondensed thereto.
      <br/>
      A and A' may be the same or different.
      <br/>
      Preferably, however, A and A' are the same.
    </p>
    <p num="262">
      Of all the rings possibly formed by A and A', the atomic groups of A and A' are selected from the groups represented by the following formulas XXXVII through LVII.
      <br/>
      In the following formulas, such atomic groups are collectively expressed in the form of rings formed by A.  (Chemical Structure image '76' not included in text)   (Chemical Structure image '77' not included in text)

    <p num="263">
      In the formulas given above, R5 and R5 ' each denote a substituted or unsubstituted alkyl group or aryl group.
      <br/>
      In this case, the number of carbon atoms of the alkyl group must be not less than 4.
    </p>
    <p num="264">
      When the number of carbon atoms of R5 and R5 ' are less than 4, the effect of this invention cannot be manifested.
      <br/>
      When the numbers of carbon atoms of R5 and R5 ' are excessively large, the absorption coefficient is lowered and the instability is heightened.
      <br/>
      To avoid this trouble, therefore, the numbers of carbon atoms are desired to be in the range of 4 to 19.
      <br/>
      Better results are obtained when the numbers of carbon atoms are limited to the range of 5 to 18.
    </p>
    <p num="265">When R5 and R5 ' are substituted alkyl groups, examples of the substituent which proves advantageous for the substitution involved herein include sulfonic acid group, alkylcarbonyloxy groups, alkylamide groups, alkylsulfonamide groups, alkoxyoxy groups, hydroxyl group, halogen atoms, alkylamino groups, alkylcarbamoyl groups and alkylsulfamoyl groups.</p>
    <p num="266">When the symbol m which will be described afterward is O, R5 possesses a minus (-) electron charge.</p>
    <p num="267">When the substituent involved in the substitution of R5 contains a any carbon atom, the total number of carbon atoms in the substituted alkyl group has only to equal the number mentioned above, but in this case carbonyl carbon is not contained.</p>
    <p num="268">Generally R5 and R5 ' are bonded to the nitrogen atoms in the rings of A and A'.</p>
    <p num="269">Then, R11 denotes a substituted or unsubstituted alkyl group similarly to R5 and R5 '. The number of carbon atoms of R2 is not specifically limited.</p>
    <p num="270">
      R1, R2, R3, R4, R5, R6, R6 ', R7, R8, R9, R10 and R11 each denote a substituent, which is desired to be an alkyl group, an aryl group, a heterocyclic group, a halogen atom, an alkoxy group, an, alkylthio group, an alkylhydroxycarbonyl group or a carboxylic acid group.
      <br/>
      Then, p, q, r, s, t, u, u', v, w, x, y and z each denote an integer of 0 or at least 1.
      <br/>
      Generally, the value of this integer is 0 or 1 to 4.
    </p>
    <p num="271">
      L denotes a combining group for formation of a mono-, di-, tri- or tetra- cyanine dye.
      <br/>
      This combining group is desired to be any of the groups represented by the aformentioned formulas X through XXI. X- and m have the same meanings as mentioned above.
    </p>
    <p num="272">
      Now, concrete examples of the light absorbing dye advantageously useful for this invention will be shown in Table 5 below.
      <br/>
      It should be noted, however, that they are not the only light absorbing dyes with which the present invention can be utilized.

    <p num="299">This invention also relates to an optical recording medium which is formed by placing on a resin substrate an underlying layer selected from the group consisting of titanium oxide film and films of hydrolyzates of Zr and Al chelate compounds and superposing on this underlying layer a recording layer of a dye or a dye composition.</p>
    <p num="300">The recording layer thus formed in the optical recording medium of this invention contains a dye.</p>
    <p num="301">
      The dye used in the recording layer is not specifically limited.
      <br/>
      Examples of the dye usable for this purpose include dyes of cyanine type, phthalocyanine type, naphthalocyanine type, choline or cholol type, anthraquinone type, azo type, triphenylmethane type, pyrylium or thiapyrylium salt type.
    </p>
    <p num="302">Of all these dyes, those of cyanine type enable the effect of this invention to be manifested most conspicuously.</p>
    <p num="303">
      In the dyes of the cyanine type, those represented by the aforementioned general formual Ia are particularly desirable.
      <br/>
      Concrete examples of these cyanine dyes are as already shown in Tables 1 to 4.
      <br/>
      It should be noted, however, that these are not the only dyes with which the present invention.
    </p>
    <p num="304">Such a dye as described above may be used alone to form the entire recording layer.</p>
    <p num="305">Otherwise, the dye may be used in combination with a resin to form the recording layer.</p>
    <p num="306">The resin thus used in combination with the dye to form the recording layer is desired to be of the autoxidizable type or the thermoplastic type.</p>
    <p num="307">
      The autoxidizable resin which is incorporated in the recording layer is intended to undergo oxidative decomposition when the recording layer is heated to an elevated temperature.
      <br/>
      Of all the autoxidizable resins available, nitrocellulose is particularly desirable.
    </p>
    <p num="308">
      The thermoplastic resin incorporated in the recording layer is intended to be softened when the dye is heated to an elevated temperature by absorbing the recording beam.
      <br/>
      Any of various thermoplastic resins known to the art can be used for the purpose.
    </p>
    <p num="309">Of the various thermoplastic resins at all, those which prove to be particularly desirable are as already described above.</p>

    <p num="311">The autoxidizable resin or thermoplastic resin described above and the aforementioned dye are generally incorporated in the recording layer at a weight ratio in the wide range of 1:0.1-100, preferably 1:5-20.</p>
    <p num="312">The recording layer to be formed as described above may additionally include a quencher.</p>
    <p num="313">This quencher serves to abate the degradation of reproduction and enhance the resistance to light.</p>
    <p num="314">
      Any of various types of quenchers can be used for the present invention.
      <br/>
      Particularly a quencher for singlet oxygen which, when the dye is excited by light to liberate singlet oxygen, relieves this singlet oxygen of the burden of electron transfer or energy transfer and consequently assumes an excited state and reverts itself to its basic state and, at the same time, converts the singlet oxygen into a triplet state proves to be desirable.
      <br/>
      Examples of the singlet oxygen quencher are as already described above.
    </p>
    <p num="315">The quencher is incorporated in the recording layer in an amount falling generally in the range of 0.05 to 12 moles, preferably 0.1 to 1.2 moles, per mole of the aforementioned dye.</p>
    <p num="316">The quencher is desired to have a maximum absorption wavelength not less than 50 nm greater than the maximum absorption wavelength of the dye used in the recording layer.</p>
    <p num="317">When the maximum absorption wavelength of the quencher is at least 50 nm greater than the maximum absorption wavelength of the dye, the excitation of the singlet oxygen quencher under room light, etc. is negligibly small, the oxidative degradation of the dye due to otherwise possible loss of the quenching effect is abated, and the preservability of the optical recording medium under the ambient light is notably enhanced.</p>
    <p num="318">
      To permit side reduction of the whole device, it is desirable to use as the source for writing or reading beam a laser diode rated for 750, 780 or 830 nm and a He--Ne laser rated for 633 nm.
      <br/>
      In this connection, the maximum absorption wavelength of the singlet oxygen quencher is desired to be not less than 680 nm, desirably to be from 680 to 1500 nm, and preferably to be from 800 to 1500 nm.
    </p>
    <p num="319">The relation between the absorption coefficient of the dye (the actual avaiable value where two or more dyes are used) and that of the singlet oxygen quencher under the wavelength of the reading beam is desired to be such that the ratio of  EPSILON D / EPSILON Q will be not less than 3 where  EPSILON D denotes the former absorption coefficient and  EPSILON Q the latter absorption coefficient respectively.</p>
    <p num="320">Where two or more dyes are used, the maximum absorption wavelength  EPSILON D of the dyes represents the actual value of additive average to be determined based on the concentration of the individual dyes.</p>
    <p num="321">
      Deposition of this recording layer on the substrate is accomplished as already described above.
      <br/>
      The substrate on which the recording layer is superposed is made of any of a variety of resins.

    <p num="322">This resin may be made of a varying material.</p>
    <p num="323">
      Of the various resins available the preferred are, those which are readily acted upon by the solvent to be used during the deposition of the recording layer on the substrate such as, for example, a ketone type solvent, an ester type solvent, or a halogenated alkyl type solvent, and which permit the effect of the underlying layer of this invention to be conspicuously manifested are resins of the acrylic type or of the polycarbonate type.
      <br/>
      When the substrate is made of an acrylic type resin or polycarbonate type resin, since the resin is substantially transparent to the writing beam and the reading beam, the writing and reading of information on the optical recording medium can be carried out from the rear side of the substrate.
      <br/>
      Thus, the optical recording medium is advantageous in terms of sensitivity and S/N ratio.
      <br/>
      It is also advantageous in terms of the actual fabrication which demands payment of due attention to the protection against dust.
      <br/>
      Since the resin enjoys good moldability, it permits ready formation of a tracking groove on the recording layer.
    </p>
    <p num="324">Examples of acrylic resin advantageously used herein include polymethyl methacrylates and copolymers and homopolymers formed preponderantly of methacrylic esters having alkyl group of one to seven carbon atoms.</p>
    <p num="325">The polycarbonate resin is desired to be of the bis-phenol-A-type.</p>
    <p num="326">When the acrylic resin or polycarbonate resin is a product obtained by the injection molding method, the effect of the underlying layer of this invention is manifested conspicuously.</p>
    <p num="327">The number-averaged polymerization degree of the acrylic resin or polycarbonate resin is from about 800 to 6,000.</p>

      The substrate may be in the shape of disc, card, tape, drum or belt to suit the particular purpose for which the substrate is intended.

      As the recording beam causes the dye in the recording layer to evolve heat, the autoxidizable compound is decomposed or the thermoplastic resin and the dye are melted, with the result that pits are formed in the recording layer.
    </p>
    <p num="357">
      In this case, particularly when there is used a tri- or tetra-carbocyanine dye, highly desirable writing of information in the recording layer is accomplished by using as the source for recording beam a laser diode or photo diode having a wavelength of 750, 780 or 830 nm.
      <br/>
      The pits thus formed in the recording layer can be read out by causing the optical recording medium to be moved or rotated under the reading beam of the same wavelength as mentioned above and detecting the reflected beam or the penetration beam, preferably the reflected beam, originating in the reading beam.
    </p>
    <p num="358">In case where the recording layer contains a thermoplastic resin, the pits once formed in the recording layer may be erased with light or heat so that the recording layer will be readied for reuse.</p>
    <p num="359">As the source for the recording or reading beam, there may be used a He--Ne laser.</p>
    <p num="360">
      Where the optical recording medium is produced by forming an underlying layer on a substrate of transparent resin and superposing a recording layer on the underlying layer, the writing of information in the recording layer is desired to be performed from the rear side of the substrate.
      <br/>
      Further in this case, the reading beam is desired to be projected to the medium from the rear side of the substrate, so that the reading of the pits will be effected by detecting the reflection of the reading beam.
    </p>
    <p num="361">In accordance with this invention, writing of information can be effected with extremely high sensitivity and reading of the information with very high S/N ratio.</p>
    <p num="362">In this case, the preservability of the optical recording medium in its original state and the preservability of the recorded information are both very high.</p>
    <p num="363">
      Further, the recording layer forms pits of highly desirable shape and these pits in this recording layer show very high reflectance as compared with the pits formed in the recording layer using other tri- or tetra-carbocyanine or Ni or Pt dithiol complex as the dye.
      <br/>
      Thus, the C/N ratio of the read signal obtained with the recording layer is extremely high.
    </p>
    <p num="364">
      When the recording layer contains a singlet oxygen quencher, the singlet oxygen which is produced by the energy transfer arising from the cyanine dye in its excited state is effectively converted by this quencher into its triplet state even when the optical recording medium is retained in the presence of infrared light.
      <br/>
      Thus, the degradation of the cyanine dye in the recording layer is notably adapted and, consequently, the preservability of the optical recording medium in its original state and the preservability of the recording information are notably enhanced.
    </p>
    <p num="365">By the same token, the degradation of reading signal by the reading beam is notably diminished.</p>
    <p num="366">Further, optical recording medium enjoys high stability to resist heat and avantageous preservability in its original state and experiences only sparingly low degradation of writing characteristics.</p>
    <p num="367">No degradation of such characteristics occur even when the information once written in the recording layer is erased and replaced with newly written information.</p>
    <p num="368">
      When the underlying layer contemplated by this information is interposed between the substrate and the recording layer, the degradation of the substrate of resin by the action of the solvent used in the deposition of the recording layer to the substrate is notably abated and, consequently, the S/N ratio of the read signal is conspicuously improved.
      <br/>
      The gradual decline of the reflectance by aging during prolonged preservation of the optical recording medium is curbed by this underlying layer.
    </p>
    <p num="369">Now, the present invention will be described more specifically below with reference to working examples.</p>
    <p num="370">EXAMPLE 1</p>
    <p num="371">
      One part by weight of the dye, No. D10, mentioned above was dissolved in 80 parts by weight of cyclohexanone-dichloroethane (1:1).
      <br/>
      The resultant solution was applied in a thickness of 0.4  MU m to a disc substrate of poly (methyl methacrylate)prepared by casting 15 cm in diameter to obtain a medium of this invention.
    </p>
    <p num="372">Separately, a comparative medium was prepared by repeating the procedure, except a dye A indicated below was used instead.</p>
    <p num="373">A  (Chemical Structure image '87' not included in text)</p>
    <p num="374">
      The two media thus prepared were rotated at a rate of 1800 rpm.
      <br/>
      On each of the media thus kept in rotation, a recording beam of AlGaAs-GaAs laser diode (830 nm) was projected in a concentrated spot 1  MU m in diameter (output at the concentrated spot 10 mW) to irradiate the recording layer at a fixed frequency in the pattern of a train of pulses.
    </p>
    <p num="375">
      The two media were irradiated with the writing beam whose pulse width was gradually changed, to determine the particular pulse width at which the quenching ratio 2.5 is obtained.
      <br/>
      The reciprocal of this particular pulse width was reported as the writing sensitivity.
      <br/>
      The results were as shown in Table 7.
    </p>
    <p num="376">In this case, the quenching ratio represented the degree of attenuation, in the pits, of the reflectance of the reading beam on the surface of the medium which will be described afterward.</p>
    <p num="377">Separately, reading of information was carried out with the pulse width fixed at 100 n.sec.</p>
    <p num="378">Thereafter, a reading beam of laser diode of 1 mW (830 nm) was projected in the pattern of pulses of 3 KHz having a width of 1  MU .sec., to measure the peak-to-peak S/N ratio on the disc surface in the initial stage of the projection and five minutes after the start of the projection.</p>
    <p num="379">The results were as shown in Table 7.</p>
    <p num="380">EXAMPLE 2</p>
    <p num="381">In a mixed solvent consisting of 1 part of dichloroethane and 1 part of cyclohexanone, the aforementioned dye, No. D10, and nitrocellulose having a nitrogen content in the range of 11.5 to 12.2% and viscosity of 20 seconds as measured in accordance with the method of JIS K6703 were dissolved in a weight ratio of 3:1.</p>
    <p num="382">
      The resultant solution was spread in a thickness of 0.5  MU m on a disc substrate of poly(methyl methacrylate), prepared by casting 15 cm in diameter to afford a medium of the present invention.
      <br/>
      This medium was subjected to the same measurement as in Example 1.
