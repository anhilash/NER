    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">
      1.
      <br/>
      Field of the Invention
    </p>
    <p num="3">
      The present invention relates to a method for adjusting the overall luminosity of a bistable matrix screen displaying half-tones.
      <br/>
      It also relates to a display device that uses the method.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      The invention can be applied to screens of the type having an internal memory.
      <br/>
      A screen with an internal memory is a screen whose cells, which form the pixels, preserve the "written" state or the "extinguished" state after the end of the signal activating the "written" state or the "extinguished" state as is the case notably with plasma panels and especially with alternating type plasma panels.
    </p>
    <p num="5">The screens to which the invention applies comprise elementary cells arranged in rows and columns in matrix form.</p>
    <p num="6">
      The use of display screens in a very wide variety of luminous environments may lead to the adjusting of their overall luminance as a function of the ambient luminosity in which they are used.
      <br/>
      In fact, it is recommended that the overall luminance of the screen should be comparable to that of the environment, otherwise unnecessary fatigue will be created for the user.
      <br/>
      The conditions of illumination around the screen may vary by a factor of about 1000 (from some tens of lux indoors with attenuated illumination to some tens of thousands of lux outdoors in sunlight).
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      The description shall be made in the case of a alternating type of plasma display panel.
      <br/>
      However, the invention can be applied to other types of bistable display panels, for example liquid-crystal display screens.
    </p>
    <p num="8">2. Description of the Prior Art</p>
    <p num="9">
      The working and structure of alternating-type plasma panels is well known.
      <br/>
      These panels, are for example, of the crossed-electrode type defining a cell as described in the French patent FR-2 417 848.
      <br/>
      The addressing of a given cell is achieved by the selection of two crossed electrodes to which appropriate voltages are applied at a given instant so that the difference in potential prompts a writing discharge or an erasure discharge between these electrodes.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      A standard method of addressing consists of a row-by-row operation.
      <br/>
      In this case, all the cells of a given row simultaneously receive a command, by means of a semi-selective operation, for them to be erased or written on, for example to be erased, and this operation is followed by a selective operation during which at least one of the cells of the row is written on.
    </p>
    <p num="11">The semi-selective operation followed by the selective operation is accomplished, for each row, with a time lag from one row to the other corresponding to the duration of a row cycle.</p>
    <p num="12">Generally, the addressing by semi-selective operation and selective operation is done by a method in which addressing square-wave signals are overlaid on basic square-wave signals as explained, for example, in the patents FR-2 635 901 and FR-2 635 902.</p>
    <p num="13">These basic square-wave signals are applied simultaneously to all the cells for a period constituting an addressing stage and the addressing square-wave signals are overlaid on these basic square-wave signals only for the rows of cells addressed with, from one row to the other, the time lag corresponding to the duration of a row cycle T1; this means that the starting points of two consecutive addressing stages are separated by the duration of the row cycle.</p>
    <p num="14">
      Generally, in each row cycle, the addressing stage is followed by a sustaining stage during which the cells in the written state are activated, i.e. they produce light.
      <br/>
      Indeed, in this sustaining stage, sustaining signals are applied simultaneously to all the cells and prompt sustaining discharges that provide the essential part of the light emission perceived by an observer.
    </p>
    <p num="15">
      The sustaining signal is an alternating signal formed by voltage square waves that succeed one another with opposite polarities: each change in sign of the alternating signal (leading edges or trailing edges) generates a discharge in the gas or an emission of light in the cell or cells concerned.
      <br/>
      Thus, the quantity of light emitted by a cell in the illuminated state, namely the written state, is substantially proportional to the number of edges corresponding to polarity changes and, consequently, to the frequency of the sustaining signal.
    </p>
    <p num="16">
      It must be noted that in the addressing stage, as regards both recording and erasure, the basic square-wave signals have substantially one and the same amplitude as the sustaining signals and, consequently, they too may generate discharges comparable to the sustaining discharges, with light emission.
      <br/>
      Consequently, it may be assumed that the addressing stages contain at least one sustaining cycle.
    </p>
    <p num="17">
      To adjust the overall luminosity of an alternating type plasma panel, there is a known way of causing variation in the frequency of the sustaining signals.
      <br/>
      By making this frequency adjustable, the overall luminance of the panel is adjusted.
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      There is also a known way, described in the patent FR-2 662 292, of separating the selective (recording) operation from the semi-selective operation by an adjustable period that is substantially equal to a fraction of an image frame period, this fraction representing a percentage of the maximum luminosity.
      <br/>
      It may be recalled that the image frame period corresponds to the time needed to display an image.
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      It is increasingly being sought to display images in half-tones.
      <br/>
      In this type of display panel, each cell has several levels of illumination.
      <br/>
      The French patent FR-2 536 565 has proposed the processing, of all the rows of the panel several times and non-periodically in order to have several illumination periods for each cell.
    </p>
    <p num="20">This method uses several scans that are interleaved.</p>
    <p num="21">This method cannot be used to adopt the method for adjusting the overall luminosity which consists in separating the selective recording operation from the semi-selective operation since it is already necessary to distribute several commands for the recording and erasure of a row during a frame period.</p>
    <p num="22">Furthermore, it is difficult to adapt the method for adjusting the overall luminosity by variation of the sustaining frequency to the systems of half-tone displays using the above method since the processing rates of each row are imposed.</p>
    <p num="23">Up to now, no half-tone display method has been proposed enabling an adjustment of the overall luminosity.</p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="24">The present invention proposes a method for adjusting the overall luminosity of at least a part of a half-tone display screen.</p>
    <p num="25">The method according to the invention consists in processing each row of the part of screen several times, non-periodically, in a semi-selective operation followed by a selective operation, a delay being planned between the selective operation and the semi-selective operation, said delay being proportional to a weighting factor k(o&lt;k&lt;1) adjustable as a function of the desired overall luminosity and proportional to the time interval between the start of the processing operation in progress and the start of the next processing operation.</p>
    <p num="26">This method is simple to implement and makes it possible to obtain a dynamic range of adjustment for a constant number of half-tones wherein the greater the number of rows, the greater is this dynamic range of adjustment.</p>
    <p num="27">The present invention also relates to a display device to which the method for the adjusting of overall luminosity can be applied.</p>

    </p>
    <heading>MORE DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
    <p num="29">
      FIG. 1 is a graph giving a view, in time, of the instants of processing of a row 1 of a bistable screen by the known method of half-tone generation without adjustment of luminosity.
      <br/>
      Each row is processed N times to display an image.
      <br/>
      In the non-restrictive example shown, N=4.
    </p>
    <p num="30">Tb represents the time taken to process all the rows of the screen once.</p>
    <p num="31">The time needed to display an image or the frame time is therefore T=N.Tb.</p>
    <p num="32">The row 1 is processed at the successive instants 0, a, b, c, 1, 1+a, 1+b, 1+c, 2 . . . with 0&lt;a&lt;1, 0&lt;b&lt;1, 0&lt;c&lt;1 and a&lt;b&lt;c</p>
    <p num="33">The processing operations applied at the instants 0, a, b, c, are designed to keep or modify the written or extinguished state of the cells of the row 1.</p>
    <p num="34">
      N scans per image make it possible to obtain 2N different tone levels (generally grey levels) for each cell if the instants a, b, c, etc. are judiciously chosen.
      <br/>
      It is possible, for example, to choose them so as to obtain a geometric progression.
      <br/>
      We then have:
      <br/>
      a-0=20 /2N -1
    </p>
    <p num="35">
      b-a=21 /2N -1
      <br/>
      c-b=22 /2N -1
      <br/>
      1-c=23 /2N -1
    </p>
    <p num="36">
      In other words, the time intervals between two successive processing operations for the same row increase proportionally by the power of two.
      <br/>
      In the graph of FIG. 1, the following values have been chosen:
      <br/>
      a=1/2N -1=1/15
      <br/>
      b=3/2N -1=3/15
      <br/>
      c=7/2N -1=7/15
      <br/>
      1=15/2N -1=15/15
    </p>
    <p num="37">
      The table of FIG. 2 gives a view, for a cell controlled by the known half-tone display method, of the possible tone levels, the state of the cell at the instants 0, a, b, c and its period of illumination or luminance.
      <br/>
      The first column shows the tone level encoded in binary mode.
      <br/>
      The first bit is the least significant bit and the last bit is the most significant bit.
      <br/>
      The next column shows the commands to be applied to the cell at the instants 0, a, b, c. At the instant 0, the first bit is used.
      <br/>
      At the instant a, the second bit is used, at the instant b the third bit is used and at the instant c the last bit is used.
      <br/>
      If the bit equals 0, the cell is erased E and if the bit equals 1, the cell is illuminated A. The last column gives the period of illumination of the cell as a function of the frame time T=NTb for each tone level.
      <br/>
      The illumination times may thus take 16 different values ranging from 0 to NTb.
    </p>
    <p num="38">
      Let us take the example of a conventional plasma panel screen comprising 480 rows of cells processed 50 times per second with a frame time of 20 ms.
      <br/>
      If it is desired to display an image with four half-tones on this screen, all the rows of the screen need to be processed twice in 20 ms.
    </p>
    <p num="39">The row cycle is equal to: Tl=20/(480.2)=20.8  MU s.</p>
    <p num="40">
      This period Tl is just enough to carry out an addressing phase.
      <br/>
      No sustaining phase is added.
      <br/>
      This period corresponds to the time taken to carry out a semi-selective operation followed by a selective operation.
    </p>
    <p num="41">
      In this method, the scans are interleaved.
      <br/>
      FIG. 3 shows the succession of scans and the rows processed with the method.
      <br/>
      Four interleaved scans are performed.
      <br/>
      They are referenced B1, B2, B3, B4.
      <br/>
      The time taken to process a row is Tl.
    </p>
    <p num="42">
      The period Tl of the first scan B1 which processes an n-order row in of the screen is followed by another period Tl of the second scan B2 which processes a p (p not equal to n) order row lp, then another period Tl of the scan B3 which processes a q-order row lq and then again, during another period Tl, the scan B4 which processes an r-order row lr.
      <br/>
      The operation is then resumed with the scan B1 which processes the row ln+1, then the scan B2 which processes the row lp+1, etc.
      <br/>
      The image is displayed when all the rows have been processed once by each scan.
      <br/>
      Thus, each scan processes the panel row by row in an ordered way.
      <br/>
      Each row 1 will have been scanned four times by the scans B1, B2, B3, B4 at successive instants corresponding to the graph of FIG. 1.
    </p>
    <p num="43">
      FIG. 4 shows an exemplary view of the operations for scanning a screen of a plasma panel having eight rows, on which it is desired to display eight half-tones by the known method.
      <br/>
      The choice of the same number of rows and half-tones is but a coincidence.
      <br/>
      Three interleaved scans are made.
      <br/>
      The time axis is divided into 24 periods corresponding to 24 row cycles Tl numbered 1 to 24.
      <br/>
      Each processing of a row comprises a semi-selective operation E (erasure for example) followed by a selective operation l (recording for example).
      <br/>
      The two operations take place for one and the same row during the same row cycle Tl.
    </p>
    <p num="44">
      This figure does not show the basic square-wave signals which are applied simultaneously to all the cells but only the addressing square-wave signals which correspond to the semi-selective and selective operations.
      <br/>
      It can be ascertained that, for one and the same row, the time intervals between two successive processing operations increase in geometric progression.
      <br/>
      For the first row for example, the interval between the first two processing operations corresponds to one-seventh of the frame time T. The next interval is 2T/7 and the interval that follows is 4T/7.
    </p>
    <p num="45">
      FIG. 5 shows the distribution in time of the operations for processing a row with the method according to the method, this method enabling the adjusting of the overall luminosity in the case of a half-tone display.
      <br/>
      According to the invention, for a row each processing operation comprises a semi-selective operation followed by a selective operation.
      <br/>
      For at least one given processing operation, the selective operation is separated from the semi-selective operation by a time interval that is weighted with respect to the time interval between the beginning of this processing operation and the beginning of the next processing operation.
    </p>
    <p num="46">It has been assumed in FIG. 5 that for the row considered the semi-selective operations always take place at the instants 0, a, b, c, 1, 1+a, 1+b, 1+c, etc.</p>
    <p num="47">
      The selective operations then take place respectively at the instants:
      <br/>
      0'=k(a-0)
      <br/>
      a'=k(b-a)
      <br/>
      b'=k(c-b)
    </p>
    <p num="48">c'=k(1-c)</p>
    <p num="49">
      Where k is a constant ranging from 0 to 1, used as a weighting parameter to adjust the overall luminosity of the screen of the panel.
      <br/>
      The value of k, in this example, determines the time intervals during which the cells are forced into the extinguished state.
    </p>
    <p num="50">
      The delay between the selective operation and the semi-selective operation is proportional to this parameter k and to the time interval between the beginning of the semi-selective operation of the processing operation in progress and the beginning of the semi-selective operation of the next processing operation.
      <br/>
      The different values of the delay therefore increase in a geometrical progression as the intervals between the beginning of the different processing operations.
    </p>
    <p num="51">
      FIG. 6 assembles, in one table and for each tone level (16 possibilities), the state of a cell at the instants 0', a', b', c' and the period of illumination or luminance of the cell, this cell being controlled by the method according to the invention.
      <br/>
      It can be verified that the progression of the periods of illumination is kept.
      <br/>
      The overall luminosity of the screen of the panel is modified in a ratio of 1-k.
    </p>
    <p num="52">
      FIG. 7 resumes the example of an eight-row screen displaying eight half-tones to which there is applied a method for the adjusting of the overall luminosity according to the invention.
      <br/>
      Interleaved scans are used to address the cells of the screen.
    </p>

      However, in this case to obtain 2N half-tones, there are N scans needed, each scan being formed by two sub-scans.
      <br/>
      N sub-scans B1, B2, B3, . . . , BN of a first group carry out semi-selective operations and N sub-scans B'1, B'2, B'3, . . . , B'N of a second group carry out selective operations.
      <br/>
      There is a decorrelation between the sub-scans that generate the erasure and the sub-scans that generate the recording.

      It is assumed that a row cycle corresponds to the time taken to carry out a semi-selective operation followed by a selective operation.

    <p num="54">FIG. 9 shows a view, in time, of the succession of sub-scans that process the rows of the screen with the method according to the invention.</p>
    <p num="55">
      During the first half of the first row cycle Tl, the first sub-scan B1 of the first group achieves a semi-selective operation on the n-order row ln.

      <br/>
      The succession of the sub-scans is carried out in this way until the last sub-scan B'N of the second group which carries out a selective operation on the s-order row ls.
      <br/>
      Then, during the first half of the following row cycle, the first sub-scan B1 of the first group achieves a semi-selective operation on the n+1 order row ln+1.

      The image is displayed when each sub-scan has processed all the rows at least once.

      In the example shown in FIG. 7, during the first half of the first row cycle Tl, the row 11 is erased by the sub-scan B1 and during the second half of the first row cycle Tl the row 17 is written on by the sub-scan B'1.
      <br/>
      During the next cycle Tl, the row 18 is erased by the sub-scan B2 and then the row 11 undergoes recording by the sub-scan B'2.

      During the next cycle Tl, the sub-scan B1 erases the row 12 and then the sub-scan B'1 achieves a recording on the row 18.

      During each row cycle, a row is addressed semi-selectively and then another row is addressed selectively.

      In the above description, it has been assumed that the method according to the invention is applicable to all the rows of the screen.

      It is of course possible to apply it only to a part of the screen, for example to a half-screen.

      Only the rows of this part will be processed by the method that has been described.

      FIG. 8 gives a schematic view, by way of a non-restrictive example, of an alternating plasma panel 1 to which the method according to the invention can be applied.
      <br/>
      This panel 1 has column electrodes X1 to X8 orthogonal to the row electrodes Y1 to Y8.
      <br/>
      Each intersection between a column electrode and a row electrode defines a cell C which represents a pixel.
      <br/>
      The panel 1 has eight rows (L1 to L8) and eight columns (C1 to C8) giving 64 cells C. There could be many more or far fewer cells C. The row electrodes Y1 to Y8 are connected to an addressing device 2.
      <br/>
      This device superimposes addressing square-wave signals on a sustaining signal made in the form of basic square-waves that are always present on all the rows, for the semi-selective erasure command or for the selective recording command applied to the addressed row or rows.
    </p>
    <p num="68">The column electrodes X1 to X8 are also connected to an addressing device 3 which makes a selective application, during the recording command, of masking pulses solely to the columns which correspond to the cells C that do not have to be subjected to writing.</p>
    <p num="69">The synchronization between the signals applied to the row electrodes Y1 to Y8 and to the column electrodes X1 to X8 is symbolized in the figure by a control and synchronization device 4 which is connected to the two addressing devices 2 and 3.</p>
    <p num="70">The control and synchronization device 4 receives firstly the number of the row to be erased from a generator 5 of the sequencing of the semi-selective operations (erasure) and secondly the number of the row to be written on from a generator 6 of the sequencing of the selective operations (recordings).</p>
    <p num="71">
      These two sequencing generators may be formed by read-only memories as shown in FIG. 8.
      <br/>
      At least one sequencing is memorized in the sequencing generators.
      <br/>
      For example, a single sequencing may be memorized in the generator 5 for the sequencing of the erasures and several different sequencing operations may be memorized in the generator 6 of the sequencing of the recordings, each sequencing corresponding to a different level of overall luminosity.
      <br/>
      It is enough to choose the desired level of luminosity by means of a luminosity control device 7 placed at the disposal of the user.
      <br/>
      This control device may be a selector switch or any other equivalent system.
      <br/>
      It is connected to the generator of the sequencing of the recordings 6.
      <br/>
      This control device makes a selection, in the read-only memory of the generator 6, of the zone in which the sequencing of the rows to be written on is stored in order to obtain the desired level of luminosity.
      <br/>
      It is of course possible, conversely, to provide for only one sequencing memorized in the generator 6 of the sequencing of the recordings and several sequencings memorized in the generator 5 of the sequencing of the erasures.
      <br/>
      The luminosity control device 7 would then be connected to the generator of the sequencing of the erasures.
    </p>
    <p num="72">
      In all the examples described, it has been assumed that the semi-selective operation corresponds to an erasure and that the selective operation corresponds to a recording.
      <br/>
      It has thus been possible to adjust the luminosity of the written information on the display panel by adjusting the weighting parameter k. It would of course be possible for the semi-selective operation to correspond to a recording and the selective operation to an erasure.
      <br/>
      Thus, the luminosity of the background of the display panel screen would be adjusted by adjusting the weighting parameter k.
    </p>
    <p num="73">
      The examples described relate to alternating type plasma panels.
      <br/>
      The method according to the invention can also be applied notably to liquid crystal panels or certain electroluminescent panels.
      <br/>
      Liquid crystal panels do not themselves produce light but work in transmission and modulate the light of a source before which they are placed.
      <br/>
      By applying the method according to the invention to these panels, the transmission time of the light is adjusted in order to adjust the overall luminosity.
