    <heading>TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
    <p num="1">The present invention relates generally to fuel tanks for vehicles and, more particularly, to a serviceable sealed fuel tank for a vehicle.</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">
      It is known to provide a fuel tank such as a plastic fuel tank in a vehicle to hold fuel to be used by an engine of the vehicle.
      <br/>
      Typically, the fuel tank has a shell with a tank opening and a unit installed into the tank via the tank opening.
      <br/>
      The fuel tank also has a cover to close the tank opening.
    </p>
    <p num="3">
      It is desirable to form a serviceable sealed fuel tank for a vehicle that is formed using a thermoforming process and eliminating a tank opening for the fuel tank.
      <br/>
      It is also desirable to provide a sealed fuel tank that allows a fuel tank opening to be eliminated.
      <br/>
      It is further desirable to provide a sealed fuel tank that reduces cost and labor required to assemble a cover to the fuel tank.
      <br/>
      It is further desirable to provide a sealing cover for a fuel tank, which can be attached to the fuel tank at the time of service.
    </p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="4">It is, therefore, one object of the present invention to provide a serviceable sealed fuel tank for a vehicle.</p>
    <p num="5">It is another object of the present invention to provide a sealed fuel tank with a sealed service port that can be opened to allow servicing of internal components.</p>
    <p num="6">It is yet another object of the present invention to provide a sealing cover that can be attached to a fuel tank at the time of service.</p>
    <p num="7">
      To achieve the foregoing objects, the present invention is a serviceable sealed fuel tank including a tank shell having a first half shell and a second half shell connected to the first half shell.
      <br/>
      The serviceable sealed fuel tank also includes at least one internal component disposed inside the tank shell between the first half shell and the second half shell.
      <br/>
      The serviceable sealed fuel tank further includes an inspection tower extending outwardly from the second half shell and being sealed.
      <br/>
      A portion of the inspection tower is removed to allow access to the at least one component after the first half shell and the second half shell are connected together.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      One advantage of the present invention is that a new serviceable sealed fuel tank is provided for a vehicle.
      <br/>
      Another advantage of the present invention is that the serviceable sealed fuel tank has two halves joined by a thermoforming process and allows for internal components to be disposed and assembled into the fuel tank before the two halves are joined.
      <br/>
      Yet another advantage of the present invention is that the serviceable sealed fuel tank allows a sealed service port to be molded into the fuel tank, which can then be opened by service technicians if servicing of the internal components becomes necessary.
      <br/>
      Still another advantage of the present invention is that the serviceable sealed fuel tank can be manufactured without a component installation tank opening or cover, which saves money and labor and improves tank reliability from a leakage/vapor emissions standpoint.
      <br/>
      A further advantage of the present invention is that the serviceable sealed fuel tank allows a sealing cover to be created which can be attached to the fuel tank at the time of service.
      <br/>
      Yet a further advantage of the present invention is that the serviceable sealed fuel tank has less components, less labor, less cost and a more robust fuel tank with components sealed within the fuel tank during assembly and an inspection tower opened only if the fuel tank requires service.
      <br/>
      Still a further advantage of the present invention is that the serviceable sealed fuel tank eliminates tank openings, improves tank assembly reliability, and reduces scrap by eliminating a leak path for fuel or fuel vapors.
      <br/>
      Another advantage of the present invention is that the serviceable sealed fuel tank reduces cost of fuel tank assembly by eliminating labor required to assemble a cover to the fuel tank and by making any cover as an after-market service item.

      The cover plate 172 is generally circular in shape and made of a rigid material.
      <br/>
      The vapor cover 158 may include an annular groove 174 extending into the base wall 160 adjacent the opening 170 and a seal 176 disposed in the groove 174.
      <br/>
      The seal 176 is similar to the seal 166.
      <br/>
      In this embodiment, the threads 164 are self-tapping threads that are threaded onto the smooth outer surface of the side wall 48 of the tower 46.
      <br/>
      The cover 58 is installed one time and remains in place.
