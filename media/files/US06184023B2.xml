      Field of the Invention
    </p>
    <p num="3">The present invention relates to a purified chondroitinase ABC and a crystallized chondroitinase ABC having an extremely high purity and excellent stability, a process for the preparation of the chondroitinase ABC and the chondroitinase ABC crystal, and a pharmaceutical composition comprising chondroitinase as an effective component.</p>
    <p num="4">2. Description of the Background Art</p>
    <p num="5">
      Chondroitinase ABC �EC 4.2.2.4� is an enzyme degrading hyaluronic acid, chondroitin sulfate, chondroitin, dermatan sulfate, or the like into a mixture of an unsaturated disaccharide and oligosaccharide.
      <br/>
      The enzyme is known to be produced by bacteria such as Proteus vulgaris.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      For the preparation of chondroitinase ABC, a process which comprises subjecting a disrupted bacterial cell suspension progressively to a streptomycin treatment, an ammonium sulfate fractionation, a DEAE cellulose chromatography, and a phosphocellulose chromatography (J.
      <br/>
      Biol. Chem., 243, (7), 1523-1535 (1968)), and a process which comprises loading a disrupted bacterial cell suspension progressively to a DEAE cellulose chromatography, a hydroxyapatite chromatography, a zinc-immobilized agarose chromatography, and a gel permeation chromatography (Agric. Biol. Chem., 50, (4), 1057-1059 (1986); Japanese Patent Laid-open (kokai) No. 122588/1987), and the like are known.

      On the other hand, the intervertebral disc dissolution method (Intradiscal therapy: chemonucleolysis) was developed for curing disc herniation which is identified as a cause of human lumber pain.
      <br/>
      In this method, chymopapain which is a protease derived from papaya or a collagenase derived from bacteria is injected into the intervertebral disc antrum to remove the swelling capacity of the disc.
      <br/>
      Chymopapain is thus commercially sold in Europe and the United States as a drug under the trademark of Chymodiactin (Smith Laboratories) or Discase (Travenol).
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      However, the intradiscal therapy using said protease degrades not only the herniated disc, but also proteins in the surrounding tissues.
      <br/>
      This can be a cause of side effects such as neuroparalysis, allergy, and the like.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      Mark R. Brown studied enzymes which can act on herniated disc with specificity and directed his attention to the degradation of proteoglycan which is a major herniated disc constituent.
      <br/>
      His study resulted in the intradiscal therapy using chondroitinase ABC or chondroitinase AC (U.S. Pat. No. 4,696,816).
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      In particular, the chondroitinase ABC produced by Proteus vulgaris is considered to be appropriate to medical and commercial applications because of its capability of selectively removing side chain of chondroitin sulfate or dermatan sulfate from proteoglycan, its inactivity toward keratan sulfate, heparin, and heparan sulfate, and its abundant productivity.
      <br/>
      Because of this, enzyme preparations having the chondroitinase ABC activity are prepared from culture products of Proteus vulgaris by aforementioned processes.
      <br/>
      These enzyme preparations, however, are not suitable for use as a drug for curing disc herniation or as a high-purity reagent, because they have protease activity or endotoxin activity and contain nucleic acid.
      <br/>
      They are unstable as enzyme proteins (J.

    </p>
    <p num="11">Especially, the presence of impurities and instability are afraid to cause serious problems when the chondroitinase ABC is used as a drug.</p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="12">The subject of the present invention is therefore to provide a novel, high-purity chondroitinase ABC and crystallized chondroitinase ABC not containing impurities, having a high specific activity and excellent stability, and useful as a drug, and a process for preparing the chondroitinase ABC and crystallized chondroitinase ABC at a high yield.</p>
    <p num="13">Another subject of the present invention is to provide a pharmaceutical composition comprising chondroitinase as an effective component.</p>
    <p num="14">In order to resolve these subject, the present inventors have undertaken studies on the purification of chondroitinase ABC and found that a process comprising extracting the enzyme from cells of a microorganism, removing nucleic acid from the enzyme-containing extract, and treating the extract by chromatography in which a weak cation exchange resin and a strong cation exchange resin are combined produces a purified chondroitinase ABC from which impurities such as endotoxin, nucleic acid, protease, and the like have been completely removed and which shows a single band in SDS-PAGE and a single peak in HPLC (GPC: gel permeation chromatography,cation exchange).</p>
    <p num="15">
      The chondroitinase ABC thus obtained was found to be crystallized into a chondroitinase ABC crystal which has a specific activity three times higher than that of chondroitinase ABC preparations obtained by a conventional method, maintains its activity during a long-term storage, and is highly useful as a drug.
      <br/>
      These findings have led to the completion of the present invention.
    </p>
    <p num="16">Accordingly, an object of the present invention is to provide a chondroitinase ABC with a high purity and high stability, of which the characteristics are discussed hereinafter.</p>
    <p num="17">Another object of the present invention is to provide a process for preparing the chondroitinase ABC with a high purity and high stability which comprises,</p>
    <p num="18">
      (i) a step of obtaining an enzyme-containing extract from cells of microorganism producing chondroitinase ABC (step 1),
      <br/>
      (ii) a step of removing nucleic acid from the enzyme-containing extract (step 2), and
      <br/>
      (iii) a step of chromatographic treatment, which comprises,
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      - (a) absorbing the chondroitinase ABC by a chromatographic treatment of said enzyme-containing extract using a weak cation exchange resin, eluting the absorbed enzyme, absorbing the enzyme in the eluate, and eluting the absorbed enzyme by chromatography using a strong cation exchange resin (step 3-1), or
      <br/>
      - (b) absorbing the chondroitinase ABC by a chromatographic treatment of said enzyme-containing extract using a strong cation exchange resin, eluting the absorbed enzyme, absorbing the enzyme in the eluate, and eluting the absorbed enzyme by chromatography using a weak cation exchange resin (step 3-2).
    </p>
    <p num="20">In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, said extract of chondroitinase ABC is obtained by a method comprising adding a buffer solution with a pH in the neighborhood of neutral to wet cells to produce a cell suspension and subjecting the suspension to a physical treatment to pulverize the cells; or by a method comprising adding a surfactant solution with a pH in the neighborhood of neutral to wet cells to produce a cell suspension and stirring the suspension.</p>
    <p num="21">Said two-step chromatography by the combination of weak and strong cation exchange resins after removal of nucleic acid from the cell extract containing chondroitinase ABC produces a high-purity chondroitinase ABC which is purer and more stable than conventional chondroitinase ABC preparations and having a specific activity more than three times higher than that of chondroitinase ABC preparations obtained by a conventional method.</p>
    <p num="22">A still another object of the present invention is to provide a crystallized chondroitinase ABC having a needle-like or prismatic shape and the characteristics of said purified chondroitinase ABC, which is prepared by crystallizing said purified chondroitinase ABC in a polyether having hydroxyl groups at both ends (e.g., polyethylene glycol, polypropylene glycol).</p>
    <p num="23">Such a chondroitinase ABC crystal is highly homogeneous, has a stable quality and high specific activity, and exhibits excellent storage stability (e.g., its activity hardly decreases when allowed to stand for one month at about 25 to 40 (degree)  C.).</p>
    <p num="24">A further object of the present invention is to provide compositions containing a chondroitinase.</p>
    <p num="25">Specifically, the present invention provides a composition comprising a chondroitinase and serum albumin or gelatin.</p>
    <p num="26">The present invention further provides a composition comprising a chondroitinase and a nonionic surfactant.</p>
    <p num="27">A still further object of the present invention is to provide a pharmaceutical composition for curing intervertebral disc displacement comprising a chondroitinase.</p>
    <p num="28">Not only the above-mentioned purified chondroitinase ABC, but also conventionally known chondroitinase ABC or chondroitinase AC can be used for these compositions.</p>
    <p num="29">Such compositions provide a solution which prevents absorption of chondroitinase to the wall of containers, and further prevents insoluble matters from being produced by mechanical stress, thus maintaining a high activity and useful as a drug.</p>
    <p num="30">Other and further objects, features and advantages of the present invention will appear more fully from the following description.</p>

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION AND PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
    <p num="32">Processes for preparing the purified chondroitinase ABC and the chondroitinase ABC crystal of the present invention are illustrated in detail.</p>
    <p num="33">
      Any cells of microorganisms conventionally known to produce chondroitinase ABC, for example microorganisms belonging to Proteus vulgaris or the like, can be used for the production of the chondroitinase ABC of the present invention.
      <br/>
      A specific example of such a microorganism is Proteus vulgaris NCTC 4636 (ATCC 6896, IFO 3988).
    </p>
    <p num="34">
      The microorganisms can be cultured by a conventional method (e.g., J. Biol. Chem., 243, (7), 1523-1535 (1968); Japanese Patent Laid-open (kokai) Nos. 122588/1987 or 57180/1990).
      <br/>
      Wet cells are collected from the culture and suspended into a buffer solution with a pH in the neighborhood of neutral to extract enzyme from the suspension.
      <br/>
      A phosphate buffer solution, Tris-HCl buffer solution, acetate buffer solution, or the like with a pH of 6.0 to 8.0 and a concentration of 1 to 100 mM is normally used as the buffer solution with a pH in the neighborhood of neutral.
      <br/>
      Cells are pulverized by a bead mill procedure (using DYNO.RTM.MILL or others) to extract an enzyme solution containing chondroitinase ABC, protease, other enzymes, nucleic acid, proteins, and the like.
    </p>
    <p num="35">The efficiency of the extraction of chondroitinase ABC from cells can be promoted even more by using a surfactant solution, used as a buffer solution to which a surfactant is added.</p>
    <p num="36">
      Any surfactants which can promote the enzyme-containing extraction efficiency can be used in the present invention.
      <br/>
      Nonionic surfactants are preferred as the surfactants.
    </p>
    <p num="37">
      Nonionic surfactants which can be used include polyoxyethylene alkyl ethers, polyoxyethylene p-t-octylphenyl ethers, polysorbate, and the like.
      <br/>
      Emulgen-type surfactants, Liponox-type surfactants, Brij-type surfactants, and the like are given as specific examples of polyoxyethylene alkyl ethers.
      <br/>
      Commercially available surfactants among these are Emulgen 120, Emulgen 109P, Liponox DCH, Brij 35, 78, 76, 96, 56, 58, 98, Nikkol BL-9EX, BL-21, BL-25, and the like.
      <br/>
      Given as specific examples of polyoxyethylene p-t-octylphenyl ethers are Triton-type surfactants, Nonidet-P40-type surfactants, Igepal/CA-type surfactants, Polytergent G, Neutronyx-type surfactants, Conco-type surfactants, and the like.
      <br/>
      Among these types of surfactants, Triton X-100, X-45, X-114, X-102, X-165, X-305, X-405, Nonidet P-40, Igepal CA-630, Neutronyx 605, Conco NIX-100, and the like are commercially available.
      <br/>
      Tween-type surfactants, Emasol-type surfactants, Sorbester-type surfactants, Crill-type surfactants, and the like are given as specific examples of polysorbates.
      <br/>
      Sorbitan mono-9-octadecanoate poly(oxy-1,2-ethanediyl) derivatives, commercially available as Tween 80, are preferred as polysorbate.
      <br/>
      Other examples of commercially available polysorbates are Tween 20, 40, 60, Emasol 4115, 4130, and the like.
    </p>
    <p num="38">
      Of the above surfactants, especially preferred are polyoxyethylene alkyl ether (e.g., polyoxyethylene lauryl ether, polidocanal; hereinafter referred to as "POELE"), and the like.
      <br/>
      The use of these surfactants not only promotes the enzyme-containing extraction efficiency, but also produces an enzyme-containing extract containing a chondroitinase ABC with less content of protease, concomitant protein and nucleic acid than other extraction method.
      <br/>
      No protease activity is detected in such a chondroitinase ABC.
      <br/>
      Its endotoxin content is so small that there is no problem to use it as a drug component.
    </p>
    <p num="39">The enzyme-containing extract thus obtained is subjected to chromatography using a weak cation exchange resin or a strong cation exchange resin, and then a chondroitinase ABC with an extremely high activity, which exhibits a single band in electrophoresis, can be produced.</p>
    <p num="40">
      For the extraction, the cultured wet cells are added to a buffer solution containing 2 to 7% of said surfactants to produce a cell suspension.
      <br/>
      The cell suspension is warmed to the temperature range of 15 to 45 (degree)  C., preferably about 37 (degree)  C., stirred for about 1 to 10 hours, preferably about 2 to 6 hours, and cooled to room temperature, to separate an extract from a cell residue by a separation means such as centrifuge or the like.
      <br/>
      The extract thus obtained, which contains chondroitinase ABC, as a major component, other enzymes, proteins and nucleic acid, is transferred to the purification step.
    </p>
    <p num="41">
      In the purification step, proteins, nucleic acid, and the like are removed from the cell extract solution.
      <br/>
      Any conventional methods are applicable to the removal of proteins and nucleic acid.
      <br/>
      When the use of the enzyme as a drug component is taken into account, an especially preferred method to remove nucleic acid is adding protamine sulfate.
    </p>
    <p num="42">
      The treatment using protamine is carried out by adding 3 to 7% protamine sulfate aqueous solution to the cell extract to a final concentration of about 0.25 to 1% and stirring the mixture at about from 4 (degree)  C. to room temperature for 10 to 30 minutes to produce precipitate of nucleic acid and the like.
      <br/>
      The precipitate is then separated and removed by centrifuge or the like.
    </p>
    <p num="43">The supernatant thus obtained, which contains chondroitinase ABC, protease, and other enzymes, is then chromatographically prepared by using a cation exchange resin.</p>
    <p num="44">In the preparation of the purified chondroitinase ABC, the purification is performed by the chromatography treatment using a combination of a weak cation exchange resin and a strong cation exchange resin.</p>
    <p num="45">
      A cation exchange resin having a carboxyalkyl group, e.g., carboxymethyl group, as an exchange group is exemplified as the weak cation exchange resin used here.
      <br/>
      A polysaccharide derivative (an agarose derivative, a crosslinked dextran derivative, etc.) having a carboxymethyl group as an exchange group is given as a specific example.
      <br/>
      Commercially available examples of such cation exchange resins are CM-Sepharose, CM-Sephadex, (trademarks, products of Pharmacia), and the like.
    </p>
    <p num="46">
      A cation exchange resin having a sulfoalkyl group as an exchange group is exemplified as the strong cation exchange resin used here.
      <br/>
      A polysaccharide derivative (an agarose derivative, a crosslinked dextran derivative, etc.) having a sulfoethyl group, a sulfopropyl group, or the like as an exchange group is given as a specific example.
      <br/>
      Commercially available examples of such strong cation exchange resins are S-Sepharose, S-Sepharose (trademark, products of Pharmacia), SP-Sephadex (trademark, a product of Pharmacia), SP Toyopearl (trademark, a Toso Co.), and the like.
    </p>
    <p num="47">One example of the chromatography using these two types of cation exchange resins in combination is as follows.</p>
    <p num="48">
      The first chromatography is carried out by equilibrating the weak cation exchange resin with the same buffer solution (pH 6.5 to 7.5) used in the extraction of cells (e.g., 1 to 50 mM phosphate buffer solution, Tris-HCl buffer solution, acetate buffer solution, etc.), contacting said supernatant containing the enzyme with the cation exchange resin to absorb the enzyme, and washing the cation exchange resin, optionally using a salt solution (e.g., 20 to 25 mM NaCl solution) and/or the above-mentioned surfactant solution (e.g., 0.5% POELE solution).
      <br/>
      An eluant prepared by dissolving sodium chloride into said buffer solution at a concentration of about 0.1 M is contacted with said resin to elute fractions having an activity of the enzyme.
      <br/>
      Either gradient elution or stepwise elution can be used as a method of the elution.
      <br/>
      The chromatography treatment can be carried out either by a column method or a batch method.
    </p>
    <p num="49">
      The fractions thus obtained is then contacted with a strong cation exchange resin which has been equilibrated with the same buffer solution to absorb chondroitinase ABC.
      <br/>
      After washing the cation exchange resin, optionally using a salt solution (e.g., 20 to 50 mM NaCl solution) and/or water, the chondroitinase ABC is isolated by gradient elution using the same type of buffer solution (e.g., phosphate buffer solution, Tris-HCl buffer solution, acetate buffer solution, etc.), but containing NaCl with a concentration gradient of 0 to 0.5 M, preferably about 25 to 350 mM.
      <br/>
      This chromatography treatment is preferably carried out by the column method.
    </p>
    <p num="50">It is possible to reversibly perform the above chromatography using the two types of cation exchange resins.</p>
    <p num="51">
      When cells are extracted with a buffer solution containing a surfactant, the extract contains only very little amount of impurities.
      <br/>
      The enzyme, in this case, can be purified by a simple procedure, e.g., without the treatment of removing nucleic acid from the extract such as protaminase treatment, only by passing the extract through a weak cation exchange resin (e.g., CM-Sepharose) column to absorb chondroitinase ABC, washing the column, and eluting the enzyme with a gradient method.
    </p>
    <p num="52">
      The purified enzyme solution obtained by the chromatography may be served as a drug, a reagent, or the like, as is, after concentration and desalting.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, the concentrated and desalted enzyme solution may be made into powder by a common drying method (e.g., lyophilization) under conditions which do not inactivate or denature the enzyme.
    </p>
    <p num="53">
      In addition, the above purified enzyme solution may be blended and contacted with polyether having hydroxy groups at both ends (e.g., polyethylene glycol, polypropylene glycol, etc.) to crystallize the chondroitinase ABC.
      <br/>
      The crystals are rhombic or monoclinic system needle-like crystals, exhibiting crystal parameters shown in Examples hereinafter.
    </p>
    <p num="54">
      One example of the crystallizing procedure is as follows.
      <br/>
      Polyethylene glycol with an appropriate molecular weight, such as MW of 4,000, 6,000, or he like, is added to the enzyme solution.
      <br/>
      The solution, being adjusted to the concentration of the enzyme 250 to 500 U/ml and the concentration of polyethylene glycol 5 to 20%, preferably 10 to 15%, is allowed to stand at a temperature from 4 (degree)  C. to room temperature until the crystal of the enzyme grows up.
    </p>
    <p num="55">
      Purified chondroitinase ABC thus obtained does not contain impurities such as endotoxin, nucleic acid, protease, other proteins, and the like, shows a single band in SDS-PAGE and a single peak in HPLC (GPC), and has a specific activity three times higher than that of chondroitinase ABC obtained by a conventional method.
      <br/>
      In addition, according to the process of the present invention, in which procedures such as the ammonium sulfate fractionation, the concentration/desalting, and the like are not required in the course of the production as in the conventional processes, the time for the manufacture of the chondroitinase ABC can be shortened, the yield is promoted, and the manufacturing cost can be reduced.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, the process of the present invention can be applied with these advantages regardless of the amount of the chondroitinase ABC to be prepared.
    </p>
    <p num="56">
      Chondroitinase ABC crystal produced by the crystallization method mentioned above is needle-like or prismatic in shape (see FIG. 1), homogeneous, and stable in its quality.
      <br/>
      It has also a high specific activity and excellent storage stability.

    <p num="57">The characteristics of the chondroitinase ABC obtained by the process of the present invention illustrated above are as follows.</p>
    <p num="58">(1) Actions</p>
    <p num="59">Act on hyaluronic acid, chondroitin sulfate, chondroitin, and dermatan sulfate, producing a small amount of a large molecular weight unsaturated oligosaccharide in an early stage of the reaction and, ultimately, a mixture of unsaturated disaccharide ( DELTA 4 -glucuronyl-N-acetylhexosamine and its 4- or 6-sulfate) and oligosaccharide.</p>
    <p num="60">(2) Optimum pH and Stable pH</p>
    <p num="61">
      Optimum pH is 8.0 to 8.2, when chondroitin sulfate C is a substrate in a Tris-HCl buffer solution (FIG. 2).
      <br/>
      When allowed to stand at pH 5 to 9 at 25 (degree)  C. for 24 hours, the enzyme exhibits about 80% or more of residual activity (FIG. 3).
    </p>
    <p num="62">(3) Assay of Enzyme Activity</p>
    <p num="63">
      The measurement is based on the production of unsaturated disaccharides exhibiting a remarkable absorbance of the light in the ultraviolet region by an enzymatic reaction.
      <br/>
      Specifically, the enzyme reaction is carried out in an enzyme reaction solution containing the enzyme, 1.2 mg of chondroitin sulfate C (substrate), 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer solution (pH 8 to 8.5) containing 50 mM sodium acetate, and 10  MU g of casein at 37 (degree)  C. for 20 minutes.
      <br/>
      The reaction is terminated with the addition of 0.05 M HCl (pH 1.8).
      <br/>
      The absorbance at 232 nm is then measured.
      <br/>
      Separately, a heat denatured enzyme solution, as a control, is kept in a substrate solution with the same composition as above and treated in the same manner as above to measure the absorbance at 232 nm.
      <br/>
      The amount of unsaturated disaccharides is calculated from the increase in the absorbance of the sample over the control.
      <br/>
      In the calculation, the millimole molecular extinction coefficient of 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-3-0-( BETA -D-gluco-4-en-pyranosyluronic acid)-6-0-sulfo-D-galactose was assumed to be 5.5. As a result, one unit (U) of the enzyme is defined to be an amount of the enzyme catalyzing a reaction releasing 1 micromol of unsaturated disaccharides in one minute under the above-mentioned reaction conditions.
    </p>
    <p num="64">(4) Optimum Temperature of Reaction and Temperature Stability</p>
    <p num="65">
      The optimum temperature of reaction is 37 (degree)  C., and the enzyme exhibits about 90% or more activity at 30 to 37 (degree)  C. (FIG. 4).
      <br/>
      The enzyme was stable between 2 (degree)  C. and 30 (degree)  C. and deactivated at 50 (degree)  C., when it was kept at different temperatures in a Tris-HCl buffer solution (pH 7.0) for 1 hour (FIG. 5).

      The chondroitinase ABC of the present invention was eluted as a single peak at a retention time of 18.43 minutes (FIG. 6).
      <br/>
      The molecular weight of the enzyme was determined to be about 100,000 dalton based on the comparison of the retention time and the above molecular weight markers.
    </p>
    <p num="96">
      It did not substantially contain endotoxin.
      <br/>
      The DNA and protease contents were below the detection limit, while a commercial chondroitinase ABC (Seikagaku Corporation, Catalog No. 100332) contained DNA amounting 5,000 times of the detection limit and protease 200 times.
    </p>
    <p num="97">
      In the comparison of the chondroitinase ABC of the present invention and Chondroitinase ABC protease-free (Seikagaku Corporation, Catalog No. 100332) which is known to have the highest purity among currently known chondroitinase ABCs, the former has a molecular weight of about 100,000 dalton in both the SDS-PAGE and HPLC (GPC), while the latter has a molecular weight of about 80,000 dalton in the SDS-PAGE and about 120,000 to 145,000 dalton in the gel filtration.
      <br/>
      This is a great difference between the two.
      <br/>
      In addition, while the former has a specific activity of 300 U/mg protein or more, the latter has a specific activity of about 110 U/mg protein.
      <br/>
      With respect to the storage stability, while the former is stable at room temperature for at least three months, the latter is claimed to be stable at -70 (degree)  C. for at least three months.
      <br/>
      This is also a significant difference.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, the former chondroitinase ABC exhibits a single band in SDS-PAGE and a single peak in HPLC (GPC) and can be crystallized, and thus its terminal amino acid can be determined and its isoelectric point can be measured, whereas the latter is not an enzyme which can be identified as a substance, and, therefore, it is impossible to identify its terminal amino acid and to measure an isoelectric point.

    <p num="101">
      Serum albumin of mammals, e.g., human, cattle, horse, swine, sheep, goat, etc., are given as examples.
      <br/>
      Human serum albumin (HSA) which is applicable to parenteral administrations is preferred, when the composition is used as injection preparation for human.
      <br/>
      For example, human serum albumin prepared from plasma of healthy persons as a raw material and fractionated and purified by the Cohn's ethanol fractionation method can be used.
      <br/>
      Especially preferred is serum albumin treated with heat, preferably at about 60 (degree)  C. for about 10 hours, to deactivate hepatitis virus and the like.

      <br/>
      Even though an amount exceeding 500 times by weight may bring about the effect of the present invention, the enzyme activity per unit weight is reduced in such a large amount.

      <br/>
      A liquid pharmaceutical composition of this type is adjusted to a pH region of 5 to 9, and preferably 6 to 8, by the addition of a buffer solution.

      The column was washed with the same buffer solution, then the same buffer solution but containing 0.025 M NaCl, followed by elution with the same buffer solution containing 0.1 M NaCl to obtain fractions exhibiting the enzyme activity (step 3).

    <p num="165">The above experimental results demonstrate that the addition of gelatin, HSA, or BSA to purified chondroitinase and the adjustment of pH to the neighborhood of neutral in a solution prevents adhesion of purified chondroitinase to containers, makes the solution colorless and transparent after dissolution, and maintains the enzyme without lowering its activity during storage.</p>
    <p num="166">
      These effects are especially remarkable when gelatin, HSA, or BSA is used in an amount of 0.05 to 10 times of the enzyme protein of the purified chondroitinase.
      <br/>
      In this instance, a particularly preferred chondroitinase composition is a chondroitinase ABC composition prepared by using a high-purity chondroitinase ABC having a high specific activity together with gelatin, HSA, or BSA, and dissolving them in a sodium phosphate buffer solution with pH 5 to 9, preferable 6 to 8, to make a solution (10 to 50 mM as a sodium phosphate buffer concentration), and lyophilizing it.
      <br/>
      It is desirable that the lyophilized composition provides a solution having the pH of the above range when it was dissolved.
