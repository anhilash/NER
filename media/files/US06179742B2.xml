    <heading>TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
    <p num="1">The present invention relates generally to sliding door systems for vehicles and, more particularly, to a transmission assembly for a powered sliding door system for an automotive vehicle.</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">
      It is known to provide a powered sliding door system for a vehicle such as an automotive vehicle to allow an occupant to enter and exit an occupant compartment through a door opening in a vehicle body of the automotive vehicle.
      <br/>
      The powered sliding door system typically includes a door extending longitudinally and mounted on tracks for sliding movement to open and close the door opening.
      <br/>
      The powered sliding door system includes a cable attached to the door and routed through the vehicle body via pulleys so that pulling a first end of the cable opens the door and pulling a second end of the cable closes the door.
      <br/>
      The powered sliding door system also includes an actuator assembly having first and second reels about which the ends of the cable are wrapped.
      <br/>
      The actuator assembly includes a motor that drives in one direction, rotating the first reel to open the door, and is reversible to rotate in an opposite direction, rotating the second reel to close the door.
    </p>
    <p num="3">
      The actuator assembly is typically mounted in a rear compartment of the vehicle body, which varies in depth, width and height.
      <br/>
      The actuator assembly has a motor mounted on the side that used a clutch and two relatively big gears to provide speed reduction to the actuator assembly.
      <br/>
      Further, the transmission assembly must provide ease of sliding door movement in both a power and manual mode of operation.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      Although the above powered sliding door system has worked well, it is desirable to provide a universal transmission assembly for both right-hand and left-hand sliding doors of the automotive vehicle.
      <br/>
      It is also desirable to provide multiple stages for speed reduction of the actuator assembly.
      <br/>
      Therefore, there is a need in the art to provide a transmission assembly for a sliding power door system for an automotive vehicle.
    </p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="5">It is, therefore, one object of the present invention to provide a transmission assembly for a powered sliding door system for an automotive vehicle.</p>
    <p num="6">It is another object of the present invention to provide a transmission assembly for a powered sliding door system for a vehicle, which has a smaller package size and is universal for both right-hand and left-hand sliding doors of the vehicle.</p>
    <p num="7">
      To achieve the foregoing objects, the present invention is a transmission assembly for a powered sliding door system for an automotive vehicle.
      <br/>
      The transmission assembly includes a rotatable input member, a stationary hub, and a planetary gearset disposed within the hub and operatively cooperating with the input member.
      <br/>
      The transmission assembly also includes an electromagnetic brake disposed within the hub and operatively cooperating with the planetary gearset to lock and unlock a gear of the planetary gearset.
      <br/>
      The transmission assembly further includes a rotatable output member operatively cooperating with the planetary gearset.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      One advantage of the present invention is that a transmission assembly is provided for a powered sliding door system for an automotive vehicle.
      <br/>
      Another advantage of the present invention is that the transmission assembly has a planetary gearset for a smaller package size and is universal for use with right-hand and left-hand sliding doors of the automotive vehicle.
      <br/>
      Yet another advantage of the present invention is that the transmission assembly has a planetary gearset for multiple stages of speed reduction.
    </p>
    <p num="9">Other objects, features and advantages of the present invention will be readily appreciated, as the same becomes better understood after reading the subsequent description taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.</p>
