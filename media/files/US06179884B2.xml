      Field of the Invention
    </p>
    <p num="3">The present invention relates to the improvement of electrochemical cells, such as solid electrolyte fuel cells, water vapor electrolytic cells, oxygen pumps, NOx decomposition cells or the like.</p>
    <p num="4">2. Description of the Prior Art</p>
    <p num="5">
      The solid electrolyte fuel cells, i.e. solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC) , are roughly classified into two categories: a so-called planar type, and a tubular type.
      <br/>
      In the SOFC of planar type, a stack for power generation is constructed by stacking alternately the so-called separators and generator layers.
      <br/>
      In Japanese Patent Application Kokai No. 05-054,897, generator layers comprising a fuel electrode (anode) and an air electrode (cathode), respectively, are fabricated, interconnectors are also fabricated, and then, amultilayered body is fabricated by stacking alternately the generator layers and interconnectors with interposition therebetween of a membrane comprising ceramic powder and an organic binder.
      <br/>
      The layered body is then heat-treated to bond the generator layers with the interconnectors.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      Alternatively, in Japanese Patent Application Kokai No. 06-068,885, is described that a green shaped body for an interconnector is stacked on a green shaped body for a distributor on the air-electrode side, and this stacked body is monolithically sintered to bond the interconnector with the distributor.
      <br/>
      In this method, between both the green shaped bodies is applied a material having a thermal shrinkage behavior extremely different from those of the green shaped bodies, whereby a stress relaxation layer is formed to mitigate stress between the green shaped bodies.
      <br/>
      This stress relaxation layer disintegrates into fine pieces during shrinking upon firing, whereby the stress is mitigated.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      The present inventors have studied the manufacture of electrochemical cells of such a planar type SOFC.
      <br/>
      A typical shape of the such type electric cells is shown in FIG. 7a that is a schematic cross-sectional view.
      <br/>
      In FIG. 7a, a support of this electrochemical cell is the conjoint body 41.
      <br/>
      This conjoint body 41 is a conjugated body of an air electrode (cathode) 42 with a separator 44.
      <br/>
      The air electrode 42 has a planar shape.
      <br/>
      In the separator 44, a plurality of narrow, long banks 44d and 44e are formed on a plate member 44f and grooves are formed between the banks 44d and 44e.
      <br/>
      With each top face 44c of the banks 44d and 44e, the principal face 42c of the air electrode 42 is bonded.
      <br/>
      Additionally, 44a is the bottom face of the separator.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      The side face 42b of the air electrode 42 is contiguous to the side face 44b of the separator 44 without difference in level.
      <br/>
      An oxidant gas flow passage 43 has a rectangular or square cross-sectional shape.
      <br/>
      The end portions of the oxidant gas flow passage 43 are open to the end faces of the separator 44.
      <br/>
      Additionally, 45 is a joint boundary face.
      <br/>
      Adense solid electrolyte membrane 19 is formed on the conjoint body 41.
      <br/>
      In this instance, the main portion 19a of the solid electrolyte membrane 19 is formed on the top face 42a of the air electrode 42.
      <br/>
      Both sides of the main portion 19a are extended to form extended portions 19b which cover the side faces 42b of the air electrode 42 and further the upper portions of the side faces of the separator 44.
      <br/>
      Consequently, the oxidant gas flow passages 43 are kept airtight excepting the openings thereof.
      <br/>
      A fuel electrode (anode) membrane 20 is formed on the solid electrolyte membrane 19.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      However, it has been found that the following problems are posed in the electrochemical cells of SOFC utilizing such a conjoint body.
      <br/>
      Namely, when these electrochemical cells are subjected to repetition of a heating-cooling cycle between a high temperature exceeding 1,000 (degree)  C. during electric generation and room temperature, there may happen the case where the internal resistance of the whole conjoint body of the electrode 42 with the separator 44 is increased, and when things are at the worst, the electrode may be separated from the separator.
      <br/>
      Particularly, with a heating-cooling cycle test as the above conducted under conditions considerably severer than actual use conditions, it has been found that, in some conjoint bodies, fine cracks are developed from near the joint boundary between the electrode and separator.
      <br/>
      As shown in FIG. 7b, a stress is most likely to be generated at the portion 48 of the interface between the electrode 42 and the separator 44.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      Alternatively, the same problem as the above has been found also in electrochemical cells other than the SOFC.
      <br/>
      For example, in the case of high temperature water vapor electrolytic cells, the cells are subjected to the heating- cooling cycle between room temperature and 1,000 (degree)  C., with starting and stopping of the high temperature water vapor electrolytic cells.
      <br/>
      Therefore, cells having characteristics which would not be deteriorated even under such severe conditions have been expected.
    </p>
    <p num="11">
      The task of the present invention is, even when electrochemical cells such as SOFCs or the like are subjected to the repetition of a heating-cooling cycle, for example, from operation at high temperatures exceeding 1,000 (degree)  C. to temperature fall to room temperature, to prevent the layer separation and crack formation on and around the joint boundary between the separator and electrode so that the increase of the internal electric resistance can be restricted.
      <br/>
      A further task is to obviate a possibility of developing cracks in the surroundings of the joint boundary of the electrode and separator.
    </p>
    <p num="12">Summary of the Invention</p>
    <p num="13">The layered sintered body according to the present invention comprises an electrode and a separator of an electrochemical cell, wherein a plurality of gas flow passages are provided, which is characterized in that a plurality of grooves are provided on the electrode on a side thereof adjoining to the separator, a plurality of grooves are provided on the separator on a side thereof adjoining to the electrode, and each of the gas flow passages is formed by coupling one of said grooves formed on the electrode with the one opposite thereto of the grooves formed on the separator.</p>
    <p num="14">Further, the electrochemical cell according to the present invention comprises the above-described layered sintered body, a solid electrolyte membrane provided on an electrode, and another electrode membrane provided on the solid electrolyte membrane, which is characterized in that gas in each gas flow passage is hermetically sealed off from external gases by the separator and solid electrolyte membrane.</p>
    <p num="15">When the aforementioned layered sintered bodies or electrochemical cells are manufactured, pug for constituting a green shaped body for an electrode and pug for constituting a green shaped body for a separator are continuously and simultaneously fed into a unitary extrusion die, and extruded from the extrusion die in the form of a layered body consisting of a green shaped body for an electrode and a green shaped body for a separator conjugated with each other, which layered body is then monolithically sintered.</p>
    <p num="16">Further when the abovementioned layered sintered bodies or electrochemical cells are manufactured, a shaped body for an electrode is stacked on a shaped body for a separator to provide a layered body, with interposition of a bond material layer between the electrode and separator, in such a fashion that through-holes each corresponding to gas flow passages are formed inside the layered body, and then the layered body is monolithically sintered under pressure.</p>
    <p num="17">
      As regards the conjoint bodies which are supports of the aforementioned planar-type electric cells, the present inventors investigated the reasons for the deterioration of boundary conditions between the electrodes and separators due to the above-described heating-cooling cycle during the generation which causes deterioration of electric characteristics such as internal resistances or the like, and the separation of layers, or the development of cracks under severe conditions.
      <br/>
      As the result, the following conclusion has been reached.
      <br/>
      Namely, in FIG. 7b, is shown a partial view in an enlarged scale of a joint boundary surface between the electrode 42 and the separator 44.
      <br/>
      It is assumable that the phenomena of the increase of the internal resistance, or the layer separation as well as the development of the cracks are prone to appear in the vicinity of the joint boundary surface.
      <br/>
      However, it has been found that those are liable to develop on the joint boundary surface between the electrode 42 and the separator 44, particularly in the vicinity of the edge 46 of the bank 44e.
    </p>
    <p num="18">Its wherefore is probably that there may be problems such that fine layer separations are prone to be initiated on the joint boundary surface between the electrode and the separator due to a difference in thermal expansion coefficient or the like, as well as discontinuity of ceramic textures, between both materials, and in addition, that electric currents are prone to concentrate on the vicinity of the edge 46, generating local heat and building up stress to form an initiating point of layer separation or cracks.</p>
    <p num="19">
      The present inventors, based on the above new findings, have conceived of forming a plurality of grooves on the electrode on the side thereof adjoining to the separator, also forming a plurality of grooves on the separator on the side thereof adjoining to the electrode, and then forming through-holes for gas flow passages, each by coupling the grooves on the electrode and separator.
      <br/>
      As the result, the corners of each gas flow passage are positioned within the groove on the electrode or separator, and the joint boundary surface between the electrode and separator is formed on a position different from the position of every bottom corner of each bank.
      <br/>
      Namely, discontinuous portions in ceramic texture as the above would not come to the position on or near around the bottom corners of each bank.
      <br/>
      Consequently, since electric currents hardly concentrate on and around the joint boundary surfaces, it has become possible to prevent deterioration of electric characteristics such as the increase of the internal electric resistance in the vicinity of the joint boundary surface, or the development of layer separation or formation of cracks.
    </p>
    <p num="20">
      Further, both the electrode and interconnector have grooves for forming gas flow passages, and the layered sintered bodies have nearly a symmetrical cross-sectional shape.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, the layered sintered bodies and electrochemical cells using the layered sintered bodies have a larger strength as compared with asymmetric ones.
    </p>
    <p num="21">
      Furthermore, in either case where layered bodies are obtained either by a shaping process of two layer conjugate-extrusion, or by conjugating and pressurizing two separately extruded shaped bodies, the above shape has advantages.
      <br/>
      Namely, one of the advantages is that during the two layer conjugate-extrusion from an extrusion die, a shape as close to symmetric as possible is hardly bent immediately after the extrusion.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, the layered bodies are obtained by conjoining an electrode with an interconnector separately shaped by extrusion and then pressurizing the conjoined bodies, the types having grooves are also hardly bent during the extrusion.
      <br/>
      This is because that while electrodes without grooves are necessarily shaped thin, those having grooves can be shaped thicker, in addition, a beam support structure formed by the grooves plays a role of increasing strength, and so are more advantageous in respect of strength.
    </p>
    <p num="22">The electrochemical cells according to the present invention can be used as an oxygen pump, as well as a high temperature water vapor electrolytic cell.</p>
    <p num="23">
      These cells can be used as an apparatus for producing hydrogen and further used as an apparatus for removing water vapor.
      <br/>
      In this case, the following reactions are carried out on each electrode:  (Equation image '1' not included in text)
    </p>
    <p num="24">
      The electrochemical cells according to the present invention further can be used as a NOx decomposition cell.
      <br/>
      This decomposition cell can be used as an apparatus for purifying exhaust gases discharged from motor-vehicles and electric power generators.
      <br/>
      At present, NOx exhausted from gasoline-engines are being treated with ternary-functioning catalysts.
      <br/>
      However, with increasing low fuel consumption type engines, such as lean burn engines, diesel engines or the like, the oxygen content in exhaust gases of these engines increases so much that the ternary catalysts will become inactivated.
    </p>
    <p num="25">
      Then, if the electrochemical cells of the present invention are used as a NOx decomposition cell, it removes oxygen in the exhaust gases passing through the solid electrolyte membrane, concurrently with decomposition by electrolysis of NOx to N2 and O2-, and also can remove the oxygen produced by this electrolysis.
      <br/>
      Besides, with the above process, water vapor in the exhaust gases is electrolyzed to produce hydrogen and oxygen, and the hydrogen reduces the NOx to N2
    </p>
    <p num="26">
      In the case of NOx decomposition cells, it is particularly preferred to use a ceria based ceramic as the solid electrolyte membrane.
      <br/>
      As an anode material, paradium and paradium-ceria cermets are preferred.
    </p>
    <p num="27">
      In the present invention, the cross-sectional shape of the gas flow passages maybe polygonal.
      <br/>
      However, in this instance, it is preferred to round each corner of the polygonal gas passages to a generous radius.
      <br/>
      Thereby, electric currents are readily dispersed over the curved portions during power generation or the like, and the electric currents are more hardly concentrated on the corner edges of the banks.
      <br/>
      In this embodiment, the cross-sectional shape of the gas flow passages is not specifically limited.
      <br/>
      However, it is preferred that the grooves of the electrode and the grooves of the separator have the same type polygonal cross-sections, whereby deterioration due to the power generation cycle may be further decreased.
      <br/>
      By the term "same type polygonal cross-sections" herein used, is meant polygonal cross-sections having the same number of corners.
      <br/>
      It is not necessary for the grooves to have the same depth.
    </p>
    <p num="28">
      The cross-sectional shape of the gas flow passages is preferred to be defined by a closed, rounded outline, which can substantially obviate current concentration as described above.
      <br/>
      Such an outline is not specifically limited.
      <br/>
      However, a circle or ellipse is preferred.
      <br/>
      Further preferred is that both the grooves on the electrode and the grooves on the separator are semi-circular or semi-elliptical, respectively.
    </p>
    <p num="29">
      The grooves provided on the electrode or separator are preferred to have a depth of at least 0.5 mm, whereby the aforementioned function and performance of the present invention will become particularly conspicuous.
      <br/>
      In this sense, in order not to form cracks or the like even under extraordinarily severe conditions, it is further preferred that each groove has a depth of not less than 1.0 mm.
    </p>
    <p num="30">
      Besides, the grooves provided on the electrode or separator are preferred to have a depth of at most 10 mm, whereby the power generation capacity per unit volume of the electrochemical cells can be increased.
      <br/>
      From this point of view, it is further preferred that each groove has a depth of not more than 6 mm.
    </p>
    <p num="31">
      The electrochemical cells according to the present invention are preferred to be formed into a long extending shape.
      <br/>
      The ceramic sintered bodies to be used therefor are also preferred to be formed into a long rectangular shape.
      <br/>
      Concretely, as Japanese Patent Application Kokai No. 05-89,890 discloses, the rectangular shape is preferred to have its long side and short side in the ratio in length at least 2:1, more preferably at least 5:1.
    </p>
    <p num="32">For manufacturing the layered sintered bodies according to the present invention, the following manufacturing process can be adopted.</p>
    <p num="33">In the manufacture of the aforementioned conjoint bodies, the present inventors have conceived of continuously feeding pug for constituting a porous green shaped body and pug for constituting a dense green shaped body simultaneously into a unitary extrusion die; extruding the porous green shaped body and the dense green shaped body in a mutually conjugated state from the die; and then firing monolithically the resulting conjugated body.</p>
    <p num="34">
      According to such a manufacturing process, layered bodies having different cross-sectional shapes can be manufactured by varying the shape of the die.
      <br/>
      Besides, it has been made possible to manufacture particularly a long extending product (e.g., at least 1,000 mm long) by utilizing the extrusion process.
      <br/>
      Further, according to this process, in the course of extrusion shaping, the green shaped body for electrodes and separators form firm contact with each other at conjoint boundary.
      <br/>
      Moreover, since a pressurizing step as in the conventional process is not required, the number of steps in the process can be extremely reduced.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, it has been found that the final layered sintered bodies can be provided with a contact strength and an electroconductive property which are at least comparable to those in the case of utilizing a press shaping as mentioned before.
    </p>
    <p num="35">
      In this embodiment, it is preferred to use an extrusion die of which inlet has a cross-sectional area smaller than that of the outlet.
      <br/>
      With this die, each green shaped body can be more firmly joined to the other at the outlet of the die.
      <br/>
      In addition, the outlet passage and the inlet passage, of the die, are preferred in the ratio in length 1: at least 2, more preferably 1:3.about.5.
    </p>
    <p num="36">
      Extrusion dies having an inlet of circular shape are easily machined in the manufacture thereof.
      <br/>
      In addition, the shape of the inlet of the dies is adequately changed so as to allow the pug to enter easily.
      <br/>
      As an extrusion mechanism for extruding each pug from the die, use may be made of a plunger, vacuum pug mill and the like.
    </p>
    <p num="37">
      If an aqueous binder is used for the pug, since it is not necessary to conduct an exhaust gas treatment as in the case where an organic solvent is used, the equipment can be simplified, and moreover the layer conjugated body just extruded from the die is hardly bent.
      <br/>
      In this case, it is further preferred to make the water content 10.about.20% by weight.
      <br/>
      Examples of the aqueous binder include polyvinyl alcohols, methyl celluloses, ethyl celluloses and the like.
    </p>
    <p num="38">
      Further in extruding the abovementioned layered body, it has been found that there is posed a problem such that the layered body is prone to bending.
      <br/>
      Namely, there is a tendency such that the pug relatively hard has a low flow rate and the other pug relatively soft has a high flow rate, during extrusion.
      <br/>
      This difference in the flow rate results in deformation of the layered body by bending or warping from the outlet of the die towards the advancing tip of the extruded body.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, due to the difference between the flow rates of the pug, there has arisen a phenomenon such that the green shaped bodies are conjugated discordantly with each other at their joint boundary surface.
    </p>
    <p num="39">
      In order to extrude the layered body straight, preventing the bending thereof, so that the green shaped bodies may be conjugated in agreement with each other at their joint boundary surface, both the pug for electrodes and the pug for separators are preferred to have a hardness of 10.about.14, respectively, and the difference between the hardness of the pug is preferred to be at most 2.
      <br/>
      The hardness herein used is determined according to the standard of the NGK clay-hardness tester.
    </p>
    <p num="40">
      However, many difficulties may be encountered in conducting such minute adjustment of the pug in practical manufacturing apparatuses.
      <br/>
      Therefore, when the pug for constituting green shaped bodies for electrodes and the other pug for constituting green shaped bodies for separators are continuously fed into a unitary extrusion die, the pug for constituting green shaped bodies for electrodes can be extruded from a first extrusion mechanism into the die, and the other pug for constituting green shaped bodies for separators can be extruded from a second extrusion mechanism into the die.
      <br/>
      Thus, it has been made possible to prevent the bending or the like of the layered body by mechanically adjusting each extrusion rate or each extrusion pressure of the first and second extrusion mechanisms.
    </p>
    <p num="41">Concretely, for example, when the pug for separators is being extruded from the die at a high flow rate, the extrusion rate of the second extrusion mechanism for extruding the pug for separators is decreased to lower the back pressure, and thus the flow rate of the pug for separators can be decreased.</p>
    <p num="42">
      The aforementioned layered body is press-shaped to produce a conjoint layered body, and the resulting conjoint layered body can be monolithically sintered.
      <br/>
      In this embodiment, it is preferred to apply or print a bond material on the surfaces between the green shaped bodies.
    </p>
    <p num="43">
      In this instance, when the bond material for bonding the separator with the cathode contains at least one of the materials of the separator and electrode, their bonding may be further facilitated.
      <br/>
      Particularly, when the material of the cathode is a perovskite-type oxide composite containing lanthanum and the bond material contains lanthanum chromite, the chromium component in the lanthanum chromite diffuses into the cathode, resulting in a loss of chromium in the composition of lanthanum chromite component in the bond material.
      <br/>
      Consequently, the bond material becomes readily sintered, and the bonding strength will be improved.
      <br/>
      However, in this instance, in order to proceed the diffusion of chromium, it is necessary to sinter at a temperature of at least 1450 (degree)  C.
    </p>
    <p num="44">
      The abovementioned bond material is preferred to be paste prepared by admixing main starting materials with an organic binder and water.
      <br/>
      An organic solvent may be used in lieu of water.
      <br/>
      Examples of the organic binders include polymethyl acrylates, nitrocelluloses, polyvinyl alcohols, methylcelluloses, ethylcelluloses, waxes, acrylate polymers, methacrylate polymers and the like.
    </p>
    <p num="45">
      In the embodiment for press-shaping the layered bodies, it is preferred to dry the layered bodies, prior to the press-shaping.
      <br/>
      By conducting the drying step, the bond material is densified approximately to the same extent as both the press-shaped bodies, when the layered bodies are press-shaped.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the shrinkage of the bond material becomes substantially the same as the shrinkages of both the press-shaped bodies during firing, so that the conditions of the joint boundary surface after firing are extremely improved.
      <br/>
      However, in this drying step, the green shaped bodies for electrodes are prone to warping which is liable to cause separation between green shaped bodies.
      <br/>
      The warping of the green shaped bodies for electrodes, however, can be restrained by the drying step, particularly drying while pressing, of the layered bodies.
    </p>
    <p num="46">
      In this drying step, it is particularly preferred to press the layered body with an annular elastic member fixed around the circumferential surface thereof.
      <br/>
      It is because substantially an isostatic pressure can be applied on the layered body centripetally from its entire circumference by the annular elastic member, even when green shaped bodies have difference in dimension, ruggedness or the like in their circumferencial shape.
      <br/>
      Thus, the elastic member can prevent the layered bodies having a low strength as yet from deformation or fracture due to a forced pressure.
    </p>
    <p num="47">
      The pressure for press-shaping layered bodies is preferred to be at least 100 kgf/cm2, more preferably at least 500 kgf/cm2, with the view of increasing adhesiveness between green shaped bodies of the layered bodies.
      <br/>
      The upper limit of the pressure may be practically at most 10 tf/cm2.
      <br/>
      As the press-shaping process, it is preferred to employ a uniaxial pressing or cold isostatic pressing process.
    </p>
    <p num="48">
      However, in the case where all the green shaped bodies constituting the layered body are plates, it is possible to apply a high pressure loading by means of a uniaxial pressing process.
      <br/>
      However, since the layered bodies which are the object of the present invention are provided with through-holes which are to become gas flow passages after monolithic sintering, a high pressure such as mentioned above will crush the layered bodies towards the through-holes.
    </p>
    <p num="49">
      The present inventors, aiming at solution of this problem, immersed a layered body in a liquid latex, thereby to make the liquid latex adhere not only to exteriors but also to interior surfaces exposed to the gas flow passages of the layered body, then after drying, covered the entire surfaces including the through-holes with an elastic material, and tried to press-shape this layered body by means of a cold isostatic pressing process (CIP process).
      <br/>
      As the result, even a pressure as high as 500 kgf/cm2 could not crush the layered body, and moreover, adhesiveness between the electrode and separator could sufficiently be increased, with the consequence that in the co-sintered body, the electrode and separator were successfully conjoined without forming a seam or gap at the boundary therebetween.
    </p>
    <p num="50">
      The separator is preferred to have a relative density of at least 94% in order to maintain air-tightness.
      <br/>
      The maximum relative density of the separator is 100%.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, the electrode is preferred to have a relative density of at least 60% from the viewpoint of strength, and in order to improve the flowability of gases for power generation, it is preferred to be at most 85%, and more preferably at most 75%.
    </p>
    <p num="51">
      In the present invention, electrodes to be integrally conjugated with a separator include both the cathode (air electrode) and anode (fuel electrode) and, however, the cathode is more preferred.
      <br/>
      Moreover, conjugation of self-support type cathodes with separators is particularly preferred.
      <br/>
      Because, when a layered body comprising green shaped bodies of a cathode and separator is shaped, the combination of the self-support type cathode and separator provides a thicker and stronger layered body which is easier to handle.
    </p>
    <p num="52">
      The main starting material for the separators is preferred to be a perovskite type oxide composite containing lanthanum, more preferably, lanthanum chromite, because they have heat resistance, oxidation resistance and reduction resistance.
      <br/>
      Further, the pug for constituting green shaped bodies for separators can be produced by admixing the above main starting materials with an organic binder and water.
      <br/>
      Examples of the organic binder include polymethyl acrylates, nitrocelluloses, polyvinyl alcohols, methyl celluloses, ethyl celluloses, starch, waxes, acrylate polymers, methacrylate polymers or the like.
      <br/>
      When the quantity of the main starting materials is 100 parts by weight, it is preferred to admix the organic binder in an amount of 0.5.about.5 parts by weight.
    </p>
    <p num="53">
      The main starting material for cathodes is preferred to be a perovskite type oxide composite containing lanthanum, more preferably lanthanum manganite or lanthanum cobaltite, and most preferably lanthanum manganite.
      <br/>
      The lanthanum chromite and lanthanummanganite maybe doped with strontium, calcium, chromium (in the case of lanthanum manganite) , cobalt, iron, nickel, aluminum, or the like.
      <br/>
      The main starting material for anodes is preferred to be nickel, paradium, platinum, nickel-zirconia mixed powder, platinum-zirconia mixed powder, paradium-zirconia mixed powder, nickel-ceria mixed powder, platinum-ceria mixed powder, paradium-ceria mixed powder, or the like.
    </p>
    <p num="54">
      The pug for constituting shaped bodies for electrodes can be produced by admixing the main starting material for electrodes with an organic binder, foaming agent and water.
      <br/>
      Examples of the organic binder include the ones for the separators.
      <br/>
      Further, when the quantity of the main starting materials is 100 parts by weight, it is preferred to admix the organic binder in an amount of 0.5.about.5 parts by weight.
    </p>
    <p num="55">
      The dewaxing or caramelizing step can be conducted separately from the firing step.
      <br/>
      However, it is preferred to dewax press-shaped bodies or layered bodies in the course of temperature increase during firing.
      <br/>
      For the press-shaped bodies or layered bodies for solid electrolyte type fuel cells, the firing temperature is generally 1,300 (degree)  C..about.1,700 (degree)  C.
    </p>
    <p num="56">
      As a material for solid electrolyte membrane, yttria-stabilized zirconia or yttria-partially-stabilized zirconia is preferred.
      <br/>
      However, other materials also can be used.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, in the case of NOx decomposing cells, cerium oxide is also preferred.
    </p>
    <p num="57">
      Further, the process for manufacturing the layered sintered bodies according to the present invention is not specifically limited.
      <br/>
      For example, an electrode and a separator are produced severally, and then these can be conjoined with each other.

      <br/>
      It is conjectured that since the adhesiveness at the boundary surface between the cathode and separator is low, a local layer separation is caused by the application of the cooling-heating cycle, with the consequence that the internal electric resistance of the cell is increased and the electrolytic performance is lowered.

      As described hereinabove, according to the present invention, even when an electrochemical cell is subjected to the repetition of a heating-cooling cycle of high temperature, for example, at 1,000 (degree)  C. down to room temperature, an increase of the internal resistance on and around the joint surface between the separator and electrode can be restrained and the layer separation at the joint surface can be prevented.
