      Field of the Invention
    </p>
    <p num="3">The present invention generally relates to electron beam sources and more particularly to a micro-electron gun known also as micro-field emission gun and a fabrication process thereof.</p>
    <p num="4">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
    <p num="5">
      Micro-field emission guns have been studied originally in the purpose of breaking through the limit of operational speed of solid-state devices.
      <br/>
      In such a study, attempts have been made to fabricate integrated circuits of vacuum tubes by using the microfabrication technology developed in the art of semiconductor fabrication.
      <br/>
      Recently, however, intensive efforts are being made to construct a flat panel display by arranging such micro-field emission guns in a two-dimensional plane, such that an image is formed on a screen opposing such a field emitter array by the electron beams emitted from the micro-field emission guns forming the field emitter array.
      <br/>
      It should also be noted that such micro-field emission guns are advantageous in the point that one can produce a high energy electron beam without using bulky columns conventionally used for producing such a high energy electron beam.
      <br/>
      Thus, the possibility has now emerged to construct very compact electron microscopes or other analyzing tools that use such accelerated electron beams by using the micro-field emission guns.
    </p>
    <p num="6">FIG. 1 shows the construction of a conventional micro-field emission gun.</p>
    <p num="7">
      Referring to FIG. 1, the micro-field emission gun is constructed on a semiconductor substrate 11 such as Si and includes a sharply pointed conical emitter 12, wherein the emitter 12 is surrounded by a gate electrode 13.
      <br/>
      The gate electrode 13 induces an electric field between the gate electrode 13 and the emitter 12 such that the electrons are emitted from the emitter 12 as a result of field emission.
      <br/>
      The emitter 12 may have a diameter of 2  MU m and is formed in a hole 14a that is formed in an insulation film 14 of SiO2 or SiO covering the surface of the substrate 11 such that the hole 14a exposes the surface of the substrate 11.
      <br/>
      Typically, a number of such 14a are formed in rows and columns in the insulation film 14 with a pitch of about 300  MU m, and accordingly, the emitters 12 are also formed in rows and columns with a corresponding pitch of about 300  MU m. In such a construction, a large electric field is induced in response to the control voltage applied to the gate electrode 13, while such a large electric field causes a deformation in the surface potential barrier of the conductor material such as Si or W that forms the emitter 12.
      <br/>
      Thereby, the electrons are emitted to the exterior of the emitter 12 by passing through the deformed surface potential barrier by tunneling effect.
      <br/>
      The structure shown in FIG. 1 can be fabricated easily by the microfabrication technology used in the production of semiconductor devices.
    </p>
    <p num="8">FIGS. 2A-2D show the fabrication process of the micro-field emission gun of FIG. 1.</p>
    <p num="9">
      Referring to FIGS. 2A-2D, a mask pattern 12a of SiO2 is provided in the step of FIG. 2A on a part of the silicon substrate 11 on which the emitter 12 is to be formed, and a reactive ion etching process (RIE) is conducted in the step of FIG. 2B upon the substrate 11 while using the pattern 12a as a mask.
      <br/>
      Thereby, the RIE process is set such that the etching proceeds obliquely to the surface of the substrate 11, and one obtains a truncated-conical region 12b in correspondence to the mask 12a.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      Next, the surface of the substrate 11 is subjected to oxidation while leaving the mask 12a such that an oxide film 12c is formed on the inclined, conical surface of the region 12b.
      <br/>
      Further, an insulation layer 14 of SiO and a layer of Cr to be used for the gate electrode 13, are deposited consecutively upon the silicon oxide film 12c on the substrate 11.
      <br/>
      Thereby, one obtains a structure shown in FIG. 2C.
    </p>
    <p num="11">
      Further, by removing the mask pattern 12a, a structure of FIG. 2D is obtained.
      <br/>
      In the structure of FIG. 2D, it should be noted that one can form a sharply pointed structure by removing the oxide film 12c.
    </p>
    <p num="12">
      In the micro-field emission gun of the structure of FIG. 1 or FIG. 2D, an acceleration voltage of several hundred volts is applied across the gate electrode 13 and the substrate 11, and an electron beam of several hundred electron volts is obtained.
      <br/>
      On the other hand, this means that an acceleration voltage of several thousand kilovolts has to be applied across the substrate 11 and the gate electrode 13 in order to obtain an accelerated, high energy electron beam of several kilo-electron volts, which are required in electron microscopes or other various analyzing tools.
      <br/>
      As the insulation layer 14 has a thickness of about 1  MU m or less, such an application of high acceleration voltage results in a formation of a very high electric field in the order of 109 V/m in the insulation layer 14.
      <br/>
      Thereby, a leakage current of several micro-amperes cannot be avoided in the insulation layer 14.
    </p>
    <p num="13">
      In order to reduce the level of the leakage current, it is necessary to increase the thickness of the insulation layer 14 to be larger than 10  MU m, while the formation of such a thick insulation layer by means of conventionally used semiconductor fabrication processes such as CVD or sputtering is difficult.
      <br/>
      It is, of course, possible to bond a thick glass slab upon the gate electrode and provide an acceleration electrode upon such a glass slab by means of adhesives, while such a use of adhesives raises a problem in that the gas released from the adhesives may cause a contamination of the field emitter guns and hence undesirable deterioration of the emission characteristics thereof.
    </p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="14">Accordingly, it is a general object of the present invention to provide a novel and useful micro-field emission gun and a fabrication process thereof wherein the foregoing problems are eliminated.</p>
    <p num="15">Another and more specific object of the present invention is to provide a micro-field emission gun having an acceleration electrode on a gate electrode with a separation therefrom, for producing a high energy electron beam, and a fabrication process thereof.</p>
    <p num="16">Another object of the present invention is to provide a method for fabricating a micro-field emission gun, the micro-field emission gun having an emitter provided on a substrate, an insulator layer surrounding said emitter, and a gate electrode provided on said insulator layer so as to surround said emitter, the micro-field emission gun thereby emitting an electron beam from said emitter in response to a control voltage applied to said gate electrode, the method comprising the steps of:</p>
    <p num="17">providing an insulator slab, formed with a penetrating hole acting as a passage of the electron beam, upon the gate electrode, such that the penetrating hole is aligned with the emitter of the field emission gun;</p>
    <p num="18">bonding the insulator slab upon the gate electrode by means of an anodic bonding process; and</p>
    <p num="19">providing an acceleration electrode on the insulator slab such that the acceleration electrode covers a surface of the insulator slab facing away from the gate electrode, except for a passage of the electron beam.</p>
    <p num="20">Another object of the present invention is to provide a micro-field emission gun, comprising:</p>
    <p num="21">a substrate;</p>
    <p num="22">an emitter provided on a surface of the substrate, said emitter emitting electrons in response to a gate electric field applied thereto;</p>
    <p num="23">a first insulation layer provided on the surface of the substrate, the first insulation layer carrying thereon a first penetrating hole in alignment with the emitter as a passage of the electrons;</p>
    <p num="24">a gate electrode layer provided on a surface of the first insulation layer, the gate electrode carrying thereon a first opening in alignment with the first penetrating hole and acting as a passage of the electrons, the gate electrode being applied with a gate voltage and creating the gate electric field in response thereto;</p>
    <p num="25">a second insulation layer provided on a surface of the gate electrode layer and carrying a second penetrating hole in alignment with the first opening as a passage of the electrons, the second insulation layer having a thickness at least greater than 10  MU m; and</p>
    <p num="26">an acceleration electrode layer provided on a surface of the second insulation layer, the acceleration electrode layer carrying a second opening in alignment with the second penetrating hole as a passage of the electrons, the acceleration electrode layer being applied with an acceleration voltage for accelerating the electrons.</p>
    <p num="27">
      According to the present invention as set forth above, the acceleration electrode for accelerating the electron beam is provided with a substantial separation from the gate electrode, with a thick insulator slab such as a glass plate intervening therebetween.
      <br/>
      As a result, development of a large electric field is successfully avoided in the first insulation layer even when a very large acceleration voltage is applied between the gate electrode and the acceleration electrode, and the problem of leakage current in the first insulator layer is successfully eliminated.
      <br/>
      As the thick second insulator layer is bonded upon the gate electrode by the anodic bonding process without using any adhesives, the problem of gas release from the adhesives is entirely eliminated.
      <br/>
      As the anodic bonding process allows use of glass slab of arbitrary thickness, the increase in the electric field strength in the second insulator layer is also suppressed successfully by using a thick slab.
    </p>
    <p num="28">Another object of the present invention is to provide a method for fabricating a micro-field emission gun, the micro-field emission gun having an emitter provided on a substrate, an insulator layer surrounding the emitter, and a gate electrode provided on the insulator layer so as to surround the emitter, the micro-field emission gun thereby emitting an electron beam from the emitter in response to a control voltage applied to the gate electrode, the method comprising the steps of:</p>
    <p num="29">placing a semiconductor slab on the gate electrode, the semiconductor slab carrying thereon a penetrating hole acting as a passage of the electron beam and comprising a p-type layer and an n-type layer contacting each other intimately at a p-n junction interface, the p-type layer further carrying an oxide film on a surface thereof, such that the penetrating hole is aligned with the emitter and such that the surface of the p-type layer carrying thereon the oxide film faces the gate electrode; and</p>
    <p num="30">bonding the semiconductor slab upon the gate electrode by an anodic bonding process.</p>
    <p num="31">
      According to the present invention, the acceleration electrode is separated from the gate electrode by a thick semiconductor slab that includes therein a p-n junction.
      <br/>
      Thereby, the p-n junction is reversely biased by the acceleration voltage and the semiconductor slab effectively insulates the acceleration electrode from the gate electrode.
      <br/>
      In this case, too, the problem of gas release associated with the bonding of an insulation layer is eliminated as a result of use of the anodic bonding process.
      <br/>
      Further, it should be noted that such a construction allows use of the n-type layer as the acceleration electrode itself.
      <br/>
      Thereby, separate formation of the acceleration electrode can be eliminated.
      <br/>
      It should be noted that the anodic bonding process is accomplished by causing a transport of ions between the gate electrode and the oxide film contacting thereto.
    </p>
    <p num="32">Another object of the present invention is to provide a method for fabricating a micro-field emission gun, the micro-field emission gun having an emitter provided on a substrate, an insulator layer surrounding the emitter, and a gate electrode provided on the insulator layer so as to surround the emitter, the micro-field emission gun thereby emitting an electron beam from the emitter in response to a control voltage applied to the gate electrode, the method comprising the steps of:</p>
    <p num="33">placing an insulator slab on the gate electrode;</p>
    <p num="34">bonding the insulator slab upon the gate electrode by an anodic bonding process;</p>
    <p num="35">providing a conductor layer upon a surface of the insulator slab at a side away from a side of the insulator slab facing said gate electrode, such that the conductor layer carries an opening for exposing the surface of the insulator slab in correspondence to a passage of the electron beam emitted from the emitter;</p>
    <p num="36">removing said insulator slab for a part thereof exposed by the opening of the conductor layer by an etching process to form the passage of said electron beam in the insulator slab.</p>
    <p num="37">
      According to the present invention, the passage of the electron beam is formed in the insulator slab by conducting an etching process while using the conductor layer acting as the acceleration electrode, as a mask.
      <br/>
      Thereby, the fabrication process of the micro-field emission gun is substantially simplified.
      <br/>
      In such a process, the step for aligning the acceleration electrode and the insulator slab with each other for alignment of the respective electron beam passages is eliminated.
    </p>
    <p num="38">Another object of the present invention is to provide a method for fabricating a micro-field emission gun, the micro-field emission gun having an emitter provided on a substrate, a first insulator layer surrounding the emitter, a gate electrode provided on the first insulator layer so as to surround the emitter, the micro-field emission gun thereby emitting an electron beam from the emitter in response to a control voltage applied to the gate electrode, a second insulator layer having a passage of the electron beam and provided on the gate electrode, and an acceleration electrode having a passage of the electron beam and provided on the second insulator layer, the acceleration electrode thereby accelerating the electron beam in response to an acceleration voltage applied thereto, the method comprising the steps of:</p>
    <p num="39">providing a third insulator layer on the acceleration electrode by conducting a first anodic bonding process, the third insulator layer having a passage of the electron beam;</p>
    <p num="40">forming an electrostatic lens as an alternate stacking of a plurality of electrode films each having an opening acting as a passage of said electron beam and a plurality of insulation films each having an opening acting as a passage of the electron beam, such that respective openings are aligned with each other to form a straight path of the electron beam extending from a bottom surface to a top surface of the electrostatic lens; and</p>
    <p num="41">bonding the lowermost electrode film of the electrostatic lens upon the third insulator layer by conducting a second anodic bonding process.</p>
    <p num="42">
      According to the present invention, an electrostatic lens is provided on the acceleration electrode.
      <br/>
      Thereby, it becomes possible to converge or diverge the high energy electron beam produced by the micro-field emission gun and accelerated by the acceleration electrode.
      <br/>
      By using the conductor films having the openings for the passage of the electron beam as a mask, it is possible to provide corresponding openings in the intervening insulation films with exact alignment.
      <br/>
      Further, such a self-alignment etching process simplifies the fabrication process of the electrostatic lens substantially.

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
    <p num="45">FIG. 3 shows the silicon substrate 21 used in the micro-field emission gun shown in FIG. 1.</p>
    <p num="46">
      Referring to FIG. 3, the silicon substrate 21 carries a row of emitters 20a corresponding to the emitter 12 of FIG. 1, wherein the emitters 20a as a whole form an emitter array 20.
      <br/>
      As each of the emitters 20a is formed according to the process of FIGS. 2A-2D, the process of formation of the individual emitters will be omitted from the description.
      <br/>
      In a typical example, the substrate 21 has a size of 5 mm * 10 mm, and the emitters 20a are formed with a pitch of 300  MU m. Further, the substrate 21 carries a film 21b of Cr acting as the gate electrode 13, wherein it will be noted that the emitters 20a are exposed in correspondence to the openings formed in the Cr film 21b with a diameter of about 2  MU m. Further, the Cr film 21b carries a pair of alignment marks 21a at respective positions, which is determined with respect to the edges of the substrate 21, wherein the alignment mark 21a may have a diameter of 50  MU m.
    </p>
    <p num="47">
      FIG. 4 shows the construction of an insulator slab 22 that is to be provided upon the substrate 21 in contact with the Cr film 21b, wherein FIG. 4 shows the insulator slab 22 before it is bonded upon the substrate 21.
      <br/>
      It should be noted that the insulator slab 22 forms a thick insulation layer on the Cr film 21b that acts as the gate electrode of the micro-field emission gun.
    </p>
    <p num="48">
      Referring to FIG. 4, the insulator slab 22 may be formed of a borosilicate glass, SiO2, SiO, and the like, and has a thickness of about 100  MU m and a size corresponding to the size of the substrate.
      <br/>
      Further, the insulator slab 22 is provided with a plurality of penetrating holes 22a, wherein the penetrating holes 22a are formed so as to align with the corresponding emitters 20a on the substrate 21 when the insulator slab 22 is properly bonded upon the substrate 21.
      <br/>
      In the illustrated example, the insulator slab 22 may have a size of 5 mm * 10 mm in correspondence to the size of the substrate 21, while the penetrating holes 22a are formed with a pitch of 300  MU m in correspondence to the pitch of the emitters 20a forming the emitter array 20 on the substrate 21.
      <br/>
      Thereby, the holes 22a form a hole array 22b.
      <br/>
      Each of the holes 22a may be formed to have a diameter of about 100  MU m, wherein the holes 22a are formed with a tolerance of several microns or less with respect to the outer size of the insulator slab 22.
    </p>
    <p num="49">FIG. 5 shows a conductor plater 23 to be bonded upon the insulator slab 22 of FIG. 4.</p>
    <p num="50">
      Referring to FIG. 5, the conductor plate 23 may be formed of a metal plate such as Ta, Ti, or Kovar (trade name), or a semiconductor substrate of Si, Ge, GaAs, and the like, and has a size of 5 mm * 10 mm in correspondence to the size of the substrate 21a nd the size of the insulator slab 22.
      <br/>
      Typically, the plate 23 has a thickness of 50  MU m and carries a plurality of penetrating holes 23a formed in correspondence to the emitters 20a on the substrate 21, wherein the holes 23a form a hole array 23b.
      <br/>
      Further, the conductor plate 23 is formed with further penetrating holes 23a provided in correspondence with the alignment marks 21a.
      <br/>
      Each of the penetrating holes 23a has a diameter of typically 50  MU m and is formed by an electrospark machining process with a pitch of 300  MU mm with respect to the adjacent holes 23a, in correspondence to the pitch of the emitters 20a on the substrate 21.
      <br/>
      Similarly, the alignment marks 23c are formed with an electrospark machining process with a diameter of 100  MU m. By using the electrospark machining process, it is possible to form the holes 23a or 23c with a precision of 1  MU m or less.
    </p>
    <p num="51">FIG. 6 shows the bonding process of the insulator slab 22 of FIG. 4 and the conductor plate of FIG. 5.</p>
    <p num="52">
      Referring to FIG. 6, the bonding process is achieved by using a jig 31 that holds the insulator slab 22 of FIG. 4 and the conductor plate 23 of FIG. 5 in mutual alignment, wherein an anodic bonding process is applied to the insulator slab 22 and the conductor plate 23 thus held in the jig 31.
      <br/>
      More specifically, the insulator slab 22 and the conductor plate 23 abut an inner surface 31a of the jig 31, and the slab 22 and the plate 23 are aligned with a precision of several microns.
    </p>
    <p num="53">
      Next, while holding the insulator slab 22 and the conductor plate 23 together on the jig 31 of FIG. 6, negative and positive voltages are applied respectively to the insulator slab 22 and the conductor plate 23.
      <br/>
      Further, the environmental pressure of the jig 31 is reduced to about 1 * 10-5 Torr, and the entire jig 31 is heated to a temperature of about 300 (degree)  C. by energizing a heating mechanism 32 of the jig 31.
      <br/>
      The magnitude of the d.c. voltage applied across the insulator slab 22 and the conductor plate 23 is set at about 300 volts.
    </p>
    <p num="54">
      Upon such an application of the heat, the mobility of sodium ions in the glass increases substantially, and the sodium ions are moved to the cathode as a result of the electric field created by the d.c. voltage.
      <br/>
      As a result of such a transport of the sodium ions, oxygen ions are left in the glass and form a negatively-charged region.
      <br/>
      On the other hand, the sodium ions are accumulated to form a positively charged region on the surface of the conductor slab 22.
      <br/>
      Thereby, the intimate contact between the conductor plate 23 and the insulator slab 22 is further facilitated.
      <br/>
      Ultimately, a firm bond is established between the insulator slab 22 and the conductor plate 23, and there the insulator slab 22 and the conductor plate 23 are firmly bonded to each other, without using adhesives.
      <br/>
      Typically, the foregoing d.c. voltage is applied for about 10 minutes.
    </p>
    <p num="55">
      Next, the insulator slab 22 thus prepared and carrying thereon the conductor plate 23 integrally, is then bonded upon the substrate 21 of FIG. 3 that carries thereon the emitter array 20.
      <br/>
      More specifically, the substrate 21 is held on a jig 41 shown in FIG. 7, and the slab 22 is placed upon the substrate 21 thus held on the jig 41.
      <br/>
      Thereby, the jig 41 has a fine adjustment mechanism 42 for adjusting the position of the insulator slab 22 with respect to the substrate 21, and the mechanism 42 is used for aligning the positioning marks 23c of the conductor plate 23 with respect to the corresponding alignment marks 21a on the substrate 21 within the accuracy of 1  MU m, under microscopic observation.
      <br/>
      Although not illustrated, the jig 41 has a positioning part for abutting with the edge of the substrate 21 at a predetermined position.
      <br/>
      On the other hand, the foregoing fine adjustment mechanism 42 includes piezo elements for engaging with the edges of the foregoing slab 22 or plate 23 for moving the same in the direction of the arrows as well as corresponding return springs.
      <br/>
      Further, a microscope is provided for observing the state of the alignment.
    </p>
    <p num="56">
      More specifically, the substrate 21 and the slab 22 are coarsely aligned within a precision of about 10  MU m, by aligning the respective edges with each other.
      <br/>
      Next, while observing the positioning mark 23c with the microscope, the fine adjustment mechanism 42 is driven such that the mark 23c and the mark 21a overlap with each other concentrically.
      <br/>
      FIGS. 8A and 8B show such a microscopic alignment of the alignment marks 23c and 21a.
      <br/>
      In a typical example, an objective lens of  * 20 magnification and an eye piece lens of  * 10 magnification are used in the microscope, and the alignment of the mark 23c and the mark 21a is detected by using a cursor 44 that is formed in the view field of the eye piece lens.
    </p>
    <p num="57">
      In this process, the microscope is focused at the beginning upon surface of the substrate 21, and the jig 41 is moved such that the center of the mark 21a, which has a diameter of 50  MU m, aligns with the center of the cursor 44.
      <br/>
      Next, while firmly holding the substrate 21, the focusing of the microscope is changed to the surface of the conductor plate 23, and the fine adjusting mechanism 42 is activated until the center of the mark 23c, which has a diameter of 100  MU m, aligns with the center of the cursor 44.
      <br/>
      Thereby, it is possible to align the center of the mark 21a and the center of the mark 23c with a precision of 1  MU m.
    </p>
    <p num="58">
      After carrying out such an alignment for all of the marks 21a and 23c, the environmental pressure of the jig 41 is reduced to a pressure of 10-5 Torr or less.
      <br/>
      Further, by energizing a heating mechanism 43 of the jig 41, the temperature of the insulator slab 22 and the substrate 21, more specifically the temperature of the junction interface between the slab 22 and the substrate 21 is raised to about 300 (degree)  C. By applying a d.c. voltage of about 300 volts across the slab 22 and the substrate 21 for about 10 minutes, such that the negative voltage is applied to the slab 22 and the positive voltage is applied to the gate electrode 21b on the substrate 21, one can achieve a firm bonding between the insulator slab 22 and the substrate 21.
      <br/>
      In this case, too, anodic bond is formed between the cations in the gate electrode 21b and the oxygen ions in the glass.
    </p>
    <p num="59">
      As a result of such an anodic bonding process, a micro-field emission gun shown in FIG. 9, wherein the acceleration electrode 23 is separated from the gate electrode 21b by the insulator layer 22.
      <br/>
      In the structure of FIG. 9, the opening 23a formed in the acceleration electrode 23 and acting as the path of the electron beam aligns with the emitter 20b with a the precision of 1  MU m. As the insulator layer 22 is formed by the anodic bond of a thick insulator slab such as a glass slab, one can form the insulator layer 22 easily with a thickness exceeding 10  MU m, in contrast to the conventional device that forms the insulator layer by a deposition process.
      <br/>
      In the illustrated example described heretofore, a slab of borosilicate glass having a thickness of 100  MU m has been used.
      <br/>
      Of course, the material for the slab 22 is not limited to such a borosilicate glass but glasses of other composition may also be used.
      <br/>
      It is preferable that such a glass used for the slab 22 contains cations that can move relatively freely at the temperature used for the anodic bonding process.
    </p>
    <p num="60">
      In the micro-field emission gun of FIG. 9, in which the acceleration electrode 23 is provided separately from the gate electrode 21b and the insulator layer 22 intervening between the gate electrode 21b and the acceleration electrode 23 with a thickness of at least 10  MU m, preferably 100  MU m or more, one can successfully avoid the problem of high acceleration voltage applied to the gate electrode 21b when accelerating the electron beam.
      <br/>
      Even when a voltage of several kilovolts is applied to the acceleration electrode 23, the electric field induced in the insulator layer 14 is reduced to 1/100-1/1000 of the electric field that is created therein when the same acceleration voltage is directly applied to the gate electrode, and the leakage current flowing through the insulator layer 14 is substantially eliminated.
    </p>
    <p num="61">
      In the foregoing steps of FIGS. 6 and 7, it should be noted that the conductor layer 23 forming the acceleration electrode is anodically bonded upon the insulator slab 22 prior to the anodic bonding of the slab 22 upon the substrate 21.
      <br/>
      However, it is obvious that one can carry out the anodic bonding of the insulator slab 22 upon the substrate 21 first, followed by the anodic bonding of the conductor plate 23 upon the insulator slab 22.
      <br/>
      Further, the steps of FIGS. 6 and 7 may be conducted simultaneously.
    </p>
    <p num="62">
      Next, a second embodiment of the present invention will be described with reference to FIGS. 10A-8D, wherein the present embodiment achieves the desired separation of the acceleration electrode from the gate electrode by means of a p-n junction formed in a semiconductor substrate.
      <br/>
      In the description hereinafter, those parts corresponding to the parts described previously are designated by the same reference numerals and the description thereof will be omitted.
    </p>
    <p num="63">
      Referring to FIG. 10A, a p-type semiconductor substrate 51 is prepared.
      <br/>
      The substrate may be a Si substrate doped by B with a concentration of 1015 cm-3 and may have a thickness of about 100  MU m.
    </p>
    <p num="64">In the step of FIG. 10B, an n-type layer 5lb of Si doped by P with a concentration level of 1015 cm-3 is grown epitaxially on a principal surface 51a of the substrate 51 with a thickness of about 2  MU m.</p>
    <p num="65">
      Further, in the step of FIG. 10C, an oxide film 51d is deposited on a second principal surface 51c of the substrate 51 opposite to the foregoing principal surface 51a, with a thickness of about 2  MU m. Further, the step of FIG. 10D is conducted wherein a series of penetrating holes 51e are formed on the structure thus obtained by means of an electrospark machining process with a diameter of about 10  MU m, wherein the holes 51e are formed with a pitch of 300  MU m in correspondence to the emitters 20a on the substrate 21.
      <br/>
      It should be noted that the holes 51e act as a passage of the electron beams emitted from the emitters 20a.
      <br/>
      Further, a pair of penetrating holes 51f each having a diameter of about 100  MU m are formed also on the structure thus obtained as an alignment mark, wherein the holes 51f are formed at respective positions predetermined with respect to the penetrating holes 51e with a precision of 1  MU m or less.
      <br/>
      Further, by scribing the structure of FIG. 10D, one obtains a structure 50 of FIG. 11, wherein the structure 50 may have a size of 10 mm * 5 mm.
    </p>
    <p num="66">
      Next, the structure 50 is placed upon the substrate 21 held on the jig 41 shown in FIG. 7, such that the oxide film 51d contacts with the gate electrode 21b covering the surface of the substrate 21.
      <br/>
      Further, by activating the fine adjustment mechanism, the structure 50 is aligned with respect to the substrate 21 under microscopic observation such that the alignment mark 51f of the structure 51 aligns with the corresponding alignment mark 21a of the substrate 21 within the precision of 1  MU m.
    </p>
    <p num="67">
      After the foregoing alignment, the environmental pressure of the jig 41 is reduced to a pressure of 10-5 Torr or less similarly as before, and the anodic bonding of the oxide film 51d and the gate electrode 21b is achieved at 300 (degree)  C. while applying a d.c. voltage of about 300 volts between the oxide film 51d and the gate electrode 21b.
      <br/>
      Again, a positive voltage is applied to the gate electrode 21b and a negative voltage is applied to the oxide film 51d.
      <br/>
      As a result, the structure 50 of FIG. 11 is firmly bonded upon the micro-field emission gun 21 as indicated in the cross-section of FIG. 12.
    </p>
    <p num="68">
      In the operational state of the micro-field emission gun of FIG. 12, it should be noted that a high voltage is applied to the n-type layer 51b of the structure 51.
      <br/>
      As a result, the p-n junction interface between the p-type substrate 51 and the n-type layer 51b is reversely-biased, and the p-type substrate 51 acts, together with the n-type layer 51b, as an insulator layer.
      <br/>
      As the substrate 51 has a thickness of about 100  MU m, the leakage current through the substrate 51 is negligible even when a high acceleration voltage in the order of several kilovolts is applied to the n-type layer 51b.
      <br/>
      In this embodiment, it should further be noted that the n-type layer 51b acts as the acceleration electrode and it is not necessary to provide the acceleration electrode separately.
    </p>
    <p num="69">Next, a third embodiment of the present invention will be described with reference to FIGS. 13-20, wherein those parts described previously with preceding drawings are designated by the same reference numerals and the description thereof will be omitted.</p>
    <p num="70">Referring to FIG. 13, a glass slab 61 having photosensitivity is bonded upon the substrate 21 on which the emitter array 20 is formed, by means of the anodic bonding process, wherein the glass slab 61 may have a thickness of about 100  MU m. Such a photosensitive glass is available from HOYA Co., Ltd, Japan under the trade name of PEG3.</p>
    <p num="71">
      In the step of FIG. 13, the substrate 21 is held on the jig 31 shown in FIG. 6 and the environmental pressure of the jig 31 is reduced to the pressure of 10-5 Torr.
      <br/>
      Thereby, the glass slab 61 is bonded firmly upon the gate electrode 21b by conducting the anodic bonding process at 300 (degree)  C. for 10 minutes while simultaneously applying a d.c. voltage of 300 volts, similarly as before.
      <br/>
      Again, a positive voltage is applied to the gate electrode 21b while a negative voltage is applied to the glass slab 61.
      <br/>
      In the case of FIG. 13, the heating of the jig is achieved by a heating mechanism 60.
      <br/>
      As a result of such an anodic bonding process, the glass slab 61 is firmly bonded upon the micro-field emission gun 21 underneath.
    </p>
    <p num="72">
      Next, in the step of FIG. 14, a layer 62 of Cr is deposited on the surface of the glass slab 61 by a vacuum deposition process with a thickness of about 0.5  MU m, followed by a deposition of a positive resist layer 63 on the layer 62.
      <br/>
      Further, in the step of FIG. 15, the resist layer 63 is exposed according to a predetermined pattern, followed by the step of FIG. 16 for developing the resist layer 63 exposed in the step of FIG. 15. As a result of the development, a resist mask pattern 63a is formed such that only the region corresponding to the emitter 20a is exposed.
      <br/>
      In the exposure process of FIG. 15, it should be noted that the resist pattern 63a includes a number of openings each having a diameter of 50  MU m and formed with a pitch of 300  MU m in correspondence to the emitters 20a that form the emitter array 20 on the substrate 21, by using the exposure mask 21c, which has been used for the exposure of the emitter array 20, as the reference.
      <br/>
      Further, the step of FIG. 16 is conducted for patterning the Cr layer 62 while using the resist pattern 63a as a mask, and a Cr pattern 62a shown in FIG. 17 is obtained.
    </p>
    <p num="73">
      Further, in the step of FIG. 18, the resist pattern 63a remaining on the Cr pattern 62a is removed, and the exposure of the photosensitive glass slab 61 is conducted in the step of FIG. 19 while using the Cr pattern 62a as a mask.
      <br/>
      As a result, a latent image corresponding to the pattern of the mask 62a is formed in the glass slab 61.
      <br/>
      Further, the step of FIG. 20 is conducted, wherein the structure of FIG. 19 is heated to a temperature of about 400 (degree)  C. As a result of such a thermal annealing process, the part of the glass slab 61, in which the latent image is formed, causes a crystallization, and the glass slab 61 changes to be soluble to acid as a result of such a crystallization.
      <br/>
      By dissolving the crystallized part of the slab 61 by an acid, therefore, one obtains a structure shown in FIG. 20, in which the glass slab 61 is formed with penetrating holes 61a in correspondence to the exposed region of the slab 61.
      <br/>
      The penetrating holes 61a thus formed serve for the passage of the electron beam.
      <br/>
      As already noted, the holes 61a have a diameter of about 50  MU m and are formed with a pitch of about 300  MU m in correspondence to the individual emitters 20a.
    </p>
    <p num="74">After the step of FIG. 20, the structure is heated to a temperature of about 650 (degree)  C., and the glass forming the slab 61 crystallizes into a chemically as well as physically stable phase, which is also insensitive to the exposure.</p>
    <p num="75">
      Finally, in the step of FIG. 21, the structure of FIG. 20 is subjected to a deposition of Cr while rotating the structure about an axis generally perpendicular to the substrate 21.
      <br/>
      Thereby, the Cr atoms are deposited obliquely with an angle of about 60 degrees, and causes a deposition of a thick Cr layer 64 selectively upon the Cr pattern 62a as indicated in FIG. 22. The Cr layer 64 is thereby used as the acceleration electrode of the micro-field emission gun.
    </p>
    <p num="76">
      According to the process of the present embodiment, the insulation layer 61 and the acceleration electrode 64 are formed with a self-alignment, and the fabrication process of the micro-field emission gun is substantially simplified.
      <br/>
      As the acceleration electrode 64 is formed on the thick insulation layer 61 similarly to the previous embodiments, the micro-field emission gun of the present embodiment can effectively suppress the leak current in the insulation layer 61 even when a very high acceleration voltage is applied to the acceleration electrode 64.
    </p>
    <p num="77">
      When using the micro-field emission guns of any of the previous embodiments to construct various apparatuses that use a high energy electron beam, examples of which may be electron microscopes, electron beam exposure apparatuses, electron micro-analyzers, and the like, it is necessary to converge the obtained electron beam and deflect the same as desired.
      <br/>
      Of course, such beam convergence and deflection of electron beams are in principle possible by using conventional electron lenses or electrostatic deflectors, while it is more desirable to provide a compact electron lens or electron deflector suitable for integration with the micro field emission gun, in order to fully exploit the advantageous feature of the micro field emission gun that enables a reduction of the column of the electron optical system to several centimeters or less.
    </p>
    <p num="78">FIG. 23 shows the construction of an electrostatic lens or Einzel lens suitable for use in combination with the micro field emission gun of the present invention.</p>
    <p num="79">
      Referring to FIG. 23, the Einzel lens is formed of three annular electrodes 71a, 71b and 71c arranged consecutively and coaxially with respect to the optical axis of the electron beam, wherein a voltage V1 is applied to the electrodes 71a and 71c while a different voltage V2 is applied to the electrode 71b.
      <br/>
      As a result, the iso-potential surface deforms between the electrodes 71a and 71b and between the electrodes 71b and 71c, and the electron beam incident to the Einzel lens experiences a refraction symmetrically with respect to the optical axis.
      <br/>
      Thereby, it is possible to converge or diverge the electron beam as desired by setting the voltages V1 and V2.
    </p>
    <p num="80">FIG. 24 shows the construction of the micro field emission gun that carries such an Einzel lens thereon.</p>
    <p num="81">
      Referring to FIG. 24, the micro field emission gun has a construction shown in FIG. 9, 12 or 22 and includes a substrate 81 carrying thereon an emitter 80, an insulation layer 82 provided on the substrate 81 and having a penetrating hole 82a surrounding the emitter 80, a gate electrode layer 83 provided on the insulation layer 82 and having an opening 83a surrounding the emitter 80 and acting as a passage of the electron beam, and another insulation layer 84 provided on the gate electrode 83 with a thickness of 10-100  MU m and formed with a penetrating hole 84a acting as a passage of the electron beam, wherein the insulation layer 84 carries thereon an acceleration electrode 85 formed with an opening 85a that acts also as a passage of the electron beam.
      <br/>
      On the acceleration electrode 85, it should be noted that there is formed an insulation layer 86 having a penetrating hole 86a acting as a passage of the electron beam, and annular electrodes 71a, 71b and 71c are provided consecutively on the insulation layer 86 with intervening insulation layers 72a and 72b to form the Einzel lens of FIG. 23.
    </p>
    <p num="82">In the Einzel lens provided integrally to the micro-field emission gun, it is necessary to form the openings of the annular electrodes 71a-71c to be in the order of 100  MU m, in correspondence to the 300  MU m pitch of the emitters forming the emitter array on the substrate 81.</p>
    <p num="83">While such annular electrodes having an opening of 100  MU m diameter may be fabricated with precision by employing the microfabrication technology used in the production of semiconductor devices, use of such a microfabrication technology raises a problem in that a substantial leak current may flow through the thin insulation layers 72a and 72b in view of the voltage of about 1 kV applied across the electrodes 71a-71c as the foregoing voltages V1 and V2.</p>
    <p num="84">
      When forming the Einzel lens by bonding insulation slabs to the, electrodes 71a-71c for avoiding the foregoing problem, on the other hand, it is necessary to align the optical axis of the lens by a machining process, while such a machining process has to be achieved with an alignment error of less than 1  MU m. Further, use of adhesives for bonding the insulation slabs upon the electrodes is not preferred in view of the degradation of the high vacuum environment required for the apparatus of the electron gun.
      <br/>
      It should be noted that the electron guns has to be held in the vacuum environment of less than 10-9 Torr pressure.
      <br/>
      Thus, there has been substantial difficulty in providing Einzel lenses integrally to the micro-field emission gun forming an emitter array on a substrate.
    </p>
    <p num="85">FIGS. 25A-25H show the fabrication process of the Einzel lens according to a fourth embodiment of the present invention.</p>
    <p num="86">
      Referring to FIG. 25A, a metal foil 91 of Cr or Ta having a thickness of about 50  MU m is prepared, and an aperture having a diameter of 100  MU m is formed in correspondence to each of the paths of the electron beams emitted from the emitter array of the field emission gun by means of the electrospark machining process with a tolerance of 1  MU m or less.
      <br/>
      In the case of the foregoing embodiments in which the emitters are formed with a pitch of 300  MU m, the apertures 90a are formed also with the pitch of 300  MU m.
    </p>
    <p num="87">
      Next, in the step of FIG. 25B, glass slabs 92 and 92 of a borosilicate glass similar to the one used in the previous embodiments are bonded upon the upper and lower major surfaces of the metal foil 91 by means of the anodic bonding process.
      <br/>
      The anodic bonding process is conducted in the vacuum environment at the temperature of 300 (degree)  C. while applying a d.c. voltage of 300 volts, similarly to the previous embodiments.
      <br/>
      In this anodic bonding process, the metal foil 91 is applied with the positive voltage while the glass slabs 92 and 93 are applied with the negative voltage.
    </p>
    <p num="88">
      Next, in the step of FIG. 25C, a resist layer 93 is formed on the lower major surface of the glass slab 93 and irradiation of ultraviolet light is made upon the lower major surface of the glass slab 93 from the side of the glass slab 92.
      <br/>
      Thereby, the resist layer 94 experiences exposure according to the pattern of the metal foil 91, and the resist layer 94 thus exposed is developed in the step of FIG. 25D. As a result of the development, the resist layer 94 is removed except for a resist pattern 94a corresponding to the aperture 91a, and the lower major surface of the glass slab 93 is exposed except for the resist pattern 94a.
      <br/>
      After the development, a layer 95 of Cr is deposited upon the exposed lower major surface of the glass slab 93 by a vacuum deposition process, and the resist pattern 94a as well as the Cr layer thereon are removed subsequently in the step of FIG. 25E by liftoff.
    </p>
    <p num="89">
      Next, a resist layer 96 is applied upon the upper major surface of the glass slab 92 in the step of FIG. 25F, wherein the layer 96 is exposed by a ultraviolet light from the side of the glass slab 93.
      <br/>
      Thereby, the Cr layer 95 and the metal foil 91 act as the exposure mask.
      <br/>
      After developing the resist layer 96, a Cr layer is deposited on the upper major surface of the glass substrate 92 while using the remaining resist layer 96 as a mask.
      <br/>
      Further, the resist layer 96 is subsequently lifted off together with the Cr layer thereon and one obtains a structure shown in FIG. 25G. Further, the glass slabs 92 and 93 are subjected to an etching process while using the Cr layers 95 and 97 thus formed as a mask, and a structure shown in FIG. 25H is obtained.
      <br/>
      In the structure of FIG. 25H, it should be noted that the metal foil 91 corresponds to the electrode 71b, the Cr layer 95 corresponds to the electrode 71a, and the Cr layer 97 corresponds to the electrode 71c.

    <p num="90">
      In the process of FIGS. 25A-25H wherein the electrodes 95 and 97 experience a self-alignment patterning process, it will be noted that an ideal alignment is achieved for the optical axes of the annular electrodes.
      <br/>
      Further, one can provide a thick insulation layer between the annular electrodes without using adhesives at all.
      <br/>
      Thereby, a precise electrostatic lens is obtained without sacrificing the degree of vacuum, wherein such a lens can be operated without being restrained from the leakage current flowing through the insulation layers.
    </p>
    <p num="91">Next, the mounting process of the Einzel lens fabricated according to the process of FIGS. 25A-25H upon the micro-field emission gun will be described.</p>
    <p num="92">
      Referring to FIG. 26, the jig 31 of FIG. 6 is used for holding the micro-field emission gun 100, wherein the micro field emission gun 100 is constructed on a substrate 101 corresponding to the substrate 21 described before and includes an emitter array (not illustrated) in FIG. 26. The substrate 101 in turn carries an insulator slab 102 corresponding to the insulator slab 22, 51 or 61 described before and an acceleration electrode 103 formed on the insulator slab 102, wherein the electrode 103 corresponds to the electrode 23, 51b or 64 also described previously.

      Thereby, it should be noted that the lens structure 106 carries an alignment aperture 106b at a predetermined position predetermined with respect to the lens 106a.
      <br/>
      Thus, it is possible to achieve an alignment of the lens structure 106 with respect to the micro-field emission gun 100 within the error of 1  MU m by activating the fine adjustment mechanism 42, while observing the alignment of the alignment mark on the field emission gun 100 with respect to the alignment aperture 106b by an optical microscope.

      As the micro-field emission gun of the present embodiment is equipped with the acceleration electrode, it is possible to produce a high energy electron beam by applying an acceleration voltage to the acceleration electrode.
      <br/>
      As the acceleration electrode is provided integrally to the micro-field emission gun, the handling of the field emission gun is substantially facilitated.
    </p>
    <p num="223">
      In the foregoing seventh embodiment of the present invention, it is possible to accelerate the electron beam with a high acceleration voltage.
      <br/>
      Further, the micro-field emission gun is easy to handle and can be fabricated with high efficiency and low cost.
      <br/>
      As the emitter is only partially surrounded by the insulation layer 281, it is possible to evacuate the micro-field emission gun with high efficiency.

    <p num="224">The present embodiment uses a substrate having an exposed rear surface, wherein the substrate is supplied with a d.c. current at the exposed rear surface when carrying out an anodic bonding process.</p>
    <p num="225">a) Fabrication of the Micro Field Emission Gun</p>
    <p num="226">
      FIG. 65 shows a silicon (Si) wafer 330 on which a number of micro-field emission guns 331 are formed, wherein a first alignment mark 332 for aligning the wafers and a second alignment mark 333 used also for aligning the wafers, are provided also on the wafer 330.
      <br/>
      In the illustrated example, the silicon wafer 1 may have a diameter of 3 inches and a thickness of 500  MU m.
    </p>
    <p num="227">
      Each of the micro-field emission guns 331 typically has a size of about 3 mm * 3 mm and includes four emitters 334 disposed on the silicon substrate with a separation of about 500  MU m,, wherein there is a gate electrode 336 on the emitters 334 as indicated in FIG. 66 or FIG. 67, with an insulator layer 335 of SiO provided so as to intervene between the gate electrode 336 and the wafer 330.
      <br/>
      Further, the wafer 331 is formed with an exposed surface 337 for anodic bonding with another substrate.
    </p>
    <p num="228">
      As indicated in FIG. 65, the first alignment mark 332 is formed at a position offset from the center of the silicon wafer 330 by a distance of 30-35 mm, while the second alignment mark 333 is formed at a position offset from the center by a distance of 20-25 mm.
      <br/>
      The alignment marks 332 and 333 may be formed by conducting an exposure simultaneously to the exposure of the micro-field emission guns by using the same exposure mask, followed by a patterning process.
    </p>
    <p num="229">
      In the present embodiment, the exposed silicon surface 337 is formed with a step of about 1.5  MU m step height as will be indicated in FIG. 68, wherein the exposed silicon surface 337 is formed by removing therefrom the SiO2 layer used for the mask or for the insulator layer or the gate electrode.
      <br/>
      Thus, the wafer 330 can be used as an electrode in the anodic bonding process by simply supplying the d.c. current to the rear side of the substrate 330.
    </p>
    <p num="230">Further, the rear surface of the silicon wafer 330 is covered by an aluminum film.</p>
    <p num="231">It should be noted that the gate electrodes 336 of adjacent micro-field emission guns such as the gun 331-1 and the gun 331-2 are connected with each other, while the gate electrodes 336 are so formed that they are disconnected from each other upon scribing of the wafer 130 into individual micro-field emission guns.</p>
    <p num="232">The emitter 334 is by no means limited to Si but other materials such as W, Ni, Au, and the like, may also be used.</p>
    <p num="233">FIG. 68 shows the field emission gun 331 for the part in the vicinity of the exposed silicon surface 337.</p>
    <p num="234">The field emission gun of the present embodiment has a simple construction suited for mass production.</p>
    <p num="235">As the process for forming the insulation glass slab or the acceleration electrode is identical to the process of the sixth and seventh embodiment, further description will be omitted.</p>
    <p num="236">
      FIG. 69 shows a flowchart showing the fabrication process of the micro-field emission gun of the present invention.
      <br/>
      As each of the steps S1-S8 are already explained with reference to the sixth through eighth embodiments, further description thereof will be omitted.
    </p>
    <p num="237">Further, the present invention is not limited to the embodiments described heretofore, but various variations and modifications may be made without departing from the scope of the invention.</p>
