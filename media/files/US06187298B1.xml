      The present invention relates to a cosmetic preparation which has ultraspectral protection or else broad-band protection against solar radiation.

      While about 30 years ago sunlight was regarded as healing and safe because of its ability to synthesize vitamin D, in recent years the attitude in this respect has changed considerably, not only for medical reasons.
      <br/>
      There is increasing awareness of the potential dangers which are associated both with natural and also artificial solar irradiation.
      <br/>
      In particular, there has even been a change in behavior as a result of knowledge about the influence of sunlight on skin aging and the formation of skin cancer.

    <p num="4">As is known, the skin is sensitive to solar rays, which may cause common sunburn or an erythema, but also burns of varying severity.</p>
    <p num="5">
      Solar rays do, however, also have other negative effects: they cause the skin to lose its elasticity and develop wrinkles and thus lead to premature aging.
      <br/>
      Dermatoses are also sometimes observed, and in extreme cases, skin cancer may result.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      On the basis of this knowledge, there have been some developments in sun protection.
      <br/>
      While up to just a few years ago, the principal aim was an erythema-inhibiting UVB protection, protection against UVA radiation is now included in sunscreen formulations.
      <br/>
      UVA radiation is essentially a trigger for pigmenting the skin.
    </p>
    <p num="7">It is also desirable to protect hair against photochemical damage in order to avoid changes in shades, bleaching or damage of a mechanical nature.</p>
    <p num="8">
      As is known, the most dangerous part of solar rays comprises the ultraviolet rays having a wavelength of less than 400 nm.
      <br/>
      It is also known that as a result of the presence of the ozone layer in the Earth's atmosphere, which absorbs some solar radiation, the lower limit of ultraviolet rays which reach the Earth's surface is about 280 nm.
    </p>
    <p num="9">The main aim in the field of sun protection has thus to date actually been to ensure good protection against UVB and UVA radiation.</p>
    <p num="10">
      The wavelength region of sunlight, however, extends not only over the region of UVA and UVB radiation from 280 to 400 nm.
      <br/>
      The region perceptible to the eye extends to 800 nm and is delimited by the transition into the long-wave infrared radiation, which is perceived as thermal radiation.
      <br/>
      At the lower end, the radiation enters the short-wave UV region, also called UVC radiation.
      <br/>
      This is the wavelength region from 100 to 280 nm.
    </p>
    <p num="11">Sunlight in the wavelength region from 400 to 800 nm (VIS region) and above (IR region) can penetrate into the deeper layers of the skin and cause damage there, so that the effect of this light alone may also accelerate skin aging processes.</p>
    <p num="12">An object of the invention was thus to provide cosmetically well-tolerated light protection filters which also offer protection against sunlight in the wavelength region from 400 to 800 nm and in the IR wavelength region above 800 nm.</p>
    <p num="13">In addition, it was desirable to find an effective IR protection filter for the IR wavelength region above 800 nm which is not regarded negatively as a result of severe "whitening" on the skin, as has hitherto been the case.</p>
    <p num="14">
      An object of the invention was also to provide cosmetic formulations which offer protection against the damaging effect of sunlight both in the UV region and also in the long-wave region, the VIS and IR region.
      <br/>
      This means that formulations are to be provided which exhibit complete protection against the entire solar spectrum which reaches the Earth, as happens, for example, through clothing.
      <br/>
      The object was thus to provide cosmetically well-tolerated formulations which offer such broad-band or ultraspectral protection.
    </p>
    <p num="15">The object is achieved by light protection filters effective in the wavelength region from 400 to 800 nm (VIS region) and in the wavelength region above 800 nm (IR region), these being substances which are soluble or insoluble in cosmetic formulations or mixtures of soluble and insoluble substances.</p>
    <p num="16">The invention thus provides light protection filters effective in the wavelength region from 400 to 800 nm (VIS region) and in the infrared wavelength region (IR region) from 800 nm.</p>
    <p num="17">
      According to the invention, such filters may comprise pigments and/or dyes which reflect and/or absorb in the visible wavelength region (VIS reflecting).
      <br/>
      Such pigments may, in particular, be golden, red, orange-, copper- or body-colored interference pigments which resemble very closely the natural color of skin.
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      These interference pigments are preferably platelet-shaped or ground mica having a diameter of up to 15  MU m, which is coated with SnO2 and/or TiO2.
      <br/>
      Interference pigments whose carrier material does not consist of mica are, however, also suitable.
      <br/>
      The coatings may be doped in various ways, such as, for example, by iron or cerium.
    </p>
    <p num="19">In a particular embodiment of these pigments, the mica has a thin coating consisting of up to 18% by weight of SnO2, and a coating consisting of 50-70% by weight, preferably 54-60% by weight, of TiO2 having a rutile structure.</p>
    <p num="20">The light protection filters may also be mica having a thin coating consisting of up to 1% by weight of SnO2, and a coating consisting of 50-70% by weight, preferably 54-60% by weight, of TiO2 having an anatase structure, or mica having a coating consisting of 50-70% by weight, preferably 54-60% by weight, of TiO2 having a rutile or anatase structure.</p>
    <p num="21">Suitable substances which may also be used as VIS and/or as IR filters are pearlizing pigments consisting of mica or other carrier materials which are coated with titanium dioxides or iron oxides; in particular, these are</p>
    <p num="22">
      Silver pigments (mica+TiO2) having particle sizes &lt;200  MU m, in particular &lt;15  MU m, such as, for example, Timiron MP 1005.RTM. or MP 1001.RTM. available commercially, or also coarser fractions
      <br/>
      Interference pigments (mica+TiO2) having particle sizes &lt;200  MU m, in particular having particle sizes of from 5 to 25  MU m, with golden, red, orange-, copper- or body-colored interference, such as, for example, Timiron Silk Red.RTM. or Silk Gold.RTM. or Super Red.RTM. or Super Gold.RTM. or Super Copper.RTM. or coarser fractions or other interference colors and mixtures thereof
      <br/>
      Gold pigments (mica+TiO2 and iron oxides) having particle sizes of &lt;200  MU m, in particular &lt;5-25  MU m or &lt;15  MU m; such a gold pigment is, for example, Timiron MP 20.RTM., but coarser gold pigment fractions are also suitable
      <br/>
      Colored pigments (mica+TiO2 and iron oxides) having particle sizes of &lt;200  MU m, in particular &lt;5-25  MU m or &lt;15  MU m; suitable colored pigments are, for example, Dichrona.RTM. or Microna.RTM. matt.
    </p>
    <p num="23">
      Also suitable are VIS-absorbing or -reflecting fillers, such as, for example, mica coated with TiO2 and/or BaSO4.
      <br/>
      These also include, for example, Biron.RTM. (BiOCl), Low Luster.RTM. or Extender W.RTM., provided they are not 100% transparent.
    </p>
    <p num="24">The invention also provides mixtures of the pigments, pearlizing pigments, VIS-reflecting absorbing fillers or dyes given above and below as light protection filters according to the invention.</p>
    <p num="25">
      Normally used as UV filters, microfine ZnO and TiO2 particles are also suitable as such, provided they also reflect or absorb in the VIS region.
      <br/>
      These are available commercially under the names Hombitec.RTM. or Sachotec.RTM., Kemira M160.RTM., Tioveil AQ.RTM. and, to a limited extent, Eusolex T-2000.RTM., limited since it has very high transparency.
    </p>
    <p num="26">
      Suitable VIS filters can also be dyes approved in cosmetics, for example chosen from the "Blaue Liste" (Blue List) (list of dyes permitted in cosmetics)�"Blaue Liste" (Blue List) edition Cantor Verlag, editor H. P. Fiedler (1993)�, which can be used either as they are or else in a mixture.
      <br/>
      These dyes can also be used as undissolved pigments.
      <br/>
      Those which are particularly suitable here are the red, yellow and blue dyes, which individually or in a mixture with the other additives give formulations which, when applied to the skin, have a natural color.
      <br/>
      It is thus also possible to use dyes from this list having colors other than those mentioned, such as, for example, orange or gold.
    </p>
    <p num="27">
      Preferred red dyes are those with the names D&amp;C Red, preferably with the numbers No. 10, C.I. 15630, No. 7, C.I. 15850 and No. 21, C.I. 45380, Acid Red, preferably Acid Red No. 1, C.I. 18050, Allura Red, trans-alpha-, beta- or gamma-carotene and Pigment Red.
      <br/>
      Yellow dyes in this respect are those with the names Acid Yellow, preferably Acid Yellow No. 1, C.I. 10316, tartrazine, C.I. 19140, rutin, D&amp;C Yellow No. 7, C.I. 45350, Disperse Yellow, Food Yellow, Natural Yellow, Pigment Yellow and Solvent Yellow.
    </p>
    <p num="28">Suitable blue dyes are Acid Blue, preferably Acid Blue No. 9, C.I. 42090, Acid Blue No. 80, C.I. 61585, D&amp;C Blue No. 6, C.I. 73000, C-Blue 21 and Direct Blue 86.</p>
    <p num="29">As well as the dyes listed in the given list, other VIS-absorbing substances are also suitable, such as, for example, flavonoids or natural or artificial melanin.</p>
    <p num="30">In addition, the VIS filters may, in addition to their protective effect in the VIS region, also have a protective effect in the UV or IR region.</p>
    <p num="31">
      Protection of the skin against IR radiation is also sensible and important since IR radiation in sunlight contributes significantly to warming.
      <br/>
      This heat in turn is synergistic in the development of erythema caused by UV, i.e. it promotes the development of sunburn.
    </p>
    <p num="32">
      In this connection, suitable IR protection filters are basically many substances described for the VIS region, in particular the interference pigments, which are effective in the longer-wave region.
      <br/>
      The transition between the VIS and the IR region is often smooth.
    </p>
    <p num="33">
      Pigments reflecting in the IR region are thus preferably used.
      <br/>
      However, the severe "whitening" on the skin is often considered to be in need of improvement.
      <br/>
      The object of this invention was achieved by the provision of a novel interference pigment effective in the IR wavelength region.
    </p>
    <p num="34">The invention thus also provides an interference pigment for IR protection, characterized in that the pigment has a white body color and a yellowish, copper- or skin-colored interference color.</p>
    <p num="35">This interference pigment consists of platelet-shaped or ground mica which is coated with TiO2 of varying layer thicknesses and which in addition may also be doped with iron or cerium.</p>
    <p num="36">
      The novel interference pigments have shades in the range copper-colored, yellowish and skin-colored-pink.
      <br/>
      To describe the colors better, the shades can also be defined by codes from the "Pantone Color Formula Guide 1000", which are known to the person skilled in the art.
      <br/>
      The following shades are particularly preferred according to the invention: 726C, 489U, 489C, 712C, 155U, 719U, 1205U and also 1205C.
      <br/>
      This list is merely to be regarded as a descriptive disclosure which is in no way limiting.
    </p>
    <p num="37">
      Surprisingly, the novel pigments have a white body color, i.e. the formulations are white, but then on the skin, a copper- or skin-pink-colored interference color appears, as desired.
      <br/>
      There is no undesired "whitening" here.
    </p>
    <p num="38">
      The novel interference pigments are prepared by the generally known methods for the continuous build up of layers of Ti(OH)4 on mica particles (described, for example, in documents U.S. Pat. No. 4,038,099, DE-C 25 22 572 and also EP 0 271 767 B1).
      <br/>
      The process is then stopped at the desired interference color.
    </p>
    <p num="39">
      The particle size is very important for the effectiveness.
      <br/>
      A very particularly preferred particle size is from 5 to 25  MU m since this permits an optimum protective effect against IR radiation to be achieved.
    </p>
    <p num="40">If the particle size is chosen to be less than about 15  MU m, then this interference pigment can also be highly suitable for the VIS region.</p>
    <p num="41">The interference pigments for the VIS region can also be prepared, for example, by the processes described in the cited documents.</p>
    <p num="42">
      According to the invention, the VIS and IR light protection filters can in each case be used separately or, of course, also in combination, which is preferable, in cosmetic formulations such as sun-screens, skin creams, skin gels, hair gels or cosmetic sticks.
      <br/>
      In this respect, they may be used in combination either with inorganic or else with organic UVA and UVB filters or mixtures thereof.
    </p>
    <p num="43">
      The novel filters for protection against VIS and IR radiation can in each case be incorporated into cosmetic formulations in concentrations from 0.5 to 20% by weight, preferably from 3 to 10% by weight.
      <br/>
      In this way, it is possible to prepare formulations in which up to 100% of the light protection filters used are novel VIS and/or IR filters.
      <br/>
      These are substances which are easily dissolved in, dispersed in or emulsified with water and oils.
    </p>
    <p num="44">The novel light protection filters can be incorporated directly into cosmetic formulations without further preparative measures.</p>
    <p num="45">These substances also offer the great advantage that they do not exhibit any toxic or allergic reactions towards the skin.</p>
    <p num="46">These cosmetic formulations exhibit significantly improved protection against the damaging effects of solar rays.</p>
    <p num="47">Since recent trends have been towards providing protection against UVB, UVA and also against VIS or IR radiation, i.e. achieving complete protection against the entire solar spectrum which reaches the Earth, as happens, for example, through clothing, the object of the invention was also to provide cosmetically well-tolerated formulations which offer such broad-band or ultraspectral protection.</p>
    <p num="48">The object is achieved by the combination of organic and/or inorganic UV filters, VIS and IR filters.</p>
    <p num="49">According to the invention, cosmetic formulations are thus provided which comprise light protection filters effective in the wavelength region from 280 to 400 nm (UV filters), in the wavelength region from 400 to 800 nm (VIS filters) and in the longer-wave region above 800 nm (IR filters), and thus offer hyper-protection against the sun.</p>
    <p num="50">A method for protecting the skin against solar rays, which comprises applying a novel cosmetic preparation to the skin, is likewise provided by the invention.</p>
    <p num="51">The novel formulations can either exclusively comprise inorganic light protection filters or else combinations of organic and inorganic light protection filters.</p>
    <p num="52">The content of UV, VIS and IR filters in the cosmetic formulations can in each case be between 0.5 and 20% by weight, preferably between 3 and 10% by weight.</p>
    <p num="53">The VIS and/or IR filters used are preferably the novel light protection filters described in detail in this document.</p>
    <p num="54">
      Suitable UV filters are inorganic and organic light protection filters.
      <br/>
      Inorganic UV filters which may be used are UV filters generally known to the person skilled in the art, such as, for example, those from the group consisting of titanium dioxide and zinc oxide.
      <br/>
      Available commercially is also, for example, Eusolex.RTM. T-2000 (Merck KGaA, Darmstadt), a micronized titanium dioxide.
    </p>
    <p num="55">These inorganic UV filters are usually incorporated into cosmetic formulations in an amount of from 0.5 to 20% by weight, preferably 2-10%.</p>
    <p num="56">
      Suitable organic UV filters are all UVA and UVB filters known to the person skilled in the art.
      <br/>
      For both UV ranges, there are many tried and tested substances known from specialist literature, it being possible to list here, for example, only substances such as benzylidenecamphor derivatives (e.g. Eusolex.RTM. 6300) or phenylbenzimidazole-5-sulfonic acid (Eusolex.RTM. 232), benzoyl- or dibenzoylmethane such as Eusolex.RTM. 9020 or Eusolex.RTM. 8020, benzophenones (Eusolex.RTM. 4360), methoxycinnamate (e.g. Eusolex.RTM. 2292), salicylate derivatives (e.g. Eusolex.RTM. OS), octocrylene (Eusolex.RTM. OCR), 4-amino-benzoic acid (PABA), homosalicylate (HMS) and also octyltriazone (Uvinol.RTM. T 150).
    </p>
    <p num="57">These organic UV filters are usually incorporated into cosmetic formulations in an amount of from 0.5 to 10% by weight, preferably 1-8% by weight, particularly preferably from 3 to 6% by weight.</p>
    <p num="58">The various light protection filters can be directly combined in all possible variants and incorporated into cosmetic formulations.</p>
    <p num="59">Preferred embodiments of the invention comprise, for example, the following combinations: pigments for VIS protection (3-5% by weight), IR filters (3-5% by weight) and organic UV filters (5-10% by weight); VIS filters (3-5% by weight), IR filters (3-5% by weight) and inorganic and organic UV filters (5-20% by weight).</p>
    <p num="60">
      These are substances which can be easily dissolved in, dispersed in or emulsified with water and oils.
      <br/>
      They disperse uniformly in traditional cosmetic carriers and are able, particularly in fatty carriers, to form a continuous film.
      <br/>
      In this manner, they can be applied to the skin in order to form an effective protective film.
    </p>
    <p num="61">The novel formulations have total protection against solar irradiation and also a lasting protective effect.</p>
    <p num="62">The novel VIS and IR filters exhibit high chemical stability, i.e. they do not undergo hydrolysis, photooxidation or oxidation, have high thermal stability and high resistance to sweat.</p>
    <p num="63">The novel VIS and IR filters can be used to prepare cosmetic preparations which have a protective action and absorb radiation in a significantly broader wavelength range.</p>
    <p num="64">If desired, the novel sunscreens may also comprise one or more chemical substances having self-tanning properties.</p>
    <p num="65">
      Chemical substances having self-tanning properties which may be used are all natural and synthetic substances known to the person skilled in the art which are suitable for the preparation of cosmetic formulations.
