    <p num="2">
      1.
      <br/>
      Field of the Invention
    </p>
    <p num="3">This invention relates to compounds, to processes of their preparation, to pharmaceutical compositions containing them and to their medical use as agonists at kappa opioid receptors.</p>
    <p num="4">
      The present invention also relates to compositions and method for the treatment and/or prevention of itch, also known as pruritus, which has many causes.
      <br/>
      The compositions, which are formulated for topical and systemic administration, contain kappa opiate receptor agonists that are substantially devoid of central nervous system effects, and, thus, have very little, if any potential for producing side effects associated with centrally acting kappa opiate receptor agonists.
    </p>
    <p num="5">2. Reported Developments</p>
    <p num="6">A) Kappa ( KAPPA )-receptor Agonists as Analgesics</p>
    <p num="7">Opium and its derivatives are potent analgesics that also have other pharmacological effects, and exert their effects by interacting with high-affinity receptors.</p>
    <p num="8">
      It has been shown by investigators that there are at least three major opioid receptor types in the central nervous system (hereinafter CNS) and in the periphery.
      <br/>
      These receptors, known as mu ( MU ), delta ( DELTA ) and kappa ( KAPPA ), have distinct pharmacological profiles, anatomical distributions and functions. �See, for example: Wood, P. L., Neuropharmacology, 21, 487-497, 1982; Simon, E., J. Med. Res. Rev., 11, 357-374, 1991; Lutz et al., J. Recept. Res. 12, 267-286; and Mansour et al., Opioid I, ed.
      <br/>
      Herz,. A. (Springer, Berlin) pp. 79-106, 1993.� The  DELTA  receptors are abundant in CNS and mediate analgesia, gastrointestinal motility and various hormonal functions.
      <br/>
      The  MU  receptors bind morphine-like drugs and mediate the opiate phenomena associated with morphine, including analgesia, opiate dependence, cardiovascular and respiratory functions, and several neuroendocrine effects.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      The  KAPPA  receptors have a wide distribution in CNS and mediate a spectrum of functions including the modulation of drinking, water balance, food intake, gut motility, temperature control and various endocrine functions.
      <br/>
      They also produce analgesia. �See, for example: Leander et al., J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 234, 463-469, 1985; Morley et al., Peptides 4, 797-800, 1983; Manzanares et al., Neuroendocrinology 52, 200-205, 1990; and Iyengar et al., J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther., 238, 429-436, 1986.�
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      Most clinically used opioid analgesics such as morphine and codeine act as  MU  receptor agonists.
      <br/>
      These opioids have well-known, undesirable and potentially dangerous dependence forming side effects.
      <br/>
      Compounds which are  KAPPA -receptor agonists act as analgesics through interaction with  KAPPA  opioid receptors.
      <br/>
      The advantage of these agonists over the classical  MU  receptor agonists, such as morphine, lies in their ability to cause analgesia while being devoid of morphine-like behavioral effects and addiction liability.
    </p>
    <p num="11">A large number of classes of compounds which act as agonists at  KAPPA  opioid receptors have been described in the art including the following illustrative classes of compounds.</p>

    <p num="20">B) Kappa ( KAPPA )-receptor Agonists as Anti-Pruritic Agents</p>
    <p num="21">The prior art has investigated the physiology and treatment of pruritus as illustrated hereunder.</p>
    <p num="22">
      Itch is a well known sensory state associated with the desire to scratch.
      <br/>
      As with pain, itch can be produced by a variety of chemical, mechanical, thermal or electrical stimuli.
      <br/>
      In addition to the difference in the sensory quality of itch and pain, they also differ in that (1) itch, unlike pain, can only be evoked from the superficial layers of skin, mucosa, and conjunctiva, and (2) itch and pain usually do not occur simultaneously from the same skin region; in fact, mildly painful stimuli, such as scratching, are effective in eliminating itch.
      <br/>
      In addition, the application of histamine to skin produces itch but not pain.
      <br/>
      Itch and pain are further dissociated pharmacologically: itch appears to be insensitive to opiate and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) treatment, both of which are effective in treating pain.
    </p>
    <p num="23">
      Although itch and pain are of a class in that both are modalities of nociception transmitted by small unmyelinated C fibers, evidence that itch is not just a variety of low-threshold pain is overwhelming.
      <br/>
      Itch leads to the reflex or urge to scratch; pain leads to withdrawal.
      <br/>
      Itch occurs only in the skin; pain arises from deeper structures as well.
      <br/>
      Heat may stop pain but usually increases pain.
      <br/>
      Removal of the epidermis eliminates itch but causes pain.
      <br/>
      Analgesics, particularly opioids, relieve pain but often cause itch (see, for example J. Am. Acad. Derm. 24: 309-310, 1991).
      <br/>
      There can be no doubt that itching is of eminent clinical importance; many systemic and skin diseases are accompanied by persistent or recurrent itch attacks.
      <br/>
      Current knowledge suggests that itch has several features in common with pain but exhibits intriguing differences as well (see, for example, W. Magerl, IASP Newsletter, pp. 4-7, September/October 1996).

      Experimental focal itch stimuli are surrounded by a halo of seemingly unaffected tissue where light tactile stimuli are capable of eliciting itch-like sensations.
      <br/>
      The term itchy skin or alloknesis has been coined for these secondary sensations that are reminiscent of the features of secondary hyperalgesia evolving around a painful focus.
      <br/>
      A crucial observation is that itch and pain usually do not coexist in the same skin region and a mild noxious stimulus such as scratching is in fact the singly most effective way to abolish itch.
      <br/>
      This abolition of itch can be prolonged producing an `antipruritic state`. Although mild scratch is often not painful, microneurographic recordings from humans have directly determined that such stimuli are among the most effective ways to excite cutaneous unmyelinated nociceptive afferents.

    </p>
    <p num="39">
      Physiologically, there is evidence that substance P released from nociceptor terminals can cause the release of histamine from mast cells.
      <br/>
      Activation of mast cells, with release of the pruritogen histamine, occurs in immediate type hypersensitivity diseases, such as anaphylactic reactions and urticaria.
      <br/>
      Urticarial eruptions are distinctly pruritic and can involve any portion of the body, and have a variety of causes beyond hypersensitivity, including physical stimuli such as cold, solar radiation, exercise and mechanical irritation.
      <br/>
      Other causes of pruritus include: chiggers, the larval form of which secretes substance that creates a red papule that itches intensely; secondary hyperparathyroidism associated with chronic renal failure; cutaneous larva migrans, caused by burrowing larvae of animal hookworms; dermal myiasis, caused by maggots of the horse botfly, which can afflict horseback riders; onchocerciasis ("river blindness") caused by filarial nematodes; pediculosis, caused by lice infestations; enterobiasis (pinworm) infestations, which afflict about 40 million Americans, particularly school children; schistosome dermatitis (swimmer's itch); and asteatotic eczema ("winter itch").
      <br/>
      The role of histamine or other endogenous pruritogens in mediating itch associated with these and other pruritic conditions, such as atopic dermatitis, it is not yet well established.
      <br/>
      For atopic dermatitis, in particular, it appears that itch is not inhibited by antihistamines, but by cyclosporin A, a drug which inhibits the production of cytokines which have been proposed as potential pruritogens.
    </p>
    <p num="40">
      Current therapies for the treatment of itch include a variety of topical and systemic agents, such as steroids, antihistamines, and some psychotherapeutic tricyclic compounds, such as doxepin hydrochloride.
      <br/>
      Many such agents are listed in PDR Generics (see Second Edition, 1996, p. cv for a listing of said agents).
      <br/>
      The limitations of these agents are well known to medical practitioners, and are summarized in the "Warnings" and "Precautions" sections for the individual agents listed in PDR Generics.
      <br/>
      In particular, the lack of complete efficacy of antihistamines is well known, but antihistamines are frequently used in dermatology to treat pruritus due to urticaria, atopic dermatitis, contact dermatitis, psoriasis, and a variety of other conditions.
      <br/>
      Although sedation has been a frequent side effect of conventional systemically administered antihistamines, a new generation of antihistamines have been developed that are nonsedating, apparently due to their inability to cross the blood-brain barrier.
    </p>
    <p num="41">
      Intravenous administration of opiate analgesics, such as morphine and hydromorphone has been associated with pruritus, urticaria, other skin rashes, wheal and flare over the vein being injected.
      <br/>
      These itch and itch-related reactions are believed to be due to a histamine-releasing property of these opiates, via mast cell degranulation.
      <br/>
      These opiates are thought to act upon the mu subtype of opiate receptor, but the possibility of interactions at the other principal opiate receptor subtypes (delta and kappa) cannot be excluded since these and other pruritogenic analgesics are not pure mu agonists.
      <br/>
      The cellular loci of the receptor type(s) mediating the itching effect is not known, although the mast cell is a possible candidate since opiates cause histamine release from these cells.
      <br/>
      However, some investigators have suggested that the frequent inability of antihistamines to block morphine-induced itching suggests a non-histaminergic mediation of opiate-induced itching--a mechanism which could involve central opiate receptors.
      <br/>
      Although i.v. morphine only occasionally results in generalized itching (in about 1% of patients), pruritus is more prevalent in opiate analgesia with epidural (8.5%) or intraspinal (45.8%) administration. (See, for example: Bernstein et al., "Antipruritic Effect of an Opiate Antagonist, Naloxone Hydrochloride", The Journal of Investigative Dermatology, 78:82-83, 1982; and Ballantyne et al., "Itching after epidural and spinal opiates", Pain, 33: 149-160, 1988.)
    </p>
    <p num="42">
      To date, treatment with opiates has not only proven useless in the treatment of itch, but appears to exacerbate itch in man.
      <br/>
      The consistent findings form human studies indicate that whether by central or peripheral mechanisms, opiates appear to promote rather than prevent itching, and that opiate antagonists have anti-pruritic activity.
    </p>
    <p num="43">Human clinical studies have generally shown that opiates cause itching and there is evidence that these effects can be reproduced in animal models, where itching sensations per se cannot be reported, but scratching behavior can be observed. (See, for example: Thomas et al., "Microinjection of morphine into the rat medullary dorsal horn produces a dose-dependent increase in facial-scratching", Brain Research, 195: 267-270, 1996; Thomas et al., "Effects of central administration of opioids on facial scratching in monkeys", Brain Res., 585: 315-317, 1992; and Thomas et al., "The medullary dorsal horn: A site of action of opioids in producing facial scratching in monkeys", Anesthesiology, 79: 548-554, 1993).</p>
    <p num="44">We have now surprisingly discovered that kappa agonist compounds, which are substantially devoid of central nervous system effects, in pharmaceutically acceptable vehicles for systemic and topical formulations possess anti-pruritic activity in addition to anti-hyperalgesic activity.</p>

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="62">
      Peripherally-acting  KAPPA  agonists can be prepared by the attachment of polar groups to non-peptide  KAPPA  opioid receptor selective agonists, such as the arylacetamides.
      <br/>
      In designing the peripherally-acting ligands, the introduction of the polar groups may result in either retention or enhancement of antinociceptive potency and selectivity and also may increase the polarity of the ligand sufficient to reduce or eliminate CNS penetration across the blood-brain barrier (BBB).
      <br/>
      Thus, the identity and the positioning of the polar group(s) are important.
    </p>
    <p num="63">
      Using the prototypic arylacetamide, U50,488, as an example, the arylacetamide pharmacophore can be divided into three regions: the aromatic region, the central region, and the amine region.
      <br/>
      All three regions represent potential positions for the attachment of polar groups.  (Chemical Structure image '12' not included in text)

    <p num="64">Compounds of formula (I) of the present invention are made as follows.</p>
    <p num="65">
      A series of novel compounds were made based on the class of arylacetamides reported by Glaxo (J.
      <br/>
      Med. Chem. 1993, 36, 2075).
      <br/>
      Specifically, compound 1 can be deprotected to yield intermediate 2, which can be derivatized by the attachment of a variety of polar groups (Scheme 1).  (Chemical Structure image '13' not included in text)
    </p>
    <p num="66">
      The 3'-substituted series can be prepared via Scheme 2.
      <br/>
      The reduction of the Schiff base intermediate formed during the cyclization to 6 is expected to be stereoselective due to the directing effect of the neighboring hydroxymethyl group.
      <br/>
      Both intermediates 11 and 12 can be derivatized to confer peripheral selectivity.
    </p>
    <p num="67">
      The 5'-substituted series can be prepared via Schemes 3 and 4.
      <br/>
      Starting from N-t-Boc-O-MEM-D-serine, the 5'-(S) series can be prepared, and starting from N-t-Boc-O-MEM-L-serine allows the preparation of the 5'-(R) series.  (Chemical Structure image '14' not included in text)

(1993) Pain 55: 5-54�. During the course of knee joint inflammation, a cascade of events occurs, which includes: (i) synthesis and release of inflammatory mediators in the joint, (ii) release of neuropeptides from afferent fibers in the joint cavity, and (iii) increased primary afferent outflow from group II, III and IV sensory fibers �Schaible et al.. (1993) Pain 55: 5"54�. An important result of this cascade is that there is an augmentation in the response of small, lightly myelinated and unmyelinated afferents to low intensity stimuli.

      In this manner, the peripheral nerve innervating inflamed tissue can evoke an exaggerated behavioral response to otherwise innocuous stimuli, i.e., a state of hyperalgesia.
      <br/>
      Thus, inflammation of the knee joint will result in increased spontaneous afferent activity, the appearance of an exaggerated discharge with joint flexion and extension �Schaible et al.. (1995) J. Neurophysiol. 54: 1109-1122� and signs of a pain-associated autonomic reaction �Sata et al. (1984) Neurosci.
      <br/>
      Lett. 52: 55-60�.

    <p num="631">
      Injection of a mixture of kaolin and carrageenan into the knee joint induces an experimental arthritis.
      <br/>
      As exemplified below, this treatment was characterized by a reliable increase in joint volume and circumference.
      <br/>
      In the unanesthetized rat, these joint changes were accompanied by a tendency to avoid weight bearing, suggesting an ongoing pain state.
      <br/>
      According to electrophysiological studies, in the course of the development of this acute arthritis, C and A DELTA  units normally responding only to extreme joint distortion become activated by slight movement �Schaible et al. (1985) J. Neurophysiol. 54: 1109-1122�. Spinal neurons with knee joint receptive fields in the deep dorsal horn of the spinal cord show clear development of hyperexcitability with the acute inflammation in the joint �Neugebauer et al.. (1993) J. Neurosci. 70: 1365-1377�. This sensitization of group III and IV fibers was observed within 2-3 hours after injection of kaolin and carrageenan into the knee joint, a time course that closely matches the time course of the development of hyperalgesia in the rat knee joint compression model.
      <br/>
      These observations indicate that spinal cord neurons and joint primary afferent fibers become sensitized and may underlie hyperalgesia observed in this arthritic state.
      <br/>
      Such afferent input may drive autonomic responses that are typically associated with the processing of input from afferents typically activated by stimuli generated by the local inflammatory state.
      <br/>
      In addition to the above-mentioned inflamed knee joint mechanism, the blood pressure (BP) changes might also be evoked reflexively by afferent neural activity from receptors located in the skeletal muscle �Williamson et al.. (1994) J. Physiol. 475: 351-357�. This response is dependent on the changes in intramuscular pressure and the quality of muscle mass compressed.
      <br/>
      This particular mechanical reflex, however, appears to operate independently of the pain response and appears to play a minor role in the exemplified experiments, as inflation of the cuff on the left normal knee joint had no effect upon BP.
      <br/>
      In any case, it is possible that overflow of the carrageenan from the joint capsule may serve to render surrounding tissue inflamed as well.
      <br/>
      Sensitization of C and A units was observed in the rat gastrocnemius muscle by infiltration with carrageenan �Handwerker et al. (1991) Pain and Inflammation, Proceeding of the VIth World Congress on Pain, Bond et al. eds., Elsevier Science Publishers BV, pp. 59-70�. Based on these considerations, it appears that compression of the inflamed knee joint yields a noxious stimulus and this in turn activates a sympathetic response resulting in an increase in BP.
    </p>
    <p num="632">
      Local inflammation of the knee results in a state where otherwise innocuous stimuli results in a prominent autonomic response, including increased blood pressure (BP) and heart rate �see, e.g., Sata et al. (1984) Neurosci.
      <br/>
      Lett. 52: 55-60�. Alternatively, neural outflow from the inflamed knee is recorded �see, e.g. Neugebauer et al. (1993) J. Neurosci. 70: 1365-1377�.
    </p>
    <p num="633">An in vitro test that measures spontaneous discharge in injured skin by topical application may also be used. �see, e.g., Andreev et al.. (1994) Neurosci. 58: 793-798�.</p>
    <p num="634">(c) In vivo evaluation of formalin-induced nociception</p>
    <p num="635">
      Administration of formalin into the paw results in a localized inflammation and a pain response that is moderate in intensity and continuous in duration.
      <br/>
      Unlike many other assays of nociception, the formalin assay measures tonic pain that is a result of tissue injury, and therefore is a model which is more relevant to clinical pain states in humans �see Tjolsen et al.. (1992) Pain 51: 5-17�. In the rat the response to formalin-induced pain consists of spontaneous flinching behavior, characterized by paw lifting and paw shaking, and a rapid vibration of the paw after drawing it under the body.
      <br/>
      The flinching response can be reliably quantitated and exhibits two peaks of activity which are indicative of acute and tonic pain �Wheeler-Aceto and Cowan (1991) Psychopharmacology 104: 35-44�. The early or acute phase lasts from 0-5 min post-formalin and is followed by a quiescent period lasting approximately 15 min.
      <br/>
      The tonic phase occurs from 20-35 min following formalin injection and is the interval where the number of flinching responses is maximal.
      <br/>
      This model has been characterized in several species �Tjolsen et al.. (1992) Pain 51: 5-17� and is sensitive to the analgesic effects of opiates administered by a variety of routes, including local administration directly into the paw.
      <br/>
      In addition, the test is particularly sensitive to the effects of  KAPPA  agonists �Wheeler-Aceto and Cowan (1991) Psychopharmacology 104: 35-44�.
    </p>
    <p num="636">
      Inflammation is induced by subcutaneous injection of 50  MU l of a 5% formalin solution into the dorsal surface of the right hind paw of male Sprague-Dawley rats weighing 70-90 g. Injections of drug are given into the dorsal surface of the paw prior to formalin injection, and flinching behavior is quantitated by counting the number of responses that occur during the tonic phase of pain, lasting from 20-35 min after formalin injection.
      <br/>
      Results are expressed as the mean percent antagonism of formalin-induced flinching calculated for individual drug-treated, formalin-injected rats using the following formula:  (Equation image '1' not included in text)

      In this protocol, modified Freund's adjuvant is used as the inflammatory stimulus, and the paw pressure test is used to assess the response of the rat to a painful pressure stimulus.

      Baseline responding is established by determining the average of three consecutive trials separated by 10 sec.
      <br/>
      The same procedure is conducted on the contralateral side and the sequence of sides is alternated between animals to control for order effects.
      <br/>
      Typically injections are not made in the contralateral (noninflamed) paw; however, in selected cases drugs may be administered to the contralateral paw to evaluate the potential for drug effects in the absence of inflammation.

    <p num="649">(f) Hyperalgesia induced by tape stripping</p>
    <p num="650">
      The objective of this assay is to identify novel agents which exhibit peripherally-mediated analgesia in circumstances, such as burns and abrasions, which lead to hyperalgesia.
      <br/>
      In such injuries, the loss of the stratum corneum is followed by an inflammatory response (erythema) and a painful response to otherwise innocuous stimuli.
      <br/>
      Removal of the stratum corneum by repeated application and removal of cellophane tape, termed tape stripping, has been shown to be a simplified model of these injuries, which share characteristics of first degree burns �see Flynn (1985) Percutaneous Absorption, R. L. Bronaugh and H. I. Maibach, eds., Marcel Dekker Inc., pp. 18-42�. This method of barrier disruption avoids the application of potentially toxic chemicals and permits evaluation of peripheral analgesics following topical administration because tape stripping removes the barrier to effective topical therapy (the stratum corneum) while simultaneously resulting in inflammation and hyperalgesia.
      <br/>
      Tape stripping has been validated in humans as a model for the testing of topical agents �Pershing et al. (1994) Antimicrob.

      After anesthesia of the rat with ketamine-xylamine, a 1-3 cm2 patch of rat skin is treated by repeated application and removal of tape.
      <br/>
      This procedure results in removal of the stratum corneum as determined by a glistening appearance of the skin.
      <br/>
      The tape stripped skin is evaluated for a visible erythema and for sensitivity to contact by heat or pressure stimuli using a focused beam of light, by testing in the paw pressure apparatus or by touch with von Frey hairs.
      <br/>
      The diameter of the von Frey hairs will be selected based on a diameter which causes no response in control rats but has a readily detectable response in treated rats.

    <p num="659">Assessment and Testing of Anti-pruritic Activity</p>
    <p num="660">The formulations of the present invention for anti-pruritic activity were tested as follows.</p>
    <heading>TESTING FOR ANTI-PRURITIC ACTIVITY</heading>
    <p num="661">Testing was performed in a mouse scratch model under blind conditions.</p>
    <p num="662">
      Groups of 8-10 male Swiss albino mice (Hilltop Lab Animals, Inc., Scottsdale, Pa.), weighing 2.5-2.6 g, were used in the testing.
      <br/>
      They were housed under controlled temperature of 23"25 (degree)  C. Food and water were freely available.
      <br/>
      Before the experiments, the mice were weighed, put into individual boxes and allowed to acclimate for 30 min.
    </p>
    <p num="663">Materials</p>
    <p num="664">Vehicle used to dissolve the test compounds: 20% v/v cremaphor EL.</p>
    <p num="665">To induce scratching Compound 48/80 (Sigma, St. Louis, USA) was used which has been shown to produce an itch sensation in humans (Armstrong et al.., J Physiol., 120: 326, 1953).</p>
    <p num="666">The compounds to be tested for anti-pruritic activity were dissolved in the vehicle of 20% v/v cremaphor EL.</p>
    <p num="667">Method</p>
    <p num="668">
      100  MU l of the vehicle (3-5 doses, n=8-10) was injected s.c. into the back of the neck of mice 20 min before challenging them with 100  MU l of Compound 48/80 (2 mg/ml; 50  MU g) injected s.c. into the back of the neck.
      <br/>
      One minute later the mice were observed for 30 min. and the number of hindleg scratching movements directed to the neck was counted.
    </p>
    <p num="669">The vehicle-injected mice scratched 79 +- 16 times in the 30 min after the standard challenge with Compound 48/80.</p>
    <p num="670">
      To each mouse of a group of 8-10 mice previously subjected to the standard challenge, various doses of the compounds to be tested for anti-pruritic activity were administered s.c. into the back of the neck.
      <br/>
      One minute later the mice were observed for 30 min and the number of hindleg scratching movements directed to the neck was counted.
    </p>
    <p num="671">
      For each group of 8-10 mice, the mean values for scratching were normalized to relative % antagonism of scratching and then plotted vs. dose of test compounds.
      <br/>
      Interval estimates of mean A50 were determined by nonlinear regression analysis (Kaleidagraph) and mean % inhibition of scratching was calculated.
    </p>
    <p num="672">Compounds tested have shown dose-dependent anti-pruritic activity in the range of from about 15 to about 95% based on doses of from about 0.5 to 10.0 mg/kg, s.c.</p>
