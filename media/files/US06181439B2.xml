    <heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">The present invention relates to printing and graphic arts generally and more particularly to apparatus for page composition and printing and apparatus for printing control.</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="3">
      The production of a book or magazine involves a large number of processes.
      <br/>
      The processes may be grouped into five general categories: prepress, plate preparation, press set up or "make ready"; press control operations; and postpress operations.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      In prepress, the principal processes are graphics, image and text editing and composition.
      <br/>
      In recent years, this area has undergone revolutionary changes through application of computer technology.
      <br/>
      State of the art systems for graphics and image editing and composition, as well as the specific functions of scanning, image processing and plotting include systems manufactured and sold by Scitex Corporation Ltd., Herzlia, Israel, such as, respectively, the systems sold under the trademarks Smart Scanner, Assembler and Raystar.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      Plate preparation involves a technique known as imposition or signature assembly, which refers to the arrangement of pages on a film used to produce a printing plate.
      <br/>
      The present state of the art in signature assembly is the use of large and expensive machinery requiring highly skilled operators.
      <br/>
      Presently available signature assembly machinery involves the following steps: exposure of each of a plurality of separations (such as C, M, Y and K) for each of a plurality of pages to be arranged on a single plate; and subsequently, for each separation, such as C, feeding the exposed plurality of pages to an expose and repeat device such as the Misomex Master S Series, commercially available from Misomex North America Inc., Rosemont, Ill.
      <br/>
      The expose and repeat device is operative to arrange the plurality of exposed C separations, corresponding to the plurality of pages to be arranged on a single plate, at precisely determined positions on a film and to reproduce the C separations at the precisely determined positions by a photographic process.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      The C printing plate is produced by contact exposure of the film.
      <br/>
      The signature is proofed prior to exposure of the plate.
      <br/>
      The plate, once exposed, is often found to be imperfect and therefore generally requires quality inspection and defect repair processes.
      <br/>
      The plate preparation process is repeated in order to produce M, Y and K plates.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      Press set-up or "make-ready" takes place after preparation of the printing plate, and involves scanning of each printing plate to obtain information necessary for press set-up.
      <br/>
      This information includes the variation of the dot percentage over each plate, which determines the required ink flow for that plate.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      Press control involves adjustments to the printing press which are normally made by a pressman examining the printed output from the press or by automatic press control systems such as the SPM 700, commercially available from Gretag Data and Image Systems, CH-Regensdorf, Switzerland.
      <br/>
      Automatic press control systems are operative to scan the printed output from the press compare it to a reference, such as a signature proof, and make suitable adjustments to the printing press.
      <br/>
      Post press processes include the folding, cutting and binding of the press output.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      A great number of patents exist in the area of prepress.
      <br/>
      These include co-assigned U.S. Pat. No. 4,456,924 which describes method and apparatus for screen generation, co-assigned U.S. Pat. No. 4,853,709 which describes an internal drum laser plotter, and co-assigned U.S. patent application Ser.

    <p num="64">
      Reference is now made to FIG. 1, which illustrates an integrated computerized system for use in printing constructed and operative in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention and including apparatus 10 for providing a plurality of single page digital representations 12.
      <br/>
      Apparatus 10 typically comprises at least one conventional computerized page layout and assembly system, such as the Assembler workstation commercially available from Scitex Ltd.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, non-Scitex products such as Illustrator and Photoshop, both commercially available from Adobe, and Freehand, commercially available from Aldus may be employed in conjunction with an interpreter device such as PS-Bridge, commercially available from Scitex.
    </p>
    <p num="65">
      One or more such computerized page layout systems may be provided or linked to the system of the present invention by any suitable data communication technique or means, and may be remotely located from the rest of the system, as desired.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, the single-page digital representations may arrive from a large storage device such as a disk.
    </p>
    <p num="66">
      Color and spatial basis unification apparatus 14 receives the plurality of single-page digital representations from apparatus 10, each of which may have different spatial and color characteristics.
      <br/>
      Color and spatial basis unification apparatus 14 unifies the spatial and color characteristics of the single-page digital representations and outputs data for each of the single pages which preferably comprises pixel-interleaved data.
      <br/>
      Preferably, the single-page data is stored in intermediate storage and is subsequently provided to digital signature assembly generator 16 as explained below with reference to FIG. 3.
    </p>
    <p num="67">The term "pixel-interleaved data" is defined in Appendix A, attached hereto.</p>
    <p num="68">Color and spatial unification apparatus 14 may comprise aTrans/4, commercially available from Scitex Corporation, Herzlia, Israel, or alternatively may comprise the color and spatial transform apparatus described in Israel Patent Application No. 96957, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.</p>
    <p num="69">
      The unified page data provided by color/spatial unification apparatus 14 is provided to a digital signature assembly generator 16.
      <br/>
      Digital signature assembly generator 16 is operative to provide a digital representation of the signature by carrying out a full computerized page imposition function on the unified page data, including provision of signature markings such as registration marks, folding marks, cutting marks, control strips, as will be described in detail hereinbelow, preferably resulting in a complete digital representation of the full signature.
    </p>
    <p num="70">
      Signature markings are preferably provided as digital files, which are substantially analogous to the image files.
      <br/>
      The signature marking files are positioned within the signature along with the image files.
    </p>
    <p num="71">
      Preferably, the digital signature assembly generator 16 includes a "data" double buffer including two buffers, each of which is large enough to store the digital representation of one single separation of a signature corresponding to the data required for the exposure of an area covered by one laser beam path.
      <br/>
      At any given time, one of the two buffers of the "data" double buffer provides a first line to a digital output device 22 via screen generator 20 and the other one of the two buffers loads the line next to be provided to the digital output device 22 via screen generator 20.
    </p>
    <p num="72">
      Digital signature assembly generator 16 also preferably provides screen control parameters.
      <br/>
      The screen control parameters may comprise, for each of a plurality of regions defined within the pages in the signature, a plurality of parameters relating to screen angles corresponding to the plurality of separations.
      <br/>
      A plurality of screen angles corresponding to a plurality of separations in which a color image is represented is termed herein "a screen angle quartet".
      <br/>
      However, it is appreciated that the number of separations be used to represent the color image need not be 4, but rather may also be any other suitable number such as 3.
