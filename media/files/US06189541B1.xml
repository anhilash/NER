    <p num="3">
      1.
      <br/>
      Prior Art
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      The desirability of creating art images on a person's fingernails and toenails is widely recognized and practiced.
      <br/>
      Known techniques include transfer, decals, appliques and handpainting.
      <br/>
      Recently, U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,277,205; 5,302,224; and 5,316,026 have been granted regarding novel techniques for creating images on nails.
      <br/>
      Although the new technology works well in principle, there remains a need to further develop the technology in order to advance it to the point where complex multicolor images can created especially by professional nail technicians, consistently and repeatably with excellent registration and detail.
      <br/>
      Also, there remains a need to improve and engineer the known apparatus to enable manufacture both efficiently and economically.
    </p>
    <p num="5">2. Summary of Invention</p>
    <p num="6">
      Therefore, the principal object of the present invention is to provide a method and machine or apparatus for effectively creating nail art on the nail of a person's digit, and to do so to accomplish the noted purposes.
      <br/>
      To this end, the invention provides hand-operated apparatus that can be manufactured efficiently and readily, and that will be of rugged construction and will function effectively, smoothly and repeatably, especially when being worked by a professional nail technician.
    </p>
    <p num="7">Accordingly, the present invention achieves the principal object of the invention by a method for applying an art image on a person's nail that comprises the steps of establishing a reference point, positioning a person's digit relative to the reference point on an adjustable supporting base at a first preselected location, creating an image composed of an image defining coating material at a location remote from the first preselected location, picking up the created image from said remote location by a transfer element movably mounted, transferring the picked up image to the person's nail at said first preselected location in one smooth continuous motion that results in the picked up image being deposited onto the person's nail at a position on the nail correlated with the reference point.</p>
    <p num="8">
      In the method, the pick up and transfer of the image is by a smooth continuous motion that results in the depositing of the picked up image.
      <br/>
      Further, the transfer of the picked up image is effected with guiding.
      <br/>
      The step of creating the image may include the steps of depositing coating material onto an image plate and doctoring excess coating material in the creation of the image.
      <br/>
      The method steps can be repeated a multiple of times with easy repositioning of the plate between successive times.
      <br/>
      The method can further include a step of positively stopping the picked up created image in proper orientation to the person's nail during transfer, and the ready adjustment of the person's nail.
      <br/>
      The method can be carried out to create a multi-color image.
    </p>
    <p num="9">The present invention additionally contemplates a hand operated self-contained machine for applying an image on a person's nail-comprising a base frame, side rails attached to the base frame, an element for establishing a reference point, and image creating plate attached to the side rails for creating thereon an image composed of an image defining coating material, :a digit positioning member for adjustable receiving and positioning a person's digit relative to the location of the created image to achieve the appropriate orientation relative to the reference point, a transfer member mounted on the side rails movable for transferring the created image from the image creating plate to the person's nail, and a manually operable drive member to drive the transfer member.</p>
    <p num="10">
      The machine may further be characterized in that the transfer member includes a squeegee for removing excess coating material from an image and a pick up pad for picking up a created image.
      <br/>
      The machine or apparatus can further include guide elements to guide the transfer member during movement.
      <br/>
      In the machine the squeegee and the pick up pad may be mounted in common, with the pad mounted also for vertical movement.
      <br/>
      The machine may further comprise an adjustable digit positioning member for adjusting with respect to the reference point, for indexing the pick up pad relative to the person's nail.
      <br/>
      Also, the machine may have the digit positioning member contained in a holder and spring biased upwardly.
    </p>
    <p num="11">Other objects and advantages of the present invention will become readily apparent from the following.</p>

    <heading>DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
    <p num="13">
      Referring now to the drawings, the machine and method of the present invention will now be described in detail.
      <br/>
      Referring initially to FIGS. 1-4, the machine is comprised of a forward leg structure 20 and rear leg structure 22 which together with two side rails 24 and 26 constitute the machine frame.
      <br/>
      Components are made of metal, such as, aluminum, except as stated.
      <br/>
      The leg structures 20 and 22 are shown in detail in FIGS. 17 an 18 and each consists of a pair of upper leg parts 28 and 30 that extend vertically.
      <br/>
      A cross bar 32 extends horizontally and integrally interconnects upper leg parts 28 and 30.
      <br/>
      A hub 34 is integrally formed at the center line 36 and through hole 38 is defined by hub 34 extending horizontally and normal to vertical centerline.
      <br/>
      Lower leg parts 40 and 42 are thickened and displayed at an angle  ALPHA  (from about 10 (degree)  to about 30 (degree) , preferably about 15 (degree) ) lower surfaces 50 of parts 40 and 42.
      <br/>
      Threaded bolt holes 44 are formed in the suction pads 45 are bolted to leg parts 40, 42 via holes 44.
      <br/>
      Pairs of clearance bolt holes 46 are formed in the upper leg part 28 and 30 so that the side rails 24 and 26 can be bolted by bolts 48 to the upper leg parts 28 and 30.
    </p>
    <p num="14">
      The side rails 24 and 26, as noted, are fastened to the leg structures 20, 22 by bolts 48.
      <br/>
      Each side rail 24, 26 defines a longitudinally, horizontally extending slot 60, of uniform width, which terminates fore and aft with short vertically extending slots 62, 64 respectively, of the same uniform width.
      <br/>
      Slots 62 and 64 at their bottom ends are arcuate with a radius equal to one-half of the slot width.
      <br/>
      A lever 68 consisting of a pair of arms 70 and 72 interconnected by a cylindrical handle 74 via bolts 82 at their upper ends 76 also, are pivotally coupled at their lower ends 78 to the side rails 24, 26 by any suitable means, e.g. shoulder bolts 80 which permit pivoting.
      <br/>
      Preferably, handle 74 is arranged, e.g. by shoulder bolts, to be rotatable for ease of manipulation.
      <br/>
      A second reinforcement cylinder 84 is bolted by bolts 86 to the arms 70, 72 vertically below cylinder 74.
      <br/>
      Each arm 70, 72 defines a longitudinally extending slot 88 at a location that intercept slot 60, including segments 62, 64 for the full range of movement of the lever 68.
    </p>
    <p num="15">
      The side rails 24 and 26 define in their inside surfaces, a first pair of longitudinally, horizontally extending guide slots 90, that extend the entire length of the side rails 24, 26, and intercept the arcuate bottoms of the slots 62, 64.
      <br/>
      Adjacent the bottom edges of the side rails 24, 26, starting from their front edges, a pair of slots 92 are defined in the inside surfaces of the side rails 24, 26.
      <br/>
      This pair of slots 92 extends longitudinally and horizontally for about one-third the length of the side rails.
    </p>
    <p num="16">
      A plate holder, turntable assembly 100 shown in FIG. 2 and in detail in FIGS. 5-8 is fixed in position between the side rails 24, 26 by any suitable means, e.g. by longitudinally spaced bolts 102, one of which is shown in FIG. 1 for side rail 24.
      <br/>
      The other bolt is hidden under upper leg part 28.
      <br/>
      The assembly 100 is fixed above the bottom edges of the side rails by 1/3 to 1/2 their height.
      <br/>
      The assembly 100 consists of a base plate 102 defining pairs of threaded bolt holes 104 along each plate side 112 for receiving bolts 102 and effecting attachment to side rails 24, 26.
      <br/>
      Plate 102 also defines in its upper surfaces 110 a circular recess 108, and a threaded hole 114 extending from the rear edge 106 of plate 102.
      <br/>
      A detent, not shown, in the form of a threaded shank housing a spring loaded projecting ball detent, is threadedly received in hole 114 with the detent projecting slightly into the recess 108.
    </p>
    <p num="17">
      Assembly 100 further consists of a turntable 120, illustrated in FIGS. 5 and 6 which further consists of a lower circular table 122 having a diameter watching that of recess 108.
      <br/>
      At 90 (degree)  intervals, the rim 121 of table 122 is interrupted by recesses 124 for cooperation with the ball detent.
      <br/>
      Fixed to the upper surface of table 122 is a wheel 126 of greater diameter.
      <br/>
      A square recess 128 is defined in the upper surface of which 126 with an orientation such that each recess 124 is exactly aigned with the midpoint of each side 130 of square recess 128.
      <br/>
      A central axial threaded bolt hole 132 extends through table 122 and into wheel 126.
      <br/>
      Base 102 defines a central axial hole 134 through which a shoulder bolt, not shown, passes for threaded connection with hole 132.
      <br/>
      In this manner the assembly 100 is mounted between the side rails 24 and 26 and the turntable assembly (table 122 and wheel 126 are rotatably received in circular recess 108 of table base 102).
      <br/>
      As shown in FIG. 2 an engraved metal plate 140 is received in the square recess 128.
      <br/>
      Plate 140 contains four engravings 142 indexed with respect to the midpoint of each side 144 of plate 140, which in turn, is coincident with the midpoint of each side 130 of recess 128.
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      A nail block holder and nail block are shown in FIGS. 15, 16 and 33 and FIGS. 9-11, respectively.
      <br/>
      Nail block holder 150 is mounted for sliding movement between side rails 24, 26.
      <br/>
      More particularly, holder 150 is generally of rectangular block shape defining cutouts and projections.
      <br/>
