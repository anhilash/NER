      A transmission with two parallel shafts has an input shaft that may be directly connected to an engine crankshaft.
      <br/>
      The input shaft carries fixed gears that are at all times meshed with corresponding gears on the output shaft.
      <br/>
      Also, the input shaft has a screw type pump to circulate and cool fluids.The output shaft carries various modules.
      <br/>
      Each module is made up of an electromagnetic clutch with a parallel gear-plate on each side.
      <br/>
      Modules can be added or removed.
      <br/>
      All gears on the output shaft are on bearings and free to rotate.When a rheological and/or a magnetizable fluid between the electromagnets and the adjacent gear-plate are electrically energized, the fluid between them changes phase and/or it becomes magnetized and/or solidified.The electromagnetic force also pulls the sliding gear-plate to bond to the electromagnet.
      <br/>
      Each side of the electromagnet is energized independently to either attract or repulse the adjacent gear-plate.When one of the various electromagnetic clutches is installed between the engine crankshaft and the transmission input shaft.
      <br/>
      Synchronization type clutch gear-plates may be installed on the output shaft.
      <br/>
      The manual gear selector transfers electrical current from a source to the various contacts on the transmitter and thereafter along the output shaft and to the desired side of the electromagnet.

    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE TRANSMISSION</heading>
    <p num="1">
      In general existing manual and automatic automobile transmissions are complicated, inefficient, expensive, and heavy.
      <br/>
      At present few automatic automobile transmissions exist with seven or more gears.
      <br/>
      The present engineering designs are extremely difficult to build and disassemble.
    </p>
    <p num="2">
      The present art utilizes pedal friction clutches or torque converters or very complicated electromagnetic clutches for coupling the engine to the transmission shaft and very complicated oil pumps with intricate valve boxes and channels to distribute high pressure oil to control clutches so gears can be meshed or activated.
      <br/>
      Recently, computers have been incorporated to better control the timing for meshing gears in automatic transmissions, but the basic engineering designs have changed very little.
    </p>
    <heading>TRANSMISSION FOR AUTOMOTIVE VEHICLES OR MACHINERY</heading>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="3">
      Transmission type1 has an input shaft supported by the casing end bearings.
      <br/>
      The input shaft is directly connected to the engine crankshaft and rotates at the same speed and direction as the engine crankshaft.
      <br/>
      The input shaft has one canal to allow the inner annulus of the gears to be keyed with the shaft.
      <br/>
      The gears slide along the shaft and are mechanically fixed to the same shaft.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      Spacers are installed between gears to prevent longitudinal movement of the gears and strengthen the shaft.
      <br/>
      A screw type pump is machined from the end of the input shaft to push the fluid from the lower interior casing through the canal and the output shaft to lubricate bearings, gears, spacers and electromagnets.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      The output shaft is also supported by the casing end bearings.
      <br/>
      The output shaft has six canals.
      <br/>
      One canal engages the inner annulus of the free rotating gear tooth, one canal transports fluid and four canals carry electrical conduits (one canal for each electromagnet).
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      Gears, electromagnets, and spacers, are all assembled by sliding them along the shaft.
      <br/>
      The reverse gear, also on bearings, is connected to a third gear (idler gear not shown) or a belt-chain connected to the input shaft-gear to cause rotation in the same direction as the input shaft.
      <br/>
      All gears on the output shaft are on bearings and free to rotate and slide axially.
      <br/>
      They are meshed with corresponding gears on the input shaft.
      <br/>
      These gears rotate opposite the gears of the input shaft.
    </p>
    <p num="7">Fluid is transported along the output shaft canal and pushed through weep holes to lubricate all bearings of the transmission and spaces between the electromagnet and adjacent spaces and between gears and spacers.</p>
    <p num="8">
      Electrical current is transmitted to the electromagnets in conduits inside the output shaft canals.
      <br/>
      Only one side at a time of the electromagnet is energized "positive" and therefore attracts only one gear-plate.
      <br/>
      Bonding between the electromagnet and the adjacent gear is achieved by strong magnetic forces attracting the adjacent sliding gear-plate and also by energizing the rheological fluid and/or magnetizable fluid between the electromagnet and the gear-plate from liquid to solid which cause friction between the magnet and the gear-plate.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      Transmission type 2 uses various electromagnetic clutches.
      <br/>
      In this type of transmission the input shaft is connected to the engine crankshaft by an electromagnetic friction clutch or an electromagnet ferrous powder clutch.
      <br/>
      Each side of a module on the output shaft also has an electromagnetic clutch with a synchronization mechanism.
      <br/>
      Bonding between the electromagnet and the adjacent gear-plate is achieved during and after the gear is synchronized with its adjacent electromagnet, while at the same time the electromagnet pulls the gear-plate toward itself.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      Simple manual, semi-manual or automatic gear selectors are claimed that direct electric current to the various electromagnets.
      <br/>
      Various electromagnets can be used in combination with each other or individually.

      FIG. 1 is a longitudinal section showing the transmission casing 29 with input shaft 2 and output shafts 3, gear-plates, electromagnets, spacers, emergency hand disc-break, commutator, bearings, canals, flywheel, fluid pump and filter, fluid dip stick, temperature gauge, baffle and oil pump end plates.
      <br/>
      Shaft 1 is the engine power source and supports flywheel 40.
    </p>
    <p num="16">
      Input shaft 2 is supported by end bearings 26 and is either directly connected to the engine or can be joined to the engine flywheel by electromagnet 39 or an alternate electromagnet.
      <br/>
      Gears 4,5,6,7,8,9,10, and 11, pump 33 and electromagnet 39 are keyed to shaft 2 and rotate at the same speed and direction as the engine.
    </p>
    <p num="17">
      Output shaft 3 is supported by end bearings 26, gears 12,13,14,15,16,17,18, and 19, are on bearings and free to rotate around shaft 3 and slide axially.
      <br/>
      The gears inner race 26A FIG. 5 electromagnets 21, 22, 23, and 24, hand brake disc 37, transmitter 38, and spacer 75, are keyed to shaft 3.
      <br/>
      Reverse gear 4 is keyed to shaft 2, it causes rotation to shaft 3 either by a belt-chain 20 or a separate idler gear (not shown).
      <br/>
      Gear 4 is meshed to the idler gear which is meshed to gear 12.
      <br/>
      Gear 12 (reverse) rotates opposite to all other gears on shaft 3.
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      Gears 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, and 11, keyed to shaft 2 are always meshed with corresponding gears 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, and are the forward gears.
      <br/>
      Gear 14 shows an extended arm ring over the electromagnet to synchronize the rotation of the gear-plate with the electromagnet and to maximize the surface area in contact with the electromagnet similar to 18 FIG. 13.
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      Gear 16, 17, 18, and 19, have a plate adjacent to the gears to increase the bonding surface area facing the electromagnet.
      <br/>
      Belt-chain 20 can be substituted for the idler gear.
      <br/>
      When shaft 2 rotates the belt-chain causes shaft 3 to rotate in the same direction as shaft 2.
    </p>
    <p num="20">
      Each electromagnet module 21, 22, 23, and 24, keyed to shaft 3 has a multitude of electrical supply sources and face a parallel and free rotating gear-plate on each side.
      <br/>
      Each side of the electromagnet is independently energized to pull its adjacent gear-plate .
      <br/>
      The gear-plate causes (when bonded with the electromagnet) rotation of the electromagnet on the output shaft 3.

      The fluid in housing 29 goes through canal 32 and is pushed by pump 33 towards shaft 3, the interior housing 34 is shaped to direct the fluid to shaft 3 canal 52.
      <br/>
      Canal 52, FIG. 3, on shaft 3 extends to the opposite side of the shaft to lubricate all bearings, gears and spacers.

      The fluid flows from housing 29 through filter 31 and through canal 32.
      <br/>
      The purpose of canal 32 is to cool the transmission fluid and to transport the fluid from the inner housing 29 to pump 33 and on to shaft 3.

      Plate 82 is fixed to shaft 2 and flywheel 40 is attached to a plate and/or shaft 1.
      <br/>
      Springs 81 are connected to a controller ring 81A that sits inside the electromagnet.
      <br/>
      Springs 81 push against plate 82 which forces the electromagnet 80 against the flywheel 40.
      <br/>
      When electromagnet 80 is energized through wire 71A an inducent current slowly pulls electromagnet 80 against plate 82 and away from flywheel 40.
      <br/>
      When electromagnet 80 is slowly de-energized the springs again slowly push the electromagnet against the flywheel.
      <br/>
      This type of clutch, unless energized, is always engaged to the flywheel.

    <p num="60">Electromagnetic Clutch with Synchronous Mechanism</p>
    <p num="61">
      FIG. 13 is a section of an electromagnetic clutch that uses a magnetizable rheological fluid, and a synchronization mechanism to bond the gear-plate 18 to the electromagnet 80.
      <br/>
      Electromagnet 80 is keyed to shaft 3 and has a friction surface facing gear-plate 18, each side of the electromagnet has a circumferential castellated cavity that holds in place spring 85 or a castellated wedge (not shown),the teeth in spring 85 that sit in the electromagnet cavity prevents the spring from moving side ways or rotationally.
      <br/>
      The gear-plate 18 has an outer circumferential extended wedge arm.
      <br/>
      The interior electrical system of electromagnet 80 is similar to electromagnet 24 FIG. 10. When electromagnet 80 is energized the fluid between gear-plate 18 and electromagnet 80 is magnetized and the fluid solidifies slowly the gear-plate 18 is pulled by the electromagnet 80, a portion of the solidified fluid is squeezed through holes of the perforated gear-plate, the solidified fluid acts both as a shock absorber and the friction material between the gear-plate 18 and electromagnet 80.
      <br/>
      As the gear-plate moves laterally it compresses wedge spring 85 causing the rotational speed of gear-plate 18 and the electromagnet 80 to synchronize until both are bonded together.
      <br/>
      When electromagnet 80 is de-energized the solidified fluid becomes fluid once again and pulls the gear-plate away from the electromagnet spring 85.

    <p num="62">Electromagnetic Clutch within a Gear-Plate</p>
    <p num="63">
      FIG. 14 electromagnet 40A is fixed on shaft 2 and encased within an adjacent gear 40.
      <br/>
      The gears have bearing 26 and are free to rotate.
      <br/>
      A removable plug 40B is used to allow filling the space cavity between the electromagnet and the interior gear space.
      <br/>
      Seals 36 are installed between the inner gear legs and the shaft to prevent powder or fluid leakage.
    </p>
    <p num="64">The surface of the electromagnet and the opposing interior face of the gears are textured and/or grooved for better bonding between the two surfaces.</p>
    <p num="65">Because the electromagnet spins with the shaft the centrifugal forces push the magnetizable fluid powder toward the outer electromagnetic surfaces, hence when the electromagnet is electrically energized the fluid-powder becomes solidified and bonding occurs between inner gear surfaces and the charged electromagnet.</p>
