    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">
      A DRAM is a semiconductor device for storing digital information.
      <br/>
      Data, as digital information, can be written to and read from a DRAM.
      <br/>
      DRAMS are fabricated using integrated circuit technology.
    </p>
    <p num="3">
      A DRAM is made of many storage nodes or memory cells and each memory cell has a memory cell transistor and a capacitor.
      <br/>
      The capacitor is an important element of the memory cell because it stores the digital information.
      <br/>
      Trench capacitors and stack capacitors are the two major types of DRAM cell capacitors.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      The higher the capacitance of the capacitor the better.
      <br/>
      Higher capacitance improves the data sensing margin and increases the shrinkability of the memory cell.
      <br/>
      One way to increase capacitance is to increase the surface area of the capacitor (capacitor area).
      <br/>
      The trench capacitor increases the capacitor area by digging a deep trench inside the bulk silicon.
      <br/>
      The stack capacitor increases the capacitor area by raising the height of the capacitor above the surface of the silicon wafer.
      <br/>
      One particular type of stack capacitor has a cylindrical shape to increase the capacitor area without increasing the area and height of the memory cell.
      <br/>
      Stack capacitors are also referred to as capacitor-over-bit-line (COB) capacitors.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      DRAM density is ever-increasing and the size of memory cell area on the DRAM chip is decreasing.
      <br/>
      Each memory cell capacitor uses a large amount of space on the DRAM.
      <br/>
      The need for memory cell capacitors to be isolated from each other also uses space.
      <br/>
      To increase DRAM density, a method is needed to further increase the size of the DRAM memory cell capacitor and to decrease the spacing between memory cell capacitors.

    <heading>DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
    <p num="8">
      FIG. 1 is a schematic diagram of a DRAM memory cell 100 using the stacked capacitor fabricated by the method of the present invention.
      <br/>
      A DRAM has many memory cells 100.
      <br/>
      Typically, each memory cell 100 comprises a combination of a memory cell transistor 101 and a capacitor C 103.
      <br/>
      In the memory cell 100, digital information is represented by a charge stored in the capacitor C 103.
      <br/>
      When a memory cell 100 stores a one value, the capacitor 103 is charged, and when the memory cell 100 stores a zero value, the capacitor 103 is discharged.
      <br/>
      However, the present invention is equally applicable when a charged capacitor 103 is used to store a zero value and a discharged capacitor 103 is used to store a one value.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      The capacitor 103 will lose any stored charge unless it is regularly recharged or refreshed.
      <br/>
      Also, reading the information stored in the memory cell 100 destroys the contents of the memory cell 100.
      <br/>
      More specifically, after a memory cell 100 that previously had a charged capacitor 103 has been read, the amount of charge remaining on the capacitor 103 is not sufficient to distinguish it from a memory cell 100 having a discharged capacitor 103.
      <br/>
      As a result, the information previously stored in the memory cell 100 needs to be restored after it has been read.
      <br/>
      Also, the memory cell 100 needs to be periodically refreshed to prevent the information stored by the memory cell 100 from being lost due to charge leakage.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      Each memory cell 100 is connected to a word line (WL) 105 and a bit line 107.
      <br/>
      A word-line driver restores the contents of the memory cell 100.
      <br/>
      To restore a "one" level to the memory cell capacitor C 103, the word line driver must output a voltage on the word line 105 that exceeds the voltage present on the bit line 107.
      <br/>
      Since the maximum voltage that will be present on the bit line 107 after a read operation is the supply voltage Vcc, the word line driver must generate a voltage that exceeds Vcc.
      <br/>
      Typically, the word line driver is a charge pump circuit that generates a voltage that exceeds the supply voltage Vcc.
    </p>
    <p num="11">
      The capacitor 103 has two plates separated by a dielectric.
      <br/>
      One plate of the capacitor 103 is connected to the drain of the memory cell transistor 101.
      <br/>
      The other plate of the capacitor 103 is connected to ground.
      <br/>
      The word line 105 is connected to the gate of the memory cell transistor 101.
      <br/>
      The bit line 107 is connected to the source of the memory cell transistor 101.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, the drain of the memory cell transistor 101 can be connected to the bit line 107 and the source of the memory cell transistor 101 can be connected to the capacitor 103.
    </p>
    <p num="12">
      FIGS. 2a-2h show a method to build a memory cell for a DRAM using the self-aligned cylinder opening of the present invention.
      <br/>
      FIGS. 2a and 2b show well-known steps to form the memory cell transistor 101, the word line 105 and the bit line 107 in a stacked capacitor structure.
    </p>
    <p num="13">
      FIG. 2a shows the formation of the memory cell transistor and the word lines 105.
      <br/>
      A substrate 201 has two memory cell regions 203 and each memory cell region 203 contains a memory cell.
      <br/>
      The substrate 201 can be silicon.
      <br/>
      The memory cell region 203 has a memory cell transistor area 205 including a source area 207, a gate area 209 and a drain area 211.
      <br/>
      In an alternative embodiment, the source and drain areas can be reversed.
    </p>
    <p num="14">
      An interlayer dielectric (ILD) 213 is adjacent the substrate 201.
      <br/>
      The ILD 213 is partially shown to simplify the description and is well-known.
      <br/>
      First, field oxide is formed in inactive regions.
      <br/>
      Selected portions of the substrate 201 are masked against oxidation and the exposed unmasked surface is oxidized.
      <br/>
      The exposed unmasked areas remain as high areas 215 making up a field-oxide-pattern (FOX).
      <br/>
      The high areas 215 form dielectric isolation regions for isolating semiconductor surface regions from other such regions in the substrate 201.
      <br/>
      Next, the surface of the substrate 201 is thermally oxidized to form the oxide layer to a desired thickness in the unmasked areas of the substrate 201.
      <br/>
      As a result, the high areas 215 are surrounded by low areas having a reduced oxide thickness 216.
    </p>
    <p num="15">
      The word line 105 comprises a first conductive layer 217 such as a polysilicon layer or a combination of polysilicon and metal silicide layers.
      <br/>
      The metal silicide layer can be tungsten silicide (WSi2) or cobalt silicide (CoSi2).
      <br/>
      The polysilicon layer can be doped to provide conductivity.
      <br/>
      The word lines 105 are patterned using conventional lithography and anisotropic etching techniques.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, the word lines 105 can be formed using a composite layer.
      <br/>
      To form the composite layer, a layer of polysilicon is deposited by a LPCVD process, then a metal silicide layer is deposited on top of the polysilicon layer using a LPCVD process.
      <br/>
      The metal silicide layer reduces the sheet resistance of the polysilicon layer.
      <br/>
      The word lines 105 of the DRAM connect the gates of the memory cell transistors in a desired pattern.
    </p>
    <p num="16">
      The formation of memory cell transistors 101 is well-known.
      <br/>
      A lithographic mask exposes the source and drain areas, 207 and 211 respectively, and the exposed areas of the substrate 201 are doped with ions 218 to form a source 219 and a drain 220. N-type ions are implanted to produce an n-channel transistor, and P-type ions are implanted to produce a p-channel transistor.
      <br/>
      Typically, the memory cell 100 comprises an n-channel transistor.
    </p>
    <p num="17">For simplicity, the source and drain components of the memory cell transistor will not be shown in subsequent drawings although they are present.</p>
    <p num="18">
      FIG. 2b shows the formation of the bit line 107.
      <br/>
      A first insulation layer 221 is formed over the surface adjacent the word lines.
      <br/>
      The first insulation layer 221 comprises oxide, such as SiO2 The first insulation layer 221 can be patterned using conventional lithographic and etching techniques to form a bit-line opening 223 in the first insulation layer 221 for the bit line to contact the drain area 211.
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      The bit line is then formed by depositing a second conductive layer 225, such as a second polysilicon layer (P2) or a combination of polysilicon and metal silicide layers, over the first insulation layer 221.
      <br/>
      The metal silicide layer can be tungsten silicide (WSi2) or cobalt silicide (CoSi2).
      <br/>
      The second polysilicon layer can be doped.
      <br/>
      The second conductive layer 225 fills the bit-line opening 223 in the insulation layer 221 and electrically contacts the drain area 211.
      <br/>
      The deposition process can form the bit-line using doped polysilicon deposited by a low pressure chemical vapor deposition (LPCVD) process.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, the bit-line can be formed using a composite layer.
      <br/>
      To form the composite layer, a layer of polysilicon is deposited by a LPCVD process, then a metal silicide layer is deposited on top of the polysilicon layer using a LPCVD process.
      <br/>
      The metal silicide layer reduces the sheet resistance of the polysilicon layer.
    </p>
    <p num="20">
      The dotted lines in FIG. 2b show that the bit line extends across the DRAM.
      <br/>
      In FIG. 2b and subsequent figures, the bit line is behind, and does not contact, the area in which the capacitor will be formed.
    </p>
    <p num="21">
      FIG. 2c shows the formation of the capacitor contact where the bottom plate of the capacitor 103 contacts the source 219 of the memory cell transistor 101 in a portion of the source region 207.
      <br/>
      A second insulation layer 227 is formed over the bit lines 225.
      <br/>
      The second insulation layer 227 comprises oxide, such as SiO2, or a composite layer of SiO2 and spin-on-glass (SOG) and is deposited using well-known deposition techniques such as LPCVD The second insulation layer 227 is planarized (providing a flat surface) using a chemical-mechanical polish (CMP) process.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, a plasma etch back process can be used to planarize the composite layer of SiO2 and SOG.
    </p>
    <p num="22">
      A capacitor opening 229 is formed over a portion of the source region 207 and extends to the substrate 201 so that the bottom plate of the capacitor 103 will contact a portion of the transistor's source 219 in the source area 207 of the memory cell transistor 100.
      <br/>
      The bottom plate 231 of the capacitor 103 is formed.
      <br/>
      A third conductive layer 231, such as a third polysilicon layer (P3) is deposited and fills the storage node opening 229.
      <br/>
      The third polysilicon layer can be doped.
      <br/>
      A LPCVD process can be used to deposit the third polysilicon layer.
    </p>
    <p num="23">
      The desired amount of capacitance (capacitance value) is a function of the height and thickness of the capacitor sidewalls.
      <br/>
      The thickness of the third conductive layer 231 defines the height of the capacitor sidewalls.
      <br/>
      Preferably, the capacitor sidewalls have a height of about 4,000 angstroms ( Angstrom ).
      <br/>
      The height of the capacitor sidewall is determined by the cell area.
      <br/>
      A smaller cell area implies a smaller capacitor area.
      <br/>
      To compensate for a smaller cell area, a higher capacitor sidewall is used to provide sufficient capacitance (about 30 femto-farads per cell).
      <br/>
      The thickness of the capacitor sidewalls will be discussed below.
    </p>
    <p num="24">
      A third insulation layer 233 is deposited over the third conductive layer 231.
      <br/>
      The third insulation layer 233 can be an oxide such as SiO2, and can be formed using well-known deposition techniques.
    </p>
    <p num="25">
      FIG. 2d shows the formation of the sidewalls of the capacitor and an inter-capacitor isolation region 240.
      <br/>
      The inter-capacitor isolation region 240 separates the capacitors 103 in adjacent memory cells 100 and is formed by anisotropically etching the third insulation layer 233 and third conductive layer 231 in a predetermined pattern.
      <br/>
      The inter-capacitor isolation region 240 extends to the second insulation layer 227.
    </p>
    <p num="26">
      Next, a capacitor sidewall spacing region 243 is formed by laterally etching the third insulation layer 233.
      <br/>
      An isotropic etch, such as a wet-etch process, is used.
      <br/>
      Both the top 247 and sides 243 of the third insulation layer 233 are etched.
      <br/>
      The wet-etch process also etches a portion of the second insulation layer 245 and undercuts the edges of the third conductive layer 231.
      <br/>
      Because the wet-etch process is a selective chemical etch, the third conductive layer 231 is not etched.
    </p>
    <p num="27">
      The wet-etch process defines the thickness of the capacitor sidewalls.
      <br/>
      In a preferred embodiment, the capacitor sidewalls are about 500  Angstrom  thick with a deviation of  +- 100  Angstrom .
      <br/>
      The etch rate can be controlled and a desired etch rate can be selected.
      <br/>
      In a preferred embodiment, the etch rate is about ten to fifteen angstroms per second.
      <br/>
      If the wet-etch process takes about thirty seconds and at an etch rate of fifteen  Angstrom  per second, the capacitor sidewall spacing region 243 will be about 450  Angstrom .

      FIG. 2e shows the formation of the capacitor cylinder opening mask.

      After laterally etching the third insulation layer 233, a protective layer 250 such as photo-resist is applied to or spun onto the surface.
      <br/>
      The protective layer 250 fills the inter-capacitor isolation region 240 and capacitor sidewall spacing region 243.
      <br/>
      Then, as shown in FIG. 2e, a portion of the protective layer 250 is removed or etched back to expose a portion of the third insulation layer 233.

    <p num="29">
      FIG. 2f shows the formation of the interior surface of the capacitor 103 bottom plate.

      Another wet-etch process completely removes the third insulation layer 233.

      An anisotropic etch of the third conductive layer 231 removes a portion of the third conductive layer 231.
      <br/>
      The portion of the third conductive layer 231 beneath the photo-resist layer 250 remains to form the sidewalls 260 of the bottom plate of the capacitor 103.

      As a result, the third conductive layer 231, which functions as the bottom plate of the capacitor, is exposed.
      <br/>
      A dielectric layer 270 is formed on the surface of the third conductive layer 231.
      <br/>
      The dielectric layer 270 can be an oxide, silicon nitride or Ta2 O5 layer.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, the dielectric layer 270 is a composite layer such as oxide-nitride-oxide (ONO) in which the oxide layers are thermally grown.

      For higher capacitance, Ta2 O5 is used.
