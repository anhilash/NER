    <heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">
      This invention is directed to a process for convergently preparing azacycloalkanoylpseudotetrapeptides comprising coupling a dipeptide with a psuedodipeptide.
      <br/>
      This invention is also directed to intermediates and processes for preparing the intermediates useful in preparing the pseudotetrapeptide.
    </p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="3">
      Azacycloalkylalkanoyl pseudotetrapeptides, as exemplified by N-�N-�N-(4-piperdin-4-yl)butanoyl)-N-ethylglycyl�-(L)-aspartyl�-(L)- BETA -cyclohexyl-alanine amide, have antithrombotic activity, including the inhibition of platelet aggregation and thrombus formation in mammals, and are useful in the prevention and treatment of thrombosis associated with disease states such as myocardial infarction, stroke, peripheral arterial disease and disseminated intravascular coagulation.
      <br/>
      See PCT Patent Application Publication No. WO95/10295.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      These pseudotetrapeptides have heretofore been prepared by sequential synthesis from the C-terminal amino acid using standard solid phase or solution phase peptide synthesis procedures.
      <br/>
      However, sequential coupling of amino acids is less desirable for the production of bulk drug as it constrains manufacturing to a linear schedule.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      Thus, an alternative preparative approach to the pseudotetrapeptides is needed.
      <br/>
      Such an approach should substantially increase production versatility and efficiency.
      <br/>
      A convergent approach should provide for specialized modifications of the pseudotetrapeptide by performing specialized chemistry on one of the synthons rather than on the whole pseudotetrapeptide, and should provide for the simultaneous preparation of a number of pseudotetrapeptide analogs.

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="13">Definitions of Terms</p>
    <p num="14">As used above, and throughout the description of this invention, the following terms, unless otherwise indicated, shall be understood to have the following meanings:</p>
    <p num="15">"Azaheterocyclyl" means a 4-8 membered saturated, unsaturated, or aromatic carbocyclic ring system in which one of the carbon atoms other than the carbon of the  (Chemical Structure image '9' not included in text)</p>
    <p num="16">
      moiety is replaced with a nitrogen atom.
      <br/>
      When the nitrogen atom is incorporated in the ring system through two single bonds, it is optionally substituted by a nitrogen protecting group P1.
      <br/>
      Representative azaheterocyclyl groups include piperidinyl, N-tert-butoxycarbonylpiperidinyl, N-benzyloxycarbonypiperidinyl, pyrrolidinyl, N-tert-butoxycarbonylpyrrolidinyl, N-benzyloxycarbonypyrolidinyl, pyrrolyl, pyridinyl, and the like.
      <br/>
      Preferred azaheterocyclyl groups are pyridyl, N-tert-butoxycarbonylpiperidin-4-yl and N-benzyloxycarbonypiperidin-4-yl.
    </p>
    <p num="17">
      "Alkyl" means a saturated aliphatic hydrocarbon group, which may be straight or branched, having about 1 to about 20 carbon atoms in the chain.
      <br/>
      Branched means that a lower alkyl group such as methyl, ethyl or propyl is attached to a linear alkyl chain.
      <br/>
      Preferred straight or branched alkyl groups are the "lower alkyl " groups which are those alkyl groups having from 1 to about 10 carbon atoms.
      <br/>
      More preferred lower alkyl groups have from 1 to about 6 carbon atoms.
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      "Cycloalkyl" means a saturated carbocyclic group having one or more rings and having about 3 to about 10 carbon atoms.
      <br/>
      Preferred cycloalkyl groups include cyclopropyl, cyclobutyl, cyclopentyl, cyclohexyl, cycloheptyl, and decahydronaphthyl.
    </p>
    <p num="19">

      <br/>
      Platinum on alumina is particularly preferred as the catalyst can be readily regenerated.
      <br/>
      The hydrogenation is carried out in a lower alcohol, preferably butanol, or a C1 -C10 saturated organic acid, preferably acetic acid.
      <br/>
      The hydrogenation is accomplished under a hydrogen pressure of from about 2 to about 5 bars of hydrogen at a temperature of from about 40 (degree)  C. to about 80 (degree)  C. Lower temperatures can be used if the pressure of hydrogen is increased.

      When Q3 is a hydrogenation labile protecting group, deprotection to provide IX is accomplished simultaneously with the reduction of the benzene ring described above.
      <br/>
      When Q3 is an acid labile protecting group such as tert-butyloxycarbonyl, deprotection is preferably accomplished by treating a solution of XVII with gaseous HCl.
      <br/>
      In an especially preferred aspect, the acid labile protecting group is removed by introduction of gaseous HCl into the reaction mixture of the hydrogenation step.

      A mixture of 40 kg of N-benzyloxycarbonyl) succinimide and 26 kg (175 mol) of 4-piperidone hydrochloride hydrate in 38.8 kg of water and 88 kg of tetrahydrofuran is stirred at about 15 (degree)  C. until dissolution is complete (.about.15 minutes). N-methylmorpholine (22.8 kg) is added to the agitated mixture (exothermic) while maintaining the temperature at or below 20 (degree)  C. The reaction mixture is agitated at about 20 (degree)  C. for 2.5 hours, at which point HPLC indicates complete reaction.
      <br/>
      The mixture is diluted with 115.2 kg of methyl tert-butyl ether and 38.8 kg of water and is agitated at about 20 (degree)  C. for 5 minutes.
      <br/>
      Agitation is stopped, the layers are allowed to separate, and the aqueous (lower) layer is removed and discarded.
      <br/>
      The organic layer is washed twice with 129.6 kg of water (agitate 5 minutes, separate phases, remove/discard aqueous �lower� phase).
      <br/>
      The organic layer is washed with 5.2 kg of NaCl in 46.8 kg of water (agitate 5 minutes, separate phases, remove/discard aqueous �lower� layer).
      <br/>
      The organic layer is treated with 11.5 kg of MgSO4, with agitation for 1 hour, then the mixture is filtered.
      <br/>
      The reactor is rinsed with 8 kg of methyl tert-butyl ether (filtered, combined with main filtrate; total filtrate water content: 0.52%).
      <br/>
      The filtrate volume is reduced by half via distillation at reduced pressure at 30 (degree)  C. Vacuum is broken to nitrogen and the residue is cooled to 20 (degree)  C. (pot residue water content: 0.43%).
      <br/>
      The residue is diluted with 57.6 kg of methyl tert-butyl ether, then mixture volume is reduced again by half via distillation under vacuum at 30 (degree)  C. Vacuum is released to nitrogen and the mixture is cooled to 20 (degree)  C. (pot residue water content: 0.25%).
      <br/>
      This is repeated 5 additional times.
      <br/>
      The final pot residue is diluted with 28.8 kg of methyl tert-butyl ether and mixed for 5 minutes, then assayed for water content and content of 1-phenylmethoxycarbonyl-4-piperidone (water: 0.05%; wt/wt assay 1-phenylmethoxycarbonyl-4-piperidone: 22.66 wt%, 35.36 kg, 155 mole, 88.6% yield.).

      To a suspension of 82 g of 3-carboxypropyl triphenylphosphonium bromide in 407 mL of 1,2-diethoxyethane at 14 (degree)  C. is added over 25 minutes 220 g of 20 wt % potassium tert-butoxide in tetrahydrofuran while maintaining the reaction mixture temperature at 24-28 (degree)  C. The mixture is stirred for 1 hour, cooled to 10 (degree)  C., and a solution of 52.5 g of 1-phenylmethoxycarbonyl-4-piperidone in 246 mL of methyl tert-butyl ether is added over 30 minutes while maintaining cooling.
      <br/>
      After addition is complete, the mixture is stirred at 12 (degree)  C. for 10 minutes, then warmed to 20 (degree)  C. and stirred for an additional 30 minutes.
      <br/>
      The reaction mixture is treated with 410 mL of 1N aqueous HCl for 10 minutes, diluted with 328 mL of methyl tert-butyl ether, and then the phases are separated.
      <br/>
      The organic phase is washed with 205 mL of water, then 210 mL of 1N aqueous NaOH.
      <br/>
      The NaOH layer, which contains the product, is collected separately, washed with three 189 g portions of ethyl acetate, acidified to pH 3.48 with concentrated HCl, then extracted with 189 mL of ethyl acetate.
      <br/>
      The ethyl acetate layer is separated, washed with 211 mL of water, then dried for 30 minutes over 10 g of MgSO4, filtered, and concentrated in vacuo.
      <br/>
      The oily residue (50.7 g) is crystallized from toluene/heptane to afford a total of 29.46 g (51% yield) of 3-(1-phenylmethoxycarbonyl-4-piperidinylmethylene)propanoic acid.
