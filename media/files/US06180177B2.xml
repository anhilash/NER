    <p num="1">The present application is a national stage under 35 U.S.C. .sctn.371 of international application PCT/JP98/04458 filed on Oct. 2, 1998.</p>
    <heading>TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
    <p num="2">The present invention relates to the composition of a surface-treatment agent and the treating method, which can impart to the surface of metallic materials a high corrosion-resistance and can form a film having improved fingerprint resistance, blackening resistance and adhesiveness of the paint coating.</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND TECHNIQUE</heading>
    <p num="3">
      Such metallic materials as steel sheets plated with a zinc-containing metal, aluminum sheets and the like are used in broad fields such as automobiles, building materials and appliances.
      <br/>
      However, the zinc and aluminum used in these metallic materials are corroded in ambient air to form a corrosion product which is the so-called white rust.
      <br/>
      This corrosion product disadvantageously impairs the appearance of metallic materials and further detrimentally effects the adhesiveness of the paint coating.
    </p>
    <p num="4">Therefore, in order to improve corrosion-resistance and adhesiveness of paint coating, chromating is usually applied on the surface of metallic materials by using a treating agent which contains as the main components chromic acid, bichromic acid or its salts.</p>
    <p num="5">
      Nevertheless, chromating is liable to often avoided because consciousness of environmental conservation is recently intensified.
      <br/>
      The hexavalent chromium contained in the chromating liquid used for treating the surface of metallic materials exerts detrimental influence directly upon the human body.
      <br/>
      In addition, the waste water, which contains hexavalent chromium, must be subjected to special treatment as stipulated under the Law of Prevention of Water Pollution.
      <br/>
      This is a reason that the total cost of the surface-treated metallic materials is considerably increased.
      <br/>
      In addition, when the equipment, in which the chromated metallic material is used, is discarded, the metallic material becomes industrial waste which, however, contains chromium.
      <br/>
      Although these materials are chromium-source, a serious disadvantage is that they cannot be recycled.
      <br/>
      This involves a socially serious problem.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      Meanwhile, a well-known surface treating method other than chromating is that using a surface-treating agent which contains tannic acid which, in turn, contains polyphenol carboxylic acid.
      <br/>
      When the metallic material is treated with an aqueous solution of tannic acid, a protective film is formed by the reaction between the tannic acid and the metallic material.
      <br/>
      It is believed that since the protective film acts as a barrier against intrusion of corrosive material, the corrosion-resistance is enhanced.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      However, since, recently, high corrosion-resistance of the film per se is required along with quality enhancement of the products, the corrosion-resistance attained by the tannic acid alone or the tannic acid together with an inorganic component falls short.
      <br/>
      It is not possible for such film, therefore, to be put to practical use under the present situation.
    </p>
    <p num="8">There is a disclosure in Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication (kokai) No. Sho 53-121034 to enhance the corrosion resistance, that is, an aqueous solution, which contains water dispersive silica, alkyd resin and trialkoxy silane compound, is applied on the metal surface and dried to form the coating film.</p>
    <p num="9">There are disclosure in Japanese Unexamined Patent Publications (kokai) Nos. Sho 57-44,751 and Hei 1-177,380 of a surface treatment method, in which a water-soluble resin consisting of a hydroxypyrone-compound derivative is used to impart to the metallic material the corrosion-resistance, and a method, in which a water-soluble or water-dispersive polymer of a hydroxystyrene compound is used to impart to the metallic material the corrosion resistance.</p>
    <p num="10">
      However, none of the above-described methods can form a film which has sufficiently high corrosion-resistance capable of substituting for the chromate film.
      <br/>
      The practical issue is, therefore, that the above-described problems have remain unsolved.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, it is strongly required under the present situation that the non-chromate surface-treatment agent and the treatment method be developed for the metallic material to improve corrosion-resistance.
    </p>
    <p num="11">
      It is an object of the present invention to solve the above described problems involved in the prior art, and to provide a non-chromate type surface-treatment agent for metallic materials, which agent can form on the surface of metallic material a film having improved corrosion-resistance, and which agent can improve fingerprint resistance, blackening resistance and adhesiveness of the paint coating.
      <br/>
      It is also an object of the present invention to provide a surface-treating method using the non-chromate type surface-treatment agent.
    </p>
    <heading>DISCLOSURE OF INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="12">
      The present inventors repeatedly undertook intensive study to solve the problems involved in the prior art and discovered that a film, which exhibits improved corrosion-resistance, fingerprint resistance, blackening resistance and adhesiveness of the paint coating can be formed by means of treating the surface of metallic material with an acidic treating agent which contains a specific cationic component, a silane coupling agent and a water-soluble polymer having a specific chemical structure.

      Preferably, the equivalent ratio of the active hydrogen-containing groups of said first group silane coupling-agent (a) relative to the epoxy group contained in the second silane coupling-agent (b) is from 3:1 to 1:3.

      As long as these metals are contained, the method of supplying them is not particularly limited.
      <br/>
      Specific preferable examples of the supplying method is the addition in the form of carbonate, phosphate, nitrate, sulfate, acetate, fluoride salt, oxide salt or metal.

      Metallic ions other than the above-mentioned ones are not preferable because high corrosion-resistance is not obtained.

      <br/>
      On the other hand, when the cationic component exceeds 10% by weight, the stability of the composition of the surface-treatment agent and the aqueous treating liquid containing such composition is impaired.

      The acid component (B) in the surface-treatment composition in the present invention contains at least one selected from the group consisting of (1) fluoro-acid which contains at least four fluorine atoms, and one or more elements selected from the group consisting of titanium, zirconium, silicon, hafnium, aluminum and boron, (2) phosphoric acid, and (3) acetic acid.
      <br/>
      The blending amount of these components is not particularly limited.

      It is, however, preferable that the pH of the composition of the surface-treatment is adjusted to 2.0 to 6.5 by that acid component.

      In addition, the acid component is preferably contained at 0.1 to 15% by weight relative to the total solid matters of the composition of the surface-treatment agent according to the present invention.

      When the acid component is less than 0.1% by weight relative to the total solid matters, the pH cannot be adjusted within the above mentioned range, with the result that the film-depositing characteristic is impaired and the corrosion-resistance is degraded.

      In a case, where the first and second silane coupling agents are used in the surface-treatment agent of the present invention, and hence the reactive functional groups of the silane coupling-agents are an amino group having active hydrogen and an epoxy group, the equivalent ratio of the amino group having active hydrogen to the epoxy group is preferably in a range of 3:1 to 1:3.
      <br/>
      When the equivalent ratio of the amino group having active hydrogen to the epoxy group exceeds 3:1 and hence the amount of the amino group is excessive, the film-depositing property of the film obtained by treatment is of so poor that corrosion-resistance, fingerprint resistance, blackening resistance and adhesiveness of the paint coating are not satisfactory.
      <br/>
      In addition, when this equivalent ratio is less than 1:3, corrosion-resistance, fingerprint resistance, blackening resistance and adhesiveness of the paint coating on the film obtained by the treatment are saturated and hence such film is economically useless.

      In the formula (I) and (II) n indicates the average polymerization degree of from 2 to 50.
      <br/>
      When n is less than 2, the molecular weight of the obtained polymer is too small to attain corrosion-resistance of the obtained film.
      <br/>
      In addition, when n exceeds 50, the stability of the obtained composition of the surface-treatment agent as well as the water-soluble treating liquid, which contains said composition, is poor, thus causing practical inconvenience.

      When one Z group is introduced in the ten benzene rings per one polymer molecule, the average value of the Z-group substitution in the polymer is �(1 * 10)+(0 * 10)�/20=0.5. When the average Z-group substitution value is less than 0.2, the water-soluble property of the obtained polymer is unsatisfactory and, hence the stability of the composition of the surface-treatment agent and the aqueous treating liquid obtained from that composition is poor.
      <br/>
      On the other hand, when such value exceeds 1.0, the water-soluble property of the obtained polymer becomes excessive so that the soluble property of the obtained film is increased such that the corrosion-resistance becomes unsatisfactory.

      In the surface-treating agent of the present invention, the weight ratio of the silane coupling agent (C) to the water-soluble polymer (D) is preferably from 1:10 to 10:1, more preferably from 1:1 to 5:1.
      <br/>
      When this ratio is less than 1:10, that is, the ratio of silane coupling-agent is low, since the strength of adhesion on the substrate surface is lowered, the corrosion-resistance and the adhesiveness are lowered.
      <br/>
      When that ratio exceeds 10:1, that is, the ratio of contained silane coupling agent becomes excessive, the film-depositing speed of the obtained surface-treatment composition is lowered and hence the corrosion-resistance becomes unsatisfactory.

      Preferably, the pH of the aqueous surface treating liquid, which contains the composition of the surface-treatment agent according to the present invention, is adjusted in a range of from 2.0 to 6.5.

      <br/>
      In a case of lowering the pH of the aqueous surface-treating liquid, it is preferable to use as the adjusting agent the acid component (B) used in the present invention.
      <br/>
      When the pH is less than 2.0, the reaction of the substrate surface becomes excessive so that failure in the film formation is incurred.
      <br/>
      As a result, corrosion-resistance, fingerprint resistance, blackening resistance and adhesiveness of paint coating become unsatisfactory.
      <br/>
      In addition, when the pH exceeds 6.5, the water-soluble polymer per se is liable to precipitate and deposit from the aqueous treating liquid.
      <br/>
      The life of the aqueous surface-treating liquid is, therefore, shortened.

      It is also preferable in the method according to the present invention to deposit on the surface of metallic material the aqueous surface-treating liquid and dry it to provide from 0.01 to 5.0 g/m2 of dry weight.
      <br/>
      When the weight of the film after drying is less than 0.01 g/m2, it is difficult to coat the metallic material so that corrosion-resistance, fingerprint resistance, blackening resistance and adhesiveness of the paint coating become unsatisfactory.
      <br/>
      When the weight of the film after drying exceeds 5.0 g/m2, adhesiveness of the paint coating is lowered.

      The metallic material, which is subjected to the surface-treatment according to the present invention, is not particularly limited with regard to kind, dimension, shape and the like.
      <br/>

      The metallic material, which is treated by the composition of the surface-treatment agent of the present invention, has greatly improved corrosion-resistance, fingerprint resistance, blackening resistance and adhesiveness of paint coating.
      <br/>
      Its mode of operation and effects are described.
    </p>
    <p num="48">
      First, when the surface of the metallic material is brought into contact with the aqueous surface-treating agent, which contains the composition of the surface-treatment agent, the etching of the metal surface occurs due to the acid composition in the treating liquid.
      <br/>
      This results in a rise of the pH at the interface.
      <br/>
      The dissolved metallic ions, the divalent or higher valent cationic component in the surface-treating liquid, and the water-soluble polymer are brought into reaction to form on the interface a hard-to-dissolve resin coating.
      <br/>
      This hard-to-dissolve resin coating seems to exhibit a barrier effect that corrosion-resistance of the metallic material, fingerprint resistance, blackening resistance and adhesiveness of the paint coating are enhanced.
      <br/>
      However, since the adhesiveness of the metallic material treated as above and the film is low, the silane coupling agent is concomitantly used.
      <br/>
      The functional group (--OR) of the silane coupling agent, which has undergone hydrolysis, forms an oxane bond with the surface of the metallic material.
      <br/>
      In addition, the adhesiveness of the metallic material and water-soluble polymer as well as that of the organic paint and water-soluble polymer is enhanced, presumably because the functional group of the silane coupling-agent reacts with the water-soluble polymer and the organic paint.
