      Field of the Invention
    </p>
    <p num="2">The present invention relates to an adaptive threshold controlled decision circuit suitable for receiving optical digital signals contaminated with ringing components.</p>
    <p num="3">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
    <p num="4">
      In computers and communications equipment, optical interconnection networks are used to transfer optical binary signals between LSI circuits with no format conversion.
      <br/>
      As constituent elements of the interconnection networks, attention is currently focused on DC-mode optical receivers capable of receiving binary digits of the same value which last for an indefinitely long period of time.
      <br/>
      Since the required transmission rate is more than several 100 of megabits per second, DC-mode optical receivers with a constant decision threshold and a dynamic range of 10 to 15 dB are not practical because of the difficulty to support a sufficient bandwidth to meet the speed requirement.
      <br/>
      AC-mode optical receivers are also known in the art.
      <br/>
      This type of optical receivers is used in combination with a coding circuit as an optical data link to take the benefit of its excellent sensitivity characteristic to low optical input levels.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      An important factor to be taken into consideration in the design of an optical receiver is the generation of noise-like components, or "ringing", caused by electrical crosstalk between optical transmitters.
      <br/>
      The ringing occurs on both high and low level laser outputs when laser diodes are driven at logical-1 (i.e., mark) and logical-0 level (i.e., space), respectively.
      <br/>
      Although the ringing that occurs at low level laser output can be reduced to a minimum by setting the bias current of laser diodes at a value sufficiently lower than their threshold level, it is impossible to eliminate the ringing that occurs at high level laser output.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      As shown in FIG. 1, a prior art optical receiver disclosed in Japanese Laid-Open Patent Specification Hei-8-84160 includes a photodiode 1 for converting optical unipolar input pulses (see FIG. 1) to an electrical current signal which is fed to a differential preamplifier 2.
      <br/>
      The preamplifier produces a pair of voltage signals of opposite logic levels.
      <br/>
      The true output of the preamplifier is supplied to a peak detector 3 and an adder 5, and the complementary output is supplied to a peak detector 4 and an adder 6.
      <br/>
      The difference between the outputs of adders 5 and 6 is determined by a subtractor 7.
      <br/>
      As a result, the decision levels of a decision circuit 8, or Schmitt trigger are adaptively controlled by the input signal.
      <br/>
      When the difference output of subtractor 7 is higher than threshold VH, the output of decision circuit 8 goes high and when it reduces to a level lower than threshold VL, the output of decision circuit 8 goes low.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      As shown in FIG. 2, when the optical input level is low, there is no ringing component.
      <br/>
      After two successive cycles of marks and spaces, the optical input is maintained at a high level which is rich in ringing components.
      <br/>
      If no ringing were present, the output of subtractor 7 would steadily decay and stay at a midpoint of the two threshold values, so that the optical receiver could be used as a DC-mode optical receiver.
      <br/>
      However, due to the presence of ringing component, the difference signal crosses the high and low threshold levels in rapid succession, producing error pulses.
      <br/>
      Since the amplitude of the ringing component is proportional to the optical input power, this ringing problem will become serious and the implementation of a DC-mode optical receiver operating on a high optical input level becomes difficult.
      <br/>
      On the other hand, if the optical input contains no DC components, the prior art optical receiver can still be used as an excellent AC-mode optical receiver.
    </p>
    <p num="8">Furthermore, optical receivers are used in both interconnection networks and data links and demand for such applications is enormous, there is therefore a need for dual mode optical receivers.</p>
    <p num="9">
      Japanese Laid-Open Patent Specifications Sho-62-206947 and Hei-2-266630 disclose DC-mode optical receivers immune to ringing components.
      <br/>
      However, it is impossible to modify the prior art DC-mode optical receivers into AC-mode optical receivers to be used in tandem connection while canceling offset components.
    </p>

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
    <p num="14">
      In FIG. 3, the optical receiver of this invention comprises a photodiode 11 for converting optical unipolar input pulses to an electrical current signal which is fed to a differential preamplifier 12 of an adaptive threshold controlled decision circuit.
      <br/>
      The preamplifier produces a pair of voltage signals of true and complementary logic levels.
      <br/>
      The true output of the preamplifier is supplied to a peak detector 13 and an adder 15.
    </p>
    <p num="15">
      According to this invention, the complementary output of differential preamplifier 12 is supplied only to an adder 16 where it is summed with the output of peak detector 13, and the differential preamplifier 12 has a constant DC voltage supply circuit 19 which feeds a peak detector 14 which is identical in time-constant characteristic to the peak detector 13.
      <br/>
      Adder 15 combines the true output of differential amplifier 12 with the output of peak detector 14.
      <br/>
      Peak detectors 13 and 14 are of identical circuit configuration.
    </p>
    <p num="16">
      Difference between the outputs of adders 15 and 16 is determined by a subtractor 17 and then compared by a decision circuit or Schmitt trigger 18 with a decision threshold Vth.
      <br/>
      When the difference output of subtractor 17 is higher than threshold Vth, the output of decision circuit 18 is high.
      <br/>
      Otherwise, the output of decision circuit 18 is low.
    </p>
    <p num="17">
      The voltage produced by the DC voltage supply circuit 19 is a DC voltage of constant level M which is set equal to an average value of the true and complementary output voltages of the differential amplifier 12.
      <br/>
      This constant DC voltage M is coupled via the peak detector 14 to the adder 15 and summed with the amplifier's true output.
      <br/>
      The purpose of the peak detector 14 is to cancel the internal offset voltage of the peak detector 13.
    </p>
    <p num="18">The operation of the optical receiver of this invention will be described with reference to FIG. 4 by assuming that the same optical input signal is applied to the receiver as that of FIG. 2.</p>
    <p num="19">
      The input signal shown in part (a) of FIG. 4 is converted by the differential amplifier 12 to a pair of true and complementary varying waveforms as shown in part (b) of FIG. 4.
      <br/>
      Peak detector 13 detects peak voltages of the true output of amplifier 12 and peak detector 14 produces an output voltage corresponding to the constant level M of the voltage supply circuit 19 as shown in part (c) of FIG. 4.
      <br/>
      Adder 15 produces a sum of the true output of amplifier 12 and the constant level output of peak detector 14 and the adder 16 produces a sum of the complementary output of amplifier 12 and the peak level output of peak detector 13 as shown in part (d) of FIG. 4.
      <br/>
      Subtractor 17 produces a voltage representing the difference between the summed output voltages of adders 15 and 16 as shown in part (e) of FIG. 4 and compared by the decision circuit 18 with the threshold voltage Vth.
      <br/>
      Since the output of the peak detector 14 is constant, the difference voltage does not approach the threshold level when the input optical level remains at high level.
      <br/>
      The output of the decision circuit 18 thus contains no error pulses as shown in part (f) of FIG. 4.
      <br/>
      The bias current of the laser diode at the optical transmitter, not shown, is so adjusted that no ringing occurs when it is driven to low level.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the output signal of the decision circuit 18 is an accurate representation of the optical input level.

      The turn-on of switches M1 to M3 causes capacitors C5, C6 and C7 to be connected in parallel across the emitter and collector of transistor T6 to form a first peak detector.
      <br/>
      The turn-on of switch M4 establishes a connection between the emitter of transistor T12 to the adder 15, so that the output of the first peak detector is applied to the adder 15.
      <br/>
      The turn-on of switches M5 and M6 causes capacitors C3 and C4 to be connected in parallel with capacitor C2 across the emitter and collector of transistor T7 to form a second peak detector identical in characteristic to the first peak detector.
      <br/>
      The output of the second peak detector is supplied through transistor T10 and switch K2 to the adder 16.
      <br/>
      It is seen that, during the AC mode, the transistors T8 is disconnected from capacitor C5 and the transistor T11 is disconnected from the adder 15.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the AC-mode optical receiver operates in a characteristic identical to that shown in FIG. 2.
    </p>
    <p num="31">
      It is seen that, in DC mode, the peak detectors have low capacitance value and in AC mode their capacitance value is increased.
      <br/>
      The lower capacitance value of the DC mode makes the optical receiver quickly respond to the varying input level, while the higher capacitance value of the AC mode has the effect of reducing the leakage of the peak detectors.
