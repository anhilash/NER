    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">
      The present invention relates to the manufacture of substrates.
      <br/>
      More particularly, the invention provides a technique including a method and device for cleaving a substrate in the fabrication of a multi-layered substrate for semiconductor integrated circuits, for example.
      <br/>
      But it will be recognized that the invention has a wider range of applicability; it can also be applied to other substrates for multi-layered integrated circuit devices, three-dimensional packaging of integrated semiconductor devices, photonic devices, piezoelectronic devices, microelectromechanical systems ("MEMS"), sensors, actuators, solar cells, flat panel displays (e.g., LCD, AMLCD), biological and biomedical devices, and the like.
    </p>
    <p num="3">
      Craftsmen or more properly crafts-people have been building useful articles, tools, or devices using less useful materials for numerous years.
      <br/>
      In some cases, articles are assembled by way of smaller elements or building blocks.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, less useful articles are separated into smaller pieces to improve their utility.
      <br/>
      A common example of these articles to be separated include substrate structures such as a glass plate, a diamond, a semiconductor substrate, and others.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      These substrate structures are often cleaved or separated using a variety of techniques.
      <br/>
      In some cases, the substrates can be cleaved using a saw operation.
      <br/>
      The saw operation generally relies upon a rotating blade or tool, which cuts through the substrate material to separate the substrate material into two pieces.
      <br/>
      This technique, however, is often extremely "rough" and cannot generally be used for providing precision separations in the substrate for the manufacture of fine tools and assemblies.
      <br/>
      Additionally, the saw operation often has difficulty separating or cutting extremely hard and/or brittle materials such as diamond or glass.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      Accordingly, techniques have been developed to separate these hard and/or brittle materials using cleaving approaches.
      <br/>
      In diamond cutting, for example, an intense directional thermal/mechanical impulse is directed preferentially along a crystallographic plane of a diamond material.
      <br/>
      This thermal/mechanical impulse generally causes a cleave front to propagate along major crystallographic planes, where cleaving occurs when an energy level from the thermal/mechanical impulse exceeds the fracture energy level along the chosen crystallographic plane.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      In glass cutting, a scribe line using a tool is often impressed in a preferred direction on the glass material, which is generally amorphous in character.
      <br/>
      The scribe line causes a higher stress area surrounding the amorphous glass material.
      <br/>
      Mechanical force is placed on each side of the scribe line, which increases stress along the scribe line until the glass material fractures, preferably along the scribe line.
      <br/>
      This fracture completes the cleaving process of the glass, which can be used in a variety of applications including households.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      Although the techniques described above are satisfactory, for the most part, as applied to cutting diamonds or household glass, they have severe limitations in the fabrication of small complex structures or precision workpieces.
      <br/>
      For instance, the above techniques are often "rough" and cannot be used with great precision in fabrication of small and delicate machine tools, electronic devices, or the like.
      <br/>
      Additionally, the above techniques may be useful for separating one large plane of glass from another, but are often ineffective for splitting off, shaving, or stripping a thin film of material from a larger substrate.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, the above techniques may often cause more than one cleave front, which join along slightly different planes, which is highly undesirable for precision cutting applications.
    </p>
    <p num="8">From the above, it is seen that a technique for separating a thin film of material from a substrate which is cost effective and efficient is often desirable.</p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="9">
      According to the present invention, an improved technique for removing a thin film of material including devices (e.g., transistors, capacitors, resistors, inductors) from a substrate using a controlled cleaving action is provided.
      <br/>
      This technique allows an initiation of a cleaving process on a substrate using a single or multiple cleave region(s) through the use of controlled energy (e.g., spatial distribution) and selected conditions to allow an initiation of a cleave front(s) and to allow it to propagate through the substrate to remove a thin film of material from the substrate.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      In a specific embodiment, the present invention provides a method for fabricating electronic devices.
      <br/>
      The method includes providing a substrate.
      <br/>
      The substrate comprises a stressed layer at a selected depth underneath a surface of the substrate.
      <br/>
      The stressed layer is at the selected depth to define a substrate material to be removed above the selected depth.
      <br/>
      The stressed layer comprises a deposited layer and an implanted region.
      <br/>
      The material layer comprises a device layer overlying the stressed layer.
      <br/>
      The method also includes forming a plurality of integrated circuit devices on the substrate material.
      <br/>
      The forming comprises a thermal treatment process at a temperature greater than about 400 degrees Celsius, while maintaining a substantially microbubble free implanted region in the stressed layer.
      <br/>
      A step of providing energy to a selected region of the substrate to initiate a controlled cleaving action at the selected depth in the substrate is also included.
      <br/>
      The cleaving action is made using a propagating cleave front to free a portion of the material to be removed from the substrate.
    </p>
    <p num="11">
      Numerous benefits are achieved over pre-existing techniques using the present invention.
      <br/>
      In particular, the present invention uses controlled energy and selected conditions to preferentially cleave a thin film of material from a donor substrate which includes multi-material sandwiched films.
      <br/>
      This cleaving process selectively removes the thin film of material from the substrate while preventing a possibility of damage to the film or a remaining portion of the substrate.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, the remaining substrate portion can be re-used repeatedly for other applications.
    </p>
    <p num="12">
      Additionally, the present invention uses a relatively low temperature during the controlled cleaving process of the thin film to reduce temperature excursions of the separated film, donor substrate, or multi-material films according to other embodiments.
      <br/>
      In most cases, the controlled cleaving process can occur at, for example, room temperature, as well as others.
      <br/>
      This lower temperature approach allows for more material and process latitude such as, for example, cleaving and bonding of materials having substantially different thermal expansion coefficients.
      <br/>
      In other embodiments, the present invention limits energy or stress in the substrate to a value below a cleave initiation energy, which generally removes a possibility of creating random cleave initiation sites or fronts.
      <br/>
      This reduces cleave damage (e.g., pits, crystalline defects, breakage, cracks, steps, voids, excessive roughness) often caused in pre-existing techniques.
      <br/>
      Moreover, the present invention reduces damage caused by higher than necessary stress or pressure effects and nucleation sites caused by the energetic particles as compared to pre-existing techniques.
    </p>
    <p num="13">
      The present invention achieves these benefits and others in the context of known process technology.
      <br/>
      However, a further understanding of the nature and advantages of the present invention may be realized by reference to the latter portions of the specification and attached drawings.

    <heading>DESCRIPTION OF THE SPECIFIC EMBODIMENTS</heading>
    <p num="15">
      The present invention provides a technique for removing a thin film of material from a substrate while preventing a possibility of damage to the thin material film and/or a remaining portion of the substrate.
      <br/>
      The thin film of material is attached to or can be attached to a target substrate to form, for example, a silicon-on-insulator wafer.
      <br/>
      The thin film of material can also be used for a variety of other applications.
      <br/>
      The invention will be better understood by reference to the Figs. and the descriptions below.
    </p>
    <p num="16">1. Controlled Cleaving Techniques</p>
    <p num="17">
      FIG. 1 is a simplified cross-sectional view diagram of a substrate 10 according to the present invention.
      <br/>
      The diagram is merely an illustration and should not limit the scope of the claims herein.
      <br/>
      As merely an example, substrate 10 is a silicon wafer which includes a material region 12 to be removed, which is a thin relatively uniform film derived from the substrate material.
      <br/>
      The silicon wafer 10 includes a top surface 14, a bottom surface 16, and a thickness 18.
      <br/>
      Substrate 10 also has a first side (side 1) and a second side (side 2) (which are also referenced below in the Figs.).
      <br/>
      Material region 12 also includes a thickness 20, within the thickness 18 of the silicon wafer.
      <br/>
      The present invention provides a novel technique for removing the material region 12 using the following sequence of steps.
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      In a specific embodiment, selected energetic particles implant 22 through the top surface 14 of the silicon wafer to a selected depth 24, which may define the thickness 20 of the material region 12, termed the thin film of material.
      <br/>
      A variety of techniques can be used to implant the energetic particles into the silicon wafer.
      <br/>
      These techniques include ion implantation using, for example, beam line ion implantation equipment manufactured from companies such as Applied Materials, Eaton Corporation, Varian, and others.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, implantation occurs using a plasma immersion ion implantation ("P PI I") technique.
      <br/>
      Examples of plasma immersion implantation techniques are described in "Recent Applications of Plasma Immersion Ion Implantation," Paul K. Chu, Chung Chan, and Nathan W. Cheung, SEMICONDUCTOR INTERNATIONAL, pp. 165-172, June 1996, and "Plasma Immersion Ion Implantation--A Fledgling Technique for Semiconductor Processing,", P. K. Chu, S. Qin, C. Chan, N. W. Cheung, and L. A. Larson, MATERIAL SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING REPORTS, A Review Journal, pp. 207-280, Volume R17, Nos. 6-7, (Nov. 30, 1996), which are both hereby incorporated by reference for all purposes.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, implantation can occur using ion shower.
      <br/>
      Of course, techniques used depend upon the application.
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      Depending upon the application, smaller mass particles are generally selected to reduce a possibility of damage to the material region 12.
      <br/>
      That is, smaller mass particles easily travel through the substrate material to the selected depth without substantially damaging the material region that the particles traverse through.
      <br/>
      For example, the smaller mass particles (or energetic particles) can be almost any charged (e.g., positive or negative) and/or neutral atoms or molecules, or electrons, or the like.
      <br/>
      In a specific embodiment, the particles can be neutral and/or charged particles including ions such as ions of hydrogen and its isotopes (i.e., deuterium), rare gas ions such as helium and its isotopes, and neon.
      <br/>
      The particles can also be derived from compounds such as gases, e.g., hydrogen gas, water vapor, methane, and hydrogen compounds, and other light atomic mass particles.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, the particles can be any combination of the above particles, and/or ions and/or molecular species and/or atomic species.
      <br/>
      The particles generally have sufficient kinetic energy to penetrate through the surface to the selected depth underneath the surface.
    </p>
    <p num="20">
      Using hydrogen as the implanted species into the silicon wafer as an example, the implantation process is performed using a specific set of conditions.
      <br/>
      Implantation dose ranges from about 1015 to about 1018 atoms/cm2, and preferably the dose is greater than about 1015 atoms/cm2.
      <br/>
      Implantation energy ranges from about 1 KeV to about 1 MeV , and is generally about 50 KeV.
      <br/>
      Implantation temperature ranges from about -200 to about 600 (degree)  C., and is preferably less than about 400 (degree)  C. to prevent a possibility of a substantial quantity of hydrogen ions from diffusing out of the implanted silicon wafer and annealing the implanted damage and stress.
      <br/>
      The hydrogen ions can be selectively introduced into the silicon wafer to the selected depth at an accuracy of about +/-0.03 to +/-0.05 microns.
      <br/>
      Of course, the type of ion used and process conditions depend upon the application.
    </p>
    <p num="21">
      Effectively, the implanted particles add stress or reduce fracture energy along a region parallel to the top surface of the substrate at the selected depth.
      <br/>
      The energies depend, in part, upon the implantation species and conditions.
      <br/>
      These particles reduce a fracture energy level of the substrate at the selected depth.
      <br/>
      This allows for a controlled cleave along the implanted plane at the selected depth.
      <br/>
      Implantation can occur under conditions such that the energy state of substrate at all internal locations is insufficient to initiate a non-reversible fracture (i.e., separation or cleaving) in the substrate material.
      <br/>
      It should be noted, however, that implantation does generally cause a certain amount of defects (e.g., micro-defects) in the substrate that can be repaired by subsequent heat treatment, e.g., thermal annealing or rapid thermal annealing.
    </p>
    <p num="22">
      FIGS. 1A to 1C are simplified diagrams of an alternative process for forming a stressed region, which is used to cleave a film of material from a substrate.
      <br/>
      These diagrams are merely examples, which should not limit the scope of the claims herein.
      <br/>
      One of ordinary skill in the art would recognize many other variations, alternatives, and modifications.
      <br/>
      Like reference numerals are used in these diagrams as others noted herein, but are not intended to be limiting.
      <br/>
      As merely an example, substrate 10 is a silicon wafer.

      The silicon wafer 10 includes a top surface 101 and a bottom surface 16.
      <br/>
      Substrate 10 also has a first side (side 1) and a second side (side 2).
      <br/>
      A stressed layer is formed overlying the top surface of substrate 10.
    </p>
    <p num="23">
      The stressed layer can be formed by a variety of techniques.
      <br/>
      The stressed layer can be formed using chemical vapor deposition, physical vapor deposition, molecular beam epitaxy ("MBE"), plating, and other techniques, which include any combination of these.
      <br/>
      The stressed layer is preferably a silicon alloy, such as silicon germanium or silicon germanium.
      <br/>
      The silicon germanium layer has a stoichiometry of Six Gey, where x and y are selectively adjusted during deposition.
      <br/>
      Adjustment can occur by changing flow rates of respective mass flow controllers.
      <br/>
      The ratio of silicon to germanium is selectively adjusted to provide a desired cleaving action according to the present invention.
      <br/>
      The stressed layer can also be an epitaxial silicon layer.
      <br/>
      The epitaxial silicon layer is made using an epitaxial reactor.
      <br/>
      An example of such a reactor is an epi-Centur (tm)  reactor made by Applied Materials, Inc. of Santa Clara, Calif.
      <br/>
      Other reactors such as those made by ASM and other companies can also be used.
      <br/>
      Other materials can also be used.
      <br/>
      Optionally, the stressed layer is a multiple layered structure 103A according to an embodiment of the present invention.
      <br/>
      The multiple or multilayered structure can include a combination of compressional layers and tensile layers.
      <br/>
      The present multiple layered structure can be formed by distinct layers or graded layers, depending upon the application.
      <br/>
      In other embodiments, one or each of these layers can also be doped using in-situ deposition techniques and/or implantation techniques, as will be discussed below.
      <br/>
      Here, particles are implanted into the silicon substrate around the stressed layer.
      <br/>
      Implantation can include introducing particles or impurities such as hydrogen, deuterium, helium, nitrogen, boron, and other species, which selectively provides a tensile or compressive characteristic to the layer.
      <br/>
      Other techniques such as in-situ doping and/or diffusion of impurities can also be used to introduce impurities into any one of the layers.

      Overlying the stressed layer is a material layer 105, which can be formed by a variety of techniques.

      In a specific embodiment, the material layer is a layer where the device or devices are formed thereon.
      <br/>
      The material layer is a high quality layer of silicon for example.
      <br/>
      The material layer can be deposited using chemical vapor deposition, MBE, physical vapor deposition, plating, and other techniques, which include any combination of these.
      <br/>
      In a preferred embodiment, the material layer is a crystalline silicon layer or epitaxial silicon layer.
      <br/>
      The epitaxial silicon layer is made by depositing epitaxial silicon that may be doped using one or more dopants.
      <br/>
      These dopants include among others, boron, phosphorous, arsenic, and oxygen or any combination thereof.

      In some embodiments, particles are introduced through upper surface 14 into the stressed layer 103, as shown in a simplified diagram of FIG. 2.

      <br/>
      One of ordinary skill in the art would recognize many other variations, modifications, and alternatives.
      <br/>
      Here, particles 201 are implanted through surface 14 to the stressed layer 103 to form a combination of stressed and implanted layer 203, as shown in FIG. 3.
      <br/>
      Depending upon the application, smaller mass particles are generally selected to reduce a possibility of damage to the material region 105.
      <br/>
      That is, smaller mass particles easily travel through the substrate material to the selected depth without substantially damaging the material region that the particles traverse through.
      <br/>
      For example, the smaller mass particles (or energetic particles) can be almost any charged (e.g., positive or negative) and/or neutral atoms or molecules, or electrons, or the like.
      <br/>
      In a specific embodiment, the particles can be neutral and/or charged particles including ions such as ions of hydrogen and its isotopes (i.e., deuterium), rare gas ions such as helium and its isotopes, and neon.
      <br/>
      The particles can also be derived from compounds such as gases, e.g., hydrogen gas, water vapor, methane, and hydrogen compounds, and other light atomic mass particles.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, the particles can be any combination of the above particles, and/or ions and/or molecular species and/or atomic species.
      <br/>
      The particles generally have sufficient kinetic energy to penetrate through the surface to the selected depth underneath the surface.

      Using hydrogen as the implanted species into the silicon wafer as an example, the implantation process is performed using a specific set of conditions.
      <br/>
      Implantation dose ranges from about 1015 to about 1018 atoms/cm2, and preferably the dose is greater than about 5 * 1015 atoms/cm2.
      <br/>
      Implantation energy ranges from about 1 KeV to about 1 MeV , and is generally about 30 KeV.
      <br/>
      Implantation temperature ranges from about -200 to about 600 (degree)  C., and is preferably less than about 400 (degree)  C. to prevent a possibility of a substantial quantity of hydrogen ions from diffusing out of the implanted silicon wafer and annealing the implanted damage and stress.
      <br/>
      The hydrogen ions can be selectively introduced into the silicon wafer to -the selected depth at an accuracy of about +/-0.03 to +/-0.05 microns.
      <br/>
      Of course, the type of ion used and process conditions depend upon the application.

      Effectively, the implanted particles add additional stress or reduce fracture energy along a region parallel to the top surface of the substrate at the selected depth.
      <br/>
      The energies depend, in part, upon the implantation species and conditions.
      <br/>
      These particles reduce a fracture energy level of the substrate at the selected depth.
      <br/>
      This allows for a controlled cleave along the implanted plane at the selected depth.
      <br/>
      Implantation can occur under conditions such that the energy state of substrate at all internal locations is insufficient to initiate a non-reversible fracture (i.e., separation or cleaving) in the substrate material.
      <br/>
      It should be noted, however, that implantation does generally cause a certain amount of defects (e.g., micro-defects) in the substrate that can be repaired by subsequent heat treatment, e.g., thermal annealing or rapid thermal annealing.

      The diagram illustrates concentration of particles on the vertical axis, which is plotted against depth from the top surface of the material layer 105.

      The depth increases through the material layer 105, through the stressed layer 103, and through the substrate 10.
      <br/>
      The implant profile includes a maximum region 203, which may or may not be along a center region of the stressed layer.
      <br/>
      The stressed region preferably cleaves along a region away from the maximum region 203 according to the present invention.
      <br/>
      The stressed region cleaves at, for example, z1, which is away from the maximum region.
      <br/>
      In the following discussion, the material layer is removed or cleaved from the stressed layer using a controlled cleaving action.

      The material layer can also be formed using an in-situ doping process, which can be homogeneous or graded, depending upon the application.
      <br/>
      Depending upon the application, many implant distributions may exist.
      <br/>
      For example, the implant distribution can have a single maximum, where the maximum is symmetrical or offset to one side or the other side.

      Alternatively, the distribution can be shaped like a pulse.

    <p num="45">
      Although the embodiments in this specification are in terms of general implanting techniques, controlled cleaving can be enhanced by way of patterned implanting techniques according to the present invention.
      <br/>
      Patterned implanting techniques are used to selectively introduce impurities into the substrate using a desired or selected pattern, which enhances the control for the cleaving process.
      <br/>
      FIGS. 12-20 illustrate a few examples of implanting techniques according to this embodiment of the present invention.
      <br/>
      These Figs. are merely illustrations and should not limit the scope of the claims herein.
      <br/>
      One of ordinary skill in the art would recognize other variations, alternatives, and modifications.

      FIG. 12 is a simplified cross-sectional view diagram 1200 of an implanting step using a patterned mask 1201 according to the present invention.
      <br/>
      The patterned mask is merely an illustration and should not limit the scope of the claims herein.
      <br/>
      Patterned mask 1201 is a shadow mask, but also can be others.
      <br/>
      The patterned implanting step 1203 provides a patterned distribution 1205 of particles at a selected depth (z0).
      <br/>
      For instance, the patterned mask can be applied directly to the substrate using photolithographic techniques.
      <br/>
      An example of numerous photographic techniques are described in "Semiconductor Lithography, Principles, Practices, and Materials," Wayne M. Moreau, Plenum Press (1988), which is hereby incorporated by reference for all purposes.

    <p num="47">
      Optionally, the present method uses a blanket implanting step 1300 of the substrate surface after the patterned implanting step described, as illustrated by FIG. 13. The blanket implanting step provides a uniform distribution of particles through the surface of the substrate to a selected depth (z0).
      <br/>
      An example of a distribution of particles in the substrate after a two-step implanting process using patterned and blanket implanting steps is illustrated by the simplified diagram of FIG. 14. As shown, the diagram 1400 has a vertical axis representing particle concentration at the selected depth (z0), and has a horizontal axis representing distance from side 1 of the substrate to side 2 of the substrate.
      <br/>
      Using the two-step process described above, which includes a blanket implanting step and a patterned implanting step, concentration distribution 1401 through the cleave plane from side 1 to side 2 of the substrate various periodically and spatially from C1 to C2.
      <br/>
      Depending upon the technique for cleaving the substrate, various patterns can be used, and are illustrated by FIGS. 15-18.

    <p num="48">
      FIG. 15 is a simplified top-view diagram 1500 of an annular distribution of particles according to the present invention.
      <br/>
      This distribution of particles includes a lower concentration region 1505 and a higher concentration region 1501.
      <br/>
      The higher concentration region 1501 is defined in concentric annular patterns around a center region 1503 of the substrate.
      <br/>
      As shown, the annular patterns are defined symmetrically around the center of the substrate and have a plurality of annular regions which are placed next to each other in a constant spatial frequency.
      <br/>
      The annular patterns tend to enhance the controlled cleaving action according to some embodiments of the present invention.
    </p>
    <p num="49">
      Alternatively, the distribution of particles in the substrate can be in a linear pattern 1600, as illustrated by FIG. 16. As shown, the substrate includes particles having higher and lower concentrations in regions 1601 and 1603, respectively.
      <br/>
      The linear pattern has regions (i.e., lines) of higher concentration.
      <br/>
      The regions also have similar widths, but can include other widths.
      <br/>
      Additionally, the linear pattern has regions (i.e., lines) of lower concentration.
      <br/>
      The lower concentration regions have similar widths, but also can include other widths.
      <br/>
      Again, this pattern is likely to enhance the controlled cleaving action according to embodiments of the present invention.

      Alternatively, FIG. 17 is a simplified top-view diagram 1700 of a "checker board" pattern of particles according to an alternative aspect of the present invention.

      The diagram 1700 illustrates a higher concentration region 1701 and a lower concentration region 1705.
      <br/>
      Higher concentration regions include vertical lines 102 and horizontal lines 1703, which are disposed at a relatively constant spacial frequency.
      <br/>
      Of course, the use of this pattern will depend upon the particular application.

    <p num="51">
      Alternatively, FIG. 18 is a simplified top-view diagram 1800 of a "webbed" or "dart board" pattern of particles according to yet an alternative embodiment of the present invention.
      <br/>
      This pattern 1800 includes concentric annular regions 1801 of higher concentration, and other higher concentration regions 1803 (i.e, lines) which intersect the annular regions.
      <br/>
      Lower concentration regions 1805 are also shown.
      <br/>
      The annular regions have a spatial frequency that is relatively constant, but can also be others, i.e. non-constant.

      FIGS. 19-20 are simplified top-view diagrams 1900, 2000 of still further particle distributions according to the present invention.
      <br/>
      These distributions of particles do not have features of constant spatial frequency.
      <br/>
      In particular, the diagram 1900 of FIG. 19 has a higher concentration region 1901 which has a higher density of particles on one side 1903 of the substrate as compared to the other side 1905 of the substrate.
      <br/>
      The higher concentration region 1903 includes a plurality of lines, which have different sized widths (but can also be similar).
      <br/>
      Additionally, lower concentration regions 1905 have a larger spatial distribution on one side 1905 of the substrate as compared to the other side 1903 of the substrate.
      <br/>
      The higher concentration regions 1901 do not generally run parallel to each other but diverge from each other as they run from one side 1903 of the substrate to the other side 1905 of the substrate.
      <br/>
      The diagram 2000 of FIG. 20 has a plurality of "wavy" higher concentration regions 2001 that run relatively parallel to each other from one side of the substrate to the other side of the substrate.
      <br/>
      As shown, the higher concentration regions 2001 are a plurality of wavy lines.
      <br/>
      These lines each have a relatively similar width, but do not have to.
      <br/>
      Lower concentration regions 2003 are defined between the higher concentration regions.
      <br/>
      Depending upon the particular cleaving technique, these patterns can be used.
    </p>
    <p num="53">
      In a specific embodiment, the patterned implant can also be made in a selected manner to prevent a possibility of detachment during conventional high temperature processes.
      <br/>
      As merely an example, the patterned implant occurs where at least fifty percent or greater of the exposed surface area of the substrate is substantially free from any implant by way of a protective masking layer.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, the substrate can be exposed or can undergo conventional semiconductor processing or the like.
      <br/>
      Separation of the film occurs by adding additional energy to the substrate by way of the present controlled cleaving process to induce the separation process.
      <br/>
      This separation process generally cannot occur merely by way of thermal treatment.
    </p>
    <p num="54">
      Although the description above is in terms of a two-step implanting process for creating the distribution of particles in the substrate.
      <br/>
      The process can be a single step process, as well as multi-step processes using an combination of the above patterns and others.
      <br/>
      Of course, the particular sequence of implanting steps used depends upon the application.
    </p>
    <p num="55">3. Patterned Film Transfer Process</p>
    <p num="56">In a specific embodiment, a process according to the present invention for fabricating the multi-layered structure can be defined as follows:</p>
    <p num="57">(1) Provide a donor silicon wafer without any active devices thereon (which may be coated with a dielectric material);</p>
    <p num="58">(2) Introduce a selected pattern of particles into the silicon wafer to a selected depth to define a thickness of silicon film;</p>
    <p num="59">(3) Anneal the silicon wafer to fix the particles;</p>
    <p num="60">(4) Perform conventional device processing on the silicon wafer in the silicon film;</p>
    <p num="61">(5) Provide transfer substrate;</p>
    <p num="62">(6) Join transfer substrate with the implanted face of the donor silicon wafer;</p>
    <p num="63">(7) Increase global stress (or energy) of implanted region at selected depth without initiating a cleaving action (optional);</p>
    <p num="64">(8) Provide stress (or energy) to a selected region to initiate a controlled cleaving action at the selected depth;</p>
    <p num="65">(9) Provide additional energy to the bonded substrates to sustain the controlled cleaving action to free the thickness of silicon film from the silicon wafer (optional);</p>
    <p num="66">(10) Provide a target substrate material (which may be coated with a dielectric material);</p>
    <p num="67">(11) Bond the donor silicon wafer to the target substrate material by joining the cleaved face to the target substrate material;</p>
    <p num="68">(12) Complete bonding of donor silicon wafer to the target substrate;</p>
    <p num="69">(13) Remove transfer wafer from thickness of silicon film on target substrate;</p>
    <p num="70">(14) Repeat steps (1) to (13) above to form another layer of active devices on the target substrate material.</p>
    <p num="71">
      The above sequence of steps provides yet a further process for forming a multi-layered substrate.
      <br/>
      In this process, an implanted substrate is formed, where the implant is made in a pattern.
      <br/>
      The pattern creates regions where substantially no particles have been implanted, which prevents any detachment of a film of material from the substrate during a conventional thermal process, e.g., annealing.
      <br/>
      Active devices are formed on the implanted substrate.
      <br/>
      The active devices are then cleaved from the substrate using a controlled cleaving action by way of a pressurized fluid or the like.
      <br/>
      Other techniques can also be used to from the active devices from the substrate.
      <br/>
      These techniques have been described herein, but are not limited.
      <br/>
      Of course, one or ordinary skill in the art would recognize other variations, modifications, and alternatives.
    </p>
    <p num="72">
      Although the above description is in terms of a silicon wafer, other substrates may also be used.
      <br/>
      For example, the substrate can be almost any monocrystalline, polycrystalline, or even amorphous type substrate.
      <br/>
      Additionally, the substrate can be made of III/V materials such as gallium arsenide, gallium nitride (GaN), and others.
      <br/>
      The multi-layered substrate can also be used according to the present invention.
      <br/>
      The multi-layered substrate includes a silicon-on-insulator substrate, a variety of sandwiched layers on a semiconductor substrate, and numerous other types of substrates.
      <br/>
      Additionally, the embodiments above were generally in terms of providing a pulse of energy to initiate a controlled cleaving action.
      <br/>
      The pulse can be replaced by energy that is scanned across a selected region of the substrate to initiate the controlled cleaving action.
      <br/>
      Energy can also be scanned across selected regions of the substrate to sustain or maintain the controlled cleaving action.
    </p>
    <p num="73">
      Further, the above has generally been described in terms of implanting particles to form a cleaving surface.
      <br/>
      The particles can be replaced by any stressed layer.
      <br/>
      The stressed layer can be formed by chemical vapor deposition, physical vapor deposition, molecular beam epitaxy, and other techniques to form a multilayered structure, where the stressed layer can be one or more layers and an overlying material layer is a device layer.
      <br/>
      Here, the final multilayered substrate includes a bulk substrate material, an overlying stressed layer (which can be multiple layers), and an overlying device material layer, e.g., epitaxial layer, molecular beam layer.
      <br/>
      The device layer is the layer where devices are to be formed using, for example, conventional processes, which may or may not include high temperature processes.
      <br/>
      An example of such a stressed layer is described in U.S. Ser. No. 09/370,975commonly assigned, and hereby incorporated by reference for all purposes.
