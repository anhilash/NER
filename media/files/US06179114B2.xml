    <heading>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading>
    <p num="15">
      The invention is further described by way of example with reference to the accompanying drawings in which:
      <br/>
      FIG. 1 is a cross-sectional side view of a torsion holder according to the invention,
      <br/>
      FIG. 2 is a sectioned perspective view of the torsion holder shown in FIG. 1, and
      <br/>
      FIG. 3 is an end view of the torsion holder of the invention.
    </p>
    <heading>DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading>
    <p num="16">The accompanying drawings illustrate a torsion holder 10 according to the invention which includes a first or outer tubular member 12, a second or inner member 14, two bosses 16 and 18 respectively, and a scraper blade carrier 20.</p>
    <p num="17">The outer tubular member 12 is formed from two components designated 12A and 12B respectively which have mating complementary formations 22 which enable the components to be interengaged with each other.</p>
    <p num="18">As is evident from FIGS. 2 and 3 each component 12A, 12B, has a square cross-section and, at each respective end remote from the formations 22, each component has an enlarged circular socket 24A, 24B.</p>
    <p num="19">The inner member 14, as is shown in FIG. 3, also has a square cross-section although its orientation, relatively to the outer member, is displaced by 45 (degree)  in the axial sense.</p>
    <p num="20">
      The bosses 16 and 18 are similar in construction.
      <br/>
      Each boss, at a region marked 26, has formations which engage securely with complementary formations on a surrounding section of the blade carrier 20.
    </p>
    <p num="21">
      Also, at a region marked 28, each boss has a square cross-section which engages securely with a respective end of the inner member 14 which, in this example, has a tubular construction.
      <br/>
      On the other hand each boss has a section 30A, 30B respectively which extends into one of the sockets 24A, 24B and this section is circular so that it acts as a bearing surface inside the recess.
      <br/>
      Thus the blade carrier 20 is rotatable, at least to a limited extent, in unison with the bosses which are fixed to the blade carrier and the member 14, relatively to the member 12.
    </p>
    <p num="22">O-ring seals 32A and 32B respectively are positioned between the bosses 16 and 18 and the sockets 24A and 24B.</p>
    <p num="23">
      The components 12A and 12B of the outer member have outwardly extending legs 34, 36.
      <br/>
      These legs are engageable with a sliding fit in a channel 38 of complementary shape which forms part of a suitable support structure, as is indicated schematically in FIG. 3.
    </p>
    <p num="24">
      The blade carrier 20 includes an upper groove or slot 40 which, in use, receives the base of a conveyor belt scraper, not shown.
      <br/>
      Fixing holes 42 accommodate bolts which secure the scraper blade to the slot.
    </p>
    <p num="25">
      Two protective skirts 44 and 46 extend downwardly from the slot.
      <br/>
      The skirts are internally braced by means of a rib 48 and the volume between the ribs is sealed by means of end walls 50 and 52 which are suitably shaped to receive the bosses 16 and 18 respectively, in the manner which has been described.
    </p>
    <p num="26">
      Referring to FIG. 3 rubber torsion elements 54, which are generally triangular in cross-section, are positioned inside respective volumes or open spaced formations between the apices of the outer member 12 and opposing flat outer surfaces of the inner member 14.
      <br/>
      The torsion elements, when compressed, permit limited rotational movement of the member 14 relatively to the member 12, in an axial sense, and exert a restoring force which tends to restore the member 14 to the orientation, relative to the member 12 shown in FIG. 3.
    </p>
    <p num="27">
      In use the torsion holder is mounted, in the manner illustrated in FIG. 3, to a suitable support structure having the channel 38 and a blade, not shown, is engaged with the slot 40.
      <br/>
      The blade is brought into engagement with a surface of a conveyor belt, not shown, which is to be scraped.
      <br/>
      This aspect is known and for this reason is not elaborated on herein.
    </p>
    <p num="28">
      During operation of the conveyor belt scraper, forces are exerted on the scraper blade by the conveyor belt which cause the blade carrier 20 to rotate about the central axis 60 of the assembly, referred to in FIG. 3.
      <br/>
      The rotational movement is damped by the torsion elements 54 which, as has been noted, exert a restoring force which returns the blade carrier to the central position shown in FIG. 3.
    </p>
    <p num="29">
      The sockets 24A and 24B and the circular sections 30A and 30B respectively of the bushes, act as bearing surfaces and permit guided rotational movement of the inner member relatively to the outer member.
      <br/>
      The O-ring seals 32A and 32B restrict the ingress of foreign material into the spaces between the two members.
      <br/>
      The protective skirts 44 and 46 also protect the interior of the assembly against the ingress of foreign material.
      <br/>
      Further, as is evident from an inspection of FIGS. 1 and 2, the bosses 16 and 18 are intimately engaged with the side walls 50 and 52 and the ingress of foreign material through the spaces between the interfacing surfaces of these components is also restricted.
    </p>
    <p num="30">The various components of the torsion holder are made from any suitable material, and preferably are injection moulded from a plastics material with desirable properties.</p>
