    <heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">The present invention relates to therapeutic compositions for treating attention deficit disorder (ADD) and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in children and adults, and more particularly to a single dose therapeutic composition comprising all-natural herbs and antioxidants.</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="3">
      Attention Deficit Disorder (ADD) and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) are among the most common mental disorders among children.
      <br/>
      ADHD also often continues into adolescence and adulthood.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      ADD and ADHD are diagnoses applied to children and adults who consistently display certain characteristic behaviors over a period of time.
      <br/>
      The most common behaviors include inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      Inattentive behavior is often characterized by difficulty focusing on one task and persisting until completion, a failure to pay attention to details, and making careless mistakes in a variety of tasks.
      <br/>
      Individuals exhibiting inattentive behavior may appear as if their minds are elsewhere or they are not listening or did not hear what has just been said.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      Hyperactive people always seem to be in motion and may suffer from feelings of restlessness and difficulty engaging in sedentary activities.
      <br/>
      Common signs of hyperactivity include excessive unproductive movement, such as fidgeting with hands or feet, excessive talking, and an inability to sit still.
      <br/>
      Hyperactive children often squirm in their seats, roam around the room, and feel compelled to touch everything.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      Impatience and a failure to think before acting often characterize impulsivity.
      <br/>
      Impulsive young children may frequently interrupt others, fail to listen to directions, and have difficulty waiting their turn.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      Scientists have not yet identified a single underlying cause behind these behavior characteristics.
      <br/>
      While some have been linked to decreased brain activity, the biological reason for the decreased brain activity is still unknown.
      <br/>
      Treatment for ADD and ADHD is therefore limited to treating the symptoms of the disorders.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      The most common treatment for ADD and ADHD is the use of mild central nervous system stimulant drugs, such as Ritalin, Cylert, and Dexedrine.
      <br/>
      However, there are several drawbacks to using these drugs.
      <br/>
      Frequent short-term side effects include loss of appetite, insomnia, headaches, stomachaches, drowsiness, hyperactivity, blood pressure and pulse changes, and cardiac arrhythmia.
      <br/>
      In addition, little is known about the possible consequences of long-term exposure to these drugs in children.
      <br/>
      The use of Ritalin in children under six years of age is particularly undesirable since safety and efficacy in this age group has not been established.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      As an alternative to the aforementioned conventional treatments, U.S. Pat. No. 5,719,178 discloses a method of treating ADHD utilizing proanthocyanidin.
      <br/>
      The method comprises taking a quantity of proanthocyanidin sufficient to relieve symptoms of ADHD every approximately 3.5 to 4.0 hours.
      <br/>
      A heterocyclic antidepressant may be taken with the proanthocyanidin to relieve symptoms of "spaciness" or lack of cognitive focus.
      <br/>
      However, a major drawback of this method is that repeated doses are required to alleviate symptoms throughout the day.
      <br/>
      Requiring repeated doses may be inconvenient as well as embarrassing, especially for school-aged children.
    </p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="11">
      Thus, it is the purpose of the present invention to provide an all-natural therapeutic composition for treating symptoms associated with ADD and ADHD comprising proanthocyanidin, yucca, hawthorn, bilberry, silymarin complex, and ginkgo biloba.
      <br/>
      It is also a purpose of the present invention to provide a method of use for the therapeutic composition of the present invention.
    </p>
    <heading>DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
    <p num="12">
      The therapeutic composition of the present invention is an herbal remedy for alleviating symptoms of ADD and ADHD.
      <br/>
      The composition includes six natural herbs and antioxidants: proanthocyanidin, yucca schidigera, bilberry, hawthorn, silymarin complex, and ginkgo biloba.
      <br/>
      The inventor has discovered that these herbs and antioxidants work effectively together to alleviate symptoms of ADD and ADHD when administered on a daily basis.
      <br/>
      Proanthocyanidin is an extract from the bark of European coastal pine trees, commonly referred to by the trade name "Pycnogenol".
      <br/>
      It is a flavonoid and a powerful antioxidant, neutralizing free radicals in the body which result in strengthened blood vessels and improved circulation.
      <br/>
      Proanthocyanidin is water-soluble and easily absorbed by the body, making it more effective than many other commonly prescribed flavonoids.
      <br/>
      In addition, it is important for brain function, since it is one of the few dietary antioxidants that readily crosses the blood-brain barrier.
    </p>
    <p num="13">
      Yucca schidigera (Yucca) is a member of the lily family and the root is used for several therapeutic purposes.
      <br/>
      It is a useful treatment for chronic degenerative diseases and joint inflammation due to its ability to break up inorganic mineral obstructions and deposits.
      <br/>
      Yucca root extract also works to clean the colon and regulate colonic bacteria, reducing the burden on other eliminative systems of the body.
      <br/>
      Yucca is rich in vitamin A, B-complex, and vitamin C, and is a good source of calcium, copper, manganese, potassium and phosphorous.
    </p>
    <p num="14">
      Bilberry is a perennial ornamental shrub commonly found in a variety of climates.
      <br/>
      In the United States, bilberries are known as huckleberries.
      <br/>
      The bilberry fruit contains flavonoids and anthocyanin, a natural antioxidant.
      <br/>
      Bioflavonoids are also extremely efficient antioxidants and assist the body in countering the harmful effects of free radicals.
      <br/>
      Anthocyanin strengthens the body's small blood vessels, lowers blood pressure, reduces clotting, and improves circulation through larger blood vessels.
      <br/>
      Bilberry also contains gluoquinine that has the ability to lower blood sugar.
    </p>
    <p num="15">
      Bilberry has been shown to improve visual accuracy in healthy people and to help those with eye diseases such as pigmentosa, retinitis, glaucoma, and myopia.
      <br/>
      Bilberry has also been used as a treatment for diarrhea, nausea, and indigestion.
    </p>
    <p num="16">
      Hawthorn is obtained from the berries of the hawthorn tree.
      <br/>
      It is known to positively affect the cardiovascular system and is also used to treat digestive problems and insomnia.
      <br/>
      Hawthorn works as a vasodilator, increasing blood and oxygen flow to the heart and lowering blood pressure.
      <br/>
      By increasing the efficiency of the heart, hawthorn also increases blood flow to the rest of the body.
      <br/>
      Components in hawthorn have been shown to lower cholesterol and the amount of plaque in arteries.
    </p>
    <p num="17">
      Silymarin complex is found in the seeds of the Milk Thistle plant flower.
      <br/>
      It is most commonly used to protect and rejuvenate the liver.
      <br/>
      Silymarin exerts a membrane-stabilizing action preventing or inhibiting membrane peroxidation.
      <br/>
      Silymarin binds to liver cells, creating a shield against other liver-harming substances.
      <br/>
      In addition to shielding the liver, silymarin complex helps synthesize new proteins and ultimately regenerate damaged liver cells.
      <br/>
      Silymarin is used to halt or reverse liver damage from alcohol, pesticides, mushroom poisoning, and hepatitis.
      <br/>
      Silymarin also helps with the digestion of fats.
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      Ginkgo Biloba (Ginkgo) is obtained from the leaf of the ginkgo tree.
      <br/>
      Ginkgo works by increasing blood flow to the brain and blood vessels, resulting in higher oxygen levels in the brain.
      <br/>
      Benefits of enhanced circulation in the brain include improved short and long term memory, improved mental clarity, and increased energy levels.
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      It has been found that the therapeutic composition is useful in treating the symptoms of ADD and ADHD, without any adverse side effects.
      <br/>
      A single daily dose, taken in the morning effectively alleviates symptoms of ADD and ADHD throughout the entire day.
    </p>
    <p num="20">In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the therapeutic composition comprises the following herbs shown in percentages by weight of the total composition:</p>

    <p num="24">The invention is illustrated in the following examples wherein the composition was administered as a single daily dosage in the indicated quantities:</p>
    <p num="25">EXAMPLE 1</p>
    <p num="26">
      The therapeutic composition for the weight range 30-50 lbs. was administered to a four-year-old boy.
      <br/>
      The boy had been diagnosed with a learning disorder and exhibited symptoms of ADD and ADHD.
      <br/>
      Starting at about age 2, several therapies were tried prior to using the composition of the invention, including a restrictive diet with mega multi-vitamins for about nine months, with no success.
      <br/>
      Subsequently, high doses of magnesium and B6 were tried for approximately eight months, also with no improvement.
      <br/>
      Another therapy of administering high doses of Pycnogenol alone for approximately six months also failed to relieve the symptoms.
      <br/>
      Within approximately six weeks of administering the therapeutic composition of the present invention, a dramatic improvement was seen.
      <br/>
      The boy's ability to remain seated, follow through on instructions, and play or work quietly was greatly improved.
      <br/>
      In addition, he was less fidgety and better able to focus on schoolwork.
      <br/>
      After taking the composition for almost five years, the results of a single missed dose are immediate.
      <br/>
      The boy becomes cranky, fidgety and emotionally unbalanced.
      <br/>
      The dosage was increased to that of the 50-90 lb. range when the boy's weight exceeded 50 lbs.
    </p>
    <p num="27">EXAMPLE 2</p>
    <p num="28">
      The therapeutic composition, for the weight range 90-120 lbs., was administered to a ten-year old boy diagnosed with ADHD.
      <br/>
      After approximately four weeks on the therapeutic composition, the symptoms of ADHD were significantly lessened.
    </p>
    <p num="29">EXAMPLE 3</p>
    <p num="30">
      The therapeutic composition, for the weight range 90-120 lbs. was administered to a ten-year old boy diagnosed with ADHD.
      <br/>
      Favorable results were seen after five weeks on the composition.
    </p>
    <p num="31">EXAMPLE 4</p>
    <p num="32">
      The therapeutic composition, for the weight range 90-120 lbs. was administered to an eleven-year old boy diagnosed with ADHD.
      <br/>
      Some positive effects were seen after ten days and within another week alleviation of the symptoms was consistent.
    </p>
    <p num="33">EXAMPLE 5</p>
    <p num="34">
      A thirteen-year old boy and a fourteen-year old boy, diagnosed with ADHD, were each given the therapeutic composition for the 90-120 lb. weight range.
      <br/>
      Both achieved favorable results within approximately five weeks.
    </p>
    <p num="35">EXAMPLE 6</p>
    <p num="36">
      The therapeutic composition for the weight range 90-120 lbs. was administered to a female adult diagnosed with ADHD.
      <br/>
      After approximately three weeks, an increase in concentration and greater ability to generate sequenced thoughts was noticed.
      <br/>
      In addition, she reported having much more focus and was able to follow through and complete tasks.
    </p>
    <p num="37">EXAMPLE 7</p>
    <p num="38">
      The therapeutic composition for the weight range 90-120 lbs. was administered to a female adult.
      <br/>
      Within 10 days, the woman reported favorable results including feeling calmer.
      <br/>
      After taking the composition for a month the woman reported feeling "normal."
    </p>
    <p num="39">EXAMPLE 8</p>
    <p num="40">
      The therapeutic composition, for weights 150 lbs. and over, was administered to an adult male diagnosed with ADHD.
      <br/>
      After approximately three weeks, he reported experiencing relief from the ADHD symptoms.
      <br/>
      He also reported being much more alert and generally functioning more efficiently in his everyday tasks.
    </p>
    <p num="41">EXAMPLE 9</p>
    <p num="42">
      The therapeutic composition, for weights 150 lbs. and over, was administered to an adult male diagnosed with ADHD.
      <br/>
      In less than two months, the man was performing better at work, and acting more responsibly and more focused.
      <br/>
      After achieving positive results, the man stopped taking the composition.
      <br/>
      Within three days of stopping the treatment, the man became irritable and forgetful.
