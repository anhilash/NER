    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="1">(1) Field of the Invention</p>
    <p num="2">The present invention relates to a surface-treating method of screw parts which method comprises coating beforehand a highly insulating organic resin based coating composition onto a thread of screw parts to be mounted onto an automobile body by welding.</p>
    <p num="3">(2) Description of the Background Art</p>
    <p num="4">
      In the field of an assembly of an automobile, for example, a fastening method by use of a combination of a nut with a welded bolt, or a bolt with a welded nut has been known in the art.
      <br/>
      That is, a normal fastening method comprises mounting the bolt or the nut by welding onto a body, chassis, suspension and the like, followed by coating and fastening with a nut or bolt respectively, and the normal fastening method has widely been used as a method having high workability, because welding of either the bolt or the nut makes the use of a detent unnecessary.
      <br/>
      After mounting the bolt or the nut by welding, however, spatters, i.e. molten metal droplets due to a welding operation carried out therearound may be scattered and adhered onto the thread of the screw parts, or a catianic electrodeposition coating film formed as an undercoating for the automobile body is thickly deposited on the thread, resulting in producing on fastening various troubles such as an abnormal increase in a screwed torque, development of an abnormal biting and the like because of resistance to fastening by the adhered spatter and the deposited electrodeposition coating film.
      <br/>
      For the purpose of preventing the above troubles, there is known in the art a method of masking the thread so that adhesion of the spatter onto, or penetration of the coating composition into the thread of the bolt or nut may be prevented.
      <br/>
      However, the above method has such drawbacks that in the actual production line, the application and removal of a mask require many manhours, resulting in reducing an assembly efficiency, and in that development of a more efficient method is demanded.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      For the purpose of solving the above problems, there is also known in the art a method of coating beforehand a tetrafluoroethylene powder onto the thread of the screw parts.
      <br/>
      However, the method has such a drawback that a coated film shows poor properties in adhesion properties and wear resistance and shows difficulties in use because of easily falling off.
    </p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="6">It is an object of the present invention to provide a surface-treating method of screw parts, which method can prevent adhesion of the spatter scattered on welding onto a thread and deposition of an electrodeposition coating film formed during a cationic electrodeposition coating step on the thread so as to provide a good screw parts-fastening workability and torque stability on screwing the screw parts in greatly reduced manhours compared with the prior art.</p>
    <p num="7">That is, the present invention relates to a surface-treating method of screw parts, which method consists of coating beforehand a liquid organic resin based coating composition capable of forming a film having a volume resistivity of 1014  OMEGA  * cm or more at normal temperature onto a thread of screw parts to be mounted onto an automobile body by welding prior to a coating step of the automobile body, followed by heating and drying.</p>
    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="8">The screw parts, to which the surface-treating method is applied, may include a bolt and nut, and may be in the form of an untreated iron as it is, or in such a form that the surface of the iron has been subjected to a plating treatment such as galvanization or alloying galvanization by use of an alloy containing a metal other than zinc.</p>
    <p num="9">The organic resin based coating composition used in the present invention is required to have such characteristics that (1) the composition is a one-pack type liquid composition having good storage properties and can form a film after drying; that (2) the composition is such that a film formed therefrom has a volume resistivity of 1014  OMEGA  * cm or more at normal temperature and has good insulating characteristics; that (3) the composition has good adhesion properties onto the iron surface or the galvanized surface; that (4) the composition shows good chemical resistance; that (5) a film formed from the composition shows good wear resistance; and that (6) the composition shows good corrosion resistance.</p>
    <p num="10">
      Examples of the organic resin based coating composition satisfying the above characteristics may include (i) a fluoroacrylic resin based composition containing a mixture of a hydroxy group-containing fluoroacrylic resin containing, as the major components, perfluoroalkyl (meth)acrylate and hydroxy group-containing vinyl monomer and having a fluorine atom content of 10 to 40% by weight with a blocked polyisocyanate compound or an organotitanium compound; (ii) an epoxy resin-based composition containing, as a major component, a bisphenol type high molecular weight epoxy resin, or containing a mixture of a modified epoxy resin prepared by substituting a primary hydroxy group for epoxy groups at both molecular chain terminals of bisphenol type epoxy resin by use of alkanolamine or hydroxy acid with melamine resin or blocked polyisocyanate compound; (iii) a modified silicone resin based composition such as polyester resin-modified silicone polyester varnish, alkyd resin-modified silicone alkyd varnish, acrylic resin-modified silicone acrylic varnish, epoxy resin-modified silicone epoxy varnish and the like; (iv) resoil type oil-soluble phenol resin-modified alkyd resin varnish; (V) an alkyd resin based composition such as a melamine alkyd varnish prepared by mixing alkyd resin with melamine resin; (vi) a phenol resin based composition prepared by dissolving a novolac type or resol type phenol resin into an alcohol organic solvent; (vii) a polyurethane based composition prepared by mixing polyester resin with a blocked polyisocyanate compound; polyester varnish, polyimide varnish, polyimidoamide varnish, and the like.
      <br/>
      Of the above organic resin based coating compositions, (i) the fluoroacrylic resin based composition, (ii) the epoxy resin based composition and (iii) the modified silicone resin based composition are preferred.
      <br/>
      The organic resin based coating compositions are coated, followed by being heated and dried, resulting in that volatilization of the solvent and progress of the crosslinking reaction makes it possible to form a tough film having good properties in adhesion properties, electrical insulating properties, wear resistance and chemical resistance.
    </p>
    <p num="11">The hydroxy group-containing fluoroacrylic resin contained in the above composition (i) preferably used in the method of the present invention is a copolymer containing, as the major components, perfluoroalkyl (meth) acrylate and a hydroxy group-containing vinyl monomer.</p>
    <p num="12">Examples of the perfluoroalkyl (meth)acrylate may include 2,2-difluoroethyl (meth)acrylate, 2,2,2-trifluoroethyl (meth)acrylate, 2,2,3,3,-tetrafluoropropyl (meth)acrylate, 2,2,3,3,3-pentafluoropropyl (meth) acrylate, 2,2,3,4,4,4-hexafluorobutyl (meth)acrylate, 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5-octafluoropentyl (meth)acrylate, and the like.</p>
    <p num="13">The hydroxy group-containing vinyl monomer may include ones having a double bond copolymerizable with the perfluoroalkyl (meth)acrylate, for example, 2-hydroxyethyl (meth)acrylate, hydroxypropyl (meth) acrylate, hydroxybutyl (meth)acrylate and the like.</p>
    <p num="14">
      If needed, other copolymerizable monomers may additionally be used.
      <br/>
      The other copolymerizable monomers may preferably include acrylic monomers such as C1 -C10 lower alkyl (meth)acrylate, C1 -C6 lower alkoxy (meth) acrylate, cyanoethyl (meth)acrylate, acrylamide, acrylic acid, methacrylic acid and the like, and may also include styrene, alkyl-substituted styrene, acrylonitrile, methacrylonitrile and the like.
    </p>
    <p num="15">
      The above copolymer has a fluorine atom content of 10 to 40% by weight, preferably 12 to 30% by weight.
      <br/>
      When less than 10% by weight, chemical resistance and adhesion properties onto a substrate are reduced.
      <br/>
      When more than 40% by weight, poor solubility into the organic solvent may result in separation of the resin, or increased foaming properties may cause troubles of coating workability and finish properties, and also may cause unsatisfactory fastening.
    </p>
    <p num="16">
      As the crosslinking agent for the hydroxy group-containing fluoroacrylic resin, a polyisocyanate compound is preferred, and the amino resin is unusable because of poor compatibility and lack of coating composition stability.
      <br/>
      The polyisocyanate compound is a compound having at least two isocyanate groups in one molecule, and may specifically include aliphatic diisocyanates per se such as hexamethylene diisocyanate, trimethylhexamethylene diisocyanate and the like; aromatic diisocyanates per se such as tolylene diisocyanate, 4,4'-diphenylmethane diisocyanate and the like; adducts of the organic diisocyanate with polyhydric alcohol, low molecular weight polyester resin or water; polymers between the organic diisocyanates, and the like.
      <br/>
      The polyisocyanate compound to be used may also include a blocked polyisocyanate compound prepared by blocking isocyanate group with a suitable blocking agent.
      <br/>
      Use of the blocked polyisocyanate compound makes it possible to obtain a one-pack type coating composition having good storage stability.
      <br/>
      The blocking agent used may include a volatile low-molecular active hydrogen compound, and may specifically include known ones, for example, aliphatic or aromatic monohydric alcohol, hydroxy-t-amine, oxime, active methylene compound, lactam, phenols and the like.
    </p>
    <p num="17">A mixing ratio of the hydroxy group-containing fluoroacrylic resin to the polyisocyanate compound is such that a molar ratio of hydroxy group in the fluoroacrylic resin to isocyanate group in the polyisocyanate compound, i.e. a OH group to NCO group ratio is suitably in the range of 0.5 to 2.5.</p>
    <p num="18">
      The crosslinking agent other than the polyisocyanate compound may preferably include an organotitanium compound represented by the general formula: Ti(OR)4, wherein R represents alkyl group or aryl group, as a low temperature crosslinking agent.
      <br/>
      Examples of the organotitanium compound may include tetra-i-propoxytitanium, tetra-n-butoxytitanium, tetrakis (2-ethylhexyloxy) titanium, di-i-propoxy.bis (acetylacetone) titanate, di-n-butoxy.bis (triethanolamine) titanate and the like.
    </p>
    <p num="19">A mixing ratio between the hydroxy group-containing fluoroacrylic resin and the organotitanium compound is suitably in the range of 10 to 50 parts by weight of the organotitanium compound per 100 parts by weight of the hydroxy group-containing fluoroacrylic resin.</p>
    <p num="20">For the purpose of obtaining satisfactary film properties, chemical resistance and adhesion properties, a heat curing temperature on forming a coated film is required to be 140 (degree)  C. or higher when the blocked polyisocyanate compound is used as the crosslinking agent, but may be 100 (degree)  C. or higher to be satisfactory when the organotitanium compound is used as the crosslinking agent.</p>
    <p num="21">The modified epoxy resin in the composition (ii) preferably used in the method of the present invention is prepare d by substituting a primary hydroxy group for epoxy groups at both molecular chain terminals of bisphenol type epoxy resin by reaction of alkanolamine or hydroxy acid with epoxy group.</p>
    <p num="22">Examples of the alkanolamine may include a primary amine such as monoethanolamine, isopropanolamine, 1-amino-propane-3-ol, 1-amino-butane-4-ol, 3-aminobutane-1-ol, 1-amino-pentane-5-ol and the like, a secondary amine such as diethanolamine, diisopropanolamine and the like, and the like.</p>
    <p num="23">Examples of the hydroxy acid may include monohydroxy monocarboxylic acid such as 3-hydroxy propionic acid, 3-hydroxy butanoic acid, 3-hydroxy-2-methyl propionic acid, 2-hydroxymethyl butanoic acid and the like, dihydroxy monocarboxylic acid such as bis (oxymethyl) acetic acid, and the like.</p>
    <p num="24">Reactions of formation of the modified epoxy resin are shown by the following equations:  (Chemical Structure image '1' not included in text)</p>
    <p num="25">
      The modified epoxy resin obtained as above has a number average molecular weight of 3000 to 10000, preferably 4000 to 8500.
      <br/>
      When less than 3000, the coated film is brittle and lack of frexibility, and shows reduced chemical resistance.
      <br/>
      When more than 10,000, the viscosity of the resin is so high that a solubility into the organic solvent is reduced, resulting in causing troubles on coating workability.
    </p>
    <p num="26">On forming a coated film by use of the modified epoxy resin, use of a crosslinking agent is unnecessary and evaporation of the organic solvent results in that the resin per se can form a tough film.</p>
    <p num="27">The modified silicone resin based composition (iii) preferably used in the method of the present invention may include ones known in the art, for example, TSR 180, trade name of alkyd resin-modified silicone resin, TSR 194, trade name of epoxy resin-modified silicone resin, marketed by Toshiba Silicone Co., Ltd. respectively, and the like.</p>
    <p num="28">A method of coating the organic resin based coating compression onto the screw parts is explained in the following.</p>
    <p num="29">
      A dip.spin coating process is well known in the art as a method of coating the machine screw parts.
      <br/>
      On mounting the screw parts by the electric resistance welding, application of the above process, however, results in coating a whole surface of the screw parts, and results in that presence of a highly insulating film on an area contacting with an electrode results fusion of iron due to overheating and causes deformation of the screw parts.
      <br/>
      Therefore, it is important to coat only the thread of the screw parts without adhering the coating composition onto any parts other than the thread.
    </p>
    <p num="30">
      The method of coating the thread only may be carried out as follows.
      <br/>
      In the case of the bolt, the most simple method may include a method which comprises dip coating once the external thread only in a vertical, longitudinal position placing the external thread down, and heating and drying as it is without extracting a remaining liquid coating composition by a centrifugal force to form a coated film.
      <br/>
      On the other hand, the method of coating only the internal thread of the nut may include a method which comprises positioning the internal thread hole in a vertical, longitudinal direction, closing a bottom of the internal thread hole with a closing plate, injecting a liquid coating composition into the internal thread hole from upper side to coat the internal thread with the liquid coating composition, followed by sucking up the liquid coating composition upward, or followed by removing the closing plate at the bottom and discharging the liquid coating composition downward, a method which comprises positioning the internal thread hole in a vertical, longitudinal direction, inserting a pipe with pores into the internal thread hole, pressurizing a liquid coating composition filled in the pipe, and allowing the liquid coating composition to flow out of the pores to coat the internal thread only in the internal thread hole, and a method which comprises inserting a pipe into the internal thread hole from the bottom, allowing a liquid coating composition to flow upward through the pipe so as to overflow at an upper end of the pipe and form a liquid film on the external surface of the pipe, and contacting the internal thread in the internal thread hole with the liquid film to coat the internal thread only.
    </p>
    <p num="31">On coating only the thread of the screw parts according to the above coating method, for the purpose of controlling at such a suitable film thickness that coating properties of a thread crest is satisfied and that reduction in fastening workability due to too thick film thickness on a thread flank and thread root may be avoided, the solid content and viscosity of the coating composition are controlled, resulting in making it possible to obtain good properties in edge covering properties and uniformness of film thickness.</p>
    <p num="32">In the present invention, in addition to the above dip coating method, a method comprising masking parts other than the thread, followed by spray coating may also be applicable.</p>
    <p num="33">
      The coating composition used in the present invention has a solid content of 3 to 20% by weight, preferably 8 to 13% by weight.
      <br/>
      When less than 3% by weight, the resulting film is too thin as a whole to be satisfactory in obtaining a spatter adhesion-preventing effect and an electrodeposition coating film deposition-preventing ability.
      <br/>
      When more than 20% by weight, the resulting film is so thick as a whole that troubles may be produced in fastening workability.
    </p>
    <p num="34">
      A thixotropic viscosity properties is necessary for maintaining a uniformness of film thickness.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, use of a thickening agent capable of imparting thixotropic properties to the coating composition is necessary.
      <br/>
      The thickening agent to meet with the above requirements may include, for example, a long chain fatty acid ester polymer, fatty acid amide, sulfate based anionic active agent, finely divided silica dispersed beforehand in the organic resin constituting the coating composition.
      <br/>
      Of these, the fatty acid amide most easily provides the thixotropic viscosity properties and provides excellent finish properties.
    </p>
    <p num="35">
      The use of the thickening agent in the coating composition makes it possible to control viscosity and thixotropic index, so that the viscosity may be in the range of 10 to 500 centipoise/60 rpm, preferably 100 to 300 cp/60 rpm as measured by Brookfield rotational viscometer, and the thixotropic index, i.e. a ratio of a viscosity at 6 rpm to that at 60 rpm is in the range of 2 to 7, preferably 4 to 6.
      <br/>
      When the viscosity is less than 10 centipoise, the resulting film is too thin as a whole to obtain a satisfactory electrodeposition coating film deposition-preventing ability.
      <br/>
      On the other hand, when more than 500 centipoise, the resulting film is so thick that troubles are produced in a screw-fastening workability.
      <br/>
      When the thixotropic index is less than 2, a coated coating composition may easily flow, resulting in that a film thickness difference between upper and lower parts may be increased to be lack of uniformness in film thickness, that coating properties of the thread crest may be unsatisfactory, and that the electrodepossition coating film deposition-preventing ability may be reduced.
    </p>
    <p num="36">On the other hand, when the thixotropic index is more than 7, an amount of the thickening agent used is so increased that the resulting film may become brittle, and may be too thick as a whole, resulting in producing troubles in fastening workability.</p>
    <p num="37">The thickening agent necessary for controlling the viscosity and thixotropic index as above is used in an amount of one to 20 parts by weight per 100 parts by weight of the organic resin.</p>
    <p num="38">
      The above control of the solid content, viscosity and thixotropic index makes it possible to obtain maintenance of a complete coating properties of the thread crest and uniformness of film thickness on the thread flank and thread root.
      <br/>
      However, for the purpose of completely preventing the deposition of the cationic electrodeposition coating film, a film formed from the coating composition is required to have a volume resistivity of 1014  OMEGA  * cm or more at normal temperature.
      <br/>
      When the volume resistivity is less than the above, an increased electrical conductivity causes deposition of the electrodeposition coating film, resulting a very poor screw-fastining workability.
    </p>
    <p num="39">The coating composition used in the present invention, if needed, may include an organic solvent, coating surface-controlling agent, anti-foaming agent, coloring agents such as pigments and dyes, filler and the like known in the art respectively.</p>
    <p num="40">
      The above organic resin based coating composition is coated onto the thread of the screw parts, followed by heating and drying by use of a circulating hot air oven, an infrared rays irradiation apparatus, or a combined apparatus of the circulating hot air oven with the infrared rays irradiation apparatus to form a film.
      <br/>
      The drying temperature is in the range of 100 to 180 (degree)  C., and the drying time is in the range of 10 to 60 minutes.
    </p>
    <p num="41">The reason why the surface-treating method of the present invention makes it possible to prevent the adhesion of the spatter scattered on welding and the deposition of the electrodeposition coating film during the cationic electrodeposition coating step to obtain good screw-fastening workability and torque stability, may be guessed as follows.</p>
    <p num="42">
      First of all, the thread-coating properties must be satisfactory for preventing adhesion of the spatter and preventing deposition of the electrodeposition coating film.
      <br/>
      At the same time, formation of a film having a high uniformness in film thickness is important for the fastening workability.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, a sufficient increase in the thixotropic index of a liquid coating composition makes it possible to quickly stop the liquid coating composition flowing without causing any collection of the liquid coating composition on pulling up the thread after dipping, resulting in making it possible to maintain good uniformness in film thickness and good edge covering properties on the thread crest.
    </p>
    <p num="43">
      Controlling of the solid content and viscosity of the coating composition of the present invention makes it possible to accomplish control of film thickness.
      <br/>
      A coated film thickness on the thread crest can be 3 to 10  MU m so as to be effetive on preventing the spatter from adhering.
      <br/>
      A surface degradation by heat on the organic resin film due to contact with the spatter scattered in a heat fused state greatly reduces adhesion properties with the spatter, resulting in that the surface only of the coated film may be slightly scorched and that adhesion of the spatter may be prevented.
    </p>
    <p num="44">The coated film has a high volume resistivity and shows excellent insulating properties, resulting in showing little or no electrical conductivity in a film thickness of 1  MU m or more and in completely preventing deposition of the electrodeposition coating film.</p>
    <p num="45">The organic resin used in the present invention has a good adhesion properties to iron and shows a good resistance to chemicals used in degreasing and chemical treatments by use of alkali or acid as a step prior to the electrodeposition coating step even in such a thin film as to be a few  MU m thick, resulting in providing good screw-fastening workability without being stripped from the thread.</p>
    <p num="46">
      The surface-treating method of the screw parts according to the present invention makes it possible to obtain good edge covering properties on the thread crest and uniformness of film thickness of the coated film on the thread by controlling the solid content and viscosity of the highly insulating, liquid organic resin based coating composition in a specified range on coating beforehand the liquid coating composition on the thread of the screw parts, and thereby makes it possible to prevent adhesion of spatters onto the thread and deposition of the electrodeposition coating film on the thread, resulting in making it possible to obtain good screw parts-fastening workability and good torque stability on screwing.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the surface-treating method of the present invention provides such remarkable effect as to greatly reduce manhours for mounting the screw parts onto the automobile body by welding compared with the method of masking the thread of the screw parts in the prior art.
