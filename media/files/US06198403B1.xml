      <br/>
      In this micro-controller-based line voltage meter/monitor instrument, an AC signal-under-test is sensed from the line voltage via a broadband isolation transformer, and processed to provide RMS and fast peak signals.
      <br/>
      These are A/D converted in the micro-controller in a sampling process synchronized from a zero-cross signal detected from the AC voltage-under-test.
      <br/>
      An LED (light-emitting diode) display with 40 LED segments provides resolution of one volt RMS per LED step/segment, and is color-coded to overlay the CBEMA nominal limits.
      <br/>
      RMS values ranging from 95 to 135 volts are indicated on a bar graph, and fast peak values ranging from 120 to 500 volts at the waveform crest are indicated by the selected LED cell flashing at a 1 Hz rate, with selectable peak hold time.
      <br/>
      An internal real time calendar/clock enables accumulation of time-related data regarding the ongoing quality of the power line voltage levels.
      <br/>
      A variety of parameters and alarm limits can be configured by the user via a DIP switch and/or a user port, accessible at the rear of the instrument, by which the instrument can be connected in two-way communication with an external computer or control terminal, e.g. with a keyboard and/or CRT monitor, to provide a variety of extended capabilities.

    <heading>PRIORITY</heading>
    <p num="1">Benefit is claimed under 35 U.S.C, .sctn. 119(e) of pending provisional application No. 60/128,120 filed Apr. 7, 1999.</p>
    <heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">The present invention relates to the field of quality control of a.c. electrical power as supplied to a wide range of consumers including commercial, residential and industrial users, and more particularly it relates to advanced electronic test equipment for continuously monitoring and evaluating the quality of power line voltage with regard to unacceptable anomalies that can disrupt, damage and even destroy valuable electronic equipment, especially computers as used in business, industry and communications.</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="3">
      Powerline monitoring has evolved a long way from the early years of a.c. power, when the electrical service was subject to very few regulatory standards.
      <br/>
      Monitoring the power line often involved nothing more than measuring it continuously with some form of a.c. voltmeter to verify that the voltage level was being 30 held within designated limits, typically 105 to 130 volts.
      <br/>
      There were frequent outages, lightning strikes and other excursions beyond the normal limits, however much of the a.c. power-operated equipment was relatively simple, robust and tolerant to transient power line anomalies, so power line voltage quality was not a matter of great concern at that time.
    </p>
    <p num="4">With the passage of time, as electrical power usage intensified and particularly with the advent of the computer age and the proliferation of complex electronic equipment of many different kinds, although the electrical power industry had made much progress overall in regulating line voltage and minimizing outages, power-line related disruptions and damage continued to increase rapidly, calling a great deal of new attention to power line quality, and a large new market developed for equipment both for the protection of the payloads as well as for monitoring and evaluating many previously neglected aspects of the quality of power line voltage.</p>
    <p num="5">It became imperative to determine some kind of practical limits to which a.c. power lines can be "kept clean" and to which high tech equipment can be "toughened" to survive and tolerate at least a designated unavoidable level of contamination in the power lines as being acceptable.</p>
    <p num="6">
      The technical detective work necessary to ensure compliance with regulations in this field is highly statistical in nature, even regarding such basics as calender time and geographic location, since weather and electrical storms are often strong and highly unpredictable factors.
      <br/>
      The available existing instrumentation for this kind of investigation has been found lacking in sophistication to meet the new demands of the ever-increasing problem case loads that are building up in this evolving field.
    </p>
    <p num="7">An example of a standard that has evolved in response to this problem, in 1983 the U.S. Department of Commerce published a guideline, summarizing the fundamentals of powering, grounding and protecting sensitive devices under the title "Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) No. 94". This was approved and adopted by CBEMA, the Computer and Business Equipment Manufacturers' Association.</p>
    <p num="8">
      FIG. 1 depicts a simplified version of the "CBEMA Curve" that was developed by CBEMA and other industry members in an effort to characterize power line voltage anomalies such as dips, swells, outages and other transient effects based on both amplitude and time duration of the anomaly.
      <br/>
      This standard is widely recognized and utilized by designers of power line operated electronic equipment.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      The y axis is marked in a scale of amplitude expressed as a percentage of nominal or rated voltage and the y axis is marked in a scale of time duration of the transient disturbance.
      <br/>
      The "acceptable zone" is between curves 10A' and 10B'; thus a high amplitude transient excursion is "acceptable" only if the duration is short enough to remain in the acceptable zone under the curve, e.g. at point A, where an excursion reaching 250% of rated line voltage is "acceptable" because its duration is well under 100 microseconds.
      <br/>
      An excursion of this amplitude will enter the danger zone if its duration exceeds about 100 microseconds: e.g. point B is deep into the danger zone due its duration of about 4 milliseconds.
    </p>
    <p num="10">Applying the curves to power-operated equipment, if such is designed and/or protected in a manner to be able to tolerate the somewhat larger acceptable zone between curves 10A" and 10B", then the overlap between the two sets of curves represents a margin of safety.</p>
    <p num="11">The upper danger zone corresponds to transient surges above the rated voltage, while the lower danger zone corresponds to voltage dips or sags: the shape of the lower curves indicate that complete power outages to zero volts are acceptable up to a time duration of about 8 milliseconds.</p>
    <p num="12">
      Even with the best efforts of the electrical utility entities, there can be no guarantee that the line voltage will be kept within the acceptable zone at all times, due to unpredictable adverse field conditions, so this becomes a statistical issue.
      <br/>
      Based on a study of 1,200 site months of National Power Laboratory data, a typical location can expect to experience 289 disturbances per year falling outside the CBEMA boundaries.
    </p>
    <p num="13">The CBEMA curve represents a practical baseline standard to be met or exceeded in the original design of equipment; in most instances it should be technically feasible to apply the CBEMA curve in the specification and performance of line voltage tolerance testing during the development of new equipment, specially in the case of protective equipment such as line oltage conditioners and UPS units.</p>
    <p num="14">Despite all precautions, there are many problems and shortfalls in this field of a.c. power quality and equipment rotection at this time that may not be overcome in the foreseeable future, thus there is a large and ever-expanding need or equipment dedicated to the monitoring and evaluation of the quality of power line voltage with regard to anomalous excursions and dropouts.</p>
    <heading>DISCUSSION OF RELATED KNOWN ART</heading>
    <p num="15">
      A multi-million dollar industry has developed for power line conditioning equipment and UPS (uninterruptable power supply) equipment largely directed to the protection of computers and the like against damage and/or data loss from power line interruptions.
      <br/>
      UPS equipment can become very costly depending on reliability and the rated operational time available in the event of a power line outage.
      <br/>
      Some UPS equipment includes limited capabilities of monitoring and recording line voltage anomalies, but often such data capability is incomplete and inconvenient to retrieve and analyze.
    </p>
    <p num="16">
      U.S. Pat. No. 5,880,537 for an UNINTERRUPTABLE POWER SUPPLY discloses apparatus including a main motor, a smaller induction motor and a mechanical load such as a generator coaxially coupled together and a battery connected to the smaller induction motor through an inverter.
      <br/>
      This patent is of interest in discussing and comparing several different types of UPS systems; however it exemplifies UPS systems that do not themselves include instrumentation for monitoring power line quality in general and more particulary monitoring the line during transitions from and back to the regular power line or during the substitution period when the UPS takes over in an outage event.

      While the patent addresses the objective of making such transitions trouble-free, concern about power line transients is confined to the protection of the UPS equipment itself against power line surges and other transients through isolation techniques, and little or nothing is incorporated in the UPS or taught in the patent toward monitoring and evaluating the overall a.c. line quality, including anomalies that could occur during such transitions and during the substitution period.
    </p>
    <p num="17">Typically in known art there has been a failure to teach and provide capability of adequately monitoring the power line voltage, especially during the critical period of cut-in and cut-out of a UPS a.c. generator.</p>
    <p num="18">
      At the other extreme, full blown power line analyzers are available with very extensive capabilities but they tend to be large and expensive: typically packaged as rack-mounted units or consoles that require a substantial amount of floor space.
      <br/>
      Such large equipment is not at all suitable for field use, for example aboard marine vessels or in the increasing field of TV or radio broadcasting or other technical activities undertaken in mobile vehicles where it is often required to operate on a.c. power from emergency type generators.
    </p>
    <p num="19">There is an unfulfilled need for an independent stand-alone desktop instrument capable of monitoring, recording and evaluating power line voltage quality in detail, not only for evaluating the power line directly as received, but especially for verifying the effectiveness of any additional line voltage conditioning equipment placed into service, and in the case of UPS equipment, monitoring the critical cut-in and cut-out transition performance as well as the actual performance of the UPS while generating power in place of the regular power line, particularly when the outages extend to a time duration that challenges the UPS's capability.</p>
    <heading>OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="20">It is a primary object of the present invention to provide a standalone desktop PIM (power line meter/monitor) instrument for on-line monitoring of a group of predetermined electrical power line quality parameters.</p>
    <p num="21">It is a further object to provide the PLM with at least a proportional visual display that provides a user-friendly continuous indication of both RMS and fast peak voltage values on a display that simulates an analog meter but that operates in a zero mass mode, free of ballistic limitations.</p>
    <p num="22">It is a further object of the invention to provide in the PLM the capability of monitoring, logging, accessing and displaying a primary set of parameters and logging functions, such as RMS and peak readings, time durations and intervals, directly from the PLM instrument panel.</p>
    <p num="23">It is a further object to enable the instrument to be connected to an external terminal or equivalent to facilitate aquiring, logging and evaluating a secondary set of parameters and logging functions, including various power line voltage anomalies of different types such as swells, dips, spikes, glitches, etc., along with related time data.</p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="24">
      The above mentioned objects have been accomplished by the present invention of a micro-controller-based line voltage meter/monitor instrument with an LED (light-emitting diode) bar-graph simulated-analog meter display having a slightly curved scale with 40 LED segments providing resolution of one volt RMS per LED step/segment, color coded to overlay the CBEMA nominal limits.
      <br/>
      RMS values ranging from 95 to 135 volts are indicated on an upper scale, and fast peak values ranging from 120 to 500 volts at the waveform crest are indicated on the lower scale by the corresponding LED flashing at a 1 Hz rate.

    <p num="41">FIGS. 4B-4D are schematic diagrams of the various portions of the d.c. power supply system of the PLM.</p>
    <p num="42">
      FIG. 4B is a schematic diagram of the main power supply (16, FIG. 3): power transformer T71, receiving a.c. power line voltage from line cord receptacle J71, drives a full wave bridge rectifier circuit implemented by D71-D74 (IN4003), supplying the main unregulated d.c. voltage VPLUSRAW.
      <br/>
      This is regulated by IC U78 (LM2537ET-10) to provide the +10 volt supply bus VPLUSREG.
    </p>
    <p num="43">In FIG. 4C, VPLUSRAW, applied as input to IC regulator U77 (LP2951ACN) is regulated and delivered as +5 volts output to the +5VREG bus.</p>
    <p num="44">In FIG. 4D, VPLUSREG, applied as input to an inverter IC device U76 (ICL7662CPA), which provides a negative d.c. voltage as output; this is regulated by Zener diode SD79 (1N5819), filtered by choke L76 and capacitors CB76A and CB76B and delivered as -8 volts output.</p>
    <p num="45">Also in FIG. 4D, VPLUSRAW is applied as input to IC regulator U79 (MIC4575-5.0BT) whose output is regulated by Zener diode SD76 (IN914B), filtered through choke L79 and capacitor CB79C and delivered as the supply voltage to the LED's on the VPLUSLED bus.</p>
    <p num="46">
      In FIG. 4E wideband sample/isolation transformer T15, with its primary connected to the a.c. power line through lines 1, 2, 3, and 4 (refer to FIG. 4B), delivers stepped-down a.c. secondary voltage to a full wave rectifier circuit with diodes D15 and D16.
      <br/>
      The rectified envelope is then peak detected by fast peak detector circuit 22 implemented by opamp U15A (LF347N) with diodes D17 and D18.
      <br/>
      Opamp U15B (LF347N), configured as a unity gain buffer, delivers the peak output signal ACPK as the basis for the peak reading display.
      <br/>
      Peak reset is provided by MOSFET Q15 (2N7000) which receives a PKRESET signal from the micro-controller.
    </p>
    <p num="47">
      FIG. 4F is a schematic diagram of precision rectifier circuit 20 (refer to FIG. 3).
      <br/>
      A replica of the a.c. power line voltage, signal ACMON (from the secondary of transformer T15 in FIG. 4E) is received as input by IC opamp U15C (LF347N) which, with diodes D19 and D20 (1N914b), is configured as a precision rectifier delivering as output, via buffer U15D (LF347N), a precise full-wave rectified representation of the a.c. power line input waveform including fast transients, delivered to the microprocessor as signal ACVIN as the basis for RMS reading display.
    </p>
    <p num="48">
      FIG. 4G is a schematic diagram of zero-cross detector 24 (refer to FIG. 3).
      <br/>
      Receiving signal ACMON through a low pass filter (R30, C30, R31 and C31) which attenuates noise, IC comparator U30 (LF311) detects the zero crossings which appear as transitions in the square wave output signal FLINE.
      <br/>
      This is applied as an input signal to the microprocessor (26, pin 17, FIG. 4A) where FLINE is utilized in a phase lock loop for sychronizing the sampling process by which the power line waveform ACVIN (FIG. 4F) is sampled at 64 points of time during each power line cycle, and from which the RMS value is calculated for display.
    </p>
    <p num="49">
      FIG. 4H is a schematic diagram of a user interface circuit 30 accessible as a console port, on the rear panel of the PLM instrument: a 9 pin male connector 30A labeled "User Port", by which the instrument's extensive logging functions can be accessed by plugging in a terminal or a PC that emulates a terminal to the user port.
      <br/>
      Communication is straight ASCII terminal emulation.
      <br/>
      Parameter lists and editing instructions are provided in the Dorrough Technical Manual, e.g. for model PLM-120.
    </p>
    <p num="50">
      The user port connector 30A also provides as output the three SPDT "dry" contacts of the alarm relay 32 which is controlled from MOSFET Q55 (2N7000), receiving the alarm signal ALM from the micro-controller.
      <br/>
      Resistor arrays Z55 and Z56 form voltage dividers for signals C3-7 which are applied as inputs to the micro-controller (26, FIG. 4A, upper left corner).
      <br/>
      The alarm relay 32 is controlled in the "deadman" mode, i.e. relay 32 is de-energized under an alarm condition.
      <br/>
      Thus RMS voltage failure will always de-energize the alarm relay 32.
      <br/>
      Alarms are latching in nature and can be reset by the front panel pushbutton 12A (also refer to FIG. 2) or though port connector 30A using the parameter edit function, specifically parameter 00.

      <br/>
      Serial data to be transmitted from the micro-controller, TXDATA (at pin 25) is applied as input to pin 2 of processor U65, from which, as output at pin 7, the serial data is delivered to pin 2 of connector 34A/J65 for transmission to the external computer.

      FIG. 4K is the schematic diagram of real time clock 36 (refer to FIG. 3), controlled by crystal X1 at 32.768 KHz, that provides the date and time.
      <br/>
      The four lines shown at the right of IC U1, SDOUT, SDIN, SDCLK and RTC-CE, are connected respectively to pins 24, 23, 18 and 5 of the micro-controller (26, FIG. 4A).
      <br/>
      A stand-by battery BT1 provides operating power so that the real time clock 36 will continue to operate normally through power outages.
    </p>
    <p num="54">
      The RS-232C feature in FIG. 4J provides the capability of two-way serial communication with an external computer, allowing the user great flexibility in setting up many parameters of the PLM to particular requirements, especially with regard to anomaly data sensing and acquisition, and alarm levels, etc.
      <br/>
      The real time clock circuitry in FIG. 4K enables the software logging protocols to enter a time/date stamp on power line events.
      <br/>
      The PLM is designed such that as a manufacturing option, the RS-232C feature in FIG. 4J and the real time clock in FIG. 4K can be included or omitted, while the more basic user interface (30, FIGS. 3 and 4H) has been provided as standard in all PLM units.
