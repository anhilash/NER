      <br/>
      This application is directed to a linkage system which provides continuous rotation to two or more interconnected quadrilaterals.
      <br/>
      The basic element of the linkage system is a multi-level link which provides firstly, a non-rotatable connection between two sub-links lying, in separate parallel planes and secondly, a rotatable connection for a further link lying in another parallel plane between the planes of the sub-links.
      <br/>
      By various interconnections between link elements, the quadrilaterals the linkage system will form various geometric patterns as the linkage is rotated.
      <br/>
      As the quadrilaterals lie in different planes, they may be continuously rotated with respect to each other.
      <br/>
      The linkage system may be used as a toy, a novelty item and as an educational tool.

    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">
      The invention disclosed is a unique type of linkage that is comprised of a multiplicity of links lying on different levels.
      <br/>
      These links form a chain or a matrix of interconnected four-bar linkages.
      <br/>
      I have discovered a novel arrangement of connections that allow the links in such a linkage to rotate continuously relative to one another, rather than having rotational limits.
    </p>
    <p num="3">
      When driven, such a linkage moves smoothly and synchronously, the links moving past one another on different levels.
      <br/>
      The patterns formed by the links as they change their configuration are surprising and aesthetically pleasing.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      Such linkages are useful as toys or novelty items.
      <br/>
      The linkages can function as interactive educational tools, using the changing geometric patterns to reveal mathematical relationships.
      <br/>
      Other uses may include vehicles for rough terrain, where the linkage forms a unique tread that can move over rough surfaces.
    </p>
    <p num="5">Different types of linkage systems are found in the structures described in my prior U.S. patents, including U.S. Pat. No. 4,942,700, issued Jul. 24, 1990, entitled Reversibly Expandable Doubly-Curved Truss Structure; U.S. Pat.

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
    <p num="7">
      Shown in FIG. 1 is an exploded view of a link 1 that is made up of two sub-links 2 and 3.
      <br/>
      Sub-link 2 has a pivot 6 on one end, and a second pivot 5 on its other end.
      <br/>
      Attached to pivot 5 is an element 4 that provides means to make a rigid (non-rotatable) connection to sub-link 3.
      <br/>
      Sub-link 3 has a pivot 7 on one end and a cavity 8 which engages with element 4.
      <br/>
      In FIG. 2 sub-links 2 and 3 are shown rigidly attached together.
      <br/>
      It is seen that link 1 lies within two distinct planes and has a central pivot 5 that remains exposed between sub-links 2 and 3.
      <br/>
      Link 1 and others of its general type are thus hereinafter referred to as multi-level links.
      <br/>
      Pivots 6 and 7 lie at the extremities of link 1 and are hereinafter referred to as terminal pivots.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      FIG. 3 is an exploded view of link 1 with a second angulated link 10 lying between sub-links 2 and 3.
      <br/>
      Link 10 has a central pivot 11 and two terminal pivots 12 and 13.
      <br/>
      Link 10 may be pivotally attached to link 1 such that central pivot 11 is engaged with pivot 5.
      <br/>
      Link 10 and others of its general type are hereinafter referred to as planar links.
      <br/>
      FIG. 4 shows multi-level 1 and planar link 10 pivotally attached together.
      <br/>
      Link 1 is shown as a shaded element for clarity in the drawing.
      <br/>
      FIG. 5 shows links 1 and 10 rotated to a different position.
      <br/>
      It is seen that link 10 is capable of being rotated in a continuous fashion relative to link 1.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      FIG. 6 shows a linkage 15 consisting of multi-level link 1, planar link 10 and four other planar links 20, 30, 40 and 50.
      <br/>
      Links 20 and 30 are attached to one terminal pivot each of links 1 and 10, and are pivotally attached to each other, thereby forming a closed loop.
      <br/>
      Similarly links 40 and 50 are attached to one terminal pivot each of links 1 and 10, and are pivotally attached to each other, also forming a closed loop.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      FIG. 7 is a diagram of lines that connect pivots-centers of linkage 15 as shown in FIG. 6.
      <br/>
      The diagram may be seen to consist of two parallelograms 16 and 17.
      <br/>
      The parallelograms are seen to correspond to parallel four-bar linkages in the actual mechanism.
      <br/>
      FIGS. 8-11 show linkage 15 in various positions.
      <br/>
      It is seen that link 10 may be rotated a full 360 degrees relative to link 1 with no interference from attached links 20, 30, 40 and 50.
      <br/>
      FIG. 12 is a diagram that corresponds to lines connecting the pivots of linkage 15 as shown in FIG. 11. It is seen to consist of two quadrilaterals 18 and 19 which are parallelograms in this case.
      <br/>
      In fact, for all positions of linkage 15 similarly constructed diagrams consist of two quadrilaterals, with link 10 forming a side of each of the quadrilaterals and a vertex of each quadrilateral.
      <br/>
      The arms of link 10 have been illustrated as extending at an obtuse angle with respect to each other.
      <br/>
      It is to be understood that link 10 would function the same if the arms were disposed at acute or right angles.
      <br/>
      Simarlary, sub-links 2 and 3 of link 1 can also be disposed at other than right angles with respect to each other.
    </p>
    <p num="11">

    </p>
    <p num="12">
      FIG. 14 shows linkage 100 in assembled form.
      <br/>
      Each central pivot of multi-level links 110, 120 and 130 passes through and has a pivotal connection with planar link 150.
      <br/>
      Sub-links 112 and 113 are rigidly attached together to form multi-level link 110.
      <br/>
      Similarly sub-links 122, 123 and sub-links 132, 133 form multi-level links 120 and 130 respectively.
      <br/>
      FIG. 15 shows linkage 100 in a different position where planar link 150 has been rotated relative to multi-level link 120.
      <br/>
      FIG. 16 shows another rotational position of linkage 100.
      <br/>
      FIG. 17 is a diagram that corresponds to the lines connecting the pivots of linkage 100 as shown in FIG. 15. It is seen to consist of four quadrilaterals (parallelograms) 171, 172, 173 and 174.
      <br/>
      Links 140, 150 and 160 form a side and vertex of adjacent quadrilaterals.
      <br/>
      FIGS. 18 and 19 show other positions of linkage 100.
      <br/>
      Examining the five positions shown in FIGS. 14-19, it is seen that the rotation of planar link 150 relative to multi-level link 120 continues without interference through a complete 360 degree revolution.
      <br/>
      FIG. 20 is a diagram that corresponds to lines connecting the pivots of linkage 100 as shown in FIG. 19. It is seen to consist of four parallelograms 181, 182, 183 and 184.
      <br/>
      In fact, for all positions of linkage 100 similarly constructed diagrams are seen to consist of four parallelograms.
    </p>
    <p num="13">
      FIG. 21 is an exploded view of a linkage 200, which consists of two planar links 210 and 211, as well as two multi-level links 220 and 230.

      <br/>
      As can be seen in FIG. 21, certain link elements such as elements 240, 250 are V-shaped and have arms which are not linked to another element.
      <br/>
      Such arms add to the appearance of the overall device, but are not strictly needed for functionality.
      <br/>
      Similarly, each side of yoke element 260 is shown as X-shaped, but could also take various other configurations depending on aesthetic or functional requirements.
