      <br/>
      A method and system for processing first and second seismic traces includes rotating the first seismic traces and the second seismic traces to forty-five degrees in the time domain.
      <br/>
      In one embodiment, the rotated first time domain traces and second time domain traces are transformed to the frequency domain to obtain an amplitude spectrum for each rotated first time domain trace and an amplitude spectrum for each rotated second time domain trace.
      <br/>
      Each amplitude spectrum is squared to obtain a power spectrum for each transformed and rotated time domain trace.
      <br/>
      The phase of each transformed rotated time domain trace to zero.
      <br/>
      The power spectrum for each transformed rotated time domain trace is then averaged.
      <br/>
      Each transformed rotated time domain trace is divided into time windows.
      <br/>
      A power spectrum for each window is obtained for the entire of each transformed rotated time domain trace.
      <br/>
      The power spectra of each window of the transformed rotated time domain trace is summed to obtain a summed first power spectrum.
      <br/>
      A third power spectrum representing a source wavelet is defined.
      <br/>
      The third power spectrum is divided by the power spectrum to obtain a set of frequency domain scalars.
      <br/>
      The amplitude power spectrum is multiplied by the set of frequency domain scalars.
      <br/>
      The result of this multiplication is inverse transformed.
      <br/>
      The amplitudes of the inverse transformed result is compared to derive an first amplitude scalar.

    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="1">
      The present invention pertains to seismic data processing and more particularly to processing seismic data obtained from seismic cables set on land or under a body of water where multi-axial geophones are used at each single receiver location.
      <br/>
      The present invention pertains to changing the orientation of multicomponent seismic detectors and more particularly to the use of data manipulation and the rotation of the orientation of seismic detectors to remove errors and noise from detected data.
    </p>
    <p num="2">
      Multicomponent detectors are generally composed of three geophones: two orthogonal horizontal geophones and one vertical geophone.
      <br/>
      There are various problems in the orientation of these multicomponent geophone assemblies.
      <br/>
      One problem is due to shot position errors, or the location of the shot or source with respect to the detectors.
      <br/>
      A further problem occurs in marine environment.
      <br/>
      When the array is laid on the ocean bottom, various ocean floor inconsistencies, such as rocks, coral, etc., can misalign the intended orientation.
      <br/>
      Still another problem relates to coupling errors between the geophones and the earth.
    </p>
    <p num="3">
      There have been attempts at dealing with the determination of receiver orientation angle.
      <br/>
      However, even under these methods, there is still some error.

    <heading>DESCRIPTION OF EXAMPLE EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="24">
      In multicomponent phones, the in-line geophone H1 and the cross-line geophone H2 have different sensitivity.
      <br/>
      FIG. 1 shows that for a single receiver, with multiple shots S1 through S3 there are a variety of angles between the shot and the receiver location RL.
      <br/>
      Therefore, according to one embodiment of the invention, for each shot, the plane of each receiver is mathematically rotated so that there is about forty-five degrees between the line from the shot point to the receiver location and the component or geophone axis.
      <br/>
      FIG. 2 is an illustration of the rotation for shot S1.
      <br/>
      If the geophone components H1 and H2 were to function perfectly, and there were no errors (described below) there would be no sensitivity differences for rays incident at a forty-five degree angle between horizontal first and second geophones.
      <br/>
      In other words, the signal energy level, both in the time and the frequency domain, for H1 and H2, should be the same.
      <br/>
      Since nothing operates perfectly in the real world, however, the signals for H1 and H2 are rarely, if ever, the same.
      <br/>
      Therefore, according to one embodiment of the invention, the signals are simply made the same at 45 degrees.
      <br/>
      By matching the signals from the two geophones, various system errors, including sensitivity and coupling differences, are removed.
    </p>
    <p num="25">
      In this embodiment, the signals for geophones H1 and H2 are made the same both in the time domain and in the frequency domain.
      <br/>
      In one example time domain embodiment, the signals are made the same by trace equalization, through surface consistent scaling.
      <br/>
      In a frequency domain example embodiment, the signals are made equal by source signature shaping.
      <br/>
      In one specific, non-limiting example, this is done using trace-by-trace deconvolution.
      <br/>
      Many other methods of making the signals for geophones H1 and H2 the same are possible, as will occur to those of skill in the art.
    </p>
    <p num="26">After the signals are equalized, in some embodiments the planes of the receivers are re-rotated to their original orientation of the radial and transverse directions, or they are rotated to any other orientation of interest.</p>
    <p num="27">
      In still further embodiments, rather than being rotated to about 45 degrees, the signals from components H1 and H2 are rotated to another angle at which the amplitude relationship between the components is theoretically available.
      <br/>
      Forty-five degrees is merely the most simple, since there is a 1:1 theoretical relationship.
    </p>
    <p num="28">
      Referring now to FIG. 3, by way of further illustration, a situation is seen in which a rotation of H1 to align with the source results in H1 having all signal (illustrated as H1) and H2 having none (illustrated as H2).
      <br/>
      This is the theoretically perfect condition.
      <br/>
      FIG. 4, on the other hand, is an illustration of signals in the real world.
      <br/>
      These signals illustrate the effects of imperfect coupling, manufacturing variances or other problems or imperfections that produce less than ideal results.
    </p>
    <p num="29">
      In FIG. 5, an embodiment of the invention is seen in which pre-conditioning is performed.
      <br/>
      Here, the receiver is rotated to about forty-five degrees and the outputs are matched.
      <br/>
      In this example, the rotation works to have H1 rotate to a full or maximum signal and H2 rotates to zero or to a minimum signal.
    </p>
    <p num="30">
      FIG. 6 is a block diagram of the flow chart of an example method embodiment of the present invention.

      At block 12 data is received in any form currently in use in the art.
      <br/>
      At block 14, the received data is rotated to about forty-five degrees from a line between the source and receiver position.

    <p num="38">At block 71, the rotated traces are divided into windows.</p>
    <p num="39">
      At block 72, the rotated first and second time domain windows are transformed to the frequency domain to obtain an amplitude spectrum.

      This transformation is performed by any method currently in use in the art; however, the preferred embodiment uses fast fourier transform to translate the data in the time domain to data in the frequency domain.
      <br/>
      This is done to obtain an amplitude spectrum of the traces without any additional steps, such as normalization, autocorrelation, or crosscorrelation, to preserve the relative amplitude between the first traces and the second traces.

      The method of defining the idealized source signature power spectrum is varied in alternative embodiments of the present invention.
      <br/>
      For example, the far field source signature method, commonly known in the art, is used in one embodiment, and its power spectrum is determined.
      <br/>
      In a second embodiment, the source signature is simply guessed and the power spectrum of that guess is used.
      <br/>
      In a third embodiment, the first and second source signatures are used to determine the slope of the power spectrum at the low cut frequency of the recording equipment, which is known.
      <br/>
      Source modeling and other types of human interpretation determines the upper frequency and an ideal wave shape is presumed.
    </p>
    <p num="43">
      At block 88 this third power spectrum is divided by the power spectrum to obtain a set of frequency domain scalars.
      <br/>
      This process is done for both the first power spectrum and for the second power spectrum.
      <br/>
      Thus, a set of frequency domain scalars is obtained for both the first traces and the second traces.

      At block 92 the amplitude power spectrum multiplied by the set of frequency domain scalars is inverse transformed.
      <br/>
      The inverse transformation is done using the phase spectrum of the input phase in some instances and using the phase spectrum of zero phase in other instances.
      <br/>
      The result is filtered first and second traces.

    <p num="45">
      At block 94 the amplitudes of the inverse transformed amplitude power spectrum multiplied by the set of frequency domain scalars is compared to derive an amplitude scalar.

      This comparison may be done by any one of several methods known in the art, such as direct arrival comparison, root mean squared (RMS) comparison of a sample of or the entire trace, etc.

    <p num="46">At block 96 the amplitude of the entire trace is matched with the amplitude scalar to a predetermined constant to obtain an amplitude and wavelet matched trace.</p>
    <p num="47">
      At block 98 the traces are rotated to a desired orientation.
      <br/>
      This may be the original orientation, transverse orientation, etc.

      In a first embodiment, the traces are rotated to the original orientation and use this orientation to go to the radial and transverse directions.
      <br/>
      In a second embodiment, the wavelet matched traces are determined by inverse transforming the first frequency scalars and the second frequency scalars.
      <br/>
      The second embodiment then provides and first filter operator and a second filter operator.
