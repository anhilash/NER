      The present invention relates to a vehicle safety apparatus.
      <br/>
      In particular, the present invention relates to an inflatable vehicle occupant protection device, such as a side curtain assembly, for helping to protect a vehicle occupant in the event of a side impact to a vehicle.
      <br/>
      As representative of the present invention, FIG. 1 illustrates schematically a vehicle safety apparatus 10 for helping to protect an occupant of a vehicle 12.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      The vehicle 12 has a side structure 20 (FIGS. 1-4) which includes a front door 22 and a front side window 24.
      <br/>
      The vehicle side structure 20 also includes a rear door 26 and a rear side window 28.
      <br/>
      The vehicle B-pillar 30 is disposed between the front side window 24 and the rear side window 28.
      <br/>
      The side structure 20 also includes the vehicle A-pillar and C-pillar (not shown).
    </p>
    <p num="11">
      A metal roof panel 40 of the vehicle 12 extends laterally in the vehicle, from the vehicle side structure 20 past the vehicle centerline.
      <br/>
      When a vehicle occupant sits in the front seat (not shown) of the vehicle 12, the occupant is adjacent to the vehicle front door 22 and front window 24.
      <br/>
      The side of the occupant's head is adjacent to the front window 24.
      <br/>
      The top of the occupant's head is adjacent to the roof panel 40.
    </p>
    <p num="12">
      As illustrated in FIG. 2 and 3, the roof panel 40 has an outer edge portion 42.
      <br/>
      The vehicle side structure includes a metal cant rail 50 adjacent the roof panel 40.
      <br/>
      The cant rail 50 has an outer edge portion 52 welded to the outer edge portion 42 of the roof panel 40.
      <br/>
      The cant rail 50 also includes an inner panel 56.
      <br/>
      The outer edge portion 42 of the roof panel 40, together with the cant rail 50, forms the roof rail of the vehicle.
    </p>
    <p num="13">
      The vehicle side structure 20 also includes a bulb seal 60 which is supported on the outer edge portion 42 of the roof panel 40 and the outer edge portion 52 of the cant rail 50.
      <br/>
      The vehicle front door 22 (not shown in FIGS. 2-3), which supports the front side window 24, is engageable with the bulb seal 60 when the door is closed.
    </p>
    <p num="14">
      The vehicle 12 includes a headliner 58.
      <br/>
      The headliner 58 includes a relatively rigid plastic backer 62, a foam layer 64, and a fabric inner layer 66.
      <br/>
      The headliner 58 has a terminal edge portion 68 which is laterally outermost in the vehicle, closest to the vehicle side structure 20.
    </p>
    <p num="15">
      The roof panel 40, the headliner 58, and the cant rail 50 define a safety apparatus mounting chamber 70 in the vehicle 12.
      <br/>
      The vehicle side structure 20 and the headliner 58 define a vehicle occupant compartment 72.
      <br/>
      The terminal edge portion 68 of the headliner 58 and the vehicle side structure 20 define an opening 74 between the safety apparatus mounting chamber 70 and the vehicle occupant compartment 72.
    </p>
    <p num="16">
      The safety apparatus 10 includes a side curtain 80 (FIGS. 2-4) and an inflator (not shown) for inflating the side curtain 80.
      <br/>
      The inflator preferably contains a stored quantity of pressurized inflation fluid in the form of gas to inflate the side curtain 80.
      <br/>
      The inflator alternatively could contain a combination of pressurized inflation fluid and ignitable material for heating the inflation fluid, or could be a pyrotechnic inflator which uses the combustion of gas-generating material to generate inflation fluid.
      <br/>
      The safety apparatus 10 also includes a cover 90 and a fill tube 100.
    </p>
    <p num="17">
      The fill tube 100 has a cylindrical configuration centered on an axis 102.
      <br/>
      The inner side surface of the fill tube 100 defines a fluid flow passage 106 in the fill tube.
      <br/>
      A series of nozzles or outlets (not shown) are formed in the fill tube 100 at spaced locations along its length.
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      The cover 90 is injection molded as one piece from a plastic material.
      <br/>
      The cover 90 is made from a material which is strong enough to protect the parts of the vehicle safety apparatus 10 which are enclosed within the cover.
      <br/>
      The material of the cover 90 is soft enough, that is, sufficiently flexible or deformable, to be opened upon actuation of the inflator.
      <br/>
      The material of the cover 90 is one on which a Class A interior surface can be formed.
      <br/>
      A preferred material for the cover 90 is DuPont Hytrel DYM 100 brand thermoplastic polyester elastomer, having a material thickness of about 2 mm.
      <br/>
      This preferred material is available from E. I. DuPont de Nemours &amp; Co. of Wilmington, Del.
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      The cover 90 includes a mounting portion 120 having an elongate, tubular configuration.
      <br/>
      The base 122 of the mounting portion 120 has an arcuate configuration which extends for 180 degrees around the fill tube 100.
    </p>
    <p num="20">
      An outer leg 124 of the mounting portion 120 extends from the base 122, along the inner panel 56 of the cant rail 50, in a direction toward the outer edge portion 52 of the cant rail.
      <br/>
      The outer leg 124 of the mounting portion 120 of the cover 90 has an outer edge portion 126 disposed adjacent to or in the opening 74 between the headliner 58 and the side structure 20.
    </p>
    <p num="21">
      An inner leg 130 of the mounting portion 120 extends from the base 122, in a direction generally parallel to the outer leg 124.
      <br/>
      The inner leg 130 of the mounting portion 120 has first and second sections 132 and 134 flexibly interconnected by a hinge portion 136.
      <br/>
      The second section 134 of the inner leg 130 has an outer edge portion 138.
      <br/>
      The outer edge portion 138 of the inner leg 130 is in abutting engagement with the outer edge portion 126 of the outer leg 124, adjacent to or in the opening 74 between the headliner 58 and the side structure 20.
    </p>
    <p num="22">
      The cover 90 includes a trim portion 140 which extends from and is movable with the second section 134 of the inner leg 130 of the mounting portion 120 of the cover.
      <br/>
      The trim portion 140 has a generally panel-like configuration including inner and outer side surfaces 142 and 144.
      <br/>
      The inner side surface 142 is presented toward the second section 134 of the inner leg 130 of the mounting portion 120 of the cover 90.
      <br/>
      The outer side surface 144 of the trim portion 140 is a Class A surface exposed to the vehicle occupant compartment 72.
      <br/>
      The trim portion 140 of the cover 90 is the visible portion of the cover in the vehicle 12.
    </p>
    <p num="23">
      The trim portion 140 is disposed in the opening 74, and/or extends from the mounting chamber 70 into the opening 74.
      <br/>
      The trim portion 140 has a inner edge portion 146 in abutting engagement with the terminal edge portion 68 of the headliner 58.
      <br/>
      An outer edge portion 148 of the trim portion 140 is in abutting engagement with and underlies the bulb seal 60.
      <br/>
      As a result, the trim portion 140 of the cover 90 closes the opening 74 to the safety apparatus mounting chamber 70.
    </p>
    <p num="24">
      The base 122 of the cover 90, the inner and outer legs 124 and 130, and the trim portion 140 together define a substantially closed chamber 150 in the cover.
      <br/>
      The cover 90 encloses the side curtain 80 within the chamber 150 when the side curtain is in the deflated condition.
      <br/>
      A small gap of about 1 millimeter may be present between the outer edge portions 126 and 138 of the inner and outer legs 124 and 130 of the cover 90.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, the inner and outer legs 124 and 130 can touch, and may be releasably held together by a tab and slot assembly such as indicated schematically at 151 in FIG. 5.
    </p>
    <p num="25">
      The side curtain 80 has a mounting portion 152 and an occupant contact portion 154.
      <br/>
      The mounting portion 152 of the side curtain 80 extends circumferentially around the fill tube 100.
      <br/>
      The fill tube 100 extends axially through the mounting portion 152 of the side curtain 80.
      <br/>
      The occupant contact portion 154 of the side curtain 80 is connected in fluid communication with the mounting portion 152 of the side curtain.
    </p>
    <p num="26">
      The safety apparatus 10, including the fill tube 100, the side curtain 80 (in its deflated condition), the cover 90, and the inflator, is stored in the safety apparatus mounting chamber 70 in the vehicle 12, between the headliner 58 and the vehicle side structure 20 or roof panel 40.
      <br/>
      A plurality of fasteners in the form of bolts 160, spaced along the length of the safety apparatus 10, secure the safety apparatus to the cant rail 50.
      <br/>
      The bolts 160 extend through openings in the cover 90 and through slits in the side curtain 80.

      FIG. 5 illustrates the configuration of the safety apparatus 10 at the location of the B-pillar 30 of the vehicle 12.
      <br/>
      The B-pillar 30 includes two structural metal panels 170 and 172 and an inner trim panel 174.
      <br/>
      A clip 176 on the back of the trim panel 174 attaches the trim panel to the metal panel 172.
      <br/>
      In addition, a bolt 178 attaches the top end of the trim panel 174 to the metal panel 172.
      <br/>
      The bolt 178 is covered by a downwardly projecting portion 180 (FIGS. 1 and 4) of the trim portion 140 of the safety apparatus cover 90.
    </p>
    <p num="29">
      The safety apparatus 10 includes electric circuitry (not shown) including a sensor for sensing a vehicle condition such as a side impact to the vehicle 12 or a vehicle rollover condition.
      <br/>
      The electric circuitry also includes a controller for actuating the inflator in response to the output of the sensor.
      <br/>
      Upon the occurrence of a vehicle condition for which inflation of the protection device 12 is desired to help protect the occupant of the vehicle, the sensor and the controller cooperate to send an actuation signal to the inflator over lead wires.
      <br/>
      The inflator is actuated and inflation fluid is directed from the inflator into the fluid flow passage 106 in the fill tube 100.
      <br/>
      Inflation fluid flows out of the fill tube 100 into the mounting portion 152 of the side curtain 80 and begins to inflate the occupant contact portion 154 of the side curtain.
    </p>
    <p num="30">
      The inflating side curtain 80 presses outwardly on the second section 134 of the inner leg 130 of the cover 90.
      <br/>
      The inner leg 130 of the cover 90 pivots open at the hinge portion 136, enabling the second section 134 and the trim portion 140 to move out of the opening 74, to the open condition shown in FIG. 4.
      <br/>
      The outer edge portion 148 of the trim portion 140 of the cover 90 moves away from the bulb seal 60.
      <br/>
      The occupant contact portion 154 of the side curtain 80 inflates into the vehicle occupant compartment 72, as shown in FIG. 3.
      <br/>
      The side curtain 80 inflates generally vertically downward in the vehicle 12, adjacent the side structure 20 of the vehicle, to help protect an occupant of the vehicle.
    </p>
    <p num="31">
      As the side curtain 80 inflates, it needs to move only the trim portion 140 of the cover 90 out of its way, in order to inflate into the vehicle occupant compartment 72.
      <br/>
      In addition, no extra vehicle parts such as trim panels are needed to cover the opening 74 into the safety apparatus mounting chamber 70.
      <br/>
      Further, the trim portion 140 of the cover 90 remains securely attached to the vehicle 12 when the side curtain 80 inflates.

    <p num="32">
      FIG. 6 illustrates a safety apparatus 10a constructed in accordance with a second embodiment of the present invention.
      <br/>
      The safety apparatus 10a is similar in construction to the safety apparatus 10 (FIGS. 1-5) and parts which are the same or similar are given the same reference numerals with the suffix "a" added for clarity.
    </p>
    <p num="33">
      In the safety apparatus 10a, the cover 90a (FIG. 6) has a tear seam or predetermined weakened portion 200 between two exposed sections 202 and 204 of the trim portion 140a of the cover 90a.
      <br/>
      The tear seam 200 releasably connects the inner leg 130a of the cover 90a with the outer leg 124a of the cover.
      <br/>
      The tear seam 200 is formed in a known manner so as not to be visible to a vehicle occupant.
    </p>
    <p num="34">
      When the side curtain 80a is inflated, the force of the inflating side curtain ruptures the cover 90a at the tear seam 200.
      <br/>
      The cover section 202 is pivoted out of the way of the inflating side curtain 80a to enable the side curtain to inflate into the vehicle occupant compartment 72a.
