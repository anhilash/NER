      No. 60/033,956, filed Dec. 31. 1996, the entire disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference.
    </p>
    <p num="2">1. FIELD OF THE INVENTION</p>
    <p num="3">
      This invention is related to curing agent composition for epoxy resins, to two component solvent borne or solventless systems having enhanced compatibility between the epoxy resin and the curing agent, which are rapidly heat curable at ambient and sub-ambient temperatures in the absence of external catalysts/accelarators.
      <br/>
      The invention is also directed to methods of application and manufacture, as well as to the cured products made thereby.
    </p>
    <p num="4">2. BACKGROUND OF THE ART</p>
    <p num="5">There has long been a desire to formulate a curing agent which is immediately compatible with conventional epoxy resins, especially at low curing temperatures, and which is sufficiently reactive with epoxy resins that the system will cure in a wide range of temperatures, even as low as 4.4 (degree)  C., within a 24 hour period in the absence of external accelarators if possible.</p>
    <p num="6">
      Typical amine curing agents, whether aliphatic, aromatic, or adducts with epoxy resins, have terminated with at least one primary amine group.
      <br/>
      The primary amines are notorious for producing the undesired side effect of blooming or hazing in the cured product.
      <br/>
      This phenomena is thought to result from the reaction between the highly reactive primary amine groups in the curing agent with atmospheric carbon dioxide and moisture to produce carbamates, resulting in scission of the curing agent polymer chain.
      <br/>
      Blooming or hazing is more likely to be encountered when the curing agent is stored for a lengthy period of time, and applied in low temperature or high humidity environments.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      To some extent, this problem can be ameliorated by reacting out many of the primary amine hydrogens.
      <br/>
      The drawback to this approach in the past has been that the reactivity of the curing agent was impaired because secondary amines are less reactive than the primary amines, such that accelerators had to be used to obtain adequate cure times, especially at low curing temperatures.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, many of the amine curing agent adducts whose primary amine groups were converted to secondary amine groups are poorly compatible with epoxy resin.
    </p>
    <p num="8">It would be desirable to have a curing agent composition for curing epoxy resins whose primary amine groups are converted to secondary amine groups, yet is reactive enough to cure epoxy resins without external catalysts/accelerators in a wide range of curing temperatures and which is immediately compatible with a standard diglycidyl ether of Bisphenol-A.</p>
    <p num="9">3. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</p>
    <p num="10">
      There is provided a curing agent composition, a method for making a curing agent composition, two component curable epoxy resin compositions, methods of their manufacture, and the different cured products thereof.
      <br/>
      The curing agent comprises the reaction product of an a) a phenolic acid substituted with at least one carboxyl group and at least one hydrocarbyl group having at least 1 carbon atom; b) a polyepoxide compound; c) a polyamine compound having at least two primary amine groups; and d) a monoglycidyl capping agent.
      <br/>
      The compounds produced by this reaction can be characterized by having a  BETA -hydroxy ester group and a  BETA -hydroxy secondary amine group, terminated with moieties unreactive towards epoxide groups at room temperature in the absence of catalysts, and having one or more secondary amine sites throughout the compound.
    </p>
    <p num="11">
      Preferably, the phenolic acid compound is reacted with the polyepoxide compound to produce a substituted aromatic glycidyl ester compound, which is combined and reacted with the polyamine compound and the monoglycidyl capping agent.
      <br/>
      Preferable phenolic acid compounds are those having an 8 to 36 carbon branched or unbranched alkyl group.
    </p>
    <p num="12">There is also provided a two component epoxy resin composition using this curing agent composition, methods for their manufacture, and the cured products made thereby.</p>
    <p num="13">4. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</p>
    <p num="14">
      The curing agents of the invention exhibit a good overall balance of mechanical and chemical properties.
      <br/>
      The curing agents of the invention can cure epoxy resins neat or modified within 24 hours at temperatures as low as 4.4 (degree)  C. in the absence of external accelarators or catalysts.
      <br/>
      The curing agents can cure epoxy resins at 4.4 (degree)  in as short a time as within 15 hours in the absence of external accelarators.
      <br/>
      While not being limited to a theory, it is believed that the compositions can self cure without external accelarators, even at low temperatures, because the curing agent adduct contains phenolic hydroxyl groups which catalyze a reaction between the epoxide groups of the epoxy resin and the amine nitrogens of the curing agent.
      <br/>
      The curing agents also have the advantage of enhanced compatibility with epoxy resins as evidenced by the clarity of the epoxy resin/curing agent mixtures almost immediately upon mixing.
      <br/>
      This enhanced compatibility makes it unnecessary to have an induction time, improves the curing rate, and ultimately improves the mechanical properties of the cured product as compared to similar products made with conventional curing agents and given little or no induction time.
    </p>
    <p num="15">
      The curing agent is made by reacting a a) phenolic acid substituted with at least one carboxyl group and at least one hydrocarbyl group having at least 1, and preferably 8 or more, more preferably 14 or more carbon atoms, b) a polyepoxide compound c) a polyamine compound having at least two primary amine groups and d) a monoglycidyl capping agent.
      <br/>
      The ingredients a)-d) should be reacted in a sequence which will produce a compound characterized by having a  BETA -hydroxy ester group and a  BETA -hydroxy secondary amine group, terminated with moieties unreactive towards epoxide groups at room temperature in the absence of catalysts, and having one or more epoxide reactive secondary amine sites throughout the compound.
      <br/>
      Preferably, the phenolic acid compound is reacted with a polyepoxide compound to make a substituted aromatic glycidyl ester, which ester is combined with the polyamine compound and monoglycidyl capping agent.
      <br/>
      More preferably, the substituted aromatic glycidyl ester is reacted first with the total amount of the polyamine compound used in the manufacture of the curing agent, to make a glycidyl ester-amine adduct, followed by addition of the monoglycidyl capping agent with the adduct.
    </p>
    <p num="16">In another embodiment, however, one may first react the monoglycidyl capping agent with the polyamine compound to convert one of the primary amine groups to a secondary amine group, followed by reaction of the polyepoxide compound onto the free primary amine group, and finishing the reaction with addition of the phenolic acid compound onto the free epoxide linkage.</p>
    <p num="17">
      Whichever approach is used, the sequences of addition and reaction should be such to produce compounds having the above described features, that is, a  BETA -hydroxy ester group and a  BETA -hydroxy secondary amine group, terminated with moieties unreactive towards epoxide groups at room temperature in the absence of catalysts, and having one or more epoxide reactive secondary amine sites throughout the compound.
      <br/>
      The preferred method is the former described method, where the polyepoxide compound is reacted with the phenolic acid to make a substituted aromatic glycidyl ester composition, followed by combing and reacting onto the substituted aromatic glycidyl ester composition the polyamine and monoglycidyl capping agent in the stated sequence or as a mixture, more preferably in the stated sequence.
    </p>
    <p num="18">In one embodiment, the curing agent compound is characterized by the following structure:  (Chemical Structure image '1' not included in text)</p>
    <p num="19">wherein R1 is a branched or unbranched, substituted or unsubstituted, monovalent hydrocarbyl group having at least one carbon atom, preferably an alkyl group having at least an average of at least 14 carbon atoms; R2 and R4 each independently represent a branched or unbranched, substituted or unsubstituted, divalent hydrocarbyl group having 2-24 carbon atoms, preferably 2-6 carbon atoms, or  (Chemical Structure image '2' not included in text)</p>
    <p num="20">wherein R6 represents a branched or unbranched, substituted or unsubstituted, divalent hydrocarbyl group having 2-24 carbon atoms; R3 is a branched or unbranched, substituted or unsubstituted, monovalent hydrocarbyl having 1-24 carbon atoms, a polyoxyalkylene group, an aryl group, an alkaryl group, or an aralkyl group; R5 is hydrogen or a branched or unbranched, substituted or unsubstituted, monovalent hydrocarbyl having 1-24 carbon atoms, preferably hydrogen; R7 is the residue of said polyepoxide compound; and c represents an integer from 0-10, preferably from 1-10.</p>
    <p num="21">Other species may be present in the curing agent composition, such as:  (Chemical Structure image '3' not included in text)</p>
    <p num="22">wherein each R group and c is as described above.</p>
    <p num="23">
      The structure of the phenolic acid is an aromatic ring to which is covalently bonded at least one hydroxyl group, at least one hydrocarbyl group, and at least one carboxyl group.
      <br/>
      Usually and preferably, the structure of the phenolic acid will contain only one hydroxyl group and one carboxyl group bonded to the aromatic ring.
      <br/>
      However, it is rare if not impossible to commercially acquire a phenolic compound which is so pure that it contains only one species.
      <br/>
      Commercially available phenolic compounds usually contain a mixture of species, such as mono and di carboxyl substituted phenolics.
      <br/>
      Thus, while the preferable embodiment is one in which the phenolic acid contains only one of each group bonded to the aromatic ring, this embodiment includes a phenolic which contains a mixture of species in which the predominant(&gt;70 mole percent) species has only one carboxy group and one hydroxyl group bonded to the aromatic ring.
    </p>
    <p num="24">
      One of the substituents on the aromatic ring of the phenolic acid is the hydrocarbyl group.
      <br/>
      While the hydrocarbyl group can comprise a wide variety of structures and atoms, it must have a predominantly hydrocarbon character.
      <br/>
      Included within the meaning of a hydrocarbyl group are the alkyl or alkenyl groups, the aliphatic substituted aromatic or alicyclics, or the aromatic or alicyclic substituted alkyls or alkenyls.
      <br/>
      Each of these groups may be branched or unbranched.
      <br/>
      The phenolic acid preferably contains at least 50 mole % species which have only one hydrocarbyl substituent.
    </p>
    <p num="25">
      The substituent on the substituted aryl amidopolyamine is at least one hydrocarbyl group having at least one carbon atom.
      <br/>
      Longer chain hydrocarbyl groups are preferred.
      <br/>
      All else remaining equal, a curing agent having longer chain hydrocarbyl substituents, i.e. 8 or more, preferably greater than 12, and most preferably 14 or more, tend to be more hydrophobic than the curing agents having short chain hydrocarbyl groups on the order of 1-7 carbon atoms.
      <br/>
      In many applications, the hydrophobic character of the hydrocarbyl substituent is desirable to improve the compatibility of the curing agent with the epoxy resin component.
      <br/>
      Further, long chain hydrocarbyl substituents are somewhat more flexible than their shorter chain counterparts, thus lowering the glass transition temperature of the curing agent.
      <br/>
      It is desirable to have a curing agent with a lowered glass transition temperature to improve its flow properties in low temperature curing conditions.
      <br/>
      Thus, the most preferred hydrocarbyl groups are those having 14 or more carbon atoms.
      <br/>
      Although there is no particular upper limit on number of carbon atoms, the most common number of carbon atoms used within this invention will be 14-24, more typically from 14-18, although hydrocarbons with up to 36 carbon atoms are also available.
    </p>
    <p num="26">
      Of the types of hydrocarbyl substituents, the alkyls are preferred.
      <br/>
      These can be branched or unbranched, preferably unbranched or having no more than I branch per 6 backbone carbon atoms.
      <br/>
      Examples of alkyl substituents having at least about 8 carbon atoms include octyl, nonyl, decyl, isodecyl, dodecyl, pentadecyl, eicosyl, triacontyl and the like, as well as radicals derived from substantially saturated petroleum fractions, olefin polymers and highly refined white oils or synthetic alkanes.
    </p>
    <p num="27">
      Other types of hydrocarbyl groups which are suitable include substituted hydrocarbyl groups; that is, groups containing non-hydrocarbon substituents which do not alter the predominantly hydrocarbon character of the group.
      <br/>
      Examples are halo, nitro, cyano, ether, carbonyl, and sulfonyl groups.
      <br/>
      Also included are hetero atoms which are atoms other than carbon present within a chain or ring otherwise composed of carbon atoms.
      <br/>
      Suitable hetero atoms include, for example, nitrogen, oxygen, and sulfur.
      <br/>
      Further included within the meaning of the hydrocarbyl group are the alkoxy compounds.
    </p>
    <p num="28">Preferably, no more than an average of one substituent or hetero atom will be present for each 10 carbon atoms in the hydrocarbyl group, and most preferably, the hydrocarbyl group does not contain any hetero atoms or substituents.</p>
    <p num="29">
      The phenolic acid may contain more than one hydrocarbyl substituent on the aromatic ring.
      <br/>
      The dihydrocarbyl substituted phenolic acids may have a long chain hydrocarbyl of 14 or more carbon atoms and a short chain hydrocarbyl of 1-4 carbon atoms attached to the aromatic ring, or both of the hydrocarbyls may be long chain.
      <br/>
      As noted above, however, preferably greater than 50 mole % of the species contain only one hydrocarbyl substituent.
    </p>
    <p num="30">
      The phenols on which the hydrocarbyl and carboxyl groups are situated are aromatic compounds containing at least one, and preferably one, hydroxyl group.
      <br/>
      Examples are phenol,  ALPHA - or  BETA -naphthols, resorcinol, hydroquinone, 4,4'-dioxydiphenyl, 4,4'-dioxydiphenylether, 4,4'-dioxydiphenylsulfone, 4,4'-dioxydiphenylmethane, the condensation products of phenol and formaldehyde known as novolacs, and bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)alkyls or ethers or sulfones optionally substituted with alkyl groups on the aromatic rings.
      <br/>

      To manufacture the substituted aromatic glycidyl ester composition, the phenolic acid described above is reacted with an polyepoxide at an elevated temperature, typically from 140 (degree)  C. to 180 (degree)  C., for a time sufficient to substantially complete the reaction, usually from about 1 to about 8 hours.
      <br/>
      It is advisable not to let the reaction temperature rise too much above 170 (degree)  C.-180 (degree)  C. for an extended period of time in order to avoid the possibility of de-carboxylating the phenolic compound, which would result in the production of free phenolic compounds in the reaction mixture.
      <br/>
      The reaction can be conducted at any pressure ranging from a partial vacuum to superatmospheric pressure.
      <br/>
      To drive the esterification reaction between the carboxyl group on the phenolic compound and the polyepoxide compound to completion, it is preferred to apply a partial vacuum either during the course of the reaction or towards the tail end of the reaction.
      <br/>
      The reaction is substantially completed when free acid can no longer be detected in the composition.
      <br/>
      The ingredients can be mixed together and subsequently reacted, but preferably, the phenolic acid is added to the polyepoxide compound so as to reduce the possibility of reacting both of the oxirane groups on the polyepoxide compound with the phenolic acid.

      It is desirable to use a molar excess of the polyepoxide compound so that one of the oxirane groups on the polyepoxide compound is free to react with the polyamine compound and does not react with further phenolic acids.
      <br/>
      If a stoichiometric amount of the phenolic acid is added to the polyepoxide compound such as at a molar ratio of polyepoxide to phenolic acid of 0.5:1 or less (the stoichiometry proceeding upon the assumption that the phenolic acid has only one functional group, the acid group, and a diepoxide is used), then both of the oxirane groups will be consumed by the acid group on the phenolic compound.
      <br/>
      Therefore, a stoichiometric excess of oxirane groups (&gt;0.5:1) is desired to ensure that the substituted aromatic glycidyl ester compound has free oxirane groups available for reaction with the polyamine compound.

      The invention is also directed to two component epoxy compositions having an A epoxy resin component and a B curing agent component.
      <br/>
      The epoxy resin component has at least one 1,2-epoxy group per molecule.
      <br/>
      Mixtures of epoxy compounds having one epoxy functionality and two or more epoxy groups are also suitable.
      <br/>
      The epoxy compounds having two or more epoxy groups per molecule means that the nominal functionality is two or more.
      <br/>
      Generally epoxy resins contain a distribution of compounds with a varying number of 1,2-epoxy equivalency.
      <br/>
      The actual average functionality of these epoxy compounds is about 1.5 or more.
      <br/>
      Any of the epoxy compounds can be saturated or unsaturated, linear or branched, aliphatic, cycloaliphatic, aromatic or heterocyclic, and may bear substituents.
      <br/>
      Such substituents can include bromine or fluorine.
      <br/>
      They may be monomeric or polymeric, liquid or solid, but are preferably liquid or a low melting solid at room temperature.
    </p>
    <p num="79">
      The epoxy compounds can be of the glycidyl ether type prepared by reacting epichlorohydrin with a compound containing at least one aromatic hydroxyl group carried out under alkaline reaction conditions.
      <br/>
      Examples of other epoxy resins suitable for use in the invention include diglycidyl ethers of dihydric compounds, epoxy novolacs and cycloaliphatic epoxies.
      <br/>
      Specific examples of the epoxy resins useful in the A epoxy resin component are described above with reference to the reaction between the phenolic acid and the polyepoxide compound.
    </p>
    <p num="80">
      The two component epoxy resin composition is either solvent borne or solventless.
      <br/>
      Suitable solvents are described above, with preference given to ketones, alcohols, and xylene.
      <br/>
      Solventless epoxy resin compositions are those compositions which are applied in the absence of a solvent and in the absence of an aqueous medium.
    </p>
    <p num="81">
      The two component compositions of the invention are mixed and cured, preferably in the absence of external accelerators, in a wide range of temperatures ranging from -25 (degree)  C. to 100 (degree)  C. One advantage of the invention is that the curing agent composition of the invention and the epoxy resin can cure, once mixed, within 24 hours at 4.4 (degree)  C., and even in as short a time as within 15 hours at 4.4 (degree)  C. in the absence of external accelerators.
      <br/>
      This is unexpected since many, if not all, of the primary amine groups are reacted out with the monoglycidyl capping agent, thus otherwise lowering the reactivity of the curing agent.
      <br/>
      For measurement purposes, the two component mixture is "cured" or "curable" when it cures or has the capacity to cure to a hard gel (cotton free) at the designated temperature in the absence of external accelerators and at 50% relative humidity.
      <br/>
      At 25 (degree)  C., the curing agent composition of the invention can cure an epoxy resin in as quick as 5 hours.
      <br/>
      At lower temperatures, the amount of time required for cure naturally increases, although due to the excellent compatibility between the curing agent composition and the epoxy resin used in the invention, the overall time to cure at any given temperature is dramatically reduced compared to epoxy resins mixed with other types of curing agents.
    </p>
    <p num="82">
      Advantageously, the curable epoxy resin composition is cured in the absence of catalyst compounds which accelarate the reaction between the curing agent and the epoxy resin, commonly known as accelerators An accelarator, however, can be included, if desired, to increase the cure rate of the epoxy resin-curing agent system beyond that already achieved in its absence.
      <br/>
      Various amine-compatible accelarator scan be used as long as they are soluble in the amine curing agents.
      <br/>
      Examples of accelarators include metal salts such as, for example, sulfonates, phosphonates, sulfates, tetrafluoroborates, carboxylates and nitrates of Groups IA, IIA and transition metal series of the Periodic Table (CAS version), preferably Mg, Ca, Zn and Sn salts, and complexes thereof; inorganic acids such as, for example, HBF4, H2 SO4, H2 NSO3 H and H3 PO4 ; carboxylic acids, preferably hydroxy-substituted carboxyl ic acids such as, for example, salicylic, lactic, glycolic and resorcylic; phenolic compounds such as, for example, phenol, t-butylphenol, nonylphenol and bisphenol A; imidazoles; cyanamide compounds such as dicyandiamide and cyanamide; sulfonamides such as, for example p-toluenesulfonamide, methanesulfonamide, N-methylbenzenesulfonamide and sulfamide; and imides such as, for example, phthalimide, succinimide, perylenetetracarboxylicdiimide and saccharin.
    </p>
    <p num="83">
      When the cure rate at the desired temperature is suboptimal, it is sometimes desirable to include the accelerator.
      <br/>
      For example, for adhesive applications and civil engineering applications where application at low temperature is desired, it may be desirable to include the accelarator.
      <br/>
      The accelarators are typically present in an amount of from about 0.1 weight percent to about 10 weight percent, preferably to 5 weight percent, based on the epoxy resin, if used at all.
    </p>
    <p num="84">The storage stable composition of the invention may include other additives, such as fillers, elastomers, uv-stabilizers, extenders, plasticizers, accelerators, pigments, reinforcing agents, flow control agents and flame retardants depending on the application.</p>
    <p num="85">
      For coating applications, the curable two component epoxy resin composition can also contain pigments of the conventional type such as iron oxides, lead oxides, strontium chromate, carbon black, titanium dioxide, talc, barium sulfate, phthalocyanine blue and green, cadmium red, iron blue, chromic green, lead silicate, silica, silicates and the like.
      <br/>
      Such pigments can be added to the polyamine curing agent component or the epoxy resin component prior to mixing them together.
      <br/>
      Their amounts usually range from 20 to 100 pbw based on the weight of the epoxy resin and the curing agent composition.
    </p>
    <p num="86">
      For floor topping application, the curable epoxy resin composition can also contain a filler such as sand, other siliceous materials, iron or other metals.
      <br/>
      Small amounts of thixotropic agents, coloring agents, inert plasticizers, and leveling agents can also be incorporated in the curable epoxy resin composition if desired.
      <br/>
      These curable flooring compositions can be trowelled, sprayed or brushed on to a floor substrate.
    </p>
    <p num="87">
      The curing agent composition of the invention contains no added solvents or water when used in powder coating applications.
      <br/>
      In applications where the curing agent composition is applied wet to a substrate, the curing agent composition is non-aqueous and is either dissolved in solvents or is applied neat, or solventless.
      <br/>
      Preferably, some amount of solvent is used in the curing agent composition and in the two component epoxy resin composition to reduce the viscosity of the curing agent and/or the epoxy resin compositions, especially in cold temperature applications.
      <br/>
      The reduction in viscosity facilitates the handling and application of the composition in various environments.
      <br/>
      Suitable solvents include alcohols, ketones, esters, ethers of hydrocarbons.
      <br/>
      Examples of suitable solvents are butanol, methyl isobutyl ketone, toluene, ethylglycol acetate, xylene, benzyl alcohol, phthalic acid esters of monohydric alcohols, e.g. n-butanol, amylalcohol, 2-ethylhexanol, nonanol, benzyl alcohol, gamma -butyrolactone, delta-valerolactone, epsilon-caprolactone, lower and higher molecular weight polyols, e.g. glycerol trimethylol-ethane or -propane, ethyleneglycol, and ethoxylated or propoxylated polyhydric alcohols, either individually or in admixture.
      <br/>
      The amount of solvent can range from 0 to 80 wt. %. The solids concentration can range from 20 wt. % to 100 wt. %, preferably from 65 wt. % to 85 wt. %.
    </p>
    <p num="88">
      Defoamers, tints, slip agents, thixotropes, etc., are common auxiliary components to most coatings and may be employed in the composition of the present invention.
      <br/>
      Flow control agents are typically used in amounts ranging from 0.05 to 5 wt. %, based on the combined weight of the epoxy resin and the curing agent composition.
    </p>
    <p num="89">
      Re-inforcing agents may be added to either of the components, and include natural and synthetic fibers in the form of woven, mat, monofilament, chopped fibers and the like.
      <br/>
      Other materials for re-inforcing include glass, ceramics, nylon, rayon, cotton, aramid, graphite and combinations thereof.
      <br/>
      Suitable fillers include inorganic oxides, inorganic carbonates, ceramic microspheres, plastic microspheres, glass microspheres, clays, sand, gravel and combinations thereof.
      <br/>
      The fillers can be used in amounts suitably from 0 to 100 pbw of the combined epoxy/curing agent components.
    </p>
    <p num="90">Aside from coating applications, the curing agent compositions of the invention and the two component compositions utilizing the curing agents composition scan be used in such applications as flooring, casting, crack or defect repair, molding, adhesives, potting, filament winding, encapsulation, structural and electrical laminates, composites and the like.</p>
    <p num="91">
      A typical use for the two component compositions of the invention is in coatings.
      <br/>
      The heat-curable coating composition can be applied to a substrate by brush, spray, or rollers.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, the curing agent compositions can be mixed and dried to a powder for powder coating applications.
      <br/>
      In the case where the coating is applied wet, the epoxy resin composition is preferably a liquid resin, a semi solid resin, or in solution, at the application temperature.
      <br/>
      The same is true for the curing agent composition.
    </p>
    <p num="92">
      The curing agent compositions of the invention can also be used in thermosetting powder coating compositions prepared by the various methods known to the powder coating industry: dry blending, melt compounding by two roll mill or extruder and spray drying.
      <br/>
      Typically the process used is the melt compounding process: dry blending solid ingredients in a planetary mixer and then melt blending the admixture in an extruder at a temperature within the range of about 80 (degree)  C. to 130 (degree)  C. The extrudate is then cooled and pulverized into a particulate blend.
    </p>
    <p num="93">
      The thermosetting powder composition can then be applied directly to a substrate of, e.g., a metal such as steel or aluminum.
      <br/>
      Non-metallic substrates such as plastics and composites can also be used.
      <br/>
      Application can be by electrostatic spraying or by use of a fluidized bed.
      <br/>
      Electrostatic spraying is the preferred method.
      <br/>
      The coating powder can be applied in a single sweep or in several passes to provide a film thickness after cure of about 2.0 to about 15.0 mils.
    </p>
    <p num="94">
      The substrate can optionally be preheated prior to application of a powder composition to promote uniform and thicker powder deposition.
      <br/>
      After application of the powder, the powder-coated substrate is baked, typically at about 120 (degree)  C., preferably from about 150 (degree)  C., to about 205 (degree)  C. for a time sufficient to cure the powder coating composition, typically from about 1 minute to about 60 minutes, preferably from about 10 minutes to about 30 minutes.
