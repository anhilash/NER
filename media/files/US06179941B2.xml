      Field of the Invention
    </p>
    <p num="3">The present invention relates to a pneumatic tire having a layer for preventing of air permeation which enables a reduction in the weight of the tire and is superior in bonding with a rubber layer, without detracting from the retention of air pressure in the tire and also relates to a process for the production of the same.</p>
    <p num="4">The present invention further relates to a pneumatic tire having a layer for preventing of air permeation which enables a reduction in the weight of the tire, is superior in bonding with the rubber layer, and, in superior in water resistance, heat resistance, and, in some cases, durability etc., without detracting from the retention of air pressure in the tire and also relates to a process for the production of the same.</p>
    <p num="5">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
    <p num="6">
      The reduction of fuel consumption is one of the major technical problems to be solved in the automobile industry.
      <br/>
      There have been increasingly stronger demands for reduction of the weight of the pneumatic tires as part thereof.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      The inner surface of a pneumatic tire is provided with an inner liner layer composed of a low gas-permeable rubber such as halogenated butyl rubber so as to enable the tire air pressure to be kept constant.
      <br/>
      A halogenated butyl rubber, however, suffers from a large hysteresis loss.
      <br/>
      For this reason, when, after vulcanization of the tire, there are waves formed in the inner surface rubber of the carcass layer and the inner liner layer in the space between the carcass cords, the inner liner rubber layer deforms along with the deformation of the carcass layer.
      <br/>
      Thus there is the problem that the rolling resistance increases.
      <br/>
      Therefore, in general, the inner liner layer (e.g., halogenated butyl rubber) and inner surface rubber of the carcass layer are joined through a rubber sheet which is called a tie gum with a small hysteresis loss.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, in addition to the thickness of the inner liner layer of the halogenated butyl rubber, there is added the thickness of the tie gum and the layer as a whole becomes a thickness of over 1 mm (i.e., 1000  MU m).
      <br/>
      As a result, this becomes one factor increasing the weight of the final tire product.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      Various proposals have been made for using various materials, in place of the low gas-permeable rubber such as butyl rubber, as the inner liner layer or other air permeation preventive layer of the pneumatic tire.
      <br/>
      For example, Japanese Examined Patent Publication (Kokoku) No. 47-31761 discloses the coating of the inner surface of a vulcanized tire from 0.1 mm or less of a solution or dispersion of a synthetic resin such as polyvinylidene chloride, a saturated polyester resin, or a polyamide resin having an air permeation coefficient (cm3 (standard state)/cm * sec * mmHg)) of not more than 1.0 * 10-12 or less at 30 (degree)  C. and of 5.0 * 10-12 or less at 70 (degree)  C.

      The techniques disclosed in this publication provide the inner surface of the carcass of a vulcanized tire or the inner surface of the inner liner with a coating of a synthetic resin having a specific air permeation coefficient and making the thickness of the synthetic resin coating 0.1 mm or less, but the pneumatic tire disclosed in the publication had a problem in the bonding between the rubber and synthetic resin and further had a defect that, when a polyamide resin was used as the inner liner layer, the heat resistance and moisture resistance (or water resistance) were poor.
      <br/>
      Note that this publication did not disclose the use of an alkoxyalkylated polyamide, multiple copolymer polyamide resin, alkoxyalkylated polyamide, etc.

      Several proposals have been made for using a vinylidene chloride resin for an air permeation preventive layer of a pneumatic tire.
      <br/>
      For example, Japanese Examined Patent Publication (Kokoku) No. 47-31761 proposes a tube-less tire which is coated with a synthetic resin such as a vinylidene chloride resin and discloses a vinylidene chloride-acryl ester copolymer.
      <br/>
      Further, Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication (Kokai) No. 5-278409 proposes to construct an inner liner layer by coating a thin film or solution of a vinylidene chloride-vinyl chloride copolymer on the inner surface of a tire, followed by vulcanizing.
      <br/>
      A vinylidene chloride-vinyl chloride copolymer, however, has a Tg of 40 (degree)  C. or less and is inferior in long term heat resistance, and therefore, is not suitable for long term use at temperatures of, for example, about 80 (degree)  C. A vinylidene chloride-vinyl chloride copolymer includes a large amount of chlorine, and therefore, easily degrades under heat.
      <br/>
      Further, most of them include up to 10% by weight of plasticizers for improving the workability or processability, but these plasticizers shift and the film hardens and the physical properties deteriorate.
      <br/>
      Thus there is the problem that they are not practical.
    </p>
    <p num="11">
      Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication (Kokai) No. 5-330307 discloses to halogenate the inner surface of the tire (using a conventionally known chlorination solution, bromine solution, or iodine solution) and form on top of that a polymer coating (thickness of 10 to 200 Em) of methoxymethyl nylon, a copolymer nylon, a blend of polyurethane and polyvinylidene chloride, or a blend of polyurethane and polyvinylidene fluoride.
      <br/>
      This publication, however, discloses the use of an acid catalyst composed of an organic acid such as citric acid or tartaric acid as a cross-linking catalyst for curing the methoxymethylated nylon, but such an acid catalyst causes the problem of an inferior flex fatique due to deterioration after curing and of early cracking during use and it is difficult to say that the bondability is sufficient either.
      <br/>
      Further, the art disclosed in the publication suffers from the problem of a poor moisture resistance (or water resistance) or heat resistance of the air permeation preventive layer when an uncross-linked or uncured polyamide resin is used, as the inner liner layer due to the non-crosslinking or curing thereof.
    </p>
    <p num="12">
      Further, Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication (Kokai) No. 5-318618 discloses a pneumatic tire having a thin film of methoxymethylated nylon as an inner liner.
      <br/>
      According to this proposal, the inner surface of a green tire is sprayed or coated with a solution or emulsion of methoxymethylated nylon, then the tire is vulcanized or alternatively the inner surface of a vulcanized tire is sprayed or coated with a solution or emulsion of methoxymethylated nylon so as to produce a pneumatic tire.
      <br/>
      However, since there is no treatment for bonding between the rubber of the inner surface of the tire and the methoxymethylated nylon, when the tire is used at a high load, there are still the problem that the methoxymethylated nylon film peels off from the rubber of the inner surface of the tire and the problem that the resistance to humidity (or water resistance) and heat resistance of the inner liner layer are poor due to the fact the methoxymethylated nylon is not cross-linked or cured.

      The cross-linkable elastic polyamide usable in the present invention and produced by these methods is used in an amount not detracting from the pliability suitable for a cross-linked article, that is, is made preferably 50% or less, further, more preferably 3 to 20%.
      <br/>
      Further, the flexibility given by the N-alkoxyalkylization must be stopped at the extent at which the physical properties are practical.
      <br/>
      It is preferable to use one with an N-substitution rate of 30 to 50%.

    </p>
    <p num="39">
      Examples of the cross-linking agents other than acid catalysts which may be used for cross-linking the modified aliphatic polyamide resin in the first aspect of the present invention are sulfur alone, sulfur-releasing compounds (e.g., tetramethylthiuram disulfide, morpholine disulfide, tetraethylthiuram disulfide, tetrabutylthiuram disulfide, dipentamethylenethiuram pentamethylene, dimethyldiphenylthiuram disulfide), rubber vulcanization accelerators (e.g., thiazoles such as 2-mercaptobenzothiazole, dibenzothiazyl-disulfide, 2-mercaptobenzothiazole zinc salts, and dithio acid salts such as dichlorohexyl-benzothiazyl-sulfenamide, thiurams such as tetramethylthiuram disulfide, tetramethylthiuram monosulfide, tetraethylthiuram disulfide, and dipentamethylenethiuram tetrasulfide, and zinc dimethyldithiocarbaminate, guanidines such as diphenylguanidine, thioureas such as 1,3-diphenylthiourea), etc.

      Note that in addition to the above-mentioned crosslinking agents, it is also possible to use peroxides such as dicumylperoxide (DCP).
    </p>
    <p num="40">For the cross-linking agent, to smooth the cross-linking reaction, it is possible to use jointly an organic halogen donor (e.g., chlorosulfonated polyethylene or chloroprene) or an inorganic halogenated substance (e.g., stannous chloride, calcium chloride, iron chloride, aluminum chloride, zinc chloride, calcium fluoride, zinc bromide), etc. in an amount of 0.1 to 5 parts by weight, based on 100 parts by weight of the polymer.</p>

    <p num="45">
      In the production of the pneumatic tire according to the first aspect of the present invention, it is possible to halogenate the surface of the carcass layer or the rubber layer on top of the same by an ordinary method.
      <br/>
      This halogenation treatment may be performed, for example, using a chlorine solution, bromine solution, iodine solution, etc. for halogenation of general rubber.

      <br/>
      Here, the multi component copolymer polyamide resin means a three component or four component or greater copolymer polyamide of a specific copolymerization ratio such as a copolyamido nylon such as nylon 6/nylon 66 (for example, a copolymerization ratio of 70/30 to 50/50) and further nylon 6/nylon 66/nylon 610, nylon 6/nylon 66/nylon 12, nylon 6/nylon 66/nylon 610/nylon 12, etc.

    <p num="102">Examples of preferable examples of these adhesives are phenol resin types (e.g., Chemlock 234B made by LORD Co.), chlorinated rubber types (e.g., Chemlock 205 made by LORD Co.), isocyanate type (e.g., Chemlock 402 made by LORD Co.), etc. The amount of the adhesive used is as in the past and is not particularly limited.</p>

      The material of the rubber layer for bonding with the air permeation preventive layer according to the fourth aspect of the present invention is not particularly limited.
      <br/>
      Any rubber material which has been generally used as a rubber material for a tire in the past may be used.
      <br/>
      Examples of such a rubber are rubber compositions composed of diene rubbers such as NR, IR, BR, and SBR, halogenated butyl rubbers, ethylene-propylene copolymer rubbers, styrene elastomers, etc. to which have been added blending agents such as carbon black, process oil, and vulcanization agents.

    <p num="104">
      The air permeation preventive layer according to the fourth aspect of the present invention has a softening point of 80 (degree)  C. or more, preferably 100 (degree)  C. or more, an air permeation coefficient of 25 * 10-12 cc * cm/cm2 * sec * cmHg (at 30 (degree)  C.) or less, preferably 0.05 * 10-12 to 10 * 10-12 cc * cm/cm2 * sec * cmHg (at 30 (degree)  C.) or less.
      <br/>
      When the air permeation coefficient is 25 * 10-12 cc * cm/cm2 * sec * cmHg (at 30 (degree)  C.) or less, the thickness of the air permeation preventive layer can be made 1/2 or less of the thickness of the conventional air permeation preventive layers.

      On the other hand, the Young's modulus is 1 to 500 MPa, preferably 10 to 300 MPa.
      <br/>
      When the Young's modulus is less than 1 MPa, then wrinkles will form at the time of forming the tire, whereby handling will become difficult, while when more than, 500 MPa, it is not possible for the film to follow the deformation of the tire during use.

    <p num="153">As explained above, according to the first aspect of the present invention, it is possible to obtain a pneumatic tire having an air permeation preventive layer which enables the weight of the tire to be reduced while maintaining an excellent air pressure retention in the tire and which is superior in bonding with a rubber layer.</p>
    <p num="154">Examples II-1 to II-8 and Comparative Examples II-1 to II-4</p>
    <p num="155">
      Examples II-1 to II-4 and Comparative Examples II-1 to II-2 are examples of coating a multi component copolymer polyamide resin composition before vulcanization of the tire.
      <br/>
      The inner surface of a green tire molded by an ordinary method and comprised of unvulcanized rubber is halogenated (brush-coated with a 3.3% solution of trichloroisocyanuric acid in ethyl acetate and then dried for 2 hours) or coated with an adhesive (brush coated and dried for 2 hours), then was spray-coated by a solution comprised of a mixed solvent of 70% by weight of methanol and 30% by weight of methyl ethyl ketone in which has been dissolved a multi component copolymer polyamide resin in a proportion of 20% by weight (in the Examples, a curable resin and curing agent were added).
      <br/>
      This is blown on by hot air of 80 (degree)  C. for 2 minutes, then vulcanized by a tire vulcanizer at 185 (degree)  C. for 15 minutes at a pressure of 2.3 MPa.

      Multi component copolymer nylon solutions of the formulations of Examples and Comparative Examples dissolved in a proportion of 20% by weight in a mixed solvent of 70% by weight of methanol and 30% by weight of methyl ethyl ketone were formed into films by the film casting method (uniformly casting a polymer solution on an endless belt, continuously drying it by blowing hot air of 60 to 90 (degree)  C., then peeling to form a film).
      <br/>
      After drying, these films were allowed to stand in a 130 (degree)  C. heater for 10 minutes to cure. (Film: thickness of approximately 100  MU m)

    <p num="177">A 165SR13 steel radial tire (rim 13 * 41/2-J) was used and run on a  PHI 1707 mm drum at a speed of 140 km/h at an air pressure of 250 kPa, a load of 2.5 kN, and a room temperature of 45 (degree)  C.</p>
    <p num="178">
      After 25,000 km, the tire was removed from the rim and the liner layer at the inside surface of the tire was visually examined.
      <br/>
      Liner layers with cracks, visible wrinkles, or peeled or blistered liner layers were judged as failing and those without them as passing.
      <br/>
      Note that just before the test run, the tire was allowed to stand for 14 days at a room temperature of 80 (degree)  C. or more.
    </p>
    <p num="179">The test was designed to recreate on an indoor drum and evaluate as a whole the durability due to heat degradation of the liner layer.</p>
