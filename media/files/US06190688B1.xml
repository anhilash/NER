    <heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">
      The present invention relates to a material for detoxification or elimination of super antigens such as staphylococcal enterotoxin and streptococcal exotoxin.
      <br/>
      This material binds with super antigens existing in a protein solution at a high concentration such as in the human blood etc., it is preferably used as an (antidote) medicine for reducing or eliminating toxic activity of super antigens, as in a purification column for eliminating super antigen or as wound dressing material.
    </p>
    <heading>DESCRIPTION OF THE RELEVANT ART</heading>
    <p num="3">
      Super antigens are a group of proteins which can directly bind with a major histocompatibility antigen class II proteins (hereinbelow it is called "MHC class II" in some cases) on an antigen presentins cell without passing through processing in the antigen presenting cell.
      <br/>
      Super antigens are different from conventional antigens and furthermore, stimulate a T-cell by forming a complex of this MHC class II and the T cell.
      <br/>
      Several restrictions exist in binding the T-cell for the conventional antigens, and number of T-cells reacting with conventional antigens is usually at most one per ten thousand, but as the super antigen binds only to the variable region of the  BETA -chain of the T-cell receptor, certain kinds of super antigens stimulate one T-cell among five T-cells.
      <br/>
      As the result, it is thought that super antigens stimulate extraordinarily the immune system to generate fevers, rash and hypotension during sepsis and vomiting during food posioning or autoimmune diseases (D. L. Murray et al, American Society of Microbiology News. 61(5) p229 (1995)).
      <br/>
      As the super antigens, staphylococcal enterotoxin, Streptococcal exotoxin, Yersinial exotoxin, certain virus proteins and heat shock proteins have been confirmed and it is possible that other super antigens will be found in the future.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      Up to this time, as those substances which have affinity with these super antigens, antibodies to these super antigens have been described (P. M. Rosten et al.
      <br/>
      Journal of Clinical Microbiology 25(2) p327 (1987)), major histocompatibility antigen class II proteins and fragments thereof (J. K. Russell et al.
      <br/>
      Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications, 168, p696 (1990)), ion exchange resins (H.
      <br/>
      Igarashi etc., Infection and Immunity 44(1) p175 (1984)) etc., are known and they have been used as binding substances for adsorbing super antigens in blood and culture supernatant.
      <br/>
      However, most of these binding subtances are proteins and peptides and they are easily deactivated by sterilization.
      <br/>
      In addition, affinity between ion exchange resins and super antigens is easily reduced by the influence of pH of the solution; specificity is decreased in the neutral region.
      <br/>
      Therefore, they are not suitable as a material having sufficient affinity for super antigens in solutions having a high protein concentration as blood, foods etc., where the pH should be kept neutral.
    </p>
    <heading>OBJECT OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="5">
      The present invention has as its objective, to solve the disadvantages of the conventional technologies by providing a material with excellent selective affinity for super antigens even in a highly concentrated protein solution at a pH in the neutral region, possessing residual activity after sterilization and are also inexpensive.
      <br/>
      Namely, the material of the present invention has a high affinity for super antigens and it can bind with super antigens existing in body fluids such as blood and urine, foods, drinks and medicines.
      <br/>
      It is possible by these bindings that the toxin-like activities of the super antigens can be eliminated (detoxification) by changing such properties of the super antigens as their conformations or by shielding the binding sites with MHC class II or/and T-cells.
      <br/>
      Namely, when the material of the present invention is used as a medicine, it is possible to effectively treat the effects of food poisoning, sepsis and autoimmune diseases or to prevent them from occurring.
      <br/>
      In addition, if this material is water-insoluble, it becomes possible to eliminate super antigens from body fluids such as blood and urine, foods, drinks and medicines to treat the effects of food poisoning, sepsis and autoimmune diseases and to prevent them from occurring.
      <br/>
      Especially, it is suitable as a body fluid purifying column for eliminating super antigens or as a super antigen-adsorbing wound dressing material.
      <br/>
      In addition, it may be used as a quantitative measuring material, making it possible to diagnose food poisoning, sepsis and autoimmune diseases.
      <br/>
      The present invention provides a material which enables diagnosis and therapy of these diseases and to prevent them from occurring.

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="16">
      There are no special limitations as the substituent of the urea bond or the thiourea bond and aliphatic compounds such as a hexyl group, octyl group and dodecyl group and alicyclic compounds such as cyclohexane and cyclopentane are used, but aromatic compounds such as a phenyl group, naphthyl group and anthranyl group are more preferably used.
      <br/>
      In addition, derivatives such derivatives as aminohexyl group, monomethylaminohexyl group, dimethylaminohexyl group, aminooctyl group, aminododecyl group and tolyl group, chlorophenyl group, nitrophenyl group, diphenylmethyl group and aminodiphenylmethyl group are also preferably used.
      <br/>
      In addition, compounds containing a group capable of forming hydrogen bonds such as amino group, hydroxyl group, carboxyl group and mercapto group are preferably used as substituents.
      <br/>
      For example, such compounds as having hydroxyl group, hydroxypropane, 1,3-diamino-2-hydroxypropane, hydroxybutanone, hydroxybutyric acid and hydroxypyrimidine and glucides such as monosaccharides, oligosaccharides and polysaccharides such as glucose, glucosamine, galactosamine, maltose, cellobiose, sucrose, agarose, cellulose, chitin, chitosan and derivatives thereof, and such compounds as having amino group, diethylenetriamine, triethylenetetramine, tetraethylepentamine, dipropylenetriamine, polyethyleneimine, N-methyl-2,2'-diaminodiethylamine are preferably used.
      <br/>
      The material of the present invention can have most preferably both an aromatic compound and a group capable of forming a hydrogen bond such as an amino group or a hydroxyl group-containing compound (including glucides or their derivatives) as substituents of a urea bond or a thiourea bond.
    </p>
    <p num="17">
      In addition, as either monomers, oligomers or polymers can be used as the material of the present invention, such compounds as polymerized compounds of the above described substituents or a part thereof are also in the range of materials of the present invention.
      <br/>
      Namely, as the above described substituents or a part thereof, a repeating unit of synthetic polymers such as nylon, polymethyl methacrylate, polysulfone, polystyrene, polyethylene, polyvinyl alcohol and polytetrafluoroethylene and natural polymers such as cellulose, collagen, chitin, chitosan and their derivatives, are preferably used.
      <br/>
      Namely, it is preferably performed to introduce urea bonds or thiourea bonds into these synthetic polymers prepared of homo-polymerization, copolymerization, blending and natural polymers.
      <br/>
      In addition, those products prepared by coating an inorganic material such as metals, ceramics and glass with an appropriate polymer are also preferably used.
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      In addition, polyurea or polythiourea wherein a plurality of urea bonds or thiourea bonds exist in the molecular structure is preferable as a material of the present invention.
      <br/>
      In this case, any one of the above described substituents can be used as the substituent of the urea bond or the thiourea bond, it is most preferable to incorporate both an aromatic compound and a compound having a group capable of forming a hydrogen bond such as amino group or hydroxyl group-containing compound (including glucides and their derivatives).
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      The material of the present invention can be synthesized by generally known methods.
      <br/>
      For example, when a urea bond or a thioures bond is introduced into an aliphatic compound and an aromatic compound, a method wherein an isocyanate derivative or an isothiocyanate derivative is reacted with an amino compound can be used.
      <br/>
      As the isocyanates or the isothiocyanates, for example, aliphatic isocyanates or isothiocyanates such as ethyl isocyanate, stearyl isocyanate, n-butyl isocyanate, iso-butyl isocyanate, n-propyl isocyanate, methyl isothiocyanate, ethyl isothiocyanate, n-butyl isothiocyanate, benzyl isothiocyanate, hexamethylenediisocyanate, cyclohexyl isocyanate, cyclohexyl-isothiocyanate and cyclohexyldiisocyanate can be used, but aromatic isocyanates or isothiocyanates such as phenyl isocyanate, chlorophenyl isocyanate, fluorophenyl isocyanate, bromophenyl isocyanate, nitrophenyl isocyanate, tolylphenyl isocyanate, methoxyphenyl isocyanate, l-naphthyl isocyanate, 4,4'-diphenylmethanediisocyanate, 3,3',5.5'-tetraethyl-4,4'-diisocyanatediphenylmethane, phenyl isothiocyanate, chlorophenyl isothiocyanate, fluorophenyl isothiocyanate, nitrophenyl isothiocyanate, tolyl isothiocyanate, methoxyphenyl isothiocyanate and 1-naphthyl isothiocyanate, are more preferably used.
      <br/>
      In addition, as amino group of the amino compounds used in the present invention, either of primary amino group, secondary amino group or tertiary amino group can be used and as amino compound, for example, either one of sec-octyl-amine, 6-amino-n-caproic acid, 3-amino-1-propene,  ALPHA -amino-isobutyric acid, aminopyridine, aminobenzenesulfonic acid, diethylenetriamine, triethylenetetramine, tetraethylenepentamine, dipropylenetriamine, N-methyldiaminodiethylamine, polyethyleneimine etc., can be used, however taking the reactivity of the amono group into consideration, it is preferable to have primary amino group at least one at the reaction site.
      <br/>
      In addition, amino compounds with a hydroxyl group can be more preferably used.
      <br/>
      Namely, aliphatic amines such as 2-ethanolamine, 3-propanolamine, 6-hexanolamine, 1,3-diamino-2-hydroxypropane and glucamine and derivatives of N-methyl-1,3-diaminopropanol or aromatic amines such as 4-aminophenol, diaminophenol, aminohydroxypyrimidine, diaminohydroxypyrimidine and diamonohydroxypyrazole or amino acids such as serine and tyrosine can be used.
      <br/>
      In addition, it is preferred that an amino compound with a hydroxyl group is synthesized from a compound only with a hydroxyl group or a compound only with an amino group by reacting it with epichlorohydrin and an amino compound or 1,3-dibromo-2-hydroxypropane etc.
      <br/>
      In this case, the mixing ratio of the amino compound to an isocyanate derivative or an isothiocyanate derivative can be arbitrarily selected and it is preferable that the amount of amino group is an equimolecular quantity or excess to the amount of isocyanate group to suppress the reaction of the hydroxyl group with isocyanate or isothiocyanate group.
      <br/>
      In addition, when urea bonds or thiourea bonds are introduced into a glucide, the same method as described above can be used.
      <br/>
      Namely, when a glucide with an amino group such as chitosan or glucosamine is used, the above described isocyanate derivative or isothiocyanate derivative can be reacted.
      <br/>
      In the case of such a glucide that has no amino group as cellulose, after the hydroxyl group of the glucide is activated using epichlorohydrin or trisilchloride, an amino group is introduced by reacting it with ammonia or diaminoethane and urea bonds or thiourea bonds can be introduced into a glucide utilizing this amino group.

      12 ml (it was sedimentary volume and the dry weight was 1.0 g) chitosan beads ("CHITOPEARL AL-01" manufactured by Fuji Spinning Co., Ltd.) with a structural formula (1) and a particle diameter of 0.1 mm were stirred in 20 ml N,N-dimethyl-formamide for five minutes.
      <br/>
      Then the beads and the solution were separated by means of a glass filter.  (Chemical Structure image '2' not included in text)

    <p num="29">
      This operation which needed 5 minutes per time was repeated 20 times to substitute N,N-dimethylformamide for the water content.
      <br/>
      These beads were gradually added into 100 ml N,N-dimethylformamide wherein 1 g p-chlorophenyl isocyanate was dissolved and the mixture was reacted for 1 hour at room temperature while it was stirred.
      <br/>
      Thereafter, the beads and the solution were separated using a glass filter and washing was performed by stirring these beads in 20 ml N,N-dimethylformamide for 5 minutes.
      <br/>
      This washing operation was repeated 20 times to eliminate completely unreacted p-chlorophenyl isocyanate.
      <br/>
      Then, a washing operation with distilled water was performed the same way to substitute distilled water for N,N-dimethylform-amide and chitosan beads with a structural formula (2) were obtained.

      <br/>
      The initial concentrations of these super antigens were 1 ng/ml and 1 ml of the above described chitosan beads after being autoclaved under high pressure at 120 (degree)  C. for 20 minutes was added into 10 ml plasma and the mixture was shaked at 37 (degree)  C. for 60 minutes.
